We, the editors, had been looking at the Etruscan objects in the Academy's collection of antiquities. R. T. Scott, then the Mellon Professor, joined in our conversation about the possibility of publishing some of this material. He said at one point, "Why don't you do a publication of the entire collection?" Thus he launched us on our journey toward the publication of this volume. Our survey of the range of the collection showed that it was far more extensive than we had realized. And so, with the aid of our third collaborator and photographer, Barbara Bini, we set about looking for authors to write up the specific categories of objects. Her untimely death deprived us of her enthusiastic and knowledgeable support and advice. From the beginning, Jacquelyn Collins-Clinton took part in decisions about the publication's final format; she deserves special thanks for carefully editing many manuscripts, and in some cases transcribing them to the computer. We are also fortunate to have had generous help from our colleague David H. Wright, who, in addition to contributing two articles to the project and advis- ing us on many important points, was indefatigable with his camera and provided us with many photographs year after year. Katherine Geffcken, who joined the project early on, has continued to contribute her unparal- leled knowledge of the history of the Academy and of its collection. The long gestation period of the project took place during a time of transformation in the pub- lishing process, and our original plans changed accordingly. We had initially intended to publish a complete catalogue of the collection. This plan would have involved a lengthy, multivolume printed edition. During a series of discussions it became clear not only that this would have resulted in a prohibitively expensive publication but that our purpose, to make the information available to a wider public, would be better served by harnessing the technology that was just becoming available. As a result, we decided that the best way to achieve a wide dissemination was to publish a paper volume containing a catalogue of essays on the highlights of the collection, including the history of its formation, and at the same time to convert the general catalogue into a database available on the Internet. In addition to Professor Scott, we owe thanks to Mellon Professors Charles Babcock, Michael Putnam, Malcolm Bell III, Lisa Fentress, Archer Martin, Ingrid Rowland, Thomas McGinn, T. Corey Brennan, and Kimberly Bowes, all of whom provided us with invaluable assistance, as did the various directors of the Academy during the last fifteen years. During this entire period we had the unfailing support of the librarians as well as the other officers and staff of the Academy. In particular we wish to thank Wayne Linker, Carmela Vircillo Franklin (Director 2007- 2010), and Adele Chatfield-Taylor (former President of the Academy). Helping us see the project to the end</page><page sequence="16">xx PREFACE AND ACKNOWLEDGMENTS was Eric De Sena, who was responsible for the initial organization of the database, which was com- pleted at the same time as the publication of the present volume. We are grateful to Dr. Valentina Follo for her invaluable help with securing replacement photographs and information on objects during the final editing process. The project was accepted for publication as a Supplement to the Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome, thanks to the Publications Committee of the AAR and its chair, Elaine Gazda. The University of Michigan Press has given us excellent support, and we also thank freelance copy- editor and designer Peg Lourie for her patient attention to this project. Finally, and above all, we thank our contributors for their patience and forbearance during this long period of gestation. We are sad to record here the deaths of Charles Babcock, Norma Goldman, and Emmy and Larry Richardson, who unfortunately did not have the satisfaction of seeing the results of their research and hard work and the final product of the long process that has brought us here. We hope that they know of our gratitude.

De Puma gives an account of the background in which American collectors operated, from the time of the Gilded Age, when, as we see in Henry James's The Golden Bowl, rich Americans were buying antiquities for museums in order to educate and uplift the American public. Expatriates, along with Americans on the Grand Tour, which was still the educational rite of passage for anyone claiming to have any culture, picked up antiquities that they came across in their travels. The second section, "The Collection of the American Academy in Rome," focuses on the nature of the collection, which is extremely varied, spanning as it does the life of the American Academy and reflecting the interests, lives, and vicissitudes of the donors, as well as connections with the collections of mostly American museums and institutions. Its origins also explain the lack of provenance of almost all the objects, which were casually gathered together by their owners and came into the collection at various times. Two exceptions were the coins and inscriptions - these were purposefully bought as study collections, to be used in teaching the numismatic and epigraphy classes for Fellows of the Academy. The final section is Katherine Geffcken's history of the antiquities collection in relation to that of the American Academy. Included are biographical essays of the donors whose names figure in the story of the American Academy and whose interests and adventures go far to explain the character of various parts of the collection. Not surprisingly, authors of the individual Highlights repeatedly refer to her chapter in their accounts of the history and provenance of objects in their sections.

De Puma [The country manor] looked, to begin with, through some effect of season and light, larger than ever, immense, and it was filled with the hush of sorrow, which in turn was all charged with memories. Everything was in the air - every history of every find, every circumstance of every struggle. (Henry James, "The Old Things")1 The ties early is slowly history becoming of the American better known contribution and more to appreciated. the collecting It and is a dissemination complex history of and antiqui- will ties is slowly becoming better known and more appreciated. It is a complex history and will not be easy to reconstruct. It involves many individuals with a wide variety of interests, motiva- tions, and resources. In the following essay, I hope to provide a brief introduction to the topic by examining the careers of three important but lesser-known players. Our investigation will span the period often called the American "Gilded Age," roughly the years between the Reconstruc- tion and the end of World War I (ca. 1865-1920). It will focus on Americans who lived or spent a good deal of time in Italy and collected or supported the acquisition of ancient objects that probably originated there. The Gilded Age in America was a period of enormous confidence and success. Thanks to an unlikely combination of business acumen, loose government regulations, no income taxes, growing consumerism, westward expansionism, and pure luck, many Americans became extremely wealthy. With these new resources, some also became avid art collectors, devoted patrons of the arts, and generous philanthropists. More than a century later, one can still see, in cities and towns across the United States, the tangible evidence of that times taste, greed, and generosity. These elements are enshrined in the many public libraries, concert halls, and museums those Americans built and then filled.2 Of course, many of their luxurious townhouses and country estates survive to remind us of a period of extraordinary opulence and sometimes dubious taste. Although Americans were making important contacts in Asia and Africa, it is fair to say that Europe still attracted the most significant number of wealthy Americans during the Gilded Age. For many Americans, Europe represented the cultural sophistication they felt was absent in most parts of North America. There was so much history and even more art to see and enjoy in Europe. This attitude, the legacy of the eighteenth century's Grand Tour, is still alive in the minds of many American tourists today. It is also interesting that a major focus of this attraction was and still is Italy, especially Tuscany. In a typical Henry James novel, the wealthy Americans might rent or purchase an Italian palazzo in Florence. Today, restoring an old Tuscan farmhouse has become the dream of many Americans contemplating a less drastic and more affordable version of expatriation. 1 The Atlantic Monthly 11 .463 (May 1896) 635. 2 Curti, Green, and Nash 1963.</page><page sequence="19">4 RICHARD D. DE PUMA James Jackson Jarves (1818-1888) One of the first and most important Americans to settle in Italy as an active art collector was James Jackson Jarves, but his route there was hardly direct. He was the son of the inventor Deming Jarves (1790-1869), who had made a fortune with the mass production and distribution of Sandwich glass. During young Jarves's adolescence in Boston, he became seriously ill, even losing his eyesight for a period. Eventually, the family doctors advised his parents that their son should be moved to a warmer climate. They sent James to Hawaii in 1837 when he was only eighteen. He was a percep- tive young man who grasped many details of local life and wrote extensively and articulately about them. Often he assumed the role of an outside observer, almost an anthropologist, as he attempted to understand the conflict between native custom and missionary zeal: [Everywhere you went you were sure to see, conspicuously displayed, a huge Bible printed in the native language. It had completely exorcised all other gods, and was held in a degree of reverence and affection, which gave it an almost supernatural character. Yet its precepts, though gaining ground, were but indifferently appreciated by many church-members. How could it be expected that these sensuous, sensual natures should be suddenly transformed by sermons and threats into missionary asceticism! Their white instructors in taking away their games, dances, festivals, and wars, had given them nothing in return as an outlet of their animal energies. A polka or waltz was proscribed as a device of the devil. Theatricals were something worse. Horse-races were no better than hell's tournaments. Even smoking was made a capital sin, and tattooing was the mark of the beast. . . . There was absolutely nothing left to the poor native for the indulgence of his physical forces or the development of the intellectual but what he hated most, hard labor and theological reading.3 In addition to these observations, Jarves earlier wrote a valuable History of the Hawaiian or Sandwich Islands (1843). This remains a highly respected treatment of the many aspects of Hawai- ian culture and clearly shows the author s skills of investigation. Jarves went on to become a part of Hawaiian history himself, serving as an influential member of the Hawaiian government s overseas negotiations. However fascinating this first, "Hawaiian" chapter in Jarves s life was, it is the second, "Ital- ian" chapter that is more relevant to this exploration. In 1851 Jarves and his young family moved to Paris, where Jarves, who had not been particularly interested in art, came under the influence of Paris and especially the Louvre. During his six-month stay in Paris, he visited the museum many times to wander "through its interminable ranges of pictures, or [become] lost in its vast halls of statuary."4 This was the real beginning of his aesthetic and art historical self-education. In 1852, Jarves moved his family to Florence. They expected to stay for a relatively short time but, despite a number of return visits to America, Florence became their home for the rest of their lives. Much later, from September 1880 to December 1882, Jarves even served as the American vice-consul in Florence, and in 1887, the year before he died, he was made Cavaliere della Corona d'Italia by King Umberto I.5 As Jarves became more and more familiar with the art of his new home, as he read the works of past and present historians, critics, and connoisseurs, he developed a keen sense of artistic taste. He began to buy works of art, especially the almost completely unappreciated paintings of "primitive" 3 Jarves 1857. 4 Jarves 1864. 5 Hackler 1999.</page><page sequence="20">AMERICANS COLLECTING ANTIQUITIES IN ITALY, CA. 1865-1920 5 Tuscan and Umbrian artists. Not surprisingly, his taste was far in advance of most of his contempo- raries and virtually incomprehensible to practical businessmen like his father. His wife, too, became more and more concerned for the financial security of her children as their father spent money the family could ill afford. Throughout his life, Jarves showed almost no ability in handling money or business affairs. Despite many hopeful ventures, he was largely dependent on his father s generosity and the management skills of his first and second wives to survive. The need to collect art almost certainly helped to destroy his first marriage and to embitter his children, and yet he states, "In buying there is a pleasure because it is in an inferior sense a species of creation."6 Jarves was often attracted to types of art that few of his contemporaries appreciated or even recognized. Certainly, this was true of his major collection of early Italian paintings, now part of the Yale University Art Museum. He was also one of the first foreigners to write an intelligent and sensitive study of Japanese art.7 Although the art of classical antiquity had been studied a good deal, Etruscan art and culture were only beginning to be widely appreciated in the nineteenth century. The first public exhibition of Etruscan art had been mounted by Vincenzo Campanari and his three sons in London in 1837, but by midcentury there were only three useful books in English on the subject: Lady Elizabeth Hamilton Gray, Tour to the Sepulchres of Etruria in 1839 (1840); James Byres, Hypogaei, or Sepulchral Caverns of Tarquinia, the Capital of Antient Etruria (1842); and George Dennis, The Cities and Cemeteries of Etruria (1848). No Etruscan art of any importance had yet reached American public or private collections. But Jarves helped to change this situation, first by popularizing aspects of Etruscan art and culture in his Art Thoughts, The Experiences and Observations of an American Amateur in Europe (1870), and second by acquiring two major works of Etruscan art for his hometown, Boston.8 Jarves s treatment of Etruscan art in Art Thoughts is surprising for its sophistication and its prescience. He draws some interesting parallels between the national character and taste of an- cient Etruscans and modern Americans. His discussion of Etruscan women is also unusual for the nineteenth century: [In Etruscan society] woman seems to have held a position equal to man's. She is constantly represented as sharing his cares and joys. The wife was highly honored, not subordinated, as in Greece, to an accomplished class of courtesans; nor was the relation stained by such laxity as at a subsequent period defiled Roman households. Indeed, Etruscan art is singularly pure and serious, except as it borrowed from foreign sources its dissolute Bacchic rites. But these were never very popular. Their artists prefer exhibiting the natural emotions with touching directness and simplicity.9 It is more difficult to assess Jarves 's direct involvement with Etruscan art, but there are tan- talizing suggestions in some of his correspondence. For example, in a letter to his friend Luigi Palma di Cesnola (1832-1904), first director of the Metropolitan Museum of Art, he urges the purchase of Etruscan artifacts and mentions the "recent discovery of a child's tomb, opened at night. &amp; bagged by me at once."10 No details are provided. Although perhaps a colorful exaggera- tion, this seems to indicate that Jarves, now in his sixties, directly participated in (clandestine?) archaeological activities. 6 Jarves 1857. 7Jarves 1876. 8 Comstock and Vermeide 1976, nos. 383-384. 9 Jarves 1870. 10 Letter to Luigi Palma di Cesnola, 8 January 1881: Steeg- muller 1951, 276 n. 10.</page><page sequence="21">6 RICHARD D. DE PUMA This is an appropriate place to remind readers of Luigi Palma di Cesnolas influence on Ameri- can collecting at the turn of the century. His colorful career as an expatriate Italian nobleman, a Civil War hero, and then both the American and Russian consul on Cyprus, where he began his archaeological pursuits, has been traced by several writers and probably should be the subject of a film along the lines of David Lean s Lawrence of Arabia. Like Jarves, he tended to have financial difficulties throughout much of his life. His large collection of Cypriot antiquities was formed in the 1870s with the idea of eventual sale and profit. Again like Jarves, he was at first unsuccessful in finding an appropriate setting for his antiquities; they, like Jarves s early Italian paintings, were un- familiar and less appreciated types of art objects. But in 1872 the Cesnola Collection was purchased by the newly founded Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, and Cesnola himself was hired to install the works.11 There was considerable notoriety on a variety of levels when, on 15 May 1879, Cesnola was made the first director of the new museum. Because the focus of this essay is Italian, not^ Cypriot antiquities in America, we will not examine Cesnola's career in detail. Suffice it to say that his influence on late nineeteenth-century attitudes toward archaeology, antiquities, and museum exhibitions was considerable. The various scandals and lawsuits associated with his restoration of sculptures, the fraudulent "Treasure of Curium," and his often arrogant attitude toward the New York public were the source of numerous newspaper articles and critiques throughout the 1880s.12 In 1895, Cesnola was responsible for the purchase of a collection of almost 900 objects formed by Samuel Thomas Baxter, another expatriate living in Florence. Many of the Metropolitan's excel- lent bucchero vases, bronzes, and cinerary urns come from the Baxter Collection. There is also a series of finely carved, small amber, bone, and ivory objects excavated by Cavaliere (Carlo?) Mārsili, near Verucchio, where so much amber has recently come to light. For our purposes, Cesnolas most significant acquisition came one year before his death in 1904. A wonderful Etruscan tomb had been accidentally discovered in 1902 at Monteleone di Spoleto. The tomb included numerous bronze vessels, both Etruscan and imported Greek pottery, weapons, ivories, and a splendid bronze chariot. Almost all of the material was offered for sale in Paris, and Cesnola purchased it for the museum in 1903. The chariot, recendy cleaned and restored, is the centerpiece of the new installation of the Etruscan Gallery that opened at the Metropolitan in April 2007. 13 After unsuccessful attempts to sell, at a profit, his incredible collection of Italian primitive paint- ings, James Jackson Jarves turned his attentions to acting as an art dealer or agent for a number of wealthy patrons. One of these was Cornelius Vanderbilt II (1843-1899), the namesake and grandson of the famous American millionaire. The younger Vanderbilt was an important contact for Jarves because he had connections with many people of taste and wealth. In 1878, Vanderbilt had become a trustee of the Metropolitan Museum of Art (founded in 1870) and had immediately donated an impressive collection of more than 650 Italian drawings acquired earlier by Jarves. Jarves and George Maquay, another expatriate living in Florence, purchased two magnificent Etruscan sarcophagi. These had been discovered more than forty years earlier, in the winter of 1845-1846, at Vulci and were for many years in the collection of the Prince and Princess of Canino at Musignano. (George Dennis had seen them there and given a brief description of their "singular interest" in an appendix to his chapter on Vulci.)14 These fourth-century B.c. works are the first, and arguably remain the foremost, Etruscan stone sculptures in any American collection. They were 11 Karageorghis 2000, 3-9. 12 McFadden 1971, 242-248. 13 Emiliozzi 1991; 2000. Picòn et al. 2007, 264, 278-281, no. 323.

Jarves was much involved in this exhibition, writing several essays and entries in the various catalogues. No doubt he and Maquay hoped that they might persuade the Boston Museum of Fine Arts (MFA, founded in 1870) to purchase their sarcophagi. At first the sarcophagi were loaned to the museum, but in 1886 the museum purchased (with funds from Mrs. Gardner Brewer) the slighdy earlier and finer of the two. The second was purchased by the Boston Athenaeum but, in effect, placed on long-term loan to the MFA. It was eventually donated to the MFA in 1975 by Mr. and Mrs. Cornelius C. Vermeide III.15 Despite his financial and personal failures, Jarves contributed much to the cultural life of late nineteenth-century America. His collections of Italian paintings and drawings, almost completely unappreciated during his lifetime, are today recognized as valuable works illustrating the devel- opment of the early Renaissance. Although his connoisseurship was hardly infallible, it was more sophisticated than that of most of his contemporaries, and his voluminous writings on art were influential and remain a valuable resource. Arthur Lincoln Frothingham, Jr. : (1859-1923) Another significant player was Arthur Lincoln Frothingham, Jr.16 Like Jarves, he was the scion of a wealthy Bostonian family, but while Jarves was self-educated, Frothingham had spent his early years studying foreign languages in Rome and was, even as a boy, completely at home in both Italy and America. He earned a doctorate from the University of Leipzig (1883) and was Fellow in Semitic Languages and Lecturer on Archaeology at Johns Hopkins University, Baltimore (1882-1886). His long association with Princeton University began in 1887 when, aged 28, he became Professor of Archaeology and Art History. During this period he was an active participant in the formation of the Archaeological Institute of America, under the leadership of Charles Eliot Norton (1827-1908). 17 Norton, the first art his- tory professor at Harvard (appointed in 1874), had been a close friend of Jarves since Jarves had provided a letter of introduction for Norton to John Ruskin in 1855. One should not underestimate the influence all four men had on one another, though the influence was sometimes indirect. The voluminous correspondence between Norton and Ruskin, for example, helped to shape Nortons ideas about the superiority of European culture. It also motivated the three Americans to attempt to improve American culture. Jarves, with the help of Norton, had hoped to do this by installing a worthy collection of Italian primitives that would illustrate the "progress" of painting. But their best efforts failed and, at times, Norton despaired: "we [Americans] exhibit in our civilization neither the taste nor the capacity for any noble works of art." The 1870s were exciting times for European archaeology. The discoveries of Heinrich Schliemann (1822-1890) had brought the field to the attention of a broad audience in Europe and America. Schliemann had published his work at Troy in Trojanische Altertümer in 1874, and this book was almost immediately translated as Troy and Its Remains in 1875. (Schliemann 's brilliant successes no doubt encouraged the highly competitive Cesnola to return to Cyprus in 1875 to "dis- cover" the famed "Treasure of Curium.") By 1878 thousands of copies of Mycenae were revealing Schliemann s spectacular finds from Grave Circle A. It is no wonder that Norton, Frothingham, and 15 Comstock and Vermeide 1976, nos. 383-384.

DE PUMA their Bostonian colleagues were moved to solicit interest in the formation of a new archaeological society. Their first announcement clearly recognizes that America had been slow to embrace this current archaeological interest in any substantive way: "As yet America has taken small part in work of this sort, and has reaped but small benefit from it" (Solicitation of 14 April 1879). Ultimately, a new archaeological institute, modeled on the successful French and German examples, with schools in Athens and Rome and with its own scholarly journal, would surely help to bring culture to North America. This is precisely what was proposed and then formed in 1879. In addition to the scholarly activities, the sponsorship of archaeological expeditions, and the timely publication of archaeological news and research, another goal was "to enlarge the resources of our universities and museums by such collections of works of art and remains of antiquity as [the Institute] may be enabled to make." Frothingham, founding editor of the American Journal of Archaeology™ is an excellent example of a type of robust, enthusiastic academic whose independent means provided entree to even more exalted members of the Gilded Age. He was a very busy professor. He taught courses at Princeton and Rome; he organized excavations in Italy; he was an indefatigable editor and prolific author on a wide range of topics. He was also an early administrator at the newly founded American Academy in Rome, then called the American School in Rome (founded 1895). Frothingham 's ideas about the ideal museum are in harmony with both Jarves and Norton, and he was no doubt influenced by these older, respected authorities. He believed that the best museums were collections of not simply beautiful objets d'art but rather carefully arranged artifacts that documented the develop- ment or "progress" of a specific cultural or ethnic group, or civilization. The archaeological context of specific works was extremely important and, to that end, he was meticulous in collecting and displaying entire tomb-groups, representing the complete contents of an intact tomb. This certainly seems a noble and even modern archaeological ambition, but in fact, Frothingham 's methods were not perfect. First, he was constrained by the difficulties foreigners had at this time in obtaining permission to excavate. He had to content himself with innocuous field surveys or discreet visits to archaeological sites being excavated by sympathetic Italian colleagues. Eventually, he hired one or more Italian archaeologists to excavate areas he (and they) thought promising. Precise records of Frothingham 's archaeological activities are today nonexistent, and so it is impossible to determine the details of his work. We can, however, trace several of these tomb-groups as they moved from archaeological site to field studio to American museum. At various times between 1894 and 1897, Frothingham was commissioned by different Ameri- can museums to acquire suitable archaeological material from Etruscan sites like Bisenzio, Narce, Poggio Buco, Chiusi, Vulci, Orvieto, Pitigliano, Saturnia, and Tuscania. The local archaeologist most favored by Frothingham seems to have been Francesco Mancinelli Scotti, but others including Riccardo Mancinelli and Fausto or Annibale Benedetti may have supplied archaeological finds as well. At least some of these men kept notes on their excavations, but these are never as complete a record as one would hope. Both cremation and inhumation burials were excavated, but human remains were rarely recorded or kept. Occasionally, an especially well-preserved human skull might accompany the pottery and bronzes sent to America. Frothingham 's success lay in his ability as an organizer and connoisseur. He was careful to keep all the objects from each tomb-group together and arranged to have them photographed as a group before they were packed for shipment to America. These "record photographs," sometimes accompanied by a cursory list in Frothingham 's own hand, are often the only documentation we 18Donohue 1985;DePuma 1986, 1-7, 109-1 12; Turfa 2005, 62-68. De Puma and Brownlee 2014.</page><page sequence="24">AMERICANS COLLECTING ANTIQUITIES IN ITALY, CA. 1865-1920 9 have for the scores of tomb-groups excavated under his direction in the late nineteenth century. Un- fortunately, when the crates arrived at their respective destinations, they were not always unpacked and inventoried with the same precision. Frothingham's goal was to provide intact archaeological tomb-groups that could illustrate the development or evolution of specific cultural or ethnic groups in ancient Italy. Thus, most of the objects he acquired for museums in Philadelphia, Princeton, New York, Chicago, and Berkeley were archaeological artifacts, not precious objets d'art. In this regard he was ahead of most of his contemporaries. Phoebe Apper son Hearst (1842-1919) It is difficult today to determine the precise extent and motivations of philanthropic activity in the period we are discussing here. Some interesting attempts have been made by a team of researchers, led by Merle Curti, at the University of Wisconsin. Analyzing the data supplied by late nineteenth- and early twentieth-century journalists and philanthropic organizations, and with the caveat that many details are simply not available, they determined a series of general characteristics. For ex- ample, self-made millionaires, men like Andrew Carnegie (1835-1919), were far more generous philanthropists than those who had inherited their wealth. Most donors contributed to local rather than regional or national institutions, and the majority of gifts went to educational causes or health and welfare organizations rather than to research. This is in strong contrast to much philanthropy of our own time, which is frequendy concentrated in medical research. Female millionaires, of whom there were relatively few, were far more likely to donate to religious groups and the arts than were their male counterparts. A decline in the national economy in 1896 had a negative effect on donations. The Spanish- American War of 1898 encouraged contributions to relief efforts and a shift away from donations to education or the arts. In general, however, the period between ca. 1890 and 1910 was a strong one for philanthropy in America.19 An exception to many of these philanthropic qualities was Phoebe Apperson Hearst. Her family, descendants of emigrants from the British Isles and Germany, farmed or operated stores in Missouri. They were comfortable but not wealthy; the young Phoebe was well versed in the daily chores of farm life. All of this changed when she married George Hearst (1820/1821-1891), whose family came from a similar background and farmed in the same area. George was more than twice Phoebe's age when they married on 15 June 1862. George's family owned more land, but in a series of unfortunate events, he had lost much of it. For more than ten years before their marriage, he had spent time prospecting for gold and silver in California and Nevada. This adventurous decade had not been easy, but in the end, through a combination of perseverance, expertise, and sheer hick, George came out a rich man. George and Phoebe's first and only child, William Randolph, was born in San Francisco in 1863. Although they were very different in age, interests, and abilities, George and Phoebe seem to have had a devoted and respectful relationship. Perhaps the success of their marriage was based more on mutual trust and tolerance than love. In any case, when George died in 1891, he left his entire estate, valued at more than $20 million, to his wife. He probably realized that his son, al- though he had inherited valuable attributes from both his parents, was not likely to be as cautious with this impressive fortune. For the rest of her life, in fact, Phoebe attempted to curb her son's extravagant expenditures. 19 Curti, Green, and Nash 1963; Dyson 1998, 122-157.</page><page sequence="25">10 RICHARD D. DE PUMA Phoebe Hearst did not have an elaborate formal education. For a brief time before her mar- riage at age nineteen, she had been a country schoolteacher, but in general, she was self-taught. In this regard, she was very much like James Jackson Jarves. Phoebe later realized that although she could not be an authority on the many cultural subjects that interested her, she could afford to hire the best authorities to advise her. For our investigation, a turning point occurred at a critical time: Phoebe suffered a major heart attack in 1895, when she was 53 years old. Her physician, Dr. William Pepper, was one of the most important cardiologists in America. By a fortuitous coincidence, Dr. Pepper was also President of the University Archaeology Museum at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia. (This institution is now called the University of Pennsylvania Museum of Archaeology and Anthropology.) During her long recuperation and their many conversations, Dr. Pepper acquainted Phoebe with his archaeological and anthropological interests. She embraced them and was encouraged to participate vicariously through sponsorship of various expeditions. Thus she came into contact with some of the authorities at Philadelphia, espe- cially Sara Yorke Stevenson, Curator of the Mediterranean Section of the museum. Frothingham 's Etruscan tomb-groups, as well as a series of Etruscan sarcophagi from Musarna and other antiqui- ties, were largely acquired for the University Museum through the generosity of Phoebe Hearst. Another Hearst donation came in 1897. Robert H. Coleman, the scion of a family of Pennsylvania industrialists, had purchased a wide assortment of objets d'art assembled by Jarves from the sale of Prince Demidoffs estate in 1880. Among the antiquities were a number of Etruscan bronzes and bucchero vases, as well as some forgeries. Coleman, later faced with financial difficulties, was forced to sell his collection, and with Mrs. Hearst's help, it now came to Philadelphia.20 William Pepper died in 1898. Perhaps lacking his guidance and encouragement, Phoebe Hearst's philanthropy gradually shifted from Philadelphia to Berkeley, from Italy to Egypt, and from Professor Frothingham to Dr. Alfred Emerson.21 Emerson, like Frothingham, was born in 1859 and again acted as a scholarly purchasing agent in Italy. In 1902 he acquired a huge number of Etruscan votive terracottas that had been discovered in 1885 near Cerveteri. The original reports suggest that more than 6,000 terracottas were found. Emerson acquired about 800 examples for the Berkeley museum.22 In the same year, he also added a series of seven Etruscan tomb-groups excavated at Poggio Buco in 1896-1897 by Riccardo Mancinelli, the Orviétan painter who had worked for Frothingham. Mancinelli had also excavated several tombs at the nearby site of Saturnia. Three of these tomb-groups were acquired by Emerson in 1903. All of this material was donated by Phoebe Hearst to the museum that today bears her name.23 Another recipient of Mrs. Hearst's generosity was George A. Reisner. From 1899 to 1905, Reis- ner (1867-1942) directed one of the most precise archaeological projects conducted in Egypt up to that time.24 It was funded almost entirely by Mrs. Hearst. Fortunately, Phoebe Hearst's example had encouraged local philanthropists like John Wanamaker (1838-1922) to continue to sponsor archaeological acquisitions in Philadelphia. Archaeology itself had moved from amateurish treasure hunting to meticulous, scientific recording and analysis of material remains. 20 White et al. 2002,2-3. 21 Fowler 1944. 1 also thank Prof. Anne Laidlaw, a descen- dant of Emerson, for permission to study his unpublished notebooks. 22 Nagy 1988, 1-2; Matteucig 1951, 1. 23 Formerly the Lowie Museum of Anthropology. 24 Reisner was at Berkeley until 1905, when he became direc- tor of the Harvard University-Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, Expedition to Egypt. He continued to work in Egypt until his death, at Giza, in June 1942. Between 1899 and 1905 Phoebe Hearst funded his excavations at Giza, Bailas, and Naga ed- Deir. He added some 17,500 objects to Berkeley's collection in that period.

Their biographies are related in the chapter by Katherine Geffcken. Much of the collection is composed of a variety of objects given to the Academy without prov- enance. Some material, however, comes with exact provenance - as, for example, the Nemi timbers and the Ponte di Nona material - while the provenance of other objects can be determined with some exactness - for example, the cippi from Praeneste and the Etruscan cinerary urns typical of Chiusi. What the resulting collection does offer is an interesting insight into the history of collecting at a particular moment of American scholarship, including the activities of such important figures as Richard Norton, Esther B. Van Deman, Thomas Ashby, and others. There are also a number of particularly strong areas, including the group of inscribed Praenestine cippi, and certain catego- ries of pottery and brick stamps. Not surprisingly, some of these categories have been published previously: the cippi by Patrizio Pensabene, brick stamps by James Anderson, and terra sigillata by Howard Comfort. Important works of art familiar to residents and visitors to the American Academy that are also part of the collection but belong in the modern context have likewise been published elsewhere. These include two sculptures, the Herakles at the Fountain by Paul Manship and the World War I monument decorating the Cortile of the Academy, and the large Gobelin tapestry in the salone with battle scene.1 Connections with Other Collections Spanning as it does the life of the AAR, its archaeological collection reflects the interests of the indi- viduals who donated material and the history of collecting in America. There are various contacts and connections among people and institutions, as well as overlaps in a number of cases with the collec- tions of museums, academies, universities, and smaller collections in Italy and in the United States. As the history of early American collecting is becoming better known through a number of publications, including Richard De Puma's chapter in this volume, a number of connections with 1 Manship fountain: Knauer 1996; World War I monuments: Wright 2000; tapestry: Knauer 2005.</page><page sequence="29">14 LARISSA BONFANTE AND HELEN NAGY American collectors are becoming clearer. One of these collectors was George N. Olcott, a clas- sicist who received his B.A. (1893) and Ph.D. (1899) from Columbia and who was linked with the American Academy at various periods in his career. Since he sold his acquisitions to many colleges and universities in America, his collection is now widely dispersed, at Columbia University, at the University of Illinois, and at Wellesley College as well as the American Academy. While Columbia received a major part of his collection, his widow gave the objects that had remained in his house in Italy - terra sigillata, inscriptions, and lamps - to the Academy in 1925 .2 Connections with museum collections in the United States are also due to Esther Van Deman 's interest in Etruscan and Roman antiquities, which she began collecting in 1901 and 1903, when she was doing research in Rome on the House of the Vestals.3 From 1903 to 1906 she taught at Goucher College in Baltimore, and some time after that, some 215 objects from her collection were housed and displayed in the Archaeological Museum of the Johns Hopkins University, where Ralph Van Deman Magoffin, her favored nephew, was teaching. Upon her death, a portion of Van Demans collection was transferred to the University of Michigan's Kelsey Museum. The group included some samples of marble, Roman bricks, and other building materials from Italy, but most of the objects in the bequest consisted of bronze items, including figurines, keys, spearheads, razors, jewelry, and musical instruments - a sistrum and cymbals. At her death, the antiquities Miss Van Deman had acquired were stored partly at Johns Hopkins, partly in Rome.4 But her will requested that her objects in America be moved for permanent ownership to the Kelsey Museum at the University of Michigan.5 The antiquities she had in Rome, numbering more than 300, came to the Academy's collection. We can trace some of the objects in the collections of the American Academy in Rome, New York University, and the Johns Hopkins University back to the time when the young Ralph Van Deman Magoffin (1874-1942) was collecting objects and inscriptions in Rome as a Fellow at the Classical School of the American Academy, in 1907-1908. His aunt, Esther Boise Van Deman, was at that time a Carnegie Fellow of the School of Classical Studies, 1906-1910.6 Connections with museum collections in the United States - New York University and the Johns Hopkins University7 - are due to his archaeological activities. Ralph Van Deman Magoffin contributed a number of objects to the collections of the American Academy and brought back material from Rome to Johns Hopkins University and New York University, two institutions with which he was connected. He had earned his B.A. from the University of Michigan (1902) and his Ph.D. from Johns Hopkins University (1908), where he taught until 1923 and where he enlarged their collection of antiquities with purchases he had made before coming to New York University (1923-1939).8 His successful career included a ten-year presidency of the Archaeological Institute of America (1921-193 1).9 2 Part of the collection was published by Edlund-Berry 1980, 6-8, 57; Anderson 2008, 16.

When John Bodel published a checklist of the inscriptions in the United States, it was found that several of the inscriptions thought to be at Johns Hopkins were in fact in the epigraphy collection of New York University.10 There was also some confusion with a number of the onion-shaped stone cippi characteristic of Palestrina that Magoffin had acquired, some of which went to the American Academy,11 while others were brought back home to Baltimore. The two in the collection of New York University12 he brought with him from Baltimore when he came to teach there in 1923. In 1910 he published the inscriptions of fourteen cippi, six of which were in the Johns Hopkins University collection and one in his possession; the inscribed cippi now in New York were listed as being in the Johns Hopkins University at that time.13 Magoffin had bought these cippi on one of his trips to Palestrina. He tells of such trips to Palestrina, along with other archaeological adventures, in one of his very successful popularizing books.14 An unpublished letter to Professor Gildersleeve,13 dated 4 April 1907 and fortunately preserved, gives an amusing account of the discomfort of travel in those days. [A] part from learning a litde something about building construction and epigraphy, I am hav- ing lots of fun. Yesterday I broke into a nunnery looking for some old walls, and a young nun ushered me into a room to consult the superior. She came toward me with a little terracotta pot, I thought at first to fumigate me or exorcise away my manlike spirit, but she had only her litde scaldino. One needs a warmer here. I go to bed just as soon as supper is over, for after the sun is down it is awfully cold. In one way the cold helps. It gives my teeth a tendency to chatter, and that assists materially in masticating the Palestrina brand of bread.16 The letter also illustrates the manner in which these smaller collections were built up. As a graduate student traveling abroad, Magoffin was given a small amount of money by the chair- man with which to buy antiquities for the collection of the Johns Hopkins University, where the first important graduate program in archaeology had been established.17 The cavalier manner in which he acquired the material is typical of the attitude toward collecting in the early years of the twentieth century. Katherine Geffcken notes elsewhere in this volume about the collecting practices of Esther Van Deman that no discernible pattern emerges for her collecting, aside from her collection of construction specimens. Although very careful to record the material that related to her scholarly projects, she did not normally note provenance or place or date of purchase of the small antiquities she bought in the markets where these were bought and sold. These objects, much like the material haphazardly found on the bancarelle of Porta Pórtese today, were what Magoffin referred to in his letter as roba , "stuff," useful for students to handle but not important enough to have its provenance - which by then had in any case disappeared - recorded in any scholarly manner. 10 Bodel and Tracy 1997, 202-205; Peachin forthcoming. 11 Pensabene 1982. 12 Long, in Bonfante and Fowlkes 2006, 15-155, cat. nos. 50-51. 13 Magoffin 1910; Bonfante and Fowlkes 2006, cat. no. 50. 14 Magoffin 1929; 1930. 15 Basil L[anneau] Gildersleeve (1831-1924), Professor of Greek at the Johns Hopkins University (1876-1915), found- ed and edited the American Journal of Philology (1880-1920). 16 For Palestrina, see Magoffin 1929, 5-8.

I think we shall have the best lot of archaeological material in the United States, that is, in a University. When I came out here, Dr. Wilson gave me 100 lire to pick up roba for him, and today I got hold of quite a lot of things, from some tombs out here a half mile on the via Prenestina. For 25 lire I got 200 pieces of terracotta figurines, exvotos, lamps, bronze strigils, broken mirrors, coins, nails, buttons, rings, spearheads, fibulae, etc. He took the topography much more seriously, as can be seen in his study of the city of Praeneste published in 1908.18 The history of the archaeological collection of New York University is instructive about the place of archaeology in universities in this period.19 With two of its chairmen, Magoffin and Jotham Johnson, presidents of the Archaeological Institute of America and several faculty members such as Lionel Casson who were alumni of the University's Institute of Fine Arts, the Classics Depart- ment of New York University had a strong tradition in archaeology, both in the classroom and in the field. Magoffin and Casson, later also chairman of the department, were both connected with the American Academy.20 The history of its antiquities collection is intricately linked with the creation of the Classics Department at New York University. Magoffin,21 already the vigorous if controversial president of the Archaeological Institute of America, was invited in 1923 to come to NYU to direct a new multidisciplinary Department of Classics that would consolidate the departments of Greek and Latin and introduce the study of archaeology. He appealed to NYU alumni for the creation of a new archaeological museum as part of his "Vision for the Classics," arguing for the need of a work- ing collection of Greek and Roman antiquities. From such a collection graduate students could be involved in the publication of objects, which were seen as historical documents, providing insights into the lives and beliefs of the people who made and used them.22 Magoffin also lent, donated, and bequeathed antiquities to other collections in the United States. Some 50 objects from the Magoffin collection are in the Columbia Museum of Art in Columbia, SC.23 In 1939 the Florence (SC) Museum was formed with a donation of a significant selection of antiquities by Magoffin, who also spoke at the opening celebration.24 Augmented by later contri- butions of archaeological artifacts, the donation included Greek vases, Roman glass, Palestinian terracottas, and effigies from the island of Crete. An Etruscan impasto krater with inscription in the University of South Carolina was part of a Magoffin bequest in 1966.25 18 Magoffin 1908. 19 For the place of archaeology in academic institutions, and graduate programs at Johns Hopkins, Bryn Mawr, and other universities, see Dyson 1998, 158-216. 20 Magoffin was a Fellow at the Classical School, 1907-1908, and Professor in Charge of Classical Studies at the Ameri- can Academy in Rome, 1920-1921. Lionel Casson, Trustee Emeritus 1979-1995, directed the Summer Session at the American Academy in 1963-1965 and was Mellon Professor, 1981-1982. Jotham Johnson was a Fellow of the American School of Classical Studies in Athens, 1927-1928, and field director of the University of Pennsylvania excavations at Minturnae, 1931-1934. 21 From 1908 to 1934 he wrote eight books on archaeology and history, including Magic Spades: The Romance of Archeol- ogy, which was widely used as a university textbook. 22 R.

Motte, Curator of Collec- tions at the Florence Museum, for his help with this reference.</page><page sequence="32">THE COLLECTION OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN ROME 17 In Rome, another surprising connection throws some light on the contacts that existed between the foreign academies in the prewar period. A fragment in the collection of an Archaic Etruscan relief of a type known to have been a specialty of Chiusi turns out to be closely related to a piece of the same monument in the German Archaeological Institute in Rome.26 This is shown by striking similarities of the upper moldings and the ornamentation, as well as the form and dimensions, of the bases: though the original form and function of the base to which the fragments belonged are hard to reconstruct, stylistic details of the carving of hairstyles, ears, and profiles show that the reliefs were made in the same workshop, if not by the same craftsman. According to the Harmon catalogue of 1907, this grave monument was bought in Rome in 1907; the source is given as Norton.27 The piece of this monument in the German Archaeological Institute must also have been acquired at that time from a dealer in Rome. The network of interconnections among American archaeological collections was reinforced when the Metropolitan Museum sold some of its Cypriot material in 1925, and many universities built up their study collections by acquiring Cypriot vases, statuettes, and bronze lamp stands from the huge collection brought back from Cyprus by the Museum's first director, Luigi Palma di Cesnola.28 As more catalogues of antiquities collections are published, and we learn more about prov- enances and the history of individual collections, we will be better able to recontextualize objects and to reconstruct a history of collecting and collections that includes the way the people and institutions involved in their formation interacted. By tracing further connections, we will also gain insight into the tastes and methods of collecting at the time when the American Academy was acquiring its antiquities. Today, the collection of antiquities at the American Academy in Rome continues to function as a study collection, as it was meant to be from its inception. It has been moved a number of times. It now resides, under the supervision of the Mellon Professor and of Professor Gianni Ponti, Advisor of the American Academy in Rome, in the newly created Richard Norton and A. W. Van Buren Study Collection, designed by Roberto Einaudi in Via Masina 5b (fig. 2.1), where much of the material is undergoing conservation under the guidance of Prof. Luciana Festa of Frosinone. This new facility was built to allow scholars and artists to view the material at close quarters. One artist reported on her experience after completing a series of oil paintings of Etruscan objects from the collection: A few summers ago, I had the privilege to work from the American Academy's extensive Etruscan collection in the privacy of my studio, one on one. I often draw in museums, which is thrilling but distracting. Sitting down alone quietly with an object gave me time to experience ancient Etrus- can art in a new way. The way the objects were made derived from traditions that were repeated again and again, and I could feel the freshness of execution and see the practiced craftsmanship, the sense of movement in composition and the specificity of details. This tradition of drawing extends through the work of Picasso. The objects are alive, spirited. I felt I had a conversation with artists from two thousand years ago [fig. 2. 2]. 29 26 Jannot 1984, 32-33, figs. 129-135; C. Massai Dräger in Neudecker and Cecere 1997, no. 60, 116, figs. 128-130.

Richard Norton and A. W. Van Buren Study Collection, American Academy in Rome. We leave the final word to Dr. Kimberly Bowes, Mellon Professor of Classical Studies at the American Academy in Rome, 2012-2015: Were Norton or Van Buren alive today, they would be doubtless pleased with the ways that the collection continues to inspire and teach. The Fellows from the American Academy continue to find inspiration in the collections - although that inspiration now reaches far beyond classicists and archaeologists to artists and architects. In 2014 alone, the collection has been featured in two artistic projects by Fellows: its encyclopedic qualities inspired Catherine Wagner's photographic meditations on the organization of knowledge, while for architects Catie Newell and Tom Kelly, and writer Peter Bognani, the eclectic nature of those objects inspired a combined installation/ prose project in the Casa Rustica archaeology lab that featured both invented artifacts together with items from the collection. The teaching mission of the collection is now directed principally towards the training of undergraduate students. Students from the famed Intercollegiate Center for Classical Studies (the "Centro") work weekly in the collection, doing individual research projects on unstudied objects. Together with students from the EIS study abroad program, they have begun to mount small exhibits in the AAR gallery - in 2011 on the marble sample collection and in 2013 on the theme of religion in the ancient city [fig. 2.3]. The Classical Summer School continues to make use of the collection and that use will expand to include pedagogical seminars introduc- ing participants to the advantages of teaching classics with objects. Other foreign academies are starting to use the collection for their own summer schools, and future outreach plans are aimed at reaching other student groups - both grade-school children in international schools and university seminars. All these activities are made possible by the hiring in 2013 of the first Norton-Van Buren Ar- chaeology Study Collection curator. Valentina Follo, a Rome native with a Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania, manages the collections outreach programs as well as overseeing the completion and correction of the catalogue and its migration to a new, more sustainable digital platform.</page><page sequence="34">THE COLLECTION OF THE AMERICAN ACADEMY IN ROME 19 Fig. 2.2.

Geffcken Preface The lude. history When of the the American Academy's School archaeological of Classical collection Studies falls merged into two officially major periods with the and American a post- lude. When the American School of Classical Studies merged officially with the American Academy on 1 January 1913, an important part of this collection had already been gathered. In its seventeen years of independent existence (1895-1912), the Classical School steadily received, as donations and long-term loans, artifacts that the faculty could use in teaching and School members could study daily. During this first major period, the dominant collector and donor was Richard Norton, whose association with the School extended over ten years (1897-1907), first as Professor of Archaeology, then as Director. Norton's background and career offer glimpses into the world of archaeology and art collecting at the turn of the century. This introduction, therefore, begins with a biographical essay on Norton, as a way of illuminating how and why the Classical School's collection originally came together. The second major figure in the collection's history was Albert William Van Buren. While Norton was the real founder of the collection, Van Buren lovingly cared for it from 1926 until his retirement after World War II. But Van Buren 's involvement in the collection goes back to his fellowship days under Norton, when he first donated some objects and catalogued the School's epigraphical collec- tion. In his long time as curator, he steadily inventoried, arranged the artifacts in museum rooms, and directed Fellows in publishing parts of the collection. Other men and women played roles in assembling the Academy's collection, some of whom will be mentioned only in the profiles of Norton and Van Buren and some also in separate biographical entries. I have thus chosen a biographical organization for this introduction because professional goals, personalities, and values guided the donors in their purchasing and scholars in their cata- loguing. On more than one occasion, these donors and scholars practiced methods of acquisition or excavation unacceptable to today's archaeologists. But while not applauding their methods, we note that they were fairly typical of their times. Every collection contains a few oddities; I will describe one of these briefly, and then take up the cast collection, no longer Academy property but visible in all old photographs of the Cortile. Finally, I will summarize what we know about the "museum," first at the old Classical School and afterward, from October 1914, at the American Academy on the Janiculum. As for the postlude, I leave that period for Professor Lawrence Richardson to describe.</page><page sequence="37">22 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN Fig. 3.1.

Before this brief and fatal illness, Richard Norton had been working for the American Naval Intelligence Service in France. From 1914 to 1917 he organized and directed the American Volunteer Motor Ambulance Corps, for which achievement both French 1 This brass plaque is now mounted in the Norton Van Buren Room, building 5B, near the cabinets containing Norton's donation.

This unstinting service in World War I drew on the same qualities of leadership, devotion, and love of adventure as his earlier career in archaeology. Norton s official connection with the American School of Classical Studies in Rome extended from 1897 to 1907, first as Professor of Archaeology (1897-1899), then as Director (1899-1907). Earlier, through their common links to the American School of Classical Studies at Athens (ASCSA), Norton had met Herbert De Cou, an 1889 graduate from the University of Michigan. After Nor- ton became responsible for archaeology at the School in Rome, he led the Fellows and students each spring on an exploration of Greek sites. De Cou helped him with lectures and advice, and in 1901 Norton turned over the entire trip to De Cou, who by then was Secretary of the ASCSA.2 So impressed was Norton with De Cous learning and character that he arranged for De Cou to join the School staff in Rome. From autumn 1901 to 1907 De Cou lectured as Instructor in Greek Archaeology, and then he was promoted to Associate Professor. De Cous time in Rome ended not long after Norton s departure from the School, but when Norton finally succeeded in obtaining an excavation permit for Cyrene, he invited De Cou to join his team for the 1910-1911 season.2 Norton's excavation at Cyrene was doomed from the beginning for reasons far beyond the world of archaeology. On 11 March 1911, De Cou was fatally shot by Arabs as he led workmen from the camp to the excavation. The bullets had doubtless been meant for Norton himself; he normally led the way each morning to the site. But that day Norton stayed behind to rest because he had spent several sleepless nights caring for the team's medical officer, who had himself fallen ill. This shocking murder was only one brief event in an international struggle among European powers aiming to snatch Libya away from the Ottoman Empire, which still controlled this stretch of northern Africa, however distantly. The Italians had long yearned to colonize Libya, and they suspected competing German interests behind the American archaeologists or even conjectured that the Americans were actually searching for sulfur deposits. Norton certainly believed the Italian consul at Benghazi had a hand in hiring the Arabs to kill De Cou (fig. 3. 2). 3 On a personal level, De Cou's death ended a long, close friendship between the two men. In- deed, the Norton family had felt responsible for De Cou for some time. About 1906 or 1907, toward the end of Norton's time as School Director in Rome, De Cou suffered a nervous collapse and, by December 1907, had returned to America. While the School kept De Cou's name on the staff and paid his salary, several scholars in the United States tried to find a teaching or museum post for him. For instance, concerned for De Cou's uncertain future, Richard's father corresponded in early 1908 with the chairman of the School's Managing Committee.4 Eventually De Cou spent 1909-1910 in 2 See Norton s ASCSR Annual Report , 1901, p. 37. 2 Sources for the Cyrene excavation and the De Cou affair: Coccia 1998 (see especially photographs of De Cou at Cyrene, p. 72); Fairbanks 1911; Goodchild 1976; Goodchild 1969; Kelsey 1911a; Lapworth 1912, 18, 41, 63 (describes Italian archaeologists' consternation over the sultan's preference for the American team instead of theirs, and the Italians' belief that the German emperor "exerted his tremendous influence in Constantinople" in favor of Norton); R.

Petricioli's evidence shows that Italy, which regarded Libya as a future Italian colony, suspected Americans of aiming to use archaeological excavation as a cover for establishing their own colony. That the Roman government finally recognized its culpability for obstructing the American excavation and for murdering De Cou is indicated by Italy's payment of $25,000 in recompense (at Washington, on 3 July 1913). 4 Professor Andrew Fleming West (Princeton) to Professor Charles Eliot Norton, 19 February 1908, Norton Archives:</page><page sequence="39">24 KATHERINE A.

De Cous murder in 1911, while a staff member of Richard Norton's expedition, must have confirmed in an extremely poignant way this sense of responsibility, leading ultimately to Norton s bequest in memory of De Cou. On leav- ing the Classical School in 1907, Norton had deposited, on extended loan to the School, all the antiquities he had personally acquired as a teaching collection. Notwithstanding the later addition of many objects, the Norton collection remains today the nucleus of the Academy's antiquities. Throughout his whole career, Richard Norton strove to fulfill his father's goals for the classical enrichment of America. Founder of the Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) and the Ameri- can School of Classical Studies at Athens, Charles Eliot Norton summed up many of his ideas in a speech before the first general meeting of the Institute in December 1899.5 In his view, the ancient Greeks were the "preeminent race" in whom the evolution of intelligence culminated, and, as heirs of the Greeks, the Romans were a "commanding race."6 By contrast, America was far behind and must work, through study of the classics and archaeology, to increase knowledge and culture, avoid- ing materialism and "useless specialism," and keeping "general truth" always as a goal.7 Believing that "Americans needed elevating influences,"8 the elder Norton rallied his large circle of friends, former students, and colleagues to support the AIA, the ASCSA, and also excavations of Greek sites. Indeed, exploring Cyrene was among his earliest suggestions.9 A trustee of the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston since 1877, the senior Norton believed in acquiring from sources abroad works of high quality for American galleries.10 Charles Eliot Norton's influence on his son's career is easy to discern.11 Perhaps the father's agenda placed a special burden on this son because about a week after delivering Richard, Susan Sedgwick Norton died of pleurisy.12 In 1892, Richard graduated from Harvard and set off for two years at the ASCSA. Through the School he gained excavation experience at the Argive Heraeum in both the 1893 and 1894 seasons. In those two years he also attended some lectures in Munich (but German scholarship did not appeal to Richard) and became engaged to Edith White, an 1893 shelf mark bMS Am 1088 (7949), publication by permission of the Houghton Library, Harvard University. In this letter, West agrees with Norton's "high estimate" of De Cou but says that De Cou is much better suited to a museum post than to teaching college students. He describes De Cou as possessing "modesty and gendeness" to an almost obsessive degree. At this time, De Cou was in Chicago, regaining health and working on Boscoreale material at the Field Museum of Natural History (see Kelsey 1911a, 113). Earlier, in a letter dated 11 February 1903, Richard Norton wrote to Francis Kelsey defending De Cou against apparendy ugly rumors of drunkenness; Norton stated that De Cou was emphatically not a drinker, that he just held more than most men (Ameri- can School of Classical Studies in Rome file, Papers of F. W. Kelsey, Kelsey Museum Archives, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). 5 C. E. Norton 1900, delivered in New Haven, Connecticut. See Dyson 1989, esp. 130-132, and Dyson 1998, 37-39.

In the late nineteenth century, Italy with its active antiquarian market was a tempting source from which to purchase such originals for American muse- ums. On the other hand, the antiquities authorities in Rome dreaded the launching of another foreign school (besides the French and German) with possible archaeological ambitions, and dealers in ancient objects feared stiff American competi- tion in the market.

John Williams White, Professor of Greek at Harvard, was in fact Annual Professor at the School during the second of Richard's two years there, and Edith spent part of 1893-1894 in Athens. Edith and Richard were later married in June 1896. In the meantime, in 1895 Richard became Lecturer in the History of Art at Bryn Mawr. From there, in 1897 the Nortons went to Rome for the first of ten years at the recently founded American School of Classical Studies. When, after only two years, Richard was appointed Director of the School, his father recognized this as a "great honour for such a youth" but was entirely confident, "He is, I am glad to believe, capable of filling the place serviceably and creditably."13 Immediately on arriving in Rome in 1897, Richard Norton began to carry out his ambition of enriching art holdings in America. The collector he aimed to help was his father's acquaintance Isabella Stewart Gardner of Boston. His first letter to Mrs. Gardner held by the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum archives is dated 7 November 1897, written from Via Genova 30.14 He wrote again the next day about "Nemi bronzes" and on 5 December mentioned "the delight I get from knowing these things are going to America." But Norton also stressed the need for secrecy. On 12 December he wrote to Mrs. Gardner, "Will you please not say a word about me or my hunting out these things for you to a living soul" (underlining his). Mrs. Gardner's answers by cable were coded in the fewest words possible. Later, on 18 April 1902, he assured her, "Most of your letters are burnt and all papers relative to your purchases" (underlining again his). In negotiating for artifacts, Richard Norton sometimes used a mediatore , or agent, and some- times went direcdy to owners. For example, a Polykleitan statue intended for Mrs. Gardner but ultimately sold to Wellesley College was acquired by Norton from an antiquarian and dealers' con- sultant in Rome named Ludwig Pollak. Pollak in turn had bought the piece from Jandolo, Alfredo, and Borghi.15 On other occasions Norton dealt with principi anxious to exchange family treasures for cash. On 25 October 1898, he wrote to Mrs. Gardner about the possibility of purchasing the Ludovisi Throne. Found in 1887 during the breaking up of the Villa Ludovisi properties, the throne was not covered by the Pacca Edict restricting export or alienation of many art objects. Its owner, Principe Rodolfo Boncompagni Ludovisi, was desperate for money after having been caught in the Banca Romana scandals of the 1890s.16 In 1895 the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, was also interested in the throne.17 Ultimately, this piece became the property of Italy, when the prince sold the bulk of 13 Norton and De Wolfe Howe 1913, 284 (letter to Leslie Stephens sent from Ashfield, MA, 8 July 1899). 14 All correspondence between Isabella Stewart Gardner and Richard Norton quoted here comes from the archives of the Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum in Boston. Christina Huemer gave me the interesting detail that Via Genova 30 was Giacomo Boni's residence. While Boni was in Sicily, he offered the Nortons his home (and its menagerie). See Tea 1932, 1:559. 15 Marvin, Leftwich with Thomas 1989, n.p. Dr. Ludwig Pollak, born 14 September 1868 in Prague, educated at the Universities of Prague and Vienna, came to Rome in 1893 on a stipend to study at the German Institute. Richard Norton links him still to the German Institute in 1901, when Pollak showed some of the American School students "the Nelidow collection of gold ornaments" (ASCSR Annual Report , 1900-1901, p. 37). Pollak stayed on in Rome as a private scholar and worked closely, as a catalogue researcher, with Roman art dealers. The American Academy Library owns three of his catalogues. He worked especially for the Jandolo brothers and G. Tavazzi. In the 1890s Antonio and Alessandro Jandolo ran an art dealership at Via Margutta51 (Nash 1959, 107); the Jandolos are sometimes also listed on Via Babuino and at Piazza di Spagna. Mrs. Gardner bought objects directly from the Jandolos in 1897 and 1906. The art dealer G. Tavazzi is possibly identical with or related to the "Signor Tavazzi" who about 1904 presented 45 inscriptions to the Classical School from his Villa Tavazzi, formerly called Villa Bertone, located between Via Salaria and Via Pinciana. On Pollak and Tavazzi, see further Hartmann 1994, who gives the name as Filippo Tavazzi, owner of an antiquities business near Piazza di Spagna and of Villa Bertoni (sic). 16 On the history of the Ludovisi Collection, see Palma 1983 passim, esp. 185-194. 17 Whitehill 1970, 150, 154.</page><page sequence="41">26 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN his sculpture to the state for 1,400,000 lire in December 1900, and the throne was transported to the Terme Museum (Museo Nazionale Romano) on 11 January 1901. 18 But certainly in his efforts, Norton fixed his sights on ambitious acquisitions.19 All, however, did not work out as Richard Norton hoped. His goals were so idealistic and so single-minded that he inevitably came into conflict with other art agents and Italian authorities. In particular, he developed a deep loathing for Bernard Berenson, his chief rival in recommending purchases to Mrs. Gardner. For Norton, his own work as an agent was a service to culture; he never took any payment from Mrs. Gardner for his labors.20 "On the contrary," he wrote Mrs. Gardner on 14 September 1898, "the work is an expense This is the only right way of doing such work." He warned Mrs. Gardner that Berenson was "dishonest," and for years Norton continued to criticize Berenson not only privately but also publicly.21 Early on, in May 1900 Berenson saw Norton in Rome and wrote Mrs. Gardner a favorable comment, "The latter [Norton] seems to have become a splendid fellow, firm, incisive, and with a fine sense of humor."22 But by 1904 Berenson 's wife com- plained to Mrs. Gardner about the lies Norton spread about "B.B." "everywhere."23 And whereas Mrs. Gardner had exclaimed with excitement over Norton s early purchases for her, in 1910 she called him one of Charles Eliot Norton s "bad deeds."24 By then, Richards desertion of his wife and divorce had caused Mrs. Gardner s dismay to turn into vehement derision.25 Besides rejecting Richards warnings about Berenson, Mrs. Gardner became impatient with Nor- ton because he ran into difficulties exporting one of her purchases out of Italy. His normal practice was to ship through Naples, where the old export laws were more lenient than those enforced in Rome and where, for at least a while, he had special connections with a ship's captain.26 If sculptures 18 Palma 1983, 193, 226, 237-245. The government expert evaluated the throne itself at 140,000 lire (Palma 1983, 247). 19 Other notable pieces Norton was interested in acquiring for Mrs. Gardner: the "Fanciulla" of Anzio found in 1878 and acquired by the Italian government for 450,000 lire in 1907 (letter R. Norton to I. S. Gardner dated 18 May 1901) and the Lancelotti Discobolus , which became the property of the Museo Nazionale Romano in 1953 (letter R. Norton to I. S. Gardner dated 8 November 1899). 20 Later, beginning in 1904, Norton did receive a retainer of $250 a year from the Fogg Museum, Harvard University, for help in acquiring items for the museum. I owe this infor- mation to Sally Anne Duncan. Mrs. Duncan also drew my attention to Edward Waldo Forbes, who arrived in Rome in December 1898 and soon began purchasing paintings with Richard Norton's help. In 1909 Forbes became Director of the Fogg Museum, to which he had already lent many of these paintings. See Mongan, Coolidge, et al. 1971, passim, esp. 9-28. Thus, Richard Norton's talents and tastes as an art agent directed the early formation of the Fogg collection. 21 Berenson arranged to charge Mrs. Gardner a 5 percent commission, which he wanted sometimes to "adjust up- ward"; Edward Perry Warren, the chief agent for classical antiquities at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, received 30 percent above the original cost (Samuels 1979, 328). Norton also loathed Warren (letter to I. S. Gardner, 24 November 1898), although his own father backed Warren's efforts for the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (Whitehill 1970, 152-153). On R. Norton's opinion of Berenson, see also Shand-Tucci 1997, 190. Richard Norton was doubtless influenced by his father's negative views of Berenson (Shand-Tucci 1997, 116-117, 172-173). 22 Hadley 1987, 2 15. The volume also includes letters of Mary Berenson (Mrs. Bernard Berenson). 23 Hadley 1987, 328-329 (2 January 1904). 24 Hadley 1987, 468 (I. S. Gardner to B. Berenson, 4 March 1910). For further comment on Norton's dislike for Berenson, see Samuels 1979, 414^117. Norton's gossip about Berenson was closely linked to the criticisms spread in London by Sandford Arthur Strong, whom Eugénie Sellers married in 1897 (Mrs. Strong, later the Assistant Director of the British School at Rome). When the Berensons saw Mrs. Gardner's Fenway Court for the first time in 1904, they were shocked to see one painting acquired through Richard Norton and another "probably" bought through him. 25 See below, p. 63, for Norton's divorce. 26 R. Norton to I. S. Gardner, letter dated 9 November 1899. On 16 November 1906, Professor Francis Kelsey wrote from Ann Arbor to Professor Harry L. Wilson in Rome advising him that he (Kelsey) had never had any trouble exporting from Italy; he said that the authorities in Rome and Naples watch the dealers, and when they realize the exporter is an American professor, they do not bother (F.

He shipped arms in one container, head in another, and torso in yet a third since, in this way, whatever part or parts the authorities examined looked much less valuable.27 In addition, he secreted pieces in trunks and among personal effects. But the headless peplophorus discovered on 12 March 1901, 12 meters down near Via Lucullo and Via Sallustiana, and acquired for Mrs. Gardner by Norton in the same year, was a single block and too bulky to be handled in these devious ways. As this statue had been published,28 it was well known to officials, and apparendy Norton s efforts to export it attracted special attention and caused a row in the Italian parliament. In June 1902, the old Neapolitan regulations were annulled under the first law governing all the national tutela. Norton s last extant letter to Mrs. Gardner, dated 30 May 1904, reports that the "headless lady" waits at Naples, but its export has been blocked. As late as 1923, within a year of her death, Mrs. Gardner was still hoping to see the statue installed in her Fenway Court.29 Since 1914 the peplophorus had been on display at the American Academy; it remained there until 1936, when its export was finally arranged.30 Evidence about Norton s ambitious work for Isabella Gardner establishes the context for his similar, if less grandiose, efforts to build a didactic collection at the American School of Classical Studies in Rome. In his report on his first year as Director (October 1900), Norton states, "It would be well to consider the advisability of gradually gathering other collections [besides the Library] in the School for the use of the students."31 In fact, the School already possessed a few items when Norton arrived as Professor of Archaeology in 1897. Within its first year, James Loeb of New York of Michigan, Ann Arbor). Kelsey's remarks, however, may be a bit out of date because he had been Professor of Latin Language and Literature at the School in Rome in 1900-1901, a year before the new Italian law was passed abolishing regional export rules. 27 See Norton's letter to Professor Alice Van Vechten Brown, Art Department, Wellesley College, written from Rome: May 28, 1904 Dear Miss Brown, I have been delayed in attending to your affairs since my return by an attack of fever. Now, however, everything is settled. The arms were sent in a separate box from the Statue so that it would not look too perfect to the officers at the export office. The same was done with the head of the Polykleitan figure. Arms and head are now on their way. The Polykleitan figure without the head was estimated by the Govt, at 6000 lire so I think you may consider you got it cheap.

Gardner in loaning to the Academy temporarily a very beautiful fifth century Greek statue. [The peplophorus is actually a Greco-Roman version of a fifth-century Greek work.] The presence of this statue in our building is a sculptural benediction, and when we grow discouraged we visit it to effect a homeopathic cure. " Perhaps Director Carter did not realize how annoyed Mrs. Gardner was at not seeing her statue installed in Fenway Court! For the statue, now at the Gardner Museum, see Vermeide et al. 1977, 6-7 and frontispiece. Richard Norton's purchases for Mrs. Gardner date between 1898 and 1901: eleven pieces of ancient sculpture (one of these "probably" through Norton), the Lamentation by Giovanni della Robbia, a Renaissance relief from Rome, and four paintings (one of these "probably" through Norton). Besides Vermeide et al. passim, see Hendy 193 1 , passim. About the time that arrangements between Rich- ard and Mrs. Gardner must have been increasingly difficult, in early 1902, Professor C. E. Norton gave ISG Alessandro Longhi's portrait of Alessandro Contarmi. He later (1905) sold her two paintings. Possible peace offerings? Another collector whom Richard Norton helped was Mary Bryant Pratt Brandegee (Mrs. Edward D. Brandegee) of Brookline, MA, who became a benefactor of Harvard, especially the Fogg Museum, and established the Brandegee Foundation. The "Renaissance Library," which Norton secured from her on loan to the Classical School in Rome, passed into Acad- emy ownership and is part of the AAR Library today.

Then, by 1897 the Schools second Director could report the acquisition of several inscriptions and the assembling of squeezes. Indeed, a room was set aside in the Schools new home, Villa Cheremeteff, for inscriptions.32 Donors were also beginning to pres- ent study collections of ancient marbles: Allan Marquand of Princeton, Professor of Archaeology at the School in 1896-1897, and Alden Sampson of Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania, who lent the School (indefinitely) 133 samples in 1897-1898. In 1898-1899, the most significant gift so far came to the School when an English physician living in Rome, Dr. T. Edmonston Charles, donated his collection of Etruscan antiquities.33 Norton's influence probably lay behind this gift. T. Edmonston Charles's name first appears in School records in the ASCSR Annual Report for 1896-1897, where he is described as a "local archaeologist and warm friend of the School, [who] presented it with an interesting and valuable collection of photographs, taken from prints and en- gravings of Rome as it was in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries."34 He was especially active in the British and American Archaeological Society, established in 1865 to promote archaeological knowledge among English-speaking people in Rome. The Society offered lectures in its quarters or on sites, and Fellows and students from the School were granted free tickets to hear, for example, Rodolfo Lanciani and Eugenie Sellers Strong, as well as Dr. Charles.35 The Ashby family was also active in the Society. Norton begins to appear in Society reports in February 1898, when he presided at a lecture, and in March of the same year, when he met a large party of Members and Associates at the Capitoline Museum. There Norton gave "a learned and elaborate description of certain monu- ments."36 Norton continued an active Honorary Member, giving lectures and presiding occasion- ally, until he left Rome in 1907. But Dr. Charles resigned from the Society in November 1899 and, shortly after, returned to England. He died sometime during 1905-1906. The gift of his Etruscan collection to the School seems logically linked, then, to his departure from Rome. In 1907, when a School Fellow, Austin M. Harmon, completed the first catalogue of the collec- tion, he reported in his introduction that no inventory of the Charles collection existed that would enable him to discriminate precisely what came from it and what from Norton's long-term loans, which by 1907 were extensive. He did, however, have on hand two letters to Charles from a friend (or mediatore) dated 3 and 19 June 1889, indicating that about half of the Charles collection came from a man named Bazzichelli at Viterbo and the other half from Mancini at Orvieto (see the copy of Harmon's introduction appended, pp. 81-82). George Dennis, in his accounts of Viterbo and Orvieto, mentions both these local excavators. At Viterbo Dennis met Signor Giosafat Bazzichelli, 32 ASCSR Annual Report, 1895-1896, p. 46. 33 ASCSR Annual Report, 1899-1900, p. 42. 34 ASCSR Annual Report, 1896-1897, p. 147. 35 Originally established as the British Archaeological Society at Rome, the name was changed to include "American" by 1884, when the Society began publishing a journal. The journal seems not to have survived after 1912, but the Society was still offering lectures between the world wars (AAR A«- nual Reports occasionally mention lectures before the Society given by, for example, C. D. Curtis, A. W. Van Buren, and E. Van Deman). The Society had a library for its subscribers and, by courtesy, free to the American School Fellows and students (some of these books eventually made their way into the AAR Library). Located in 1890 near Piazza Barberini at Via S. Basilio 20, the Society moved in 1895 to Ripresa dei Barberi 16, and, when that street disappeared during construction of the Victor Emmanuel Monument, it moved back to the Barberini area, at Via S. Nicola da Tolentino 72. Ambassadors, titled British citizens, clergymen, and wealthy American expatriates dominate the membership lists. For lectures by Charles, see Journal of the British and American Archaeological Society of Rome 2 A (1893-1894) 166 (at the Atrium Vestae , with his litde boy dressed as a Vestal Virgin); 3.1 (1898-1899) 3, 7 (at the Villa Giulia); by Norton, 3.3 (1900-1901) 129-130 (on ancient portraiture: the best of Greek classical portraiture suggests "the inner, nobler life"; Roman portraiture impresses the viewer as "vigorous but ugly"); 3.4 (1901-1902) 135, 137, 139 (included a tribute to the goals and interests of the first generation of the Society).

Bazzichelli had excavated not only his own property at Castel d'Asso but also at Musarna and at "many other cemeteries in the great Etruscan plain."37 At Orvieto Dennis saw "Signor Riccardo Mancini, the happy man who owns these tombs [at Crocifisso del Tufo] , and who carries on excavations here throughout the winter [beginning in 1872]. . . . Most of the produce of Mancini's pickaxe is now stored in the palace of the Conte della Faina, facing the Duomo"38 G. F. Gamurrini, a serious ar- chaeologist who observed Mancini's work closely, deeply disapproved of Mancini's precipitous and destructive treasure-hunting, all aimed at profit.39 Thus, after circuitous routes from Viterbo and Orvieto through a mediatore and then Dr. Charles, these objects from Bazzichellis and Mancini's explorations became the School's first real museum objects. Much later, in the autumn of 1914, Professor Joseph Clark Hoppin purchased the residue of Mancini's excavation material, mostly sherds, and presented approximately 2,4 1 1 pieces to the newly united American Academy. Though Norton had been gone from the School for seven years, once again his links with a donor may have played a role: Norton and Hoppin knew each other from Harvard, the American School at Athens, and excavations at the Argive Heraeum - and Norton had included Hoppin in the 1910-1911 Cyrene team.40 In addition to encouraging other donors to increase the School's collection, Norton himself deposited on long-term loan hundreds of objects he acquired in Rome and on his travels around the Mediterranean and from faraway Turkestan. Purchasing actively between 1900 and 1907, Norton must have wanted to see his objects, as well as others given to the School, organized in usable fash- ion. Hence, the catalogue completed by Austin Harmon, Fellow at the School from 1905 to 1907. Norton appears to have gone carefully over the catalogue, noting in his own hand in the margin many of his own objects, "Loaned by R. N." But unfortunately, as Harmon states in the introduc- tion, Norton never indicated from whom he acquired antiquities in Italy or what their provenance was. Norton was clearly interested in the sculpture market, a priority that Harmon recognized by beginning his catalogue with Norton's sculpture. When buying during his travels outside Italy, Norton was more eclectic. In his reports, Norton writes that he traveled primarily to examine routes for future School trips or to search for excavation sites outside Italy. (As the School was a foreign institution, Italian authorities denied it permission to excavate in Italy.)41 In the spring of 1900, Norton joined, for a short time, a trip through the Greek islands organized by the Director of the British School at Athens.42 From this cruise probably came the three obsidian flints (Harmon nos. 62-64) from Phylakopi on Melos. Since the British had been recently excavating Phylakopi (1896-1899), a stop there was logical. Norton then left the group to travel in Asia Minor. Next, in the spring of 1901, Norton went to Palestine and Syria.43 A year later he headed 37 Dennis 1883,1:153. 38 Dennis 1883,2:46. 39 Bizzarri 1968, 4, 6-7 (quoting Gamurrini, Notizie degli Scavi di Antichità [1881] 48). Norton incidentally was in contact with Gamurrini in 1903, as shown in Richard s letter to his father's old Harvard student William Roscoe Thayer, dated 26 September 1903 (Norton Archives; shelf mark bMS Am 1081 [1336], publication by permission of the Houghton Library, Harvard University). 40 Much of the Mancini residue was discarded in the 1948 inventory.

His Annual Report for 1901-1902 concludes with an enthusiastic listing of projects in Tunisia for School Fellows and students. The French authorities had assured him of permission to excavate, and he had in hand funds to begin.44 Why these plans did not materialize is unclear. From this trip come Norton s acquisitions in Sbeitla, Tebessa, and Kasserine. In 1903 Norton s travels became even more adventurous. He was already planning to explore Turkestan when he was invited to join the Trans-Caspian Expedition sponsored by the Carnegie In- stitution of Washington and led by Raphael Pumpelly.45 Funded by a grant from James Loeb, Norton spent several months in the summer of 1903 with Pumpelly 's group traveling through remote areas. Numbers 45 1 - 469 in Harmon's catalogue describe the objects Norton brought back from Turkestan. An extensive cruise in the spring of 1904 enabled Norton to add many, many antiquities to his collection stored at the School. Indeed, the yacht Utowana belonging to his good friend and the School's benefactor, Allison Vincent Armour, must have ridden deep in the water from the weight of objects acquired on this trip (fig. 3.3). More is known about this cruise than about Norton's other travels because Dr. David Hogarth, keeper of the Ashmolean Museum and another good friend of 44 ASCSR Annual Report, 1901-1902, pp. 37-38. 45 R.

Norton's, went along on the Utowana and later described the expedition.46 Also aboard were two men of future importance to the Classical School, Albert William Van Buren, a School Fellow, and Charles Densmore Curtis, a School student.47 The Utowana paused at Thera, then sailed along the shores of Crete, next anchored at one site after another on the coast of Asia Minor, at Rhodes, and then went on to Lycian and Pamphilian ports (fig. 3.4). They touched at Cyprus, and then cruised 46 Hogarth 1910, 5 : 108-15 1 . For a photograph of the Utowa- na at Cnidus, her whaleboat, and the passengers, see plate facing p. 108. The Van Buren Papers (American Academy Library) include two photographs of the yacht, outside and inside, inscribed by Armour to Van Buren. Armour seems to have used Malta as home port. Years later an American designer from Boston and a director of the excavations at Assos, Francis Henry Bacon (1856-1940), wrote to A. W. Van Buren from his retirement home at Chanakkale on the Dardanelles. He had been read- ing Hogarth's account of the 1904 cruise on the Utowana. 8 June 1929: "I . . . see that vou were a member of Alison [sic' Armour's party in 1904 on the Utowana: . . . Dick Nor- ton whom I knew in 'Knickerbockers.' Good little Curtis, always so welcome at our 'Club' meetings in Boston. The kindly Armour . . . And then Hogarth - what a jolly time you must have had in the Utowana's cabin! I've been there. (Those who sat to windward were more comfortable at the swinging table! ) And then to see those glorious Marble cities of Asia Minor!" Three years later Bacon wrote almost the same words to Van Buren, 7 September 1932. About Dick Norton, he added, "He was ever ready for a coon hungup at Ashfield! I wonder if you ever stayed with Prof Norton up there! " ("Ashfield" refers to Prof. Charles Eliot Norton's country home in Massachusetts.) Both letters: in the A. W. Van Buren Papers, Library, American Academy in Rome. On Bacon, see Dyson 1998, 64-65. 47 In his ASCSR Annual Report for 1903-1904, Norton says there were three students; so far I have not identified which of eight other male students that year is the right one (the women students and Fellows seem to have gone on only a part of the annual Greek trip). In his newspaper account, Hogarth names Van Buren and Curtis, but no other student (Hogarth 1904).</page><page sequence="47">32 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN to Cyrenaica, and finally to Sicily.48 The climax of this expedition was achieving access to Cyrene, "that long forbidden city. . . . But," the British Hogarth added, "the Youngest Race sees no reason why it should not go anywhere on earth."49 For Norton this stop was clearly a survey to assess pos- sibilities for future excavation. Hogarth provides a vivid account of landing at Apollonia and the ride on "flagging beasts"50 with a scirocco pending, up to Cyrene itself. (Since not enough mounts were found for Van Buren and Curtis to go also, they as the youngest had to stay behind on the yacht.)51 Hogarth's sections on the political reasons for danger at Cyrene, on the true or supposed threat of the fanatic Senussi Order, and on the xenophobia of many inhabitants help to explain why, later in 1910-1911, Norton's expedition was doomed. By then the Italians had learned how to exploit this hostility to strangers. Harmon's catalogue shows, on careful reading, how many artifacts Norton and Armour brought back from this trip. Van Buren and Curtis also made some donations. In his description of buying at Side, Hogarth captures the zest with which they purchased, using language unacceptable today but at the time shared with many other collectors: We spent some exhilarating hours in unashamed quest of forbidden things. It were easy enough now to justify our looting, for, else, those marbles had gone long ago into the limekiln. But I doubt if any one of us thought a moment about justification, as we were loading the whale-boat once and again with spoils of Side [sic] . We were filled full of the lust of loot, possessing ourselves of treasure ready made, reaping that we had not sown, tasting a joy which recks as little of justification as any on earth. It is the joy which has made pirates and filibusters and mercenary adventurers.52 The sleek American yacht became a veritable treasure chest. Had she gone down in the storm that hit her off Apollonia, she would have proved an unusual wreck to modern underwater exploration. Norton assisted Hogarth on at least two later expeditions. From December 1906 to March 1907, he joined Hogarth in excavating tombs at Asyût (spelled "Siut" by Hogarth and "Assiut" by Harmon) for the British Museum. Although dissatisfied with this campaign, which he never published, Hogarth nevertheless left an entertaining description of living for the winter in a huge, drafty grotto and engaging in scientifically approved "body-snatching."53 A year later, in March 1908, after Norton had left the directorship in Rome, he accompanied Hogarth on an arduous journey in Syria.54 Such experiences surely prepared Norton to say, upon inviting participants for his Cyrene project, "If any youth wants to find himself, to know whether he is fit to live among and handle men, let him come to Cyrene."55 No objects in the Academy collection appear to have come from the time in Syria, but in the spring of 1907 he brought back about 170 objects from Egypt- most from Asyût and several from Naukratis. Almost a third of these were given in 1948 to the Vatican 48 The Harmon catalogue lists four portraits from "Palmyra 1904" lent by Norton to the School collection (Harmon nos. 26-29). Were these acquired in southern Asia Minor or on Cyprus? Hogarth mentions no stop near Palmyra itself. But he seems not to have mentioned every stop. For instance, there are objects bought at Thera, but he does not discuss a stop there. 49 Hogarth 1910, 123. 50 Hogarth 1910, 126. 51 Hogarth 1910, 125; 1904. 52 Hogarth 1910, 121-122.

Not enough evidence now exists to explain the personal dilemmas he confronted. In May 1904, right after the cruise on the Utowana , he complained of "an attack of fever."57 In the winter of 1905-1906, he suffered "neuralgia" in his head and sleeplessness and was advised by doctors to take a rest.58 In June 1906, he suddenly broke up his marriage; that summer Edith White Norton returned to her family home in Massachusetts, bringing her only child Susan. Almost four years later, in February 1910, she divorced her husband in East Cambridge court on grounds of desertion.59 The year before, in 1909, gossip circulated that "Dick" Norton was to marry a Bostonian named Mrs. Ellen Nickerson (who, in fact, to Isabella Stewart Gardner's glee, married someone else).60 In any case, the Norton divorce was a serious local scandal, reported in Boston and Springfield newspapers. In September 1906, Norton wrote to the School's Executive Committee asking to be relieved of the directorship the next summer.61 With the committee's consent, he left Rome on 30 November to join Hogarth in Egypt for three months. While he was away, his colleague, the flamboyant Jesse Benedict Carter, was Acting Director. Carter, Professor of Latin at the School since 1904, had a personality that demanded space and a stage. This year at the School seems to have been chaotic. In a letter to Thomas Day Seymour, dated 7 February 1907, Francis Kelsey referred without expla- nation to "the Carter matter," hoping that Seymour would propose some way of "closing up the 'incident'."62 To what "incident" he was referring is unknown. Remarkably, even in this atmosphere (note also De Cou's collapse, mentioned above), Harmon was able to finish his catalogue. A man of contrasts, Norton had a romantic approach to ancient art, much charm and gener- osity, but he was also a person who, once he took sides in a controversy, spared no scorn against his opponent. Such personal views survive in several letters he wrote to the London Times. He became, for instance, a firm supporter of Giacomo Boni and stringent critic of Bonis predecessors 56 J. P. Uhlenbrock has shown that in 1909 Norton donated to the ASCSR a Greek Christian inscription he purchased in Benghazi, spring 1909. The inscription is now mounted into the south wall of the Cortile at the American Academy in Rome (invģ no. 9319; Cortile Bay XII, no. 99). See Uhlenbrock 1999, 84, 96 n. 28. 57 See Norton's letter to Professor Brown of Wellesley, quoted above, n. 27 (28 May 1904). 58 Andrew Fleming West (chairman of the School's Execu- tive Committee) to Professor Kelsey, 6 June 1906 (American School of Classical Studies in Rome file, Papers of F. W. Kelsey, Bendey Library, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). West quotes Norton's report on health. 59 Clippings in the Norton archives, Isabella Stewart Gardner Museum: Boston American , 25 February 1910; Springßeld Homestead , 26 February 1910. Statements filed by Norton's lawyer in the divorce proceedings assured the court that there was "no misconduct on the part of Mrs. Norton" and "no unwillingness to live with him" ( Boston American). See Turner 1999, 408, 468 n. 42. Mrs. Norton's return to her family home is noted in the Wellesley ' 93 Quindecennial Report (June 1908) 56. Con- temporaries described Mrs. Norton as "dear" (ibid., 37); Professor Sophie Jewett of Wellesley, who saw Mrs. Norton in Rome, wrote, "She is a pretty litde woman, and very attrac- tive" (Jewett Papers, 24 November 1901, Wellesley College Archives). Her experience with Norton seems not to have turned Edith Norton against the classics: the Quindecennial Report , p. 15, recounts a lively talk she gave, "A Plea for the Humanities - The Glory that was Greece, the Grandeur that was Rome." 60Hadley 1987, 434 (Mary Berenson to I. S. Gardner, 3 Feb- ruary 1909), 467 (B. Berenson to I. S. Gardner, 18 February 1910), 468 (I. S. Gardner to B. Berenson, 4 March 1910). 61 See details in A. F. West, ASCSR Annual Report , 1906- 1907. Norton's request to resign was granted by the Managing Committee of the School on 7 January 1907. Turner 1999, 408 believes that Norton's resignation was a direct result of his decision to leave Edith: " It did not take Richard long to understand that he would have to resign as director of the American School at Rome ..." 62 Letter from F. W. Kelsey to T. D. Seymour, 7 February 1907, handwritten from the Murray Hill Hotel, New York City (box 8, folder 1, Kelsey to Seymour file, AIA Archives, Boston).</page><page sequence="49">34 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN in the Forum: "One important result attained [from Bonis work] has been proof of the complete incompetence of the earlier excavators."63 This and other statements led to an exchange of let- ters with Lanciani in the Times , in which the references to each other are polite ("my good friend Professor Lanciani" in a letter published 16 March 1900), but the differences clear.64 Furthermore, Norton was vehemently scornful of the Italian museum bureaucracy. This scorn appeared in his letters to the Times but, if known in Rome, was sure to alienate such a powerful figure as Felice Barnabei, head of the Direzione for antiquities and the Belle Arti (1896-1900): "Mismanagement of museums is not uncommon in Italy, but it would be hard to find a worse case than in the Museo delle Terme."63 Barnabei was founder and ardent promoter of the Terme Museum. Later, in May and June 1910, as Norton visited Cyrene to plan his excavation, he saw the Italians as his enemies, who "spread false reports about [his] intentions."66 On 3 October 1911, shortly after Italy declared war on Turkey, Norton published a letter in the London Times debunking the reasons Italy gave for her claim to Libya. His stance caused angry reaction not only in the Italian political press but also among archaeologists in Rome.67 Esther Van Deman, writing in January 1912 from Rome, explains to Professor Kelsey of Michigan why Norton's statements were offensive: "I fear many did not find Mr. Norton's remarks quite so innocent as they seemed to you. The anger was not wholly over the words per se , but rather the long stored up sense of wrong, because of his dishonorable - under the Italian laws, at least, illegal - removal of works of art from Italy, for many years. ... I have grown to feel deeply with Italy in the matter. . . . I am . . . ardently hoping no more unwise speeches may render honest work more difficult in Italy."68 Apparently, as these remarks show, Norton did not keep his export of antiquities separate from School life. Unlike Miss Van Deman, many Americans at that time would probably have agreed with Norton. Kelsey was certainly inclined to side with Norton on Libya. In stating his firmly held opinions, Norton could be straightforward, reportorial in style, or sometimes florid. As an excavator, he saw the lure of "dark mystery" for "the insatiable explorer"69 - and also a test of virtus and honor. Above all, Greek art stirred him to extravagant language. In describing a head of Athena found at Cyrene, he wrote, "Fortunate is the excavator who can add to the world's store of beauty an object such as this, from the best period of Greek sculpture. . . . The head bends slightly to the left, like a flower on its stem . . . the mouth sensitive as the dew on the grass."70 Such imagery appears in Antonio Mancini's portrait of Norton, painted in Rome, probably toward the end of his directorship. Sitting in a lush garden, a well-dressed gentleman, relaxed but with head erect, Norton looks steadily at the viewer. Behind his right arm is a marble female head, bent slightly to the side and gazing downward. Not of course the Cyrene head, discovered later, but no less an indication of Norton's abiding interest in ancient sculpture.71 63 Times (London), 13 February 1900. 64 For further comment on Norton, see Wiseman 1985-1986, 128-129, 139-140.

The third child of Solomon Loeb and Betty Gallenberg, he was born on 6 August 1867 into one of the great German Jewish banking families of New York. As remembered by family and friends, Jim Loeb was not only a gifted musician and genuine intellectual but also attractive and winning in personality. A member of the class of 1888 at Harvard, Loeb studied under Charles Eliot Norton and John Williams White, mentors who instilled in him a lifelong devotion to the classics and archaeology. Professor Norton enlisted Loeb s aid for Harvard, the AIA, and for the ASCSA, to which Loeb contributed substantially not only during his life but also through his will. From 1909 to 1930 he served the ASCSA as a trustee. As plans got under way for a Classical School in Rome, Loeb came forward as an early supporter. In its first year (1895) he is listed as a contributor, and many times afterward, he gave to the Rome Schools endowment or paid for Richard Norton s trips (e.g., the expedition to Turkestan in 1903, the exploratory campaign in the Cyrenaica in 1909, and the excavations at Cyrene in 1910-1911). In 1895-1896 funds from Loeb secured the first object in the Schools archaeological collection, a cippus; his relative by marriage and a member of the Schools Managing Committee, Professor of Richard and Edith) 1989, to the Society for the Preserva- tion of New England Antiquities, Boston. Antonio Mancini (1852-1930) was an extremely active painter who specialized in portrait studies. He maintained a studio on the Aventine. On Mancini, see Olson 1992, 230-233. It is interesting to compare the similar pose (seated, viewed from the left side) of Charles Hopkinson's portrait of Charles Eliot Norton (frontispiece in Lord 1947). After his departure from the School in Rome, Richard Norton, as indicated above, con- tinued to travel. Between his time with Hogarth in Syria and excavating in 1910-1911, Armour took him in 1909 on the Utowana to the Cyrenaica (in preparation for the excavation). Again, right before World War I Armour and Norton sailed on the yacht to Cyzicus, exploring possibilities of excavating there. He speculated about excavating at Siwa in western Egypt (Norton to Professor Kelsey, 30 March 1914, Norton file, Papers of F. W. Kelsey, Kelsey Museum Archives, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). In America, the scandal of Richard's deserting his wife foreclosed any future academic appointment. But in autumn 1907, prob- ably thanks to his father's influence, the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, appointed Richard as an agent, and he sailed for Europe on 1 November 1907. Thereafter, mostly based in London, he circulated among art dealers, supported on a salary contributed by friends (Turner 1999, 408-409). He published Bernini and Other Studies in the History of Art in 1914 - about which his brother Eliot wrote a suggestive comment to Professor Kelsey (25 May 1915): "I think you knew his father well enough to appreciate with interest and with humor how strange a product his book is both in its excellencies and in its deficiencies as coming from the son of his father" (Norton file, Papers of F. W. Kelsey, Kelsey Museum Archives, University of Michigan, Ann Arbor). On 29 July 1918, just four days before his death, Norton wrote Kelsey to comment on a museum directorship Kelsey had indicated might be a future possibility for Norton. At that time in wartime France, Norton naturally felt far from the museum world and out of touch - even though he says art dealers approach him constandy. This letter contains an explicit statement of Norton's view that museum trustees should not interfere with the director's right to decide what to purchase. As an example of what can go wrong when trustees interfere, he cites "the many hideous blunders" at the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston (Norton file, Papers of F. W. Kelsey, Kelsey Museum Archives, University of Michi- gan, Ann Arbor). The London Times obituary of Norton (5 August 1918) describes him as "caustic as a satirist," and his speech full of "pungent wit" and "spice"; yet he was also an "eminendy lovable character," "brave to a fault" and "tender as a woman" - with a rare "quality for self-devotion" and an "intense love of adventure.

GEFFCKEN Edwin R. Seligman of Columbia, visited Rome and mediated the purchase. Later, in 1903, Loeb gave the School a kylix (Harmon 354) bought at Rome. Had he been able to follow his own interests after Harvard, Loeb would have studied in Eu- rope and then returned to curatorial work at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston or teaching at an American university. But intense pressure from his father forced him to join the family firm, Kuhn, Loeb, and Company. Hard as he tried, Loeb found little satisfaction in the banking world, and as years passed, he became increasingly despondent, especially after his family and the firm strenuously opposed his desire to marry a New York gentile. He left Kuhn, Loeb in 1901 and went to Vienna for treatment with Sigmund Freud. After 1907, he lived deep in the woods near Murnau, not far from Munich, on an estate where he quietly built his collection of antiquities and rare books. In 1909-1910, he employed Herbert De Cou to work on his collection, probably on the advice of Richard Norton (see pp. 23-24). Although he founded the best-known series of translations from Greek and Latin texts, Loeb himself specialized in translating French scholarly monographs into English to make them more widely available to British and American readers. In 1909 he published his translation of Maurice Croisets Aristophanes and the Political Parties at Athens , in 1917 Philippe Le Grands The New Greek Comedy , and in 1931 Auguste Couaťs Alexandrian Poetry under the First Three Ptolemies. In 1930 his friends in America and Europe published a festschrift in his honor. Loeb died at Murnau on 29 May 1933 just as Nazism gathered terrible force in Germany. He had married Frau Hambuchen, a nurse who cared for him in his attacks of depression, and she died a short time later. Allison Vincent Armour73 Allison Armour was a noted yachtsman and a wealthy supporter of the early Classical School. Like James Loeb, he steadily backed Richard Norton s projects. Son of George Armour and Barbara Allison, he was born in Chicago on 18 March 1863. He graduated from Yale in 1884 and later lived in New York City. With his handsome yacht, the Utowana , he made eight voyages doing plant research for the U.S. Department of Agriculture and won the Meyer medal from the American Genetic Association for botanical exploration. The Armour family were loyal donors to the Classical School from the beginning. In the Schools first year, 1895, Allison s brother, George A. Armour, was a contributor, and in 1902 he became a member of the Schools Managing Committee. In 1901 Allison Armour was elected both a member of the Managing Committee and a trustee. Allison s financial backing was often crucial to the School: for instance, he made up the deficit in 1900-1901, and he paid Herbert De Cou s salary beginning in 1901-1902. In 1911, he was added to the American Academy Board of Trustees along with other leading figures from the Classical School Board, and he served until 1915, when his brother took over his seat. In World War I, he was a volunteer in Naval Intelligence. A close friend of Richard Norton, Allison Armour put his Utowana at Norton's disposal many times, especially for important Mediterranean voyages in 1904, 1909, and 1910. Sailing out of her Mediterranean home port of Malta, the Utowana transported all supplies for Norton s excava- tions at Cyrene. During the years of Norton s directorship at the Classical School, Armour gave 73 Sources: AAR Annual Report, 1912-1913 to 1920-1921; ASCSR Annual Report , 1895-1896 to 1911-1912; Dyson 1998 (Dyson [284] identifies Armour and his yacht as sym- bols of "fieldwork in the grand manner," a style of excavating Dyson believes [hopes?] long gone.

But Armour was much more than a skilled yachtsman and generous donor. Representing the Archaeological Institute of America on the Cyrene Excavation Committee, he supervised the finances of the Cyrene expeditions (to which his own funds were committed) and acted "as dip- lomat, agent, and lobbyist to the Sublime Porte and the officials of the Royal Ottoman Museum in Constantinople for American interest in Cyrenaica."74 Later, in October 1911, when Armour and Norton prepared to sail again from Malta to Cyrenaica for the 1911-1912 season, Armour became the pivotal decision maker in a difficult political situation. Italy had invaded Tripoli on 29 September 1911, and by 17 October the U.S. State Department refused to authorize a naval escort to ensure safe passage for the Utowana. Clearly, when confronted with Washington s disap- proval, Armour convinced the bitterly disappointed Norton that sailing for Cyrene was unsafe. But Armour did not cease to assist Norton. For instance, he took Norton on his yacht to Cyzicus right before World War I. Allison Armour lived until 6 March 1941. A widower since his young wifes death in 1890, he left a large legacy to his niece Barbara Armour Lowrie, who in 1918 married the Reverend Walter Lowrie, Fellow of the old Classical School (1895-1896, 1899-1900), active scholar, and longtime rector of St. Paul's American Church in Rome (1907-1930). Charles Densmore Curtis75 Densmore Curtis was one of the members of the old Classical School singled out by Richard Norton as especially promising. In the years before his death in 1925 he served the Academy as teacher, editor, and curator. His small, friendly, wryly amused face is familiar to all readers in the Academy Library who have observed the bronze bust between the last two window alcoves in the main reading room. Born at Augusta, Maine, on 17 October 1875, he graduated from Pomona College in 1900 and received the M.A. from the University of Colorado in 1901. At Colorado he doubtless knew Professor Fred Hellems, who had been a student at the Classical School in Rome in the School's first year and in Curtis 's time was on the faculty at the University of Colorado. In the fall of 1901 Curtis came to Rome, where he began the first of five years as a student in the Classical School. His special topic was arches, and in his second year he traveled to North Africa to see triumphal arches there. Toward the end of his five-year Roman residence, he spent time at the American School at Athens. Then, back in America, he studied at Columbia University from 1907 to 1909. Norton's support opened up special opportunities for Curtis. He, along with Van Buren, wąs chosen to go on the extended voyage Norton organized in 1904, to sail on Allison Armour's yacht from site to site in the eastern Mediterranean (fig. 3.5). In 1910-1911 Norton again selected him, this time as a member of the Cyrene excavation team; in this campaign Curtis was given responsi- bility for terracotta finds. 74 Uhlenbrock 1998, 100. 75 Sources: AAR Annual Report, 1913-1914 to 1924-1925, passim, esp. 1924-1925, p. 40 (Tenney Frank), 55 (Van Buren), and 74 (memorial minute of the Trustees of the Academy); ASCSR Annual Report, 1901-1902 to 1905-1906 and 1911-1912; A.

Charles Densmore Curtis in the whalehoat of the Utowana, 1904 (Van Buren Papers, Library of the American Academy; reproduction by Antonio Ortolan). In 1912 Curtis returned to Rome for a long stretch as Fellow in Archaeology (October 1912-3 1 December 1915). He thus participated in the years when the Classical School merged with the American Academy and moved to the new building on the Janiculum. Up to 1913 Curtis s work had ranged from his original topic, triumphal arches, to coins, to in- scriptions, to pozzolana , and to relations between Italic and imported Greek art. But then by chance he acquired a gold fibula said to come from the Cerveteri area,76 and thereafter he concentrated primarily on ancient jewelry. He eventually published the Bernardini and Barberini tombs as well as jewelry and gold work from Sardis. In 1916 Curtis became Lecturer in Archaeology at the Academy. Later, he was not only pro- moted to Associate Professor but appointed editor of the Academy's Memoirs and curator of the Academy's museum. Over the years he made many small gifts to the collection. His first donation, acquired in 1904 when traveling on the Utowana , was a pot brought up by sponge fishers at Loryma in Caria (Harmon no. 398, inv. no. 350), and his last was the bequest of what he thought was a late Roman portrait head.77 Accounts about Curtis written after his death praise his sound, sensible scholarship, his indomi- table courage and brave cheerfulness not only in his work at Rome but in extensive research travels, despite extremely grave physical handicaps of the spine and several bouts of disease. He died of bronchial pneumonia at age 49, on 7 June 1925, and is buried in the Protestant Cemetery in Rome. 76 Curtis 1914. 77 Published by Albizzati 1929, 406-412.

Written in a clear, neat hand, between 1905 and 1907, the "Harmon Catalogue" describes meticulously more than 500 objects. Furthermore, in his introduction and comments here and there, Harmon recorded valuable information on donors, on the sources of the collection given by Dr. Edmonston Charles, and on Richard Norton's travels. He undertook the inventory on Norton's suggestion, to make the objects more accessible for Fellows and students to consult and learn from. The marginal notes added in Norton's hand imply that he, Norton, approved Harmon's work. Harmon himself was the donor of several of the objects he described. Harmon was born in Brockport, New York, on 28 September 1878 and graduated at the top of his class from Williams in 1902; later, in 1927, Williams awarded him the L.H.D. He took his A.M. (1903) and Ph.D. (1908) at Yale, where he was University Fellow in Latin in 1903-1904. Like many American classicists of his time, he added German training to his American education, studying at Göttingen. From 1904 to 1907 he was a Fellow at the American School of Classical Studies in Rome; in his second year he held the fellowship of the AIA, and in his third was a Fel- low of the Carnegie Institution in archaeology. Returning to America in 1907, he spent the next nine years as a preceptor at Princeton. But in 1916 he moved back to Yale, where he became, first, Hillhouse Professor of Greek, then Lampson Professor of Greek. He was also Associate Fellow of Jonathan Edwards College and edited volumes 1 through 8 of Yale Classical Studies . He indeed enjoyed a national reputation: for two years he was vice-president of the American Philological Association and then president in 1939, and he was elected a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1945 he retired to his home on Chebeague Island, Maine, where he died suddenly on 29 June 1950. In his three years as a Fellow in Rome, Harmon worked on several other projects besides his inventory (and some extra duties cataloguing in the School Library). He studied red ware and black-figure kylikes, published a paper in Rheinisches Museum ,79 and analyzed clausulae in Am- mianus Marcellinus.80 As noted above, between 1913 and 1936 he produced volumes 1 through 5 of Lucian in the Loeb translations. In 1934 he branched out with a long study in a quite different field, "Egyptian Property- returns."81 Years after his "Harmon Catalogue" was finished, many en- tries were worked into his and Esther V. Hansen's "Greek Vases in the Museum of the American Academy in Rome."82 In a memorial minute E. T. Silk describes Austin Harmon as a serious "scholar's scholar,", a private man with a quiet sense of humor, as tall and athletic in build and hence sometimes intimidat- ing.83 In breaks from the classics, Harmon was avidly interested in golf, guns, and the sea. The sea had also been a part of his earlier life when he served in the Navy in World War I. 78 Sources: ASCSR AnnualReport, 1904-1905 to 1906-1907; Latimer 1994; Silk 1950; Who's Who in America , vol. 25 (1948-1949) 1043, s.v.

Albert William Van Buren: Curator ; and Elizabeth Douglas Van Buren 84 While Richard Norton was by nature adventurous and willing to test himself in dangerous endeavors, he selected, in contrast, brilliant but quiet, scholarly men for advancement - De Cou, Curtis, and Van Buren. Certainly, as a member of the 1904 cruise on the Utowana , Van Buren had the chance to develop a taste for exotic adventure, but instead he became a librarian, meticulous cataloguer, cura- tor, and steady teacher, first at the old Classical School, and then at the Academy. Also a dedicated scholar, he left behind a long bibliography. But most of all, he was a devoted caretaker and servant of the classics. When he died in Rome on 4 February 1968, just thirteen days short of his ninetieth birthday, the long continuity from the Norton days came to an end (fig. 3.6).

Van Buren 1930.</page><page sequence="56">THE HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION 41 remained all his life a devout churchman and for more than 50 years was a vestryman of St. Paul's American Church in Rome. The Van Buren family had first come to America in the 1630s from the Netherlands; Albert was interested in his genealogy, which included President Martin Van Buren as a distant cousin. His mother, Annie Maria Smith, descended from old New England stock. Born at Milford, Connecticut, on 17 February 1878, Van Buren graduated in 1896 from Phillips Academy, Andover, Massachusetts, the leading classics student of his year.85 At Yale, where he achieved a bril- liant record, he was awarded the A.B. in 1900 and then several scholarships for graduate work: Macy Fellowship (1900-1902), Clark Scholarship (1900-1901), and Berkeley Scholarship (1900-1902). Van Bürens long association with Rome began in autumn 1902, when he arrived at the old Clas- sical School as Fellow in Classical Archaeology. For the following two years (1903-1905) he stayed on at the School as Fellow of the Archaeological Institute of America. Still at the School in fall 1905, he was honored with a Carnegie Institution fellowship in archaeology. Van Buren accomplished such impressive work in Rome that reports from Norton enabled the chairman of the Managing Commit- tee, Andrew F. West, to praise him as "a thorough investigator" with "broad and diverse intellectual interests." By 1906 Van Buren had finished more than twelve projects, the "most brilliant" of which was, according to Chairman West, his work on the Temples of Castor and Concord.86 In 1906 Van Buren returned to America to teach at Yale, probably expecting to pursue the usual cursus honorum at his home campus. But after two years, in 1908, he was invited to return to Rome as the School's Librarian and Lecturer (sometimes called Instructor) in Archaeology. In 1911 he was promoted to Associate Professor of Archaeology, while remaining also Librarian. These two posts he continued to hold after the Classical School merged with the American Academy. As the new Academy building on the Janiculum neared completion, Van Buren worked with Gorham Phillips Stevens, in July 1914, on sorting ancient fragments for arrangement in the vestibule and Cortile. Stevens, Director of the old American Academy and after the merger Director of the School of Fine Arts, records in his diary many days in July and August spent arranging the frag- ments. On 24 July inscriptions and sculptural fragments were moved from the Classical School at Villa Bonghi to the new building (later, in August, Stevens supervised the transfer of sculpture from the Academy at Villa Mirafiori to the Janiculum building).87 Then, on 21 September 1914, began the big move from Villa Bonghi to the Janiculum, culminating in the transport of the Library over a three-day stretch at the end of the month. Van Buren managed much of this relocation because Director Jesse Benedict Carter had long since moved to the Villa Aurelia.88 On several occasions in this period, Van Buren wrote proudly of the Library, its development and future, publishing his Classification of the Library in 1915, a system basically in effect until 2014 (though modified over the years to suit the growing collection).89 In a brief interlude away from the upheaval and reorganization of the Classical School and the Academy, Van Buren married the British scholar Elizabeth Douglas on 19 August 1914. His letters 85 Van Buren 's Andover classmate Arthur S. Roberts com- mented on Van Buren's precocious classical achievements in a letter to "Mrs. Higgins," 11 June 1956, Van Buren Papers, Library, American Academy in Rome. 86 A. F.

The Villa Mirafiori was the count- ess's Roman villa, and it became the site of the American Academy from 1906 to 1914. 88 During World War I, Carter closed the Villa Aurelia and moved to the Villino Bellacci. He reports on the move from Villa Bonghi to the Janiculum in AAR Annual Report , 1914, p. 61. 89 For Van Buren's reports on the Library, see, for example, ASCSR Annual Report, 1911-1912, pp. 234-245 and AAR Annual Report, 1913-10 February 1914, pp. 66-71.</page><page sequence="57">42 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN Fig. 3.7. Albert W. Van Buren and Elizabeth Douglas Van Buren, photographed probably at Yale in 1913, when Van Buren completed his doctorate (Van Buren Papers, Library of the American Academy; reproduction by Antonio Ortolan ). to his wife written in summer 1915 show that she had urged him to focus on his research, to produce a book, and to be more assertive. The first step was to complete his doctorate, which his long stay in Rome had interrupted. The Academy granted him leave from 1 1 May to 10 July 1915, so that he and Mrs. Van Buren could sail to America. At Yale he celebrated his fifteenth class reunion, took his doctoral examinations (on Strabo and Vitruvius), and submitted his thesis (composed of four articles published over the previous ten years) (fig. 3.7). After many visits with Van Buren relatives, Mrs. Van Buren sailed to England, and he came back to catch up on Library ordering and answer the Director's mail (Jesse Benedict Carter, who especially suffered from summer heat, was at St. Moritz for most of the summer). In the fall Van Buren resumed his usual responsibilities, divided between administering the Library and conducting seminars and fieldtrips. When the United States entered World War I, all at the Academy dropped their normal work and took on volunteer war work. Van Buren became a translator at the American Embassy. In his scrupulous way, he turned over every lira earned on these translations to the Academy. He also reimbursed the Academy for time spent away on Red Cross work.90 The year 1924 brought new possibilities for the Van Bürens and also heart-rending disappoint- ment. In February 1924 Van Buren received a letter, dated 2 February, from Professor Edward Capps, the chairman of the Managing Committee of the American School of Classical Studies at Athens. Professor Capps asked if Van Buren were possibly interested in becoming the first librarian of the new Gennadeion Library at Athens. On 19 February Van Buren replied, declining the pos- sibility because of his wife's fragile health, his long association with the Classical School in Rome, and the Roman focus of his own research. On 12 March Capps wrote again asking Van Buren to 90 William A. Boring to Van Buren, 19 April 1913 and 14 May 1918; Andrew F. West to Van Buren, 21 June 1918; Van Buren to Captain Train, 14 October 1918, Van Buren Papers.</page><page sequence="58">THE HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION 43 reconsider and to see for himself, on his imminent, annual trip to Greece, what opportunities living and working at the ASCSA would actually provide. Mrs. Van Buren joined her husband and the Academy group for the trip, at least for the days in Athens, and the stay changed both her and her husband's views about the Gennadeion post. Back in Rome, Van Buren wrote Capps on 19 May that he would accept if a formal offer were made. In the meantime, to meet the offer expected from the ASCSA, the Academy Trustees had promoted Van Buren to Professor of Archaeology and had raised his annual compensation to $3,600. Back in 1916, Director Carter had won an increase in salary for Van Buren after asserting that despite long service, Van Buren "received . . . almost the smallest salary on our rolls and has absolutely no perquisites of any sort."91 In 1924 Van Buren must have felt that he was at last on the verge of possessing the tangible and intangible rewards he deserved. Successive letters in June 1924 between Van Buren and Capps and Professor T. Leslie Shear (who seems to have suggested Van Buren as a candidate for the Gennadeion post) show that, as Van Buren became more set on Athens, Capps thought Van Buren s financial terms beyond the Schools resources. In fact, Capps was moving toward appointing a younger, cheaper man. When the correspondence resumed after the Van Bürens' two months in France, England, and Germany, Van Buren's letters became urgent and pleading. In particular, he stresses his wife's need to leave Rome for a better climate. Athens in the spring of 1924 had had a "most beneficial effect" on her. For years she had been struggling against "the handicap of the climate and conditions in Rome."92 Clearly, Mrs. Van Buren had decided that the move to Athens must be accomplished. Furthermore, by this time she was working on Greek fictile revetments and would benefit from resources in Athens. On 5 November 1924, Van Buren wrote Shear that his wife's health depended on a change from Rome and that "living at the Gennadeion would have suited her perfectly." If the appointment has gone to someone else, "For us, it is a very great disappointment, in fact a tragedy." Blaming himself for taking too long to make up his mind, Van Buren states his willingness to come to Athens even at financial sacrifice. But it was not to be. Thus, the Van Bürens stayed on in Rome, with annual excursions to Greece (fig. 3.8), summer trips to England, and also voyages every few years to America, usually planned to coincide with Van Buren's Yale reunions. In Rome, for the first years of their marriage, they lived at Via Palestro 36, in the familiar neighborhood of the old Classical School. Here the stairs were extremely pain- ful for Mrs. Van Buren. Not later than summer 1927 they moved to an apartment they liked best of all their homes, at Via Lombardia 23 c, just off Via Veneto. Located in an elegant building and fashionable neighborhood, their apartment was convenient and within their means because it was on a mezzanine floor just one flight up - "directly over a cinema," as Nina Longobardi recalled (the Rivoli movie house is still there). When forced in 1951 to leave Via Lombardia, they began a disconsolate wandering, searching for a place warm enough for Mrs. Van Buren - first, to Via Lago di Lesina 39, inconveniently far out in the Via Nomentana section. Then, in 1954 they moved to Piazza di Porta Pia 121, next in 1956 to Via Calabria 7, and finally in 1960 to Via Monte Fiore 34, a block away from Piazza Sonnino in Trastevere. With them Uved two maids, whom Mrs. Van Buren trained rigorously and on whom she increasingly depended in later years. As shown in Director Carter's statement quoted above, housing at the Academy was never a perquisite of Van Buren's appointment, though in the last twenty years of his professorship he received a housing allowance. 91 Jesse Benedict Carter, cited in Valentine and Valentine 1973, 73. In 1920 Van Buren's salary was $2,000 a year. Since in 1916 Carter got for him a $1,000 increase, his salary up to then must have been $1,000 a year. In 1924 the Academy Trustees agreed to a salary of $3,000, a housing allowance of $600, and a pro rata annuity increase (Van Buren to William A. Boring, 22 May 1924, Van Buren Papers). 92 Van Buren to T. Leslie Shear, 15 September 1924, Van Buren Papers.</page><page sequence="59">44 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN Fig. 3.8. Professor Van huren, fourth from left, lecturing at the Theseum in Athens, late winter- early spring 1931 (Van Buren Papers, Library of the American Academy; reproduction by Antonio Ortolan). Perhaps, because their circle of Roman intellectual contacts was wide, the Van Bürens may in fact have preferred not to move to the Janiculum but rather to remain near the center of activity. Van Bürens failure to secure the Gennadeion librarianship deeply embarrassed him, especially since he had advised the Academy officers to expect his formal resignation. Then, less than a year later, Densmore Curtis 's death in June 1925 (see pp. 37-38) caused a shift in duties at the Academy. On 26 December 1925, Director Gorham Stevens asked Van Buren for his preference between the Librarianship and the Professorship of Archaeology. Van Buren chose the Professorship, retiring from the Librarianship on 30 September 1926 and picking up Curtis 's work as editor of publica- tions and curator of the "museum." These responsibilities he carried until his official retirement in 1946. Then, even though emeritus, Van Buren came to the Academy daily, especially to write his long series, "News Letter from Rome," which he initiated for the American Journal of Archaeology in 1926 and continued to compile until the year before his death. With only brief direct experience in field archaeology,93 Van Buren instead set himself to synthesize the work of others, to comment and communicate. Many who have known the Academy's Library since the 1950s remember "VB" - tall, shuffling a little, extremely thin and pale - sitting at the first table on the left in the Periodical Room doggedly tapping away on his ancient typewriter (in the words of Professor Silvio Panciera, on his macchina antediluviana). 94 This Van Buren, in his last twenty years, was a man much affected not only by his wife's poor health but also by his own malnutrition in World War II. When Italy entered the war allied with Germany, he and Mrs. Van Buren, a British citizen by birth and American by marriage, decided to remain in their Roman home. Besides reluctance to leave familiar surroundings, duty kept Van Buren in Rome because he was appointed juridical custodian of the Academy Library and "museum." And perhaps the Van Bürens thought the experience would be like their life in World War I, but then Italy had been on the Allied side. Now in World War II, the Van Bürens, as citizens of enemy countries, could not qualify for ration stamps, and they had little money. In those years, 93 Van Buren spent the latter half of May 1914 excavating on Malta with Thomas Ashby and the British School at Rome (AAR Annual Report, February-December 1914, p. 55). 94 Silvio Panciera, in his remarks about the Library, at the reception to honor Lucilla Marino on her retirement as Academy Librarian, July 1992.</page><page sequence="60">THE HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION 45 recalled Nina Longobardi, Mrs. Van Buren often sent "VB" off without any lunch or any money. And he walked to the Academy from their apartment on Via Lombardia. As Frank Brown wrote, Van Buren was "An unforgettable symbol of quiet but unbending resistance to barbarism, as he daily made his courteous way on foot across the city."95 The isolation and severe deprivation of the war years enhanced the value of small things. There were then both vegetable gardens and chickens in the Academy orto , and " VB" would collect greens and tour the henhouses looking for eggs. If he found two eggs, he would suck one and take the other home to his wife. If he found only one, he took it home to his beloved "'Lizbet." To keep "VB" from total collapse, the Librarian at that time, Colonel de Daehn, and Mme de Daehn would invite him, at intervals, to their own modest pranzo. Another savior in those dark years was Myron C. Taylor, President Roosevelt's personal representative to the Vatican who functioned as a conduit of help to stranded Americans and friends of the Allies. When in 1944 Mrs. Van Buren suffered a serious leg fracture in an accident, Taylor paid her bill at the famous Bastianeiii Clinic, 11,541 lire, a sizable sum at that time.96 As mail began to flow after the Allied victory, Van Buren wrote urgent requests to the Academy's New York office and to the Yale Alumni Association begging for "Care" packages, especially because his wife's dietary needs were special and her malnutrition extremely serious. The items he requested were basic - flour, sugar, baking soda, and coffee. Only Van Buren 's great absorption in his work sustained him through this devastating period. In those war years when there were no Fellows and the Academy was almost deserted, Van Buren set himself to bring the "museum" inventory up to date and to prepare unpublished mate- rial for future volumes of MAAR. There had previously appeared more than a dozen publications of museum items, nearly all the result of Fellows' work under Van Buren 's close guidance; MAAR volumes 7 (1929) through 17 (1940) contain most of these papers. Now in wartime as Van Buren took up his solitary station in the "museum" room, he meticulously inventoried thousands of objects - the Ashby donation of 1924 (see p. 59), the Van Deman bequest (see pp. 62-66), and Hoppin's gift of the endless Mancini residuum (see p. 29). On 27 August 1946, he reached inventory number 8725. One cannot but wonder what he thought or felt when a large part of these objects was discarded in the 1948 sistemazione (see Richardson, pp. 79-82). Van Buren also prepared for publication three projected volumes of the MAAR that never appeared: pottery (including material from Harmon's 1907 catalogue and chapters partly or wholly written by Miriam Friedman Drabkin or Howard Comfort), lamps (including Ethel Chubb 's paper on lamps acquired in 1916 from the dealer Scalco), and the Ashby collection (except for the brick stamps, which he set aside for Herbert Bloch). Later, in 1949, Van Buren published eight objects selected from these manuscripts,97 and in 1956 Howard Comfort's chapter on terra sigillata ap- peared.98 The other materials remain unpublished and are largely superseded by the present volume. 95 Brown 1969-1970, 32. Nina Longobardi, who always felt pity for "poor VB," recalled that he became a skeleton. In a letter dated 6 (16?) October 1946, to the Mistress of Girton College, Mrs. Van Buren wrote, "If you should again visit Rome you would see many sad changes, but international intellectual life is beginning slowly to revive, and promises to make a more rapid advance during the coming winter. But the innumerable difficulties and privations which we still have to endure, lack of transport, intermittent lack of electricity, lack of heating, etc. make the resumption of many cultural activities almost impossible, not to mention that most people are enfeebled by the lack of proper nourishment and the daily struggle for existence." This sense of deprivation must have remained with Mrs. Van Buren because Mrs. Longobardi said Van Buren even in later, better times had only 100 lire from his wife for his lunch at the modest Porta San Pancrazio trattoria. 96 Myron C.

GEFFCKEN In addition to making the Academy's collection of antiquities known to scholars through publi- cation, Van Buren believed the objects could be more valuable tools if arranged in a more spacious and better lit location than the gallery just off the Cortile (see pp. 21, 69-72, on the "museum"). In April 1937 a studio upstairs, later known as "the Cosa Room" (now studio 249), became the "mu- seum." A photograph in the AAR Annual Report for 1936-1937 (facing p. 44) shows the collection set out in the handsome cabinets, until recently in the Mellon Professor's Office, and arranged on open shelves and tables, available for close study by the Fellows (fig. 3.17). Then, right after the war in 1946, Van Buren had a number of items restored, and he also assembled small pieces illustrating ancient daily life in an "antiquarium," with a catalogue to record the objects and their donors. As he neared retirement, he meant to leave the "museum" in clear order for future scholars. Himself a modest donor to the collection, Van Buren began early to give small acquisitions. For instance, in his first fall in Rome (1902) he donated a jar cover from Veii (Harmon no. 86). In spring 1904 Norton had chosen him and Densmore Curtis from the School Fellows and students for the cruise on Armour's yacht (see pp. 30-33). At Side he joined in the antiquities' buying eloquendy described by fellow passenger Hogarth (see pp. 30-33) and acquired a head from a relief (Harmon no. 14) for the collection. In his litde 1905-1906 inventory of inscriptions in the School collection, he records purchasing, in November 1904, CIL XIV, 3198 from Widow Bernardini at Palestrina. In 1905 while on the School trip to Greece he acquired stone whorls (Harmon nos. 74-80) and the head of a terracotta figurine (Harmon no. 88) at Mycenae. In addition, many other small gifts came from Van Buren 's trips around Italy." For his work in numismatics and on his coin collection, mosdy assembled on the School trips he led to Greece, see below, p. 54. Actively engaged in research for over 60 years, Van Buren compiled an immense record of publication. In "a select bibliography" of Van Buren 's work, Professor Brown lists 92 tides. He ranged widely, writing on inscriptions, on Ostia, on the aqueducts of the Janiculum, and especially on Pompeii. He achieved so much early success in publication that the rejection of his manuscript on Strabo, first by the Yale University Press and then by the Clarendon Press of Oxford, brought much disappointment. With many volumes planned, Van Buren had completed, by 1917, his translations of Strabo's sections on Latium and accompanying commentary. But in 1919 he learned that Clarendon would consider only a fundamentally recast, less detailed volume on Strabo. Whether Van Buren attempted such a revision is not documented. Nevertheless, some material from the Strabo project appears in the series of handbooks he compiled for his students at the Academy, to help them prepare for fieldtrips. For instance, his A Bibliographical Guide to Latium and Southern Etruria went through five editions, from 1916 to 1953. For his scholarly contributions, he was honored with election to the German Archaeological Institute and the Pontificia Accademia Romana di Archeologia, as well as by citations and memberships in several societies in England and others in Italy. Van Buren 's characteristics as a teacher are delineated in many tributes and in letters thanking him for his instruction on field excursions. Frank Brown, one of those Fellows who learned the sites from Van Buren, wrote, "These [Fellows and students], year after year, followed him about Rome and Latium, to Campania and to Greece, imbibing understanding and love of ancient Italy " Many antiquities acquired by Van Buren in his fellowship years in Rome (1902-1906) are now property of the Depart- ment of Classics, Smith College. Van Buren took them home with him to Yale in 1906 and, on his departure again for Rome in 1908, left them on deposit in Phelps Hall at Yale. In May 1925 he sold them for $100 to Professor F. Warren Wright of Smith; in November 1925 Wright and a colleague removed them from Yale to Smith (copy of quit-claim, May 1925, and letter from Professor Wright to Van Buren, 6 December 1925, Van Buren Papers). I thank Professor Charles Henderson for bringing this collection to my attention and Professor Scott Bradbury of Smith for sending me photocopies of several pages from the inventory, written in Van Buren's hand in June 1908. 1 note on these copies inscriptions and a pitcher from Rome, and several objects acquired on the Norton-Armour cruise in 1904.</page><page sequence="62">THE HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION 47 Fig. 3.9.

The appreciation expressed to Van Buren for his academic generosity and genuine kind- ness, in many letters from members of his groups, meant much to him, as shown by his marking the specific sentences. A revealing and balanced assessment of Van Buren came from Professor i R. S. Broughton, in a letter to Katherine Geffcken dated 30 April 1989. In autumn 1927 Broughton was a student at the Academy: Van Buren as Professor, led us on all excursions, and if you listened carefully, was a wonderful fount of information about everything. The annoying thing was the flat, monotonous tone with never anything to indicate that one piece of information was more important than another. But I remember him with respect and liking. As clearly suggested in the assessments above, Van Buren was learned, dedicated, modest, unselfish, and kind. In 1938, Professor E. K. Rand of Harvard commented on Van Buren 's 100 Brown 1969-1970,31.</page><page sequence="63">48 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN "industry and unremitting self-sacrifice."101 He had a profound sense of duty and noblesse oblige. For instance, on 14 May 1918, he wrote to the Academy treasurer, William Boring, instructing that one-quarter of his small monthly check be put into his widowed mother s bank account. Despite Italian inflation that eroded his income, he remembered many American relatives with Christmas checks, and he gave to St. Pauls Church in Rome and to the Yale Alumni Associa- tion. He declined payment for an article in Paulys Realenzyklopädie because it was a "privilege" to contribute.102 His only indulgence was the purchase of an occasional ancient coin or book or print. As his personal archive shows, he corresponded widely with scholars in Italy, America, and elsewhere in Europe, especially in England. To his close friends, he was "Van" or "VB," to his mother "My Precious Treasure," and to his wife "Bert." To Jesse Benedict Carter, whom he had known at least since 1904 and remembered afterward as "my revered director," he was "very dear Albert" and "my dear boy."103 One gets the impression from letters that Van Buren and Gorham Stevens, who succeeded Carter as Director, were on cordial and collégial terms but not so close as Van Buren and Carter had been, probably because friction marred the relationship between Carter and Stevens. All these friends, colleagues, and relatives Van Buren served unreservedly, but no one was more the recipient of his devotion than his wife. Elizabeth Mary Douglas Van Buren (fig. 3.10) was born at London in her grandmothers house in Linden Gardens on 18 October 1881 104 and died, after many periods of ill health, in Rome on 5 September 1961, six and a half years before her husbands death. According to Nina Longobardi, Professor Van Buren worked with single-minded determination to secure his wifes interment in the Parte Antica of the Protestant Cemetery near Keats s grave; he said, "My wife is not an ordinary person." He succeeded in persuading the cemetery authorities, and in 1968 he was buried there beside her. Mrs. Longobardi's recollection demonstrates Elizabeth Van Buren s power over her husband. A forceful personality, she controlled much of their extremely frugal life. She possessed funds of her own in a London trust105 and like Professor Van Buren had her own account at Sebasti and Reali, the Academy's bankers in Piazza di Spagna. At least in the first year of their marriage, she must have had the readier cash as she paid for her husband's return ticket to Italy from America in summer 1915; her wedding gift to him also meant an outlay - a piano, on which he endlessly 101 Rand to Van Buren, 16 October 1938, Van Buren Papers. 102 Van Buren to Dr. K. Ziegler, 2 March 1953, Van Buren Papers. 103 In the preface (dated January 1919) of his unpublished manuscript on Strabo, Van Buren wrote, "As I send forth this volume to the world, it is a source of grief to me that two persons to whom I should have wished to present these fruits of my labours, and whose approbation I should have cherished, are no longer alive: my dear father in America, and my revered director in Rome, Professor Jesse Benedict Carter. They were gathered to their rest within a few days of each other, in July 1917, each having given the last of his strength for the defense of our ideals. To the inspiration which came from them this book owes much" (p. 14). Seven days before Carter died, he wrote Van Buren a letter of sym- pathy (13 July 1917, Van Buren Papers) on the recent death of Bishop Van Buren ("My very dear Albert" and "my dear boy"). On 20 July Carter collapsed and died of sunstroke at Cervignano, where he had gone on Red Cross business. Carter was just six years older than Van Buren but a man of entirely different personality (exuberant, flamboyant, charming, and restless). 104 Both 1881 and 1882 are given as the year of Mrs. Van Bu- ren's birth. The date used at the Protestant Cemetery, where she is buried, is 1881. Her obituary in the London Times, 15 September 1961, p. 16, gives 1882. The biographical questionnaire she made out for Girton College shows 1881 with a 2 written above the 1.

He enjoyed looking up things for her in the Library, often begging her to use his bibliographical skills.108 Many years later, their correspondents commented on the close partnership of their marriage.109 In the international scholarly community in Rome, Mrs. Van Buren was regarded as cultivated, witty, and an interesting conversationalist. Many friends later recalled her intellectual and social talents at the Sunday afternoon teas the Van Bürens regularly gave at their flat (giving teas, instead of dinners, was probably a shrewd use of their modest budget). In a letter dated 7 April 1952, Professor Marbury Ogle reminisced to Van Buren, "We could picture you and Mrs. Van Buren in your cozy sitting-room [on Via Lombardia] and in memory partake again of her delicious goodies and tea, and rub elbows with the many scholars who used to gather there."110 And three years later, Professor A. W. Byvanck of Leiden commented, "You and Mrs. Van Buren made your house to be a private Academy of Science."111 Mrs. Van Buren 's strengths of character and personality contrasted with her small, delicate build. In later years, she became startlingly thin and frail. Her health problems dominated even their first 106 Letters from Van Buren to Elizabeth, summer 1915, Van Buren Papers. 107 Van Buren to Elizabeth, 8 August 1915, Van Buren Papers. 108 Note, for example, Van Buren to Elizabeth, 3 August 1915, Van Buren Papers. 109 For example, letter to Van Buren from H.

GEFFCKEN year of marriage, when a painful hip condition made all exercise difficult. On voyages she suffered dreadful seasickness and found train travel exhausting. She easily caught "chills" and in 1925 had a tonsillectomy to reduce infections. The deprivations of World War II so seriously weakened her that when she incurred a series of accidents, recovery was only partial - first, her badly broken leg in 1944, then a further fall in 1950 requiring another cast, in 1953 a serious illness not specified in the correspondence, in 1959 acute inflammatory arthritis, and in 1960 a broken arm. Partially immobile by 1951, she could not travel and was denied the "refreshment" of the English summers she and Van Buren had enjoyed (he continued to go to England each summer).112 Correspondents comment on Mrs. Van Buren s pluck, on her bravery, and on the strength of mind and will she showed in continuing her research. In Professor Van Buren, her ill health aroused strong protective emotions. He promises again and again to make her life easier, apologizing many times, in summer 1915, for the difficulties of her first year of marriage - for the steep stairs, for the packages she carried to set up and equip the apartment, for the inexperienced maids she had to train, and for the trauma everyone suffered in the earthquake of 13 January 1915. To outsiders she may have presented a brave face; to him she sent letters fully describing her discomforts, which induced in him anxiety and even helpless guilt.113 But he tried to cheer her, hoping that doctors would eventually make the right diagnosis. In the meantime, he encouraged her to eat and build her strength. In the letter he sent for her to read on their first wedding anniversary, he wrote, "You say that you give me so much trouble but you have been an inspiration - some one to live for . . . brave and patient." Many details of Mrs. Van Buren s early life remain elusive. In a biographical questionnaire she made out for Girton College in 1946, she lists her parents as John Archibald Douglas and Mary Anne McLachlan; as her father s profession she wrote "gentleman." Nina Longobardi often mentioned that Mrs. Van Buren was connected with the Scottish peerage, and the Douglas coat of arms on her inscription in the Protestant Cemetery probably supports this assertion.114 A memoir in the Van Buren papers, apparently by Mrs. Van Buren, describes a childhood divided between her father 's farm and her grandmother 's large house in London. Following his return to England from sheep farming in New Zealand, her father bought or rented a farm. Her mother she remembered dressed in a beautiful evening gown of thick silk. Later, as we learn from the correspondence in the Van Buren papers, many heirlooms from Elizabeth Douglas s family were shipped to Italy from England, in the first year of her marriage. But sadly they were lost at sea - miniatures, jewelry, and the silver she inherited - a distressing loss that payment from Lloyds could not really replace. Van Buren does not say, in his references to Lloyds, whether this incident was caused by naval action in the first year of World War I. The writer of the memoir, presumably Mrs. Van Buren, states that she never went to school but was entirely tutored at home, an assertion confirmed by information on the 1946 Girton question- naire. Her preparation must have been extensive, however, because once in Rome, she studied at 112 In many letters from Mrs. Elsie Poynter (filed in the Van Buren Papers), there are comments on Mrs. Van Buren 's health. For "the refreshment [of going to London] is denied to Elizabeth," see letter dated 8 December 1955. Van Buren continued the traditional summer trip to England, to see professional friends (for example, Hugh Last) and to visit the bankers who held Mrs. Van Bürens funds. He stayed at his London club, the Curzon. 113 See letters of summer 1915 and also, for instance, a post- card dated 17 August 1920, Van Buren Papers. 114 The inscription with the Douglas coat of arms in the Protestant Cemetery was designed by the Director of the Academy Richard Kimball, using the arms in a "Douglas book" lent to him by Van Buren (letter from Kimball to Van Buren, 11 May 1962, Van Buren Papers). In summer 1995 I searched without success for this book wherever in Academy property (main building, apartments) I could find remnants of the Van Bürens' personal library.</page><page sequence="66">THE HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION 5 1 the University, and from 1909 to 1911 she was a member of the British School at Rome. She spent 191 1-1912 back in England, as an advanced student at Girton College, Cambridge. At this time she published her first article.115 She was readmitted to the British School at Rome for 1912. During Elizabeth Douglas s association with the British School, Thomas Ashby and Eugenie Sellers Strong presided over the School (see pp .58-62 [Ashby]). In fact, in the same year, 1909, Mrs. Strong arrived at the School as Assistant Director and Miss Douglas began there as a student. Whether they knew each other before 1909, for example in London, is not yet known. Perhaps Mrs. Strong's Girton background convinced Miss Douglas to study at her mentor's Cambridge college. In any case, Mrs. Strong's influence and sponsorship are evident in Miss Douglas's early work. For instance, both women published articles on architectural terracotta decoration in the 1914 volume of the Journal of Roman Studies. Mrs. Strong, whose article comes first, refers forward, in a footnote, to Mrs. Van Buren 's essay that follows immediately, and both women argue that terracotta decora- tion deserves proper study and full publication.116 Over the next 30 years, Mrs. Strong's notes to Professor Van Buren, carefully retained in his papers, invariably end with affectionate greetings to his wife. Three years after Mrs. Strong's death (16 September 1943), Mrs. Van Buren commented, "Mrs. Strong is, and will be greatly missed in Roman intellectual circles; at her house one always met all the most interesting visitors to Rome, and heard all the latest archaeological news discussed."117 The Van Bürens no doubt originally met in just such archaeological gatherings in Rome, when Mrs. Strong presided over the social life of the British School at Palazzo Odescalchi. In establishing a comfortable setting for scholarly conversation at their Sunday afternoon teas, the Van Bürens may have modesdy emulated Mrs. Strong's famous salon.118 Over the years, Mrs. Van Buren became an extremely productive scholar, clearly encouraged by her husband. In fact, Mrs. Longobardi reported that Professor Van Buren stood so much in awe of his wife's abilities that he even appeared to fear her. With inexperienced young scholars, she could be modest about her work but curt.119 Up to 1926, study of terracotta ornamentation mainly absorbed her attention. Her early article on "Juno Sospita of Lanuvium"120 shows her skill in clear descrip- tion, in synthesis of literary and archaeological sources, and also her concern with iconography. In summer 1915, except for the weeks she spent in a London nursing home for treatment of her hip, 115 Douglas 1912. 116 Strong 1914; E. D. Van Buren 1914. 117 Quoted from E. D. Van Buren s letter to the mistress of Girton College, dated 6 (16?) October 1946 (Archives, Girton College). The letter continues remarking on Mrs. Strong's fortitude in her last years: "She continued to work almost to the very end, even when she was so crippled that she could move only with the greatest pain and difficulty." Mrs. Strong suffered from excruciating arthritis; Mrs. Van Buren could have been describing herself. On Mrs. Strong's last days, see Thomson 1949, 1 18-121; Dyson 2004, 192-194: she died after a week in Clinica Polidori, brought there from Hotel Regina on Via Veneto, where she had lived for two years during the war. But for many years previously, after departure from the British School in 1925, Mrs. Strong lived in a flat on the Viminal, in Via Balbo. There she had continued to assemble international guests at her famous Saturday salons. Her enthusiastic support of Mussolini has made her a complex figure to assess today. For Stephen Dy- son's balanced assessment in his biography of Mrs. Strong, see Dyson 2004, 179-194. 118 Nina Longobardi, in commenting on Mrs. Van Buren, always stressed her gift for intellectual conversation. In the unsigned memoir in the Van Buren Papers, the writer, pre- sumably Mrs. Van Buren, describes herself as "totally devoid of the maternal instinct." 119 In his letter of 30 April 1989, Professor Broughton re- counts an interesting reaction from Mrs. Van Buren. In fall 1927, his assignment on an Academy fieldtrip to the Villa Giulia was to point out the revetments from the old Latin temples according to stylistic dating. He says, "You will get the measure of my initial ignorance when ... in my innocence I asked Mrs. Van Buren for the name of a good treatise and got a strangely modest yet annoyed reaction! " In 1921 Mrs. Van Buren had published a definitive work, Figurative Ter- racotta Revetments in Etruria and Latium' 120 Douglas 1913; it is interesting to note that Professor Van Buren had two articles in the same volume.</page><page sequence="67">52 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN Mrs. Van Buren worked with Mrs. Strong at the British Museum on a project of the British School at Rome. Since 1909 the British School had been preparing a catalogue of sculptures in the Palazzo dei Conservatori at Rome. When the catalogue finally appeared in 1926, the editor, H. Stuart Jones, described Mrs. Van Buren s contributions, in his preface: During the earlier months of the war a student of the School, Miss Elizabeth Douglas (now Mrs. A. W. Van Buren), undertook to describe the minor objects of the collection, chiefly the small bronzes and terra-cottas. In order to identify the provenance of the objects described, Miss Douglas carefully studied the series of reports of excavations contained in the volumes of the Bullettino Comunale which enabled her incidentally to supplement in many instances the descriptions written by others. It was also during the war that Mrs. Arthur Strong devoted part of her time to the arrangement of the illustrations.121 Mrs. Van Buren 's entries in this catalogue demonstrate her capacity for strong, concise description. This work and the articles she published up to the early 1920s paved the way for her three mono- graphs on revetments (1921, 1923, and 1926). 122 In her third monograph, Mrs. Van Buren had moved from terracotta decoration in Italy and Magna Grecia east to Greek revetments in the Archaic period, and as early as 1924 she turned her attention even more eastward toward Babylonia and Assyria. This new field was suggested to her by Professor Albert T. Clay, who was the curator of Yale's Babylonian collection. In a letter to Professor T. Leslie Shear of Princeton (5 November 1924), Professor Van Buren explains that he and his wife hope to be in the United States in late May and June 1925 "so that my wife can study the Mesopotamian terra-cottas in Philadelphia and New Haven, as well as confer with Professor Clay, who recommended this work to her." In the preface to her first major study in this field, pub- lished in 1930 by Yale University Press, she gratefully recalls the help she received from the staff of the Babylonian Collection. They provided valuable assistance as she "ventur[ed] into a new and almost uncharted field of studies."123 In addition, she acknowledges much guidance and support from Professor Michael Rostovtzeff of Yale. Professor Van Buren, with his Yale connections, was clearly the enabling link between his wife and her American supporters. In her Near Eastern studies, Mrs. Van Buren concentrated especially on Mesopotamian figu- rines and cylinder seals, in particular on their iconography. In Rome, she often consulted Father Alfred Pohl SJ, dean of the Oriental Faculty and editor of Orientalia and Analecta Orientalia at the Pontifical Biblical Institute. Her floruit in Near Eastern research coincided closely with Pohls impressive tenure at the "Biblicum" (1930-1961), for he died about seven weeks after her death. But between her visits to the "Biblicum" Mrs. Van Buren appeared at the Academy Library about once a week, as long as she was physically able to move about. In an obituary of Mrs. Van Buren, Edith Porada praises her remarkable energy, perseverance, insight, and gift for graceful writing, and lists 66 publications in Near Eastern studies, and 18 in Greek, Etruscan, and Roman archaeology. And this list does not include reviews. Though not a field archaeologist, Mrs. Van Buren knew how to convey complex excavation findings in clear form. Another obituary comments on her "valuable . . . contributions on the progress of the excavations at Warka, for she followed the results of successive expeditions with close interest, and had a gift for disentangling archaeological detail."124 121 Stuart Jones 1926, v-vi. 122 E.

In 1959 she pub- lished her last projects, and in August she presented her archaeological collection to the Academy. With a rather jerky but still clear hand, Professor Van Buren entered the objects, numbers 8734-8813 at the end of his second inventory book, the last sizable donation to the Academy's collection of antiquities. As might be expected, terracottas dominate the donation - antefixes, heads, and revet- ments. The group includes a gift from Lanciani of a small votive altar (ca. 1920: inv. no. 8772) and several pieces Mrs. Van Buren had published. Professor Van Buren also added a bronze statuette he bought at Norba in his first Roman year.125 Toward the end of his life, Van Buren apparently decided to remove his and his wife's donations from the Academy and transfer them to the British School at Rome. His papers contain a letter dated 10 March 1966 from Frank Brown, then Director of the Academy, acknowledging two letters from Van Buren. In a letter not yet located in Academy files (1 January 1966), Van Buren informed Professor Brown of his intention, and Brown replies, "Although I shall regret to see the remarkable pieces from your and Mrs. Van Buren 's collection leave the Academy, I am sure that the trustees will agree with your wishes in the matter. Unless you see some need of haste, I shall take the matter up with John Ward Perkins [then Director of the British School] upon his return from America." Such a transfer seems not to have been carried out, in the end. Until Van Buren 's letter of 1 January and his reply of 13 March 1966 (noted in pencil on Brown's letter) are found, one can only speculate on Van Buren 's reasons. On 21 June 1962, the Academy awarded Professor Van Buren its gold medal for almost 60 years of service to the Classical School. Professor Brown read the citation. Sadly, Mrs. Van Buren did not live to attend the ceremony, and regrettably Van Buren 's remarks on that occasion, about his early days in Rome, were not recorded.126 At his death, in accordance with his will drawn up after Mrs. Van Buren 's death, he left his possessions in Rome to the Academy and his residual estate divided equally between Yale and the Academy. With this generous bequest, Van Buren gave back to the Academy far more in funds than the total of all his lifetime earnings.127 As I finished this profile of the Van Burens, I felt still the need for a direct personal memory of this couple. I decided to ask Ingrid Edlund-Berry to pose some questions to Lucy Shoe Meriti FAAR 1937, 1950, who retained vivid recollections of her fellowship time at the Academy. In particular I wanted to know what visiting the Van Burens in their home was like and what sort of people they were in the 1930s. On 6 September 1995, Professor Edlund-Berry sent me the following summary of Lucy Meritt's remarks: Yes, she remembers the Van Buren apartment very well. It was well furnished, a bit crowded, with chairs and sofas to accommodate groups of people. The Van Bürens invited groups of Academy fellows, students who stayed at the Pensione Fersen, and Italian archaeologists to tea. Everyone sat around an open place in the center. Mr. Van Buren served the tea and food (Lucy can't remember what was served, but the refreshments were ample), while Mrs. Van B. presided like a duchess. There was no conversation until the food had been distributed and the ritual of tea performed. Afterwards they talked about archaeology, new discoveries, gossip, art, exhibitions in Rome, etc. Mr. Van Buren was always overshadowed by his wife; he adored her, but acted more like a servant/butler at home and waited on her hand and foot. Mrs. Van B. was very gracious and reserved, but not haughty. She had "presence", and was always courted by 125 A. W. Van Buren 1906d. This is no. 8776 in the inven- tory ledger. 126 AAR Report, 1959-1964, p. 38. 127 The AAR received from Van Buren 's estate $177,244.26 (AAR Annual Report, 1968-1973, p. 152).</page><page sequence="69">54 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN Italian scholars at various gatherings at the Villa Aurelia or at the concerts in the Augusteo [the concert hall installed in the Mausoleum of Augustus was known as the Augusteo]. Mrs. Van B. gave the air of not lacking funds, which could explain the elegant location of the apartment. As an example of Mrs. Van B.'s formality and dignity Lucy described the event of Carl Biegen 's first report on Troy at the Academy. The dining room was filled with scholars and fellows, all seated on wooden folding chairs. The lecture went on and on, for at least 1-1/2 hours, and at the end Mrs. Van B. said "most interesting, if only the chairs were a litde less uncompromising." Lucy's evaluation of Mr. Van B. is that he was not sufficiendy appreciated. He was retiring, had an apologetic manner and voice. His speech was archaic, he was extremely polite and very knowledgeable, but not very "exciting" (in sharp contrast to Henry Rowell who came to the Academy as director of the Summer School in 1937). Mr. Van B. was very low key, and his own real excitement came through very subdy. Lucy listened and learned, but others had less patience with him. He loved Greece and enjoyed the Academy trips to Greece. There he showed more joyousness and freedom, and he was considerably more outgoing. Mrs. Van B. did not accompany him on these trips. His standard question on all fieldtrips was "Did the ladies have their rubbers?" Arthur Lincoln Frothingham , Jr.128 The Academy's collection today contains few of Frothingham 's antiquities, but he himself was a significant enough figure in the history of the Classical School to justify inclusion here. Son of wealthy New Englanders, Arthur Lincoln Frothingham and Jessie Peabody, Arthur Jr. was born at Boston on 21 June 1859 but grew up in Rome. Following his school preparation, he attended the University in Rome until 1881, and then he went on to the University of Leipzig, from which he received the doctorate in 1883. He first concentrated on philology, including Semitic languages, but then later in his career shifted into art and archaeology. His education gave Frothingham not only intimate familiarity with Italian language and culture but also a wide circle of contacts in Rome and Germany. After his return to America in 1882, he continued to sail in summer back to Italy, and he naturally emerged as an important early planner of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome. In his first appointment in America, as Fellow in Semitic Languages and Lecturer in Archaeology at the John Hopkins University from 1882 to 1886, Frothingham showed his characteristic energy. He became secretary of the AIA in 1884 and founded the American Journal of Archaeology (AJA). While still at Hopkins, he gave visiting lectures at Princeton. On the initiative of Allan Marquand, a Princeton alumnus and founding member of the field of art history at Princeton, Frothingham was appointed at Princeton in 1886 on a salary paid from the Marquand Professorship Fund. As Frothingham was not a regular member of the Princeton faculty, his position depended upon the favor of his colleague Marquand, who administered the family's fund at Princeton. With his rest- less innovation and wide-ranging fields, Frothingham soon irritated Marquand, and in 1898, after Marquand refused to pay the salary any longer, Frothingham was transferred to a normal faculty 128 Sources: Barnabei 1991, 435, 451, 463, 464, 471, 476, 478; Congresso 1912, 11, 23, 93-94; ASCSR Annual Re- port, 1895-1896 and 1896-1897; Archaeological Institute of America (AIA) Archives, Boston University; AIA An- nual Report 8 (1886-1887) 40-47; AIA Annual Report 10 (1888-1889) 91; De Puma 1986, 1-7 ; Dictionary of American Biography 4 (1931-1932) 42-43 (W.

On 27 January 1897, he had married Helen Bulkley Post, who died in 1921. Two years later, he died on 28 July 1923, just a few weeks past his sixty-fourth birthday.130 With his knowledge of Italy and his leadership in the AIA, Frothingham was a logical member of groups working for the foundation of a Classical School in Rome. From May 1894 to May 1895 he served on both the first and second committees that brought forward proposals for the Classical School to be sponsored by the AIA. As inauguration of the School drew near, he was elected Sec- retary of its Managing Committee, and then Associate Director for the School's first year in Rome (1895-1896). In June 1895, as the opening approached, correspondence between Frothingham and the School's first Director, William Gardner Hale (previously, member of the second planning committee and first Chairman of the Managing Committee) reveals a not always harmonious debate about the School's name and scope. Hale interpreted "Classical Studies" in the broadest terms, but Frothingham suspected the philologists of wanting to relegate archaeology to secondary status "as a handmaid." In response to Frothingham 's contentiousness, Hale warned him against too ardent stances and against judgment and methods less considerate than wise.131 Frothingham's report on his year as Associate Director is characteristically crammed with activi- ties. He yearned to excavate. But since Felice Barnabei, Secretary (1875-1895) and then Director General (1896-1900) of the Italian Antichità e Belle Arti, opposed granting permits to foreign institutions, Frothingham had to content himself with field surveys. In fact, excavation by Americans in Italy had a nasty history in the 1880s. In the winter of 1886-1887 the AIA sponsored exploration at the sanctuary of Hera Lacinia near Croton, assured of permission by the owner of the land under local law and custom. But authorities from Rome inter- vened, terminated the excavations, and caused the finds to be reburied. Outraged protest from the Americans followed, including comments from Frothingham as editor of AJA. Then, on 3 1 January 1890, the Italian ambassador at Washington reported, among other things, to the Ministero della Pubblica Istruzione at Rome that Frothingham was acquiring antiquities in Italy as a mandatario for the wealthy Marquands, that he was closely linked, in his frequent trips to Rome, with Wolfgang Helbig, former second secretary of the German Institute and a known antiquities agent, and with Rodolfo Lanciani, whom Barnabei loathed.132 Thus, Barnabei would naturally be watchful when Frothingham came to Rome as an official of the new American School.133 In fact, when Barnabei 129 In the Classical School's second year (1896-1897), Allan Marquand (1853-1924) replaced Frothingham but with a different title - as Professor of Archaeology. While at the School, Marquand contributed funds for the Library as well as collections of marble specimens and photographs of Christian art (Director Minton Warren writing in the ASCSR Annual Report, 1896-1897, p. 147). Thus, for two years Frothingham and Marquand overlapped at Princeton for only brief intervals. In 1896 they published their joint volume, A Textbook of the History of Sculpture, but by 1898 they had ceased to be an effective team. 130 Frothingham appears to have continued contact with Italians after his connection with the Classical School. For instance, he was a delegate, accompanied by his wife, at the 1912 International Congress in Rome. He presided at a session and delivered a paper on the significance of arches {Congresso 1912, 94). See n. 137 below showing contact with Mancinelli as late as 1913. The preface of his 1918 Simplified Italian Manual reveals not only nostalgia for Italy but deep sympathy with the Italian people: "I envy anyone going to Italy for the first time if he knows how to appreciate the extreme democracy of its people and their ability to get into sympathetic understanding with any real person. I lived with them, with all sorts of them, for over twenty years, and all kinds and conditions acted unto me as they would wish to have me act unto them" (Frothingham 1918, iv). 131 AIA Archives, 14 June 1895, box 7, folder 7.

GEFFCKEN heard of Frothingham's activity at Norba, he telegraphed the mayor of the nearby town of Norma and turned up on 3 February 1896 with four of his colleagues. The carriage driver from the local railroad station up to Norba and a town guard assured Barnabei that indeed Frothingham had excavated.134 In his own report, Frothingham states that he had only sunk surveying poles and had stayed within the law. In any event, the terms Barnabei ultimately issued to Frothingham (an Italian inspector/excavator and funds from the Ministry) so limited the American project that Frothing- ham abandoned his intention to apply for an excavation permit after reporting on his survey. From Norba, he went on to surveying at Cora and Setia and started work at Privernum, Terracina, and Circeii. He also traced ancient roads between these sites. Although wrong in believing these sites "Pelasgian" or more ancient than Etruscan cities, Frothingham did foreshadow many later scholars who have recorded the topography, sites, and roads of central Italy. Otherwise, Frothingham could watch others excavate. As Richard De Puma has shown, Frothingham took his American School students to Narce to see a local archaeologist, Francesco Màncinelli Scotti, at work. In such ways, Frothingham made the contacts that enabled him to pur- chase and export tomb groups for American museums. For Frothingham, 1895 to 1896 must have been an almost frenzied year.135 Though active in exporting antiquities in 1895 and 1896, Frothingham apparendy donated no objects to the Classical School. Instead, in January 1933, long after his death, the Academy collec- tion received a box that Frothingham had left stored, in the earlier years of the century, with Jesse Benedict Carter and his wife. After Carter's death in 1917, Mrs. Carter gave the box to the Rev. Walter Lowrie, an old Fellow of the Classical School and rector of St. Paul's Church on the Via Nazionale. Though most of the fragmentary pieces in this box were discarded in 1948, the sherd from Norba given to Frothingham by Angiolo Pasqui is worthy of note (see p. 247). 136 Furthermore, see the five pieces of bronze jewelry from a tomb near Anagni, which apparendy had passed from Mancinelli to Frothingham (see pp. 56-57 n. 137, 248, 361). 137 ambitions of the French School and the German Institute (Barnabei 1991, 158-160). We do not know whether he knew that Frothingham was also carefully watched by Helbig. In fall 1895 Helbig urged a major donor and his valuable client, Carl Jacobsen of Copenhagen, to hurry and purchase a statue left in the estate of the Roman dealer Francesco Martinetti, that otherwise Frothingham would pose a threat. On 18 November 1895, Jacobsen replied from Copenhagen, "II suo arrivo [Frothingham 's] sarà probabilmente . . . fatale per noi ... Se questo Americano resta a Roma, certamente ci porterà via tutto" (quoted, translated from German, in Guarducci 1980, 510-511) Jacobsen feared to lose chances to acquire sculpture for Copenhagen, but according to Guarducci, Helbig also feared that Frothingham would see the statue for what it was, a fake (see especially Guarducci 1980, 509-525). 134 Barnabei 1991,435. 135 On taking students to Narce, see De Puma 1986, 1-7; for his cast project at the Arch of Trajan in Benevento, see p. 67. 136 Frothingham's notation on the sherd from Norba (inv. noģ 3965) is preserved in Van Buren 's catalogue: Given me by Pasqui part of what was found in his presence on Temple Acropolis of Norba by a man hoeing the ground - before I went to Norba - he has others can't find them formed 3 vases Frothingham's handwriting makes some of the words almost illegible; I offer the text above as my best guess. The asser- tion that Pasqui visited Norba before Frothingham's work contradicts Frothingham's remark that the archaeological bu- reaucracy focused almost exclusively on Etruria and generally ignored Latium (ASCSR Annual Report, 1895-1896, p. 60). Angiolo Pasqui (1857-1915) was a member of the team who, with Barnabei, visited Norba in 1896 to assess Frothingham's activities. The others were Conte Adolfo Cozza (1848-1910), Raniero Mengarelli (1863-1944), who eventually excavated Norba, and Luigi Borsari.

Olcott 138 A classicist, numismatist, and epigrapher, George Olcott has been the subject of study139 because he not only collected antiquities but also sold his acquisitions to many colleges and universities in America. Olcott 's collection is now widely dispersed, some at Columbia University, for instance, some at the University of Illinois and the American Academy, and some of his coins found their way into the Walton Collection at Wellesley College. A complete inventory of objects that reached American hands through Olcott will probably never be reconstructed. The Olcott pieces now in the Academy's collection were the gift of his widow, long after his death. Born 19 September 1869 in Brooklyn, Olcott received his B.A. from Columbia in 1893 and stayed on at Columbia as University Fellow in Latin (1894-1896). Arriving in Rome in late autumn of 1896, as Drisler (traveling) Fellow of Columbia, he arranged to spend the year as a student at the American School of Classical Studies but lost much time in the winter because of illness. His ability, however, encouraged the School to award him a fellowship for 1897-1898. That year he worked on the palaeography of Republican coins and "had the good fortune to come into possession of a number of sepulchral inscriptions, found by workmen near the Via Ostiensis."140 In his publica- tion of these 28 inscriptions Olcott says the workmen had hidden these finds from the authorities because of "cupidity."141 Thus began the Olcott collection. For the rest of his life, Olcott divided his time between New York and Rome. In 1899, he re- ceived his Ph.D. at Columbia and began his teaching career there, first in archaeology and then in Latin. By 1903 he had become an Associate Professor. His links to Italy remained strong, however, not only because of his scholarly interests and his desire to build his collection but also because he had married an Italian, Zita Ledderucci, and owned a little villa in Rome. In fact, he returned to Rome each summer. Then, in 1908-1909 he was once again linked to the Classical School, this time as an "Associate." After two years back at Columbia, he returned, in the fall of 1911, as a school Fellow and Research Associate of the Carnegie Institution. His project was to continue work on his Thesaurus of Latin inscriptions, fascicles of which he had begun to publish in 1904. In the late winter he developed pneumonia and died at his villa on 2 March 1912. Fourteen years later, in 1926, letter, May 1913 w. 2 vases Italic or [??] Corinthian Unfortunately, the letter from Mancinelli does not survive. "Mancinelli" probably refers to Francesco Mancinelli Scotti (born 1847) rather than Riccardo Mancinelli because the former excavated more widely than the latter. Mancinelli Scotti was from Civita Castellana (Delpino in Barnabei 1991, 253 n. 7; 357 n. 72; see also Matteucig 1951, 1, 4). 138 Sources: ASCSR Annual Report, 1896-1897, 1897-1898, 1908-1909, 1911-1912; Edlund 1980, 6-8, 57; Guar- ducci 1980; 1987; Olcott n.d.

In a manuscript held by the Rare Book and Manuscript Library at Columbia University, Olcott wrote about these inscriptions from Via Ostiense: "These inscriptions were obtained from Gaetano Cellini, a mason, who had secured them from the workmen and removed them to his own house, where he disposed of them as best he could" (Olcott n.d., 2). Olcott also had contact with prominent antiquities dealers. In the Columbia manuscript he reports buying CIL 6.3. 20840 (Columbia no. 40) and CIL 6.2.14587 (Columbia no. 44) from Pasinati, whose shop was in Via S. Maria de' Monti, on 30 January 1897 (MS 22-23, 25, 26). For the antiquities links among Francesco Martinetti, Wilhelm Helbig, and Pasinati, see Guarducci 1980, esp. 525-529 on the "Cista Pasinati" now in the Brit- ish Museum. For an amusing tale about Pasinati and Prince Torlonia, see Tyskiewicz 1898, 92-96. In addition, one of Olcott's Columbia inscriptions ( CIL 6.4.3.37274 = Colum- bia no. 436) had passed through the hands of Paul Hartwig (1858-1919), originally a scholar at the German Institute and linked to Helbig and Martinetti in the antiquities trade. See Guarducci 1980, 502; 1987, 55-61; and Paris 1994, 8, 9, 62-72. Olcott also acquired inscriptions from columbaria outside the Porta Salaria.</page><page sequence="73">58 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN his widow gave the Academy objects that Olcott had stored at his Roman home - a collection of terra sigillata, sixteen inscriptions, and lamps. Van Buren published the inscriptions and Howard Comfort the terra sigillata.142 In his scholarship, Olcott concentrated on the vocabulary of Roman inscriptions and on coins. His doctoral thesis, published in Rome in 1898, was entided Studies in the Word Formation of the Latin Inscriptions, Substantives and Adjectives, with Special Reference to the Latin Sermo Vulgaris. Within a year or so he must have begun work on his Thesaurus Linguae Latinae Epigraphicae. By 1912, he had produced 22 fascicles but had not reached the end of words beginning with "a." In- deed, he had designed a lifelong project, which early death kept him from completing. His articles on coins, on the other hand, were shorter pieces, frequendy about his own coins. Olcott set forth his aims as a collector and seller of antiquities in a letter to Classical Weekly. He argues for building working collections as teaching tools in all levels of classics instruction - schools, colleges, and universities. He states that each summer in Rome he is "brought constandy in touch with recent casual discoveries," that he does not acquire objects of value subject to Italian control but rather small antiquities illustrating Roman life. Nor are prices high: "a few such objects of perfect authenticity are within the reach of anyone."143 A catalogue of his coins for sale publicized in Classical Journal had led to a happy flow of Olcott coins into the possession of teachers in the Middle West. Though risking the label of "antiquity dealer," he proudly describes the success of his "missionary enterprise," which enabled not only Columbia to own a collection but also "number- less schools and colleges."144 Thomas Ashhy 145 Thomas Ashby, Jr. has been the subject of so many publications that a detailed treatment of his life is not necessary here. For instance, James Anderson introduces his 1991 study of the Ashby brick stamp collection at the Academy with a biographical account,146 and earlier, Ashby ' s own pupil Ian Richmond wrote a substantial essay on his mentor for the Dictionary of National Biography }A1 Ger- mane to this volume is Ashby s relation to the Academy and his large donation of objects not to the logical recipient, the British School at Rome, but to the Academy. First, a summary of Ashby s life. In Staines, England, Ashby s family had prospered from the brewery business and were well- known Quakers. Thomas Ashby, Sr., and Rose Emma Smith made sure their son, born at Staines on 14 October 1874, received excellent training. Thomas, Jr., was educated at Winchester (where he was dubbed with the lifelong nickname "Titus") and at Christ Church, Oxford, where he achieved a notable record (a first class in classical moderations, 1895, and in literae humaniores , 1897; af- terwards, Craven Fellow at Oxford, 1897; D. Litt., 1905; and the Conington Prize, 1906). Even in his school days, Italy became the focus of Ashby s interests because in 1890 Ashby, Sr., sold the 142 A. W.

"Titus" Ashby finished his British education, but during vacations at Rome, he joined his father in exploring archaeological sites with Lanciani. Thus began a lifetime of investigating the topography of Italy, especially Latium, through his eyes and feet, often walking, sometimes riding a bicycle - observing, recording, and picking up samples. This collection of specimens he gave the Academy in 1924. Ashby was closely identified with the British School at Rome from its inception in 1901, when he arranged to become its first student (16 January 1902), to 1903, when he was appointed Assistant Director, to the long stretch, 1906-1925, when he served as Director. Through his energetic field study and numerous publications, he established topography as a central topic in Italian archaeology. One need mention only his work with Esther Van Deman on aqueducts, his impact on Giuseppe Lugli and through Lugli on Ferdinando Castagnoli, and now the currendy active Lorenzo and Stefania Quilici, to see Ashby s formative role. For the wider classical world, his most important contribution was, and is still today, his fundamental reworking of Plainer 's Topographical Dictionary of Ancient Rome.148 On 20 July 1921, Ashby married Caroline May Price- Williams, and there slowly developed an extremely strained situation at the British School (which had moved in 1915 from Palazzo Odescalchi to its new building in Valle Giulia). By nature Ashby lacked the skills and tact to deal effectively with the School students, and he also had no professional teaching experience. But fortunately in 1909 Mrs. Eugenie Sellers Strong became Assistant Director. The well-known author of Roman Sculpture 149 Mrs. Strong possessed a cosmopolitan, aristocratic background and a regal personality. She excelled in presiding over an international salon of bright intellectuals. By contrast, Ashby was shy and blunt, only really at ease with friends who shared his scholarly concerns. Though vastly dissimilar, Ashby and Mrs. Strong managed to run the British School as a team for eleven years (fig. 3.11). But the arrival of Ashby s quiet, modest bride threatened Mrs. Strongs control. In fact, "In public Mrs. Strong ignored the existence of Mrs. Ashby and never referred to her."150 In particular, a major dispute arose between the two women over the use of the spare room at the School.151 The Schools Executive Committee reacted by renewing both Ashby s and Strongs appointments only through 1924-1925. Hurt and angry, Ashby decided in 1924 to give his collection of antiquities to the Academy. In any case, he probably realized that, when he moved out of the British School, a new apartment would not provide sufficient space for all of his specimens. Ashby was an old friend of the American Classical School. Contact between his family and the Americans probably came about first through the British and American Archaeological Society (see p. 28) and specifically through Lanciani, who had connections throughout English-speaking Rome. Then, in September 1901 and 1902, Director Richard Norton reported that at several sites in the Campagna the American Classical School benefited from Ashby 's field lectures. In each instance, Ashby presented "the results of his researches on the spot."152 Esther Van Deman s photograph of the Classical School at Frascati documents one of these trips in the winter or early spring of 1903: Ashby, short and stocky, sits on the left, Van Buren and George Pfeiffer stand behind, and Van Deman sits on the right end (fig. 3. 12). 153 Then, in 1905 there appeared the first volume of the Supplementary Papers of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome , containing articles 148 Platner 1929. 149 Strong 1907. 150 Wiseman 1990, 35 n. 63 quoting C.

During the summer months immediately following the date of this photograph, Mrs. Strong and Dr. Ashby would learn that the governing board of the British School at Rome was appointing them for only one more year, 1924-1923. Ashby then began donating his antiquities to the Academy (Photographic Archive, American Academy). on Artena and Carsioli by Ashby and Pfeiffer jointly.154 In the "Prefatory Note" Director Norton expresses "the high appreciation in which the School holds the help that it repeatedly has received from Mr. Ashby."155 Pfeiffer returned to America, but Van Deman and Van Buren, both living in Rome, maintained frequent contact with Ashby until 1931, when on 15 May Ashby fell to his death from a train in England. For Miss Van Deman especially, Ashby s death was a profound loss. Not only were they old professional friends, but beginning in 1924 they together scoured the Campagna for the evi- dence later published in their massive volumes on the aqueducts (hers in 1934, his posthumously in 1935). 156 Brief glimpses of this pair studying the aqueducts survive in photographs - for instance, on page 21 of Van Deman 's book (fig. 3.13) and in Ashby 's, plate Xlla, facing page 218. In the prefaces of their books, both affirm the productive collaboration they had experienced.157 Although gratefully received by the Academy, the Ashby donation of 1924 (and pieces later added from Ashby s and Van Deman 's excursions) clearly placed a heavy burden on the curator. Not only were there thousands of sherds, shells, ceramic and terracotta fragments, and bones in black stockings, but Ashby s labels were often hastily written or almost illegible, especially on 154 Ashby and Pfeiffer 1905; Pfeiffer and Ashby 1905. 155 Supplementary Papers 1905, iv. 156 Ashby 1935; Van Deman 1934. 157 Van Deman 1934, iii; Ashby 1935, x.</page><page sequence="76">Fig. 3. 12.

GEFFCKEN items acquired later in his career. After the curator Curtis died in June 1925, the donation became Van Buren s responsibility. According to Van Buren, it was not considered proper during Ashby s and Van Deman 's lifetime to prepare a catalogue of the objects; they were left in storage just as received.158 Then, in May 1937, Miss Van Deman died, and finally, in the winter of 1938-1939, Van Buren began to unpack and catalogue the objects. By 21 January 1939, Van Buren had inventoried museum numbers 1301-1630. In this period Van Buren also catalogued other donations (including Miss Van Deman 's bequest), and many sections of Ashby 's gift are interspersed with these other groups. Finally, with number 8236 Van Buren ended the Ashby listing, on 11 November 1945. Thus, Van Buren spent the lonely war years methodically filling two large ledgers. His task seems now almost overwhelming (he repeatedly mentions difficulty in reading Ashby s notes), and he labored at it malnourished (see pp. 44-45). His unpublished manuscript of more than 50 pages on the donation gives the impression of loyal diligence and exhaustion. He began drafting the manuscript 6 December 1943, asserting the importance of the collection since Ashby collected many of the samples as he prepared his papers on the Campagna. Van Buren hoped to see some- day a concordance between the specimens and Ashby s publications.159 And he hoped to see them properly displayed, preferably in a large studio near the museum room. But during the war, he could not obtain india ink to write suitable labels, and in many instances he noted objects needing analysis by specialists. In the meantime, in order to assure future accuracy about provenance, he could only urge that the pieces not be disturbed from the location he noted for them.160 After these years of work, the vast reassessment of the collection under Professor Brown's direction in 1948 must have been dismaying to the recently retired Van Buren. The first specimen acquired by Ashby in the donation bore the date 1894, and the findspots of the collection included England, France, Switzerland, and Malta, with the bulk from Latium. The following are some of the sites recorded for the vicinity of Rome: Veii, Capena, Temple of Diana at Nemi, Artena, Via Latina ad decimum , Ponte di Nona, Prima Porta, Ostia, Malborghetto, Monte Mario, Ninfa, Norba, and Tivoli. The terracotta votives, many fragmentary, from near the Roman bridge at the ninth mile of the Via Praenestina (Ponte di Nona), collected in 1906, provide an insight into the quantity Ashby might acquire from a site and what happened to them in 1948. The inventory book lists 600 items from Ponte di Nona, many of them anatomical objects (inv. nos. 1673-1725, 2048-2594). All but 23 of these were discarded in 1948.161 More fortunate were Ashby s brick stamps. In November 1945 and April 1946 Van Buren listed Ashby s 372 specimens. Probably because in 1946 Herbert Bloch expressed an interest in publishing these, they remained untouched and unpublished, until James Anderson studied them in the 1980s.162 Esther Boise Van Deman 163 Like Thomas Ashby, Esther Boise Van Deman (fig. 3.14) gave her collection, at least those antiquities stored in Rome, to the Academy, and like him, she has recendy been the focus of considerable interest. 158 Van Buren 1943-1944, 2-3. 159 Van Buren 1943-1944, 2. 160 Van Buren 1943-1944, 4a. 161 The 23 objects from Ponte di Nona not discarded in 1948: inv. nos. 1684, 1700, 1702, 1713, 1718, 1721, 1724, 2410, 2414, 2415, 2432, 2436, 2437, 2440, 2441, 2446, 2447, 2448, 2449, 2528, 2529, 2575, 2590. 162 Anderson 1991. 163 Sources: For all sources, chronology, and bibliography, see Einaudi and Geffcken 1991, passim.

Esther Boise Van Deman as instructor in Latin, Wellesley College, 1893-1893 (courtesy of Wellesley College Archives). Selections from her photographic archive have been mounted in exhibitions, and her analysis of the Atrium Vestae restudied through Russell Scott's recent excavations.164 Current archival research about her life and reappraisal of her achievements show that, incomplete as her major project on ancient construction remained at her death, she was one of the most unusual women of her genera- tion. Indeed, given her origins, her career is no less than a miracle. Somewhere in her character was a resdessness, a stubbornness, and ambition that drove her to devise a life rare for a woman in her time. After four teaching posts in America, she obviously rejected a professorial career like that of her fellow academic women, and she found a way, thanks to those who believed in her, to stay in Rome studying ancient techniques of construction. Van Deman was born, the youngest child in her family, on 1 October 1862, in the family farmhouse at South Salem, Ohio. As she reached her later teen years, Esther was uprooted from her home when much of the family moved to central Kansas. She always thought of herself as a Midwesterner and pioneer and displayed litde patience with luxury or city refinements. Life in a tiny town in early Kansas required setders with fortitude, patience, resourcefulness, and independence. Such experience no doubt equipped Van Deman for years of later fieldtrips in Italy and for travel by herself to remote sites in Tunisia and Algeria (1913). Courses at the College of Emporia, Kansas, 1884-1886, provided the background she needed to matriculate at the University of Michigan. There, she studied under Professor Francis Kelsey, who became her loyal supporter until his death in 1927. She received her B.A. in 1891 and her M.A. in 1892, both in Latin, at Michigan. From Ann Arbor, she moved to Bryn Mawr as Fellow in Latin in 1892-1893. Later, in 1898 she became one of the first three candidates awarded the Ph.D. in Latin at the University of Chicago. Her long 164 Scott 1993a; 1993b; 2007; 2009.

GEFFCKEN interest in the goddess Vesta began at Michigan and continued at Chicago, where she entitled her doctoral thesis "The Cult of Vesta Publica and the Vestal Virgins." For three years after receiving her Chicago doctorate, Van Deman sought funding to continue her research in Rome, to fill gaps in the documentation of her dissertation and bring it to publishable level. She finally reached Rome in the fall of 1901 as a student at the American School of Classical Studies. She managed to stay in Rome for two years; then later, she became Carnegie Fellow at the School (1906-1909), next a researcher on a Carnegie grant in Rome (1909-1910), and finally, a Research Associate of the Carnegie Institution (1910-1925). Thus, supported by the Washington- based Carnegie Institution, she lived on in Rome. From 1910 to 1917 her connections were perhaps closer with the British School and the German Institute than with the American Classical School. But she maintained her professional and private links with America through trips home for lecture tours and convalescence.165 When she reached her sixties, Professor Kelsey arranged to have her appointed a nonresident member of the Michigan faculty on a salary paid by the Carnegie Institu- tion (1926-1930). In 1930 she became a retired, pensioned Carnegie Associate, and she died on 3 May 1937 in Rome, where she is buried in the Protestant Cemetery. In her thirties and early forties, Van Deman taught in four female institutions, the only teach- ing possibility realistically open to her then in America. But these situations were confining and frustrating to her, and her lack of tact made her a difficult colleague. She taught at Wellesley College (1893-1895), at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore (1895-1896), at Mount Holyoke College (1898-1901), and at the Womans College of Baltimore (later renamed Goucher College, 1903-1906). Not only was she ill at ease in Eastern institutions, but her yearning for the world of research made her unsympathetic with many characteristics of undergraduate (largely residential) colleges. Nevertheless, she made some lasting friendships among her female colleagues, who, when they came to Rome in the years before World War I, joined her at the Pensione Girardet at Piazza Esquilino, where she made her home until 1917. After she returned to Rome in 1922, she decided to move closer to the Academy and convinced a group of Russian refugees who lived right behind the Acqua Paola to take her as one of their first paying guests. Thus began the Pensione Fersen, which became an Academy "annex" and the Roman home of numerous American scholars. Marion Blake, for instance, Miss Van Deman 's carefully chosen literary executrix, lived at the Fersens'. It was left to Marion Blake and then Doris Taylor Bishop to rework, restudy, and complete Dr. Van Deman 's long project on Roman construction. But in her lifetime, Van Deman earned consider- able prestige for her monograph on the Atrium Vestae published in 1909, her articles on concrete monuments of 1912 and on the Forum and Palatine published between 1908 and 1925, and for her volume on the Roman aqueducts of 1934. 166 This last volume grew out of her long association with Thomas Ashby in scouring the Campagna for traces of Romes water sources. In a time when foreigners were not allowed to excavate in Italy, she and Ashby found ways to analyze or measure what they could see and map. Closely identified always with her first topic, Vesta, she frequently lectured to Academy Fellows in the Forum and specifically in the Atrium Vestae. At her death, the antiquities Miss Van Deman had acquired were stored partly at Johns Hop- kins, partly in Rome.167 But because Tenney Frank of Hopkins had outraged her by writing about 165 She gave lectures in 1910-1911, 1914, 1925-1926; she re- ceived an honorary degree at Michigan in 1936; and she spent a period of convalescence from 1917 to 1922 in America. 166 See above nn. 145 and 163. For her collaboration with Thomas Ashby on the aqueducts, see p. 60. 167 When Miss Van Deman returned from Rome in 1903 to teach at Goucher, she sought out colleagues at Johns Hop- kins, especially Harry Langford Wilson, to consult about her research. Depositing her antiquities there, when she left again for Rome in 1906, was no doubt her way of thanking Wilson, who was interested in building a didactic collection</page><page sequence="80">THE HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION 65 her own special subject,168 she required in her will that her objects in America be moved, for per- manent ownership, to the Kelsey Museum at the University of Michigan. The antiquities she had in Rome, numbering more than 300, came to the Academy's collection. They included vases and objects in all materials - ceramics, glass, bronze, and bone - and 39 coins (37 ancient, 2 modern). She also left many samples of building materials. Although most of these samples were subsequendy discarded, her outstanding marble collection remains today Academy property. In addition, Miss Van Deman s magnificent negatives and prints, also left to the Academy, are now catalogued in the Academy's Photographic Archive and available for consultation. Among her books, the 130 that did not duplicate Library holdings were accessioned. Miss Van Deman clearly assembled her collection of construction specimens and took many of her own photographs in support of her scholarly projects. But no discernible pattern emerges for the rest of her collecting. And unfortunately, she did not normally note provenance or place and date of purchase. Like many American scholars then in Rome, she must have frequented the markets where small antiquities were sold and bought what she liked and could afford (she always took care to save money to send home to her family in America). Two parts of her collection left to the Academy were rapidly published, her coins in 1938 and her vases in 1940.169 In August 1946 Van Buren organized many of her small objects, such as needles, pins, and surgical instruments, into an "antiquarium" (together with similar pieces from the old Classical School collection and other donors). He noted that "most of the choicer specimens" were from Dr. E. B. Van Deman 's legacy, "and testify to her judgement as a collector as well as to her generosity as a benefactor."170 Elsewhere, Van Buren speaks of Van Deman 's "skill as a collector."171 One category in Van Buren 's listing for the "antiquarium" shows a similarity in collecting and a possible sharing between Van Deman and Ashby. He mentions 40 miniature clay ex-votos from Ashby and 25 from Van Deman, which, he asserts, must have come from a deposit low on the Anio gorge known as Acquoria.172 Although Van Deman noted no provenance, her group of 25 was clearly identical in type with Ashby 's, on which his label cited the temple of Hercules at Tivoli as the source.173 Van Buren quotes Ugo Antonielli's article on the fossa votiva at Acquoria to demonstrate that in fact these small votives came not from the Heracleium but from Antonielli's site below.174 Antonielli reports that in 1898 Inspector Luigi Borsari had recovered many objects from this location, supposing that they had been swept down from the temple area above. Only part of Borsari's finds became state property; the rest were so plentifully for sale in Tivoli that they were seen even in children's hands. Borsari himself gave some to Giacomo Boni, and Ashby bought some of them.175 After she came to Rome in 1901, Miss Van Deman must have found these small votives abundantly available at Tivoli. In the 1948 reorganization, all 25 (inv. nos. 1256-1280) of Van Deman 's pieces from this group were retained, and only three of the 38 Ashby specimens (see Wilson 1907-1908). On later trips to the United States, Van Deman often stopped in Baltimore to visit her nephew, Ralph Van Deman Magoffin, who took his doctorate at Johns Hopkins and taught there until 1923. 168 Frank 1924. 169 See Snyder 1938; Avery, Blank, and Starr 1940. 170 A.

GEFFCKEN catalogued by Van Buren were discarded (retained: inv. nos. 3134-3146, 3148-3169; 3138 was apparently not present in 1948). The Ship Timbers from Lake Nemi 176 At different times, the Academy collection has contained some unexpected items, such as bones of an elephas antiquus donated by Thomas Ashby, a human skull retrieved in 1940 by Lester Houck from a construction ditch near the Villa Aurelia gate, and wooden timbers from one or both of the Roman galleys in Lake Nemi. The elephant and human remains were discarded in the museum reorganization of 1948, but the ship timbers remain today. Of the three timbers, the largest, a little more than 2 meters long, weathered but still sturdy in girth, was part of the collection by 1925-1926, when Van Buren reported analysis of its species. The two shorter pieces were donated on 12 August 1935 by Signor Luigi Tacconi. These two smaller specimens come from the ship nearer the shore, the "first" ship; the long beam could have come from either ship. Before the successful removal of the two ships, between 1928 and 1932, from lowered waters of the lake, there had been many attempts to raise the "first" ship, which lay in 7 to 12 meters of water. Beginning as far back as the fifteenth century, these attempts all failed, and nearly all dam- aged the ship. Especially damaging were the efforts of an antiquarian named Eliseo Borghi, who in 1895 brought up not only many bronze fittings and fragments of mosaic but also a tremendous quantity of wood. On 3 October 1895, Borghi saw the diver emerge with the first bronze from the nearer ship, and on 20 November he observed the first two of many beams come up 19 meters from the second ship. He carefully transported away the fittings and mosaics but left behind the timbers on the lakeshore. Figures 10-14 in Guido Ucelli's Le Navi di Nemi show piles of these beams,177 many of them about the same size as the largest Academy timber and, like ours, still carrying large iron nails. In the years after 1895, this abandoned wood furnished fuel for stoves and fireplaces of local inhabitants. The large Academy beam may well be one of these, retrieved as a valued ancient specimen. The accession of this largest piece is not recorded in either Harmon s or Van Buren s inventory ledgers. But in the mid- 1920s Admiral William L. Rodgers of the United States Navy visited the Academy and became interested in it. He arranged for two samples taken from it to be examined at the Department of Agriculture Forest Service in Washington and at the Forest Products Laboratory at Madison, Wisconsin. On 9 March 1926, an official at the Forestry Service reported the laboratory results, that the wood was not fir but spruce.178 According to these experts, spruce was far stronger than Appennine fir and more appropriate for an Imperial vessel. How the two smaller pieces came into the Academy's collection is well documented in Van Buren 's inventory. Signor Tacconi, apparendy a friend of the Academy who also donated four coins, received the specimens from a chief engineer of the successful rescue operation at Lake Nemi. In- gegnere Ludovico Bonamico was Capo dell'Ufficio Speciale del Genio Civile per il Tevere e l'Agro Romano, and in 1930 he described retrieval of the "first" ship in full detail, in a paper published first in Italian and then, a year later, in French. Later, on leaving Rome, Bonamico gave Tacconi 176 Sources: KKR Annual Report, 1925-1926, pp. 57-59 (Van Buren reporting); Bonamico 1930; 1931; Borghi 1901, esp. 22-30; Devoti 1980; Moretti 1940, 3-7, esp. 4-5 on Borghi; Ucelli 1940. 177 Ucelli 1940, 18-19. 178 AAR Annual Report, 1925-1926, pp. 57-59.</page><page sequence="82">THE HISTORY OF THE COLLECTION 67 the two pieces of wood, stating that they both came from the "first" ship, and Tacconi in turn gave them to the Academy. Inv. no. 1118, measured by Van Buren at 1.12 m, resembles the larger piece in color and water- worn texture. Inv. no. 1119, 0.665 m long, is, on the other hand, a square beam with smoothly planed sides and some woodworm holes. It would be interesting to know how many such fragments exist today, carried away from the lake as specimens or curiosities. When the retreating Germans burned the museum of the ships on the night between 3 1 May and 1 June 1944, they made sure that only such remnants of the timbers as the Academy possesses would survive to document basic material of these Imperial pleasure craft. Plaster Casts For many years, the Academy owned a cast collection, as did dozens of art museums and educational institutions. Indeed, acquaintance with famous pieces of ancient sculpture was widely disseminated through the export of casts from Europe. Impressions of coins and gems were also made in elegant white plaster, which American tourists carried home in souvenir trays. The Academy's cast collec- tion grew from two needs: the common use of these copies in fine arts training and the didactic aims of the Classical School. The latter function, casts for teaching and close study, emerges in the First Annual Report of the old Classical School, where Associate Director Arthur Lincoln Frothingham describes his project for casts of the Arch at Beneventum.179 In the spring of 1896, he obtained permission from the Ministry of Public Instruction to build scaffolding around the arch, make the clay molds, and take photographic plates. With advice and assistance from the German Institute, the casts were completed in 28 sections, and 19 photographs were made. The School offered copies from the molds and photographs for sale. The set of casts was priced at $925 plus packing and shipping, and the photographic series at about $10. 180 It would be interesting to know how many sets eventually reached America. In its effort to improve classical instruction in the United States, the Classical School a short time later sold squeezes of inscriptions. In 1904, Wellesley College purchased a set of these. When the present main Academy building was designed, a large room in the northeast corner was intended as a cast museum. In addition, casts of busts, probably property of the Academy from its days at Villa Mirafiori, were arranged around the salone and dining room, and on top of bookshelves in the Library. Larger casts decorated the Cortile (fig. 3.15). In March 1918, the cast collection grew enormously when the Academy received more than 300 pieces from the estate of Franklin Simmons (1839-1913). Simmons was an American sculptor who worked for years in Rome, with a studio at Via S. Nicola Tolentino 72. 181 Apparently, the Simmons collection included more than 300 casts, because the Academy Acting Director, Gorham Stevens, reports in his diary, 19 March 1918, that he "selected" casts on his visit to the Simmons holdings. The casts arrived at the Academy on 24 March, as Stevens noted in his diary. A few months later Stevens reported that these were casts taken from antique sculptures as well as from living models.182 By 1919-1920, the collection was so vast that it overflowed the basement room where items not on display were stored, causing Stevens to propose a separate building for the casts, such as at 179 ASCSR Annual Report, 1895-1896, pp. 54-59. 180 ASCSR Annual Report, 1897-1898, p. 97. 181 On Simmons, see Vance 1989, 1:247, 256, 344-345, 375 and 2:281; Soria 1982,271. 182 AAR Annual Report, 1917-1918, p. 39.</page><page sequence="83">68 KATHERINE A.

For example, in spring 1921, 30 casts were arranged in the Cortile for the annual exhibition.184 Yet more casts continued to arrive at the Academy. In 1927, Professor Carlo Albizzati gave the Academy a cast of the Discobolus of Myron,185 and in the year 1930-1931, Mr. and Mrs. J. Wash- ington Rinaldi donated four casts.186 The Academy's museum also received casts of gems and coins from the estate of the American painter Elihu Vedder (inv. no. 4122). 187 Like Simmons, Vedder, who died in 1923, had lived in Rome for years. In 1959, Elizabeth Van Buren added to the museum's collection of small casts (inv. nos. 8809-8813). The appropriateness of casts for museums was, however, a debatable subject among curators. Walter Muir Whitehill writes vividly of this controversy at the Museum of Fine Arts in Boston, in his chapter "The Batde of the Casts."188 In Boston, of course, those who favored a museum of original objects won out. Such forces (and also probably space limitations) prevailed at the Academy.

He said he had "started litde collections of casts of antique gems, intaglios, and coins and of fragments of ancient mille-fiore glass." Certainly, some of these items still exist in the Academy's collection.

In 1939, Mason Hammond and John Walker compiled a survey of photographs at the Academy and included the remark, "The various casts of Classical Sculpture about the Academy might be identified and catalogued."189 And in the January 1941 inventory of the Academy, Van Buren reported that the large collection of casts not only was still stored in special basement rooms, but it also decorated corridors and rooms throughout the main building.190 After World War II, apparendy in 1947, at least by 27 April, the Academy donated an unknown number of casts to the Museo di Roma, which then transferred them to the Museo dei Gessi (Uni- versity of Rome, La Sapienza).191 The late Inez Longobardi described the day the casts were carried away. When Riccardo Davico, the Academy Secretary, went to move the Venus de Milo , which stood just outside the Library door, he removed his hat - out of respect!192 Today, the casts of gems and coins, however, remain in the Study Collection, stored in the Norton-Van Buren room in Building 5B. The "Museum" and Its Location Although the "museum" has been often mentioned in the preceding sections, I would like to summarize here what we know about its location and arrangement from 1896 to the present time. In the First Annual Report of the old Classical School for 1895-1896, Director William Gardner Hale included floor plans of the Villa Cheremeteff at the corner of Via Gaeta and Via Palestro, the second home of the School, from the fall of 1896 to just before Christmas 1901. Property of a Russian family named Cheremeteff, the building was actually subleased from Waldo Story, son of the American sculptor and writer William Wetmore Story.193 The plan of the ground floor shows that the room just to the right of the main entrance, but entered from a "cloak room" behind it, was set aside for inscriptions.194 Such a designation reflects the emphasis on epigraphy in the early School. For example, among the first Fellows was Walter Dennison, notable for his work on Latin and Osean inscriptions.195 The School soon outgrew Villa Cheremeteff, and by December 1901 when it moved to the larger Villa Bonghi a few blocks away, at the intersection of Via Vicenza and Via dei Mille, it already possessed a small collection of objects for study. Dr. Edmonston Charles had donated his Etruscan collection, and Director Richard Norton had begun his extensive purchasing. After Norton resigned 189 M. Hammond and J.

Pal- lottino to the Director of the Musei Comunali, dated 28 April 1947, which refers to the imminent transfer of casts donated by the American Academy, from storage at the Museo di Roma to the Museo dei Gessi. In December 1946 and into early January 1947, the new Academy Director Laurance Roberts was in Rome surveying what needed to be done to reopen the Academy in fall 1947. Besides sending back from storage to America huge amounts of possessions and artwork left behind by Fellows who hurriedly departed in the war, Roberts apparendy also decided that casts belonged elsewhere. Hence the donation to the Museo di Roma. 192 Oral communication from Inez Longobardi, 19 July 1987. According to Mrs. Longobardi, Davico had great loyalty and also a sense of drama. When the Nazis arrived at the front gate during World War E, "he went to meet them with a shotgun.

Steps from the court led up to this room ( undated photograph, 1913-1937, Photographic Archive, American Academy). in 1907, the new Director Jesse Benedict Carter shifted all his family s living space to the upper floors, making room for more lecture, library, and display areas on the ground floor. On 13 October 1907, Carter wrote to Professor Kelsey enclosing a rough plan of the public areas.196 A room facing the garden served as lecture and museum room. In this way, objects could be used in seminar teaching (until World War II, but especially in its early days, the Classical School gave courses for its Fellows and students). In 1905-1906 at the Villa Bonghi, A. W. Van Buren prepared his litde inventory of the Schools inscriptions, and a year later, in 1907, Austin Harmon completed his catalogue of the other antiquities. A 1909 photograph of the Classical Library at Villa Bonghi shows that pots from the collection decorated the fireplace area and mantlepiece.197 When the Academy building on the Janiculum was constructed, the "museum" was placed in the first room off the Cortile to the right of the entrance (fig. 3.16). Charles Densmore Curtis was the curator. In autumn 1915 Curtis enlisted the help of a Fellow, R. D. Harriman, to update the catalogue and arrange the objects. The Schools furniture had been transported from Villa Bonghi, and Curtis reported that cases of Italian walnut from the old School's Library now lined one side of the room for the new "museum."

He mentioned shifting more valuable objects to locked glass cases and the need for better display space.200 Not much happened until ten years later: the years 1936 to 1939 were busy with sistemazione of the "museum" and study of the objects. The collection was moved upstairs to a studio, the room that became known as the "Cosa Room." The walnut cases with their four open shelves lined the left side of the room, and a closed glass case was placed at the end of the room (fig. 3.17).201 In the period 1937-1939 four more display cases were added. The room must have been a busy place, as Van Buren organized Fellows to catalogue, update Harmon s work, and publish the collection.

GEFFCKEN years of World War II, Van Buren remained there alone, devoting his time to cataloguing and to writing papers on the collection - for example, a lengthy piece on the Ashby donation. He retired in 1946 (though his daily trip to the Academy Library remained an unbreakable habit as long as health allowed). With Frank Brown's arrival in 1947 as Professor-in-Charge, a new era in the Study Collection's fortunes was at hand. The upstairs display room began to change after excavation at Cosa was initiated in 1948, and space was needed for study by the excavating team. (See Professor Richardson's essay on Frank Brown's project to inventory the collection and reduce its bulk.) By 1968, when the late Barbara Beggs Bini came to work for Professor Brown,202 the "Cosa Room" was the place where the archae- ologists spread out their work, and the museum collection was back downstairs in the professor's office, where it had been from 1914 to 1937. The antiquities were stored in the old cabinets along the inner wall, while Brown's desk and drawing table were near the window. Barbara herself was assigned a dark corner in the inner part of the room. In the long gallery, which now houses the Barbara Goldsmith Rare Book Room, were the glass museum cases filled with Cosa materials; they had been set up for the November 1954 conference at which Lawrence and Emeline Richardson and Arthur Hanson spoke on Cosa.203 Later in 1968, all changed once more when the first floor of the Villa Chiaraviglio became office and workspace for Professor Brown, his assistants, and excavators. Barbara and Karen Collins, also working as Brown's assistant, selected "the best of the collection" for display in the old cases, while the rest went into storage in the Chiaraviglio basement. Thus, while most of the Academy never saw the antiquities, the archaeologists worked near the important pieces and came to know them well. To this period, 1968 and right after, belong the many catalogue cards and photographs of the inventory that Barbara Bini completed. Then, in the mid-1970s, space for residents and visiting scholars became urgent, and the first floor of the Chiaraviglio was again made into an apartment. So, it was back to the "Cosa Room" for Professor Brown, his assistants, and all their equipment. The Study Collection was unfortunately relegated to the dank, dusty basement of the Chiaraviglio. Later, four pieces were moved to better locations in the main building. A large vase (inv. no. 230), a Republican head of an old man (inv. no. 22), and a bearded male head, formerly considered a portrait of the philosopher Hermarchus (inv. no. 21) are now displayed in the new Barbara Goldsmith Rare Book Room. The Etruscan cippus base from Chiusi (inv. no. 473) is in the entrance hall along with many stone and marble sculptures and architectural pieces; on the location of certain pieces in the main building of the Academy, see "The Cortile Bays" by Jacquelyn Collins-Clinton in this volume. The rest of the Study Collection remained in the basement of the Chiaraviglio awaiting clean, new quarters until 2008, when the splendidly equipped space in building 5B was ready to welcome the objects.

I thank especially Jaimee L. Uhlenbrock, Ingrid Edlund-Berry and the late Lucy Shoe Meritt, James Turner, Stephen L. Dyson, Charles Henderson, and Scott Bradbury. The Library and Photographic Archive of the American Academy in Rome have given me ready access to numerous sources essential for the project. In particular I am grateful to the late former Academy Librarian Christina Huemer for countless conversations about our mutual interest in the history of the old American School of Classical Studies in Rome and the American Academy. At Wellesley College, archivists Wilma Slaight and Jean Berry guided me in learning how to use the Colleges large and beautifully organized archival resources. At the University of Michigan, Elaine Gazda and Robin Meador- Woodruff offered me the abundant resources of the Francis W. Kelsey archives. Also at Michigan, the staff of the Bent- ley Library granted much appreciated access to their archival holdings. In addition, I also found valuable material in the archives of the Archaeological Institute of America at Boston University, specifically in papers and records of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome. For helpful criticism of my text, I thank Russell Scott and Elisabeth Fentress. Further assistance from individu- als, libraries, and collections are mentioned in the footnotes, as well as in the acknowledgments immediately below. Finally, I remember with much gratitude many hours with Nina Hagmark Longobardi, Librarian at the Academy until 1975 and deceased in 1991. Whenever I asked Mrs. Longobardi about Esther Van Deman (whom Nina had known in Van Deman s last ten years), she would reply, "Let s talk instead about Elizabeth Van Buren - now she was a most interesting person. You must write about her! " How much I owe to Nina s remarks is evident, I hope, in the section above on the Van Bürens. I thank especially the following institutions for generous assistance and permission to quote from their holdings.

Recollections from the Late 1940s on the Collection of Antiquities at the American Academy in Rome During inaugurate the winter excavations of 1947-1948, at Cosa in while Etruria, the a American number of Academy measures in were Rome undertaken was gearing to accom- up to inaugurate excavations at Cosa in Etruria, a number of measures were undertaken to accom- modate the new enterprise and create the space it would require. Among these was a catalogue and organization of the antiquities that were loosely known as "the museum." These had accumulated over the years. Some of them had already been catalogued in the early years of the twentieth century, before the Academy moved to its new quarters on the Janiculum, by Austin Harmon, a Fellow of the American School of Classical Studies in 1907; small groups had also been published from time to time in the Memoirs of the American Academy in Rome by Fellows interested in particular classes of objects. But especially during the years of the Second World War the assembly, for it could hardly be called a collection, had been allowed to molder and collect dust, housed in part in the atrium/ lobby entrance and in various nooks and crannies, but especially in the long space near the north corner of the piano nobile , now known as the Philip Guston Studio. Here the collection of building materials assembled by Esther Van Deman and willed to the Academy at her death were deposited. These were stuffed in her discarded black cotton stockings together with notes on bits of paper identifying the individual items, their special importance, and the circumstances of their collection. There were also trays of ancient brick stamps collected by Thomas Ashby and donated in 1924 to the Academy and a large accumulation of specimens of colored marble, for the most part marbles that were known and used in antiquity but also including specimens that had been obtained from modern quarries by Fellows in sculpture and architecture interested in using these in their own work. There was a drawer in a cabinet labeled aidoia that contained a jumble of bits of ex-votos, largely fingers broken from votive hands but also some sexual parts, and a tin tobacconist s box labeled "coins found in Fellows' rooms after their return to the United States." A few pieces had been mounted in simple fashion for display, and these and the more fragile pottery and terracotta objects were crowded into a series of cabinets with glass-paneled doors intended rather for storage than show. The three display cases that the Academy owned at that time were unused. The Fellows in the School of Classical Studies that winter were set to work cataloguing this accumulation, seeing to the mounting of the more important pieces, and discarding duplicates and items of no interest. The material was separated by classes: sculpture, inscription, pottery, archi- tectural terracottas, and so on, and the Fellows worked in teams of two. For example, Doris Taylor and Lois Williams worked on the pottery, and William Tongue and Father John Creaghan on the inscriptions. Frank Brown, then Professor-in-Charge, took on the marble collection. The object was to get the material properly identified and divided between what would make a modest antiquarium</page><page sequence="95">80 LAWRENCE RICHARDSON, JR. of really interesting objects and what would make a good study collection. The idea of immuring enough pieces to fill one of the empty bays of the Cortile wall was broached, and of rearranging others to furnish the atrium/lobby handsomely, but eventually neither project was realized. The problem of discards was especially thorny. Much of the Van Deman collection was virtu- ally useless because the identifying annotations had disintegrated or become illegible. Many other architectural pieces were without provenance. There were numerous duplicates, or near duplicates, pieces that had obviously been collected at a single site, but the site was unknown, so the count of specimens was meaningless. There was a large collection of terracotta ex- votos, part of them from a site near Ponte d Nona, part from a site in the territory of Veii, others from elsewhere. These were jumbled together, for the most part without distinction. They were aesthetically unappealing and, except as specimens, had no value. The question was how to reduce this heterogeneous mass to a useful nucleus and to make space for the influx of archaeological material that was envisaged. Since most of the objects had never been accessioned, deletion was usually no problem, although in some rare cases, there had to be de-accessioning. The chief concern was rather with how to get rid of the stuff, since most of it was terracotta and so virtually indestructible. At one point it was proposed to dig a pit in the Academy garden and deposit it all there, but it was pointed out that the Academy was located within the walls of Rome, and discovery of this pit might cause future archaeologists confusion. Furthermore it would be flagrantly unethical, both in the excavation and the depositing. Eventually someone came up with the idea that since the Tiber had always been Romes best and best-loved agent of purification, the discards should be thrown in the Tiber. Moreover, since during the construction of the Tiber embankment in the nineteenth century its bed had been very thoroughly searched for antiquities of every age and sort, no confusion could ensue from our calling up its agency. And this was, I believe, then ceremonially carried out. But I was not present for the consignment and do not know from which bridge the material might have been thrown, although I have in memory a vague recollection that it was the Ponte Palatino. I can only report the hearsay of that time. L. Richardson Duke University 1990 The original ledgers held at the American Academy in Rome provide full information on each of the discarded items.

Harmon The sources: Museum the of small the American collection School of vases in and Rome terracottas is composed given in to the the main school of objects in the year drawn 1898-1899 from two sources: the small collection of vases and terracottas given to the school in the year 1898-1899 by Dr. Edmonston Charles of England (Norton, Report in AJA 1900, p. 42), and the larger collec- tion gradually accumulated and deposited as a loan in the school by Mr. Norton. It is to the latter that the museum owes its beginning, but there were only a few objects collected when Dr. Charles' gift was made. Unfortunately it is not possible to determine the exact extent of this gift, for no inventory of it is extant. There are only two documents at hand, both letters, to Dr. Charles dated June 3 and 19, 1889, from a friend who laid the collection on for him at Viterbo (Bazzichelli) and at Orvieto (Mancini). The amount of material from both places seems to have been about the same. Definitely mentioned are only: "two or three prehistoric hand-made vases" and "a sample of chipped flint" from Orvieto (flint missing: vases 291, 292); a cup of bucchero from Bazzichelli "with a row of figures round of Phoenician type" . . . "the figures in procession" (probably 304), "another with raised figures of beasts" (309?, /provenance?), "a large early bucchero jar over a foot in height . . . with curious early patterns on it. Also a large vase with cover." The former is probably 300; the latter is uncertain, but the cover is probably 311. "Some jars etc. of what they call Corinthian ware - not the best which is very scarce but the ordinary with rows of colored strips" refers possibly to 336 and 340. An alabastron from Viterbo "with two or three rows of animals painted on it" seems to be missing. "Two very perfect specimens" of Arezzo ware, both "saucers - one with reliefs on the outside" are also missing in the museum. "A few examples of terracotta weights and bobbins" may include 420-422, 435-437. "A bronze bucket (469) and jug" (perhaps 468) from Orvieto and "a cooking pan (uncertain), strainer (474) and wine ladle" (475) from Viterbo complete the list, with the exception of a cylix from Orvieto mentioned in the second letter, which must be 373. It is pos- sible, however, to complete the list somewhat, for a number of the vases in the museum bear written labels which are due to Mancini, as is stated in one of the letters. These permit the objects bearing them to be assigned to the Charles collection and to Orvieto. Further, many of the terracottas bear a C painted on them, and all these are to be assigned to the gift of Dr. Charles. Mr. Norton's additions to the museum have been in part purchased from time to time in Rome, and in part the result of different expeditions. From his visits to Tunis in 1902 we have the Roman vases 399^407 and the wall-plaques 158-162; from his trip to Turkestan in 1903 the objects men- tioned in the appendix, and from Egypt (1907), besides several objects mentioned in this catalogue a number (now roughly about 170 objects) of Egyptian antiquities of various periods, mainly from Asyût. In addition, the cruise to Asia Minor and among the Greek Islands made in 1904 by Mr. A. V. Armour and Mr. Norton yielded the museum a number of excellent specimens of Cycladic,</page><page sequence="97">82 A. M. HARMON Mycenaean and Cypriote vases and small objects. Gifts from other sources have been few, and, where known, are recorded. In almost no case is it possible to fix the provenance of an object closely. This is especially true of the objects bought in Rome. The specimens, therefore, have a value chiefly intrinsic and individual: their main interest is as illustrative material.</page><page sequence="98">83 Appendix 3.3.

This Thanks is the to case for the three fragments in the storeroom of the American Academy in Rome. Thanks to Van Buren 's report, however, it has been possible to reconstruct their provenance and the acquisi- tion date.1 In these notes we will add some hypotheses regarding the possible functional attributions of the pieces, aware of the difficulty and of the elusive quality of this exercise. Comparisons are not possible because, though Ucelli's publication is exemplary, a detailed study of the wooden structures has not been done. Moreover, due to the destruction of the ships, further studies are impossible.2 The first fragment (inv. no. 9564), of large dimensions, could come from the rescue operation carried out by Eliseo Borghi in 1895 of the "first" and of the "second" ship. It could be a fragment of beam once fixed by nails to stanchions or to other beams. Among the gifts from the "first" ship of Luigi Tacconi in 1935, 3 fragment inv. no. 1119 does not present any particular interest, while inv. no. 1118 is more interesting (fig. 3.3.1). The timber is Fig. 3.3.1. Fragment from the "first" ship from Nemi (inv. no. 1118). 1 See Geffcken, "History of the Collection," in this volume. 2 For the Nemi ships, see Ucelli 1950; some observations on the naval architecture are in Gianfrotta and Pomey 1981, 236-260; Marco Bonino tried to reconstruct the ships from the plans and models made by the Military Marine (Bonino 1989). The Nemi ships, the biggest Roman ships ever found, had characteristics similar to other wrecks found in the Mediterranean area since they belonged to the Greco-Roman tradition of ship construction. Patrice Pomey (Gianfrotta and Pomey 1981, 231) observes that details of the construction of the Nemi ships had not been surveyed. However, the Ro- man ships of Fiumicino, found and salvaged in 1958-1965, provide potentially informative examples of unstudied ships (Boetto 1998; 2000; 2001; in press). 3 See Geffcken, "History of the Collection," in this volume.</page><page sequence="99">84 GIULIA BOETTO broken near one extremity, but its dimensions are known. Preserved are eight holes in which nails, no longer extant, had been driven. Two nails were near the ends, and one in the middle (heads 2.0 cm; shaft squared of 1.0 cm). Five other smaller nails were driven perpendicularly. The piece, which is of small dimensions, with a complex system of joints, could have belonged to the superstructures of the "first" ship or to its furniture. Xylotomic analysis of the timbers provides some new information. Three new species, stone pine (Pinus pinea L.), spruce {Picea abies Karst) and elm (Ulmus cfr. minor Mill.), have been added to the species previously identified by Sibilia:4 Aleppo pine (Pinus halepensis ), fir (Abies pettinata), and oak ( Quercus sessiflora and Quercus peduncolata ).5 4 Ucelli 1950, 151. 5 The analyses were made by Stefano Paci, with the collabora- tion of Gianna Giachi (Florence).

Initially we had planned to publish a full catalogue of the complete collection. When it became clear that the more efficient way to make this material available was through digital technology, it was decided to create a database of the entire collection. For the present volume, the contributors were asked to select particularly important highlights from catalogues they had prepared. This database is now available through the website of the AAR. A few words about the organization of this section : we have divided the material into six major sections, generally according to type of material and medium. Within these larger divisions, the authors have chosen examples of the highlights of each category. For example, under votive figurines, Jean Turfa writes about Etruscan anatomical votive terracottas. One particular section, Pottery and Lamps, is a complex one that includes four major categories. The bulk of the illustrations included in this section are in the collection of the Fototeca Unione housed at the AAR: these are labeled AAR in the captions. They were taken through the years by various photographers, including the authors themselves. While every effort has been made to include all of the major categories of objects in the collec- tion, certain types, such as architectural fragments and glass, are covered only in the database. Other categories, because they have been published elsewhere, are not covered here but are to be included in the database. For these see below, pp. 367-371.

As an aid in locating these, the bays in the Cortile are numbered counterclockwise, begin- ning at the door to the Rare Book Room of the Library. This follows the system used in Raymond Ohls publication of the inscriptions ( MAAR 9 [1931] 90). Since Ohl assigned numbers only to those bays containing inscriptions, it has been necessary to number all the bays, even those with walls left plain and those with doorways, in order to facilitate locating antiquities both immured and set on the floor. The bays are numbered in Roman numerals. See figure ILI for a graphic display of the numeration. Note that right/left and front/back are oriented with respect to the entrance.

Babcock The Acquisition of the Collection It School is not surprising of Classical that Studies from in its Rome inception would in the foster last the decade study of of the inscriptions, nineteenth that century ubiquitous the American source School of Classical Studies in Rome would foster the study of inscriptions, that ubiquitous source of information about the incredibly diverse population of the city and the Greco-Roman world. No other body of material in quantity or in kind brings the modern scholar so near to the people as individuals, as parts of families, as participants in social, political, military, or religious life, be they recorded only as a single slave name on a columbarium tablet, as a much-mourned wife or mother, as a soldier in a cohort of the Praetorian Guard, or as holder of political or religious office. Presence in Rome and accessibility to its vast richness of Latin inscriptions of nearly every kind, not a few actually in situ , certainly were likely to stimulate even the amateur to consider the impact on our knowledge and understanding of the culture that produced them. Gods and humans (and some who claimed to be both) were honored profusely; public works and buildings were labeled to show purpose and benefactor; laws, edicts, political documents of Republic and Empire are found often; calendars and lists of officers of state and proceedings of great religious colleges tell us much; personal and household objects, curse tablets and sling shots, statues and brick stamps and coins enrich our perceptions; and finally, the largest number of all, sepulchral inscriptions speak direcdy of the people themselves.1 That many of these inscriptions are incomplete, often fragmentary, fre- quently because of later reuse in building, is a handicap to study, as is the likelihood that they have been found out of their original context.2 The Schools first recorded acquisition of an inscription was the gift of a funerary cippus by Mr. James Loeb, noted in the annual report of 1895-1896.3 The School began with a teaching as well as a scholarly mission, and in the next year's report Director Warren Minton states that "the school already possesses a number of short inscriptions, and I began a collection of squeezes to become the property of the school." Over the dozen years that followed this modest beginning the collection grew considerably, both by occasional purchases from antiquaries and by gifts. The most significant of the gifts came in 1903-1904, when 41 ancient and a small group of modern inscriptions were presented to the School by Signor Tavazzi from the grounds of his villa (formerly the Villa Bertone 1 Sailer and Shaw (1984) begin their well-known study with the estimate of proportion: "Tombstones furnish perhaps three-quarters of the entire corpus of Latin inscriptions." 2 For some salient cautionary remarks on the problems that occur in the assessment by social historians of the information apparendy provided by sepulchral inscriptions, see Morris 1992, chap. 6. 3 For detailed information on many of these items, refer to the database of the collection (www.aarome.org/research/ resources/ arcaheological-study-collection-database) , where description, comment, and bibliography specific to the individual inscription will be found.</page><page sequence="105">THE INSCRIPTIONS 91 and earlier Vigna Nari), which overlay part of the ancient cemetery between Via Salaria and Via Pinciana. The presence in these years of Ida Elizabeth Bruce, who came as a student in 1899 and remained for some years both as student and volunteer librarian, and her interest in inscriptions did much to stimulate this gift. And A. W. Van Buren had in 1902-1903 begun as a student his almost continuous involvement in School/Academy affairs that was so vital to epigraphical concerns. Add the presence of epigraphist J. C. Egbert as Professor of Latin for good measure to the early develop- ment of an epigraphical cast to the Schools endeavors, for evidence of which see the biographical essays by Professor Katherine Geffcken (pp. 40-48). In that same year Mr. Allison V. Armour invited Director Richard Norton and three students, including Van Buren, to join a cruise on his yacht Utowana to southeast Asia Minor, Crete, and the Cyrenaica, described in chapters 5 and 6 by Hogarth (1910). That this was something of a collect- ing spree is frankly admitted by Mr. Hogarth, speaking of "unashamed quest of forbidden things. It were easy enough now to justify our looting, for, else, those marbles had gone long ago into the limekiln. But I doubt if any one of us thought a moment about justification, as we were loading the whale-boat once and again with spoils of Side. We were filled full of the lust of loot. "4 On this voyage Mr. Armour purchased as a gift to the School a small group of Greek inscriptions (inv. nos. 9288, 9320, 9445-9447). The year also brought the acquisition from a shop in Palestrina (Praeneste) of a large group of mosdy inscribed pineae and bases and of nine forgeries (inv. nos. 9262, 9265, 9269, 9272, 9273, 9296, 9302, 9444, and probably 9267). The next few years saw a number of individual purchases and gifts, including a collection of 1,000 squeezes from the eminent epigraphist Christian Huelsen in 1909-1910. Two years later the School was combined with the American Academy in Rome and moved in 1914 to the new building on the Gianicolo. In 1920-1921, when Professor Ralph Van Deman Magoffin placed great emphasis on epigraphical study, a large selection of inscriptions was installed in the walls of the Library side of the Cortile to form a galleria lapidaria. A major new element was added five years later by the gift by Mrs. G. H. Alcott of sixteen inscriptions from her late hus- band's collection. Since that time acquisition has been relatively limited. In 1929-1930, under the direction of Professors Van Buren and H. A. Sanders, Dr. R. T. Ohl studied all the inscriptions as part of his fellowship and saw to the installation of the majority of those remaining on the left wall of the Cortile to complete the display. The results of his work constituted the major examination of the whole collection.5 Although the passage of time has generally been kind to the inscriptions, several items have since disappeared (inv. nos. 9440, 9444, 9279b and 9279c, 9454 and 9455). Inv. no. 9288 has been removed from its place in the Cortile wall and stored in the magazzino. In connection with the installation of new fire hoses, inv. nos. 9376 and 9377 were moved in 1988-1989 to new locations near the entrance to the offices and the salone, and are therefore out of the numbered order that begins on the Library wall at the right of the entrance stairs of the atrium. A small group of frag- ments (inv. nos. 2237, 6059-6065 and 6069, 6070, 8942, 8943, and 8944) remained unpublished until now. Inv. nos. 9409 and 9410 appear here for the first time as part of the Academy collection. Inv. no. 9456, now missing, is published only from a photograph, and inv. no. 9457 is noted as once having been in the collection; it is now in Stuttgart. 4 Hogarth 1910, 121.

BABCOCK Provenance The provenance of a significant number of the inscriptions in the collection was the large cemetery area north of the city between the Via Pinciana and the Via Salaria, the subject of a number of ex- cavations from the end of the seventeenth through the beginning of the twentieth centuries, and of notable urban development starting in the late nineteenth century. Notizie degli Scavi di Antichità 1886 reveals that at least seventeen of our inscriptions were found in this sepulcretum during that year. Bodel 1992 gives an excellent summary statement of activity in this area, both ancient and modern, with a convenient map in figure 1. For greater detail, see also Tavola 2 of CAR 2; and Lanciani 1989, a convenient reprint of the extraordinary edition of 1893-1901 from Milan. The area in modern times has been variously owned and divided. The late seventeenth century saw a Vigna Albera, or di Alberis; in the early eighteenth century the area was largely a part of a Vigna Nari; and later for a time the Padri Domenicani (Predicatori) were in possession of a part of the estate toward the city, the larger portion by late nineteenth century becoming the property of Cav. Cesare Bertone, who was active in the excavation of the estate. The Villa Bertone was owned by Signor Tavazzi by the first decade of the twentieth century and is sometimes cited by his name. The proprietorship of the area is strikingly illustrated in CIL 6.12317 (1886), our inv. no. 9250, where the location, presumably the same in each instance, is recorded: "Extra Romam in vinea Albera via Salaria MALV(asia, 1690); in vinea Nari via Salaria FABR(etti, 1702) SEG(uier, prior to 1732) MAR(angoni, 1743) GIORGI (before 1733-35). Nunc in vinea PP. Praedicatorum in via Salaria." A similar progression locates inv. no. 9313, CIL 6.20171 (I have filled out the names and added dates). The Purpose and Nature of the Collection The inscriptions of the School and then of the Academy have been a striking part of the history of the institution and have provided an access to antiquity for its residents almost since the founding. They have been thought of as a study collection and many Directors and Professors-in-Charge have so used them. Several, indeed, have indicated acquisition of items useful for teaching purposes. So Director Norton, referring to gifts from several sources, remarks in his report of 1904-1905, "while none of them are of any historical importance, they were all selected for their epigraphical peculiarities, in order to serve as examples for students who are beginning the study of epigraphy." This rather severe characterization should not be taken too broadly; it was written, after all, only ten years into the Schools history. But it is fair to say that the "highlights" of this collection will be found more in the aggregate than in stellar individual items, and in contemplating the persons at hand rather than expecting distinguished deeds or events. There are useful, even unique elements among these records. The key to appreciating the group, however, is in discovering the very real people behind the names or the often minimally descriptive coloration applied to them here. Let me outline briefly the nature of the collection. The probable dates range from the late first century B.c. (inv. no. 9251) to perhaps the fifth or sixth century A.D. (inv. no. 9282 or 9319), with the preponderance falling in the first to third centu- ries A.D. A large majority is funerary in character. Men and women are about equally represented as dedicators; men are more numerous as dedicatees, with women and young children about equally present. Family and family relationships play a large role in the subject matter. Religious concerns, while present by implication in the whole process of death and burial, tend to be more incidental than dominant. So also with the few political items, perhaps largely because of the levels of society</page><page sequence="107">THE INSCRIPTIONS 93 Fig. 4.1.1. Sepulchral tablet of C.

Securely identifiable Christian inscrip- tions are not numerous, but more may be so without such overt Christian symbols as the chi-rho christograms of inv. nos. 9253, 9282, and 9298, or such language as die III Paschae of inv. no. 9260 or the mention of the martyr Castulus in inv. no. 9282. Slaves, freedmen, and freedwomen appear prominendy, including Imperial freedmen of the Flavians (inv. no. 9441) and of Trajan (inv. no. 9274) and a number of slaves of and some freed by unidentified Imperial figures. The collection is broadly representative of many of the conventions and some of the idiosyncracies of ancient epigraphical practice, limited primarily because of the small percentage devoted to other than sepulchral texts. Some Important Individual Items Seven of the inscriptions should be noted as providing information not elsewhere available. Three of these offer otherwise unknown topographical details in somewhat differing ways. Inv. no. 9325 (CIL 6.28644) (fig. 4.1.1) specifies the burial location of a young boy by a grieving father in the great northern cemetery area outside the city as ad Nucem , "at the Nut Tree," a site now accepted by cartographers and students of topography. Another, inv. no. 9371 ( CIL 6.39444) (fig. 4.1.2), is set up by one Iulius to his papas (a "father-figure," perhaps akin to a paedagogus) Eucerus, a flute player, who is identified by his status as a favorite of the Magna Mater of the sixth region of the city. This has been reasonably interpreted as referring to a shrine of the Magna Mater in that region not otherwise attested and now accepted in the topography of the city.6 A third item of topographical detail consists of a cippus marking the boundary between two named gardens, the horti Volusiani and the horti Mar siani, known only from this inscription (inv. no. 9448, AE 1928, 12) (fig. 4.1.3). The cippus contains two versions of this text: Terminus / positus ex / convent(ione) / Ferocis P Liciniani et Aithalis / Augiusti) lih(erti/ae) inter / A boundary stone placed by agreement of Ferox Licinianus and Aithalis, freed by Augustus, between 6Bruun 1996a; 1996b.</page><page sequence="108">94 CHARLES L.

I have used the translation "freed by Augustus" to avoid "freedman or woman" since there has been some question about the reading of the name and which gender is appropriate here. Since Ferox Licinianus was probably consul suffect in A.D. 98, the Augustus referred to is likely a Flavian or one of their immediate successors. Despite the clarity of the text assuring the existence of these two gardens, their actual location is not certain. The Volusii were extensive landowners in and out of the city. These Volusian gardens may have been in the area of the modern Villa Borghese.7 In the Transtiberine area of the Porta Pórtese the Palmyrene community established the cult and a shrine to their patron god Sol Malachbelus. Inv. no. 9318 ( CIL 6.3 1034a) (fig. 4.1.4) is part of a large and beautifully cut inscription announcing the dedication of a major rebuilding of a porticus of the Sun by Gaius Julius Anicetus, which was found in this area in 1887.

The School obtained by private purchase in 1904 a small piece of the municipal fasti from Teanum Sidicinum (Teano) of A.D. 45 and 46 (inv. no. 9450, AE 2008, 385) (fig. 4.1.5). It contains names of some local magistrates for the two years and the consuls and suffects of A.D. 46. Assignment to the Fasti Caleni by Huelsen has been disallowed by both Egbert and Degrassi.8 Inv. no. 9361 (AE 1931, 92) (fig. 4.1.6) establishes the probable existence of a funerary society for members of the familiae of one of the two most powerful Julio-Claudian women, Agrippina the Elder, granddaughter of Augustus and wife of Germanicus, and her daughter of the same name who was sister of Caligula, wife of Claudius, and mother of Nero. L.Valerius Hesper and Valeria Prima are listed with the tide of dec(uńo) coĶlegi) Agrippiniani , and it may be that both actually held the office of the society, whose name is not otherwise known, nor can we be sure which Agrippina is the patron. Finally, inv. no. 9451 (CIL 6.37836) (fig. 4.1.7) is a small victory tablet of the bigarius Menander, from the year A.D. 15.

BABCOCK and C. Norbanus Flaccus. Menander's sponsors (and perhaps owners), C. Cominius Macer and C. Cornelius Crispus, are named, and his victories are reported for the consular Ludi Martiales and the Ludi Victoriae Caesaris , given by praetors P. Cornelius Scipio and Q. Pompeius Macer. In the first he drove the team Basiliscus and Rusticus; in the second, the team Hister and Corax. There is a remarkable amount of prosopographical detail, human and equine. This has been one of the most intriguing of the Academy's inscriptions to scholars, drawn by the consular dating and some problems surrounding it, by the fact that one of the two consuls was Tiberius 's ill-fated son Drusus Caesar, and by some question as to the timing of these Ludi Martiales . The Treatment of Slavery As slavery is a prominent feature in the Greco-Roman world that constitutes the Roman Empire, so slave names and careers, to include those of freedmen and freedwomen, are notably numerous in inscriptions. From the great families' columbaria, the burial chambers of collegia funeraticia , and coundess other tombs of all sizes there exist records - usually the only record - of thousands of slaves. Our understanding of the condition of slavery and the impact, both physical and psychologi- cal, on the slave is tenuous at best. Keith Bradley (1987) has pointed out, particularly in his epilogue, the probable fluctuation between coercion and fear, on the one hand, and humane and even gener- ous treatment on the other, as the likely expectation of many slaves. The roles and circumstances in which slaves found themselves, such as urban or rural, domestic or industrial, are simply too varied to allow much generalization. But it is clear that much depended on the character or even whim of the owner, who could both enforce rigidly the laws and conditions of slavery or allow the cutting of legal corners whereby slaves might enjoy something akin to family life, even marriage. Our collection reflects some aspects of how these conditions of slavery could be recorded at the time of a death, to include the attitudes of owners. It emphasizes that slaves were accorded or allowed to generate the rites of burial in conformity with the Roman commitment to what Toynbee (1971, 37) calls "the continuance of the dead's identity." This may take many different forms in the actual nature or site of burial: a single name badly cut on an undecorated columbarium tablet, "Damalis," inv. no. 9366, or a name granted an identifying assignment, "The ashes of Moschis, maidservant," inv. no. 9291, or a name embellished by that of a prominent owner and by role and age, "Asticus, Licinia's comic actor; he lived eighteen years," inv. no. 9360. At another level there are substantial statements by or about slaves of quite another class, re- flecting privileges or permissions of an often surprisingly tolerant owner or society. Like Asticus, the slaves belong to upper-class or even imperial familiae of slaves, but they have assumed an identity and apparent status far beyond what he could have expected.

To the Spirits of the Dead; to Diadumenus, a well-deserving mate; he lived thirty three years, eleven months, and twenty-three days; Secundilla, the slave of Minicius Faustinus, set this up for herself and for their offspring and all their descendants.</page><page sequence="111">THE INSCRIPTIONS 97 Secundilla, probably a slave of a suffect consul of A.D. 117, establishes a burial place for her deceased "mate" Diadumenus and their family with all the dignity, detail, and style appropriate to a free person. Inv.no. 9442 (CIL 6.23044) D(is) M(anibus); / Nonia Hieronis , q(uae) v(ixit) an(nis) XXXVII; Victorinus, Cae P saris n(ostri) ser(vus), co(n)iugi / b(ene) m(erenti) pientissimae / cum qua / v(ixit) an(nis) XIIII / f(ecit) sibi et suis. To the Spirits of the Dead; Nonia Hieronis, who lived thirty-seven years; Victorinus, slave of our Caesar, to his well-deserving and most dutiful wife, with whom he lived fourteen years, set this up (and) for himself and theirs. Victorinus, slave of a Caesar of probably the mid-first to the mid-second century A.D., addresses his dead wife as coniunx rather than the usual servile contubernalis more properly used by Secundilla, a not unusual liberty taken with the legality of slave unions. Such inscriptions are representative of the data on slave status that have been particularly useful to the work of such scholars as Bradley and Susan Treggiari. Note the mix of slave and freeman association represented by inv. no. 9233 (CIL 6.7887): C(aius) Attius C(ai) l(ibertus) Primigeni[us sibi et] Flaviae Agele uxori poste [risq(ue) suis], Heraclides Domitiae Domitiani tab(ularius) their, sibi et Peloridi coniugi posterisq(ue) suis fecer(unt)}. Gaius Attius Primigenius, freedman of Gaius, set this up for himself and his wife Flavia Agele and for descendants Heraclides, accountant of Domitia, the wife of Domitian, set this up for himself and his wife Peloris and for their descendants. Two couples have prepared a tomb that they and their families will share: a freedman and his wife, and a slave (and bookkeeper) of Domitia with his wife. That this was a substantive structure is implied by the existence of another inscription (CIL 6.7886) by which Attius and Heraclides grant permission for burial in their tomb of a young woman, Vibia, a very common and very practical occurrence. We do not know the nature of the relationship between this freedman and this slave other than that suggested by the nomen of Flavia Agele and its probable connection with the familia of Domitian. But it seems clear that the Imperial slave and the freedman have some parity of posi- tion. And Imperial freedmen and freedwomen, with those of Claudius as extreme examples, often became persons of wealth and power, as the quality of the altar front of T. Flavius Primio suggests. Inv. no. 9441 (CIL 6.8623) Dis Manibus ; / T(iti) Flavi Aug(usti) lib(erti) / Primionis, / a commentar(iis) Aug(usti); P Antonia Methe / coniugi / bene merenti{s} et / T(itus) Flavius Aug(usti) lib(ertus) / Ampliatus frater (seil, fecerunt or posuerunt). To the Spirits of the Dead (and) of Titus Flavius Primio, freedman and secretary of Augustus. Antonia Methe to her well- deserving husband set this up along with Ampliatus his brother. The relationship of patron and former slave is complex, but inscriptions seldom have the capacity to detail a specific tie. One piece in particular perhaps best generalizes on this link, that of Murria Anticléa, who purchases a niche for two jars for herself and her patrons, Q. Murrius</page><page sequence="112">98 CHARLES L. BABCOCK Eros and his wife (inv. no. 9307). Slave and master are legally and socially bound together even after manumission. Military Personnel There is an important group of thirteen inscriptions (inv. nos. 9237, 9245, 9261, 9281, 9292, 9297, 9300, 9330, 9335, 9377, 9351, 8990, 9443) dedicated to/by military personnel that gives useful detail of the ages of service and of life, primarily of soldiers of the Praetorian or Urban Guard or a Praetorian Fleet, of cohorts in which they served, the names of six of their centurions, in addition to those of the men themselves and of some of their families and heirs. Statistical historians find the Roman predilection to state the number of years in inscriptions particularly compelling, and the practice is noteworthy in military epitaphs such as these. Six of this group list years of service and of life: 11/27, 6/25, 9/27, 15/34, 8/26 and, for the member of the fleet, an unusual 24/45. The data in general suggest early enlistment and normally early death, although this certainly need not be attributed to batde since many soldiers, even the privileged praetorians, may not have experienced actual combat. There are three veterani , one honorably discharged (inv. no. 9443) and one (inv. no. 9237) who apparently married a local woman during legionary service in Pannonia Superior. Several special military designations occur, including speculator , op tio, two beneficiarii tribuni , and a tribunus [equitum] promotorům. Inv. no. 9377 will stand as an example of this group, a praetorian soldier from Augusta Praetoria (modern Aosta), eighteen at the time of enlistment, whose friend and comrade provides the memorial stone and burial, probably from the unit s fund to which each soldier will have contributed in anticipation of death as if to a funerary society. Missing is the optional designation of the tribe, although he is probably a citizen. The text is standard, the only likely variation the concluding formula and its abbreviation. Demographically such texts provide information on sources for troops (Italy or the provinces) and on the tribes of certain cities. The pioneering work of Manfred Clauss (1973) is crucial in the study of such military data. Inv. no. 9377 ( CIL 6.32698) D(is) M(anibus); / C(aio) Nigidio / C(ai) {(ilio) luliano, / Augiusta) Pr(aetoria), mil(iti) P coh(ortis) VII pr(aetoriae), (centuriae) / Appi; mil(itavit) ann(is) / VI, vix(it) ann(is) XXV; / P(ublius) Aelius lulianus / hieres ) a(mico) b(ene) m(erenti) f( aciundum ) c(uravit). To the Spirits of the Dead; to Gaius Nigidius Julianus, son of Gaius, from Aug(usta) Pr(aetoria), soldier of the ninth praetorian cohort, century of Appius; he served six years and lived twenty-five; Publius Aelius Julianus as heir saw to setting this up to his well- deserving friend. The Importance of Family and Remembrance I have pointed out that the real stars of this collection are the persons who figure in the inscrip- tions, with secondary honors going to the groups that focus on certain kinds of membership in the Roman fabric. We have seen slaves and military personnel as subjects of two of these groups, still with the individual emerging from the type. A third grouping must certainly be one that places individuals in a context of relationships with others, that is, in family ties by blood or by close association.</page><page sequence="113">THE INSCRIPTIONS 99 The collection includes reference to legitimate marriages with such words as uxor, maritus , and coniunx , and of nearly every grade of blood relationship: pater, mater, filius/a, frater, soros, nepos, neptis , and cognatus. Missing are mention of previous generations, avus/ a, and in-laws. Extended informal ties include tata, nutritor, alumnus, papas , and, of course, patronus/ a. Inv. no. 9248 brings together no less than seven family members in an unusual epitaphic stemma. Pride of years appears yet again in marital unions of various kinds by citing how long the couple remained together: inv. no. 9258 (45 years); inv. no. 9232 (50 years); inv. no. 9317 (28 years); and inv. no. 9343 (20 years). It is in the loss of children, often infants, far too numerous even in this small collection, that the greatest tragedy of family life emerges. Over fourteen epitaphs note the death of children at thirteen years or less - and as young as two. In inv. no. 9243 Titia Prima buries three children who have died at eleven, thirteen, and thirteen, citing also a husband who may have come from servile status. The eloquence of mourning is well served even in a variant of a common formula when C. Vetilius Primitīvus buries an eleven-year-old son - quot debuerat filius patri f acere pater filio fecit - "what a son should have done for his father the father has done for his son" (inv. no. 9325, see fig. 4.1.1). It is important to note from this example the formulaic nature of the texts and style of Roman inscriptions, even of those that reflect moments of extreme sorrow at the loss of the decedent regard- less of age. This implies no lack of feeling; compare our modern tendency to formulaic language and format in obituary notices and on gravestones. Rather it reflects a convenience to the bereaved of having texts from which to choose, the advantage of brevity and abbreviation in the expensive process of burial and in the medium of stonecutting and inscribing, and probably the degree of illiteracy among a good number of those initiating the burial. The lower classes in particular, where proper burial properly conducted seems to have been of high importance, could best achieve their intent through funerary societies and their burial chambers. Nearly all are presumed "well- deserving." If one wished to go further, a list of adjectives or short phrases was at hand: "without any blemish" (inv. no. 9226), "a life without quarrel" (inv. no. 9255), "beyond compare" (inv. no. 9237), "true and beloved" (inv. no. 9343), "most dutiful" or "sweetest" (inv. no. 9248). And this moment of personal commitment offers those to whom it was applicable and who could afford it the opportunity to ensure proper burial to their children and dependents and generations following: sibi et suis libertis libertabusque posterisque eorum. Peroration This is a study collection. We have seen how it was assembled and the teaching goal in most of the acquisitions. There is no pretense to completeness of subject or genre. The Greek components are of accidental subject, and several are of greater textual richness. There are certain inscriptions that offer unique information. There are several categories whose detail is of value to the scholar and that give the viewer insights into a class or a profession or a set of relationships. There are examples of epigraphic techniques (and some errors), such as abbreviation and syllabic interpunctuation, of language adjustments or errors such as syncope, spelling to pronunciation, and shift of letters to achieve sound (e.g., v and b). Lettering varies from the high monumental quality to more modest styles, to approaches strongly influenced by common or cursive script, and, finally, to inexpensive simplicity or crudeness and on occasion carelessness. Guidelines, shading, serifs, nexus, and liga- tures are generously demonstrated. In sum, those who assembled the collection provided much to the student.</page><page sequence="114">100 CHARLES L. BABCOCK Fig. 4.1.8. Columbarium tablet of Phryne (inv. no. 9347). Memorials to two young women will form our peroration. They represent in quite different ways what the collection offers: the ability to make meaningful both formula and the expected, whether through simplicity and brevity or a more discursive statement; an achievement of re-creating the person, whether through full detail or through suggestion, where even the name is missing; and the imprinting of a memory of a real individual on the viewer, one of the highest goals of the Latin epitaph.

Vale et tu. Phryne, Tertulia 's (slave and) spinning woman, from Africa, rests here. She lived seventeen years. She brought pleasure to her patron without any fault as long as she lived. She left no one who thought ill of her. Then, when she ought to have been blooming, she met her death. She was precious to those to whom she wished to be so. You too, farewell. Phrynes epitaph is modest in size, of reasonable quality in design and execution, and simple in both message and effect. It has all the necessary elements: her name, that of her owner, her do- mestic responsibilities, her place of birth (strikingly emphasized by arrangement), and the number of years she lived. The viewer has all the information needed to evoke the image of this young slave and to build at least in imagination what her short life must have been. The very lack of descriptive detail provides a challenge in reconstructing her picture, the circumstances of her existence, and the reasons for an early death. 9 Zarker 1958, no. 11.</page><page sequence="115">THE INSCRIPTIONS 101 Fig. 4.1.9. Setting for a columbarium urn to an unnamed woman (inv. no. 9373). On the other hand, the young woman of inv. no. 9375, although her name may well have ap- peared on the missing upper portion of the tablet, is essentially recreated almost completely from the characteristics her patron chose to emphasize in this small tribute. What is missing for Phryne is very explicit here: clearly charming, knowledgeable of how to deal with people, careful not to antagonize, enough sure of herself to choose those whom she wished to please, and dead just as she was reaching her youthful prime. Probably a (former?) slave, perhaps now a freedwoman, certainly one whose charms of all kinds were of importance to her relationships. The two types of inscription, the two types of information offered, the demand placed on the passing observer all speak to the special attractiveness of this collection. "Traveller, read this and remember me!"10 Acknowledgments First it must be noted that in republishing the inscriptions of the American Academy in Rome one is inevitably repeating a large amount of the material and detail in the only preceding general work on this collection, Ohl 1931, 89-133 and plates 5-9. Ohls difficult task as a Fellow was extensively modified by Professor A.W. Van Buren (see there the editorial note on p. 89 and the rather frequent use of "we" in the text), and the senior scholar clearly played an extraordinary role in the final form of the work. Ohl established a number for each inscription considered, in part relating to the display location in the Academy Cortile and atrium, and that number appears in his catalogue of inscrip- tions (114-128) and is adopted in the present work for practical reasons, with additional numbers appended for the small group of newly published items at the end. This repetition, modification, and 10 A common address to the passerby perhaps best expressed by an inscription from the pavement of S.

BABCOCK expansion of that volume expresses my appreciation of the accomplishment of Ray Ohl, my colleague in the Philadelphia Classics community for nine years, and A.W. Van Buren, who was devotedly at his desk in the Academy Library during my fellowship years 1953-1955. With the exception of the Palestrina grave cippus, I have tried to bring together in one location the descriptive data on the collection to which Ohl frequently merely referred, to provide additional or initial description or measurement, to assure a comprehensive collection of photographs (some for the first time) of all but the few missing items, and to update the bibliography. It was my good fortune to be at the Academy during part of the fellowship year (1990-1991) of Professor J. Clayton Fant of the University of Akron, who generously examined this largely immured collection and made visual identification of many of the marble types. (See editors' note below.) Many have given assistance, advice, and understanding in this process. At the Academy Li- brarians Lucilla Marino and Christina Huemer and their efficient staff were always responsive to my questions and needs. Dottoressa Karin Einaudi of the Fototeca Unione offered me continuing interest, encouragement, and technical assistance during several visits to the Academy, including the arrangements with photographer Lorenzo Scaramella for his skilled recording of many unphoto- graphed inscriptions. Professor David Wright has been kind to complete that task. Mellon Professors Russell T. Scott, Malcolm Bell III, and Elizabeth Fentress have been helpfully responsive whenever asked. Professor Silvio Panciera was as always generous with his knowledge and his time and with his colleagues made available the facilities and bibliographic information at the Istituto per Epigrafia Latina at the University of Rome "La Sapienza." My colleague Professor A. G. Woodhead puzzled with me over one of the undecipherable Greek inscriptions and Professor Eva Margareta Steinby of the Istituto Finlandese and later of Oxford University, in addition to a join, made other useful comments. Directors of the Academy Joseph Connors and Caroline Bruzelius and their whole staff responded with interest to any need. The editors of this undertaking, Professors Larissa Bonfante and Helen Nagy, have been heroically patient and encouraging to all their authors; our gratitude to them is indeed great. To Ili Nagy I owe special thanks for extra measurements, as to Bartley Brown and Jon Babcock. Dr. Jacquelyn Collins-Clinton's contributions of editorial efforts, collaborative conversations, and help in Rome have been extraordinary. At The Ohio State University Mary Cole and Dianne Meade, and at Hope College Joy Forgwe, have with admirable expertise and gift of time coped with my amateurish battles with computers. In our Center for Epigraphical and Palaeographical Studies Curator Wendy Watkins has with enduring good humor provided gra- cious, expert, and invaluable support to the process. Also in the Center, Research Associate Philip Forsythe and Dr. Paul Iversen have been sources of friendly and knowledgeable assistance, as has my departmental colleague Professor Joseph Tebben. My wife Mary has brought her continued affectionate understanding to the whole project. To all of these, and to the many members of the Academy community who watched, wondered, and shared good will in the often chilled air of the Cortile, my warm appreciation. The results are my responsibility; that there have been results is much owed to all of them. The complete collection of the inscriptions is forthcoming in C. L.

An Etruscan Funerary Relief from Chiusi Larissa Bonfante The three-sided only Etruscan Archaic sculpture relief.1 Surprisingly, in the Academy's not long collection ago this is fragment a fragmentary was found base to (inv. be remarkably no. 473), a three-sided Archaic relief.1 Surprisingly, not long ago this fragment was found to be remarkably similar in form, decoration, and measurements to another fragment, also in Rome.2 The two frag- ments, which were both acquired in Rome at the beginning of the twentieth century, must originally have belonged to the same monument from Chiusi. Their provenance can be recognized from the fact that they are made of the pietra fetida or tufa normally used for these monuments from Chiusi, and from the style, also typical of these reliefs. They are now in the collections of the American Academy and of the German Archaeological Institute (DAI), respectively. At the time that Jean-René Jannot first published them, in 1976, he expressed doubts as to their authenticity.3 He later changed his mind and sent me valuable remarks on the pieces as well as drawings of possible reconstructions. We can now study the fragments in his 1984 publication of all known relief cippi from Chiusi, the first since Paribenis of 1938-1939.4 The piece in the Academy collection (figs. 4.2.1-3) was bought in 1907 in Rome by Richard Norton.5 It is a large fragment, preserved in its entire length along the front and two sides. The lower portion of the relief and the base molding are missing, and the present surface of the break is fractured. The height of the fragment (ca. 27 cm) represents some threee-quarters to four-fifths of the original monument, which apparently had an original height of over 40 cm.6 The surface of the relief is in a fair state of preservation, with only a few incrustations, mostly on the front relief panel. The rectangular fragment is decorated on three sides, with the back left undecorated. On the long front panel (B, fig. 4.2.2) the ornamental bands at the two corners are both preserved. The reliefs on the two shorter sides are framed by similar decorated bands (A, fig. 4.2.1; C, fig. 4.2.3), but the surface of the band on the corner, to the left of the banquet scene (A), has been chipped away. Only the upper part of the relief scene is preserved. The lower section of each 1 Fragmentary base, no. 4 (H473), bought in 1907 by Richard Norton and left on extended loan to the Academy, which acquired it on his death in 1918.

At some time in the past a cylindrical cutting (ca. 32 cm diam.) was carved out of the back. It was carried out in a careless fashion and is not symmetrical. It might be an ancient hole made by the Etruscans themselves in order to receive funeral ashes, or it could have been made in modern times, perhaps in the nineteenth or early twentieth century. On the top surface, an irregular, roughly circular hole (17 cm deep) with a channel running to it from the front is likely to have been made by the Etruscans in order to hold a dowel that originally served to fasten some kind of stone object: perhaps a column or a bulb-shaped marker like those on top of many of these bases.7 The top molding forms a deep overhang,8 below which runs a flat narrow band. A narrower flat ribbon band, or listello , frames the relief scenes of the two side panels. On the funeral scene of the front panel (B, fig. 4.2.2), instead, a heavy curtain, or parapetasma , is rolled up and fastened at intervals by narrow fiat bands or ribbons, forming a scalloped design above the heads of the figures. A band of connected spirals with central dot or "running dog" pattern frames the sides of the reliefs; it is still preserved on both sides of the front panel, to the right of the banquet on side A, and to the left of side C.

A young musician plays the double pipes, holding them out horizontally as he faces the banqueters to the right. The lower part of his tight-fitting chiton clings tighdy to his bulging thighs: sleeves and neckline are indicated in relief, while three parallel lines on shoulder and upper arm indicate the seam on the right sleeve. His folded mantle hangs vertically from his left arm. His hair fits like a visor on his forehead and hangs down on his back and over his right shoulder; the rest of his hair was probably indicated with paint. To the right, two banqueters recline on a bed piled high with blankets, whose edges hang in folds at both ends.11 The decoration of the top of the beds flat tapering legs is a common type: the front leg has an Aeolic column and abacus, the back a simple rounded cushion top.12 Under the bed - but meant to be in front of it - appears the top of the table, or trapeza , holding bowls with food. The banqueters, a couple, a man and a woman, as usual in Etruscan art,13 wear garlands on their heads and mantles draped about their lower bodies. The man is bare- chested, with deep grooves indicating the pectoral muscles, below which the upper folds of his rounded bordered mantle, or tebenna , form a ridge. The mantle is held in place under his left arm and is awkwardly represented, so that it seems to extend beyond his torso on either side. His hair is long in the Ionian fashion, and his elongated Ionian profile sports a beard starting under the left ear. His upraised right hand holds an object - perhaps an egg, a frequent attribute held by men in Etrus- can banquet scenes, appropriate for the banquet and at the same time symbolic of the afterlife.14 The woman looks toward her husband, gesturing toward him with her right hand, which may also have held an object, once rendered in paint. In her left hand she holds a phiale. Her profile is similar to that of the man but less well preserved. She wears a garland over a pointed hairstyle, or tutulus, covered with a veil, visible as a ridge over her right shoulder. The folds of her thin Ionic chiton fall from her shoulders in parallel grooves, and a mantle covers her from the waist down, its upper fold draped below her right arm and over an awkwardly rendered left arm.15 The relief on side B shows a funeral scene, the laying out of the dead, or prothesis (fig. 4.2 .2). 16 Three mourners approach the funerary couch from the left. The first figure on the left is a woman wearing a chiton and a mande over her head and falling down her back as far as the knees. Her right hand is raised up to her face, her left holds up a fold of the thin chiton skirt in a typically Archaic gesture. The figure in front of her, also a woman,17 holds out her hands, palms up. Her mande has fine folds and is worn draped under the right arm and over the left arm and shoulder; her long hair is cut in short bangs over her forehead. The third figure, a man, raises his arms above his head in a Cesnola Painter in the formation of the Orientalizing style of Etruria, Latium, and Campania. For a closely related pattern on the Archaic "lastroni a scala" of Tarquinia, see Bruni 1991, 43 n. 22, with references. 10Jannot compares it to that of Palermo 8382: Jannot 1984, 26, Bill, figs. 108-110. 1 1 As usual on Etruscan couches, for example on the Pontic vase by the Paris Painter in the Metropolitan Museum: von Bothmer 1955-1956, 127-132.

Two mourning women, with loose hair and wearing chitons with pointed sleeves, are embrac- ing him; one embraces his knees, the other has her arm around his upper chest and holds his head. A third woman, distinguished from the other mourners by her dress - a band over her long hair, a tight-fitting chiton, and a mande with folds - stands at the head of the bed and holds the dead mans head cradled in her hands. The scene seems to take place in a tent or outdoor pavilion, judging by the folded canopy or awning {parapetasma) , rolled up and tied by ribbons or straps at regular intervals.19 On side C the scene is an armed dance (fig. 4.2 .3). 20 Two fully armed warriors move to the right. They brandish spears or javelins, once indicated with paint, in their upraised right fists, and wear cuirasses with wide shoulder flaps and fringed leather lappets over their short chitons. The handles and armbands of the round shields they hold in their left hands are clearly visible; the shield of the warrior on the left overlaps and obscures the upraised right arm of the man in front of him. They appear to be part of a larger group of dancing or marching armed warriors: the empty space in front of the warrior to the right adds to the sense of movement. The cheekpieces, or paragnathides , of their helmets are lowered. Most curious is the way the top border cuts off the sweeping crest of the second helmet and some of the warrior s arm, so that the scene almost seems to take place behind a frame that cuts off parts of the figures. A similar fragment in the German Archaeological Institute in Rome represents an armed dance, with three warriors and a group of three men moving toward the right (fig. 4.2.4).21 As on our piece, only the upper portion survives, including a flat, worked upper surface, with a cutting like ours for a dowel to hold a stone marker or column. And as in the case of the side reliefs of the Academy, the panel with the armed dance is almost complete in its entire length: the decorated relief band on the right side is preserved, and an edge of the band on the left is still visible. It is thus the mirror image of ours. There are three warriors, moving to the left. The first two, seen from the back, are similar to ours in pose and dress, with helmets and armor, holding shields in their left hands and spears or javelins in their raised right hands - they look like mirror images of the two warriors on our relief. The center shield is shown in profile; the ones on either side are shown from the front, like musical full notes separated by a half note. The warrior in the center is bearded; the chin of the one on the left is obscured by his shield. The third warrior, who is beardless and turns his head away from his comrades, is crowded into the right quarter of the relief, as though on a different plane. Here again the upper frame cuts off the soldiers' crested helmets, so that the scene seems to take place outside a window or frame. On the relief in the DAI this impression is emphasized by 18 Or perhaps a knee-length poncho, a style frequently worn by male figures on reliefs from Chiusi: Bonfante 2003, 51. 19 This is frequently shown in the representation of wakes or banquets in Etruscan art. For a canopy on a scene of a wake on a relief from Chiusi in Florence, see Jannot 1984, 27-28, B II 2a, fig. 112; and on a round base in Palermo, Jannot 1984, 30, B II 6, figs. 123-125.

Jannot 1976 compares the two and dates both fragments 510-490 B.c.

Fragmentary corner of a cippus ( inv . no. 70.1650) ( Rome ; Deutsches Archäologisches Institut). the crowded figure on the right, an arrangement contrasting with the empty space of the relief in the American Academy. The second scene of the relief in the German Archaeological Institute is more fragmentary (fig. 4.2.4), a diagonal break having cut off all but the head and hand of the right-hand figure. The figures to the left and center are preserved, like the warriors, to mid-torso. They move from left to right, like the group approaching the deceased on the left-hand side of the central panel of our relief. The first figure on the right holds an object, perhaps a musical instrument;22 while the fol- lowing two hold up their hands, palm outward.23 Judging from their hairstyles, they are all men. Their heads form a rhythmic pattern, with similar profiles - pointed noses, shoulder-length hair, and ears shaped like reversed question marks. The left-hand figure has bangs, the second sports visorlike front hair; the smooth backs of the head were evidendy once finished with paint. For all these styles we can compare those shown on our prothesis relief (fig. 4.2.2). The Academy prothesis relief and the DAI group (figs. 4.2.2 and 4.2.4) present other striking stylistic similarities, such as the profiles of the left-hand figure of the DAI relief (fig. 4.2.4) and of the central, female figure of the group of the Academy base (fig. 4.2.2). Bangs, ears shaped like question marks, nose, chin, and mouth are all similar, though the figure on our relief wears her hair long. Jannot sees the hairstyles of the two groups as typical of an earlier period (51(M90 b.c.), and the rendering of the locks of hair, thick necks, heavy barrel chests, straight profile, small mouth and chin, and shoulders held back of a particular workshop, strongly suggesting that the two relief fragments were made in the same workshop, if not actually by the same craftsman.24 They also share a funerary theme, though the gestures of the two groups are different - those on our relief express grief and mourning, while the figures with upraised, outwardly facing palms of the relief in the German Archaeological Institute seem to take part in a different kind of religious ritual - perhaps a sacrifice or another part of a mourning scene. Finally, striking similarities connect the upper moldings and the ornamentation, as well as the form and dimensions of the bases, which, as we saw, must originally have stood 40 cm when complete. Similarities of form, style, iconography, and dimensions, then, all lead to the conclusion that the two reliefs once belonged together. These similarities had once led Jannot to doubt the authenticity 22 Massai Dräger 1997, 116. Cf. Jannot 1984, 139, 142. 23 Jannot 1984, 33 connects the gesture with a sacrifice; cf. the relief in the Louvre, Jannot 1984, fig. 105. 24 Jannot 1976, 217-218 places this relief in time between a base in Palermo (8429), and one in Florence (93488, Paribeni 1938, 82).</page><page sequence="124">1 10 LARISSA BONFANTE Fig. 4.2.5. Possible reconstructions of original monument (Jannot). of at least parts of the fragments, but he is now convinced that, on the contrary, they guarantee their antiquity. Indeed, several features of the bases can be matched on other reliefs from Chiusi and speak in favor of their authenticity.25 The two reliefs in the German Institute and all three in the American Academy are complete on the top and sides. They were part of two separate blocks or bases. Both monuments originally had a long relief in front, like side B of ours (fig. 4.2.2), and two parallel reliefs on the sides, like our sides A and C (figs. 4.2.1 and 4.2.3). The back was unfinished and the whole monument made to be seen from the front. Though the fragments were surely related, the original form and function of the monument to which they belonged is hard to reconstruct. Lucy Shoe Meritt was unable to see the fragment in the American Academy when she was re- cording items for her study of Etruscan and Roman moldings in 1950;26 she had this to say in 1995 about the piece to Ingrid Edlund-Berry: "By examining the drawings [by Jannot] and photographs and reading your text, Lucy [Shoe Meritt] agrees with you [LB] that the piece is not part of a stan- dard Chiusi cippus because of the proportions of the deep cavetto molding and the quarter round. She believes that the piece is genuine, and that it may have been used together with the fragment at the German Institute, because the moldings on these two pieces are close enough, but not identical (judging by the photographs and Jannot s profile drawings). Maybe the two pieces were made by different craftsmen for a double base?"27 Based on his extensive experience with this type of monument, Jannot has suggested a number of different possibilities (fig. 4.2.5). The bases in the DAI and in the American Academy could have 25 Jannot 1984, 32-33. On the Academy base, the shape of the folds on the garments of the group on the left in the prothesis (side B) can be compared to Palermo 8373; the attitude of the man on the same side is similar to that found on a round base from Perugia (634). A fragmentary relief in the museum in Chiusi, which still has the original red color on the borders of the mandes, is also, like ours, carved out in back: from Chianciano, loc. La Pedata, Tomba B. It was found in 1985, "nel crollo della volta" of a tomb in località Morelli, and dates from the end of the sixth or the beginning of the fifth century B.c.: Rastrelli 1986, 79-83 , color pls.

Given the symmetry of the decorative borders, however, and of the closely related war dances on both fragments, a double base is more prob- able. The two parts of the same monument, made by different craftsmen, may have paralleled each other as twin productions in an architectural unit such as a funerary naiskos , as bases for pilasters or columns, or as sections that protruded in a U-shaped monument, topped with the usual bulb- shaped cippi or a seated statue. Jannot has considered such a reconstruction.28 Michael Lesky29 agrees with a reconstruction of the two warrior scenes as mirror images seen from front and back, facing each other on a double-based monument and moving in a circular dance, like two halves of a chorus joining together.30 We can imagine the funerary memorial to which the two bases belonged as an original and im- portant architectural monument in early fifth-century B.c. Chiusi.31 There seem to be no precedents for such a form, however. The atypical spiral ornaments of the borders and moldings point to an unusual type of monument, different from the usual rectangular cippi bases. Like the others, it was originally brighdy colored, with the borders of the mandes and the canopy set off in red paint, and the hair and other details that were barely sketched in by the sculptor completed in color. Further research or new discoveries, we hope, will help to resolve the intriguing question of the original placement of these two closely related fragments, and of the reconstruction of the unique monu- ment to which they once belonged. 28 Jannot, letter of 23 September 1992. In his 1984 corpus (33) he had thought it rather improbable that the two frag- ments belonged together. 29 Lesky 2000, 203. 30 Bonfante 2001, 196: or like soldiers attacking? 31 See Iozzo 1996, 54, who points out the independence of the craftsmen from Chiusi, their "libertà di ispirazione e creatività."

Greek and Roman Sculpture ]acquelyn Collins-Clinton Composition and Organization The 180 collection pieces of of freestanding stone and marble statuary sculpture and reliefs at the of Egyptian, American Cycladic, Academy Greek, in Rome Etruscan, contains Roman, almost 180 pieces of freestanding statuary and reliefs of Egyptian, Cycladic, Greek, Etruscan, Roman, Palmyrene, and Early Christian workmanship. The collection includes, as well, six pieces that may be considered post-antique, of modern workmanship but inspired by recognizably ancient models, inv. nos. 4, 9073, 9416, 9071, 9204, 14. The largest group is the Roman material, which comprises copies after Greek originals, Roman works not copied in every detail after Greek originals, small fragments of statuary, pieces of furniture or furnishings, and reliefs of a dedicatory, historical, or architectural nature. By far the largest group of reliefs is funerary. Most are fragments of sarcophagi produced in Rome, but there are a few pieces certainly produced by workshops in Asia Minor and a few examples of Palmyrene funerary reliefs. Seven fragments defy classification, of which inv. nos. 9173, 9153, 9215 are most likely from reliefs; inv. nos. 9042, 9039, 9198, 9218 could also be from statuary. Finally there are five fragments of metropolitan Roman sarcophagi that present subjects or motives of an Early Christian nature. The largest category, the sarcophagi produced in Rome, comprises some 68 fragments from the front of the chest. Although sometimes difficult to identify with absolute certainty, most of these present enough iconographical clues to permit a classification, only very occasionally rather tentative, according to the subject matter depicted on the entire front of the sarcophagus. These are arranged in the catalogue according to the organization of sarcophagi in the vast corpus begun by Carl Robert, Die Antiken Sarkophagreliefs (ASR).1 Most of the sculptural material is on view in the main building of the Academy. Several, includ- ing some large pieces, form a small sculpture gallery in the entrance atrium, and a great number of small reliefs, fragments broken from reliefs or statuary, or even small statuettes are embedded in or attached to the walls of the Cortile.2 Altogether they comprise sculptures acquired, for the most part, by the two schools that came together in 1913 to form the American Academy in Rome as it is today: the School of Classical Studies and the School of Fine Arts.3 The collection of sculpture is 1 Not all have been published to date, but an oudine of all published and forthcoming volumes and fascicles is included in Koch 1993, 206-208. 2 On the arrangement of these pieces, see above, pp. 87-89. The rest are in storage. 3 The School of Classical Studies opened in the fall of 1895 as the American School of Classical Studies in Rome (des- ignated herein as the old School of Classical Studies or old Classical School for short). The School of Fine Arts began in 1894 as the American School of Architecture; this became the American Academy in Rome in 1897. The two entities shared quarters in the year 1895-1896 but separated when the old School of Classical Studies found that it required larger accommodations. The two schools finally came to- gether permanendy in 1913 to form the American Academy in Rome as it is today. For the historical background, see Valentine and Valentine 1973; Yegiil 1991; and K. Geffcken, in this volume, especially under Richard Norton and Arthur L. Frothingham, Jr.</page><page sequence="128">1 14 JACQUELYN COLLINS-CLINTON unique within the collection of antiquities as a whole in that it includes mostly objects acquired by the School of Fine Arts.4 Of the total of 178 sculptural pieces, only 26 came to the Academy from the archaeological collection of the old School of Classical Studies. A. M. Harmon, Fellow of the old Classical School, included these in an inventory made between 1905 and 1901 ? In addition, six inscribed pieces, catalogued by R. T. Ohl in 1931 and not included in Harmons "Catalogue," also belonged to the old School of Classical Studies.6 These two groups yield 32 pieces from the old Classical School. The force behind the acquisition of a "study collection" of archaeological material, including sculpture, by the School of Classical Studies was Richard Norton, the first Professor of Archaeology (1897-1899) and then Director from 1899 to 1907. His interest is a matter of record;7 and Harmons "Catalogue" contains the notation that "Mr. Norton made significant additions to the collection of objects in the museum of the American School in Rome [sic]."8 These are inv. nos. 21, 9405-9407, 28, 29-31 and 9563, 471, 472, 8990, 19, 11, 18, 20, 16, 17, 15, 27, 26, 24, 4, altogether 18 of the 26 sculptural pieces listed in Harmon s "Catalogue." A few objects arrived in the Academy's collection through the generosity of certain donors with close connections to the old School of Classical Studies. Thomas Ashby, the British archaeologist, gave the Egyptian statuette in 1924 (inv. no. 1604).9 Allison V. Armour gave two pieces. Inv. no. 14 is a modern relief depicting an "Addolorata" scene in which the Madonna, wearing the diadem of a pagan deity, laments the death of her son, depicted as a child in burial clothes. Inv. no. 13 is a por- tion of the lid of an Asia Minor sarcophagus depicting a frieze of cupids hunting (fig. 4.3.17a-b).10 A. W. Van Buren gave three pieces. One is a small female head, inv. no. 12. The second, a Hellenistic relief, inv. no. 6279 (fig. 4.3.2), was given in 1944, and a third, a small terminal bust, inv. no. 8958, was part of his bequest to the Academy when he died in 1968. Van Buren 's wife, Elizabeth Douglas Van Buren, gave one marble sculpture, a statuette of a horse, that she purchased at Olympia in 1909 (inv. no. 8771); this came to the Academy in 1959 along with nearly 100 other pieces.11 Professor F. E. Brown, former Professor-in-Charge of the School of Classical Studies and Director of the Academy between 1965 and 1969, left two pieces, fragments of reliefs, each depict- ing a helmeted head (inv. nos. 9428 and 9429, figs. 4.3.10 and 4.3.11). After one takes into account the 32 pieces from the old School of Classical Studies and the five gifts made after 1914, 142 pieces of the total of 178 stone sculptures must have been acquired 4 This is true also of the collection of stone architectural pieces. 5 The Harmon "Catalogue" is an unpublished MS in the Library of the American Academy in Rome. In the con- cordance, Harmon numbers are added to the Academy's inventory number for each piece that has one. On Harmon's "Catalogue," see pp. 81-82. 6 For the sculptural pieces, see Harmon "Catalogue," nos. 1-3, 5, 7-8, 11, 13-24, 26, 28-33, and 37.

While resident in Italy he served as an agent arranging purchases of antiquities for wealthy American collectors. He must have been a regular frequenter of Roman antiq- uity shops and must have kept up with new archaeological discoveries. See Geffcken, in this volume, pp. 27-28 for further information on the formation of the collection of archaeological material by the old School of Classical Studies. 8 Harmon "Catalogue," 1.

Most of these are the small fragments in the Cortile walls or larger pieces of statuary in the entrance atrium, as mentioned above.12 Unfortunately the architects and artists did not record their sculptural acquisitions, so that there is no equivalent of Harmon s "Catalogue" for these pieces. G. P. Stevens, Director of the School of Fine Arts, made the only existing references to such a collection in his diary when he supervised the moving of the sculptures from the Villa Mirafiori, seat of the old American Academy in Rome.13 He also noted "the arrangement of many antique fragments" as one of the many details that required his attention in the last months before the move to the new Academy building in October 1914. 14 Provenances "In almost no case is it possible to fix the provenance of an object closely," wrote A. M. Harmon in the introduction to his "Catalogue" (p. 2). He noted further that this is especially true of the objects bought in Rome. These remarks pertain not only to the sculptural pieces listed in Harmon s "Catalogue" but also to the material that had been in the old American Academy. This must have been acquired between 1894, when the AAR began to function, and 1914, when the newly unified American Academy in Rome moved into the new building on the Janiculum.15 These were busy days in the urban history of Rome, which was experiencing a vast building boom in the aftermath of the unification of Italy and the establishment of Rome as its capital.16 New neighborhoods sprang up, expanding well outside the ancient Aurelian Walls. Old properties even within those walls were sold and developed; the Boncompagni-Ludovisi estate between the Pincian and Salarian Gates, sold in 1885, is a case in point.17 The earthmoving operations involved in these endeavors revealed antiqui- ties, including sculptures of all sorts, on a scale that overwhelmed the archaeological authorities. Some of this must have made its way into the hands of dealers and from them to members of the Academy, for it is very likely that most of the sculptural material in the Academy's collection was purchased from dealers in Rome.18 Indeed, of the 173 ancient sculptures, only 13 are not Roman 12 See also above, pp. 87-89 (description of Cortile). K. Geffcken has come to the same conclusion; personal com- munication, 16 January 1997. 13 The entries in his diary for 18 and 19 August 1914 men- tion transferring statues from the Villa Mirafiori. See the Diaries of G. P. Stevens, Library, American Academy in Rome. I am grateful to Katherine Geffcken for directing me to these diaries. 14 These would have included sculptures from both Schools. See Stevens 1914, 48. 15 On the early history, see above, n. 3. Very few gifts and bequests of sculptural material were received after 1914: inv. nos. 1604, 6279, 8771, 8958. Objects acquired by the old Classical School between 1907, when A. M. Harmon completed his "Catalogue," and 1914 were not noted by A. W. Van Buren when he began his inventory where Harmon had ended. 16 Krautheimer 1980 includes photographs of the city taken between ca. 1870 and 1900. These show open, cultivated spaces both inside and outside the Aurelian Walls; see figs. 20, 22, 61, and 199. Figure 203 is particularly eloquent. Taken from the Vatican Palace ca. 1880, it shows some modern buildings already constructed nearby and then open fields, the prati , and broad expanses sweeping northward toward the mountains. The emptiness is striking. A brief description of these vast real estate projects and the resulting archaeo- logical and topographical discoveries appears in Bertoletti 1997, 23-24. 17 On the sale of this estate, see below, pp. 117-118. For this estate and others, see also Lanciani 1988, 171-172, 174. 18 See the comments of Lanciani 1988, 172. Most of the inscriptions in the Academy's collection were obtained from dealers in Rome; see Backcock, in this volume, p. 92, who surmises that many may have come from the cemetery between the Via Pinciana and the Via Salaria adjacent to the Aurelian Walls and not too far from both the Casino Aurora, where the old American Academy resided, and the places where the old School of Classical Studies resided between 1895 and 1905. Since the cemetery continued in use, after a brief hiatus, from the mid-second century through the third</page><page sequence="130">1 16 JACQUELYN COLLINS-CLINTON in either time or place of manufacture, and the provenance of most of these is recorded. The three Cycladic figurines came from the de Cigalla Collection on the island of Thera in 1904 (inv. nos. 1-3, fig. 4.3.1). 19 The two Greek pieces were gifts of the Van Burens (inv. no. 6279, fig. 4.3.2, and inv. no. 8771). 20 The three Palmyrene reliefs were purchased by R. Norton in Palmyra in 1904 (inv. nos. 27, 26, 24, fig. 4.3. 18).21 The one Egyptian example, a gift of Thomas Ashby, certainly came from Egypt as its form, style, and material suggest (inv. no. 1604). 22 Last, three of the four pieces from sarcophagi of Asia Minor manufacture were almost certainly obtained in Asia Minor: two came from Side in Pamphylia (fragments of a lid, inv. no. 13, fig. 4.3.17a-b, and a female head, inv. no. 12), 23 and an ossuary almost certainly came from either Side or Adalia (inv. no. 8825a-c, fig. 4.3. 16).24 Since there is no record of a provenance for the fragment of a Docimium sarcophagus (inv. no. 15) nor for one perhaps from Aphrodisias (inv. no. 9505) and since sarcophagi of this type were exported to Rome in antiquity, the Academy's pieces may have been acquired either in Rome or abroad. Several sculptures from the archaeological collection of the old School of Classical Studies were purchased in the eastern Mediterranean during a cruise with the School's wealthy benefactor, Allison V. Armour, on his yacht, the Utowana , in the spring of 1904. 25 Several members of the School were on board, including Director Richard Norton and A. W. Van Buren. The yacht put in at Thera, Side, and possibly also Bodrum, where sculptural items were obtained. From Thera came the three Cycladic figurines, a gift from A. V. Armour (inv. nos. 1-3, fig. 4.3.1). From Side came the set of fragments of the lid of an Asia Minor sarcophagus, a joint gift of Armour and R. Norton (inv. no. 13, fig. 4.3.17a-b), and a small female head, a gift from A. W. Van Buren (inv. no. 12). Possibly also from Side is the ossuary belonging to a type common in Pamphylia (inv. no. 8825a-c, fig. 4.3. 16).26 A Hellenistic relief depicting a priestess, a gift of A. W. Van Buren who purchased it at Bodrum (inv. no. 6279, fig. 4.3.2), may also have been acquired on this cruise. A provenance can now be assigned to one of the several gifts from R. Norton noted in Har- mon's "Catalogue," where there is no indication for its origin. Inv. no. 19 comprises two joining, but now separated, pieces of a scene depicting a horseback rider spearing a boar while his hunting dog keeps it at bay (fig. 4.3.15). The groom following the rider provides the clue for an accurate identification of the subject, which Harmon misinterpreted when he entered his description into his "Catalogue," for the "falcon" on the groom's arm is, instead, the eagle-crested helmet of a member of the Imperial Horse Guard.27 The relief presents a scene of a boar hunt that once decorated a tall century A.D., and since so many of the sarcophagus fragments in the Academy's collection are so dated, this provenance may be likely for these fragments, also. Certainty about this is not possible, however. This neighborhood underwent real estate development beginning ca. 1886.

These stelae originate from only one place in Rome, the cemetery of the équités singulares Augusti "ad duas lauros" by the third milestone on the Via Labicana (now the Via Casilina).28 This cemetery was in use by the Imperial Horse Guard from the end of the second century A.D. until Constantine the Great disbanded the Guard after his victory at the Milvian Bridge in A.D. 3 12. 29 He had the cemetery demolished and had the broken gravestones used in the foundations for the cemetery church of Saints Peter and Marcellinus, adjacent to the mausoleum of his mother Helena, the "Tor Pignattara," a landmark in the area still today.30 The worn and encrusted condition of this piece, which Norton must have purchased between 1897, when he arrived in Rome, and the time when it was entered into Harmons "Catalogue" between 1905 and 1907, indicates something of its "career." Lime encrustations still visible attest its long rest mortared into a foundation wall. At some point it was discovered and placed in a modern wall, as traces of a yellow wash indicate.31 Today, the pieces have been placed in a wall once again, in the Cortile near the entrance to the Library of the American Academy. As A. M. Harmon noted at the beginning of his "Catalogue," the exact provenance of the material purchased in Rome or listed as "from Rome" is not known. Those pieces recorded as "from Rome" were gifts of Richard Norton and include a statuette of Asclepius (inv. no. 6), a small terminal bust (inv. no. 471), a lion's head from a table support (inv. no. 472), a small female head (inv. no. 11), and a fragment of a sarcophagus lid depicting a seasonal genius (inv. no. 17). 32 One is listed as coming from South Italy, although it was purchased from a dealer in Rome, a post-antique bearded head (inv. no. 4). 33 While Harmon recorded only the material in the collection of the old School of Classical Studies, it is safe to say that his remark applies as well to the sculptural pieces from the old Academy. Despite the fragmentary state of most of these pieces, their forms and styles are clear indicators of an origin in Rome or its environs. Of these, three (inv. nos. 8993, 8988, and 9122) seem to have come from the well-known Ludovisi Collection, begun in 1621 by Cardinal Ludovico Ludovisi.34 All three correspond in their descriptive details, sizes, and condition to those given by Theodor Schreiber in his catalogue, pub- lished in 1880.35 According to this catalogue two had been displayed in the Ludovisi gardens (inv. no. 8993 and 8988, fig. 4.3.7); the third had been stored in a building that was demolished before the bulk of the collection was sold to the Italian state in 1901. How they came to the American Academy is not known. The statement of R. T. Ohl, however, in writing about the inscribed relief depicting Silvanus (inv. no. 8988), applies to all three: " [they were] acquired by the Academy dur- ing the period, 1895 to 1905, when this institution [the old American Academy] occupied the Villa Aurora, a surviving portion of that historic estate."36 The coincidences between Schreiber s descriptions and the appearance of the pieces in the Academy's collection are too striking to be ignored. Since the Ludovisi Collection contained 28 On this cemetery, see Speidel 1994a, 1-3 with bibliography and Speidel 1994b, 114 with fig. 8, 137. See also Deichmann and Tschira 1937, 47, 68-73; and Guyon 1977, 223-224. 29 The third-century A.D. style of the Academy's relief fits into this time frame. 30 See Speidel 1994a, 2 fig. 1 for a view of broken grave stones laid almost as levelers in the foundation walls. 31 Harmon entered these words into his "Catalogue": "The pieces have been embedded in a modern wall &amp; show traces of yellow wash" (p. 12 no. 21). 32 Harmon "Catalogue," nos. 7, 8, 37, 13, and 19 respectively. 33 Harmon "Catalogue," no. 3. 34 On the formation of the Ludovisi Collection of sculpture, see Palma 1983, 11-38. 35 Schreiber 1880, 221 no. 246 (inv. no. 9134), 194-193 no. 187 (inv. no. 8988), and 231 no. 269 (inv. no. 9122). 36 Ohl 1931, 107.</page><page sequence="132">118 JACQUELYN COLLINS-CLINTON considerably more sculptures than were sold to the state, a few words about the dispersal of that collection and the disposition of its sculptures in the 1880s and 1890s before the sale to the state and after the publication of Schreiber 's catalogue in 1880 should help us understand how the old Acad- emy might have been able to acquire its pieces.37 After the Villa Ludovisi was sold in 1885, only five years after Schreiber 's work was published, the property was prompdy readied for new construction. New streets were laid, old trees cut down, the gardens laid waste.38 The prince, however, retained possession of his entire collection, including sculptures and other antiquities on the grounds of the former Villa; he also kept the Casino Aurora and some gardens surrounding it for the family as well as some other small properties.39 He made an effort to move most of the sculptures to the proper- ties remaining to him. Between 1886 and 1890 he had a new palazzo constructed for his family, the Nuovo Palazzo Piombino, later named the Palazzo Margherita after the widow of King Umberto I, Queen Margherita, who lived there between 1900 and 1926.40 Much of his sculpture collection was gathered in the ground floor of the new palazzo, forming a new Museo Ludovisi.41 In 1891 C. L. Visconti published a catalogue of these sculptures, which were taken mainly from the old sculpture gallery; only a few of greater importance, such as the famous batde sarcophagus, were brought in from the gardens.42 Other statues once in the gardens made their way into the gardens of the Palazzo Margherita and the Casino Aurora, where they remain today.43 By 1896 numerous sculptures of lesser importance were still left in the gardens, including two of the pieces now in the Academy's collection, inv. nos. 8993 and 8988.44 In 1901 a good portion of the collection was sold to the Italian state.45 Highlights Several pieces of sculpture stand out for various reasons other than their provenance. All contribute to the breadth and didactic aspect of the collection as a whole, despite their often fragmentary or poorly preserved nature. 37 The sources summing up the last two decades of the Ludovisi Collection are: Felici 1952, 350-354; Palma 1983, 185-188; 1986, vii, 148-280, 295-303. 1 thank K. Geffcken for making her notes and her thoughts on this subject avail- able to me. Both Giuseppe Felici, former curator of the Boncompagni Archives, and Beatrice Palma have worked extensively with the Boncompagni-Ludovisi family archives, now in the Archivio Segreto Vaticano. B. Palma reproduces many documents from these archives in her history of the collection (1983). 38 Felici 1952, 354; Palma 1983, 185. 39 Felici 1952, 350-351, 353. The present prince still owns this casino. 40 The House of Savoy purchased it for Queen Margherita. Later, in 1946, the United States of America purchased it to use as its embassy. On this, see Palma 1983, 186 and Marchi 1980, 26-29, 46. 41 Frischer 1982, 134 notes the immensity of the task of mov- ing all the sculptures in his discussion of a seated statue of Epicurus in the gardens of the Ludovisi Collection; Schreiber 1880, no. 243. 42 Visconti 1891 and Palma 1983, 186-187. 43 For the sculptures today in the Palazzo Margherita, see Palma 1986, 146-222; see also Marchi 1980, 52-57.

It is interesting to note that, of the 99 sculptural pieces noted by Schreiber as in the gardens, 47 are unaccounted for; see the lists in Palma 1983 , 284-303 recording the present location of the items in Schreiber's catalogue. From Palmas lists it is also clear that 64 sculptural pieces once stored in buildings on the Villa grounds that were demolished, such as the Chiesuola and the Old Sculpture Gallery, are also unaccounted for, including inv. no. 9122, now in the Academy's collection. 45 Palma 1983, 188-194 and 243-245 for the list of items (Document no. 55: Camera dei Deputati, no. 185, Allegato A, dated 25 January 1901).

Cycladic figurines ( inv . nos. 1, 3, 2). Fig. 4.3.2. Hellenistic votive relief from Bodrum (inv. no. 6279). Fig. 4.3.3. Portrait of bearded man, Roman copy (inv. no. 21). The sole Egyptian piece (inv. no. 1604), though broken, is a good example of the typically Egyptian standing figure who places his right foot forward with the left leg attached, relieflike, to a backslab. The three Cycladic figurines (inv. nos. 1, 3, and 2, fig. 4.3.1) are also typical Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age examples whose smooth, abstract forms are so appealing to the modern eye. One of the two Greek pieces is inv. no. 6279 (fig. 4.3.2), a Hellenistic votive relief that was purchased in Bodrum, the modern village at the site of the famous Halicarnassus. This is most interesting for the figure of the priestess, whose pose and dress imitate those of the well-known statue traditionally identified as Artemisia, wife of Mausolus, who constructed the famous Mausoleum at Halicarnassus in the middle of the fourth century B.c. This statue was influential in affecting subsequent repre- sentations of priestesses, depicted as veiled and offering a sacrifice, in Hellenistic and Roman art.46 Copies after Greek originals form a large and important category of Roman art. Commissioned by Roman patrons from the late Republic through the third century A.D., they served as cult images, bodies of portrait statues, or as decorations for public and private places. One such head may be singled out. Inv. no. 21 so closely resembles portraits of the philosopher Hermarchus, successor of Epicurus, that it was thus identified for many years (fig. 4.3 .3). A recent study, however, has shown that this type of head depicts a private person, perhaps someone who followed the Epicurean school and desired his appearance to reflect the philosophical oudook of that well-known figure.47 Small but not insignificant is the headless, but otherwise complete, bust of Isis or a priestess of Isis, who wears Isis 's fringed mande knotted in the characteristic manner over the chest (inv. no. 9107). The hair, too, fea- tures the long locks favored by Isis. The small size may indicate that it was made for votive purposes.48 One of the special highlights of this collection is the over-life-sized male torso of a figure who stood in the contrapposto stance preferred by the Greek sculptor of the mid-fifth century 46 On the "Artemisia," see Waywell 1994, 63-64, 65-66, fig. 13; 1993, 80-81; and 1978, 70-72, 103-105 no. 27, pl. 13. 47 Hoff 1994, 44-47; 79 nn. 198, 201; 85. 48 The most recent discussion of the costume and hairstyle of Isis is by Eingartner 1991, 8, 10-33, 52-55.

Originally the Academy s torso may have belonged to a copy of the celebrated Doryphorus, or Spearbearer, of ca. 44CM30 B.c. The torso seems to have been discovered in the late sixteenth or seventeenth century, when it was restored as a portrait of Nero, presumably for the collection of a wealthy Roman family. Somehow it found its way to the American Academy, for it was set on a tall pedestal just inside the main gate of the new McKim, Mead, and White building in 1914. Many old photographs taken between 1914 and the 1930s show it standing there (as, for example, fig. 4.3.6). It was taken down soon after 1950 and dismanded; the torso, along with its seventeenth-century feet and plinth, which for years stood before a door to the Casa Rustica, is now in the entrance atrium.49 Another highlight is the over-life-sized statue of a man seated on a large rock on which, near his legs, is carved in relief the figure of a sleek dog, whose head must have turned to look outward, for it was carved separately and doweled on (inv. no. 8993, fig. 4.3.7). At first glance the man and dog might seem to represent a hunter, such as Actaeon or Adonis, with his canine companion.

Togate figure (inv. no. 8996). has not revealed any parallels for such an identification, however. Instead, a painting of Mars and Venus from the House of the Citharist in Pompeii, dating ca. 15 B.c., presents a figure of Mars sitting on a rock in exactly the same pose as the Academy's statue, and there is a dog at his feet. The dog is the watchdog belonging to Alectryon, the watchman who was to look out for the rising sun and warn the two lovers before the sun spied them. Alas, Alectryon fell asleep, and we see him dozing in the painting. Venus would have appeared on Mars 's right, as she does in the painting, possibly as a separate figure, forming an ensemble.50 The two-figured group would have graced the garden of a well-appointed Roman villa. Among the pieces of Roman statuary that do not copy Greek originals are two portrait heads. A fragment of the upper portion of a female head is a rare piece executed in peperino, a material that was used only occasionally in Roman portraiture (inv. no. 6280). The hairdo is well preserved. In front it sweeps up and over a diadem-shaped frame; behind, the hair is braided and looped back and forth over the top of the head. This style resembles that of Plotina, the wife of Trajan (reigned A.D. 98-117). The second is the portrait of a youth whose long, straight hair copies the cut and texture of that of Trajan (inv. no. 1174, fig. 4.3.8). It reflects a large body of similar heads of youths or boys popular at that time.51 The over-life-sized statue of a man wearing a toga, carved of Pentelic marble, today greets visi- tors to the American Academy from his post at the right of the stairs in the entrance atrium of the Academy's main building (inv. no. 8996, fig. 4.3.9). It was placed there in the summer of 1914 in time for the official opening of the building in October of that year.52 His pendant on the left of the stairway is the large statue of the seated Mars just mentioned above (inv. no. 8993). 50 For the painting in the House of the Citharist, Pompeii (1.4.5), and now in Naples, Museo Archeologico Nazionale, inv. 112283, see LIMC 2 (1984) 548 no. 378a, s.v.

The fifteen pieces of Roman furniture are largely fragmentary. The end of the armrest of a throne made of pavonazzetto imported from Asia Minor represents a cornucopia rising between the horns of a goat (inv. no. 28). It has been published recently by R. Cohon, who sees in the goat the zodiacal sign of Capricorn under which Augustus was conceived.53 The cornucopia symbolizes the abundance prevailing during his reign after decades of strife. This armrest may have belonged to a throne meant for a statue of Augustus carved in another marble. Four pieces form part of the triangular base of a large marble candelabrum of Augustan date (inv. nos. 29-31, 9563). Winged lion-griffins and floral designs combine in an artful and finely carved arrangement typical of the decorative arts of that period.54 Two herms (inv. nos. 6337 and 9423), four terminal busts that decorated table supports or small garden pillars (inv. nos. 8958, 9132, 471, and 9110), a columnar basin support of a late Republican type very common in Pompeii (inv. no. 9414), a table support in the form of a female herm (inv. no. 9504), and two lion's heads that once decorated table supports (inv. nos. 9514 and 472) round out the furniture. A few reliefs of a non-funerary nature merit attention. An inscribed votive altar dedicated to Isis and Sarapis has a figure of a priest in Egyptian costume on the left and right sides, carrying a reed stalk and a sistrum respectively. The upper surface is carved with a depression to hold a water container, the hydraeum , mentioned in the inscription on the front as an offering to the two Egyp- tian divinities. This small altar reflects the popularity of the cult of Isis during the Roman Empire.55 Another divinity favored by the populace of Rome was Silvanus, who is depicted in a small inscribed votive relief of the second century A.D. (inv. no. 8988). He stands frontally, nude save for his tall boots, the mullei , and a pine wreath on his head. He holds his pruning hook, the falx , in his raised right hand and a pine branch laden with cones, symbols of fruitfulness, in his lowered left hand. The skin of a wild animal is slung over this arm. This image corresponds to the standard iconography of Silvanus.56 53 Cohon 1989, 105-109, pl. 29. 54 See Cain 1985, Type I, pp. 27-38; 27 no. 17, 172 no. 67, and pl. 16, figs. 1 and 4. 55 CIL 14.3941; ILS 4378.

The first, inv. no. 9428, probably came from an historical relief. It shows a man wearing an Attic helmet, originally elaborately decorated, facing the tip of the pilum he is carrying (fig. 4.3.10). This presents the characteristic pyramidal expansion that held the tang of the weapon, below which are carefully carved decorative elements. This soldier, with his fancy weapon and fine, Hellenizing helmet, must be either an officer or a member of the Pretorian Guard in parade dress. The style seems more Claudian than Flavian.57 The second fragment shows a man wearing a helmet with a narrow brim elongated in back to protect the neck (inv. no. 9429, fig. 4.3.11); over the ears and neck the brim is wavy, a characteristic of the Boeotian family of Hellenistic and late Republican helmets. This type of helmet, with the added protection that the wavy neck-piece gave the wearer, formed the basis for the Roman gladiators' helmets. It is possible, indeed, that the Academy's relief could depict a gladiator; certainty of identification is not possible. The style seems Augustan.58 Another small head, possibly also from an historical relief, is a portrait of a male figure modeled on the "First Coiffure Type" of the portraiture of Nero, A.D. 50-59, just before and after he became emperor in A.D. 54 (inv. no. 9136). The low forehead and the pattern of locks framing it correspond closely to those portraits, although the Academy's head does not depict Nero.59 By far the largest percentage of the stone sculptures is funerary, and the Academy's collection contains a sampling of the major types of grave sculpture that the Romans produced. There is the head of an old man, with a venerable, wrinkled face signaling his age and familial status, and emulating the imagines of aristocratic families, for he would have been a freedman (inv. no. 22, fig. 4.3.12). This originally belonged to an example of a class of grave reliefs depicting busts or full- length figures of members of a family of freedman status that was common during the Augustan and Julio-Claudian period. The older men are depicted in the old-fashioned, late Republican veristic style, as we see in the Academy's head.60 The front slab of the inscribed funerary altar of T. Flavius Primio is all that remains of an altar formerly in the Villa Borghese (inv. no. 9441, fig. 4.3.13). The sides originally bore reliefs depict- ing sacrificial utensils, the urceus , or pitcher, and the patera, or shallow bowl. The front presents the typical form with a rounded gable at the top containing two seated griffins facing a flaming thymiaterion , or incense burner.61 448; but see also Morrow 1983, 123-139, 141, 148-149, and pl. 124 on p. 130 on the Greek version, the embades.

For helmets similar to ours worn by gladiators, see a relief from Rome now in Budapest, Hun- garian National Museum (Dintsis 1986, 21 and pl. 8.3 with bibliography) and an early Augustan relief in the Glyptothek, Munich (Dintsis 1986, 21 with bibliography). A batde relief in the Museo Nuovo Capitolino, inv. 1726, possibly from the Arch of Claudius in Rome, shows this helmet worn by Roman foot soldiers (see Waurick 1983, 289 and n. 1 13; well illustrated by Nash 1961, 102, fig. 103). Of these examples, the gladiators' helmets are closer to ours in most details. I thank G. M. Koeppel for discussing this head with me. . 59 The model for our head is the "First Coiffure Type" of .Nero, A.D. 30-39; see Hiesinger 1973, 113-119. The closest parallel to the hairstyle is a head of Nero in the Museo Na- zionale, Cagliari, inv. no. 33333, Hiesinger 1973, pl. 21, fig. 33. 1 thank G.

Inscribed funerary altar o/T. Flavius Primio (inv. no. 9441). Fig. 4.3.14. Inscribed gravestone of Lucius Titius (inv. no. 8990). There are two grave stelae, both belonging to members of the military. One is the complete, inscribed tombstone of Lucius Titius, a foot soldier and member of the Ninth Cohort of the Preto- rian Guard (inv. no. 8990, fig. 4.3.14). He wears his military garb: his cloak, the paenula , fastened in front over a short tunic, and the military sandals, the caligae , on his feet. He carries a small, round shield tucked under his left arm and holds a spear with his right hand. The inscription dates this piece to the second half of the second century A.D.62 Easily overlooked is a very damaged and worn portion of an interesting, and large, class of military tombstones that belonged to the graves of members of the Imperial Horse Guard, the équités singulares Augusti , mentioned above, pp. 116-117. The Academy's fragment is broken into two pieces, separated, and immured in the south portico of the Cortile, near to but not next to each other (inv. no. 19, fig. 4.3.15). Together, they show a rider galloping toward a boar, barely visible at the far right. The horse rears slightly as the rider aims his spear; his hunting dog darts toward the boar, distracting it and keeping it at bay. Behind, a servant on foot carries the rider's eagle-crested helmet, symbol of his status, now very worn. Though badly preserved, the scene is a good representative of a rare category of this class of gravestone, for only a few include scenes of the boar hunt. These stones tend to be tall slabs containing a long inscription detailing the career of the deceased soldier. At the top in a rounded gable there is often a scene of a banquet, the funerary meal. Beneath this there may be a portrait of the deceased within a circular clipeus and below that another scene, perhaps a boar hunt or often simply a servant on foot following a riderless horse, today still a symbol of the deceased in state military funerals.63 The schematic scene of the boar hunt resembles certain votive and grave reliefs from the Balkan region showing the Thracian Rider God, or Heros , hunting a boar. The choice of this scene for their gravestones by certain members 62 L'Année Ěpigraphique 1931, 91.

Fragment of gravestone of an eques singularis Augusti (inv. no. 19). Fig. 4.3.16. Asia Minor ossuary (inv. no. 8825 a-c). of the Imperial Horse Guard stationed in Rome was most likely determined by their familiarity with that divinity from their homeland in the Danube regions of Moesia and Thrace. These skilled riders, trained in their homelands from childhood, were recruited from these regions by the end of the second century A.D., when these scenes began to appear on their gravestones. The successful boar hunt, an expression of manliness, may have decorated the graves of those guardsmen who accompanied the emperor on the hunts.64 Within the total of 82 pieces of Roman funerary sculpture are 68 fragments and occasional complete examples of sarcophagi produced in Rome. There are only two complete chests, both sarcophagi of the strigil type made for children in the later third century A.D. (inv. nos. 9415 and 9425, of which inv. no. 9425 was reworked in modern times).65 Both exhibit on the front a paired set of antithetical strigils, or S-shaped flutes, arranged so that the upper curvature is concave toward the center, thus forming an almond-shaped field in the middle on which appears a motive, such as an amphora on inv. no. 9415. Small side panels frame the strigils; on inv. no. 9415 these are filled with a fruiting laurel and a tree laden with olives. The ends contain the very common motive of crossed shields in low flat relief. The backs of both are plain.66 Among the four pieces of sarcophagi produced in Asia Minor, two may be highlighted. The first is the complete chest of a limestone ossuary, or osteotheca (inv. no. 8825a-c, fig. 4.3.16), which belongs to a well-defined class of small sarcophagi widely spread in Asia Minor. The form and decoration of the Academy's example is characteristic of those from eastern Pamphylia and western Cilicia: above a plain, projecting socle a garland decorates three sides: front, one end, and back, supported by a bulls head at the corners. The ends hang down on either side of a death s door. In the field above the swags on the front and back are a male and a female head.67 The place of origin of the type and the preservation of an example at Side in Pamphylia strongly suggest that this piece, also, came from Side. This provenance is all the more likely considering the cruise taken on A. V. Armour s yacht, the Utowana , by a small group of men closely associated with the old School of Classical Studies in Rome in the spring of 1904. One of the stops was Side, where other objects in 64 Speidel 1994a, 145; 1994b, 7. See further above, p. 1 17, on the cemetery of the équités singulares Augusti and the prob- able provenance for this fragmentary gravestone. 65 Another chest, sized for an adult, is also intact, but its form is very unusual, and it may have been extensively reworked in modern times, perhaps from a plain ancient piece (inv. no. 9424). 66 On strigil sarcophagi for children, see Huskinson 1996, 61-62, 65-66. 67 On this class of small sarcophagus and our example as well, see Pietrogrande 1935.</page><page sequence="140">126 JACQUELYN COLLINS-CLINTON Fig. 4.3.17a-b. Fragments of lid of Asia Minor sarcophagus (inv. no. 13). the Academy's collection were also purchased (among the sculptures are inv. nos. 13, fig. 4.3.17a-b, and 12). 68 This piece, however, is not recorded in Harmon s "Catalogue." The second example is today embedded in the south wall of the Cortile: a friezelike sequence of eight separate slabs of Proconnesian marble depicting cupids hunting (inv. no. 13, fig. 4.3.17a-b). These originally decorated the back and ends of a rather monumental lid in the form of a kline , or bed. The back and ends partially enclosed a mattress, exposed on the front, on which reclined effigies of the deceased. The subject was a common one on lids of this type. Two of the Academy's slabs depict a single sea-panther; these usually terminated the head- and foot-ends of the frame toward the front. One of these slabs is larger and must have originally been placed at the head- end, whose frame was higher to accommodate the pillows on which the deceased reclined. A good example of this type of lid is that of the well-known "Sidamara" sarcophagus in the Archaeological Museum at Istanbul.69 These slabs were purchased at Side in Pamphylia in 1904 by A. V. Armour during the cruise of the Utowana70 Lastly, three pieces of Palmyrene workmanship provide examples of Roman provincial art (inv. nos. 27, 26, 24, fig. 4.3.18). All are typical examples of the sort of grave reliefs carved for the large cemeteries outside Palmyra between ca. A.D. 50 and 200.71 The first two are small funerary stelae, flat slabs decorated with the figure of a woman in low relief (inv. nos. 27 and 26). The third is a fragmentary head of a priest, wearing his diagnostic hat, broken from a funerary bust in very high relief (inv. no. 24, fig. 4.3.18). Acknowledgments I am grateful especially to Helen Nagy, who first invited me to participate in this project. I owe a special debt to Katherine Geffcken, who has answered my many questions concerning the forma- tion of this collection, supplied me with notes, and given much moral support.

Charles Babcock made his manuscript available to me before the final version was ready, so I could work with the material we have in common. Many people eased my efforts to examine the material embedded in the walls of the Cortile in many ways, so as to prevent certain risks to life and limb inherent in climbing, first, the wooden extension ladder, and then, the wonderful rolling scaffolding used to reach high places. Malcolm Bell, III, loaned me the use of his binoculars one summer so that I would not lose my balance in taking closer looks. To Eric Lind- gren I owe hearty thanks for spending a quiet Sunday afternoon holding the ladder and recording measurements on the day when I extended the wooden ladder to its highest setting. Eric Hostetter very kindly loaned a long, aluminum ladder and his student, Eric De Sena, to help me measure the very highest piece in the Cortile walls. Many other members of the Academy community or visitors to the Library, upon spotting me at work in the Cortile or entrance hall, gave me helpful information or, simply, stopped to cheer me on. Any errors or infelicitous interpretations are mine alone. Kevin Clinton also deserves thanks for looking after our children during my absences from home. Last, but not least, I thank members of the Academy staff who have facilitated my work in different ways, from arranging permissions to view comparanda in Roman museums to setting up the scaffolding whenever and wherever I needed it.

Wright Built sidiary into door the wall to the early Library, in the entirely 1920s on overlooked the west side until of the the Academy current project Cortile, to high catalogue above all a sub- the sidiary door to the Library, entirely overlooked until the current project to catalogue all the Academy's antiquities, is a severely damaged fragment of the front of a sarcophagus lid (inv. no. 9089; fig. 4.4.1). It has no specific provenance but is assumed to come from Rome. On grounds of style and iconography it can be assigned to the Tetrarchie period, and it is very interesting for the development of an iconography of civic administration in the era of Diocletian. Originally about 35 cm high and carved in high relief, it is very large for a sarcophagus lid and must have been made for a prominent official. The exceptionally large (but incomplete) lid in S. Lorenzo Fuori le Mura, comparable in style of carving and depicting two official processions, is 43 cm high;1 more typical of earlier luxury sarcophagi is the one in Baltimore with the Indian Triumph of Bacchus, where the lid is 32 cm high.2 The upper half of the relief, including the top edge, is badly eroded, suggesting that it was exposed to flowing water when buried; the lower half is less eroded, but almost all surfaces are battered. In the middle of the relief a roughly square dowel hole was cut about 3.5 cm deeper than the figures there, penetrating about 6.5 cm below the indicated original surface of the marble; it does not penetrate beyond the back of the fragment, so the full depth of the piece is not known. The background behind the figures is coved at the top (as expected in a sarcophagus lid but not in an architectural frieze), and the front edge of the piece at the bottom is 1.5 cm forward of the top front edge (fig. 4.4.2). The depth of carving is generally around 2.5 cm but reaches a maximum of 4 cm between the heads of the two figures at the left. The maximum preserved height is 34.5 cm, but the top surface at the top is very deteriorated; the surviving width is 44 cm. The background is smooth for 2 cm to the right of the seated figure, and the edge there is chipped but relatively straight. The marble appears generally gray, but in two places where it has been reçut in modern times (on the neck of the second figure from the left and above his right knee) it appears white with slight streaks of blue. The heads project considerably from the background, especially the standing man at the left, but the bodies of the figures project much less, and the right leg of the figure in the background is merely outlined by a groove. There is a great deal of rather coarse running drill work in the drapery but no drilled holes. The main scene as preserved shows a humble petitioner, wearing a tunic and paenula, approach- ing a seated magistrate, who wears a chlamy s and holds a scroll open across his lap. The petitioner reaches out with both hands toward the magistrate, who reaches out with his right hand slightly 1 Koch-Sichtermann 1982, 115, fig. 131.

Sarcophagus fragment, oblique view (inv. no. 9089). above the petitioner's hands. This area is so badly chipped away that it is not possible to say what the magistrate is handing to the petitioner (probably a scroll or a tablet). Although incomplete and carelessly carved, the chair seems intended to show the X-pattern of a magistrate's sella curulis. Behind them stands another man wearing a tunic and mantle, apparently leaning toward the mag- istrate and holding his right hand in front of his chest; he is presumably assisting the magistrate. At the left stands a man facing left, partly broken off, part of the previous scene in this series; he wears an elaborate toga contabulata , with part of the hem drawn over his left arm, and holds a roll in his left hand in front of his chest. It must be the image of a very high official supervising something in the lost scene at the left. Two iconographie parallels for the main scene spring to mind. The first scene, on an enormous medallion (87 mm across) known from a lead proof, the plomb de Lyon , shows seated figures of Constantius and Maximian receiving a family group of petitioners (fig. 4.4.3). In the next scene the petitioners leave to the right, and in the larger scene below they come to cross a bridge over the Rhine to the fortified city of Mainz (both labeled).3 This illustrates the imperial policy of settling Germanic peoples in areas of Gaul. The other close parallel is the largitio scene on the Arch of Constantine, where the enthroned frontal Constantine himself gives gold coins to senators, while the plebeians get theirs in four offices at the sides. In each office the recipient holds out his hands, covered by the folds of his paenula , to receive the coins given out by an assistant leaning forward from behind a table, while an official wearing a toga contabulata holds up a roll or a diptych, apparently checking it, and another man in toga contabulata stands supervising in the background.4 Our scene is simpler than these two but has very similar elements, developed from older traditions of imperial iconography. Looking back a century, we should compare humana vita sarcophagi, such as the elaborate lid to the Portonaccio batde sarcophagus, where the front of the lid, similar in size to ours, shows the 3 Bastien 1989, pl. 1. Turcan (1987, 183-195, pls. 35-36) has a slightly different interpretation, but the difference is not meaningful in this context. 4 L'Orange and von Gerkan, 1939, pls. 16-17, 22.</page><page sequence="147">A TETRARCHIC FRIEZE 133 Fig. 4.4.3. The plomb de Lyon, detail of author's (photo of the cast in Lyon). birth and education of a girl, marriage, and the dementia of the victorious general receiving cap- tives.5 A more elaborate version of the dementia iconography was revived for the lid of the enormous Ludovisi battle sarcophagus around 270, 6 but this is military iconography, and the seated figure is normally a general wearing cuirass and paludamentum , while our magistrate is a civilian receiving a petitioner, not a conqueror accepting a defeated barbarian. The scene to the left of our fragment must also have concerned civilians and was supervised by someone of senatorial rank. Considering the size of the fragment, there should have been at least four such scenes, possibly more; some may well have come from the traditional vocabulary of humana vita sarcophagi, including marriage and sacrifice, but the two surviving scenes obviously concern the administrative career of the deceased. I have found no close parallels among sarcophagi, and Guntram Koch in Marburg kindly writes that neither he nor Rita Amedick (who recently wrote a volume on vita privata sarcophagi) can offer any. This developing iconography must reflect the rise of the rigorously organized civilian administration of Diocletian. It would seem that one of his high officials wanted his sarcophagus to boast of his career in that service. 5 Koch-Sichtermann 1982, pl. 76. 6 Koch-Sichtermann 1982, pl. 77.

Moore The wide architectural variety of types, terracottas ranging in from the collection simple palmette of the antefixes American to Academy finely detailed in Rome head represent antefixes, a wide variety of types, ranging from simple palmette antefixes to finely detailed head antefixes, waterspouts, crestings, and palmette/Ionic- column friezes.1 The provenances, where known, range from Etruria and Basilicata in Italy to Delphi and Epidauros in Greece, with the majority coming from Latium and Campania. There are 88 revetments and 12 pieces of sculpture, of which 43 have no known provenance. The dates cover a long period, from the Archaic period to the first century A.D. They are all made of terracotta, most of them using the mold technique and then finished with a tool, and were more than likely used to decorate buildings. Some were painted, inv. no. 150 (fig. 5.1.11a-b) or had a fine layer of light-colored slip applied, inv. no. 152 (fig. 5.1.10), presumably to make them resemble marble. The source and provenance of many of the pieces are not indicated on the inventory cards, but something is known about the recent history of some of the revetments. In 1914, 64 uncatalogued pieces were transferred from the American School of Classical Studies when the School moved to the present Academy premises.2 These pieces had been collected sporadically over the previous fifty years and had never been inventoried or formally studied. They were finally added to the Academy Museum Records in 1936.3 In 1948, 37 of these pieces were discarded to make room for the Cosa collection. The remaining 27 pieces, as well as the other 73 architectural terracottas in the Academy collection, are the subject of this chapter.4 Dating these pieces has been difficult because so little is known about their original context. Accordingly, where a date can be assigned, they have been dated, sometimes quite broadly, based on comparanda.5 1 1 am grateful to Helen Nagy and the American Academy in Rome for the opportunity to study and publish this material. My thanks also to Karen Einaudi and Malcolm Bell for their help in identifying inventory numbers through use of the photographic archives. Special thanks to Carla Antonaccio for her help in locating rare books and to Joanne Spurza for her encouragement and help in every phase. Thanks go to Margaret Mayo for making available the collection at the Museum of Fine Arts in Richmond. The information in this chapter derives from the inventory records for the Academy collection, as well as from personal observation of each piece. Additions and corrections have been incorporated, and the terminology and method of description have been standardized. 2 Simpson 1938, 1. 3 Simpson 1938, 1. 4 Inventory of the Museum of the AAR, vol. 1. Each entry originally listed the inventory number, one measurement, and a description. Later, a line was drawn through the entries and the notation "Dis." was made. The initials of the person who discarded the piece and the date were also sometimes added. The initials "RH" refer to Robert Hecht, who was a Fellow at the Academy in 1949. 5 Several recent publications have studied architectural terracottas from central Italy from various points of view, including their origins and development, chronology, iconog- raphy, type, and distribution.

Antefixes There are thirteen palmette antefixes (without decorative heads) in the Academy's collection.6 Most of them are of a common type, with curling petals on either side of a central petal. Inv. no. 800 (fig. 5.1.1) is a good example of this simple type of palmette antefix. In several examples, the palmette is embellished with a cockle shell at its base and dolphins on either side, inv. nos. 839 and 158 (fig. 5.1.2), or a cockle shell and hippocamps, inv. nos. 810 (fig. 5.1.3) and 1302. Another common motif is the acanthus leaf from which the palmette springs, inv. no. 802. Other animals that appear on either side of the palmette are panthers, inv. no. 2285, and goats, inv. no. 846. Three of the palmette antefixes, inv. nos. 1303, 1307, and 8166, are of a distinctively different style in the rendering of the palmette petals. Each has a wide, flat central petal with ridges. The side petals are also very wide and stiff with deep ridges. Inv. nos. 1303 and 1307 were collected by Thomas Ashby in Latium, probably at the end of the nineteenth century; the source for inv. no. 8166 is unknown. There are nineteen palmette antefixes and tiles with decorative heads.7 The styles of these an- tefixes vary widely; some have very small female heads, which may be maenads, inv. no. 1301, or, in some cases, small heads of an "ugly" gorgon type, inv. no. 154 (fig. 5.1.4). All of the antefixes with large heads are of the "beautiful" gorgon type - no tusks, no snake hair, no protruding tongue - framed by a palmette, inv. no. 834 (fig. 5.1.5). 6 Inv. nos. 800, 8834, 1303, 1307, 8166, 839, 158, 810, 1302, 802, 2285, 846, 8751. 7 Inv. nos. 840, 1301, 1619,842,495,855,494,843, 153, 155, 154, 143, 6302, 4066, 8835, 834, 156, 832, 493.</page><page sequence="151">138 ANNA M.

While they all have a female head against a palmette, the styles of both the heads and palmettes are very different. All of the heads are abraded, and details are not discernible. Only two of the antefixes, inv. nos. 1301 and 842, have portions of the palmette preserved. Inv. no. 842 has one side pair of very wide, stiff petals with ridges that curl under and around crescents. Only three of the antefixes have bases preserved, and they are all decorated differendy: inv. no. 840 has a meander in relief; inv. no. 1301 has a very elegant, detailed garland; and inv. no. 842 has a half-round carved with a twisted rope over a Lesbian leaf design. There are seven palmette antefixes with small gorgon heads and four fragments, which may be antefixes or tiles, with small gorgon heads.8 Of those that are certainly antefixes, one almost complete example, inv. no. 495, has a central petal with two pairs of side petals curling upward and dolphins on either side at the bottom of the palmette. The gorgoneion is centered on the base below the palmette and has long, thin snakes on either side.

A third almost complete antefix, inv. no. 494, has a similar decoration, but the style is entirely different. It has a seven-petalled palmette springing from the head of the gorgoneion and curling upward. On either side of the gorgoneion are two thin tendrils curling downward. Below this are a thin bead and reel, another fillet, a wide egg and dart sitting on a plain base. Two of these seven palmette antefixes with gorgon heads are very similar, inv. nos. 843 and 153. They are both fragmentary, but we can see that both have seven-petalled palmettes springing from the gorgon 's head. Both gorgons wear "gable" diadems and have their hair arranged in rolls. Beneath the chins are acanthus leaves that curl upward and then under. Both bases are plain bands. The remaining four fragments with gorgon heads, inv. nos. 143, 6302, 4066, and 8835, may have been antefixes, simas, or tiles. One of these, inv. no. 6302 (fig. 5.1.6), is part of a sima with a cavetto decorated with what was probably a running pattern of gorgoneia and tendrils; only one complete head with its tendrils on either side is preserved. There are four palmette antefixes with large gorgons' heads, inv. nos. 834 (fig. 5.1.5), 156, 832 (fig. 5.1.7), 493 (fig. 5.1.8). All of these heads are of the "beautiful" gorgon type. In all four examples, the head is very large, and the palmette consists merely of the ends of the petals curling around the face. The faces are full and fleshy; the hair is parted in the middle and falls around the face in large curls. All have plain bases. Two antefixes are in the shape of large maenad heads, inv. nos. 1172 (fig. 5.1.9) and 8737. Inv. no. 1172 is probably the earlier of the two; the eyes are almond-shaped, the lips are slighdy smiling, and the cheeks are very prominent. The scalloped hair is crowned by a half-round and a diadem. Much of the paint that accented the features and earrings is preserved. Inv. no. 8737 is rendered in a more natural style, with a full face and lips, and round eyes. Her scalloped hair is crowned by a diadem, which was once surrounded by disks; only one of the sur- rounding disks is preserved. One of the most interesting pieces in the collection, inv. no. 152 (fig. 5.1.10), is somewhat abraded, ogival in shape, and shows Cybele sitting on a crescent-shaped ship with square rigging. The sail is tied up to the upper yardarm. There are lions on either side and the cheniscos , in the form of a male head, is turned toward the center of the boat. This piece, according to its inventory card, was bought in Rome and is very similar in all discernible details to a piece in the Museo Nazionale Romano;9 it is possible they are from the same mold. Another very similar antefix is in the Ostia Museum;10 the Ostia antefix is from the Piazziale delle Corporazioni, and its date is given as the first century A.D. The only difference is that there is no male head for the cheniscos in the Ostia example. All other details, the number of loops in the sail, etc., are identical. A historical event described in Ammianus Marcellinus11 that involved both Rome and Ostia may be the subject of this antefix. It has been suggested that this scene represents the bringing of thè black stone, a symbol of Cybele, from Pessinus via the Port of Ostia to Rome in 204 B.c. A temple of Cybele was constructed on the Palatine in 193 B.c. to house this stone, and it was rebuilt in A.D. 3 by Augustus. The two antefixes from Rome may have been part of that rebuilding.12 If this antefix represents a historical event, it is unusual since most antefixes are not narrative in composition but merely represent generic maenads, silens, Pans, etc. There are two silen antefixes, one silen tile, and one Pan antefix, all of very different styles, inv. nos. 150, 8762, 145, and 151.

In contrast, inv. no. 145 (fig. 5.1.12) has very fine, hu- man features with a shaggy mustache and eyebrows, sharp nose, and sharply defined cheeks and may not be a silen at all but a river god. The Pan antefix, inv. no. 151 (fig. 5.1.13) is a common Hellenistic type. It has a very large head, with the chin overlapping the wide band that serves as a base. Most of the imbrex is preserved along with the gooseneck brace. There are holes where his horns (now missing) were to be inserted separately. Of the six theatrical masks in the Academy's collection, two are tragic masks, three are comic masks, and one is too fragmentary to determine whether it is tragic or comic.13 The two tragic masks are of very different types. Inv. no. 827 (fig. 5.1.14) is of medium size, with very exaggerated facial features; the mouth is wide open and frowning, and the eyes are represented 13 Inv. nos. 827, 3586, 144, 813, 3497, 1312.</page><page sequence="154">ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN ARCHITECTURAL TERRACOTTAS 14 1 Fig. 5.1.17 (far left).

The other mask, inv. no. 3586 (fig. 5.1.15), is smaller, has more human though still exaggerated features, and is probably meant to represent an old woman or female slave. Two of the comic masks are very similar, inv. nos. 144 and 813. All that remains are the faces with wide-open mouths, wide-spreading noses, bulging eyes, wrinkled foreheads, and caplike hair. It is impossible to say for certain whether these were antefixes or part of some other decorative scheme. The third comic mask, inv. no. 3497 (fig. 5.1.16) is better preserved; the face, as well as part of the surrounding tile, remain. The face is surrounded by an arch and is less exaggerated except for the wide-open mouth. The short hair, which preserves its red paint, stands upright and loose. Inv. no. 1312 lacks the lower half of its face; it is therefore impossible to determine whether it was a tragic or comic mask. A strut preserved on its back makes it likely that it was an antefix. Simas A large fragment of a palmette sima, inv. no. 8908 (fig. 5.1.17), preserves part of a lions head waterspout. All that remains is the proper left side of a lion s mane and ear, with two locks of the lion's mane springing upward over the upper band of the sima. The cavetto of the sima is carved with nine-petalled palmettes, which spring from leaves and, on the half-round below, are spirals. The carving is crisp and elegant. A second, well-preserved sima has a false spout in the form of a lion s head, inv. no. 148. This piece was merely ornamental and did not serve to shed water from a roof. The head is attached to an undecorated fascia, above which is a cornice. The lion's mouth is wide open as if to form a wa- terspout, but there is no hole through the fascia behind to direct the water off the roof. The lion's upper teeth are well defined, as are his muzzle, eyes, and forehead; his mane is rendered as separate spiral locks, and his ears are oval-shaped - all of this gives him a lively and fierce appearance. Waterspouts Three waterspouts are in the Academy's collection, one of a large lion's head and two of small dogs or wolves ( lupettes ). The lion's head, inv. no. 492 (fig. 5.1.18), is large and well modeled, with details added by somewhat crude incisions. It is not attached to any supporting cornice or imbrex.</page><page sequence="155">142 ANNA M. MOORE Fig. 5.1.19. Lupette waterspout ( inv . no. 149). The two lupette spouts are similar to each other, in that they represent small dogs with very erect, pointed ears, a full "mane." Both wear a collar; that of inv. no. 149 (fig. 5.1.19) with a bell attached and inv. no. 2132 with five beads and a bell. The imbrex of inv. no. 2132 is only partially preserved, while that of inv. no. 149 is almost complete; it forms the body of the dog and then turns upward to form a vertical tube or downspout. The downspout is decorated with the dog's thin tail looped in the shape of a question mark. This type of waterspout was used on the compluvium of houses, and there are many well-known examples from Pompeii. Friezes There are currendy twelve fragments of friezes in the collection.14 In 1938 there were twenty-five frieze fragments; some were decorated with palmettes and columns, some with Ionic details such as dentils.15 In 1948, a twenty-sixth frieze fragment was catalogued, inv. no. 1607. Unfortunately, in 1948 many of the architectural terracottas in the Academy's collection were discarded, including fourteen of these frieze fragments.16 The twelve remaining fragments are discussed below. The fragments vary in size and details but are all of the scale and type that could have been used on the compluvium of a house. Two, inv. nos. 845 and 820, preserve part of an opening for a waterspout. None of the remaining fragments forms a contiguous frieze, but some pieces can be grouped together based on clay, style, and workmanship. There are twelve fragments with palmettes; some have colonnettes; others have various details added. Eleven of these friezes were published by Simpson in 1938, who divided them into groups; they are discussed below according to these groups. One fragment, inv. no. 1607, not published by Simpson, is also discussed. Cornice with Ionic Decoration (Simpson's Group II.l) Eight cornice pieces were originally grouped together by Simpson based on the clay and workman- ship.17 Only one now remains, the other seven having been discarded in 1948. The one remaining piece, inv. no. 752, 18 preserves a cornice with Ionic details: a wide band at the top, a rather flat 14 Inv. nos. 792, 845, 814, 820, 804, 799, 818, 824, 854, 793, 797, 1607. 15 Simpson 1938, 1-4, pls. 1-2. 16 See n. 4 above. 17 Simpson's Group II.l, p. 3, pl. 2, nos. 1,2,3,4,9, 10, 11, 12. 18 Simpson 1938, pl. 2.4.</page><page sequence="156">ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN ARCHITECTURAL TERRACOTTAS 143 bead molding below, and below this wide-spaced dentils. The partially preserved fascia has thin, seven-petalled palmettes. This cornice, inv. no. 752, and the other seven that were discarded, may have belonged with four of the frieze fragments discussed below, inv. nos. 845, 814, 820, and 804 (Simpson Group IL2), but since only the upper part of this example and the lower part of the other example are preserved, it is impossible to determine whether they were identical.19 Frieze with Palmettes (Simpson's Group II.l) There were originally seven frieze pieces with thin, seven-petalled palmettes.20 Three of these pieces were discarded in 1948, leaving only four, inv. nos. 845, 814, 820, and 804. Two fragments preserve parts of openings for waterspouts, inv. nos. 845 and 820, so they were not merely decorative but were functional simas. They are similar in workmanship and clay to the cornice fragment that re- mains - discussed above, inv. no. 792 - but there are no joins. Frieze with Palmettes and Colonnettes (Simpson's Group II.2) Four pieces originally made up this group.21 One was discarded in 1948; the three remaining pieces, inv. nos. 799, 818, and 824, are very similar in scale to inv. nos. 845, 814, 820, and 804, but they differ in that, in addition to palmettes alternating with colonnettes, they also have a tongue-shaped cresting or merlons. Also, the treatment of the palmette petals in each of these fragments is differ- ent, two having petals that curl down, inv. nos. 799 and 824, and one with petals that alternate up and down, inv. no. 818. Cornice with Cyma Reversa (Simpson's Group III. 15) A slighdy different type, inv. no. 854, 22 differs from inv. nos. 799, 818, and 824 in that the spaces between the merlons are not cut out. Palmette and Colonnettes with Ionic Details (Simpson's Group III.4 and 5) Two other variations on this type, similar to each other but not identical, are inv. nos. 793 and 797. 23 Inv. no. 793 differs from the other types in the rendering of the palmettes and colonnettes and in the decoration of the cornice. The cornice of this fragment has a cyma reversa above the palmette frieze, with a bead and reel above; above this is an egg and dart topped with a very wide band, probably to receive a crowning ornament. Only one fragment of this type, inv. no. 797, was ever in the Academy's collection. Although it uses the same decorative elements as inv. no. 793, it has a different treatment in its style and in its decoration of the cornice. Its cornice begins above the palmette frieze with a cyma reversa, a bead and reel above this, and finally a small egg and dart. Nine-Petalled Palmette with Colonnettes This fragment, inv. no. 1607 (not published by Simpson), has a nine-petalled palmette, with col- onnette in between in high relief. In scale and decoration it resembles the other types, but the 19 Simpson 1938, 3. 20 Simpson, Group II.l, pl. 2, nos. 5, 6, 7, 8, 13, 14, 15. 21 Simpson 1938, 3, pl. 1.7, 8, 9, 10. 22 Simpson 1938, 4, Group DI. 15. 23 Simpson 1938, 3, Group III.4 and 5.</page><page sequence="157">144 ANNA M. MOORE execution of the relief is quite different. In addition, it is attached to a flat pan tile, whereas all the others, where the lower edge is preserved, are rabbeted for insertion into a slot for attaching the sima to its supporting member. Miscellaneous The 23 small fragments of architectural terracottas have been grouped into five categories: (1) Cresting Fragments; (2) Cavetto with Anthemion; (3) Ionic Fragments; (4) Doric Fragments; and (5) Volutes, Palmettes, and Miscellaneous Fragments. Some categories have only one piece.24 There are three fragments from crestings. The first two, inv. nos. 8915 and 8164, have swirling, pierced designs that were common crowning elements in the second and first centuries B.c. The third, inv. no. 147, is a solid tile with a seven-petalled palmette; the tile has a rabbet along its upper edge to receive a further crowning element. The cavetto fragment in the Academy's collection, inv. no. 8916, is of the type that was used to crown the revetments; such revetments were popular during the fourth through the first centuries B.c. The decoration is very weathered, but a leaf and three-petalled palmette can be distinguished. Four fragments preserve details of Ionic decoration. Inv. no. 5024 is a fragment of an egg and dart on which are preserved traces of red paint. Inv. no. 8160 is a corner fragment of an Ionic bead and reel. Inv. no. 1327 is a very small cornice preserving a cyma reversa, half-round, and four Ionic dentils. Inv. no. 2446 is the fluted sheathing for a small wooden column, on which the arrises of the fluting are sharp and rest on a well-defined base. Inv. no. 819, a Doric (?) frieze fragment, is an unusual piece in that it combines long tongues (or strigils) in very high relief, with a small triglyph and metope frieze above and a merlon topping the frieze. There are fourteen additional very small fragments from various parts of volutes, palmettes, and other designs too small to identify. Architectural Fragments from Greece Three fragments are recorded as coming from Greece, one from Epidauros, inv. no. 8165, and two from Delphi, inv. nos. 8749 and 4808 (fig. 5.1.20). They are of three very different types and were added to the Academy's collection at different times by various people. The palmette antefix from Epidauros, inv. no. 8165, made of fine orange-beige terracotta, is a nine-petalled antefix with rounded, fleshy petals. From Delphi comes a rectangular tile with a painted, seven-petalled palmette curving upward toward a central petal, inv. no. 8749, which looks as if it was painted using a stencil. Delphi is also the provenance given for a very unusual antefix (if it is an antefix at all) made of a very fine brown terracotta resembling pottery fabric more than architectural terracotta fabric, inv. no. 4808 (fig. 5.1.20). Its surface, which is not slipped, is very smooth and shiny and looks as if it could have been burnished, though there are no signs on the front or back that would indicate this is so. It is very small in scale and preserves only the barest abstraction of a lotus flower in relief. 24 Inv. nos. 8915, 8164, 147, 8916, 5024, 8160, 1327, 2446, 819. The following pieces are fragments of volutes, palmettes, and miscellaneous elements: inv. nos. 8917, 8919, 898, 8753, 8914, 8755, 8754, 8752, 8746, 8747, 8748, 1620, 828, 8734.</page><page sequence="158">ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN ARCHITECTURAL TERRACOTTAS 145 Fig. 5.1.20 (far left). Lotus bud plaque ( inv . no. 4808). Fig. 5.1.21 (near left). Male (?) head (inv. no. 8745). In plan, this piece is curved, convex on the front, concave on the back. In profile, it is L-shaped. The horizontal element is not flat but bows slighdy upward, though not enough to be a cover tile. It is likely that this piece was not architectural terracotta at all but rather part of some ceremonial dish or platter. Architectural (?) Sculptural fragments Twelve terracotta fragments may have come from architectural sculpture.25 Such sculptural terra- cottas appeared on buildings in a number of locations: the ridgepole, the pediment, the lateral simas as antefixes, the apex and corners of the pediment as akroteria, and as relief plaques over the ends of the columen and mutuli.26 Of these twelve sculptural fragments in the Academy collection, seven are heads, one a chest and abdomen, one a hand, and three feet. None of these pieces seem to belong together, even though they are of similar scale, i.e., approximately two-thirds life size. They are too big to have been vo- tives. The seven heads were probably not antefixes because they are all larger than most antefix heads, about two-thirds life size. Also, three heads, inv. nos. 8735, 8745 (fig. 5.1.21), and 8763, are hollow, which would make it difficult to attach the head to a base or cover tile. One head, inv. no. 8759, is almost in the round; antefix heads are usually shallower and more two-dimensional since they are to be viewed from only one direction. Inv. no. 6295 is flat, very abraded, but with a well-defined eye. Another head is in three-quarter view, inv. no. 8760, and one, inv. no. 8761, is in profile; antefix heads usually face directly forward. A hollow fragment of an abdomen and chest, inv. no. 1565, probably represents a reclining figure, based on the way the body is slighdy bent at the waist. The abdomen below the navel is covered by drapery in two catenary folds; this may be the bottom edge of a molded cuirass, as on the pediment figure from Cosa.27 This fragment may have been part of a group; relief groups were commonly used as columen plaques or akroteria. The fragment of a hand, inv. no. 2432, shows a loosely closed hand from the wrist down, with the smallest finger tightly curled and the index finger only slightly closed. One side of the hand is 25 Inv. nos. 8735, 8745, 8759, 6295, 8760, 8761, 8763, 1565, 2432, 1684, 3495, 1467. 26 Colonna 1985, 61-63, fig. 3.1 has a detailed drawing show- ing these locations; see also p. 65, the terracotta model from the Sanctuary of Nemi, which shows the pediment of a temple and the locations of sculptural decoration. 27 Brown, Richardson, and Richardson 1960, 314, fig. 2.</page><page sequence="159">146 ANNA M. MOORE broken in a way that suggests that the hand was held against the side of the body. The interior of the hand is solid and does not indicate that any object was being held. A thick cuff of drapery, not modeled in any detail, ends at the wrist. Two of the feet have boots, inv. nos. 1684 and 1467, while a third, inv. no. 1684, represents a right foot covered with a squared-toed, thick-soled calceus , or closed boot.28 The foot is covered to the arch with thick drapery, so no straps or laces are visible. There are no preserved traces of paint. The fragment does not preserve any signs of how the piece was attached to a base or building. Inv. no. 1467 is a fragment of a foot from the ankle down. It is enclosed in a round-toed calceus , which preserves most of its original black paint. The foot is fully modeled on three sides and has a vertical flange along the back of the heel and ankle, which suggests that the figure was attached to its background along the back of the ankle and leg, and that the sculpture was therefore viewed frontally at least from the waist down. Inv. no. 3495 preserves a solid, bare foot, broken away at the juncture of the foot and ankle. The foot, which was painted red, rests on a thick base painted a darker red. Based on the red color the foot probably belonged to a male figure. There are no indications of a sandal or boot; the nails and joints of the toes are carefully detailed, and the last two toes bend and curl under. 28 Goldman 1994, 116.

Campana Reliefs Shelley Stone Campana were used reliefs to ornament are a class the of rectangular rooflines and terracotta walls of plaques Roman decorated buildings with in Italy; relief only sculpture a few have that were used to ornament the rooflines and walls of Roman buildings in Italy; only a few have been found in the western provinces.1 They were used as revetments, simas, and wall crowns. The name "Campana" is a conventional one; the first examples published (in 1842 and 1851) were in the Campana Collection, and they became popular after their installation in the Louvre in 1863. 2 They were mainly made in central Italy, especially the environs of Rome, where they continued the Etruscan tradition of decorating buildings with terracotta reliefs.3 Versions/imitations were also produced at various towns in Italy.4 Campana reliefs were made from the second quarter of the first century B.c. until the middle of the second century A.D., but their period of greatest popularity was the age of the Julio-Claudian emperors.5 The plaques were made of coarse clay with much added grog and then cast in molds. The molds allowed production in series, which show some variation in the depictions as new genera- tions of molds were revised.6 Some of the early reliefs have a coating of fine clay that covers their outer surface to provide a smooth base for painting; but more commonly, a thick white slip like that used on terracotta figurines was used to prepare the surface for painting.7 The motifs used on the reliefs are primarily decorative, even when they depict figures from mythology, and often present symmetrical compositions.8 The plaques were usually placed along the roofline of a building (or top 1 The most comprehensive publication is still Rohden and Winnefeld 1911, although it is now quite dated. G. Rossini, in Gualtieri, Rossini, and Moroni 2002, 148-150, examines the class and provides the most recent comprehensive bibliography. Borbein 1968 studies a few of the series in depth. Tortorella 1981a provides a concise examination of the sources for several of the iconographie types depicted. Calderone 1975 and Rizzo 1976-1977 examine the archi- tectural setting of the reliefs. For plaques found (and made) outside Italy, see Gualtieri, Rossini, and Moroni 2002, 149. 2 They were published by Campana, Antiche opera in plas- tica, discoperte, raccolte, e dichiarate dal marchese G. Pietro Campana , which initially appeared in Rome in 1842, with an expanded second edition in 1851. On the vicissitudes of the Campana collection, see Borowitz and Borowitz 1991. Several Campana plaques can be seen displayed in the frontispiece to the 1851 edition oí Antiche opera , reprinted as figure 6 in Borowitz and Borowitz 1991. The real fame of the plaques derives from their installation in the Louvre in 1863 : Borowitz and Borowitz 1991, 167 and fig. 34. 3 See Tortorella 1981a, 61-67; Rohden and Winnefeld 1911; Borbein 1968, 13, 20-28.

Rectangular relief depicting a palaestra (inv. no. 136). of a doorway) as a continuous frieze and may form an iconographie sequence.9 Each plaque has a base and a crowning molding; some have a "tongue" on the bottom for insertion into a groove on the top of a sima or geison, while others have nail holes, showing that they served as revetments.10 The style is generally classicizing, although occasional archaistic features appear, and a few series show scenes of Roman daily life in a more "plebeian" style.11 The American Academy has ten Campana plaques in its collection, of which nine are quite fragmentary. Only inv. no. 6289, which apparently came from Arezzo, preserves any indication of a provenance. It is reasonable to assume that most, if not necessarily all, of the others were found in Rome. Inv. no. 136 (fig. 5.2.1) is nearly complete and presents the general format of the class. It depicts six Corinthian columns of two differing heights, apparendy to distinguish between a colonnaded palaestra and a temple of Roman type located axially within the palaestra. In the temple is a bearded cult statue of Hercules standing at the center, on a base framed by the taller columns of the porch. In the intercolumniations of the smaller columns of the colonnade stand statues of athletes; those on Hercules s right are boxers, while those on the left depict respectively an apoxyomenos and a victor crowning himself.12 Reliefs of this type have been found in large numbers in the area of the Gardens of Sallust in Rome and presumably decorated a building (a house?) in that region.13 Inv. 9 See, for example, the plaques with the Horae described below (inv. no. 6289). 10Rohden and Winnefeld 191 1,30-47; Borbein 1968, 14-17. 11 Rohden and Winnefeld 1911, 49-56.

Fragment depicting part of a winged Victory figure ( inv . no. 2110). Fig. 3.2.3. Rectangular relief depicting a maenad and the Hora of Winter (inv. no. 6289). no. 136 is probably one of these. Bendinelli suggested that the sanctuary depicted corresponds to the Sanctuary of Hercules Musarum, between the Circus Flaminius and the Porticus Octaviae, although some scholars doubt that there is a temple in the relief and identify its setting as simply a palaestra .14 Although the surface of inv. no. 136 is abraded, the proportions of the figures and the overall quality of the relief suggest that it dates to the Julio-Claudian period. Inv. no. 2110 (fig. 5.2.2) is a representative of one of the most common series of Campana plaques, which depicts Victories killing steers. The American Academy's plaque is an example of Borbein s series II, in which opposed Victories kneel on the backs of steers while cutting the steers' throats.15 The strongly classicizing style of the relief would suggest a date in the early Julio-Claudian period. Inv. no. 6289 (fig. 5.2.3) is the most interesting relief of the collection since it preserves a unique version of a common series that depicts the Horae.16 In the Academy's relief, of which some two- thirds is preserved, we find only the Hora of Winter carrying game she has slain. Normally she precedes the Hora of Fall, who either carries pomegranates and grapes in the folds of her mantle or holds a dish with fruit in her left hand, while her right hand holds a kid by its front feet.17 In the Academy example, this figure has been modified into a maenad holding half of the kid behind her in her right hand, while in her left hand she holds a thyrsus. She looks back over her right shoulder, presumably toward the Horae of Spring and Summer, who were normally depicted on the preceding plaque. opposed Tritons on examples preserving the pediment: see above n. 10. 14 See Bendinelli 1956, 559-563; Marabini Moevs 1981, 47-48.

Fig. 5.2.5 (near left). Fragment of a griffin, attacking an Amazon (?) (inv. no. 491). The reason for the modification is relatively easily explained by the association of the Horae with Dionysus. This connection is well documented: the god accompanied the goddesses of the seasons at the marriage of Peleus and Thetis. In depictions of Dionysus and the Horae, however, these divini- ties generally carry no attributes.18 By the Augustan period, they apparendy could serve much the same iconographical function as maenads since on Italian terra sigillata vessels the Horae alternate with satyrs.19 In a few other depictions of the Hora of Autumn she holds a thyrsus, an attribute as- sociated with the season when wine was made.20 The Academy relief appears to be well along in the Campana relief series since the figures are elongated and not as crisp as those on other reliefs of the same series.21 The relief likely dates to the late first century or early second century A.D. An old label states that it was found at Arezzo; recent archeometric research at Ossaia near Cortona (close to Arezzo) has established that Campana reliefs were both brought to that region from Rome (or its environs) and made locally.22 The iconographie changes in the Academy plaque may indicate that it was made in Arezzo, but archeometric testing will be needed to establish its place of manufacture. Inv. nos. 7919 and 491 (figs. 5.2.4-5) both preserve a portion of the same scene, with opposed griffins attacking collapsing Amazons.23 Inv. no. 7919 (fig. 5.2.4) preserves the Amazon on the left 18 See L.

She is being clawed on the left shoulder by a griffin while pushing with her left hand beneath his beak. Inv. no. 491 (fig. 5.2.5) has the left griffins head with the Amazon s left hand. The composition was symmetrical, with opposed griffins, one facing left and the other right, each attacking an Amazon facing outward from the center. The two fragments in our collection therefore cannot come from the same plaque since both of them preserve the left hand of the Amazon with the griffin s beak. This particular iconographical scheme can be traced back to the fourth century B.c. and was likely to have evolved in the Near East.25 Erica Simon has shown that the scheme was used under the Empire to symbolize Rome s dominance over its foreign enemies;26 this would suggest that both inv. nos. 7919 and 491 date to the late first century B.c. or the first century A.D. The remaining fragments are quite small. Inv. no. 1314 shows part of a scene in which opposed winged lions faced each other over a krater,27 while inv. no. 821 has part of a frontal figure wearing an elaborate helmet and can be identified as part of a scene in which dancing Hierodouloi faced a central Palladion.28 Taken as a group, the Academy's collection, even though fragmentary and incomplete, gives an idea of the iconographical types and variety of these characteristically Italic architectural decorations. 24 For a complete example of the composition: Simon 1962, 775-776, pl.

Molded and Painted Plaster Fragments Anne Laidlaw The ments, collection divided of roughly plaster between at the American molded and Academy flat painted in Rome pieces, consists along of with 72 a heterogeneous few oddments frag- such ments, divided roughly between molded and flat painted pieces, along with a few oddments such as parts of plaster fluting and two molds for ceiling coffers. They were gathered from a number of unrecorded sites by mainly unidentified collectors, though certainly Thomas Ashby, Esther Van De- man, and A. W. Van Buren must have been among them, as well as any of the Fellows over the past hundred years who may have picked up stray bits in the course of their travels. Thus, almost without exception, the fragments could have come from any place that any Roman painter/craftsman ever worked; on the basis of style, however, I would suggest that most of them are from the areas around Rome or Campania, with the Roman Campagna and Pompeii being the most likely provenances. The fragments were originally inventoried by A.W. Van Buren in a two-volume manuscript on the antiquities in the collection of the American Academy.1 The listings of stucco start with inv. no. 449 and occur sporadically in various hands in black ink up to 3292 in volume 1 and again from 3292 to 8788 in volume 2. According to this catalogue, many stucco fragments were stored in various boxes and envelopes that were labeled, generally illegibly, in Thomas Ashby s handwriting; most of these were apparently discarded, probably by Frank E. Brown when he was head of the School of Classical Studies of the Academy in 1948 since these listings are crossed out in pencil, often followed by the initials FEB in his handwriting. In any case, each entry simply lists a single measurement and a brief description on a single line, as, for example, "[inv. no.] 1781 - 0.24. Relief stucco molding. Cymatium with alternating palmette and acanthus." In rare cases, such as the entry for the fragment of a revetment of a Doric column (inv. no. 2287), there is even a penciled notation on the fragment itself. The legible part reads "Villa - " (name illegible) and the date "16/3/0-" (number illegible). So we know that this fragment came from a villa and was found by Thomas Ashby on 16 March, sometime between 1900 and 1909, a tantalizing but hardly informative label. A more frustrating entry reads, "Within an envelope, marked in Dr. Ashby s handwriting, 'Anzio/Painted plaster', was a cardboard tray marked 'Anzio 24/2/98 (above Arco Muto)'. With the fragments in the box was a strip of paper marked, also in Dr. Ashby s handwriting, 'Anzio 24/2/98 (above Arco Muto)'." Under this comment are the listings for inv. nos. 1761 to 1775, each with a single measurement and a list of colors; there is also a penciled line drawn through each one, which must indicate that all of them were thrown out since none is still in our collection. The fragments that remain were inventoried in 1968 by Barbara Beggs Bini as part of Frank E. Brown s project to inventory the entire collection of Academy antiquities; inevitably, these catalogue 1 Van Buren 1924-1959. References to "the catalogue" in this contribution are to the catalogue that the author made when she organized all the stucco material in the AAR collection. The catalogue has since been incorporated into the database, but this unpublished work, which contains important com- ments on the individual pieces, now resides in the group of manuscripts related to the AAR collection kept in the Norton-Van Buren Room.</page><page sequence="168">MOLDED AND PAINTED PLASTER FRAGMENTS 155 entries are simply descriptive of patterns and colors, sometimes useful for identifying which frag- ment is which but not otherwise informative. Until 2001, the only published piece of plaster in the entire collection (inv. no. 4801) was used by Van Buren in the 1930s in an experiment to determine whether heat would alter the color of yellow ochre to red.2 This fragment originally had a yellow ochre ground, bordered by two parallel friezes in shades of white, pale blue, and olive green. There is a black smear where a heated stick of charcoal was applied to the stucco; below this the fragment has turned dull red, while the upper half (which was protected from the heat in Van Bürens experi- ment) has remained yellow, thus proving his point. Van Buren conducted this test in the Casa del Menandro (1.10.4) in Pompeii, so in this instance we do have a provenance, but this is virtually the only relatively secure one in the entire collection. Since this house has numerous rooms, and we have no indication from which room Van Buren s fragment was taken, the only way to date it is by style, as with the other examples discussed in the catalogue. Methodology About half the pieces, with few exceptions, are fragments of three-dimensional molded designs. In the first section of the catalogue manuscript, I have categorized these by their hypothetical locations within the original decorations, arranged under the following categories: Ceilings and Coffers, Architectural Moldings, Friezes from Wall Crowns, Modeled Wall Patterns, and Column Revetments. Since the moldings and friezes were intended either to crown decorations or to separate major zones in a larger painting, I have attempted only to restore the basic repeating designs by having them traced on acetate paper,3 and then to fill in the missing parts of the patterns. Because of the fragmentary nature of the pieces, it is often impossible to distinguish their orientation (that is, whether my placement of patterns in the restored drawings is right side up). I have relied on the profiles where these are sufficiently preserved, but in almost every case they are too battered to be much help. Thus, it is perfectly possible to read a number of the patterns either way, and, in fact, in Pompeii the same pattern may be found in either orientation as well. The order in the catalogue and the tentative dates are based on the categories of patterns developed by Ulrike Riemenschnei- der, whose comprehensive but disorganized thesis on Pompeian stucco moldings of the Third and Fourth Styles was published in 1986, 4 and on analogies with moldings in situ in Pompeii drawn by Thomas Frölich.5 The other group consists of flat fragments of painted figurai or geometric decorations. I have identified these pieces, where possible, by style, following the system that August Mau developed for Pompeian decorations,6 which in some instances can indicate an approximate date. I have arranged 2 Van Buren 1932, 40-54 and esp. 50-51, with color pl. 12, fig. 5. All the fragments discussed here were published, some in color, in Laidlaw 2001, 201-218. 3 1 am grateful to Hélène Eristov, Centre d'Étude des Pein- tures Murales Romaines (C.N.R.S.), who kindly came down from Paris in January 1995 to make the original tracings of all the fragments in the initial stages of this research. 4 Riemenschneider 1986. Since she puts the drawings of the profiles in various sections apart from the drawings of their patterns, and then divides the descriptions of these patterns into different groupings by style, her book is extremely diffi- cult to use; she does, however, provide a fairly comprehensive collection of the preserved moldings. 5 1 wish to thank Thomas Frölich, who was then a member of the Deutsches Archäologisches Institut in Rome, first for examining the original fragments and discussing them with me in 1995, and then for giving me copies of his own draw- ings to use as comparative material here. 6 Mau 1882, 1:7-10.</page><page sequence="169">156 ANNE LAIDLAW Fig. 5.3.1. Fragment of a thin molded ceiling partly encased in terracotta (inv. no. 8839). Fig. 5.3.2. Molded division between two ceiling coffers (inv. no. 8910). them in categories by subject matter: Figurai Motifs, Floral Motifs, Architectural and Decorative Motifs, and Miscellaneous (a fragment of a wall or fountain mosaic and a horizontal fillet). In order to give some idea of where the designs of our fragments may have fitted into an entire decorative system, I have consulted a number of illustrated publications, mainly from the nineteenth century, concentrating on renderings of whole wall decorations. I realize that these early publications are often inaccurate, since they were intended to be used more as pattern books than as precise ar- chaeological records, and that the authors are often extremely vague about locations or even omit the provenance altogether.7 Many of the basic motifs that can be deciphered, however, do recur in fairly specific positions in the nineteenth-century copies, whereas finding precise and unfaded analogies on original walls in Pompeii is, in most cases, impossible today. As highlights of the collection of plaster fragments I have tried to select typical examples from the various categories and, in a few cases, pieces such as the fragment showing a figure of a woman (inv. no. 8378, fig. 5.3.7) and the one with the Pegasus (inv. no. 8862, fig. 5.3.10) that I thought were outstanding, either in subject matter or quality or both. Dimensions and references to analo- gies and bibliography are given in the notes, or, in a few cases, in the text. Three-Dimensional Molded fragments Almost all the molded fragments can be identified with some assurance since the profiles (where decipherable) and most of the patterns are found both in plaster and in stone examples all over the Greco-Roman world. Molded ceilings are indicated by the thinness of the backplate, the light composition of the plaster with an excess of lime in it, and, of course, by analogies to the subjects in relief with which they are decorated. The separate panels were originally divided into squares and diamonds and rhomboids by tiny moldings of egg and dart or sometimes by a Lesbian cymatium. Inv. no. 8839 (fig. 5.3.1)8 is of especial interest, since it not only has preserved the molded legs of some sort of quadruped and a part of the tiny egg-and-dart frame, but it also has traces of what may have 7 The restorations in the Niccolini family's four elephant folios (Niccolini 1854-1896), for example, often have the colors or even locations transposed, but they are still useful for showing possible locations for individual elements or motifs in the overall pattern. 8 Dimensions: 0.132 m x 0.11 m, with backplate 0.006 m thick.

This could have been part of the packing used for shipping, though that is only hypothetical since so little of it is preserved.9 The Academy collection also includes parts of ceiling coffers and molds for making the interior designs. Inv. no. 8910 (fig. 5.3 .2)10 preserves the division between two coffers, with egg-and-dart and ribbon moldings. It is made of heavy white plaster, much thicker than that of inv. no. 8939, and was probably decorated with molded rosettes and flowers, as in the Second Style decoration in the north ala of the Casa del Criptoportico (1.6.2) in Pompeii, which is dated to the mid-first century b.c. Inv. no. 8837 (fig. 5.3 .3) 11 is a plaster mold used to form one of the central rosettes in a similar coffer, one of two examples in the collection. There are also two fragmentary designs that were actually modeled in low relief, which could have come from a number of different contexts. Inv. no. 8906 (fig. 5.3 .4) 12 is the more intriguing of the two since it has widely separated parallels in both placement and time. On a very thick plaster backing the pattern has been modeled in white raised outlines and figures against flat red, blue, and white grounds. A gabled white aedicula encloses a deer with a tree on the left and traces of a human (?) figure (only the head is preserved as a kind of blob), which the animal faces on the right, on a red ground. Centered inside the peak of the white gable is a candelabrum, the lower part done in flat blue paint and the top in modeled white stucco. To the left of the aedicula the upper part of another modeled white candelabrum is preserved, set against a blue ground and partly shaped as a frontal winged figure brandishing a torch (?) in its left hand; above this, in a rectangular jogged space outlined by a raised white line, there is a white flower on a red ground that extends over the aedicula, evidently from the very top of the original painting since it is finished with raw white plaster above the painted and modeled designs. 9 1 know of no example of terracotta used for packing plaster decorations, but occasionally subject paintings in Pompeii have been set into the wall in a terracotta frame, which implies that they were bought separately and then attached; and small mosaics were definitely sold in terracotta trays, as in the example of the tondo of colored fish that originally decorated oecus 29 in VIL6.38 (Laidlaw 1985, 256 with n. 151). 10 Dimensions: 0.28 m x 0.28 m, with W. of both ribbon and egg-and-dart moldings, 0.03 m apiece.

The thickness of the backing suggests that it may have come from a wall painting (as, for example, the modeled painting on the west side of the palaestra in the Stabian Baths in Pompeii), though parallels can also be found in vaults and ceilings. An early example was the compartmented ceiling in Neros Domus Aurea, now lost but restored in the library of the Escoriai in Spain;13 the original should be dated between A.D. 64 and 68, or late Third/early Fourth Style in Pompeian terms. Perhaps a better and more likely parallel is in the Tomb of the Pancratii, the so-called Painted Tomb on the Via Latina, which is dated by Mielsch between A.D. 160 and 170.14 Since the Roman Campagna is littered with the remains of tombs and villas of many periods, and was readily available to Academy scholars, I suspect that our fragment came from one of these rather than from a more distant location such as Pompeii or Campania; there are, however, no records, so this must remain simply a conjecture. By far the largest number of fragments (27 in all) are painted molded friezes that presumably originally crowned or delineated sections of Third or Fourth Style - or later - decorations; there is also one fragment of a heavy dentil cornice (inv. no. 8911) that undoubtedly crowned a First Style wall. All our molded friezes have differing patterns, but a number fit into the general classifications of Riemenschneider. In a few examples (inv. nos. 8889, 8838, 8851, 8892, and 8887) there are traces of vertical indentations splitting the designs of lotus or palmettes, and sometimes even the stria- tions of the grain left by the wooden molds used to form the repeating patterns in the wet plaster. Inv. nos. 8882, 8865, 8886 (cf. figs. 5.3.5a-b)15 constitute an example of an anthemion with a flattened cyma reversa (?) profile consisting of circumscribed clover alternating with three-leaved 13 For a colored photo, see Bianchi Bandinelli 1970, 161 ill. 174. 14 Mielsch 1975, 92, with discussion pp. 90-92 and detailed description pp. 171-72, cat. no.

The frieze can be read either way: the reconstruction arbitrarily places the palmettes upside down. The clover leaves are balanced on the open ends of the arches, which double as the ends of reversed volutes curving outward in an oblique S-shape to support the palmettes. The red ground inside the arches alternates with the yellow ground of the palmettes; the V-shaped spaces between the arches and the volutes are purple. This is a fairly small frieze, with a height of 2.5 cm, or only about an inch high. Since it is so small, it was presumably located at a lower level than the wall crown in the original design. The parallel from the Casa di Fabio Rufo (fig. 5.3.5c; see n. 15), on the other hand, is twice this size and is located at the very top of the wall. Since Riemenschneider dates the almost identical example from the Casa di Polibio (fig. 5.3 .5 d) to the Fourth Style, if her chronology is correct, our fragment should be dated to the second half of the first century A.D. Another typical but much larger example, inv. no. 8893 (fig. 5.3 .6), 16 is an anthemion alternat- ing hearts and long-petaled lotus. The spread petals arch over the pointed heart-shaped element, which ends in volutes that curve inward to support a three-petaled flower or clover inside the heart. A smaller secondary volute extends outward from the bottom of the heart on either side to support the base of the lotus. The raised outlines and flowers are white, with a red background above the lotus, blue between it and the heart, and red-purple inside it. The profile of the frieze is virtually flat, with narrow V-shaped projecting moldings along top and bottom, so, as often, it is impossible to determine which way the pattern was intended to be seen. Traces of a close parallel of the overall design are still extant in the men's caldańum in the Forum Baths in Pompeii (VII.5.2) with pointed hearts and lilies, but the interiors of the hearts have a totally different form of flower.17 The hearts encasing palmettes in the tablinum of VIII.4.4 are a variant on the same theme, but without the alternation of lilies;18 those in the lower molding of the lunette in a Fourth Style cubiculum (1.1 1.1, cub. 2) are perhaps a closer parallel but so poorly preserved that 21 and the room left of oecus 12, both in the Casa di Fabio Rufo (catalogue description 306-307 with n. 1382; profiles on p. 457). She describes the frieze from the Casa di Polibio as "an ornamental plaster molding of the Fourth Style" (218-219 with catalogue description p. 302, drawing of pat- tern on p. 514). Since the examples from Pompeii collected by Thomas Frolich are so similar, they should probably also date to the 70s A.D. There is, however, no reason why this pattern did not continue in use after that time. 16 Dimensions: 0.152 m x 0.105 m, with H. of frieze, 0.065 m. Laidlaw 2001, 206 and color pl. 13.

Flat Fragments The identification of the flat painted pieces presents more of a challenge, or at least a leap of faith. A few are fairly obvious as, for example, inv. no. 8854 (fig. 5.3.13), which must come from a pre- della; inv. no. 8852 (fig. 5.3.15), which is clearly part of a Second Style painted cornice below a drafted panel; inv. no. 8853 (fig. 5.3.16), which was part of a Third Style epistyle; and inv. no. 8864 (fig. 5.3.17), which preserves the pattern of a vertical Third Style frieze. The identifications of the remainder are based mainly on analogies. The selection here provides a fairly good overview of what is in the Academy collection, but the suggestions as to original locations on the painted walls and the tentative dates should be taken with a shakerful of salt. Inv. no. 8378 is the only fragment in the entire collection that must have come from some form of a subject painting (fig. 5.3 . 7 ).20 It preserves the head of a young woman with short dark curly hair bound with a yellow fillet, placed against a simple architectural background. This consists of a square white pillar partly covered by a pleated red curtain and is set at an angle in front of a slighdy lower gray wall with a trace of blue sky above it. The woman wears a mantle over her shoulders, knotted at the base of her throat, and looks down somewhat pensively to her left. She is perhaps the attendant at some sort of ceremony in an open temple precinct, with her attention directed to more important figures, now lost. The colors are soft and muted grays and violets, the only bright spots being the yellow fillet and the red curtain. The technique is very sketchy, with thick white brush strokes for highlights, and the quality of the painting is not that fine. 19 This is also labeled by Riemenschneider 1986 as her Frieze No. 183 but except for the hearts is slighdy different in pat- tern. She locates it in the triclinium, but a very poor photo of it in PPM 1990.2, 508 fig. 2 shows it along the bottom of the lunette in the cubiculum. 20 Dimensions: 0.125 m x 0.09 m. Laidlaw 2001, 21 1-212, and color pl. 1 1. Comparanda: According to Professor Lawrence Richardson, jr (personal correspondence 30 May 1995): "The limited palette of soft grays and violet and lack of effect of chiaroscuro suggest that this is late Second or early Third Style. One thinks of the figures in the bath suite of the Casa del Criptoportico, the genre pictures in the south oecus of the Casa di Obellio Firmo in Pompeii, and the subject pictures in the large oecus of the Casa di Augusto on the Palatine in Rome. This could well come from a genre or gynacaeum composition, and better than from a mythological subject. ... I do not think that it comes from Pompeii or Herculaneum It shows certain affinities with the Aldobrandini Wedding, which is Third Style, as bits of the decorative frame show, [which] comes from the neighborhood of the Esquiline cemetery. I believe it represents rather the passage of a young woman into the afterlife, an initiation rather than a wedding, and probably came from a tomb, one of the last to be built before the destruction of that cemetery."</page><page sequence="174">MOLDED AND PAINTED PLASTER FRAGMENTS 161 Fig. 5.3.9 (far left). Fragment of a yellow harpy perched on an epistyle or candelabrum against a black ground (inv. no. 8859). Fig. 5.3.10 (near left). Fragment of a winged Pegasus in shades of green against a black ground (inv. no. 8862). Inv. no. 8874 (fig. 5.3.8)21 also shows a figure, an orange putto with green wings on a black ground. He has his left leg bent, as if he were climbing or swinging from what appear to be traces of a green flowered vine. The colors and subject suggest that this fragment formed part of a vertical or horizontal frieze decorated with an undulating vine interspersed with putti, a motif found in all four styles of Pompeian painting. There are also a number of fragmentary but identifiable mythological figures, including a harpy and two sphinxes (inv. no. 8856 and inv. no. 8860). Inv. no. 8859 (fig. 5.3.9)22 represents a yellow harpy with a long tail and spread wings, perched on a curvilinear motif against a black ground. Her hair is knotted at the back, and she wears a crown. Behind her, to the viewer's left, there are traces of a yellow vertical design ending in a volute with a red center, and there was originally another curvilinear pattern to the right. A yellow horizontal element crossing under the harpy's tail seems to have formed the base for her perch. If this represents an architrave, she may have represented an akroterion on the right end of an epistyle above an aedicula; she could also have been the crowning element of an ornate candelabrum in a vertical frieze between two panel paintings, as in an example from the Casa dei Cervi (VI.21) in Herculaneum. By far the highest quality of painting in the entire collection (inv. no. 8862) is a fragment of a Pegasus (fig. 5.3. 10)23 of which the wings, back, and part of the head are preserved. It is painted in a miniaturistic style, with carefully articulated details of the individual feathers in the wings. The body 21 Dimensions: 0.07 m x 0.052 m. Laidlaw 2001, 208, fig. 14.8. Comparanda: The two fragments with putti from the House of the Skeleton on Cosa belong unequivocally to a late First Style context (Bruno 1970, 237-239; Bruno and Scott 1993, 147). For an exhaustive analysis of the famous Second Style example in Pompeii, from the Villa dei Misteri above the megalographic frieze in oecus 5, see Pappalardo 1982, which he dates to the second quarter of the first century - B.c. (p. 271). For a list with bibliography of other parallels for painted undulating friezes ("fregi a girali"), see his note 9, p. 252. The frieze of putti in the Casa del Menandro in Pompen (1.10.4, oecus 11: PPM 1990.2, 298-299, figs. 90-91) should be Third Style in date, but the motif has a long his- tory in other media as well, especially on sarcophagi and carved stone friezes (e.g., the pillars in the Seveřan basilica in Leptis Magna). 22 Dimensions: 0.095 m x 0.13 m; H. of figure ca. 0.05 m.

Comparanda: In Pompeii, the most common examples of flying animals are placed in the centers of panels, in either the main zone or on the socle, usually on a black ground. Two close parallels in Pompeii, both of winged animals on black socles, are in exedra o of the Casa degli Epigrammi (V. 1.1 8; the entire wall is illustrated in color in Laidlaw 2001, pl. 15, from a watercolor by Niccolini 1854-1896, 3:pl. 40), and in triclinium 15 in the Casa del Poeta Tragico (VI.8.3/5), both illustrated in PPM 1991.3, 555 fig. 32 and 1993.4, 567 fig. 77b, also from watercolors by Niccolini. These are done in the Fourth Style, but in the Casa della Danzatrice (VI.2.22), cubiculum 10, the flying animal is placed on the central panel of the main zone against a red ground, in a Third Style context (PPM 1993.4, 248 fig. 37, from a watercolor by Zahn). Perhaps the best parallel is on the socle of triclinium 18 in the Casa del Menandro (1.10.4), illustrated in PPM 1990.2, 340-341 figs. 158-159, which is clearly a Pegasus on a black ground.</page><page sequence="175">162 ANNE LAIDLAW Fig. 5.3. 1 1 (near right). Fragment of a leopard biting the neck of a fawn ( inv . no. 8868). Fig. 5.3.12 (far right). Fragment of a leopard (?) on a narrow horizontal wreath of olive or laurel leaves separating black and red panels (?) (inv. no. 8867). is yellow with a red-purple mane, and the shadows are done in shades of green, darker to indicate volume and depth. The delicate brushstrokes, especially on the feathers, make this fragment stand out and reinforce the impression that most of the other plaster fragments in the Academy collection came from fairly pedestrian locations, painted by not very skilled craftsmen. Among representations of animals and birds (inv. nos. 8868, 8867, 8854, 8869, 8863, and 8870) quadrupeds are the most interesting. Inv. no. 8868 (fig. 5. 3. II)24 preserves a half-crouching leopard biting the neck of a fawn, above a black vertical (?) panel, which is framed on the right side by a narrow band next to a broader cinnabar area; this is decorated with a naturalistic grapevine with parti-colored leaves, which continues above the banded panel. The panel is outlined by a yellow line along the top and delineates the band, which is divided into elongated purple rectangles that alternate with shorter green ones decorated with some sort of yellow pattern. The leopard, colored yellow with short brown stripes and spots, has its forequarters bent down above the black panel, with one hind leg braced on top of the vertical band and the other stretched back to balance on a stem of a grape leaf. Its head, shown frontally, is grasping the neck of the fawn, which has the same coloring and stance, with its hindquarters up and the head (not preserved) down. Behind the tail of the leopard are traces of what may be a large oval purple shield with a small circular boss in its center. The cinnabar color was laid on first and shows through where the purple of the shield has flaked off. Inv. no. 8867 (fig. 5.3.12)25 shows the forequarters of another feline (leopard? - no spots are visible) on a black ground, balanced on a narrow horizontal green olive or laurel garland interspersed with tiny four-petaled flowers, which serves as a division between the black ground behind the feline and a red area below it. The garland is painted illusionistically, with the undersides of the uppermost leaves indicated in yellow and the top surfaces of the lower leaves in green. In Pompeii one of the most common decorative motifs in Third and Fourth Style paintings is the predella, a small rectangular painting located in a variety of balanced positions paired in any or all of the three zones of the overall wall. The majority have black grounds rather than yellow, but they often have motifs of swimming ducks and flowers. The Academy collection has the frag- ment of one predella, inv. no. 8854 (fig.5.3.13),26 set off at the top from a dull red field by a white 24 Dimensions: 0.108 m x 0.08 m.

Fragment of the left side of a yellow predella, preserving the back half of a duck on a plot of grass with purple ińs, set off by a narrow strip of chevrons from a red area above it (inv. no. 8854). Fig. 5.3.14 (near left). Fragment of a vertical floral pattern containing a human figure, next to a realistic flute of a column or framing element (inv. no. 8850). horizontal fillet decorated with narrow red chevrons pointing to the viewers left. The picture, on a yellow ground, was of a swimming duck, but only the tail feathers are preserved, painted in shades of blue-gray. Behind the duck are two red-purple flowers, probably irises, in a clump of thin green leaves growing out of a narrow strip of blue and green water. The dull red was painted first, and the predella was then painted over it, since fragments of the red undercoat and bare plaster show between the flowers and the duck. Among the examples of floral motifs, inv. no. 8850 (fig. 5.3.14)27 shows a vertical frieze on a black or possibly purple ground, next to an illusionistic column or frame done in shades of yellow and buff on the right, and traces of a green field on the left. The design of the frieze consists of a narrow vertical garland of five-petaled flowers with green leaves, interspersed with human figure(s). The one preserved, a nude female, seems to be sprouting from knee-level out of the central red petals of a flower. It is shown in a three-quarter view from the back in shades of buff, brown, and white and holds in its right hand a yellow hat with a broad brim decorated with two long thin yellow ribbons. There are traces of another red flower below the leaves and four green blobs connected to the figure, which presumably represented drapery or more leaves, or even wings. The motif of figures growing out of vegetation occurs as early as the late Second Style in the House of Livia on the Palatine and continues in Pompeii into the Fourth Style. The closest parallels I have found are in the Casa delle Nozze d'Argento (see n. 27), which must have developed from the conceit of reducing a common household object to a fantastic one, often, as here, a candelabrum. Certainly the joining of human, animal, and vegetal forms appealed to the Roman taste for fantasia throughout the first century A.D. and continued beyond that, especially in the mixing of garlands and putti in reliefs in stone, such as sarcophagi and pilasters. Because the Academy fragment has what looks like a realistic architectural element (a column?) alongside the frieze, it may well have come from a Second Style painting. south wall of the tablinum in the Casa di Caecilius Jucundus in Pompeii (V. 1 .26) as depicted in Sikkard's watercolor (Mau 1882, 2:pl. 13, from which the detail in Laidlaw 2001, fig. 14.10 was taken; PPM 1993.3, 593 fig. 32, 596 fig. 40a, 597 figs. 40b-41).

In the same house, there is a somewhat similar frieze between the panels of the main zone in cubiculum x, which is done in the Second Style (illustrated in Beyen 1938-1960, 2.1:figs. 15 and 208). An- other fantastic figured candelabrum, also done in the Second Style, is in the Casa del Criptoportico, on the south wall of the grand oecus (Spinazzola 1953, 1:509 fig. 172; for a detail from the same photo, see Beyen 1938-1960, 2.1:fig. 193).</page><page sequence="177">164 ANNE LAIDLAW Fig. 5.3. 15 (near right). Fragment of a Second Style cornice below the draft of a green rectangle with black shadows ( inv . no. 8852). Fig. 5.3.16 (far right). Fragment of a Third Style geometric pattern on the epistyle of an aedicula (inv. no. 8853). Among the architectural and decorative motifs, inv. no. 8852 (fig. 5.3. 15 )28 clearly represents a Second Style cornice, done in shades of green, yellow, and brown. At the top of the fragment there is the bottom draft of a green panel, bounded by a black line to represent the shadow cast by the now lost illusionistic panel above it. The molding represents a cyma reversa above a half-round decorated with an alternating pattern of cinnabar and purple tongues. Below this the design is less clear: there is a yellow stripe outlined in brown, with tiny dots between each of the tongues above it and a purple area below it. Similar moldings, with or without the tongue pattern, are found in almost all Second Style decorations, forming the basic horizontal divisions between zones. In this example, I would expect that it was part of the painted molding that crowned the main zone below the isodomic drafted panels in the upper part of the wall. Another architectural fragment, inv. no. 8853 (fig. 5. 3. 16), 29 preserves part of a Third Style epistyle of an aedicula, decorated with rectangles alternating with squares colored yellow, purple, and green. This element is separated by horizontal yellow and red bands from a white upper zone that has traces of a rectangular design on the viewer s left. The vertical pattern of double volutes in the form of a reversed S on the yellow square can be exacdy paralleled by those on the epistyle of the central aedicula in triclinium 1 of the Casa di Spurius Mesor (VII.3.29) in Pompeii, which is dated by Mariette de Vos to the early Third Style. The Academy collection also has a typical Third Style vertical frieze (inv. no. 8864; fig. 5.3.17)30 with the forms reduced to geometrical patterns against a red ground. The preserved pattern shows a rigidly simplified lotus on a purple ground, above an inverted white triangle balanced on yellow volutes on a green ground. Beneath the volutes there is a third section with a yellow pattern on a black ground, also based on triangles and volutes, which is reminiscent of a simplified candelabrum. As a final highlight, I have chosen a simple decorative motif that has exact parallels in Pompeii that recur as small details in more than one painting.

Fragment of a Third Style vertical frieze, consisting of stylized lotus above an inverted triangle balanced on volutes (inv. no. 8864). Fig. 5.3.18 (near left). Fragment of a geometrical flower on a yellow candelabrum against a black ground (inv. no. 8858). curvilinear detail of a candelabrum. It was presumably inspired by the shape of a flower or leaf, which the artist has reduced to a standardized geometrical pattern. This detail occurs fairly com- monly in vertical friezes, especially in the Third Style but also in the Fourth. Our example shows a very stylized yellow flower on a black ground and could have come from any part of the original decoration; its date is also indeterminate since the motif is so common, but it should probably be assigned to the first century A.D. In conclusion, I think that the Academy collection of molded and flat painted plaster fragments contains a variety of motifs that can be paralleled in all four conventional Pompeian styles. Although most of the pieces are pedestrian in quality, the collection, especially of the molded friezes, provides an excellent selection of the motifs that were commonly in use during the first centuries B.c. and A.D. As such, these plaster fragments provide a valuable and useful part of our Study Collection. 14.16a.

Wright A marble surface was pier inserted (inv. no. into 9422) the carved peripheral on all wall four of sides the Villa but Aurelia broken by off Mrs. 91 cm Hyland from around its bottom the surface was inserted into the peripheral wall of the Villa Aurelia by Mrs. Hyland around the beginning of the twentieth century, on the east side of the grounds, above the Passeggiata del Gia- nicolo. It was placed near the top of the wall, facing into the gardens but laid on its side, with only the mythological relief showing (fig. 5.4.1). There are no written records of this insertion and none for the provenance of the piece, which was presumably Rome. This thick brick wall had already been finished; about half a meter of its height at the top was broken away and replaced somewhat irregularly after inserting the pier. Because the surface was suffering from acid rain and from the vines growing over it, the relief was removed in 2001 and cleaned in 2002. The main face, about 3 1.5 cm wide, with scenes of the Birth of Venus and the Rape of Europa, was always visible. Upon removal, it was discovered that the relief was one face of a rectangular pier carved on all sides, with F tg J. 4.1. Pier in situ on wall of the Villa Aurelia, seen from below (inv. no. 9422).</page><page sequence="181">168 DAVID H. WRIGHT Fig. 5.4.2. Left and front faces of pier. Fig. 5.4.3. Back and right faces of pier. Fig. 5.4.4. Front face of pier. much of the bottom surface intact. The other faces were carved with elaborate vine and acanthus scroll ornament, and two of them had been reçut, apparently in antiquity, to fit a door jamb or barrier into the pier. The side faces (38 cm wide) are broader than the front (3 1.5 cm). The carving is quite coarse, but both the mythological scenes and the ornament follow good Seveřan models. All the edges were treated the same way (figs. 5.4.2-3). After a smooth band about 2 cm wide, the Lesbian cyma (about 3 cm wide) slopes inward, to establish the plane of relief nearly 1.5 cm lower than the edge. The border panels of the wide sides are curved slightly inward, so that the central panel, set off by a narrow edge, has a plane of relief fully 2 cm below the outer edge. As a result, the edges appear to be protrusions from a smaller rectangular body of the pier. On the front (fig. 5.4.4), the cymas establish a panel 22.5 cm wide, with a plane of relief 1.5 cm below the outside edges. This is cut back a little farther in the center, where the figures are carved in fairly high relief, undercut by as much as 1.8 cm. There is a great deal of running drill work, but the simple drill is used only for the leafage-apron of the Tritons. The edges are considerably battered and the surfaces are badly eroded, now stained gray; there are numerous small holes from vine roots near the lower right and upper right corners. Along the bottom of the panel (fig. 5.4.5), at the left, is a reclining figure of Tellus, partly draped, holding up a cornucopia in her left hand and looking up to the right; her lower body vanishes under what seems to be drapery. At the right, Oceanus is apparendy reclining under this drapery, his torso and left hand revealed, his head turned to look sharply upward. To the left is a dolphin, rising up from lines that must be water but seem involved with the drapery. There is another dolphin in the</page><page sequence="182">DECORATED MARBLE PIER 169 Fig. 5 A .5.

In the waves just above this are two sea monsters - at the left a sea monster with a dragon head, at the right a monster with a feline head and a fish tail. The waves just above them include four more dolphins. Above this scene is one with the birth of Venus. She is seated on the curving tail of a Triton who holds an upright, lit torch with his right hand and seems to have another dolphin wrapped in his tail. Venus is nude, her torso seen frontally, her legs in profile to the right; a bit of drapery covers her left thigh. She raises both arms to the level of her head as she looks into the square mirror she is holding in her left hand and adjusts her hair with her right hand. At the right a second Triton, also seen frontally, looks at the goddess and holds up with his left hand a dish of fruit (?). Each Triton raises his hand closest to Venus to support her velario, the billowing cloth above her head, while behind her at the right is visible something that is apparently a bit of shell (?) as background. At the top of the fragment, above this scene and another band of water, is pictured the Rape of Europa (fig. 5.4.6). The bull is seen in profile to the right, turning his head back to look at Europa, who is seated side-saddle on his rump. His right hind leg is in the water; his right front leg seems to stand on the water, while his left front leg is raised, taking a step. The nude figure of Europa is seen with frontal torso leaning slightly to the right; her legs are in profile, with an impossibly long left leg stretched out to the left and the right leg, on which is a bit of drapery, bent under it. Her left arm reaches around behind the bulls neck, her fingers grasping the back of his head. She raises her right hand above her head to hold one end of the billowing cloth velario ; the other end seems to be held by a small, badly eroded figure at the right. Below the bull in the water are three dolphins, and there is a fourth to the left of his rump. Above this at the left is a putto, apparently standing on dry ground, overlapped by the bulls tail; to the right of him a second putto, apparendy standing</page><page sequence="183">170 DAVID H. WRIGHT Fig. 5.4.7. Left face of pier. Fig. 5.4.8. Right face of pier. on the bull's rump, holds out to the right a dish or similar object. Above this, behind the billowing cloth, we see the head and shoulders of a frontal nude female (?) figure looking to the right, holding a torch (?) with her right hand and a dish with her left. Above this there seems to be more water, before the start of the lost scene above. On the left side (fig. 5.4.7), the neady framed central panel is 12 cm wide, with a plane of relief cut back 2 cm from the original surface and a symmetrical pattern of vine scrolls in simple rounded forms growing out of a vase. In the middle, the ground is cut back deeply (8 mm) and spaced so that there is a vertical slot 11 mm wide between scrolls; this could have received some attachment. The pattern includes schematic tendrils, leaves, four-petal flowers, and bunches of grapes. The panels of acanthus scroll on the sides (7 cm wide) are more naturalistic and are nearly identical, with circular elements of leafage and grapes and with tendrils where the straight stem is visible. Much of the panel at the bottom is lost; it was 9 cm wide, and the scroll was more tighdy curled, with circles of leafage and four-petal flowers. There is a great deal of simple drill work but none by a running drill. The surface is somewhat eroded. The central panel on the right side (fig. 5.4.8) was subsequendy cut away completely, leaving a rough surface and reaching a depth of 42 mm below the original surface of the block; there are traces of the edge of the central panel in one area but nothing of the original decoration. Both side panels are decorated with acanthus leafage scroll in an irregular sine wave scheme, with various animals emerging from the leafage in the circular areas. On the left side, from the bottom up, are shown the forequarters of several animals: an antelope in profile (fig. 5.4.9), a bovine animal with frontal head, a dog chasing a full-length rabbit (which stretches the sine wave, fig. 5.4.10), a feline</page><page sequence="184">DECORATED MARBLE PIER 17 1 Fig. 5.4.9.

The right side is partly broken away, but the sine wave pattern is more regular there; surviving are (from the bottom) a canine beast attacking an antelope, a canine beast attacking a boar from behind, and a bear (?) at- tacking a horse (?). The carving is quite shallow (3 mm), and there are many drill holes but no sign of a running drill. The surface is considerably eroded. The large piece broken off from the bottom left only 58 cm of the decorated area on the back (fig. 5.4.3). On each side there is a panel of simple vine scroll in low relief, 4.5 cm wide, with leaf- age, tendrils, and four-part flowers. Beyond this is a deeply cut cyma with simple squiggle pattern 1.5 cm wide leading to a flat plane 2 cm below the original surface of the block (surviving clearly on the right side). The central panel and much of the inner cyma on the left were subsequently cut away roughly to a depth 2.5 cm below the original surface of the block, leaving traces of what seems to be a symmetrical pattern of scroll elements. In the middle of this, starting 43 cm above the base, a deep rectangular hole 13.5 x 9.5 cm was cut roughly to reach a depth 6.5 cm below the original surface of the block. Although much battered, this side is not much corroded. The surviving figure decoration consists of elements common in later Roman decorative work. They have been put together compactly in a style characteristic of the third and fourth centuries, considerably abbreviated, with figures generally presented frontally and no coherent spatial con- struction. The style of the front panel does not suggest a specific date. The most interesting of the ornamental friezes is on the right side, the inhabited acanthus scroll with various animals. Such friezes go back to Hellenistic times, flourished in Rome, particularly in the Flavian period, and then were revived in the Seveřan period, where they are conveniently seen</page><page sequence="185">172 DAVID H. WRIGHT Fig. 5.4.11. Seveřan pier reused as entablature in S. Lorenzo Fuori le Mura ( photo author). on the Porta Argentariorum (with flowers but no animals).1 There are two large piers of unknown origin with comparable decoration of superb quality, probably of Seveřan date, that were built into the interior architrave of the lower story of S. Lorenzo Fuori le Mura under Pelagius II (579-5 90). 2 They are 2.85 m long and about 60 cm wide on the broad face, roughly twice the size of our pier. Only two sides are visible (fig. 5.4.11), but they show a convincing organic growth of acanthus leafage, the forequarters of animals in high relief emerging from the middle of blossoms, and putti stepping out from blossoms in very high relief. The friezes on our pier come from this tradition but are greatly simplified and clumsily executed. Groups with a large animal attacking its prey imply a deep space and must depend on traditional models comparable to the active putti in the S. Lorenzo pier, but here they are compressed into so shallow a rendering as almost to deny legibility. For comparison, the frieze around the entrance door of the Temple of Jupiter at Split (fig. 5.4.12), part of Diocletian's work of around 300, is more deeply cut and marginally superior in craftsmanship to our pier; but it shows a far greater tendency to bring all elements out to a flat surface, to suppress spatial distinctions between animal and leaf- age, and to deny any living quality in the scroll pattern.3 Therefore it seems to me best to conclude that our pier was carved around the middle of the third century.4 It may be mentioned that a single block of a frieze from the Constantinian apse of the Basilica Nuova has a comparable inhabited acanthus scroll, with a putto holding a shield stepping out of the leafage.5 Figure and vine are treated plastically in high relief and deeply undercut, with much rather coarse drill work; but this is an imperial commission, and the scale of these elements is more than seven times that of our frieze, making a comparison rather inappropriate. This frieze is part of the Constantinian revival of older traditions, but it is noteworthy that here the tendrils are strangely schematized, and the figures, extremely stubby in proportions, are not very convincing in action - a long way from the Seveřan work at S. Lorenzo. It does not suggest a Constantinian date for our pier. There is a hint of continuity in the use of inhabited acanthus scroll in imperial buildings between the Seveřan and Tetrarchie periods in some fragments apparendy from the Sun Temple of Aurelian,6 1 Haynes and Hirst 1939, pls. 6 -7; von Blanckenhagen 1940, fig. 92, with putti and animals, from Seveřan work on the Palatine.

Detail of frieze around entrance to Temple of Jupiter, Split (photo author). but again, these are so much more ambitious in execution, and more deeply undercut, as to make comparison with our pier almost meaningless. A date around the middle of the third century puts our pier in a period when we know hardly any major architectural projects in Rome. Ours was a freestanding architectural pier made of good marble and well designed but carelessly executed, presumably a luxurious private commission, as suggested also by the selection of the two common mythological scenes. It must have been one of a pair (or possibly more pairs) supporting the ceiling of an elaborate entrance or part of some larger ensemble. Subsequendy, the purpose of the hall must have changed, and the central parts of the decoration were cut away on one side and on the back, apparently to fit some sort of frame or thin wall against the pier and to close off the open space around the pier. Such a change again suggests a private house, but I know of no grounds to suggest a specific location or purpose for the pier. Bibliography Ensoli, S., and E. La Rocca, eds., Aurea Koma (Rome 2000).

They have traditionally been treated as separate series because that is the way collections were formed, but, in fact, figurines of humans or divinities were placed in sanctuaries along with the animals that were given to the gods as substitutes or tokens of actual gifts or sacrifices. (A few were placed in graves or domestic settings.) Anatomical ex-votos of terracotta, a specialty of Republican Italy, were offered to the gods at healing sanctuaries, as thank offerings - per grazia ricevuta - or asking the gods to grant the donor a favor.

Umbrian Geometric and Other Bronze Figurines Emeline Hill Richardson Four category Umbrian that Colonna Geometric calls bronze "Schematici figurines Umbro-Meridionali."1 (inv. nos. 1855, 1856, There 392, and are thousands 469) belong of to these the category that Colonna calls "Schematici Umbro-Meridionali."1 There are thousands of these offerings found in votive deposits in Umbria and Marche, with a few strays in ancient Etruria, at Orvieto, and one in Austria, at Vocklabriick.2 Some 60 such figures come from Rome, from a votive stips on the Esquiline.3 The bronzes offer a limited number of types: Hercules swinging his club, warriors brandishing their spears, warriors marching, men walking, ladies wearing pointed caps and lifting their skirts like Greek korai, bare-headed ladies walking, and men and women standing, stiffly frontal, legs straddled, arms swung to the sides: these last must represent worshippers [orantes). All these types are borrowed from the Etruscan repertory of the late Archaic period, the late sixth century and the early fifth B.c. Male figures are nude; warriors can be recognized by a high crest that rises from the top of the head. Women wear a tight dress, that worn by the skirt-lifters covering their ankles, while other ladies wear a short dress that leaves the lower legs bare. The height of these bronzes varies from 0.014 m to 0.14 m; they are cast solid, with details added with a burin or a circular punch. Bodies are flat, narrow, relatively long; arms and legs are stiff, the legs very slender and ending in a point; the head may be long and narrow or solid and faceted so that the nose and chin make a sort of keel, toward which the cheeks slant. Inv. no. 1855 (fig. 6.1.1) and inv. no. 1856 (fig. 6.1.2) are a pair and belong to Colorínas Gruppo Esquilino, whose characteristics are the slashes slanting across the ends of the arms, the faceted modeling of the head, and the frontal position. Although not all of the Gruppo Esquilino was found in Rome,4 it may well be that these two, which are so much alike, really do come from the Esquiline votive deposit. Although Colonna illustrates no Umbrian Geometric figures quite like inv. no. 392 (fig. 6.1.3), similar figures have been found in the Sanctuary of Pasticetto di Magione, in the territory of Perugia.5 The warriors have needle-sharp heads and crests, and the right arm is a flattened rectangle, pierced with a circular hole in which to insert a weapon. In one case, the hole has missed the arm and cut 1 Emeline Hill Richardson completed her contribution to the publication project in 1992.

Probably similar carelessness cut the hole in our figure's arm too near the bottom of the rectangle designed for it, and the poor warrior never held a weapon. Inv. no. 469 (fig. 6.1.4) is an unusual piece. The closest parallels to the figure seem to be several early warriors from Vetulonia and Arezzo,6 but this warrior is far clumsier than they are; the Etruscan warriors stand with straddled legs, and their faces have recognizable features. I have not been able to find any satisfactory parallel for this bronze. The antetypes of inv. no. 8776 (figs. 6.1.5a-b) were evidently small bronzes from Greece or Magna Grecia, designed with Polykleitan proportions in an easy, quiet pose. A bronze found at Delphi might be one of its forerunners, one from Tanagra in Boeotia another.7 The Academy's bronze is stiffer than these, particularly in front and side views, but it has the same physical proportions and a similar quiet pose. The arrangement of the hair, rolled up over a cord, was not common in Greece in the fifth century, but two athletes from Delphi wear their long hair like this, as do a young male figure from Cumae and the curiously elongated ephebe from Selinunte.8 The heavy locks that hang on either side of the face were also uncommon in classical Greece, though a beautiful figure of an athlete pouring a libation, now in South Hadley, Massachusetts, does wear them; so does a young male figure wrapped in a cloak found at Locri in southern Italy.9 The pose, right hand on hip, left arm hanging close to the body, was popular in Etruria in the Classical period; the handsome ephebe from Monte Capra seems to be one of the earliest examples 6 Richardson 1962, 176-177, pls.

Winged male figure, back (inv. no. 8776). of this type.10 A number of bronze figures of discoboli take this pose, in which the left hand grasps the discus and presses it against the left thigh.11 The left hand of the Academy's bronze also presses a circular object against the thigh; it cannot be a discus because it is far too small and apparendy too light. The figure holds it by the upper rim, thumb inside, palm and fingers lying easily on the slightly curved surface. The discoboli grasp the discus on its lower rim, with all four fingers bent to grip and hold its considerable size and weight. The object held by our bronze must be a small libation bowl, held in the same way as the Caryatids of the Erechtheum and their Roman descendants held theirs.12 Inv. no. 8776 is winged. According to the Academy's records, it was bought at the site of Norba in Latium in the spring of 1903 ;13 this could well be the case. The excavations of Mengarelli and Savignoni in 1901 and 1902 are published in detail in the Notizie degli Scavi of 1902 and 1903, and among the recorded finds are not a few extremely handsome small bronzes of the late Classical and early Hellenistic periods. I think they are all of later date than the Academy's figure; little was found on the site that could be dated before the fourth century B.c., but there is material from the temple deposits that dates from the late sixth and fifth centuries B.c. According to Livy, Norba was founded by Rome in 497 b.c. (Livy 2.34.6) and became a Colonia Latina some time after 338 B.c.14 It is not impossible that an early Classical bronze figure was surreptitiously removed from the temple finds and sold to an innocent archaeologist in the old days, before such behavior was frowned on as a crime. If it were a Greek bronze, it might represent Eros, or Pothos, or Himeros. If it is Etruscan, it is not one of these but may well be one of the winged daimones who share with the female Lasas 10 Bologna, Museo Civico Archeologico.

One might suppose that the bronze was made at Praeneste (Palestrina), the Latin city most famous for its bronze work in antiquity. Indeed, the makers of the beautiful Praenestine cistae did include winged figures in their repertory. A youth- ful Eros attends Aphrodite on the engraved frieze of a cista in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome,18 and reliefs on the feet of the Ficoroni Cista show a nude, winged youth between two figures that may be recognized as Hercules and a companion, presumably Iolaos.19 Dohrn calls this figure Eros. Jur- geit, more conservatively, calls him a Flügeldaimon.20 The feet of other cistae carry reliefs of winged youths, and sometimes freestanding winged figures are used as the handles of the cista's lid.21 But their style is not like that of the winged bronze in the Academy; it belongs to an earlier period, and, indeed, the cistae seem not to have been made at Praeneste until early in the fourth century B.c.22 Etruria also produced bronze winged figures, usually the decorations of lamps, but these, too, are later in style than the figure in the Academy. The wings are also treated quite differently; they are big, wide-spread, full of life, and serve as a background and a frame for the figure itself.23 In short, the bronze from Norba is a puzzle. In style, proportions, modeling, and pose it be- longs to the second half of the fifth century; its antetypes are Greek, perhaps western Greek. The arrangement of the hair is a rather clumsy version of the hair of the young man from Locri.24 Our bronze has no counterpart that I can find, nor have I found any winged figure whose wings are at- tached like these. I think the bronze is decorative, not votive, perhaps the finial of a candelabrum, like the Etruscan discoboli that take the same pose. Inv. no. 1851 (fig. 6.1.6) is a modest example of a common Hellenistic type, called variously a priest, a Lar, or a Genius.

Togate male figure (inv. no. 1851). Fig. 6.1.7. Dancing Lar (inv. no. 1292). the last being, evidently, cheap exports from Etruria. Two of these figures were found in a house of the Hellenistic period in Vetulonia;28 this may have led to their identification as Lares. Their pres- ence in a house of the "Etrusco-Roman" period would then be evidence for an early lararial cult in private houses, though otherwise the only lararial figures we know are Roman of the Imperial period. The same applies to figures of the Genius; the wreath of vine leaves gives them the look of Dionysus, and the Roman Genius, like the Greek Agathos Daimon, was sometimes identified with that god or with his Roman equivalent, Liber Pater.29 But under the Empire the Genius is shown as a Roman gendeman, togate, capite velato , pouring a libation. Under the Empire, Lar and Genius are house gods; such figurines were not found in sanctuaries, while the bronzes of this type, crowned with vine leaves, and their female companions are found only in sanctuaries, with the unexplained exception of the two from Vetulonia. Inv. no. 1292 (fig. 6.1.7), on the other hand, is a Lar of the Roman Imperial period. It is a clumsy example of the dancing Lares who appeared as a standard type in Roman sculpture during the reign of Augustus. They were part of the furnishing of the house shrine, the lararium, usually two in number, either bronze figurines placed in the niche or aedicule that housed the shrine or images painted on its walls. Probably the best-known lararial painting is that in the House of the Vettii at Pompeii.30 Two dancing youths flank the figure of a man wearing a toga praetexta , a fold of which is drawn over his head; he holds instruments for sacrificing in each hand, a patera in the right, an acerra in the left. He is the Genius, the guardian spirit of the household. The figures on either side, the Lares, are wreathed and wear short, loose, belted tunics whose skirts flare out as they 28 Florence, Museo Archeologico nos. 9424, 9435.

Each one lifts a rhyton in one hand and carries a little situla with the other. In another house in Pompeii, the Casa delle Pareti Rosse,31 the Lares and the Genius are painted on the back wall of the aedicule, and in front of them stand the bronze images of the household gods, two dancing Lares with flaring skirts, wreathed, carrying rhyton and patera, along with a Mercury redesigned as the young Aesculapius, another Mercury, Apollo, and Hercules. Lares come in different sizes, and their quality varies from one example to the next.32 The type remains almost unchanged, however: young men with rather long, curly hair, wearing a short, full tunic belted at the waist, sometimes a scarf over the left shoulder, sometimes a short cloak, boots or sandals on their feet, holding a rhyton in one hand and a patera or some other vessel in the other. A fine example in Cleveland33 wears a long scarf tucked into the twisted sash that belts his tunic and high boots with thick soles, with the toes left uncovered. This is a standing rather than a dancing Lar, with both arms lowered and the forearms, cast separately, now missing. One in Providence34 wears an elaborate wreath fastened behind with floating ribbons, the usual tunic and sash, and sandals. This is another standing Lar, his right arm raised to hold a lost rhyton, his left stretched out, thumb opposed, to hold a patera. The Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York has three undistinguished dancing Lares.35 The first wears a scarf over the right shoulder and left forearm as he lifts up a rhyton in the right hand and holds a patera in the left. The other two have lost their attributes. The figure of Osiris, inv. no. 1254 (figs. 6.1.8a-b), is depicted according to an old formula. A painting in the tomb of the architect Sennedjem (Dynasty XIX, ca. 1250 B.c.) at Deir el Medina shows the god standing, head and legs in profile, torso frontal, according to the Egyptian tradition. He wears the crown with ostrich plumes, the false beard, the mummy wrappings with the addition of a splendid collar, and he holds crook and flail in his hands, which meet on his breast.36 His flesh is painted green because, like many Underworld deities, he is also a god of vegetation and of the renewal of life. The many small bronze images of Osiris are considerably later in type, dating to the Third Intermediate Period (1070-656 B.c.) through the Ptolemaic (33 1-3 1 B.c.) and presumably into the Roman period.37 A figure in the Brooklyn Museum, of the Third Intermediate Period,38 unfortunately lacking its head, stands like the Academy's bronze, his wrists crossed on his breast. He wears the costume of the Osiris-Mummy bronzes, with a handsome collar like the Osiris in Sennedjems tomb; delicate patterns inlaid with gold are incised on his garments. Another Osiris of the same type and period is shown in high relief on the skirt of the priest Chonsu-meh in Berlin.39 31 Boyce 1937, 77, no. 371, pl. 21,1 and 2.

Votive Terracottas from Greece, Magna Grecia, and Beyond Rebecca Miller Ammerman It Academy is in no way in Rome surprising come that from most southern of the Etruria terracotta and figurines Latium.1 in What the collections is less expected of the is American the wide Academy in Rome come from southern Etruria and Latium.1 What is less expected is the wide range of provenances for the figurines that did not come from centers near Rome. The coroplastic production of the Greek city-states of Magna Grecia, for instance, is well represented by numerous figurines from Taranto in Puglia and Selinus in Sicily. There are terracottas also from Italic sites in Campania and a Punic nuraghe in Sardinia. Moreover, the collection includes a wide variety of terracottas from even beyond the Italian peninsula and its neighboring islands: prehistoric figurines from Mycenae, Archaic Greek figurines from Argos and Boeotia, and Roman figurines from Egypt and France have all followed roads that led to the American Academy in Rome.2 In order to understand better the eclectic nature of the Academy's collection of terracottas, a few words about how the statuettes and reliefs of clay were acquired are useful. The figurines were all do- nated by individuals who often had a long association with the American Academy. The first donation was made in 1898 and 1899 by Dr. Edmonston Charles, an English physician whose keen interest in archaeology was channeled into active participation in the British and American Archaeological As- sociations.3 Although most of his donation consists of objects from Viterbo and Orvieto, six figurines from his private collection are included in this section.4 Charles's gift includes figurines from Greek Taranto, Italic Campania, Roman Gaul, and probably Egypt and thus offers a suitable prologue for the variety observed among the terracottas at the Academy that do not come from sites near Rome. Two of the collection's oldest objects - fragments of Mycenaean figurines - were given by A. W. Van Buren when he was a Fellow of the School of Classical Studies in Rome, upon his return from a trip to Greece in 1905.5 Richard Norton, Director of the School of Classical Studies froml899 to 1907, also donated a number of figurines collected during his travels to classical sites throughout the Mediterranean. The figurines given by Norton are included in the first catalogue of the collection that Austin M. Harmon compiled as a Fellow in 1907.

Another frag- mentary figurine7 comes from Egypt, where Norton had likewise assisted Hogarth in his excavations at Asyût. In 1907 he also visited Naukratis.8 In Italy, Norton acquired two terracotta reliefs and a figurine whose provenance is given as Taranto.9 In 1924, the British archaeologist Thomas Ashby donated many objects from his private col- lection to the Academy. As was the case with Norton, the terracotta figurines reflect the routes of Ashby's Mediterranean travel. Two figurines, one marked "Mycenae 1898"10 and the other "Heraion 1898, "n must have been collected on a visit in that year to archaeological sites in the Greek Argolid. Ashby again penciled on a thymiaterion in the shape of a female head its findspot, "Nuragha Lugherras."12 Taramellis excavations at the Sardinian site in 1906 recovered hundreds of identical thymiateriaP Finally, Ashby also noted the findspot for three other figurines14 as the Temple of Demeter Malaphoros at Selinus in southern Sicily. Excavations conducted intermittently at the sanctuary from 1888 to 1925 unearthed similar figurines.15 Three other figurines in Ashby s gift regrettably lack such specific information about their provenance.16 Esther B. Van Deman, Ashby s friend and frequent walking companion in the Roman Cam- pagna, also left several terracotta figurines to the American Academy in 1937. The Italian provenance for all the figurines reflects the somewhat more circumscribed travels of this remarkable female pioneer of Roman archaeology.17 Information about provenance is given for only a small terracotta protome.18 A faded note in pencil on the back of the figurine indicates that the piece was acquired at Agrigento in Sicily. A dealer s stamp marks another Sicilian terracotta,19 suggesting that Van De- man may have purchased her figurines from local dealers. In addition to these two Sicilian pieces, her gift includes a reclining banqueter from Taranto20 and several other terracottas that find their closest parallels among the coroplastic products of central Italy.21 In 1959, Elizabeth Douglas Van Buren gave to the Academy a group of classical antiquities that included several terracotta figurines. The catalogue indicates that a Boeotian horse and rider figurine was purchased around 1925 in Athens.22 Mrs. Van Buren also bought figurines from dealers in Italy.23 The catalogue of the collection tells us explicidy that one figurine (inv. no. 8763a), a well-preserved 7 Inv. no. 490.

A. Richter:26 the small, worn head of a banqueter from Taranto was found by Emeline Richardson in 1989 in the Roman apartment that Richter bequeathed to the Academy. The source is unknown for a dozen figurines now listed in the database. Three (which were included in Harmon's catalogue) must have come into the collection before 1907 and may thus have belonged to Norton.27 Two more were catalogued along with Van Deman's bequest in 1937 and may have been part of her gift.28 Three masks from New Comedy29 seem to have entered the catalogue at some time between 1937 and 1959, while four figurines30 have not been recorded in the catalogue of the collection. As is the case with most terracottas assembled by random donation in a museum collection, the exact archaeological context of the figurines is lost. Moreover, the provenance given in the cata- logue of the Academy's collection may often record the place of purchase rather than the findspot. Ashby, nevertheless, did note (usually in pencil directly on the terracotta itself) that several of his figurines came from either the sanctuary of Hera at Argos or of Demeter Malophoros at Selinus. It is reasonable to assume that these and most of the other terracottas in the collection served as ritual offerings - either as a votive dedication at a sanctuary or as a gift in a grave.31 This assumption is based upon what we know about the use of terracottas closely comparable to those in the Academy's collection. The small Archaic figurines of seated females from Argos, the reclining banqueters from Taranto, the small protome from Sicily, and the relief plaque pierced for suspension from Taranto, for instance, all find parallels - numbering often in the hundreds and even thousands - that were recovered by archaeologists as votive offerings at sanctuary sites. In the Hellenistic period, the rite of dedicating a figurine in a sanctuary continued at both Greek and Italic centers. From the fourth century B.c. onward, it became increasingly common, however, to include terracotta figurines and theatrical masks as offerings in graves.32 Three fragmentary figurines of Mycenaean Greece, dating to the fourteenth and thirteenth centuries B.c., may take pride of place as the oldest objects in the Academy collection. All belong to a type of figurine named after letters of the Greek alphabet due to the resemblance of their con- tours to the letters &lt;p, &lt;]*, or x. The small, hand-modeled figurines are thought to represent a female deity and have been found widely in domestic, funerary, and votive contexts.33 A. W. Van Buren brought two of the figurines, inv. nos. 75 and 76 (fig. 6.2.1), to Rome from his travels in Greece in 24 Inv. no. 8763a. In addition, inv. no. 8766 has "Pompeii" written on its back; the note may indicate its place of pur- chase. 25 Inv. nos. 8765, 8764. 26 Inv. no. 9520. 27 Inv. nos. 3505, 96, 101. In 1907, Harmon noted in the introduction to his catalogue that the gifts of Charles and Norton accounted for most of the objects in the collection and that the figurines belonging to Charles, which came into the collection in 1898 or 1899, are all marked with a "C" in heavy black paint. Such a mark is not found on these three figurines. It is therefore likely that they belonged to Norton. 28 Inv. nos. 2112, 2107. 29 Inv. nos. 3505, 3501,3502. 30 Inv. nos. 8885, 8884, 8886, 8907. 31 For general discussion of ritual use of terracottas, see Am- merman 1990, 42^4.

Mycenaean figurines: lower fragment, braid of hair falls down back of figure; upper fragment, left profile of head wearing polos (inv. nos. 75 and 76). Fig. 6.2.2 (far right). Daedalic relief plaque of sphinx from Crete (inv. no. 8985). 1905. The other figurine, inv. no. 8146, bears on its base a note in pencil, "Mycenae 1898," which probably marks the place and date of its acquisition by Thomas Ashby.34 The sphinx portrayed in relief on a small plaque, inv. no. 8985 (fig. 6.2.2), from seventh-century B.c. Crete, offers a fitting introduction to the Greek terracottas in the Academy's collection. The im- age of the mythical oriental beast was cast from a mold - a technique that Syro-Phoenician craftsmen conveyed to the Greek world at some time in the eighth century B.c. The use of molds transformed the craft of the coroplast, leading to the mass production of reliefs and figurines and the faithful transmission of imagery from one workshop to another by means of molds and casts.35 The possibili- ties of such a manufacturing technique were most fully realized in the Hellenistic period, with an intense production throughout the Mediterranean basin of graceful figurines in the Tanagra style. The sphinx, a fantastic winged creature who came to play an important role in Greek art and myth, was itself another cultural inheritance that Greece owed the Near East. The island of Crete, where the plaque was made, was an important setting for the early exchange of ideas between Greece and her more advanced neighbors to the east. Thus, the small molded sphinx, with its engaging fully frontal gaze, looks forward not only to rich and varied developments in Greek figurai art (many of which were inspired by contact with the Near East) but also to centuries of prolific production of molded terracottas. Counterpoint is provided in turn by hand-modeled Archaic figurines from Argos (inv. nos. 484, 485, 486, 8145; fig. 6.2.3) and Boeotia (inv. no. 8770; fig. 6.2.4). The tactile attraction of working in clay enticed the coroplast to continue fashioning figurines by hand long after mold-made pro- duction of terracottas had become the norm. While, as in inv. no. 484, the essential human form 34 According to the catalogue of the collection, the piece was part of a group of objects stored in two cases marked "Van Deman." Labels of the objects indicated, however, that some were the property of Van Deman and others of Ashby. Since Van Deman came to Europe for the first time in 1901, it is unlikely that the piece belonged to her. It is reasonable to assume that the terracotta was instead the property of Ashby, who penciled, in a like manner and script, findspots on several of his figurines. 35 For transmission of imagery by means of shared mold technology, see Miller 1985.</page><page sequence="201">VOTIVE TERRACOTTAS FROM GREECE, MAGNA GRECIA, AND BEYOND 189 Fig. 6.2.3.

Boeotian figurine of horse and rider, right profile (inv. no. 8770). may be summarily drawn out of a small lump of clay, echoing faintly the Bronze Age tradition of Mycenaean figurines (inv. nos. 8146, 75-76; fig. 6.2.1), more elaborate work tends to be preferred. Slabs, coils, and balls of clay are assembled, for instance, to create a decorative figurine portraying a seated female wearing headbands, earrings, shoulder fibulae, and multiple chains, called hormoi , across her chest (inv. nos. 485, 486, 8145; fig. 6.2.3). Or, as in inv. no. 8770 (fig. 6.2.4), a male figure sits smartly astride a gaily striped horse. The hand-modeled figurines underscore yet another important aspect of Greek terracottas - their sacred nature. The majority of figurines, especially in the Archaic and Classical periods, were placed in sanctuaries as offerings to deities or in graves as gifts to the dead. The findspot of one of the figurines representing a hieratically seated woman, inv. no. 8145, is specifically noted as the Heraion at Argos.36 The other three figurines from Argos were apparendy found at the Sanctuary of Hera between 1893 and 1894. These, too, served no doubt as gifts to the Argive goddess. Moreover, the hieratic pose and ornate character of the figurines suggest that they may have been fashioned in imitation of an Archaic cult image, a subject common among votive terracottas in the Greek world.37 The hand-modeled horsemen of Boeotia, on the other hand, were often placed in burials.38 Devotion to a divinity does not seem to have been the motivation here. Rather, commemoration of a mortal, stressing by means of equestrian imagery his elevated social status, is perhaps what may have been intended by the use of such a terracotta in an individuals final rite of passage. The last figurine included in this section, inv. no. 8767, represents an enthroned female, wearing a tall conical polos, who is usually identified as a goddess. The figurine, which dates to the late sixth century B.c., is hollow, cast from both a front and a back mold. Large numbers of these figurines 36 As was the case with inv. no. 8146, this figurine was part of a group of objects stored in two boxes marked as belong- ing to Van Deman. But again, the penciled note "Heraion 1898," indicating the date and findspot, show that the figurine belonged to Ashby. See above n. 34. 37 On the question of the influence of cult images upon figurines, see Alroth 1989, 15-64. 38 For similar examples from graves, see Ure 1934, 61-66.</page><page sequence="202">190 REBECCA MILLER AMMERMAN Fig. 6.2.5 ( near righi). Figurine of seated female from Sanctuary of Demeter Malophoros at Selinus, Sicily (inv. no. 1337). Fig. 6.2.6 (far right). Tarantine figurine of reclining male banqueter and seated female (inv. no. 8984). and closely related plastic vases, which probably held perfumed oil, were exported widely from the Greek East to sites throughout the Mediterranean.39 Not only have such figurines been found at almost every major Greek city-state in southern Italy and Sicily, but also production of the figurines was often taken up by local coroplasts in the West who used the imported casts as prototypes for their own molds. The word "Napoli" is written in pencil on the back of the figurine in the Acad- emy's collection, suggesting that the terracotta may have been recovered at a site in Magna Grecia. It has nevertheless been included with the group of figurines from Greece because its fine-grained, micaceous fabric is consistent with that of Miletos, which clay analysis has shown to be the most likely production center for these figurines and plastic vases.40 Most of the terracottas in the Academy's collection with a secure provenance in Magna Grecia come from Selinus or Taranto. Excavations at both sites produced thousands of terracottas from large votive deposits. Gàbrici, for instance, excavating at the Sanctuary of Demeter Malophoros at Selinus in the early decades of this century, recovered some 12,000 figurines.41 Excavations con- ducted at Taranto in the late nineteenth and first half of the twentieth century yielded even more astonishing quantities of votive terracottas.42 Of the five figurines from Selinus (inv. nos. 1337-1339, 8739, 2146), three were acquired by Ashby at the Sanctuary of Demeter Malophoros, inv. nos. 1337 (fig. 6.2.5), 1338, 1339. The molded, late Archaic figurines continue the tradition seen in the somewhat older, hand-modeled figurines from Argos (inv. nos. 484-486, 8145), in which a hieratically seated goddess wearing a polos and elaborate hormoi is represented (inv. nos. 12, 13, 15). Another portrays a standing woman who probably held a shallow basin on her head (inv. no. 1339). 39 For a general introduction to this group of East Greek figurines and plastic vases, see Higgins 1967, 30-37. 40 Jones 1986, 672-673. 41 Higgins 1954, 336.

Head of Tarantine figurine of reclining male banqueter (inv. no. 8986). Eleven terracottas (inv. nos. 487^88, 8765, 489, 8763a-8764, 92, 8884, 8886, 9520, 2126) are best ascribed to Taranto. Seven of these (inv. nos. 8763a-8764, 92, 8884, 8886, 9520, 2126) por- tray a reclining male banqueter, sometimes accompanied by a woman at the end of his kline (fig. 6.2.6). The banqueter, by far the most common type of Tarantine terracotta, enjoyed a long history of production, beginning at the end of the sixth and running into the later fourth century B.c.43 The terracottas in the Academy's collection reflect stylistic changes that the Tarantine banqueters underwent. Rather stiff late Archaic figures with schematic features (inv. nos. 8763a-8764) develop into more sensitive renderings of Classical date (inv. no. 8986; fig. 6.2.7), which in turn give way to wearied visages (inv. no. 9520) expressing the tedium that repetitive mass-production had brought to the figurines by the mid-fourth century B.c. Interpretations of the significance of the Tarantine banqueters over the past century have tended to place the figurines in a funerary sphere. Some scholars identify the banqueter as Dionysus-Hades, while others see him as a deceased mortal heroized in a cult of the dead. Orphic and Pythagorean beliefs have also been brought to bear. Iacobone, surveying (1) the distribution of the varied ico- nographies of terracottas recovered in nineteen votive deposits at Taranto and (2) the topographic distribution of the votive deposits themselves, brings a welcome corrective to previous interpreta- tions of the banqueter figurines.44 She points to the absence of evidence for chthonic or funerary associations and instead stresses the connotations of rite and of elevated social status that the image of a banqueter, engaged in the communal meal following a sacrifice, holds. Such a figurine thus reinforces the relationship with the divine realm, which the dedicator of the terracotta sought to enhance by means of a self-referential gift. Taranto is given as the provenance for two sixth-century B.c. figurines (inv. nos. 8765, 489) portraying a female deity wearing a high, flaring polos. The molded head and torso were attached to either a cone of clay thrown on a potter's wheel representing the skirt of a standing figure or to a slab of clay folded in an inverted "U" to form the skirt and back of a throne of a seated figure. Figurines belonging to the same mold series (families of mechanically related molds and casts) 43 See, on the development of the figurines, Iacobone 1988, 50-51.

Thymiaterion in shape of female head from Nuraghe Lugherras in Sardinia (inv. no. 3481). used to make the Academy's terracottas are distributed widely throughout the Achaean colonies of Magna Grecia. Metaponto has yielded the largest number, but the figurines occur at many other sites, including Taranto, Sybaris, Heraclea, Croton, and Paestum.45 Two reliefs given to the Academy by Norton also list Taranto as their provenance. The Archaic votive relief of a chariot group (inv. no. 487), like the figurines of a goddess with the flaring polos discussed above, finds related terracottas at Satyrion near Taranto and at Achaean sites along the Gulf of Taranto.46 The other relief, depicting a male head in profile, inv. no. 488, presents a more complex situation. The piece calls to mind the charming Melian reliefs (whose production on the Aegean island of Melos has been recently questioned)47 that on at least one occasion made their way to a site in southern Italy.48 The Academy's relief finds, however, no exact parallel among the Melian reliefs. Moreover, the technique used to finish its back differs significandy from that used in manufacturing the Greek plaques.49 A series of small reliefs from Campania50 may provide better comparanda for the relief in the Academy's collection. Finally, a small protome, inv. no. 2134, also illustrates the circulation of terracottas between city-states in Magna Grecia. Agrigento is the provenance given for the protome; it shows, however, a closer stylistic affinity to protomai made at Himera than those made at Agrigento. It may be that the piece was imported to Agrigento from Himera, as has also been suggested for a similar "Himeran- style" protome found at Gela.51 45 See Ammerman 1991, 207 n. 16 for extensive list of figu- rines, 213, figs. 4, 13, 14. 46 For votive plaques from Satyrion that may belong to the same mold series, see Lippolis 1994, 533, pl. 28, 2-3.

The standing female figure sporting a tall, flaring polos (inv. no. 77; fig. 6.2.8) is clearly in- spired in its subject matter and costume by votive figurines of the Western Greeks, such as inv. nos. 8765, 489. The abstract form of its hand-modeled body belongs instead to Italic stylistic tradition. Of even greater interest is the evidence that the figurine furnishes for communication, including the circulation of mold series, between Italic workshops in Campania. Excavations at Teano and Cales recovered similar votive figurines with flaring poloi and hand-modeled bodies of simple contour.52 The molded face on the Academy's figurine finds its twin, however, on a small votive head from Capua.53 In other words, craftsmen producing figurines for these Italic centers shared not only ideas concerning the general style and format of figurines but also the mold technology employed in manufacturing many of the figurines. The miniature votive head, inv. no. 2123, stems directly from the Etrusco-Italie practice of dedicating models of heads and other body parts (legs, hands, genitalia, and so on) at sanctuaries whose patrons were endowed with healing powers.54 The elongated face with a square jaw, heavily rimmed eyes, and a fillet running across the forehead owe much, however, to Greek sculpture of the Severe Style - albeit in profile the head illustrates just how awkwardly these features have been fashioned by the Italic craftsman. The terracotta is related to small votive heads often found at Samnite sites in central Italy but also documented as far north as Veii. Ashby, as was his custom, noted the specific provenance of the thymiaterion in the shape of a female head (inv. no. 3481; fig. 6.2.9) direcdy on the terracotta itself. The piece comes from Nuraghe Lugherras near Oristano in Sardinia, where in 1906 Taramelli conducted excavations that yielded hundreds of identical thymiateriaP Incense burners in the shape of a female head wearing an elaborate kalathos are common at Punic sites throughout the western Mediterranean. The type is thought to have been created in the later fourth century B.c. by a Punic workshop at Selinus, thus accounting for the clearly visible influence of Western Greek style on the terracottas.56 A provenance cannot be securely specified for eighteen terracottas due to an insufficiency of information about the acquisition of the pieces and a lack of exact parallels. The terracottas, which range in date from the Archaic to late Hellenistic periods, all reflect in their varied styles the influ- ence of Greek sculpture. Although several pieces may come from mainland Greece, most show closer affinity to the coroplastic products of Magna Grecia. The terracottas have been divided ac- cording to general format: protome, figurine, or comic mask. The figurines are further subdivided into female and male figures and arranged chronologically within each group. The large statuette of a female figure, inv. no. 2112 (fig. 6.2.10), which dates to the second quarter of the sixth century b.c., presents an interesting combination of coroplastic techniques. The face and snail-shell curls framing the forehead are cast from a mold, while the rest of the fig- ure is fashioned by hand as a solid statuette. Longer tresses of hair are formed by beaded ribbons of applied clay or by extensive use of incision. The style of the face and the unusual rendering of the poncho-like garment ally the statuette closely with the coroplastic production of Metaponto and other Greek city-states on the Gulf of Taranto. The raised right arm may have brandished a spear. If this were the case, the statuette would have presented an imposing image of a goddess 52Johannowsky 1963, 144, 146, figs. 9f, lle-i; Johannowsky 1961, 264, fig. 12. 53 Bonghi Jovino 1965, 75, pl. 32.3. 54 On the phenomenon, see Fenelli 1975; Cornelia 1981.

The smaller female figurine may have also been purchased there. As the Taran- tine banqueter illustrates, the salesroom offered antiquities from sites other than Pompeii. Given the absence of an exact parallel from Pompeii or elsewhere for the female figurine, it is advisable to attribute the terracotta to the area of Magna Grecia in general. Another figurine, inv. no. 78, portraying a woman with arms raised in an orans position, often in- terpreted as a gesture of mourning, should also be attributed to a site in southern Italy. The figurine has something in common with terracottas decorating large polychrome vases that were placed as funerary gifts in tombs of Hellenistic date at Canosa in Puglia.58 Similar figurines with raised and exaggeratedly large arms that did not serve as plastic decoration for vases have also been found at Egnazia59 and Lipari.60 None of these figurines is, however, as ungainly and rudely fashioned as the Academy's piece. Although probably also of Hellenistic date, two small female figurines (inv. nos. 2131 and 2147) stand, like the orant figurine, outside the more common tradition of Tanagra-style draped women. The terracottas are most akin to figurines found in votive deposits in central Italy and Campania, whose harshly delineated drapery echoes late Classical arrangements.61 57 On hoplosmia figures, with bibliography, see Ammerman 1991,229-230, fig. 23. 58 Oliver 1968, 16,25, pl. 11.1-3; Higgins 1967, 127, pl. 60C. 59 Levi 1926, 82, fig. 69, no. 341. 60 Bernabò Brea and Cavalier 1965, 317-318, pl. 203.1-2. 61 For closely related figurines from the Salamanca Collection</page><page sequence="207">VOTIVE TERRACOTTAS FROM GREECE, MAGNA GRECIA, AND BEYOND 195 Most of the terracottas portraying male figures are likewise of Hellenistic date. They belong to a common scheme of a figure leaning languidly against a pillar or herm (inv. nos. 2129, 94, 8907). An increased frequency of contact among different parts of the Hellenistic world led to more rapid and widespread exchange of coroplastic products and technology.62 As a result, similar figurines representing Eros or Papposilenos leaning against a support are widely distributed throughout Italy from Gravisca to Taranto63 to Lipari, though regrettably none provides an exact parallel for any of the Academy's terracottas. The playful group of Papposilenos carrying Eros on his back (inv. no. 99) is, on the other hand, rather unusual. Hellenistic coroplasts delighted in representing the piggyback game of ephedrismos. Usually one woman carries another, but examples are also known of a woman carrying Eros, or of Pap- posilenos carrying a woman. I know of only one other terracotta portraying Papposilenos with Eros on his back.64 The unusual iconography is, however, attested in South Italian vase painting and glyptic art.65 Three masks of characters from New Comedy (inv. nos. 3505, 3501-3502) and a mask of a satyr or grotesque (inv. no. 4813) speak to another widespread phenomenon observed among coroplastic products of the Hellenistic period - the popularity of images drawn from the theater and the world of Dionysos.66 Figurines and masks portraying characters of Attic Comedy occur in domestic set- tings but also often abound as offerings in sanctuaries and graves.67 The miniature masks in the Academy's collection (inv. nos. 3501-3502, 4813) may have served as pendants or plastic decoration for vases. In 1907, Richard Norton visited Egypt. Upon his return to Italy, he gave the Academy a small, rudely fashioned terracotta from Naukratis that portrays a naked figure with a large phallus playing a tambourine (inv. no. 490). In Roman Egypt, such phallic figurines were common and valued probably for their apotropaic power. Two figurines, inv. nos. 96 (figs. 6.2. 1 1-12) and 95, which had been given to the Academy by the time Harmon compiled his catalogue of the collection in 1907, are probably from Egypt as well. They share the same coarse, heavy, dark red fabric made from Nile mud as the grotesque from Naukratis. The clumsy fashioning of the figurines, whose subjects, general format, and style are inspired by Greco-Roman art, also speaks for Egyptian craftsmanship. Moreover, specific techniques used in their manufacture likewise point to Egypt.68 The walls of the casts are so thick that the figurines are almost solid. The lug pierced with a hole for suspension on the back of the Eros figurine, inv. no. 96 (fig. 6.2.12), is particularly distinctive. Normally, a small hole or vent cut direcdy in the back of the figurine was used to hang a flying Eros - a popular subject among Hellenistic workshops.

Hecht, a Fellow of the American Academy in Rome in 1949, attributed the figurine of a bearded man lean- ing against a herm (here inv. no. 94) to Taranto. The figurine was given to the Academy by Dr. Charles at the end of the nineteenth century. I see no reason, based on what is known of Tarantine terracottas, for a specific attribution to this site. 64 Winter 1903, 400.6 illustrates a figurine of a small Eros riding astride the shoulders of Papposilenos but not with one crooked leg cradled in the arms of the aged Silenos - the usual position for the game of ephedrismos. The charming nature of the game made it a popular subject among forgers of terracotta figurines. 65 For vase painting, see Hermary 1986, 914, no. 762c, 922, no. 858, s.v.

The whimsical figurine of a pudgy youth riding on the back of an eagle, inv. no. 100 (fig. 6.2.13), is best ascribed to a Gallo-Roman workshop of the first or second century A.D. There is no exact parallel iconographically for this mirthful rendition of Ganymede's plight.70 The quality of the fine white clay fabric and such technical details as the hatching of the eagles feathers indicate, however, that the figurine owes its inspiration to Transalpine wit. 69 Schürmann 1989, 280, pl. 176, no. 1061. 70 Two Roman mosaics and a terracotta lamp illustrating Ganymede riding the eagle are quite different in their con- ception and portrayal; Sichtermann 1988, 166, nos. 257-259, s.v.

Etrusco-Italie Votive Terracottas Helen Nagy The to the Italic American votive terracotta Academy heads in Rome and by figurines several form collectors, a somewhat over a eclectic number group.1 of years. They The were principal given to the American Academy in Rome by several collectors, over a number of years. The principal donors were Richard Norton, whose gift was made early this century; Thomas Ashby, who in 1924 bequeathed a large collection of objects acquired mostly in the first decade of this century; and Dr. Edmonston Charles, whose gift was received in 1899. Esther B. Van Deman's bequest of her sig- nificant collection came to the Academy upon her death in 1937, Mrs. E. Douglas Van Buren 's gift of numerous objects was received in 1959, and a few pieces were given by Gisela Richter in 1973. 2 Some of these collections form cohesive groups; for instance, among the objects donated by Dr. Charles are five Italic votive terracottas representing Etrusco-Latian types. A number of the Ashby pieces come from the Ponte di Nona and form a distinct group. Unfortunately many of the better-preserved objects have no known provenance and were probably purchased locally. This is the case of most of the finely preserved "Tanagra" types. Large Heads Heads and busts comprise a popular group among the votive types in Italic deposits. The meaning and function of this category is debated.3 The heads differ among themselves as to the degree of individualization. While some are strikingly portrait-like, others are clearly mass-produced from a single mold. Votive heads should not be interpreted as portraits in the modern sense, although at times they are customized to express certain individual traits.4 The examples in the collection of the American Academy in Rome represent types that are characteristic for the region around Rome and have parallels at sites in Latium and Etruria. Inv. nos. 102, 2103, 103, 104, and 105 (figs. 6.3.1-3) represent types common in Etruria and Latium. All derive ultimately from South Italian prototypes. Inv. no. 102 (fig. 6.3.1), for instance, has counterparts from Agrigento, Taranto, and Capua, with the latter providing the closest paral- lels.5 These prototypes are based on fourth-century B.c. Greek antecedents, such as some of the works of Lysippos,6 and they occur in a great number of variations in central Italy. Similar heads 1 Inv. nos. 2103, 102, 103, 104, 86, 87, 89, 91, 8772, and 8773 are discussed in Nagy 2005. 2 For collectors, see Geffcken, in this volume, pp. 21-66. 3 Studies of votive heads include Hafner 1965; 1966-1967; Pensabene 1979; and Riis 1981. 4 Kilmer 1977, 283, figs. 177-180. 5 Agrigento: Kilmer 1977, 101-104, figs. 58-61; Taranto: Schneider-Hermann 1949-1951, 14; Capua: Bonghi Jovino 1965, 45-47, no.

Fig. 6.3.2. Female head (inv. no. 2103). Fig. 6.3.3. Male head (inv. no. 104). come from the area of Cerveteri, where the general type is especially popular in a range of sizes and variations.7 Although the origins for the type of inv. no. 2103 (fig. 6.3.2) have also been traced to Taranto,8 its heavy frontality and the linear emphasis of the eyes, mouth, chin, and hair curls reflect the Italic predilection for line rather than modeling. The type occurs at a significant number of sites in numerous examples, with rich variations that include an assortment of earring types and dif- ferent treatments of the framing curls.9 The earliest examples of the group are generally dated to the first half of the fourth century B.c. In these, the face is framed by regularly disposed elongated curls.10 Our variation, with rows of tight round curls, is most commonly found in Rome, at Veii, and Lavinium, and survives into the second century B.c. Only a cosdy chemical analysis could yield definitive results, but the color and type of clay suggest the Veii region as the origin of the piece. Inv. nos. 103, 104 (fig. 6.3.3), and 105 are examples of a type well represented in central Italy and that enjoyed long popularity in Etruria, Latium, and Campania. It was probably introduced to Etruria from Campania, where it occurs earlier in vessel form as well.11 The most character- istic form of the type has locks that fall over the forehead, as in inv. no. 104. The face resembles Lysippean models, and the general type is influenced by the style of that sculptor, especially the portraits of Alexander attributed to him.12 Further examination reveals that the proportions of the face and treatment of the curls over the forehead, "with large claw in the centre," also have parallels among certain portraits of the emperor Augustus.13 An Italic revival in Augustan art has 7 Hafner 1965, pl. 15, nos. 3 and 4 (Vatican, Museo Grego- riano inv. nos. 13821, 13822); Nagy 1988, 63, no.

Female head (inv. no. 8738). often been noted.14 Although no longer in common use, votive heads of this type seem to have survived for several generations, into the early Empire, and perhaps came to symbolize a form of the ancestral piety much encouraged by Augustus.15 It is not surprising, therefore, that the group should have portrait-like qualities, although these should not be considered as true likenesses of individuals. These heads were mass-produced and reflect a late Classical, Hellenistic trend toward pathos. In Etruria this style represented a break with the popular, linear style of works such as inv. no. 2103 (fig. 6.3.2). Inv. no. 2106 (fig. 6.3 .4) 16 is a large (ca. half life-size) fragmentary female torso, hollow cast. It is broken around the waist. All of the right side and upper arm are preserved. The right arm is bent, with a hole just below the elbow intended to receive the extended lower arm. The left arm, covered by drapery, is mostly broken away. She wears a chiton and over it a mande draped across the back, behind the right arm, and over the left shoulder. On the back, the drapery is not modeled, though the general form of the figure is indicated. The outer, finer layer is broken away on the shoulders in the back, revealing the coarser primary layer. It is apparent that the body was modeled separately, and the drapery was fashioned over it. In the front, the drapery folds are forceful and rugged. The treatment of the drapery and proportions suggest a date in the third century B.c. I have not been able to find exact parallels, although comparable busts have been found at Cales in Campania, and similarly fashioned figures occur among the terracottas from Lavinium.17 14 D'Ercole 1990, 26; Hafner 1966-1967, 49-50; Söderlind 1996, 143. 15 Söderlind 1996, 143-144. 16 Dimensions: ca. 28.7 cm high and 32 cm wide. The inven- tory card indicates that the piece is the gift of Thomas Ashby and gives Artena as its provenance. For votive terracottas found at the site of Artena, see Ashby and Pfeifer 1905, 102, with reference to a location in northwest part of ancient Artena that produced terracotta votive material. Some of this material is now in the Kelsey Museum at the University of Michigan. I was recently sent photographs of the pieces in the Kelsey thanks to the kind intervention of Prof. Elaine Gazda. The material in the Kelsey can be dated to ca. the third century B.c.; Quilici 1982, 22, 63, 80, 102, 108, 123, 129-130, with references to various locations in the ancient city of Artena that have yielded votive terracottas datable from the fourth to second centuries B.c. 17 For comparable busts, see Ciaghi 1993, 40-43.

The type of inv. no. 135 (fig. 6.3.5), for example, can be traced to South Italy, where it is also found in the form of protomes on Apulian plastic vases.18 Although it has been suggested that comparable pieces once belonged to an architectural composition,19 the smooth, fine quality of the fabric argues for its having been part of a votive object. Similar crisp details occur on contemporary votives.20 Inv. no. 8738 (fig. 6.3.6) is a common type that occurs widely and in a number of variations in votive deposits of Etruria, Latium, and Magna Grecia. These differ in size, length of the neck, and presence or absence of the surrounding flange and/or earrings. On inv. no. 8738 the flange is so exaggerated that the face is significantly diminished. Ultimately the type derives from a late Classical model popular in Magna Grecia, where it also appears in large-scale terracotta and marble works.21 Votive terracotta examples of the type without a flange, often wearing a polos, abound in southern Italy and Sicily.22 The flattened forms, outlined eyes, and flange point to Latium or Etruria, where such features are common, and where the polos is usually omitted or replaced by another form of headdress. Figurines The Etrusco-Italie votive figurines fall into two basic categories. The first includes types mainly of local inspiration, displaying local, "indigenous" stylistic characteristics such as large heads, puppet- like proportions, exaggerated features, and a generally linear approach to modeling. Inv. nos. 86, 87, 89, 90, and 91 fall into this group. The second category includes primarily types of Greek in- spiration, such as the ubiquitous "Tanagra" figurines. For the most part these works exhibit greater naturalism in proportions and the rendering of details, as well as closer attention to modeling of drapery and facial characteristics. The database provides all of the pertinent information for the objects that belong to this group. As a whole, however, the Tanagra types do not form a distinct unit in the manner of the "indigenous" group. Examples of both categories occur widely in the sanctuaries of Etruria and Latium. The group of two musicians (inv. no. 86; fig. 6.3.7) is found in a wide area of Etruria but seems to be especially common around Cerveteri. The type, which ultimately reflects a Cypriot origin,23 occurs in a variety of combinations, which range from single figures of a musician to the two figures (as in inv. no. 86) flanking a group contained in a naiskos. The latter arrangement probably refers to the sacred nature of the central group and emphasizes the musicians as special attendants in a rite.24 Inv. no. 87 (fig. 6.3.8) also displays the distinctive features of Etrusco-Latian production: large head, exaggerated and crude features, and smooth surfaces. The meaning of the group is uncertain. 18 Taras. Rivista di Archeologia 1.2 (1981) 203-224, no. 2, pl.

The frontal emphasis is further underscored by the symmetrically po- sitioned child on her lap, who confronts the viewer, being "presented" in the manner of an early Byzantine icon. Inv. nos. 90 (fig. 6.3.10) and 91 belong to a later development of the Etrusco-Latian kourotrophos type. They are very popular in the area of Rome and Palestrina and can also be found at Etruscan sites such as Cerveteri. Arulae Of the miscellaneous votive terracottas, the two votive arulae (inv. nos. 8772 and 8773; figs. 6.3.11- 13) represent peculiarly Etrusco-Latian versions of a type common in Magna Grecia.31 These humble objects have the typical double echinus shape of large-scale altars of central Italy.32 Although arulae are found in greater numbers in Magna Grecia, in that region they conform to the rectangular shape of their monumental counterparts.33 In Rome, the double echinus occurs along with a rectangular, almost cubic altar type.34 The diffusion of the double echinus shape suggests that this type of arula probably originated in Rome and spread from there.35 The morphology of the two arulae in the collection of the American Academy in Rome reflects a development also found in large-scale altars, from the broader, somewhat flatter profile of an upper curve generally smaller than the lower, to a larger, more upright curve of the upper echinus, almost equal in size to the lower in the later examples.36 The shapes of inv. nos. 8772 and 8773 reflect this distinction. Inv. no. 8772 (fig. 6.3.11) has the broader, flatter profile of the upper echinus, whereas inv. no. 8773 (figs. 6.3.12-13) corresponds to the later examples of the type.37 The styles of the figurai decoration on these arulae also bear out their distinct chronological stages. The striding figure on inv. no. 8772 (fig. 6.3 . 1 1) is obviously Archaic in style and may be dated 25 Nagy 1988, 37-38. 26 Nagy 1988, IID3 (alone); Nagy 1994, 216-217, 222 n. 59 (naiskos). 27 Nagy 1994, 218, fig. 19.11. 28 Riemann 1988,41^3. 29 Riemann 1988, pl. 26, 2-4; Nagy 1994, 217-218, fig. 19.11. 30 Vagnetti 1971, GXXb, for example, provides an exact parallel with corresponding measurements. 31 For a more thorough discussion of these objects, see Nagy 2000.

Etruscan Anatomical Votive Terracottas Jean Macintosh Turfa The anatomical collection votives includes in central 28 terracottas, Italian sanctuaries many of them during fragmentary, the late Republican that were period; once of offered these, as a anatomical votives in central Italian sanctuaries during the late Republican period; of these, a few are probably parts of torsos or whole statues (genitalia, hands) that were offered in the same tradition. The widespread Italian phenomenon of offering anatomical models in terracotta at sanc- tuaries of healing cults occurred from the late fourth century down to the first century b.c. When, as is sometimes the case, the mold for a hand or foot has been drawn from a live human, there is little room for style, so it is usually not possible to date such pieces any more precisely. Temple invento- ries from fifth/fourth-century Greece, the terracotta votives from the Corinthian Asklepieion, and literary references from Julio-Claudian and later Rome show that the practice of offering anatomical models at sanctuaries was common in ancient Greece and Italy.1 In other periods and places, the affluent offered anatomical models in precious metals, but the terracotta votives of the Republican period apparendy represent a unique social phenomenon in which a wider array of persons/classes had the wherewithal and social approval that permitted such "personal" dedications. Excavated sites with mechanically or stylistically related terracottas - Ponte di Nona, Gabii, Lavinium, Pyrgi, and Graviscae - can provide a chronological framework for their own deposits. For instance, finds at Lavinium seem to have been produced from the fourth century to the first decades of the second century B.c.;2 and according to Martin Söderlind,3 a few Latin sanctuaries may support a more precise chronology. The American Academy material cannot yet be closely linked to dated contexts, with the possible exception of the objects from Ponte di Nona (inv. nos. 1595, 2441, 1721, 1718, 2440, 1585). The Ponte di Nona finds are paralleled in excavated contexts to the third and second centuries B.c. (coins: 250-150 B.c.) and by stylistic features of the associated head models to the fourth to second centuries B.c.4 The full range of Etruscan and Italic anatomical models is represented in the Academy collection, from hands, feet, eyes, and ears to internal organs - uteri, polyvisceral plaques. Fragments of related statues or torsos are also noted, and votive heads, part of the same tradition, are discussed in another chapter.3 All the documented anatomical material appears to have entered the collections around the turn of the twentieth century and to have been inventoried at the Academy in or before 1948. Further, all the known provenances (for inv. nos. 1595, 1417, 2441, 1721, 1718, 2440, 3493, 1507, 1585) were supplied by Thomas Ashby, with the exception of that for inv. no. 130; pending discovery of 1 For the only serious Greek production of anatomical votives in terracotta , see Roebuck 1951. 2 Fenelli 1975,214. 3 Söderlind 2002. 4 Potter 1985,34,30. 5 See Nagy, "Etrusco-Italie Votive Terracottas," in this volume.</page><page sequence="220">208 JEAN MACINTOSH TURFA any further archival material, these votives may reasonably be assumed to have been collected by him during his topographical surveys of the Roman Campagna.6 None of the pieces that came from van Deman (inv. nos. 2121, 2117, 2116, 2138, 2141, 2120) have recorded provenances, but based upon very close parallels to excavated material, it seems highly likely that certain items came from known sites. Inv. nos. 2138 and 2141, eye and ear, are almost certainly from Ponte di Nona. Inv. no. 2116, a hand, has parallels at Lavinium and Veii (Campetti), both sites with a history of commercial collecting prior to the excavations of recent years. The polyvisceral frag- ment inv. no. 2120, is so far unique, but it would not be surprising to learn that it came from Rome. To return to the pieces assembled by Ashby, six (inv. nos. 1595, 2441, 1721, 1718, 2440, 1585) are said to have come from Ponte di Nona and accord well with other published material from the site.7 These Ponte di Nona deposits have numerous male genital models (cf. inv. nos. 2441, 1721), some nude male torsos (inv. nos. 1718, 2440), and a certain number of polyvisceral plaques of a distinctive type (cf. inv. no. 1585). Although Potter conjectured that the manufacture of most of these homogeneous terracottas took place on or near the sanctuary,8 the fragmentary mold of a foot (inv. no. 1595) is the first mold linked to the site. The strategic position of the bridge on the Via Prenestina of the sanctuary at Ponte di Nona naturally has made it attractive to collectors, and sporadic excavations occurred since 1845, attracting the interest of clandestini at least since the nineteenth century.9 Ashby himself described the situation as of 1901: 10 [0]n the northeast slope of the hill, above a small valley which falls into the larger ravine of the Fosso di Ponte di Nona, there is a large deposit of votive objects in terra-cotta. They have been much destroyed by the ploughing up of the field, but we found many fairly perfect specimens of almost all parts of the human body - though not of the internal organs - faces, hands, feet, legs, bodies, eyes (in the form of small flat discs with a representation of the eye on the upper side), two specimens of the membrum virile , and fragments of drapery belonging to complete figures. In some cases the terra-cottas still show traces of colour. . . . The presence of this extensive deposit of ex-votos points unmistakably to the existence of a temple on this hill, occupying a conspicuous position above the great bridge. Inv. nos. 2138 and 2141, eye and ear, may be assumed to have come from Ponte di Nona, as we said, but by some other route than Ashby s topographical survey. Another Ashby donation, inv. no. 1417, a flexed right arm, is simply attributed to "Latium" - undoubtedly correcdy, although at pres- ent no parallels among published models are close enough to allow speculation on any particular site. Inv. no. 1507, a fragment of a votive uterus, is documented "Artena - Gabretti, Feb. 1901." The name Gabretti, whether excavator or landowner, is not cited in Ashby s publications, but the city of Artena was identified in his topographical survey.11 The character of fragment inv. no. 1507 is analogous to other products of the region of Velletri- Palestrina-Anagni, which surrounds Artena. Votives from the site of Artena, including terracotta figurines, arulae , and vases, have been identified by Roger Lambrechts as having found their way as 6 Ashby 1902. 7 Potter 1985; 1989; Turfa 1986, 205. 8 Potter 1985,29. 9 See Potter 1985, 23-25 with previous references. 10 Ashby 1902, 172-174. 11 See Ashby and Pfeiffer 1905: "terracottas are said to have been found in two places at the east edge of the northern part of the site (Nos. 25 and 26 on Plan)," on terracing on the edge of a small cliff (p. 102).</page><page sequence="221">ETRUSCAN ANATOMICAL VOTIVE TERRACOTTAS 209 Fig. 6.4.1. Fragment of mold for left foot ( inv . no. 1595). far as the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor.12 It appears that votive terracottas were collected from the site as early as the late seventeenth century.13 One more Ashby find, inv. no. 3493, a breast model of uncommon type, is marked "Veii, 6.1.01." Other items in the American Academy collection also come from excavations (of tombs) at Veii.14 The Campetti quarter deposits were recognized as early as 1909, when private excavations and agriculture prompted government intervention.15 Subsequently, two separate (but similar) deposits in the Campetti quarter were excavated, in 1937/1938 and 1963. 16 Given the large quantities of genitalia, etc., found in the Campetti deposits, the sanctuary may have specialized in venereal dis- eases or fertility problems: inv. no. 3493, figure 6.4.8 below, a female breast, may well come from this context. Perhaps a likely source was the Lanciani excavation of 1889 at the Pendici di Piazza d'Armi, which produced over 2,000 votive terracottas, many of which were ultimately dispersed to collections from Italy to the United States.17 The sites of Macchiagrande and Portonaccio at Veii also produced significant and related votive deposits in subsequent, official excavations. Another votive, the testicle model inv. no. 129, although not so well documented, very probably came from Veii. Bartoloni has shown that the pieces of the Medici Collections (once in the Uffizi) almost certainly came from a single deposit excavated in the eighteenth century at Isola Farnese (Veii).18 Parallels occur in collections in Kansas, the British Museum, and Copenhagen.19 Several popular types of anatomical votive models are represented in the Academy's collection. After heads, the most frequently offered anatomical votives are hands and feet. These were often injured by farmers, warriors, and ordinary people who worked hard. A number of the feet show bunions. Two interesting examples are these models of feet. The first is of special interest because it was once a mold for models of feet. A part of a mold for a left foot, from Ponte di Nona, is a common type, with thick, sandal sole, and toenails delineated (inv. no. 1595; fig. 6.4.1). It was made of red terracotta with black inclusions, as a two-part mold, with the bottom of the foot left open.20 The 12 Lambrechts 1983. 13 Cited by Stefano Serangeli; see Lambrechts 1983, 16. 14 From Lanciani and the Benedetti: see Edlund-Berry, "Impasto Pottery," in this volume.

Right hand and arm (inv. no. 1417). outer surface is convex, summarily smoothed, with three brief incisions for alignment of the separate mold parts. Fenelli, Pensabene, and others note that foot votives were probably molded from real feet.21 It is generally assumed that most votives were manufactured near the large sanctuary sites, and several deposits have furnished molds of other body parts. An intact model of a right foot of orange brown terracotta (inv. no. 108; fig. 6.4.2) 22 has a san- dal on high sole, with traces of red paint. It is hollow, with an open base; the upper end terminates slightly above the ankle in a flat edge, completely open. The sandal has narrow bands crossed once over the toes and under the ankle on each side, with flat studs on the side crossings and over the instep and toes. Although not necessarily a pathological presentation, the foot has a distinct bulge, like a bunion, at the base of the little toe.23 Another type of anatomical ex-voto is one representing a hand and right arm from just above the elbow (inv. no. 1417; fig. 6.4.3). 24 Most of the hand is missing. The arm is hollow, bent at the elbow and flattened across the dorsal surface of the upper arm, with rough flanges of extra clay indicating that this was used as a base. The upper end of the arm, which has been hastily smoothed, has a large vent. The hand was probably held open, bent back slightly at wrist and with fingers separated. A thick molding seam is visible on the interior surface.25 A molded votive facial plaque with eyes and nose terminates across base of nose; brows, eyes, nose, and cheeks are softly modeled. The mask, which is rectangular in outline, convex, with smooth edges and back surface, is made of a pale terracotta with many fine, dark inclusions and voids (inv. no. 107; fig. 6.4. 4). 26 Masks probably commemorated healing for problems of eyes-nose-throat, perhaps sinus conditions or respiratory problems. 21 Pensabene et al. 1980, 269. 22 H. 0.165 m; L. 0.27 m; H. of sandal sole 0.047 m. 23 Comparanda: Marsiiiana d'Albegna: S.

Thighs apart from complete legs are rather uncommon votives; most thigh votives include the buttock.28 A group of characteristic anatomical votives represent various sexual organs, male and female. The female breast, below (inv. no. 3493; fig. 6.4.8), fits well into an assemblage such as that of the Campetti deposit at Veii, although technically no mold relations can be identified for it among pub- lished Campetti pieces. A fragment of male genitals from a molded votive torso preserves part of the lower edge, flat, just below a narrow, pendulous scrotum, with smooth depression for the crotch (inv. no. 2440; fig. 6.4. 6).29 We can cite, in contrast, the more dramatically modeled, "sculptural" style torso from Ponte di Nona, also approximately life size.30 In addition to nude torsos and stat- ues, isolated male genitals were common offerings; the collection includes at least two fragmentary examples (inv. nos. 2441-1721), also from Ponte di Nona.

An intact votive breast from Veii, mold-made, was hollow, with a hand-finished irregular edge of clay around the base and a flattened back surface with a small round vent (inv. no. 3493; fig. 6.4. 8). 33 The organ has the shape of an irregular cone, with a series of irregular planes overall, tapering to an irregular point for a nipple. This is unusual for votive breasts, which are generally reduced to simple hemispheres with distinct, cylindrical nipples. The conical, planar appearance recalls votive hearts,34 but the white slip, of which traces remain, is characteristic of votive breasts.35 Inv. no. 3493 fits well into the assemblage of the genitalia from the Campetti deposits, although, as we have seen, technically no mold relations can be identified for it among published Campetti pieces. A likely source was the Lanciani excavation of 1889 at Pendici di Piazza d'Armi.36 A votive, gravid uterus model, mold-made and hollow, has a flattened back with a round vent (inv. no. 130, fig. 6.4. 9). 37 Above a smooth, vertical border, the elongated, oval organ is mod- eled in high relief, with slightly curving neck sectioned just above cervix revealing two layers of "flesh" as convex ridges, oval in shape and constricted in the center. On the (patient's) left side is a smooth, oval, pouch-like appendage attached to the neck of the uterus. The uterus itself is covered by a series of eleven undulating, horizontal, rounded ridges, representing third-stage labor contractions. The provenance is surely to be understood as Palestrina, although the 1948 records for inv. no. 130 (uterus model) state "Palestine." No parallels exist in the Levant, and the piece closely 32 Florence, Museo Archeologico, Medici Collection, pos- sibly from Veii, Pendici di Piazza d'Armi: Bartolom 1970a, 266-267, nos. 33-34, pl. 21c. 33 Diam. of base 0.085 m; depth 0.058 m.

The ridged relief depicts heart, intestines, liver, and lungs.40 Comparable examples were found in a favissa whose production dated from the end of the third to the mid-second century B.c.41 I have suggested42 that this plaque type developed at Veii, where it was produced in five versions and where pseudo-scientific torsos with exposed organs in this format were also manufactured. The type correlates with sanctuaries in the sphere of Rome-Latium-Veii (notably, Minerva Medica, Ponte di Nona, Gabii, Palestrina, Velletri, Veii Campetti). We can compare an earlier, more plastically rendered example.43 This example is so stylized and shallow in relief that it was probably produced late in the series of such votives. As evidence of the state of anatomical and medical knowledge during the late Republican period, the anatomical assortment offers a good representative sampling of the products of the Roman and Latin sanctuaries and Veii, in contrast to Campanian sites like Capua or Etruscan cities such as Caere and Tarquinii. As is the case with most excavated sanctuary deposits, hands and feet prevail,44 and pathological presentations are extremely rare. Foot inv. no. 108 may bear a bunion, but the possibility that such models were molded from living feet makes it difficult to speculate on whether a donor had consciously sought that detail. The male genitals (inv. nos. 1718, 2440) may be infantile and offered in hopes of a cure,45 but this is not the same as other types of disease or deformity, and models of similar appearance are relatively common in the larger sanctuaries. The testicle (inv. no. 129) and vulva (inv. no. 8959), while uncommon except at certain large, urban sanctuaries, especially those at Veii, are not indicative of any advanced practices of dissection or the like. The polyvisceral plaques (inv. nos. 1585, 2120) are parts of series of increasingly stylized representations of animal viscera derived originally from butcher shop displays. They tell more about the donor's economic or ideological status than about prevalent medicine or surgery.46 The votive uterus models (inv. nos. 130, 1507), on the other hand, are indicative of a different trend in medicine or obstetric intervention, suggesting knowledge of post-mortem Caesarean section as a source for the appearance of the gravid organ.47 There may be an association of such models 38 On Praenestine votives dispersed to foreign collections, see De Laet and Desittere 1969, 16-17.

Edlund-Berry Terracotta or as part animals, of tomb mold- gifts. Because or handmade, they were were mass-produced, common offerings they, to like many other deities votives, at sanctuaries have not or as part of tomb gifts. Because they were mass-produced, they, like other votives, have not always received the attention they deserve. There are many parallels for such votive animals, but unless we know the exact provenance for an isolated example or a complete votive deposit, we cannot attribute them to a particular sanctuary or cult. Typical examples of such votive animals from central Italy are a cow or bull (inv. no. 2124), pigs (inv. nos. 2125, 132; [fig. 6.5.1]), and a horse (inv. no. 131; fig. 6.5 .2). 1 All these animals had a part in religious rituals celebrated in later Roman religion. The first two formed part of the Roman sacrifice of suovetaurilia , when domesticated animals, a pig {sus), a sheep {ovis), and a bull {taurus), were sacrificed; the horse figured in the festival of the October Horse celebrated in Rome on the Ides of October.2 The impasto bull, inv. no. 2113 (fig. 6.5.3), presents an interesting problem of provenance and comparanda. The clay, modeling, and incised decoration of parallel lines resemble animal vases, or askoi, from Tarquinia, but there are no exact parallels in the published material. Van Buren, in his 1949 publication of our bull, describes an impasto bull, or askos, at the time exhibited in the Veii room at the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome.3 This bull is larger than our example and "lacks the rouletting but has a large aperture for filling towards the rear of its back and a perforation for pouring at the muzzle."4 At the time of Van Buren s statement, the Veii bull was on display but not published. The 1949 guidebook for the museum by Stefani (1949, 62, no. 38) includes a black-and- white illustration of a case in the Veii room, which includes grave goods, and on the center shelf, a bull of the kind described by Van Buren. According to Stefanis description, the tomb material exhibited in this room actually came from excavations conducted from 1913 to 1916 at several loca- tions (p. 21). These excavations were summarized in a brief article by Barnabei (1919) dedicated to the memory of the excavator, G. A. Colini, and are further referred to by Ward-Perkins (1961, 24) and Bartolom and Delpino (1979, 20). Although the provenance for the Academy bull is unknown, it is possible that it represents a doublet to the one from Veii, and one that consequently was sold or given away during or after the excavations to E. Van Deman, listed in our records as the source. In addition to inv. no. 2113, and inv. nos. 2124 and 2125 discussed above, three other votive animals came from the Van Deman collection (inv. nos. 2130, 2142, and 2149).5 Of these, inv. no. 1 For votive animals in central Italy, see, for example, Gatti Lo Guzzo 1978; Pensabene 1980; Quilici 1983; Pesetti 1994, 60-70, pls.

As a type it belongs to the variety of small animals, including frogs and hedgehogs, who appear as perfume flasks in faience or with painted decoration.6 Regardless of their origin, whether Corinth or Egypt, these animals occur commonly in Italy, in tombs as well as in votive deposits. A close parallel for our monkey comes from Anagni,7 south of Rome, but there are also examples from Rome and in Etruria proper. Three votive animals, in all likelihood of Greek origin, have been included here because of their motifs. The donkey carrying baskets (inv. no. 2130) has parallels from Rhodes as well as from Corinth; the tortoise (inv. no. 2149) resembles examples from Rhodes or Attica, and the horse and rider (inv. no. 8770), a gift to the Academy from Van Buren in 1959, was bought in Athens, although its provenance in all likelihood was Boeotia. Three votive animals, a bull's head (inv. no. 134; fig. 6.5.4), and the pig and horse discussed above (inv. nos. 132 and 131) have an unknown provenance and come from an unknown collection. 6 The standard reference work of perfume bottles in the shape of animals is still Maximova 1927.

Of the three bronze mirrors, one, given to the American Academy collection by Gisela Richter, is an interesting example of a late nineteenth-century "enhancement" of an ancient mirror by adding a decoration that would make it more valuable on the market. The five terracotta cinerary urns, part of a larger gift of Richard Norton, have a typically Etruscan decoration. Three of them have incised inscriptions; here, too, we find a forgery. [Eds.]</page><page sequence="232">220 7.1. Etruscan Terracotta Cinerary Urns Helen Nagy The exact five provenances terracotta cinerary remain urns unknown, were part they of form a larger a cohesive gift of group, Richard and Norton. they can Although be attributed their exact provenances remain unknown, they form a cohesive group, and they can be attributed to Chiusi or its immediate vicinity1 since urns of such types have been found together in common contexts within tombs in the region of Chiusi.2 The Chiusi tombs of the late second century B.c. are characterized by their relatively simple arrangement of roughly hewn chambers flanking a long cor- ridor. They reflect a non-aristocratic segment of society, also suggested by the material, workmanship, and iconography of the urns. Since all of the types represented here are known to have occurred together, they may be assigned to the late second century B.c., the final phase of the absorption of Etruria by Rome.3 Although of limited quality, they and their numerous parallels attest to the survival of an Etruscan identity, which is underscored by their insistence on Etruscan themes and language. Three pieces, inv. nos. 160, 165, 166 (figs. 7.1.1, 7.1.6, and 7.1.11) bear incised inscriptions.4 Inv. no. 160 (figs. 7.1.1-3) has roughly scratched, left to right on the border of the lid, the ono- mastic formula in Latin, with /for filius , "son"; but the presence of the mother's name or matronymic is typically Etruscan. It may be read as: arn sabo au[?] f gainai. Its complexity, as well as the type of ductus , guarantees its authenticity. Sabo , attested in CIE 4840, written as either sapu or 'sapu, is a common name in Chiusi, where it was used as a cognomen by the Calisni family. Inv. no. 165 (figs. 7.1.4-6), a graffito inscription on the front of the casket, has larger, more precise lettering and reads retrograde: Sana evinti, that is, Thana Cvinti, a woman's name, compris- ing her praenomen and gentilizio , or family name. A retrograde graffito inscription encircles the center of the body of inv. no. 166 (figs. 7.1.7-9), an olla, or jar; it can be read as: Sanasaeiclapana. The kind of ductus, the position of the inscription, and the fact that it has been scratched on top of the painted decoration, as well as its meaningless- ness, prove that it is a forgery. Fake inscriptions on ollae, cover tiles, and terracotta urns from Chiusi are very common. With the exception of inv. no. 166, the urns fall into a common category. They are small, bear decoration produced by a matrix only on the front of the box, and carry lids supporting a reclin- ing figure. The scenes on the boxes range from a simple, stylized representation (inv. no. 165a; fig. 7.1.6) to a more complex mythological scene (inv. no. 160a; fig. 7.1.1). 1 The study of Etruscan cinerary urns will be gready enriched by the on-line corpus of urns currendy under preparation by Francesco de Angelis: http://charun.sns.it./ as well as by his recent publication, de Angelis 2012. 2 For instance, the tomb of the Rusina family and the Tomba delle Palazze, discovered in 1927 near Chiusi. Levi 1928. See Michelucci 1977. 3 This dating is corroborated by Sannibale 1994, 124. 4 Enrico Benelli has written a study of the three inscriptions for the Rivista Epigrafica of Studi Etruschi (forthcoming). He has kindly allowed me to use his notes here. I am also grateful to Adriana Emiliozzi, who in the spring of 1994 examined the inscriptions.</page><page sequence="233">ETRUSCAN TERRACOTTA CINERARY URNS 22 1 Fig. 7 .1.1.

It has been considered to represent an episode concerning an agrarian hero, Echedos, from the Battle of Marathon, which was the subject of a famous late fifth-century B.c. painting in the Stoa Poikile described by Pausanias (1.15 .3). 6 With the exception of this lost Athenian painting, Echedos is not known to have been represented in Greek art. The Etruscan urns featur- ing the Hero with the Plow, based on their stylistic resemblance to the frieze of the Nike Temple in Athens, have been thought to reflect a portion of the lost painting.7 There are unquestionable stylistic 5 Brunn and Körte 1916, 3-6, pls.

Rom. 10. 1-2). 9 The iconography of the urns certainly fits this reading, but it is just as likely that the scene on the urns represents the exploit of an anonymous Etruscan rustic hero.10 The figure with the plow has also been identified with the Greek Codros (Plut. Parali. 18), perhaps as the result of a local con- tamination of the Echetlos myth.11 Both are depicted in the literature as having agrarian attributes. Certainly the plow is a significant agrarian symbol in Etruria: the legend of Tages, the occurrence of votive plows and plowing figurines are but a few indications of this.12 Furthermore, the episode occurs in a number of versions. Although the general story is the same, the variations imply not a single visual source but a single story. In some cases a demon occupies the left, balancing the shielded warrior on the other side.13 The demon provides an association with the underworld, but it should not be emphasized in interpreting the event, since it was inserted to complete the composition, and demons were routinely added to mythological and other subjects to stress the funerary nature of 8Brunn and Körte 1916, 177, fig. 37; Maggiani 1985, 26-28, 109-111; Small 1981, nos. 43-50 (reattributed as Arruns and Brutus); Massa-Pairault 1985, 23 1-237, fig. 139 (Chiusi, Museo Archeologico, no. 229). 9Rupp 2006. 10 As suggested by Jameson 1951; Szilágyi 1986; and Maggiani 1985, 101.

Such figures in fact occur on most urns, including ones with the theme of the Theban fratricide of Eteocles and Polyneices.14 An indigenous interpretation of the scene makes sense partly because it parallels these Theban fratricide urns. Urns in terracotta showing the Theban heroes are numerous at Chiusi, and the sub- ject of the Theban war is also common elsewhere.15 A connection between Greek "historical" or legendary scenes and parallel Etruscan themes is not unknown: in the François Tomb at Vulci, scenes of the Trojan massacre parallel those of an indigenous legend, and the Theban fratricide mirrors a local combat.16 In a similar manner, the urns perhaps echo a common theme that may reflect the political tensions caused by the coexistence of diverse communities at the time of Romanization.17 This theme of fratricide may allude to conflicting factions, pro- and anti-Roman, within Chiusine families, and the Hero with the Plow could signify an act of sacrifice in defense of the territory. Based on an analysis of onomastic evidence provided by inscriptions, Françoise-Hélène Massa- Pairault has demonstrated that urns of two types included in the collection - the Theban Fratricide and the dextrarum iunctio , for which see below - can be associated with a social rank below that of the established aristocracy, which, however, enjoyed the benefits of conubium ,18 The archaeological context of the urns certainly supports the argument that their owners were not of the ruling echelon. For instance, the tomb of the Rusina family in the Chiusi region consists of six niches along one side and two on the other side of a long dromos terminating in a rectangular room. The niches were closed by tiles, some inscribed with the names of the deceased. Niches 1, 2, 3, 6, and 8 contained urns depicting the Hero with the Plow motif, while niches 4, 5, 7, and the rectangular cell held urns representing the Theban fratricide. The latter also contained an urn of the dextrarum iunctio type. The tomb was in use during the second half of the second century B.c., with the last deposit datable to ca. 100 b.c.19 According to Massa-Pairault, the disappearance of images that carry some civic message, such as the Theban fratricide, or the Hero with the Plow, coincides with the disap- pearance of the Etruscan polis and the rise of the rural estates resulting in the loss of the nobility, so that themes associated with a gens lose their sense and are gradually replaced with simpler, more obvious images, such as the dextrarum iunctio or the "gate of Hades."20 The style and composition of inv. no. 160a (fig. 7.1.1) derive from late Classical/early Hellenistic Greek works, which are characterized by emphasis on opposing diagonals, foreshortenings, and overlapping to produce depth.21 Southern Italy, particularly Tarentum, may have served as the inter- mediary for the transmission of these elements.22 On inv. no. 160a the style is frozen as a result of the popularization of the type. The body proportions without organic harmony and the too-large heads are typical characteristics of such works, which sacrifice naturalism for the sake of expressive power. 14 Maggiani 1985, 108-109, nos. 107-115.

The compositions vary and de- velop toward greater complexity of depth and texture, but ultimately the visual force of each work relies on the impact of the diagonals.

See Bern- abò Brea 1952, 5-242, esp. figs. 54, 82, 91, 92, 93, 116, and fig. 109; the latter provides a nice parallel for the Theban Fratricide composition found on urns.</page><page sequence="236">224 HELEN NAGY Fig. 7.1.10. Terracotta urn and lid (inv. no. 163a-b). Fig. 7.1.11. Terracotta urn and lid (inv. no. 164a-b). Compositions with similarly diagonal balance of forces and emphasis on symmetry are common on late Etruscan urns, which tend to suppress the narrative aspect of the representation in favor of a more formal, symbolic message produced by the symmetrical composition. Inv. no. 163a (fig. 7.1.10) and inv. no. 164a (fig. 7.1.11), showing the dextrarum iunctio theme, the handshake between husband and wife,23 represent further degrees of abstraction and ever in- creasing symbolic emphasis in their compositions and approaches to the figure. On inv. no. 163a, style and modeling vaguely suggest Hellenistic prototypes. The composition is formal, almost ab- stract in its careful symmetry. This is not a narrative but a symbolic scene. The message of parting and the ensuing reunion in the afterworld is emphasized by the menacing demons, who become increasingly popular in Etruscan funerary art from the late fifth century B.c. on. The subject is to be understood in a strictly Etruscan context. The urn type of inv. no. 163a (fig. 7.1.10) is known in a number of variations, with and without the gate, and is probably contemporary with the Hero with the Plow examples: it occurs together with that type in a number of tombs in the Chiusine territory. It represents a growing tendency in the late second century b.c. for nonnarrative, symbolic themes. The static, almost puppet-like figures of inv. no. 164a (fig. 7.1.11) express a further step away from narrative and toward the purely sym- bolic. Inv. no. 165a (fig. 7.1.1), having dispensed with the human figure, shows a "gate of Hades" and cypresses, as abstract symbols of the final parting. The lid compositions also indicate a general tendency toward abstraction. The reclining woman decorating lid inv. no. 163b (fig. 7.1.12) is the most distinctly rendered of the four lid figures. She is elegantly propped on her left elbow, resting on a double cushion. Her general pose echoes some of the finer urns of Volterra, but the folds are hasty and mechanical, the proportions puppet-like.24 Nevertheless, her expression, if hurriedly executed, is lively. This type of cover is 23 Davies 1985.

Here the artist has chosen to emphasize abstract lines, such as the ovals created by the hem of the garment. The general effect is of a smooth surface that allows the contours of the human body and of the cushion to dominate the composition. Such stylistic traits, which include the combination of abstract elements with a relatively individualized face, occur in Etruria in diverse media, especially in the Hellenistic period.26 Here, the combination of material, small scale, and hurried, mass-produced workmanship indicates a popularized work produced for the general market. Inv. nos. 164b and 165b, reclining male (?) figures (figs. 7.1.13 and 7.1.4), represent this same trend, but with an even more rudimentary rendering of the figures and faces. Inv. no. 166 (figs. 7.1.7-9) is an olla, a type common at Chiusi, where such jars doubtless rep- resent a cheaper type of cinerary container, contemporary with the square casket- shaped containers of the late second century B.c. The decoration of numerous examples, mostly consisting of garlands with ribbons supported on nails, retains its originally vivid colors.27 The Tomba delle Palazze contains such jars along with urns of the Theban Fratricide,28 while the walls of the Tomb of the Tassinaie were painted with festoons very similar to those decorating these ollae, or urns.29 This small collection of Chiusine cinerary urns, while made up of relatively common examples, comprises a well-chosen group that represents the trends in late Chiusine funerary art of the non- elite. As such, it forms an excellent teaching unit. 25 Maggiani 1985, 108-109, no. 113; Bonomi 1977, 104, fig. 44 (Perugia, Museo Archeologico). 26 For example, some of the late sarcophagi: Bianchi Bandi- nelli 1973, fig. 340; Giglioli 1935, pls. 392, 400.

Etruscan Bronze Mirrors Richard D. De Puma The began Etruscans to engrave produced them polished with decorative bronze mirrors scenes in from the at late least sixth the century ninth century B.c. Approximately B.c. but only began to engrave them with decorative scenes in the late sixth century B.c. Approximately 3,500 mirrors are extant, and when the context is known, they are almost always found with female burials. Early mirrors are usually equipped with a tang (inv. nos. 393 and 9578) for insertion into an independent, carved or lathe-turned handle made of another material, ivory, wood, or bone. Tang mirrors are especially popular during the fourth century B.c., when we see a growing number of mirrors with handles made in one piece with the disk (inv. no. 8831). This type becomes especially common in the third century B.c. In addition to this basic differ- ence between tang and handle mirrors, other changes occur as mirrors evolve. For example, the earliest disks are thick and flat, while later disks become thinner and more convex on the reflecting side, giving a larger than normal field of view. The American Academy collection does not include examples of box mirrors, similar to modern "compacts," or relief mirrors, where the decoration is cast in relief rather than engraved. Although many Etruscan mirrors were inscribed with labels identifying the characters represented, none of the three mirrors in this collection bears any trace of original inscriptions. Throughout the long course of production, many mirrors were elaborately engraved with mythological and - more rarely - genre scenes. At the same time, some mirrors were left blank or with minimal decoration (inv. no. 9578). When such "blanks" were discovered in modern times, engravings, often inspired by published versions of authentic mirrors, were added to enhance their value. This has produced much confusion. In recent years scholars have focused a great deal of attention on this valuable class of Etruscan luxury objects. The ongoing publication of the Corpus Speculorum Etruscorum is providing a welcome stimulus to students investigating numerous aspects of Etruscan art, society, religion, and language. Attempts to localize production centers and mirror workshops have employed stylistic idiosyncrasies (e.g., specific decorative motifs; disk shapes) and chemical analyses of the bronze alloys. Stylistic attri- butions to specific engravers are still rare. As more accurate drawings and photographs are published, detailing all data available for individual mirrors, more attributions will no doubt be made. Inv. no. 393 (fig. 7.2.1) is an engraved tang mirror. It is poorly preserved, with several large cracks and lacunae on the disk. The rim is split in several places. Products of heavy corrosion ob- scure all decorative engraving except for that on the lower third of the disk. On the obverse we see heavy light green corrosion products, some of which are powdery. The reverse has areas of light and dark green corrosion, with some copper-colored patches near edges of lacunae. The end of the tang is missing. The object was conserved at the Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia in Rome in 1988. Four tiny fragments of the disk (ranging in size from .04 m to .23 m) have not been incorporated in the present reconstruction.</page><page sequence="241">ETRUSCAN BRONZE MIRRORS 229 Fig. 7.2.1 (left).

Mirror from Vulci with Hermes and another male figure (Klügmann and Körte 1897, pl. 8, 1). This mirror has a large, circular disk that tapers to a shallow extension. The wide tang once would have been inserted into a separate ivory, wood, or bone handle, now lost. The section shows a slightly concave disk with triangular edge and deep groove at the perimeter on the obverse. The obverse (fig. 7.2.2) preserves vestiges of a beaded or notched border that once encircled the disk. The extension, a transitional element between disk and tang, is ornamented with an engraved palmette. Much of this is now lost but, based on similar designs on related mirrors, a reconstruction is given in figure 7.2.2, where solid lines indicate the visible remains while dots suggest missing areas.1 Engraved lines are visible on only the lower third of the reverse disk (fig. 7.2.1). Here we see two pairs of (almost certainly) male legs. The figure on the left seems to sit or stand with his right leg tense and his left leg bent at the knee. The figure on the right reverses this pose. Both figures wear shoes with thick soles, V-shaped fronts, and small flaps at the ankle. These males appear to be nude except for their shoes and some drapery folds that fall behind them. There are also a few lines to indicate what was probably once a leafy border framing this scene. In addition, the figures rest their profile feet on lines that probably are meant to indicate rocks. Because so much of the engraving on this mirror is now lost, it is impossible to be certain about the original subject. Fortunately, there are a number of other mirrors with similar scenes. An example from Vulci2 shows an almost identical arrangement of two figures who wear similar shoes. In this case, the figures represent Hermes and another male, but such compositions may also contain a female figure (fig. 7.2 .3). 3 None of the close stylistic parallels for this mirror has a secure archaeological context. A related mirror shows two seated female nudes.4 This example, as well as others dated solely on the basis of style, suggests a date in the late fourth or early third century B.c. for our mirror. 1 Related obverse designs appear on several mirrors: Salskov Roberts 1981, no. 16; Liepmann 1988, nos. 25, 29; Lam- brechts 1987, no. 20. 2 Klügmann and Körte 1897, pl. 8, 1 = here fig. 7.2.3. 3 In one case (Pacetti 1998, no. 21), there are two nude females wearing shoes and holding spears.

The pose is also quite similar to one routinely used on mirrors representing Herakles and Hermes: De Puma 1987, no. 17, with additional examples cited on p. 32. Often, however, these characters do not wear shoes. 4 Mercando 1976, 181, fig. 8.</page><page sequence="242">230 RICHARD D. DE PUMA Fig. 7.2.4 ( near right). Mirror with Dioskouroi, drawing of reverse (drawing by author; inv. no. 8831). Fig. 7.2.3 (far right). Drawing of obverse (drawing by author; inv. no. 8831). Inv. no. 8831, currently missing, is an engraved hand mirror, intact and in good condition (figs. 7.2.4-5). The right point of the extension on the obverse is missing. On the obverse, heavy dark green and brown incrustations cover most of the surface, with patches of shiny bronze showing through, especially on the upper half of the disk. The handle has a smooth, dark brown patina. The reverse shows small, evenly distributed, light-green incrustations over disk surface and handle, but these do not obscure the engravings. This mirror has a circular disk with narrow, concave-sided extension and a handle terminat- ing in a stylized deer head. The disk and handle are made in one piece. The section shows the pronounced concavity and thin disk with parallel grooves around the perimeter typical of many Etruscan mirrors of late date. The indentation (at center of reverse side) is a shallow circle, ca. 1 mm in diameter. The obverse disk (fig. 7.2.5), the original reflecting surface, is framed by a series of deep notches and an enclosing double groove. These decorative elements surround both disk and extension. The extension contains a "flame" motif. This device consists of two lower leaves that support a triangular element and two upper leaves. The "flame" appears above in the narrowest part of the extension. The handle decoration on this side shows a "totem-pole" configuration of stylized animal (griffin?) heads and a deer-head terminal. The precise significance of both extension and handle ornaments is uncertain, but both features occur on numerous mirrors of Etruscan manufacture. On the reverse (fig. 7.2.4) the handle and extension are undecorated except for a pair of deep grooves on the flat extension. These parallel the extension s concave sides and join the plain, flat border surrounding the disk. The engraved scene on the circular disk shows two highly stylized figures who face each other in mirror-image juxtaposition. Each wears a Phrygian cap, long hair, and a belted tunic. Simple arcs or vertical lines indicate the drapery folds. In each case the outer arm is bent with hand on hip, but the inner arm is not depicted.

The outer feet appear in profile; there are no in- dications of boots or sandals. Two or three quick lines indicate the eyes, and a single downward stroke suffices for the mouth of each figure. There is no other anatomical detail. A small diamond- shaped object appears equidistant between the figures' heads and, judging from related mirrors, probably depicts a star. The style is simple, direct, and highly abstract, with no attempt at anatomical accuracy. On the other hand, the quality of the engraved lines is strong and uniform; it expresses a confidence, however perfunctory, that betrays familiarity; indeed, this subject, with minor variations, occurs on many other Etruscan mirrors. This mirror is one of a large class attributed to the "Maestri delle Lase e Dioscuri" by Guido Mansuelli.5 These always show the same distinctive figure style, with slight variations in attributes - for example, the addition of shields placed behind each figure, or the central "star," sometimes a sunburst, or a multiplication of elements, like a quincunx. The subject of this mirror and the many others related to it is almost certainly the Dioskouroi.6 There are several close parallels for the American Academy mirror.7 These parallels are without specific provenance, but other related examples come from datable contexts. Although none of these archaeological contexts can be precisely dated, they suggest that mirrors of this type may be tentatively assigned to ca. 250 b.c.8 Of the Academy's three mirrors, only one (inv. no. 9578; figs. 7.2.6-8) can be associated with a specific collector: Gisela M. A. Richter. It came into the collection after her death in 1970. We may assume she purchased it in Italy, and most likely in Rome, where she lived for many years. But, as with the other two mirrors, exactly where and when it was collected is not recorded. 5 Mansuelli 1946-1947, esp. 64. 6 For general discussion of the twin gods and their iconog- raphy in Etruscan and Greek art, see De Puma 1973; 1986, esp. 398, no. 2.

DE PUMA It is intact and in good condition. The patina on the obverse is light green; brown corrosion is uniformly distributed over most of surface with no significant eruptions or patchy incrustation. On the reverse, a heavy light green and whitish corrosion completely obscures the original surface. Some of this corrosion and dirt has been mechanically removed from the extension, as shown by small patches of brown felt applied to upper edge of disk. The mirror has a large, circular disk with roughly semicircular extension and heavy, tapering tang with rounded end. The section indicates a slightly concave disk with a thickened, rounded edge and a shallow beaded perimeter on the obverse. The reverse, or nonreflecting, side of this mirror is undecorated (fig. 7.2.7). The extension on this side has a pronounced edge. Two nude females appear at their bath on the obverse, or original reflecting surface (fig. 7.2.6). The standing woman on the left wears her hair in a snood and holds a piece of drapery in her right hand and over her left elbow. A larger kneeling woman on the right turns her head to greet her companion. She holds the long strands of her hair away from her head. Near the edge of the disk is an animal-head spout, shown in profile, gushing water. An ovolo frieze acts as a groundline for the scene; it supports the two women as well as a large hydria. In the exergue is a pair of delicate volute tendrils. A thin meander border with regularly placed crossed squares frames the scene. The extension ornament consists of a pair of symmetrical volutes joined with a large palmette above and a smaller palmette below. Several features of this object immediately arouse suspicion. Most serious is the fact that the figured scene is depicted on the wrong side of the mirror. This "mistake" occurs on authentic blank mirrors that were enhanced in the nineteenth century by engravers who were not sufficiently famil- iar with Etruscan originals to realize that engraved scenes were always placed on the nonreflecting (reverse) side of the mirror.9 Another problem is the different quality of engraving noted when one compares the obverse extension ornament and the figured scene. The extension ornament is rendered in a strong, consistent, and confident style; the figured scene consists of much fainter and more perfunctory engravings. Some of the lines of the meander border even overlap the extension ornament. Furthermore, the patina in each area is quite different; and the engravings of the figured scene penetrate the patina. These problems indicate that most of the engravings on the obverse are modern. Only the ex- tension ornament is ancient and finds parallels on other mirrors.10 The mirror itself has an unusual convex-sided extension. Interestingly, the best parallel for this shape is another mirror certainly known to Richter because it appears in her catalogue of the Metropolitan Museum's bronzes.11 This mirror, purchased in 1896 from A. L. Frothingham, is undecorated except for a similar obverse extension ornament. It is also similar in size and weight to the example formerly in her private collection. The section for the American Academy mirror is perfectly normal. Figure 7.2.8 shows the original appearance of the mirror. Both of Miss Richter s mirrors probably date to the fourth century B.c. Another mirror, in the British Museum, also appears to have modern engravings added to an original bronze disk.12 9 For another ancient blank mirror where the same error oc- curs, see Rebuffat Emmanuel 1973, 128-13 1, 409-41 1, pl. 19. 10 Heres 1986, no. 4. 11 Richter 1915, 279-280, no. 813.

The border was probably inspired by Greek red-figure cup tortài rather than Etruscan mirrors. I believe that the same nineteenth-century engraver s hand is detectable on an unpublished Greek mirror with enhanced engraving in the Museum of Art and Archaeology.15 13 Rebuffat Emmanuel 1991, no. 55 with several parallels cited on p. 31. 14 Klügmann and Körte 1897, pl. 154. 15 University of Missouri, inv. no. 58.24.

We have attempted to bring order to the mass of pottery by presenting it here according to provenance or origin, and in a chronological framework: the earliest, Italic and Etruscan, starting from the Italo-Geometric ; then Greek and South Italian ; and the latest, Rome and Latium. Each of these three groups has its own bibliography. For the sake of convenience, the sigillata has been placed under Rome and Latium, although the manufacture and distribution of this ware are much wider. Other exceptions are the Faliscan lekanis and the Etruscan beaked pitcher discussed at the end of the "Overpainted Pottery " category under the Greek and South Italian section. The terracotta lamps have been grouped together with the pottery, but they have their own specialized bibliography. [Eds.]</page><page sequence="248">236 8.1. Italie and Etruscan Pottery 8.1.1. Italo-Geometrie Pottery Jean M. Davison The purchase eighteen or gift, examples comprise of Italo- three Geometric major categories, pottery according in the Academy to date collection, and provenance: acquired Greek by purchase or gift, comprise three major categories, according to date and provenance: Greek Geometric (eighth to seventh century B.c.), purchased at Thera and on Cyprus; Italo-Geometrie (late seventh to fifth century B.c.); and South Italian "Geometric" (fifth to early third century B.c.). The group as a whole has been labeled "Italo-Geometrie" for the sake of convenience, although there are clear distinctions among vases of Greek origin, Italic imitations of Greek shapes and designs, and South Italian adaptations of Greek linear and floral patterns to local shapes. The large amphora from Cyprus (inv. no. 230; fig. 8.1.1.1), now on display in the Rare Book Room of the Academy Library, is a good example of a later phase (seventh century B.c.) of the widespread Greek Geometric style. It was purchased by Allison V. Armour and Richard Norton while on their 1904 tour of the Eastern Mediterranean (see above, pp. 30-31, 36-37). The oinochoe (inv. no. 299; fig. 8.1.1.2) and the stamnos (inv. no. 298; fig. 8.1.1.3) are typical representatives of Italic imitations (both perhaps from Orvieto). A. W. Van Buren suggests a depen- dence on the Protocorinthian Geometric tradition for the oinochoe (inv. no. 299) and the stamnos (inv. no. 298). The oinochoe once contained calcined bones and had been used as a cinerary urn, while the stamnos was encrusted with soot on its exterior and had thus been involved with fire for ritual or domestic purposes. It is possible that all three objects were acquired in Orvieto from Mancini as part of the Charles collection.1 The bulk of the collection (inv. nos. 570, 297, 1799, 1801, 1800, 1205, 1213, 1214, 1803, and 1200) consists of a series of regional wares from Apulia (Peucetian, Messapian, Daunian) and a single example from Campania (inv. no. 1200; fig. 8.1.1.4). The continuation of Greek influence, especially Athenian, appears in the arrangement of rectilinear and floral ornament in undulating or horizontal bands ( listata ) on native shapes. The two major wares of the Messapian and Daunian workshops are, respectively, the trozzella (the red-figure nestoris) and the a s ko s ' so far they have been found only in funerary contexts. The Academy collection has two examples of the trozzella (see inv. no. 297; fig. 8.1.1.5) and three of the askoi (see inv. no. 1800; fig. 8.1.1.6); all are dated to the late fourth century B.c. and into the third. 1 The rattle (inv. no. 6766) is tentatively ascribed to this provenance and source, and the comparanda for the other two pieces offer their closest analogies to material from Orvieto and its vicinity. Since Van Buren 's typescript of the early 1940s bore the tide "Early Italic Painted Wares under Greek Influence (Three Items)," it may fairly be assumed that the ratde (inv. no. 6766) was the third object.</page><page sequence="249">ITALO-GEOMETRIC POTTERY 237 Fig. 8.1.1.1.

The trozzella , popular also in Lucania, is distinguished by its high angled handles with wheels (or disks) attached to the top and base. Although a metal prototype may be assumed, the immediate precursor of this peculiarity is the Messapian olla with painted circles or disks.2 One of the main areas of production is Rudiae; inv. no. 297 (fig. 8.1.1.5) is part of this output. While the Messapian trozzelle are all wheel-made from the very beginning of their production in the late sixth century,3 Daunian ware does not achieve the use of the fast wheel until the very latest stage of its development.4 Canosa (Canusium/Kanousion) is the center of production. The character- istic form of decoration is that of undulating or horizontal bands ( listata ) of linear and floral/vegetal ornament,5 with the occasional addition of human figures or dolphins. The Academy's examples of this patterned ware (the two askoi inv. nos. 1800 and 1205 and the candelabrum I thymiaterion inv. no. 1214, as well as the unique askos inv. no. 1213) belong to the latest period of production.6 The significance of what at first glance seems a motley array of rather modest wares lies in the fact that the group represents five centuries of cultural development in Italy, before Rome consoli- dated her political control over the whole peninsula early in the third century B.c. 2 Yntema 1974,7-9. 3 Schneider-Herrmann 1980, 17. 4 Yntema 1985, 380: ca. 200 B.c. 5 Yntema 1985, 382, fig. 267; Small 1992 2:41^2. 6 Abruzzese's tardolistata (1974, 46); Yntema s Listata III (1985, 380-390); De Juliis's Listata C (1990, 166; chrono- logical chart 170).</page><page sequence="250">238 8.1.2. Etrusco-Corinthian Pottery Shelley Stone Etrusco-Corinthian Etruria between the wares late imitate seventh the and style the of third decorated quarter Corinthian of the sixth pottery century and B.c., were when made local in Etruria between the late seventh and the third quarter of the sixth century B.c., when local potters began making black-figured versions of Attic painted pottery.1 The American Academy possesses thirty Etrusco-Corinthian vases, of which seventeen are presented in this volume, but only inv. nos. 304A and 303+303a, a battered stemmed plate and an undistinguished pyxis, have a listed provenance (Veii). The potters and painters of Etrusco-Corinthian seem all to have been local; there is litde sign that would suggest that Greek immigrants decorated these wares.2 Etrusco-Corinthian painting copied the popular animal friezes of Corinthian but less elegandy, and at times it shows a charac- teristic Etruscan tendency toward the fantastic.3 The fabric is usually a brown to reddish brown with inclusions and includes minerals that do not occur in the finer pale brown to beige Corinthian fabric. The glaze of Etrusco-Corinthian wares is often brown to grayish and dull and in many cases has not adhered well. The shapes of Etrusco-Corinthian usually imitate those used in Corinthian but may also use types developed by other Greek wares. Some shapes also show analogies to bucchero and impasto vases. Inv. nos. 540 and 541 illustrate the diversity of traditions represented in Etrusco-Corinthian potting. Inv. no. 304 (fig. 8.1.2.1) is a stemmed "chalice" (or shallow plate) that has lost almost all of its decoration. The shape derives from the impasto and Italo-Geometric traditions, but it prob- ably was made during the first half of the sixth century B.c.4 The shape of inv. no. 541 (fig. 8.1.2.2), a skyphos of the second quarter of the sixth century, may be based on a Laconian cup, although a very similar shape was made by Corinthian potters.5 Most of the other shapes represented in the collection have Corinthian parallels, but often with Etruscan adaptations.6 The most impressive Etrusco-Corinthian vases are large pitchers, primarily olpai, which are generally around 30 cm in height (inv. nos. 310, 565, 312, 6319, and 311). The shape 1 The most complete treatment of Etrusco-Corinthian vase painting is Szilágyi 1992 (covering 630-380 B.c.) and 1998 (covering the years 590/80-350 B.c.). He only considers fig- urai vases. A recent overview with fine illustrations is Martelli 1987, 23-29, with catalogue entries 269-296, pls. 46-99. See also Amyx 1988, 685-699; Cook 1997, 142-144. For possible Etrusco-Corinthian vases found outside Etruria, see below n. 13; Bouloumié 1978. 2 It has been suggested that the earliest black-figured artist, the Painter of the Bearded Sphinxes, was a Corinthian im- migrant: Martelli 1987, 25; 1981, 235-236; Zevi 1969. The Corinthian origin of the painter has been denied by Szilágyi and others: Szilágyi 1992, 107-128; Amyx 1988, 688, 698; Colonna 1961a. The mixture of Corinthian and East Greek ornament on the Painter's early work and the non-Corinthian look of his animals suggest that he was an Etruscan. 3 See Amyx 1988, 686 and n. 20, 689-691, 693; Szilágyi 1986; Martelli 1987, 24. 4 See Bellelli 2007, 16-17 fig. 7 for variations of the shape; Cherici 1988, 96-97 nos. 91-92 pl. 52c; De Puma 1986, 39 VC8, pl.

The painter of inv. no. 565 was active during the second quarter of the sixth century, and the cup thus may be a variant of the Corinthian shape. 6 See Amyx 1988, 686.</page><page sequence="251">ETRU SCO-CORINTHIAN POTTERY 239 Fig. 8.1.2.1.

Kylix (inv. no. 341). is similar to that found in Corinthian and always has separately attached round disks ( rotelle ) on the lip to either side of the handle.7 This ornamentation clearly derives from metal vases. Besides the olpai, trefoil-mouthed oinochoai were also made (inv. no. 566), although on a slightly smaller scale than the olpai and of a shape somewhat different from Corinthian versions.8 These large pitchers accommodate multiple friezes and provide the most monumental examples of Etrusco-Corinthian painting. Beyond the cups and pitchers, Etrusco-Corinthian potters also made a large number of small vases, especially alabastra and aryballoi (inv. nos. 307, 543, 539), which bore either figurai or linear decoration.9 The artists who decorated these vases have been placed in a series of workshops by scholars, primarily during the last thirty years.10 Etrusco-Corinthian painting seems to have developed in Vulci and Caere between 630 and 620 B.c., and the most productive workshops were located in Vulci throughout the history of the ware.11 The workshops at Caere initially specialized in a poly- chrome style of decoration that imitated similar late Protocorinthian vases and only began making black-figured vases around the end of the seventh century. The workshops there died out by the end of the first quarter of that century.12 During the first quarter of the sixth century provincial workshops appeared in Tarquinia, with the initial impetus coming from immigrants from Vulci.13 Other workshops of lesser importance likely existed in other centers since the Etrusco-Corinthian wares were quite popular as an alternative to the more expensive imported Corinthian pottery.14 7 On the shape: Amyx 1988, 488^89, 686. 8 See Amyx 1988, 479-481 on the Corinthian version, which generally has an ovoid body. The Etruscan shape often has a biconical body that rises from a vertical cylinder over the foot: inv. no. 1199; CVA Grosseto 2, 9, pl. 4; Amyx 1988, pl. 128. 9 See now Frère 2007a on these shapes (in Campania). The Academy collection includes eleven other vases of this type (aryballoi or alabastra) with geometric decoration, which are presented in the database (inv. nos. 531-536, 1196-1199, 8780). 10 See Szilágyi 1992, 23-28 for a review of the history of research on Etrusco-Corinthian vase painting. 11 See Szilágyi 1992, 17-258; 1998, 289^26 on the work- shops at Vulci.

See also Amyx 1988, 696-697; Martelli 1987, 287-289. 14 Szilágyi 1998, 511-515 proposes that there may have been a Faliscan workshop, as well as one at Veii. It has been suggested that in the early sixth century two workshops of mediocre quality were established by potters from Caere and Vulci at Pontecagnano (Picentia) in southern Campania: see Cerchiai 1990. This is denied by Szilágyi 1998, 692, who sees the workshop there as imitating Corinthian vases but as not constituting workshops of Etrusco-Corinthian potters.</page><page sequence="252">240 SHELLEY STONE Fig. 8.1.2.3 (near right).

The collection of the American Academy includes representatives of many of the major work- shops active at Vulci in the first half of the sixth century but no examples of the earliest Etrusco- Corinthian. The earliest work at Vulci was in the black-figured technique, but polychrome figurai work began there in the late seventh century b.c., only to disappear during the first quarter of the sixth century.15 Besides the figurai vases, the potters of Vulci also made olpai with nonfigural deco- ration, with the Group of the Phoenician Palmettes (inv. no. 566; fig. 8.1.2.3) and the Group of the Intersecting Arcs ( Gruppo degli Archetti Intrecciati , inv. nos. 312 and 311 [fig. 8.1.2.4]) lasting from the late seventh into the sixth century B.c.16 15 See above, nn. 4 and 10. 16 On this type of decoration: Bellelli 2007.

This group seems to be the successor to the late seventh-century Painter of the Polychrome Arcs, who, Martelli (1987, 25-26, 280-281, pls. 64-65) suggests, may have been a Corinthian immigrant to Etruria. Szilágyi 1992, 172-179 (and esp. n. 5) considers him a local. It seems clear that the Groups of the Phoenician Palmettes and of the Intersecting Arcs were roughly contem- porary since examples from both workshops appear in the same tombs. See Dohan 1942, 102-104 (Vulci tomb 26), no. 1 (Phoenician Palmettes), nos. 3-4 and 6 (Intersecting Arcs); Matteucig 1951, 40 - 41 (tomb F), nos. 26-27 (Phoenician Palmettes) and nos. 25 and 28 (Intersecting Arcs); Bartoloni 1972 (tomb VII) 76-77, nos. 3 and 10 (Intersecting Arcs) and nos. 6-9 (Phoenician Palmettes).

He worked in both the polychrome and the black-figured techniques during the last years of the seventh century and the first decades of the sixth century.17 Inv. no. 543 (fig. 8.1.2.5), an alabastron, was once the name-vase of the Ameri- can Academy Painter, but that artist s work is now accepted to be the black-figured segment of the Pescia Romana Painter s oeuvre. His work is reasonably well drawn, and the subject matter of the alabastron s decoration, opposed lions and water birds, is characteristic of Etrusco-Corinthian. Another alabastron (inv. no. 307; fig. 8.1.2.6) is extremely large (H ca. 0.425 m). It seems also to have been painted in the workshop of the Pescia Romana Painter and illustrates Etrusco- Corinthians interest in fantastic subject matter.19 On it a fragmentary bearded centaur with a crown on his head and wearing an odd garment moves to the right. He is followed by a panther with a remarkably elongated neck, a proportion characteristic of Etrusco-Corinthian painting. The large amount of rather casually arranged filling ornament is also a hallmark of Etrusco-Corinthian style. The artists of Vulci painted many vases that imitated the larger shapes in Corinthian painting. Inv. no. 8237a (fig. 8.1.2.7) comes from a krater and preserves part of an animal frieze. It appears to come from the workshop of the Feoli Painter, an artist of the first quarter of the sixth century.20 In the later first and the second quarters of the sixth century Etrusco-Corinthian wares at Vulci were dominated by a few highly productive workshops. The most prolific was that of the Rosoni Painter (sometimes called the Rosoni-Krateri Painter).21 Inv. no. 312 (fig. 8.1.2.8) is a typical example of the large olpai that were the favorite product of this workshop.22 Characteristic of the Rosoni Painter's work are the monotonous animal friezes using relatively few species (mainly birds and panthers). These are enlivened by much added color and rather casual and fanciful incision. The enormous roses in the fields of these friezes are, of course, the motif that gives the artist his name. Besides the Rosoni Workshop, several other workshops were active at Vulci from 580 to 550 B.c. These also painted many large olpai, which led to their work being designated the "Olpai Cycle," within which in recent years several hands have been recognized.23 One of the most prolific of these, the Hercle Painter (named after a tomb at Vulci), painted both inv. no. 6319 (fig. 8.1.2.9) and inv. no. 566 (fig. 8.1.2.3).24 Inv. no. 6319 is a large olpe with three friezes of ill-preserved animals. This artist uses many more kinds of animals than the Rosoni Painter, including boars and doglike lions, 1980, 36-37, pls. 19-20; Langlotz 1932, 137, pl. 225; CVA Wurzburg 3, 37 pl. 17.4-5 (with further examples). 17 On the Pescia Romana Painter and his identification with the American Academy Painter: Szilágyi 1992, 201-219, esp. 212.

The Rosoni Cycle was first recognized by Albizzati 1924, 48-49, discussed briefly by Beazley and Magi 1939, 74 (no. 84), and in more depth by Brown 1960, 55-56. The first detailed study was that of Colonna 1961b, 47-76. Colonna recognized two major hands in the Cycle, one the Rosoni Painter, who led the Cycle, and that of a successor Colonna dubbed the Krāteri Painter. The existence of the latter has been doubted by Amyx 1965, 3-5; see also Amyx 1967; 1988, 696. Because of the difficulty in distinguishing Colonna's two hands, it has become common in recent years to refer to the artist as the Rosoni-Krateri Painter when in doubt: Martelli 1987, 28, 291-292 pls. 86-87; CVA Grosseto 2 20-21 pl. 23.

Inv. no. 566 is the only oinochoe in the Academy s collection of Etrusco-Corinthian vases. Its decoration is similar to that of inv. no. 311, although there are only two friezes of animals. Both vases show the Hercle Painter s penchant for extensive bloblike fill ornament The final large olpe in the Academy's collection (inv. no. 311; fig. 8.1.2.4) was painted by the most unusual Etrusco-Corinthian artist. The Boehlau Painter is generally considered to have worked at Vulci in the very early years of the sixth century B.c., due to his relatively limited use of fill orna- ment.25 It recendy has been suggested that his style is so unique that he may have worked later than has been thought, perhaps close to the middle of the sixth century B.c.26 In general, the arguments advanced for a dating at the beginning of the sixth century seem more cogent to this author. Inv. no. 311 is a good example of the Boehlau Painter's work; characteristic are the extremely elongated animals featuring extensive incision of an almost childlike nature. The Boehlau Painter's work shows the distance that Etrusco-Corinthian vase painting could diverge from Corinthian, and yet his work achieves a kind of charm through its fanciful style. Another workshop at Vulci in this period was led by the colorfully named Knotted Tail Painter. This workshop stands between the Olpai Cycle and the Rosoni Workshop. Besides large vases such as olpai, the Knotted Tail Painter and his followers also made many small vessels, especially cups such as inv. no. 541 (fig. 8.1.2.2).27 Although the decoration is poorly preserved, inv. no. 541 shows the casual drawing and emphasis on added color on the animals, and the decorative frieze on the rim that characterizes the work of this painter of the second quarter of the sixth century.28 The latest workshops within Etrusco-Corinthian painting began in the second quarter of the sixth century B.c. and probably continued working into the early years of the third quarter.29 These created small vases decorated with a limited repertory of motifs and clearly presage the demise of the ware around 540 B.c. The American Academy possesses a number of vases from the Bird Cycle (inv. nos. 308, 540, and 539; figs. 8.1.2.10-12), one of these late workshops.30 Two of these (inv. nos. 308, 540) are small lidded pyxides, a shape seen also in inv. no. 303 +303a (figs. 8.1.2.13), which bears linear decoration. Given their small dimensions, it seems likely that these were used to hold ointment or makeup. Inv. no. 539 (fig. 8.1.2.12), also made in the Bird Cycle, is a globular aryballos. Another globular aryballos made by the cycle was in the Academy's collection before World War II but is now lost (inv. no. 1195). 31 As has been noted, many Etrusco-Corinthian vases do not have figurai decoration but rather bear linear decoration or abstracted floral motives. Some of these may be quite large, such as the 25 On the Boehlau Painter: Szilágyi 1992, 222-232; Amyx 1988, 693; Martelli 1987, 277-278, pl. 60.3-5, 284, pl. 72. The artist was initially identified by Böhlau 1899, 103. 26 Amyx 1988, 693 suggests that there are analogies between the Painter's style and the earliest Etruscan black-figured vases imitating Attic wares (Pontic). Both Szilágyi 1992, 23 1-232 and Martelli 1987, 277-278 date the Painter's work to the first decades of the sixth century. 27 On the Knotted Tail Painter: Szilágyi 1998, 37 1-378.

Impasto and Bucchero Pottery Ingrid E. M. Edlund-Berry and Richard D. De Puma Impasto Pottery (Ingrid E. Aí. Edlund-Berry) The collectors. American Few Academy's authoritative impasto records and have bucchero survived, collection but we was do acquired know that sporadically most of the by material several collectors. Few authoritative records have survived, but we do know that most of the material was already in the Museum of the American School of Classical Studies in Rome in 1905, when A. M. Harmon compiled a catalogue of the collection.1 When the name of a collector is known, it is included in the database of the collection. Some of the personalities who contributed impasto and bucchero objects to the Academy include Thomas Ashby, T. Edmonston Charles, Esther B. Van Deman, A. W. Van Buren, and Richard Norton. Impasto ware was a native Italic ware characterized by its coarse, poorly fired clay. It was made by hand and fired in open-air kilns from relatively unpurified clay. Found in the earliest contexts, it is the typical ware of the Villanovan period, with a wide distribution area. The group of impasto pottery in the Academy collection includes a variety of objects ranging in provenance from Orvieto, Veii, and Cerveteri to the Faliscan and Latin regions.2 Of the impasto pottery, three vases (inv. nos. 265, 266, and 270) come from the Van Buren collection and four (inv. nos. 1183, 1194a-b, 11208, and 1181) from the Van Deman collection. Vases inv. nos. 206 and 268 originated in the Charles collection, and the rest, with the exception of inv. no. 3965, are unknown. The three large biconical urns (inv. nos. 1810 [fig. 8.1.3.1], 265, and 266 [fig. 8.1.3.2]) are representatives of this shape; they have a varying amount of decoration.3 An interesting detail about urns inv. nos. 265 and 266 is that they were actually made with only one handle instead of two; when an urn was made with two handles, one was often broken off to indicate funerary use.4 Urn inv. no. 265 comes from Cerveteri, as does in all likelihood the ribbed helmet-lid (inv. no. 1812), originally crowned with a knob in the shape of the roof of a hut (inv. no. 8726). Urn inv. no. 266 is impressive because of its elaborate incised design, with a pair of seated figures facing each other above the handle. Its provenance, Veii 1902, and source, Van Buren,5 suggest that it forms part of a group including as many as eight pieces of bucchero.6 Though the stated provenance of the urn and other vases implies that they were purchased direcdy from an excavation at Veii, there are no excavations recorded for the year 1902. On the other hand, in 1900 Lanciani conducted a salvage operation of some tombs along the old Formello road, and in 1900-1901 Annibale and Fausto Benedetti excavated the necropolis of Monte Michele.7 Concerning Lancianis excavation, 1 For a history of the collection, see Harmon and Hansen 1932, 103-104. For a discussion of the individual collections that form the base for the Academy collection of impasto and bucchero pottery, see Van Buren 1946 and Geffcken, "The History of the Collection," in this volume. 2 The impasto objects in the collection were first described by Van Buren 1946. 3 For biconical urns, see Bartolom 1987. 4 For the handles on biconical urns, see Edlund 1980; van der Meer 2011, 50. 5 For Van Buren, see Kohl, Linker, and Kavelman 1995, 3 16. 6 Plain Bucchero inv. nos. 1642, 1638, 1641, 296, 275, 1634, 1644, and 1645. 7 The 1900-1901 excavations at Veii are briefly described in Mengarelli 1901.

It is inv. no. 206, a large traylike cooking stand that would have supported a vessel on three struts projecting horizontally from the top edge.9 The form resembles that of the richly decorated trays, or focula , in bucchero,10 but it lacks any kind of decorative details. Another piece from Orvieto is a kyathos (inv. no. 268; fig. 8.1.3.3). Included in the category of impasto pottery are a few pieces of Faliscan shape or decoration.11 The most characteristic example is a stemmed plate, inv. no. 1181, with an incised design of alter- nating volutes and palmettes. Inv. no. 1813 (fig. 8.1.3.4) is a fragmentary two-handled cup, with impressions around the body of "wolf tooth triangles" and a rope design, both accentuated in white. Inv. no. 269 (fig. 8.1.3.5) is a cup with a biforated looped handle. The large two-handled jar (inv. no. 1814) is considered Faliscan by Van Buren;12 but its clos- est parallel, now in Hamburg, comes from Vulci, and the motif of parallel ribs is also known from the Bocchoris tomb at Tarquinia. The spiral amphora (inv. no. 1183, fig. 8.1.3.6) is a shape known from Etruria, Latium, and the Faliscan territory,13 but Hayes, at least, advocates a Faliscan place of manufacture rather than south Etruria (Veii), or even Ischia, as has also been suggested.14 Two vases illustrate the wide distribution of impasto shapes and decoration. A jar with cover (inv. no. 1194a-b; fig. 8.1.3.7) and a cup with biforated handle (inv. no. 1208) probably come from Latium, but parallels exist from Etruscan as well as Faliscan sites.15 The last item in this group of impasto pottery (inv. no. 3965) is a curiosity from the point of view of its original owners. It is a sherd from the acropolis at Norba, which was given to A. Frothingham by A. Pasqui.16 After Frothingham s death in 1923 it was presented, together with other pieces in his collection, to the Academy by W. Lowrie. According to the records, the collection had meanwhile passed back and forth between Lowrie and Jesse Benedict Carter, Director of the Classical School 1907-1913 and Director of the Academy 1913-1917. Etruscan Bucchero (Richard D. De Puma) Bucchero, the modern term applied to the most characteristic type of Etruscan pottery, is a reduc- tion ware. This simply means that the pottery was fired in a kiln that was purposely deprived of a 1979, 19, the excavators, Annibale and Fausto Benedetti, were brothers, whereas De Puma refers to them as father and son (De Puma 1986, 6). 8Bartoloni and Delpino 1979, 19. 9 For cooking stands, see Scheffer 1981. 10 See De Puma, "Bucchero Pesante " below, inv. nos. 207 and 208. 11 Publications of Faliscan pottery often concentrate on individual sites, such as Narce (Barnabei 1894; Dohan 1942; Davison 1972), or Narce, Capena, and Poggio Sommavilla (Salskov Roberts 1974).

M. EDLUND-BERRY AND RICHARD D. DE PUMA ready supply of outside air. Such conditions "reduce" the pottery to a distinctive black color both on the surface and, if reduction is complete, throughout its core. Etruscan potters may have enhanced the degree of blackness in some cases by using particular clays rich in manganese or adding, at the proper moment, green wood to the kiln fires. Most pieces show clear evidence of careful burnishing, and some appear to have been given a coating of fine slip. The precise process no doubt varied over time and location. Scholars have distinguished two major types of bucchero. Finely levigated, thin-walled vessels thrown on the wheel characterize the earliest variety, bucchero sottile , or plain bucchero. Bucchero sottile appears to have originated in southern Etrurian workshops, especially at Caere, in the first quarter of the seventh century B.c. These early vases employ a wide variety of ornaments, but incised and rouletted decoration is most common. The open and closed "fan" motif, made with a comblike tool, is especially frequent. The delicacy and elegance of the earliest bucchero sottile gave way after the seventh century to increasingly thick- walled and less lustrous vases. This type appears to be a more utilitarian version, often utilizing the same shapes. Decoration is perfunctory when it exists at all.17 Plain Bucchero Pottery ( Ingrid E. M. Edlund-Berry ) The group of plain bucchero pottery includes examples of most of the basic Greek shapes, such as an oinochoe, kyathos, kantharos, chalice, or cup.18 Among the more unusual shapes are a kyathos with a coxcomb looped handle (inv. no. 277; fig. 8.1.3.8); a kantharos set on a low, wide base (inv. no. 290; fig. 8.1.3.9); a chalice with a broad, flat rim (inv. no. 275); and a stemmed dish with a grooved vertical rim (inv. no. 294; fig. 8.1.3.10). Some pieces are of particularly high quality. This is the case for the handsome Nicosthenic amphora, a characteristically Etruscan metallic shape (inv. no. 3941; fig. 8.1.3.11), a small jug with a tall looped handle (inv. no. 1642; fig. 8.1.3.12), and a stemless cup with stippled incised decoration (inv. no. 1178, fig. 8.1.3.13). Inv. no. 3941 (fig. 8.1.3.11) is a fine example of a Nicosthenic amphora with wide strap handles. From the point of view of the collection, it is noteworthy that it originally belonged to A. Frothing- ham and, after his death in 1923, was presented to the Academy by W. Lowrie. According to the inventory, the vase was part of a tomb group found at Anagni, as described in a letter by Mancinelli.19 The tomb context consisted of this amphora, a Corinthian bombylios or alabastron (inv. no. 3940; no longer extant), and five small bronzes: two fibulae (inv. nos. 3978 and 3981), a small bracelet (inv. no. 3979), a ring (inv. no. 3982), and a miniature axe (inv. no. 3980). Five vases, complete or fragmentary, have "Veii, 1902" as their provenance (inv. nos. 1638, 296, 275, 1634 [fig. 8.1.3.14], and 1644) and Van Buren as their source.20 To the same group belong in all likelihood three other vases (inv. nos. 1642 [fig. 8.1.3.12], 1641 [fig. 8.1.3.15], and 1645) together with an impasto biconical urn (inv. no. 266; fig. 8.1.3.2) with the same provenance and source. Since there are no excavations recorded for 1902, it is possible that they all derived from excavations carried out at the necropolis of Monte Michele at Veii in 1900-1901 by Annibale and 17 Cook 1997, 144-147. 18 For bucchero shapes, see De Puma 1986, 8-13. 19 The Mancinelli referred to in connection with the tomb group from Anagni is in all likelihood Francesco Mancinelli, who had excavated with Frothingham at Narce; see De Puma 1986, 3-7.

Five pieces that came from Orvieto had originally belonged to the Charles collection.22 These are an oinochoe (inv. no. 287; fig. 8.1.3.16), a kantharos (inv. no. 290; fig. 8.1.3.9), a kotyle (inv. no. 278, fig. 8.1.3.17), a chalice (inv. no. 291), and a plate (inv. no. 295; fig. 8.1.3.18). Two chalices in the plain bucchero group (inv. nos. 1632 [fig. 8.1.3.19] and 1633) came from the Ashby collection.23 It is possible that they, too, were purchased at Veii. According to Bartoloni and Delpino's account of the excavations at Veii, Lanciani conducted a salvage operation in 1900 to stop clandestine activity in some tombs along the old Formello road in 1900. The tomb contents, which included bucchero, Italo-Geometrie ware, and impasto, were for sale at Isola Farnese, and Ashby is reported as having bought a few pieces of bucchero.24 An oinochoe (inv. no. 8814) came from the Van Buren collection, probably with the Roman market as its provenance. A chalice (inv. no. 1179), a cup (inv. no. 1180), a phiale (inv. no. 1175), and a bowl (inv. no. 1191) from the Van Deman collection25 have unknown provenances.

A characteristic group of plain bucchero is finally that of small tools or utensils (inv. nos. 523, 388, 386, and 387). These are commonly found with trays or focula from Chiusi or Orvieto such as inv. no. 208, bucchero pesante. Of these, the rectangular tablet (inv. no. 523) sometimes referred to as a scraper, or as a writing tablet, might have served as a palette for mixing ointments or cosmetics.26 Bucchero Pesante (Richard D. De Puma) Bucchero pesante , or heavy bucchero, is abundandy represented: there are nineteen specimens in the American Academy's collection. As the name indicates, this pottery is heavier than bucchero sottile' it has thick walls and, in general, is made with less refined clay. Reduction is often incomplete, and large vessels are frequendy friable, indicating that many were probably intended for tomb use only. The earliest bucchero pesante so far recovered from datable contexts comes from the beginning of the sixth century B.c. Major workshops at Vulci, Chiusi, Tarquinia, and Orvieto produced large quantities throughout the century. The decoration is often complex, with surfaces elaborately stamped (inv. no. 284; fig. 8.1.3.22) or modeled in relief (inv. nos. 282, 285, 1643, and 4064 [fig. 8.1.3.23]). Impressed friezes, produced by rolling a carved cylinder seal across the vase when it was still leather-hard, are especially popular on bucchero pesante (inv. nos. 279, 280, 497, 1640, 498; fig. 8.1.3.24a), although they occur in earlier bucchero sottile as well. Perhaps the most characteristic feature of bucchero pesante is the use of clay appliques (inv. nos. 207, 208, 500, 1385 [fig. 8.1.3.25]). These were stamped from carved molds much the way one might cut gingerbread cookies from rolled-out dough. Later they were easily attached to the surface of the vase with diluted slip. Other, usually larger, vases were thrown in a "jigger," a type of relief mold attached to the potter's wheel. The same appliques and seal impressions often appear on different vases and quite likely indicate a common workshop origin. Often relief ornaments are enhanced by incision (inv. nos. 501, 499; figs. 8.1.3 .26a-b). A .11 T^v T-v . r'!~' y s r-</page><page sequence="264">Fig. 8.1.3. 24a.'

Ultimately, it may reflect metallic prototypes and, indeed, some of its features resemble details that would be appropriate in metal versions. In excellent condition except for some minor chips on the base, the chalice is made of well-levigated and reduced black fabric with lustrous surface. The tall, hollow trumpet-shaped foot rests on a grooved base ornamented with an incised zigzag framed by single parallel fines. At the center of the stem is a wide torus molding framed by pairs of smaller torus moldings and grooves. A similar pair of torus moldings occurs at the base of the stem. The flaring bowl is elegantly decorated with three friezes. The major frieze shows three crouching lions (almost identical to those of inv. no. 282) alternating with three "archetti," or small archlike motifs in relief. Incisions both delineate the lions' tails, paws, and facial features and also provide each "archetto" with curls. Above this major band is a frieze of incised zigzags that alternate with "X" motifs to create a kind of triglyph and metope frieze. The top frieze is a simple, continuous zigzag framed by parallel fines. This type of chalice is normally associated with Chiusi and Orvieto. Dated 550-500 b.c., inv. no. 285 comes from Orvieto. It entered the Academy collection from that of Dr. T. E. Charles. The second object (inv. no. 498; figs. 8.1.3.24a-b) is another chalice;28 though fragmentary, it is important nonetheless because its impressed cylinder seal frieze represents a rare combination of subjects in the corpus of known seal impressions decorating Etruscan pottery. Of well-levigated and reduced black clay, it only survives as the central part of the hollow stem of a chalice. The impressed frieze is very worn in certain areas and interrupted by a break on one side. The stem is decorated with a figurai frieze framed by a pair of incised fines at the base and four deep grooves at the top. This complex frieze is difficult to interpret because several parts are illeg- ible (fig. 8.1.3.24b). From left to right, there appears the upper portion of a (female?) figure (no. 1) with arms held out to touch an obscure element (a), either the back of a throne or perhaps another figure. No. 2, a seated figure wearing a long robe, is being attacked by no. 3, a male brandishing a weapon. A second male (no. 5), carrying bow and arrow, strides behind him. Between them, lying on the ground with buttocks raised, is a decapitated nude (no. 4). Nothing remains of no. 6, and only the lower portion of a robe indicates the position of a female (no. 7) standing behind a male (no. 8) who moves to the right. The legs of another male (no. 9) appear before the first of two tripod cauldrons (b and c) whose lower portions are preserved. The foot is all that remains of a male (no. 10) who would have been the mirror image of no. 9. A kneeling leg and raised, clenched fist survive of still another male (no. 11). No. 12 is perhaps a better-preserved version of the figure postulated for no. 10. Nos. 11 and 12 flank the second tripod cauldron (c). Originally this stem probably belonged to a chalice similar to one in Sèvres.29 The seal represents motif XLIV.30 Only three other examples are known: the Sèvres chalice, a fragmentary chalice in Pienza,31 and a fragmentary plate from Tomba della Pania at Chiusi, now lost.32 The most legible 27 Inv. no. 285 (Harmon 309); H., 0.222 m; Diam., 0.145 m; Diam. of base, 0.114 m.

There are three different subjects on the seal of inv. no. 498. In the best-preserved section (fig. 8.1.3.24b, nos. 1-5) we see the assassination of a seated figure and are reminded of Orestes s murder of Aegisthus or Neoptolemuss murder of Priam. The tripod flanked by two men (nos. 9-10) suggests Herakles and Apollo fighting over the Delphic Tripod, although no. 8 accompanies on the double flutes. On the better-preserved impressions, no. 11 is an animal-headed figure. This could show the Minotaur with Theseus (no. 12). Of course, it is quite possible that our seal represents unfamiliar scenes from Etruscan rather than Greek mythology. Dated ca. 620-580 B.c., inv. no. 498 possibly comes from Chiusi. It entered the Academy collection from that of R. Norton.33 33 Gran-Aymerich 2014 arrived too late to be considered here in detail, but we want the readers to be aware of this important publication on the subject of bucchero.</page><page sequence="267">255 8.1.4.

Greek and Italian Pottery Shelley Stone Corinthian Vases Corinthian the middle wares of the dominated sixth century the B.c., Italian when markets they were from largely the middle eliminated of the by seventh Attic pottery.1 century until The the middle of the sixth century B.c., when they were largely eliminated by Attic pottery.1 The ware is divided into two chronological phases: Protocorinthian, produced between ca. 720 and ca. 630 B.c.,2 and Corinthian, produced between ca. 620 and ca. 550 B.c.; the decade 630-620 B.c. is considered transitional from Protocorinthian to Corinthian.3 Each phase is further divided into early, middle, and late periods.4 Protocorinthian potters invented the black-figure technique, which decorated most of the vases exported to Italy during the first quarter of the seventh century.5 Many of the vases are small, and the large number of shapes suitable for aromatic oils suggests that they were filled with Corinthian perfume.6 Repetitive friezes of animals form the preferred decorative format; Corinthian pottery only occasionally shows narrative scenes. The finest period in Corinthian pottery was the second half of the seventh century. After 600 B.c. the overall quality of its vases declined due to the pressures of mass-production.7 Later Corinthian vase painting demonstrates a reduction in the quality of the drawing and a profusion of filling ornament, primarily rosettes, in the friezes. The American Academy possesses eight Corinthian vases, none with a recorded provenance. Of these, five are presented here (inv. nos. 542, 1210, 8781, 8780, 8786). Inv. no. 8781 is a small ovoid-bodied aryballos (fig. 8.2.1), a type of perfume vase.8 It is decorated with a frieze in which running dogs pursue a rabbit - a popular type of decoration on these small vessels - and dates to the second half of the seventh century B.c.9 Another perfume vase, an alabastron (inv. no. 8786; fig. 8.2.2), shows a transitional scheme of decoration, with only a few filling rosettes. It was probably painted by the Griffin Painter, who 1 See Amyx 1988 on Corinthian vase painting (with bibli- ography).

Most of the other Corinthian vases belong to the Early Corinthian period, which lasted between ca. 620/615 b.c. and ca. 595/590 b.c. Inv. no. 544 (fig. 8.2.4), a globular-bodied aryballos decorated with an animal frieze, has been attributed to the Early Corinthian Warrior Group by Amyx.12 Its lax style illustrates the decline in the overall quality of painting characteristic of developed Corinthian, as opposed to Protocorinthian.13 The final Corinthian vase presented here is a small globular aryballos (inv. no. 2084; fig. 8.2.5), decorated with a sloppy frieze of marching soldiers, whose bodies are made up of large round 10 For similar vases, see Amyx 1988, 437; Neeft 1987, 275, 282-288, CXIII-CXIV. 11 Amyx 1988, 53-54, 302, 373. Neeft 1991, 22-23 suggests that the Griffin Painter and the Painter of Munich 283 (Amyx 1988, 55-56) may be the same artist. 12 It is near the Typhon Painter: Amyx 1988, 57B, 373 .

Vases with ornamentation so limited in quality are difficult to date, but parallels suggest that it dates to the Late Corinthian I period (ca. 570-550 B.c.).14 Ionian and lonicizing Vases Although Corinthian wares were the most popular import to Italy during the seventh century and first half of the sixth century B.c., the inhabitants of Italy also imported vases made in eastern Greece. These wares are commonly referred to as "Ionian," although some of them were made in Dorian centers (such as Rhodes) in the eastern Aegean.15 The centers in which these wares were manufactured are not in all cases known, although it is clear that workshops were located in the major urban centers. The decoration of these wares is only occasionally figurai; generally they are decorated only through alternating stripes of gloss and reserved areas.16 The "Ionian" imports to Etruria have been provisionally catalogued and studied by Martelli, Pierro has provided a complete account of the Ionic wares and their imitations at Tarquinia, and van Compernolle has recently analyzed the "Ionian" cups found in Etruria.17 Regrettably, less work has been done in southern Italy and Sicily, with the notable exception of Megara Hyblaea.18 It is nonetheless clear that "Ionian" pottery was imported to most areas in Italy during the late seventh and the sixth centuries B.c. and that a number of the shapes, notably the so-called Ionian cups, were imitated by Italic potters.19 The American Academy possesses four "Ionian" vases, of which two are presented here (inv. nos. 571 and 8729) and the other two catalogued on the web. Two additional cups imitate "Ionian" wares, and one of those is published here (inv. no. 300). A provenance is recorded for only inv. no. 300 (Veii), but it is highly likely that the others were found in Italy. Inv. no. 8729 (fig. 8.2.8) is a type of small perfume vase decorated simply with stripes called a lydion .20 It was made in the later seventh or early sixth century B.c. Inv. no. 571 (fig. 8.2.7) is an Ionian cup, the most popular eastern Greek product found in Italy and one of the most popular shapes manufactured by eastern potters in the Archaic period.2 These 14 See Hopper 1949, 186-189; Biegen, Palmer, and Young 1964, 100, 105.

See CV A Pushkin Museum 1, 20, pl. 10.1-2 for an alabastron with this style of decoration attributed to the Circle of the Warrior Frieze Painter. 15 See Cook and Dupont 1998 for a general history of East Greek pottery in the Archaic period. 16 Figurally decorated East Greek wares are relatively rare in Italy: Martelli 1978 lists only five Wild Goat vases, seven Chiot chalices, and a few black-figured vases (Fikellura, Ionian Little Master cups, Campana dinoi) found in Etruria. The Campana dinoi were likely made in Italy: Cook 1997, 15 1 . More Ionian ceramics have been found in Magna Grecia, but the amount remains small compared to the quantities of Corinthian and Attic wares. The Swallow Painter (Pittore delle Rondini), who painted in a Wild Goat style, was ac- tive in Vulci in the last quarter of the seventh century B.c.: Giuliano 1963; 1975; Hind 1970; Cook 1981; Martelli 1987, 25, 276-277, pls. 58-59; Szilágyi 1992, 108; 1998, 692; Cook and Dupont 1998, 68-70; Cook 1997, 144. He has generally been considered an East Greek artist who immigrated to Vulci and who worked in close association with the Bearded Sphinx Painter but who left no legacy. 17 See Martelli 1978; Pierro 1984, 9-107; van Campernolle 2007. 18 "Ionian" cups are common at most Sicilian sites.

Inv. no. 300 (fig. 8.2.6) was purchased at Veii and was likely made there or nearby. The small tonguelike decoration found around the foot of inv. no. 300 is an unusual decoration for an "Ionian" cup and is likely an Etruscan embellishment. This vase is an adaptation of the normal shape of this type of cup since it does not have any handles. It imitates an "Ionian" cup type rare in Italy, but otherwise it is similar to Villard and Vallets Form B3, both in shape and decoration. This cup represents a step beyond inv. no. 571 in the development of the Ionian cup shape during the sixth century B.c. 22 For systems of classification, see Villard and Vallet 1955, 14-34 (which is used here because it is best known to scholars working in Italy); Furtwängler 1980, 163-166; Boardman and Hayes 1966, 1 1 1-134; Cook and Dupont 1998, 129-13 1 .

The Corinthian and Etrusco-Corinthian examples are the largest group of black-figured vases within the collection and have been discussed in another section of this chapter. The other black-figured pottery is made up of 27 catalogued Attic vases and fragments. The twelve significant Attic black- figured vases in the Academy's collection, comprising five cups, four amphorae, and three lekythoi, are presented here. Fifteen small decorated fragments are presented only in the database of AAR, with little commentary other than photographs. In addition, four Attic decorated lids are included in the database since they were probably used to cover black-figured vases.24 Many of the Attic vases and fragments probably came to the Academy in 1914, when Joseph Clark Hoppin purchased the collection of Cavaliere Riccardo Mancini, an amateur excavator from Orvieto.25 Unfortunately, of the decorated vases, only inv. nos. 6737, 6506, and 6580 (and two striped lids, inv. nos. 6375 and 7498) are recorded to have come from Orvieto.26 Inv. nos. 318 and 314 were part of the Charles collection, which derives from Orvieto and Viterbo.27 Inv. no. 319 was purchased in Rome by James Loeb in 1903. Inv. no. 320 was purchased by A. M. Harmon in Rome in 1905; it was said to have come from Tarquinia by Richard Norton, on unverifiable grounds. The lekythos inv. no. 8977 was given to the Academy by Gisela Richter and was probably purchased in Rome.28 All of the Attic vases presented here, with the exception of inv. no. 6737, date in the last third of the sixth or in the early fifth century B.C. None is particularly distinguished work. The earliest datable piece in the collection is a Droop cup (inv. no. 6737; fig. 8.2.9) decorated in the silhouette technique without any incision; it dates between 550 and 540 b.c.29 The type B cup inv. no. 319 (figs. 8.2.10-11) is attributed to the Haimon Group of the first half of the fifth century B.c.30 The type C cups inv. nos. 318 and 320 (figs. 8.2.12-13) are both unremarkable products of the last quarter of the sixth century B.c.; so too the fragmentary stemless cup inv. no. 505 (fig. 8.2. 14).31 The amphorae (inv. nos. 314, 547, 6506 + 6580, and 6530 + 6641; figs. 8.2.15-18) are more interesting. The Academy possesses two virtually complete examples of the shape. Inv. no. 314 (figs. 8.2.15-16) depicts the Gigantomachy on one side and satyrs and maenads partying with Dionysos 24 1 am greatly indebted to Dr. Andrew Clark for reading a draft of this chapter and making many useful observations and comments. Any errors that remain are, of course, mine alone. On amphora lids: Moore and Philippides 1986, 18, 147, nos. 370-372. 25 I am indebted to Professor Katherine Geffcken for this information, as well as many other notes on the provenance of the vases in the Academy's collection. 26 Inv. no. 6375 is documented as a purchase by Hoppin and was probably part of the material bought from Mancini in 1914. 27 Some of Mancini's collection had earlier come to the Acad- emy as part of the Charles collection, of which around half was purchased from Mancini, and hence from Orvieto, and the other half purchased from Giosafat Bazzichelli at Viterbo. 28 ABV, 544, nos. 159-160 lists two lekythoi with identical scenes as "Rome, Richter." Inv. no. 8977 is obviously one of these; the location of the other is unknown to me. 29 See Ure 1932, 57-59, group B, esp. 59, no. 23, fig. 3, dated after 540 B.c. Moore and Phüippides 1986, 65-66, 306, nos. 1747-1748, pl. 1 12 provides the earlier chronology, which I have adopted here. 30 On the shape: Blösch 1940, 1, 41-109; Moore and Philip- pides 1986, 23, 67.

Black-glaze Wares, Attic and Italic The collection of the American Academy includes 39 vases and fragments of black-glaze vases dating from the sixth into the first century b.c. They comprise six Attic examples of the sixth and fifth centuries and 33 vases and fragments that were made in Italy. Some of these bear stamped and incised decoration. The Attic vases include three complete vessels (inv. nos. 8787, 8981, 8979) and three fragments of stemless kylikes with stamped and incised decoration. The complete vessels are presented here. The fragments are available in the database of the AAR; they were all purchased by J. C. Hoppin in Orvieto (probably from R.

The Italic vases in the Academy's collection have been divided into five subgroups based on their probable points of origin. Eight are likely Apulian, although no documentation is preserved of their origin; three are presented here. Inv. no. 1176 (fig. 8.2.27) is a stemless kylix with interior decoration of stamped and incised ornament. Both shape and decoration imitate that of Attic stemless kylikes of the fifth century B.c., but the Apulian examples of the shape date to the fourth century B.c. and mainly to the first half of the century.42 The lekanis inv. no. 1177 (fig. 8.2.28) is a favorite Apulian shape during the fourth century B.c.43 Both inv. nos. 1176 and 1177 were given to the Academy by Esther van Deman; unfortunately her source for these vases was not recorded. Inv. no. 9489 (fig. 8.2.29), a column krater, probably dates to the second half of the fifth century B.c.44 The painted decoration on its upper body and neck relate it to contemporary Attic vases of the Saint Valentin class, and the krater 's decoration thus is an ancestor of the development of overpainting in the fourth century. Three black-glaze vases in the Academy's collection appear to be from Campania. The only significant vase from that region is an askos (inv. no. 331; fig. 8.2.30) with a spout in the form of a lion's head with protruding tongue. The best parallels for this are Campanian, and the grayish fabric may be that of Teano.45 The other two Campanian vases are presented in the database. The largest number of black-glaze vases in the Academy's collection, thirteen in all, come from Etruria or Latium. A plate base with a nominal stamp (inv. no. 1510; fig. 8.2.3 1) was found at Artena in southern Latium.46 The nominal stamp in Latin can be paralleled at Cales during the third and second centuries B.c., but the hard, pale red fabric of inv. no. 1510 differs from the fabric of that city.47 The plate was thus made at some other center in Latium. Inv. nos. 1806 and 1182 (figs. 8.2.32-33) are mesomphalic phialai made at Tarquinia in the late fourth or early third century B.c.48 Both have stamped decoration on their floors around the 41 See Sparkes and Talcott 1970, 174, 327 no. 1289 pl. 43 (dated 450-425 B.c.); Roberts 1978, 87-89, nos. 5 and 10 pl. 59.2 and fig. 9e for a similar black-glazed pyxis.

Roberts 1978, 86-90 groups both the Warsaw and American Academy examples with red figure pyxides, which she dates ca. 470-460 B.c. She speculates (90) as to the rarity of black-glazed pyxides. 42 Stemless kylikes of this type have been found in a number of graves at Ordona in Puglia that are dated to the first half of the fourth century B.c.

The kyathos inv no. 1184 (fig. 8.2.37) has a "metallic" profile similar to that seen on many "Malacena" vases but differs from that ware in fabric and glaze. As Morel has noted, it is a unique shape, but its best parallels are Etruscan vases of the third century B.c.52 Finally, a fragment of a plate or bowl with stamped decoration on its floor (inv. no. 2529) was found by Ashby at Ponte di Nona near Rome (at the ninth mile on the via Gabina Praenestina). Parallels place it in the third century B.c., but the place where this vase was made is not known.53 The remaining nine black-glaze vases cannot be identified as to their origin. The only one of these vases with a known source is inv. no. 1809, a shallow bowl or saucer (fig. 8.2.38) that cannot be paralleled. It comes from the Curtis estate, which may indicate it comes from Etruria or Latium. The glaze and character of this vase suggest that it dates to the later fourth or the third century B.c.54 Attic, Italic, and Other Red-figured Vases The collection of the American Academy includes a small assortment of red-figured vases consisting of seventeen Attic examples, nine South Italian vessels, and two Etruscan vases. There is, in addition, a fragmentary Attic white-ground lekythos. Of these vases and fragments, three Attic vases are pre- sented here, along with eight of the South Italian red-figured examples, and both Etruscan vases. The remaining fourteen Attic fragments, and a single South Italian vase, are available in the AAR s database. Attic Vases Of the Attic fragments, seven were purchased by Joseph Clark Hoppin at Orvieto and presumably come from tombs in the region of that city. The finest Attic red-figured vase (inv. no. 8775; fig. 8.2.39), a fragment of a kylix by the Brygos Painter, was also purchased in Orvieto by Mrs. E. D. Van Buren.56 The provenances of the other Attic red-figured vases in the collection, as well as that of the white-ground lekythos in the collection, are unknown, but they may be presumed to come from Italian tombs. Of the Attic fragments in the Academy's collection, only one seems to date to the late sixth century B.c., and only three represent the late Archaic period. Eleven fragments belong to the second and third quarters of the fifth century B.c., while only two pieces date to the last quarter of the fifth century B.c. Only two of the Attic vases in the Academy's collection have been previously attributed.

All attributions to painters were made by the late A. D. Trendall.62 None of the South Italian vases is a masterpiece; rather they are good examples of the ceramic craft as practiced in various regions in Italy during the fourth century B.c. The earliest piece is a Lucanian bell krater (inv. no. 1838; figs. 8.2.43-44) by the Creusa Painter, who was active from the end of the fifth century B.c. and the earliest decades of the fourth century.63 The lekanis lid inv. no. 8797 (figs. 8.2.45-46) is the work of a Sicilian artist, the Prado-Fienga Painter, who was active ca. 380-360 b.c. and whose work influenced subsequent Paestan vase painting.64 These are the only two Italian vases that date before 360 B.c. Three of the vases are Campanian. The fish plate (inv. no. 1837; fig. 8.2.47) is by the Grassi Painter (active ca. 360-330 B.c.),65 while the skyphos (inv. no. 1838; figs. 8.2.48-49) and lekanis lid (inv. no. 1193; fig. 8.2.50) were produced by minor artists in the same general period.66 Only one of the Academy's red-figured vases surely comes from Apulia. The lekanis lid (inv. no. 8798; figs. 8.2.51-52) derives from the workshop of the prolific Baltimore Painter, active in the period ca. 340-320 b.c.67 Like the South Italian red-figured vases, neither of the two Etruscan red-figured vases in the Academy's collection has a listed provenance, although both were certainly made in Caere during 61 On Eury dike: Schwarz 1988. There are no surviving depictions of Orpheus and Eurydike involving a chariot, nor should she be seen as a queen.

Overpainted Vases and Related Wares The American Academy has fifteen black-glaze vases with overpainted decoration. In this technique, the decoration was painted over the black glaze in slips with a limited range of colors (white, red, and yellow).69 The technique became common in Apulia during the second quarter of the fourth century B.c., where it developed out of earlier traditions of Attic vases decorated with linear or vegetal pat- terns in white slip over black glaze. In southern Italy, an additional influence in the fourth century B.c. was the practice of using much added color on Apulian red-figured vases of the "ornate style."70 Overpainted vases from ancient Italy are traditionally called "Gnathian." The appellation derives from the discovery of many vases in this technique at Egnazia (ancient Gnathia) in Apulia around the middle of the nineteenth century.71 Apulia remained the area that produced some of the finest overpainted vases during the second half of the fourth century B.c., when the technique spread to other areas in Italy and to the eastern Mediterranean.72 Overpainting in Apulia seems to have lasted at least until the end of the third century b.c., but the floruit of the technique was the second half of the fourth century.73 Nevertheless, overpainting continued to be used in limited ways at various centers in the Mediterranean world into the first century B.c.74 Although elaborate figurai compositions were made in Apulia in the early years of production, during the second half of the fourth century the technique was used increasingly for purely decora- tive effects. The motifs employed are generally florals or isolated figures, and the overall result is often miniaturistic and "pretty."75 Overpainted decoration was used mainly on small vases, although pitchers and amphorae usually achieve a height of over 20 cm.76 The small scale suggests that the vases were not very functional, a hypothesis supported by the fact that the decoration does not adhere well to the black glaze. Many overpainted vases have been found in tombs, which suggests that they may have been made only for funerary use. 68 For the pitcher: Del Chiaro 1974, 49-53 no. 94, pl. 56.

All appear to have been found in Italy. Two of the vases (inv. nos. 1188, 1187), were part of the 1937 bequest of Esther Van Deman. One of these (inv. no. 1188) is Apulian, the other (inv. no. 1187) Campanian. Another Apulian vase (inv. no. 8815) was purchased by Mrs. Elizabeth Van Buren in Rome in 1914. The only overpainted vase with a listed provenance is the lekanis inv. no. 1796, which is said to have been found at Civita Castellana (Falerii Veteres) in 1914 - probably in company with the lid inv. no. 1792, which snugly fits the lekanis.77 One overpainted vase in the Academy's collection is Attic. The sessile kantharos inv. no. 324 (fig. 8.2.55) dates to the third quarter of the fifth century B.c. and is a member of the Saint Valentin Class 77 The inventory card states that the lekanis was found at Civita Castellana, but Professor Katherine Geffcken points out to me that A. W. Van Buren 's inventory book does not list a provenance.</page><page sequence="289">GREEK AND ITALIAN POTTERY 277 in which the ornament is rendered in white paint over the black-glazed surface.78 A large number of Saint Valentin vases have been found near Bologna, and inv. no. 324 may well come from that region.79 The decoration in registers is characteristic of developed examples of the class, which first appeared around 450 B.c. and disappeared in the first decades of the fourth century.80 In the late fifth century and the first half of the fourth century, the Peuketian Xenon Group imitated Attic vases of the Saint Valentin Class but used native southern Italian motifs and shapes (see inv. no. 8790; fig. 8.2 .56). 81 Attic vases of the Saint Valentin Class thus were direct ancestors of fourth-century overpainted wares in Italy. One of the Apulian overpainted vases in the Academy's collection, the ring guttus inv. no. 1188 (fig. 8.2.57), is decorated in red glaze over black glaze, a technique used by Xenon Group vases.82 Most of the true overpainted vases in the Academy's collection are Apulian work of the second half of the fourth century or the early third century B.c. (eight vases in total, of which four are presented here, inv. nos. 1188, 1794, 8790, and 8815). Five of the Apulian vases in the Academy's collection are oinochoai (see inv. nos. 1794, 8815), one of the most favored shapes in "Gnathia" during this period.83 Of the Academy's Apulian overpainted wares, only inv. no. 1794 (fig. 8.2.59) has figurai decoration (a female tragic mask), while inv. no. 8815 (fig. 8.2.58) has the most elaborate vegetal decoration. Besides the Apulian overpainted wares, the Academy has a fine little kernos (inv. no. 1187; fig. 8.2.60), probably from Teano in Campania, where these peculiar vases seem exclusively to have been made.85 The clay of inv. no. 1187 does not, however, correspond to the gray hue usually ascribed to the fabric of Teano, and it seems possible that it was made at another center in Campania. Its decoration corresponds well with other wares known to be from that region. Though the provenance of inv. nos. 1796, 1792, and 1842 is central Italy - Faliscan or Etrus- can - they are included in this chapter, as examples of overpainted ware. As noted above, the lekanis and lid inv. nos. 1796 and 1792 (fig. 8.2.61) belong together, and the lekanis was apparently found at Civita Castellana.86 The Faliscan origin of these vases is demonstrated by the decoration on the lid, which is more geometric than that seen on the Apulian vases. 78 On the St. Valentin Class: Howard and Johnson 1954; Moreno 1965, 1067-1068; EVP, 219, n. 1. 1 follow Moreno's chronology. 79 See Howard and Johnson 1954.

Roman and Latían Pottery 8.3.1. Italic Votive Vessels Ingrid E. M. Edlund-Berry Introduction The or miniature category of representations votive pottery includes of full-scale a variety vases of such objects. as amphorae Votive pottery or kraters. usually The consists term suggests of small or miniature representations of full-scale vases such as amphorae or kraters. The term suggests that this kind of pottery was found in connection with altars or other places of sacrifice, sometimes as part of a group or deposit. When the find context is known, however, it is not uncommon to find miniature vases in tombs as well as at sanctuaries.1 The comparanda and source of some of the votive pottery suggest that these objects might have formed part of the votive deposit from Tivoli from the Ashby and Van Deman collections.2 To this group belong a jar (inv. no. 1202; fig. 8.3.1.1), a jug (inv. no. 345), a cover or bowl (inv. no. 1204), another bowl (inv. no. 1285), and a biconical bowl (inv. no. 1287). Other objects definitely come from the Van Deman collection - a jar (inv. no. 1201; fig. 8.3.1.2), a cup (inv. no. 1203), a miniature kyathos (inv. nos. 1289, 1288 [fig. 8.3.1.3]), a plate (inv. no. 1189), and flat-bottomed dish (inv. no. 1286), but they cannot be attributed to a specific site, except for a kalyx krater (inv. no. 1190), from Civita Castellana. A bucchero miniature kyathos (inv. no. 289) belonged to the Charles collection, and its origin is therefore Orvieto, while a jar (inv. no. 8802) from the Van Buren collection has an unknown provenance. An impasto twin cup (inv. no. 3491), a min- iature kyathos (inv. no. 344; fig. 8.3.1.4), and a skyphos (inv. no. 4065) came from an unknown provenance and collection. The numbers and shapes of votive pottery are helpful in determining the location and popu- larity of ancient places of worship and the form of worship practiced there. The presence of kilns at a sanctuary site suggests that the votive pottery, and perhaps other kinds of offerings as well, was made locally; but unfortunately, the relative modesty of the quality and workmanship of vo- tive pottery and other mass-produced terracotta objects has resulted in incomplete recording and preservation of votive deposits. 1 Recent excavations have produced exemplary publications of votive pottery. See, for example, Gualtieri and Fracchia 1990. Others, inspired by the pioneering efforts of A. Cornelia and M. Fenelli to map previously excavated votive deposits, have undertaken to publish or republish important votive material. See, in particular, Vagnetti 1971; Cornelia 1986; Nagy 1988; and Bartolom and Benedettini 2011. 2 For these and other collections at the American Academy, see Geffcken, "The History of the Collection," in this volume.</page><page sequence="296">284 INGRID E.

Votive Deposit from Nemi: Temple of Diana The sanctuary of Diana at Nemi owes much of its mystique to the famous introduction to Frazer 's Golden Bough'. No one who has seen the calm water of the Lake of Nemi, lapped in a green hollow of the Alban hills, can ever forget it. Diana herself might still be lingering by this lovely shore, haunting these woodlands wild. In antiquity this sylvan landscape was the scene of a strange and recurring tragedy. On the northern shore of the lake stood the sacred grove of Diana Nemorensis - that is, Diana of the Woodland Glade.3 The site was excavated in 1885 by Lord Savile, under the condition that the finds be divided between him and the landowner, Prince Orsini. Several buildings were uncovered, including a temple podium, but the work was not completed, and only sketchy records remain of the discoveries. Lord Savile's portion of the fragments of marble sculpture and architectural decoration, architectural terracottas, and votive objects became part of the collections at the Nottingham Casde Museum, whereas Prince Orsini sold his share to museums and private individuals, including the Ny Carlsberg Glyptotek and the Museo Nazionale delle Terme in Rome.4 There is no record of how Ashby acquired the pieces that were in his collection (inv. nos. 1467-1500).5 They included clay statuettes (inv. nos. 1467-1477, 1487-1488, 1495), black-glaze 3 Frazer 1890. Frazer is alluding to the ritual of human sac- rifice carried on at the Tauric Chersonese, which he suggests Orestes brought back with him to Italy, though Fontenrose 1966 (chap. 3) and others criticized Frazers assumption that a rite of this sort actually ever occurred at the Sanctuary of Diana Nemorensis. 4 MacCormick 1983; Melis and Serra Ridgway 1987; Bouma 1996; Bilde 1998; Green 2007. 5 Van Buren [1943], 13-14.</page><page sequence="297">ITALIC VOTIVE VESSELS 285 and other pottery sherds (inv. nos. 1478-1486, 1489, 1494, 1496), lamps (inv. nos. 1490-1491), stucco fragments (inv. nos. 1492-1493), a glass fragment (inv. no. 1497), and pieces of wood (inv. nos. 1498-1500), briefly described by Van Buren 1943. The only extant pieces are a cup (inv. no. 1491; referred to by Van Buren as a lamp) and a ter- racotta statuette of Diana (inv. no. 1469). There were some excavations in the years following 1885, for which only brief records exist.6 Votive Deposit from Ponte di Nona The site of Ponte di Nona is located at the bridge crossing the stream Pons de Nona, along the Via Praenestina. The bridge, consisting of seven arches of Gabine stone, is one of the landmarks around Rome and is named after its location, at the ninth Roman mile from the city. In his description of the Roman Campagna in the early 1900s, Thomas Ashby describes the site of the votive deposit as follows: On the hill just beyond the bridge, ploughing brought to light some twenty-five years ago a large deposit of votive objects in terra- cotta, representing almost all parts of the human body (though not of the internal organs), mostly life-size, with some small figures of cows and horses, which betokened the presence of some temple. Excavations were carried on ten years later, and brought to light a number of Republican coins. These show that the sanctuary existed from about 300 B.c. to the birth of Christ. Of the temple itself no remains came to light; but a rectangular enclosure walled in hewn stone was found, and just outside it were two cavities in the rock, full of votive objects.7 As a result of continued agricultural activity and looting, the site suffered badly, and a rescue operation was begun in 1975 by the British School in Rome. According to T. W. Potter, the site was used in Republican times as a rural sanctuary, to which farmers brought offerings, for the most part consisting of terracotta models of feet, hands, limbs, and heads. The number of ex-votos found in two seasons, 1975-1976, was over 8,000, of which over 6,000 could be readily identified. The pres- ence of a small bath at the site and the deformity of many of the feet, in particular, suggest that the primary function of the sanctuary was as a place for healing, serving perhaps both travelers along the Via Praenestina and the local farmers.8 According to the inventory and Van Buren s description of Thomas Ashby 's gifts to the Acad- emy, the terracotta spool presented here (inv. no. 2521; fig. 8.3.1.5) was once part of a large group of objects (inv. nos. 1524-1604 and 2408-2594) consisting of terracotta figurines and anatomical votives and a few pottery fragments of Etrusco-Campanian bowls.9 It is likely that these were bought by Ashby, or given to him, in conjunction with the excavations that were carried out in the early part of the twentieth century. 6 Notizie degli Scavi di Antichità 1887; 1888; 1895. 7 Ashby 1927/1970, 132-133. 8 For the early excavations, see the reports in Notizie degli Scavi di Antichità 1912 by Pasqui and Mancini.

EDLUND-BERRY Votive Deposit from Tivoli The material from a votive deposit at Acquoria, Tivoli, has an interesting history.10 According to the inventory, a group of miniature disks, spools, jars, and plates was presented to the Academy as part of the gift by Thomas Ashby. Van Buren s notes on the Ashby collection describe the objects and their provenance as follows: In the tray as opened 29. II 1942 are forty items; one is a portion of a Greek (Proto- corinthian?) bowl with horizontally set handle: fine buff clay, vestiges of bright red glaze. (.07). One is a bicorn handle, set vertically, of a large impasto vessel. There are two minute fragments of handles of ochre clay. The remaining 37 items present a homogeneous appearance, and clearly form part of a hoard of ex-voto miniature impasto hand-made vessels etc., similar to, if not actually belonging with, the group of material that was presented to the AAR Museum from Dr. Van Deman s Estate, and described in the catalogue of her material, with citation of the official publication of a similar, or the same, hoard, NS 1927, 215-249 . . .n Van Buren 's text further contains handwritten bibliographical references to the site of the votive deposit from Tivoli, including the statement in the excavation report from Notizie degli Scavi di Antichità (NSc) 1927, 242, which mentions explicitly that Ashby had bought some of the votives excavated in 1898 ("Degli oggetti raccolti nel 1898, non solo gran parte si disperse per Tivoli e gran parte fu portata dal Borsari a Roma: ma ne ebbe in regalo Giacomo Boni, ne comprò F Ashby, e ne tenne il Mengarini stesso").12 The discovery of a votive deposit at Tivoli, reported in NSc 1898, 332, was due to some con- struction by an electrical company, the Società Anglo-Romana per F Illuminazione di Roma. The site is described as being on the left shore of the Anio, and the deposit was associated with the Temple of Hercules Victor.13 Twenty-five or so years later, excavations were continued, this time to expand the plant of the same Società Anglo-Romana. As stated by the excavator, U. Antonielli, these excavations showed beyond a doubt that the votive material was in no way connected with the Temple of Hercules Vic- tor but rather formed part of a deposit placed carefully in a rich blackish soil ("fra la terra grassa e nerastra e cosparsa qua e là di carboni, in serie compatte, 'stipati' nel vero senso della parola") and defined by a line of evenly cut tufa blocks and the remains of a tufa platform. Because of the work (or damage!) done in 1898, it was not possible to define the extent of the votive deposit.14 The importance of Antonielli s publication lies in the careful description of the location of the deposit but also in the catalogue of the objects accompanied by line drawings. Thanks to these draw- ings it is possible to identify the objects in the Ashby collection at the Academy (inv. nos. 3135-3146, 3148-3169) and to recognize that they represent a small part of the total deposit, in which there were as many as hundreds of examples of each type, including disks (inv. nos. 3135-3138, 3148-3152; 10 Bouma 1996, 100-102. 11 Van Buren [1943], 46. 12 Antonielli 1927. 13 For the location of the site within the context of Tivoli and the Aniene River, see Bjur and Frizell 2005, 33-34.

These represent somewhat different shapes from those in the Ashby collection, such as high-handled cups (inv. nos. 1264-1265; fig. 8.3.1.9) and spiraling disks (inv. nos. 1275-1277; fig. 8.3.1.10) - but correspond in clay and model- ing and have definite parallels with the objects described and drawn in Antoniellis publication. In all, the combined Ashby and Van Deman votive groups from Tivoli represent 59 items. A few more can be traced to the University of Michigan collections, and a large number of objects from the 1898 excavations is displayed in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome.16 According to the inventory text, these twenty votives were bought at the Villa Adriana at Tivoli in 1903. There is no reason to doubt this statement, and they would then also belong to the group excavated and dispersed in 1898. While there is no record of when Esther Van Deman purchased (or was given) her collection, it seems likely that it too originated in the 1898 excavations since many of the votives found then seem to have found new homes. 15 Antonielli 1928, 235, "circa duecento es."; "un centinaio di es." 16 Van Ingen 1933; Enea nel Lazio 1981, 40-42.</page><page sequence="300">288 8.3.2. Roman Amphorae Archer Martin Amphorae These were are primarily defined wine as two-handled and olive oil jars but for also the fish transport sauces and of liquid other or products semi-liquid such goods.1 as fruit These were primarily wine and olive oil but also fish sauces and other products such as fruit preserves. The ancestor of amphorae appears to be the Canaanite jar of the Bronze Age. This gave rise to a tradition of Punic amphorae, which spread to Punic areas in the western Mediterranean. The Greeks adopted the amphora in the seventh century B.c. and developed characteristic types for each major producing area. Naturally, the Hellenic areas of the West shared this tradition. The Roman tradition derived from Greek - for example, through the evolution of the Greco-Italic amphora into the Dressel 1 amphora and the adaption of the Koan amphora to the Dressel 2-4. These types spread with the Romans to the provinces, including to the previously Punic West, where there was some mixing of traditions. Amphorae remained in use throughout antiquity and into the Middle Ages, although probably with some competition from barrels, particularly in areas with a Celtic background. The study of amphorae began relatively early in the history of archaeological research.2 The greatest stimulus came from the interest in epigraphic material on amphorae, especially stamps but also graffiti and dipinti. In order to describe more exactly in the Corpus Inscriptionum Latinarum (CIL) the inscribed amphorae found at Rome, Heinrich Dressel created the typology that is still widely used. Further typological series have been devised for other volumes of the CIL and also for excavation reports, resulting in a multiplicity of names for amphora types. In the second half of the twentieth century, amphora studies came of age with a growing interest in economic questions, as these containers carried some of the most important products traded in antiquity and, unlike other kinds of pottery, were not traded in their own right. The AAR's amphora collection was never intended to illustrate the history, typology, or geo- graphic origins of ancient amphorae. It consists of three unequal parts that arose for different reasons and have different characteristics. One group includes 216 fragments of Dressel 20 amphorae of epigraphic interest, mosdy stamped handles. The second is a group of miscellaneous pieces, mostly epigraphic, acquired by the Academy at various times in differing ways. The third is made up of a half dozen amphorae of various types, which were mostly placed around the Academy courtyard as decorative antiquities. The Epigraphic Section Something more is known of the formation and history of the epigraphic section, which, unlike the decorative part of the collection, was obviously gathered together as a study collection in the true sense. An early handwritten volume, entitled American Academy in Rome. The Museum. Inventory of Acquisitions, records amphora handles and related material collected by A.W. Van Buren and others at Monte Testaccio ca. 1903. The inventory card file also states that most of the pieces came from the Testaccio, although a few have other provenances, sometimes being gifts from specified 1 For a general introduction to amphorae, see Peacock and Williams 1986, 20-29. 2 For a history of amphora studies, see Peacock and Williams 1986, 2-19.</page><page sequence="301">ROMAN AMPHORAE 289 individuals. Charlotte Perry Ludlum, a student of the AAR in 1932-1933, 3 published the first study of the epigraphic material. The introduction to her publication says that a small collection of pieces from the Testaccio was formed at the American School of Classical Studies in 1904 and following years, with occasional additions thereafter.4 According to Ludlum the collection held 191 items, the subject of her work. Her catalogue does not include a number of the miscellaneous pieces, aside from stamped amphora handles. Six amphora handles stamped in Greek that she does publish were not counted among the 191 she cites, while some of the published pieces are no longer in the collection. In the offprint of Ludlum s article kept in the Academy's Archaeology Laboratory, 38 are marked as "discarded," without indicating by whose order or when, while the relevant entries in the handwritten inventory are simply crossed out. Epigraphy on Dressel 20 Amphorae This group consists almost exclusively of pieces from the Testaccio, the artificial hill in the south- ern part of Rome not far from the Tiber made up overwhelmingly of Dressel 20 amphorae.5 They were involved in the massive movement of olive oil from Hispania Baetica (southern Spain) to the capital that was promoted by the annona , a sort of state welfare system, between the first and the third centuries. Upon their arrival the amphorae were emptied of their contents and discarded in an organized way, resulting in the formation of the artificial hill, named the "Pottery Hill," from Latin testa, "pot," or "piece of broken pottery." The epigraphy of Dressel 20 amphorae is very complex, with stamps placed on the handles before firing, and therefore concerning the vessel itself, as well as control marks pertaining to the contents, added at various points to the vessels in the course of their travel from Spain to Rome. The Academy's collection contains mostly examples of stamps impressed on the handles before firing, which give personal or place names. These are generally interpreted as information on the ownership or location of the workshop responsible for making the amphorae. An alternative explanation, that the personal names refer to potters, can be excluded with certainty in some cases - for example, with the names of emperors - and is thus unlikely in the others. As the epigraphic material in question comes from stamps, it is serial in nature - that is, there should always be multiple examples of stamps. Working with them consists of identifying them in standard works and studying the geographical and chronological patterns of their distribution. In this case the opportunity to associate the finds from the Testaccio with their known places of manufacture in Baetica is one of the most exciting features of such pottery studies. Thanks to the results of surveys conducted in the valley of the Guadalquivir, where concentrations of workshop debris, including stamps, have been found, it is now usually possible to indicate the origin of the pieces quite precisely. The fact that the Academy collection includes not only well-impressed, whole stamps but also fragmentary or smeared ones that are more difficult to read actually gives a more accurate idea of what an excavator is likely to find than a collection of more select items. The simplest name stamps merely indicate a Roman tria nomina formula, with praenomen , nomen , and gentilicium. • L.I.T (Callender 878) makes abbreviated reference to an unknown tria nomina formula. We know that the production site was located at the Cortijo del Alamo Alto near La Campana and operated in the second half of the second century.6 At the present time 3 1 thank Katherine A.

The production site appears to have been located at El Castillejo.12 This stamp was found at the Testaccio in contexts dated 220-224. In the Study Collection this stamp is attested on inv. no. 1139, figure 8.3.2.4: at the Testaccio, Callender 1059 appears on the same amphora as the stamp pnn (Callender 1358), recording an unknown tria nomina formula, which comes from the same production center.13 The Study Collection included nine examples of Callender 1358, although seven are no longer in the collection (preserved: inv. nos. 1011, 1014 [fig. 8.3.2.5]; discarded: 948, 1036, 1051, 1112, 1143, 1147, 1164). Dressel 20 amphorae are occasionally stamped elsewhere than the handle. As with handle stamps, both personal names and toponyms appear. • One that was gathered at the Testaccio (inv. no. 1170; fig. 8.3.2.6) is stamped secvndi in a rectangle. That name appears under Callender 1590; his illustration at fig. 16.45 is not dissimilar to the AAR's example. The Study Collection also holds several inscribed Dressel 20 fragments that are outside the normal range of epigraphy on containers of this sort. The most curious item is an unpublished body sherd (inv. no. 891; fig. 8.3.2.7) with a retrograde stamp on the inside; it appears to read mstcpc, an abbreviation that is not immediately identifi- able. The most likely explanation is that the potter used a stamped handle fragment in shaping the container and inadvertently left the impression.14 There are also prefiring graffiti incised on the outside of body sherds.15 According to Ludlum, two graffiti (inv. nos. 927, 929; figs. 8.3.2.8-9) written around the base read: Ianuari vale. A third, written vertically up a body sherd (inv. no. 928; fig. 8.3.2.10) she interprets as: [F]irmo(rum). 12 Ponsich 1974, 155-168. 13 Remesal Rodriguez 2001, 232-235. 14 I thank Jaap van der Werff for this suggestion and the reference to a similar case: Paunier 1981, no. 482, 243. 15 Ludlum 1938, 19.</page><page sequence="304">292 ARCHER MARTIN Fig. 8.3.2.11.

Miscellaneous Items Most, although not all, of the miscellaneous items in the amphora section of the Academy Study Collection are epigraphic. Among the miscellaneous items, a group of five stamped Rhodian amphora handles is particu- larly noteworthy. Four are recorded in the inventory as gifts of Richard Norton (three as acquired in Egypt and the fourth at Rhodes), while the fifth handle is marked as coming from Taormina. Rhodian amphorae are wine containers that have a long history - from the early Hellenistic period to the early second century A.D. - during which we can follow their typological development.16 During the Hellenistic period, Rhodian amphorae regularly bore stamps on their handles, giving complementary information - typically the indication of an eponym, the official after whom a year is named, and of a month on one handle and of a fabricant on the other, possibly with a month as well. Rhodian stamps have been grouped by scholars into seven periods (I-VII), whose absolute dating is currently the subject of debate.17 • A round stamp reading enC Ap^iXaTSou navánou around a rose (inv. no. 530; fig. 8.3.2.1 1) 18 gives an eponym with a month. This eponym belongs to Period III and dates to ca. 165-163 according to the revised chronology (182-176 or 177 according to older studies).19 Stamps are not frequent on African amphorae. When they do occur, it is usually in a different form from stamps elsewhere: instead of presenting an impressed frame inside which the letters are raised, the letters on African stamps are impressed directly into the body of the amphorae without a frame. There are three examples of such stamps in the AAR collection, all registered as belonging to the Ashby gift. • One (inv. no. 1513; fig. 8.3 .2. 12)20 reads: top / hcol.

Two others are recomposed from pieces that belong together, once using metal clamps and cement and the other time with cement. A third piece, lacking a handle and part of the rim, has an integration in cement. Finally, one piece was a pastiche made up of a body, a spike of a different vessel of a similar type, and a rim that is not pertinent, even typologically, to the rest - all held together with great quantities of cement and wire. Apparently little or no thought was given to making a representative collection of amphorae types or even, in the case of the pastiche, to having a plausible object. Undoubtedly these amphorae were acquired as decorative pieces, which is what they still are today. Among these decorative pieces, the Dressel 20 amphora (inv. no. 9477; fig. 8.3.2.13) is especially interesting for us because, although it does not itself present a potter s stamp on the handles, it represents the type to which so many handles and other fragments from the Testaccio belong.22 It is reconstructed from three pieces: the main piece, consisting of a part of the rim and most of the body; a rim fragment glued to the first; and a base fragment with some of the lower body, which is fixed to the main piece with lead clamps. This type of globular amphora served, as we have seen, for the transport of olive oil from the valley of the Guadalquivir and its tributaries in the province of Baetica. It was produced from the reign of Tiberius until the third or fourth century. Specific examples can be dated more closely on the basis of the shape of the rim - in the case of the Acad- emy's amphora, to the middle years of the first century.23 22 For this type, see Peacock and Williams 1986, 136-140. 23 Peacock and Williams 1986, fig. 63.8.</page><page sequence="306">294 ARCHER MARTIN Addendum Amphora stamps discarded since the publication of Charlotte P.

Terra Sigillata and Related Wares Archer Martín This sigillata" part of is the a Latin Study term Collection that was is dedicated coined in to modern Roman times fine tableware to indicate and vessels related decorated vessels. "Terra with sigillata" is a Latin term that was coined in modern times to indicate vessels decorated with relief obtained from molds in which motifs were stamped with dies ("sigilla"). These vessels had a distinctive glossy red coating. Subsequently, the term was extended to include not only the relief- decorated products but also the wheel-made plain vessels (the majority) with a glossy red coating from similar workshops; these are in fact the majority of the terra sigillata examples. Thus, the term has come to cover a tradition that began in Italy in the first century B.c. and lasted in the Mediter- ranean until the seventh. The dominant ware of the later centuries is more often called "African red-slip ware" in English, unlike Continental languages, in which "sigillata" prevails. Most of the Study Collection s sigillata was published in 19291 by Howard Comfort, FAAR '29, who was later the coauthor of the standard reference work on Italian sigillata stamps.2 Com- fort made some further comments on this part of the collection in 19563 and gathered what little information is known about its origin. The epigraphic nucleus was acquired in the 1920s from the widow of George Olcott, a professor at Columbia University. Other pieces were added at various times, by way of donations by Thomas Ashby and others. These donations account for almost all the non-epigraphic Italian material and for the sigillata from elsewhere than Italy. Although this section of the collection consists largely of stamped Italian sigillata, its interest goes well beyond that group. It illustrates various aspects of Italian sigillata, including molds used to make classic relief-decorated pieces. A certain number of fragments show something of the range of relief-decorated South Gaulish sigillata. Other wares, such as Calene black-gloss ware and African red-slip and cooking wares are represented to a limited extent. Italian Sigillata 4 This sort of fine ware was long known as Arretine ware, from the name of the production center famous already in antiquity. In more recent decades the term "Italian sigillata" has found favor and reflects the multiplicity of production centers, although some continue to prefer the older conventional name. The term "sigillata made in the Italian manner" is even more accurate because it takes into account the production by branch workshops in provincial centers, but it has not gained wide acceptance. The initial date for this class and the influences behind its creation have long been debated.5 One side in the debate saw the essential inspiration for Italian sigillata in the tradition of Eastern Sigillata 1 Comfort 1929. 2OCK. 3 Comfort 1956. More recently, in 1999, Dylan Bloy, FAAR at the time, to whom we wish to express our gratitude, made a further inventory of the stamped Italian sigillata. This and Comfort's publications constitute the basis for the general organization of those items. 4 For overviews, see Roca Roumens and Garcia 2005, Passelac 1993, and Pucci 1985, especially for the history of the study of the class. The Conspectus , which presents both introduc- tory material and the most widely used typology today, is conventionally indicated with Consp. 5 See Pedroni 1995, 196 for a brief history of the debate.</page><page sequence="308">296 ARCHER MARTIN A and favored a date after the batde of Actium, when slave artisans could have been brought to Italy as booty from the East. The other, emphasizing connections in morphology and typology, thought that Italian sigillata derived from Italian black-gloss ware somewhat earlier, following a period of local experimentation. In recent decades, the consensus has formed that Italian sigillata grew es- sentially out of the black-gloss tradition of northern Etruria and in particular of Arezzo (although there may have been some influence from Eastern Sigillata A) and that it appeared during the third quarter of the first century. The most interesting proposal to modify this consensus, and suggesting that production began ca. 60 B.c.,6 is based on a prosopographical and historical discussion of the first name stamps on Italian sigillata at Arezzo. As it depends closely on historical events at Arezzo, this hypothesis is not applicable to the initial date of sigillata production elsewhere in Italy, and it must be said that it has not gained approval in any case.7 The subsequent history of the ware is not controversial. Italian sigillata developed further during the reigns of Augustus and Tiberius and continued to be produced until the middle of the second century. The first period saw the elaboration of a number of plate and cup forms. During this time, stamps with potters' names evolved from radial square ones (which had appeared even before the reign of Augustus) to central, mostly rectangular ones and then ca. A.D. 15 to central stamps in planta pedis - that is, in the shape of a footprint. The Augustan-Tiberian period was also the time when classical relief ware was produced. From the middle of the first century, the repertory of types was reduced almost exclusively to a cup and a dish, to which was added a new relief-decorated bowl in the last decades of the century. Central stamps in planta pedis continued to be the rule, although central stamps in lunula , a new sort, appeared on the relief-decorated bowls and sometimes on plain ware. The practice of stamping some of the vessels gives us an insight into the structure of Italian sigillata production.8 Because of the frequent presence of slave names, it has been suggested that Italian sigillata production constitutes a parallel with slave labor organized in manufactories to the slave-run villas of the Tyrrhenian central Italy, which produced commercial crops for export, principally wine and also olive oil. Furthermore, Italian sigillata may have declined along with the villas for similar reasons, in particular expansion of the productive units beyond the optimal scale. Stamped Italian Sigillata The epigraphy of Italian sigillata has developed into a specialized field with its own corpus, as has been noted.9 Stamps were placed on the interior of plates and cups, while some were included in the decorative field of molds. The shape and position of stamps and their texts supply information useful for dating vessels since most stamps can be associated with production centers or regions and therefore indicate the provenances of the vessels on which they appear. Some aspects of stamping Italian sigillata still remain unclear. What, for instance, did it mean for the ancients - were stamps a means for control within the workshop? Were they trademarks for sales promotion? And why were not all vessels stamped? Normally, but not always, stamps give personal names. It is possible that they could sometimes mean the landowners on whose properties the workshops were located. They are, however, usually 6 Pedroni 1995, 198-204. 7 E.g., Hayes 2008, 42 still favors an initial date of 40-30 B.c., and OCK have the name stamps in question starting at 40 (OCK 2000, 51, 1872, 2274, 2275). Porten Palange 2009, 32-33 , who considers that the production of relief ware began ca. 30 and of plain ware somewhat earlier, cites Pedroni 1995 without explicitly endorsing his position. 8 Pucci 1973; 1981; Carandini and Sagùi 1981.

When there is only one name, it is to be suspected that the head or owner of a workshop is intended. In other cases the information is more specific - for example, the name of a slave (presumably belonging to the owner of the workshop), who could have been responsible for some aspect of production. One explanation for the lack of stamps on some vessels has to do with workshop management: the top vessel in a stack could have been stamped to indicate the provenance of the entire stack, as a useful system for keeping track of separate lots in firings by multiple potters in a single kiln. The position and shape of the stamps are of chronological significance in themselves. The earliest stamps in the first century B.c., especially on large plates and platters, were placed radially. During the Augustan period it became usual for single stamps to be placed in the center. Until ca. A.D. 15 quite a range of square, rectangular, and round stamps was used. Then the imprint of a right foot ( planta pedis) became almost the only shape used until the end of Italian sigillata production in the mid-second century. The main exception is the crescent moon ( lunula ), which appears on some of the later vessels, particularly decorated ones. Comfort was convinced that the nucleus of the Academy's collection and Columbia's Olcott Collection, as well as several others, came from the same source, Rome or its environs, about the beginning of the twentieth century.10 Comfort notes the characteristics of the Olcott and related collections as a more or less exclusive orientation toward epigraphic material, the virtually perfect state of preservation of the stamps accompanied by an almost complete lack of profiles of the ves- sels, the inclusion of much non- Arretine Italian material along with a lack of late Italian or Gaulish signatures. The collection was evidently acquired to illustrate Italian sigillata epigraphy, which it does well for interior stamps on plain ware. There is an example of an early, radially stamped vessel. • OCK 1951.4 appears on a fragment attributable to Consp. B 1.4: hilar. / a.ses. / ser stamped radially in a square frame (inv. no. 8935.135; fig. 8.3 .3.1). 11 Hilarus, slave of A. Sestius Dama, was active between 30 and 10 B.c., probably at Arezzo.

Octavius Salutaris is known in central Italy in the late first century and the first half of the second. Graffiti on Italian Sigillata Although the stamps are obviously the reason behind the creation of the main nucleus of Italian sigillata in the collection, epigraphy in the form of graffiti written after firing of the vessels is also present in some cases. This is a well-known phenomenon on ancient pottery, which has usually received litde more than a mention.15 On sigillata, graffiti are normally interpreted as indications 13 Comfort 1929, 187, no. 6. 14 Comfort 1929, 204, no. 99. 15 Kiitter 2008, 10-12 traces a history of the study of graffiti (essentially dealing with the German-speaking area).</page><page sequence="311">TERRA SIGILLATA AND RELATED WARES 299 of the owners or habitual users of the vessels in communal situations such as military contexts, with the evident intention of allowing easy recognition.16 Therefore such graffiti tend to be on the outside of the vessel, within the foot-ring or around it, because the vessels were stored stood on edge with the rim toward the wall. The graffiti can be full or abbreviated names, single letters, or a mark, such as an X. • FAVSTi written on a Consp. B 3.12 base inside the foot-ring (inv. no. 8935.149; fig. 8.3.3.5) is an excellent example of a name in the genitive, indicating possession. Molds for Italian Sigillata Among the non-epigraphic Italian material in the collection, four pieces of Arretine molds are particularly noteworthy. The inventory gives no indication of when or how the Academy acquired them, although Comfort's words in 1956, "the American Academy's collection now contains four fragmentary moulds," suggest that they entered the collection after his original article,17 and they indeed bear the inventory number 1647 (with the subnumbers 1-4) used for subsequent acquisi- tions of sigillata. At the end of the 1980s and beginning of the 1990s, a series of articles showing that a large number of supposed Arretine molds in various museums in Europe and America were fakes shocked the scholars of the subject.18 We must ask ourselves, therefore, whether the pieces in the Study Collection are also falsifications. Seven criteria are indicated for recognizing fake molds, of which one (false and dubious as- sociations of name stamps) does not apply to the AAR's fragments.19 • Impression without previous smoothing of the mold. There are no wheel marks to be seen on the inside of the fragments. The fragment inv. no. 1647.4, figure 8.3.3.9, presents an especially smooth surface. • Details in the execution of grooves and rows of leaves. There is no sign of an underlying guide-line on the Academy's pieces that present barbed wreaths under the rim (inv. nos. 1647.2 [fig. 8.3.3.7] and 1647.3 [fig. 8.3.3.8]). • Shallower impressions than usual on Arretine vessels. Fragments inv. nos. 1647.1 (fig. 8.3.3.6), and 1647.4 (fig. 8.3.3.9) are deeply impressed, and fragments inv. nos. 1647.2 and 1647.3 (figs. 8.3.3.7 and 8) are relatively deeply impressed. • False combinations of secondary motifs and false freehand ornaments. There is little on our pieces by which to judge for this criterion. • Decoration all the way to the center of the base. On the only fragment that preserves part of the base (inv. no. 1647.4; fig. 8.3.3.9) this does not occur. • Course of the breaks. The fakes are mostly complete, possibly with some chipping, or present vertical breaks, often touching figurai motifs only marginally. On the AAR pieces the breaks are more irregular and run through the figurai motifs where they are present (inv. no. 1647.1 and 1647.2; figs. 8.3.3.6 and 7). It can be concluded that the mold fragments in the AAR Study Collection are genuine.20 16 Visy 1991, 41; Kütter 2008, 40. 17 Comfort 1956, 49. 18 See, in particular, Porten Palange 1990 [1995] and also Porten Palange 1992. 19 Porten Palange 1990 [1995], 555-562. 20 1 am very grateful to Dr. Francesca Paola Porten Palange, who confirms that the AAR pieces are undoubtedly ancient.</page><page sequence="312">300 ARCHER MARTIN Fig. 8.3.3.6 (near right).

It is now possible to make more precise attributions in some cases.21 One piece belongs to the first phase of the Perennius workshop rather than to the second under Tigranus,22 one of the most important and the first to start production (first phase ca. 30-15 B.c.).23 • Inv. no. 1647.1 (fig. 8.3 .3 .6) presents an erotic scene under an upper delimitation of ovoli.24 The former can be identified with the figure-type Sy 6a used in the first three phases of the Perennius workshop.23 The ovoli may now be identified with a type that belongs to the first phase of the workshop.26 A second piece was also produced in the Perennius workshop, in its second phase (ca. 15 B.C.- A.D. 10) under M. Perennius Tigranus.27 • Inv. no. 1647.2 (fig. 8.3.3.7) shows Cupid driving a chariot, followed by another chariot, under a stylized wreath and an upper limit of beads.28 The horses are figure-type T/Equidae re 18, 29 while the Cupid is EP re 48.30 In spite of Comfort s preference for M.

Ateius's workshop, the cause being the narrowness of the vessels, which did not allow a proper smoothing of the interior.46 Late Italian Decorated Sigillata Late Italian sigillata decorated with mold-made relief is often considered separately from the main body of Italian sigillata.47 This is perhaps the result of the history of study, in that it was recognized as being of a relatively late date at a time when the production of plain Italian sigillata was thought to end before the middle of the first century A.D. The production of late decorated vessels lasted from ca. A.D. 80 to the middle of the second century.48 The initial date is deduced from their absence in contexts buried by the eruption of Vesuvius in A.D. 79 and their frequency in Domitianic contexts at Ostia. Arguments in favor of the final date toward the middle of the second century are the appearance of a portrait of the empress Sabina derived from a coin (a.D. 128-137) on a piece from Cosa and the continued frequency of these vessels in mid-century contexts but not beyond. Late decorated Italian sigillata presents a limited range of forms.49 The large carinated bowl Dra- gendorff 29 is often said to be the only type in this group. It must be admitted that this form, for which a typological articulation can be established, accounts for the overwhelming majority of the vessels attested. There are, however, also some early examples of a calyx form and several hemispherical bowls. Potters' stamps on late Italian decorated vessels document few potters - attested are ten names (five with the gentilicium Murrius) and two anepigraphic stamps.50 The appearance of more than one name on single vessels suggested that the Murrii were associated in their work, a hypothesis that has been confirmed by more recent evidence.51 It was long thought that these vessels were produced in northern maritime Etruria, with the territory Pisa as the most likely candidate.52 This hypothesis has been proved by discoveries there, particularly at Isola di Migliarino just to the north of the city, where L. Rasinius Pisanus, C.P() Pi(sanus), L. Nonius Flor(entius), and the Murrii are attested.53 The market for decorated late Italian sigillata was rather restricted;54 examples are found par- ticularly along the Tyrrhenian coast of Italy from Etruria to Campania and the immediate hinterland, with occasional attestations in neighboring provinces. There are three examples of decorated late Italian sigillata in the Academy's Study Collection, all belonging to Dragendorff 29 - a rim sherd with a part of the decoration and two base sherds with stamps but no preserved decoration. • The two stamps on Dragendorff 29 bowls can be attributed to L. Rasinus Pisanus (OCK 1690), whose workshop was located at Pisa55 and was active from 50 to 120.

Applied Relief Decoration Applied relief motifs offered a simpler way of obtaining relief decoration than molds.57 These motifs were made separately in plaques stamped with dies and then fixed to wheel-made plain vessels. This practice was particularly common during the second and third quarters of the first century a.D. but began as early as the late Augustan period and lasted into the second century. The motifs range from double spirals (the earliest) to rosettes and human and animal figures. • A Consp. 20.3^4 plate is decorated with an applied relief of a dolphin (inv. no. 8778.12; fig. 8.3 .3. 14).58 Other Wares Although the vast majority of this part of the Study Collection consists of Italian sigillata, particularly of stamped plain vessels, other wares are included. Calene Black-gloss Ware The oldest piece belongs to Calene black-gloss ware with relief decoration.59 This is a ware with Hellenistic characteristics, for which the intervention of slave handicraftsmen from Magna Grecia has been supposed.60 Calene black-gloss relief vessels are normally dated between ca. 250 b.c. and ca. 180, 61 although it has been proposed recently to raise the date range to ca. 275-200 B.c.62 One of the characteristics of Calene ware in this period is the use of Latin name stamps, while the relief ware privileges forms that allow the use of medallions.63 56 Comfort 1929, 208, no. 122, found at Ostia and presented by Donald S.

It bears a fragmentary stamp, which Ashby read as "[NJaivios" or "Alvios," a reading ac- cepted in the CIL I2, 417. The correct reading, however, is undoubtedly "Atilios," although the T is very faint.65 The only decoration that survives shows the middle part of a seated draped figure holding a staff, identified as Aphrodite or Venus with Eros.66 South Gaulish Sigillata67 South Gaulish sigillata production began in the Augustan period, not as one might expect as an outgrowth of the Italian branch workshop at Lyon-La Muette but rather as an independent phe- nomenon, and was widely distributed by the Tiberian period.68 Production declined in the later first century and ended by ca. 150.69 The potters, to judge by their stamps and also by the graffiti with accounts that have been found at the major production center of La Graufesenque near the modern-day Millau, were for the most part free, noncitizen craftsmen who probably farmed part- time and thus were well integrated into the local society. 64 Ashby 1902, 173 (with photograph in fig. 5). 65 Pagenstecher 1909, 56, 59b; Pedroni 2001, 65. 66 Pagenstecher 1909, 56, 59b; Pedroni 2001, 65. 67 The classic account of Gaulish sigillata is Oswald and Pryce 1920; see also Webster 1996. 68 See Polak 2000, 33-36 for considerations on the rise of South Gaulish sigillata production. 69 See Polak 2000, 36-37 on the decline of South Gaulish sigillata production.</page><page sequence="317">TERRA SIGILLATA AND RELATED WARES 305 The market for South Gaulish sigillata was chiefly north of the Alps. Export to Tyrrhenian central Italy, always from La Graufesenque, was concentrated in the Claudian to Neronian periods, with a smaller amount arriving in the Vespasianic to Trajanic periods.70 The interest in this region was directed particularly toward vessels with relief decoration, on the one hand, and vessels with a marbled, yellow and red surface, on the other. Although the forms have their date ranges, usually the best chronological indications come from the decoration.71 The overall decorative scheme is one factor to consider. The earliest vessels (until the middle of the first century) present simple and repetitive vegetal decorations in zones. At midcentury these give way to more elaborate but still plant-based schemes, and at the same time animal and human figures begin to appear as fillers. On vessels of Neronian to Vespasianic date the characteristic arrangement is in panels, allowing for a larger use of figures. Later examples of decorated South Gaulish sigillata may continue to use panels, but a free style is also developed, using the entire decorated space. Figure types used on South Gaulish sigillata, which can be dated direcdy by find contexts or through the potters' names found associated with them on vessels, have also been collected.72 Certain details can be of chronological importance: for example, the use of beaded or wavy lines to divide metopes and zones, etc. - the former giving way to the latter by ca. A.D. 50.73 South Gaulish vessels sometimes bear potters' stamps.74 The reasons for their existence are presumably the same as with Italian sigillata. South Gaulish stamps differ from Italian ones in their shape, which is an elongated oblong cartouche. They also present different formulations from Italian stamps, officina variously abbreviated (= "workshop") plus a name in the genitive, a very frequent formula at La Graufesenque, is perhaps the indication of a large workshop. A name in the nominative plus fecit (= made), also possibly abbreviated, often appears and may indicate a smaller operation. It is less easy to attribute manu (= "by the hand [of]"), plus a name in the genitive, and simple names in the nominative or genitive refer to different sorts of operation. The Study Collec- tion contains two South Gaulish stamps, both on Dragendorff 29 vessels - one belonging to the group with the indication officina and the other bearing a simple name. The carinated bowl with relief decoration Dragendorff 29 began to be produced in the Tiberian period and lasted until ca. 85 .75 It is the major decorated form during the earlier part of the South Gaulish sigillata production. • One sherd preserves both a stamp and a small part of the decoration (inv. no. 1647.45; fig. 8.3.3.16a-b). The stamp belongs to the group of simple names.76 The surface of the vessel is not well preserved, and the stamp was probably never clear, especially at the end. Comfort's reading of ivcvnd is, nevertheless, certainly correct. At La Graufesenque, Iucundus, which may belong to more than one potter, is a well-known name from the time of Claudius to the Flavians.77 A scroll filled with imbrication underneath the curve, a decoration that appears frequently on vessels of Neronian and Flavian date, is preserved in the lower zone. 70 For South Gaulish sigillata in this region, see Martin 1985; 1994. 71 Webster 1996, 74-81. 72 Oswald 1936-1937. 73 Balsan and Vernhet 1971, 92. 74 Webster 1996, 7-9 and Polak 2000, 39-42 give overviews. 75 Webster 1996, 40-41. 76 Comfort 1929, 199, no. 72; Comfort 1956, 56, no. 45, found at Anzio and donated by Thomas Ashby. 77 Oswald 1931, 148-149, 192; Polak 2000, 242-244.</page><page sequence="318">306 ARCHER MARTIN Fig. 8.3.3.17 (near right).

Dragendorff 30, a cylindrical cup with relief decoration, is a type made throughout the entire period of South Gaulish sigillata production.78 • A rim sherd (inv. no. 1647.47; fig. 8.3.3.17) belongs to this kind of cup.79 The upper limit of the decoration is, as always with this form, a row of ovoli. It is interesting to note that a wheel mark from the fashioning of the rim above the mold-made part cuts across the top of them. Below the ovoli are panels made of wavy lines. Two smaller panels, one above the other, present respectively a lion to the left with a large upright leaf and a central patch of imbrications flanked by wavy diagonal lines. A larger panel contains a medallion with an unidentifiable figure, surrounded by filling elements. Dragendorff 37, a hemispherical cup with relief decoration, began to be made ca. A.D. 70 and lasted until the end of South Gaulish sigillata production.80 It replaced Dragendorff 29 as the main decorated form. • Dragendorff 37 is represented in the Study Collection by a base sherd (inv. no. 1647.48; fig. 8.3. 3. 18).81 The preserved decoration consists of a basal wreath and a narrow frieze above that, of which two panels remain, one with imbrication and the other with a dog chasing a rabbit. A wider frieze, which undoubtedly was the main one, contains a series of garlands with unidentifiable figures (perhaps birds) above them. African Red-slip Ware The affirmation of African red-slip ware marks a great shift in ceramological terms.82 In the Augustan period central Italy was able to export large quantities of fine table ware to most of the Roman Em- pire and beyond and to provide the model to be imitated. By the late first century African products were becoming important in the Italian home market, eventually supplanting Italian sigillata there and throughout the Mediterranean.83 Now it was Africa that gave the model for regional wares elsewhere in the Roman world until the seventh century.84 78 Webster 1996, 42-43. 79 Comfort 1956, 56, no. 47, found at Ostia. 80 Webster 1996, 47-48. 81 Comfort 1956, 56, no. 48, registered as coming from "Ro- man Britain" and as a possible gift from Ashby. 82 See Carandini and Sagùi 1981 and Bonifay 2004, 45 for the history of African red-slip ware and its study. 83 Martin 1992a; 2006 traces the evolution in fine-ware supply to Rome and Ostia, from the overwhelming dominance of Italian sigillata to that of African red-slip ware.

In the traditional view, African red-slip ware is thought to owe its success to a connection with the trade in African olive oil85 and to benefit from the use of left-over space in shipping.86 A recent examination of the evidence87 casts some doubt on each of these elements because African red- slip ware is much more common in the eastern Mediterranean, for example, than African amphorae, sug- gesting that it was traded in its own right, and because there are now indications of the importance of other products as the contents of African amphorae. Furthermore, at least some significant centers of red-slip ware production do not coincide with oil-producing regions, leading to the hypothesis that the diffusion of African red-slip ware may have benefited more from the grain trade, for instance. African red-slip ware began with Production A.88 Traditionally it has been considered the product of workshops located in the region of Carthage, although there is no archaeological evi- dence confirming this, and various parts of northern and central Tunisia and even Algeria have been suggested instead. Production Al, with a relatively fine fabric and slip datable between the late first century and the mid- second,89 is the earliest form of Production A. Steady exports of African red-slip ware were known in Italy from the time of Domitian, increasing under Trajan and Hadrian. Then from the Antonine period on it dominated the Italian and other western Mediterranean markets completely with highly standardized products. Sometime in the second half of the second century, Production A appears with the intermediate Fabric Al-2. Production A survived from the late second century into the third and perhaps even beyond with the rougher and duller Fabric A2. Production A is the best represented African ware in the Study Collection, with four pieces. • Two examples of Hayes 8 bowls show the evolution in the shape of this carinated bowl and of the Production A ware.90 These are Hayes 8A/ Lamboglia la in Production Al (inv. no. 521; fig. 8.3 .3. 19), 91 and Hayes 8B/ Lamboglia le, in Production A 2 (inv. no. 8936; fig. 8.3 .3 .20). 92 The former, with a rounded molding with rouletting on the exterior of the rim, is the earliest version of the shape, datable from ca. A.D. 90 to the mid-second century. The latter, with an angular molding without rouletting, is the latest version, datable to the third century. 85 Carandini 1969-1970; Carandini and Sagùi 1981, 13. 86 Carandini 1969-1970, 104-103. 87 Bonifay 2004, 463-480, also 488 for the overestimation of the importance of oil. 88 For a discussion of the categories of African red-slip ware, see Bonifay 2004, 43-53. 89 See Carandini and Tortorella 1981a, 19 for the distinction of the fabrics of Production A. 90 Carandini and Tortorella 1981a, 26-27 ; Bonifay 2004, 156. 91 Given by Richard Norton, with no indication of prov- enance. 92 With the provenance recorded as "Sardinia SM di Napoli.

African red-slip ware D1 with stamped decoration (inv. no. 1309). It has long been recognized that Production C, articulated into five subgroups (Cl-5) in rough chronological succession, comes from central Tunisia.93 Its production begins ca. A.D. 200 and lasts until the mid-sixth century. Some pieces have applied decoration on the rims or the interior of open vessels or on the exterior of closed forms. • Two fragments of a single vessel in Production C2 have applied relief decoration (inv. no. 520 and 520a; fig. 8.3 .3 .2 1).94 One piece (inv. no. 520) presents a lion to the left (motif 60) similar to Atlante Í, LXXXIII. 1295 and a fir tree (motif 39);% the other shows a goat to the right (motif 55). 97 It is not easy to place the vessel typologically. It is clearly related to the plate with applied relief decoration Hayes 5 1 A, which, however, is in Production C3 and dat- able to the early or mid-fourth century.98 A similar form in Cl and C2 without applied relief decoration, Hayes 45, whose closest variant to the vessel in the Study Collection is Atlante I, XXVIII.7, is considered to be probably a local product of Raqqada that was not exported.99 Production D presents similarities in fabric with Production A.100 The hypothesis of its origin in northern Tunisia has found confirmation with the identification of workshop sites in the valleys of the Mejerda and Miliane, which, however, show no continuity with Production A. Others await discovery, as there are vessels that cannot be assigned to the centers already identified. Unfortu- nately, the articulation of Production D into D1 and D2, elaborated on consumption sites, appears not to translate well into the African reality and will undoubtedly be superseded as research there proceeds. The vessels grouped together as Production D range in date from the beginning of the fourth century to the middle of the seventh. Production D often presents stamped decoration on the inside of the bases.101 This can be divided into five styles (A-E) on the basis of the nature, size, and disposition of the motifs. • There is an unidentifiable base fragment in Production D1 with a part of a stamped decoration (inv. no. 1509; fig. 8.3 .3 .22). 102 What is preserved shows rosettes framed by a 93 Carandini and Sagui 1981, 18-20; Bonifay 2004, 50-51. 94 Donated by Richard Norton, without indication of provenance. 95 Sagui and Tortorici 1981, 169. 96 Sagui and Tortorici 1981, 168. 97 Sagui and Tortorici 1981, 169.

African Cooking Ware Cooking ware is, of course, not used at the table. Nevertheless, in the case of African red-slip ware and African cooking ware there are connections.103 African cooking ware can usefully be articu- lated into three categories: (A) vessels related to Production A of African red-slip ware (often with a slip on the inside similar to that of Production A), considered to be from northern Tunisia; (B) vessels "a politura a strisce" (with striped burnishing), from farther south and along the eastern coast; (C) vessels "a patina cenerognola e ad orlo annerito" (with an ashen patina and blackened rim) or black-top ware, made throughout the country in open firings.104 The last category includes vessels associated with category A from northern workshops (C/A), as well as those associated with category B (C/B), and others besides. African cooking ware was exported to various parts of the western Mediterranean from the first century a.D. to the fifth and beyond.105 • A vessel that is complete, aside from some chipping on the rim, can be placed in category A, as it is slipped on the inside and on the upper part of the exterior (inv. no. 359; fig. 8.3 .3 .23). 106 Its round profile with a flat base set off by a groove on the inside means that it can be compared to Lamboglia 9 A = Bonifay Type 3B, which is datable from the end of the second century to perhaps the mid-fourth.107 It is noteworthy in presenting a sort of foot in the form of a raised band at the junction of the base and wall. Some faint grooving on the underside of the base recalls Bonifay Type 3 A of the beginning of the second century, suggesting that this may be an early variant of Bonifay Type 3B. • A nearly complete, mendable vessel (inv. no. 358; fig. 8.3 .3 .24)108 is an example of the lid Ostia I, 264 = Bonifay Type 12. 109 This lid can be assigned to the A/C category, and thus 103 Hayes 1972 included cooking- ware forms in his typology, otherwise dedicated to African red-slip ware, and Tortorella 1981b included them in a publication on African and other fine wares. 104 Bonifay 2004, 67, 211, 213, 221. 105 Tortorella 1981b, 210-211. 106 Donated by Richard Norton, without indication of provenance. 107 Tortorella 1981b, 213; Bonifay 2004, 211-213. 108 Registered as coming from Tabessa and given by Norton. 109 Tortorella 1981b, 214; Bonifay 2004, 227.</page><page sequence="322">310 ARCHER MARTIN to northern Tunisia.

Other Roman Ware Eric C. De Sena The Republican AAR collection period includes and Late 53 Antiquity. examples There of Roman are examples pottery that of African can be dated red-slip between ware, African the late Republican period and Late Antiquity. There are examples of African red-slip ware, African cookware, Italian red-slip cookware, and glazed wares. Much of this group consists of Italian "com- mon ware," namely pottery manufactured for regional consumption.1 This section presents a sample of the wares represented from the collection. Inv. no. 1821 (fig. 8.3.4.1) is an unguentarium with an egg-shaped body and medium-sized neck with small protruding lip and pedestal base. The clay is very fine, pale reddish brown and well fired. Much of the body is coated by a motded, reddish-brown slip consistent with the late phase of black gloss production (early-mid first century B.c.). These unguentaria were very common items in the Hellenistic and early Imperial periods. Although the provenance of this example has not been recorded, the clay and slip recall west-central Italy, possibly Etruria. The jug inv. no. 355 (fig. 8.3.4.2), obtained by Richard Norton at Tebessa, is a fine example of North African common ware, a plain variety of pottery manufactured primarily for local consump- tion in Africa Proconsularis but also exported. This jug has a small, funnel-shaped mouth, a tall, slighdy bulbous neck, and a slighdy flattened globular body. The base is flat, with a groove around the outer edge; there is a sharply bent strap handle with three shallow grooves attached to the neck and shoulder of the vessel. The clay is characteristically red, with limestone and quartz inclusions. The surface is coated by a thick pale gray encrustation of lime (?). Similar examples date to the late first and second centuries A.D.2 Also of North African production, inv. no. 6323 (fig. 8.3.4.3) is a Roman period biberon, a "baby bottle" or jug with a small spout on its shoulder.3 The body of the jug is biconical in shape, rising from a narrow ringed foot. The shoulder narrows to a long, cylindrical neck with two broad grooves that terminates with a flaring rim. There is a short spout on the shoulder and a thick handle on the opposite side of the vessel attached carelessly to the neck and shoulder. Comparable examples were manufactured between the fourth century B.c. and the second century A.D.4 Four exemplars presented here are of west-central Italian manufacture, possibly even Rome itself. Inv. no. 6327 (fig. 8.3.4.4) is a well-preserved cup that pertains to the realm of thin-walled ware. The cup has a simple everted rim, a globular body with grooves upon the lower half, an ear- shaped handle, and a flat base and can be dated to the first century A.D.5 The fine, pale brown clay and poorly preserved brown slip are consistent with west-central Italian production. Inv. no. 2148 (fig. 8.3.4.5) is a small cup with an unpronounced rim, tall body, and flat, pedestal base. The cup, added to the AAR collection by Esther Van Deman, may have been used as a spe- cialized drinking vessel or for the tossing of gaming dice. The clay is characteristically pale brown, and there are traces of a brownish slip. 1 For definitions of "common ware," see Vegas 1973; Dyson 1976; Olcese 1993; 2003; Pavolini 2000; De Sena 2002. 2 The jug shares formal attributes with examples 21, 23, and 25 in Pavolini 2000, 92-95 and Salomonson 1968, 130: Raqqada CC 10. 3 Compare example 137 in Pavolini 2000, 260. 4 Pavolini 2000, 257-258. 5 Akin to Atlante II, pareti sottili 268, Tipo 1/367.</page><page sequence="324">312 ERIC C.

The pot has an everted, convex lip, an onion-shaped body with broad horizontal grooves, and a small, flat base. There are three large holes in the lower body of the vessel and a single hole through the base, all of which were made prior to firing the vessel. Such flowerpots are generally found out of context; however, we understand that they were used to plant saplings, based upon evidence from the Canopus of Hadrian's Villa6 and other locations where vessels have been discovered in situ. There is ample evidence of such pottery production in Rome and its hinterland. The Oppius Restitutus family workshop, which manufactured common ware vessels and lamps, was located on the slopes of the Janiculum hill, along the Via XXX Aprile, just 500 m from the American Acad- emy.7 In this context, inv. no. 3492 (fig. 8.3.4.8) represents a pair of common ware cups that were fused together during firing. The cups have globular bodies, an everted rim, a flat base, and a pair of handles. They had been stacked one upon the other in a kiln, which is normal practice; however, this pair warped and fused together. We do not know the exact provenance of the AAR examples. Finally, inv. no. 8152a (fig. 8.3.4.9) is one of two examples of Late Roman glazed pottery in the AAR collection.

(inv. no. 8132b). and the Mediterranean in the fourth and fifth centuries A.D.8 This example consists of a hard, pale brown clay body and a bluish-green lead glaze. While most examples of this variety of pottery are unadorned, save the glaze and perhaps decorative molding, this example bears the figure of a danc- ing Maenad in relief. The Maenad stands with her left leg planted on the ground and her right leg lifted to the rear. Her posture is erect, and she faces left. Both hands are raised, holding her breasts. Her hair is gathered at the top of her head. The second example of glazed ware, inv. no. 8152b (fig. 8.3.4.10), also has a hard, pale brown fabric, but the glaze is a paler tone of green, and it may therefore not pertain to the same vessel as inv. no. 8152a. This fragment bears a representation of a nude standing male in three-quarters view, facing to the right. His left leg is planted on the ground, and the right leg is raised as if resting on a stool or rock. The bent left arm is held somewhat away from the body, while his right arm rests upon the right thigh. The fragment is broken at the level of the figures right thigh. The remaining examples in this category represent a variety of plates, cooking vessels, bowls, cups, pitchers, and other household items. 8 Various authors in Paroli 1992, esp.

The with first Italy item but is a that do not fall within the categories of impasto, bucchero, or votive pottery. The first item is a good example of the fourth-century B.c. Genucilia plates from Cerveteri (inv. no. 326, see fig. 8.2.54). The findspot for our example, however, is Corsica. It was a gift to the Academy by one of its charter members, the artist Waldo Story.1 There are a further four examples of undecorated small vases from Orvieto (a jug, inv. no. 346; fig. 8.3.5.1), two oenochoai (inv. nos. 347-348; figs. 8.3.5.2-3), and a jar (inv. no. 349; fig. 8.3.5.4) that fall under the classification of orange white ware, according to the original inventory cards. They came from the Charles collection.2 The jug, inv. no. 346, was probably known to many scholars of the American Academy because it was placed in Professor Frank Brown s office. A jar (inv. no. 6326) came from an unknown provenance and collection. The miniature jug, inv. no. 1634, originally belonged to the Ashby collection, together with a group of pottery sherds from Selinunte (inv. nos. 1363-1374), briefly described by Van Buren.3 A small oenochoe from Cyprus, inv. no. 221 (fig. 8.3.5.5) represents an Early Iron Age local fabric, sometimes classified as black bucchero ware.

De Sena and Paola Chini The implements American that Academy were assembled in Rome holds over a a roughly collection 40-year of 224 period, ancient between oil lamps the and early four twentieth related implements that were assembled over a roughly 40-year period, between the early twentieth century and the Second World War. The lamps were acquired through donations by a variety of scholars or their families: A. André, T. Ashby, A. M. Harmon, R. Norton, Mrs. G. H. Olcott, A. W. Van Buren, and E. B. Van Deman. The findspots of these lamps are generally unknown, except in the case of two lamps obtained by Harmon in Melos (inv. nos. 170 and 171), four lamps that Norton obtained in Ephesus (inv. nos. 4078, 194, 198, 197), three lamps that Norton obtained in Apollonia (inv. nos. 172, 173, 174), two lamp fragments that were excavated near Porta S. Pancrazio in 1935 (inv. nos. 117a-b), and eight lamps excavated in 1928 on the property of the American Academy in Rome itself (inv. nos. 748, 743, 746, 747, 754, 753, 750, 2055). Approximately one-third of the collection was purchased from two antiquities dealers in Rome between 1914 and 1925, Scalco (79 lamps) and "V" Roma (nine lamps).1 Several examples have been restored, generally by reassembling numerous fragments or, in some instances, by completely reconstructing the nozzle or handle. On many occasions the restor- ers chose to mask the repairs and/or additions by using similarly colored plaster and paint. In the case of multi-nozzled lamps where one or more nozzles were preserved, the artisan who performed the restoration mimicked the surviving nozzle(s). In the case of monolychnos lamps whose nozzles were no longer preserved, the early conservators used their personal knowledge of lamps to decide upon an appropriate form. In some instances the nozzle type conforms with the general class of lamps, while in other instances, the wrong type of nozzle was chosen for the intervention. Because lamps were popular items on antiquities markets, their appearance must have been very important in decisions to purchase such items; thus, many of the original and reconstructed nozzles were painted black in order to simulate burning, when actual carbonization was not evident. Only four of the lamps have been published previously, and a single article contains a brief description of these (inv. nos. 1993, 2009, 2022, 197).2 According to an unpublished manuscript composed by Van Buren, A. M. Harmon studied the first group of 37 lamps that formed the basis of the Academy's collection in 1906. After the acquisition of the so-called Scalco lamps in 1916, E. L. Chubb studied the collection during her fellowship year in 1920-1921. 3 By the early 1930s the study of the collection fell to A. W. Van Buren, who prepared an impressive manuscript that was to be published with the names of all three scholars (E. L. Chubb, A. M. Harmon, and A. W. Van Buren). This study, dated 1945, was never published; all the original documents are preserved in 1 On the lamps purchased from Scalco in 1916, see Chubb n.d. On the "V" lamps, see V. B. [A. W.

DE SENA AND PAOLA CHINI Fig. 8.4.1a-b. Minoan lamp carved in steatite (inv. no. 60). the Academy's archaeology laboratory.4 In the 1990s, the current authors were asked to prepare a catalogue of the lamp collection, and in 1998 one of the authors organized a temporary exhibition at the American Academy in which approximately 70 lamps were displayed. The present authors feel honored to have been a part of this historical sequence of research and hope to have done justice to this impressive collection of lamps after a century of study. All the lamps, which range in date from the second millennium B.c. to the sixth or seventh century A.D., were manufactured in clay, with the exception of two examples, a Minoan lamp carved in steatite and a late Roman lamp manufactured in lead (inv. nos. 60 [fig. 8.4.1a-b] and 1948). Two artifacts (inv. nos. 2047 and 1209) from the early Italian Iron Age, which previous scholars suggested may have served as lamps, are not lamps at all but are respectively an as kos and a small vessel commonly known in Italy as a vasetto a barchetta , both common features in prehistoric fu- nerary deposits.5 Similarly, the two final entries in the catalogue are candleholders, not lamps (inv. nos. 204 and 1956). While the exact findspots of these artifacts are generally unknown, it has been possible to determine their origin (i.e., place of manufacture) through the optical analysis of the clays. In fact, more than half of the examples (ca. 60 percent) were manufactured in west-central Italy, probably Rome itself. All the forms are generally well known and have been classified according to various schemes, most importantly by Loeschcke, Dressel, Broneer, Deneauve, Howland, Ricci, and Bailey. The pres- ent authors have chosen to adhere most closely to the typology developed by Bailey since this stands as the most thoroughly published collection and contains the greatest number of classes.6 When Bailey's types can be identified within the Academy's collection, we have used his classification, often followed by the most common denomination (such as Firmalampen , or Loeschcke VIII). When there is no class in Bailey, the most commonly used names were relied upon (e.g., Vogelkopflampe). The lamps and Iron Age implements are arranged in chronological order, while the lead lamp and candleholders are placed at the end of the sequence. Because the archaeological contexts of the lamps and related objects are not known, all dates provided in the catalogue are derived from the available literature. Very few of the lamps show signs of having been utilized, as shown by carbonized wick holes and nozzles, although an unpublished document written in 1941 states that most lamps were washed with brushes in water and that some carbonization was washed off.7 This and the fact that so many 4 Chubb, Harmon, and Van Buren 1945. 5 Bertelli 1997. 6 Bailey 1975; 1980; 1988; 1996. 7 V.B.

Leda and the swan (inv. no. 2012). lamps are intact and in generally good condition have led the present authors to assume that much of the Academy's collection derived from tombs, as opposed to habitation sites. The only possible exceptions are some lamps excavated in 1928 on the property of the American Academy in Rome, in close proximity to the well-known oppires workshop, so that they may represent wasters. By the later third and second centuries B.c., with the advent of the use of molds in the produc- tion of these implements, the bodies of lamps were frequently embellished with a variety of motifs, including simple bead molding, vines and floral arrangements, and other geometric patterns. Beginning in the late second and first centuries B.c., the central discus of lamps often served as a space for figurai scenes consisting of deities (Capitoline Triad, Victory, Venus, Mercury, Isis, etc.), mythological personalities (Leda, the Graces, Cupid, etc.), human beings (gladiators, musicians, dwarves, etc.), animals (lions, dogs, fish, crocodile, deer, etc.), objects of daily life (anchor, ship, biga, etc.), Christian symbols (a cross, Chi-Rho, etc.), as well as large rosettes and other geometric patterns. Such representations are common on the following types: Dressel 3 (ca. 70-30 B.c.), volute lamps (first-second centuries A.D.), Firmalampen (ca. A.D. 70-200), Loeschcke VIII lamps (ca. A.D. 50-225), and Channel lamps (ca. A.D. 250-500). Full details of the 87 motifs are provided in the catalogue, but some of the most notable examples are described here. One of the earliest motifs in the Academy's collection consists of a large anchor with two flukes, a horizontal stock, and a dolphin twisted around the vertical shank (inv. no. 186; fig. 8.4.2). This is not an uncommon motif on lamps and dates to the first century B.c. A motif that occurs twice in this catalogue is that of the Capitoline Triad with Jupiter, Juno, and Minerva seated upon thrones (inv. nos. 2063 [fig. 8.4.3] and 4056). Minerva, to the left, holds a spear in her raised right hand and a shield in her lowered left; Juno, to the right, holds a cornucopia in her left arm and a patera in her right hand; Jupiter, in the center, holds a scepter in his raised left hand and possibly a patera in his right hand. The female deities are fully clothed, while Jupiter's torso is bare. Another representation that appears twice among the lamps is Leda and the swan. While the earlier example (inv. no. 2012; fig. 8.4.4), A.D. 175-225, is fairly straightforward, the motif on a lamp dated to the sixth century A.D. is more unusual in that Leda is shown reclining on the discus with her limbs dangling seductively over the rim as she embraces the swan (inv. no. 1935). Dated to the late second or early third centuries A.D. is a frontal representation of Venus, who stands naked with both arms raised, arranging two locks of hair on either side of her head (inv. no.</page><page sequence="334">322 ERIC C.

Eros, also nude, is standing in a three-quarters pose to the left of the goddess, facing right. The two figures are under an arch representing a grotto, which is composed of floral elements that spring from the head of a herm on the right. From the same period is an image of a clothed female deity (Magna Mater or Juno Caelestis) riding on the back of a lion (inv. no. 2014; fig. 8.4.6a-b). Her right arm is raised, while her left arm rests at her side, possibly holding a patera. A simple yet elegant motif consists of the Three Graces: the central Grace, with her back to the viewer, embraces the two other Graces, who stand in profile (inv. no. 2011; fig. 8.4.7). An unusual representation dated to the first or early second century A.D. consists of an old bearded male figure facing left who leans on a staff and pours a liquid from a small amphora onto what appears to be a flame inside a stone basin or altar (inv. no. 1993; fig. 8.4.8). A. W. Van Buren suggested that the figure is a Cynic philosopher, comparing it to a mosaic from Antioch- on-the-Orontes.8 Another lamp from the late first or second century A.D. (Loeschcke VIII) bears a figurai group composed of a pair of clothed bearded men seated opposite each other (inv. no. 2009; fig. 8.4.9). Between them is a square game table ( tabula lusoria) whose surface is divided into twelve equal, square segments. They are obviously engaged in a board game, and it appears that the final, victorious move has been made. While the subjects are not positively recognizable, it is interesting to recall the scene from Homeric epic where Achilles and Ajax play a board game during the siege of Troy. 8 Van Buren 1949, 123-124.</page><page sequence="335">Of the several gladiatorial scenes illustrated in the catalogue, one discus fragment from a lamp dated to the early first century A.D. bears a particularly emotional scene (inv. no. 4087; fig. 8.4.10). A gladiator has received a mortal blow and struggles to maintain himself as his legs buckle below him. We conclude these brief descriptions of the decorated lamps with a representation of a ship in relief, whose rostrum is in the form of a swan (inv. no. 1963; fig. 8.4.11), from the first or early second century A.D. While the depiction of the ship is not unusual, the fact that the mast and sail are incised in the discus (not molded, like the ship) is rare and has not been documented in past studies. The Academy's collection also contains a small number of plastic lamps - that is, lamps molded in the form of bulls' heads, human feet, grotesque heads, etc. The two bull's head lamps, dated ca. A.D. 50-100 are generally similar, although details vary (inv. nos. 2030 [fig. 8.4.12] and 114): in general, the lamps are wide at the rear and narrower at the front end, where the nostrils of the bull serve as wick holes. The upper surfaces of the lamps bear a combination of molded and incised fea- tures: almond-shaped eyes, horns, pointed ears, etc. A lamp in the form of a grotesque head deserves special attention (inv. no. 2034; fig. 8.4.13). The head is characterized by large, almond-shaped eyes with deep creases above and prominent brows, a long unarticulated nose, very large, flaring ears, sharp cheekbones, and fleshy lips in the form of a heart - the location of the wick hole. A ridge below the cheeks may represent a moustache, while globular features below ears may be earrings. Sixty- two lamps dated between the first century B.c. and the third/fourth centuries A.D. bear stamped (in relief or impressed) or incised makers' marks; five of these are completely illegible. The earliest makers' marks consist of either five dots arranged in a cross pattern (inv. no. 2073), nine dots (inv. no. 1977), four dots (inv. no. 2056; fig. 8.4.14), or a single letter or symbol (inv. nos. 2078, 2061 [fig. 8.4.15a-b], 1980, 181, 183).

Mark, Channel lamp (inv. no. 2039). Fig. 8.4.17 (far right). Bailey S lamp (inv. no. 2043). Between the mid-first century and the third century A.D., most makers' marks consisted of the abbreviated names of workshop owners or so-called franchisers. In this collection the exceptions are a polylychnos lamp with an inverted "R"; two Firmalampen , one with the single letter "D" (inv. no. 2053), the other with a pair of small concentric circles; and a Loeschcke VIII with the letter T (inv. no. 2019). Seven makers' marks (three volute lamps, a pear-shaped lamp, a Vogelkopflampe , and two Loeschcke VIII lamps) refer to the well-known lamp manufacturer C. Oppius Restitutus, whose workshop was active on the Janiculum hill in Rome (and possibly other localities in Italy) between the later first and second centuries A.D.9 Four makers' marks on Firmalampen read fortis, referring to L. Aemilianus (?) Fortis, one of the most important producers of this type of lamp, known to have been located in northern Italy in the late first and second centuries. The stamp of Gabinianus, Gabinius Ianuarius, or G. Abinius Ianuarius, a workshop active in central Italy between the late first and second centuries, occurs on a Bailey H lamp and two Loeschcke VIII lamps. Ap- pearing twice in the Academy's collection are the names of C. Clodius Successus (based in Rome; Flavian to Antonine) and L. Caecilius Saecularis (based in Rome; Antonine and Seveřan periods). Three Channel lamps (inv. nos. 2039 [fig. 8.4.16], 1930, 1931) and a Bailey S lamp (inv. no. 2043; fig. 8.4.17) bear symbols on the base, respectively a tree of life, a rosette, a cross, and a wheel or rosette, that may have referred to particular workshops. More complete descriptions, including references to CIL, are provided in the database, but we present a summary of the names in the list located at the end of this introduction. 9 Mocheggiani-Carpano 1982; Maestripieri and Ceci 1990.</page><page sequence="337">OIL LAMPS 325 This leads to the question of provenance. While some scholars have identified the more or less specific epicenter of production for many lamp manufacturers, the problem of satellite workshops discourages firm identifications of sources based upon epigraphy alone.10 A more precise method of determining provenance is through the analysis of the materials used. In this case the authors have used simple optical analysis with the aid of a low-powered microscope to determine the origins of the lamps. As mentioned above, the great majority of lamps were manufactured in west-central Italy, probably in or just outside of the Urbs itself.11 The area of western Latium, northern Cam- pania, and southwest Etruria hosts a variety of calcareous clays that are quite distinctive, generally soft and buff to light red in color. Regional variations can often be discerned. Because none of the ceramic bodies of the lamps under consideration have been tested mineralogically or chemically, the authors, while fairly certain of their Roman origin, have preferred to use the term west-central Italian fabric in describing provenance. Other lamps were clearly manufactured in northern Italy (eight examples, especially Firmalampen ), south Italy (six examples), the area of modern-day Tunisia (fifteen examples, especially the class of Channel lamps and other Early Christian lamps), Ephesus or the Aegean (nine examples), Egypt (four examples), and other localities. The specific origin of 27 lamps within the collection could not be determined. Detailed descriptions of the techniques employed in the manufacture of the lamps are not included in the database; we have simply stated "wheel made" or "mold made" in most instances. This is a topic that is worth elaborating here. The earliest clay lamps in the Academy's collection were formed on a potter's wheel, as turning marks and string scars on some bases reveal. In many instances, additional steps were taken to finish the lamps, such as the attachment of a rudimentary discus on "Esquiline lamps" or the formation of a central tube. Hand-formed nozzles were often attached to the sides of wheel-made lamps, over a perforation in the wall. With the advent of molds in the early Hellenistic period, the manufacture of lamps became a more rapid process, which may have involved unskilled laborers who simply pressed clay evenly into prepared molds. Each lamp was formed in two segments, the upper and lower halves, which were then joined and finished. Finishing involved the perforation of filling, wick, and air holes as well as trimming the seam between the upper and lower sections, adding incised details, and slipping. Most decorative ele- ments and makers' marks were created in the molds. Simple handles could also be formed in the upper and lower molds, while ring handles and heat shields were formed separately and attached to the body of the lamp. Evidence from a number of excavations in Italy reveals that lamps were often manufactured in the same workshops where pottery was produced.12 10 Harris 1980. 11 Meneghini 1987-1988 documents a deposit of lamp wast- ers from the vicinity of the Forum of Nerva, which included the following signatures: c oppi res, c clo svc, l mvn svc, and Gabínia. 12 For the workshop in insula 1.20 in Pompeii, which pro- duced volute lamps, early Vogelkopflampen , early Loeschcke VIII lamps, and bilychnos suspended lamps, see Cerulli Irelli 1977; for the oppires workshop on the Janiculum hill, responsible for the production of lamps and tableware, see Mocchegiani-Carpano 1982. Despite the fact that lamp frag- ments were among the debris at a pottery workshop along the Via Flaminia, there is no concrete evidence that lamps were manufactured along with pottery at this site (Carbonara and Messineo 1991-1992).</page><page sequence="338">326 ERIC C.

The coins were used in earlier times to teach numismatic courses but were long neglected. Katherine Geffcken, who here gives the history of the coin collection and describes some of its highlights, has catalogued the major portion of the coins and has surveyed the entire collection. Because of its specialized nature, the paper catalogue is kept together with the coins. Eventually they will be included in the database. The jewelry consists of small rings, necklaces, fibulas, and pins - less valuable pieces, owned by men and women of modest means; they are of interest because they represent a variety of techniques. As for the medical tools, it is not certain that they were indeed used by doctors, but here, as with the jewelry, it is just their modest nature that has kept such objects from being published in the past, and that makes their publication here valuable as comparanda for field archaeologists who find such material.

School Since of Classical at that time Studies the in School Rome possessed (ASCSR) included a course on numismatics in its curriculum. Since at that time the School possessed no coin collection of its own, arrangements were made for the Curator of Coins at the Vatican, Professor Enrico Stevenson, to offer instruction in the Vatican's coin room. Indeed, for Fellows and students of the School to have access to the Vatican's collection and the benefit of Professor Stevenson's services, the School had to appeal to the pope.2 Leo XIII generously granted permis- sion, but the January chill of the coin room proved too severe for Stevenson's health, and his lecture series was shorter than planned during each of the three winters until his death in the summer of 1898, at the age of 44. According to the School Director, Clement L. Smith, these uncomfortably gelid circumstances did not diminish the students' enthusiasm for studying the Vatican coins or their admiration for Stevenson: "Our students ... sat their hour and a half in overcoat and hat in the frigid atmosphere of the Numismatic Cabinet with unchilled ardor."3 By 1900, the new School Director, Richard Norton, longed to acquire a coin collection for the School so that the Americans would not be wholly dependent on the Vatican and its new Curator, Cavaliere C. Serafini.4 When Albert William Van Buren arrived in 1902 as Fellow in Classical Archaeology at the School, he rapidly grasped Norton's goal of building a didactic collection. On 5 December 1902, he bought a Republican bronze semis at Palestrina, the earliest purchase that can now be documented among the more than 3 ,000 pieces he acquired (no. 139). Especially between 1911 and 1913 , after he had become Librarian and Lecturer in Archaeology at the School, Van Buren actively bought large lots of coins. On the annual School trip to Greece, Van Buren visited dealers in antiquities, in par- ticular a shop called "Old Orient, Rue d'Hermes 24" at Athens. He also purchased coins at "5 Rue Nikis" in Athens. Van Buren 's most intense buying occurred in April 1912 in Athens and Piraeus. Notes on coin envelopes here and there suggest that he may even have purchased one or more of his hoards on that School trip in 1912. Although no clear record survives about the acquisition of 1 1 am grateful to C.

On a slip of paper in the coin drawers, a note in Van Buren s hand says, "Rom. Num. Interpret one of my III. Century Hoards." Van Buren refers here to one of the many seminars on numismatics he gave at the Academy, for instance in 1915-1916, 1928-1929, and 1932-1933. In general, records for Van Buren s purchases are meager, limited to what he wrote on the coin envelopes and some half-sheets containing catalogue information. He never entered his collection into the Academy inventory, nor are his coins mentioned in his will or the inventory of his estate. But not only did he often record dates and places of purchase on the envelopes, he also sometimes noted special cleaning of the coins. On the Academy's Greek trips between 1933 and 1935 he took many corroded pieces to the Agora in Athens to be treated by electrolysis. This process left the coins with grainy surfaces and exposed them to bronze disease. Today many of the coins desperately need conservation. On the yellowed half-sheets still in the coin drawers, Van Buren listed catalogue information for 172 coins, 128 of which are no longer in the collection. According to the descriptions, these missing 128 not only include Greek bronzes but also represent the bulk of Van Bürens holdings in silver and bronze from the Roman Republic and early Empire. No record exists for the withdrawal of these pieces, but Van Buren possibly sold them during World War II, when survival in Rome was difficult for him and Mrs. Van Buren with their American and British passports and no access to ration stamps.5 The most handsome pieces in the Academy's collection arrived much later, by bequest of Esther Boise Van Deman in May 1937 (pp. 62, 65; nos. 271-309). They were soon entered in the museum inventory, catalogued by a Fellow of the Academy, Walter F. Snyder.6 From time to time, donors added to the coin collection. Guy B. Colburn, for instance, gave sixteen coins of various periods collected in Lanuvio while preparing his study of the town (p. 357; nos. 3310-3325).7 And again, Herbert Richard Cross, who had been a student in the old Classical School from 1902 to 1904, bought a sestertius of Philip I in the Campo di Fiore (as it was known then) in 1911 and presented it to Van Buren (no. 145). Such additions as these, bought from small dealers or farmers or picked up on sites, are frequently illegible. The Academy's collection, as a whole, now contains 3,582 coins and five tokens.8 Full catalogue descriptions of the coins are filed in two notebooks kept with the Study Collection - for a sample page from the catalogue, see figure 1, showing entries for two Byzantine pieces. The Third-century Hoards Van Buren left no indication why the hoards are labeled B, F, G, H, and K. Such a selection of letters suggests the existence at some time of other hoards named A, C, D, E, I, and J, which are not today in the Academy's collection. Hoards B, F, and G must have come originally from Egypt since they contain, at least now, only Alexandrian potin tetradrachms, which did not circulate elsewhere in the empire. A complete listing of the coins in Hoards B, F, G, H, and K may be found in the catalogue. 5 Correspondence in the Van Buren Papers (Library of the American Academy in Rome) shows that in the fall of 1932 Van Buren ordered coins from Robert Ball (Berlin), spending up to $20.00 on an order. This is a further indication that the present collection lacks pieces Van Buren once owned. 6 Snyder 1938. See below, pp. 346-35 1, for more on the Van Deman coins. 7 Colburn 1914. 8 Note that the coins in the Study Collection have their own separate numbering system. The five third- century hoards are numbered each by hoard: e.g., B.l-15, F.l-10, etc. Then, beginning with the assorted Greek coins, the numbers are continuous from no. 1 through all the remaining groups, ending with no. 333 1.</page><page sequence="346">334 KATHERINE A.

These notes show that at one time, the hoard contained 24 coins. Today, fifteen tetradrachms are stored under the label "Hoard B," and there is no hint of what happened to the other nine. In three instances, the missing coins appear to duplicate pieces now in the collection. Sometimes Van Buren wrote himself notes for further study on the bottom of the catalogue sheets; most of his queries seem to focus on the coins that are no longer present. Including all pieces now on hand and those originally attested, Hoard B contained coins dating from Probus (of the Alexandrian year A.D. 280-281) to a tetradrachm of Diocletian of the year A.D. 289-290. The hoard must then have been deposited shortly after A.D. 290. Maximian is the most frequendy represented emperor (seven present and four missing), and Elpis the most common reverse type (Diocletian three and Maximian five).9 Hoard F (F. 1-10) As in the case of Hoard B, Van Buren left 24 half-sheets with penciled catalogue information, each describing an Alexandrian potin tetradrachm. Ten of these coins are now present. The group begins with Gordian III (a specimen dated A.D. 242-243) and ends with Maximian (a coin of A.D. 293-294; Van Buren recorded also a tetradrachm of Diocletian dated A.D. 293-294, not now in the collection). According to Van Bürens notes, this hoard also once contained two more tetradrachms of Gord- ian III (a.D. 242-243), one of Valerian (a.D. 255-256), two of Gallienus (a.D. 264-265 and 267-268), and single pieces of Salonina (undated), Claudius (a.D. 268-269), Probus (a.D. 277-278), another tetradrachm of Numerian (a.D. 283-284), and five more of Diocletian dating from A.D. 286-287 to 293-294. Thus, coins of Diocletian (ten) dominated this hoard, with a terminus post quem very near the end of potin tetradrachm coinage. The most frequendy attested types on the reverse (including pieces not now present) show an eagle right (four coins) and an eagle left (three tetradrachms). Hoard G (G.l-10) No notes on Hoard G survive from Van Buren s hand or that of anyone else. Ten envelopes, each holding an Alexandrian potin tetradrachm, carry the Hoard G label in Van Bürens hand, but we have no way of knowing the original size of the group. The ten pieces range in date from A.D. 278-279 (Probus) to A.D. 290-291 (Diocletian, Maximian). The hoard may have been laid down about 292 or shortly thereafter. Four out of the ten tetradrachms bear the portrait of Diocletian, and most of the hoard, as it now exists, was minted in the 280s A.D. All but one (G.l) of these ten pieces were cleaned by electrolysis at the Athenian Agora in 1933; five of these are now seriously corroded. It seems, then, that when Van Buren acquired them, Hoard G was in much poorer condition than Hoards B and F, which were never treated and are today in very good condition. In addition to Hoards B, F, and G, Van Buren owned nineteen other coins minted at Alexandria in the Imperial period. For descriptions of these, see the inventory (nos. 252-270). 9 Van Buren identified these pieces according to BMC Alexan- dria , but I have recatalogued them according to Curtis 1990.</page><page sequence="348">336 KATHERINE A.

These coins are stored in individual envelopes, on nearly all of which Van Buren recorded the obverse and reverse legends. On the rest of the envelopes the same information is recorded in another, unidentified hand. In a few instances, Van Buren or the unknown numismatist wrote on the envelopes catalogue information drawn from Cohen. Such references to Cohen suggest research on the coins was undertaken before 1927, when Roman Imperial Coinage , volume V, part 1 (a.D. 253-276) was published. Since no other information on Hoard H now exists, the findspot and original size of the deposit cannot be known. While possibly seven mints operating within this fourteen-year period may have produced these 166 coins, more than half of the antoniniani come from Rome. Of these from Rome, more than 50 percent belong to the years beginning ca. A.D. 264, when the Roman officinae used the Greek letter mintmarks A through H (i.e. workshops 1-8) and N (i.e., workshop 9), then later X and XI.10 No piece carries the XII of the last Roman officina , which became active at the end of Gallienus 's reign. 10 See RICV 1, 143, n. 1.

This table shows the contrast, in Hoard H, between sources for the joint reign of Va- lerian I and Gallienus (a.D. 253-260) and the sole reign of Gallienus (a.D. 260-268): here, in the joint reign, most of the antoniniani come from the eastern mints, whereas in the sole reign Rome supplied the large majority. The coins from ca. A.D. 253 to 260 also contrast dramatically in metal content with those of ca. A.D. 260 to 268: the antoniniani of the earlier period are base, dull silver, but those of the later years only washed in silver. These silver- washed antoniniani must have circulated but briefly, since most of them retain a considerable amount of the wash and have sharply defined obverse portraits. The absence of antoniniani bearing the mark of the Roman officina XII points to a terminus post quem about A.D. 266-267 for Hoard H. This terminus is confirmed by two pieces from Antioch (?) securely dated to Gallienus 's seventh and last consulship (a.D. 266-267): Hoard H.122, O.

Of course, this terminus must remain probable since no record indicates the original size of the hoard. Pieces from the provincial mints show clear preference for the draped or cuirassed portrait. In fact, antoniniani in Hoard H without mantle or cuirass coming from officinae outside Rome total only fourteen, all from the sole reign of Gallienus. Nine are probably from Mediolanum, three from Siscia (?), and two from Antioch (?). Those from Antioch both show the emperor's portrait left and, together with one such head from Rome, provide the only heads facing left in the hoard. Yet the contrasting styles of the mints make the Roman piece (H.57, inv. no. 10091; fig. 9.1.3) very different from the Antioch antoniniani. The head from Rome fills the field and communicates power and dignity. Gallienus's profile turns over the broad left shoulder seen from behind, and the aquiline nose and prominent chin suggest strength. The presentation here from behind the left shoulder has parallels in Republican coinage (a denarius showing a bust of Hercules in such a pose dated 112 or 111 b.c. and a similar obverse with Apollo from the same year).12 In contrast, the two left heads from the East, probably from Antioch, are small, with long, stalk-like necks; one (H.129) has prominent, rather gaunt features, but the other (H.139, inv. no. 10173; fig. 9.1.4) a huge ear and strange staring eye, a ball with a pit in the middle. Sixty-two out of the 91 from Rome, and these all from the sole reign of Gallienus, have the head without drapery or cuirass. All but four show the characteristic Roman inverted V at the bottom of the bust, this edge often finished with a border: The bare neck and shoulder seem to have encouraged Roman die- cutters to lengthen and decorate the two ribbons or ties hanging from the back of the radiate crown. One of the two ribbons characteristically loops up and outward, while the longer front ribbon falls forward over the bust, emphasizing the curve of the shoulder: From one to three pellets representing beads finish off the ends of the ribbons. A single officina may issue the same reverse types with obverses displaying different numbers of beads on the ribbon ends. Without more evidence, it is difficult to say if the beads signify anything more than the taste of the die-cutter. In any case, the bare-shouldered radiate head with its graceful ribbons suggests something more timeless, more divine, than the draped and cuirassed busts with their military connotations.13 12 See Crawford 1974, 297/la and lb obv. (Hercules, 112 or 111 B.c.) and discussion pp. 311-312; Crawford 1974, 298/1 (Apollo, 112-111 B.c.). Cf. Hercules on the obverse of Crawford 1974, 329/1 (100 b.c.). 13 Cf. the comments of a Wellesley College student, who said that George Washington on the United States quarter looked like a god, not only because he wears an archaic hairstyle but because his neck ends, bare, without clothing. In contrast, Lincoln on the penny and Jefferson on the nickel look "hu- man," she said, because they wear clothes.</page><page sequence="351">COINS 339 Immediate precursors to Gallienus 's Roman head are the Divi series from the mint of Rome (ca. A.D. 251), which display portraits of deified emperors, mosdy without drapery and sometimes with the ribbon falling forward on the shoulder.14 A more remote model might be, for instance, such a coin as the aureus of Augustus from Lugdunum on which the ribbons of the laurel wreath fall on the bare shoulder, one backward, the other forward ( RIC I2/ Augustus 192a).15 In his sole reign, then, Gallienus is symbolically placed among his divinized predecessors from Augustus on, especially in issues from Rome, and to a lesser extent from provincial mints. On antoniniani with draped or cuirassed busts, the die-cutters nearly always used short ribbons curving out from the back of the radiate crown, but even these can vary in width, treatment of the edges, and number of beads at the end. Here Rome and Mediolanum (H.108) sometimes prefer elaborate ribbons turning as if in a breeze and ending in two beads (e.g., H.41, with the mintmark T in exergue, from Rome), but Antioch (?) continues with conservative short ribbons finishing in a single bead. Occasionally, when the Roman die-sinkers combined long ribbons with cuirassed busts, they produced an awkward juxtaposition of details on the lower neck (e.g., H.45). Among Gallienus s Roman issues in Hoard H, the three most frequent reverse types bear the nostalgically hopeful legends fortvna redvx (six coins), secvrit perpet (eleven), and vberitas avg (fourteen). Workshop f produced the Fortuna reverse, workshop H the Securitas (but two of the eleven have no mintmarks), and the E of workshop five appears on eleven of the Uberitas type (the other three have no mintmark). I shall return below to the Uberitas reverse for further discussion. Eleven of Saloninas Roman pieces also display a type confidently emphasizing plenty and a hopeful future. Officina A issued these eleven bearing the legend fecvnditas avg. In two instances, the mintmark delta is so crudely made that it resembles three sides of an open box. From other mints, for the entire period A.D. 253-268, only one reverse appears as many as five times, AEQVITAS avg, all antoniniani minted at Antioch (?) in Gallienus 's sole reign and all showing a star in the left field. On these (H. 124-128), the figure of Aequitas is small, the lettering also small and neatly spaced - all arranged so as to leave the field uncluttered and render the design simple. In contrast, the specimens of the same reverse from Rome and Mediolanum have larger figures and awkward lettering (e.g., H.33 from Rome, H.104 from Mediolanum). On three coins in Hoard H, aberrant spellings occur: ivbentvtis instead of iwentvtis, from an Eastern mint, Antioch (?), H.27; aetetnitas instead of aeternitas, from Antioch (?), H.130; and FECVNDiiTAS instead of fecvnditas, from Rome officina A, H.155. H.155 also shows a blunder on the obverse: saloniina for salonina. ivbentutis is a "vulgar" spelling; the other mistakes were caused by ignorance or carelessness. The fourteen antoniniani with the reverse type Uberitas (H.87-100) provide an opportunity to study a range of Gallienus s portrait types, all from different dies, issued by one officina of the Roman mint in the 260s A.D. As stated above, eleven of these coins carry the mintmark E (in the reverse right field), and the other three lack a workshop mark. While, as a group, they range in diameter from 20 to 25 mm, ten measure 20-22 mm. Their weight varies from 2.80 to 4.20 g, with two coins weighing below 3.00 g, and two above 4.00. The average weight is 3.36 g. Most retain considerable silvering, and even where edges may be ragged and lettering blurred, the portraits on eight rate the grades extremely fine or very fine. Reverse figures tend to be less well preserved than obverse portraits, but five pieces show excellent details still intact. On the obverses, the head (facing right) without drapery or cuirass appears on twelve out 14 For evidence that the Divi series came from the Roman mint rather than from Milan, see Hunter III, cii - ciii. 15 On Augustus as a model for Gallienus, see below n. 16.</page><page sequence="352">340 KATHERINE A.

All but two of these twelve have a neat line edging along the bottom of the bust (one of the two lacking the border is uncertain because the border of the obverse is not preserved). One coin has two inverted V's instead of the common single inverted V typical of the Roman radiate head (H.99). Each of the radiate crowns has the usual five rays (counting the one on top of the head but not the protruding end of the crown at the back), and the rays are edged with a tiny, delicate border. The twelve heads all have two or three beads at the ends of the ribbons. These fourteen obverse portraits share many details, but they also have interesting differences. Nine of the profiles are tilted slightly up, with the hollow pupil of the eye directed a bit above a horizontal line. Many have a prominent brow line, sometimes upturned toward the bridge of the nose, and even a wrinkle on the forehead. The nose varies from almost straight to very aquiline and pointed (most are gently aquiline). Nostrils are long and high, and the mouths small and pursed, as if covering prominent upper teeth. Some have a moustache, and all have short beards made of neatly patterned pellets representing small curls. Necks seem longer than they actually are because of the bare shoulder lines, and at least one specimen (H.90) has a noticeable Adam's apple. The die- cutters turned their attention not only to the face and crown but also to the hair. Fine wavy ridges appear between the rays, and on the neck the hair ends in graceful, parallel semicircular lines. On the forehead, the hair is occasionally bunched but more often shown in locks curving back from the edge of the profile. Eight of the fourteen heads have three distinct locks, and three others have four to five. These heads contrast dramatically with Gallienus 's profiles on coinage of the joint reign with Valerian I. The age represented in the group of fourteen dated ca. A.D. 264 varies from youthful and delicate (H.87) to mature and experienced (e.g., H.94). In contrast, the portraits from Gal- lienus's earlier series (a.D. 253-260) only occasionally suggest youth; they nearly always have coarse features, short haircuts, and convey a rather brutish appearance. Indeed, they belong to what has been termed the "barrack-portrait" type. Analysis of the fourteen antoniniani from the mid-260s A.D. leads naturally to comparison with the well-known portrait of Gallienus in the Museo Nazionale Romano in Palazzo Massimo alle Terme.16 Most of the fourteen follow, in fact, the same model, reproducing in miniature the locks 16 Gallienus's portraits have been extensively analyzed, especially by Alföldi 1930; Delbrück 1940, 47-51, 119-124; L'Orange 1933, esp. 13-14, and L'Orange 1947, 86-90; Dusenbery 1948. In general, scholars divide Gallienus's portraits into two periods, those of the joint reign and those of the sole reign, when a "deified Gallienus" type developed. The models are Augustus and, especially in the sole reign, Alexander. On the portrait of Gallienus in the Museo Na- zionale Romano, see Giuliano 1979, 296, no. 181, inv. no. 644 (S. A. Dayan).</page><page sequence="353">COINS 341 on the forehead, the slightly knit brow and upward gaze, the prominent nose and small pursed mouth, and the tightly curled short beard. If the portrait in the Museo Nazionale follows shortly after Gallienus 's decennial anniversary (a.D. 262), as has been suggested, then it seems logical for the Roman mint to use the same type in these profiles.17 Again, the Divi coinage of Trajan Decius may have provided a recent model, in the portraits of Augustus, unbearded of course but showing similar locks on the forehead.18 Gallienus 's successor Claudius II did not continue this emphasis on curling locks but returned rather to military portraits with a cap of short hair and beards drawn with parallel straight lines even on the bare-shouldered heads issued for him by the Roman mint. Above, I have noted that two of the fourteen in the Uberitas series have cuirassed busts on the obverse. One of these (H.97) carries the mintmark E and in style clearly belongs with those portraits related to Gallienuss decennial image. The other (H.100, inv. no. 10134, which has no mintmark; fig. 9.1.5) differs gready in treatment. Its flan, clipped in two spots, has uneven edges, but otherwise the piece survives in superb condition, with excellent silvering. At 4.20 g, this antoninianus weighs more than all the others in the group. The portrait is done in much higher relief than H.87-98, and the lettering stands out sharply. The face has a large eye, large hooked nose, full lips, and the hair on the forehead is bunched in parallel lines. Large and small pellets in a stylized, regular pattern form the beard, and extremely small pellets the moustache. If this coin indeed comes from officina E, it reflects a different tradition in die design from those discussed above. Some of the same differences appear on the other piece without a mark in this group (H.99, already mentioned on p. 340). Also heavy (4.05 g), it has similar high relief, and though it lacks the delicate details of H.100, it shows a large eye and prominent, high-bridged nose. The hair ends in three locks and the curving ribbons in two beads, but the bottom of the bare bust, as I have men- tioned, finishes in the less common pattern of double inverted Vs. Like H.100, H.99 comes from portrait designers not interested in producing a handsome Gallienus. The reverse figure of Uberitas, again all from different dies, ranges from 11 to 14 mm in height, from squat and high-waisted (H.100) to long and svelte (H.90). Her feet are usually set flat, pointed outward on a firm exergue line, but one graceful Uberitas (H.96, inv. no. 10130; fig. 9.1.6) rests her weight on her straight right leg, and her flexed left leg extends slightly over the ground line. Her drapery also has lovely, clear details. Uberitas's head is small in some instances (e.g., H.91), and in others (e.g., H.100, inv. no. 10134; fig.9.1.5) grotesquely large, with a wide, high headdress finishing in two spikes (ears of grain?) on top. The die-maker for H.96 especially liked pellets, two for Uberitas s breasts and fourteen on her cornucopia. The object she holds in her right hand also has a row of five pellets at the bottom. In almost all respects, Uberitas resembles other female abstract figures that stand left and hold a cornucopia on the left arm. But the most interesting problem here concerns the object hanging from Uberitas s right hand. The type first appears among Trajan Decius s issues, where the object seems to be a purse. The object of the reverses of H.87-100 seems something quite different (H.88 and H.89 [inv. no. 10123]; fig. 9.1.7). Its exact design varies a little from die to die, but basically there is a triangle, inside of which hangs a long round shape crossed by parallel horizontal lines, and from the bottom triangle line hang one or more fingerlike projections (the five pellets in a row on H.96 are not repeated on the other thirteen antoniniani). The round object within the triangle most closely resembles a uterus, and the projections may be udders. In my opinion, the triangle most likely encloses a cows or sows uterus under which are her teats (or ubera - note the inscription uberitas 17 On the decennial portraits of Gallienus, see L'Orange 1947, 88-90. The coins I discuss show that an officina issued a reverse type with several styles of portraits for obverse. 18 See especially Hunter IV/Trajan Decius, Consecration issues 1, pl. 82.</page><page sequence="354">342 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN Fig. 9.1.7.

Hoard K (K.l-25) Hoard K also contains antoniniani from approximately the same period as Hoard H, but it begins earlier with one piece from the principáte of Trebonianus Gallus (a.D. 251-253) and ends sooner. The terminus post quem earlier than that for Hoard H derives from the absence of any antoninianus from the Roman mint with an officina mark higher than H. But certainty is impossible because no record of this hoard exists in Van Buren s notes. Hoard K now contains 25 antoniniani, but it may once have been slighdy larger. Three envelopes bear catalogue entries for coins different from those pieces now stored in them. Twenty-two out of the present group come from the Roman mint, and 21 from the sole reign of Gallienus (nine of these were coined for Salonina). All ten of Gallienus 's coins from Rome issued in the years beginning A.D. 260 have the head without drapery or cuirass. The following Roman mintmarks occur: Q (for Salonina), V; A, B, T, A, E, /, and H. The lack of marks X, XI, and XII suggests that the deposit, as it now exists, was laid down ca. A.D. 265, and not in the final period of Gallienus 's sole reign. In general, the antoniniani of Hoard K survive in poorer condition than those of Hoard H, but there are some fine exceptions (e.g., the obverse of K.ll and the reverse of K.17). Several from the sole reign have a coppery silver color (K.ll) or even brilliant copper on the high spots. In Hoard K, one coin (K.l) shows a startling misspelling (K.l). The abbreviated form of "Trebonianus" appears as trib instead of treb. No bars or stumps of bars for the E exist, nor is there any room for them. The reverse type of this antoninianus, ivno martialis, is often associated with Milan, but I have assigned it to Rome because this specimen carries the Roman version of the emperor's obverse legend. What this Juno Martialis, a type unique to the reign of Trebonianus Gal- lus, signifies remains unknown, but she must be a specific cult image: on some pieces she appears seated within a round, domed temple (see, e.g., Hunter III/Hostilian as Augustus 1; Trebonianus Gallus 25; Volusian as Augustus 8). 20 As mentioned above, there are in Hoard H eleven antoniniani of Salonina with the reverse type FECVNDITAS avg, all from officina A. Hoard K also has specimens of this type, but not all come from A. Five have the mark A, one bears no mark, and the seventh has E in the right field. These portraits from shop A and also the unmarked piece, all from different dies, show Salonina with a 19 RIC V 1/Gallienus (sole reign) 120: the object held by Uberitas is identified as a "bunch of grapes," but a foot- note adds the following: "The object held r. by Uberitas is sometimes described as an inverted purse or the udder of a cow" (140, n. 1). 20 For mints and types under Trebonianus Gallus, see Hunter III, civ-cix.

In contrast, the portrait from E (K.22, inv. no. 10222; fig. 9.1.9) has higher relief than all but one from A (K.18) and is less crude and much softer. The face has a rounded cheek rather than the gaunt look seen in many A portraits, a small straight nose, a fuller mouth, and nicely executed hair with a more natural hair line and a little curl before the ear. The engraver at officina E was working from a different, much more graceful and younger model than the designers of these pieces at workshop A. The Greek Coins (Nos. 1-138) On the paper envelopes in which he stored them, Van Buren catalogued the majority of his Greek coins according to page numbers in B. V. Head, Historia Numorum , revised edition (Oxford 1911). In addition, he left other pieces in envelopes marked, for example, simply "Athens" or "Aegina."21 I have recatalogued all the identifiable Greek pieces. The full description of these coins on file at the American Academy will include other authorities, often with variation in dating. Fifteen Greek coins survive in such poor condition that cataloguing has so far been impossible. But approximately a third of these may eventually be identified. Only five of Van Buren 's Greek collection are silver, all the rest bronze. Most belong to the fourth or third century B.c. Van Buren bought all but five of these Greek coins in May 1912 at Athens and Piraeus (and one at Corfu). The silver hemiobol from Tenedos he acquired in April 1910 at the Old Orient shop in Athens while on the Classical School spring trip. His one specimen from Syracuse came from a shop at 80 Via del Babuino in Rome, on 1 1 February 1913 , and in August 1934 Robert Ball of Berlin sold him a bronze from Corinth. Probably because he purchased nearly all his collection in Greece, the cities of southern Italy and Sicily are barely represented - only by the coin from Syracuse, two bronzes from Rhegium, and one from Tarentum. COUNTERMARKED COINS In 1912 Van Buren acquired eight countermarked Greek coins, seven at Athens and one at Piraeus. He set them aside as a separate group but never catalogued them. All are extremely worn, but I have been able to catalogue four (nos. 135-138). 21 Generally, Van Buren was on the right track in his identi- fications, but occasionally he saw types in curious ways: e.g., labeling a peacock a bee (no. 125 in Geffcken's notebook catalogue).</page><page sequence="356">344 KATHERINE A.

The Roman Coins (Nos. 139-270) Republican and Imperial As I have mentioned above in the introduction, Van Buren left notes indicating that his collection once contained many more Roman coins, specifically five silver pieces from the Republic not now on hand and nineteen silver and seventeen bronzes from the Empire no longer present. Today in the Academy's collection are thirteen bronze coins dating from 21 1 B.c. (or shortly after) to A.D. 270 and 82 base billon or bronze from A.D. 295 to 457. Van Buren attempted to catalogue only two or three of these coins. In the days before the publication of Roman Imperial Coinage , volumes VI-X, identifying the fourth- and fifth-century pieces must have seemed an especially daunting task. As in other instances, Van Buren bought most of these coins, especially the fourth century pieces, in Athens or Piraeus (or a few on Corfu) during the spring of 1912 while on the annual Classical School Greek trip. In December 1912 and January 1913, he gave a seminar on Roman numismat- ics,22 which seemed to have spurred him to buy more coins: for instance, no. 143, purchased at an unidentified shop near the Forum on 21 January 1913; no. 181, bought at Fiorentini, 80 Via del Babuino, on 1 1 February 1913 ; no. 150, at Subiaco, 15 February 1913 ; and no. 202, at 5 Rue Nikis, Athens, 17 May 1913. No. 185, inv. no. 10434 (fig. 9.1.10), a bronze coin of Constantius II from Siscia, is one of the few in the Academy's collection for which the provenance is known. It was found in the autumn of 1909 in the garden of the old Classical School at Villa Bonghi. Here is its catalogue entry: Constantius II 19 mm; 2.45 g. A.D. 19 January-25 December 350. Mint: Siscia.

The Praetorian Guard had been disbanded by Constantine in A.D. 3 12 (Zosimus 2.17), and the inner wall of their camp largely dismantled,23 but perhaps the area of the parade ground in front of the Castra continued to have some military associations. In any case, a coin from Siscia in a Roman context shows movement of currency from east to west across the Adriatic.24 The stylized portrait of Constantius on this coin from Siscia contrasts strikingly with the later portrayal of Jovian on an Alexandrian piece Van Buren bought on Corfu (no. 217, inv. no. 10466; fig. 9.1.11): Jovian. 16+ mm; 2.15 g.

Within wreath, vot v In exergue, ALEr RIC VIII/ Alexandria 92. Jovian s nose is slender but his face fleshy and his neck short and thick. The eye is treated simply but realistically, and his chin, which juts forward, suggests aggressiveness. The pearl diadem is neatly articulated, but the short hair is indicated just by shallow parallel lines. The engraver has concentrated on the face and attempted a real portrait. In contrast, the earlier portrait of Constantius II is not only stylized but almost rudimentary. The long narrow head is modeled in flat, linear lines, with an almost frontal, large eye, full lips, and pointed chin. The Siscia designer, however, devoted effort to making the hair an elegant cap of slightly wavy lines and to showing each pearl of the diadem and ties at the back in sharp relief. The portrait is generalized and, though much like many other profiles of Constantius in its long slenderness, clearly identifiable only through the legend. In the coin catalogue notebook, I have organized the thirteen coins spanning 21 1 b.c.-a.d. 270 chronologically. The 82 from A.D. 295 to 457 I have arranged according to RIC VI-X. As is logical in lots bought at Athens and Piraeus, the majority of these 82 coins (a.D. 295-457) come from the mints closest to Attica: Thessalonica, Heraclea, Constantinople, Nicomedia, and Cyzicus (with the most, thirteen, from Thessalonica). The collection includes many coins in poor condition from wear and from loss of margins. Some are in legible state but unfortunately struck so off-center as to omit the mintmark. In comments with the catalogue entries, I have indicated particular problems and possible identifications. The full catalogue notebook, on file at the American Academy in Rome, contains more detailed notation on these uncertain pieces, as well as the weights. As for denomination and metal content, I have followed the terminology used in the particular volume cited, for instance, from Roman Imperial Coinage. For the antoniniani minted ca. A.D. 260 and after, I have noted if any silvering survives. For pieces identified from RIC VIII, I have used the term "base billon" if the coin looks even slightly silvery or dull brown, " AE" if it has a pronounced copper color. Three coins duplicate specimens in Hoard H: no. 146 (cf. H.13), no. 147 (cf. H.48-53), no. 149 (cf. H. 139). To judge from Van Buren s notations on the envelopes, nos. 146, 147, and 149 were kept carefully separate from the hoard, since they were acquired in a different lot. 23 See Richmond 1927, 22. 24 On the trans- Adriatic trade and "the predominant move- ment of coins from East to West," see RIC VIII, 93, 111.</page><page sequence="358">346 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN Greek Imperial/Roman Provincial Van Buren s collection includes, newly catalogued, eighteen pieces of the Imperial period from varied Greek mints (nos. 234-251) and, in addition, nineteen coins dating from A.D. 41 to 294 from Egypt (nos. 252-270). This latter group of nineteen is not to be confused with the three hoards from Alexandria (see above, p. 335). Many of these coins came to Van Buren in the large lots he bought in Athens and Piraeus in 1912. On Corfu during the same Classical School trip, he acquired the bronze from Philippi (no. 234). In August 1934, Van Buren bought no. 250 (a bronze of Herod Philip II) from Robert Ball of Berlin for a half mark. Then, a year later, on 12 August 1935, Signor Luigi Tacconi presented to the Academy the coin from Nicaea; it was entered in the inventory book as item no. 1 123 (no. 243). Three of the Alexandrian potin tetradrachms were gifts in 1914 from C. Densmore Curtis, who bought them from children at the Pyramids (nos. 261, 267, and 269). The Van Deman Collection (Nos. 271-309) At her death in May 1937, Esther Boise Van Deman left to the American Academy all her antiqui- ties then in Italy. The parts of her collection stored in America she gave to the Kelsey Museum at the University of Michigan. Among the objects received in Rome were 39 coins, 37 of which were rapidly published by a Fellow of the Academy, Walter F. Snyder. I have recatalogued 32 of these according to authorities who have published since Snyders work.25 The 38th and 39th pieces I omit, as did Snyder, because they lie outside my area of knowledge. On the envelope containing them, Miss Van Deman wrote, "Coins from India. Pres. by Col. Breakspear, 1914." They appear to consist of a silver alloy, weigh less than one gram, and, where the surface is not worn away, show semicircular and round calligraphic patterns within sides of a square. Esther Van Deman s tastes or resources did not encourage her to build a collection balanced between Greek and Roman mints. Rather, she bought, I suspect, what caught her eye in coin mar- kets in or near Rome and, in particular, she purchased pieces with Republican or Imperial types related to her archaeological and historical interests. The first coin in her collection, a bronze from Castulo (no. 271), she seems to have regarded as an odd piece, labeling it "Spanish money." The second (no. 272) belongs to a more characteristically Greek minting tradition, a silver diobol from Heraclea in southern Italy. Other than these two pieces (and the two Indian coins), Van Deman s acquisitions all derive from Republican or Imperial mints. I have identified her fourteen Republican coins (nos. 273-286) according to Crawford's catalogue (Crawford 1974). Although authorities have differed with some of Crawford's dating, I have decided, for the purposes of this catalogue, to list his years.26 When Snyder tackled Miss Van Deman 's Imperial pieces, all volumes of Roman Imperial Coinage had not been published, and volume I had not been revised. In two instances, Snyder incorrecdy identified coins, probably because his sources were not detailed enough or the coins too worn. For the five pieces where I have followed Snyder's cataloguing, I have credited him with a notation in the entry. 25 Snyder 1938. Snyder's catalogue was one of many projects directed by Professor A. W. Van Buren in the 1930s. In order to publish objects in the Academy's collection, Professor Van Buren assigned groups of objects to the Classical Fel- lows and closely monitored their progress and accuracy. I have retained Snyder's cataloguing for numbers 290, 291, 292, 293, and 301 - all according to volumes of RIC still the standard source. 26 See, for instance, W. E. Metcalf's comments in his review of Crawford 1974 in American Journal of Archaeology 80 (1976) 215-216.</page><page sequence="359">COINS 347 All of the Van Deman coins are noted in Van Buren s inventory ledger under the number 1 173 . Individually they were given numbers 1-37 on inventory cards in the American Academy's files, in a sequence appearing to follow Miss Van Deman s numbering. Snyder changed the sequence, and I have slighdy revised his order according to modern practice. But I have noted the earlier numbers, to ensure complete referencing. A complete listing may be found in the catalogue. Like many of her colleagues in Rome, Esther Van Deman (1862-1937) purchased small antiqui- ties in local street markets and on sites from peddlers. Most of her coins probably came from Roman sources, but one envelope (containing no. 295) carries the label "C. &amp; E. Canessa. Antiquaires- Numismates, Paris, Naples (Piazza dei Martiri) and New York." And in 1913, when she traveled around the sites in Tunisia and Algeria accompanied only by a guide, she bought at Constantine (Algeria) her sestertius of Gordian III, no. 299. Even if she often failed to record place of purchase, Miss Van Deifian usually noted a general description of the piece on each small paper envelope. For instance, on no. 289 she wrote "Pic [ =piccolo] Bronze. Nero," and on the envelope containing no. 274, "litde coins." Some of her identifications are incorrect. For example, she thought "C. Caesar" on no. 285, a quinarius of Octavian, referred to Julius Caesar and wrote "J. Caesar" on the envelope. She apparently made no effort to catalogue the coins. On the envelope for no. 282 (Crawford 1974, 445/lb), Miss Van Deman wrote, "Miss Palmer Xmas 1912." "Bessie" to her friends, Elizabeth Hatch Palmer, Wellesley B.A. 1887 and Yale Ph.D. 1905, was an Associate Professor of Latin at Vassar who often spent her summers (as well as her sabbatical in 1910-1911) in Rome. She herself collected coins and gave a course on numismatics at Vassar. In 1917 she published an article on building a numismatic teaching collection, to use in the classroom. She advises the beginner to go to Canessa in Naples and invest $5.00, which will buy, she estimates, twenty coins of varied periods.27 In 1915-1917 the dollar was worth 6 to 7 lire ;28 Miss Van Deman purchased her coins for about the same price as Miss Palmer reports, for one to 2 lire apiece. For instance, no. 276 (Crawford 1974, 235/lc), no. 279 (Crawford 1974, 407/1), no. 281 (Crawford 1974, 433/1), and no. 283 (Crawford 1974, 459/1), all bought together, cost one lira each (date of purchase not recorded). In 1922, when the lira had dropped in value, exchanged now at a range of fifteen to twenty to the dollar,29 Miss Van Deman bought her fine Republican didrachm no. 273 (Crawford 1974, 28/3) for 30 lire. Among Miss Van Deman's noteworthy pieces, no. 277 (Crawford 1974, 287/1), no. 286 (Craw- ford 1974, 534/3), and no. 280 (Crawford 1974, 425/1) deserve special comment. If she tended to buy coins not according to any carefully designed program but primarily because certain pieces caught her eye (as seems likely), then the first two denarii would rank high in appeal to the buyer. They are not only interesting in iconography and political message, but they are also artistically successful. The third denarius, which celebrates the ancestry and achievements of the Marcii, would naturally attract Van Deman because of her great interest in the Aqua Marcia. The anonymous denarius of 115 or 114 B.c. (no. 277, inv. no. 10526, Crawford 1974, 287/1; fig. 9.1.12a-b) bears on the obverse an impressive head of a helmeted female whom Crawford identifies as Roma (see the word roma below her hair and neck).30 Designed, to be sure, by a 27 Palmer 1917, esp. 213. For information on Professor Palmer (1865-1920), I am grateful to the Wellesley College Archives for access to her biographical file; see also ASCSR Annual Report 1910-1911, 22, 29. Palmer and Van Deman may have met in the years 1893-1895, when the latter taught at Wellesley and Palmer taught at Wheaton Seminary, but certainly they met in Rome in 1910-1911, when Palmer came to Italy for her sabbatical. 28 On the exchange rate, see Annual Report 1915-1916, 79; 1916-1917, 80. 29 Annual Report 1922-1923, 59. 30 Crawford 1974, 721-725 firmly believes that the many female helmeted heads on Republican silver coinage are Roma.

Miss Van Deman also owned three other, earlier Republican coins with helmeted female heads, a quinarius (no. 274, Crawford 1974, 44/6), a sestertius (no. 275, Crawford 1974, 44/7), and the well-known denarius of 137 B.c. showing the she-wolf, twins, Ficus Ruminalis , and Faustulus on the reverse (no. 276, inv. no. 10535, Crawford 1974, 235/lc; fig. 9.1.13a-b). These earlier heads wear a winged Attic helmet with the visor in three pieces, and their hair ends in three wavy locks on the neck. The designer of no. 276 also decorated the head with an earring and necklace of beads. Like no. 276, no. 277 has a string of beads and an earring (but of a different type from that on no. 276). 31 On no. 277 two locks of hair fall to the left, and the end of the third appears in front of the neck from behind the head; a bit of her hair shows on the temple, and a lock curls gracefully in front of her ear. Most unlike the previous heads, however, is the deep, rounded modeling of features and the winged, crested Corinthian helmet she wears. The curving end of the crest even parallels waves in the hair, suggesting wind and motion. Sydenham remarks that this crested, winged helmet "introduces a new motif in the development of the head of Rome."32 Indeed, the first Roma with a Corinthian helmet was a standing figure on the reverse of Crawford 1974, 281/1, dated 119 B.c. Certainly, many models lie behind the denarius of 115-114 B.c.: many staters from Corinth, Syracuse, and southern Italy show Athena in a Corinthian helmet (e.g., Syracuse 314-310 B.c. [. McClean 2820, pl. 101.5] and Locri 350-300 b.c. [ McClean 1789, pl. 57.2]). The reverse of no. 277 is equally appealing, and again different from previous denarii. A helmeted female (usually considered Roma) sits on two shields and a helmet, holding a spear and looking down at the she-wolf and twins. Roma's garment falls just below her knees so that the details of her tightly strapped boots are evident. Two birds fly toward her, ravens according to Crawford.33 As this Roma also wears a Corinthian helmet, the scene on the reverse broadens the field of the obverse, expanding the head into a tableau of whole figures. Later, the seated figure of Roma was to become an imposing element in Roman iconography,34 but here she seems to be resting and relaxed, her attention absorbed by the wolf and the human nurslings. The lupa and twins had already ap- peared, of course, with Faustulus on no. 276 and, much earlier, by themselves on Crawford 1974, other possibilities (Diana, Bellona, Minerva, Rhome), he leans toward Diana or Rhome: Mellor 1981, esp. 974-975. 31 On types of earrings, see Sydenham 1952, xxvii and pl. 3.

Both obverse and reverse of no. 277 convey a strong awareness of Roman identity. No. 286, inv. no. 10535 (Crawford 1974, 534/3; fig. 9.1.14a-b) is one of three pieces minted in 38 B.c. by Agrippa in Gaul (the others are Crawford 1974, 534/1, 2), a notable denarius because in this issue Imperator first occurs as a praenomen. Around the obverse portrait of Octavian, the legend clearly and boldly reads imp • caesar divi • ivli • F. Syme has shown the political impact of this daring nomenclature.36 In 38 b.c., Octavian mounted an ambitious two-pronged naval attack against Sextus Pompey. But Sextus rapidly defeated these fleets near the Straits of Messina. At this time, Syme says, "The young Caesar stood in sore need of prestige, comfort and advertisement."37 While honoring Octavian with this powerfully suggestive praenomen , on the reverse Agrippa omits reference to his own recent salutation in Gaul. Instead, the reverse field, far from being character- istically filled with complex scene or symbols, displays impressive empty space bearing, centered in the middle, only the legend M • AGRIPPA • COS DESIG The simplicity proclaims strength and confidence. On the obverse, the engraver portrayed Octavian as young but imperious. The full head of hair, designed in short parallel ridges, the lean, smooth face with short beard along the chin, and the long, slender neck suggest youth. But the straight, strong nose, staring eye, slightly down-turned mouth, and upward tilt of the chin communicate imperiousness. The denarius of 56 B.c. (no. 280, inv. no. 10529, Crawford 1974, 425/1; fig. 9.1.15a-b) issued by a Marcius Philippus (either L. Marcius Philippus Cos 38 or Q. Marcius Philippus Pr. ? 48)38 fits directly into one of Van Deman 's major research interests. It promotes Ancus Marcius as ances- tor on the obverse; in fact, it shows Ancus as a Hellenistic king, beardless and diademed. On the reverse it claims the Aqua Marcia as a major achievement of the family. In 1913, Miss Van Deman started her close investigation of the Marcia and the Claudia, generously helped by Thomas Ashby, who had been collecting material on the aqueducts for years. At least sixteen photographs in her monumental volume, The Building of the Roman Aqueducts , which finally appeared in 1934, were 35 The similar posture of wolf and twins on these coins sug- gests as model the statue set up in 293 B.c. by the Ogulnii ad ficum Ruminalem (Livy 10.23.11-12). 36 Syme 1958. 37 Syme 1958, 181.

GEFFCKEN taken by Van Deman in that year, 1913, on her trips through the Campagna.39 When and where she acquired this denarius, however, is unknown; only the price, 3 lire , suggests it may have been bought after 1922, when Van Deman returned to Rome after five years in the United States.40 Before World War I such a coin would probably have cost 1 lira. From about 1924, when Miss Van Deman increasingly focused on her analysis of aqueduct construction, it would have been an especially alluring purchase. The five arches of the Aqua Marcia on the reverse of this denarius must have struck a chord in her because she felt much affection for the Marcia, and in particular for the great bridge of the Marcia, Ponte Lupo. For her, the splendors of the Marcia were immortalized in familiar lines from Latin writers, and the daring engineering of its bridges invited her technical scrutiny. In her first chapter she writes, "Marcius [Q. Marcius Rex Pr 144, 143], born in an age imbued with the spirit of the beauty-loving Greeks, gave to the city not only an inexhaustible supply of wholesome drinking-water but, also, another and no less enduring gift, a great monument embodying in its bridges and lofty arches new principles as well as new materials and methods of construction."41 And she began the second paragraph of her chapter on the Marcia, "Sung by ancient poets for its beauty and the excellence of its water, and lauded even in our own day for the simplicity and beauty of its architecture, the Marcia. . . "42 She also sent photographs of the Marcia with greetings to friends: for Christmas 1932, a print of her 1913 photograph of the Marcia at Ponte degli Arci, mailed to a friend at Wellesley College,43 and in the archives at the University of Michigan, a photograph of herself in front of Ponte Lupo inscribed, "I and my dear Ponte Lupo."44 Miss Van Deman did not tackle the identification of the equestrian statue atop the aqueduct on the reverse of this denarius. Neither did her colleague Ashby. In his book on aqueducts, he mentions the arches on the coin briefly;45 she never does. But this equestrian statue has been linked by some authorities46 to CIL 3.846, no. Ill, a military diploma that, according to its text, was at- tached to the base of a statue of Q. Marcius Rex behind the temple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus. In Plainer- Ashby this statue is indeed mentioned under Aqua Marcia and under Basis Q. Marci Regis , but no reference to the image on the coin is made.47 Miss Van Deman also notes this statue on the Capitoline but gives no source. In discussing the branch of the Marcia to the Capitoline, she states that no physical evidence survives, but "the general location of its official terminus, however, 39 Van Deman 1934. Van Deman writes of beginning her study of the Claudia and Marcia, with Ashby 's assistance, in her report to the Carnegie Institution of Washington: Van Deman 1913. 40 On her return to Rome in 1922, Van Deman bought her fine didrachm (no. 273) for 30 lire (date and price noted in her handwriting on the coin envelope). 41 Van Deman 1934,7. 42 Van Deman 1934, 67. 43 This print of the Marcia at Ponte degli Arci comes from negative 1 146 in the Van Deman photographic archive at the American Academy in Rome; the person at Wellesley College to whom it was sent is unrecorded. Van Deman s message on it can be dated after 12 November 1932 because of reference to the funeral of Adeline Belle Hawes, a retired Wellesley Professor of Latin who died in Rome on 12 November. Van Deman remarks that she had returned to Rome after spend- ing "an awful nine months correcting printers [sic] errors" in the proof of her aqueduct book. This same photograph appears opposite p. 85 in the aqueduct book. 44 The photograph of Van Deman in front of Ponte Lupo is filed at the Bendey Historical Library, University of Michigan, Van Deman archive. 45 Ashby 1935,89. 46 E.g., by Sydenham 1952, note on coin no. 919, p. 153; Crawford 1974, 1:449; Stuart 1945, passim; Morgan 1978, 39. 47 Plainer- Ashby, 26, 82 respectively. Chioffi 1993 rejects the suggestion that the equestrian statue on the coinage is Q. Marcius Rex since the type of statue erected on the Capitol was probably not equestrian. Richardson, in his entry on the base of Q. Marcius Rex's statue, does not refer to the coin: Richardson 1992, 57.</page><page sequence="363">COINS 351 is approximately sure, since the site of a statue to its illustrious builder, Marcius, which stood, doubdess, at no great distance from the end of the course, has been located behind the temple of Jupiter Capitolinus."48 Of course, Miss Van Deman concentrates primarily on construction, and a possible link to the denarius of 56 b.c. was not within her focus. In fact, no evidence exists that the statue on the Capitoline was equestrian. It may or may not have been. Furthermore, the Marcii did indeed boast a prominent equestrian statue elsewhere, that of Q. Marcius Tremulus Cos 306 B.c. and triumphator , which stood before the temple of Castor.49 A denarius of L. Marcius Philip- pus (Crawford ^293/1, 113-112 b.c.) probably shows this equestrian statue. The rider appears as triumphator holding a laurel branch, but as on the denarius of 56 B.c., there is a flower beneath the statue; the rider on the denarius of 56 B.c. holds the reins in his left hand but nothing in his right. Yet a link between an equestrian statue and an aqueduct may possibly appear on a denarius of Mn. Aemilius Lepidus issued in 114 or 113 B.c. (Crawford 291/1) just before the coin of L. Marcius Philippus Cos 91. On Lepidus's denarius, the horseman, cuirassed, wreathed, and carrying a spear, rides atop three arches. But these arches have also been interpreted as a base for the statue.50 Just what the relation among these statues and with the Capitoline base may be will remain uncertain unless further evidence surfaces. The Byzantine Coins (Nos. 310-629) The Byzantine specimens begin with a coin probably from the reign of Anastasius I (a.D. 491-518) and end with aspra trachea of the thirteenth century (nos. 310-629). These 320 pieces are all bronze or, in the case of the trachea, billon or copper. Ninety-one of the coins are stored in separate enve- lopes bearing Van Buren s catalogue notations from Wroth 's Imperial Byzantine Coins in the British Museum. On nearly every envelope, Van Buren recorded that the enclosed piece had been purchased at Athens or Piraeus in May 1912. 1 have recatalogued these according to numbering and dating for the Dumbarton Oaks Collection. The information in each instance begins with the name of the emperor, following the cataloguing pattern used for Byzantine coins. In addition, Van Buren left, in similar small envelopes, six uncatalogued Byzantine coins, which I have been able to identify. The billon aspra trachea will be dealt with in a second section because they raise special issues.51 Byzantine Aspra Trachea The billon aspra trachea (formerly called scyphate or "cup" coins) number 223. Of these, 213 were heaped together in a box without identification. They are possibly a hoard, acquired at Athens in 48 Van Deman 1934, 139. 49 Plainer- Ashby, 202. See also Papi 1995. 50 Morgan 1978, 41 interprets the arches on Lepidus's denarius as a "statue-base and nothing more." Many of Morgan's arguments are aimed at refuting Meriwether Stuart (Stuart 1945). Stuart proposes that the three arches on Lepidus's coin belong to an aqueduct, not a bridge, and argues that the equestrian statue on these arches is that of M. Aemilius Lepidus censor 179. Crawford 1974, 305-306 accepts Stuart's argument that the arches are an aqueduct but considers the identity of the statue on Lepidus's denarius uncertain. Stuart sees the denarius of 56 B.c. as a statement of Marcian claims over against those of the Lepidi and believes that the statue is indeed that on the Capitoline transferred by the die engraver and shown on top of the aqueduct, to emphasize Q. Marcius Rex's special achievement (p. 251). See also Crawford 1974, 449. But for doubts that the builder of an aqueduct was shown as a horseman, see RE 14.2, col. 1583: Marcius no. 90 (Münzer). 51 1 wish to thank Michael Hendy for talking with me in De- cember 1990 about twelfth- and thirteenth-century Byzantine coinage in the collection of the American Academy in Rome.</page><page sequence="364">3 52 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN 1912, like many of Van Buren's other coins. Of the ten trachea stored in separate envelopes, six are marked "Athens 1912," a seventh "Piraeus May 1912," and an eighth "Corfu May 1912." One or more of these trachea in envelopes may come from the group in the box, but no information exists to show the relationship, if any. It seems therefore logical to treat first the pieces in envelopes (nos. 407-416) and then, in a separate section, those collected in the box (nos. 417-629). Among these trachea in envelopes, no. 415, inv. no. 10663 (fig. 9.1.16) is the most interesting. In a reused envelope hastily marked "Gold Cup - Property of VB" was a trachy of rather thin fabric, perforated for use in jewelry and different in appearance from all the others. It has a light yellowish pink color with high gloss, clearly an alloy containing copper, but not gold as Van Buren thought. To him the piece was important because it recalled an appreciative gesture from his students. On another envelope (which contained the wrong billon coin), Van Buren wrote, "AV Scyphatus, purchased of a money-changer on Aeolus St. Athens, near Stadium St., and presented to Mr. V.B. by the members of the Roman School Greek Trip, April 1910." In his report for 1909-1910 Van Buren mentions the annual trip to Greece under his leadership, from 24 March to 1 May, with twelve members.52 Van Buren had difficulty identifying the trachy, but his notes on the envelope show he ultimately recognized it as a piece from the Kingdom of Nicea. Others have also found this issue difficult be- cause specimens survive in almost illegible condition. Hendy (1969, 407) assigned it to Theodore II, Ducas-Lascaris, dated A.D. 1254-1258, and Grierson agreed (1982, 252, pl. 72, no. 1190). But in the addenda at the back of DOC IV (1999, 699), Hendy writes that he has changed his mind after finally examining a specimen with a readable inscription. He now assigns the trachy to John III, Ducas, called Vatatzes, A.D. 1221-1254. Thus, Van Buren s piece has this updated full catalogue entry: No. 415 John III, Ducas (called Vatatzes), Kingdom of Nicea. 27 mm, 2.3 g. Copper and ?? Perforated. A.D. 1221-1254. Mint: Magnesia. O.

Trachea Stored in the Box (a Hoard?) Here I will offer a partial report on this possible hoard. The catalogue presents 50 randomly chosen trachea (nos. 417-466). Observation of the other 163 trachea in the box indicates a dominance of coins from the Latin states and from the Bulgarian tsars, duplicating many of the pieces listed above. If, then, this group was a hoard, it must have been deposited in the first half of the thirteenth century. But, of course, there is no certainty that the hoard is intact today; only a probable date can be suggested. Among the handsomest of the group listed in the catalogue is the first (no. 417, inv. no. 10666; fig. 9.1.17), a billon trachy of Manuel I, worn on its obverse but extremely fine on the reverse. Here is its full catalogue entry: Manuel I, Comnenus. 31m, 3.35 g. Billon. A.D. c. 1160-c. 1164 ? Mint: Constantinople. O.

Simplified as the emperor 's form must be within the coin's small dimensions, the diesinker nev- ertheless succeeded in suggesting the opulence of the imperial costume. There are no less than 64 pellets on the emperor's crown and garments, each representing a jewel. The rows of pellets within their linear borders define the chlamys and collar and decorate the left and right edges of the lower divitision (the long tunic) showing below the chlamys. The frontal presentation of the emperor furthermore enables the diesinker to display the stemma, the imperial crown, with its pendilia, hanging pearls, on either side of the emperor's face. Here the crown is a line of seven pellets, and the pendilia have the shape ¿ Occasionally, for example on nos. 432 and 433, the lower pellet is larger: ¿ Other variet- ies have an even more decorative effect, for instance, nos. 418, 428, 435: ¿ ^,no.437:^ ' and</page><page sequence="366">354 KATHERINE A.

Such variety was not a casual whim of the diesinker. Hendy has demonstrated that variations depicting the imperial costume were precisely controlled at Constantinople and are the signatures, so to speak, of individual officinae and their distinctive issues.54 Even when the quality of die and sureness in striking decline, the imperial costume retains some of its luster. Among Latin imitations, trachea from Thessalonica show the emperor s loros patterned in a series of squares (three or four across and four down), each containing a pellet. The lines of these squares and the pellets stand out in bright copper against the dark surface of the coins. The Venetian Coins (Nos. 630-3307) The Academy's collection contains five varied Venetian coins and 2,673 torneselli. I will discuss the torneselli separately below. None of these pieces was ever entered in the Academy's inventory. The varied coins are: no. 630, inv. no. 10891 (fig. 9.1.19), a silver grosso (1268-1275); no. 631, a silver soldino (1339-1342); no. 632, an almost illegible bronze bagattino of the sixteenth century; and nos. 633-634, two eighteenth-century bronze gazzette from the provincial mint of Zara (Zadar). Because Van Buren encountered considerable difficulty in identifying the grosso (no. 630), it is the most intriguing of this small group. He noted on the envelope that he bought it at the "Old Orient" in Athens in April 1910, and he first labeled it a Byzantine piece of the "Emperor Romanus III?," adding to the side "problem." Years later, in July 1932, as he noted on the envelope, he took it to London, where he showed it to John Allan and Harold Mattingly at the British Museum. They identified it as a coin of Stephen Urosh I of Serbia (1240-1272), and Van Buren duly noted the reference Engel and Serrure 1894, 895-896. The coin's thin fabric and worn edges (worn from use in jewelry, as shown by the perforation) probably led Allan and Mattingly to identify it as a Serbian imitation of a Venetian type rather than a product of the Venetian mint. But evidently neither the British authorities nor Van Buren turned the coin to the side where • S VdN^Tl is clearly vis- ible. Now recatalogued as a grosso of the Doge Lorenzo Tiepolo, this piece becomes the first in the Academy's Venetian holdings, no. 630. On the obverse, the figure of St. Mark, his head, halo, and clothing are well preserved (strangely, Van Buren thought him the Virgin!). On the reverse, the face 54 Hendy 1969, 161-163.

All but twenty of these were stored in a burlap bag and probably come from a hoard. The tornesello is a small (ca. 17 mm) billon coin minted in Venice for circulation in Venetian colonies in Greece and the Greek islands.56 It was designed to replace the Frankish denier tournois, a familiar unit in the colonies but not minted after 1350; Venice first authorized production of the tornesello in 1353. Throughout its manufacture, the tornesello remained consistent in type with only minor (and necessary) variations in legends. A random selection of 350 specimens from the Academy's torneselli showed the following at- tributions to doges whose reigns date from 1356 to 1413: Giovanni Dolfin (1356-1361) 2 Lorenzo Celsi (1361-1365) 3 Marco Corner (1365-1368) 5 Andrea Contarmi (1368-1382) 49 Michele Morosini (1382) 2 Antonio Venier (1382-1400) 229 Michele Steno (1400-1413) 4 Illegible 56 In fabric, general appearance, and details visible here and there, the majority of the 56 pieces listed as illegible resemble the catalogued torneselli of Antonio Venier. Thus, the figures stated here coincide with the patterns of major finds reported by A. M. Stahl.57 In all instances, torneselli minted under Venier far outnumber those from other reigns, and torneselli from the reign of Contarmi rank second in frequency. Production of torneselli fell off in the fifteenth century, and according to Stahl (2000, 403) "amounted to almost nothing" after 1423. If a thorough study of all 2,673 specimens should show the same pattern of attributions seen in the sample listed above, then a date ca. 1413 would be indicated for the hoard deposit. In the catalogue, full descriptions will be given for 60 of those surveyed.

No information on when or how this hoard of torneselli was acquired survives, but it seems likely that Van Buren purchased it in Athens at the same time as his other major acquisitions, in May 1912. One of the pieces stored in a separate envelope, no. 656: Andrea Contarmi, was bought, according to Van Buren s notation, at "Athens, May 1912 - large store on s. side Hermes St." Van Buren regarded this specimen as AR, and indeed its silver content appears unusually high for a tornesello.58 The handsomest tornesello among those catalogued is no. 637, inv. no. 10898: Lorenzo Celsi (fig. 9.1.21a-b). This coin is well centered, especially on the obverse, and survives in good condition. The lettering of Celsi's name is nicely spaced, elegant, and clear. The designer used the available surface with skill. In contrast, many torneselli of the later doge Venier seem carelessly manufactured. Two pieces show the surname misspelled (nos. 683 and 687 : venero instead of venerio), and on no. 687 the designer did not leave room for the whole of the word dvx. Only the letter X appears.59 In his monograph, Stahl supplies a table of major finds of torneselli. All known findspots lie within Greece and the islands, and the largest hoard, the Chalkis hoard, contains 4,783 torneselli.60 If the Academy's torneselli form a hoard, as seems likely, they rank second in number of coins. Because archaeologists at the American Academy have been interested primarily in Classical Studies and because all these torneselli are modest in appearance, no one thought to announce their existence in numismatic literature. Furthermore, since all published torneselli have been discovered in the Greek world, no expert would have expected to find them stored in Rome. Other Medieval Coins (Nos. 3308 and 3309) Van Buren left two coins labeled simply "Mediaeval." One of them is worn beyond recognition and has not been catalogued. But the other, one of the large number Van Buren acquired in Athens in 1912, can be identified: No. 3308: Follaro. 21-22 mm; 2.0 g. 11th century. AE (Billon? [silvery appearance]).

Colburns Donation : Coins from Lanuvio (Nos. 3310-3325 ) In 1910 a Fellow in the ASCSR, Guy Blanding Colburn, carried out a survey of Civita Lavinia, since renamed Lanuvio. Advised by Thomas Ashby of the British School at Rome and often accompa- nied by A. W. Van Buren, Colburn picked up occasional coins as he walked over the area.61 At the end of his project, he donated sixteen coins to the teaching collection. These, however, were never catalogued or entered in the inventory. Of the sixteen, I have been able to catalogue only five, one Greek, one Roman, and three papal. The entries for these may be found in the catalogue. The others are illegible; five of the eleven worn pieces look ancient to me, the other six medieval or later. Even the identifiable coins have suffered so much wear that it has been impossible to narrow the identification precisely (for instance, the antoninianus, no. 3311, has lost the margin where the mintmark appeared in exergue). Nevertheless, enough evidence survives to make the issues and types clear. United States (Nos. 3326-3331) In a metal jar are fourteen coins, apparently a random assortment of modern pieces from several countries. The most interesting are six coins from the United States. One of these is a "large cent" issued between 1800 and 1807 by the national mint at Philadelphia. It is extremely worn. Here is its full catalogue entry: No. 3326: USA.

H. Ten Eyck Burr. The photograph on p. 376 of the article showing Van Buren at Lanuvio and the text on the same page referring to Van Bürens help indicate that probably Colbum, Van Buren, and Burr were more than once a threesome on the site. Ashby seems to have gone carefully over Colburn s findings (see p. 1, n. 1).</page><page sequence="370">358 KATHERINE A. GEFFCKEN Designed by Robert Scot.

The other five American coins are private issues produced during the Civil War, mosdy by merchants for local exchange (nos. 3327-3331). They supplied urgendy needed pennies in a time when small coins were scarce. In size (19 mm) and metal (copper) they closely resemble the official Indian Head "small cent" issued by the United States mint beginning in 1859. Appearing mainly in northern communities, they sometimes carried patriotic messages or, more often, advertised a merchant s products. In April 1864 Congress passed a law prohibiting such tokens, and in June 1864 a second law forbidding all private coinage. The five tokens in the Academy's collection are: No. 3327 "Union 1861" (a patriotic token) No. 3328 1863 Jackson Hall, Jackson, Michigan (a grocer) No. 3329 1863 John Thomas, Albany, New York (coffee and spices) No. 3330 (no date) L.

Aes Rude The Academy collection also includes specimens of aes rude. Two of these were part of the bequest from Esther Van Deman: Inv. no. 2184: a chunk of bronze weighing 48.49 grams, roughly 35 mm wide, 50 mm long, and 22 mm deep, with a rough surface. Inv. no. 2185: a smaller chunk of bronze, weighing 26.88 grams, about 17 by 26, with a depth of 13 mm. Two other pieces were part of the Thomas Ashby gift. Ashby's notes indicate that these came from Ponte di Nona: Inv. no. 2448: an oblong piece of bronze weighing about 48 grams, 30 mm at its widest, 35 mm long, and 20 mm deep. Inv. no. 2449: an almost triangular shaped chunk weighing a litde over 50 grams, with dimen- sions approximately of 55 by 43 by 20 mm. Aes rude is generally dated in the sixth or fifth century B.c. In addition to these four inventoried specimens, the collection contains a plastic bag with an assortment of bronze slugs with no regular shape or design.62 62 See Thurlow and Vecchi 1979, 15, and pl. 2, who state that hoards of aes rude occur in votive deposits down into the fourth century B.c., especially in central Italy but also elsewhere in Italy and Sicily.</page><page sequence="371">COINS 359 Bibliography AAR Annual Report, 1914, 1915-1916, 1916-1917, 1922-1923.

Goldman The bronze, collection although of jewelry one of at the the fibulas American has what Academy may be in a Rome gold is inlay quite design modest. in the The bow pieces (inv. are no. mostly 5009; bronze, although one of the fibulas has what may be a gold inlay design in the bow (inv. no. 5009; fig. 9.2.1), and one of the bracelets has what may once have been some gilt, now much corroded (inv. no. 398; fig. 9.2.2). Though not exceptional in quality, the pieces give technological insights that make the collection valuable for study. The collection consists of fibulas, bracelets, rings (which may be finger rings or functional rings for clothing or other fabric use), pins, necklaces, and three bullae. There are two glass pieces, one an intact bracelet and the other half of a button (inv. nos. 2150 and 441). In the Academy's collection there are no examples of granulation, no exotic designs, no inscrip- tions or marks, and none of the rings has a stone inset. The bullae are simple and plain. None of the bracelets has animal-head terminals. The ancient owners of the Academy pieces were obviously of modest means. Many of the Academy's fibulas, bracelets, and rings, however, have comparanda among similar pieces drawn in the publication by Oscar Montelius in La civilization primitive en Italie / Series A and B. He dates most of the pieces to the seventh to fifth centuries B.c., loosely identified as Bronze, Etruscan, or Iron Age. There are also comparanda on display in the Villa Giulia Museum in Rome, where similar Etruscan finds date from the eighth to the fourth centuries B.c. Bronze fibulas from the Academy's collection are mostly varieties of the leech or bow type. Since these types in gold and silver are published in many important museum catalogues, it is valu- able to include as comparanda those fibulas, even when pieces from another museum are in more precious metals.2 Some of the pieces came into the collection from the Esther Van Deman bequest in 1937 (inv. nos. 1879-1884, 441, 1877, 1876, 1878, 1250, 1874); some came from the Thomas Ashby gift of 1924 (inv. nos. 4816, 4815 [fig. 9.2.6], 4817). Some have Arthur L. Frothingham as the source (inv. nos. 3979, 3978, 3981, 3980, 3982 [fig. 9.2.3]); but many have no source. Most have no provenance, making the attribution of origin and date difficult except as may be inferred from comparanda.3 When the comparable piece appears in gold or silver designed for nobles and rich merchants, one can assume that similarly shaped pieces were also made in bronze without decoration for the middle and lower classes. Such modest pieces would be used by civilians for everyday wear, by 1 Montelius 1895-1910. 2 The late Professor Phillip G. Fike (d. 1996), metalsmith from the Department of Art and Art History at Wayne State University in Detroit, Michigan, spent the last 25 years of his career researching the making of ancient Etruscan and Roman fibulae, repeating the technology in the production of modern duplicates of the ancient pins. During his last years, he graciously consented to add his technical expertise in forging, casting, and repoussé to the descriptions here, so that the method of construction can be defined as accurately as possible. There is no substitute for trying out the various methods in actual practice, casting metal into ingots, forging ingots into wire or sheet forms, and winding the wire into tight coils for springs. 3 For these sources, see above, pp. 56, 60-62, 65.</page><page sequence="374">362 NORMA W.

Piles of utilitarian bronze fibulas, similar to those in the Academy's collection, are now in storerooms awaiting classification and publication in museums such as the Florence Archaeological Museum, and heaps of them are on display in the Saalburg Museum on the Roman limes in Germany. They may have come from a foundry site or from an ancient storeroom. Some are intact; some are in fragments. The Academy's pieces belong to these bronze utilitarian types. Because these small objects, especially the fibulas, are extremely practical and easily transport- able, they could have been sent as trade goods to various parts of the Roman world or worn by officials, ordinary citizens, soldiers, and servants; we find them in bronze at the Roman German museums in the limes such as at Mainz and Cologne, where they appear along with examples in gold and silver. These pieces have been excavated from military sites on the limes or from civilian towns that grew up alongside them. On the other hand, the items in the Academy's collection come from unidentified sites, with only one group, undated, listed as a tomb find.4 This is the Arthur L. Frothingham gift mentioned earlier (inv. nos. 3979, 3978 [fig. 9.2.4], 3981, 3980, 3982 [fig. 9.2.3]). Even if the Etruscan prototypes for these specimens date from the seventh-sixth centuries b.c., the pieces themselves could have been made at any date in the first millennium B.c., and even into the first centuries A.D., since the same types of jewelry appear in provinces on the Roman frontier during the Empire. 4 From a tomb near Anagni (described in a letter by Man- cinelli, May 1913).</page><page sequence="375">ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN JEWELRY 363 In manufacturing ancient Roman and Etruscan jewelry, especially fibulas, clearly the craftsman/ metalworker knew and practiced many techniques to create objects in a variety of metals, one of the most practical being bronze. An alloy of copper and tin, bronze was widely used to make sculptural, decorative, and utilitarian objects. The ancient craftsman combined the (molten) metals in proper proportions by melting them and then pouring them into a mold in which they would cool and solidify as an ingot. This process would develop a crystalline structure in the ingot that lacked the ductile and malleable properties the craftsman needed to practice his art. But it was the craftsman's forging that made it either ductile or malleable by swedging (hammering into a grooved anvil) the metal into wire or by hammering it in a sheet on a flat surface. One of the enduring mysteries of ancient metalworking is the craftsman's command of met- alworking skills and tools observed in forms with extended lengths of tapered wire, especially in coils and disk spirals. The ancient craftsman did not have the technology of draw-plate wire production, or rolling-mill plate-making, both used by hand and machine today. Yet he was able to cast an ingot bar and forge it hot or cold by hammering it into a long rod and then into finer wire, all this executed with much labor, time, skill, and understanding of heat treatment (annealing). The bracelets (see inv. no. 398; fig. 9.2.2) and rings (see inv. no. 3982; fig. 9.2.3) in the Academy's collection could have been either cast or wrought by hammering, but a wrought piece is more practical if there is to be stress since a cast piece with crystalline structure is not flexible. A piece of bronze, hammer forged, could be made into a wire or plate that would not crack or break while being bent, and it could be wound tightly into a small diameter spring coil used for fibulas (inv. no. 3978; fig. 9.2.4). R. A. Higgins, former Assistant Keeper of Greek and Roman Antiquities in the British Mu- seum, suggests the following broad periods for dating Etruscan and Roman jewelry: Early Etruscan: 700-400 b.c., Late Etruscan: 400-250 B.c., Hellenistic: 330-27 b.c., Roman: 27 b.c.-a.d. 400.5 Higgins identifies six types of early Etruscan fibulas, describing a continuous history of fibulas from the Late Bronze Age in Italy, when the simple forms were developed, probably from the Villanovans. The Etruscans then took over these types of everyday bronze varieties, producing elaborately decorated pieces in gold and sometimes in silver. These "baroque" and "rococo" versions of the more basic bronze forms show a high degree of technical skill in granulation, casting, repousse, and forging. But for the most part, these types remain versions of Higgins 's six basic styles, four of which appear in the Academy collection:6 1. The serpentine type is a Villanovan product in which the bow is bent into a convoluted variety of shapes, often with knobs and thickenings. Sometimes the fibula is even further decorated with animal and/or vegetal figures applied to the bow. In the Academy's collec- tion there is only one animal example, and it has been classified as a simple Leech Type with the entire bow formed into an animal body. Therefore we have listed it under style 4 below, zoomorphic (inv. no. 1877; fig. 9.2.7). Only inv. no. 3978 (fig. 9.2.4) could be con- sidered Serpentine, although we have also classified it as a leech with a double arched bow. 5 Higgins 1961. These periodic distinctions are the tides for Higgins 's chapters. 6 Higgins 1961, 144-148. His nos. 5 and 6 do not appear in the Academy's collection. Comb-type fibulae were found in the Bernardini and Barberini tombs and in other sites in the Etruscan world. They are usually in silver, parcel-gilt (partly gilded), and have a central element of a continuous tube running in parallel lines like the teeth of a comb down the center. They are dated seventh century B.c. Boat-type fibulae, similarly dated, have two sets of horizontal tubes, the first one curving downward at one end, the second curving upward at the other end, with long pins protruding from the straight ends of the outer tubes at the top. There are likewise no spiral, pincer, or spectacle fibulae in the Academy's collection, types not catalogued by Higgins.</page><page sequence="376">364 NORMA W. GOLDMAN Fig. 9.2.5 ( above left).

Inv. no. 395 has such a broad, flat bow with the catch-plate on one side underneath on the bottom of the foot. 3. The leech type , boat- or bow-shaped, also originally Villanovan, with many variations in the seventh century, has a bow, high or low, thickened to resemble a leech or a boat. The bow may be slender (inv. nos. 4816 [fig. 9.2.5] and 1876) or thick, solid or hollow, some- times drawn out in the middle into points (inv. nos. 4815 [fig. 9.2.6] and 4817), which may occasionally have knobs (inv. nos. 395 and 3981). The foot may be short, with the catch-plate bent up around the needle, or it may be long, and in the sixth century B.c. this long type often had a knob or a ram s head at the end. At times it even had a double bow, as in the Academy's inv. no. 3978. Seven out of the ten fibulas in the Academy's collection are of the leech type. 4. The zoomorphic type , with the bow in the form of an animal, as in inv. no. 1877 (fig. 9.2.7), is also dated to the sixth century B.c. In scholarship on pins, brooches, and fibulas, there is no consistency in the use of these words, and a note concerning them is appropriate. For instance, the British often refer to all types of fas- tenings as brooches, and Richard Hattatt,7 cataloging selected pieces in his collection, calls such fasteners "brooches." Similarly the catalogues from the British Museum use the word "brooch" for what is generally called a fibula. We have preferred to use the term "fibula" for a fastening with a pin and a bow where the spring and catch-plate elements are visible. Where the entire pin is a shaped element - circular, lozenge, or rectangular, with the catch-plate hidden underneath - we have then applied the word "brooch." This word also appears as the customary name for the circular- shaped open pin with a shaft wrapped around one side and extending across the open space to the other side of the circle, the "penannular brooch." That these are all pins of some sort creates a problem, but in applying the word "pin," we refer to the straight variety, a shaft pointed at one end with a thickening, knob, or decoration at the other. While the Academy collection contains several such 7 Hattatt 1985 and 1987.</page><page sequence="377">ETRUSCAN AND ROMAN JEWELRY 365 Fig. 9.2.9. Bronze bulla with chain (inv. no. 1881). Fig. 9.2.10. Flalfofa button (inv. no. 441). straight pins in bronze for hair or clothes (inv. nos. 1875, 1875 [fig. 9.2.8], 4818), it in fact includes more specimens in bone and ivory. The word "bulla" denotes a round or heart-shaped locket or box containing an amulet or charm, hanging from a necklace or chain, given to a freeborn Roman child shortly after birth and kept as a talisman against evil. It could be made of gold or silver for the child of a wealthy family, but it could also be in bronze, as are the ones in the Academy collection. One of many conventions inherited from the Etruscans, wearing gold bullae was a privilege extended originally to children of patricians, but when wealthy plebeians could afford such luxuries, it became customary for that privilege to extend to the children of other affluent citizens. Bullae made of leather may also have been given to children of poorer families and freedmen. Some of the highly decorative gold bullae with elaborate granulation, published in various museum catalogues, were probably ornate necklace pendants and did not serve the same symbolic function as the bulla given at birth. The bullae in the Academy collection are poor relatives of the ornate ones in gold or silver, but they are interesting for the technology of construction that they illustrate quite clearly. All three of these bronze bullae (inv. nos. 1881 [fig. 9.2.9], 1882, 1884) were cut from sheet metal in the shape of a figure 8 with a long neck between the two circles, which were then stretch-formed hollow, probably hammered into a wooden form, a technique called "sinking." When the narrow connecting neck was bent around a rod, a method clearly indicated in the Academy bullae, the two concave circles met to form the hollow round pendant. Inv. no. 1881 (fig. 9.2.9) in the collection has the edges crimped and cut, like a piecrust. The hollow tube formed around the rod accom- modated the chain or necklace. Two of the bullae (inv. nos. 1881 [fig. 9.2.9] and 1882) were found still hanging from their short chain necklaces made from sections of wire circles, a form of chain necklace common in Etruscan times. There are two possible glass pieces catalogued here: an intact bracelet (inv. no. 3) in dark glass (or other substance) and half of a button (inv. no. 441; fig. 9.2.10). A second button of bone (inv. no. 445) is pierced in the center by a bronze pin.</page><page sequence="378">366 NORMA W.

Notes on Othet Categories and Materials Published Elsewhere The contributors all prepared the database entries for their categories, from which they chose the most interesting items for their Highlights. Other scholars compiled catalogues on material not presented here, while a few categories have been published elsewhere. Though the essays in this volume cover most of the collection, certain categories, such as gem impressions, appear only on the database. The database will eventually cover all of the objects in the Academy's collection. The following are brief descriptions of some of the categories of material prepared for the database but not included in this volume. [Eds.] Miscellaneous Metal and Bone Objects (Lawrence Bliquez and Alain Gowing) The authors of this section submitted a catalogue of the 47 miscellaneous instruments in the collection. We reproduce their introduction to this category here. [Eds.] In data the given spring for of them 1998 Alain depends Gowing on his personally observations examined and information all of the items secured catalogued from the here. inventories The basic data given for them depends on his observations and information secured from the inventories and inventory cards kept by the American Academy. One change has been made in the information so supplied. Where the material of an item is described as "bronze," it is regularly replaced by the term "copper alloy"; it is impossible to distinguish bronze from brass at sight, and there is no reason to believe that the metal composition of these objects has ever been analyzed. Included in this section are 47 items of copper alloy, iron, and bone.1 Of these, fifteen have been classed in the Academy inventories as "Surgical Instruments."2 The other 32 are designated as having served diverse domestic or professional purposes. The "Surgical Instruments" were probably originally classified as such because spatulas, ligulas, spoon probes, etc. have traditionally been regarded as surgical instruments. But in fact few, if any, of the items catalogued here ever were included in a surgeon's instrumentarium. The Greco-Roman surgeon had available instruments such as specula, cauteries, and special scalpels and forceps that would unlikely have been of use to those engaged in other trades. How- ever, a significant portion of his instrumentarium consisted of items that were employed in other crafts and likewise in the home. In short, what the classical physician found practical as a surgical tool might have been just as useful in a shop or as a cosmetic item on a Roman lady's dressing table. For this reason objects like ligulas, spatulas, needles, spoons, and tweezers ought never to be identified as instruments of surgery unless they are found in association with other indisputably 1 We are grateful to our graduate students Rosalba Ciampi and Christina Vester, who assisted in the examination of this material. 2 Inv. nos. 405, 406, 1888, 408, 1891, 409, 1890, 1889, 407, 1892, 1893, 1897, 1250, 1298, 1861.</page><page sequence="380">368 NOTES ON OTHER CATEGORIES AND MATERIALS PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE Fig. 9.3.1. Ligula with sharp hook (inv. no. 1891). Fig. 9.3.2. Double ligula (inv. no. 1892). surgical instruments such as those mentioned above. The best contexts for determining surgical use are those we term "closed" - that is, contexts such as physicians' graves, or Pompeian houses where a surgical instrumentarium is unlikely to have been contaminated by nonsurgical material. This means that provenance is an extremely important factor in determining whether a puta- tively surgical instrument like a ligula is in fact likely to have been employed by an ancient doctor or pharmacist. When provenance is unknown, this cannot be confirmed. Unfortunately, lack of provenance is the case with every item in this section, none of which falls into the category of ob- jects immediately recognizable as exclusively surgical. While many of them certainly would have been found useful by a physician, the very fact that there are in the collection no scalpels, cauter- ies, bleeding cups, or specula, with which at least some of the Academy's objects might have been recovered, is a strong indication that these pieces were never employed for anything other than domestic purposes. Exceptions maybe inv. no. 1891 (fig. 9.3.1), a ligula equipped at one end with a sharp hook, and inv. no. 1892 (fig. 9.3.2), a double ligula with one of the spoons surmounting several undulations, as though the head and neck of a snake were intended. If so, the snake may symbolize the healing god Aesculapius, which would mean that this ligula was designed with medical/pharmaceutical purposes in mind. Bibliographical references to the uses to which these pieces might have been put in the home or shop, as well as to surgical applications - when a particular type is known to have been employed in medicine or pharmacy - are included with the comparanda cited for individual entries. Close comparanda could not be found in every case, and in some cases none at all are available. Traditionally (and understandably) minor objects have not attracted the attention lavished on, for instance, sculpture, vases, and mosaics. For this reason only a fraction of those objects that survive have been properly published and can therefore be used as parallel pieces. One motive for present- ing the 47 items catalogued here is to augment the known material and supply useful comparison pieces for other interested scholars. We can provide the following information about the introduction of these forty-seven pieces into the collection of the Academy's museum. Thirteen3 are listed in Harmon's inventory of 1907. So these objects had to have been present at that time. According to Harmon, they were part of the loan made by Richard Norton, who acquired material from time to time in Rome and also on trips to Tunis, Egypt, and Turkey. Harmon is no more specific than that about the origins of any of the pieces loaned by Norton. The other 34 items catalogued appear only in the later and more extensive 3 Inv. nos. 404-409, 410-412, and 429^32.</page><page sequence="381">NOTES ON OTHER CATEGORIES AND MATERIALS PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE 369 inventory, the ledger compiled by A. W. Van Buren between 1924 and 1959. All of this material4 is recorded as coming in by way of the Van Deman bequest. As with Norton's contribution, we are in the dark as to the provenances of the pieces donated by Van Deman. Presumably, she acquired most of them from antiquities dealers in Rome, but unfortunately we cannot be more precise. All that can be said is that Van Buren entered these objects in his ledger on 23 July 1941, so that they had become part of the collection by that date at the latest. We also know, from Van Buren 's notes on an " Antiquarium" of minor objects that he arranged at the Academy in 1946, that most of them were included in the material exhibited.5 Although we know approximately when the items catalogued here came to the Academy, establishing their ancient chronology is a different matter. As stated, no provenances are recorded for any of these minor objects in the Academy records, a fact that bears direcdy on the problem. Unfortunately, these objects belong in the main to classes of instruments that changed their shapes but little from the fourth century B.c. on. Therefore, without knowledge of the contexts in which they were found, it is impossible to give them anything like precise dates. Since the closest com- paranda that can be produced for some of them date between the first and fourth centuries of our era, the majority, if not all of them, were probably manufactured and used within this wide range of time. That is as far as we can go. 4Inv. nos. 1888-1891, 1242-1247, 1892, 1894, 1222-2224, 1226-1228, 1887, 1239-1241- 1893, 1895-1897, 1250, 1298, 1258, 1861, 1863-1866.

Glass bottle from the Van Deman collection (inv. no. 2131). Fig. 9.3.4. Composite mosaic glass fragment from the Elihu Vedder collection (inv. no. 4123). Glass The American Academy collection includes approximately 315 glass fragments and eleven whole glass objects. The late David Grose worked on this collection , but his untimely death prevented him from finishing his catalogue. Katherine Geffcken has kindly provided the following brief hut very helpful essay on the Academy's glass collection. [Eds.] Ancient glass entered the Study Collection often among batches of pottery: occasionally almost intact bottles, alabastra or aryballoi, but most frequently fragments of glass. Among the donors were Esther Van Deman, Albert Van Buren, and Thomas Ashby. The Van Deman bequest, for instance, included an arm ring, twisted glass rods, several alabastra, and a handsome large, clear bottle (inv. nos. 2150-2170, except 2163, which was discarded in 1948). The large bottle, inv. no. 2151 (fig. 9.3.3) is now featured in one of the display cases of the Norton/Van Buren Room. Two other, small green alabastra with broken necks have been in the collection since the formative years under Richard Norton (Harmon catalogue 500, 501; inv. nos. 442, 443). The only pieces with recorded findspots are inv. no. 2590, which came in the huge deposit Ashby collected at Ponte di Nona, and inv. nos. 3608 and 3613, fragments that Van Buren picked up "on the Janiculum towards Monteverde" on 21 September 1944. The most interesting part of the glass, however, is Elihu Vedder's collection of exquisite frag- ments of composite mosaic and striped glass. An American painter, Vedder (1836-1923) spent long years of his mature life in Rome, always hard at work but also keeping an eye on the early Fellows in painting at the American Academy. When the Academy moved to the Janiculum, Vedder donated much of his equipment - easels, paints, etc. - to the new studios. After his death, his daughter Anita gave to the Study Collection his eleven interlocking trays of glass (inv. no. 4123: originally 416 pieces) (fig. 9.3.4) and six interlocking trays containing coins and gems (inv. no. 4122). Like his friend and fellow painter Charles Caryl Coleman, who lived at Capri,6 Vedder enjoyed the vibrant colors of the glass patterns and the gemlike quality of the fragments. In his Digressions o/V (1910), 6 Grose 1989, 222-223, and esp. 243, fig. 115. 7 Vedder 1910, 2:3 17. Grose (30) recommends using the term "mosaic glass" instead of "millefiori." The latter term is a later Venetian name not really applicable to the wide variety of ancient glass patterns.</page><page sequence="383">NOTES ON OTHER CATEGORIES AND MATERIALS PUBLISHED ELSEWHERE 37 1 Vedder remarks, "I have started little collections of casts of antique gems, intaglios, and coins, and of fragments of ancient mille-fiori glass, and other things too numerous to mention."7 References Grose, D.

Architectural Elements - Stone Joanne Spurza organized and catalogued the Academy's substantial collection of architectural elements in stone. The 184 examples in this category include column capitals (Doric, Ionic, Corin- thian Composite, and Other), pier and pilaster capitals, column and pilaster bases, column shafts, entablatures (cornice, frieze, architrave, and moldings), various railing and balustrade grills, and brackets and consoles. All are presented in the online database. Millstones Andrew Wilson prepared the entries for the collection s two millstones (inv. nos. 9474 and 9476). He points out the similarities between the two stones and fragments of others discovered in close proximity to the main building of the Academy when Malcolm Bell excavated a water-mill complex in the Via Medici in 1990-1991 See M.
