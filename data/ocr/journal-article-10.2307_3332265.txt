<plain_text><page sequence="1">Humanistic Linguistics HENRY and RENEE KAHANE 1. Introduction The linguist of our age is a man of many trades. He is a structuralist and a comparatist, a historian, sociologist, anthropologist, psychologist, neurolo- gist, logician, mathematician, and computer programmer. We shall describe him in still another of his roles, that of a humanist. Humanistic linguistics is in itself a field of sundry facets, all quite familiar under various labels. We shall try to describe them as a unified field with its characteristic prob- lems-always solved and always unsolved. The stretches in the broad spectrum of humanism which are of rele- vance to the linguist fall within the area of humanism known as paideia, the intellectual formation of Western man,' the tradition, in Werner Jae- ger's formulation2 of the timeless Greek Bildungsidee. They deal essentially with the analysis of those particular features of paideia which find expres- sion in language. Language, in other words, is a mirror of man's heritage and of his link with the past; it echoes the zeitgeist and the view of other cultures; it symbolizes, in its various forms, collective or individual creativ- ity and our intellectual freedom. Just as language reflects man, so man re- flects language and is influenced by it; and our experience with and our relation to language stimulate the incessant responses which we label attitudes. Henry Kahane is Professor Emeritus of Linguistics and of the Center for Advanced Study at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. With his wife and lifelong collaborator, Renee Kahane, he is the author of over 175 publications, including several books. Henry and Renee Kahane received honorary doctorates from the Uni- versity of Illinois in 1977 in recognition of their distinguished careers. The lecture was presented by Henry Kahane on April 24, 1979, and was first published in Con- temporary Studies in Romance Languages (Proceedings of the Eighth Annual Sym- posium on Romance Languages), edited by Frank H. Nuessel, Jr. (Bloomington: Indiana University Linguistics Club, 1980), pages 159-82; it is reprinted here with permission.

We shall first retrace the genesis of the varied strands of our dis- cipline through five stages-five Western Renaissances-and then show how the patrimony is faring at our hands. 2. The Carolingian Renaissance With the decline of the Latin tradition and the influx of the allophonous Germanic tribes, the language situation in the areas of the former Empire called for a new standard for Church and administration. A revived Latin filled the gap. The rejuvenation of (or simply the return to) Latin could best be accomplished by those whose vernacular was not a "corrupt" Latin (as in the case of speakers of proto-Romance) but a dissimilar lan- guage; they could teach or learn without the interference of native habits. The central figure of Charlemagne's Schola Palatina was, from 787 on, Alcuin, from York. His achievement as a promotor of Latin was formid- able, indeed, and the values whose foundations he laid are still in force.4 In a period of ignorance and neglect he stressed, as the primary goal, the ideal of correctness. Correct Latin, to Alcuin, was equivalent to rea- son, authority, and norm. By teaching, within his Christian scope, an ap- preciation of the classical authors, he strengthened a feeling for tradition. By insisting on a knowledge of Latin for a powerful sector of society, the monastic elite and the clergy, he contributed both in the practice of religion and in ecclesiastic administration to the fixing of strata of education ex- pressed by linguistic levels, Latin and the vernacular, second language and first language, H[igh] and L[ow] in Ferguson's terminology.5 Alcuin's work in the Palace School had its impact on the education of the ninth and tenth centuries; his effort was carried on by the new centers of Latin training, monastery schools such as Fulda, Corbie, Reichenau, and St. Gal- len. Language as the distinctive feature of societal structure remained the possession and mark of Western civilization. Latin remained the paragon up to the Italian Renaissance; it was replaced thereafter by the evolving Latinized standard.6 The contribution of this early phase to permanent linguistic practice is weighty.7 Within the framework of a distinction between H and L, the text becomes the source and model of language, and the grammar implicit in the text is seen as a means to reach the meaning and thus the exegesis of the text, the theological exegesis, that is, of the Bible. The attention to grammar turns into an acceptance of grammatical categories and a gram- matical system, and, through the habit of sentence-by-sentence reading</page><page sequence="3">Humanistic Linguistics 67 and word-by-word paraphrasing, the sentence assumes its dominating role. The humanistic impact rests in the extraordinary real and symbolic role of Latin, which dominates in the early forms of paideia. Latin, as a vehicle to perpetuate a glorious past into the present, represents historicity; as the idiom to mold minds for centuries to come, it represents relativity; as the yardstick to measure education and status, it represents attitude. 3. The Twelfth-Century Renaissance Scholastic methods and the return, through translation, of Greek science to the West resulted in a heightened attention to problems of language.8 Grammar, rhetoric, and lexicology were fostered. The study of grammar was based on the reading of classical authors; it not only facilitated access to the literary text, but it became, as the road to the elite language, a goal in itself. Rhetoric was what we may call applied linguistics. It focused on teaching the skill of composing letters for official, legal, and business pur- poses; it was called ars dictaminis, and the author of any manual of the trade was named the man who dictates, dictator. Style was, in short, epis- tolary style. Lexicology, the study of the word per se, aroused interest. Etymology referred particularly to a digging out of Greek roots; the lexi- con of Papias (twelfth century) combined the dictionary with the ency- clopedia; and descriptive vocabularies, as e.g. the one by Adam du Petit- Pont, master at Paris (early twelfth century), which explained the meaning of a word through its context, were created. Translations flourished.9 The reception of Greek texts in the West was two-pronged. In Southern Italy, where Greek was endemic, bilinguals (i.e., speakers of Graecanic and Romance) translated the texts directly into Latin. In Spain (and mutatis mutandis in Southern France) the process was complex: Greek texts (which had often gone through the intermediate stages of Syriac or Hebrew) were available in Arabic; these were translated, usually by bilingual Jews or Mozarabs, from Arabic into oral Spanish, and the oral Spanish was then written down in Latin by the ultimate Christian translator. The basis of the technique was the strictest literalness, word by word. The translator was (as Opelt' 0 points out for Gerhard of Cremona) the fidus interpres, who believed that his literalness, his ignoring the text as a whole, guaranteed the perfect preservation of the original thought. Lexemic equivalence was often based on the "original semantic core of words," both source words and target words. Opelt' I sees in this facet of medieval translation a semantic overloading of the Grundbedeutung. The linguistic practices, then, of the Twelfth-Century Renaissance, ap- plied to such areas as epistolography, lexicology, and translation, add great- ly to various approaches to language (here, Latin, of course), which are still part and parcel of humanistic linguistics: stylistics, etymology, and the</page><page sequence="4">68 Henry and Renee Kabane theory of translation. 4. The Italian Renaissance The problems of life-style facing the humanists in the fifteenth century, the era of their greatest glamor, were closely tied to language; and many of these problems have remained characteristic, in principle, of the life-style of Western society. The humanists represented an elitist stratum of society, and that elitism was expressed by the most powerful class symbol, language. Their language was Latin, a revived classical Latin; and it was precisely their knowledge of Latin that enabled them to understand the texts directly without the inter- vening activity of theologians or the official interpretation of medieval tradition. This resulted in that new current of the individual's intellectual freedom which we label a liberal education.12 With mastery of the text, the cult of the text and of the manuscript was born; this remained for centuries a dominant feature of philology, above all, in the domain of clas- sical scholarship. The dichotomy of language levels, elitist Latin and general vernacular, brings to the humanist certain vital features of language as personal experi- ences: the acquisition of a second language, Latin, on the two levels of form and meaning, metbodice and bistorice respectively;1 3 the formula- tion, in the handling of the vernacular, of rules abstracted from the linguis- tic habits of the modelli scholastici, the great Florentine writers, who estab- lished the concept of authority;1 4 the intuitive understanding of problems of bilingualism, implicit in the juxtaposition of the prestige language, con- sciously learned, and the vernacular, unconsciously absorbed; the diachronic approach to language resulting from imitation of the models of ages past;' 1 and the fusion of language and culture inherent in the ubiquity of cultural features in the prestige language.' 6 On the other hand, the inevitable rise of the middle class tended to make the volgare respectable. The adaptation of the humanists to this linguistic revaluation, the umanesimo volgare,"7 became the base of the new stan- dards, in Italy and elsewhere.' 8 The process of transformation was dramat- ically evident in that famous episode in the history of attitudes, the Que- stione della lingua. The humanists debated the merits inherent in each of three linguistic levels striving for acceptance as the standard: the archaizing, the koine of the courts, or the dialect of Tuscany. The answer was a com- promise. 5. Neo-Humanism The primarily German Renaissance which reached from the latter part of the eighteenth into the early nineteenth century and is often subsumed</page><page sequence="5">Humanistic Linguistics 69 under the heading of Klassik und Romantik, was dominated, in linguistic matters, by Wilhelm von Humboldt, still worshipped in many of our mod- ern endeavors as the father figure. Classic and romantic strands are inter- woven in the genesis of his hypotheses; Humboldt's classical training and erudition (his Altbertumskunde) was a fruitful soil for his linguistic think- ing.' 9 His romantic interpretations echoed Herder (1744-1803): whereas man's capacity for language is universal, the individuality of each language is the particular property of the nation, and the language and thought of a people are inseparable.20 To Herder, "every nation speaks . . according to the way it thinks."21 Eva Fiesel synthesizes: "If the fundamental theme of Romanticism is incessant metamorphosis [transformationalism is to her a romantic inclination] and the mystery behind it, an inner, a metaphysical language, Humboldt aims at revealing the constant and typical of the meta- morphic process."2 2 Gipper isolates the three basic concepts of Humboldt's linguistic creed that are fundamentally humanistic: (1) Language creates our worldview; each language, in its particular way, through its categories, semantic fields, syntactic models, transposes the world into thought. (2) Language is not ergon but energeia, not static but dynamic; the debated concept of energeia refers, one assumes, to man's creative ability, the cognitive process, the self-realization of the ego. (3) Language has an innere Sprachform, inner form, often explained as system, but to Gipper the semantic feature of language.2 3 These hypotheses had their impact on linguistic theory. Herder's and Humboldt's belief in the close relationship between nation and language was reflected in the rising method of historical analysis; Jacob Grimm, e.g., interpreted the soundshift as an early assertion of independence by the an- cestors of the German peoples.24 The great classicist and educator, Fried- rich August Wolf (1759-1824), advocated the acquisition of a second lan- guage (Greek, of course, for him) as a means, within the frame of an individual's harmonious development, for "the perfection of our concepts and the elucidation of our thinking."25 6. Impressionism and Idealism At the turn of the nineteenth into our own century, the great artistic and intellectual movement of Impressionism strongly influenced attitudes to- ward language. The impressionistic approach was at the base of the great era of linguistic analysis which concentrates on what we today call the sur- face. Giulio Bertoni's program of idealistic philology (as presented by Christmann)2 6 gave the essential articles of faith: Language, in the climate of fin-de-siecle elitism, was considered an object of esthetic analysis; lan- guage was defined as expression, as art, as geist; the creative role of the individual in linguistic change was extolled; and the hypothesis of the mu-</page><page sequence="6">70 Henry and Renee Kabane tual interplay of language and national culture was reasserted. These were, roughly, the tenets of the linguistic school labelled Idealism. Two great European intellectuals, creators of and thinkers about lan- guage, formulated characteristic maxims of the idealistic program. Hof- mannsthal commented on language as the national essence: "We grope for means to grasp the soul of a nation, and doubt overcomes us as to whether a concept such as this can ever be brought down to concrete terms. But here, in language, something real speaks to us and permeates us: it is the elementary force in which we participate."2 7 Paul Valery discussed the rights of the writer in respect to language: "Literature ... tends to create a poetic language separate from ordinary language. The differentiation is inevitable since the functions of both words and means of expressions are not the same. . . . There should be-and there is-a necessary contrast... between the writer and the linguist."2 8 Valery defended his uncommon use of diaeresis in delici-eux by stating succinctly: "Sometimes Ingres lengthened the neck of his odalisques.... Everyone functions in his way."' 29 The dominant figures of the truly humanistic School of Idealism were stars, indeed, of early twentieth-century linguistics. Uitti and Christmann have presented excellent analyses of the movement. (a) Croce insisted on the hypothesis of man's linguistic creativity and the esthetic function of language: "We don't just learn the language we speak, we learn how to create it ... language changes from individual to individual."30 With the principle of personal creativity he renewed Hum- boldt's concept of energeia. Language is expressive, and expressiveness is governed by an esthetic system.31 (b) Vossler's linguistic creed32 had a double focus: first, language as representative of art, and language history as art history; second, language as the reflector of spiritual and cultural conditions, and linguistics as the study of the relation of language to culture. (c) Three etymologists were characteristic of the movement: Schu- chardt, Gillieron, Sainean. Schuchardt's word histories are showpieces of cultural history; the method of Words and Things was born. Gillieron was the master of linguistic biology or, to be more exact, of linguistic Darwin- ism. Seeing that words become weak, die, and are replaced, he analyzed lexemic pathology and therapeutics. Weakness was the result of ambiguity, and ambiguity could derive from phonological attrition, homonymy, or polysemy; the remedy lay in creative transmutation.3 3 Sainean elaborated the indigenous (i.e., neither inherited nor borrowed) factors in the speak- er's creative transmutation of his lexicon: semantic association,34 phono- logical innovation,35 and morphological blending.36 (d) Spitzer, the European impressionist transplanted to America, was, as an antimaterialist, antimechanist, antipositivist, in Hytier's characteriza- tion,37 a modern humanist. He was the master of a literary analysis which</page><page sequence="7">Humanistic Linguistics 71 was based on a writer's stylistic peculiarities. A deviation, anchored in a creative, distinctive, even "ungrammatical" element, revealed to him the hidden meaning of a literary work.38 (e) Linguistic relativity: the Sapir-Whorf hypothesis. Herder's idea that a nation's thinking was shaped by its language was revived by two Ameri- can scholars, Edward Sapir and Benjamin Whorf. Sapir wrote that "the 'real world' is to a large extent unconsciously built up on the language habits of the group."'39 Whorf was in agreement: "The background lin- guistic system (in other words, the grammar) of each language ... is itself the shaper of ideas, the program and guide for the individual's mental activity. ... ."40 A few examples, selected for their typicalness rather than their persua- siveness, may illustrate the practice which complemented the theory of the Idealists. (a) Eugen Lerch, a disciple of Vossler's, investigated the phases in French word order: the relatively free, synthetic word order of the Middle Ages to the Renaissance, considered a reflection of indigenous traits such as imagination and impulsivity, was replaced, in the seventeenth and eight- eenth centuries, by a logical, analytic order, a reflection of rationalism; the latter was imposed, through the pressure of educated grammarians, on the common language only to give way again, since about 1850, to freer forms.41 (b) Gillibron viewed Fr. fermer 'to shut' (from firmare 'to se- cure') as being related in the speaker's mind to Fr. fer 'iron', i.e., inter- preted as 'to shut or lock by means of an iron'. Gillieron, in short, by be- coming the spokesman of popular imagination, replaced a diachronic ety- mology by a synchronic one within the French system.42 (c) The causa- tive conjunction in Charles-Louis Philippe's Bubu de Montparnasse (1905) was viewed by Spitzer as an expression of pseudo-objective motivation; and in this sense he generalized the mens Philippina to the mens Franco- Gallica of the twentieth century. The writer's linguistic innovations re- flected the nation's mental change.43 (d) In an analysis of Diderot's arti- cle "Jouissance" for the French Encyclopedie, Spitzer correlated the stylistic patterning of the text with phases of sexual togetherness: brief relative clauses and parallel staccato sentences echo the orgasm; lorsque with the passe simple, the state of relaxation; impersonal on, less eventful marital life.44 Not surprisingly, the impressionistic methods of the Idealists aroused skepticism. Heilmann has phrased the dilemma succinctly: "Ideology and scientific method are in perennial opposition."45 The following instances of doubt were typical. Apropos of Vossler's great experiment, Frankreichs Kultur im Spiegel seiner Sprachentwicklung (1913), Schu rr stated that the coordination of a symbol to a spiritual phenomenon was bound to be arbi- trary.46 Vossler's concrete explanation, e.g., of the genesis of the partitive article in thirteenth- and fourteenth-century French as the result of a busi-</page><page sequence="8">72 Henry and Renee Kahane ness mentality, failed to convince even those who were favorably disposed toward the principle involved.47 Schiirr sketched the portrait of the new linguist, the scholar as an artist with intuition and creative power.4 8 Uitti, in the same vein, commenting on Spitzer, judged that his method, in the hands of a less dazzling analyst, would turn into a non-method.49 The etymological suggestions of Sainean and Gillibron were not accepted by the standard-bearers of traditional etymology: only about a fifth of Saine- an's and a bare sixth of Gillibron's have found grace.5 o Today, the growth of a rationalist belief in language universals coincides with the decline of a belief in linguistic relativity.5 1 7. Our Times: Expressionism and Structuralism We have outlined the course of European Bildung as it appears from a linguistic angle. In the five Renaissances of the Western world a consider- able patrimony of humanistic experience with insight into, and attitudes toward language has accumulated. It has been a living patrimony, reshaped by each period, according to its style of life, of intellectualism, of scientif- ic methods. How then does the present, our complex late twentieth cen- tury, continue the tradition? A contrast between the last stage and ours highlights the problems. The style of our times becomes discernible with the period of World War I. Impressionism glides into Expressionism. Impressionism was the cult of the visible; Expressionism, in art, in literature, in philosophy of life, is directed precisely toward the hidden. The evolving style of linguistics com- monly labelled structuralism, parallels, of course, general style. The new approach takes roots quickly: Saussure, the Prague Circle, Copenhagen, the Linguistic Society of America. Essentially, the several schools share a dualistic method of analysis on the two planes of the hidden and the visi- ble: system and realization, langue and parole, -emes and -etics, in posse and in esse, deep structure and surface. In ways which strike at the heart of Humanism, structuralism clashes with the Idealism of Crocean vintage.5 2 Idealism centers on the personal form, the artistic aspect, and the realization; structuralism aims at the uni- versal, the social aspect, and the system. According to Timpanaro, the Italian classicist and Marxist humanist, the clash between the Idealists and the Saussurians is part of a twentieth-century Querelle centering on the opposition, concrete or abstract. To the idealist-historicists it is historical concreteness vs. naturalistic abstractness; to the structuralists it is abstract- ness as the essential feature of scientific knowledge vs. an intuitionist and vulgarly empirical pseudo-knowledge.53 Christmann, while similarly con- trasting the Idealists and the Generativists, finds however common ground.54 He describes the former as maintaining a concept of language centered on</page><page sequence="9">Humanistic Linguistics 73 rule-changing creativity, while the latter conceive of language as based on rule-governed creativity, and he is reminded of Vossler's binomial, Sprache als Schopfung und Entwicklung. On the other hand, Trubetzkoy, accord- ing to Jakobson's wordportrait, believes in structuralism as a way to one- self, as a way to replace an atomizing view of the world by a unified one.5s Heilmann, in an essay entitled "Linguistics and Humanism," also stresses, in particular, the humanistic aspect of structuralism: "Through structural linguistics . . a new form of humanism is created whose motive force.. . is precisely the rational principle of structure. In other words, structuralism as a method of investigation and interpretation assumes the role of unifying force of the humanist knowledge in its perennial develop- ment."5 6 Heilmann claims that, in addition to this epistemological princi- ple, certain other features of generative linguistics also stamp it as human- istic: since it presupposes "the capacity of the user to produce and receive an open series of new utterances and to decide on their grammaticality, it paves the way to a wider and more fertile exchange between disciplines, raises questions which affect the whole man in his essential nature (innat- ism and universalism), and thus prepares for the recovery of the humanis- tic integrality of our discipline in a dynamic dimension."s 7 The approaches that concern today's humanistic linguist are still, with all the changes in epistemology, the ones established by the tradition that we have outlined. We shall briefly describe five of them: philology, rela- tivity, historicity, creativity, and attitudes. 8. Philology The most humanistic of all linguistic endeavors concerns The Text. The classical text had stimulated interest in language and grammar. Reading had established educational elitism and intellectual independence. Mastery of the text had led to the cult of manuscript tradition and philological meticulousness. Medieval rhetoric had abstracted from the text a set of systemic prescriptions such as inventio, dispositio, and elocutio, thought, arrangement, and elaboration.5 8 With the Idealists new forms of textual interpretation evolved: the belief that the detail reflects the whole, the be- lief in the internal cohesion of the text.S 9 For us, the text has remained a vital exemplar of language. Two approaches are now fashionable as topics of theoretical discussion: Discourse Analysis and Translation. (a) Discourse analysis. The field has many names: semiolinguistics/ functional sentence perspective/ Textlinguistik/ Textgrammatik/Text- semiotik. Weinrich's exposition provides a good description of the field.6 o The text-in-context is the base of all observation. The text (no longer the sentence) is the highest level of analysis which determines the lower ones. Weinrich approaches the text from two angles. First, the text is taken as a</page><page sequence="10">74 Henry and Renee Kahane communication between encoder and decoder; it consists of a string of signs by means of which the encoder enables the decoder to understand the message. The instructions for the decoder rest in the grammatical ele- ments of the text, particles/ affixes/ inflections; and he, the decoder, through his virtuosity in understanding the signs, is the true hero of the process. Second, the lexemes, traditionally analyzed on the level of the code (the language) as the signs of non-linguistic referents, are now analyzed on the level of the text, which shapes their particular meaning. The lexemes of the text fall into specific linguistic fields appropriate to the situation which is the object of the communication. By their very coherence they contribute to the decodability of the text. An experiment by Louise Allen61 hints at the potentialities of the field: the Cantar de mio id is reduced to two sentence patterns. The world of the epic is feudal Spain with its two aspects: foreground, i.e., feudal soci- ety, and background, i.e., Spain as a geographical and historical concept. The foreground is expressed by the subject-verb pattern, the background by a verb-adverb pattern. Certain verbs are always found with certain sub- jects: verbs conforming with the positive aspects of feudal life have as sub- jects the Cid and his followers (alegros mio qid 'the Cid rejoiced' Itan ondrados foron los del Canpeador 'the men of the Campeador were so honored'); verbs expressing violation of the feudal code go with subjects referring to the anti-Cid people (de cuer les pesa a ifantes de Carrion 'it deeply troubled the infantes de Carrion'/ moros e moras tomaronse a quexar 'Moorish men and women began to complain'). Thus, rejoycing and honoring are positive feudal values; being troubled and complaining, nega- tive ones. The verb-adverb pattern shows the landscape of Spain and the subject is irrelevant (salien de Valenqia 'they go out of Valencia'). (b) Translation. The text also functions as a bond betwcen cultures. This old and very humanistic tradition is always embedded in some situa- tion of languages in contact. We are referring, of course, to the textual interpretation inherent in the act of translation. Mario Wandruszka, who has contributed so much to the theoretical foundation of translation, points out the essential qualification of a translator: he must be bilingual.62 Jakobson expresses the essence of the task: "Translation involves two equivalent messages in two different codes."6 3 Porzig formulates the effect in terms of linguistic relativity: he perceives "the mirror of other languages [as] the means to look into one's own face."64 Medieval translation, as we have seen, was restricted to total literalness since this was considered the only way to protect the truth of the source. Today translation has developed into an independent science, and the di- lemmas of code transfer faced by the modern translator are, theoretically at least, endless. A sampling from studies listed or appearing in three recent bibliographies and collections provides a mosaic of the problems.</page><page sequence="11">Humanistic Linguistics 75 (i) Titles of studies on the theory of translation:6 5 On general implica- tions: Translation and exegesis/ The translator-intellectual or automaton/ Traitor, builder of bridges, orphan.

Relativity We have inherited the discussion on the linguistic relativity principle from the Idealistic school, which had inherited it from Romanticism, which had in its turn taken it from predecessors.6 8 The diversity of grammatical cate- gories and their relation to culture is, indeed, a field of renewed interest, as Dell Hymes stresses.69 We shall concentrate, essentially, on two facets: the tie between language and culture, and the interrelationship between linguistic units. (a) The problem of language and culture is bidirectional; either can in- fluence the other. In other words, language creates reality, as the Sapir- Whorfians hypothesize, or it reflects reality, as Marxist theory suggests.70 Robins"7 points out that the Sapir-Whorf theory may be interpreted either as advocating linguistic determinism: our thought processes are totally determined by the structure of our language; or as advocating linguistic relativity: different language structures exert different influences on think- ing. The apparent clash of this relativity theory with the now expanding</page><page sequence="12">76 Henry and Renbe Kahane belief in language universals is explained in terms of structural levels: lin- guistic universality rests in deep structure; linguistic diversity, in surface structures.72 Robins adduces the example of the two syntactical mean- ings of the genitivus subjectivus and genitivus objectivus represented by, say, amor Dei, active 'God's love' and passive 'the love for God': whereas Western languages express both meanings by the same surface structure, Pacific languages such as Hawaiian and Maori reflect the underlying dis- tinction by two surface patterns referred to as a-possession and o-possession: Haw. ka:na mele 'his song', composed by him, vs. kona mele 'his song', composed about him.73 (b) Lexemic relativity is centered in the method labelled Feldtheorie, linguistic field, which was created, essentially, by Trier and Weisgerber. Trier, as noted by Lyons,74 "looks upon the vocabulary of a language as an integrated system of lexemes interrelated in sense." Interrelation, as Schippan defines it,7 s refers to the fact that the meaning of an individual item is determined by the structure of the total field. The more abstract the concept, the more it depends on the power of a language to create con- cepts ("begriffsstiftende Kraft"), the more it is anchored in the field.76 The field theory with its assumption of a semantic structure is advanced as an improvement over the traditional "atomistic" description of seman- tic change. Interestingly, as Spitzer7 7 suggests, the beginnings of the the- ory can be traced back to French classical literature when the Renaissance tradition of the autonomy of the word gave way to the ideal of the mot juste, the mot mis ai sa place. Linguistic relativity is a theme wide open to further study. A few glimpses of the many possibilities must suffice. (i) Orwell, who gave us the keyword 1984, comments on the power of the political cliche: "The ready- made phrases come crowding in. They will construct your sentence for you- even think your thoughts for you, to a certain extent."78 (ii) Gipper79 illustrates the impact of language on social psychology: our education, values, behavior, such as the traditional prejudices against other beliefs and other ethnic groups, are tied to and transmitted through catchwords and vituperations. (iii) Miller8s discusses the classification of relative 'tenden- cies' in different languages in terms of contrasting features: concrete:ab- stract/ static:dynamic/ synthetic:analytic. Weisgerber considers German, in general, as 'concrete' in opposition to 'abstract' French (and Romance). German, e.g., forms compound nouns where French uses derivational suf- fixes of the corresponding root: Schlafraum vs. dortoir 'dormitory'/ Koh- lenbrenner vs. charbonnier 'charcoal burner'. (iv) Metaphors can be ana- lyzed within the framework of a linguistic field. Take, e.g., the field of the financial metaphor with its application to 'language': coin a wordl Sprach- schatz/ aurea dicta. The metaphorical field, although not universal, goes beyond individual languages. Weinrich, interestingly, considers Western</page><page sequence="13">Humanistic Linguistics 77 civilization as a metaphorical community, Bildgemeinschaft.81 (v) Muller, to demonstrate the principle of relativity, takes 'relativity' itself as a field. Humanism in action is marked by its "concept of relativity and the refer- ence system, the attitudes of 'as if' and 'that depends,' the admission of plural possibilities."82 To Muller, in short, the presence of this particular field, 'relativity', whether inherent or on the surface, reflects "the need of tolerance, flexibility, and catholicity," i.e., the humanistic strain in the tradition of Western science. 10. Historicity Two tenets are at the base of the humanists' all-pervading historical view of language: first, the principle of relativity, that cultural experience trans- forms itself into language; and second, the belief in tradition, that the past of a language is a latent force in the present. Language, then, is perceived as the most evident expression of man's heritage, and thus, it turns into a powerful tool for the reconstruction, in particular, of intellectual history. With this new insistence on the intellectual and cultural component, lin- guistics, as Gipper points out, ceases to be an autonomous discipline. The object is Geistesgeschichte, and geist involves "the content of speech, the speaker himself, the members of the speech community activated through the speech act and the supernational concerns behind it." 83 Uitti notes that "The perspective of tradition ... varies according to the depth and amplitude of each speaker's culture";84 Gipper believes that the tie be- tween Geistesgeschichte and language is characteristic of Western civiliza- tion: "For the European, linguistics is to be embedded in the humanistic heritage of the Occident. His intellectual existence is intertwined with language."8' Lewis8 6 sees the opposition between European and Ameri- can linguistics in terms precisely of the force of tradition: external expla- nations are based, in American analysis, on anthropological and sociologi- cal data; in European analysis, on philology and the humanities. A methodological problem which always arises when language features and cultural features are correlated is that of circularity. We correlate them not because we discover their correlation but because we know or we want them to be correlated. Spitzer, accused by Bloomfield87 of circularity, defends it: Cognitive circularity (a concept introduced by Dilthey) is the basic operation in the Humanities. "The detail can be understood only by the whole and any explanation of the detail presupposes the understand- ing of the whole."'88 Heidegger, similarly, speaks of the Hermeneutic Cir- cle: the analyst must always have, through his experience, a previous knowledge of the object of the analysis. Anttila applies the cognitive method of the hermeneutische Zirkel in particular to linguistics as a Geisteswissenschaft:89 logical conclusions are insufficient, we depend on</page><page sequence="14">78 Henry and Renee Kahane historical knowledge. Methodologically, also, the clash between language as tradition and lan- guage as system, an "outworn debate" to Uitti,90 is of relevance in dia- chronic analysis. A case in point illustrates the two approaches: The oblig- atory use of the subject pronoun in French has been explained in func- tional terms as a compensation for inflectional reduction. Baldinger9 1 perceives it as calqued after the Germanic model. Heilmann92 believes that in modern humanism structuralism takes over, as an interpretative principle, the role that was formerly played by historicity. He tries to bridge the gap by accepting two views for humanistic linguistics, one syn- chronic and the other diachronic: Man is both 'being' and 'becoming' in an indivisible unit.9 3 The older stage of a development, as particularly evi- dent in etymological reconstruction, often indeed, corresponds to the lin- guist's image of the underlying form.94 The word, more strikingly than any other feature of language, reveals humanistic forces. Let us point out three of these. (a) The word is auton- omous. Spitzer puts this aspect within a tradition: "It is the belief in the autonomy of the word which makes possible the whole movement of hu- manism, in which so much importance was given to the word of the an- cients and of the Biblical writers."9 5 (b) The word represents the histori- cal process. Each word, as Grimm's famous dictum runs, has its own his- tory; this implies that when it changes it reflects a change without. (c) The word is accumulated heritage. To Merleau-Ponty (in an apparent play on the meaning 'truth' of Greek etymon) "the sedimentation of meanings is but another name of truth itself," and to him, as a humanist, understand- ing of language is predicated upon the assumption of the presence of all former phases of a word's past history within the present one.96 A few examples (lengthy stories in a nutshell) may illustrate patterns of historicist etymology. (a) Word history as cultural history is treated masterfully by Benveniste. In the linguistic field of hierarchy, he traces the concept of king back to its multiple origins.9 7 Lat. rex reveals the ruler as, at the beginning, a priest; Homeric poimen la6n 'shepherd of the people' as a stockbreeder; Engl. lord (&lt;hlaford-loaf warden) as the bread-keeper; Engl. kingl Germ. K6nig (&lt;*kuningaz to kuni 'race, family') as the one of good stock. (b) A case of latent survival, Germ. Wonne, is analyzed by Trier.98 MHG wunne 'delight' referred to the tree with its branches and leaves, which served not only as food for animals but also whetted their appetite; and this base remained latent when, in the literary descriptions of the locus amoenus, branches and leaves turned into props at the folksy festiv- ities; the animals' appetite was likened to man's carnal appetite; and the branches and leaves were generalized to mean intellectual pleasure and ecstasis.</page><page sequence="15">Humanistic Linguistics 79 (c) The growing subfield of keywords is represented by Krauss' analy- sis of Fr. enthousiasme.99 It reflects well the mutations of societal and intellectual structure. Originally a sixteenth-century Renaissance Grecism meaning 'inspiration', it changed with the rising rationalism of Jansenism into an antonym of raison; then, with the age of Enlightenment, enthousi- asme reached its nadir as a designation of mob emotion, unbridled frenzy and drunkenness to the Voltairians. But with the rise of Romanticism a revaluation took place: enthousiasme was contrasted with superstition and became a typical expression of the newly-won bourgeois freedom as man's emotional response to silent nature. (d) In a word history representing the Words-and-Things approach in the specific area of the history of art,' 00 we used one word, balcone, to demonstrate the transfer of the common word for window, used in the Langobardic settlements in Northern Italy, to the technical terminology of tenth-century Lombard architecture and to trace, through scattered records, the expansion of an architectural innovation of the proto-Roman- esque style, the baywindow, from Lombardy to Burgundy, and from Bur- gundy to England. 11. Creativity The impact on language that may be ascribed to man's energeia can be de- scribed on the two levels of collectivity and individuality,' 0 or conven- tional speech and letters, or genesis from below'02 and genesis from above. The process of collective creativity, which means anonymous creativity accepted into general language, is multi-faceted. Perception is transformed into language through imitation, association, or interpretation; selection is activated by the pressure of prestige. Four of the following patterns repre- sent creative onomasiology; the fifth describes the growth of an elitist linguistic level. (a) Metaphors. As Cassirer points out, "The function of a name is always limited to emphasizing a particular aspect of a thing, and it is precisely this restriction and limitation upon which the value of the name depends."' 03 Thus, Old French replaces inherited maissele 'jaw' by coining machoire, the tool for chewing. The particular feature selected from among various alternatives as the base for naming has often the mark of a metaphor. Porzig, e.g., shows the strongly metaphorical quality of lexemes referring to landscape:1 04 the nomenclature of a mountain is permeated in German by comparisons with the body: Ruicken/ Flankenl Schulter/ Fuss/ Nase, and he speculates on the imagination of the first man who saw the moun- tain as an anthropomorphic entity. (b) Sound symbolism. Items of the surrounding world may be named after the noises with which they are associated. The assumption on which</page><page sequence="16">80 Henry and Renee Kahane sound symbolism rests is that aphonic things may evoke phonic represen- tations.l 05 Humboldt, here also a trailblazer, held, for example, that the phonologic group st regularly evokes the impression of the enduring and stable. This case, adduced by Cassirer,1 o06 is typical of many such hypoth- eses: it shows linguistically that sound symbolism implies the transforma- tion of a phoneme into a meaning, i.e., into a morpheme; and methodolog- ically that precisely stated correlations between symbolisant and symbolise lie on a tenuous borderline between ingenuity and absurdity. Three sub- stantial studies, by Timmermans,10 7 Garcia de Diego, 108 and Delamain1 0 9 accumulate ample proof of the fragility of that borderline. To the French, e.g., the mouth is supposedly associated with b, and where the mouth is involved, a b is produced, as in many lexemes dealing with eating.' 10 To the Germans, a gliding or fluent movement is expressed by liquids and sib- ilants, 1 / r / s, as in schleichen 'creep' and gleiten 'glide'.111 A set of Span- ish words for 'stupid' reveals in its unified sound patterning the associative force of the linguistic field: bobol tontol sosol zonzo/ iio'o share bisyl- labity, paroxytonity, both consonantic and vocalic reduplication plus or minus nasal infix. Whether this represents primary or secondary expressive- ness has stimulated a lively discussion from Baist through Amado Alonso and Corominas to Malkiel and Harri Meier.1 1 2 (c) Blendings. The association of etymologically unrelated words and their adaptation to each other, i.e., a restructuring of word families, may be considered a creative process. It is treated often and under many labels; these provide an idea of the interpretative potentialities of the concept:' 113 lautlich-begriffliche Assimilation/ etymologie seconde/ attraction homo- nymique/ attraction paronymique/ Wortanalogie/ etymologie statique/ etymologie associative/ Paretymologie/ evolutive or synchronische Etymol- ogie/ geistige or metaphysische Etymologie. Pisanil 14 distinguishes two polar patterns: A word is adapted to another of similar shape and changes its meaning: Lat. periculum 'test' changes to 'danger' under the impact of perire 'perish'. Or the word is adapted to another of similar meaning and changes its shape: Span. vagabundo, through association with mundo 'world', becomes vagamundo. Pisani1 Is states sweepingly that all new cre- ations are, in some way, blendings, and our brave new world is certainly full of them, as, say, in the recent TV term faction, an adaptation of fic- tion to fact, to indicate a fashionable mixed genre. (d) Rime words. SturtevantI 16 draws attention to a specifically English set of words, which result from an interlocking of sound symbolism and blending. The subsets are tied together by rime. Examples (with the date of the first record): bat (1205)+mash (1000)+bash (1641); clap (1375)+ crash (1400)+clash (1500); smack (1746)+mash (1000)+smash (1778). The -ash subset: bash/ clash/ crash/ flash/ quash/ mash/ smash/ splash/ slash. (e) Creativity of the elite. Pisani' '7 denies altogether the existence of natural language. Language, to him, results from the perpetual creativity</page><page sequence="17">Humanistic Linguistics 81 of its speakers. He takes Italian as his exemplar. The action of educated individuals produces a considerable influx of various features preponder- antly Greek: calques, borrowings, learned elements, and the Hellenistic prescriptions of grammarians. The effect is sufficiently strong to make the usual belief in a monolithic sequence of evolutionary phases, from Vulgar Latin to Italian, rather questionable. Literary style is a Janus-faced complex:118 to the literary analyst it is the linguistic facet of literature; to the linguist, the literary facet of lan- guage. Indeed, the linguist's approach defines poetry as a language in itself, self-centered in the formulation of I. A. Richards, who refuses to accord it referential value.' 1 9 How to describe creative language, i.e., style, has long puzzled analysts. Uitti presents a good survey.'20 Polarity is a favored attack; and this frequently means a polarity between the standard and the individual: norm vs. deviation (in a relation comparable to that of deep structure vs. surface)/ grammaticalness vs. ungrammaticalness/ grammatical- ness vs. poeticalness/ casual vs. non-casual/ prose vs. verse. Jakobson stresses a contrast between selection and combination which means, we take it, that context tends to dominate the choice of items more often in literary rather than in ordinary language. Other approaches seek the key in poetical lan- guage itself. For Kroeber, style is not deviation from but achievement of, the norm. For Riffaterre, the text represents a cooperation between en- coder and decoder, writer and reader. For Coseriu,1121 an adherent of text linguistics, actualization in poetic language is motivated by and meaning results from, the text. For Levin,1 22 meaning in poetry is coterminous with form, and the unity of the text is produced by the recurrence of certain structures. A sampling from the rich store of individual contributions to and ex- ploitations of, stylistic particularities, will hint at the possibilities of this field of study. (a) Stylistic potentialities of grammatical items. (i) Storz' 2 3 analyzes the usefulness of the article, apart from its function as a metrical filler: when present it expresses such nuances as the familiar, the customary, the collec- tive; when absent, the distant, the strange, the intangible. (ii) Flasche124 isolates the negative particle no as a weighty stylistic device in Calderon's works: the author cherishes such patterns of negativity as sentence-initial position/ unusual position/ negation of the verbal nexus/ negation of ex- pressions usually not negated. (iii) Weinrich1 25 interprets Moliere's Ecole des femmes as a comedy of subjunctives. The uncertainty of the happen- ings stimulates in the characters (and through the actors in the audience) a feeling of involvement and a need for information, which is expressed by verbs requiring the subjunctive: Je veux que vous me disiez! (b) Mannerisms. (i) Spitzer1 26 analyzes Proust's love for the phonic associations evoked by names: the name Guermantes is filled for Proust with a "lumiere orangte qui emane de cette syllabe ante"; the "sonorite</page><page sequence="18">82 Henry and Renee Kahane delicieuse," exuded by the name Swann, results, according to Spitzer, from the association with svelte; the name of Parme, the town, appears to Proust "compact, lisse, mauve et doux" thanks to the heaviness of the syl- lable parme, the connotation of the flower violette de Parme, and the lit- erary reminiscence of the Chartreuse de Parme. (ii) Cureton1 27 claims that E. E. Cummings uses deviant morphology to involve the reader: under the pressure of the affix the reader is forced to modify the meaning of the base. If, e.g., the suffix -ly, which (as in manly) customarily means "having the complex qualities of the base," appears unexpectedly in moonly, the moon turns into a symbol comparable in complexity to a man. Cummings, in short, uses the new form to produce a poetic effect. (iii) Barthell 28 iso- lates a syntactical feature in German, the sentence without a final verb, to demonstrate the spiritual and literary kinship of two movements, eighteenth- century Sturm und Drang and twentieth-century Expressionism. (c) Total style. (i) Lida de Malkiel1 29 describes the style and language of an Italianizing Spanish writer of the pre-Renaissance, Juan de Mena (1411-1456); and she relates her arresting description to the linguistic- rhetorical operations and traditions of his time. She distinguishes between the amplificatio rerum, with such subclasses as hyperbole and asyndeton; the amplificatio verborum, with coupling, chiasmus, figura etymologica, and litotes; and symmetry, with antonyms, hyperbaton, and apostrophe. She distinguishes contrasting levels in his vocabulary: vocablos groseros, containing archaisms, calques, slang and borrowings, and vocablos muy la- tinos, encompassing cultisms and university jargon. (ii) Levin,' 30 in a new analysis of coupling, underpins the old belief that "form and meaning are fused in a poem." Coupling, according to Levin, is realized on a broad front of equivalences on the phonic or syntactical or semantic levels: through parallel position or construction, grammatical function, syllabic patterning, antonymity, phonic similarity, assonance, grammatical trans- formation, or affinity of meaning. Through its all-pervading presence cou- pling evolves as a dominating subcode within the code of poetry. 12. Attitudes The buildup, period by period, of the humanistic approaches to language involves a humanistic feature in itself: the fact that the relation of man to language changes with the spirit of the time, the zeitgeist, as in the phases of linguistic romanticism, linguistic impressionism, linguistic expression- ism. The history of linguistics is, for that matter, an aspect of intellectual history even as the history of historiography or of literary criticism or of science. In the interesting genre of the obituary, we may add, the linguist (as mutatis mutandis the intellectual in any field of endeavors) becomes, precisely as a product of his time, most concretely a part of that history.</page><page sequence="19">Humanistic Linguistics 83 Reading Sebeok's collection of Portraits of Linguists,131 which is like walking through London's National Portrait Gallery, reveals the changing styles of linguistics through the changing personalities of linguists. In linguistic matters the living presence of the zeitgeist, whose descrip- tion is a humanistic task, is evident on two levels: First, linguistic techniques, at any time, tend to reflect the general scientific behavior and, in our own days, we witness, of course, the impact of technological style on the form of linguistic presentation. Second, the attitudes toward language, principal- ly those of the elites, reflect contemporaneous fashions, dilemmas, and prejudices. For example, the attitude toward foreignisms may be deter- mined by the force of tradition: English writers, as quasibilinguals through their Romance heritage, are accustomed to foreignisms and accept them; the French respond favorably to a stylized neo-classic Latinity; but the Germans reject all foreignisms as expressions of an alien mentality.' 32 A linguistic subfield in which attitudes are revealed consistently in action is one which seems to be more objective than it really is: lexicography. In fact, as Matore133 points out, the dictionary is a unique instrument for the history of ideas: it reflects a civilization by inventorizing public knowl- edge and information. The Marxist humanist and classicist Biliriski' 34 ex- plicitly considers the dictionary a mirror of society and thereby an instru- ment for historical reconstruction: The terminology referring to society is a vital aspect of the Klassenkampf; for Biliriski, therefore, the primary pur- pose of a dictionary is to establish the true cultural and social meanings of the period inventorized. As a matter of fact, the salient features of five master-dictionaries of French from the seventeenth to our own century, reflect, each for its own time, the history of ideas of the last three hundred years. This clearly marks lexicography as a fruitful subfield of attitudes. (a) The Dictionnaire of the French Academie, of 1694, was written for an aristocratic class; through its cult of bon usage, normativeness, it served as an instrument of the monarchic principle. (b) The French Encyclopedie, of c. 1760, represented the transition from an aristocratic to a predomi- nantly bourgeois society. Language had to serve to free the bourgeois from his inferior position. Outworn concepts were demystified; progress and modernism were presented in an understandable language. The Encyclo- pkdie was, in Kohler's words, "Weltanschauung through and through."' 3 (c) Littre (1863-1872) represented positivism. The natural sciences estab- lished the model. Rules derived from abstract raison were rejected. The historical sequence was the true fact: it did for humanism what observa- tion and experimentation did for the natural sciences.136 (d) Wartburg's Franzosisches etymologisches Worterbuch (1922- c. 1968), which described the process of the Romanization of France in the framework of word his- tories, was a truly humanistic thesaurus, reflecting the methodological struggles of the times by bringing to life the two forces of rule and creativ-</page><page sequence="20">84 Henry and Renbe Kahane ity: It adhered, in other words, to the positivist tradition and milieu theo- ry with its attention to levels, dialects, and geographic distribution; and to the principles of dynamic creativity in its minute presentation of word formation and semantic change. (e) The Trisor de la langue frangaise, which has been in progress since 1971 under the direction of Paul Imbs, is engaged in codifying the modern language. It is impressive through its combination of humanistic goals and technological procedure: it presents, through the medium of words, both the microcosm and the macrocosm, the summa of the humanistic tradition as it survives in the modern world.1 37 Its comprehensiveness and organization are made possible, of course, by the computer; its synchronic and diachronic dimensions are evenly bal- anced; its cultural comments make it a Word-and-Thing cyclopedia; its esthetic comments underline the creative potentialities of a word. 13. Resume We have had two aims in our obviously sketchy view of what we call hu- manistic linguistics: to outline a typology of the field and to embed it in a history of its transformations. Humanistic linguistics encompasses those aspects of language which correlate with the paideia of Western man, with his spiritual existence: man as he creates language and is influenced by it, as he is linked to the past through language and yet aware of its vital implications-creativity/ relativity/ historicity/ attitudes. In the course of the development exemplified by the five Renaissances of the past and by the present state of endeavors, numerous concrete topics representing basic humanistic aspects of language have become clearly dis- tinguishable, in particular: discourse analysis/ translations (as applied the- ory)/ linguistic field/ etymology/ onomasiology/ stylistics/ lexicography. These topics, as we have tried to show, have remained rather stable; but responses to them and the techniques of analysis involved have changed with the styles of the passing times. This ongoing interplay of tradition and renewal is, in itself, a humanistic process. NOTES 1.
