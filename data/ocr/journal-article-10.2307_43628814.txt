The application to all the branches of the Roman de Renart of analytical methods derived ultimately from V. Propp's Morphology of the Folk-Tale is a logical and welcome development. In a brief introduction Mrs Suomela-Härmä explains how</page><page sequence="2">142 Medium ^Evum liii.i the underlying narrative structures of the Renart cycle can be analysed in terms of the structuralists' paradigmatic-syntagmatic opposition, with the range of 'characters' constituting the former and the sequences of 'events' the latter. This distinction forms the basis of the first two chapters of the book. In the first the author detects seven basic types ('actants') underlying the characters of the cycle, the principal ones being the trompeur and the trompé . In the second she investigates the narrative sequences in which the various actants appear. She reduces them ultimately to 'quests' of two kinds: quests for 'food' on the one hand, and quests for 'justice' on the other. In a laudably systematic way she compares the Renart with the Ysengrimus on both the paradigmatic and syntagmatic axes in order to identify the specificity of the French text - its structures are closer to those of folk-tales than are those of the Ysengrimus . The latter part of the book (pp. 129-227) contains six chapters on various topics, those on spatio-temporal structures, anthropomorphism and the syntactical cohesion of the cycle being the most interesting. However, one senses a lack of coordination here, for these somewhat disparate topics could have been subsumed more neatly into the fundamental paradigmatic-syntagmatic structure of the prime thesis of the book. One must praise the author's avoidance of ad hoc solutions and her search for a higher level of abstraction and generalization than is usually found in Renart criticism. However, one occasionally finds the critical apparatus cumbersome and the ultimate conclusion that the narrative structures of the cycle are not particularly complex or varied is a little disappointing, for it implies that the prime interest in the Roman de Renart lies elsewhere. One could argue that it lies in verbal comedy and literary parody, neither of which is well reflected in the narrative structures identified here. But to ask for discussion of these questions would be to ask for another book. Aberdeen ANTHONY LODGE</page></plain_text>
