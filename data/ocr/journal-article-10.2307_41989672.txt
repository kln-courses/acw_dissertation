<plain_text><page sequence="1">Appraisal of the Epidemiology of F etal Alcohol Syndrome Among Canadian Native Peoples DEBRAH L. BRAY, B.A.,1 PERRY D. ANDERSON, Ph.D.1 Three recent studies suggest that Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS) is more prevalent among Canadian Native children than non-Native children. The evidence does not appear to be conclusive. However, the Canadian research that is reviewed is important in defining areas which require further investigation. Efforts at research and intervention should be directed towards defining and modifying personal and social risk factors. Our review of current research on FAS and Native peoples suggests that it is important to consider pragmatic questions which can best contribute to the goal of preventing possible alcohol effects on the fetus. Des études récentes donnent à penser que le Syndrome alcool-foetal (S.A. F.) est plus répandu au Canada chez les enfants autochtones que chez les non-autochtones , mais les preuves ne semblent pas concluantes. Cependant , les études canadiennes dont il est question sont importantes parce qu'elles précisent quels domaines demanderaient de plus larges explorations. Le travail de recherche et d'intervention devrait s'orienter vers la définition et la modification des facteurs de risques , tant personnels que sociaux. Notre lecture des recherches sur le S.A. F. et les autochtones souligne l'importance de considérer les questions pratiques qui peuvent le mieux contribuer à la prévention des effets possibles de l'alcool sur le foetus. Just alcohol as today during women pregnancy, are warned women long against ago consuming were also alcohol during pregnancy, women long ago were also warned. Sampson's mother was told, "Behold thou shalt conceive and bear a son; and now drink no wine or strong drink." (Judges 13:7) In 1973, Jones and Smith defined a pattern of abnormalities in the offspring of chronically alcoholic women which they termed Fetal Alcohol Syndrome (FAS). The minimal criteria for diagnosis of FAS include growth retardation, central nervous system dysfunction and certain cranio-facial features. In the context of FAS, there is the strong inference that alcohol is a selectively acting teratogen, a substance capable of disrupting fetal development. The inference is supported by the finding that approximately one third of the chronically alcoholic women who continue heavy drinking throughout pregnancy have offspring with FAS.1 However, it is generally agreed that there is a wide range of variability in the spectrum of FAS-related effects. Because of this 1. Science College, Concordia University, Montréal, Québec H3G 1M8. Correspondence and reprint requests: Debrah Bray, c/o Dr. John Fyfe, Dept. of Geography, UBC, Vancouver, B.C. V6T 1W5. 42 Canadian Journal of Public Health variability, a controversy exists about the role of genetic and/ or environmental factors. Early documentation on abnormalities in children related to maternal alcohol consumption during pregnancy included numerous case studies of Indians.2 3 4 Is it merely coincidental that Indians are represented in various case studies or is there reason to believe Native children suffer an increased prevalence of FAS? Is there epidemiological evidence that suggests FAS occurs more frequently in Native populations? Case Studies from the Yukon Territory and British Columbia The sample population in the study by Sandor et al.5 consisted of 76 patients from two Vancouver hospitals with an unequal ratio of 69 children of Native ancestry and 7 children of Caucasian descent. (No details were given regarding numbers of children from either the Yukon or British Columbia.) The patients were diagnosed as having FAS based on the criteria of maternal alcoholism, poor growth, delayed development, and characteristic facial appearance such as small palpebral fissures (eye slits) and thin vermilion border of the lip. Further clinical Vol. 80, January/February 1989</page><page sequence="2">investigations, including skeletal surveys, intravenous pyelograms, and cardiac assessments were performed, and the details were presented and discussed in detail. Sandor et al. claim, "our statistics reveal a 10.9 to 1 ratio of native Indian children to Caucasian from our population with FAS. This raises the significance of racial susceptibility to the teratogenic effects of alcohol, a very difficult point to satisfactorily answer." The authors have contributed an important descriptive study, especially in terms of thorough investigative diagnosis. However, the epidemiological conclusion of a 10.9 to 1 ratio of Indian children to Caucasian is not justified. For one reason, it was not possible to repeat the calculations which result in a 10.9 to 1 ratio; 69 Indians and 7 Caucasians is a 9.9 to 1 ratio. Without definition of the populations from which these children were derived, no conclusion can be made about rates or ratios. Furthermore, there is no description of the biases that might have been introduced in finding patients through the Vancouver hospitals. For example, could Indians have been excessively referred to the particular tertiary care units in the study and over-represented in the sample? Northern Study of FAS Asante et al.6 studied 36 communities in the Yukon and Northwest British Columbia to determine the prevalence of FAS and assess children with handicaps. The sample consisted of 586 subjects from infancy to 16 years, referred by community agencies. The criteria for FAS included growth retardation, CNS dysfunction and cranio-f acial abnormalities. Fetal Alcohol Effects (FAE) was diagnosed if a child showed features in two of the criteria. The prevalence of FAS and /or FAE was 46 per 1000 Native children in the Yukon and 25 per 1000 Native children in Northwest British Columbia. The prevalence of .4 per 1000 non-Native children was reported in both the Yukon and Northwest British Columbia. Subjects were selected for study by various agencies who identified children in their community as "chronically handicapped." From this subpopulation, Asante et al.6 estimated the prevalence of FAS and/ or FAE in the total population. The authors are aware that this is less than an ideal way to estimate prevalence. The sample was based on children identified by the health care system and social services as being handicapped, and this in itself may lead to a biased estimate of prevalence. It is important to determine if the criteria for FAS were applied equally to both Natives and non-Natives. Unfortunately, Asante et al. offer no documentation regarding diagnostic findings. Developmental assessment in evaluating CNS dysfunction was not systematic. The Denver Developmental Screening Test was given to some of the children although the authors realized that this test was biased against rural children. FAS Study on a British Columbia Indian Reserve Robinson et al.7 measured the extent of FAS on 116 Native children aged 1 to 18 years living on a reservation. All children from the reserve were eligible to participate in the study. The prevalence of FAS and/ or FAE was reported to be 190 per 1000 births. Mental retardation is considered to be the most serious effect of heavy in utero alcohol exposure, and the results of Robinson et al. support this hypothesis. Two thirds of the children with FAS were mentally retarded. Criteria for FAS included maternal alcohol abuse, growth retardation, CNS dysfunction, and facial dysmorphology. Fetal Alcohol Effects was diagnosed when a child showed features in just one or two of the criteria. Identification of FAS was made independently of the knowledge of alcohol exposure. This is important because it balances a widespread bias that Natives consume a larger amount of alcohol and are more susceptible to its effects. The presence of epicanthic folds and other anatomical features of Indian children made the measurements of facial characteristics difficult.7 In psycho-educational analysis, it was taken into consideration that Indian children often score better in Performance IQ tests, which require a holistic/ visual spatial problem-solving strategy, rather than Verbal IQ tests. The study by Robinson et al. did not include information on smoking and other potential confounders. Growth retardation is a criterion for FAS, however growth retardation is also related to maternal smoking. A careful maternal history is needed to differentiate effects of alcohol from those due to anticonvulsant medication because of similarities in dysmorphology.8 CNS dysfunction may be associated with other known teratogenic drugs and chemicals, infections during pregnancy and perhaps a host of unidentified teratogens. The problem is to separate in utero alcohol exposure from the myriad other experiences of the prenatally exposed child, which is especially the case for the child who is diagnosed as mentally retarded.9 A more sophisticated analysis would have collected confounding variables in the same way as information on alcohol and then performed a multiple logistic regression or a stratified analysis. Robinson et al.7 claim that FAS is a particular problem for Natives given the high prevalence rate of 190 births per 1000. This statistic would be more convincing if the authors had conducted a prevalence study of FAS in a non-Native comparison group using the same FAS criteria and method. Instead, the authors refer to other research which reports the prevalence of FAS/ FAE to be 19.5, 2.7 and 2.5 per 1000 births for three Indian tribes of the Southwest United States.10 Rather than strengthening Robinson's position, these data indicate significant variation in the prevalence rate across cultural groups with the statistics from two tribes comparable to FAS prevalence rates for the general American population. None of the statistics compare with the rate of 190 births per 1000. January/ February 1989 43</page><page sequence="3">Evaluation of Epidemiological Evidence The notion that there is more FAS among Native children than non-Native children is questionable. There is a lack of published research in Canada on the prevalence of FAS in the non-Native population. Therefore it is difficult, if not impossible, to make a valid comparison of the prevalence rates for Natives and non-Natives and draw inferences regarding higher prevalence for Natives. Applying the standard diagnostic criteria for FAS across cultures is problematic. Since anthropomorphic features of Indian children generally differ from Caucasian children, the use of facial characteristics as a diagnostic criterion is questionable. Educational assessment across cultures, especially the use of IQ tests in the evaluation of CNS dysfunction as a criterion, requires special attention. There are only two epidemiological studies on FAS among Canadian Native peoples, therefore the weight of the evidence is weak. The studies are confined to two subpopulations of West Coast Indians. The investigations themselves may lack methodological sophistication and therefore warrant scientific conservatism in accepting the prevalence rates prima facie. Both studies neglected to control for confounding variables. The patient identification in the Northern study was through referral by the health and social service system and calls into question the validity of the calculated prevalence rate. Native peoples should not be stigmatized by a condition such as FAS which is difficult to prove as factual and which may have negative impact within the Native community. Caution is warranted before we conclude that FAS is more prevalent in any Native peoples. On the other hand, methodological problems may account for only part of an inflated prevalence rate. Therefore, the epidemiological studies may be signalling that there could be a problem of FAS for certain Native populations. We calculated a risk ratio using the data of Robinson et al.7 and found that the relative risk of producing a child with FAS was approximately 19 times greater if alcohol was consumed by the mother during pregnancy. An advantage to the epidemiological research is that it points to an important question which has not been addressed. What are the factors that could put Canadian Native women at risk for producing children with FAS? A Need for Risk Assessment Problem drinking rates exhibited by any group of women of childbearing age could indicate a possible risk of adverse pregnancy outcome. An investigation into alcohol consumption patterns and drinking styles would be a logical first step to determine if a group is at risk. However there are no objective data regarding typical and excessive alcohol consumption patterns and drinking styles of Canadian Native women of childbearing age. It cannot be assumed without scientific evidence that Canadian Native women are alcohol abusers. Alkalai Lake, British Columbia is an example of a Native community that practices 95% sobriety.11 According to American research12, consumption patterns and styles vary significantly across Native tribes and consumption rates for some groups of Native women are much lower than the national average. Over 300,000 Canadian Native peoples live in 6 recognized cultural areas and there are at least 10 linguistic groups, implying a diversity in both social customs and alcohol consumption patterns. Community-specific information regarding alcohol consumption patterns of Canadian Native women is needed. This would contribute to a solid data base to assess whether a targeted alcohol abuse prevention program is needed and whether an investigation into the prevalence of FAS is worthwhile. It appears that Canadian research has yet to address the question of how demographic, socioeconomic and sociocultural factors may be related to an increased risk of FAS for some Native peoples. Risk factors for Indians of the Southwestern United States include attitudes toward alcohol, styles of drinking, lack of alcohol rehabilitation for women, greater fertility and longer span of childbearing years.13 Across the general United States population, there seems to be an inverse relationship between the rate of alcohol consumption among pregnant women and socioeconomic status.14 It is not known how socioeconomic status may be related to risk for Canadian Native peoples. Unique social and cultural dynamics were cited as most important in explaining significant variation in the prevalence of FAS across Southwestern United States Native tribes.10 Social variables of mothers such as maladjustment, high risk lifestyles and high mean age were associated with increased prevalence of FAS in certain groups. The various drinking styles of each of the cultural groups were important in understanding the variation in prevalence rates. An increased risk of FAS was associated with an abusive drinking style particular to one tribe. This group has a cultural tradition which allows for more individualistic behaviour. Defining a subpopulation at high risk for FAS is important so that education and intervention efforts can be effectively targeted.10 Canadian research has yet to establish whether any Native population is a high risk group for FAS. For instance, what are the consumption rates and drinking styles across Canadian Native cultural groups? What attitudes toward alcohol may contribute to higher risk of FAS? What support programs exist for Native women seeking help for problem drinking? How do fertility level, parity and age at childbearing relate to FAS in Canadian Indian subpopulations? Possible risk factors need to be identified if the ultimate goal is to prevent FAS. CONCLUSIONS If the prevalence rates of FAS for Canadian Indians were accepted without scrutiny, FAS might be seen as a public 44 Canadian Journal of Public Health Vol. 80</page><page sequence="4">health problem of massive proportion. If this were so, subsequent policy and allocation of resources might be misdirected to programs aimed at widespread efforts of preventing FAS. Given the weakness in the data from which these prevalence rates were calculated, this could represent a waste of both human and financial resources. The epidemiological approach aims to monitor FAS in the Native population and provide pointers for preventive measures. Difficulties with and costs of prevalence research among Native peoples call into question whether further investigations of this sort are now worthwhile. There is less need to continue to monitor the situation than to ask more fundamental questions aimed directly at understanding if specific Native subpopulations may be at risk for producing children with FAS.

ACTIONS: Permethrin is a synthetic pyrethroid, active against a broad range of pests including lice, ticks, fleas, mites, and other arthropods. It acts on the nerve cell mem- brane to disrupt the sodium channel current by which the polarization of the membrane is regulated. Delayed repolar- ization and paralysis of the pests are the consequences of this disturbance. In vitro data indicate that permethrin has excellent pediculi- cida! and ovicidal activity against pediculus humanus var. capitis. The high cure rate of permethrin in patients with head lice following a single application is attributable to a combina- tion of its pèdiculicidal and ovicidal activities and its residual persistence on the hair which may also prevent reinfestation. INDICATIONS: Nix is indicated for the single application treatment of infestation with Pediculus humanus var capitis (the head louse) and its nits (eggs). Retreatment for recur- rences is required in less than 1% of patients since the ovicidal activity may be supplemented by residual persis- tence in the hair. If live lice are observed after at least seven days following the initial application, a second application can be given. CONTRAINDICATIONS: Nix is contraindicated in patients with known hypersensitivity to any of its components, to any synthetic pyrethroid or Pyrethrin, or to chrysanthemums. WARNING: If hypersensitivity to Nix occurs, discontinue use. PRECAUTIONS: General: Head lice infestation is often accompanied by pruritus, erythema, and edema. Treatment with Nix may temporarily exacerbate these conditions. Use in Pregnancy: Reproduction studies have been per- formed in mice, rats and rabbits and have revealed no evidence of impaired fertility or harm to the fetus due to permethrin. There are, however, no adequate and well-con- trolled studies in pregnant women. Because animal repro- duction studies are not always predictive of human response, this drug should be used during pregnancy only if clearly needed. Nursing Mothers: It is not known whether this drug is excreted in human milk. Because many drugs are excreted in human milk and because of the evidence for tumorigenic potential of permethrin in animal studies, consideration should be given to discontinuing nursing temporarily or withholding the drug while the mother is nursing. Use in children: Nix is safe and effective in children two years of age and older. Safety and effectiveness in children less than two years of age have not been established. ADVERSE REACTIONS: The most frequent adverse reac- tion to Nix is pruritus. This is usually a consequence of head lice infestation itself, but may be temporarily aggravated following treatment with Nix. 5.9% of patients in clinical studies experienced mild temporary itching; 3.4% experi- enced mild transient burning/stinging, tingling, numbness, or scalp discomfort; and 2.1% experienced mild transient ery- thema, edema, or rash of the scalp. SYMPTOMS AND TREATMENT OF OVERDOSAGE: No instance of accidental ingestion of Nix has been reported. If ingested, gastric lavage and general supportive measures should be employed. DOSAGE ADMINISTRATION: Adults and Children: Nix is intended for use after the hair has been washed with shampoo, rinsed with water and towel dried. Apply a sufficient volume of Nix to saturate the hair and scalp. Nix should remain on the hair for 10 minutes before being rinsed off with water. A single treatment is sufficient to eliminate head lice infestation. Combing of nits is not required for therapeutic efficacy, but may be done for cosmetic or other reasons. SHAKE WELL BEFORE USING.
