F. MAC LAUGHLIN , ET AL. I. INTRODUCTION The purpose of this paper is to describe efforts on evaluating full vehicle and component test procedures as part of the overall development of a side impact test procedure. In an Advanced Notice of Proposed Rule- making on side impact protection, the NHTSA had proposed a moving barrier side impact test procedure using crash test dummies. Comments by several U.S. manufacturers urged NHTSA to take a broader approach and consider component test procedures as well, which may be simpler and a more practicable alternative than the procedure proposed in the Nötice. Both component tests and the full vehicle test using crash dummies may have unique advantages when compared one with the other. Consequently, NHTSA and MVMA have undertaken a coordinated effort to develop and compare full vehicle with component test procedures. The coordinated NHTSA/ MVMA research plan is divided into two phases. The first phase has three tasks : Task 1 - Accident data analysis Task 2 - Test effectiveness proj ection Task 3 - Injury criteria. Phase 2 of the project will begin the actual development and/or evaluation of test devices and systems . This paper presents the results of Task 2, Test Effectiveness Pro- jection. The Task 2 Group identified and evaluated full-vehicle and component tests which are likely to be able to discriminate among vehicle designs which have a significant effect on side impact injuries. The Task 2 effort considered the results of the Task 1 (accident data analysis) output, which defined and ranked injury categories (body parts to vehicle regions) , and evaluated candidate test procedures on the basis of how well test conditions could be defined, the validity of expected test output, whether synergistic effects could be adequately detected, and how efficient the test procedures were. II. GENERAL ISSUES In the early meetings of Task Group 2, two important philosophical issues were discussed extensively. The first dealt with the Task Group members' perceptions of the funda- mental advantages and disadvantages of full vehicle crash testing as compared with component testing. As a consequence of this concern, a list of evaluation factors for different tests (both full vehicle and com- ponent) were developed and prioritized, and the advantages and disadvantages of the tests were discussed in detail. The results of this effort, along with recommended areas for further research on particular test approaches, will be reported in a later section of this paper. The second issue involved the basic approach taken toward accomplishing safety improvements to vehicles. The Task Group recognized two fundamental approaches to safety advancement. The " incr ementai" approach takes into account the spectrum of existing performance within a given safety area as observed among the various vehicle designs in current production. This range of performance can be observed by testing the various vehicles. Then, an appropriate minimum performance level can be established, relative to the group performance, to eliminate outliers. In contrast, the "idealized" approach uses reference values derived from field accident data and human tolerance data to set an absolute goal for minimum performance in a given safety area. This second approach may or may not affect only the outliers. It could require large changes to be made to a significant portion of the whole group, all in a single step. Historically, the "incremental" approach has tended to involve mainly component testing procedures; while the "idealized" approach has been associated mainly with full-vehicle testing. These associations, however, are not necessarily tied to any particular type of test. A key question to be answered when choosing between the two approaches is - which approach will provide the motoring public the larger, overall benefit? This, of course, will be greatly dependent</page><page sequence="3">CRASH SURVIVABILITY 2.357 upon performance criteria which have yet to be established. Importantly, this evaluation must take into account both the degree of improvement and the absence of delay in getting the improvanents actually "on the road." Thus, simplicity of a safety test procedure can be an important factor in the election of the approach taken to move ahead in vehicle safety advancement. III. REVIEW OF PAST AND CURRENT WORK 1 . Full Vehicle Test Devices A. NHTSA Moving Deformable Barrier A deformable moving barrier has been developed at NHTSA as a full vehicle systems test device for side impact evaluation. Primarily the barrier has been developed to reproduce real world accidents in the severe range (AIS 4 or greater) . The physical pro- perties of the barrier and energy absorbing element are also suitable for testing in the less severe range if warranted . The properties of the NHTSA barrier can be varied, although most develop- mental testing has been con- ducted to represent one particular severe side impact accident condition. In most of the testing done to date, the speed of impact was equivalent to the striking car moving at 30 mph (48 Km/h) while the struck car moved at 15 mph (24 km/h) . The striking point was selected to give maximum penetration at the occupant "H" point and the angle of impact was 60° from the struck vehicle center line. The reason for using the 60° impact has been that, even though more accidents occur at 90°, the ratio of severe (AIS 4) to hon- severe accidents is higher at 60° than at 90°. Also, it is anticipated that testing at 60° will impose structural loadings that are indicative of those needed for evaluation of side impact protection at 90°. Although weight was initially chosen at 1568 kg (3450 lbs) , a recent adjustment was made to this weight to reduce it to 1364 kg (3000 lbs). The reason for this weight reduction was due to predicted changes in the U.S. vehicle fleet weight. The 1364 kg (3000 lbs) is expected to approximate the median weight of striking cars in severe, 1985 accidents. Weight of the impactor is easily adjusted. Geometric configuration was chosen for those properties deemed most appropriate for oblique side impacts and producing a minimum degree of complexity. Therefore the front face is completely flat except for a 102 mm (4 in) protrusion representing the bumper face. The frontal view is shown in Figure 1. Stiffness of the impactor has been determined from a selected group of high sales volume cars. The similarity in stiff- ness between the barrier and a medium sized automobile for an oblique impact can be seen in Figure 2. Comparisions of force- crush are shown for 0° in Figure 3. Note here the basic difference at 0° between the Citation and barrier is the initial four inches of Citation crush. If the barrier were not flat but tapered approximately 102 mm (4 in), the two curves would be nearly identical . The significance of this added com- plexity has not yet been established . The test configuration in the oblique test condition to achieve maximum structural severity at the occupant' s seated position is shown in Figure 4, when the barrier is "crabbed" to simulate both vehicles moving. Additional test configurations are being evaluated, eg, 90o, striking forward of "A" pillar, etc., in order to correlate the safety benefits indicated from testing to the real world, considering the entire spectrum of severe accidents. Dummy thoracic response in the oblique car to car test condition (both cars moving) is compared with that in the oblique barrier to car condi- tion (stationary car, as in Figure 4) in Figure 5. This demonstrates the appropriate- ness of the crabbed side impact barrier to reproduce this par- ticular crash test environment.</page><page sequence="4">2.358 T. F. MAC LAUGHLIN, ET AL. All development work in full scale systems testing has been in the oblique impact condition (60°) with a crabbed barrier simulating a two car moving impact (shown in Figure 4). In this configuration the impact point location for achieving maximum penetration at the occupant "H" point is determined by the formula, I=(D+.15v) /.8693 +1.5, where V=velocity of crabbed impactor. Terms are defined in Figure 4. Repeatability testing of the energy absorbing (E-A) barrier face has been deter- mined statically to be within ¿2.5%. Four dynamic tests against a rigid load cell barrier in oblique and perpen- dicular testing has confirmed good dynamic repeatability of the honeycomb E-A element. |. ■ ! 6.33* t-t ____________ __ _____ ___ ___ «--J T 0 * " ' I- ____________ __ _____ ___ ___ I _lï L_l_ I O/ound (front vww) FIGURE 1 Frontal View of Impactor Deformable Barrier 90 X* Taat configuration I I I I I I - Taigat - - - S«o» impactor « V - ^ mhtcl* ""A"" - - fl*« II-Ł2) 002 mph) « V / - Citation 40 'X -4 p (taat H-3-2) (29.8 moM Olfaction of / , foroaandcroan -f- - ■- - - - - - - - - - - , f wJW datatmmod ftuni ^ toad can data J / ' _____ """"" 5 Croan o«onnin*d from 7 ' &gt; y ' _____ """"" I aceatatomatar data J X ' I S "1 - I ^ r I „ "1 I // ' v ' „ 20 ^ v ļ ; o ¿- 1 JL -JÍ o 2 4 S a 10 12 14 16 18 20 22 24 » 28 30 Croan- at FIGURE 2 60° Force Crush For Side Impactor and Citation *»1 n.'TM1 ' ft! ^ ' - Ldatmowanr - | 0-Tajtoonftoumtton ^ (last *41) (28J mph) 90 ya" M " -, 1,1 1 11 Citatton (1«* łHl) &lt;40-2 men) « »W»or J ^ ^ Foma dataimtnod ' from load oa* data.

Committee of Common Market Automob ile Constructors (CCMC) Mobile Deform able Barrier In March, 1978, the CCMC formed an "Ad Hoc Group on Mobile Deformable Barriers."!/ Their work indicated that the Economic Commission of Europe (ECE) rigid Barrier was not suitable as a colliding vehicle, and that a Mobile Deformable Barrier (MDB) should be developed. Design parameters were based upon an average European car. From 1 976 sales figures, a mass determination of 950 kg ( 209Ó lbs) was established for the MDB. The barrier face was divided into 8 separate segments and force deflection curves were established, based upon mean values of the front of a European passenger car. The front face of the barrier was specified to be flat, vertical and normal to the barrier's longitudinal axis, without simulation of a bumper. The ground clearance of the deformation structure was set at 300mm (12 in), and could be expected to slide over the side door sills of most current cars impacted. The MDB consists of the following : 1. A rigid chassis of welded steel construction weighing 744 kg (1637 lbs) • 2. A 25 kg (55 lbs) deformable zone made of 2 (two) blocks of low density rigid urethane foam glued together and faced with 30mm (1.18 in) of low density rigid urethane foam for energy elements. A 2mm ( .08 in) aluminum front plate was added to spread the forces. An additional aluminum plate is added to the rear of the deformable zone to allow mounting to the rigid chassis with "Pip Pins." This ease of assembly can thus mitigate the effect of the ambient temperature at the time of testing , since the foam operates best at a stabilized temperature of 1 8-25°C ( 64-77°F) . The entire deformable assembly is wrapped in a thin plastic sheet to prevent foam scatter on impact. 3. Ballast is added to the back of the chassis to help produce the barrier mass of 950 kg (2090 lbs) . Testing indicated that the MDB' s behavior was repetitive enough to continue the research program further, and to deter- mine if the MDB is suitable for lateral impact testing at 90 °. To make construction simpler, the segment charac- teristics have been made symmetrical about the center- line of the barrier. Altera- tions and refinements will continue to be made as required to meet the characteristics of the "average European car" as conditions require. C. Side Impact Anthropomorphic Devices The development of test devices to represent humans in side impact testing has been on-going for many years. The Task Group reviewed the efforts of others in this field. Two advanced dummy designs are the Side Impact Dummy (SID) designed by the University of Michigan Highway Safety Research Institute ( the Institute recently changed its name to the Transportation Research Institute) and the Association Peugeot-Renault (APR) anthropometric device. A third test device, the ONSER 50 dummy has been developed as a research tool for safety. The reference for the Organisme National de Sécurité Routiere (ONSER) study available to the Task Group provides only a description of how the test device was developed .2/ A study done by Morgan, Marcus and Eppingerl/ on correlation of side impact dummy/ cadaver test concludes that the response of the SID dummy at the rib location has less cumulative variance than the APR dummy. The authors report, however, with respect to the spine, that neither dummy is clearly superior.</page><page sequence="6">2.360 T. F. MAC LAUGHLIN, ET AL. A study by Mellander and Bohl ini/ titled "A Comparison Between Different Dummies in Car to Car Side Impacts" concludes that the dummies could distinguish between the difference in side impact protection offered by various vehicles. The APR dummy gave chest deflection measurements in rather good agreement with tne injury predictions of the HSRI (SID) dummy. Morgan and Waters^/ of the NHTSA concluded in a study titled "Comparison of Two Promising Side Impact Dummies" that neither dummy matches all the acceleration vs. time corridors. The authors also state that the APR dummy appears too soft in the ribs and the SID dummy appears too stiff in the ribs. The Society of Automotive Engineers Human Biomechanic and Simulation Subcommittee (HBSS) of the Motor Vehicle Systems Testing Committee is evaluating the APR and SID anthropomorphic devices in a round robin test program using identical test conditions. The HBSS is con- ducting repeatibil ity and reproducability tests among laboratories and it is expected a report will be presented in the near future. The NHTSA has made an interim selection of the SID for use in its current programs. Design improvements made by NHTSA prior to the dummy's use in Agency programs unfortunately were not included in the versions being evaluated in the SAE round robin test program. Based on the currently available literature on comparisons of human surrogate test devices to cadaver tests , differences in responses for various test conditions exist. It is the judgement of the task group that further experimental effort is desirable for the development of improved bio- fidelity. The area of the upper torso and abdomen need to be refined for the various human surrogates. 2. Component Test Devices A. Ford Force Measuring Mechanical Test Devic e§J An experimental, 4 5 kg (99 lbs) impact test device is being developed by Ford Motor Company to help determine the energy absorbing and load- distribut ion charac- teristics of vehicle lateral interior components in the 90 degree impact configuration. The device has approximate biomechanical equivalence to male cadaver load-deflection data in the simulated areas of the rib cage, abdomen and pelvis. The device may be propelled into the vehicle component to be tested by being swung as a pendulum, by linear guided or free flight devices, or by use of the Hyge Sled. The test device consists of a one piece, non- articu- lated steel back-up structure to which are attached three sub systems - a "chest" unit, an "abdominal" unit and a "pelvic" unit. Provision also has been made to attach an optional dummy head and neck to the steel backing structure which adds 6.9 kg (15 lbs) to the mass of the test device. The 18.9 kg (42 lbs) simulated chest unit consists of a laterally guided, padded 4.6 kg (10 lbs) moveable mass positioned to represent the lateral chest wall (rib cage) of a dummy. Inward movement of the simulated chest wall is resisted by a 75 mm (2.95 in) diameter by 150 mm (5.9 in) long natural rubber cylindrical spring/damper. The rubber cylinder acts against a load cell mounted as part of the moveable section. Instrumen- tation for the chest unit is the load cell, a linear potentiometer to measure moving mass displacement, and two accelerometers; ore on the back-up plate and one on the moveable mass. The 4.5 kg (9.9 lbs) simulated abdominal unit consists of a shaped section of Dow Styrofoam DB (TM) , backed up by the central portion of the steel backing structure, and held in place by pointed screws through side plates.</page><page sequence="7">CRASH SURVIVABILITY 2.361 The Styrofoam has a minimum dynamic resistance of about 1 70 kPa (24.64 lbs/ in sq.), probably a low value for abdominal penetration . Penetration into the foam surface is the only measured criterion . The 21 . 6 kg (47.5 lbs) simulated pelvic unit consists of a wooden spacer, backed up by the lower portion of the steel back plate, to which is bolted a hollowed out rubber section shaped to the outer lateral contour of the Part 575 dummy pelvis. A load cell, located at the anatomical location of the dummy acetabulum (hip socket), is loaded through a hinged femur simulation. When a lateral load is applied to the femur forward of the greater trochanter loca- tion, the femur tends to simply move out of the way with reduced likelihood of serious damage to the pelvic structure. Thus, only those loads transmitted directly into the acetabulum area are measured by this test device. The upper flared out portion of the ilium, i.e., that upper portion of the hip bone that can be felt just below the waist, is simulated by a shaped, replaceable metal section protruding laterally outward from the wooden spacer in a cavity in the rubber flesh simulation. This metal section, which is currently bolted to the wooden spacer, was designed so that at a later date it can be mounted to the spacer by one or two load cells if measurement of load into the upper ilium is desired. B. NHTSA head and thorax impactors The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration, at its Vehicle Research and Test Center (VRTC) , is engaged in an experimental program to explore the feasibility of component testing using head and thorax impact test devices as a means of demonstrating levels of side impact pro- tection. U These devices have been constructed and pre- liminary feasibility testing has been done • The head device consists of an instrumented 5.45 kg (12 lbs) rigid head form riding in a guide cylinder. For thorax testing, the fully instrumented side impact dummy (SID) thorax is mounted on a fixture which rides in a guide cylinder. A hydraulic impact accelerator mounted on an adjustable frame is used to propel the head or thorax device against the desired region in the vehicle. Tests with the head impactor were performed on three vehicles. The seats and steering wheels were removed, but no special fixturing was necessary. Impacts were conducted into the A-pillars, roof rails and door window ledges at 1 6 km/h and 24.15 km/h (10 and 15 mph) . For gross comparative purposes, some of the A-pillar tests were conducted with a 25.4 mm (1 in) thickness of polyethylene foam. Thorax impact tests were conducted on two identical vehicles. The seats and steering wheels were removed, and the cars were rigidly fix tur ed to the floor. An exterior static crush test was performed to simulate the effects of a striking vehicle. A deform able crusher face plate (made of aluminum honeycomb) was maintained in contact with the exterior surface of the door, to simulate the presence of the striking vehicle, during the thorax/ door impact. Excellent repeatability was obtained from the two vehicles. Results from both head and thorax component tests were encouraging.. Future work will be directed toward attempting to correlate results with those obtained from full vehicle tests ( for the thorax) and from selected accident cases ( for the head) .</page><page sequence="8">2.362 T. F. MAC LAUGHLIN , ET AL. C . G. M. Head Area Impactor General Motors has developed a head area impactor to provide a laboratory tool capable of evaluating impact characteristics in vehicle upper interiors. A primary objective was to provide a compact device capable of reliable and repeatable opera- tion in the restricted confines of an automobile body. This device is proving to be useful and efficient in measuring energy absorption in windshield and body pillars , roof rails, door pads and instrument panels ( Figure 6) . The impact has a hemi-spherical face which is integral with a uni-directional bearing carriage. The moving carriage is guided by ball bushings on three concentric rails. The moving mass as currently constructed is 5.13 Kg. (11.3 lbs), however, ballast can be added to increase the mass to the 6.8 Kg. (15 lbs) used in FMVSS 201 impactors. The head- form radius is the mean of the G.M. Hybrid III Dummy upper head radii . The impact device has a total length of 396 mm (15.6 in.) and can be swivel ed in two axes on the end of the mounting beam to provide a 360O by 180° hemispherical range of action. The impact is propelled by a stored- ni trog en gas system which provides operating velocities from 9 Km/Hr to approximately 50 Km/Hr. A minimum pretest spacing of 131 mm (5.2 in.) allows for acceleration distance and stabilized velocity measurement. Crush depths up to 104 mm (4.1 in.) can be evaluated. The compact design of this device will allow a test to be conducted in spaces as short as 5Q0 mm or about 19.7 inches. Head form acceleration is measured by an integral accelerometer . The signal can be processed to obtain acceleration- time-his- tory data for impact analysis. The velocity of the head form prior to impact and after rebound is measured by an inter- rupted light beam transducer, providing data for energy dis- sipation calculation. Energy control systems are provided to absorb rebound energy and prevent multiple impacts. An over-travel energy control system is incorporated to prevent mechanical damage if the working travel is exceeded, as could happen if the device was actuated without a test surface in place. Electrical and mechanical interlocks are provided to pre- vent inadvertant actuation. This device is suspended on an offset beam support mounted on a vertical positioner, Figure 7. The vertical positioner is driven by a screw-jack mechanism to raise and lower the test device. Horizontal, in and out, side to side, and angular adjustment is accomplished by a horizontal positioner bed. The positioner moves easily on heavy duty rollers and is locked in place by air-operated stabilizer pads. The horizon- tal positioner is capable of supporting and clamping test components of various sizes up to and including full vehicles. The 3-axis adjustment provided by the positioners gives maxi- mum flexibility for passenger compartment evaluation in a body or vehicle.</page><page sequence="9">CRASH SURVIVABILITY 2.363 FIGURE 6 Head Iinpactor in Body FIGURE 7 Vertical &amp; Horizontal Positioners</page><page sequence="10">2.364 T. F. MAC LAUGHLIN , ET AL. The device is being used to evaluate and develop candidate interior energy absorbing designs. Velocity repeatability has been measured at 30 Km/Hr at + .07 Km/Hr . The acceleration- time- hi story plots have been found to be reliable and repeatable. This information, along with the ability to directly measure impact and rebound velocities have been very useful in studying efficiency in energy-management concepts. A more detailed descirption along with experimental drawings have been made available for public information 13 / # D. G.M. Thorax Area Impactor General Motors is experi- menting with a Thorax Area Impactor which is designed to produce the dynamic character- istics of an impact between an occupant1 s Thorax and the door inner surface. This is accom- plished by the use of a two element device consisting of a relatively light impact face which is loaded compliantly during impact by the inertia of a larger mass acting through a spring and shock absorber system ( Figure 8) . FIGURE 8 Thorax Impactor</page><page sequence="11">CRASH SURVIVABILITY 2.365 The compliance is modeled after known human Thorax response, measured in cadaver tests by Peugeot-Renaul tJjL/. Force-deflection relationships , shown in Figure 9, have been generated from the time dependent data measured. The initial stiffness varied from 2 Kn/Cm to 20 Kn/Cm. In addition, the total impact response varied from almost totally elastic to relatively inelastic. Because of this wide range of response in the measured cadaver data, the impactor is designed with pro- vision for adding damping or varying the spring rate. It is planned to study the effects of spring rate and damping on measured outputs to determine appropriate compliance char- acteristics. The objective is to develop a repeatable and reliable test tool that will be simple enough for efficient evaluation of body interior energy absorption charac- teristics (Figure 10). 4Př CAPMřt* rt&gt;M- otri g erto* c»*¥gt A" CÂ"'tM «"•"&gt; 7 tir J A„,„r tvtltAe§ TĒSTS A* A/M 37 PMOOĒē JPāPACĒ »**»/•» f 1# tm km/» mm/mm m E' / t /04 1# tm km/» mm/mm m y' E' t /#/ (f m . . , / 'A'' * &gt;** ( ° ' ' ) t I / /J Ar ^^ - - &gt; ¡[/fi / /J Ar ^^ . - "" - - - S' . ^ iff I // ß / ñ"'- . 1 / S' ^ I // 1 / ^ 1 / ' t A Pt»/» m i / 'I '/j i I Ä /]' / . ! /- . l7 /• / / i i I 1 Ä Ì 1 II I X A* / V ' . ¡ta' l7 ' / / i i - ,M" ' •' ' 1 i IA/ X V 5 •'/ ¡ta' //. ¡ / i - ' ' "• ////•/ •• v I ; •'/ l'//'f //. ¡ / I '»** ■ I S "• V / «• ; ¡Vi i • I ''i V H «• ' // ; f ¡Vi K i i • - * ¡y ''i / ' ' * ¡j :l //I } / 9 I i¡ :j/ļ C**sr romt* o*WLttr/m+ j jj ! ś' cutir ßomte fmicfwf 9 wtf o y , . ° / *• 3 * r 4 o I 1 J * r « Pgrircr/OA/ (c tm.) otri ter io* (€m) FIGURE 9 APR Cadaver Data</page><page sequence="12">2.366 T.

FIGURE 10 TORSO AREA IMPACTOR 0 COMPLIANCE REPRESENTING THE HUMAN THORAX 0 IMPACT MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY 0 VELOCITY MEASUREMENT CAPABILITY 0 PRE-CRUSH SUPPORT PROVISION The impact face weighs about 3.6 Kg. (8 lbs.). It slides freely on a central shaft inside the main moving unit, with a maximum compres- sion stroke of 51 mm (2.0 in.). Compression resistance is pro- vided by a coil spring and shock absorber. The total impactor unit, including the impact face plate, weights about 1 1 7 Kg . (53 lbs.). This moving unit, which is 72.4 Cm (28.5 in.) long, is suspended by two linear ball bearing units running on a 50 mm (2 in.) diameter shaft, and is propelled by a concentric stored gas system similar to the head area impactor. The moving unit has been designed to be compact enough to operate inside a vehicle passenger compartment. The 50 mm running shaft is mounted below a tubular beam which can be inserted through an open door or window. The unit is interchangeable with the head area impactor unit using the same vertical and horizontal positioning mechanisms, as well as the same pneumatic control unit .</page><page sequence="13">CRASH SURVIVABILITY 2.367 The impact intensity can be measured in three separate ways. These could be used individually or in combination. a) Deflection of the impact face with respect to the main moving unit. b) Acceleration of the impact face. c) Acceleration of the main unit. In addition, the main unit velocity can be measured just before impact and just after rebound which gives a direct measurement of the energy absorbing characteristics of the interior surface. The thorax area impactor is intended to be used to evaluate the component area of the vehicle interior that will provide energy absorption for the "second impact" between the occupant and the vehicle. The equipment, as currently developed, can use a single door, a partial body side, a full body or a full vehicle as a test article. In any of these cases, it seems reasonable that the test shows that the body side structure will maintain its interior energy absorbing capability after it has been subjected to the type of distortion which could result from the exterior collision. A simple way to evaluate this is to pre- crush, from the outside, the portion of the vehicle being tested by the impactor. G.M. is experi- menting with an exterior crush face as shown in Figure 11. The face is a solid bumper shape similar to that used for the Part 581 bumper test. Experience is showing that complexity in the bumper face is not necessary to accomplish an effective pre- crush opera- tion. The interior component tests described can show results that are direct, re pea tabi e and reliable. The areas that can be evaluated can cover any contactable area, much as current instrument panel tests do now. It would be reasonable to expect the lower interior immediately adjacent to the occupant to have a somewhat higher energy absorption capacity than the forward, less contactable areas. The upper interor test can cover areas that are seen as contact points in accident analysis (Figure 12) . E. External Crush G.M. has been experiment- ing with component test pro- cedures for external structure evaluation. While accident studies have identified the elements in exterior body structure that are effective in controlling crush or intrusion, it is not clear that control of intrusion is an effective method of reducing injury. It has been seen that many high- injury accidents have a substantial amount of intru- sion. At the same time, however, many low- injury accidents have also been found with high amounts of intrusion. The effects of controlling intrusion have been studied in a series of car-to-car accident reconstruction tests (Reference 13). These tests showed that while added structure could substantially reduce intrusion, this reduction, in turn, yielded progressively diminish- ing returns in impact reduction for the occupant, especially in terms of the additional mass required . Other tests (Reference 14) have shown that intrusion is not detrimental when effective interior energy absorption methods are used. This provides a basis for using the interior impactor for the performance test, using the exterior crush test described earlier with the thorax impactor as a means of evaluating the ability of the energy- absorbing interior structure to survive distortion before the impact with the occupant . Development is proceeding to provide a test for exterior integrity that will not compro- mise the more effective interior energy absorption capab ility .</page><page sequence="14">2 368 T. F.

Hinge and Lock Component Tests The performance goal for door hinges and lock tests is the assurance of body integrity under accident conditions. The low incidence of lock and hinge separations shown in accident studiesJOy is an indication that current hinge and lock test procedures are successful in promoting designs that will function well in real accidents. At G.M., test development is proceeding to include body and door attach- ment provisions in the tests for more effective evaluations. IV. INJURY DEFINITION FROM FIELD DATA The Task I Accident Data Analysis Group used two accident data bases to define and rank the predominant side impact injury categories, i.e., the body areas injured and the relation of these injuries to components of the vehicle that were contacted . The National Crash Severity Study (NCSS) file is a major accident data collection program of the National Center for Statistics and Analysis of the NHTSA. The NCSS file is a statistically designed, representative, random sample of passenger car towaway accidents, and it contains informa- tion on over 3,000 side impact accidents. The Motors Insurance Corporation (MIC) Injury-Accident File is an accident data base main- tained by General Motors Corporation (GM) . The file contains information on accidents involving GM vehicles which were current models in the year the data were collected and in which there vas an injury to at least one case-vehicle occupant. The MIC file has information on more than 5,000 passenger car side impact accidents. Using both the NCSS and the MIC data files, the injury categories for all side impact serious- to- fa tal injuries were ranked, and the results are presented in Table I. The rank order ings of the important side impact injury categories using MIC and non-adjusted NCSS data bases are in general agreement. (The adjusted NCSS figures will be discussed later.) In both files, the upper torso/side surface injury category is predominant. Upper torso/ steering assembly impacts occur with approxi- mately the same frequency. The most significant distribution difference is in the abdomen/side surface category where a higher percentage occurs in the NCSS file. Possible reasons for differences between the two files are discussed in Refer- ence 8. In addition, the percent of ser io us- to- fatal injuries in many of the injury categories varies considerably between the two data bases. The differences between the results from these files have at least two important sources: I ) The accident populations sampled by each file are different - NCSS represents towaway accidents to vehicles of all makes, while the accidents in the MIC file involve only GM cars in which there was an injured occupant. 2) The methods used to determine and define body region injured and object contacted differ between the two files - for example, NCSS uses a restric- tive procedure to obtain injury information, while MIC injury source information may be completed with an expert's "best guess." Injury category and injury mechanism data from the NCSS and MIC files are listed separately, due to the fact that Task Group I could not arrive at a meaningful way of com- bining the results from these two files . In the process of identifying leading injury categories, Task Group II made an adjustment to the thorax/side surface and abdomen/side surface categories. In the NCSS data under "Abdomen to Side Surface" injuries, two categories of abdominal injuries may be defined. These are "hard" and "soft" abdominal injuries. Hard abdominal injuries include injuries to organs or body regions protected by the lower thoracic cage. Soft abdomen injuries are those which clearly result from abdominal contact in the soft tissue area (unprotected by the thoracic cage). The Task Group made a judgment that hard abdominal injuries could be evaluated by an appropriate thorax injury criterion, and, therefore, can be more properly classified under the thorax/side surface injury category.</page><page sequence="16">2.370 T. F. MAC LAUGHLIN, ET AL. Accordingly, an estimate was made of the proportion of hard vs. soft abdominal injuries, using NCSS data. Specifically, those areas of the abdomen assumed to be protected by tne thoracic cage are injuries to the liver, kidney, spleen and respiratory system. Those injuries assumed to be soft tissue injuries involve the digestive and urogenital syst ems/ org an s . Those injuries classified as involving arteries, veins and muscles could be associated with either soft or hard abdominal injuries, and were divided evenly among soft and hard injury cate- gories. From reference §/ pages A-22 and A-23, 103 cases were identified with abdomen injury and side structure/armrests contact points. Of these, 72 cases were identified as hard abdomen, 20 cases as soft abdomen and 11 cases were distributed evenly. This resulted in 75% of abdomen injuries being shifted to the thorax/ side surface injury category. Appropriate adjustments were made to the accident data file and are reflected in Tables I and II which rank order injuries by frequency. The effects of several variables commonly used to charac- terize the mode and severity of side impact collisions on the ranking of the side impact injury categories were investigated using the NCSS. The results indicate that the injury category rankings differ by accident type (single vehicle impacts vs. all other impacts) and struck vehicle delta-V 20 mph vs. delta-V &gt; 20 mph) . The four distinct injury category rankings defined by the combination of these two side impact categorization variables are presented in Table II. The major injury mechanisms associated with each of the five most frequent injury categories were investigated using both the MIC and the NCSS data files. This informa- tion is presented in Table III, where the thorax to interior side surface category has not been adjusted to include "hard" abdominal injuries. As is seen, comparable major injury mechanisms were identified by both accident data files. Table IV contains injury mechanism distributions for the thorax to interior side surface category as adjusted to include "hard" abdominal injuries. It is evident that fractured bones and lung damage account for the vast majority of serious to fatal thorax injuries.</page><page sequence="17">CRASH SURVIVABILITY 2.371 TABLE I A Ranking of Injury Categories for All Non-Ejected Occupants Of Side Damaged Passenger Cars in Non-Rollover Accidents - Serious-To-Fatal Injuries - NCSS Adjusted* Nonadjusted MIC Injury Category Rank ' Percent Rank Percent Rank Percent Upper Torso/Side Surface 1 40.3 1 30.9 1 23.0 Upper Torso/Steering Assembly 2 8.6 3 8.6 2 7.9 Upper Tor so/ Instrument Panel 3 6.7 4 6.7 9 3.0 Pelvis/Side Surface 4 6.0 3 6.0 7 3.9 Head/Upper Side Structures 3 3.4 6 3.4 6 4.3 Neck- Spine/Non-Contact 6 3.8 7 3.8 8 3.2 Abdomen/Steering Assembly 7 3.6 8 3.6 11 2.4 Abdomen/Side Surface 8 3.1 2 12.3 3 3.7 Lower Extremities/Side Surface 9 2.7 9 2.7 Not Ranked Abdomen/Instrument Panel 10 2.4 10 2.4 Not Ranked Head/Side Surface Not Ranked 4 3.7 Head/Windshield Not Ranked 3 3.2 Other - 17.4 17.4 - 35.5 Total Injury Count Sampled 826 826 823 Weighted 923 923 923 * Includes "Hard" Abdomen/Side Surface in the Upper Torso/Side Surface category.

TEST DESCRIPTIONS 1 . Full Vehicle Test The conditions specified for full-vehicle crash testing and the the measurements that are made are determined primarily from the following considerations : (a) Accident data (collision conditions, injured body regions, etc.). (b) Vehicle population projections (vehicle weights and structural characteristics) . ( c) Purpose of performing the test(s) (determining rulemaking compliance, establishing crash- worthiness ratings, conducting product improve- ment research, etc.) . The accident data analysis performed in Task I has indicated that the majority of serious- inj ury-producing side collisions involve two vehicles in intersection- type crashes and that most of the remainder are single vehicle crashs. The NHTSA has been engaged in a pro- gram to develop improved side impact occupant protection through structural and interior vehicle modifications. The pri- mary criteria in the develop- ment program have been the dummy responses in two-vehicle crash tests. A side impact crash test program will be con- ducted soon by the NHTSA to evaluate these vehicle improve- ments in a variety of crash configurations, including single vehicle collisions, it is hoped that information from these tests will demonstrate that modifications designed to protect occupants in two-vehicle crashes will also provide protection in single vehicle collisions, and that occupant protection performance measured in a two-vehicle test can be extrapolated to the single vehicle collision. Specific conditions required for two-vehicle crash test( s) are: (a) Vehicle impact speeds.</page><page sequence="22">2.376 T. F. MAC LAUGHLIN , ET AL. ( b) Location of initial contact point . ( c) Angular orientation at impact . (d) Weight and structural characteristics of striking vehicle. An analysis conducted recently at the NHTSA1 s Vehicle Research and Test Center!/ has suggested the following values for these conditions: ( a) Impact speeds in the range of 64.4 kmph (40 mph) for the striking vehicle and 32.2 kmph (20 mph) for the struck vehicle for injury severities exceeding AIS 3. ( b) Initial contact point on the struck vehicle approximately 990.6 to 1016 mm (35 to 40 inches) forward of the C.G. (Injury is more severe when vehicle damage is sus- tained in the occupant compartment region) . ( c) 90 o and oblique angular orientations between vehicles. (Accident data indicate considerably higher frequency of 90° impacts, and a reasonably even distribution of other angles between 40° and 110°. Crash test data indicate the 60° impact to be a worst case orienta- tion in terms of structural damage.) (d) Moving barrier containing a crushable front struc- ture with force-deflection characteristics similar to those of a typical auto- mobile. Barrier weight of 1363. 63 kg (3000 pounds) (1 985 time frame). Values suggested above for impact speeds, initial contact location and barrier weight represent median values as derived from accident data and vehicle population projections. These values will be used in the aforementioned NHTSA crash test program. They differ slightly from values used in the NHTSA barrier development tests (reported in a previous section of this paper)? therefore, the first part of the crash test program has been designed to determine the representativeness of the barrier for the modified vehicle evaluation tests. Whether or not the above values are appropriate in a general sense depends strongly upon accident data details and the purpose of performing the tests. For tests conducted in a research program having as its objective the evaluation of vehicles under conditions which best represent the real world accident environment, several different test conditions having median values appear to be reasonable. On the other hand, for tests conducted to determine rulemaking com- pliance, test complexity might dictate only one test condition with values chosen to represent conditions seeking to maximize feasible net societal benefit. These values may or may not be median values. Consider next the deter- mination of measurements to be made during and/ or after the crash test( s) to best assess occupant protection perfor- mance. As previously reported, the thorax is by far the most frequently severely injured body region. It is, therefore, essential to obtain a measure of predictive thorax injury. (As previously mentioned, NHTSA has selected the Side impact Dummy (SID) for use in current Agency programs.) Other important injury categories which were cited in the Task Group 1 report are M soft" abdomen/side surface, pelvis/ s ide surface, and head/upper side structure. Although each of these categories accounts for a relatively small percentage of injuries exceeding AIS 2, as compared with the thorax/ s ide surface category, they should</page><page sequence="23">CRASH SURVIVABILITY 2.377 not be disregarded. First, because the accident data are sparse, the rankings and percentages are imprecise. Secondly, the relative rankings of injury categories involving the head were found by General Motors, in their examination of the MIC data, to be higher when subsets containing only the most serious injuries were considered. Consequently, it is advisable to employ state-of-the-art technology to measure dummy head, abdomen and pelvis responses. Finally, accident data indicate a high frequency of injury (especially to the head) associated with occupant ejection, suggesting the importance of measurements to minimize ejection. Possi- bilities would be: requiring that all parts of the dummy be contained within the occupant compartment during the crash test, and requiring maintenance of door hinge and lock integrity in a pull test conducted after the crash test. 2. Component Tests The test conditions that should be specified for component testing are determined from analysis of how each component functions in the spectrum of accidents in the side impact category. Since there is a wide variety of accidents in the side impact spectrum, and each component functions in its own way in each accident, it may not be necessary or even desireable to choose a specific accident condition that will be recreated in all tests. Each component can be evaluated for the most effective characteristics that apply to the range of side impact accidents. The test conditions should encompass sufficient criteria to assure that the particular component under test will perform satisfactorily in the range of accidents. When the component's function involves occupant contact in the accident, such as occurs with an interior panel, the test should represent the biomechani- cal interaction between the occupant and the component. The test conditions for components not involved with direct contact with the occupant can be expressed in terms of structural loading conditions. For example, an analysis of occupant trajectories in accidents indicates that most thorax contact with the door inner panel involves a substantially ninety-degree inter- action between the panel and the nearside occupant. Thus, a ninety- degree impact test using a test device as previously described that simulates the biomechanic compliance of a human thorax can evaluate the ability of the lower door interior to manage the collision between the panel and the occupant. Head contact analysis indicates a more random distribution of head impacts, thus a head impact test should be able to easily evaluate a variety of contact points. It would be desireable that the test outputs be in a usable form, with appropriate performance levels, to allow prediction of field injury reduction. Methods for this deter- mination have been suggested in the General Motors Reference #14, and are currently being studied. VI. COMPARISON OF FULL VEHICLE AND COMPONENT TESTS As an aid to the evaluation of the various candidate test procedures, a list of evaluation factors, in question format, was developed (see Figure 6). These factors were discussed in detail by the Task Group members in an attempt to determine the advantages and disadvantages of component and full vehicle test procedures to address the upper torso to side surface injury category, and to identify areas where further research and analysis would be desirable. The factors were grouped into the following four categories: 1 ) Definition of test conditions, which dealt primarily with how well the test conditions could be expected to correlate to accident conditions ( taking into account the variety of conditions occurring in the real world) ; 2) Validity of test output, covering how well the test output might relate to field injury charac- teristics and discriminate good from poor designs;</page><page sequence="24">2.378 T. F. MAC LAUGHLIN , ET AL. 3) Detection of synergistic, or interactive, effects, dealing with how well interaction effects between interior energy absorbing materials and side structure, between var ious structural elements, and between the striking object and struck vehicle might be simulated in the test(s); and 4) Test efficiency, concerned primarily with degree of complexity, repeatability and reproducibility of the test( s) . In addition to discussing how affirmatively each question could be answered (highly affirmative answers tend to be supportive of the test procedure under consideration) , the Task Group ranked the relative importance of each evaluation factor, or question. The rankings, expressed as numbers from 1 to 5 (5 being the most important) , are presented in Figure 13.</page><page sequence="25">CRASH SURVIVABILITY 2.379 FIGURE 13 Factors for Evaluating Side Impact Candidate Impact Tests Relat ive Importance R ankinq* DEFINITION OF TEST CONDITIONS - Does the test procedure: 1) Provide sufficient correlation of test conditions to field data? 3 Is it known what field collision intensity is represented by the test? 2) Cover an adequate spectrum of accident conditions? 4 Is it practicable to make the test procedure encompass a number of impact locations, angles, speeds, etc.? 3) Evaluate an appropriate area of the interior? 5 Is it practicable to make the test procedure cover a range of occupant size posture, trajectory, etc.? 4) Allow an assessment of potential ejection paths?

CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS In drawing its conclusions , the Task Group recognized that side impact tests need to be developed for a variety of applications, including: a) establishing compliance with possible future rul emaking , b) establishing crashworthi- ness ratings, and c) improving product safety through voluntary industry effort. 1. Both full vehicle and component tests should be developed to evaluate thorax- to- side interior surface impacts as they account for the vast majority of injuries of AIS 3 or greater (approximately 40%). The Task Group did not choose one test type (i.e., full vehicle vs. component) over another, as both have merit. Component and full vehicle test equipment and procedures, being developed by several organizations (CCMC, Ford, General Motors, NHTSA), show considerable promise. Comparing full vehicle with component tests, the Task Group concluded that a full vehicle test is better able to represent an actual field accident, since real world crash conditions and synergism are more accurately duplicated than in a component test. However, the full vehicle test is complicated, and involves considerable equipment, facilities and manpower to conduct. It follows that, for an equivalent level of effort, several component tests can be conducted under a variety of test conditions to simulate a variety of accidents. The main disadvantages of the component test approach are the lack of duplicating synergistic effects and the fact that correlation with real world accidents is less direct than with full vehicle tests. Results of the relative importance rankings of the evaluation factors led the Task Group to conclude that, for any given thorax to side interior surface test procedure, the following considerations are the most important: A) Accurately duplicating the injury category and injury severity occurring in the real world under a variety of conditions which reflect real world occurrences? B) Being able to discriminate levels of safety performance in different vehicle designs? and C) Having a high level of repeatability and reproducability , and a low level of test complexity. These conclusions resulted in identification of important areas for near term research, to support both full vehicle and component test development. These areas are as follows: a) Full vehicle tests: 1. Determining the validity of extrapolating results from one test condition to other conditions. 2. Establishing repeatability and reproducibility of test results. 3. Developing dummy improvements • b) Component tests: 1. Establishing correlation between test results and field data. 2. Determining the effects of parameters like side stiff- ness and occupant seating space on test conditions. 3. Determining importance of synergistic effects between interior energy absorbing panels and structure, or among various structural components .</page><page sequence="28">2.382 T. F. MAC LAUGHLIN, ET AL. 2. Upper torso- to- steering assembly was the second ranking injury category (approximately 9% of injuries of AIS 3 or greater) . No conclusions or recommendations regarding test procedures covering this cate- gory were developed, because steering column behavior is the subject of a separate coordinated NHTSA/MVMA Task Force, to be organized soon. 3. The following injury categories: (a) head-to-side interior surfaces ( b) abdomen- to- s ide interior surfaces ( c) pelvis- to- s ide interior surfaces are much lower in occur ance (each approximately 3 to 6% of injuries of AIS 3 or greater) . Ini- tially, less effort in the development of tests addressing these categories is warranted, until such time as tests addressing thorax to side interior and thorax to steering assembly are more fully developed.
