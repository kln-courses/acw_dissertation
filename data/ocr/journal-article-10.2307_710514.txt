<plain_text><page sequence="1">309 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW should be rejected in favour of the reading praetor. On this point one should consult Broughton's MRR i. 191 with n. 3. Throughout the introduction and commentary S. is scrupulous in citing and even quoting the work of other modern scholars, and he is judicious in presenting different points of view. Two recurrent themes are Hemina's apparent interest in local Italian traditions and his perceived Euhemerism (especially with respect to FF 1-5). The latter is conjectured to derive from Ennius' Euhemerus. S. employs Apulian iconographic evidence to help explicate the Origo's tale of Recaranus, whose name, emended to Trecaranus, is associated with a bull-headed and three-horned depiction of Hercules (p. 123). Leviticus is used to contextualize F 17 concerning Numa's injunction against using fish without scales as religious offerings (p. 162). The work, however, is not free of errors or oversights. For example, in F 39 concerning the alleged discovery of Numa's books in 181 B.C. S. regards the 535 years recorded for the interval between Numa's reign and the books' discovery as coming from Hemina (p. 194), whereas Pliny's use of the indicative mood in the pertinent relative clause embedded in indirect discourse shows that this datum has been supplied by Pliny himself in accordance with the standard Varronian chronology. Although this edition does not constitute the final word on Cassius Hemina, modern study of this subject has been advanced through S.'s care and diligence.

Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996. ?40/ $64.95. ISBN: 0-521-48147-0. B. sets himself high standards in commentaries on Cicero's speeches: he acknowledges only four 'full-scale scholarly' predecessors in English this century, namely those of the Nisbets on de Domo and in Pisonem, Austin on pro Caelio, and Kinsey on pro Quinctio (p. ix). His own work is a brilliant addition to this canon, which offers a constantly stimulating study of 'one of Cicero's most sensational speeches' (p. 62)-and amply justifies that claim. The introduction is generous in scope. In a section on the life of the defendant, B. is justly critical of received wisdom. P. Sulla is undoubtedly the dictator's nephew: an appendix (pp. 320-1) discusses why Dio's clear evidence for this view should previously have been neglected. The campaign for the consulship of 66 is seen as individual rivalry, rather than a clash between supporters and opponents of Pompeius (pp. 6-8). This is surely correct: perhaps one can also use an argument from silence, that there is no evidence linking Sulla and Autronius before the elections. In dealing with the circumstances of the trial, B. has a valuable discussion of Cicero's motives for speaking on Sulla's behalf (pp. 26-33). B. sees one motive in the opportunity for Cicero 'to display his lenitas and shake off the image of a rex peregrinus' (p. 28): this would be an occasion when he did not seek the condemnation of an alleged Catilinarian. Indeed, B. argues that Cicero should be commended for taking on the case. He stood to lose his reputation as a principled opponent of the conspiracy, should Sulla be condemned: yet 'it is likely that Sulla could have been ? Oxford University Press, 1997</page><page sequence="2">310 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW saved only by Cicero, since... Cicero's refusal to defend him would have been taken as proof of his guilt' (p. 42). Attractive as this picture of an upright and courageous Cicero is, another view is surely possible. B.'s excellent discussion of the charges against Sulla shows that while he may well have been guilty of uis for his own purposes, there was no convincing evidence that he had played a part in the conspiracy (pp. 33-9). If that was the position, how inevitable was his condemnation had Cicero not defended him? Cicero would not have wanted to give evidence against an alleged Catilinarian who was then acquitted: that would indeed have fixed his character as implacably vengeful. His motive may be that he realized Sulla could well be acquitted, and therefore-as there was no neutral position for Cicero about the conspiracy-he had to be part of the defence. A further motive for Cicero's defence, for B., lies in Sulla's network of connections, particularly his possible marriage to Pompeius' sister: defending Sulla was a way in which Cicero could counter the offence he had given Pompeius after the suppression of the conspiracy. Given that B. expects to be consulted as well as read (p. xi), it is unfortunate that he does not refer to his earlier discussion (p. 3), and gives the impression at this point that it is a fact that Sulla was Pompeius' brother-in-law (p. 28). The whole argument is on slightly shaky foundations (perhaps I am happier than B. about unattested Memmii [p. 3 n. 11]). But, even if the marriage connection existed, was it enough to make Sulla's fate a matter of serious concern to Pompeius? Sulla's subsequent actions-support for Clodius, prosecution of Gabinius, possible participation on Caesar's side in the civil war (pp. 11-13)-are not necessarily incompatible with close relations with Pompeius in the late 60s, but do not provide support for believing in them either. A final consideration for B. is the substantial loan that Sulla made Cicero to help him buy a house on the Palatine. B. must be right to see this as a token of gratitude rather than a bribe, even though it was a breach of the lex Cincia (pp. 40-1). Money cannot explain Cicero's defence, when so much was at stake for him politically in this trial. The final part of the introduction deals with the manuscripts (pp. 63-79). B. has already published Gulielmius' collation of E, (CQ n.s. 39 [1989], 400-7) and is thus able to provide fuller reports of this manuscript, which is now largely lost, than any other edition. He also shows that B and W, hitherto considered on a par with P and K, can be dismissed as copies of P (pp. 68-71). This leads to a welcome simplification of the apparatus. B. provides a complete collation of the seven principal manuscripts he uses, though, with consideration for the reader, he dismisses most of the variant readings of P and K to an appendix (pp. 322-5). Some of the manuscripts are in B.'s view female (p. 66: 'the sister of E. . .'; p. 67: 'a lost sister of T): perhaps anthropomorphism could stop at 'sibling'. The commentary is detailed and wide-ranging. Space allows reference to only a selection of the good things in it. On the textual front, B. certainly fulfils the hope he expresses of escaping from the 'best manuscript' approach to textual criticism (p. 74). In particular, B. systematically uses prose rhythm as a criterion for choosing between variants. B.'s text is conservative (e.g. 55.7, where he attempts to justify the manuscript reading), but he includes some excellent emendations (53.4 he resurrects Schliack's brilliant curiam; 71.8 deprensionibus (Hakanson); 76.12 he prints his own collecta for confecta, giving a much more convincing use of medical imagery). There is incisive linguistic comment (e.g. 1.13n. justification for redomiti; 72.5n. his explanation for the imperfect subjunctive) and a sensitive attitude to Cicero's use of imagery (1.2n. agricultural metaphor; 79.9n. on arma). The detailed comments on Cicero's</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 311 argumentative strategy are lucid and enlightening (11.7n. on why he pretends to ignorance of the 'first conspiracy'; 22.6n. how he turns Torquatus' jibes against Torquatus; ??67-8n. explaining why he accepts Torquatus' misrepresentation of Pompeius' letter; 69.12n. the rhetorical potential of assuming that character does not change). Realien are not ignored (20.4n. which Messalla?; 61.8n. discussion of the charges concerning Sulla's activities at Pompeii). Some minor points: 5. ln. B.'s unquoted supporting references show that ornamenta ac lumina is only one of a number of possible honorific collocations (and Caec. 28 is a sarcastic use): Cicero's precise choice is not explained by the parallels; 12.14n. the occurrence of comperi does not necessarily suggest 'that Cicero's enemies had not yet begun to taunt him with the word when our speech was published' (p. 156). He could be using the word in ironic self-parody while he explains that he knows nothing about the so-called first conspiracy; 31.1n. what is absurdum is surely that Torquatus does not realize (says Cicero) that speaking loudly does not exclude the iudices, even though speaking softly does exclude the corona; 37.5n. the issue must be whether Sulla had, or was considered to have, consular ancestry; 78.6n. a pun on Torquatus' name in torqueatur is an attractive idea: further support for it comes from B.'s own suggestion that Cicero implies that Torquatus is abnormally cruel (90.1 ln.).

Pompei und Livius 1,1-26,8 kolometrisch ediert, kommentiert und statistisch analysiert (2 vols). Pp. 938 (1-499 + 500-938). Oelde: Druckerei R. Festge, 1995. Paper. ISBN: 3-00- 000-383-5. In the first part of this lengthy work S. analyses and discusses the colometry of Cicero's Imp. Pomp. and labels the clausula with which each colon ends. Her notation mostly follows familiar lines: I = - w - - x (I3 indicates that the third syllable is resolved, as in esse videatur); II = - - - - - x; III = - - - x; IV = - - - - x. More unusually she describes (ad)flictae fortunae as 's I' (i.e. I with a spondee substituted for the initial trochee), and (ad)fertur regibus as 's IV' (it is often treated as a variation of II). Any notation is arbitrary and this one may seem cumbrous, but it usually has the merit of beginning the clausula with a word-accent (see A. Primmer, Cicero Numerosus [Vienna, 1968], 184ff.); indeed, on this principle one might analyse the clausula of 28 provincias confecit not with S. as a double-spondee but as a triple-trochee with the fourth syllable lengthened. S. also records the foot that immediately precedes the clausula proper; thus (ex)ercitusque permagnos is described as 'Tr. + I'. This information is usually a needless complication, but may be relevant when type III is preceded by a cretic or type IV by a trochee; it is significant that ante-consonantal atque is used to help the clausula at Clu. 194 atque crude- litatem and Cat. 4.14 atque diligentia (pointed out by G. O. Hutchinson, CQ 45 [1995], 485). S.'s treatment of colometry is based on Fraenkel's Leseproben aus Reden Ciceros und Catos (Rome, 1968), and she provides a useful critique of his work as well as of some other modern contributions.
