<plain_text><page sequence="1">THOMAS KEENAN Freedom, the Law of another Fable It is popular to talk about freedom, but how many of us in the world are sure we are talking about the same thing when we use the word? Uhuru in Africa is different from liberty in Philadelphia. Freedom in Hollywood is not quite what libert6 is in Paris. Nor is freedom in Washington exactly what's meant by the word svoboda in Moscow, or tszuyu in Peiping.... This peculiar word "freedom"-with hundreds of definitions-has been debased in the coinage of communications. It might be helpful to go back to the original derivation of word-. . . the word "liberty" traced back to its roots means "growing up" or "/maturing" or "taking responsibility." -Ronald Reagan' I. READING SADE? What happens (to us)-if anything, which cannot of course be taken for granted before the fact-when we read? Is reading possible, and are we free to do it? Since we only ever read something, no matter how ill-defined or trembling its status as an object for a subject might be when reading is the verb, a response calls for an example. With Sade, for example, Michel Foucault has lyrically suggested just the opposite: The precise object of "sadism" is not the other, nor its body, nor its sovereignty: it is all that could be said [c'est tout ce qui a pu etre dit]. Even farther and still in retreat [encore en retrait], it is the mute circle where language deploys itself: to this whole world of captive readers, Sade, the captive, withdraws the possibility of reading [a tout ce monde des lec- teurs captifs, Sade, le captif, retire la possibilit6 de lireJ.2 Are we-captive, captivated, obsessive, everyday and everynight readers that we unavoidably are-free to read Sade?

With the possibility of reading withdrawn from those who can still nevertheless be called (and be called readers), does the opposition of freedom and necessity retain any pertinence? In this impossibility, who responds? More exactly, who is addressed? After all, as Foucault rightly continues, this possibility of reading has been withdrawn so effectively, "so well, that to the question of knowing to whom the work of Sade was addressed (and addresses itself today), there is only one answer: no one [si bien, qu'a la question de savoir a qui s'adressait (et s'adresse de nos jours) 1'oeuvre de Sade, il n'y a qu'une reponse: personnel" (50;62). Who reads, and how, a text addressed to no one, and what status does it have? Something happens. This text "withdraws from itself-but by confiscating it in a gesture of repetitive appropriation- the space of its language; ... it can, and in the strict sense, must [devrait] continue without stopping [sans arret], in a murmur that has no other on- tological status than that of a ... .contestation" (50;62-63). We, and others,3 encounter this murmure sans arret every time we let ourselves be called by a text not destined for us, and it goes without saying that no text is ever (structurally speaking) addressed particularly to one or more of us; it could not be a text, something written or said in a language, if it were able to specify its reader.4 A text is an open apostrophic structure, a call incapable of encoding in advance or predetermining the response it might receive or who might give it. Addressed, to no one. Evidently, that is reading's only chance, its terrible freedom and its exhilarating captivity. It is this possibility-reading Sade-that Maurice Blanchot has put into question more rigorously than any other reader of Sade.5 "Whoever has read in Sade only what is readable there, has read nothing [Qui n'a lu dans Sade que ce que Sade a de lisible, n 'a rien 1u],"6 concludes the opening paragraph of Blanchot's reading of Sade's "Frangais, encore un effort si vous voulez etre republicains," the revolutionary political tract inscribed (and read aloud) 3.

What else is there in the text of Sade, if the activity of reading exceeds merely what can be read? In other words, if what is simply readable is nothing, as far as reading goes, then reading what can already be read is not enough, is not even reading. How? What can be read has already been read, and reading it amounts to nothing more than applying a ready-made interpretive code to a set of signs, in order to (re)interiorize their essentially accidental exteriority. What is to be read here is something else, neither something already read, nor even something readable, but some excess of inscription of language that remains when the work of reassimilat- ing or incorporating the readable is done, a textual element not susceptible of being reduced to something codable. There is much in Sade ready to be decoded and understood-the text calls out for this rationalization: what Blanchot has called "la raison de Sade" can never be underestimated. But Sade's interpreters pay the price of erasing what cannot be read in his text, which is to say his text insofar as it is a text, language, and not merely meaning or saying something. Granted that what Sade has to say, what is readable there, is difficult enough. But over- coming the interferences posed by his text and its language for the sake of what it has to say-no matter how enlightening, outrageous, dangerous, even evil-is not reading. Nothing could be more deluded than to expect that we could avoid that work, and simply be done once and for all with interpreting, making sense. Except perhaps thinking that it is all there is to do.8 Which means that (1) we never read just once, and (2) what Blanchot calls reading demands the risk of a terrible insusceptibility, a resistance to affect or pathos, the radical in-difference Sade calls apathie, without pathos.9 "Too bad for those whom these great ideas corrupt, too bad for those who fasten only upon the evil in philosophical opinions, susceptible of being corrupted by everything....

Who? Personne. II. WHAT DO YOU CALL WHAT WE'RE DOING? What enables-which would be also to say, what disables-reading? Blanchot's answer is difficult enough: language, and its ease. "Sade is diffi- cult reading. He is clear, his style is easy, his language without detour? (IM, 10). Everything is called by its name(s): "He aspires to logic; he reasons," and the reason is that of the logos, the word that names and relates, properly. Sade's ease, the clarity and distinction in representation, by which the "great truths" (525;329) he has to tell are brought into the light of day and discourse, finds its privileged example in those opening moments of La Philosophie during which Eugenie learns the correct and proper names, sans detour, for a bewildering variety of organs and activities (especially the "lesson" in the third dialogue, 396-404; 199-208). For example: Eugenie.- ... But a word, dear friend, a word has just escaped you again and I don't understand it. What do you mean by this expression whore? Pardon me, but you know, I'm here to learn. [Mais un mot, chere amie, un mot vient de t'Vchapper encore, et je ne l'entends pas. Qu'entends-tu par cette expression de putain? Pardon, mais tu sais? je suis ici pour m'in- struire.] [404;208] Eugenie.-Oh, dearest, what pleasures you give me! ... What do you call what we're doing there? [Ah! ma bonne, que tu me fais de plaisir!. Comment appelle-t-on ce que nous faisons la?] [400;204] In more ways than one, "j'appelle un chat un chat" is the strategy of the Sade of the Philosophie. 10 But the will to clarity pushes beyond the striving for precision in descriptive vocabulary and grammatical linkages to the modality of their rhetorical deployment. If there are many questions about the articulation of names with things and activities here, and just as many answers, the emphasis is nevertheless on the naming as such, the activity of calling or giving names itself- "j'aime qu'on me nomme ainsi," says Saint- Ange (404;208). For Eugenie, here to learn, the learning is (in) naming, the lesson is a lesson in names, not simply about names, in general or in particu- lar, but an event in naming. The text underlines the constitutive duplicity of naming and calling: both the inaugural gift of an insignia, the bestowal of a name, and the interpellation or identification of the bearer of a name by 10.

Reading as understanding takes this latter articulative, rela- tional moment as its focus, determining the name as the coded, significant, meaningful marker (whether literal or figurative, it matters not, as Eugenie and her teachers demonstrate) or the thing. But the success of this effort depends on an active moment that cannot be incorporated into this cog- nitive economy-the name as affirmation, as call. "Something," Blanchot writes, "is sought in Sade. The search, which is that of a new lucidity, is not pursued in an interrogatory mode by rather by clear, assured, and always decisive affirmations" (IM, 13). What is affirmed in Sade? The search proceeds through the postulates and demonstrations of "analytic reason," but one which for Blanchot is attracted by something else it can in no way account for. Reason and its names, the sunshine of en- lightenment, find themselves exceeded by themselves, propelled or inter- pellated, drawn out from themselves, by their very articulation, by their capacity to reason or to name, called to affirm (in the name of reason) some- thing else, something other than reason or the proper name, that remains hidden in the nocturnal darkness of language and thus exercises a certain magnetism. For Blanchot, Sade is difficult not because something is left unsaid or unreasoned in an irrational obscurantism, but because "reason is excessive" (IM, 15), and because of the "alliance, the mixture of a clarity and an obscurity, which troubles and complicate our reading, renders it inter- nally violent" (IM, 14). The difficulty is that the obscurity can thus not simply be cleared up by more reasoning or better names; it is in fact just that attraction to say or do more, that exigence d'exces, in which naming and reading are not halted or negated but disturbed, complicated, suspended, temporalized, repeated-which is to say-affirmed, demanded, called for. There is no one name or thing to read here, but a mixture, more than a name. More than any name as a coded unit(y) in a signifying system, more than meaning(s). Reading is in trouble because names affirm, call to others be- yond anything they or any reason can possibly account for-the force, the interruptive intervention of this elsewhere opened by the call, complicates reading by refusing to let it stop, tears it apart by attracting it beyond itself without going anywhere else. "This exigence d'exces does not affirm simply his right to reason . .. but knows itself more reasonable than it [reason]" (IM, 14-15). The affirmation of the name, more than an answer to a ques- tion, resists understanding even as it demands it and as it frustrates any attempt to stop, to treat it as simply impossible (no despair or nihilism here). Sade, perhaps, is crazy, as we all must be in our best nocturnal hours, but what he writes does not succumb to such a judgment. The sign [of this] is that we always leave off [sortons] reading him less troubled in sensibility than belied [crazed] [dementis] in thought, not convinced, but somehow</page><page sequence="6">236 Yale French Studies incited [proposes] to a way of understanding which escapes us and still attracts us. From there, in spite of ourselves and regardless of our desire for a simple logic, we take up reading again, carried away by a movement which will no longer stop. [IM, 13] It is this movement away, on and on, this self-exceeding reading in spite of our selves, which must be read here, in Sade and in Blanchot. "Frangais, encore un effort" is structured by this repetitive movement, the movement of encore un effort itself, and it calls on a twisted or divided temporal 'logic' to teach a difficult lesson in reading its affirmations-all those names. "I'm here to learn," says Eugenie, and the lesson we learn with her is not about something else, not even about itself as some object called language. The lesson is nothing other than (the) reading, insofar as it depends on and cannot fail to encounter language or a text (in its possible unreadability) again and again, without pathos [a-pathiel but simply as what happens. And it is taught by example. III. THE FABLE OF FREEDOM In fact, all of La Philosophie dans le boudoir is nothing if not a pedagogical text, and more precisely a text which teaches about (the ethics and politics of) teaching, even if the famous altered letter in its epigraph suggests a kind of oscillating hesitation over the proper relation that reading might take up with regard to that teaching. Where the Philosophie's first edition bore the epigraph "the mother will prescribe its reading to her daughter," the next version found the mother giving contrary orders: "the mother will proscribe its reading to her daughter." The text, though, argues that the most effective instruction is given not by command-whether prescription or proscrip- tion-but by example. If it teaches most effectively, as it often suggests, by "joining a little practice to the theory [joignant la pratique a la theorie]" (398;202), its theory and its practice share the trait of progressing by exam- ple (as the preface "Aux Libertins" spells out in recommending that its addressees follow its "models" and "examples" [309; 185]). Recall the advice of "Frangais, encore un effort": that to make good citizens one should "give them ... many more examples than lessons [donnez-leur sur ce grand sujet [Dieu] plus d'exemples que de legons]" (499;305). The lessons given by the "instituteurs immoraux" rely again and again on the enumeration of exam- ples, not only the tableaux vivants acted out or practiced by the teachers and their eager student (as well as her considerably less willing mother), but also a multitude of more abstract models from Socrates to the Romans to the Tahitians, from the animal kingdom to the world of plants and minerals. We will borrow a word from Sade and call these examples fables, taking se-</page><page sequence="7">THOMAS KEENAN 237 riously their tendency to draw didactic lessons from the so-called natural world in the manner of La Fontaine or the authors of Aesop's. The fables are generally deployed to provide models of ethical action, to instruct their readers in what must (prescription) or must not (proscription) be done. (The classical fable teaches the one who is free how to exercise that liberty, how to enjoy it responsibly. It takes freedom [to know, to act, and to speak] as its presupposition, and teaches it as a practice. It defines freedom as self-knowl- edge, as knowing one's name and living up to or within it.) That Sade's ethical tales conclude in immorals rather than morals in no way changes their structure, and only confirms their (perhaps disturbing) pedagogical force. For example-but it is not just one example among other, concerning as it does freedom-consider the problem raised by "la belle et depravee Saint- Ange" (IM, 9) midway through the third dialogue." Mme De Saint-Ange.-Listen to me, Eugenie. It is absurd to say that as soon as a girl is weaned from her mother's breast she must from that moment become the victim of her parents' will, and remain that way to her last breath. It is not in a century when the extent of the droits de 1'homme has come to be widened with so much care that girls ought to continue to believe themselves their families' slaves, when it is clearly established that these families' powers over them are absolutely chime- ric. [414;218] Faced with this illusion or fiction of dependence, an example from what is called "nature" is provided in order to demystify or delegitimate the belief- this is the basic gesture of La Philosophie, a relentless hammering away at the idols as merely fictional constructs: chimera, fantasms, phantoms, ghosts, . . . fables. And more often than not-this is the excessive move- ment marking this text-this antifable is itself structured as a fable. Here is what Mme. de Saint-Ange says: Let us listen to nature on such an interesting question, and let the laws of animals, so much closer to her [nature], provide us for a moment with examples. Do paternal duties among [animals] extend beyond primary physical needs? Do not the fruits of the pleasure of male and female possess all their freedom, all their rights? As soon as they are able to walk and feed themselves, from that instant, do the authors of their days recog- nize them? And do they [the young, in their turn] believe they owe some- thing to those who gave them life? Doubtless not. 11. For another, even more explicitly fabulous, example, see the tale of the wolf and the lamb in Justine, 176-77; 608.</page><page sequence="8">238 Yale French Studies Fabula docet: By what right thus are the children of men compelled to other duties? ... Is it not prejudice alone that prolongs these chains? ... Let us hope that eyes will be opened and that in assuring the freedom of every individual the fate of unhappy girls will not be forgotten; but, if they are so unfortu- nate as to be forgotten, then of their own accord rising above usage and prejudice let them boldly trample the shameful irons with which we presume to subjugate them. [414;219].12 The standard elements of the classical fable are present here: the turn to animals for examples of human behavior (one paragraph later Saint-Ange suggests to Eugenie that "the destiny of the woman is to be like the female dog or wolf [comme la chienne, comme la louve]"), the claim that such examples constitute laws ("les lois des animaux . .. nous servent un mo- ment d'exemples"), and the narrative structure of a movement in time from one condition (dependence) to another (freedom) turning on a decisive mo- ment ("de's cet instant"), here, an instant of self-recognition and self-suffi- ciency ("sitot qu'ils peuvent marcher et se nourrir seuls"). Sade's fable warps this third element, though, in making the instant of emancipation, the break into the condition of freedom, itself break with the conditions of possibility for the first condition (namely, recognition of the other). It makes a difference, because this fable is an argument about free- dom, a declaration of Eugenie's independence-a radical break which cuts off any relations of recognition and indebtedness, in either direction, be- tween the animal and its offspring. The narrative tells the story of the move- ment from a narrative (I authored you, I come from you, I depend on you) to the oddly anarrative (I owe you nothing, I do not recognize you, you?). It relates relation and irrelation, narrates the break into something that makes narrative impossible.'3 This implies that the movement is irreversible, in the sense Paul de Man gives to that word.'4 The outcome-since it is not based on a dialectic of master and slave or of ressentiment-rather than reaffirming them ruins the conditions that gave rise to it. No recognition, no authority, no duty. No mirror. Independence does not depend, here, even negatively, on that from which it has separated. The fable (mythos) spells trouble for the logos, the relation, that it seems to serve, in that freedom or 12. In "Franqais, encore un effort" this critique occurs at 517; 321. 13. It goes without saying that the possibility of a narrative articulation between parent (more exactly, mother) and child (daughter) is put at stake by La Philosophie dans le boudoir.

Henceforth cited in the text.</page><page sequence="9">THOMAS KEENAN 239 emancipation is exemplified as the absolute absence of relation or tie, as doing without.15 Hence Saint-Ange can spell out the fable's immoral as a lesson in corporal singularity and natural autonomy, iterating and reiterat- ing: "Your body is yours, yours, alone [ton corps est a' toi, a' toi, seule]; in all the world there is only you who has the right to enjoy it and to make it enjoy as seems good to you" (417;221). Blanchot recasts the moralite of the fable as follows: Each of us must do as he pleases, each of us has no other law than his own pleasure.... This morality is based on the primary fact of absolute soli- tude. Sade has said it and repeated it, in every conceivable form: nature has it that we are born alone, there is no sort of relation [rapport] between one person and another (LS, 19/CJ, 40). Of course, just because it's impossible doesn't mean it doesn't happen. If there is a relation to others, we owe it to nothing other than this impos- sibility-because no subject masters the time and space of the encounter, deprived as we are of any ground of symmetry or reciprocity on the basis of which it might recognize itself or any other, we are instead opened by it. From the singularity of this event are derived what Sade calls freedom and rights ("all their freedom, all their rights"). We will return to this. This fabulous declaration of independence'6 is structured by the logic of the encore: Sade insists that this fable (the animal law of liberty) takes a prior fable, precisely insofar as it is a fable, for its target. The next application of the lesson concerns the liberation from the purely fictional or conven- tional bonds of marriage (first the family, then marriage). "To chain them by the absurd link of a solitary marriage [hymen] is obviously to outrage the fate [destination] that nature imposes on women" (415;219), holds Mme. de Saint-Ange; later she urges "among all the bonds to be burst, those whose annihilation I'd recommend first would surely be those of marriage. . . . No, Eugenie, no, it is not for that end that we are born; those absurd laws are the work of men, and we must not submit to them" (418-19; 222-23). Thanks to the example from the laws of animals, that man-made institution, and its pretensions to law, have already been dismantled. "We are rid of this chimera today" (420;224), she says. What a wife does is of concern to her only, and dishonor or outrage no longer matter; the only harm done is to 15. On "doing without," see Derrida, "Limited Inc a b c," trans.

The fable of freedom, having recourse to a more originary order of exis- tence, undoes the aberrant laws of human institutions with examples from what Hegel called "the animal kingdom of the spirit."'7 Blanchot: "la pre- miere et la derniere instance, c'est la nature. Autrement dit, pas de morale, c'est le regne du fait" [the first and last instance is nature. In other words, no morality; the fact reigns] (LS, 40;JC, 62). Frangais, encore une fable. It ex- poses human morality and ethics as fictive constructs, inventions sub- stituted for nothing, mere phantoms entirely lacking in (any justified claim to) existence if not in effect. In a word, it reveals instituted law as fable, by telling a fable. It exposes it to its fabulous origin with a fable of origin. A certain political tradition has made of this exposure the definition of liberty. Isaiah Berlin associates it with "Marx and his disciples," but it de- scribes this moment in Sade's argument quite well. Freedom is understand- ing that social institutions are created by humans, unmasking the "myth" that "man-made arrangements [arel independent forces."'8 Not until we have reached a stage at which the spells of these illusions could be broken, that is, until enough men reached a social stage that alone enabled them to understand that these laws and institutions were themselves the work of human minds and hands, historically needed in their day, and later mistaken for inexorable, objective powers, could the old world be destroyed.... [143] Freedom or liberation is the event of this understanding: knowing and acting are articulated in the free subject, define it as free. This "understanding is appropriate action." I am free if and when I understand this negative lesson, and a positive lesson as well: that laws are necessary. I am free then only if I in turn impose a law on myself "having understood [that . .. ] it conforms to the necessities of things" (143-44). Berlin associates this "positive" concept of freedom (distinguished as "profoundly divergent and irreconcilable" [166] from the "negative" liberty of simply "not being interfered with by others" [123]) with "the thought and language of all the declarations of the rights of man in the eighteenth century, and of all those who look upon society as a design constructed according to the rational laws of [among other things . .. ] nature" (148). The free subject of this law recites this creed: I wish, above all, to be conscious of myself as a thinking, willing, active being, bearing responsibility for my choices and able to explain them by 17. "Le Regne animal de l'Esprit" was the original title of Blanchot's "La Litterature et le droit a la mort," in Critique 18 (November 1947): 387-405; Blanchot quotes the phrase at LDM, 295. 18.

I am free because, and in so far as, I am autonomous. I obey laws, but I have imposed them on, or found them in, my own uncoerced self. [136] The self-understanding of the transparently reasonable and readable subject depends on its definition as natural, and nature means possibility. Berlin paraphrases: "Knowledge liberates not by offering us more open pos- sibilities amongst which we can make our choice, but by preserving us from the frustration of attempting the impossible" (144). This attempt, of course, is what Sade's text does not seek to evade, in spite of its deep investment in nature and its laws, and the effort ultimately puts the possibility of this self-understanding into question. Here, though, knowledge does liberate, as it has before-after all, this is not even the first fable to be exposed (nor is it the last). This undoing gesture defines the movement of Sade's text, and especially in "Frangais, encore un effort," In fact, the particular critique of ethical norms (here, family and marriage) as fabulous inventions which we have just followed is itself based on a previous critique of fables. The first section of "Frangais, encore un effort," having taken for granted the practical revolutionary demystification of royal au- thority, is devoted to religion, before morals even get into the act, and the program is unambiguous: "let us not be content with breaking scepters, we will pulverize the idols forever" (494;300). What we might call Sade's first critique, in this relentlessly enlightening text ("j'aurai contribue en quelque chose au progres des lumieres, et j'en serai content" [490;296], concludes the tract's opening sentence), is of that particular rhetorical aberration by means of which organized human religions have claimed the right or the ability to speak on behalf of the divine, or rather, as Sade puts it, to make the gods speak. This ventriloquism of the "dieu vain" [empty god] (494;300) or more strictly speaking the prosopopeia by which the absent-whether dead, never alive, or simply in flight-are given a face and a voice and make to speak, has been for Sade the second and perhaps the most important victim of the Revolution he now seeks to "consolidate" or render permanent (497;303). We sensed that this chimerical divinity, prudently invented by the first legislators, was in their hands only a way to chain us, and that, reserving to themselves alone the right to make this phantom speak, they knew very well to make it say only what would support the ridiculous laws by which they pretended to serve us. [494;300] Hence the call to practice the critical gesture, yet again, and behead "a phantom more illusory still [encore] than a king could ever be" (498;303). Even if the priests have been dispatched along with the king, their human all-too-human artifact "that infamous and fabulous religion" (490; 296) sur-</page><page sequence="12">242 Yale French Studies vives, living on to haunt the already considerable effort of demystification with the threat of a relapse, in spite of its essential "incoherence with the system of liberty" (495;301). Freedom is freedom from fable, and this rhe- torical survival, no matter how aberrant its animation was and continues to be, still plays its role in fable and requires, for the sake of freedom, "encore un effort; since you labor to destroy all prejudices, do not let any of them subsist, because it only takes one to bring them all back" (495;301). Where fable had taught-and chained-before, a resolutely human and freely chosen (that is to say, freely read) institution and its laws will now take its place: "Let us take the greatest care to avoid mixing any religious fable into our national education. Never lose sight of the fact that it is free men we want to shape [former]: (498;304). For the free, namely those "with- out religious fables," the responsibility that keeps them free is "to enjoy [nature] and to respect its laws, laws that are as wise as they are simple, that are written in everyone's heart, and it is only necessary to interrogate this heart to discern there its impulse" (498-99;303-04). Because humans are natural, the freedom from fable is as simple as reading or understanding oneself. The fable and the laws of its creatures are to be replaced with an enlightened, reasoned, education in human institutions, as human a lesson in human autonomy (self-legislation) and autolegibility. Laws do not need to be dictated from elsewhere, interpreted by others through their puppets, when they can be read freely and independently in each human (body and spirit). Immediately, however, the status of these laws is put in question as well-which is the point at which we entered this structure some pages earlier. If gods have been first displaced by humans, it does not take very long-only another effort-to remove humans from any position of privi- lege: we need only quote again Mme. de Saint-Ange's first fable. "These absurd laws are the work of men, and we must not submit to them." Not only divine animation but also human law is "only a fable, whose existence is impossible." Where the first critique had seemed to suggest that it would suffice to "train [people] to cherish th[ose] virtues which, . . . without re- ligious fables, make for individual happiness" (498;303), the second-order dismantling reveals those virtues to be just as aberrant as any religious belief. The rhetorical strategy that organizes this critique, and Saint-Ange's fable of freedom, becomes explicit later in "Francais, encore un effort" when Sade theorizes the structure of similitude or resemblance (simile or meta- phor) aimed at delegitimating the aberrant religious and human laws of prosopopeia and catachresis. Humans are born into, and hence like, nature. Nature levels. The time has come for error to disappear; that blindfold must fall along- side the heads of kings.... Doubtless, we are going to humiliate man's</page><page sequence="13">THOMAS KEENAN 243 pride by lowering him to the level of nature's other productions, but the philosopher hardly flatters small human vanities.... What is man, and what difference is there between him and other plants, between him and all the other animals of nature? None, certainly. Fortuitously placed, like them [comme eux], on this globe, he is born like them [comme eux]; he propagates, increases and decreases, like them [comme eux]; he arrives like them [comme eux] at old age and falls like them [comme eux] into nothingness after the term nature assigns each species of animal.... [525-26;329-30] Mutato nomine de te fabula narratur, as Horace expressed the law of fable. As when Mme. de Saint-Ange suggested that "the destiny of the woman is to be like the female dog or wolf [comme la chienne, comme la louve]"), here everything happens in the comme, the operator of the transition or the mutation between names. Like the real life fantasy of capital described by Marx in the first chapter of Capital, where the commodity form allows everything to be substituted for everything else, including people, nature treats all its creatures as the same: "to declare that all men are equal means that no creature is worth more than any other, all are interchangeable, "chacun n'a que la signification d'une unite dans un denombrement in- fini" [each has only a signification of a unit in an infinite enumeration] (LS, 33; C, 54-55). Everything, to the extent that it can be treated and manipu- lated as a mere sign, can be compared with everything else: comme eux. Nature is this principle of similarity, the third term that provides the axis of resemblance around which humans and "other plants" can be compared. "What becomes of the tree when you transplant it from a soil full of vigor to a dry and sandy plain? All intellectual ideas are so greatly subordinate to the physicality of nature that the comparisons furnished by agriculture will never deceive us in morals" (529;333). Figurative language raises no obstacle to interpretation here; similarity slides easily into identity at the her- meneutic level, naturally. Fable is this structure of analogy, of metaphor, of comparison, the horizon of generality within which species can relate them- selves as comme eux, like everything else (natural). Nature guarantees this resemblance or semblance; indeed, from the viewpoint of the "examining eye of the philosopher," the "rapprochements" between all the animals "are so exact that it becomes absolutely impossible ... to perceive any dis- semblance" (526;330). Thus fable is law, "law of nature" (525;329), "all individuals . . . being equal in the eyes of nature."'9 The appeal to nature made by this fable functions to remove the human from any position of privilege, in a gesture comparable to that of Nietzsche at the beginning of "Uber Wahrheit and Luge." Nature is not human-it comprehends, as the 19. Quoted without citation by Blanchot in "Quelques remarques sur Sade," Critique 3-4 (August-September 1946): 239-49, 243. Hereafter noted as QR.</page><page sequence="14">244 Yale French Studies whole to a part, the human without being reducible to it, the condition of possibility which cannot be comprehended by what it enables and which thus is entitled to give laws with authority and without prejudice. Com- pared to nature-and how could it not be?-humanity is itself but a prejudice. After the extinction of half the world, of its totality, if one wishes, ... would [anything surviving] feel the slightest material alteration? No, alas! All of nature would not feel it either, and the stupid pride of man, who believes everything made for him, would be astonished, after the total destruction of the human species, were it to be seen that nothing in nature had changed. [529;332-33] Nature is an example for us, as Saint-Ange told Eugenie, because it is so peculiarly inhuman, because it is a principle of likeness, of ineluctable comparison (comme eux), organizing the exchanges that articulate human- ity with the plants and animals and enable their laws to address us as well. Nature displaces humanity by replacing it with anything, by inscribing it in a system of generalized exchange which denies it any privilege, by subsum- ing its specificity within the generality of everything. Nature exceeds hu- manity as (comme) the general rules the particular. IV. THE LAW OF THE LAW It appears that these first two critiques have left a certain unquestionable residue called nature as the genuine state of things, as the source and end- point of our fables. This is perhaps Blanchot's strongest insight into Sade's writing: Nature is one of those words Sade . . . wrote most willingly. It is in the name of nature [au nom de la nature] that he waged his battle against God and against everything that God represents, especially morality.. . . For him, this nature is first of all universal life, and for hundreds of pages his whole philosophy consists in reiterating that immoral instincts are good, since they are facts of nature, and the first and last instance is nature. In other words, no morality: the fact reigns. [LS, 39-40; C, 62] And yet. Although this attraction toward nature and the law, toward the principle of general resemblance and hence of generality itself, never ceases in Sade, it is interrupted or troubled at times by a very different impulse. Ultimately, there is no last instance, no final appeal, least of all to the law. For while the rhetoric of similarity can always perform its critical function, and does so with the ruthless indifference of generality, it too falls victim to the still more relentless force of something that resists the substitutive and symmetrical exchanges of the trope.</page><page sequence="15">THOMAS KEENAN 245 Finally, the strength of that "in the name of" and the force of that analogy (everything can be substituted for everything else, all individuals are equal, we are all natural) are what draws the most furious wrath of the Sadeian character. What must be questioned is the stability of the axis of comparison itself, the frame that organizes the exchanges and grounds the law. ... always faced with this frame of reference [nature], Sade's man be- comes gradually annoyed, his anger mounts, and before long his hatred for nature [becomes . .. ] unbearable . . .: "yes, I loathe nature" [LS, 40;CJ, 62] Sade's strangest moments turn on this extra effort of loathing, finding in the so-called laws of nature only another fable, another rhetorical confusion dangerously seeking to relate the unrelated. Blanchot quotes Juliette's apos- trophe to nature, addressed as to a creature of fable: "'perhaps you deceive me, as in the past I was deceived by the infamous deific chimera to which you are, we are told, submissive; we are no more dependent on you than you on him; perhaps the causes are useless to the effects"' (LS, 41;CJ, 64). To be free means to be free of comparison. The laws of nature, then, insofar as they attempt the metonymic substitution of cause for effect or indeed any sub- stitution at all, are structured in the same confused and mistaken way as are the laws of gods or humans. The critical undoing of these errors in each case comes down to disengaging the pretended link between an abstract and a particular, between something general and something specific. This undo- ing is announced in the name of freedom, a freedom neither negative nor positive in that it depends on nothing (no obstacles to be overcome) and is ruled by nothing general (no law, not even one given by or read in the self). The comme that aimed to articulate everything within the synecdochal horizon of nature comes to be seen, with the eyes of a reader, as the enumera- tion of a stutter ("instead of analogy, we have enumeration, and an enumera- tion which never moves beyond the confines of a set of particulars" [de Man, "Anthropomorphism," 250]). Which is to say, there is nothing else to which to appeal, no frame or axis-nothing but the call "in the name of" . . . the name, in its singularity. One after the other, frames or names are tested- king, god, man, nature-and, as Blanchot argues, the test confers a certain value on them only in order that it may then in turn be resisted; "the experiment consists precisely in ruining them and nullifying them one after the other" (LS, 42/CL, 64). What is ruined in each case, in succession, is the claim to generalize, to exemplify, to draw (abstract) lessons from irreducibly singular events, . . . in a word, what is annihilated is the fable as the form of law. "Frangais, encore un effort" turns of course to fable to make the case, offering the lesson of the general and its particulars as the fable of the general and his soldiers:</page><page sequence="16">246 Yale French Studies it will be agreed [that] to want to prescribe universal laws would be a palpable absurdity; this proceeding would be as ridiculous as that of the army general who would have all of his soldiers dressed in a uniform made to the same measure [of the same size]; it is a terrible injustice to demand that men of dissimilar [inegaux] characters all be ruled by the same [egal] law: "ce qui va a Pun ne va point a 1autre" [what goes for one does not go at all for another] [504-05;310] What Sade, the philosopher or the text, revolts against, whether it assumes the figures of God, man, or even nature, is the law as such, the law of generality, universality, uniformity, measure.20 "To the extent that he is particular, any individual is, as individual, alienated from a law that, on the other hand, exists only in relation to his particular being" (de Man, AR, 267). At stake is the structuring difficulty of the fable and the law: the terrible address of the law, open, to no one and only one in particular. In de Man's words, "no law can ever be written unless one suspends any consideration of applicability to a particular entity; . . . on the other hand, no law is a law unless it applies to particular individuals" (AR, 269). This means that the revolt does not seek to overthrow one law in the name of another, to replace a harsh law with a lenient one, to humanize divine law or naturalize human law. Sade aims at the very law of the law,2' the possibility of articulating the general with the particular, the principle of relation or rapport itself that must be presumed by any law desiring to exceed the idiosyncratic or the private, which underlies as its condition of possibility any substitution (any example, any prosopopeia, any metonymy, any metaphor) with a common measure or trait.22 Sade simply removes that commonality, that relation, and with it the foundation of the law, the law's law, in all of its disfiguring violence. If "Sade puts himself so completely outside generality, places him- self so unconsciously far from the possibility of laws," then the only rule in the end (which is no rule and no end) must be: "Plus de lois, dit-il, presque pas de lois" (QR, 248). And if the emphasis in the example of the general and the soldiers was on a certain violence of uniformity, Sade understands it as a disfiguration superimposed on a 'prior' violence which begins by interpret- ing singularity as particularity in order to inscribe it as specificity within a system of generality. First, blinding, then a demand for visual distinctions: "Would the iniquity you would commit in this not be equal to that of which you would make yourself guilty if you wanted to force a blind man to dis- tinguish between colors?" (505;310). 20. See William Connolly, Political Theory and Modernity (Oxford and New York: Basil Blackwell, 1988), 77-78. 21.

Act as the animals do, leave, with rights and without debts; you are obligated or connected to nothing but yourself, and even that "self-"relation is questionable since independence is self-exceeding and self-abandonment, the erasure of the as. No recognition, no debt, no relation. The fable erodes its own condition of possibility here, irreversibly. If the violence (what Derrida calls somewhere the nonethical opening of ethics, a violent opening)23 can only be met with a certain violence, freedom requires that it occur without the destroyed object deriving the slightest value from this opera- tion. This principle has another advantage: it assigns man a future with- out imposing on him the recognition [reconnaissance] of any ideal no- tion. [LS, 42;CI, 65] Blanchot reads this principle of future alterity as a kind of negation without position, and hence without negation in the strict sense: as an affirmative negation which attempts to disable the dialectical motion in which nega- tion can be recuperated by the position it presupposes. It does so as the exercise of freedom. It is a "power which does not depend in any way on objects, which to destroy them does not even presuppose their anterior existence" (LS, 36; CJ, 58). Because of this freedom, this power without object is thus not the power of a subject, and certainly not of a subject which can enter into relations with other subjects, even to negate them-"Mais quel peut etre le rapport de ]'exception avec ]'exception?]," [what relation can there be between exceptions]? Blanchot asks (LS, 25; CJ, 46). And the struc- ture of the encore un effort deploys this relation without relation (even or especially to our "self") over time: we have a future, but it has nothing to do with and thus owes no recognition to any past. If there is an other, it occurs only to the extent that we are incapable of recognizing it. This is what Sade calls liberte, freedom, this nonsubjective openness in textual space and time, a radical singularity that allows for no stable identity but only itera- tion without relation.24 We are lacking only the freedom to consider this liberty (of absolute exceptionality without comparison, which is to say of the simple fact of difference), as anything but a matter of language. Language, like reading, proves difficult, though, because it works by relying on and erasing the difference between singularity and generality- between the name as sign and as call, between comme as "comparative simile" and as "enumerative repetition" (de Man, "Anthopomorphism," 249-50), between the individual as singular and as example-by enforcing a law of exceptions. That the singular claims its freedom as a law, that free- 23. See also Jacques Derrida, "Violence and Metaphysics," ED, 188; WD, 128, on "the irreducible violence of the relation to the other" which opens that relation. 24. "Iteration alters," writes Derrida in "Limited Inc," 40.</page><page sequence="18">248 Yale French Studies dom is the "entanglement"25 of no difference (equality) and no relation (exceptionality), that one fable undoes another (without opposing it from any other privileged ground)-this permanent predicament always de- mands another effort. Sade's strange rigor, his irony, is to entrust the task of teaching this lesson to fable: example of the singular, thus example of noth- ing, nothing but example. V. FABLE SPEAKS In other words, there is no evading the fable, the appeal to an elsewhere to which the last name given is that of nature. But that does not imply that this appeal could ever occur once and for all, that this last instance could last. The fable is the call that invents the place from which the imperative (the law) is uttered and robs it of any authority, submits it immediately to the law of its own undoing: yet another effort. Fable "itself has no ground and the ground that it is able to offer, by positing imperatives, for example, bears the mark of possible contingency, possible groundlessness, possible impos- sibility" (Hamacher, 188). The imperative, the law, finds its necessity in just this unreliability of ground: everything must be said, and again, because there is no guarantee that it can. Without justification, but not without fable.26 Which is why we never read just once: "Nous sortons de sa lec- ture, . . . nous reprenions la lecture" (Blanchot). Why must we leave off reading only to return to it? What is its difficulty such that it does not simply frustrate us but instead incites us, regardless of our desire for simplicity, for the simplicity we associate with our selves, necessarily to return to what is impossible for us? What would reading be if we could do it, if we could finally succeed, stop reading? This sortie, and its retraction, is no accident, but rather the very condition of reading, in its necessity and impossibility. "If it is still possible to read, then only in the aporia of undecidability articu- lated by literary texts themselves. In all writing and in all meaning is read the imperative: Sors de la lecture. Sors" (Hamacher, 179). 25. Blanchot: "The world of Sade is constituted by the entanglement of two systems: in one, beings are equal, each counts equally. But in the other . .. not only are individuals not equal, but the inequality is such that there are no relations [rapports], no reciprocity, possible among them" (QR, 244). 26. Oddly, this coincides with Luce Irigaray's call to "'Francaises,' ne faites plus un effort" (in Ce Sexe qui n'en est pas un (Paris: Minuit, 1977), 195-202; "'Frenchwomen,' Stop Trying," This Sex Which Is Not One, trans. Catherine Porter (Ithaca: Cornell Univer- sity Press, 1985), 198-204). No more effort means no more nature. "Don't even go looking for that alibi. Do what comes to you, what pleases you: without 'reason,' without 'valid motives,' without 'justification"' (202; 203). This doing without, without ground, is just what we mean by another effort (of reading, politics). We translate: plus d'effort.</page><page sequence="19">THOMAS KEENAN 249 The call to fable, then, is structured like the excessive call of naming Blanchot found so internally violent. In the name begins our responsibility. What calls for reading in these affirmations, these compulsive namings, that by their very movement make it so difficult? What allows it? (1) Nothing-it has no ground, no foundation or basis, no law other than what Hamacher calls "the law of the impossibility of identifying any epis- temological instance that could secure the meaning of language and even its very capacity to mean" (179). Naming makes reading possible only by with- drawing it, by paying the price of the imperative. (2) Everything- "N'avons-nous pas acquis le droit de tout dire?" [Have we not acquired the right to say everything?] asks "Francais, encore un effort' (525;329). Foucault evades the rigor of Sade's formulation when he translates "the exact object of 'sadism"' as "everything that could have been said [tout ce qui a pu etre dit]," because possibility does not restrict the scope of this everything-possible or not (not a question to be answered epistemologi- cally), an imperative is in force here. Blanchot: "Everything must be said [Il faut tout dire]" (IM, 20;MI, 50). Indeed, an imperative or a right is required, acquired, because the possibility of saying (everything) is just what cannot be taken for granted. If it were simply possible, rights would be unnecessary. Whether or not it can be, everything demands to be said, and it demands its rights and its freedoms. If Blanchot is correct- ... The "everything" at stake in this freedom to say everything is no longer only the universality of encyclopedic knowledge ... or even the totality of an experience in which meaning is achieved by the movement of a negation carried to term-a circular discourse which is thus the closed and completed affirmation of a mastery of everything. Sade's tout dire ... goes even farther. It is no longer everything possible that is given and expressed. Nor is it ... the whole set of values that a religion, a society, and a morality interdicts us from saying. [IM, 20; MI, 50-51127 -then to whom does this freedom and right belong, or to whom is the demand addressed? The right has nothing voluntary about it. A subject cannot choose to exercise this right, to say everything-nothing separates the right from a responsibility, an ineluctable or irrevocable call. Blanchot insists that this everything is nothing possible (not knowledge, not the experience of mastery, not even what is prohibited) but something else that he associates in Sade with the political: Everything must be said. The first freedom is the freedom to say every- thing. That is how he [Sade] translated the fundamental demand [exi- 27. Compare Foucault on the "pretention de tout dire," 49; 61.</page><page sequence="20">250 Yale French Studies gence]-in the form of a claim [revendication] that for him was hence- forth inseparable from a true republic. [IM, 19-20;MI, 50] The right and freedom to say everything is a political one because it is not necessarily possible; its possible impossibility makes it breach the limits of any subjectivity, opens the one that claims the right onto the impossibility of making the other, the others, and thus language, its own. To be free is to be responsible here, but this fundamental equation of all ethico-political meta- physics encounters the disruption of its subjectivist (whether liberal or communitarian) prejudice in the terrible double bind that constitutes the predicament of this responsibility: it may not be possible, separated as it is from any ground in knowledge or meaning, but that makes it necessary. Sade's effort, in its recurrence, to say everything and his claim that this is not merely a possibility or an essence but a right, and more exactly an "acquired" right (hence something ethico-political, the exercise of which constitutes an affirmation or an intervention), leaves his text and any read- ing of it open to a constant encounter with the condition of its possibility- language. This is a lesson in language as the open extent of saying, the freedom of all that must be said. Without knowing, without pathos. Which is not to say, without politics. For reading, like politics, if it is still possible, must be unavoidable, allowing no opting out nor requiring any commitment (in the sense of cognitive decidability and intention). Its irre- sistibility or necessity means that its freedom cannot simply be a matter of choice or decision, a willed relation of a subject to an exterior object, but an effort, and always another effort. "Frangais, encore un effort" teaches this effort of reading in its inevitable recurrence as politics. Politics and reading have their necessity in the withdrawal of security. These fields, because they expose us to events that cannot be calculated, programmed, "settled by experts or machines,"28 demand responses (in an- other vocabulary, decisions) that cannot be referred to anywhere else, to something we know or mean. Our freedom is defined by this responsibility, nor by that of a subject that knows what it does, which is why politics is not finally a matter of interpretation. We read, ethically and politically, when something (others, for example) demands a response we cannot give, at least not on the basis of anything we know or have under our control, but that we cannot avoid giving. If what we did could be authorized by something we knew (nature, truth), doing it would have nothing of the political or of read- ing about it. Unreadability only frustrates politics to the extent that politics is understood as something a subject does when it knows. Otherwise, it 28. Berlin, "Two Concepts," 118, distinguishing between the technical and the political.</page><page sequence="21">THOMAS KEENAN 251 offers a chance to think about a politics open to the future, to others, others "within" and without us. Indeed, the possible impossibility of reading makes politics-freedom and responsibility-ineluctable. In politics speaks the imperative of this exposure to all language: "Every- thing must be said [il faut tout dire]. The first of all freedoms is the freedom to say everything" (IM, 20).29 What Sade calls the "revolution" is built on this linguistic structure, which is why another effort is needed if we are to be republicans. The irony, as Blanchot insists, is that this revolution comes from nowhere else, has no privilege or guarantee of its own, but is just as fabulous as the state it would threaten. It is not enough to live in a republic to be a republican; . . . nor is having laws enough for that constituting act, that creative power, to persevere and maintain us in a state of permanent constitution. An effort must be made, and always another effort-there is the invisible irony.... Sade calls it insurrection, the permanent state of a republic [5 10;315]. In other words, the republic knows no state, but only a movement. [IM, 25-26;MI, 53] No state, no state of security, no standpoint or present in which knowledge and action might be coordinated. Rather, a permanent state of emergency. Thus the invisible irony of the title-invisible, which is to say, unrecogniza- ble to those who read only what is readable-the irony of the unending exigency of another effort, the law of another fable. Just as fable undoes fable in a structure that cannot finally be reduced to opposition or demystifica- tion (a cognitive, recognitive critique), so revolution and the law lock them- selves in a double bind whose temporal deployment is what we call his- tory.30 Politics aspires to this condition of revolution, and when it hap- pens-everyday and everynight?-"freedom aspires to be realized in the immediate form of everything is possible, everything can be done." A fabulous moment-and no one who has known it can completely recover from it, since he has known history as his own history and his own freedom as universal freedom. Fabulous moments, in fact: in them, fable speaks; in them, the speech of fable makes itself action. [LDM, 309;LRD, 39] Only a fable could teach this, if it could be taught. 29. Elsewhere Sade himself makes it imperative, and gives the task to philosophy: "A quelque point qu'en fremissent les hommes, la philosophie doit tout dire" (quoted IM, 51; MI 63). 30. See de Man: "revolution and legality by no means cancel each other out, since the text of the law is, per definition, in a condition of unpredictable change" (AR, 266-77).</page></plain_text>
