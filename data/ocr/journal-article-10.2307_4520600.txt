However, there are environmen- tal gains being made throughout the nation as legislation is passed to protect the purity of air, water, and soil. Addi- tionally, a growing number of farmers and consumers are choosing to raise/eat meat grown in a more environmen- tally friendly manner. This choice is as much based on taste as on a concern for nature. Finally,Johnsen places the responsibility for the future where it belongs-firmly on all citizens-saying, "Whether economic forces will over- whelm the concern for the air and water and the quality of life in rural communities is at least in part in the hands of people who eat pork and those whom they elect to do their will" (p. 147). Claire Strom Agricultural History North Dakota State University, Fargo TRUE GRIZ Glimpses of Fernie, Stahr, Easy, Dakota, and Other Real Bears in the Modern World Douglas H. Chadwick Sierra Club Books, San Francisco, 2003. Illustrations, map. 176 pp. $24.95 cloth. In his introduction Douglas Chadwick promises us that True Grizz is different from most collections of grizzly stories because it is not ultimately about people instead of bears, as grizzly tales tend to be. Rather, Chadwick's self- stated goal is to "sidestep the images that turn out to be reflections of our own complicated nature, and keep on looking from fresh angles until we finally just see real griz- zlies in the real world (p. 9). That is a tall ambition, and one generating terrific anticipation in any reader hungry for a fresh, innovative approach to bear stories. Unfortunately, the book fails to achieve this lofty goal, abandoning it almost from the start. Instead, Chadwick seems to want to explore the possibilities for developing a narrative style that expresses emotions and values relative to grizzlies and wilderness without compromising scientific validity. However, given the overall tenor of the book, this equally valuable goal ends up seeming like little more than an attempt tojustify Chadwick's admitted tendency toward romance and anthropomorphism. Written in the model of several recent books in which writers accompany search-and-rescue employees on the job, Chadwick's narrative allows the reader to tag along with Carrie Hunt of the Wind River Bear Institute and Tim Manley of Montana Department of Fish, Wildlife, and Parks as they use telemetry to track grizzlies around the Scenes of Visionary Enchantment Reflections on Lewis and Clark By Dayton Duncan More a revisiting than a retelling of the story of the Corps of Discovery, n Dayton Duncan s book reintroduces us to people and places along the trail, reflects on events large and small that occurred during the expedition, and offers constant- and constantly entertaining-insights into why, two centuries later, the saga of Lewis and Clark continues to exert such a powerful hold on our national imagination. $22 cloth number of mountain cabins inhabited by folks who either have refused to or are unaware of how to acclimate to living in grizzly country (e.g., don't store eighty pounds of dog food on your front porch). Chadwick succeeds in making clear the enormity of the human problem but spends far more time describing the efforts to "educate" bears through a variety of aversive con- ditioning techniques than detailing attempts to educate people-when it appears that trying to teach humans not to leave bear attractants lying around is probably far more effective than trying to convince bears not to eat them. He also fails to seriously address the habitat encroachment issues that create the kinds of problems he describes. Chadwick may have chosen to focus on the "bear educa- tion" part of the story in order to stay true to his goal of telling bears' tales, but in the process the bears themselves end up being differentiated largely by their degrees of incorrigibility and whether or not they survived to den and then resume their familiar habits the following season. The book also gets a little plodding and may be more depress- ing than it needs to be; it would be interesting to know the success ratio of reeducated bears versus reeducated people in this area. True Grizz would be a good book for those who, like Chadwick, are "unrepentant grizz groupies" (his descrip- 93</page><page sequence="2">MONTANA THE MAGAZINE OF WESTERN HISTORY tion) and those interested in knowing more about how aversive conditioning techniques are employed, but its relentless anthropomorphism will make it hard to stomach for the scientific set.

Aside from a few investigations of the region's natural his- tory and the interrelationships between bison and Indians, eastern Montana and the northern plains have received little attention from environmental historians. Robert Kelley Schneiders attempts to fill that gap in Big Sky Rivers, arguing that the upper Missouri and Yellowstone Rivers were, and to a lesser extent still are, "the center of a tremen- Relive the Journey of Lewis &amp; Clark Wi Grab a V11,1d1&amp; travel the waters that Lewis &amp; Clark paddled nearly 200 years ago.

Linked by hydrology, ecology, history, and geography, the two rivers are the lifeblood of the area. According to Schneiders, Indians lived sustain- ably within the region while Euramericans have altered the ecological balance of the region through the elimination of the bison, dam building, and cattle grazing. While Schneiders provokes readers to think about the management of this vast area, his story has many short- comings. Throughout the book he fails to provide ade- quate citations for his material and seems to substitute conjecture for fact. For example, half of chapter 8 is about Montana reclamationists' attempts to impound rivers in Yellowstone National Park, but Schneiders provides only two sources for this story. Likewise, other parts of his book rely on early explorers' accounts that, while they may be all he has to work with, provide scanty evidence for such broad-brush claims as the subject of conversation in Indian villages (p. ioo) or that bison are responsible (at least in part) for the flatness of the Great Plains (p. 78). Schneiders's story also suffers from some startling historiographical and historical omissions. For example, in concluding that we should return bison to the northern plains, Schneiders fails to mention that Frank and Deborah Popper have risked their careers promoting the same idea. Likewise, Schneiders believes that male machismo was responsible for the elimination of the bison from the plains. Kenneth L.
