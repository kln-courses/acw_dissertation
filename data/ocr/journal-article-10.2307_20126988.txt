<plain_text><page sequence="1">IDEALISM AND MATERIALISM IN MARX'S DIALECTIC LOUIS DUPR? I 11 o aspect of Marx's theory has received more attention in recent decades than the dialectical method. Yet, Western interpreters have mainly restricted the discussion to those early writings in which Marx explicitly confronts Hegel's philosophy, while socialist commentators often hesitate to subject Marx's mature writings to funda mental questioning. In the present contribution I propose to raise a number of questions concerning the dialectical method as used in Marx's later works and as interpreted in those of his principal followers. I realize that there may be a substantial difference between the two, yet since the latter, correctly or incorrectly, explicate a text which frequently demands further justification, they must be consulted. My purpose with this task is hermeneutical rather than critical. I feel that, despite the existing bulk of Marxist literature, we still have not read Marx attentively enough to be ready for a decisive critique of his work. My own critical remarks pretend to do no more than to allow the text to reveal its own mean ing within its total context. They are part of that internal criticism without which there can be no true hermeneutic. Up to German Ideology, Marx's dialectic had been predom inantly anthropological. Even when he discussed economic ques tions, as in the Manuscripts of 1844, he did so from an anthro pological angle. In the writings immediately preceding Capital the anthropological model ceases to determine the critique of economy altogether. The dialectic now follows an intrinsically economic pat tern. Its contradictions result from internal conflicts within the economic process, not from its opposition to any preconceived ideal "nature" of man. This is not to say that Marx's philosophical concerns vanished when Marx started writing his definitive critique of classical economy. Capital is a "philosophical" text as well as a critique of economic theory, though the latter is far more in evidence than the former. The rediscovery of the preparatory notes for Capital, the Grundrisse,</page><page sequence="2">650 LOUIS DUPR? clearly indicates the continuing role of philosophy in Marx's work. Yet the Grundrisse integrates a dialectical philosophy with an eco nomic theory, which in the early writings had remained largely juxta posed.1 In The Poverty of Philosophy (1846) Marx had adumbrated his own concept of the dialectical development of economic categories while attacking Proudhon's. Especially, the emerging notion of eco nomic contradiction deserves attention. Previously, the dialectical negation had consisted in the opposition between prevailing social economic conditions and an ideal, anthropological model. But now, Marx envisions the economic process as producing its own contradic tions and surpassing them in new economic relations. Such a dialectic of economic development differs substantially from Proudhon's "Hegelian" theory. Proudhon separates the dialectic of economic categories from their historical development. Instead of studying the actual, historical production relations from which economic cate gories derive, Proudhon deals in "immutable laws, eternal principles, ideal categories." Even Hegel's Absolute Spirit reappears in the secular form of "humanity," decked out as "general reason" or "social genius."2 In heaping sarcasm on Proudhon, Marx is really settling accounts with his own past, though he had formulated his abstract universals in anthropological rather than economic terms. But only in the Grundrisse3 does Marx fully integrate the dialectical method within his economic studies. Marx explicitly warns against any simplistically Hegelian interpretation of economic categories, that moves, in Proudhon's manner, from the abstract universal to the complex concrete.4 Even basic, universal categories 1 David McLellan, Karl Marx: His Life and Thought (New York: Harper, 1973), p. 296. 2 The Poverty of Philosophy (Moscow: Foreign Languages Publishing House, s.d.) p. 112. 3 Grundrisse der Kritik der politischen Oekonomie (Berlin: Dietz, 1953); The Grundrisse, trans, by David McLellan (New York: Harper and Row, 1971). McLellan's translation is only a partial one, yet I have followed it wherever possible because it renders the enormously com plex style of Marx's private notes somewhat more readable than Martin Nicolaus' literal one (Baltimore: Pelican Books, 1973). I refer to the former as "McL," to the latter as "Nicolaus," and to the German edition as "Gr." 4 "Hegel fell into the error of considering the real (das Reale) as the result of self-coordinating, self-absorbed,and spontaneously operating thought, while the method of advancing from the abstract to the concrete is but the way of thinking (die Art f?r das Denken) by which the concrete is grasped and is reproduced in our mind as concrete" (Gr. 22, McL 35).</page><page sequence="3">MARX'S DIALECTIC 651 such as production, labor, and agriculture can never be considered sepa rately: they are codetermined by a number of other factors and can be fully understood only within the complex economic setting of the existing production relations. Man is social, and therefore complex, from the beginning (Gr. 6, McL, 17). The meaning of terms such as "produc tion" or "population" depends on specific social structures and changes with the development of the social-economic process. "Whenever we speak therefore of production, we always have in mind production at a certain stage of social development, a produc tion by social individuals" (Gr. 6, McL, 18). Moreover, it is from the beginning determined by distribution, exchange, and consumption. All the stages of production have certain destinations in common, which we generalize in thought; but the so-called general conditions of all production are nothing but abstract conceptions which do not go to make up any real stage in the history of production (Gr. 10, McL, 21-22). The term "production," then, can be used only in an analogous way for purposes of comparing similar (but never identical) functions in the social-economic process. The same ambiguity adheres to the seemingly univocal concept of "population." It remains economically meaningless until specified into the concrete classes of which it consists, and the composition of these classes is determined by such varying historical factors as divi sion of labor, modes of production, and, at a certain stage, capital, wage labor, money, etc. (Gr. 21, McL, 34). Labor presents even greater complexities. For in its universal form, that is, as a means of creating wealth in general without being specified to any par ticular form, it appears only at the end of a long, historical process in the economy of advanced industrial societies. Unlike Proudhon's abstract uni versais, Marx's concrete uni versal emerge at the end of the dialectic. Yet Marx's method is more fundamentally Hegelian insofar as he intrinsically connects the various aspects of the economic process with one another and overcomes the classical separation of its stages. Production already contains consumption, and distribution itself is a form of producing (Gr. 11, McL, 23-24).5 This interrelatedness of all economic cate 5 Nor should this interconnection of production, distribution, and ex change be interpreted in a formalists "Hegelian" way, as if production universally appropriated the products of nature while distribution deter mined which particular group were to partake of those products and con sumption constituted the individual enjoyment (Gr. 11, McL, 22).</page><page sequence="4">652 LOUIS DUPR? gories marks a clear innovation in economic thinking made under the direct impact of Hegel's philosophy. In his review of Marx's Critique of Political Economy, Engels describes the difference: Political economy begins with commodities, begins from the moment when products are exchanged for one another?whether by individuals or by primitive communities. In exchange a product becomes a com modity, however, a commodity solely because a relation between two persons or communities attaches to the thing, the product, the relation between producer and consumer who are here no longer united in the same person.6 Marx uses no "simple" concepts, only conceptualized relations. Each term must ever anew be defined in accordance with the complex web of relations in which it appears.7 Though the point is of primary importance, we must postpone further discussion of it until we have acquainted ourselves with the most general principles which Marx borrowed from Hegel's dialectic: the developing character of reality and the dynamic nature of con tradiction. The internal relatedness of the categories can be fairly evaluated only in the light of those two more comprehensive prin ciples which entail it. We find them most clearly articulated in Capital. II The assumption of a permanent, internal development distin guishes Marx's discussion of economic concepts from that of the classi cal economists.8 To Marx the capitalist system is not the necessary 6 Review anonymously published in Das Volk on August 20, 1859. Karl Marx-Friedrich Engels, Selected Works (Moscow: International Pub lishers, 1962), Vol. I, p. 374. 7 Bertell Oilman has made this interrelatedness the central theme of his study Alienation: Marx's Conception of Man in Capitalist Society (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1971). 8 That reality is essentially a dynamic process, is a principle which Marx had adopted from Hegel at an early age. In the Manuscripts o? 1844 appears the oft-quoted passage: "The outstanding thing in Hegel's Phenomenology and its final outcome?that is, the dialectic of negativity as the moving and generating principle?is thus first that Hegel conceives the self-genesis of man as a process ..." (Economic and Philosophic Manuscripts of 18Jib, trans, by Martin Milligan [Moscow: International Publishers, 1959], p. 151). This text, of course, considers only man as a process being. But Marx regarded, and ever more so, man as the moving principle of all reality.</page><page sequence="5">MARX'S DIALECTIC 653 product of common sense and Western inventiveness, but the out come of specific historical factors, subject to historical metamorphoses and constantly passing through distinct but interconnected cycles of production, circulation, sales, and reinvestment. It negates a pre vious system of production and will, in time, be supplanted by a new system that synthesizes the two preceding ones. Most of Capital I and all of the preparatory Theories of Surplus Values (post humously published by Karl Kautsky as Capital TV) deal with the intrinsically historical, and therefore relative, character of economic concepts. In Capital III, Marx defines capital as "a definite social production relation, belonging to a definite historical formation of society" (Capital III, 814),9 and he describes capitalist production as "by no means an absolute form for the development of the pro ductive forces and for the creation of wealth" (Capital III, 263-264). Nowhere is the relative quality of economic concepts more evi dent than in Marx's discussion o? value. Even this most basic con cept intrinsically depends on a particular, historical mode of pro duction. The utility of a product becomes a value only within a system of social exchange which allows it to detach itself from use and to adopt an economic significance independent of the specific nature of the product. All that these things now tell us is that human labor power has been expended in their production, that human labor is embodied in them. When looked at as crystals of this social substance, common to them all, they are?values (Capital I, 38). Though such a claim may hardly seem to go beyond the fundamental principles of classical economy, it constitutes, in fact, a revolutionary innovation. For Marx presents value itself as resulting from a par ticular mode of production. Value is the most universal economic category only within the capitalist economic system. The same system which reduces all products to "mere congela tions of undifferentiated human labor" (Capital I, 67), renders the value-producing activity into an abstract, strictly capitalist mode of producing. The term "labor," according to Marx, applies exclusively to the specific productive activity of a value-and-exchange system 9 AU references from Capital are to the editions published by Inter national Publishers, 1967. The first volume was translated by Samuel Moore and Edward Aveling. The translations of the last two are anonymous.</page><page sequence="6">654 LOUIS DUPR? that is at least relatively independent of use. Indeed, it is precisely labor which allows the production of use value to be converted into one of exchange value. From this arises its peculiar ambiguity. Labor is on the one hand positively, qualitatively to be understood as production of use values (goods), in the final analysis pure anthro pological praxis; on the other hand it is negatively the 'substance' of what is not useful, the substance of exchange value, of quantitative labor time.10 At an advanced stage of this process, labor itself, the foundation of the exchange process, becomes an exchange value, a commodity that can be bought and sold. Owing to its abstract nature, value can be measured in quanti ties of an arbitrarily chosen and arbitrarily valued metal. Money is the concrete expression of abstract value. With it comes price, "the money name of the labor realized in a commodity" (Capital I, 101), which allows any commodity to be exchanged for any other commodity. However, since this concrete expression of value as such is itself a commodity and possesses a value of its own, money in a capitalist economy is far more than a mere means of exchange. Its principal function consists not in the acquisition of goods, but in the expansion of capital. Its real purpose is selling rather than buying. Most importantly, it allows the economic process to sever all direct connections with use; the price represents abstract value produced through abstract labor. All that counts is the process of value. In the circulation m(oney)?c(ommodity)?m(oney) both the money and the commodity represent only different modes of existence of value itself, the money its general mode, and the commodity its par ticular or, so to say, disguised mode. It is constantly changing from one form to the other without thereby becoming lost, and thus assumes an automatically active character (Capital I, 153). Value, the real agent, becomes value in process through the circula tion of capital. Capital depends on the presence of specific historical conditions. Though classical economists were well aware of that fact, Marx criti cizes them for simply assuming that those conditions "naturally" emerge. Thus Ricardo, who knew the concept of surplus value, never concerned himself with the conditions of its origin. "He treats it as a thing inherent in the capitalist mode of production, which mode, 10 Klaus Hartmann, Die Marxsche Theorie (Berlin: Walter de Gruyter, 1970), p. 268.</page><page sequence="7">MARX'S DIALECTIC 655 in his eyes, is the natural form of social production" (Capital I, 515). According to Marx, the very existence of those conditions must be investigated. They may have been historically inevitable but were by no means "natural" or intrinsically necessary, since they resulted from a specific mode of producing, not from production as such. Capital is but the final outcome of a long line of historical developments. It cannot be understood without an examination of all its preceding conditions. Ignoring the history of economic cate gories results in inaccurate interpretations. Thus, classical econ omists define the value of labor as the price it takes to produce and maintain the labor power. But such an intrinsically capitalist equation, Marx claims, aside from confusing value and price, identi fies labor with its producer. In the expression Value of labor,' the idea of value is not only com pletely obliterated, but actually reversed, It is an expression as imagi nary as the value of the earth. These imaginary expressions arise, however, from the relations of production themselves. They are cate gories for the phenomenal forms of essential relations. That in then appearance things often represent themselves in inverted order is pretty well known in every science except political economy (Capital I, 537). In classical economy, labor value is simply defined by the current capitalist practice of determining its price by the maintainance cost of the laborer. "What economists therefore call value of labor, is in fact the value of labor power, as it exists in the personality of the laborer, which is as different from its function, labor, as a machine is from the work it performs" (Capital I, 538). Nowhere does the historical-dialectical character of Marx's con cepts appear more clearly than in his most original contribution? the theory of surplus value. Marx presents the labor process which yields surplus value from two different points of view. At the be ginning of Capital III, he describes the process of productive work in its essential nature. Far from being the only possible realization, capitalist labor almost directly negates this essence. Labor is, in the first place, a process in which both man and nature participate, and in which man of his own accord starts, regulates, and controls the material reaction between himself and Nature. He opposes himself to Nature as one of her own forces, setting in motion arms and legs, head and hands, the natural forces of his body, in order to appropriate Nature's productions in a form adapted to his own wants. By thus acting on the external world and changing it, he at the same time changes his own nature. He develops his slum</page><page sequence="8">656 LOUIS DUPR? bering powers and compels them to act in obedience to his sway. (Capital I, 177)11 What Marx describes here as the essence of productive work corre sponds entirely to the anthropological view, articulated in the Paris manuscripts, of an active, dialectical relation between man and nature. The emphasis rests on human initiative: man starts "of his own accord," "regulates," "controls." The other description presents the labor process as it takes place within the capitalist production. Here a very different picture emerges. Although the ability to buy and sell labor presupposes a "personal" independence which neither the slave nor the serf pos sesses, a capitalist economy leaves the laborer no real freedom to sell or to withhold his labor power. The second essential condition ... of finding labor power in the market as a commodity is this?that the laborer instead of being in the position to sell commodities in which his labor is incorporated, must be obliged to offer for sale as a commodity that very labor power, which exists only in his living self. (Capital I, 168-169) All concepts of capitalist economy, labor, value, price, capital, are determined by its principal goal, the creation of surplus value. Sur plus value alone determines what makes the capitalist economy move ?profit. But the only source of value is labor, and to yield profit the created value must exceed the amount returned in labor wages. Clearly such a surplus can be achieved only in an economic situation where the producer, no longer able to support himself independently or to contribute the material conditions for the production (place, machinery, distribution), has surrendered control over his labor and its product. The resulting mode of producing admits no other goal than the creation of surplus value. Our capitalist has two objects in view: in the first place, he wants to produce a use-value that has a value in exchange, that is to say, an article destined to be sold, a commodity; and secondly, he desires to produce a commodity whose value shall be greater than the sum of the values of the commodities used in its production, that is, of the means of production and the labor-power, that he purchased with his good money in the open market. His aim is to produce not only a use-value, but a commodity also; not only use-value but value; not only value, but at the same time surplus-value. (Capital I, 186) 11 Exceptionally, Marx here does not use the term "labor" in the restrictive sense of the productive activity exclusive to the capitalist sys tem, but of productive activity in general.</page><page sequence="9">MARX'S DIALECTIC 657 In the process capital expands, and it expands through an increase of the sole producer of value?labor (Capital I, 208-210). I prefer not to enter into Marx's controversial thesis that labor is the exclusive source of value increase and that means of production never yield more value than they lose through operating expenses and amortization (Capital I, 204). Here I am concerned only with his relativization of established economic concepts. Value, price, labor, all have become constitutive factors of the productive process at a particular stage of its development. To Marx the cur rent stage stands in a negative relationship to earlier ones: it is opposed to what productive work "essentially" is and historically was, namely, the "necessary condition for effecting exchange of matter between man and Nature" (Capital I, 183-184) through which man "develops his slumbering powers" (Capital I, 177). Ill This leads us to a second aspect of Marx's dialectic: the con tradiction. Development and interconnectedness alone do not con stitute dialectical necessity. In addition a contradictory opposition between the dynamically connected moments is required. Unfor tunately Marx himself provides little help toward understanding the nature of the dialectical contradiction as he conceived it. In the Postface to the second edition of Capital I, he refers to a Russian review of his book and then proceeds to explain what he under stands by a dialectical development, that is, a process whereby contradictions are necessarily generated and overcome. Such an inquiry will confine itself to the confrontation and the comparison of a fact, not with ideas, but with another fact. For this inquiry, the one thing of moment is, that both facts be investigated as accurately as possible, and that they actually form, each with respect to the other, different moments of an evolution, but most important of all is the rigid analysis of the series of successions, of the sequences and concatenations in which the different stages of such an evolution present themselves. (Capital I, 18) Yet a dialectic which consists entirely in a succession of contingent but mutually exclusive "facts" lacks the inevitability which enables it to predict the outcome of history. In contrast to bourgeois econo mists, Marx's analysis of the current economic system includes, he insists, "the recognition of the negation ofthat state, of its inevitable breaking up" (Capital I, 20). In treating the economic process as</page><page sequence="10">658 LOUIS DUPR? a dialectical development Marx does far more than empirically de scribe it; he intendes to expose the necessary inception and inevitable demise of historical systems of production because of their inherent (not contingent) contradictions. What, then, provides the dialectic with the additional element that directs the development of history and leads the contradictions to a predictable, positive future? Marx himself, Engels, and Lenin, all refer to Hegel's Logic. But clearly the dialectic of Capital lacks the moving agent of Hegel's philosophy, a Spirit which by intrinsic necessity negates itself and, then, by the same necessity overcomes this negation in a new affirmation. What substitutes for the Spirit in providing the inner necessity which alone could grant total pre dictability, especially predictability of a non-contradictory future? Various answers have been given to this question.12 One recent critic of Marx's method claims to detect underneath the actual, eco nomic contradictions an anthropological theory from which alone the dialectical movement obtains its direction. Klaus Hartmann regards the so-called contradictions of capitalist society truly antithetic (i.e., dialectically negating) only to an ever assumed but never fully ad mitted anthropological "thesis." Political economy is negative and "contradictory" only because it is negatively related to a positive vision of man. Without this vision there would be no true negativity at all and, consequently, no genuine dialectic. But since Marx does not grant any active function to the anthropological factor in his di alectic, Hartmann wonders what unifies the variety of tensions and oppositions ("contradictions") into a meaningful, predictable develop ment. Marx continues to invoke Hegel's name, but, his critics charge, he invokes it in vain. Marx intends to present an intuitively concrete explanation of the social process, supporting his argument by a mirror type relation to Hegel's philosophy. But what he achieves is a concept of reality, a description, a representation. Such an approach does not enable him to explain the process, especially in its negative development, since all reality, all practice is positive. To be sure, in a particular instance one may compare a form of society to the anthropological model of species life and criticize it by that norm. But one has thereby not succeeded in explaining the negative.13 12 Long ago Rudolf Stammler located the presence of a teleological element in the conscious decisions which entering into social relations in evitably requires. Wirtschaft und Recht, 2nd edition (Leipzig, 1896), p. 421. Marxists consider the separation of conscious aspirations and eco nomic necessity a "Kantian" error and prefer to concentrate on the second. 13 Klaus Hartmann, Die Marxsche Theorie, p. 226.</page><page sequence="11">MARX'S DIALECTIC 659 For a dialectical negation it is not sufficient to criticize economic realities by anthropological ideas, even if this critique is presented in the form of inner tensions ("contradictions"). To oppose an his torical-economic analysis to an assumed anthropological model, is to pit against each other two different orders of reality. Such an oppo sition does not constitute a dialectical negation. In the description of labor of Capital I, 177 (quoted earlier), the assumed anthro pological model surfaces when Marx defines work as man's self realization through the control of nature. But is such an anthro pological "thesis" truly antithetical to the present mode of produc tion? What precisely does "human work" as opposed to capitalist "labor" mean on the economic level on which the dialectic is alleged to take place? It is easy to see how the emancipation of exchange value from use could constitute a threat to human development and even how it is opposed to the original goals of production. But it is difficult to conceive of such an emancipation as an economic contradiction. In fact, it is hard to imagine how it could have been avoided altogether and even harder to project a developed economic system which would exclude it in principle. Are Marx's "contradic tions" more than economic tensions and conflicts which become "con tradictory" only if one views them as manifesting the fundamental discrepancy between the current social-economic situation and an ideal of man? This question seems to have determined much recent interpretation of Marx's work. Two opposite positions have emerged. One radicalizes the anthropological element in Marx's dialectic. Those who have adopted it realize, of course, that little anthropology appears in Marx's critique of economic theories. Nevertheless, what determines this critique, they insist, is an idea of man, clearly formulated in Marx's early writings and never retracted. They ascribe the more "naturalist" interpretation of Marx's theory to Engels and his heavy-handed successors. Marx's own view remained humanistic to the end. In choosing an anthropological approach those interpreters avail themselves of the possibility of establishing an original Marxist dialectic (the dialectic of freedom) instead of having to borrow secretly from a repudiated Hegelian philosophy of Spirit. The most important study to come out of this interpretation is Sartre's Critique de la raison dialectique. The other position simply denies that dialectical necessity and development require an overall "thesis," least of all an anthropological one. Economic contradictions alone suffice to bring the process of history to the predicted overcoming of the capitalist</page><page sequence="12">660 LOUIS DUPR? system. Other factors undoubtedly play a role in this process, but they ultimately depend on the economic ones. Those who have chosen this approach concede that anthropological considerations occa sionally appear in Marx's mature work, but they deny that they play a role in the dialectic as such. Among them we find all "official" representatives of Marxist societies today, including the communist parties of the West, as well as a number of Marx's critics. Though Marxists such as Lukacs, Gramsci, and, to some extent, Korsch, had already stressed the presence of anthropological ele ments in Marx's theory, the radically anthropological interpretation originated in French existentialist circles after the war. It was pre pared by Alexandre Koj?ve's seminar on Hegel's Phenomenology. By highlighting certain passages in the Phenomenology and detaching this work from the totality of Hegel's System, Koj?ve laid, in fact, the foundation for a wholly new dialectical philosophy, one which would dispense with such idealist notions as Absolute Spirit and Idea, and concentrate exclusively on the development of human free dom. This position, Koj?ve and his followers felt, basically coin cided with Marx's original one. Their approach has been mainly responsible for the post-war success of Marx's early writings and the relative neglect of his mature ones. If this interpretation could be proven to be authentic, a number of problems would vanish at once. On the basis of Hegel's Master-and-slave passage, existentialist Marxists conclude that freedom can be achieved only through self negation. In his unrestricted pursuit of freedom the master stakes his life in order to gain full self-consciousness. Yet his self-denial is limited to a one-act move. After this victory no further sacrifice is required and he ends up depending on a slave to have his desires fulfilled. Only with the slave does the real dialectic of freedom begin. For him also the road to freedom leads through self-denial. While cowardice deprived him of an instant access to full self-conscious ness, his consequent daily self-negating labor proved in the end to be a safer path toward the achievement of genuine freedom. For by persistently overcoming the resistance of a material world, the slave gradually subjugates the entire cosmos and thus gains the kind of objective and lasting recognition which the master never received. The process from denial to freedom continues in subsequent stages of self-consciousness which Hegel describes as the negative self-suf ficiency of Stoic freedom, the unworldliness of the unhappy conscious</page><page sequence="13">MARX'S DIALECTIC 661 ness, the denial of monastic life, the detachment of the creative mind from its achievements and, most importantly, the alienation of the objective mind from its self-created culture. Marx may not have agreed with most of this analysis; in the Paris Manuscripts he repudiates Hegel's alleged identification of alienation and objectification. But, his existentialist interpreters claim, he never questioned the main thesis that man creates himself in a process of self-negation. Searching for a dialectical necessity which they do not find in Marx's own writings they developed his brief allusion to the Master-and-slave passage at the end of the Paris Manuscripts into a full-fledged dialectical theory. I find this interpretation inadequate for a number of reasons, but mainly because the dialectic of freedom is insufficient to provide the development of the capitalist system with the kind of necessity which Marx's theory requires. What Koj?ve and his followers proposed may help to solve the problems of Marx's early writings. But it provides no help in understanding Capital. For the conflicts resulting from the capitalist system are precisely not the ones of freedom. As Marx presents them, they are created not by decisions and attitudes, but by objec tive modes of production and social structures. It may still be true that the "contradictions" of Capital derive their dialectical quality from an unstated anthropological "thesis," but there can be no doubt that Marx studiously avoided basing his argument on anthropological concepts. Consequently, any anthropological interpretation of his dialectic deviates from Marx's clearly stated intentions. Certainly he regarded the capitalist mode of production incongruous with the demands of human nature. But he did not want his dialectic to depend on this opposition. No anthropological or philosophical thesis initiates the social-economic process, because any general concept such as "human nature," "human work," is itself already the result of a preceding social-economic development and must therefore be regarded as "ideological," i.e., secondary with respect to the process of production. It is a basic principle of hermeneutics not to neglect an author's own interpretation of his work until one has tried it and found it wanting. Now, according to Marx, contradictions which already exist within the economic process itself, not some precon ceived idea of human nature, constitute the inner dialectic of the system and will cause its collapse. Economics as a science turns into a critique of economy, since an analysis of the present mode of production cannot fail to expose its multiple contradictions. Di</page><page sequence="14">662 LOUIS DUPR? alectical contradictions, then, are self-contradictions of the social economic system. IV Whether Marx succeeded in keeping his dialectic within the economic system is a question which we may be able to answer at the end. That it was his intention to keep it within those limits is beyond doubt. We must then first study the con tradiction on his own terms. Capital III defines the contradiction of the capitalist system as a whole. The contradiction of the capitalist mode of production . . . lies precisely in its tendency towards an absolute development of the pro ductive forces which continually come into conflict with the specific conditions of production in which capital moves and alone can move. (Capital III, 257) These specific conditions, he has told us a few pages earlier, are the ones that foster and expand the surplus value of the existing capital. Yet as production increases, profit rates decline. The entire development of capitalist economy is determined by the attempt to overcome this built-in handicap. The general "contradiction" of the capitalist system manifests itself in a number of specific conflicts, starting with the first and most fundamental category of value. No economic value can be realized without use value. Yet economic value tends more and more to suppress the use value on which it depends. Because of the partial identity of the two "values" their opposition becomes a dialectical contradiction: . . . the two sides which tend to isolate themselves from each other, are nevertheless intrinsically linked and cannot exist independently. If the opposites were not related or indifferent to each other, no struggle would take place. Thus if a producer could produce even one single unit of value without use, all the difficulties and contradictions of production and exchange would vanish.14 The same contradiction reappears in the opposition between concrete labor (resulting in use value) and abstract labor (producing value). In the process of exchanging one usable object with another, abstract labor tends to suppress concrete labor on which it nevertheless depends. 14 M. Rosenthal, Les probl?mes de la dialectique dans Le Capital de Marx (Moscow: Langues ?trang?res, 1959), p. 174. This claim is based upon Marx's own exposition in Theories of Surplus Value, trans. Jack Cohen and S. W. Rayazanskaya (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1971), esp. I, 152-304 and III, 453-540.</page><page sequence="15">MARX'S DIALECTIC 663 Together value and labor lead to the contradiction of money. Value asserts its independent existence in money. Originally a mere means of circulation, money gradually turns into the real end of the circulating commodities. It brings to a close the simple form of exchange (commodity-money-commodity) and initiates the complex one (money-commodity-money) in which exchange value becomes the only goal of production. Money enables the producer to retain surplus value and to add it to his original capital. Thus, what began as a means of circulation has turned into the main instrument for accumulating value. This accumulation allows capital to concentrate, mechanize, and thereby expand the process of production. Yet, in the end, expansion will become capital's undoing. As production increases, capital must compensate for the declining profit rate. By lowering wages and lengthening working time it extracts an ever greater amount of surplus value from the worker. This creates a conflict between an increased production and a decreased buying power that eventually results in a succession of economic crises. In them all the contradictions between use and value, between ab stract and concrete labor, between commodity and money come to more and more explosive confrontations. Marx describes this development in Capital III.15 Has this initial survey taught us what Marx understands pre cisely by "contradiction?" Hardly. In his critical study On the Dialectical Method (1868), Eduard von Hartmann attacked Hegel for presenting as contradictions what was in fact not at all con tradictory in the commonly accepted sense of mutually exclusive at the same time in the same respect. Nor are Hegel's contradictions "contraries," for they do exist in the same subject. Marx's usage of the term suffers from the same ambiguities and some additional ones. Its meaning varies from logical inconsistency to practical incompati bility to social conflict.16 The contradiction between use and exchange 15 Marx mentions a number of other "contradictions," such as the machine designed to shorten working time and to free the worker leading in fact to an unprecedentedly long working day and chaining the worker to one restricted task at one machine. 16 The ambiguity has grown worse among Marx's contemporary fol lowers. One student of Soviet logic concludes in exasperation: "There are so many different notions of contradiction that one does not know where to begin. For some, contradiction is little more than the antagonism of vectors the effect of which are mutually exclusive. For others, contradiction is almost the same as the constitutive relation in the Hegelian sense. Between these two extremes there is place for almost anything" (Guy Planty Bonjour, The Categories of Dialectical Materialism, trans. J. J. Blakeley [New York: Frederick A. Praeger, 1967], p. 105).</page><page sequence="16">664 LOUIS DUPR? value refers to the capitalist trend to make exchange into the eco nomic value, while use continues to provide the basis of exchange. But is this tendency to transform a production process originally designed for the creation of use value a contradiction? Is a shift from concrete to abstract labor contradictory? Does money become contradictory when from a means of circulation it turns into the determining factor of the exchange process? The inverted relation between profit rate and surplus labor value intrigued Ricardo, but he never thought of it as a contradiction. Other contradictions are economic tensions which may lead to social crises, such as the in creasing productivity of industrial capitalism and an inevitable (in Marx's theory!) decline in buying power.17 The only reason for attaching such a variety of meanings to the same term is that Marx regarded them all as creating conflicts which would eventually lead to the final crisis of capitalism. Any tension that is expected to accelerate the final conflict is termed contradictory. To understand the full meaning one must read the story backward, so to speak, from the anticipated final crisis to the tensions whose cumulative effect will bring it about. Only from the perspective of history as the preparation for an apocalyptic class war can we regard those tensions and conflicts as "contradictory" (i.e., explosive). Such a perspective may not be unreasonable, but neither is it scien tifically "necessary," as Marx and Engels thought. Even if the social economic tensions were proven to destroy the system in which they appear, they would still provide no information about its successor except that it would not contain the same contradictions to the same degree. Without accepting an overall, ideal structure of reality which with logical necessity directs the oppositions towards an ideal telos, one has no compelling reason for regarding them as dialectical, that is, as moments of an intrinsically meaningful and necessary develop ment. Hegel provides such a teleological structure in his theory of reality as a self-developing Spirit. But Marx recognizes no all comprehensive spiritual reality. Dialectical movement, according to him, results exclusively from the simultaneous existence of con 17 The "contradiction" of ? lengthening labor day as a result of the introduction of machinery devised to shorten the manufacturing process, Marx largely dispels himself by his distinction between constant and vari able capital.

Only the internal structure of the contradictory ele ments, not the anticipatory effect of any final cause, provides the driving force. Yet teleological assumptions abound and are ocassionally expressed. In Capital III we read: The capitalist mode of production is, for this reason, a historical means of developing the material forces of production and creating an appro priate world-market and is, at the same time, a continual conflict between this its historical task and its own corresponding relations of social production. (Capital III, p. 250)18 Even if we consider those assumptions a mere remnant from Marx's Hegelian past which does not intrinsically affect the basic argument, we still shall have to show how contradiction can result in develop ment without the assumption of an overall logical structure which unifies the separate agents into a single, consistent movement. V Even the term "contradiction," if it is to mean more than the simultaneous existence o? different realities, implies the presence of a mental factor. Some interpreters admit this presence?not, to be sure, by reintroducing an Hegelian Spirit, but by granting the human mind a constitutive part in the dialectic of opposing realities.19 (Soviet Marxists have traditionally rejected interpretations of this sort as Hegelian. Yet these present more of an alternative to Hegel's 18 This was no mere slip of the pen. In the Grundrisse where we find his thought in process, Marx states: uThe historical vocation of capital is fulfilled as soon as, on the one hand, demand has developed to the point where there is a general need for surplus labor beyond what is necessary, and surplus labor itself arises from individual needs; and on the other, general industriousness has developed . . . and has been passed on to succeeding generations, until it has become the property of the new generation; and finally when the productive forces of labor . . . have developed to the point where the possession and maintenance of general wealth requires, on the one hand shorter working hours for the whole of society . . ." (Grundrisse, p. 231, McLellan, p. 85). And again: "But this contradictory form [of capitalism] is itself a transitory one, and produces the real conditions of its own termination. The result is the creation of a basis that consists in the tendency towards universal development of the productive forces? and wealth in general, also the universality of commerce and a world market. The basis offers the possibility of the universal development of in dividuals . . ."

The French Marxist Henri Lefebvre, for instance, considers all categories of the dialectic abstract and mental, yet derived from an objective, social reality.20 An empirical study of economic data reveals their con nectedness and opposition. The dialectical structure in which the mind subsequently orders those data allows one to understand them beyond their empirical givenness and to predict their future development. The basic economic category?exchange-value?is developed and, by an internal movement, gives rise to fresh determinations: abstract labor, money, capital. Each complex determination emerges dialecti cally from the preceding ones. Each category has a logical and methodological role, it has its place in the explicative whole which leads to the reconstitution of the given concrete totality, the modern world. It also corresponds to an epoch and the general historical char acteristics of the epoch in question?the framework for events and actions?can be deduced by starting from the category essential to it. This theoretical deduction must thus agree with the empirical and spe cifically historical research into documents, ego-witness accounts, and events.21 Even this most Hegelian of all interpretations falls short of yielding the certainty which Hegel's dialectic derives from the all-encompass ing active Notion. An inductive a priori obtained by repeated ob servation cannot accomplish what Marx's dialectic is supposed to do.22 How much empirical evidence is required to make the dialectic more than a heuristic device or a working hypothesis? Does the available evidence support even a moral certitude? The difficulties increase if we turn to other, less "idealist" in terpretations, the only ones, it should be noted, officially recognized by communist parties. All of them are solidly rooted in Engels' "realist" account of the dialectic. Marxists of existentialist leanings tend to dismiss this account as a betrayal of Marx's theory. Yet they conveniently overlook the fact that Marx himself left the task of justifying his method entirely to his collaborator. Nor did he 20 Cf., Dialectical Materialism, trans.

Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism dogmatically asserts: "Owing to their universal character, the laws of dialectics are of a methodological im portance and serve as pointers for research."

But nowhere is this universal character justified.</page><page sequence="19">MARX'S DIALECTIC 667 remain in the dark about the nature of Engels' interpretation. For Engels personally read the Anti-D?hring, the only finished ex position of the method, to Marx. His work may not exactly express Marx's own thought but, having no information on this thought, we must give serious attention to the sole interpretation of his method which he himself approved. Engels initiated the "realist" interpretation of historical mate rialism in a review of Marx's Contribution to the Critique of Political Economy. Commending Marx for divesting Hegel's logic "of its idealist trappings," he describes the dialectic as a "real process" of interacting and conflicting economic relations.23 The mind merely retraces this extra-mental dialectic, but plays no active role in con necting its moments: they are intrinsically related by themselves.24 Nor is the dialectic restricted to social-economic relations or to human affairs. Dialectic constitutes an essential feature of reality as such. Indeed, it is reality itself in movement. Dialectic, we read in Anti D?hring, is "an extremely general . . . law of the development of nature, history and thought."25 Engels equates motion with contra diction, and matter with motion.26 Even simple mechanical change can occur only because of a body's being at the same time in one place and in another.27 23 Marx-Engels, Selected Works (Moscow: Foreign Languages Publish ing House, 1962), I, p. 374. 24 This "reality" of the contradictions distinguishes what Marxists call "dialectical" from "metaphysical" thought. Thus Maurice Cornforth writes: "According to the common, metaphysical conception, contradictions occur in our ideas about things, but not in things. . . . This point of view regards contradiction simply and solely as a logical relation between propositions, but does not consider it as a real relation between things" (Materialism and the Dialectical Method [New York: International Publishers, 1971], p. 92). 25 Herr Eugen D?hring's Revolution in Science (Anti-D?hring), trans. Emile Burns (New York: International Publishers, s.d. [1966]), p. 154. Henceforth I shall refer to it as Anti-D?hring. 26 "Motion is the mode of existence of matter. Never anywhere has there been matter without motion. . . . Matter without motion is just as unthinkable as motion without matter" (op. cit., p. 68). Together the two assertions provide the entire "justification" for a dialectic of nature. 27 Op. cit., p. 132. To support this assertion Engels refers to Hegel's "rejection" of Aristotle's principle of non-contradiction. This is dubious sup port, since Hegel explicitly claims Aristotle's authority for his own theory of motion. Cf., Hegel, Wissenschaft der Logik (Hamburg: Felix Meiner, 1934 [1967]), I, pp. 192-193. Science of Logic, trans. A. V. Miller (New York: Humanities Press, 1969), p. 198.

Of course, in Hegel also, motion is dialectical. In the Logic, becoming results from the opposition in identity of pure Being and pure Nothing,28 and in the History of Philosophy we read: The reason why dialectic first seizes upon motion as its object lies in the fact that dialectic is itself this motion; or put another way, motion is the dialectic of all that is.29 But Hegel's moving reality is essentially spiritual. Without a spir itual basis a dialectical theory of human praxis is still possible (as non-orthodox, Western Marxists like Lukacs and Korsch have shown), but a dialectical theory of nature is excluded unless one endows "nature" or "matter" with the teleological quality of Hegel's Spirit. We shall see later that this is what happens in orthodox Marxism, though neither methodically nor consistently. In his Philosophical Notebooks Lenin qualified Engels' equation of develop ment and dialectic by specifying that the development must be a unity of contraries. But, by and large, textbooks returned to the simpler version and uncritically assumed that all development is contradictory.31 VI Engels converted contradiction into progressive movement by means of three fundamental laws: the unity of contraries, the 28 Wissenschaft der Logik I, p. 67.

It is worth noting that in an early, polemical work on the dialectical method Lenin restricts it to social development: "What Marx and Engels called the dialectical method is nothing more nor less than the scientific method in sociology, which con sists in regarding society as a living organism in a constant state of de velopment, the study of which requires an objective analysis of the rela tions of production which constitute the given social formation and investiga tion of its laws of functioning and development." (What the ((Friends of the People" Are and How They Fight the Social Democrats. Collected Works, Vol. I, p. 165). 31 For instance, Fundamentals of Marxism-Leninism (Moscow: Foreign Language Publishing House, 1964) states: "All development, whether the evolution of stars, the growth of a plant, the life of a man or the history of society is contradictory in its essence" (p. 79).</page><page sequence="21">MARX'S DIALECTIC 669 negation of negation, and the transformation of quantity into quality.32 Since the official interpretation of Marxist dialectic depends on these laws, we must consider them in some detail. The dynamic quality of the dialectic is due to the so-called law of the contraries, that is, the simultaneous existence of opposite qualities in the same subject. Our earlier discussion of the contradiction has shown how difficult it is to grasp the precise meaning of the alleged con traries/contradictories (the terms are used inconsistently). Marxists generally agree that the contradiction is a conflict between internally connected aspects of the objective world.33 But the internal con tradiction requires the existence of internal relations, which in turn require a connection of all elements of reality. How is such a connection possible without an all-comprehensive logical structure of reality? That Marx assumed the existence of internal relations is, I believe, beyond doubt. Without it his entire critique of politi cal economy becomes unintelligible. In Theories of Surplus Value (III, 503) he criticizes "vulgar" economists for not perceiving the internal connections among the oppositions which they encounter in their science and thus failing to bring out their antagonistic char acter. Yet Marx rarely ventured beyond the man-made contradic tions of economic systems. Engels did and his interpretation became decisive. To him all reality is in process and all its aspects are, therefore, internally related. The great merit of Hegel's system, he claims, is that "the whole natural, historical and spiritual world was presented as a process, that is, as in constant motion, change, transformation and development; and the attempt was made to show the internal interconnections in this motion and development" (Anti D?hring, p. 30). Both nature and history present an endless maze of relations and interactions. Not to see the inner connections between individual things is to overlook their coming into being 32 In the Dialectics of Nature they appear as follows: "The law of the transformation of quantity into quality and vice versa; the law of the inter penetration of opposites; the law of the negation of the negation" (Trans. C. Dutt [New York: International Publishers, 1940], p. 26). Lenin reversed the order of the first two. 33 Cf., for instance, Ts. A. Stepanyan, "Contradictions in the Develop ment of Socialist Society," in Voprosy Filosofii, II (1955), pp. 69-86, and comments in Gustav Wetter, Dialectical Materialism, trans.

Only because they "mutually penetrate each other" (Anti-D?hring, p. 29), do the oppositions of reality result in constant novelty. For Engels the inner relations constitute the moving power of the dialectic: oppositions become dynamic only when they exist within one and the same reality, when a thing is internally divided against itself and its own constituents are in conflict with each other.35 Lenin and Stalin faithfully follow Engels' doctrine. "Dialectics in the proper sense," Lenin writes in his Notebooks, "is the study of contradiction in the very essence of objects." Stalin explicates: Contrary to metaphysics, dialectics holds that internal contradictions are inherent in all things and phenomena of nature, for they all have their negative and positive sides, a past and a future, something dying away and something developing.37 It is the existence of internal relations which makes Soviet philoso phers so confident that nature is self-moving and no longer needs an extra-mundane mover. Yet how can internal relations exist without some logical and teleological structure which unites all elements in an organic totality? One commentator, Bertell Oilman, responds that the internal nature of the "parts" rather than the function of the whole qua whole pro vides the connection.38 He supports his claim by what he considers to be the independence of internal relations in Leibniz's monads of the totality. But the very term parts ("whatever parts") implies an idea of a totum. The reference to Leibniz seems particularly inappropriate, both logically and ontologically, since each monad is directly related to the principle of totality and harmony (God) and only through it to all other monads which it internally "reflects." By themselves, monads constitute separate ("windowless") worlds incapable of direct interaction. Oilman finds the philosophical under 34 Also: "The first thing that strikes us in considering matter in motion is the interconnection of the individual motions of separate bodies, their being determined by one another" (Dialectics of Nature, p. 304). 35 Cf., Gustav A. Wetter, Dialectical Materialism, p. 337. 36 Philosophical Notebooks in Collected Works, Vol. 38, p. 253. 37 Dialectical and Historical Materialism (New York: International Publishers, 1940 [1972]), p. 11.

Dietzgen presupposes it on the basis of cognitive processes which cannot conceive of the real except as relational. I do not see how relations must be internal in the real "parts," unless one assumes idealistically that the relations of the mind are the relations of things. Engels and possibly even Marx made precisely such an assump tion. How would the dialectic apply to nature as well as to history, except on the idealist supposition that nature obeys the same laws as the human mind? Marx's "materialist" reversal of the priorities of nature and mind in no way exorcizes the basic idealist identity of the two. Nor did Engels' further subordination of mind to nature eliminate idealism. On the contrary! That the mind follows dialecti cal laws in its relation to nature is in itself no idealist thesis: the notion of logical law is implied in that of mind (whether derived or original). But once those laws are conceived as existing in reality ?independently of the mind?one moves not away from idealist monism, but closer to it. If nature and mind are aspects of the same totality, the dialectic of history must inevitably entail a dialectic of nature and vice-versa. Marx may not have been quite ready for this conclusion. But I see no consistent way of escaping it on Engels' principles. Oilman is one of the few to have fully understood that the universal existence of internal relations leaves no other choice but to integrate the dialec tic of history with a dialectic of nature. If nature and society are internally related (Marx explicitly denies nature and history are 'two separate things') an examination of any aspect of either involves one immediately with aspects of the other.40 And further: The same kind of response can be given to the question whether the dialectic is in the world or in people's minds thinking about the world. When the logical distinction between the two is rejected, a question which assumes it cannot be asked. In this case, it is important to realize that nature is invariably conceptualized (even as 'nature') and 39/6id.,p. 38. 40Ibid., p. 53.</page><page sequence="24">672 LOUIS DUPR? that people's minds are part of nature in reciprocal interaction with other parts. The claim, therefore, that the dialectic exists in nature and the claim that it exists in people's minds are Identical.'41 This interpretation correctly reflects Engels' thought, yet the author does not seem to realize, any more than Engels himself, that the assumption of a single homogeneous reality subject to laws which the mind brings to conscious expression is an idealist one. To rid the dialectic of its idealism it is not sufficient to reverse the order and to replace a priori methods by empirical ones. Idealists often present their own method as fundamentally empirical.42 Among the few Soviet thinkers who have genuinely tried to overcome the idealist elements in Marxist theory the Georgian logician T. S. Bakradze stands out. In his study on System and Method in Hegel's Philosophy he openly rejects the possibility of internal contradictions and, in general, of internal relations. Only an idealist, specifically a Hegel, can speak of internal contra dictions of concepts, of internal and immanent connections, about transitions from one into the other, because the immanent connec tions?the transition of one concept into another?are equivalent to the self-movement of the concepts.43 If ideas are secondary to reality, internal relations cannot be assumed to exist in reality, since such connections presuppose an ideal struc ture of the real. In the West, Louis Althusser has spearheaded the drive against idealism. To present Marx's dialectic as a mirror image ("right side up") of Hegel's, according to Althusser, fails to account for the novelty of his enterprise. For Marx's dialectic pro ceeds not by "cumulative internaiization," as Hegel's Spirit does, but by "the accumulation of effective determinations (deriving from the superstructures and from special national and international circum stances) on the determination in the last instance by the economic."44 Rather than being internal contradictions created by a single self 41 Ibid., p. 269. 42 Thus Koj?ve characterizes Hegel's method in the Phenomenology as empirical and descriptive insofar as Hegel "looks at the real and describes what he sees, everything that he sees, and nothing but what he sees," Introduction to the Reading of Hegel, trans.

In Althusser's language, contradictions originate through over-determination.45 Althusser correctly identifies the theory of internal contradic tions as idealist. The question arises, however, whether a "dialectic" of external contradictions can still claim predictability. On what basis can the innumerable external determinations acting on one another be said to establish a homogeneous, relatively simple struc ture of development with a clearly foreseeable outcome? As we observed earlier, dialectical contradiction cannot be simply equated with social conflict; it consists of an historically necessary conflict that will result in an equally necessary "resolution." While Althusser seems but dimly aware of the problems in herent in a dialectic of external contradictions, another structural ist, writing under his influence has attempted to justify its logical consistency. In an essay on "Structure and Contradiction in Capital"46 Maurice Godelier strongly asserts the dialectical quality of Marx's theory, while denying all intrinsic dependence on Hegel's theory. He distinguishes internal contradictions within an economic structure, such as the relation between capital and labor, from con tradictions between two different structures, such as the opposition between the social conditions of production and the forces of produc tion. The latter opposition is external because the forces of produc tion constitute "a reality completely distinct from the relations of production and irreducible to them" (p. 356). It is precisely because one does not imply the other that the opposition between the two 45 Althusser's theory is not entirely new. Already Plekhanov had cautioned against a simplistic understanding of the economic determination, claiming rightly that Marx's theory oiinteraction between productive forces and social relations excludes the simple economic determinism of which he is so often accused. See Fundamental Problems of Marxism (Moscow: Progress Publishers, 1908 [1976]), pp. 52-56. Karl Kautsky in his classical study on the materialist concept of history is even more explicit. "Let us not forget: only in the final analysis is the whole juridical, political, ideological complex to be regarded as a superstructure upon an economic infrastructure. It does not necessarily apply to any individual phenomenon in history. Whether it be economic, ideological or other, in some relations it may function as infrastructure, in others as superstructure" (Die Materialistische Geschichtsauffassung [Berlin, 1927], I, p. 837). 46 First published in Les Temps Modernes 246 (Nov. 1966) and later translated in a collection Ideology in Social Science, ed.

The second contradiction "does not contain within itself the set of conditions for its solution" (p. 356) and therefore results in violent conflict. Unfortunately, the text of Capital supports no clear distinction between internal and external contradictions. For Marx, simple pro duction and circulation lead directly to capitalist production and cir culation and, eventually, to revolutionary conflict. The original opposition between use and exchange value contains all subsequent ones. It is true enough that the contradiction immanent in the commodity from the beginning only creates the possibility of social conflicts and that for this possibility to become actualized a number of conditions must be fulfilled which are not given with the existence of the commodity as such.47 Yet those conditions, those circum stances are not simply extrinsic to the internal contradiction. They follow from it directly and necessarily though not immediately. In and through its own development capitalist production creates the conditions which convert the possible into the actual conflict.48 The contradictions in Marx's theory cannot achieve what they are sup posed to achieve without being internal. The structuralists can win the battle against idealism only by sacrificing the dialectic itself. VII The problems created by the idealist heritage in Marx's dialectic increase with the law of the negation of negation. Simply stated, 47 "The antithesis, use-value and value; the contradictions that private labor is bound to manifest itself as direct social labor, that a particularized concrete kind of labor has to pass for abstract human labor; the contradic tion between the personification of objects and the representation of persons by things; all these antitheses and contradictions, which are immanent in commodities, assert themselves, and develop their modes of motion, in the antithetical phases of the metamorphosis of a commodity. These modes therefore imply the possibility, and no more than the possibility, of crises. The conversion of this mere possibility into a reality is the result of a long series of relations . . ." (Capital I, 114). See also, Grundrisse 310, Nicolaus 406. 48 Marx also distinguishes an external from an internal opposition. But one directly entails the other. "Commodities, first of all, enter into the process of exchange just as they are. The process then differentiates them into commodities and money, and thus produces an external opposi tion corresponding to the internal opposition inherent in them, as being at once use-values and values. Commodities as use-values now stand opposed to money as exchange-value. On the other hand, both opposing sides are commodities, unities of use-value and value" (Capital I, 104).</page><page sequence="27">MARX'S DIALECTIC 675 the second negation prevents the dialectical movement from coming to an end after the first conflict. In the Hegelian tradition Marxists ascribe to this moment the progressive nature, what Lenin termed "the spiral form," of the dialectic. For Hegel the second negation is far more than a negative movement which ends up negating itself. It includes, in fact, a positive aspect as well as a negative one, since it leads to a genuinely new and positive synthesis in which the origi nal conflict is resolved. The first negation, the contradiction, is not fully understood until it is understood also as a unity of contraries. Hegel himself insisted on the two-fold function of this second negation when he envisioned the possibility of distinguishing four moments rather than three in the dialectical process.49 Yet Marx's dialectic differs from Hegel's on a crucial issue. While for Hegel the second negation completes the cycle and brings the dialectical movement to a temporary conclusion, Marx admits in principle no concluding synthesis, not even a temporary one. Con flicts are not resolved; they intensify until their combined effect explodes in a revolution. Nor is this a later interpretation of Marx's theory. Marx's reaction against Hegel's triadic cycles dates back to his student years in Berlin. From his fellow Young Hegelians he had learned to distrust the dialectical "synthesis" through which the German philosopher had brought the revolutionary power of his method to rest in a religious and political conservatism. Hegel's syntheses, according to his emancipated disciples, are mere stepping stones toward the final synthesis of the Prussian, Protestant State. They betray the dialectical principle which, rather than ratifying the established reality, criticizes and changes it. Marx had soon repudiated the purely "critical" and theoretical approach of the Young Hegelians. For him the real dialectic of history occurs not through speculation but through practice, and a practice negates not uni versally, but selectively. Yet Marx never reversed his stand on the 49 G. W. F. Hegel, Wissenschaft der Logik (Hamburg: Meiner, 1934), II, p. 497. Comments in Eric Weil, "The Hegelian Dialectic" in The Legacy of Hegel, ed. J. O'Malley, K. W. Algozin, H. P. Kainz, L. C. Rice, (The Hague: Nijhoff, 1973), p. 58. Lenin understood this dual na ture of the second negation. Quoting Hegel's statement about the dialectical negation negating only the immediate he comments: "Not empty negation, not futile negation, not sceptical negation, vacillation and doubt is charac teristic and essential in dialectics ... no, but negation as a movement of connection, as a moment of development, retaining the positive ..." (Philosophical Notebooks in Collected Works 38, p. 226).</page><page sequence="28">676 LOUIS DUPR? endless character of dialectical negation. This creates serious prob lems in understanding the law of negation of negation, especially with respect to the "spiral form" of the resulting development. Here again Marx's thought has received two different interpre tations: one that brings the dialectic to a more or less complete halt in the communist society (the interpretation of Plekhanov, Lenin, Stalin, and subsequent "party" philosophers), the other which attri butes to the praxis the same permanent negation which the Young Hegelians reserved to the philosophical critique (the position of the Frankfurt school). According to the latter, the movement of nega tion never reaches an end; it must continue to revolutionize the es tablished order. In the words of Theodor Adorno: ... it is a refusal to lend itself to sanctioning things as they are. To negate a negation does not bring about its reversal; it proves rather that the negation is not negative enough. . . . This is the decisive break with Hegel. To use identity as a palliative for dialectical con tradiction ... is to ignore what the contradiction means.50 Frankfurt philosophers justify their apparent deviation from tradi tional Marxist theory by what they consider the un-Marxist develop ment of the official communist practice itself. As far as I know, Marx applies the negation of negation only to social developments. In Capital I, he uses it to explain the evolu tion of private property. Individual private property directly result ing from work is destroyed by capitalist production which expropri ates both the workers' products and their instruments of production. But capitalist property will, in turn, be negated when the means of production become common property. The capitalist mode of appropriation, the result of the capitalist mode of production, produces capitalist private property. This is the first negation of individual private property, as founded on the labor of the proprietor. But capitalist production begets, with the inexora bility of a law of nature, its own negation. It is the negation of negation. This does not reestablish private property for the pro ducer, but gives him individual property based on the acquisitions of the capitalist era: i.e., on cooperation and the possession in common of the land and of the means of production. (Capital I, 763) We find other instances of the dialectical negation of negation, but always in social-economic developments. 50 Negative Dialectics, trans. E. B. Ashton (New York: Seabury Press, 1973), p. 159.</page><page sequence="29">MARX'S DIALECTIC 677 Engels universalized the law and considered social processes a particular instance of natural processes. In Anti-D?hring, he applies the principle to botany, geology, and mathematics as well as to history and anthropology. Most of this is of dubious value for the under standing of natural processes. What does it mean (Anti-D?hring, p. 169) that a grain of barley germinates, ceases to exist as a grain (negation) and becomes a plant which, in turn, produces new grains and dies (negation of negation)? Does Engels say anything more than that natural developments follow a cyclic pattern? Not only is this non-informative, but it is non-dialectical as well, for in such a presentation the distinctness of the third moment from the first is lost.51 Yet this distinctness is essential to a dialectic of social revolution. Not surprisingly, then, most contemporary Marxists have quietly abandoned Engels' scientific simplifications. Cornforth, for instance, denies that the law of negation of negation applies to all forms of development, even though he upholds the dialectical char acter of all development. The importance of this conception of negation of negation does not lie in its supposedly expressing the necessary pattern of all develop ment. All development takes place through the working out of con tradictions?that is a necessary universal law; but specinc contradic tions do not necessarily work out in such a way that an earlier stage of development is repeated at a later stage?sometimes that may happen and sometimes not, depending on the specific character of the processes of development. Yet the repetition of an earlier stage is a notable feature of some processes of development and, moreover, to bring it about is often an important aim of practice.52 Yet the real difficulty concerns the nature of the synthesis. A mere negation of the state of affairs resulting from a "contradiction" presents nothing really new unless one assumes that the development follows an upward direction. But this "spiral" movement is not given by the negation of negation, it is presupposed by it. In Hegel, a self-realizing Spirit justifies this upward trend. But, for Marx, progress must emerge from the contradictions themselves. Then the difficult question arises how Marx's second negation differs from the first or, for that matter, from any other. It is hard to 51 Kautsky has pointed out other inadequacies in Engels' presentation, especially the obvious fact that the new life in nature is not directly caused by the death of the old.

Plekhanov also expresses reservations about its universal application.</page><page sequence="30">678 LOUIS DUPR? conceive of a negation of negation without introducing teleological considerations. A dialectic consisting exclusively of a collision of dif ferent aspects of a moving reality ("objective contradictions") holds no clue whatever about the outcome of its contradictions. Even Lenin's "apparent return to the old"53 cannot be justified and, of course, the notion of "progress" must remain wholly unsupported. The Darwinian priority of "the fittest" holds no promise of constant progress or even of temporary improvement, for "fit" is any situation that survives the present contradiction. What survives will be more compatible with the prevailing conditions than what changes, but nothing guarantees that it will possess a higher degree of intrinsic perfection. It does not mean the best possible or even "better," except in the one respect of being able to cope with the current conditions. Yet Marxist philosophers usually regard a developing reality to be an upward moving reality. Cornforth, whom we found earlier distinguishing processes which are truly progressive (negation of negation) from others which are not, denies that the distinction depends on any difference between "nature" and "spirit" and asserts that a movement can have direction without any consciousness to direct it (the hypothesis of God being explicitly excluded). But, then, what determines some movements as progressive in contrast to others? Cornforth's answer blatantly begs the question: "If some processes have direction and others have not, this depends solely on the particular character of the processes themselves and of the con ditions under which they happen."54 We cannot speak of the direc tion of everything, he claims, "but only of the direction of the par ticular things in which we are interested such as the 'forward' move ment from feudalism to capitalism to communism."55 Clearly this is too arbitrary to merit discussion. More to the point, Kautsky observes that each organism pos sesses its own structure for self-preservation and procreation, and may be considered more perfect as it is better equipped to cope with both. "It is impossible to say that this teleology and perfection increase in the course of development of a series of organisms, that the more highly developed ones, which are farthest removed from 53 Philosophical Notebooks in Collected Works 38, p. 222. My critique is confirmed by Wetter: "It is clear that a twofold negation by no means necessarily lands one back at the starting point (even at a higher level)" (Dialectical Materialism, p. 364). 54 Op. cit., p. 109. 55Ibid., p. 110.</page><page sequence="31">MARX'S DIALECTIC 679 the forms of their ancestors, are better organized, more vital and more affirmative than the simple ones."56 Precisely because of its anthropomorphic teleology, in which he detects the influence of Kant,57 Kautsky rejects any equation of Marxist dialectic with a Darwinian theory of evolution. The law of negation of negation constitutes a Marxist attempt to retain Hegel's ascending movement without his spiritualism. I do not believe that it has succeeded in its task. For to be pro gressive a process of negation must follow a teleological direction for which there is no room in Marx's theory. Some Marxists implicitly admit this and consider the law to be nothing more than the dialectical negation (understood in the Marxist sense of pure contradiction) brought to its ultimate conclusion. Others attempt to give it a sepa rate status by distinguishing it as a particular species of the generic law of negation.58 Most consistent was Stalin who dropped the law of negation of negation altogether, replacing it by two others of his own making. Stalin fully realized that the law was either redundant or idealist. Once the negation is reduced to a simultaneous presence of "contrary" elements in reality, no resources remain from which "positive" meanings can be extracted. The dialectical move ment then is reduced to a natural process of evolution extended to include social developments.59 56 Die Materialistische Geschichtsauffassung, p. 139. 57 Ibid., p. 197. 58 Plekhanov thus describes the negation of negation: "Every phenome non, developing to its conclusion, becomes transformed into its opposite; but as the new phenomenon, being opposite to the first, also is transformed in its turn into its own opposite, the third phase of development bears a formal resemblance to the first" (The Development of the Monist View of History, trans. Andrew Rothstein [New York: International Publishers, 1972], p. 81). Of course, resemblance is not identity, yet Plekhanov's reservations about the triadic character of the dialectic indicates that he is in the dark as to how the second negation could essentially differ from the first. Lenin also places it at the end of the list in his "Elements of Dialectics" (Notebooks, Collected Works 38, p. 221) as if it were implied by the doctrine of the unity of opposites (cf., p. 223). On the questions which Soviet philosophers have begun to raise about the same point, see Guy Planty Bonjour, The Categories of Dialectical Materialism, pp. 136-138. 59 Godelier also concludes that the negation of negation has lost its validity in a dialectic that is no longer propelled by a self-moving Spirit. Marx's dialectic must dispense with all internal teleology. It consists entirely in a conflict of incompatible but relatively independent structures. Unlike Stalin, Godelier does not appeal to some self-evident law of evolution that conflict must result in greater perfection. I suspect that he assumes progress, though.</page><page sequence="32">680 LOUIS DUPR? But if the third movement brings nothing new, has the dialectic not changed from triadic to dyadic? Most Marxists continue to pay lip service to the triadic form, but they often do so with little con viction. Plekhanov, while upholding the triadic schema against Mikhailovski, estimates that "it does not at all play in Hegel's work the part which is attributed to it by those who have no idea of his philosophy."60 His judgment may be erroneous for Hegel, but it certainly applies to Marx. Lenin, in his early polemic with the same Mikhailovski, claims that attempts to prove the correctness of the triad are but a relic of Hegelianism; Engels does not even men tion the triads in his method.61 If the second negation introduces no positive element into the dialectic, is the Marxist still justified in expecting a final synthesis, a positive and permanent state of society? Here the critique of orthodox Marxism by the Frankfurt school becomes particularly pertinent. How could all contradictions be resolved in a socialist society without bringing the dialectic to the same artificial halt which Marx and the Young Hegelians denounced in Hegel? Orthodox Marxists have not remained unaware of the problem. It forced Lenin to distinguish "antagonism" from "contradiction": the former would disappear, while the latter would remain and become the moving power in the development of the communist society.62 Stalin went further and admitted the continued existence of genuine con tradictions, such as the conflict between the peasant class and the proletariat, in the socialist society of the Soviet Union. Even permanent contradictions between relations of production and the productive forces of society continue to exist, since the development of production always lags behind the development of productive 60 Op. cit., p. 79. 61 What the Friends of the People Are and How They Fight the Social Democrats in Collected Works I, p. 164. Some contemporary Soviet philosophers express similar reservations. T. A. Kazakevich and A. G. Abolentseva conclude their article on "Some Problems concerning the Law of the Negation of Negation": "Marxism by no means rejects the triad, but nor is it regarded as a universal master key which can be used to prove every thing. As understood in dialectical materialism, the triad is above all expres sion of the path of double negation pursued by all natural and social phenomena as well as our knowledge, in the course of their development" (Vestnik Leningradskogo Universiteta, XXIII [1956], p. 76).

Mao alone was consistent enough to perceive the con sequences of a negative dialectic when he declared the existence of genuine contradictions between individuals and society to be "nothing strange" in a communist society and when, in 1957, he criticized Stalin for not having perceived the existence of internal contradic tions, such as the oppositions between mass and leaders, and for having treated them as external antagonisms.64 The proliferation of scholastic distinctions between communist and other oppositions suggests that Marxists have not been able to account satisfactorily for a "positive" synthesis in a dialectic of internal conflict. The law of negation of negation constitutes a somewhat incongruous attempt to introduce evolution into what bas ically is a dialectic of revolution. The law neither explains nor justifies what it purports to achieve, since it has not been ade quately integrated with the dialectical method as Marx conceived it. VIII As the status of the negation of negation became more and more dubious, the law of transformation from quantity to quality gained in importance. Stalin and his followers who had dropped the former strongly emphasized the latter. The reason is not difficult to grasp. If the negation of negation was considered to be too idealist to be effective in a Marxist dialectic, some other law had to be found to direct the movement resulting from contradiction, more specifically to give it a consistent upward turn. Marxists came to seek it more and more in a scientific theory that, without invoking any teleology, and by purely empirical methods, succeeded in educing intelligible patterns of development out of conflict and in creating an expectation, however gratuitous, of continuing progress. Neo-Darwinism par ticularly appealed to Marxist dialecticians for having dislodged final causality from its last stronghold. The survival of the fittest alone 63 "Economie Problems of Socialism in the U.S.S.R. (1952)," in Current Soviet Policies, ed. Leo Gruliow (New York: Praeger, 1953), p. 14. 64 Arthur A.

Already in his work On Contradiction (1937) (Selected Readings, Peking, 1971) Mao advocates a theory of permanent contradiction.</page><page sequence="34">682 LOUIS DUPR? sufficed, or so it was thought, to account for the emergence of ever more developed forms. At the same time, the theory of evolution so intimately combined conflict with movement that it might be regarded as the scientific counterpart of Hegelian dialectic. Already Marx and Engels had taken a lively interest in Darwin's theory. But they had rejected, as had Hegel himself, the concept of a gradual change from one species to another: dialectic progressed by sudden reversals. De Vries' discovery of genetic mutations dispelled the dialecticians' reservations.65 Where once the negation of negation had been needed to secure the "upward turn" of the dialectic, hence forth the law of quantity and quality interpreted in a Neo-Darwinian fashion would suffice to give the dialectical movement a "progressive" direction. Hegel's principle asserted that purely quantitative in creases eventually result in qualitative changes "and," Engels adds, "vice versa."m Marx applies the principle to the transition from precapitalists to capitalist possession of money and commodities.67 Engels points out similar transitions in the fourth part of Capital I on "The Production of Relative Surplus-Value" (Anti-D?hring, p. 139). Other instances are the transformation of value from use value to money and the transitions between the successive modes of co operation that lead to capitalist production.68 65 This is not to say, of course, that Marxism simply threw its lot in with Neo-Darwinism. Lysenko's now discredited attempts to revive Lamarck's theory of the inheritance of acquired habits, officially accepted through most of the Stalin era, reminds us of the contrary. In Engels' unpublished papers one passage criticizes Darwinism as a simplistic trans position of Hobbes' bellum omnium contra omnes and bourgeois economic struggles to the development of nature (Archiv K. Marxa i Engelsa [Moscow], II, p. 62.) 66 Dialectics of Nature, trans. C. Dutt, p. 26. Hegel's thesis that changes remain purely quantitative until they surpass the "measure" of an object, at which point a qualitative "leap" occurs is found in Wissenschaft der Logik, pp. 343-346; Science of Logic, pp. 333-336. The "vice versa" which has puzzled commentators is based on Hegel's words: "But we have seen that the alterations of being in general are not only the transition of one magnitude into another, but a transition from quality into quantity and vice versa" (Logik I, p. 383; Science of Logic, p. 370). 67 "Here, as in natural science, is shown the correctness of the law discovered by Hegel (in his 'Logic'), that merely quantitative differences beyond a certain point pass into qualitative changes" (Capital I, p. 309). A footnote refers to a molecular theory of modern chemistry as developed by Laurent and Gerhardt. In a letter written to Engels on June 22, 1867, Marx also refers to the qualitative leap in a quantitative series. 68 Cf., Rosenthal, op. cit., pp. 129-137.</page><page sequence="35">MARX'S DIALECTIC 683 Engels argues that the entire present flora and fauna have re sulted from small quantitative changes accumulating until they turned into qualitative changes over millions of years.69 Character istically, Plekhanov and Lenin removed the law from the first place which it held with Engels. The two Russians were anxious enough to provide social theory with a "scientific" foundation, but they con sidered change essentially subordinate to conflict. Both were pri marily concerned with social conflict, one as a philosopher of revolu tion, the other as a practical revolutionary. In Hegel's dialectic they found, above all, a method for the understanding of social dy namics. Their interest in the positive sciences was entirely second ary. Yet, they felt, the dialectic would remain an idealist theory of action, unless it was integrated with the determinist laws of the material universe. In this respect, Lenin remained a faithful follower of Plekhanov. Z. A. Jordan's suggestive description of the "political cosmology" of one applies equally well to the other. As long as Plekhanov considered the concurrence, sequence and con catenation of historical events alone, revolutions and upheavals were bound to remain what they actually are, namely, contingent and un foreseeable occurrences. Only the cosmological doctrine of leaps allowed him to establish the inevitability of political revolutions by some kind of cosmic decree and natural necessity.70 The law of the interp?n?tration of opposites is "cosmologized" for the same reason: "A universe brimming over with strife, conflict and con tradiction offers self-evident advantages for a social and political theory based on the concept of class antagonism and class struggle."71 Thus the two men who restored Hegel's dialectic to Marx's theory, were, by a perverse paradox of fate, also responsible for its develop ment toward a homogeneous materialist system. Yet it took a different kind of mind to complete this develop ment. Engels had first attempted to streamline Marxist dialectic into a "scientific" system. Yet he had been too close to Marx's original vision and had perhaps remained too imbued by the spirit of Hegel's philosophy to reduce the dialectic to a unified, scientific theory. Stalin came better prepared for the task of reducing the dialectic to a cosmic 69 He fails to account for the "vice-versa" of the transition from quantity to quality. For some contemporary attempts, cf., Planty-Bonjour, op. cit., pp. 126-127. 70 Z. A.

Unencumbered by Marx's "spirit" or by a thorough acquaint ance with Hegel's work and endowed with an orderly school-master's mind, he felt but little empathy with the unpredictable novelty of a dialectic of freedom. If dialectical developments were "necessary," as Marx's theory claimed they were, there was no good reason to keep politics apart from a deterministic but fully dialectical cos mology. Stalin uninhibitedly proceeded to homogenize history and nature. Significant for his attitude is that he restored the law of the transition from quantity to quality to the primary position which it had held in Engels and from which Plekhanov (followed by Lenin) had removed it. To Stalin the qualitative leap constitutes the essence of the evolutionary process of nature. Since he equated the in creasing complexification of this process with progress, the dialectic would now apply to nature and society in the same way.72 Thus Marx's dialectic was converted into an all-comprehensive theory of evolution of which the revolutionary praxis presents but a particular facet. Only with Stalin does the "monist view" of reality fully conquer Marxist thought. All preceding positions still labored under too much ambiguity to allow an entirely homogeneous description of all aspects of reality. Idealist considerations kept interfering with the professed materialism. Stalin attempted to remove the last remnants of ideal ism. He may, thereby, have improved the logical consistency of Marx's theory. Yet what Marxism gained in coherence, it lost in revolutionary power. Stalin attempted to reduce to logical con sistency what was by its very nature irreducible to unity. He thereby stifled revolutionary action into dialectical determinism, sub jecting human initiative to the same necessity which rules the mate rial world. In retrospect, we notice in the development of Marxist theory an increasing tendency to impose unity upon a dualist mode of think ing. This was mostly attempted by eliminating the "idealist" factor in favor of the "naturalist" one. If the attempts had ever completely succeeded?Stalin came close to success?the dialectic would have been converted into the unchanging law of a system of nature. But 72 "The dialectical method therefore [i.e., on the basis of this law] holds that the process of development should be understood not as movement in a circle, not as a simple repetition of what has already occurred, but as an inward and upward movement, as a transition from an old, qualitative state, as a development from the simple to the complex, from the lower to the higher" (Dialectical and Historical Materialism, p. 9).</page><page sequence="37">MARX'S DIALECTIC 685 such a "naturalist" dialectic must remain descriptive. It is most doubtful whether it could still fulfill the purpose for which Marx devised it, namely, to understand the social-economic development of history in such a way that we gain a certain knowledge of the future as well as the means to hasten its coming.
