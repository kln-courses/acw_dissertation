(Habelts Dissertationsdrucke, Reihe klassische Archiologie 17.) Pp. 375. Rudolf Habelt, Bonn 1982. The last 15 years have produced a wealth of scholarly studies on the earliest large-scale Greek statuary and the related problems of origins and stylistic "transitions" from Mycenaean to Geometric to Daedalic to Archaic. The ap- proaches have been typological (Kranz), medium-oriented (Adams), or concentrated on a geographical region (Ozgan and Blome), a specific site (Rizza) or even a single piece (Davaras). All have contributed to a clearer picture of early Greek art, but at the same time have raised more specific questions regarding content and function and have advo- cated an "interdisciplinary" approach to allow for a broader</page><page sequence="2">414 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [AJA 88 understanding of the formative period of Greek culture. Jung's book, a doctoral dissertation, falls into this last cate- gory-it analyzes the iconography of the enthroned deity in early Greek art and literature. It is divided into 3 major parts and includes a museum index of the works mentioned in the text. Part I identifies some of the more notable peculiarities, literary as well as representational, of the enthroned deity, and outlines possible avenues of interpretation which are followed in the rest of the text. Jung notes that, contrary to what one might expect upon reading Homer or considering the Zeus of Pheidias, the enthroned divinity is very much an exception in art until the late 7th/early 6th c. He also ob- serves that the earliest large-scale seated statues of deities are female and do not date before the middle of the 7th c. By examining the extant literary and representational evidence, primarily of the 8th and 7th cs., Jung proposes to clarify these iconographic inconsistencies. He seeks to explain the relatively late appearance of the enthroned form in art by the influence of the male ideal imposed by the aristocratic notion of heroic qualities. These ideals lose some of their power late in the 7th and early 6th c. and give way to a greater degree of representational differentiation (and individualization), resulting in a wider variety of poses and garments in sculpture, and of mythological themes in the two- dimensional and literary arts. Having established this rather complex thesis, Jung proceeds with the detailed analysis of the evidence leading to these conclusions. Part II, "Enthroned and Seated Gods in Homer," is sub- divided by means of Arabic numerals, capital, lower case and Greek letters into 11 sections. It examines the function of the throne in Homer and its use by deities and mortals in the epics, attempting to prove that the anthropomorphic Ho- meric gods resembled their human counterparts in having a determined social order, but differed from them regarding female etiquette: a goddess may be enthroned, but not a mortal woman. Homer does not necessarily use the throne as a symbol of might, but as a sign of honor, especially in the context of a communal meal from which women were excluded. Part III, "Enthroned and Seated Gods in the Represen- tational Arts of the Eighth, Seventh Centuries," comprises the bulk of the book. It contains 3 major categories, each subdivided, so that there are 37 headings. The first section examines the tradition of seated deities in light of both ex- tant works and literary evidence for four cult statues com- monly accepted as having been seated. Although we have evidence of large-scale figures of deities from the late 8th c., Jung concludes that the seated pose was not employed until the mid-7th c., in relatively few cases, and for female deities only. Jung's analysis of the extant sculpture is thorough, but seems slanted to support his thesis that the seated pose appears later than the standing. The superb torso from Gor- tyn, generally accepted as the earliest known example of the type, is by no means surely a deity, nor is it firmly dated. Beyer's date of the late 8th c. is probably too early, but Jung's mid-7th c. does not rest on any firmer basis, so it might be best to accept Kranz's date in the second quarter of that century. The evidence is too fragmentary and the dates too imprecise to argue for an appreciable difference between the inception of the seated and standing poses in large-scale sculpture. Tradition has generally accepted four important early cult statues as having been seated: the Athena in the Iliad (6.286-311), the old cult statue of Athena Lindia, the Athena Polias on the Athenian Akropolis and the cult statue of Hera in Tiryns. Jung analyzes each separately to demon- strate that none of them can be used as an unquestionable example of an early seated cult statue. Although his skepti- cism is healthy and the analysis remarkably thorough, in no case does he prove conclusively that the statue could not have been seated. Jung's last point in this section, that male seated statues occur appreciably later than female, may also be questioned. It is true that female figurines in the seated pose are far more numerous, but males are by no means unattested. The iconography in most cases is uncertain; we cannot ascertain whether any represent deities. Jung himself suggests, however, that the male partner in a 7th c. ivory couple from Sparta may represent a god. Images of the seated Zeus giving birth to Athena are listed as the exception by Jung who also dismisses (in a footnote) the large seated statue from Haghiorghitika as possible evidence for a 7th c. male example. Kranz has argued convincingly for the identifica- tion of the figure as male and is supported by Ridgway and Adams. The most widely accepted date for this statue-late 7th c.-is reasonable and should therefore be considered as support for the relatively early appearance of the male seated statue. The second section of part III examines the reasons for the choice of the seated pose for female deities only. In this long discussion, Jung seeks the answer to the differentiation in the rendering of male and female figures during the late 8th and 7th cs. in the strong influence which the heroic ideals of the nobility exerted on art and literature. He notes that whereas female figures during this period commonly wore long garments, the male, with a few exceptions, notably charioteers, wore only short garments or a girdle, or were naked. In the few instances where a male figure is rendered seated, he is clothed; thus the pose and the long garment should be associated as a formal unit. Jung suggests that therefore this pose was avoided for male deities, who had to be rendered according to the heroic ideals of the age which demanded the appearance of excellent physical health, strength and beauty. The Greeks' insistence on exercise and on military as well as athletic games as part of a young man's education is used as supporting evidence for the workings of these ideals in actual life. Beauty of character and eloquence were also important factors in the heroic ideal, but-since these cannot easily be represented in art-the artist distilled only the physical aspects of it. As a result, according to Jung, the seated pose which formally demanded the long garment was eschewed even for the gods. The heroic ideal opposed the seated pose. Jung explains the proliferation of the seated pose for female deities and mortal women of this same period as echoing a parallel female ideal which also</page><page sequence="3">1984] BOOK REVIEWS 415 emphasized good outward appearance, defined in terms of rich garments and ornaments. The further insistence on the development of skills in the domestic arts, such as spinning and weaving, resulted in the obvious preference of the seated pose for women. Jung concludes this section with a discussion of the possi- ble reasons for the clearly noticeable change around the be- ginning of the 6th c., characterized by a proliferation of mythological themes and parallel interest in the differentia- tion of personages by garment and pose. He argues that so- cial changes resulting in the lessened influence of aristocrats were mostly responsible for this development. He concedes only a minor role to influence from the Near East. Finally, "The Late Beginning of Large-scale Seated Stat- ues" is a too brief discussion of the inherently Greek formal reasons for, and possible Near Eastern influence on, the inception of the seated pose in sculpture. Jung argues co- gently that an essentially Greek atmosphere was formally responsible for the earliest seated statues and restricts Near Eastern influence to a minor role of "ideas" picked up at will by the Greek artists. He suggests that this indigenous Greek development first departed from Geometric tendencies around the middle of the 7th c., but that the seated pose was avoided for a time because of problems with its inherent three-dimensionality. Since volume does not necessarily mean mass, as clearly demonstrated by some of the superb Geometric bronzes, this argument is not convincing and is not supported by the works of art themselves, if we assume a date before the mid-7th c. for the Gortyn torso. Jung's thesis is an ambitious one, thoroughly documented and clearly organized. The complex outline format, which insists on emphasizing even minor transitions, serves, however, to confuse rather than aid the reader. It permits too much repetition and reinforces the dissertation character of the work. Illustrations would have been most welcome, es- pecially since many of the arguments are based on only a few works.
