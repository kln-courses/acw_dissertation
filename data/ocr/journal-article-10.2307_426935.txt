<plain_text><page sequence="1">PICASSO AT ANTIBES CAROL HAMILTON In Picasso we have witnessed a seeming eclecticism transformed into a new aesthetic. He only alludes to different pasts, out of this century, whose historical consciousness is acute. Our present viewpoint is one of relativity, and we under- stand art to be an abstracting from reality which no longer falls within a believed Absolute. It makes of art an individual undertaking; and today art is typically individual (even when it is not subjective) and romantic. We are used to the clich6 that artists are experimenting with means, and also with meanings. But within this diversity of expression which to the spectator has seemed extreme and without direction, Picasso consistently states a positive. Picasso has always escaped the net by which our criticism would encompass him. The pictures at the Museum at Antibes show once again a mutation from earlier periods, and at the same time a summation of his work. These pictures are a product of the Mediterranean environment: there are still-lifes of fish and shell- fish; paintings of boats and blue sea; drawings and paintings where the fantasy of satyr and faun takes us back to the primitive goat-song of early Greece; there are the ceramics which take their place with these. We find a reflection of a Mediterranean timelessness, a new joie de vivre, and technically, a further sim- plicity of form and directness of pictorial expression. But where is the dramatic power of "Guernica"? The sombre tension of the war-time still lifes? Or, from his earlier work, the plastic experiments of collage, and the strict Cubist compositions? The time has passed; these are finished, given, forgotten. By now the Antibes period is behind Picasso too. He has moved on. We are left to remark on his sensitivity to the social temperature, to which each of these periods was relevant, at the same time that his creation deals with another level of reality. What is the constant that binds together Picasso's "complete works"? We need to go behind the artist to find the man and his intentions. Otto Rank has given a psychological analysis in which we can recognize Picasso as the archetype of the Romantic artist: "seeking new forms and contents in order to express his personal life more completely," for "whereas the Primitive artist type finds his justification in the work itself; the Classical justifies the work by the life; but the Romantic must justify both work and experience ... His artistic work is a forcible liberation from inward pressure."' What this pressure is need not occupy us, as it lies within the field of psy- chology, but it helps to clarify Picasso's continual need to find new forms. Through creation the artist tries to deliver himself from the transience of per- sonal experience and from his guilt feeling for using up his allotted years: thus the need for justification. He renders the transient in an enduring, spiritual image: but once the picture is finished, the magic will no longer work; he tries to take refuge in life again; and again mortality cannot satisfy him. This is the spiral I Otto Rank, Art and Artist, New York, 1932. 478</page><page sequence="2">479</page><page sequence="3">480 CAROL HAMILTON which pushes the Romantic artist to further and further planes of execution, and although as a man he would like to escape this other reality, which his creative knowledge has forced upon him, there is no turning back. Picasso is a performer who cannot rest on his achievement: he does not plan for final significance, as the Classical artist is able to do. There is another character besides originality which this compulsive alterna- tion causes, and that is recklessness. The work of the Romantic artist will be less sustained than that of the Classical, who can perfect the outward expression while guarding his private life. But Picasso is reckless; he continually exposes him- self; we have seen how he builds up a reputation only to supersede himself. He continually rushes into the unknown, "flung hither and thither between the urge to perpetuate his own life by creating and the compulsion to turn himself and his life into a work of art."2 We have seen many portraits of "Mademoiselle D.M.," in many different styles: this is Picasso's means of turning his very personal emotion in whatever ways possible into the preservative of an enduring, imper- sonal form. He needs to transform, and will do so even incompletely, for he can- not wait for perfection. Clement Greenberg condemned many of the Antibes pictures, perhaps justi- fiably, for lacking in taste, and specifically for: "insensitive and disruptive color, arbitrary space handling, literary distortions that lack plastic justification, forced emotion. .. "3 But there is a difference in this connection between our art and that of the past, and particularly of the Classical art of the past: a modern picture is no longer complete in the sense that the Renaissance picture was, where all the problems had been worked out in advance in such detail that the actual painting could sometimes be turned over to apprentices. In the art of today, the spectator is witness to the artist's struggles on the canvas. Thus Picasso goes from one pic- ture to the next till he has wrung from that particular problem a particular solu- tion. So we may say that it is in spite of a percentage of "failures" in his enormous production, or even because of his ability to find his way through them, that he has created a new visual language... The important thing for him psychologically is to seize from production his necessary salvation. But the important thing historically is that by inventing a new form to answer our need of a schema, he has freed himself from the weight of a no longer valid tradition. It was only an artist of the Romantic type who could achieve this, for he is the inventor, the pathfinder. Picasso has left an unusually complete record of the course of modern art along with his own career. We can follow the changes of the past fifty years through his work, starting with the worn sentimentalities of his fin-de-siecle Blue Period. His paintings of the Saltimbanques are likewise tender, sensitively drawn, the shabby pathos of their personal lives revealed. They are individualized in the highest degree: the nineteenth-century brand of romanticism. The step to the intellectual basis of Analytical Cubism indicates the revolution of thought separating the nineteenth from the twentieth century. But Analytical Cubism was also primarily representational. In disciplined objectivity, in pre- 2 Ibid. 3Clement Greenberg in Partisan Review, June 1948.</page><page sequence="4">PICASSO AT ANTIBES 481 ferring the whole to the part, the picture to the subject, the prototype to the individual lies the new point of view. The "Pierrot" which hangs in the Solomon R. Guggenheim Museum, is no longer the artist's personal interpolation: its entity has been broken into subtly varied, tilted facets which advance and re- cede, are modulated, interplaying: until the subject is finally known only through the vestigial mandolin. From this period dates the double profile, a need to re- tain the wholeness of the object, unaffected by specific circumstance and time of day. The chilling of the object by these intellectual preoccupations, another characteristic of the period, was a necessary extreme in turning away from sub- jective emotion, the self's particular prejudices. Cubism was an effort toward a classical art. But the release from representation was not complete until the emergence of Synthetic Cubism, which made of the work of art an act of total creation- which is to say, a freedom to create no longer following the specific laws of nature, but according organic growth to art itself. The spatial findings of the collages and the Synthetic period were disciplinary means by which Picasso's romanticism is concentrated. Together with decorative still-lifes in the irre- sponsible spirit of the twenties, we have also the obvious symbol of the masked Harlequin and Pierrot, foolish companions of our festivities. In the thirties, Picasso carried the possibilities of this rigid new aesthetic back to direct con- tact with the outside world. In the calligraphic Minotaur series, and in "L'Homme a la Sucette," as an example of another series, he gave us a particu- larly repellent image of humanity. Thus he combined an extreme awareness of the outside world with memories, both personal and collective, to present the forces of evil in a new vision. Again, the still-lifes of the war years are austere. At Antibes, the exhilaration of the Liberation bursts upon us, a return to the personal life of pleasure after the starkness of war. Technically there is no break, but an ease of performance and a freedom of movement that we have scarcely seen before. At the highest intensity of the imagination, the outer world is transformed into a pictorial reality, composed within the strict discipline dis- covered in Cubism. With the symbol of faun and satyr, Picasso engages us in a bacchanal. In his "Pastoral," a naked ballerina dances on the beach, with the instinctive will to dance before ritual was invented for the Dionysian festival. Her arms reach into a spacious sky, where music from Pan-pipes is released; she is accompanied by smiling, four-footed creatures, part wild, part gleeful. A sturdy sailboat is suspended on the horizon. Out of antiquity Picasso has seized on an iconography that is still familiar to us. There are many inter-relationships between art and history. He has himself said that there is no past or future to art, for the artist in creating has done with time: he is compelled to stand outside it, to be rid of superficial reality. What Picasso brings us in these Antibes pictures is a breath of an earlier pan- theistic world, when nature was closer and more mysterious, and the demarca- tion between man and the other creatures less strict. To accept this fantasy as anything but frivolous, it is necessary for us, spectators, to step back from time also. Otherwise, from the standpoint of our inter-war anxiety, the dolce far</page><page sequence="5">482 CAROL HAMILTON niente may seem like a waste of precious time, and our own uneasy love ex- periences (as psychologists have told us) of no measure to the elemental force of this ecstasy. There is another message we may read in symbol here: that we are in fact less distant from that natural world than we are accustomed to believe in our steel and concrete cities. With all our scientific knowledge we do not know why the sun must shine nor the seed germinate; nor can we control the workings of our own mind, though more conscious of its working than ever before. The individual subconscious re-enacts the practices of an earlier man; the invented symbols of our dreams are the same which the Greeks objectified. The faun and satyr are still our own. The fact that these figures of Picasso's remind us repeatedly of the black figures on the red earthen pots of the archaic Greeks implies a spiritual kinship which more recent tradition has not supplied. Picasso turned to the Greece of pre-history, not in nostalgia for a more "natural" world: but a return to a more immediate participation in the natural world. Picasso believes in the objective world, and in man: a man quite distinct from that inheritor of the earth, who was the hope of the Enlightenment and the hero of the nineteenth century. In the thirties Picasso saw man as minuscule and degraded, as the Existentialists did. Now, with more faith in the beneficence of the natural world, he finds in man a new kinship with the divine-a likeness to the woodland gods, who have a greater possibility of being known than those gods at the heart center of the universe. If Picasso finds man's reflection in nature, in the best romantic tradition, it is not the image raised to a higher power, for we have grown out of the habit of the sublime. At Antibes, he brings us a new dimension of man which demands an immediate metamorphosis of the heart: the demand for laughter. There is the sailboat on the cerulean brilliant sea; there is the goat, the olive grove, the beach. His own love life, with tongue in cheek, is magicked into the ancient fable when the gods forsook Mt. Olympus for the livelier pleasures of mortal life. So the girl languidly watches her shaggy-bearded lover sleep; or again, curled on the sand, she sleeps while he with humor watches over her. On another wall is a large triptych: black drawn on white on the white wall, (and the white curtain next to the picture is bellied out by the sea wind off Antibes): the satyr with his trident; a dancing, happy faun; another faun playing pan- pipes. Nearby the girl dances on the beach, her hair and breasts buoyant against the background of that ancient sea: while her goat-legged lord by her side holds their child on his shoulders. In these pictures a poetic reality moves; Picasso has invented; he makes be- lieve; his certainty persuades us that the individual life has absolute importance. The pleasure principle has been released from guilt. A fantasia has been created, and if the language were not of primordial simplicity it would be a false inno- cence (as in movie versions of fairy-land). He has utilized the old myth for the certain metamorphosis he means: a conciliation with mysterious nature, but still buoyed by the spirit of merriment that should be less foreign to us. Now the still-lifes and the fisher pictures at Antibes take on another meaning.</page><page sequence="6">PICASSO AT ANTIBES 483 We catch Picasso's urgency to construct out of whatever elements are at hand. Once he made an ox-skull out of a bicycle seat and handle-bars. Here are the hazy brightness of the Mediterranean light, the creatures from land and sea: shellfish and serpentine eel, flow of fish form, bird-flight. The forms are im- mersed in light, stand out solid and actual in a brighter than natural ambience. Thus in the "Owl Perched on a Chair with Sea-anemones" and the "Still-Life with Lemon, Fish and Sea-anemones"-through the simplification of form, the radiance of color, the bold tension of the composition, the creatures have been recreated within the elements of their being. The owl stares down our super-consciousness; the bristling sea-anemones, far from resembling pin- cushions, emerge into life close to its beginnings. There is a close rapport between the paintings and the ceramics. The pictures are lucid and compact; their reflections suggest the glaze of pottery. The ab- stract forms of the ceramics naturally suggest a further metamorphosis: one pitcher is at the same time an abstraction of bird-form; another, like the Greek vases, has the seated goat-legged figure playing reed-pipes; the roundness of plates repeatedly takes on the traditional symbol of the human face. There are a hundred variations. The intention is only also ornamental; zoomorphic and anthropomorphic shapes are at once conceptual and practical. Picasso achieves a poetic metaphor which we may use to read back the real world. He touches on the multiplicity of creation, likens dissimilar forms, breaks down old classifications with shimmering new relationships. It is not his inten- tion to dispose logically of the welter of experience which one man encounters in his lifetime, nor to assume a godlike position of judgment-but, given this world, to make a new semblance of order, according to his personal vision, which he succeeds in making ours. He has suggested fleeting connections between our presently experienced world, with an intuition of the long-ago which lingers in the elemental self and in the collective subconscious. One of the basic motifs of the subconscious is space, and man's relation to it. In philosophic terms, this is the obsessive question where are we?-an effort to adapt ourselves to our strange destiny. The pre-occupation with space is a constant in art. To the Greeks it was a concrete conception, as the limiting forms of their architecture make clear, fitted to man's measure. To the Byzantine world, space had little meaning, for the spiritual concern-man's union with God-was all-important. To the Renaissance, space was a definite area, as within an amphitheater, or held safely inside a cyclorama, within which the picture was composed. If it has assumed importance today all over again, it is because we are trying to orient ourselves in a scientific space concept that has suddenly changed: we have pushed beyond the encompassing sky, and have no limit or boundary as we look out of our human world. We are trying to find a new proportion. (The Existential idea of the Absurd enters here, with the juxtaposition of two realities which are with- out proportion between them. Again the Surrealists have illustrated our anxiety over the too-large and the too-small.) Technically this new conception of space is what led Picasso with the others- Braque, L6ger, Gris-to the creation of the first school of painting since the</page><page sequence="7">484 CAROL HAMILTON Renaissance: through the liquidation of the illusion of deep space on the canvas, at the same time that both the third and fourth dimensions are alluded to on the flat surface. "Cubism has kept within the limits and limitations of painting, never pre- tending to go beyond it," Picasso has said. The honest conviction that the flat surface must not be disturbed was the technical foundation of the new aesthetic. Although the austere training period of Cubism is a long way behind him now, Picasso has never departed from its principles since the second half of the "Demoiselles d'Avignon." Even in his "classic" drawings, if we look again we see that the foreground and the background are ambiguous, at times inter- changeable, making the image seem to come forward: in a way that was only made possible by the invention of Synthetic Cubism. This principle is clearly revealed over and over by the collages: as in Ivory Coast masks, where the deep-set eye is represented by a round, protruding form, the hole in the mandolin is raised. Now Picasso can manipulate the particular form to suit his need: but he has never betrayed this aesthetic. As an intellectual entrance to art, Cubism was appropriate to the twentieth century bred on scientific logic, and demanding to understand before it would accept. A Cubist painting could always be explained: the distortions were never arbitrary, nor the simplifications of a child mind as the public sometimes thought. It was the abstracting (to use the word in the slightly different sense of the verb, which also implies simplification) of visual sensations, which are different for us today than for any of our pasts. Again it was rooted in that desire to find the essential reality of the object, passing through the many facets of its seemingness. "The object becomes an event spread out in space-time. If it is to be located at any place, it is located at the point of intersection of all its appearances."4 Here is proof of Picasso's belief in the objective world. To the spectator this is solid ground: in fact a return from the dissolution of the objective world into broken light and dust motes, which the Impressionists achieved in the last flash of the Renaissance tradition. They too were trying to find the "real" world, as all art is concerned with doing, but they had left out man altogether; his existence became as evanescent as the fluttering veils of the women they painted. Picasso's means are Cubist. His line, on which rests his great reputation of calligrapher, is something new in the history of art. It is posed against the surface of the picture and uniquely penetrates at times-at times rides on top of all the forms. Even its variability and erasures integrate themselves into the work. In fact in his most traditional appearing pictures, as in the perfect neo- classic harmony of the Antibes "Still-Life with Fish and Coffee-Pot," it is mainly this line which builds up the architectonic forms. In a painting such as the "Reclining Woman" at Antibes, where the wood on which the picture is painted is the actual, untouched background, the line is again evident: in its spaces the figure must come forward, turn and reveal itself in all its dimensions to the spectator. The fauns of the "Triptych" are not silhouettes, the black single line drawn on white; the "Reclining Woman" is not flattened. A new perspective 4Charles Gauss, The Aesthetic Theories of French Artists, Johns Hopkins Press, 1949.</page><page sequence="8">PICASSO AT ANTIBES 485 has been given a reciprocal quality, and the image seems at once to recede and to advance as the eye follows the composition of the pictorial spaces and shapes and tones. Technically this is not a tour de force, but a method that works subtly as we accept the result. The bounding line of the fauns, the modeling of the abstracted woman, make the figures seem to hover on the surface. At the same time we are impressed with their solidity and their activity. And the image exists in the two dimensions of painting. The spectator steps before the canvas when the artist has laid down his brushes, and he is confronted by the framed view of the world which is the artist's as he looks out of his particular window. Bosch had seen a vision of hell; Raphael, of peace on earth. What united them in a single tradition was the Renaissance idea of space (rare among the arts that history has known)-where ideally disposed figures exist in an amphitheater of finite space. Now the ideal of visually apprehended space is no longer adequate to our further experience. The painters, who today work forward from that obliteration of the third dimension that began with Cubism, expose the structure of reality-as their art approaches, but always remains this side of, abstraction. The object is presented in a kind of life cycle: the moving path of the object in its life in space. The window is still open (except for the Non-objectivists, who depend entirely on artificial il- lumination) but the scene is one of stress and movement, of change and tension, and occasionally of violence. Modern art is the antithesis of Classical art, such as we know it from the Greeks and from the Renaissance: which is an art of completeness, immobility, of peace. Though we are aware of our inability at this time to create a Classical art, our art can assume certain qualities of the Classical, insofar as it is lucid and serious: for it is the business of all art to deal with the same basic question, and on its success depends our satisfaction or our dissatisfaction. We are no longer limited by Truth, as even the Greeks were limited. No single Universal is to be found under the particularities of our lived reality, but the possibility of many truths-as varied as the individuals or the epochs which can put order there. The question that is asked of the visual arts is the where of our existence; while poetry has always answered the what, and philosophy and religion the why; and music represents the journey of having been into becoming. Of these the visual arts are the closest to the physical world, the least abstract, for the painting is also an object, and the raw material from which it was made is everything seen from the window, but which is also touched and felt, and- insofar as can be-known. The delight which Picasso presents in his Antibes pictures is for those moments of our life which we can name for happiness, linking us to the woodland gods and speaking with certainty of the value of our individual existence. His work takes its emotion from the content, and from the freedom to draw new relation- ships between the world of nature and the order of the pictorial area, rendered into an enduring, impersonal expression. In the other, in the form, which is the form of our where in space as he has seen it from his particular window sub specie aeternitatis, lies that revealed reality, which belongs to us today in spite of our hesitation in accepting it, and also by which we shall be known.</page></plain_text>
