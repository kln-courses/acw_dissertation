Holmes Department of Zoology, University of Oxford, South Parks Road, Oxford OX1 3PS, United Kingdom KEYWORDS: virus-host interactions, lentivirus evolution, natural selection, HIV Abstract The human immunodeficiency viruses, HIV- 1 and HIV-2, are members of a group of closely related viruses found in a number of different African primate species. More distantly related lentiviruses are found in several different mam- malian orders. All are associated with long-term infections, but the outcome of infection ranges from a complete absence of symptoms to a rapidly devel- oping immunodeficiency and death. While HIV-2 is probably directly related to a virus that is responsible for an asymptomatic infection in the Sooty Mangabey, no obvious candidate for the progenitor of HIV- 1 has yet been found. Substantial genetic diversity is present in all immunodeficiency viruses, and phylogenetic analysis of HIV- 1 sequences obtained from a wide range of geographic locations has revealed 5-7 groups of viral strains, all equally distant from each other. All groups have been found in Africa, but their distribution elsewhere reflects chance links between individuals at high risk of infection. In some areas large epidemics have spread through groups of such individuals to infect thousands within a few months, resulting in an increase in the global frequency of the particular strain responsible, without the occurrence of any significant diversification. In contrast, within infected patients, substantial 127 0066-4162/92/1 120-0127$05.00</page><page sequence="2">128 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES diversity is developed over the period of the infection, especially in regions of the envelope gene which are targets for immune recognition (frequency-de- pendent selection). However, this diversity appears to be reduced at transmis- sion (stabilizing selection). Analysis of these different evolutionary forces gives insights into the development of drug resistance and to potentially pro- tective immune responses which are of practical value, while providing novel observations on molecular evolution in real time. INTRODUCTION-THE HIV PANDEMIC By 1993 over 600,000 cases of AIDS had been diagnosed worldwide (175), and taking into account the incubation time of the disease and the probable extent of underreporting, it has been estimated that more than 10 million people could now be infected with HIV (21). These numbers are expected to continue to rise in the future, with a huge consequential cost in human suffering, serious economic loss, and even population decline in some nations in Africa (7). This situation is exacerbated by the fact that there is no agreed-upon view of how HIV causes AIDS despite the wealth of theories put forward (reviewed in 168), nor is there an effective vaccine available. Recently the long-term efficacy of AZT, the main antiviral drug in use against HIV, has also been questioned (1). The international effort to develop effective vaccines and antiviral drugs is faced with a major problem in the sequence diversity exhibited by HIV both within and between infected individuals. This variation is a prominent feature of immunodeficiency viruses such as HIV and has been associated with the long-term maintenance of an infection in the presence of an active immune response, as well as with adaptation to a variety of cell types. A central task for biologists is therefore to understand the origin and maintenance of this variation. In particular, the analysis of HIV sequence data presents challenges for evolutionary biologists; methods of molecular evolutionary analysis, such as the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees and the estimation of the rates of nucleotide substitution, are an important means by which the origin of the virus and its interaction with the immune system can be understood. In this respect, HIV presents unique opportunities for the study of molecular evolution and also serves to illustrate the potential value of evolutionary methodology in providing an insight into the nature of infectious disease. THE ORIGINS OF HIV Introduction The identification of a retrovirus as the etiological agent of AIDS within three years of the description of the disease was a major triumph of modem medical</page><page sequence="3">EVOLUTION OF HIV 129 science (13). Like all retroviruses, HIV possesses a relatively simple structure consisting of two identical positive-sense single-stranded RNA molecules sur- rounded by a protein core, itself surrounded by a glycoprotein membrane (171). The RNA genome contains the three genes typical of retroviruses: the gag gene encoding the structural proteins of the viral core, comprising the matrix protein p17 (MA in the standardized retroviral terminology-98), the capsid protein p24 (CA) and the nucleocapsid proteins p6/p7 (NC); the pol gene which encodes the viral enzymes, the protease (PR) and the reverse transcriptase (RT), the structures of which have both been solved (85, 91) and the integrase (IN); and the env gene encoding gpl2O, the surface (SU), and gp4l, the transmembrane (TM) envelope glycoproteins. HIV is also typical of retro- viruses in its life-cycle, the most distinctive part of which is the production, by the viral enzyme reverse transcriptase, of a DNA copy of the RNA genome when the free virus enters a host cell (161). This DNA copy differs from the RNA template in that it possesses long terminal repeat (LTR) sequences at each end of the genome, which are produced during reverse transcription (162). The DNA copy of the virus is then integrated into the host genome where it resides as a provirus and is replicated, along with the host genome, by the cellular enzymes DNA polymerase I and RNA polymerase II. The latter en- zyme transcribes the proviral HIV genome to generate viral mRNAs and the full-length genomic RNA molecule. However, the structure of HIV differs dramatically from the C-type, or oncogenic retroviruses such as the ecotropic MLV and FeLV Type A (171) and the human T cell leukemia viruses (51). Most notably, the genome is substantially larger-about 9.5 kb vs about 7 kb for the C-type retroviruses of most animals. The additional length of HIV is associated with longer coding sequences, especially for env, and with a novel set of small regulatory genes, now known as tat, rev, nef; vpu, and vif (reviewed in 160). Of these new genes, specific functions have been assigned to the first two. The tat protein is responsible for activation of gene expression by interacting with a specific sequence (the TAR element) in the R region of the 5' LTR, which is included in the transcript. Extensive investigations of its mode of action appear to indicate that TAT acts by binding to a sequence at the side of the loop formed by the TAR element in the newly transcribed mRNA and interacting with a cellular protein that appears to bind to the tip of the TAR loop to increase the rate of transcription (27, 28). The REV protein is responsible for determining the fate of transcripts; specifically, whether they enter the splicing pathway (the default mode) or whether they are protected from the nuclear processing machinery and exported into the cytoplasm as full-length genomic transcripts ready for packaging into viral particles. Again it is dependent on the presence of a specific sequence in the transcript-the REV response element (RRE), located at the 3' end of the env gene (64). The presence of these regulatory</page><page sequence="4">130 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES proteins, along with the large variety of RNA transcripts that HIV produces and the ability to regulate its own gene expression, has been held to be adaptive in that it permits a flexible response to the cellular environment (116) and allows the infective state to be prolonged. Most recently it has been suggested that the nef gene may have the function of downregulating the cellular CD4 protein (63). Downregulation of their receptor is frequently observed in animal retroviruses, but the precise reason is not known. Although HIV appeared to be significantly different from the C-type retro- viruses found in other vertebrates, it shared certain features with visna, a virus associated with an epidemic of a wasting syndrome in Icelandic sheep in the late 1940s (147, 158) and a related virus found in goats (caprine arthritis-en- cephalitis virus, CAEV). Another virus which establishes a persistent cyclical infection, equine infectious anemia virus (EIAV) (17), had been linked with visna virus in a group known as the lentiviruses, to indicate their association with slowly progressive diseases. However, not until the identification of a second and clearly very distinct virus associated with AIDS in humans, HIV-2 (60), was it recognized that this was a major group of viruses with distinct properties. The widespread nature of the lentiviruses among mammalian orders was confirmed by the publication in 1985 of news that rhesus monkeys in US primate colonies showing an AIDS-like disease were infected with a similar virus (30), and by the discovery of related viruses in domestic cats (feline immunodeficiency virus, FIV-122) and in the cow (bovine immunodefici- ency-like virus, BIV-57, 58). Whereas HIV, SIV in macaques, and FIV in domestic cats are associated with symptomatic, if chronic, infections, other viruses clearly related to HIV have now been discovered in a wide variety of different primates, where symptomatic infection appears to be the exception rather than the rule. In addition, antibodies that cross-react with FIV have been found in wild felid species worldwide, such as East African lions and Serengeti cheetahs, and related viruses have been isolated from North American pumas (123) with no associated pathological symptoms. Similarly, a number of different primate species are known to be infected with apparently species-specific immuno- deficiency viruses. These viruses have been the subject of detailed phyloge- netic studies which have clarified some important elements of their evolu- tionary history. Primate Immunodeficiency Viruses Although the first nonhuman primate in which an immunodeficiency virus was discovered was the rhesus macaque (Macaca mulatta; SIVmac) (18), immuno- deficiency viruses have so far been found to be endemic only in African cercopithecids. The monkey species infected include the sooty mangabey</page><page sequence="5">EVOLUTION OF HIV 131 Mandrill 100 HIV-I subtype 'O' Chimpanzee 100 HIV- I subtype 'A' 1(H) r HIV- I subtype 'D' 1 HIV- I subtype 'B' I~~~~~~~~ _0 Atfrican Grccn Monkcys Syk 's Monkey 99 M;;Macaqu 99 )') t Sooty Mangabcy HIV-2 subtypc 'A' I ()( I I |HIV-2 subtypc 'B' I()(X Dix ereence Figure 1 Phylogenetic tree of primate immunodeficiency viruses based on analysis of 2613 nucleotide sites in the pol gene.

The five main lineages described to date are indicated by the brackets on the right.

The last includes a cluster of closely related species, each with an apparently specific viral form, which are discussed in more detail below. Phylogenetic analyses of these viruses, carried out using the nucleotide sequences of the relatively conserved gag and pol genes, have shown how the SIVs and HIVs are related (Figure 1). Remarkably, HIV-1 and the viruses</page><page sequence="6">132 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES from each of the four monkey species appear to be approximately equally distantly related to each other whatever method is used in the analyses. HIV-2, however, was found to be closely related to the immunodeficiency virus found in the rhesus macaque (18) and the sooty mangabey (68). SIVmac was isolated from captive rhesus monkeys in US primate centers in 1986 (18), but it was soon found that wild, Asian, rhesus macaques were not infected with the virus (35). Similar studies in wild-caught African primates in 1988 led to-the dis- covery of the closely related virus SIVsm (68). Both monkeys were held in the same primate centers at the same time. Experiments have now shown that SIV from a sooty mangabey, which causes no disease in that species, will infect a rhesus macaque and often cause an AIDS-like disease, killing the animal within about 18 months (35). Epidemics of such diseases were recorded among macaques from some primate centers in the early 1980s (77, 99). The likely explanation is therefore that a transspecific infection occurred from a wild-de- rived sooty mangabey which then spread among captive macaques. This leaves the question as to how HIV-2 comes to be so closely related. The answer is probably, also by a transspecific infection from the sooty mangabey. The evidence for this was initially circumstantial but suggestive. HIV-2 is the form of the virus found in West Africa and in people with West African connections. Sooty mangabeys are a West African species and are often found in close contact with humans, frequently being kept as pets. Bites from such animals are known to transmit viral infections, and this may be the main route of transmission among monkeys (M Gardner, personal communi- cation). A recent detailed phylogenetic analysis of HIV-2 isolates from resi- dents of rural Liberia has revealed sequences in infected humans that are more closely related to SIVsm than to other HIV-2 sequences (52). In the light of these observations, the simplest interpretation is that zoonotic transmissions occur continually at a low rate but are self-limiting. The reasons for the spread of one viral strain following the transspecific infection may relate to the epidemiological circumstances of the infected population, or possibly to some properties of that particular virus. However, it is not possible to link HIV-2 with any particular known variant of SIVsm, and indeed, other HIV-2 isolates that are equally distinct have been described by other groups (39, 88, 89). Where Did HIV-1 Come From? The development of a plausible hypothesis to account for many features concerning the origin of the HIV-2 epidemic associated with West Africa has, however, contributed little to our understanding of the source of the global pandemic of HIV-1. The most direct evidence relating to the origin of HIV-1 came from the discovery of that 2 out of 83 wild-caught chimpanzees from Gabon carried antibodies that cross-reacted with HIV-1 (74). From one of</page><page sequence="7">EVOLUTION OF HIV 133 these a distinct immunodeficiency virus was isolated that when sequenced grouped specifically with HIV-1. The distribution of this virus among wild chimpanzee populations is poorly known, and the infection appears to be very rare; only one other virus has been isolated from this source. Recently, how- ever, some very distinct isolates of "HIV-1" have been obtained from the Cameroon (32). Provisional analysis indicates that these may be more diver- gent from other HIV-i s than SIVCPZ (1 16). Although contacts between humans and chimpanzees cannot therefore be ruled out as an hypothesis for the origin of HIV-1, along the lines proposed for HIV-2 and sooty mangabeys, the evidence is considerably weaker. A more distant origin of HIV-1 has been proposed as a branch of the SIVagm group (50). Phylogenetic analyses of the most complete dataset available at the time of writing show that whereas different SIVsm sequences, like the different HIV- 1 s, cluster closely together on a tree of all primate immunodefici- ency viruses, SIVs from the African green monkey differ very substantially from each other and are separated on the tree by relatively long branches, as can be seen in Figure 1. The African green monkey represents a "superspecies" made up of at least four geographically isolated species: green monkeys (Cercopithecus sabaeus) from West Africa, grivets (C. aethiops) from the Horn of Africa, Ethiopia, and the Sudan, the tantalus monkey (C. tantalus) which is found in a belt extending across Africa from Uganda to Nigeria, and the vervets (C. pygerythrus) found over a wide range from Ethiopia southwards and extending throughout south- ern Africa and Angola. Each of the last three species is represented by more than one subspecies; over 10 are listed in the case of the vervet. The diversity shown by the SIVs from the superspecies as a whole (4, 10, 50, 81) led to suggestions that somewhere among the group a virus would be found that grouped with HIV-1. Instead, more recent analyses suggest that the diversity reflects phylogenetic relationships with the superspecies (4). An attempt is being made to test this hypothesis by investigating the molecular phylogenetics of green monkey mtDNA sequences (J Goudsmit, personal communication), and it will be interesting to learn more of the relationships among the group. As approximately 30% (or more) of indigenous African green monkeys are seropositive for SIV (121), it appears this virus has a long history in these species. While we cannot at present identify a particular nonhuman primate origin for HIV-1, it may lie among other species of the genus Cercopithecus, several more of which have antibodies that cross-react with SIVagm (82). The Age of HIV A number of molecular evolutionary investigations have attempted to estimate how long immunodeficiency viruses have been associated with human popu-</page><page sequence="8">134 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES lations. The basis for such attempts was, in several cases, the assumption that HIV sequence divergence is a continuing process and that the evolutionary divergence (i.e. number of nucleotide substitutions) between two strains iso- lated at different times can be used to estimate the rate of evolution. The likely time of origin is then inferred by extrapolation, and in several cases this was taken as the divergence of HIV-1 and -2. However, we have seen above that this is not relevant to the origin of HIV because it is now clear that the common ancestor of the two human viruses is to be found in a nonhuman primate. The divergence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 in fact appears to be close to the earliest node in primate lentiviral evolution (39). Secondly, the dating procedure itself is highly suspect, as it is often assumed that HIV-1 followed a "progressive" or stem-like pattern, similar to that of influenza (15). In fact, the accumulation of sequence information on HIV-1 from different parts of the world and particularly Africa has shown that HIV-1 has undergone successive "star-like" radiations, with from five to seven distinct and equally distantly related groups detectable (see Global Variation of HIV- 1). Such a lack of structure within the tree invalidates the assumptions being made in some dating procedures. Furthermore, in more than one case, the analysis was also confounded by comparing sequences from different branches of the radiation. Finally, the occurrence of multiple substitutions at single nucleotide sites and especially the preponderance of G to A transitions (see The Evolution of HIV Within an Individual), means that all approaches to inferring the time of origin for such highly divergent viruses are likely to be speculative, particularly when based on procedures, such as parsimony, which do not adequately correct for multiple nucleotide changes and differences in rates of evolution between lineages (150). The inherent difficulties in dating are indicated by the range of estimates obtained, from as little as forty to several thousand years for the divergence of HIV-1 and HIV-2 (100, 143, 150, 176). Examination of the primate immunodeficiency tree (Figure 1) reveals an intriguing feature. All the major lineages of primate lentivirus appear to be related to each other by approximately equal distances. Similarly, the lenti- viruses from different orders of mammals also appear to be related by approx- imately equal distances (57). Such observations have led to the radically different suggestion that immunodeficiency viruses have been present in mam- mals for millions of years and co-evolved with their hosts. The current picture of evolution of SIVagm viruses described above is certainly in line with this, but there appears to be some difficulty in reconciling such a process with direct observations made on HIV sequence change within individual patients and infected communities (see below). Estimates of the error rate of HIV reverse transcriptase are on the order of 104 per site, per round of replication (136). We propose an alternative explanation which resolves these difficulties later in this chapter.</page><page sequence="9">EVOLUTION OF HIV 135 The Evolution of Virulence in Immunodeficiency Viruses An important question arising from the comparison of primate lentiviruses outlined above is the mechanism by which viral adaptation to the host species evolves in the primate lentiviruses. Of particular interest in this respect is HIV-2, which has been associated with a lower pathogenicity than HIV-1. It is instructive in this case to refer to theoretical studies of host-parasite rela- tionships. A commonly cited theory is that virulence is due to an unnatural relationship between virus and host, such as that caused by a transspecific infection, and that because infections often appear to be less virulent in their natural hosts, viruses should evolve to a state of avirulence. This view was based on the idea that viruses that inhabit their hosts for the greatest time are the most successful and that the death of host means the death of the virus. However, this is a rather anthropomorphic view of viral evolution. The important parameter is not the duration of infection or even host mortality but rather the effective reproductive rate, Re, defined as the average number of new infections generated by one infectious individual. Thus, a virus with a higher Re will pass more of its progeny to future generations and consequently Re should be maximized in evolution (6). Consequently it has been predicted that viruses with the highest probability of transmission will be those with intermediate rates of growth and levels of virulence. This evolutionary trade- off between host mortality and transmission probability is best illustrated in the natural "experiment" of myxoma virus released into wild rabbit populations in Australia and Europe. Here strains of intermediate fitness attained the highest frequency in the population; very virulent myxoma strains kill their hosts early and are consequently transmitted at lower rates between hosts than are strains of lower virulence (44, 45). In contrast, benign strains are cleared by the host immune system before they are transmitted. It is unlikely that similar selective forces are the explanation for the apparent reduction in pathogenicity in HIV-2 as no one has claimed to have found evidence of the required dramatic decline in human population numbers, as was pointed out earlier (96). In contrast, the lower pathogenicity of HIV-2 may be due to functional differences. For example, the fact that the external glycoprotein of HIV-2 does not bind to the CD4 receptor with such high affinity as do many strains of HIV-1 could explain the lower pathogenicity; i.e. it could be due to incomplete adaptation to the host (79, 102, 113). A recent analysis of rates of amino acid change in viruses with different pathogenicities (51) found that rates of amino acid change were two to three times higher in HIV-1 and SIVmac (both pathogenic) than in the minimally pathogenic SIVagm and SIVSm viruses, as well as HIV-2, considered to be of intermediate pathogenicity. More specifically, a positive correlation was proposed between viral pathogenicity and the immunogenicity of the env</page><page sequence="10">136 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES (and particularly the surface glycoprotein gpl2O) and gag proteins. This suggests that whereas a weak immune response is able to "contain" the infection in African green monkeys and sooty mangabeys, a stronger immune response does not contain the infections in humans (with HIV-1) and macaques. It is therefore tempting to think that some SIV strains are inherently less virulent viruses. On the other hand, SIVmac originated almost certainly from the transspecific infection of a rhesus macaque with SIVsm(35). Either SIVSm was inherently more pathogenic in the new host, a common occurrence among viruses (e.g. myxomatosis passing between rabbits of the genus Sylvilagus and Oryctolagu-44, 45), or more virulent variants were rapidly selected for as the virus passed from a "SIV-saturated" population into a "SIV-naive" one. It is interesting to note the presence of extreme variation in virulence within SIVsm, represented by the strain SIVpBj14 (iso- lated from a pigtail macaque infected with a standard strain of SIVsm) that kills macaques within days of infection. A limited number of nucleotide substitutions distinguish the lethal variant and the parent strain, and most of these have been found in the env gene (26). Studies in areas of West Africa where HIV-2 is widespread and where HIV- 1 has only recently entered the population have confirmed that progression to AIDS is significantly slower in HIV-2 infected patients, and that HIV-2 is much less easily transmitted (8). The frequency of mother-child transmission is about 10- to 20-fold higher in HIV-1 -infected than HIV-2-infected mothers (43). Thus it is now clear that the two human immunodeficiency viruses differ fundamentally in virulence. Nevertheless, given the high mutation rate of HIV-1, it is likely that strains of low virulence currently exist. The study of individuals who possess these viruses, perhaps "long-term survivors" of HIV infection, is likely to be an important part of future HIV research. However, it is important to distinguish differences due to the viral strain from those due to host factors such as age (31) and HLA haplotype (153). MOLECULAR EPIDEMIOLOGY OF HIV-1 Global Variation of HIV-I As the first sequences of African isolates of HIV-1 were made available, it became clear that there was greater diversity among them than among those obtained from infected individuals in North America and Europe (3, 116). For this reason a simple African/Non-African subdivision is not sufficient to ex- plain the worldwide diversity of HIV-1. Recent world-wide surveys of HIV-1 sequences have revealed a global pattern of geographical variation that is extremely complex. From an analysis of complete gag and env sequences, Myers et al (116) and</page><page sequence="11">EVOLUTION OF HIV 137 Louwagie et al (103) suggest that there are about seven approximately equi- distant subtypes of HIV-1. All seven subtypes have been found in Africa, but only a subset are present on each of the other continents. Subtype A is found in Central and West Africa and includes the well-characterized strains U455 (Uganda) and Z321 (Zaire). Subtype B is the predominant one found in North America and Europe and includes the first strain of HIV to be cultured, now known as HIVLAI (166). It appears to be present, but rare, in Central Africa. Although they are abundant in Brazil as well, some B subtype sequences there are quite distinct (132). Subtype C is found in South and Central Africa and recently has been found on the west coast of India, in Bombay and Goa, where it appears to have generated a major epidemic (36), while subtype D is found only in Central Africa. Subtype E was first found in the HIV epidemic in a northern part of Thailand among injecting drug users (107, 126), but related strains have since been identified from South and Central Africa. Whereas the grouping of viral strains into subtypes is, in general, similar whether sequences from the gag or env gene are used, the subtype E viruses have been found to group with A on the basis of the gag gene. A sixth subtype "F' ("E" in Louwagie et al- 103) has been identified which includes a second set of sequences described from Brazil (132), as well as a group from Romania (37) and Zaire. There are, in addition, sequences from Gabon that appear to fall into two more subtypes-G (which includes some more from Zaire) and H. Finally, at the time of writing, a last outlying sequence from Zaire may define a ninth subtype. In general, the gag- and env-based trees were highly congruent, with the exception of subtype E and a small number of D subtype viruses, including the Zairian isolate HIVMAL (3) whose gag gene sequence falls into subtype A. This suggests that recombination has occurred in the distant past in a patient infected with two divergent viruses. As well as this array of subtypes more or less equally distantly related, there are the sequences from the Cameroons that branch off outside SIV,PZ. Despite the fact that they have been assigned to a single subtype (referred to as "subtype 0"), they are quite distant from each other as well (116). WHAT CAN BE INFERRED FROM THE GLOBAL PAFfERN OF DIVERSITY? The HIV-1 subtypes differ at 10-13% of nucleotide sites and 20-25% of amino acids over the whole of env. This extent of diversity is not an inevitable consequence for an RNA virus. In particular, studies of the measles virus show that most of its genome is rather conserved, with six geographically distinct American strains isolated over a five year period, showing pairwise nucleotide distances of only 2.4% in the hemagglutinin protein gene (138), distances exceeded by HIV sequences found within a single patient. In an analysis of the VP1/2A region (222 bp/74 amino acids) of the genome from 59 strains of poliovirus type 1, another RNA virus, isolated over a 30-year period, Rico-</page><page sequence="12">138 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES Hesse et al (134) found that they differed on average by approximately 1 amino acid substitution only from the Sabin vaccine strain, but they did differ at a high proportion of their synonymous sites. The diversity we have described in HIV would not arise inevitably from the high mutation rate associated with an RNA genome; instead it reflects the sum total of the evolutionary forces acting on the virus. Several inferences about the evolutionary biology of HIV may be made from the information available about the distribution of the subtypes. First, different subtypes, which may differ substantially at the molecular level, can be found within the same geographical area, and especially in Central Africa. The fact that all the subtypes are found here, and that this therefore is the region of greatest genetic heterogeneity, may imply that the virus has existed here for the longest time. Secondly, the ability to partition the total spectrum of HIV diversity into a limited number of groups allows us to infer something about the spread of the virus. Eigen &amp; Nieselt-Struwe (39), who undertook a phylogenetic analysis of a number of different isolates of HIV, considered the virus to be an example of a "constrained pandemic" where only a few geno- types coexist both geographically and temporally. This situation was contrasted to a phylogenetic tree of variants of type 1 poliovirus, where most branches give rise to descendants and where many genotypes appear to coexist. How- ever, this interpretation of the phylogenetic tree structure in terms of epidemi- ological pattern was not based on an explicit evolutionary model. An alterna- tive hypothesis is that the present structure of the global HIV tree with the remarkable expansion of lineages in some countries that are rare in the parent continent (Africa) is an example of the founder effect on a large scale; i.e. is a consequence of sampling. The following three cases serve as examples. THAILAND The need for a precise description of the genetic diversity of HIV within infected communities is apparent in an analysis of HIV in Thailand, a country that had an exponential increase in the frequency of HIV infections among high risk groups in. the late 1980s and that is still experiencing a rapid increase in the number of infections. By mid-1991 approximately 0.5% of the population were estimated to be infected (107, 126). Two different subtypes (B and E) are present in this country; subtype E is predominant in North Thailand, while subtype B is the major one found in the central and southern regions, including Bangkok. No patients of dual infection have been found. Because of the very different global origins of the subtypes, it is likely that these viruses entered the Thai population independently. The two viruses are also associated with different risk groups: while 85% of the patients infected through sexual transmission possessed viruses of genotype E, only 24% of individuals infected through injecting drug use had viruses of this genotype. At present little is known of possible differences in efficiency of transmission</page><page sequence="13">EVOLUTION OF HIV 139 by different routes between the different subtypes, but it is equally likely that the split arises from links between risk groups in different communities and is a reflection of demographic factors instead. FINLAND A similar picture of very different subtypes of HIV within a single country is provided by Finland (140). Despite the much lower prevalence of HIV in this country (compared to Thailand) four and possibly even five subtypes of the virus have been found there. Interestingly, the sequences obtained from individuals infected in nearby Estonia constitute an extremely homogeneous monophyletic group, which may reflect the close epidemiolog- ical relationships of individuals in a country where very few cases of HIV infection have been reported. INDIA Recent studies of high-risk groups in Bombay and Goa, on the westem coast of the Indian subcontinent, have revealed another unexpected subtype. This recently infected group, in which HIV-1 is spreading rapidly, are infected with a strain belonging to subtype C. This was previously described from a single strain, HIVNOF, found in South Africa, and the subtype has also been found at a low frequency in Zambia. Unusually, there is also a high prevalence of HIV-2 infected individuals, and several dual infections have been observed (36). Other centers of infection now appear to exist in India, and preliminary results suggest that, as for Thailand, these are characterized by viruses of different subtypes. The exact routes by which such an unusual combination of HIV strains reached Bombay/Goa remain unknown, but there is a possible association with long-established trading routes across the Indian Ocean. In conclusion the pattern of distribution and the relative abundance of the different subtypes of HIV-1 appear to be primarily a consequence of demo- graphic processes within the human population. There are significant differ- ences in behavior, such as rates of sexual partner change, or frequency of sharing needles, which generate subpopulations that differ substantially with respect to their susceptibility to HIV infection (80). Studies of the dynamics of sexually transmitted diseases are now beginning to deal specifically with this issue (53). In our view these factors have had a major impact on the global distribution of the subtypes of HIV-1. The consequent level of variability means that any vaccine designed to eliminate a single specific strain may not be sufficient to protect all populations. Clearly a careful study of HIV diversity world-wide will be an important part of global intervention strategies. Evolution of HIV Within a Community The evolutionary analysis of HIV nucleotide sequence data can also provide information as to progression of the HIV epidemic within a single community. In particular, it is important to know how many HIV strains may have estab-</page><page sequence="14">140 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES lished the epidemic in a particular community, whether different risk (behav- ioral) groups possess characteristic strains, and how the distribution of these strains changes with time. Studies on genetic variation of HIV in clustered outbreaks, several of which were associated with exposure of a number of patients to a common source of virus, such as infected blood or blood product, have revealed that there can be substantial similarities even in highly variable regions of the env gene (11, 22, 108). Such cases are highly informative because differences in the course of the disease cannot be ascribed to variation in the infecting virus strain. In Edinburgh, a number of hemophiliac patients, who had never been treated with commercial factor VIII, were found to have become infected in 1984. Analysis of their records revealed that they shared exposure to a single common batch of factor VIII which had been prepared in Scotland from plasma donated locally at a time when HIV infection was extremely rare (104). Sequences taken from some of these patients close to the time of the infection showed almost no divergence between patients, consistent with the infecting virus having derived from a single infected patient (177). Balfe et al (11) were therefore able to compare the rate of viral sequence change between different infected patients and to show that both the diversity and the rate of change varied substantially (11). In general the greater the diversity in the population, the more rapid the progress of disease. In these patients the presence of one particular HLA haplotype, Al B8 DR3, was associated with rapid progression (153). Thus, host factors alone can be responsible for important differences in the infection and may also influence the development of diversity in the viral population. The earliest stages of an explosive HIV epidemic appear to resemble the pattern seen in infection from a point source such as this. It was seen in Thailand and India (Bombay/Goa) that even when there is no known direct link between infected individuals, transmission appears to occur so rapidly that the virus does not diverge between individuals. In both Thailand and India, despite the highly divergent genotype of the virus found, virtually no inter-pa- tient divergence was seen. HIV EVOLUTION IN EDINBURGH We have recently completed a detailed study of the molecular epidemiology of HIV- 1 within Edinburgh (70). Although all the viruses found could be assigned to subtype B, phylogenetic analysis of the p17 (MA) region of the gag gene strongly suggested that distinct HIV strains circulate in this community, with different risk groups (hemophiliacs, hetero- sexuals, and injecting drug users) characterized by distinct viral variants. Specifically, when we sequenced the virus from all available hemophiliac patients who had been exposed to the common batch and become infected, a total of 14 patients (104), distinct gag sequence variants were found (Figure</page><page sequence="15">* -&lt;----- HIVeli {l * * . r-* ** p80 &amp; p82 Heterosexual contact &amp; v Injecting rug Users _ _ *~p95.I Main Hemophiliac HC ~~Cohort 5% Divergence Figure 2 Neighbor-joining tree for 112 sequences of the MA (pl7) coding region of the gag gene from 25 Edinburgh patients infected by three different routes (70).

Patient Sc3 was infected by heterosexual contact.</page><page sequence="16">142 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES 2). Although the majority of patients still appear to have been infected by a single ("main") batch of factor VIII, one patient exposed to this batch (p82) became infected with a very different virus population. However, these se- quences were very similar to those observed in another patient (p80) who had never been exposed to the main batch. Clearly there must have been more than one infected batch of factor VIII in use in Edinburgh in 1984. Conversely, a single gag variant, different from those observed in the he- mophiliacs, was found in the infected injecting drug-user (IDU) population in Edinburgh. This suggests that the HIV epidemic in this group may have been founded by a single HIV strain, a conclusion that is compatible with the rapid spread of the virus in this population, similar to the epidemic in Thailand (137). Significantly, this variant was also found in individuals thought to be infected through heterosexual contact, which suggests that the heterosexual epidemic may have been established by descendants of the variant that earlier infected the intravenous drug users, and that the latter may form a bridge into the heterosexual community. The sequence of the pl7/MA coding region appeared to be diversifying as the epidemic progressed, because sequences obtained from individuals infected during the recent stages of the HIV epidemic are often quite distinct (that is, connected by long branches on the phylogenetic tree) from sequences obtained from individuals infected at earlier time points. In contrast, little time-depen- dent evolution appears in the V3 loop of the env gene, a region of great immunological importance (see Sequential Studies). Here similar (and some- times identical) sequences are found in unrelated individuals throughout the course of the epidemic, in marked contrast to the diversity in V3 often observed within individual patients (71). Studies on recent infections have suggested that only a subset of V3 sequences may be responsible for establishing many infections (84, 108, 173, 177, 179). As the V3 loop is likely to be an important component of any env-based vaccine, such a constraint against sequence change through time is a significant finding. A similar observation was made by Kuiken et al (90) who examined the evolution of V3 sequences in Amsterdam from 1980 to 1991. The consensus V3 loop amino acid sequence taken at seroconversion (or a time near to seroconversion) from 74 individuals did not change over the course of the epidemic, although there were changes in the residues flanking the V3 loop. Furthermore, no risk group-specific changes could be identified at the amino acid level, although injecting drug users could be differentiated from homo- sexuals/hemophiliacs by two particular synonymous nucleotide substitutions. HIV Forensics In recent years there has been considerable interest in the use of molecular sequence data as a means to assess the likelihood of HIV transmission between</page><page sequence="17">EVOLUTION OF HIV 143 infected individuals. While this subject, "HIV forensics," is still in its infancy, it shows a potentially important use of evolutionary methodology of HIV research. The most celebrated case began in 1990 when the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta received a report of AIDS in a young woman with no recognized risk factors (designated patient A). About 24 months before this diagnosis, however, she had two teeth extracted by a dentist suffering from AIDS. Subsequent investigations identified six more former patients of the dentist (patients B to G) who were HIV positive. To assess whether these patients were infected by the dentist, an analysis was made of their HIV sequences along with those of the dentist and 35 local controls (LCs) (125) (HIV infected individuals attending clinics within a 90 mile radius of the dental surgery). Three analyses were performed on a 350 bp long region from the env gene including the hypervariable V3 loop. The first involved a simple calculation of the genetic distances between all members of the study data set. An average distance of 4% (range 3.4 to 4.9%) was found between the dentist and five of the patients who were considered to have no behaviorial risk factors for HIV infection (patients A, B, C, E and G-now referred to as the "dental cohort"). These v-alues are within the range of known HIV transmissions from a point source, as described above and are close to the levels of variation observed within single patients. In contrast, the average distance to the dentist for the LCs and the two patients who did have behaviorial risk factors (patients D and F) was 11%. A similarly high distance was found between the dental patients and the local controls. The second piece of analysis involved the reconstruction of phylogenetic trees using the parsimony criterion. Although all the most parsimonious trees placed the dentist and the dental cohort closely together, it appeared that the grouping could not be supported by a "significant" number of bootstrap replications (only 79 out of 100 replications), although there is some debate as to at what level of support significance should be assigned (65). Finally, the authors performed a "signature pattern analysis" where eight (noncontiguous) amino acid residues common in the dentist's viral sequences, yet rare in the local control population, are used to constitute a signature sequence. The five dental cohort patients all had at least seven out of eight of these signature residues, whereas most of the local controls had only one or two of these residues (the maximum was five out of eight). This similarity in signatures was statistically significant. Since the case of the Florida dentist occurred, a number of other attempts have been made to trace the source of HIV infections by the evolutionary analysis of viral sequence data. In the first, a region of the pol gene was used as evidence in a Swedish court to uphold the conviction of an individual for rape who knowingly infected a female patient with HIV (2). The rapist and the victim could be distinguished from a background population by a five amino acid signature sequence as well as in a phylogenetic analysis.</page><page sequence="18">144 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES Another investigation involved an HIV-infected surgeon one of whose pa- tients was found, on recall, to be a previously unknown seropositive (72). Significantly, the patient had also received a blood transfusion and the donor of one unit of the transfused blood had recently been found to be HIV positive, although it was not known whether this applied at the time of the donation. Phylogenetic trees were constructed on sequence data obtained from p17/MA coding sequences PCR-amplified from cells of the patient, the donor and plasma from the surgeon, as well as from a background of mainly North American sequences. All trees depicted the donor to be the source of the HIV infection in the patient. Furthermore, the patient-donor grouping was found to be significantly more likely than the patient-surgeon grouping in a maximum likelihood significance test, indicating that it was highly unlikely that the surgeon was the source of the HIV infection in the patient. Although further cases are likely to arise in the future, a number of uncer- tainties still exist as to the strength of the conclusions that can be drawn on the basis of evolutionary analysis of viral sequence data. The key issues are the choice of a region of the HIV genome that best reflects evolutionary history and the accurate estimation of the probability that any sequence similarity observed is indicative of HIV transmission. These are obviously areas where the input from evolutionary biologists will be of great importance. EVOLUTION OF HIV WITHIN AN INDIVIDUAL The Quasispecies: Mutation and Selection For many years we have known that many RNA viruses cannot be considered solely in the traditional taxonomic way that is appropriate for DNA viruses: as being composed of a limited number of strains, defined serologically. For example, from the earliest studies of HIV sequence variation, substantial sequence evolution during the course of an HIV infection was found such that infected individuals harbor a large population of viruses that may differ in both sequence and biological characteristics (48, 61, 139, 152). Replication is an error-prone process in all retroviruses. These viruses are unusual because three enzymes are involved in replication: cellular DNA polymerase, cellular RNA polymerase, and the viral reverse transcriptase (24). Most studies of mutational frequency have concentrated on reverse trans- criptase, particularly because of the lack of proof-reading activity associated with this enzyme. With mutation rates of the order of 104 per base pair, per replication (136), a population of viruses such as HIV-1 (genome size 104 nucleotides) will contain very few identical genomes. A number of other mutational processes also appear to be important in the generation of sequence diversity in HIV. Hypermutation is a name given to</page><page sequence="19">EVOLUTION OF HIV 145 the process whereby monotonous base substitutions, usually involving G to A transitions, occur during a single replication cycle, presumably because of a property of a particular reverse transcriptase (128, 163). Although many of the mutations generated by hypermutation will lead to viruses with defective genomes, recombination, another major source of diversity in immunodefici- ency viruses (24), may lead to a proportion of these substitutions spreading through the viral population. It is also evident, however, that natural selection plays an important part in the evolution of HIV, and especially in changing the antigenic properties of the virus. The central observation in this respect from studies of other lenti- viruses is that serologically distinct viruses can be isolated later in the course of the infection that are not efficiently neutralized by the sera obtained shortly after inoculation, when the viruses are of the parental serotype (164). Thus, sequence variants can be serologically distinct from each other, and the dif- ferences between them have generally been localized to changes in the amino acid sequence of the envelope glycoprotein. In HIV, many amino acid substi- tutions have been observed in a putative loop structure within the third hyper- variable (V3) region of the major envelope glycoprotein gpl2O. This region is the major immunodominant neutralizing epitope of HIV (59, 180), and mutations here are neutralization "escape" mutants. Despite the requirement for variability, V3 loop sequences, and especially the central GPG tripeptide, are relatively well conserved (94, 116) and can elicit antibodies capable of neutralizing a spectrum of viral isolates (169, 170). Furthermore, this region also encompasses an MHC-restricted determinant for cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (155) and is part of the major determinant of macrophage and T cell tropism (See Genetic Variation, Cell Tropism, and Pathogenesis). The interaction of mutation and selection gives rise to the quasispecies-a population of viral mutants with different replication rates (38, 117). A quasi- species population structure is commonly observed in RNA viruses (69), and the concept has been applied to HIV in recent years (109, 165), although it is often incorrectly used simply as a surrogate for genetic heterogeneity. The basis of quasispecies theory is as follows. The virus is thought not to exist as a single (chemical) "species" but rather as a cloud of points within the space of all possible nucleotide sequences of that length. Each of the points within that cloud differs by one or more nucleotide substitutions from all others. However, there is a sequence that has the highest Darwinian fitness. This, the "master-sequence," may be present at very low frequency due to mutation pressure and so may be almost "notional," but there will be many sequences that are only one nucleotide (or "Hamming distance") away from it. In contrast to expectations from classical population genetics, the fitness of these se- quences will be increased by their proximity in mutational distance to the fittest form, even if their own intrinsic fitness is significantly lower. The reason is</page><page sequence="20">146 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES simply that the frequency of mutations that will generate the "master-se- quence" is not negligible. The population of sequences around the master-se- quence will therefore replicate most rapidly. The "master-sequence" can be estimated by taking the most common nucleotide at each site-i.e. the con- sensus sequence. In the terms of population genetics, strong stabilizing selec- tion acts as the countervailing force to the diversifying effect of the high mutation rate and constrains the spectrum of variation in the population. This theory does not differ in fundamental respects from the core of popu- lation genetics theory as developed by Fisher, Haldane, and Wright, but rather in emphasis, considering in particular the consequences for a population of immense variability and very high mutation rates, and considering the genome as a whole. There have, for example, been earlier studies of the maximum size of an RNA genome, or genome segment (133). The most important distinction is that the frequency of a viral variant depends not only on its own replicative value but also on the likelihood with which it is produced by the erroneous replication of other variants. On the other hand, the concept of variable fitness is something that has not been a feature of quasispecies theory but is inherent to the population genetics of host-parasite interactions (23, 62, 105, 106, 142). Evidently, the central evolutionary consequence of the quasispecies is that it allows selection from a pool of preexisting variants and provides potential for rapid adaptation to new environmental conditions, such as new antibody response or antiviral agents. Evidence for the existence and selection of such diversity is provided by the rapid resistance produced to antiviral therapy, particularly to the non-nucleoside drugs such as Nevirapine and inhibitors of HIV protease, against which resistant strains can appear in vitro (12, 40, 124). The antiretroviral drug in most use, azidothymidine (AZT), requires a total of 3-4 nucleotide substitutions from "wild type" to generate a fully resistant polymerase, but even this often occurs within six months of the start of treatment (14, 92, 93). The suggestion that the speed and reproducibility of the development of AZT resistance was due to the presence in HIV populations of naturally occurring variants has been raised by observations of some of the relevant mutations before exposure to AZT (112, 178). Another important consequence of the quasispecies concept for those inter- ested in understanding the evolutionary biology of HIV and especially through phylogenetic reconstruction is that, to date, all methods of phylogenetic recon- struction are most reliable when most substitutions are neutral (or nearly so), and thus it is difficult to assess the performance of such methods in the presence of natural selection, and particularly of convergent evolution (71). As well as natural selection, the bias in base composition and substitution seen in HIV, and particularly the strong tendency for G-to-A changes (114), is also likely to cause problems for methods of phylogenetic reconstruction and especially through the accumulation of multiple substitutions at single nucleotide sites.</page><page sequence="21">EVOLUTION OF HIV 147 Finally, it is important to note that the concept of a continuously diverging tree relating viral variants is not an evolutionary truism, but an assumption. The process of base substitution, in particular the concept that the frequency of a viral variant in the quasispecies depends partly on the erroneous replication of other variants, means that for some data sets a net, rather than a tree, may be the most realistic model for the evolution of immunodeficiency viruses. In this context it is appropriate to point out that the classical debate over the relative contributions of genetic drift and natural selection to molecular evolution may by-pass the truly important features of viral evolution. Gojobori et al (56) conclude that the predominance of silent over replacement substitu- tions in certain genes of a number of different viruses, including HIV- 1 is good evidence in support of the neutral theory. Coffin (24), on the other hand, suggests that no mutation in HIV may be neutral and that selective forces may be too small to measure. He further suggests that there is no such thing as a "rate of variation" because every base is subject to different selective forces, which themselves vary throughout the course of the infection, so that rates of substitution cannot be averaged across bases. Sequential Studies-Three Phases of Viral Evolution The process of viral evolution within a single patient is patently central to understanding the interaction between the virus and the human host. Studies of this process have understandably focused on those regions of the genome identified as important targets for the immune system. Until recently, the great majority concentrated just on the V3 region of gpl20, sometimes extending to the other variable regions of env. However, studies have also focused on the regulatory genes nef; rev and tat (33, 109, 129), on pol, in the context of the development of AZT resistance (14, 83, 93, 151), and on gag, in investi- gations of escape from recognition by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (110, 130). One of us earlier identified three distinct phases of HIV evolution within an infected individual (97). Phase I covers the short period from the time of infection with HIV until an antibody response develops, termed seroconver- sion. During this time, usually lasting seven to eight weeks, the virus replicates to high titre, often reaching 106 viral molecules per ml of plasma (29, 131). This phase is ended when the immune response, both CTL and humoral, develops fully and clears infectious virus from the peripheral circulation. PHASE I There have been a number of studies of viral population structure at this phase of infection, in patients infected through a variety of different routes. Zhang et al (177) examined the V3 and V4 sequence populations of individuals mostly infected through the parenteral route (i.e. hemophiliacs through trans- fusions of HIV-infected clotting factor), although some individuals infected through sexual contact were also included. The results were striking. No</page><page sequence="22">148 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES sequence variation was detected in the V3-V4 regions within any of the patients. Even more dramatic was that extremely similar (sometimes identical at the amino acid level) V3 loop regions were found in unrelated patients, despite the fact that the regions flanking the loop could be very different. Such a situation is in marked contrast to what appears to be happening in parts of the gag gene (the p17 region) in sequences taken at the same time. Although the gag gene is generally thought to evolve more slowly than env, sequence diversity was observed in a number of the patients. The pattern of this variation was also noteworthy in that in each patient there appeared to be a single sequence at high frequency and a number of variants that differed in a limited number of substitutions. The extreme similarity in V3 sequences within and between patients at seroconversion has been confirmed in a number of studies (84, 108, 173, 179). Although Zhu et al (179) found less sequence similarity in the V3 region than some other studies, in vitro analyses showed all sequences to be of the mac- rophage tropic and NSI phenotype (see below). Furthermore, significantly less sequence diversity appeared in the envelope glycoprotein gp 120 than in regions of the gag gene. Wolfs et al (173) examined sequence variation in V3 in seven presumed donor-recipient pairs of patients, mainly thought to be infected through sexual contact. Interestingly, the virus that dominated at seroconver- sion in the recipient was not always that observed at highest frequency in the donor. Whatever the sequence variability seen in the donor, viruses of the inferred macrophage tropic and NSI phenotype were found at highest fre- quency in the donor. The preferential presence of viruses of this phenotype at seroconversion has recently been confirmed in a large survey of infected individuals in Amsterdam (90). Similar features are also found in studies of HIV transmission from infected mothers to their children at some time in about 13-40% of such pregnancies. Scarlatti et al (1993) examined V3 sequences in a number of mother-to-child transmission cases. Although the authors con- cluded there were no obvious sequence similarities between the infected chil- dren, closer inspection suggests that the majority of the viruses had changes indicative of macrophage tropism and the NSI phenotype, again in agreement with studies of other modes of transmission. A similar observation was made by Wolinsky et al (174). What processes can explain these patterns? The rapid increase in viral population size, coupled with the general sequence similarity (in the face of the sequence diversity often observed later in the infection) implies that there is selection acting on the viral population, either during the transmission of the virus from host to host or during the time between infection and seroconver- sion. Zhang et al (177) suggested the selection occurs at some time after infection and that a pool of viruses (although possibly of limited size) are transmitted. Very strong selection then acts on parts of the env gene, and most</page><page sequence="23">EVOLUTION OF HIV 149 probably the V3 loop, during primary infection. The strength of this selection is such that it is detectable on genetically linked regions, causing a decline in sequence diversity across the env gene. The diversity sometimes seen in the p17 region of gag would then be explained by recombination between variants in the mixed pool that are transmitted. Although only a single V3 sequence appears to be abundant in early infection, more than one V3 sequence can be transmitted, as is shown in the case of the Florida dentist (see HIV Forensics), where two years after infection patient A was found to share two very different V3 sequences with the dentist. A similar observation has been observed in the context of a rape case in Sweden (2). What is being selected? Most of the studies described above appear to generate sequences that possess amino acid residues associated with macro- phage tropism and the NSI phenotype (see Genetic Variation, Cell Tropism and Pathogenesis), which suggests that macrophages are somehow critical for virus transmission or the establishment of infection. Selection for macrophage tropism could occur in a number of ways. Perhaps macrophages are more efficient in infection and replication in the absence of an immune response, or perhaps HIV is primarily transmitted in macrophages. It is also possible, however, that macrophages themselves are not the subject of selection but rather act to indicate some other feature of HIV infection, although it perhaps is noteworthy that the infection of macrophages is often associated with lentivi- ral disease (54). PHASE II Very different selective forces characterize the period after sero- conversion. Phase II, which may last for many years while the patient is asymptomatic, is characterized by a continual viral replication (131, 178) and the presence of an active immune response, responsible for the dramatic drop in viral titre soon after seroconversion. Thus, the virus must be able to produce antigenically distinct mutants so as to evade the host immune response-a selective process confusingly termed "antigenic drift" following its use in studies on influenza virus (167). Several more detailed studies of sequence variation in this phase of viral evolution have provided interesting insights into the nature of the selective forces. For such comparisons, nucleotide differences between sequences in protein coding regions can be usefully broken down into those that result in a change in an amino acid, known as amino acid replacement substitutions, and those that do not, which are termed synonymous. The proportion of replacement substitutions per replacement site (those nucleotide sites at which a replace- ment substitution is possible) is termed KA and the proportion of synonymous substitutions per synonymous site is termed Ks. The ratio Ks/KA is a useful indicator of selection on protein sequences, with high values indicating strong stabilizing selection for conservation of amino acid sequence change (direc-</page><page sequence="24">150 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES tional selection) (75, 76). Simmonds et al (148) found evidence of the selective replacement of amino acids in an analysis of the extensive sequence variation, observed in the V3 and V4-V5 regions of the env gene from hemophiliacs infected from a single batch of factor VIII in Edinburgh. A Ks/KA ratio of 0.67 was observed in V3 region, and a ratio of 1.24 in the CD4-binding site between V3 and V4. Similarly, Balfe et al (11) found a KSIKA ratio of 1.3 for the V4-V5 region and a ratio of 0.92 in V3 for sequences from the same patients. KYKA ratios less than 1.0 are thought to be indicative of positive natural selection (75, 76). As the V3 region is the principal neutralization determinant of HIV and the V4-V5 hypervariable regions may contribute to conformational epitopes, many of these changes may be involved in the escape from im- munological recognition. Balfe et al (11) estimated the mean rate of sequence change to be 0.4% per year in the V4-V5 region and 0.5% per year in V3 region. The process of sequence evolution in the V4-V5 region in one of these patients was examined in more detail by Simmonds et al (149). Important differences were found between the free virus (RNA) population in the plasma and the lymphocyte-associated proviral (DNA) population in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). To summarize, V4 and V5 variants found in the plasma at seroconversion were not detected in a plasma sample taken three years later, yet they were still detectable as provirus in a contemporary PBMC sample. By the following year, a new population of variants was found in the plasma, and the PBMC sample contained variants found in the plasma in the previous year. Thus, it seems that variants first arise in the plasma, possibly following replication in lymph nodes or spleen, and then enter the PBMCs where they may reside for long periods of time. Conversely, it is true that much more rapid replacement of variants occurs in plasma, presumably be- cause they are more directly exposed to the selective pressure exerted by the immune system. Successive replacement of viral variants was also observed by Cichutek et al (22) who analyzed the VI and V2 regions of the env gene from a hemophiliac infected from factor IX concentrate. Variants found 11 months after sero- conversion were seen to replace those found 5 months after seroconversion, although seroconversion forms persisted in both these later samples. In this study 80% of all nucleotide sequence changes were nonsynonymous, again suggesting that positive natural selection was responsible for the fixation of these changes. Wolfs et al (172) examined sequence evolution in the V3 region from six children infected through a blood transfusion and the donor of the HIV-infected blood. The sequence distances to the donor and between the children increased with time although, interestingly, sequences identical to those found in the donor were detected in the two children with the fastest disease progression, suggesting that they might represent more virulent strains.</page><page sequence="25">EVOLUTION OF HIV 151 A higher rate of replacement substitution than silent substitution was observed in the V3 loop, again suggesting the action of positive natural selection. These rates were 9.5 x 10-3 and 11.4 x 10-3 for Ks and KA, respectively. An increase in sequence diversity with time was also observed by Wolfs et al (173) in a study of V3 variation in two infected homosexuals. Samples were taken over a five-year period, starting from seroconversion, where the viral RNA popu- lation was found to be highly homogeneous. Substitutions that led to escape from antibody recognition could be assigned to specific amino acid changes in the V3 loop, although the precise mechanisms involved in the production of such escape mutants may be complex because neutralization-resistant vi- ruses have been observed where the V3 loop remains completely unaltered (164). This suggests that it is not sufficient to analyze the V3 loop in isolation to understand how HIV- 1 escapes neutralization. Escape mutants have also been assigned to regions of the gag gene where sequence variation leads to the loss of recognition of viral antigens by cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) (130). The process of molecular evolution in phase II was examined in detail by Holmes et al (71). A phylogenetic analysis was performed on V3 sequence variants obtained over the course of seven years of infection within the plasma population of a single patient. Twenty-four different V3 loop amino acid sequences were observed over the course of the infection, beginning with a single sequence at seroconversion that was identical to the consensus for HIV- 1 subtype B found worldwide (that is a sequence of inferred macrophage tropism, NSI phenotype). This sequence had disappeared from the plasma population by three years post-seroconversion, to be replaced by two distinct evolutionary lineages of variants which persisted for the remainder of the infection. A number of features of this phylogenetic pattern shed light on the underlying evolutionary process. First, the presence of two distinct lineages shows that, rather than the simple sequential replacement of one variant by its descendants, another, antigenically distinct, variant may take over. The coexistence of more than one lineage could raise the complexity of the dynamics of the viral population by allowing competition with each other. It also makes the estima- tion of evolutionary rates within a patient even more complex, as the nucleotide distances between populations sampled in different years were often very great. Such estimations which are not based on the phylogeny will be quite mislead- ing. What is even more striking about these lineages is that their constituent viruses have residues associated with different phenotypes. Thus, the se- quences assigned to one lineage were mainly inferred to be of the NSI phe- notype (macrophage tropic) while the other lineage was mainly composed of viruses thought to be of the SI phenotype (T cell tropic) (see Genetic Variation, Cell Tropism and Pathogenesis). Concurrent evolution of populations of viral sequences was also observed</page><page sequence="26">152 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES by Howell et al (73) who analyzed part of the VI region of env in two samples separated by three months from a single patient. Two distinct populations of sequences were observed that differed in the presence/absence of an 18 bp duplication as well as a number of point mutations. These two populations evolved independently, although sequences with intermediate forms were also observed, suggesting that recombination was an important factor. The second observation made by Holmes et al (71) was that there appeared to be a form of frequency dependent selection in the relationship between host and parasite. Specifically, variants that reached a high frequency in the plasma population in one year were generally eliminated by the following year, sug- gesting that the probability of neutralization of a particular viral variant de- pends upon its abundance. Furthermore, once a variant was eliminated from the plasma population, it was often replaced by a variant that differed by only a limited number of amino acids, usually only a single change. It is tempting to speculate that these represent escape mutants, and experiments are underway to test this hypothesis. Sequential studies of other immunodeficiency viruses Studies of SIV se- quence evolution within individual infected monkeys have produced results comparable to those observed in HIV. Burns &amp; Desrosiers (16) found that large amounts of sequence variation could be rapidly generated by infecting monkeys with a single cloned virus. Furthermore, 81% of nucleotide substi- tutions in env resulted in amino acid replacements with the average rate of replacement, which was 6.8 x 10-3, some 4.3 times higher than the average synonymous rate (1.6 x 10-3). This disparity was especially pronounced in the variable regions of the env gene, although, significantly, only the V5 variable region of SIV corresponded to a neutralization epitope of HIV and the V3 region of SIV was relatively well conserved. Intriguingly, the substitution rate in a monkey that remained asymptomatic was 1.6 times faster (1.12 x 10-2 ) than in the monkey that progressed to simian AIDS (7.3 x 10 3). In a similar study Baier et al (9) followed the evolution of the env gene in African green monkeys infected for both long (10 years) and short (15-20 months) periods. The V3 region was again found to be highly conserved, whereas the VI and V2 regions were variable. Extensive variability was seen to evolve from a single genotype at a maximum rate of 7.7 mutations per 1000 bp per year, and 92% of all changes led to amino acid replacement. Finally, Almond et al (5) infected two cynomologus macaques with a mixed population of SIV. Se- quence changes were found in specific regions of gpl20-V1, V2, V4, and V5-but, significantly, not V3. Part of this diversity appears to be generated by recombination. Thus, one consistent feature of SIV studies, in contrast to what is observed in HIV, is that the region homologous to the V3 loop in SIV appears to be highly conserved across all isolates and within sequential studies</page><page sequence="27">EVOLUTION OF HIV 153 of individual animals. Unfortunately, it is not known whether the V3 region of SIVs has a function in the determination of tropism, as proposed for HIV (see Genetic Variation, Cell Tropism and Pathogenesis). Within the host, amino acid change in env is rapid; between hosts it is slower Although many of the above analyses are based around the relative numbers of synonymous and replacement substitutions, their uncritical acceptance may lead to startlingly misleading conclusions (115) about the nature and rate of molecular evolution. In a study of sequence variation in feline immunodefici- ency virus (FIV), Rigby et al (135) found that estimates of KA were often higher than those of Ks in regions of the env gene of FIV isolates taken from individual cats, or animals infected from the same source. In contrast, Ks was generally found to be higher than KA in comparisons between more distantly related animals. This suggests that positive natural selection is responsible for the fixation of many mutants within individual animals, but this change is not progressive during the epidemic. Rather, the virus populations of different cats, or humans, evolve in overlapping regions of "sequence space." In consequence the effect of the within-patient positive selection is slowly eroded by silent changes that accumulate at greater evolutionary distances. This is precisely the opposite effect to that seen in nuclearly encoded genes where it is usual for synonymous substitutions to saturate at more distant comparisons. Similar observations have been made on SIV populations in macaques infected with a molecular clone, and in longitudinal studies of HIV-infected patients. Therefore, observations of a KJKA ratio close to 1.0 do not necessarily imply that the majority of substitutions are selectively neutral as was concluded from the first studies in this area, which were based entirely on comparisons between independent isolates (95). Furthermore, in FIV, as in HIV, identical amino acid changes occur on independent evolutionary lineages so that con- tinual divergence does not occur at replacement sites. This further adds to the disparity between intra- and inter-individual estimates of Ks and KA. A similar observation has also been made by Shpaer &amp; Mullins (146). Nowak &amp; May (118) described how, in mathematical models of HIV and SIV evolution, different settings for parameters describing the interaction between the host immune system and the genetic characteristics of the patho- gen can generate infections with a variety of different outcomes, all of which may be seen in lentiviruses in nature. They conclude that whether a particular lentivirus infection will be pathogenic depends on the settings of these param- eters. A similar mathematical approach has been used to investigate the po- tential efficacy of vaccination against HIV (120). However, the nature of the interaction between host immune responses to viral sequence variants is not a simple example of adaptive evolution, a point discussed in greater detail below. Other regions of the HIV genome do not appear to be subject to such strong</page><page sequence="28">154 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES selection pressures. Meyerhans et al (109) compared the sequence of the tat gene in virus populations from peripheral blood with those of virus cultures established from the same blood samples. They studied four sequential samples spanning a 2.5 year period from a single HIV- 1 infected patient and found differences in the sequence compositions of the in vivo and in vitro populations such that there was a selection for minor forms of virus adapted to culturing conditions. There was no evidence of the selective replacement of one set of sequences by another in the in vivo samples. A similar observation was made by Delassus et al (34) who examined nef and LTR sequences from the same patient over a four-year period. PHASE iII The third phase of within-patient HIV evolution was identified in the model of Nowak et al (119) as the time when the host immune response collapses and the patient progresses into AIDS. The aim of this model, which has a simple basis in quasispecies theory, is to explain the destruction of the immune system quantitatively in terms of a direct interaction between the virus and the CD4+ T cell population. The central element in this model is the assumption of an asymmetric interaction between the viral quasispecies and the population of CD4+ T cells (the central cellular targets for HIV infection), in that each CD4O cell is directed against a specific HIV antigen, but each virus strain can kill any CD4 cell. From such an assumption Nowak et al (119) predict the existence of an "antigenic diversity" threshold below which the immune system can regulate the viral population, above which the immune system collapses and the patient develops AIDS. It is predicted that when AIDS develops, and immune responses are lost, the variant with the highest replicative capacity will reach the highest frequency in the population and thus viral diversity will decline. However, we suggest that the population expansion at this stage will be less than in Phase I because of the much smaller number of uninfected CD4+ T cells (97). The experimental data do not at present give a clear picture of the relation- ship between viral genetic diversity and progression. McNearney et al (108) found only 0.01% amino acid and 0.02% nucleotide sequence differences in env were observed in two rapidly progressing neonatal transfusion recipients and their blood donor. No changes were observed in V3, nor were there any differences between isolates obtained from brain, lung, and blood. Other stud- ies on this area are underway in a number of laboratories. HIV-] Genetic Variation, Cell Tropism and Pathogenesis An important element in determining the pattern and process of HIV evolution within a single individual is the appearance of viruses that differ genetically in their cell tropism. Although the CD4+ lymphocyte is the major HIV-infected population in PBMCs, cells of the monocyte-macrophage lineage appear to be a route of introduction of HIV into many tissues, including the CNS (87).</page><page sequence="29">EVOLUTION OF HIV 155 When HIV- 1 is cultured from infected patients, it is commonly observed that the viral strains from different patients can differ in their rate of growth (46, 47), and in their ability to form syncytia, giant multinucleated cells that arise from gpl2O-CD4-mediated membrane fusion (156). While virus from most patients can be cultured in PBMCs (25), some strains ("SI" - syncy- tium-inducing) can form syncytia in transformed T cell lines, particularly the HTLV-I transformed lines C8166 and MT2. These strains, however, do not grow in macrophages, while those that do not form syncytia (or grow) in T cell lines ("NSI" - non-syncytium-inducing) can usually also infect macro- phages. Thus, there appear to be two main tropisms: (i) viruses that can infect both macrophages and circulating peripheral blood T lymphocytes (macro- phage-tropic strains), and (ii) viruses that can infect peripheral blood T lym- phocytes and transformed T cell lines. There have been intensive efforts toward the characterization of the genetic basis of differences in in vitro growth properties between strains of HIV-1. For example, tat gene activity influences growth rate, and naturally occurring variation in the level of tat gene activity has been demonstrated (109). How- ever, variation in the env gene, and in particular the hypervariable V3 loop, appears to be primarily responsible for differences in pathogenicity and tropism (19, 20, 49, 78, 145). Specifically, substitutions of residues with acidic side chains at certain sites on the side of the V3 loop are associated with rapid growth and syncytium-induction. Milich et al (111) undertook an extensive analysis of the biological (phenotypic) properties of a large number of V3 loop sequences, with particular regard to the amino acid replacements implicated in the shift from NSI to SI viruses. They conclude that the transition is associated with the presence of nonconservative basic amino acid substitutions at four positions and most notably with a change from an acidic amino acid at position 25. As discussed above, macrophage tropic variants tend to appear early in the infection, and they possess V3 loop sequences similar to the consensus derived for subtype B, while T tropic variants tend to arise later in the infection and are more divergent in sequence. Most importantly, many patients from whom such T cell tropic viral strains are isolated frequently have AIDS or develop AIDS within a short time (&lt; 2 years) (86, 157), whereas those from whom only slow-growing, macrophage- tropic strains can be isolated have a better prognosis, in general. It has therefore been proposed that the development of SI variants is a determinant of AIDS. However, this possibility has to be reconciled with the fact that only NSI strains can ever be isolated from nearly 50% of patients with AIDS. The difficult question as to whether the appearance of SI variants is a cause or simply a consequence of the degradation of the immune system still remains to be answered. Schuitemaker et al (141) conclude that monocytotropic HIV viruses are</page><page sequence="30">156 LEIGH BROWN &amp; HOLMES responsible for the persistence (and perhaps transmission) of HIV infection, while T cell tropic viruses are responsible for the development of AIDS. However, indirect evidence that macrophage tropism is central to the persis- tence of HIV infection comes from studies of HIV-infected chimpanzees. The HIV chimpanzee infection takes a very different course from that of humans. Specifically, neither plasma viremia, CNS disease, nor lymphatic hyperplasia are observed in HIV-infected chimpanzees (54). Both CNS and lymphatic hyperplasia in HIV-infected humans are characterized by the persistent infec- tion of macrophages and dendritic cells. Significantly, HIV-1 appears to be unable to infect chimpanzee monocytes and macrophages, at least in vitro (54, 141), but the strains used to infect chimpanzees appear to be those such as HIVLAI that are aggressively T cell tropic in human cells. Finally, there has been much interest in HIV variants that specifically infect the brain. Analysis of brain-specific populations is especially important be- cause HIV/AIDS often causes neurologic dysfunctions, such as encephalopa- thy; this may be due either to opportunistic infections or direct HIV invasion of the central nervous system. Epstein et al (42) examined variation in the V3 domain in brain and spleen of children with AIDS and found both tissue-spe- cific and host-specific sequence variation, although the former had the strong- est effect. A similar observation was made by Steuler et al (154) who looked at proviral gp4l sequences from blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from six individuals and found distinct populations in three of the patients and especially in an AIDS patient suffering from encephalopathy. Li et al (101) also examined the in vivo characteristics of HIV in the brain and found that it is characterized by the persistence of mixtures of fully competent and relatively homogeneous monocyte-macrophage tropic viruses. Thus, HIV sequences obtained from the brain or CSF exhibit an increased tropism for macrophages, compared to isolates taken from blood. Furthermore, the brain may act as a reservoir that is poorly accessible to immune surveillance and viral clearance, and therefore antigenic variation may not be driven by immune selection. There is increasing evidence that virus replication and the accumulated burden of virus in lymphoid tissue may play an important and direct role in pathogenesis (41, 127) and notably in the brain where high levels of viral expression are associated with neurological dysfunction. In general, it seems likely that viral replication, burden, and variation are all important determinants of AIDS pathogenesis. CONCLUSION-IMPLICATIONS FOR EVOLUTIONARY BIOLOGY The wealth of data accumulated over the last few years has made the im- munodeficiency viruses the most data-rich group of organisms for any evolu-</page><page sequence="31">EVOLUTION OF HIV 157 tionary analyses. A number of specific selective forces have been identified. The effect of these agents can be investigated quantitatively in cell culture (both anti-viral drugs and neutralizing antibodies) and in the experimental models, mainly SIV and FIV, but increasingly now also HIV in the SCID-Hu mouse system. Integration of the observations with analysis continues in all the areas we have reviewed, but as yet there has been relatively little effort by evolutionary biologists to incorporate these conclusions into the body of evo- lutionary thought. Apart from a lack of familiarity with the system, one possible reason for this lies in the fact that much effort is devoted in other systems on increasingly sophisticated analyses aimed at demonstrating selection acting at the molecular level. Such methodologies are clearly not relevant to the study of a viral population whose constitution is shaped almost completely by the complex mix of selective forces we have discussed. On the other hand, what is occu- pying those involved in such studies in the immunodeficiency viruses are the details of how these selective agents interact to determine the fitness of the population, a question that is barely accessible to investigation in anything other than a microbial system. Some aspects we have discussed, particularly the evolution of viruses with tropisms for different cell types, have echoes in Gillespie's "random environments" model (55). In other respects, particularly with regard to the speed of the adaptive response, quasi-species theory has made an important contribution, and work on the host-parasite interaction has led to vital insights relating to the interaction with the immune system. In such a complex and important area, these strands must be thoroughly integrated for the rapid advances in understanding, which are so desperately needed. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS Work in Andrew J.
