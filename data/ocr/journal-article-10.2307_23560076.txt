<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself1 Charles T. Mathewes Abstract Reinhold Niebuhr's critics rightly identify flaws in his anthropology, but err in assuming those flaws irreparably vitiate his larger proposal. In fact Niebuhr's work contains two different anthropologies, one problematically "modernist" and one Augustinian; we may use the latter to critique the former within the context of his larger program, thus retaining (and indeed sharpening) the basic theological ethical project of Niebuhr's work. By doing so we move beyond Niebuhr's formulations in a way that incorporates his insights at the most basic level, thus showing how we might read putatively "modernist" thinkers back into the presumptively "premodern" traditions from which they spring. Introduction A tradition is an ongoing act of forgiveness. We inherit our ability to reflect from our elders, and we come to see that their tools only imperfectly fit the problems we face. Hence, unless we wish totally to jettison our minds, we find ourselves compelled to work through that inheritance, accepting its imperfections (and, furthermore, accepting that our own solutions will cause our descendants similar problems). This acceptance involves, indeed just is, in part, forgiveness. This is not a false piety; it is simply the condition of being responsible in one's thought to one's predecessors, a fact ingredient in thought simpliciter. Nor is this a distinctly modern problem; Plato's Republic is so centrally concerned with the difficulties inherent in inheritance that an alternative title for that dialogue might be "fathers and sons." We ought to keep these facts in mind when we think about how to relate to our predecessors. This essay is an attempt to work out one such Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics 19 (1999): 69-94</page><page sequence="2">70 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics relationship, between contemporary Christian ethicists and one of our most influential ancestors, Reinhold Niebuhr. Niebuhr seems to need much forgiving. Most especially he is criticized for gifting us with an unremittingly bleak pessimism about the human condition, a pessimism which warrants a terribly cynical approach to social life.2 And it is certainly the case that, historically, such criticisms have a point. Perhaps the grandest example of this is the Time Magazine cover of March 8, 1948, which portrays Niebuhr's brooding visage emerging from a dark and sinister background of black clouds, illuminated only by a tiny, glowing white cross at the base of the picture. As if to spell it out for more textually-minded folk, the caption reads: 'Theologian Reinhold Niebuhr: Man's story is not a success story."3 This picture of Niebuhr as a dour pessimist underlies charges that he was the theologian of containment and the Cold War, the eloquent defender of the status quo, the "apologist of power."4 'The irony of Reinhold Niebuhr," as Stanley Hauerwas and Michael Broadway argue in a powerful essay with that title, is that his prophetic cultural critique ended up supporting the very liberalism it aimed to undo.5 The point of this essay is not so much to contest these critiques, as to contest the use of them to justify rejecting Niebuhr's thought tout court. For we should forgive him, to reclaim both his diagnostic intelligence about politics and society and the deep theological roots of that intelligence. Even his present-day critics admit that his diagnostic insights were remarkable; John Milbank allows that "the substantive analyses of political and social processes in Moral Man and Immoral Society are impressive," and others such as Kathryn Tanner concur.6 These and similar admissions may warrant treating Niebuhr as a particularly acute political commentator camouflaged as a classically liberal theologian—that is, with very little camouflage at all.7 But his work is deeply theological; George Lindbeek, whom few would identify as Niebuhrian, has written that Niebuhr was "perhaps the last American theologian who in practice (and to some extent in theory) made extended and effective attempts to re-describe major aspects of the contemporary scene in distinctively Christian terms."8 Niebuhr's genius resided not just in prophetic critique, for alongside those statements commonly read as supporting pessimism in Niebuhr's work stands an insistence on hope, love, and the possibilities of human freedom as real, if not "simple," possibilities. Robert McAfee Brown speaks for many who were inspired by Niebuhr when he describes Niebuhr as a "pessimistic optimist," and after all, the last word of Niebuhr's magnum opus, The Nature and Destiny of Man, is "hope."9 The typical picture of Niebuhr as essentially a pessimistic conservative renders incomprehensible his almost maniacal activism, his impassioned championing of causes, and his consistent rejection of authoritarianism in favor of democracy. Indeed, Niebuhr is best seen as a sober judge of both the problems and the possibilities of human community, who prefaced his famous (or notorious) saying, "man's capacity for injustice makes democracy necessary,"</page><page sequence="3">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself 71 with the claim that "man's capacity for justice makes democracy possible."10 It is Niebuhr's preaching of the complexity of all human endeavors that is the most distinctive note of his thought. His insistence on human complexity was the consequence of his attempt to see all the recalcitrant "facts" of human existence.11 Niebuhr was most basically neither a radical critic of the social order, hurling jeremiads down from the Gothic magnificences of Union Theological Seminary, nor some sort of court theologian, ministering to the best and brightest of Babylon. The very diversity of the criticisms of Niebuhr should warn us against a too-ready assent to the charges. This is not to say that his theology is without fault. On the contrary, it is deeply flawed, as critics such as his brother H. Richard perceived long ago. But such criticisms do not entail a thoroughgoing rejection of his thought. Those who think so typically take him to have offered a explicit systematic theological position which we ought to refuse.12 But we should heed H. Richard's typically prescient perception that "Reinie's thought appears to me to be like a great iceberg of which three-fourths or more is beneath the surface and in which what is explicitly said depends on something that is not made explicit."13 The genius of "Reinie's" thought lies not in its explicit theology, but in its theological anthropology.14 As he himself said, "I cannot and do not claim to be a theologian. I have taught Christian Social Ethics for a quarter of a century and have also dealt in the ancillary field of 'apologetics.'"15 While I do not want to get caught up in the Quest for the Historical Reinie, I think we should take Niebuhr at his word—that we should take him more literally than do many of his critics. Of course to take him literally here does not mean to not take him seriously, and in particular it does not mean to not take him seriously as a theologian. But I think we should take him seriously as a theological anthropologist, and especially in his analysis of the theological motives at the base of the self—an analysis, we will see, that is essentially Augustinian. The charges against Niebuhr—charges from thinkers as diverse as James Gustafson, Hans Frei, John Howard Yoder, and John Milbank—have too much weight to be ignored, but they miss something important latent within Niebuhr's work. We can read Niebuhr against himself, using his theological anthropology to diagnose and critique his explicit theology. This strategy allows us to retain the many valuable aspects of his thought. To demonstrate this is the task of this essay. Part I identifies problems in Niebuhr's thought. Part II details resources Niebuhr's Augustinian theological anthropology offers, and which may rectify those errors. Part HI argues that the insights provided in that theological anthropology are significant, and ought to be retained.</page><page sequence="4">72 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics Realism as Pessimism: Epistemology and Sin The criticisms of Niebuhr's Christian realism are typically twofold, concerning his account's Christian-ness and its "realism." To critics, Niebuhr's theology seems to refuse first-order Christian language any real purchase on reality, preferring instead a symbolic interpretation of the language. In combination with a "realistic" interpretation of Christianity's moral grip on us which makes the Great Commandment of love an "impossible possibility," this makes Niebuhr's "realism" not realistic at all but depressingly pessimistic, in a way that legitimates a cynical Constantinianism. These criticisms are right in that Niebuhr's account is tempted towards both a moral and an epistemological pessimism.16 These problems are rooted in what I call his subjectivist epistemology. In the following paragraphs, I seek to unpack these problems and trace their roots in that epistemology. In essence, Niebuhr's metaphysical pessimism is rooted proximately in the fact that he has "naturalized" sin. His analysis of sin as "inevitable yet not necessary" is meant to explain why we cannot help but sin, yet retain responsibility for so doing.17 But as several commentators argue, this is a distinction without a différence.18 Niebuhr argues that humans exist at some "epistemic distance"19 from God—a distance of which we are made anxiously aware by our sense of emptiness, the knowledge of an absence which is the negative knowledge given in "general revelation"—and that, given the anxiety that situation naturally elicits, humans inevitably fabricate some comforting idol for themselves.20 But whence this anxiety? Is it not itself a sign of a prior sinful mistrust? Indeed, this sinful mistrust seems elicited (at least reasonable, and possibly even required) by the condition in which we are created by God—at least on Niebuhr's picture of that creation. All Niebuhr says in defense of his account is that the doctrine of Original Sin expresses how human experience teaches us that sin "presupposes itself."21 Sin cannot be explained without temptation, but the inner logic of temptation reveals an evil lurking therein, which hides a further temptation, which reveals a further evil, and so on ad infinitum—so that, in evil, we find a (quite literally) vicious circle.22 The recognition of this reality requires a "provisional defiance of logic" in order to capture the "dialectical truth" of the doctrine of Original Sin.23 In this context, Niebuhr may appeal to paradox and demand the "provisional defiance of logic," but the account he offers of sin "presupposing itself' seems inadequate. The distinction between "inevitable" and "not necessary" is really a distinction without a difference. That is, Niebuhr's account of the God-world relationship stacks the deck in favor of the Fall. But this makes it difficult for us to see the Fall's real and essential absurdity. Niebuhr in effect explains the Fall too well.24</page><page sequence="5">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself 73 Niebuhr's account not only explains sin too well; it also makes faith and hope seem absurd, miraculous, contrary to all available evidence.25 Niebuhr's work depicts the human as inevitably sinful and the human world as inevitably conflictual, a vale of tears that we can never escape. The fact that sin seems reasonable, and hope and faith unreasonable, are for Niebuhr's critics merely symptomatic of his deep metaphysical pessimism. The problem is not that this metaphysics is explanatorily asymmetrical, but that the asymmetry is the wrong way round; Niebuhr's is the Manichees' asymmetry, which pictures our world as a world of corpses, a world in which God is not just epistemically hidden but actually absent.26 This pessimism about existence in the world, and its emphasis upon limits, serves to quarantine the "really important" issues of our lives from contamination by historical and material existence, and tempts us to a more conservative stance than necessary. Niebuhr presents a demoralized and demoralizing worldview in which worldly involvement, however necessary, is inevitably disappointing. Niebuhr's account still insists that our real goods are not themselves really worldly, that our existence in the world remains merely a necessary evil. For all his animadversions, Niebuhr's thought remained perpetually tempted to become a "theology of containment," and to affirm a politics of deflated expectations and inevitable disappointments. Niebuhr's account is not only metaphysically pessimistic; it is epistemologically pessimistic as well.27 This epistemic pessimism underlies his account of sin as "inevitable" yet "not necessary," for it entails that human attempts to think God are invariably projections. The human mind is nothing but a factory of idols, fabricating anthropomorphic Gods as comforters of our anxieties. What truth we can know about God is wholly negative-. God is not here, God is a Deus absconditus, a hidden God. We know only God's absence; it haunts us, because we know vaguely that we need just such a presence to be whole creatures.28 Religious language is thus fundamentally a negative language, revealing to us the inadequacy of any of our conceptualizations and our lack of any positive knowledge. We know God most fundamentally as what we fail to comprehend, as limit.29 This is argumentatively useful; Niebuhr's symbolic or mythic account of Christian discourse works to stifle any challenge to his metaphysic that might be brought from that discourse. Furthermore, Niebuhr's account is coherent with his metaphysics; Just as his metaphysics is built upon a picture of God as Deus absconditus, so his epistemology ends up entailing a theologica absconditus. In all this he is in part justly iconoclastic. With the early Barth, and with much recent so-called "postmodern" discussion of the difficulty of naming God, Niebuhr is wary of any anthropomorphizing. Yet one may say, as one can to the early Barth (and many "postmoderns"), that while it is good to protest that one cannot say "God" merely by saying "humanity" in a loud voice, one cannot say "God" just by saying "no" in a loud voice, either. Iconoclasm can 30 be idolatrous.</page><page sequence="6">74 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics These criticisms are not new. They extend back to H. Richard Niebuhr, and have received their most incisive recent formulation in John Milbank's critique of Kantian "theologies of right."31 Such criticisms suggest that the root problem lies in Niebuhr's excessively "transcendent" theology, his picture of God as not immanent—a picture which, as was argued above, ignores sin's effects on our noetic capacities, and so takes as normative our sinful avoidance of God's presence in our lives, validating our sinful wish to be distant from God. But the deep problem is not Niebuhr's anthropocentric theology but his theomorphic anthropology, his assumption that humans must come to construct their understanding of the world on their own—his assumption that the human is gifted with an epistemological analogue of God's ex nihilo power. This may seem to be a simple problem with Niebuhr's epistemology and his refusal to give up claims of "faith" versus reason, and has been read as such by some critics.32 But the issue seems more basically anthropological than epistemological. As Rebekah Miles has perceptively noted, the basic problem lies in "a weakness in his model of the self," which is Niebuhr's separation of "boundedness and freedom within the self."33 Niebuhr's project is vexed by its partially, though crucially, subjectivist assumptions. The term "subjectivism" refers to that set of understandings of human existence that assume that the human subject has priority over against what is "outside" of it—that the human subject makes the first move in acting in the "outside" world, coming to understand the world, and in general in all its "relations" to that outside. Subjectivist worldviews picture the self's relations to the world as essentially technological. Furthermore, the world itself becomes a "wilderness of mirrors," for such worldviews create the basic anxiety that, in seeking to relate to the world, to get to the "outside," we will never get there— that, as Emerson said, "use what language we will, we can never say anything but what we are."34 "Subjectivism" so described encompasses a wide variety of views. Voluntarism, projectivism, and solipsism are all species of subjectivism.35 Niebuhr's subjectivism manifests itself in his epistemology, his picture of the human inquirer. While Tillich famously claimed that Niebuhr had no epistemology,36 he nonetheless assumed one, and built his account of sin upon it. This account assumes that the human is primordially independent of the world, and must achieve an understanding of the world by itself, through constructing an intellectual bridge to it. This is so for theology as well as ontology; as we are necessarily, though tragically only partially, self-transcendent creatures, we know we must trust in some external power, but we cannot know anything about it. All we know is our lack; we are "in the position of being unable to comprehend [ourselves] in [our] full stature of freedom without a principle of comprehension . . . beyond [our] comprehension."37 The deep root of sin thus lies not in disobedience but in our misinterpretation of our relation to God. What is crucial here is that the human being must do the interpreting, the human being is the actor: For Niebuhr, the self constructs its own self-understanding ex nihilo,</page><page sequence="7">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself 75 without access to any set of givens to which it may appeal.38 What follows from this is sin: because the revelation of the authentic source of human meaning waits upon God's revelation, and because we humans are anxiously impatient for such comprehension, we invariably setde on some partial vision as grounding ourselves. Thus his account of the negativity of religious language and myth, and his account of sin as inevitable. In short, if Niebuhr's picture of the God-world relation is metaphysically dualistic, and his realism concomitantly ethically pessimistic, it is because his anthropology is subjectivistic. I am not alone in condemning such subjectivism in theology; echoing Bonhoeffer, I am saying that epistemology is sin. But I am alone in suggesting that Niebuhr himself offers us a standpoint from which this condemnation becomes possible. This is so because Niebuhr's Manichean tendencies are paralleled by a fundamentally Augustinian account of the perversion of human nature, an insight built upon Augustine's love-psychology. That is, while his explicit theology is written from the perspective of sin, his theological anthropology is written from the perspective of grace, and in fact is built upon the thought of the Doctor of Grace, St. Augustine. Niebuhr's Augustinian Anthropology ; Sin without Cynicism So there is a way in which Niebuhr's realism, construed materially as a "realistic" worldview, is despairingly pessimistic, and is premised upon a flawed epistemological method, which is in turn premised upon a dubious vision of the human as boot-strapping him or herself into epistemic relation with the world. This is not the whole Niebuhr, however; and as J. L. Austin said, there is the part where you say it and the part where you take it back. There is another way to construe Niebuhr's realism, not as a pre-given set of claims about the world, but rather as an attitude of humility before it; this realism is not governed by the subjectivistic epistemology detailed above, but is instead rooted in the altogether different and more fertile soil of an Augustinian anthropology of love. This section details this love-anthropology and shows how it offers a radically different form of realism, one immune to the problems identified above. Niebuhr's realism can be read as an attempt to develop a "Christian Realism" which is not pessimistic but rather empowering, as Robin Lovin has convincingly demonstrated.39 Indeed, Lovin's account suggests that Niebuhr is basically a reflexive realist, a realist about the value and perils of "realism" itself. Niebuhr is aware of the fact that our root motive for reflection, for theory—the need to find our way through a complex and bewildering world—is best served by resisting theory's hegemony, refusing to crown theory the master of our consciousness and our conscience.40 Niebuhr's realism hence entails a fundamentally humble approach to understanding and undertaking action, a humility that serves as one of the keystones of his thought. In terms of understanding, if we want to transcend</page><page sequence="8">76 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics partial accounts, we might want to turn to an account which acknowledges the imperfections of our own position, while preserving its real insights, rather than jettison the latter in a fit of excessive epistemological pique. That is, we might want to place supreme value on having the most comprehensive account possible, even if that account is at present not fully comprehensible.4I Breadth of vision is more important than any fastidious fixation on seamless theoretical coherence; it is better to violate our canons of consistency than allow our concerns about the elegance of our epistemic framework to trump our appreciation of ontological realities. When seen in this light, "realism," as Niebuhr offers it, is most basically the claim that content trumps form: What is true is more important than how we know that it is true. Our practical concerns must not be subordinated to our methodological ones. Indeed, "realism" is a method most basically by being an anft'-method.42 Understood in this way, Niebuhr's famous skepticism about claims to innocence or purity is not a disabling, paralyzing hermeneutic of suspicion, but rather an "enabling humility," an empowering recognition that perfect knowledge and total purity are not only impossible but unnecessary, and that our desire for such perfection is pernicious.43 Far from trapping us in despair, this skepticism liberates us by equipping us to resist two opposing temptations to partial resolutions of our quandary—a presumptuously optimistic "rationalism," which presumes it can attain (or rather already has attained) some ideal of total knowing and thus can perfectly control existence; and a despairingly cynical and iconoclastic "skepticism" which is the condition into which disillusioned rationalists inevitably recoil.44 We know in part and in a mirror dimly; this realization compels us both to act and to beware the partiality of our understanding. This form of Niebuhr's realism allows us to recognize sin without lapsing into cynicism. This realism is built upon a positive picture of the human, a "transcendental anthropology"45 whose intelligibility and hermeneutic adequacy is detailed via Niebuhr's existential analyses of humans as self-interpreting beings existing in the world, an analysis of both the inner dynamics of human agents and their relations to what is "outside" of them.46 But this anthropology in turn is not constructed de novo by Niebuhr; it is premised upon a psychology of human sinfulness in terms of dishonesty and perversion, a psychology that relies on an Augustinian account of the human as "always already" positively related to God and the world. Niebuhr himself recognized this debt; as he himself said, "I was first influenced not so much by the Reformers as by the study of St. Augustine."47 Niebuhr's careful assessment of the human's complexity is developed from Augustine's own theological anthropology, especially Augustine's analysis of the human subject's openness to otherness at its base.48 On this Augustinian account, the Fall is never total, because every explicit rejection of God by the human implicitly affirms the human's true dependence upon God. As Niebuhr says, "the dishonesty of man is thus an interesting refutation of the doctrine of man's total</page><page sequence="9">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself 11 depravity."49 Sin's character as dishonesty reveals that a genuine anthropology is ineliminably a theological anthropology. Human sin is never the simple revolt of the whole human against God, and the consequent complete alienation of the self from God; it is best described as the disruption and division of humans as we try explicitly to live without God while implicitly, in our very revolt, relying upon God. This rebellion of the self against itself is seen in the human's own conscience: "The 7, ' which from the perspective of self-transcendence, regards the sinful self not as self but as 'sin, ' is the same I which from the perspective of sinful action regards the transcendent possibilities of the self as not the self but as 'law.' It is the same self."50 Just as the conscience directly reveals the self's ineliminable self-transcendence, so it indirectly reveals the self's ineliminable rootedness in a divine other. For it is only because the human relies upon God, even in abandoning God, that the human's act is sin and not simple self annihilation. But humans avoid recognizing this and so our sinful lives are extended attempts to live out a lie we tell to ourselves. This account of human agency ensures human responsibility by locating the origin of sin not in God's absence from the self, but in the self's attempt to absent itself from God, in its preemptive seizure of priority from God, and its attempt to be sicut Deus, like God.51 Thus what I earlier described as subjectivism turns out to be not simply a common problem in modern thought, but also the proper description of sin. The priority of human activity over against the Divine, and the consequential infinite distance separating God and the world, is what we sinners want to be the case, what we would like to be true. The self's lack of faith in God causes it to lose its coherence and become a "lesser self," but it is not exactly appropriate to describe the "less"-ness of that self as a lost thing, but rather the continually tormented attempt to lose something—namely, to lose one's dependence on God.52 But the self cannot lose that dependence, for to do so would be not to exist. So the self wrestles with itself, perpetually struggling to escape God, and hence its own existence. The inescapably present possibility of salvation is due not to human beings' own explicit or conscious self-will, but rather to their implicit or unconscious dependence upon God—or, rather, to God's continued support which, despite humanity's best efforts, refuses to permit humanity to annihilate itself.53 This phenomenon is often called the "divided self;" but perhaps it is better to describe this phenomenon not so much in terms of division as of revolt, the whole self revolting against both God and itself; most basically, the self is not divided, but self-deceiving.54 This psychology of duplicity offers a distinction different from the epistemological one between "general" and "special" revelation, a distinction which can do all the work the epistemological one attempted to do without entangling itself in the latter's problems. Rather than identifying God's positive revelation with special revelation, the self is always already related in some positive manner to God, and implicitly acknowledges that relationship. Humanity's ontological dependence translates into an epistemological</page><page sequence="10">78 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics dependence; humans are able to know only insofar as they are known by God. Thus, even fallen humans have some vestigial knowledge of God, the loss of which would render them incapable of any thought at all. In its deepest roots, then, Niebuhr's account of sin is premised on a theological anthropology that locates human sin within an overarching horizon of divine love. This is a profoundly Augustinian vision; central to it is Niebuhr's development of Augustine's insight that humans always act for some love, that sin is the consequence of our flawed pursuit of genuine goods, and that the world is composed of two "cities," two distinct orientations of human love or forms of existence, one of which tries to live solely in and through itself, the other of which lives in and through God.55 In this sinful world, neither of these is ever present without the other, although our sense of the proper form of love reveals the final futility of self-centered love, and the need of our transcendent comprehension. This Augustinian theological anthropology not only sets the terms for Niebuhr's critiques of other accounts, typically as projects of recurvatus in se est-, it also operates constructively, both to motivate and chasten our involvement in the world. That is, the proposal is finally practically valuable, and in a way that many of its critics have not yet managed to be, because it promotes a fundamental attitude of acknowledging responsibility in inhabiting the world. Niebuhr's Augustinian Realism: Acknowledging Responsibility At best the above lets us extract from Niebuhr's work a theological anthropology that is innocent of the accusations often leveled against his writings. But one might think that I have merely exonerated Niebuhr on technicalities. For cannot all of the above be acquired more straightforwardly from other thinkers rather than undertaking such extravagant exegetical gymnastics? That is, in brief: So what? Well, whether or not other thinkers offer analogous accounts, Niebuhr's work should appeal to us for what he does with this account, for the way he uses it to develop a program of "acknowledging responsibility" that is as practically fruitful as it is Christianly rooted. His whole account is fundamentally in the service of advancing this practical imperative. This concluding section details this program via Niebuhr's understanding of agape, his critique of natural law, and his account of the relations between love and justice. Of course, arguing anything about Niebuhr's ethics seems a bit like jumping from the frying pan into the fire, for the character of Niebuhr's ethical proposal is as disputed as the overall value of his thought. Contemporary Niebuhrians disagree vehemently over it; some see it as essentially progressive, others see it as essentially conservative, and both evaluations are used by interpreters to commend or to condemn his thought.56 But many, in seeking to enlist Niebuhr for their political purposes, rush past the most important facet of his ethics: his rationale for activism, whatever political labels get attached to it. To see this we</page><page sequence="11">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself 79 must uncover the kind of participation in "the world" Niebuhr thinks Christianity promotes. Niebuhr's proposal motivates us not to escape the world, but rather more fully to enter into it; it works to make our lives, as Lovin suggests, "fully political."57 'Politics" here must be understood in a sense different from our typical understanding of it.58 It is not simply, nor even centrally, political lobbying about legislation, but is instead the open pursuit of meaning and flourishing in our lives. It is the kind of visible activity whereby the early Christians distinguished themselves from the various esoteric heresies and mystery cults that populated their world. We respond to the grace of Christ most basically by fully embracing our existence in the world as a fragile gift. Of course, Niebuhr's proposal is not for a theocracy, nor is his vision of worldly participation fundamentally violent. We act with knowledge of our sin, and so we act with an eye to justice, even as we see that we cannot perfectly realize that justice. Our action, that is, must acknowledge its implication in the kinds of things it resists—an acknowledgment related to what Bernard Williams has called "agent-regret."59 This is not, pace many critics, a consequentialist abolition of moral scruples; we act "in the contrite knowledge of the guilt of our action," in a way "which refuses to make sin normative but which also refuses to withdraw from history because all history is sinful."60 This differs from Williams' proposal by being an incipiently inearnational vision. In this sense, Niebuhr's account, while emphasizing the importance of the Atonement, more deeply reveals the import of the Incarnation for a properly Christian account of politics. The Incarnation's centrality for Niebuhr is seen clearly in the centrality of love in his Augustinian psychology. Our lives are organized around "forms of love," which are both affective orientations and cognitive estimations and valuations.61 This love, or agape, is neither wholly "transcendental" nor wholly "material;" while it is fundamentally at home in the world, it stands also beyond the world as both incomprehensible and (now) sinfully vexed within it. This position is more controversial than it may at first appear: Against "sentimental" rejections of talk about justice in favor of insisting on the straightforward governance of all relationships by love, agape is not a "simple historical possibility;" against "absolutist" interpretations of agape as strictly non-worldly, and so totally inoperative in the world, Niebuhr insists it is not simply outside history, but rather both underpins and transcends the historical world.62 We have no direct "worldly" comprehension of agape, and so we must seek "beyond" the material world to understand it; as Niebuhr says, "the harmonies which are actually achieved in history always are partly borrowed from the Eternal."63 But we are meant, naturally, to be agapic: 'The 'essential,' the normative man, is thus a 'God-man' whose sacrificial love seeks conformity with, and finds justification in, the divine and eternal agape, the ultimate and final harmony of life with life."64 Niebuhr backs into his claims about the self-transcendence of human ideals by reflecting on the implications of our drive to self-giving love.65 For Niebuhr, we want these</page><page sequence="12">80 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics experiences of love; the consummation of our lives is found in such engagements with others. But these desires are strictly speaking not worldly warranted, but are "tangents toward the eternal" which find no home in the closed-circuit calculus of the saeculum. Hence, insofar as we rightly understand these experiences of self giving love to be genuinely self-giving, we are compelled to seek for a "supernatural" source, which we find in the primordial divine agape that creates, sustains, and redeems us. But the term "supernatural" is deeply misleading here. Niebuhr's project, like Augustine's, in fact subverts the whole language of natural versus supernatural. All is interpreted in terms of the theological motivations of human agency. As nothing is properly ours, there is no "natural" ethical reason to be quarantined from "local" truths of revelation. This explains Niebuhr's critique of natural law doctrines: Not only do such accounts fail to see how local and contingent is the putatively "universal" and "natural" law they promote, so that their "general principles are ... too inflexible on the one hand and their definition too historically conditioned on the other hand;" they also tend "to make the law of love an addendum to the natural law," and thereby make Christianity a particular motivation for conforming to the order of nature, rather than insisting that "the order of nature" is not a self-contained order at all, but instead ineliminably and pervasively related to God.66 There are no natural virtues quarantined from theological ones; all the virtues are rooted finally in caritas, the self-giving love that is God. This does not forbid us from appealing on extra-theological grounds to non Christians; it merely forbids such appeals from setting the theological agenda, for they are provisional accommodations, to be replaced where possible by first-order theological discourse.67 In realizing that such an adequate ground does exist, our temptations towards resigned indifference are shown to be mere temptations, and the realization that our motives are genuine motives, real longings for some higher harmony, can motivate us to struggle toward more such harmony. With John Milbank, Niebuhr's work presses towards "supernaturalizing the natural" rather than "naturalizing the supernatural."68 As Robin Lovin says, Niebuhr's work would suggest that "the problem with the contemporary affirmation of human finitude is not that it expects too much, but that it demands too little. Freedom ... depends on a critical self-awareness of the limitations of our perspective on events and on a creative effort to go beyond those limits, to imagine, and then to realize, new forms of social life that open new possibilities for freedom."69 This theological ressourcement of our love does not make us zealots, but rather mitigates our own anxieties about and pretensions to having firm foundations. In apprehending God's love for us as our salvation, we acknowledge that our desires for final synthesis are not rooted only in the realities of this world, and so we become less "grasping," less anxious about finding some "concrete" home.70 'The fulfillments of meaning in history will be the more untainted in fact, if purity is not prematurely claimed for them;"71 because there are no determinate limits to</page><page sequence="13">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself 81 our capacities, we must check ourselves lest our "ardor" lead us to destroy the world in order to save it, and it is wise for us to incorporate some such check into our practices. This attitude is expressed in Niebuhr's famous account of justice and love.72 The relation between the two terms is analogous to that between "nature" and "supernature," which is itself built upon the analogy between creation and grace. It is not simply a "two-tier" account of how one kind of private, theoretical motive can warrant a general, lowest common denominator form of public, practical consensus about justice; instead it works to subvert such accounts.73 While his account resists the simple application of "love" on the world, it remains in its deep structure a "love-ethic," promoting a project of "building up" from our local attachments to a proper moral comportment in all our dealings. As he says, "justice is an application of the law of love. The rules are not absolute but relative. They are applications of the law of love and do not have independence apart from it. They would be independent only if they were founded in an "essential" social structure ... [but] it is not possible to define an essential structure of community except the law of love."74 Justice, for Niebuhr, is not an external constraint on love, but rather is the self-limitation of love, the critical corrective love imposes upon itself in order to ensure that it does not overwhelm its object. This has two crucial implications for contemporary religious ethics. First, Niebuhr's account insists that ultimately our public morality cannot be defended by appeal to purely prudential considerations, as it almost always is in contemporary political theory.75 We are moral beings, in part naturally other regarding, and an adequate theory of justice will not ignore this fact. Justice cannot be anchored in our fears, but must be based on our loves; however risky that seems to some people, it is the only way it can be done. (Appeals to prudence only superficially support an ethic of respect in any event, while they more deeply corrode such ethics by reinforcing a consumerist attitude towards reality as a whole.) Niebuhr opposes all attempts at "ethics of inarticulacy," ethics which refuse to acknowledge our positive motives towards justice and which seek to quarantine those motives to the private realm.76 His rejection of such ethics is as crucial for moral epistemology as it is for moral psychology, for it entails that we need not jettison our particular reasons when we act in public, or conform our actions to some putatively universal canon of rationality. Form and content cannot come apart that way; the public and the private are neither ontologically primordial orders of creation, nor are they historically immutable; they are based upon what Sabina Lovibond calls "the metaphysics of commuter-land," the dichotomy of implicitly feminine emotional motivation with implicitly masculine neutral and dispassionate reason.77 Second, as Niebuhr's critique of natural law should make clear, the account makes justice a dynamic reality rather than a static achievement, and insists that we cannot rest complacent with any minimal conception of justice.78 This is not simply a request for more passion in political struggles for justice; it is more</page><page sequence="14">82 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics centrally a request for greater attention to how passion is always already operative in politics, both in motivating and in hindering justice. At any historical moment, the limits to the degree of justice we can reasonably expect are in all likelihood not because we do not love enough, but rather because we love other things too much; and while a wise Niebuhrian would resist desires for state control over our pursuits of happiness, she would equally demand a more serious and sustained public discussion of how the tragically partial forms of happiness that we overwhelmingly pursue become preeminent, and what we can do to escape their thrall.79 If any of this sounds optimistic, it isn't. But it is hopeful. And by understanding such matters we can make sense of the centrality of the virtue of hope to Niebuhr's thought. Not only is hope the last word in Niebuhr's The Nature and Destiny of Man, but it is also the virtue we today seem least to comprehend, and therefore apprehend. Niebuhr's account builds upon the reality of our inchoate sense of hope, and it seeks to deepen and sharpen that hope, to show us more clearly what our hope is of and what it is for, and how better we can cultivate it.80 We cannot equate hope with any simple expectation of things improving, as if we could expect some sort of moral correlation to the perpetual advance of some sort of quantified measure of "the quality of life" (as if sheer quantification would quiet anxieties about the permanence of progress).81 Nor is hope some sort of psychological superadditum, an optional appendix and/or extra to a properly formed set of Christian realist motivations, kind of like frosting on a block of ice. Nor is it a blind faith in some Peircian ideal-historical teleology, nor any sort of ultimate consequentialism, the preferential option for the eschaton in settling our problems with the unfairnesses of the world. Hope is none of these. Hope is about the future because it is an appreciation of the present, and particularly of the here-and-now presence of love, the appreciation of the fact that most everyone is trying to do good. That initially disconcerting and yet deeply hopeful fact also and simultaneously marks the depth of the problem. The real problem we face is not simple maliciousness, but our self-deceived self righteousness in pressing our own parochial and partial causes. Niebuhr places hope not primarily in the future, but rather in people—that they are unable totally to deceive themselves, that they are finally not wholly lost. This kind of hope is not sentimental; indeed, its reverse side is irony. By "irony" I do not mean Richard Rorty's gnostic knowingness, but rather the kind of irony elicited by the recognition that our actions are never entirely our own, and that we nonetheless must act—that our responsibility not only exceeds the horizon of our foreknowledge, but that that foreknowledge is itself not fully our own.82 The basic ethical program that this ironic recognition recommends is a program of acknowledging responsibility P This phrase has two components. First, we must acknowledge our responsibilities, "own up" to our actions and be accountable for them. But this is not a voluntarist or existentialist claim of taking possession of what was not one's own before one claimed responsibility for it;</page><page sequence="15">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself 83 one does not create but acknowledges what is already true.84 Indeed, "acknowledging responsibility" is not simply an ethical principle; it undergirds Niebuhr's project as a whole, for "Christian realism" is nothing more than the insistence that we must acknowledge responsibility for our understanding of our world as well as for our actions. This project is in deep communion with that of Reinhold's brother H. Richard; at its heart it is a recapitulation of Augustine's adage "love and do what you will."85 It is on this basic level of "acknowledging responsibility" that we see the real value of Niebuhr's proposal for contemporary Christian ethics, both apologetically and more centrally intra-traditionally. Apologetically, his work remains arguably the twentieth century's most thorough and searching theological reflection on the implications of sin and evil. We inhabit an age in which, as Andrew Delbanco has recently put it, "a gap has opened up between our awareness of evil and the intellectual resources we have for handling it."86 In this context Niebuhr's thought remains a touchstone of moral sanity, precisely because he insists that we have no intellectual resources for "handling" the gap, if "handling" it means managing it. Our thought is always torn open at its side, as it were, and bleeds from the knowledge that we sinners are at fault, and yet are the vehicles whereby God's salvation is made manifest. Niebuhr's gloss on the Cross is his proposal for acknowledging responsibility, which is always a cruciformed acknowledgment, always one that says there is no way to resurrection but through death. But this account does not end with the crucifixion; as was argued above, it offers a profoundly incarnational and participatory vision of Christian existence. We ought not understand the Christian life as a matter of extricating ourselves from some demonized and God-abandoned "world," but rather as a matter of accepting that God has chosen to redeem this world, and coming to participate in that redemption, most basically by being its primary site, just as we are the primary loci of creation's initial fall.87 We are not "resident aliens" so much as simply alienated—from ourselves, from our world, and from God—and we do not need further practices of estrangement (which are just another form of cheap grace), but ways of becoming less estranged. It is not that we need to escape the world; rather, we need to be fully in it, in the way that God is fully in it. Conclusion This essay has tried to work through something of the "collective unconscious" of contemporary Christian ethics. As such it is bound to meet with complex and partially contradictory resistances. Some will say that I have come to bury Niebuhr rather than to praise him. This is untrue; I have tried to argue that we can appropriate significant things from his thought without succumbing to some of its more prominent temptations—indeed, that the things we can</page><page sequence="16">84 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics appropriate can actually help us resist those temptations. Beyond that we can ask no more of him. We ought not wax nostalgic for Niebuhr's time. The providential confluence of audience, message, and setting which propelled Niebuhr's visage onto the covers of major newsmagazines is gone, and will not come again. Sufficient unto the day is the publicity thereof. Others will say I have erred in the opposite direction, and I ought to have rendered to Niebuhr the things that are Niebuhr's and to Augustine the things that are Augustine's (or, more honestly, mine). This too I think untrue. Niebuhr had his insights, some of them very helpful for our work; we do well to admit them, and to permit ourselves to follow the paths he beat out for us. All I have tried to do here is to see what, realistically speaking, survives of Niebuhr's work, and how we might use it today. He would expect no more, and he deserves no less. Each age has its distinctive vices, those errors to which, for reasons that it does not and perhaps cannot know, it is particularly prone.88 The vice of our age seems to be an excessive self-consciousness, an attempt to secure total knowing, a complete comprehension of reality, before acting in and upon it. It is reflected in our mania for naming things, for finding precise categories for everything, in order better to control them. So understood, it is a manifestation of superbia, the demand for total domination. In this context Niebuhr's work, which ill-fits all such frames, is easily misconstrued and twisted to fit any program; yet it is also, and for precisely that reason, particularly worthy of our attention. For his claim is that an excessive self consciousness is both futile and telling: futile, for our reach must always exceed our grasp, and we are always more implicated in the world than we can hope to comprehend; and telling, for it reveals our imperfect and suppressed knowledge of the impossibility of this comprehension in our very longing for it. Thus it seems fitting that, in the identity politics which occupies so much contemporary intellectual life, Niebuhr appears potentially in every camp liberal, neo-orthodox, dogmatic, revisionist, communitarian, liberationist, conservative—a target and an ally for all sides. But rather than allow any side to claim him, one suspects we ought to allow him the one label he never disclaimed as his own: Christian.

(See Stone, Reinhold Niebuhr: Prophet to Politicians (New York: University Press of America, 1980), 133-35), carried forward by Gary Dorrien in his very thoughtful Soul in Society: The Making and Renewal of Social Christianity (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1995), esp. pp. 141— 43 and 148-49. It helps here to make a distinction between theological liberalism and political progressivism; while Niebuhr's political commitments were thoroughly progressive, his basic commitment to the illuminative power of the Christian doctrine of sin, no matter how described, would trouble many classical religious liberals. 8 George Lindbeck, The Nature of Doctrine: Religion and Theology in a Postliberal Age (Philadelphia: The Westminster Press, 1984), 124. 9 "Our most reliable understanding is the fruit of "grace" in which faith completes our ignorance without pretending to possess its certainties as knowledge; and in which contrition mitigates our pride without destroying our hope."

Kegley and Robert W. Bretall, eds., Reinhold Niebuhr: His Religious, Social, and Political Thought (New York: Macmillan, 1961), 3. 16 Niebuhr was far more progressivist than conservative. Apart from Dorrien's Soul in Society, see Dennis McCann's Christian Realism and Liberation Theology: Practical Theologies in Creative Conflict (Maryknoll: Orbis Books, 1981), esp. Chapter Four. 17 The Nature and Destiny of Man, Vol. I: Human Nature (New York: Scribner's, 1941), 251. Hereafter referenced as NDM I. 18 For one example, see Franklin I. Gamwell's "Reinhold Niebuhr's Theistic Ethic," 63-84 in Nathan A. Scott, Jr., ed., The Legacy of Reinhold Niebuhr (Chicago: The University of Chicago Press, 1975). 19 I borrow this language from John Hick. See his Evil and the God of Love, Revised Ed. (San Francisco: Harper and Row, 1977), 281. 20 This is a somewhat misleading moniker; for Niebuhr, "general" revelation is "an overtone implied in all experience," the perpetual "testimony in the conscience of every person that his life touches a reality beyond himself, a reality deeper and higher than the system of nature in which he stands."(ADA/ I, 127) "Special" revelation, on the other hand, is the "positive" revelation of God to us, the content of which was slowly revealed in the salvation-history of the Israelites and reached its consummation in the revelation of Christ on the Cross. In short, "special" revelation clarifies the general senses apprehended in subjective existence with a special "word" made manifest in public history (see NDM I, 130). This account allows Niebuhr to develop positive support for his argument while not insisting or expecting it to be convincing to all his interlocutors. He is very certain that his system cannot be proven, but requires a subjective assent—faith—which may be warranted, or supported, by arguments and evidence from history, personal experience, etc.. I am using the word "warranted" in a way in which Niebuhr himself never does; but I do not think this does much violence to his argument. See NDM I, 141: "while the course of historical events does not inevitably yield the prophetic interpretation of events, it is significant that history does justify such an interpretation, once faith in the God of the prophets is assumed." (Emphasis mine.) For Niebuhr, reason and faith are not exclusive forms of enquiry; rather they complement one another. Reason is not wrong, it is simply insufficient. (See "Coherence, Incoherence, and the Christian Faith," in The Essential Reinhold Niebuhr, 235.) As should become clear, the present essay disputes precisely this epistemological claim, suggesting on the contrary that there is no clear distinction between particular faith and universal reason, and that all enquiry proceeds from first principles (which complement and render adequate the</page><page sequence="19">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself 87 minimal first principles of logic, etc.) which, while open to a kind of evaluation, are (in this world) never indisputable. 21 See NDM /, 250-51: "The actual sin is the consequence of the temptation of anxiety in which all life stands. But anxiety alone is neither actual nor original sin. Sin does not flow necessarily from it. Consequently the bias toward sin from which actual sin flows is anxiety plus sin. Or, in the words of Kierkegaard, sin presupposes itself. Man could not be tempted if he had not already sinned." Cf. NDM /, 254, 262 64. 22 "No matter how far back it is traced in the individual or the race, or even proceeding the history of the race, a profound scrutiny of the nature of evil reveals that there is an element of sin in the temptation which leads to sin; and that, without this presupposed evil, the consequent sin would not necessarily arise from this situation in which man finds himself." (From "Mystery and Meaning" in The Essential Reinhold Niebuhr, 245-46.) In this and similar passages Niebuhr invests evil with causal power, thereby reproducing Adam and Eve's sinful attempt to describe a causality with its first cause beyond them (i.e., in the serpent—see Gen. 3:12-13)—and in so doing rejects his putative Augustinian roots, as evil, for Augustine, has no genuine reality (and hence no causality) (see De Civitate Dei, XII.7 ff.). The problem is also rooted in a basic confusion, common to many thinkers in this tradition: the confusion of epistemology and ontology. (I have been much educated on this issue by Stanley Fish's discussion of Milton's manipulation, in Paradise Lost, of this (putatively universal) human phenomenon—of seeking a cause where none exists—to implicate the reader in Original Sin—or, rather, reveal the reader's prior implication in it. See Fish's Surprised by Sin: The Reader in Paradise Lost (Berkeley: The University of California Press, 1967); see esp. 256: "The Fall is no more an object of understanding than the prohibition it violates," (though I would contest the voluntarism implicit in the second half of this passage) and 259: "The reader who finds a cause for the Fall denies it by denying its freedom, and succumbs to still another form of Milton's 'good temptation.'" 23 See NDM I, 262-64 24 See Dietrich Bonhoeffer, Creation and Fall (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1997). 25 This can be a respected project; see Paul Ricoeur's attempt at faith "in spite of," in "Evil, a Challenge to Philosophy and Theology," 635-648 in The Journal of the American Academy of Religion LIII/3 (December 1985). This is not unconnected to Hume's account of faith as the primary miracle of the world. See his "Of Miracles," in his Enquiry Concerning Human Understanding, Section X. 26 On Niebuhr's vision of the world as "two-worldly" and implying a "pre Christian" eschatology see H. Richard Niebuhr, "Reinhold Niebuhr's Interpretation of History," 94, 98. 27 At least with regard to our knowledge of God. An anonymous reviewer pointed out that my argument is only that Niebuhr's thought is epistemologically pessimistic as regards knowledge of God; I agree, though it is only as regards knowledge of God that Niebuhr's epistemology can be reconstructed. I suspect this restriction is only</page><page sequence="20">The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics due to Niebuhr's never having elaborated a general epistemology. (But who would do that without a gun to their head?) 28 Here we see some of the worries that would later blossom into "postmodernist" critiques of the idea of God (see Mark C. Taylor, Erring: A Postmodern A/theology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984)), and of "presence" in general (see George Steiner, Real Presences (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1989)). It is interesting that deconstructionist "atheologies" have been recently accused of a fideism similar to Niebuhr's own; see Susan Wennemyr, "Dancing in the Dark: Deconstructive A/theology Leaps with Faith," 571-588 in Journal of the American Academy of Religion, Vol. 66, No. 3 (Fall 1998). This is a point at which matters of "the Gothic" might become very important as well; on this, see Mark Edmundson, Nightmare on Main Street: Angels, Sadomasochism, and the Culture of Gothic (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1997). 29 This is the issue over which Reinhold Niebuhr and his brother H. Richard Niebuhr part ways. For H. Richard, Reinhold misses the way that his account of the Deus absconditus loosens the world from God's providential control, which is a too high price to pay for making such sense of sin. (This reminds us again that God's providence was meant to be a doctrine of comfort.) See H. Richard Niebuhr, "Reinhold Niebuhr's Interpretation of History," 95-96, 100. 30 See William Schweiker, Mimetic Reflections (New York: Fordham University Press, 1990), and John of Damascus, On the Divine Images, trans, by David Anderson (Crestwood, NY: St. Vladimir's Seminary Press, 1980). 31 See Milbank, "A Critique of the Theology of Right," in The Word Made Strange. 32 See e.g. Franklin I. Gamwell's "Reinhold Niebuhr's Theistic Ethic." 33 See Rebekah Miles' excellent "Freeing Bonds and Binding Freedom: Reinhold Niebuhr and Feminist Critics on Paternal Dominion and Maternal Constraint," The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics 1996, 140. Miles' essay locates the crucial disagreement between feminist theologians and Niebuhr as rooted in confusions on both sides about the character of human agency. Part of this essay's task is to exploit the conflicting resources in Niebuhr about agency that Miles' essay identifies. 34 From "Experience," in Selections from Ralph Waldo Emerson, ed. Stephen E. Whicher (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1957), 271. Insofar as Emerson's "we" is construed in a pre-Freudian sense as a potentially fully transparent self-consciousness (n.b. this seems to be behind the common desire to be fully knowing). The phrase "a wilderness of mirrors" is from T. S. Eliot's "Gerontion," in The Collected Poems, 1909-1962 (New York: Harcourt, Brace &amp; World, 1970). 351 have nothing invested in restricting this understanding of human existence to "modem" thought; it seems more of a perennial temptation. 36 Though of course Tillich also wrote an essay about this epistemology (and used this quip, disarmingly, at the beginning of that essay); see his "Reinhold Niebuhr's Doctrine of Knowledge," 36-43 in Charles W. Kegley and Robert W. Bretall, eds., Reinhold Niebuhr: His Religious, Social, and Political Thought (New York: Macmillan, 1961), esp. 36: "The difficulty of writing about Niebuhr's epistemology</page><page sequence="21">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself 89 lies in the fact that there is no such epistemology. Niebuhr does not ask, 'How can I know?'; he starts knowing." 37 NDM 7,125. 38 This subjectivism is not greatly chastened by Niebuhr's insistence on the importance of God's "special revelation," for "special revelation" is only superficially a moment of God's activity: God's "special revelation" is realized or grasped by human faith, and must be "constantly apprehended inwardly by faith." (NDM II, 57) "Special" revelation is "special" not because of the epistemic mode by which it is apprehended, but by the particular content of what is apprehended. (Note Niebuhr's location of action in his analyses of these moments; "faith discerns." (NDM I, 136, my emphasis)) Niebuhr's account of "special" revelation really refers only to the historical specificity of the revelation; it is special, in the sense of particular, but it is only metaphorically revelation. Niebuhr's tradition insists that God's action is essential for human salvation, and so seems to necessitate some positive revelation of God, but Niebuhr's subjectivist commitments entail that humans must be themselves wholly responsible for their self-understanding, and his epistemology opts for the latter against the former. To gain knowledge of God, human subjects must act first, subjects who must ask questions and thereby enter into any kind of relation with God; it is human agents who must both realize its status as a question, and then grasp the special revelation which answers that question. Thus Niebuhr makes God's "special revelation" essentially a passive sort of "action" on God's part, an offering which neither breaks into the human's consciousness, nor is always already within it, but rather waits upon the human to apprehend it. This is where James Gustafson's implicit criticism of Niebuhr as offering a "theology in the service of ethics" has some bite. (See Gustafson's "Theology in the Service of Ethics.") 39 Robin Lovin, Reinhold Niebuhr and Christian Realism (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1995). 40 See Susan Hurley, Natural Reasons (New York: Oxford University Press, 1989), 383: "By becoming explicitly aware of the often implicit role and influence of theoretical considerations in our lives, we may be better able to demystify our own theoretical positions, recognize their proper limitations, and check their imperialistic ambitions. Theories are finally responsible to us, not we to them. Awareness of how deeply theories reflect us and the conflicts we face should, I hope, help us to put an end to the dangerous tendency to treat theories as religions .... Practical theorizing should take the form of thoughtful, workmanlike design and tinkering, and should accept as its starting point a generous conception of the conflicting values that are its subject matter. Theoretical reflexes ... are ultimately a sad category mistake." 41 Niebuhr's pragmatism makes this the basis of his critiques of others as much as it is for his positive articulation of his own work. Indeed, he is a dialectical thinker precisely in presenting his positive position through a detailed critique of others' failings: He advances his own position by demonstrating other accounts' failure to accommodate "all the facts," and defends his own position as more comprehensive, if possibly less logically tight, than their own.</page><page sequence="22">90 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics 42 Niebuhr's work here fits in well with recent developments in anti foundationalism in epistemology and theories of inquiry generally. For good examples of this, see Richard Foley, Working Without a Net: A Study in Egocentric Epistemology (New York: Oxford University Press, 1994), and Nancey Murphy, Theology in the Age of Scientific Reasoning (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1990). For a manifestation of this in ethical theory proper, see Rosalind Hursthouse's discussion of "anti-theory in ethics," 31-2 of her "Normative Virtue Ethics" in How Should One Uve? Essays on the Virtues, ed. Roger Crisp (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1996). 431 borrow the phrase "an enabling humility," and much of the thought behind it, from Jeredith Merrin's wonderful An Enabling Humility: Marianne Moore, Elizabeth Bishop, and the Uses of Tradition (New Brunswick, NJ: Rutgers University Press, 1990). 44 "Coherence, Incoherence, and the Christian Faith," in The Essential Reinhold Niebuhr. See also "Mystery and Meaning," 248: While the world and God will never be completely transparent to us, nonetheless "our faith cannot be identified with poetic forms of religion which worship mystery without any conception of meaning." 45 See Jonathan Lear, "Transcendental Anthropology," in Subject, Thought, and Context, ed. John McDowell and Philip Pettit (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1986). For a good analysis of anthropology as distinct from ethnography in this sense, see Dan Sperber's On Anthropological Knowledge (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1985), esp. Essay 1, "Interpretive Ethnography and Theoretical Anthropology." In arguing that we are, most fundamentally, beings who love, Niebuhr's position resonates with work in philosophical anthropology in the Twentieth Century, notably that of Heidegger, but also more recent work in Anglo-American philosophy on "the importance of what we care about" and the significance of value for orienting us in reality. For representative texts, see Harry G. Frankfurt, The Importance of What We Care About: Philosophical Essays (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1988); John McDowell, Mind and World (Cambridge MA: Harvard University Press, 1994); Jonathan Lear, Lave and its Place in Nature: A Philosophical Interpretation of Freudian Psychoanalysis (New York: Farrar, Strauss, &amp; Giroux, 1990); Hubert Dreyfus, Being-in-the-World: A Commentary on Heidegger's Being and Time, Division I (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1991); and Charles Taylor's Sources of the Self: The Making of Modern Identity (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1989). 46 Donald Meyer, in his The Protestant Search for Political Realism: 1919-1941, 2nd Ed. (Middletown CT: Wesleyan University Press, 1988), calls Niebuhr's magnum opus, The Nature and Destiny of Man, not so much a technical theology as "an exercise in philosophical psychology" ("Introduction to the Wesleyan Edition," xviii). An exemplary account of such an existential approach to understanding human psychology is R. D. Laing's The Divided Self: An Existential Study in Sanity and Madness (New York: Penguin, 1969), which employs an "existential phenomenology" as a psychological method, to investigate the contours of human personality in the world.

See also, famously, his "Augustine's Political Realism," in Christian Realism and Political Problems (New York: Charles Scribners' Sons, 1953). 481 have learned much from discussions on this with Franklin I. Gamwell. 49 NDMl, 203. 50 NDM I, 278-79. Emphasis Niebuhr's. 51 See Bonhoeffer's discussion of "Sicut Deus" in Creation and Fall. 52 NDM I, 252 See Bonhoeffer on having life "not as a gift but as a command," and how this is the essence of death, in Creation and Fall. 53 For an Eastern Orthodox correlate to this, see Jean D. Zizioulas's "Human Capacity and Human Incapacity: A Theological Exploration of Personhood," 401 448 in the Scottish Journal of Theology, Vol. 28 (1975), esp. 444-45, where he discusses the light this idea throws upon the claim that hell is eternal torment: "personhood as demonic will be eternally 'tortured' by the very ontological fact that the choice of annihilation, of the rejection that is of the given world, will be unrealisable." I thank Aristotle Papanikolaou for calling my attention to this essay. 54 For Niebuhr's analysis of this, see especially his The Nature and Destiny of Man, Volume I: Human Destiny (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1942), 278. This is, of course, one of Augustine's points, in his analysis of the preconversion soul (see Confessions VIII.ix-xi). On this account the self never in fact separates itself from God, but merely attempts to do so; it is inappropriate to spatialize sin, it must be presented as a dynamic attempt at alienation. This is why activity is emphasized here; and once again one can see Augustine as the central theological source. See Gerald O'Daly's Augustine's Philosophy of Mind (Berkeley: University of California Press, 1987), esp. 2: "It is distinctive of Augustine's thought that he approaches psychological questions through an elucidation of man's perceptive and cognitive activities." See also Walter H. Principe, C. S. B., "The Dynamism of Augustine's Terms for Describing the Highest Trinitarian Image in the Human Person," 1291-99 in Studia Patrística Vol XVII, Part Three (New York: Pergamon Press, 1982). For an interesting parallel, see John Milbank on the interiority of the subject (in "The Force of Identity," The Word Made Strange, 206-7). 55 The classic account of this is found in De Civitate Dei XVIII.28. 56 For an insightful discussion of these disputes, see Dorrien's Soul in Society, 152-55. Niebuhr's own words late in his life: "When I find neo-orthodoxy turning into sterile orthodoxy or a new Scholasticism, I find that I am a liberal at heart." (in "The Quality of Our Lives," Christian Century 77 (May 11, 1960), 568 (cited in Dorrien, Soul in Society, 143)). But this does not mean that Niebuhr repudiated his earlier explicit critique of liberalism; as late as 1961 he was still railing against what he saw as the naive liberal view of the human situation (see Niebuhr's comments in his response to Henry Nelson Wieman, 446-49 in Reinhold Niebuhr: His Religious, Social, and Political Thought). 57 See Lovin, Reinhold Niebuhr and Christian Realism, 189.</page><page sequence="24">92 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics 58 The work of Hannah Arendt is still unsurpassed in helping us here; see especially The Human Condition (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1958) and her Lectures on Kant's Political Philosophy, ed. by Ronald Beiner (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1982). 59 See his Moral Luck (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1981), esp. li li,. 60 "Religion and Action," 64, 63 61 See Jonathan Lear, Love and its Place in Nature. 62 NDMII, 84, 247, 251. Niebuhr's position here is interestingly similar to Oliver O'Donovan's critique of "Jesuology" on 120-22 in his The Desire of the Nations (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1996), though O'Donovan (like others) associates Niebuhr purely with the criticism of idealism and misses the positive picture of agape underpinning that critique. 63 NDM II, 84 64 Ibid., 81 65 Obviously Niebuhr's work here is not very developed, relative to the enormous about of debate in recent decades on the topic of "the gift." But I think his account is deeply interesting and has much support in contemporary discussions. 66 "Reply to Interpretation and Criticism" in Reinhold Niebuhr: His Religious, Social, and Political Thought, 435. See also NDM I, 281. Here I must disagree with Keith Ward ("Reinhold Niebuhr and the Christian Hope," 82), and insist that Niebuhr is critical of "natural law" accounts for good reason. 67 Pace some "cultural-linguistic" theologians, this is not just a grammatical remark about the rules of this language-game, made for pragmatic purposes; we say this because it is true. For Niebuhr's own use of such discourse, see "The King's Chapel and the King's Court," in Reinhold Niebuhr: Theologian of Public Life, ed. Larry Rasmussen (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1991). 68 See Milbank's Theology and Social Theory. 69 Lovin, Reinhold Niebuhr and Christian Realism, 139. 70 This is an important point at which the "use'Y'enjoyment" distinction gains relevance; I mention it only in passing here. 71 NDM II, 213. 72 Niebuhr actually distinguishes two distinct projects of human moral existence which need to be chastened by an awareness of their own impurity, one of which is the direct struggle for justice, while the other is "the quest for truth" and "the achievement of just and brotherly relations," or "the struggle for justice:" "These two categories comprise the cultural and the socio-moral problems of history. "{NDM II, 213) Within the epistemological sphere this takes the shape of a dialectic between the claims of truth and the necessities of tolerance, a dialectic which affirms the need of toleration in order for all to seek and more fully apprehend the truth, yet which does so essentially from an insistence on the importance of that truth for human existence. For support of Niebuhr's stance here, see Gordon Graeme, "Tolerance, Pluralism, and Relativism," 44—59 in David Heyd, ed., Tolerance: An Elusive Virtuel (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1996), and Charles T. Mathewes, "Pluralism,</page><page sequence="25">Reading Reinhold Niebuhr Against Himself 93 Otherness, and the Augustinian Tradition" in Modern Theology 14: 1 (January 1998): 83-112. 73 See Ward, 85. Lovin himself, whose argument about Niebuhr's concept of love and justice has decisively shaped my own, can seem at times to verge on something like this conclusion. See p. 231 where he argues that, despite "theoretical differences" between Niebuhr's position and "contemporary liberal theories" such as John Rawls, the "practical effect" is almost the same. Lovin's argument here may be read as assuming a division between theory and praxis that we have good reason to doubt and that, on my account, Niebuhr need not affirm (see Charles Pinches, "On Form and Content in Christian Ethics," Sophia, 26:1 (March 1987), 4-14). 74 "Reply to Interpretation and Criticism," 435-36 in Reinhold Niebuhr: His Religious, Social, and Political Thought. 75 Or at least many common conceptions of prudential. 76 For more on this, see Charles Taylor's Sources of the Self, Ch. 3, "The Ethics of Inarticulacy," and Jennifer Herdt's "Cruelty, Liberalism, and the Quarantine of Irony: Rorty on the Disjunction Between Public and Private," Soundings LXXV #1 (Spring 1992): 79-96. 77 All of this only begins to gesture at how the vectors of Niebuhr's thought might intersect with the recent important discussions of "deliberation," and hence participation, as crucial democratic energies in political theory. For representative texts, see Democracy and Disagreement, ed. Carol Gutmann and Dennis Thompson (Cambridge, MA: Belknap Press, 1996), Deliberative Democracy: Essays on Reason and Politics, ed. James Bohman and William Rehg (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1997), and Deliberative Democracy, ed. Jon Elster (New York: Cambridge University Press, 1998). This last contains some compelling criticisms of deliberation as a model, both formally (see esp. "Deliberation as Discussion," by James Fearon), and materially (see esp. "Pathologies of Deliberation," by Susan C. Stokes). See also Lynn Sanders, "Against Deliberation," forthcoming in Political Theory. nNDM II, 245. See also 244: "No fixed limits can be placed upon either the purity or the breadth of the brotherhood for which men strive in history." 79 See William T. Cavanaugh, "Disney and Augustine on Coercion," paper presented at a panel on "Ethics of Disney, Inc.," at the 1998 American Academy of Religion; also Juliet Schor, The Overspent American (New York: Basic Books, 1997). 80 Again, see Gilkey's excellent "Reinhold Niebuhr's Theology of History" on this. 8lSee Amartya Sen and Martha Nussbaum, The Quality of Life (New York: Oxford University Press, 1993). 82 See, of course, Niebuhr's The Irony of American History (New York: Scribner's, 1962). There is a deep connection between the doctrine of Providence and the concept of irony here, which I mention only to note it merits further reflection. 83 See Lear, Love and Its Place in Nature, Ch. Six and Seven on "Accepting Responsibility." 84 Kathryn Tanner argues that the idea of definite limits on human action as such is inherently anti-progressive. (See her "A Theological Case for Human</page><page sequence="26">94 The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics Responsibility in Moral Choice," 592-612 in The Journal of Religion 73 (1993).) In contrast, Mark Platts argues that we need not mark our moral beliefs for special attention in terms of our "responsibility" for them, for they are in all relevant ways structurally similar to all beliefs we have that putatively make realist claims about the way the world is (see his Ways of Meaning, 2nd Edition (Cambridge: MIT Press, 1997), 253). 85 Tractatus in Epistolam Iohannis, partially reprinted as "Ten Homilies on the First Epistle General of St. John," in Augustine: Later Works, trans. John Bumaby (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1955), vii.8, 316. See De moribus ecclesiae catholicae, xv and xxv. For Niebuhr, see The Irony of American History, 63: "Nothing that is worth doing can be achieved in our lifetime; therefore we must be saved by hope. Nothing which is true or beautiful or good makes complete sense in any immediate context of history; therefore we must be saved by faith. Nothing we do, however virtuous, can be accomplished alone; therefore we are saved by love. No virtuous act is quite as virtuous from the standpoint of our friend or foe as it is from our standpoint. Therefore we must be saved by the final form of love which is forgiveness." 86 Andrew Delbanco, The Death of Satan: How Americans Have Lost the Sense of Evil (NY: Farrar, Strauss, Giroux, 1995), 3. See also Edmundson's Nightmare on Main Street, and Karen Halttunen's wondrous Murder Most Foul: The Killer and the American Gothic Imagination (Cambridge, MA: Harvard University Press, 1998). 87 This would be a good place to talk about Niebuhr's understanding of the church. I avoid this discussion only because there is a great deal to say. There is something to the worry that Niebuhr's church was America. But Niebuhr does not think that churches are ontologically different from any other human association; Christ is as present, and as governing, outside the church as within it. Niebuhr, as I am reading him, has a high Christology and what we may call a low ecclesiology. This does not entail an assumption that Niebuhr thought—let alone that Niebuhr's thought (in the form in which I have commended it here) compels us to think—that the churches are irrelevant to salvation; it is just that they may not be as different from the world as we might like to think. Eschatology does include a "not yet" alongside the "already." 88 So Alasdair Maclntyre: "Every culture is characterized in part by what it conceals and obscures from view, by what its habits of mind prevent it from acknowledging and appropriating. We err therefore in so largely, sometimes exclusively writing the history of ideas, of science, of art, of culture in general in terms of positive achievement. Culture is present also in failure and it can in crucial respects blind the educated to what needs to be seen. So it was with the failure to understand the work of Aquinas in the late Middle Ages. So perhaps it may be with us." p. 169 in Three Rival Versions of Moral Enquiry: Encyclopaedia, Genealogy, and Tradition (Notre Dame: University of Notre Dame Press, 1990). I am grateful to Diane Yeager for helping me begin to see this (as well as other related issues) some time ago.</page></plain_text>
