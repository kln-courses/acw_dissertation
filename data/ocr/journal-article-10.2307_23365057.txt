By the time Glikl used this passage, it had acquired a defiant conno tation. It had come to signify the Jewish explanation for a seemingly irrational hope in the face of persistent and pointed mockery.

One of the earliest mockeries of this passage ap pears in sixteenth century convert Antonius Margaritha's Der gantz Jüdisch Glaub (The Entire Jewish Faith).4 Son and grandson of rabbinic luminaries of fifteenth century Ashkenaz, Margaritha devoted his mag num. opus to revealing Jewish traditions to the Christian world in the most derisive and contemptuous light. No belief of the Jews provided better grist for the mill of Margaritha, his precursors, and emulators, than the Jewish belief in the messiah yet to come. For medieval Christians, the messianic prophecies had been fulfilled long ago in the person of their redeemer. The long duration of Jewish hopes in a future messiah was explained as the result of innate Jewish obstinacy, spiritual blindness, and even a sign that the devil had van quished their reason. German folk-tradition often represented the devil or evil spirits in the form of an ape, an accursed and inverse image of man.5 By referring to their cherished hope in this particular form, 'the golden ape', Christians were taunting a belief that went to the very heart of the Jewish-Christian divide.6 This interplay between Jewish sustenance and Christian mockery of Jewish messianic hopes is emblematic of the tension which existed for Jews living in the Christian world. It was a theme of the great Spanish disputations, essentially staged polemics with predetermined out comes.

Many Spanish and Portuguese Jews settled in the Ottoman Empire which granted conditions that seemed magnanimous and tolerant by compar ison with the Christian world. These two cultural worlds form the set ting for the discussion of Jewish messianic posture to follow. I Classical Jewish scholarship has endowed the two preeminent Jewish cultural communities, the Ashkenazic (Jews whose predominant cultural influence in the medieval period was the Franco-German sphere) and the Sephardic (those whose primary cultural influence was the Spanish sphere) with distinctive messianic postures. In an essay written some thirty years ago, and published four times, distinguished scholar and historian Gerson Cohen mapped out an elegant and influential set of typologies. In the essay, 'Messianic Postures of Ashkenazim and Sephardim׳, Cohen characterized Ashkenazim as messianically quietistic, passive, with a penchant for martyrdom, and portrayed Sephardim as active, dynamic and revolutionary.7 It should be mentioned at the outset, parenthetically, that while Co hen never drew lines to the more contemporary resonances of his cate gories, notions of Jewish passivity and military activism as responses to persecution have taken on new meaning in this century. The pain filled polemics over Jewish responses during the Holocaust and the val ues of Zionism form a silent subtext to any discussion of Jewish activ ism and passivity. Cohen's thesis was one of those far reaching programmatic state ments that influenced all subsequent discussions of Jewish messianism.8 G. Cohen, 'Messianic Postures of Ashkenazim and Sephardim', Leo Baeck Memorial Lecture, 9 (1967); Studies of the Leo Baeck Institute, ed. M.

These include the con cepts active and passive, the definitions of popular and elite, and even the application of Sephardic and Ashkenazic as historical explanations rather than as cultural markers. I want to address each of these issues briefly before proceeding to a central problem in Cohen's thesis, the nature and limitations of the historical evidence. To his description of Sephardic messianism, Cohen prefixed the ad jective ׳revolutionary׳ and even the startling expression, 'aggressive military action'. The Jews of Ashkenaz ostensibly provide the starkest contrast to this heroic and active profile. 'Quiescence and passivity had somehow so permeated the whole mentality of that community [Franco-German Jewry] as virtually to eliminate such aggressive be havior'.10 In Ashkenaz, from the date of Palestine's downfall through the seventeenth century, violent apocalypse replaced action, subli mated it; 'These attitude and posture were doubtless conveyed to all parts of the Diaspora over which the academies of the Holy Land exer History: The Myth and the Reality', Jewish History and Jewish Destiny, New York and Jerusalem 1997, pp. 183-212) was not a scholarly presentation and not nearly as influential. It presented a sweeping and dismissive re-evaluation of his earlier essay as well as the entire historical enterprise that has accepted Jewish messianism as an active reality. The influence of these typologies has penetrated deeply. See most recently: S. Eidelberg, 'Gilgulav shel ha-Ra'ayon ha-Meshihi bein Yehudei Germania', in: S. Nash (ed.), Bein Historia le-Sifrut: Sefer Yovel le-Yizhak Barzilai, Tel Aviv 1997, p. 25: 'It is well known that in the history of Jews in medieval Germany there are not to be found appearances of redeemers and messiahs'. The controversial essay by I.J. Yuval, 'Ha-Nakam ve-ha-Kelalah, ha-Dam ve-ha-'Alilah', Zion, 58 (1993), pp. 33-90, took Cohen's essay as its point of departure, see esp. pp. 33,59. A statement concerning a work from the medieval Judeo-Arabic world by historian M.R. Cohen, Under Crescent and Cross: The Jews in the Middle Ages, Princeton 1994, is another example of how deeply the typology has penetrated: 'The anecdotes are replete with depictions of classic, Ashkenazic-like responses to suffering: fasting, prayer, and chronicling of events for posterity' (p. 188), as though these 'passive' reactions to suffering were not universal human, as well as Jewish, reactions to suffering.

In fact, the clash or disintegration of great em pires always generated messianic activity among Jews both in the Mus lim and the Christian worlds. Messianic movements were recorded from the late fifth and sixth centuries, all apparently in anticipation of a confrontation between the Byzantine and Persian Empires. One occurred in Crete and three in Palestine, among the Samaritans. But even if we begin our discussion with the messianic figures that arose within the world of Islam, we may ask whether there was even one Jewish medieval messianic movement which can legitimately be characterized as an aggressive, bona fide 'mil itary׳ movement. The movements which were so valorized in the influ ential essay by Cohen were disorganized, unarmed, often led by de luded visionaries. Cohen himself acknowledged this in a later essay.12 Cohen constructed an opposition between messianism and martyr dom: the first symbolizing active rebellion against history, the latter passive resignation.13 Martyrdom was never alien to the Sephardic world, nor messianism to the Ashkenazic, and neither accounted mar tyrdom as an expression of passivity.14 As the Jewish crusade chronicles graphically depicted, martyrdom was a last resort when every other 11 Ibid., p. 221. 12 See the excellent discussion of ׳The Jewish Messiahs of Early Islam', in S.M. Wasserstrom, Between Muslim and Jew: The Problem of Symbiosis in Early Islam, Princeton 1995, pp. 47-89. The most active and popular of these Jewish 'uprisings' at its most militantly confrontational moment, was described as follows: 'They claimed that when he was embattled he made a line around his followers with a myrtle stick, saying, "Stay behind this line and no enemy will reach you with weapons". [...] then Abu Isa went beyond that line, alone and on horseback, and fought and killed many Muslims [...] When he fought against the followers of Mansur at Rayy, he and his companions were killed' (p. 76). Cohen's characterization, see above note 8, p. 197. 13 See: G. Scholem, Major Trends in Jewish Mysticism, New York 1973, pp. 87-89; J. Dan, 'Gershom Scholem and Jewish Messianism', in: P. Mendes-Flohr (ed.), Gershom Scholem: The Man and His Work, New York 1994, pp. 75-78. Nineteenth century Jewish historiography tended to link mysticism and messianism as forcible eruptions into the generally rational Jewish psyche under extreme catas trophic pressure. 14 On typologies of Sephardic martyrdom, see most recently M. Bodian, 'Ha-'Aliya al ha-Moked shel Nozerim Hadashim be-Einei Benei ha-Umah ha-Portugalit', Pe'amim, 75 (1998), pp. 47-62." ף5]</page><page sequence="6">Elisheva Carlebach [6 active form of resistance had failed. Yet in his description of Ashkenazic death at the hands of Christians, Cohen writes of a passive martyrdom which simply does not accord with any remaining accounts. For exam pie, while Cohen agreed that during the Chmielnicki pogroms in Po land, Jews had no choices because the Cossacks were determined to kill them all, they elected 'to die passively׳ at the hands of their attackers.15 Cohen linked the question of activism and pacifism to that of elite vs. popular messianic movements. In this construction, Ashkenazic quiet ism is 'rabbinic, elite', while Sephardic activism is 'popular ׳. The grand role in Jewish messianism of Sephardic rabbinic conservatism, from the Geonim to Maimonides through Jacob Sasportas simply did not enter into Cohen's neat typology.16 In the Sephardic communities of Geonic Babylonia and of medieval Spain, home to great Jewish population con centrations, messianic movements often took on anti-establishment, anti-rabbinic character. In Ashkenaz, movements with a messianic character were often led by the elite, the rabbis themselves, and so were of a more profound and thoroughgoing nature. In classical Ashkenazic culture, the practice of the God-fearing community carried the same weight as a sacred rabbinic text. When the rabbinic teachers, the tosafists, found contradictions between a text of the Talmud and the practice of the community, the Talmud was reinterpreted.17 In such communities, can it be as relevant to talk of anti-rabbinic animus as in Geonic Babylonia? In the smaller communities of medieval Ashkenaz there was a completely different communal configuration which gave rise to different conceptions of leadership which have little bearing on messianic postures.18 Cohen, p. 224.

The movements on the fringes of seventh century Persia were so different from the rarefied atmosphere of the rational courtiers of Andalusia and their mathemat ical messianic calculations, as to arouse questions concerning the use fulness of the rubric Sephardic for both. Differences in liturgy are not valid categories of historical causality Even the use of the cultural paradigms Ashkenaz and Sepharad as indicators of sweeping historical postures can be questioned. Imported from the world of custom and liturgy, 'nusakh' and 'minhag', Cohen argued that 'What was true of halakhah, philosophy, liturgy, poetry and Hebrew style had its counterpart in messianic posture and expression as well19.׳ The constructs Ashkenaz-Sepharad as two absolutely distinct cultural-geographic units is constantly being reassessed. The cultural boundaries were not nearly as impermeable as was once thought. Mu tual cultural influences, although they took time to interpenetrate, of ten affected the very core of what we perceive as Ashkenazic or Sephar die.20 Certain regions, such as Provence and parts of Italy, served as centers of continuous cultural overlap.21 The two earliest anti-Christian polemics to be written in Christian countries - 'Milhamot ha-Shem' by relying on traditions of their forefathers; in Sephardic stories, they are outside the community and rely on their own talents.

I want to turn to consideration of another aspect of the comparative dimension of Jewish messianism: the reporting, chronicling and com mitment to collective memory of Jewish messianic episodes, and the role of such memory in the shaping of subsequent messianic activities.26 Did Jewish societies record their memories in markedly different ways, depending on whether their milieu was Christian or Muslim? Historian Mark Cohen has argued that Jewish chroniclers in Christian lands tended to center on the memory of persecution so that it became the defining characteristic of their exilic experience, whereas Jewish chron iclers within Islamic lands tended to bury accounts of persecution of Jews, along with reports about the suffering of local Muslims and larger political events. It was the persistence and centrality of the memory of persecution, rather than the objective number and severity of the occur D.

It would have to contain decisive vengeance against these hideous oppressors.28 A recent study of the transforma tion of one sixteenth century historiographical text, the Shevet Yehudah, as it passed from its original Sephardic milieu to Ashkenazic readers, exemplifies brilliantly the process of cultural and literal translation that reshaped its message.29 Theologically sensitive material was simply ed ited out and chapters depicting conversion to Christianity, a central ex perience of Spanish and Portuguese Jews in the early modern period, were excised. While such an explicit and specific example of editorial reinvention may be more difficult to locate for other cases, it provides a vivid reminder of the constant process of revision and editing that rendered collective memories suitable for their intended milieu. II A comparison of the way Ashkenazic Jews recorded and remembered expressions of Jewish messianism within the Christian milieu, with memories among Sephardic Jews of those same events, demonstrates that there was a sharp division in the way each cultural cluster transmitted memories of messianic activism. If we juxtapose the historiographical treatment of two central messianic movements in the sixteenth century, a time in which there was both a relatively rich historiography, and considerable messianic activity, this discrepancy becomes conspicuous.30 In the discussion which follows, I am not primarily concerned with sifting the actual historical details of the Cohen (above note 9), pp. 186-199.

It seems to me that Cohen's contention in 'Messianism in Jewish History' (above note 8), that sixteenth-century messianism differed radically from its predecessors is tendentious, if the criterion is open political activism.

I am interested here in the subsequent memory of the events as they were preserved by the respective Jewish chroniclers. The first Jewish messianic movement of the sixteenth century came at the very beginning of that century, when a Jew of German descent, Asher Lemlein of Reutlingen, appeared in Istria, near Venice. Reports concerning the details of his messianic activities differ. Most agree that at the very least, he announced tidings of the messiah.31 Renaissance Italian Jew Abraham Farissol was an eyewitness to the movement of Lemlein. He described Lemlein as an 'Ashkenazi who had pretensions, saying, "I will wie". Wth his little wisdom and the few actions that he undertook, and with the mediation of his disciples, he misled the entire region, concerning the coming of the redeemer, and he let it be heard that he [the redeemer] had already come׳. Farissol also mentioned the in tense movement of penitence that Lemlein's movement had inspired.32 Among Ashkenazim, the movement was recorded in the historical chronicle of David Gans, Zemah David, published in Prague in the late sixteenth century: Rabbi Lemmlen announced the advent of the messiah in the year 1500/1, and his words were credited throughout the dispersion of Israel. Even among the Gentiles, the news spread and many of them also believed his words. My grandfather Seligman Gans z"l smashed the special oven in which he baked matzzot, being firmly convinced that the next year, he would bake matzzot in the Holy Land. And I, the writer, heard from my old teacher, R. Eliezer Trivash, head of the Bet din in Frankfurt, that the matter was not without basis, and that he had shown signs and proofs, but that perhaps because of our sins he [the messiah] was delayed.33 For Lemlein's writings, see: E. Kupfet 'Hezyonotav shel R. Asher b. R. Meir ha-Mekhuneh Lemlein Reutlingen', Kobez al Yad, vol. 8, no. 18 (1975), pp. 385-423; D. Tamar, 'On R. Asher Lemlein', Zion, 52 (1987), pp. 399-401.

[״10]</page><page sequence="11">11 ] The Sabbatian Posture of German Jewry Several points in Gans' account ate worth noting. First, that Gans characterized Lemlein as a herald of the messiah, not as the messiah. Second, that Gans described in personal and poignant terms the very profound reaction to this messianic tiding within both popular circles - his grandfather the matzah baker - as well as among the scholarly elite - his rabbi. Clearly, this movement struck very deep chords among Ashkenazic Jews who heard the tidings. An anonymous chronicle from Prague in the early seventeenth cen tury contains this entry for 1502: 'News came of the messianic king, causing massive repentance among the many communities of Israel'.34 In this report Lemlein was apparently remembered as a messianic fig ure. He stimulated a very widespread penitential reaction, although the entry is so terse that the meaning of the phrase 'news came׳ is obscure. If we turn to Sephardic chroniclers of this event, a more painful per spective emerges. In his Shalshelet ha-Kabbalah (Chain of Tradition), pub lished in Italy in the late sixteenth century, Gedaliah ibn Yahia reported: 'When the man [Lemlein] died and the messiah had not come, it caused many conversions, because when the fools saw that the messiah hadn't arrived, they apostatized immediately35.׳ Significantly, this incident was not recorded by Ibn Yahia as an inher ently interesting and important event. Rather, it was related as a high light in the life of Daniel Bömberg, the Christian printer of early He brew books. Chronicler Yoseph Ha-Kohen similarly had no kind words to spare for the ׳Ashkenazi, an evil prophet, a confused man of spirit׳, to whom the Jews streamed, saying, 'God has sent him to rule over his people Israel, he will gather in the dispersed of Judah from the four corners of the earth36.׳ A.

Many of the sinners of Israel [apostates] repented of their evil ways, but they were immersed in mighty waters and came up empty handed, as a result of sins, as occurred in our own day, as a result of sins.38 Sambari too mentioned the episode of Lemlein in the context of the Sabbatian messianic movement of his own times, rather than an inherently significant event. Lemlein is the only Ashkenazic messianic figure to appear in Sambari. Both ibn Yahia and Sambari linked the failure of messianic move ment to its polemical consequences within the Christian context, par ticularly the conversions to Christianity in its wake. Both Ashkenazic chroniclers were careful to avoid mentioning this aspect. Sambari noted the power of the movement to temporarily reverse the course of recent converts from Judaism to Christianity. When the movement failed, many more converted to Christianity. Sambari hinted to voices of re sistance to Lemlein's message during the height of the movement. Reactions to Lemlein reverberated beyond the Jewish community. Jo hannes Pfefferkorn, notorious convert to Christianity, recalled the strife among the Jews of Halle in the wake of the Jewish Messiah 'Lemmel׳ and urged the Jews in his Speculum adhortationis iudaice ad Christum (Mirror of exhortation of Jews to Christianity) to recognize the true messiahship of Christ. He noted that 'we' Jews were often swindled, and played the incident to the greatest polemical advantage.39 Yosef Sambari, Sefer Divrei Yosef, ed.

Almost a whole year, young and old, children and women did penance in those days, the like of which had never been seen before. And in spite of it all there appeared neither sign nor vestige, not to speak of the reality itself. For how did that repentance of 1502 help you, when all Jews in their habitations and places in exile [...] young and old, infants and women, repented as never before and nothing was revealed to you[.] [The result was] You Jews [too] see and understand that your rabbis are confused and wrong.40 Johannes a Lent, author of the seventeenth century 'list' that was to become the canonical reference work on Jewish false messiahs, devoted a very substantial section to Lemlein, exceeding all prior descriptions of the movement in length.41 It consisted of several reports by Jewish (Ganz and ibn Yahya), non Jewish (Genebrardus), and convert (Isaac Levita) sources, along with Lent's introduction and translations from the Hebrew. In both Lent's introduction to the section, as well as in the excerpts from Genebrardus and Levita, Lemlein is described as a Totissimum autem id fecerunt anno mundi q-n quies millesimo ducentesimo sexagesimosecundo, qui fuit annus Christi 1502. quando omnes Iudaei fecerunt publicam poenitentiam per omnes habitationes suas, in omnibus terris Si per totam captivitatem, [...] fere, per integrum annum, tarn pueri quam senes, peruuli fe mulieres, qualis poenitentia nunque retroactis seculis audita est: earn autem fecerunt pro adventu Meschiae.

His own writings show him to have been something of a champion of Ashkenazic culture and contemptuous of the Sephardic, apparently in resentment of the newly arrived refugees from Spain that entered Italy.45 The historiography of the movement thus differed considerably depending on who was doing the reporting. It would be even more instructive to compare the reports by Ashke nazim and Sephardim of a messianically charged event that occurred within the fuller light of history. David Reubeni appeared in 1522 claim ing to represent the Lost Tribes of Israel, with a scheme to liberate the Jews in the Diaspora.46 Armed with an offer to provide an army against Lent, ibid., p. 70: 'se pro Messia venditavit Rabbi Lemlem Judaeus Germanus'. Genebrardus: ׳Quidam Iudaeus nomine Lemlem, imposuit quibusdam (credo in Germania) se esse verum Christum, quem exspectabant'. Aescoly, in a brief translation (Ha-Tenu'ot ha-Meshihiyot, p. 331), did not convey the full polemical sting of Levita's wonds. Levita translated Maimonides' epistle on astrology into Latin, and introduced the epistle with the following paragraph on Lemlein, probably because the epistle ended with the consideration of a report of a messianic movement among the Jews of Yemen. The relevant text of the epistle, see: lggerot ha-Rambam, II, ed. Y. Shilat, Jerusalem 1988, p. 479: 'Tandem Lemlem Pseudo-messias, aliis propheta, periit, nusquamque magis apparuit, cum antea conquestus esset, impoenitentiam Judaeorum adventum Messiae retardare.

In Portugal he attracted the attention of Diego Pires, a Marrano who cir cumcised himself and took the name Shlomo Molkho. In 1532 they trav elled together to Regensburg to meet Emperor Charles V. Molkho was ultimately burned at the stake in Mantua; Reubeni met his end in a Spanish prison.47 In addition to their own writing, or that produced by their camps, Reubeni and Molkho occupied center stage in several of the chronicles written by Sephardic Jews in the sixteenth century, particularly Joseph ha-Kohen and Gedaliah ibn Yahya. Joseph ha-Kohen reported: ׳And a shoot went forth from Portugal, his name was Shlomo Molkho', a dis tinctly messianic introduction to Molkho within a lengthy account of Reubeni and Molkho's activities.48 The seventeenth century chronicler Yosef Sambari of Egypt wove their accounts together and created one unified chronicle49 His account was far lengthier than any previous re port of a failed messianic figure.50 It begins with the story of Shlomo Molkho 'who proclaimed himself the messiah׳, and David 'Chief of staff for the messiah׳. Sambari stated unambiguously from the begin ning that Molkho was regarded as a messiah. Reubeni introduced holy names, flags and the shield of 'king David' intended for use to fight the wars of God. Since the Reubeni/Molkho adventure was widely known and recounted, those contemporaries who passed over it in silence or with very minimal notice must have chosen that path deliberately. Molkho's sojourn in Regensbuig in 1532, to request permission to draft Jews into his battle against the Turks, left a deep and lasting im pression on the German Jews. Josel of Rosheim, spokesman for German Jewry in the first half of the sixteenth century, recorded in his chronicle: 'There came [to Regensburg] that speaker of a foreign tongue [lo'ez], the righteous convert called R. Shlomo Molka [sic], may he rest in peace, with alien doctrines [de'ot hizoniyot] to arouse the emperor by are still unknown but that possibility seems unlikely. See the bibliography cited in A.

Sambari's account of the Sabbatai Zevi period was excised from the manuscript in all extant copies. A later copyist inserted the Sabbatian section from Tobias Kohen's Ma'aseh Tovia, editio princeps Venice 1707, chapter 1, part 6. [״15]</page><page sequence="16">Elisheva Carlebach [ 16 saying that he had come to call all Jews to war against the Turks51.׳ Josel then wrote that he had sent a letter imploring Molkho to desist from his plan; when that failed he left the city so as not to be associated by the Emperor with the schemes of Molkho.52 He concluded his entry by de scribing Molkho as having died the death of a martyr, and having caused many Jews to repent.53 Josel's report is remarkable, both for what it contains as well as for what it omits. The word as well as the concept of messiah are totally absent from his account. He characterized Molkho as one who es poused alien doctrines; his activities consisted solely of his entreaty to the Emperor for a joint offensive against the Turks. There was no men tion in Josel's account that he was regarded by many Jews as a messiah. The name David Reubeni, whom Josel surely heard of, even if he had not met him, was suppressed. Molkho's image in this source is that of an heretical fantasist, whose primary virtue resided in his martyrdom. If no other source had survived, we might never have known the mes sianic character of the movement. Other aspects of Molkho's legacy, particularly his martyrdom, were preserved with great fidelity among Ashkenazim. R. Yom Tov Lipman Heller recalled: 'Here in the Pinkas synagogue in Prague, which I had frequented prior to my appointment as head of the Rabbinical court, there is a pair of ziz.it [fringed four cornered garments] exactly the color green as in an egg yolk.

Shlomo Molkho, righteous convert of the conversos of Portugal, was scribe of the king who converted in secret, and adhered to David Reubeni of the land of the Ten Tribes [...] This R. Shlomo, although he was lacking in Torah from his youth, became an expert in Torah. He preached in public in Italy and Turkey and wrote a kabbalistic work. I, the writer, have seen a copy of that work in the possession of the Gaon my kinsman, my cousin R. Nathan Horodna. (His son later became Rosh Yeshiva and Head of the Rabbinical Court in Worms [143] so the tradition may have travelled there.) R. Shlomo and his companion Reubeni had audiences with the King of France and Charles V, and they tried to direct their hearts to the Jewish faith, for which R. Shlomo was condemned to the flames in Mantua, 1532/3, and they put a harness in his mouth so that he was unable to say anything.55 The word messiah or any overt references to a messianic mission are absent. Molkho had preached a sermon before an audience of both Jews and Christians in Mantua. References to Molkho's anti-Christian polemical words were reported as pro-Jewish proselytization.56 The anonymous Prague chronicler of 1615 referred only to the ru mors that were associated with the appearance of David Reubeni in the entry for 1523: 'News of saviors from beyond the Sambatyon River spread among all the lands, in addition to other messianic expecta tions'.57 The chronicler did not mention Molkho's name or messianic activities either in the entry for 1523 or in any subsequent entries. The contrast between the laconic descriptions of the Ashkenazic chroniclers and the expansive versions of the Sephardim chroniclers is striking.

Fully aware of the polemical import of these movements, Christian lenses maximized what Ashkenazic memory minimized.61 Christian Hebraists included lists of Jewish false R.

From these obser vations it follows methodologically, then, that notices of messianic movements within Ashkenaz should be read in a manner that is sensi tive to the context and aware of its likely distortions. Messianic move ments in Ashkenaz that were remembered in an obscure manner must still be taken seriously.63 It is not that Ashkenazim did not produce movements, but that they did not preserve their memory because of their greatly negative theological valence. Historian David Berger has noted the theological import of messianism for Jews living among Christians. Medieval Jews living in Christian lands lived in a state of perpetual rejection of a false messiah, and may well have been more sensitive to claims of messianic pretend ers.64 The question of the messiah was not simply that of Israel's history having come to its teleological end sooner rather than later, through one agent rather than another. It was a matter of reading the entire post Christian history of the Jews as a deliberate fraud. This one issue alone contained within it the power to validate the entire Christian claim, to undermine the entire rationale for existence of Jews and Judaism in the Christian mind.65 It should come as no wonder that Jews and Christians would distort accounts of messianic activism accordingly. 'Sabbatianism and the Jewish-Christian Polemic', Proceedings of the Tenth World Congress of Jewish Studies, Division C, Vol. II: Jewish Thought and Literature, Jerusalem 1990, pp. 1-7; Y.F. Baer (A History of the Jews in Christian Spain, II, Philadelphia 1961, pp. 277-281) reports on messianic movement in Castile in 1295 which shook the Jewish community to its foundations. The only surviving record is an apostate's derisive and polemical account mocking Jews for their false hopes. The culmination of this listing was the monograph by Lent (above note 41). Cohen ignored reports of movements in Ashkenaz which he regarded as obscure yet included movements in the Sephardic world for which sources were equally obscure, such as the Leon/Lyon movement of 1068. On that movement see: S.W. Baron, A Social and Religious History of the Jews (=ASRHJ), V, New York 1957, p. 199. D.

[19*]</page><page sequence="20">Elisheva Carlebach [20 Cohen's rule of evidence disregarded all accounts of messianic movements that did not come from Jewish sources. By his decision not to 'reckon reports about Jewish messianic movements that are not at tested by Jews, or obscure incidents', Cohen tipped the scales in favor of the religio-cultural sphere of Islamic influence.66 Sephardim who fol lowed a messianist, 'whatever the extent of their adherents', were to be counted; Ashkenazic sources with equally weak reverberations were dismissed for: weak reverberations. Yet the opposite methodological approach might be more justified in this case. Christian sources high lighted aspects of messianic movements that were inimical to Jewish polemical interests, but that does not mean the incidents they described were imagined. The records of messianic movements in Ashkenaz were so fragile and elusive, that the historian can not afford to ignore evi dence from sources that we have no reason to believe are fundamen tally tainted. As a result of rules which eliminated entire categories of sources, Cohen passed in virtual silence over periods of messianic fer ment within Ashkenazic Jewry: Throughout this period, no segment of Ashkenazic Jewry is known to have risen in messianic revolt. Indeed, we may go even further and say that there is not a single case of a messianic movement or of a pseudo-messiah known from Ashkenazic Jewry until the beginning of the sixteenth century. If enumerating incidents over half a millennium or more constitutes sufficient evidence to draw a paradigmatic messianic posture, then it is very likely that re-evaluation of the sources will produce a new definition of the Ashkenazic posture. Without creating an exhaustive catalogue, a re-reading of the sources indicates that a re-evaluation is in order. For the messianism of the Crusade period, Cohen defined Jews of Byzantium as essentially Sephardic because they were eastern, yet he never removed the Sephardic designation from Jews of Christian Spain, who were western.67 These Jews generated a great deal of active messi anic ferment during the first Crusade period.

[20*]</page><page sequence="21">21 ] The Sabbatian Posture of German Jewry ing Crusades sparked a major messianic awakening: the rich gave their property to the poor, all were immersed in waves of prayer and repent ance: 'They sit in their prayer shawls, they stopped working and we do not know what they are hoping for. And we are afraid that the thing might be revealed to the Gentiles and they will kill us'.68 This ferment was communicated to western European Jewry, and it affected them deeply. The Crusade chronicle of Solomon bar Samson opened with a statement concerning the impending redemption in a year that had turned into one of affliction.69 It is impossible to know how widespread such thoughts were in Ashkenaz, and whether or not they influenced the martyrdom of the Rhine communities.70 The influential compilation Sefer Hasidim already bears traces of a suppression of messianic thought and activism. The readers are warned to distance themselves from 'any person who prophesies concerning the messiah [...] for if it will be e vealed to the world, in the end it will be an embarrassment and humil iation before the world'.71 The mid-thirteenth century was another locus of messianic activism among Jews in the Christian world. The fifth Jewish millennium was inaugurated in the Christian year 1240; combined with the news of the Mongol invasions the atmosphere was ripe for messianism. A Bohe mian chronicler reported, 'In 1235 they [the Jews] were expelled from the city [Prague] and scattered over the countryside, because they had prepared to establish an army and showed letters in which they were notified that their messiah had come'.72 When Ezra of Moncontour arose in France and prophesied that Elijah would appear in 1226, the messiah in 1233 and the redemption itself would begin in 1240, the news spread almost exclusively through Sephardic channels. The news J. Prawer, The History of the Jews in the Latin Kingdom of Jerusalem, Oxford 1988, pp. 10-13. Cohen cited and dismissed without comment, ׳two messianic incidents in Byzantium, c. 1096, and in Sicily׳ (p. 206) and discounted these movements because these places had 'cultural affinities with the East and Spain, respectively'.

'During this time of great controversy between Emperor and Pope, Jews thought that the end had begun for the Roman Empire and for the Christian religion (for in their great hatred of it, they think it to be vain), and they believed that the time for the arrival of their messiah had come. Toward this end, they united throughout the German lands, against the Christians, and dared to decide that they would kill them with poison. They stole the holy wafer of the flesh and blood of Christ [...] When the matter was Bvealed, all the German Jews were caught and burned [...] Nothing could save them - such was the wrath of God'.74 This is very dim memory of what may possibly have been a strong messianic movement from the time of the Armleder persecu tions, and immediately following persecutions that began with shep herds.75 In Ashkenaz the memory of this movement could be preserved only in a Christian source. Medieval Italian Jewry, arguably a cultural unit that was neither Ash kenazic nor Sephardic did not fit neatly into Cohen's paradigm either As historian Yosef Yerushalmi has characterized them, 'Italian Jewry was particularly susceptible to every messianic tiding and, perhaps be cause of its geographic location, often served as an eschatological news agency for other parts of the Jewish world76.׳ An early fourteenth cen tury text described a messianic movement in the Italian Jewish commu nity of Cesena in North Central Italy: 'The Jews of Italy with their fam ilies and their entire goods started out to go Overseas [Ultra Mare, Latin term traditionally used for Holy Land]; they said that the messiah, whom they were expecting, was born in those parts'.77 This movement was probably stimulated by news of the fall of the last Crusader King dom in 1291; it appears to have left no traces in Jewish sources.

Scholars have debated the eschatological motivation behind various 'aliyot', beginning with that of the 'three hundred rabbis' in the early thirteenth century While not every migration to Zion was under taken for explicitly messianic reasons, an anonymous disciple of Nahmanides writing close to 1290, makes it clear that many such mi grations were impelled by an active messianism. 'Let no man assume that the king messiah will appear in an unclean land; let him not be deluded into imagining that he will appear in the Land of Israel among the Gentiles [...] And now many ae inspired and they volunteer to go to the Land of Israel. And many think that we are near the coming of the Redeemer seeing that in many places the Gentiles made their bur den heavier upon Israel and many other signs have already been re vealed to the Chosen'.80 R.

For example, Cohen dismissed the migration of 'several hundred rabbis from France and Germany to the Holy Land in 1210 and 1211׳ as 'betraying little if any messianic activity'.83 He characterized the move ment as elitist, because 'they made no move to carry the masses of Jews along with them'. In thirteenth century Ashkenaz, hundreds of people migrating to the Holy Land was a popular movement. Given the de mography of north European Jewish communities in the thirteenth cen tury, several hundred men are masses. In the very small communities of western Europe there was not as pronounced a social distance be tween rabbis and lay people. Rabbinic scholars were merchants and everyone was related. The social dynamics were so different from the vast population and huge distances of class and geography that char acterized movements on the fringes of the Geonic world, that a com parison of the two on the basis of popular resentment against a rabbinic elite seems to miss the mark entirely. Cohen's study was informed by the Jewish historiographical tradi tion to which he was heir and its biases which were deeply embedded. In this tradition, medieval Ashkenaz became a metaphor for the 'rab binic, elite' which was identified with fundamentalism and intolerance: (above note 9); D.

In Islamic lands, Jewish messianism was perceived as political insubordination; whereas Jewish expressions of messianism in Christian lands were interpreted as blasphemy, an attack on the fun damentals of the Christian faith. The interplay between Jewish suste nance and Christian mockery of Jewish messianic hope is emblematic of the tension which existed for Jews living in the Christian world. As a result of this unremitting cultural pressure in a hostile environment, the recorded memories of messianic movements among Ashkenazic Jews were muted or distorted.86 These memories shaped future percep tions of similar movements in turn. These perceptions were internal ized by the chroniclers both Jewish and non Jewish who transmitted the memory of events. This mechanism was in full operation when it came to transmission of the memory of the messianic movement of Sabbatai Zevi. Ill In a recent paper, Professor Shlomo Eidelberg restated some of the popular conceptions concerning the messianic posture of Ashkenazic Jews, with specific reference to the Sabbatian posture of German Jews. 'It is well known that among the Jews of medieval Germany we find no appearances of redeemers or messiahs'.87 Even with regard to the Sabbatian messianic movement, Eidelberg dismissed Scholem's argument concerning 'the large scale suppression Cohen, p. 212. Ibid., p. 223. It is significant that in one of the few passages in Sefer Hasidim, devoted to messianic prophecizing, the reason cited for its sharp discouragement was that 'in the end it will cause shame and humiliation before the entire world'.

Scholem's source for this assumption was the explicit description by Samuel Aboab of reports that Jewish communities in the Holy Land, Turkey, Germany, Holland, Poland, and Russia burned all the records that mentioned Sabbatai's name and admitted that the anti-Sabbatians were correct. Aboab reported that he was an eye-witness to this process in Italy, and connected the destruction of the Sabbatian evidence to a book 'recently published׳ in a non Jewish language which 'to our shame׳, listed false Jewish messiahs, including 'the most recent and worst88.׳ The long his tory of self censorship in messianic matters and the polemical sensitiv ity of Jews living among Christians lend credence and context to Aboab's testimony and Scholem's acceptance of it. Within his descriptions of the widespread acceptance of Sabbatai, Scholem noted a strong contrast among communities which received news of the messiah. Some communities issued festive messianic proc lamations, others, 'exhortations to secrecy lest the gentiles wreak vengeance on Israel'89 Scholem attributed the differences to 'tempera ment' rather than to history A re-reading of the evidence marshalled by Scholem in his closing arguments appears to sustain his picture of the profound belief of German Jews in Sabbatai's mission. We can take, for example, Glikl's paradoxical report in the 'Zikhroynes'. On the one hand, her account stressed that all the formal excitement took place within the Sephardic synagogue; the Ashkenazim seemed to play a more passive role. Glikl even framed the reports about Sabbatai within the most personal portions of the 'Zikhroynes'.90 Yet when we read the account of the one person whose activity she described in detail, her father in law, the picture that emerges is the reverse of the first superfi cial reading. The Sephardim rushed into the synagogues and cele brated, but her Ashkenazi father in law already had his bags packed, and waited for three years in this state of limbo.91 This apparent contra .205 G.

"With timbrels and with [26•]</page><page sequence="27">27] The Sabbatian Posture of German Jewry diction between the demonstrative show of messianic loyalty by the Sephardim, and the deeper, more private expression of hope by the German Jews is indicative of the fundamental complication that we have encountered in assessing memories of medieval Jewish messianism. This complication was operative in the sixteenth century and certainly did not cease in the seventeenth. There is plenty of evidence that Glikl's father in law was not atypical in his profound acceptance of the messianic news. German Jews tried to sell their property and prepared to leave; they held to their messianic beliefs long after Sabbatai's apostasy. They incorporated this belief into the records of their transactions with one another. In the well known case of the accord of 12 May 1666 between the Altona and Hamburg communities over the Ottensen cemetery, the unfolding messianic events left their mark. After agreeing that the Hamburg community would owe the Altona community 150 Reichsthaler over a period of time for the right to use the cemetery, the contract stipulated: 'Even if the redemption were to occur [...] befoE the stipulated time, viz. Chanuka of 5427 [1667], the Hamburg community would still be obli gated to pay the 50 Reichsthaler installment to the Altona community; they can use it toward the building of the Temple. However, if the re demption were to occur between Chanuka of 5427 [1667] and [the Jew ish] New Year 5428 [1668], then only 25 of the 50 outstanding Reichs thaler need be paid toward the building of the Temple.92 The few western Yiddish sources that refer to the movement also at test to a profound level of belief. Scholem described a series of Yiddish letters from Hamburg, written by Shaindel Schonchenn bas R. Solomon and Nathan ben Aaron Neumark, to Shaindel's husband Jacob Segal of Hamburg who was then languishing in an Oslo prison.93 Both used tid dances" they one and all trooped to the synagogue and they Kad the letters forth sold their houses and lands and all their possessions, for [טייליש] with joy...

But the Most High pleased otherwise'. I have inserted the relevant Yiddish phrases into the English text. I. Lorenz and J.

But as Beshraybung (below note 95) shows, there is room in the Judeo-German tradition for a more active involvement in [27*]</page><page sequence="28">Elisheva Carlebach [28 ings of the imminent messianic denouement to buoy the spirits of the prisoner. An active Yiddish literary tradition of messianic-polemical lit erature existed in Glikl's time. Two Yiddish chronicles, 'Zemach David' of Abraham Kap-Serlis,94 and the ׳Beshraybung׳ of Leib b. Ozer, affirm a picture of profound popular involvement by German Jews who held to their messianic beliefs long after Sabbatai's apostasy95 Yiddish tales of the Ten Lost Tribes and their battles with the mythical king Prester John from the late sixteenth century, may have served as precursors to the Yiddish literature of Sabbatai Zevi.96 Yiddish translations of Ger man folktales judaized the works by adding references to the coming of the messiah.97 Yet in their public posture, particularly toward Chris tian neighbors and authorities, the record shows a much more re strained reaction. Glikl's account sustains this dichotomy between deep private belief and more disengaged public posture. A significant strand in early modern German culture, popular as well as scholarly-theological, was devoted to the theme of Jewish blindness and perfidy embodied in the Jewish hopes for a future messiah. Early modern German literature devoted many works in different genres to the theme of vain Jewish messianic expectations.98 This was not simply a theological datum of which Jews were vaguely aware; it was an ac messianism, and certainly part of a literary tradition. Zfatman-Biller (below note 96) mentions a Yiddish translation of the Prester John tales of late 16th century. Although its origins were apparently within the Sephardic world, it shows how the traditions were transmitted interculturally. Abraham Kap-Serlis, 'Zemah David׳, MS. JTS mic 3543, 3b.
