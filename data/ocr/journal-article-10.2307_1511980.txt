<plain_text><page sequence="1">Arthur Rackham's Phrenological Landscape: In-betweens, Goblins, and Femmes Fatales Leslie Atzmon Introduction In this essay, I will explore several of Rackham's fairy illustrations in J.M. Barrie's Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens (1906), in Edgar Allan Poe's book of short stories, Tales of Mystery and Imagination (1935), in the Germanic legend The Ring Series (1910), and in Christ- ina Rossetti's Goblin Market (1933). The illustrations, I will argue, are marked by the effects of late-nineteenth-century psychology. Late nineteenth-century psychology, venturing into the pseudosciences of phrenology and physiognomy as well as exploring notions of the unconscious, produced threatening images both of the grotesque and of enchanting beauty. Each area of psychology reflected and was influenced by the material of the other; each evidenced anxi- eties and habits of thought that characterized Victorian visual imagery. In this essay, I will address the impact of widespread cultural presumptions about the grotesque and the seductive on Arthur Rackham's fairy images. I also will explore the ways that the unconscious incorporation of anxiety-provoking natural stimuli- such as jagged shapes and forms resembling staring eyes-magni- fied the perception of threatening visual images in both Victorian physiognomy and in Rackham's fairy illustrations. Fairy traits, behavior, and origins were serious and valid research subjects in nineteenth-century social science.' Fairies capti- vated the Victorians, who flocked to exhibits of fairy art and lavish productions of plays involving fairies. Rackham's believable but fantastic fairyland helped generate and sustain this fascination. Rackham's popular illustrations played an important role in creat- ing the Victorian image of fairies, simultaneously disclosing hidden implications for the understanding of the Victorian psyche. In this essay, I also will discuss the ways in which Arthur Rackham's fairies manifest, in visual form, both phrenological precepts and Victorian notions of the fearsome animalism of the unconscious mind. Rackham's interpretive imagery gave visual form to such concerns, making an original and important contribution to late nineteenth- century culture.

The pseudoscience of phren- ology-based on a particular version of faculty psychology in which the mind was shaped into distinct faculties that determine human behavior-proposes a materialist interpretation in which the mind is located corporeally in various organs (or sections) in the brain. These organs determine the character of those who possess them- the shape and proportions of the head preordain innate qualities. Phrenologists also explored the faculties that animals share with humans. These primitive faculties include, among others: Philoprogenitiveness-the love of offspring; concentrativeness-the ability to focus on one object; combativeness-the tendency to self- protection and courage; destructiveness-the desire to meet and overcome obstacles; and secretiveness-the instinct to conceal un- becoming behavior and thoughts. These propensities are most rele- vant to this study of fairies-who were believed to be aboriginal in the best case, and animistic in the worst-since the propensities specifically target those attributes common to both humans and an- imals.2 This group of faculties was well-known among British pro- ponents of phrenology; their physical manifestations were clearly spelled out in phrenological guidelines. Phrenology operates as a visual medium utilizing detailed anatomical drawings, charts, and diagrams (see fig. 1). Phren- ological drawings exhibit the Victorian fascination with the contrast between the normal and the grotesque. These drawings associate positive and negative character traits with a variety of attractive and distasteful outward appearances, respectively.

Aiken. Copyright () 1998 by Nancy E. Aiken. Reproduced with permission of Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc., Westport, CT. Phrenology was believed to be a landscape of the mind that revealed the character within. In his book The Human Body and Its Connexion with Man, phrenologist James John Garth Wilkinson des- cribes such a landscape as "inhabited by human natures in a thou- sand tents, all dwelling according to passions, faculties, and pow- ers." 3 The brain's faculties are concretely linked to a specific visual domain-a panorama of "tents," each with its own complexion. Rackham's illustrations depict physical types similar to those designated in phrenological charts and descriptions. His scenes are full of characters-amalgams of trees, animals, and humans- displaying various dispositions (see fig 7). The disagreeable quali- ties demonstrated by his fairies' physical features-for example, fierceness, greed, evil, seductiveness, and callousness-correlate with negative phrenological designations that hint at the beast within the unconscious mind. Late nineteenth-century notions of the unconscious inter- mingled with and modified associationist philosophy, which pro- posed that the mind links ideas in chains of associations, and phrenology, which located psychological traits in areas of the brain. Psychologists pondered connections between conscious thought and unconscious thought. Victorian psychologists were fascinated by the boundaries between the normal and abnormal, which they compared to the border between the conscious, rational mind and the unconscious mind. The unconscious mind, considered an out-of- control beast which could "come out" under the right circum- stances, thus took on a sinister quality.4 The emergence of the hidden beast within was a familiar theme in Victorian culture (in the story Dr. Jeckyll and Mr. Hyde written by Robert Louis Stevenson in the late 1800s, for example).5 In the image "The Kensington Gardens Are in London, Where the King Lives" (see fig. 6), Rackham places a host of imaginary creatures behind the king and underground. That these beings emerge from the dark world "behind" and "underground" is suggestive of the emergence of the beast from the unconscious mind. Their physical appearance, which combines plant, animal, and human features, gives a clue to their psychology. Animalistic or base character could be ascertained, many Victorians believed, from the face. Many so-called base facial fea- tures correlate directly with natural anxiety-provoking visual cues. Nancy Aiken, who discusses certain well-established visual triggers of fear and anxiety in The Biological Origins of Art, suggests several such natural triggers: false eye spots (see fig. 2) that mimic direct eye contact, pointed versus curved shapes, and the quality of a drawn line.6 Aiken proposes that art has assimilated anxiety- provoking direct eye contact imagery, sharp-angled shapes, and characteristic line quality for affective purpose. Phrenology and physiognomy have assimilated them as well. For analysis of the effects of direct eye contact and line qual- ity, Aiken uses psychologist Rudolph Arnheim's technique for com- 66 Design Issues: Volume 18, Number 4 Autumm 2002</page><page sequence="4">Figures 3 and 4 "Line drawings of Paintings by Cezanne and Picasso Depicting Line Quality" The Biological Origins of Art, Nancy E.

Reproduced with permission of Greenwood Publishing Group, Inc., Westport, CT. parison of line drawings of two paintings-one by Cezanne, who uses mostly gentle curved line, and one by Picasso, who utilizes sharp, jagged line and mask-like eye shapes (see figs, 3 and 4).7 Like Picasso's painting, phrenology and physiognomy internalize the unconscious power of anxiety-provoking visuals, including direct eye contact, sharp angles, and line temperament. These visual treat- ments often translate into intimidating cerebral and facial features. In his essay "Personal Beauty," nineteenth-century psychologist Herbert Spencer compared ugly people to "inferior races," and correlated extremely sharp-angled features with low intelligence: If the recession of the forehead, protuberance of the jaws, and largeness of the cheekbones, three leading elements of ugliness, are demonstrably indicative of mental inferiority- if such other facial defects as great width between the eyes, flatness of the nose spreading of the alae, front ward open- ing of the nostrils, length of the mouth, and largeness of the lips, are habitually associated with these, and disappear along with them as intelligence increases, both in the race and in the individual, is it not a fair inference that all such faulty trials of feature signify deficiencies of mind? 8 Sharp, protruding facial features signified not only lack of intelli- gence, but aggressive and destructive temperament. In Rackham's illustrations, round, bulging eyes, convex faces, prominent noses and chins, and low facial angles characterize fairies of all ilks (with the exception of seductive females). Jagged lines that trace grotesque features-a hybrid of the human and the repugnant- confirm the brutish nature of his fairies. Arthur Rackham's Fairies The best Rackham illustrations are conceptually suggestive-facial expressions, gestures, and compositions are "loaded" with symbol- ism and with hidden and obvious implications. Rackham brings this about by using exaggerated facial characteristics phrenologists (and physiognomists) attribute to negative behavior such as brutish sexuality and violence. His fairy illustrations combine familiar human physical traits with repugnant, exaggerated renditions of the human face and form or with animal features. In his landscape compositions, trees become grotesque and frightening animals. Such combinations grip our emotions; we interpret an image as grotesque when we perceive it as a mixture of the normative and the loathsome. Admixtures of the typical human form and the grotesque renditions of it strike a chord in the human psyche be- cause we relate to the familiar aspects and we recoil in horror from their deformities. Rackham's complex and varied compositions contribute to the suggestive symbolism that invigorates his work. His line quality, jagged and angular in anxiety-ridden environ- ments, adds intensity to his illustrations. Design Issues: Volume 18, Number 4 Autumm 2002 67</page><page sequence="5">At the same time, Rackham's renderings-fortified by twisted notions of Darwinian evolution in which humans evolve from apes-hint at the beast within the unconscious mind. To Victorians, the beast represented not just the grotesque, animal portion of the self, but specifically the animalistic libido. Rackham's illustrations give form, visually and conceptually, to the threat that grotesque features and seductive beauty pose to Victorian culture. Rackham visually merged an abundant and surprising variety of human and animal (or plant) traits. Such imaginative hybrids were a consistent feature of his fairy illustrations. "Rackham's world" burgeoned from one part individual imagination and one part Victorian world view. His vision is colored by prevailing presump- tions about nature. Rackham's nephew, Walter Starkie, gives some insights into the inner workings of Rackham's imaginary fairy world that were based on accepted notions of fairy tradition. Starkie describes Rackham's imaginary symbiotic relationship among fairies, animals, and trees; in this relationship, his trees become animals which are milked by fairies for their sap. He would make me gaze fixedly at one of the majestic trees with massive trunk.. He would say that under the roots of that tree the little men had their dinner and churned the butter they extracted from the sap of the tree. He would also make me see queer animals and birds in the branches of the tree and a little magic door below the trunk, which was the entrance to Fairyland. He used to tell me stories of the primitive religion of man which, in his opinion, was the cult of the tree...9 Rackham's narratives were generated from a deep visual and imag- inative engagement with the world. His unique concepts, spurred by his view of nature, culminated in animistic notions of the super- natural. According to Rackham, a primitive religion is practiced by fairies who live within trees and milk them for butter. Such a view has its basis in notions of fairies "clearly derived from animistic perceptions of nature" and centuries of ideas regard- ing fairies inhabiting trees and their love of milk.10 Tree fairies often did worse damage than stealing milk. Particularly striking in this context are Rackham's varieties of threatening, anthropomorphic trees. Victorianist Carole Silver describes the spirits that haunt these trees as extremely threatening.11 Rackham's tree illustrations capture this grotesque horror in a powerful and unique way. The English periodical The Outlook described Rackham's anthropomorphic tree illustrations from A Midsummer Night's Dream (see fig. 5) as: "a Rackham tree; one of those trees, gnarled and black and twisted ...appearing as trees that only one man has ever perceived and drawn...." 12 In the image "Come, Now a Roundel," a gnarled and twisted tree roots in and draws sustenance from a so-called "fairy ring" or ring of mushrooms. From its branches, the tree exudes 68 Design Issues: Volume 18, Number 4 Autumm 2002</page><page sequence="6">Figure 5 "Come, now a roundel" from Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream ( Courtesy of the estate of Arthur Rackham/ The Bridgeman Art Library. fairies who ostensibly haunt the tree-in fact, it is difficult to say where tree ends and fairy begins. Rackham's imagery integrates cultural precepts into a believ- able fantasy world visually rendered in a provocative manner. His work draws conceptual power from combinations of accepted beliefs and suggestive imaginary scenarios; it draws visual power from his novel juxtapositions, of human and animal, familiar and grotesque, repugnant and beautiful. In Rackham's work fay, flora, and fauna merge-to produce what I call "in-betweens"-in an array that forges a phrenological landscape. In this landscape indi- vidual traits, striking on their own, are modified by an illustrative environment that insists on perceptual transitions between the shape of the parts and the design of the whole.

Courtesy of the estate of Arthur Rackham/ The Bridgeman Art Library. In-betweens Rackham's hybrid characters not only draw power from their compositional environments, but are themselves visually and conceptually complex. In Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens, the young narrator David tells the story of one-week-old Peter Pan's adven- tures in Kensington Gardens. Peter is halfway evolved from a bird to a boy, and can still fly merely because he has faith that he is able to do so. When he realizes that he is part human, he loses his ability to fly; Peter must then consult with the fairies that inhabit the park. Peter, who is accepted because he remains part animal, is our guide to the fairies. In Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. Rackham portrays a realistic fantasy world-a world of in-betweens, where the com- monplace morphs with the deformed-in which birds and fairies converse, and trees come to chat.

Barrie's Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens ( Courtesy of the estate of Arthur Rackham/ The Bridgeman Art Library. goblins' intoxicating temptation and Lizzie's stalwart fortitude. Rackham goes to all lengths to blur boundaries between animal and human. Some goblins are mostly animal with subtle human nuances. Two goblins at the bottom right resemble a cat and a rat, respectively. However, the cat's sneer is more human than feline, the rat's long nose and beady eyes are exaggerations of the nose and eyes of the other, more human, goblins in the image. Another of the goblins on the left side of the image looks like a werewolf, his teeth fang-like and his nose flat against his face. Yet another goblin who offers fruit is green with a large beak. His hand is webbed like a duck's. He resembles a vulture until one notices a grotesque smile below his beak. The smile anamorphically transforms the beak into a large hooked nose, which again is an exaggeration of the hooked nose of the fairy directly across from him in the image. This anamorphosis-a normal image that looks distorted when viewed through a special instrument or perspectival angle- compels the viewer to function as distorting instrument. These un- expected distortions expand the variety of morphing goblin heads and shifting facial expressions, and help fashion a phrenological landscape blanketed with horror. The Phrenological Landscape The visual axis oscillates between the parts and the whole, between the phrenological traits of the characters and the cumulative vision in the illustration "A Band of Workmen Who Were Sawing Down a Toadstool, Rushed Away, Leaving their Tools Behind Them" from Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens (see fig. 8). All the fairies have low, sharp-angled foreheads, which signify both little intelligence and 72 Desian Issues: Volume 18. Number 4 Autumm 2002</page><page sequence="10">small phrenological organs of Veneration and Benevolence. This combination of physical traits precludes devotedness and empathy for others, respectively. When small organs of Veneration and Benevolence are overcome by organs of Combativeness and De- structiveness, as they are in this case, "cruelty," according to phre- nologist Combe, "may result." The fairy in the middle of the composition has an enormous portion of his skull above his ears, therefore his organs of Combativeness and Destructiveness are extremely large. Overactive Combativeness, according to Combe, "inspires with the love of contention of its own sake; and pleasure may be felt in disputation or in fighting." He says of Destruct- iveness, "The organ is conspicuous in the heads of.. persons habitu- ally delighting in cruelty." 13 These gnomes' facial structures-gaunt, skull-like, and angular, with masculine features to excess-match nineteenth-century American artist and physician William Rimmer's debased types from his depictive book Art Anatomy (see fig. 9).14 The gnomes' eyes are disconcerting, too. The fairy in the middle of the composition has eyes that are far set, oval, and lizard- like. The two fairies in front of him have bulging oval eyes with prominent dark pupils that resemble eyespots. Although these fairies flee in fright rather than attack, their eyes range from repul- sive to unnerving in appearance. These fairy characters dovetail with their environment- Rackham's overall composition. In this image, the shapes of the fairies' faces and bodies mesh with the shapes of the toadstools and trees. The toadstool illustrations look like bumpy, bald heads-the gnomes are bald as well-rendered in such an engaging and vital fashion that the viewer can practically "feel" the bumps. In the greater image, the shapes of toadstools and gnomes resemble lumps on a landscape surface (their varied expressions and skull shapes suggest a strong dose of destructiveness or combativeness, and a missing capacity for veneration or benevolence). These jagged- featured gnomes fearfully scuttle away through a landscape replete with sharp angles. The angular shapes point in all directions, leav- ing the viewer anxious about finding a visual way out of the com- position around sharp rocks, thorns, and bony fingers. Rackham cultivates this anxiety in the image "They Will Certainly Mischief You" (see fig. 10) from Peter Pan in Kensington Gardens. In this illustration, a little girl is caught in sharp thorns and held by bony goblin fingers. Two impish male fairies (and a tree with claw-like branches) yank on her clothes-this image is typical of popular stories about trees inhabited by destructive fairies. The fairies' eyes suggest their dark side-they bulge unattractively and are oval with large, dark pupils. Just as disturbing, the drawn line cuts a multitude of sharp angles that make up the faces and bodies of the fairies and the tree which resemble a spider's web. Rackham incorporates jagged curves peppered with small, sharp thorns in the tree branches which instill disconcerting anxiety in the viewer.

All these coalesce to create a sense of wickedness in the illustration. Goblins and Dwarfs More frightening than these little tree fairies are primitive, animal- istic goblins. Poe's Tales of Mystery and Imagination, a book of short horror stories, begins with a justificatory essay that lobbies for a phrenological organ called Perverseness. Perverseness, according to Poe, "is a radical, a primitive impulse-elementary." Perverse in- deed is Hop-Frog, the story of a dwarf who, when mistreated by the king, tricks him and his seven ministers into dressing up as orang- utans, trusses them up, and burns them alive. At first, Rackham was concerned that he wasn't up to the task, that his images wouldn't be grotesque enough. Rackham admitted that his illustrations for Tales of Mystery and Imagination were "so horrible I was beginning to frighten myself." 15 Rackham was understandably frightened by images portraying behavior so cruel as to be unimaginable-even for a dwarf (Victorian dwarfs, real and supernatural, were consid- ered brutish and crude). We recognize Hop-Frog's behavior. Hop- Frog is acting human.

The beast that is the unconscious m-eind, then demands a combination of bestial savagery and the human ability to conceptualize. Rackham gave Hop-Frog the phrenological face of evil. In the illustration "Tripetta Advanced to the Monarch's Seat, and, Falling on Her Knees Before Him, Implored Him to Spare Her Friend" (see fig. 11), Hop-Frog has bulging oval eyes, high cheek- bones, a large and grotesque nose, snarling lips, a protruding chin, and a low forehead that slopes back at a steep angle. Rackham has drawn him as the cunning, rapacious, treacherous type described in Rimmer's Art Anatomy (see fig. 12 ). Incidentally, the king and his ministers resemble the type who exhibit these traits: "Lust and glut- tony; mirthful and unintellectual; animal passions constant" (See fig. 13). A black and white illustration (see fig. 14 ) shows Hop- Frog's skull wide above the ears, which indicates large organs of combativeness and destructiveness. The black-and-white illustra- tion is criss-crossed with sharp angles that seem to point like an arrow to the image of Hop-Frog. He is drawn from a series of sharp angles which focus the viewer's eyes onto his face. Here, one finds thick, short lines angled anxiously from his nose backward. His expression is that of a wild beast. These designations are augmented by a deep-rooted fear of dwarf animalism. As Silver explains: throughout the Victorian period, dwarfs ...phad been conflated with each other and equated with goblins (a generic name for small hostile, unattractive, grotesque, and almost exclusively male supernatural creatures) and thus with malhce and evil...they were voracious in their sexual appetites and bestial in their behavior."6 Hop-Frog the beast takes the devil's work into his own hands and gleefuly exacts fiery retribution. 76 Design Issues: Volume 18, Number 4 Autumm 2002</page><page sequence="14">Although we do not get an opportunity to observe the "vor- acious sexual appetite" typical of goblins in Hop-Frog, the illustra- tions for Christina Rossetti's Goblin Market explore this fully. Be- cause there are no females among them, goblins must kidnap human women. In the illustration "White and Gold Lizzie Stood" (see fig. 7), Rackham shows Lizzie enticed by goblins who swarm over her like insects and claw at her body. The implications are both sexual and ruinous-if she succumbs, she will ultimately die. The luscious fruit they peddle conceals from Lizzie a grotesque array of evil intentions which are expressed in their demeanor. At the very center of the image is a second rat. Both cat and rats have very wide skulls near their ears, which indicate large organs of Destructiveness and Secretiveness. These three, who offer Lizzie fruit, are intent on tempting her to taste her own destruction. This bird-goblin has simi- lar physical characteristics to Rimmer's coarse-featured, lustful, gluttonous type (see fig. 13). He, too, manifests large organs of Destructiveness and Secretiveness. Combe explains that too great an endowment of Secretiveness, "when not regulated by strong intel- lect, and moral sentiments, produces abuses. The individual then mistakes cunning for prudence and ability...and he may even be led to practice lying, duplicity, and deceit." 17 Right next to Lizzie in the center of the illustration, a more human-looking goblin offers Lizzie fruit both down over her shoul- der (juice runs down her chest) and up by her waist, pointing directly to her bare shoulder and full breast. The fruits near her waist that the leering goblin fondles are suggestive of breasts; here is the voracious goblin sexual appetite."8 All the goblins in this illus- tration are more or less animalistic. What is interesting about the specific goblin that assaults Lizzie-he is the most human-looking of the bunch-is the uncanny juxtaposition of animal features with human ones. What makes him Rackham's most effective choice for a rapist is that he is simultaneously human enough to allow the viewer to imagine the act, and animalistic enough to make the act unimaginably horrible. The fleshy fruit creates a plant/human in- between that suggests cannibalism as well. The viewer is not sure whether the goblin intends to rape Lizzie or eat her. Femmes Fatales In contrast to these two sisters, the youthful female fairy in the illus- tration "The Fairies Are Exquisite Dancers" (see fig. 15) is temptress rather than tempted. Female fairies are animals under cover. Graceful and lovely features belie their immense sexual appetite, accompanied by the fairy propensity to bring ruin to humans who cross their paths. The beast within expressed itself openly in fairies. Silver explains the Victorian point of view: "womnen were closer to 'nature,' less rational and more instinctual, hence more prone to regress to the beast within."'9 Design Issues: Volume 18, Number 4 Autumm 2002 77</page><page sequence="15">/A i Figure 15 (Left) "The fairies are exquisite dancers" from J.M.

Even more erotic is the illustration "The Rhine-Maidens Obtain Possession of the Ring and Bear It Off in Triumph" from Richard Wagner's The Rhinegold and the Valkyrie (see fig. 17).

Two nude water nymphs tease the elf Alberich while they battle him for the possession of the ring-one restrains him from behind and the other from the front- in a tussle that has strong sexual overtones. They appear to be thor- oughly enjoying themselves. The third Rhine-Maiden gleefully holds up the ring, exposing a sinuous body with full breasts, long legs and a barely concealed pubic area. Their faces are perfectly beautiful, matching Rimmer's designation of well-balanced female features. Victorian "ladies" whose sexuality had been "civilized" would never be portrayed in this fashion; however, fairies, with their primitive impulses, could. This image functions as soft-core pornography-it stirs up common male sexual fantasies, including one man together with several women. Male fear of female sexual power, represented by the femme fatales, is a turnabout for male anxiety about male sexual fantasies. Victorian culture projected the sexual beast hidden within the male unconscious onto female fairies. Conclusion In his 1866 book, The Gay Science, writer Eneas Sweetland Dallas suggests that unconscious fantasy is an "automatic action of the mind present in all mental activity" and compares it to an invisible, "tricksy" fairy: The hidden efficacy of our thoughts, their prodigious power of working in the dark and helping us underhand, can be compared to that of the lubber-fiend who toils for us when we are asleep or when we are not working... Our backs are turned and it is done in a trice, or we awake in the morning and find that it has been wrought in the night... We have such a fairy in our thoughts, a willing but unknown and tricksy worker.. 21 Dallas contrasts the light and dark character of conscious and unconscious thought, respectively. Dallas's fairy is a hidden, under- handed fay who only appears when it is dark. Rackham's fairies represent the unconscious-the unknown mind that lurks in the dark recesses of human animalism, waiting for an opportunity to rear its ugly head. The crude, animalistic, and even sexually charged traits assigned to "others," such as the "lower" races and fairies, were meshed with their assigned physical characteristics. The soothing, sinuous features attached to female fairies hid an overcharged 80 Design Issues: Volume 18, Number 4 Autumm 2002</page><page sequence="18">sexual appetite, while the male fairies were pictured as grotesque admixtures of man and beast. Perceptions of these physical charac- teristics-which can be correlated with natural anxiety-provoking stimuli such as jagged lines and eye spots-found their way into negative phrenological and physiognomic designations, into cult- ural stereotypes, and into Rackham's illustration. Victorian psychologists searched for and formulated expla- nations of behavior which tended either to normalize or to patholo- gize. This "black-or-white" method of categorization produced pervasive images of abnormal animalistic behavior and grotesque appearance that were, in turn, codified by the tenets of phrenology and the psychology of the unconscious. Rackham's work was not immune to these influences. He was both a conduit of cultural mores and a creator of them. The hue and spirit of Rackham's work had a tremendous impact on late nineteenth-century and twentieth- century conceptions of Fairyland. At the same time, common Victor- ian beliefs about animalistic "primitives" are boldly suggested in the narrative of Rackham's compositions in a number of ways. Animalism also is inferred by images of fairies with unsavory cranial and facial features and by seductive-looking female fairies. Compositions replete with jagged lines drawn with sharp angles stimulate subliminal anxiety in Rackham's imagery Phrenology and notions of the unconscious imbue his fairy illustrations with narra- tives that express certain fears and anxieties pervading the Victorian psyche. Rackham's biographers have examined both his style and his creative motivations at length. There is no analysis, however, of the ways in which Rackham's illustrations reflect Victorian culture. This deficiency is due to prescribed methodologies of visual analysis- visual analysis of illustration tends to focus on artistic influences, style, and close reading of symbolism, and to ignore the greater cultural context of the work. Exploring an illustration's cultural context reveals the limitations of a purely visual approach. Cultural analysis of an illustration divulges the greater narrative quality of the image, allowing the embedded messages of a culture to emerge. One could easily spend long stretches of time engrossed in the conceptual content of the scenes in Rackham's fairy illustrations. Rackham's imagery lends itself to close reading and intense visual scrutiny. His illustrations stand on their own as cultural narrative, at least as powerful and eloquent as the text they accompany.

He was sent to a reformatory at ten years old, and there showed himself, as he has always done...quiet, well-behaved, and obedient. Then, at fourteen years old, he had a great fright from a viper-a fright which threw him off his balance and started the series of psychical oscilla- tions on which he has been tossed ever since... His character became violent, greedy, and quarrelsome...He is constantly haranguing anyone who will listen to him, abusing his physicians, or preaching with a monkey-like impudence rather than with reasoned clearness...." (Frederick W. H. Myers, "Multiplex Personality." (1886) in Jenny Bourne Taylor and Sally Shuttleworth, eds., Embodied Selves: An Anthology of Psychological Texts 1830-1890(Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1998), 134.) Italics are my emphasis. The abnormal Louis V. is monkey-like; his unconscious self-his dark, bestial side-has emerged to overtake his ratio- nal side. 5 Interestingly, it was a fearful reaction to a frightening animal itself that brought out the savage in Louis V. 6 Eye spots, which resemble a fixed and direct stare, are threatening to a variety of animal species. In particular, such anxiety may be provoked by portraits- which have a strong focus on the eyes- and masks-in which exaggerated eyes are associated with magical intent. 7 "The composition or internal form is very similar. However, the emotions evoked by the two paintings are very different because of the treatment or the shapes chosen to illustrate the women...the Picasso...faces are depicted as masks... and their bodies are drawn with pointed shapes....the emotional effect evoked by the Picasso can still be described as anxiousness or uneasiness....Their pointed shapes may trigger an emotional response on the fear continuum; their eyes...very likely trigger an emotional response on the fear continuum." (Nancy Aiken, The Biological Origins of Art(Westport, CT: Praeger Publishers, 1998), 118.) It is surprising that Aiken neglects to mention shapes in the Picassos that resemble eyespots. Interestingly, the anxiety-provoking mask-like faces and jagged shapes reflect the primitivism Picasso embraced-primitivism Victorians associated with animism. Picasso employs subliminal correlations among these triggers, animism, and anxi- ety to produce a reaction in the viewer. 8 Herbert Spencer, The Haythome Papers No. VIII, Personal Beauty," Leader5 (1854): 356-7. 9 Walter Starkie quoted in James Hamilton, Arthur Rackham (New York: Arcade Publishing, 1990), 72. 10 Silver, Strange and Secret Peoples, 44-45. Scholar Lewis Spence explains the connection among fairies, trees, and milk: "In all British countries, fairies are regarded as great thieves of milk. Indeed one of their chief haunts is the dairy...it was believed that fairies took away cows at night in order to milk them, and sent them back in the morning.. .[There is a] legend in the Hebrides which tells how a fairy once a year issued from a tree to distribute 'the milk of wisdom' to the women of the district." (Lewis Spence, The Fairy Tradition in Britain (London: Rider and Company, 1948), 215, 321.) Milk, then, sustains not only the rudi- mentary needs of infants, but those of their primitive fairy counterparts as well. 11 "The annir-choille...haunted the woods and snared men...One group of two thorn trees and a boartree...'is guarded by three malevolent demons who, after dark, haunt that stretch of the road... Passersby...have had their arms grabbed with marks to show for it, heard inhuman laughs 'and even caught glimpses of dim and horribly misshapen figures.' Others passing hostile trees have sensed from them 'feelings of vicious, bitter evil...' Hatred of humans literally emanated from their branches."
