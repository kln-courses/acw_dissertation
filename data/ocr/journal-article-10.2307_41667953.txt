<plain_text><page sequence="1">A Prehistoric While a wealth of rock art and cave art is known from most parts of Europe, in the Balkans such prehistoric art is very scanty. Only one site has so far provided a rich series of cave pictures : Magourata Cave , near the town of Bielogradchik in northwestern Bulgaria. Inhabitants of the area have known this cave for a long time. Local legend claims that the cave was the shelter for bandits a few generations ago , while during the last World War it served as headquarters for a group of partisans. The cave art was noticed at least as early as the eighteenth century - a fact proven by names , dates and vari- ous writings upon the figures and near them. The art , however, has never been thoroughly studied. Three decades ago, the pictures were dated to the Iron Age and shortly thereafter the writer Hendrik Van Loon mentioned them as a mysteri- ous puzzle in his book The Arts. A lengthier description was presented in 1963 by Ch. Somov and M. Aleksandrov in a guidebooklet of Bielo- gradchik and its surroundings. The present writer has discussed the group of paintings referred to as the (( monumental composition" in a book which appeared last year dealing with similar compositions found in the Valtellina in north Italy. A detailed study of the entire complex is presently in progress . The cave is about four kilometers long and pene- trates deep into the mountain. Near the entrance, a series of cup-marks appear on the rock surface. Else- where, this sometimes is a sign that the cave has a re- ligious function. Abundant finds show that the cave was inhabited or used in several periods. Fossil bones 92</page><page sequence="2">The entrance of Magourata Cave, Bulgaria. Sanctuary Cave in Bulgaria MAGOURATA CAVE By EMMANUEL ANATI of cave bear were collected inside it, but no Palaeo- lithic artifacts have been reported so far. Neolithic finds are plentiful, including flint implements among which are arrowheads and long blades. Polished stone axes, coarse handmade pottery vessels, loom weights, among other objects, show that during the Neolithic and Bronze Ages the cave was frequently used by man. Artifacts belonging to the Iron Age are less copious. In the Roman period, however, evidence of human presence is again abundant: finds include Roman fibulae and metal tools, coins, pottery and tiles. The entrance to the cave, sloping and difficult to 93</page><page sequence="3">A section of the decorated corridor showing the superposition of various phases of paintings. A series of weapons and tools includes, from left to right: an elongated double axe, a T-shaped implement, a "pad- dle," a rectangular, undefined sign, a hammering tool or mallet, a large T-shaped implement and a composite sign showing a rectangular body filled in with parallel lines, two arms and a series of vertical short lines on top. 94 MAGOURATA CAVE continued pass through when we visited it in 1964, has since been provided with stairs to make descent easy. After the entrance corridor the visitor stands in a large hall with a high ceiling and a floor covered with fallen rocks, some of which are several meters high. Various openings appear at the sides of this hall. Following a narrow corridor where passage is not easy, after about two hundred meters there is another hall. From there a side corridor leads to the prehistoric paintings. After a few minutes walk appears the first group of figures then, for a length of about a hundred meters, there are several groups starting with a series of simple geometric and linear signs, followed by a hunting scene. After this the paintings become richer and richer until the final climax at the vaulted ''sanctu- ary." The prehistoric figures are made of bats' guano found in large quantities inside the cave. Guano was used generously, so that the figures sometimes are in high relief that produces a peculiar effect when trans- verse light strikes it. Sometimes as the result of cal- cification, the dark brown guano has whitened to al- most the same color as the rock surface, but its relief is still clearly visible. The walls of the cave are wet and the guano applied upon them by the prehistoric artists has consolidated and nearly fossilized. Later drawings were made with ocher, mud or by carving. They are sometimes superimposed upon the prehis- toric figures but are easily distinguished. The figures include a wealth of representations of tools and weapons which indicate a time range from the Neolithic to the end of the Early Bronze Age. Axes and adzes appear in a variety of types, mostly illustrating stone implements: biconvex and perfor- ated axes, battle-axes, hammer axes, naviculate axes. Mallets and hammering tools, knives, some apparently with flint blades, bows and arrows, spears and other tools are likely to cover a relatively long range of time from the fourth millennium to the middle of the second millennium b.c. During this period the painting appears to have gone on almost continuously. Several superpositions show that there are various phases but I have not yet detected a clear stylistic evolution within this range. The subject matter is varied: approximately seven hundred figures, representing over fifty different sub- jects. Human and idol-like figures abound; animals are represented by deer, birds, several unidentified quadrupeds, a horse-like figure and some imaginary animals and possibly a dog (in connection with a hunting scene). Various symbols and signs comprise about two thirds of the figures. Solar and astral depic-</page><page sequence="4">/';-=09 )(8* =-0/']</page><page sequence="5">The "Lady of the Cave."

A row of six symbols: a schematic human figure, the "Lady of the Cave," her schematic companion, a curved mark, a bucranium and an undefined tool or object. MAGOURATA CAVE continued tions are common ; series of geometric designs such as points, lines, triangles, zigzags, squares and bell- shapes, are found all over. The size of the figures varies considerably, from a few centimeters to over one meter in length. The ar- tistic skill and aesthetic value also vary from figure to figure, indicating the presence of numerous hands and hinting at a variety of ideas and concepts, in what must have been a rich and imaginative, mythological and intellectual world. Figures and symbols are usu- ally assembled in scenes and compositions. Only in rare cases do single figures seem to have been depicted alone. In most cases descriptive and abstract figures, patterns and symbols are grouped together in compo- sitions as if they acquired a meaning in the context, like words in sentences or as parts of complex ideas. One of the most prominent figures is a female an- thropomorphic image, the body of which is composed by two converging triangular shapes. She appears to be wearing a dress with a much emphasized belt or object at the waist. Her arms are usually upraised, in an elegant posture reminding one of some Predynastic Egyptian figurines. We have called her the "Lady of the Cave." Her head varies considerably in size and shape; the legs are relatively small and delicate when they are represented, but often they do not appear. In a few cases the Lady is represented by the converging triangles without any further detail. The "Lady of the Cave" appears in a variety of scenes and compositions: in hunting scenes, between the hunter and the animal ; in a scene where male and female figures walk toward each other with a battle- axe in front of the man and a figure of the "Lady of the Cave" in front of the woman. In several instances the Lady has a schematic companion of obvious phallic significance. The couple is sometimes accompanied by two signs which seem to represent weapons or tools and probably signify attributes. In a few cases the Lady is found in more complex compositions of signs which seem to have an ideographic meaning. One of these groups has six very distinct symbols in a row, representing (from left to right) a schematic human figure, the Lady, her schematic companion, a curved mark, a bucranium and an undefined tool or object. There can be no doubt that the Lady was an important character in the conceptual complex illustrated by this group of cave art, but it was not possible so far to reach a definite conclusion about her - whether she represents a divinity, another supernatural being, the priestess of the, cave or some other actual or symbolic subject. A galloping horse-like animal is one of the most beautiful pictures. It is made in guano, but in a style different from all the other depictions and it does not</page><page sequence="7">In the center of this picture is seen a figure composed of three subsequent phases : a large rectangle which originally was the frame of a checker-board pattern was used as body of die animal.

A galloping horse-like animal depicted in a style different from all other paintings of the cave. It may not belong to the main art assemblage. 98 MAGOUR AT A CAVE continued seem to belong to the same assemblage. It may be either earlier or later than the Neolithic and Bronze Ages when this part of the cave was a sanctuary. Its style suggests some interesting parallels, but nothing can clearly be established regarding its date. Another unusual figure is that of a large deer, created by completing and interpreting earlier figures. A large rectangle which originally was the frame of a checkerboard pattern was used as the body of the ani- mal. Two small deer of a second phase were used as antlers and a squarish face was drawn below them. This last addition was probably made after the site ceased to be a sanctuary, and may represent one of the rare Iron Age depictions. There is a variety of imaginative figures and scenes. Hunting scenes apparently illustrate specific moments or life experiences of the artists and show hunters with bow and arrow wounding deer, wild geese and</page><page sequence="8">The monumental composition of the sanctuary hall. From the photograph we see that earlier figures are present in the same portion of wall, while later figures were added around the main composition. The tracing isolates the composi- tion, stressing its elements; the central solar disk, the two minor disks at the sides, the parallel lines and the checker-board pattern below, and the two battle-axes to the left. Standard-like figures composed by a disk with oculi and a handle-like line. imaginary animals. Other figures are more symbolic, showing idol-like and spirit-like images, vaguely anthropomorphic beings, figures like standards with an oculi-face at the top. Oculi-faces are depictions of human faces in which the eyes are the most emphasized detail. They usually are drawn schematically and exaggerated in propor- tions. Also several solar disks appear with an oculi- face inside them. The most impressive such figure is part of a large and elaborate composition, probably the central figure complex of the innermost hall, the so-called "sanctuary". This solar figure has two con- centric circles, rays all round and an oculi-face in the middle. Below it there are two parallel lines and a checkerboard pattern. On the sides of the solar face there are two smaller disks and on the left side two elongated battle-axes. Later additions and superposi- tions have disturbed this composition but still its unity and its difference from the surrounding figures are clearly detectable. This composition takes on in- creased importance because it shows a striking con- ceptual similarity with monuments in the Camonica Valley, Valtellina, Tyrol and other sites in the Alpine area. In the Alps, and possibly here as well, the ele- ments appear to represent the attributes, or the ''mem- bers," of a divine image or a religious concept in which the central face - identified with the sun - has 99</page><page sequence="9">MAGOURATA CAVE continued two minor entities at the sides and with them forms a triad of circular elements or three "faces" in a single conceptual body. The two lines and the checkerboard pattern have been thought to have a bivalent signifi- cance as in the Borno and the Paspardo monuments in the Camonica Valley, which were discussed by the present writer in monographs of Centro Carnuti o di Studi Preistorici. On one side, they appear to repre- sent the belt (the parallel lines) and the garment (the checkerboard pattern) of a symbolic body. As such they find a variety of parallels also in the Balkans, mainly in plastic female figurines from Kličevac (Jugoslavia), Pankalochori (Crete) and elsewhere. But in some instances they appear to represent also the two basic elements found in the landscape: a river or just 'water" (the parallel lines), and fields, or just "earth" (the checkerboard pattern). In the Camonica Valley and at Mount Bego the same elements fre- quently occur in a more realistic form in which fur- ther details are provided. Sometimes, each square has some pattern inside which may represent kinds of crops. The river may cross the fields and the fields may have inside them drawings of animals or men working at the plough. Similar figurative concepts are widespread in Neolithic and Early Bronze Age rock art from Cen- tral Asia to western Europe and even farther away, in the Moroccan Atlas; they may illustrate the presence of widely diffused ideological concepts among the rock art makers of these parts of the world. In several compositions of this sort, from the Alps and elsewhere, the circular elements - the sun and the two smaller disks beside it - appear to represent the sky while the linear and angular elements - the par- allel lines and the checkerboard pattern - may repre- sent elements of the earth. Together they appear in the same composition, representing the members or parts of an "entity" in which the various aspects of nature are synthesized. In the Alpine areas as well, this complex cosmologi- cal image is frequently surrounded by weapons or tools. In some instances, in the Camonica Valley, in Valtellina and the Tyrol, these weapons spring out of the composite "body" as if they were the limbs of the being: either arms or legs, or both. Here and else- where they appear in couples, but in the Alps they occur also in larger numbers, as if the entity had a larger number of limbs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the only cave art composition of this kind in the Balkans. In the Alpine area these concepts appear quite suddenly at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age (around 1850 b.c.) and persist as a dominant element until about 1400 B.c. At Magourata Cave, they may go back to the late Neolithic, as is hinted by the two battle-axes represented in the context. In absolute dating, how- ever, they are unlikely to be much earlier than the Alpine parallels. This monumental composition seems to be the cen- tral depiction in the sanctuary cave, but it is not neces- sarily the earliest and even on the same wall surface there are some older pictures. Together with the fig- ures of the "Lady of the Cave" and the other symbols and scenes, it forms one of the most interesting and important assemblages of prehistoric art known so far in the Balkans and suggests the religious character of the depictions and the particular cult importance of this cave for prehistoric man. Clearly these pictures conceal a very rich and com- plex significance indicating an intellectual world showing similarities and conceptual connections to other major groups of rock art from relatively distant regions. Only preliminary work has thus far been done on this cave ; we may mention a few of the problems fac- ing us in continuing this research. We have seen that the monumental composition is just one of several groups of paintings in the sanctuary hall in which figures were added for generations. The corridor lead- ing to this hall is decorated with hundreds of figures representing a variety of subjects. Is there an order in all these figures ? Do they all belong to the same as- semblage, or do they illustrate the separate and dis- connected expressions of various human groups with different motivations? Is there a connection between the monumental composition and the "Lady of the Cave" ? Are they related expressions of the same gen- eral ideology or are they there by chance ? Both from their size and their location, it seems that some of the paintings were of basic relevance to prehistoric man, while other figures appear to be sec- ondary - even casual. What caused these differences? Such a rich site is unlikely to be the only one of its kind in the area. The discovery of other painted sanc- tuary caves would certainly contribute to a better understanding of the significance of this one and of its figures. But already, Magourata Cave adds a new chapter to the history of prehistoric art. Professor Emmanuel Anati is well-known to readers of Archaeology for his articles on prehistoric art and his reviews. He is director of the Centro Camuno di Studi Preistorici in Italy. In the winters, he teaches at the University of Tel Aviv and at the Hebrew Uni- versity, Jerusalem, Israel. His most recent publications are two volumes on Rock-Art in Central Arabia (Lou- vain 1968) and a volume on the Prehistoric Art in the North-Western Regions of the Gherian Peninsula (Capodi Ponte 1968). 100</page></plain_text>
