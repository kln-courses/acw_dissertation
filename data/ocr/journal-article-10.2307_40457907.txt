<plain_text><page sequence="1">"Eye Goddesses" in India and their West Asian Parallels By M. K. DhA VALI KAR The excavations that have so far been carried out during the last sixty years in northern and north-western India have yielded a considerable number of curious ivory objects. They are usually found in the N. B. P. levels which are ascribable to the 5th to 2nd cent. B. C. Being reported from most of the sites in this region they have acquired almost a datable value, so that the levels in which they are found can be considered, with a reasonable amount of certi- tude, as belonging to the early historical period. Furthermore, it needs a special mention that these objects, though of common occurrence in northern and north-western India, are lately found also in Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat; they are, however, conspicuously absent in the region south of Narmada. The shape of these objects is very curious and interesting. Among them three main types can be discerned. One (fig. 1) has triangular top and an oblong bottom with an elongated, parallel-sided stem that joins the top and the bottom 1. The other type (fig. 2) is not far removed from the former and can only be said to have been evolved from it. The top and the bottom are similar; only the parallel-sided stem joining the two is replaced by one with sides tapering upwards. In addition, it also has a pair of outstretched arms 2. The third type (fig. 3) can be said to be an elaborate form of the preceding. The figure approximates an almost anthropomorphic form. It has a triangular head, a pair of outstretched arms, broad, swelling hips possibly indicative of fertility and short, stumpy, out-turned feet 3. The figurines are decorated all over with the "dot-in-circle" and linear patterns. When studied carefully they lead one to identify them as being 1 The figure illustrated is from Taxila.

On closer observation, the "dot-in-circle" decoration shows that it has been executed with a definite plan. Thus, the first pair of circles can be taken to represent eyes and the one below them, nose. Yet another pair on the body can undoubt- edly be taken to indicate breasts. The other circles on the lower half of the body are probably only decorative; perhaps they were executed to achieve a balance with the decoration in the upper half of the body. However, it can certainly not be without any significance for the "dot-in-circle" is known to archaeologists as the "eye" motif, having magical properties. It is one of the most ancient motifs known to man and was employed on beads, amulets and similar objects to ward on the "evil eye". It was extremely common in the ancient world, particularly in West Asia and Egypt in the 3rd-2nd millennium B. C. and the stylized figurines bearing the eye pattern, especially those from West Asian sites have been termed as "eye goddesses" 4. Therefore the Indian specimens described above may also be called "eye goddesses". Till lately, the eye goddess types referred to above were confined to the levels attributed to 5th-2nd centuries B. C. However, in recent years they have also been recovered from still earlier levels. Thus, a fragmentary "eye goddess" of ivory was found in the earliest levels (Period I) of Ujjain (Madhya Pradesh) which are dated to ca. 800-500 B. C. 5. Typologically it is exactly similar to fig.l. More recently such figurines have also been found in the Painted Grey Ware levels in north India. A fragmentary "eye goddess" (fig. 4) has been reported from the Painted Grey Ware levels of Alamgirpur (Uttar Pradesh) which are dated to 1100-800 B. C. 6. The Alamgirpur specimen, though frag- mentary, appears to be identical with fig. 2 and stretches back the antiquity of these figurines to the end of the second and the beginning of the first mil- lennium B. C. At this stage it would be interesting to scan through the evidence from Harappan sites. In the collection of miscellaneous objects from Harappa and Mohenjodaro there are a number of ivory pieces decorated with incised "eye" motifs and linear patterns and surprisingly enough they bear a family resem- blance to the "eye goddesses" of the historical period. Thus, in Mackay's collection from Mohenjodaro there are two specimens which are noteworthy inasmuch as they are not far removed typologically from those of the historical period. One such figurine 7 has an oblong top, a tapering body and an oblong, rather pedestalled base. The top has two rows of eyes, three in each line while the body also similarly has three such rows, but set in bands (fig. 5). The other figure 8 (fig. 6) is divided into five compartments by means of sets of incised lines. The top and the bottom compartments have the "feather" pattern while 4 See for the cult of "eye goddesses" in the ancient world O. G. S.

Marshall's excavations at Mohenjodaro too have brought to light many such ivory objects 9. One of these 10 (fig. 7) undoubtedly appears to be a stylized representation of a human figurine. It consists of an oblong piece of ivory having tapering sides and a round top. The body is divided into two oblong zones by a band containing three eyes ; the zones in their turn have been adorn- ed with an outsize eye in the centre and two eyes each below and above it. The very shape of the figurine is enough to convince that it represents a human figure. Next in order would come a similar ivory object from Mohenjodaro u (fig. 8). It has a round top and round bottom with frilled edge and an oblong body with slight transverse projection on either side in the middle. The roundish head and the bottom have a big eye in the centre surrounded by a number of smaller eyes. On the body we notice that the opposite ends of the transverse projection have been joined by incised lines and the resulting cross contains a small eye each in its angles. On either side of the cross are two big concentric circles enclosing smaller eyes, four in the upper and three in the lower one. Typologically the specimen is not dissimilar from the preceding example which has a flat bottom; the present one has a round base. Yet another specimen from Mohenjodaro 12 (fig. 9) is composed of two segmented oblongs topped by three segmented circles containing the eye motif. Resembling this one is an object reported from Harappa13 (fig. 10). It is an oblong ivory piece having the edges of its lower end jagged. It bears six eyes, four of which are big; the two in the lower end are quite smaller. Two more specimens which also deserve serious consideration from the point of view of the present study are from Mohenjodaro 14. One is a thin, flat ivory piece divided into five compartments by incised horizontal lines. The topmost and the lowermost compartments are decorated with lines crossing each other; the three smaller zones in the middle bear eye patterns (fig. 11). The other 15 one (fig. 12) is only a small ivory strip having lines crossing each other and the resulting lozenges contain an eye each. Yet another specimen 16, differing in conception from the preceding ones, consists of an oblong body with a pointed base and an ovalloid top crown- ed by a crescent. The head bears three eyes and the body one. Probably it may be a representation of a horned deity. Noteworthy is its eye motif (fig. 13).

C. It also demonstrates the process by which the Harappan prototypes were transformed into stylized, anthropomorphic forms in the historical period. It is interesting to consider the problem of the origin of these figures. The figurines of the early historical period bear a striking resemblance to some figurines found in Iran 18. The latter are carved in bone and are more natural- istic. They are, however, ascribed to the Parthian period. But even the his- torical eye goddesses in India belong to an earlier period and the question of their Parthian origin therefore does not arise. Nanavati 19, however, is of the opinion that the Indian figurines have their origin in the Achaemenid Iran but even he himself admits that no such figurines have yet been found there. This view, therefore, does not merit serious consideration. Figurines exactly identical in shape and decoration have been found in Egypt. Pétrie calls these wooden figurines onkh-sh&amp;ped dolls20. They are, however, assigned to the Roman period and as such can be said to have trav- elled there from India for the simple reason that Indian trade with the Roman world was in the hands of Egyptian middlemen. In view of the high antiquity of "eye goddesses" in India it is necessary to search for their parallels in other countries of the ancient world at a very early period. In this connection it is interesting to note that objects very simi- lar to the Indian "eye goddesses" of the historical period have been found at Troy. There they occur since the beginning of the habitation in the First Settle- ment (3000-2500 B. C.) and continue till the end of the Fifth Settlement (1900- 1800 B. C). The figurines are usually of bone, oblong in shape and decorated with eye motif all over the body 21. Some of the figurines which approximate an anthropomorphic form are, however, devoid of the eye motifs 22. It is also interesting to note that even some of the handles of knives or daggers are all over decorated with eye motifs 23. Thus the evidence from Troy would point to the fact that the earliest settlers at that place brought the "eye goddesses" with them. Equally interesting evidence is furnished by West Asian sites. Mallow an, in the course of his excavations of the temple mound at Tell Brak, encountered in the lower levels thousands of objects of black and white alabaster which he calls "eye idols" 24. They consist normally of a thin biscuit-like body sur- 17 J. M. Nanavati, Ivory Figures from Prabhasa, Jr. of the M. P. Itihása Parisad, No. 4, 1962, p. 59. 18 R.

DhaVALIKAR Anthropos 60. 1965 mounted by a pair of eyes in human forms once tinted with malachite paint. According to the excavator they probably represent dedication by every member of the populace to an allseeing deity who watched over the fortunes of the city. There are, moreover, many different varieties including figures with three eyes, pairs with engravings of smaller idols on the front of the body which were possibly family dedications. More important members of the hier- archy were perhaps represented by figures wearing crowns. The figurines have been dated by Mallow an on the basis of stratigraphical and other evidence afforded by associated finds to the first half of the third millennium B. C. Similar figurines have also been reported from many other West Asian sites 25. All this is betoken of the widespread cult of eye idols in West Asia. The West Asian idols bear a family resemblance to the eye goddesses in India. Taking into consideration the cultural and commercial contact the Harappans had with the West Asians it would not be far fetched to surmise that this particular concept of eye goddess travelled from West Asia to India sometime about the middle of the third millennium B. C. For, "ideas", as Wheeler says, "have wings". The only noteworthy difference is in the material used for the fashioning of the figurines. This is all the more natural for the simple reason that the choice of material was conditioned by its availability in respective areas. We may now consider the probable use of the figurines. The very appel- lation "eye goddess" does not in any way denote their qualities or use ; at best it is a convenient label to distinguish them from other objects bearing the eye pattern. It is derived from the conspicuous motif with which they are decorated. Mallowan himself, in an endeavour to be impartial, offers several alternative interpretations of the eye idols, describing them as benevolent and protective eyes, intended to bring good fortune to those who deposited them and carved after the image the likeness of the god to whom they were dedicated; or as a god who cured eye disease; abstract symbols of some divinity; idols embodying both male and female element in reproduction; or a solar god26. However, there does not appear to be a controversy regarding the Brak idols being a female divinity27. But Margarete Riemschneider, an authority on eye idols, takes them to be a male divinity - "eye god" - and believes that in very ancient times the cult of "eye god" was universal 28. He was the great deity of the nomads, those wanderers over the desert whose eyes were accustomed to survey the tractless waste and pierce to limitless horizons. His cult was Vol. IX, pp. 33-36. The enormous number (20, 000 complete or fragmentary) in which they were made to be deposited as ex-voto by devotees in the temple has caused Mallowan to suggest half -jokingly that the sale of these pious objects may have constituted a priestly "racket" (ibid., p. 156). 25 Ibid., p. 201. 26 Ibid., pp. 151, 153, 155, 156 and 209. 27 E.

In view of the controversy regarding the eye idols in West Asia, there might appear some doubt regarding the eye goddesses in India. But, as already discussed, the Indian figurines, from the circles indicative of breasts and the pronounced curve of hips of fig. 3, appear in all probability to be a female divinity and hence their appellation "eye goddess". About their definite use we have to agree with Mallowan who observes that their interpretation, like that of others, must remain uncertain in the absence of written records. Thus, in the non-existence of any concrete evidence, whatever we say about their use is bound to be nothing if not hypothetical. A casual glance at the figurines shows that they do not have any perforation for suspension with the solitary exception of fig. 1. But otherwise it should be noted that even without a perfo- ration they could have been used as amulets by tying them with a thread. Some of the types, especially fig. 10, 11 and 12 might have been used as votive offerings as it would have been difficult to suspend them by a thread. In any case it is the most important factor that they all have been carved with eyes. And even some of the Harappan seals have a pair of eyes carved at their back (fig. 14). Therefore it can be said that all the figures belong to the same family. The eye motif employed on them bespeaks of their being used to ward off the "evil eye". In fact the eye motif - the "mysterious eye" - employed on beads, amulets and the like, was meant to ward off the "evil eye" and was a very common motif throughout the ancient world. The eyes on some of the Harappan figurines appear to have been painted. Mackay noticed that "eyes" on a flat strip of ivory were filled in with black and red pigments of which traces remain 30. This also was the case with the eye idols from Brak the eyes of which had originally been filled in with black or dark green paint 31. There is every possibility of the figurines being used for a different pur- pose. The pronounced curve of hips of fig. 3 is indicative of its being used as a fertility deity. Above all one is tempted to compare them with the represen- tations of the goddess Sitala in India. Almost all over the country, particularly in the villages, she is worshipped as a small pox deity and her representations in northern and eastern India are most interesting from the point of view of the present study. In the Panjab her shrines are usually erected by Banias (the merchant community) as thank-offering, and the ring of spots which form round the neck in a particular type of attack, are impersonated as Kandï mòta, the mother of swellings 32. In Uttar Pradesh the likeness of the deity is carved in cowdung, usually a triangle representing the face as in fig. 2, and jowar grains are fixed in it to represent pustules. 29 Ibid. 30 Mackay, op. cit., Vol. II, p. 564, PL CXXV, No. 15. 31 Iraq, Vol. IX, 1947, p. 33. 32 William Crooke, Religion and Folklore of Northern India, (Oxford, 1926), p. 119.</page><page sequence="8">540 M. K. DhavalikAR Anthropos 60. 1965 The ¿itala cult appears to be considerably important in eastern India. In Bengal, poems were composed in the honour of the deity 33. There she is represented by a block of stone, roughly resembling a face, covered with ver- milion and brass points fixed in it. The image is carried by the Dom pandits from door to door, asking for offerings in the name of the deity 34. Sometimes her image is simply a piece of wood with human face carved on it, besmeared with oil and vermilion and studded with spots or nails of gold, silver or brass, in imitation of the pustules of the deity35. However, the most ancient form of the goddess is said to be a piece of stone with eruptions 36. In certain areas of Madhya Pradesh, she is worshipped under the form of rough stones, indented like a honeycomb, to represent the pitting of the malady, placed under a nim tree (Melia azadirachta) 37. It would thus be clear that the representations of Sitala bear a close resemblance with the "eye" goddesses of the ancient past, ¿itala is essentially a folk deity and does not figure in the Vedic pantheon. Her shrines are usually in thè open and she is not generally worshipped in the house of caste Hindus. This is but another proof of her association with non- Aryans. Even the rites of her worship and the conception of her image are all antagonistic to the notion of divinity prevalent in the exalted Aryan society. Further, it should be noted that, pox is a tropical disease and it is, therefore, unlikely that the Aryans had any idea of it. From the generic identity of the representations of ¿itala and the "eye" idols, it would not be far-fetched to surmise that the latter cult continues even today in the form of ¿itala worship. The "eye" idols therefore might have been used as amulets during the pox epidemic. They also might have been used as votive offerings as is done today in some parts of the country, particularly in the Vidarbha districts of Maharashtra where a person dedicates silver images of "eyes" to ¿itala in the hope that his child's sight might be spared 38. The ivory strips with painted eyes, such as those found by Mackay 39, might have been used similarly. Last but not the least important is the distribution of eye idols. As already noted they are confined to the region north of Narmada. And it is only in this region that we find today that the goddess ¿itala is represented with spots on her body. This cannot merely be accidental but can only be said to be be- token of the survival of an age-old Harappan cult 40 through the millennia. 33 D. C.
