<plain_text><page sequence="1">Willard E. Misfeldt The Theme of the Cock in Picasso's Oeuvre To anyone surveying Picasso's total oeuvre it soon becomes apparent that the artist's primary concern throughout his remarkably long career has been with the problems of the human condition, but one observes too that animals and birds as well have significantly occupied the artist's attention. Picasso, the man, seems always to have had a special fondness for members of the animal kingdom. His biographers make numerous references to the pets he has kept-dogs, cats, owls, a monkey, a drawer full of white mice-and to the significance doves have had for him throughout his life. The more prominent members of the Picasso bestiary, particularly the horse and the bull, have been quite thoroughly examined and studied by critics and historians, but little has been done with the iconography of the bird in Picasso's painting and sculpture. Of the three main aviary leitmotifs run- ning through Picasso's work-the owl, the dove, and the cock-it is the cock which seems to attain the greatest power as a symbol, and its continual appearance in his work closely relates to the artist's entire career. In examining this part of Picasso's iconography and trying to determine its possibilities of personal symbol- ism we may first consider the significance which this barnyard fowl has had in Western culture. Doubtless the most universal meaning is as the herald of the dawn, an- nouncing each new day with his shrill, rasping clarion and dispelling the spirits of the night. In the scriptures, the cock's crow assumes a tragic note, marking the time on the morning of the Crucifixion by which Peter would thrice have denied his Lord. Something of the nature of the cock is indicated by the commonplace expression "cock of the walk" to con- vey the idea of swaggering self-assertiveness. It occurs in a number of languages, including French and Spanish, both of which Picasso can call his own. Similar is the bel- licosity of the fighting cock, an aspect certainly known to Picasso and quite possibly admired. Somewhat related to this masculine trait is the commonly known and some- what vulgar meaning attached to the cock as a phallic symbol, while on a less anthropomorphic level are the possibilities that the shape of the bird itself offers as a ve- hicle of artistic inventiveness. The author is a Ph.D. candidate in art history at Wash- ington University. This article is the outgrowth of work done for a seminar conducted by Jean Sutherland Boggs. In a slightly different form it was presented as a graduate paper at the Midwest College Art Conference in Detroit in October, 1966. Mr. Misfeldt is now an assistant profes- .sor in art history at Bowling Green University, Ohio. 0 The first appearance of the cock in Picasso's work comes in 1896 when, at the age of fifteen, he did a page of sketches of cocks in a manner that strongly suggests and awareness of fin de sidcle art in general and an affin- ity with Toulouse-Lautrec, who was to prove an influ- ence in some of Picasso's last works of the nineteenth century as well as in the Blue Period works of the early years of this century (fig. i). It is interesting to note that at this time Toulouse-Lautrec, in collaboration with the author Jules Renard, was himself executing a bestiary in which the cock appears as the first illustration.1 Before 1921 when the cock appears for the first time in an oil painting, Picasso had drawn the bird at least four other times: in 1897, in 1905, in 1907, and in 1917 (not counting his use of the shape of a roasted fowl cut from paper as a design element in a papier colle' of 1913). But these works are of minor significance, amounting to no more than sketches or "doodlings" and with little or no bearing upon the artist's important contemporaneous work. However, the pattern of continuous line in the cock drawings of 1907 and 1917 (figs. 2 and 3), an imag- inative device which Picasso had enjoyed exploiting since childhood, was to achieve fruition in his designs of the 'twenties, especially in the scenery and costumes for the ballet Mercure (1924). Interestingly enough both of these drawings were made during so-called transitional periods in Picasso's career, the first between the Rose Period and Analytical Cubism, the second between Synthetic Cubism and the Classical Period of the 1920's. These were times when Picasso seems to have been searching for a new mode of expression. But, perhaps the main significance of these explorations of the aesthetic possibilities of a single continuous line is that they served as a relief from the harsh angularity of the cubist works and can be consid- ered valuable preliminary work for the extremely sensi- tive linear drawings done from 1918 onward, such as those of ballerinas and bathers. Contemporary with the Three Musicians of 1921, perhaps Picasso's most famous Synthetic Cubist composi- tion, is another well-known painting of this period, Dog and Cock (fig. 4), which marks a return to the theme of the cock. For the first time the cock appears in a large important painting, and it is clear that he plays a more significant role than in any of the earlier appearances, which by comparison to this painting seem like casual sketches. The painting, however, is perhaps less successful as a composition than either of the two versions of the Three Musicians (Museum of Modern Art, N.Y.C., &amp;z Philadelphia Museum of Art). Alfred Barr finds it com- pressed and too narrow for decorative comfort.2 It is, nonetheless, representative of Synthetic Cubism in its 'See A Bestiary by Toulouse-Lautrec, Chicago, The Art Institute of Chicago, 1959, p. 14.

Dog and Cock, oil painting, 1921, Yale University, New Haven spatial ambiguities and its planar manipulations, and, as with most Synthetic Cubist paintings, the color and de- sign elements both contribute toward a highly decorative over-all effect. The manner in which the dog contem- plates the dead cock on the table introduces an element of humor not seen in other cubist works. For Barr, it is a dramatic humor which utilizes the cock's comb and the dog's pink tongue to bring the bristling angular composi- tion to a focus.3 ""Dog and Cock," Art Digest, X (April 15, 1942), p. 16. 147 Misfeldl: The Theme of the Cock in Picasso's Oeuvre</page><page sequence="3">Besides its strong stylistic kinship to the Three Mu- sicians and the Harlequin paintings of that period, the painting also bears a significant thematic relationship to earlier Synthetic Cubist works. In 1919 Picasso did three still-life compositions in which an unplucked, slaugh- tered bird is the principal element in the composition. While any suggestion of a sacrificial offering that may be implicit in a still-life arrangement is fairly remote in these paintings, and even more so in the Dog and Cock, the compositions nevertheless are premonitory of certain paintings done in 1942 and again in 1947 in which the suggestion of sacrifice is quite strong. After the Dog and Cock of 1921, which is a kind of farewell to Synthetic Cubism, eleven years pass before the cock again appears in Picasso's work. His return to the theme in 1932 is in sculpture, an area in which Picasso had previously worked only sporadically. From the early 1930's onward, however, sculpture assumes a greater de- gree of importance in his total output, and in his work in this medium the Cock (fig. 5), modelled in plaster and later cast in bronze, stands as one of the most successful pieces. Its curves have a linearity and grace that recall the continuous line drawing of 1917, but are transformed by the dynamic expression of volume and movement. What makes this particular piece so successful is not only the way in which the graceful curves swing through space and turn back on themselves achieving thereby a remark- able unity of solid and space, but also the spontaneity of the technique of modeling in wet plaster which enhances and reinforces the sense of immediacy and action achieved in the design itself. The rough-textured surface has a sparkling liveliness which heightens the visual plea- sure of following the sweeping curves. Yet the cock cannot be said to have a true symbolic significance in this sculpture. Rather, it appears that the artist's main interest is in exploring the aesthetic possibil- ities offered by the shape of the bird itself and in trans- forming the generalized shapes, typical of his sculpture at this time, into a symphony of powerful rhythms. Of all Picasso's representations of the cock this is the only one that possesses anything of the lithe, slender quality char- acteristic of fighting cocks: all other cocks in his work ap- pear to have the more substantial physical characteristics of the common barnyard variety. As for the distaff side of barnyard fowl, Picasso seems to have had little interest-there are only four or five works representing hens, and only two or three times did he enlarge the theme of the cock to include hens. His ignoring of the female of the species would suggest that the maleness of the cock may have been a subconscious associative value for Picasso, albeit a rather insignificant one. If this was not evident in previous works, the 1932 tapestry design for The Farmer's Wife (fig. 6), contempo- rary with his first sculpture of the cock, would indicate that Picasso intentionally symbolized the popular associa- tion of the bird with male vigor, if only indirectly.

Girl with Cock, oil painting, 1938, Galerie Beyeler, Basel male-female association is less emphatic than the symbol- ism in the bull and horse series of 1921 and 1933 which embody the male and female principles in a forceful manner, but still, given the highly sexual nature of many of the drawings done during the months surrounding the execution of the pastel of The Farmer's Wife, it must cer- tainly be an element. By 1932 Picasso's liaison with Marie-Th&amp;rese Wal- ter, the model for The Farmer's Wife, was already es- tablished. Her firm, healthy figure provides the volup- tuous influence in his work for some time to come. The sensuous curves and the encompassing gesture which characterize this work speak strongly of femininity, even of maternal qualities. The association of the woman with the female bird, whether hen or dove, indicates a meta- phorical allusion to the female principle. The grace and tenderness of this pastel stand in marked contrast to the elements of the violent and the macabre which come to characterize Picasso's work more and more in the latter part of the 'thirties. Throughout his career Picasso had occasionally expressed themes of pathos, and of mysterious foreboding. The Blue Period is filled with pathetic themes; the Three Musicians of 1921 has a somewhat disquieting aspect; the bull and horse drawings of the same year exhibit a pronounced vio- lence; and the Three Dancers of 1925 has an ominous quality. Early in 1930 With the oil painting of the Cruci- fixion (which may owe something to the grotesqueries of Griinewald's Isenheim Altarpiece) Picasso took up three themes which were to prove of great significance for his work later in the decade-the themes of violence, of inhu- manity, and of sacrifice. 149 Misfeldt: The Theme of the Cock in Picasso's Oeuvre</page><page sequence="5">By all odds Picasso's greatest work during this de- cade, which is also perhaps the outstanding achievement of his entire career, is the Guernica mural of 1937. Nu- merous writers have demonstrated the significance of some of the more intensely distorted elements of Picasso's earlier production as they relate to this monumental in- dictment of all that is evil and dark in man. The sur- realism in Picasso's work in the 1920's, his Spanish heri- tage with the national sport of bullfighting stemming as it ultimately does from primitive religious rites of sacri- fice, his series involving the Minotaur, the 1937 etching and aquatint called The Dream and Lie of Franco, and the violent bull and horse drawings of 1921 and the mid- 1930's are all preliminary strains which are brought to- gether in 1937 in one great tragic symphony. The per- sonal symbolism of the latter series in which the bull stands for the male principle and the horse stands for the female principle has been transformed by Picasso in Guernica into more comprehensive human symbols in which the bull or male principle signifies the overwhelm- ing forces of barbarism and the horse or female principle signifies the vulnerability of innocence and uprightness.4 It is in the context of the Guernica mural, seen in conjunction with the earlier related works and along with events in Picasso's personal life, that the Girl with Cock (fig. 7) done early in 1938, must be understood. Pi- casso's personal life in the 1930's was anything but se- rene. His relationship with his wife Olga had become ex- temely difficult, and throughout a good part of the de- cade he was seeking ways to terminate it, including a hoped-for divorce which could not be obtained because of legal complications stemming from his Spanish citizen- ship.5 Early in the decade he had taken a mistress, Marie-Therbse Walter, who was supplanted by Dora Maar in 1936. At this time, while he was trying to free himself of his tenacious wife and while he was making a transition in mistresses, all of which must have been emo- tionally taxing, civil war erupted in his native Spain. How deeply the political situation in his homeland af- fected Picasso is illustrated by the Guernica mural, painted as a commission for the Spanish Pavilion at the 1937 Paris World's Fair and inspired by the saturation bombing of the militarily insignificant Basque town of Guernica. The horror of the tragedy of Guernica is dominated by two of the artist's most persistent symbols-the bull and the horse. In many ways the painting is reminiscent of the Crucifixion of 1930. While the basic religious na- ture of that painting may be questioned, it is undeniably concerned with sacrifice. The Guernica is also concerned with sacrifice, but the sacrificial role of the innocent Mes- siah is played instead by the innocent people as symbol- ized by the horse. The highly disturbing painting of the following February, Girl with Cock, Picasso's most im- portant painting dealing with the theme of the cock and one of his major works, is also concerned with sacrifice and filled with horror. In this painting a fearsome creature, ostensibly a woman but more monster than human, sits in a starkly plain interior holding a trussed cock on her lap. Her thin neck and elongated head reinforce the expression of crass brutality conveyed by the blankly staring eyes and the gaping mouth, suggesting an insatiable appetite for evil. The ambiguously shaped object which she holds in her right hand has been identified as a bowl for catching the blood of the cock which she is about to slaughter.6 With this propitiatory gesture she invokes her evil genius. Transfixed with fear, her victim, the cock, lies across her knees futilely struggling against the crushing grip with which she holds his wings. There remains nothing here of the traditional associations of the cock with the dawn or with the Christian story, nothing of the overbearing arrogance of the bird who struts regally about the barn- yard. In his commentary on the painting, Barr suggests its symbolic implications. "Through the power of Picasso's imagery what might seem perverse and minor sadism takes on the character of hieratic ritual, perhaps even a symbolic significance."' Carol Seeley writes about this painting specifically that it "remarks trenchantly on the soullessness of the times" and more generally, that Pi- casso "cuts through mawkishness to speak boldly of the cruelities of which mankind is capable."'' The former owner of the painting, the American sculptress Mary Cal- lery, a friend of Picasso, has stated that either Picasso or Zervos explained to her that this painting symbolized the destruction of helpless humanity by the forces of evil.9 The girl, then, takes the place of the bull in the Guer- nica and the cock takes the place of the horse, but here the symbolism is more obvious and the destructive intent is plainly evident. Mrs. Callery's statement that it was only reluctantly that Picasso sold her the painting coupled with the fact that he chose to pose with this painting in a photograph taken in his studio the year it was painted, indicates the importance he attached to it. One of the preliminary sketches shows how he stressed the feeling of cruelty in the crushing grip of the girl's fist on the cock's wings * Wilhelm Boeck and Jaime Sabartes, Picasso New York, Harry N.

Fig. 8. Study for Girl with Cock, graphite, 1938 Fig. 9. Woman Slaughtering Goat, cont6 crayon, June 20, 1938 (detail) Fig. 10. Cock, pastel, March 23, 1938 (fig. 8). The theme of the sacrifice of innocent and help- less beings must have obsessed him at this time. A few months later he made a drawing of a similar theme-a woman killing a goat (fig. 9)-perhaps planning to use it for a painting. Here the animal is actually shown being slaughtered on an altar-table, its sacrificial blood run- ning into a bowl on the floor. Taking into consideration the character of much of Picasso's work in this decade, especially the Guernica and its related studies, his reported statement to Mrs. Callery, his reaction to the Civil War in his native Spain, and the fast-moving events that were soon to plunge Europe into history's most terrible war, there can be little doubt that this painting is one which speaks in symbolic terms be- yond those of mere ritual sacrifice. Despite Picasso's state- ment that none of his paintings was symbolic except the Guernica, he had evolved a personal symbolic vocabulary for mankind's brutality, although the meaning of the symbols changes and it is often ambiguous or obscure. One may ask, therefore, if the Girl with Cock can be in- terpreted at various levels and if other symbolic mean- ings should be assigned to the girl and the cock beside those reported by Mrs. Callery. Without an explicit state- ment from the artist the question is perhaps ultimately unanswerable. But one of the significant things about Pi- casso during these years-often overlooked-is that he had become profoundly concerned with broader human is- sues, problems which do not seem to have bothered him during the First World War when the flames that swept Europe seem not to have penetrated the hermetic envi- ronment of his studio. Did it take an involvement of his native Spain to arouse him against man's inhumanity to man? Another question which presents itself relevant to this painting is that of its possible Freudian implications. While again this is something that perhaps cannot be re- solved, it should not be overlooked. In the decade of the 1930's much of Picasso's work is highly sexual in nature, his male-female symbols of horse and bull assume a new significance, and his relationship with three women be- comes most complex and uncomfortable. Can the woman in this painting be seen to stand for womankind in a gen- eral sense about to sacrifice the totemic male on which she depends, or can she be seen to stand, in a more per- sonal sense, for an amalgamation of the three women posing a threat to the integrity of Picasso's male role as symbolized by the cock? Does she perhaps stand only for Dora Maar, the reigning mistress of the moment? Doug- las Cooper sees some resemblance to Dora Maar in this woman, although he does not suggest it to be a portrait likeness.1x If the figure of the woman or creature represents a subconscious identification on the part of Picasso, as sug- gested by Meyer Schapiro's observation that the woman resembles Picasso himself more than she does any woman in his other paintings, does this suggest that Picasso him- self is sacrificing something important to him?11 This last possibility does not seem very likely if the Girl with Cock " Douglas Cooper, letter to the author, November 30, 1966.

The Cock, aquatint, 1937, illustration for Buffon's Natural History is examined in relation to the series of cat and bird paintings of the following year and especially to the paintings of the cat and cock done in 1953 (and discussed later in this article). Seen in conjunction with these works it would seem that there is some kind of Freudian meaning in this painting and that it has to do with a threat to Picasso's male role, which the cock symbolizes. At any rate, it does not seem too presumptuous to de- duce, as Boeck has done with the Guernica, that the pro- tagonists stand at least in a general sense for the respec- tive male and female qhalities of domination and sub- mission, and that here; startlingly, the roles have been re- versed. Fig. 73. Cock and Knife, oil painting, 1947, Private col- lection, New York Fig. 14. Cock, bronze, 1943 (Photo Brassail Another significance of the cock for Picasso at this time is further demonstrated by his return to the subject in several large drawings and pastels done toward the end of March, 1938. Here the cock's shrill clarion sug- gests not the herald of the dawn but rather a watchman sounding an alarum filled with horror and premonition (figs. 10 and 11). It was at this time that Picasso made a statement about the cock to the American painter, Xav- ier Gonzales: "Cocks, there have always been cocks, but like everything else in life we must discover them-just as Corot discovered the morning and Renoir discovered girls . . . Cocks have always been seen, but never as well as in American weather vanes."12 This period marks the ART JOURNAL XXVIII 2 152</page><page sequence="8">apogee of Picasso's discovery of the cock, and it is one of the two high points of his use of it as a powerful vehicle of expression. There remains from this decade one other depiction of the cock. In 1937, a year before the Girl with Cock and during the same year in which Guernica was pro- duced, Picasso executed a series of illustrations for Buf- fon's Natural History. The arrogant, almost burly cock (fig. 12), typical of the Natural History drawings, has a lightness and whimsicality standing in marked contrast to the artist's major work at this time. These drawings seem to have offered Picasso a welcome chance to lay aside his fury just as he did during his visits to Marie- Th6rbse, where he painted portraits of her and of his daughter, activities that served as periodic reliefs from the prevailing gloom of that year.13 In the decade of the 1940's, the theme of the cock appears several times in Picasso's work-a number of times in drawings, paintings, and sculptures in 1943 and 1944 and twice in paintings in 1947. In addition, the theme of a dead bird (though not a cock) on a table, which had been dormant since 1921, is revived in a paint- ing in 1942. The cock theme continues into the World War II years, but it is not until 1953 that it again ap- proaches the expressive power of the works of the late 1930's, and only in the 1947 works is it again obviously related to the theme of sacrifice. In 1947 the blue-grey cock (fig. 13), its throat now slit, lies dead on an ordinary kitchen table whose isolation and severity make it appear almost as an altar. The knife, the instrument of sacrifice, reposes in a blood-filled bowl behind the victim. It is as though the cock has at last fulfilled the sacrificial role as- signed him in 1938, purging the war years' gloom and horror, which often centered about him. Picasso stated toward the end of the Second World War that he had not painted the war, but that he was sure that the war was in his work done during this time.14 Under the sur- veillance of the occupying Nazis, he could, of course, make no overt statements about war and degradation, but austerity and gloom are reflected in the works of that period. The major work of this time, the sculpture of the Man with a Lamb, although not a war topic, has been analyzed by Paul Laporte as a symbol for the contempo- rary predicament of man's relationship to the world and his responsibility for it, a concern which would naturally stem from war conditions.1 It is concerned with the broad theme of sacrifice, and as such, it is related to the Girl with Cock as well as several other paintings in which the cock appears. 12 Ibid., p. 214. " Penrose, op. cit., p. 271. " Maurice Raynal, Picasso, Geneva, Skira, 1953, p. 104. '"Paul M. Laporte, "The Man With the Lamb," Art Journal, XXI, Spring, 1962, pp. 144-150. In the early 1940's there arises the possibility that the cock might serve as a Gallic symbol in the works done during the Nazi occupation. The cock has long stood as a symbol for France or for the French spirit, and Picasso was certainly as anti-Nazi as any other resident of Paris. However, as Douglas Cooper has pointed out, Pi- casso, a famous personality, was much too closely super- vised to participate actively in the Resistance, and, fur- thermore, as a Spaniard was supposedly neutral.'" But, an even more cogent argument against the possibility of Picasso's investing the cocks of the early 1940's with any political meaning is found in Picasso's work itself. With very few exceptions his work is eminently non-political in character. Even in the case of the Guernica, the most notable exception and Picasso's major political state- ment, the symbols can be seen to be personal in origin, and the whole work relates to the artist's native Spain, not to France. In fact, his rare political statements are never related to France. In 1943 Picasso did two sculptures of the cock (figs. 14 and 15). In these the lyrical grace of the cock sculpture of 1932 has been replaced by a stockiness and solidity which are not unlike the monumentality of the Man with a Lamb which was to follow in the next year. The extremely rough-textured surfaces indicate an interest in the effects that it is possible to achieve with modeling materials, a kind of treatment that is wholly appropriate to the massive qualities which the birds themselves pos- sess. The final result is a curious blend of monumental- ity and insouciance, and thus it may be that these cocks represent a kind of defiance and a determination to en- dure although there is certainly no direct symbolism. The last really significant works involving the theme of the cock are the numerous drawings and paint- ings done in December, 1953 which show a fierce cat tear- ing at a lifeless cock (figs. 16 and 17). Like much of Picas- so's work these seem to be autobiographical in nature, and they involve a symbolism that is deeply personal. Compo- sitionally and thematically these works are a return to the cat and bird paintings done in 1939. Roland Penrose attributes these earlier tormented images to the physical misery Picasso endured during his sciatica attack in the winter of 1938.17 It is worth noting that in these earlier images gender is not a significant attribute of either the cat or the bird, whereas in the 1953 works the cat is very obviously female as shown by the pronounced mammar- ies, while the cock, of course, is male. Douglas Cooper points out that these works were done, as he well recalls, at the time when Frangoise Gilot had just left Picasso.'s Penrose, although he does not refer to the cat and cock paintings in this connection, discusses the artist and model series of early 1954 in their relation to the torment " Cooper, op. cit.

Fig. 18. Cock and Dove, graphite, March 28, 1955 brought on by the Picasso-Gilot separation.19 The auto- biographical meaning of the artist and model series seems to be that Picasso, considering himself ageing and aban- doned, was trying to understand more fully the nature of a relationship such as the one that had just been termi- nated by examining it in all possible lights. He seems to be reflecting upon the role he had played in the liaison by exploring the possible images of himself that his part- ner might have held. Throughout the series the role of the artist changes dramatically, but that of the model, a vibrant and aloof young woman, remains fairly constant. The cat and cock paintings and drawings, done just before the artist and model series, are much stronger, much more powerful. Here it seems as if Picasso has equated the female principle with the dead or dying cock. As in the painting of a Girl with Cock, the normal order of male-dominant, female-submissive has been re- versed. The works appear to be the first bitter and tor- mented reaction to the dissolution of the relationship with Frangoise. The cat would seem to stand for Frangoise, and her victim, the cock, for Picasso himself. In the subsequent examination of this relationship in the artist and model series, each protagonist reassumes his normal form, generally speaking, and the search to un- derstand becomes calmer and more reasoned; but, the cat and cock works are anguished, just as their 1939 antece- dents had been. A little over a year later, in two drawings done in March, 1955 (fig. 18), Picasso resuscitated the cock and in- vested it with some of the strongest and most positive qualities he had ever given it. Solid and belligerent, the cock in these drawings defiantly stands guard over the (Continued on page 165) " Penrose, op. cit., pp. 345-346.

Here again are the masculine and feminine qualities of domination and sub- mission, restored now to their proper relationship. Per- haps these are general symbols; perhaps, though, they re- flect a new and contented life with a new companion, a woman who devoted herself completely to the life of her man. Here is the rightful order of things restored-the male dominant, secure, and self-respecting in his strength; the female submissive and retiring. Here, at last, there is no threat to masculinity. It is these two sets of works in the early 1950's deal- ing with the cock theme that argue most strongly for a positive interpretation of that bird as one of the artist's very personal symbols, despite his assertions that he does not paint in symbols. However, the meaning and the in- tensity of the symbol varies. It is not until 1938 that the cock achieves a truly symbolic stature; and, following that date, its symbolic meaning differs in every work in which it appears. The paintings of the 1950's argue strongly for an interpretation of the great painting, Girl with Cock of 1938, in terms not only of general symbols for cruelty and depravity, but also as symbols related to the artist's personal life. Yet, while these symbols do have a very immediate and personal origin, they transcend the bounds of the specific and become more universal in their significance. The cock seems never to have achieved the status that the horse and bull have achieved as major and per- sistent symbols, yet it cannot rank far behind them. For seventy years it is intimately related both to the artist's private life and to his public career. In surveying the work of some seven decades of prolific production it be- comes apparent that the cock is not only the most impor- tant of Picasso's aviary themes, but it is also the single most persistent theme of any kind after man himself. 165 Weller: Frederick Carl Frieseke: The Opinions of an American Impressionist</page></plain_text>
