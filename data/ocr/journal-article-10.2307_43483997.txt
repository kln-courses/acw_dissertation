<plain_text><page sequence="1">ICONOGRAPHIC GLEANINGS FROM EPIGRAPHY by C. SIV ARAMAM UR TI, M. A. Keeper National Museum of India , New Delhi For the study of early Indian iconography, texts on the subject are not very readily available and very often inscriptions throw a great light on iconographie problems. In ancient India the worship of Yakshas and Nāgas was very popular and the epics and Purāņas as also the early Buddhist texts mention these early objects of worship. Inscriptions pointedly mentioning by name different deities known to us from literature have helped in no small measure to understand their correct form as conceived by sculptors in the contemporary world around. Yakshas are mentioned by name in several sculptures representing them on the rail from Bhārhut. We have thus Yaksha Kubera mentioned in the early letters of the 2nd century B. C. running kupîro yakho . Yakshas Sūchiloma ( Suchilomo ), Ajakālaka ( Ajakalako ), Supravasa ( Supãvasa), Chakravāka (Chakavãko), Virůdhaka ( Virudako ) , Gangita (Gamgito) are also mentioned thus by name. Yakshî Sudarsanā (Yakhinî Sudasana) is a dryad of this class as also Chanda Yakshî (Chadã Yakhî). Of the Devatās the goddess Sirimā is mentioned by name in the label close ot her sculpture which is one of the most attractive from Bhārhut. Another Devatā is Chulakokā. Among Nāgarājas are Chakravāka ( Chakavako nāg arājā ) and Erapata (Erapato nāgarājā), we know from inscriptions at Bhārhut. Among the heavenly nymphs so famous in literature we have representations of four with labels describing them as they gladden the celestial world on the enlightenment of Buddha. Alambushā, Miśrakeśi, Padmāvatī and Subhadrā are mentioned in these labels. At Patna two early Yakshas were discovered with inscriptions mentioning them as Nandi and Vardhana. Similarly, Nāga worship being greatly prevalent and Nāgas being particularly associated with reservoirs of water, there are inscriptions giving their names and the dedication of shrines to them. A small image in the Mathurā Museum bears the name Dadhikarņa The inscription is in Kushāņa Brāhmī and reads dadhikarnna and points to very early attention paid to the Nāga deities in this area. An inscription preserved in the Lucknow Museum mentions a temple of Dadhikarņa Nāga that existed at the site of Huvishka's</page><page sequence="2">Fig. i. - Yaksha Chandramukha, 2nd century B. C., from Amara vati, Guntur Dist 36 C. S1VARAMAMURTI monastery at Jamalpur and this sculpture of Nāga with the name Dadhikarņa preserved in the Mathurā Museum shows the wide popularity of the Nāga. Another inscription on the back of a badly mutilated sculpture representing Nāgarājas from Rajgir in the Mathurā Kushāņa style mentioning maņināga is interesting as it gives the name of a Nāgarāja whose sacred abode as stated in the Mahãbhãrata is Rājagriha and this inscription is obviously most illuminating. Another Maņibhadra Yaksha from Pawaya is now in the Gwälior Museum. That the worship of the Yakshas and Nāgas was not confined to North India alone and that even in the South this was the common practice is clearly indicated by a very valuable inscription from Amarāvatī. This ^ij inscription is in letters of the 2nd century B. C. and though very short, mentions the name of the Yaksha and his abode represented in a sculpture of the first period on which it is incised (fig. 1). The inscription runs yakho chadamukho baku (la ) nivãsi (1). This mentions both the name of the Yaksha worshipped in the area and his chaitya vriksha, the tree near which his shrine should have been erected. Though many of these early inscriptions are fragmentary they still supply a (1) Yaksha Chandramukha (the moon-faced one) residing in the Bakula tree (Mimusops Elengi ).</page><page sequence="3">ICONOGRAPHIC GLEANINGS FROM EPIGRAPHY 37 fund of information on iconography of the deities in vogue in ancient India. The usual study of iconography is from texts on the subject like Silpa works, encyclopaedic works like Vishnudharmottara and chapters from regular Purāņas like Agnipurāņa. Iconography is dealt with in books dealing with other subjects and one such is the Brihatsamhitã. The iconographie portion of a dharma-śastra work like the Chaturvar- gachintāmaņi is another example. The purpose of this paper is to show that epigraphical passages, specially the invocatory verses, enlighten the student of iconography as much as the rest. It is interesting to note that as these are not compositions for the purpose of explaining iconography as such, the information on the subject is naturally less strained than that of the Silpa texts and naturally lack the pedantic and finicky descriptive detail but are yet characterised by a charm born of natural and spontaneous description which is often very suggestive and unconsciously points out the most noteworthy features of iconographie representations just from the areas whence the inscriptions originate. This geographical element is as noteworthy as the time element which is found suggested in these epigraphical lines unconsciously illuminating iconography. LOKAPĀLAS In some early inscriptions like the Pikira grant of Pallava Simhavarman of the 5th century A. D., the earlier concept of four Lokapālas is indicated by reference to the rei- gning king as the fifth Lokapāla. Till nearly the end of the Gupta period the concept of the Lokapālas was simpler than that of latter period. Yama, Kubera, Varuņa and Indra were the prin- cipal Lokapālas. The line lokapālānām pañchamasya (i) in Simhavarman's inscription, dhanadavarunendrãntakasamasya (2) of the early Gupta inscriptions beginning with the Allāhābād inscription of Samudragupta are all suggestive of the tradition of four Lokapālas as they are clearly depicted guarding Mâyâdevî in the sculptures from Amarāvatī of the 2nd century A. D. (fig. 2). Fig. 2. - lokapālas guarding May ade vi 2nd century A. D. from Amarāvatī, Gun tur Dist (1) The fifth Ļokapāla, Protector of the worlds. Epi- graph. Ind., VIII, p. 161.

In the Elephanta cave, in the Ellora cave and in many of the Paliava structural temples, panels of Rāvaņānugrahamūrti abound. The description of this mūrti is therefore prominently mentioned in the Paliava inscription of Srīnidhi from Sāļuvankuppam. yasyângushthabharâkrãntah kailāsab sadasānanah / pātālamagamanmūrdhnā irīnidhistam bibharty ay am 1 1 (2) This Rāvaņānugrahamūrti is described in the opening verse of the Dewal praśasti of Lalla. helāngushthāgrapīdābharanamadachalotsangasambhāradūra- bhrasyadbhâbhãratiryagdalitamaniphanãmandale bhogirãje / tatkãlodbhrãntalokatritayakritamahãstotramantrãvatãrah pãyãdvah pārvatīsas éamitadaéasiraésauryavîryâvalepah // (3) Here the ease with which Siva pressed down the mountain Kailāsa terrifically shaken by the ten-headed demon is clearly portrayed. In the sculpture of Rāvaņa shaking the mount Kailāsa from Ellora (fig. 6) and elsewhere the ten heads of Rāvaņa and the mighty act of shaking a great mountain are graphically portrayed like an illustration of such description as this. But in another, a Kalachuri inscription from Kasia, a verse describes the joy experienced by Siva as Pārvatī embraced him in her sudden fright at the terrific shake of the mountain, beautiful portrayal of which in the centre of the Rāvaņānugraha panel as the most important theme makes it so attractive. drishtvā kopaparān mukhīm girisutãm sandhyãpranãmershyayã tatkãlochitachãruchãiughatanâparyyãkulastatkshanam / paulastayorjjitadordvayl trastayã pâyâdvas suchiram tayã hathakritãsleshotsavah śankarah // (4) REVANTA The geographical area from which the inscription emanates is clearly an index to the iconographie form of the deity described for it is always the type of the locality that is (1) May that form of the lovers of Urnā and Ramā, which has both dispassion and passion, wears garlands of human heads and flowers, dons tiger and elephant hide and costly garments, wears snakes as well as pearl-strings, smears itself with ashes as well as perfumes, and is both fearful and auspicious, give you both enjoyment and salvation.

Epigraph. Ind., X, p. 8. (3) May the Iyord of Pārvatī, who humbled the pride of prowess and strength of the ten -headed Rāvaņa, by the great pressure caused by the playful pressing of the tip of his great toe and consequent sinking of the mountain slopes and the weight of the earth scattered afar splitting across the jewelled hoods of the king of snakes (Sesha), the three worlds suddenly amazed and commencing great hymns in his praise, protect you. Epigraph. Ind., I, p. 77.

Comparison of a prince to Revanta on a horse (fig. 7) cannot certainly occur in an inscription from South India and the very occurrence of this locates the inscription somewhere north of Deccan ; and a line chaturasturagãrãdho revanta iva govanah (i) is from the inscription of Yadava Simghaņa from a ruined temple at Patna. VISHNU CONSORT OF ŚRI AND SARASVATĪ Another instance is a verse describing the sportive taunt of Sarasvatī 'towards Vishnu who after embracing Kamalā with his chest covered with the marks of creeper decoration from her breasts approches Sarasvatī who tauntingly expresses her great concern at the possible disappearance of these marks serving as a new vanamãlã , the moment he embraced her. gādhopagūdhakamalākuchakumbhapatramudrānkitena vapushã pariripsamāņah / mã lupyatãmabhinavã vanamãliketi vãgdevatopahasitostu hariś śriye vah 1 1 (2) This concept of Vishņu as the spouse of Sri and Saravatī is possible only in a North Indian icon (fig. 8), as in South India it is invariably Srl and Bhudevī who are the consorts of Vishņu. The inscription is from Bhuvanesvar. GANEŚA Ganeśa in South India always wears a karandamukula . Images of Ganeśa with jatãmukuta are unknown though they are the regular feature in Orissa (fig. 9), Bihar, Bengal and many other places in North India. It is no wonder therefore that in a description of Ganeśa in the Chintra pr asas ti from Chaulukyan area in Gujarat the description of Ganeśa in the invocatory verse represents him with the usual single tusk, elephant's head and jatãmukuta. trailokyamaňgalam anaňgariporapatyam ankūritaikadašanollasadānanasrīh / devah prapadya hridayaikapadîm kapardī bhãyãdanekapamukhas súkhasampade vàh / / (3) NATEŚA Similarly the multi-armed form of Nateśa which Kālidāsa describes as bhujataruvana is an invariable feature in North Indian sculpture while the four-armed figure of the (1) Govana an accomplished horse-rider like Revanta.

The Alińgana-Chandra- šekharamūrti or Pradoshamūrti is a fourth nominally but essentially it is not different from Umāsahita except that Siva in shown embracing Pārvatī. This embrace in Alińgana- Chandrasekharamürti depicts the deities stan- ding. Siva embracing Pārvatī in seated Fig. 10. - Natesa, 8th century A.

Umā is seated on Siva's lap while the lord embraces her. But he does not embrace her in the way he is depicted in North Indian sculpture. Here, in North Indian sculpture, he not only embraces Pārvatī but also presses her breast and caresses her chin as well. This caressing of the chin and pressing the breast of Pārvatī while embra- cing is the most characteristic feature of the Northern type of Siva and Pārvatī of which there are very fine examples in Uttar Pradesh (fig. 11), Bihar, Bengal and Orissa. One or both of these features which invariably occur in Northern sculptures should therefore be expected in iconographie description from the area.

SIVARAMAMURTI It should be remembered that this boar has deities of all the three worlds Siddhas, Sädhyas, Nagas, Yakshas, Chandra, Sùrya, Varuna, in short from every region, sky and netherworld included, all on its body and therefore it is truly the pillar of the mansion of the three worlds. In North Indian sculpture such zoomorphic representations of Vishņu as Varāha abound in early and later mediaeval periods apart from the regular anthropomorphic representations which are found everywhere. In a Kâkatîya inscription from Kānchīpuram this concept of depicting the three worlds on the body of the boar is explained in greater detail making mountains, streams, elephants of the quarters, the ocean, in fact everything occupy every bristle of the animal yaddehe tanulomakūpavivare sailã nagā diggajã nadyas saptasamudramudritamahîvistâramadhyâsate / damshtrãdandakarãlakãlavadanaê érllanghitãgrãsano līlākolakalebarah sa murabhid payãdapãyãdbhuvam 1 1 (i) In sculpture actually every bristle of the animal is composed of some deity or other, a mountain deity or a river nymph or Samudrarāja himself. This element in the Kâkatîya inscription is probably due to northern contacts that this kingdom had towards its northern border. In the regular anthropomorphic form of Varāha there is a peculiar feature occurring in early mediaeval sculpture all over India. Šēshanāga is shown paying obeisance to the lord from near his feet as he rises from the ocean, the water and foam of which are suggested in sculpture by conchs and shells and lotuses as convention would require it (fig. 13).

Epigraph. Ind., XI, p. 190.

Beautiful representations of this mürti are known from Orissa (fig. 16) and all the fearful aspects of Bhairava may here be observed. Stuck on the tip of the trident piercing his heart the body of Andhakāsura appears like the top of an umbrella with the handle of the trident itself as the handle. An accurate and perfect description of this sculptural form specifically stating the combination of Bhairava and Andhakāsurasamhāra elements is given in the opening verse of Ranabhañjadeva's grants from Orissa. samhãrakãlahutabhugvikarãlaghorasambhrãntakimkarakritãntanitãntabhinnam / bhinnândhakãsuramahãgahanãtapatram tadbhairavam haravapurbhavatah prapãtu // (1) PĀŅDURANGA Coming from the region of Paņdharpur is the verse describing Krishna in an inscription of Bhillama from Gadag avatu sa vah kansãrih kumudaruchirbhãti yatkare êamkhah / kshīrābdhimathanasambhramasankrāntah phenupuñja iva 1 1 (2) Here the form represents him with a conch in his hand white like foam from the milky ocean. It may be remembered that Krishna in his Pāņduranga form may be represented both with his hands on his hip and with a conch in one of them. A lovely example of this type of Krishna is found near a sacred tank in Tirupati all around which are placed a number of fine stone sculptures (fig. 17). GANGĀDHARA Though in earlier sculpture Gangādhara is represented with due emphasis on the descent of the Ganges on to his locks as in the representation at the Elephanta cave (fig. 18), and the Paliava cave at Tiruchirāpalli, from the time of Rāj arāja the great and even earlier the Gangādhara panel lays greater emphasis on the displeasure of Pārvatī at the prospect of a co-wife specially when she is to occupy the crest of Siva ; and Siva is shown conciliating Pārvatī with very great effort as in the Gangaikoņdachoļapuram panel (fig. 19). This is beautifully described in some of the invocatory verses in epigraphy describing Gangādhara. Though in the fragmentary verse of Srīdhara's Dēvapattaņa pr aśas ti from Somanāthpātan (i) May that terrible Bhairava form of Siva protect you, which, distinct from that of his serf Yama but fearfully dreadful enough to frighten even Death on account of its fire of deluge, and with the great umbrella composed of Andhakā- sura (stuck on his trident by which he was) pierced, well protect you.

In South Indian sculpture Gajāntakamūrti is a special form not to be confused with Andhakāri but in Western India, in the Deccan and in Orissa the two concepts go in one icon.
