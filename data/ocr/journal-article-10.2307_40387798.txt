Dionysius' method consists of the presentation of a Platonic ontology by way of biblical theonyms. These theonyms express whatever we can grasp of God by His self-communication toward us, yet they ultimately cannot reveal Him as He is. It is rewarding to compare biblical theonym and author's allonym at this point: the allonym "Dionysius Areopagita" expresses how the author wants to be read and received but not who he really is. Thus the Dionysian writings present themselves as if they were the communication of an early Christian author whose objective it is to proclaim the "unknown God" to philosophically educated Greeks, naming Him with the biblical theonyms and explaining them in a Platonic way. God and the Worm: The Twofold Otherness in Pseudo-Dionysius's Theory of Dissimilar Images, ENRICA RUARO The aim of my paper is to call attention to Dionysius' kataphatic theology and, in particular, to an aspect which is not commonly discussed: the dissimilar images applied to God. More precisely, I will focus on the image of the worm, which Dionysius considers the vilest and most dissimilar image applied to the divine Thearchy. I will try to show that the worm, with its multiple and contradictory attributes, is indeed the best example for Dionysius' "absurd theology" of the dissimilar images, since it perfectly fits the complex and paradoxical Dionysian view of the relationship/nonrelationship between God and the world. * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of the Review.

In the case of Plotinus, this approach can be described as a "taking away" (aphairesis): as the One is in its purity present to the soul, the task of the soul consists in taking away - that is, removing - all positive approaches. The case of Proclus is different as he departs from a different metaphysical presupposition: taking away will not work, because the One as it is remains distant from the soul. Instead he pleads for an approach by means of negations (apophaseis), which ought to awaken our awareness of the totally different character of the trace of the One in us, but can never lead to an experience of the One as it is. The two approaches function in different metaphysical contexts. Hence, it may be surprising that Pseudo-Dionysius, a keen reader not only of Proclus but also of Plotinus, invokes both approaches and thinks them reconcilable. This essay attempts to describe the nature of this compatibility and to reconstruct the metaphysical context that it presupposes. Not Not: The Method and Logic of Dionysian Negation, TIMOTHY D. KNEPPER This paper examines the basic differences between Dionysius' two principal terms for negation, aphairesis and apophasis, expounding most of the passages in which these terms appear in order to support the claim that aphairesis functions as Dionysius' method of hymning the hyper-being God through the removal of "beings" (by means of narrow-scope predicate-term negation), while apophasis constitutes Dionysius' logic of interpreting these removed beings excessively rather than privatively. It then argues that, although aphairesis "removes" and apophasis "exceeds," these two types of negation function cohesively in the Dionysian corpus, although in doing so they suggest a different overall picture of Dionysian negation from that which is commonly attributed to Dionysius. It is not the case that Dionysius' negation of predicate terms should be read propositionally, that is to say, as "It is not the case that God is p." Rather, when interpreted apophatically, Dionysius' "not-p" signifies "more-p-than-most-p." Recent Attempts to Define a Dionysian Political Theory, L. MICHAEL HARRINGTON The Dionysian corpus makes virtually no statement about the authority of kings or the structure of nations, but it has nevertheless repeatedly been the subject of political analysis. Several scholars have recently sketched out a Dionysian politics by drawing analogies between the Dionysian church and the city, and between the Dionysian bishop and the emperor. These analogies are of limited usefulness. They show that Dionysius does employ Platonic political language to describe the ecclesiastical hierarchy, but they risk</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 973 overlooking or downplaying the hierarchy's nontemporal, and therefore nonpolitical, activity. A more fruitful ground for developing a Dionysian politics may be found in his brief discussion of the legal hierarchy, which provides practical instruction for action in the temporal realm without direct reference to the contemplative activity of the church. The Divine Names in John Sarracenas Translation: Misconstruing Dionysius's Language about God? JOHN D. JONES This paper draws on earlier research to develop contrasts between interpreting the conception of God in the Divine Names in terms of Neoplatonic, Latin Scholastic (specifically Albertinian and Thomistic), and Byzantine/Eastern Christian frameworks. Based on these contrasts, this essay then explores whether Albert the Great and Thomas Aquinas were influenced, and possibly led astray, by John Sarracenas translation of key terms and phrases in the Divine Names such as hyper, hyperousios and its cognates, ho ti pote estin, hyparxis, and hyperousiotes. The paper concludes that Sarracenas mistranslation of hyparxis by essentia clearly reinforces an essentialist interpretation of God in the Divine Names - that is, the view that God is an absolutely simple being identical to its essence. It is not clear that his translations of the other terms do the same, although they are most often read in an essentialist fashion by Albert and Aquinas. Misrepresenting Neoplatonism in Contemporary Christian Dionysian Polemic: Eriugena and Nicholas of Cusa versus Vladimir Lossky and Jean-Luc Marion, WAYNE J. HANKEY This paper contrasts the reception of Dionysius in relation to non- Christian philosophy during the Latin Middle Ages with his reception in twentieth-century Christian thought. The medievais, including Eriugena, Thomas Aquinas, Nicholas of Cusa, and many others, as a rule refuse to divide religion from philosophy and they distinguish or unite thinkers by their teaching rather than by their confessional adherence. Hence they see no need to set Dionysius in opposition to non-Christian philosophers such as Plato, Aristotle, and Proclus, or to repudiate the latter in favor of the former. By contrast, Vladimir Lossky and Jean-Luc Marion, with their shared background in Etienne Gilson, celebrate Dionysius in opposition to the non-Christian Neoplatonists, whom they polemically misrepresent as reducing God to conceptual categories. These twentieth-century figures evince a sectarian religious narrowness that blinds them to the textual and philosophical community of Dionysius with his non-Christian sources. The Revelation of the Phenomena and the Phenomenon of Revelation: An Apology for Dionysius's Phenomenological Appropriation, JOHN PANTELEIMON MANOUSSAKIS The present essay is apologetic in as much as it aims to justify as well as to explain the philosophical appropriation of Dionysian metaphysics by</page><page sequence="4">974 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS contemporary French phenomenology, especially by the work of Jean-Luc Marion. It should be noted that Dionysius serves as the inspiration, direct or indirect, of many authors in the contemporary French school, among whom the most notable are Jacques Derrida, Jean-Louis Chrétien, and Jean-Yves Lacoste. The present essay will focus particularly on the convergence between Dionysius' theology and Marion's phenomenology. AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 46, No. 1 , January 2009 Stuff, KRISTIE MILLER Linguistically, we distinguish between thing terms and stuff terms, where, roughly, "thing" is a count noun, and "stuff' is a mass noun. Syntactically, "thing" functions as a singular referring term, that is, a term that refers to a single "entity" and hence takes "a" and "every" and is subject to pluralization, while "stuff functions as a plural referring term, that is, it refers to a plurality of "entities" and hence takes "some" and is not subject to pluralization. There exists a thing and some stuff. Contextual Adaptation, JAMES ROSS The question is about contextual adaptation of meaning, a matter of philosophy of language, occasioned here by a disagreement among philosophers of religion about whether words, like "knows," "wills," "loves," "commands," "does," used for common attributes of humans and the divine, and even "exists" as applied to both, mean the same or acquire divergences of meaning from the discourse contexts. I call the first group "reformers" and the other "analogists." Analogists think the reformers are anthropomorphic, contributing to popular naive imaginings about God as "a person like us," while the reformers think the analogists are grafting Hellenic ideas onto biblical faith. That is not a new dispute, of course. But there is a separable linguistic facet of it, examined here, that has wider applications to philosophy in general. Some New Monadic Value Predicates, NICOLAS ESPINOZA Some things have positive value and some things have negative value. The things with positive value are good and the things with negative value are bad. There are also things in-between that are neither good nor bad, which are neutral. All in all, then, there are three monadic value predicates: "good," "bad," and "neutral."</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 975 Love , Identification, and the Emotions, BENNETT W. HELM Recently there has been a resurgence of philosophical interest in love, resulting in a wide variety of accounts. Central to most accounts of love is the notion of caring about your beloved for his sake. Yet such a notion needs to be carefully articulated in the context of providing an account of love, for it is clear that the kind of caring involved in love must be carefully distinguished from impersonal modes of concern for particular others for their sakes, such as moral concern or concern grounded in compassion. That is, we might say, the kind of caring that is central to love must be somehow distinctly intimate. The trouble is to cash out these firm intuitions in a satisfactory way. Multiple Universes and Observation Selection Effects, DARREN BRADLEY The fine-tuning argument can be used to support the Many Universe hypothesis; however, the Inverse Gambler's Fallacy objection seeks to undercut the support for the Many Universe hypothesis. The objection is that although the evidence that there is life somewhere confirms Many Universes, the specific evidence that there is life in this universe does not. I will argue that the Inverse Gambler's Fallacy is not committed by the fine-tuning argument. The key issue is the procedure by which the universe with life is selected for observation. Once we take account of the procedure, we find that the support for the Many Universe hypothesis remains. Recent Social-Scientific Work on Interdependent, Independent, and Bicultural Selves: The Moral Implications, KRISTJAN KRISTJANSSON Throughout the history of moral philosophy, most of its best-known practitioners have occupied positions antithetical to moral relativism. With a number of significant exceptions and caveats, which need not be rehearsed here, one could go as far as saying that the history of moral philosophy is the history of an ongoing battle against such relativism in its various forms and guises, ranging from the man-is-the-measure-of-all-things doctrine of the Sophists, to early twentieth-century anthropologically inspired cultural relativism, late twentieth-century power-focused poststructuralist discourse, and the ever-present moral subjectivism of first-year undergraduate students. Nor is there an end in sight; this battle seems to be a never-to- be-completed Sisyphean task.</page><page sequence="6">976 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 46, No. 2, April 2009 Content Internalism About Indexical Thought, MICHAEL PELCZAR Properly understood, content internalism is the thesis that any difference between the representational contents of two individuals' mental states reduces to a difference in those individuals' intrinsic properties. Some of the strongest arguments against internalism turn on the possibility for two doppelgangers - perfect physical and phenomenal duplicates - to differ with respect to the contents of those of their mental states that they can express using terms such as "I," "here," and "now." This paper grants the stated possibility but denies that it poses any threat to internalism. Despite their similarities, doppelgangers differ in some of their intrinsic properties, and it is to such intrinsic differences that differences of indexical content reduce. Explaining the Value of Truth, ALLEN COATES William James claimed that truth is "good in the way of belief (1975, p. 42), and it is widely held that beliefs aim at truth. The basic idea is that a belief is good (or successful, or correct) just in case it is true. If beliefs are good just in case they have a certain property, one may well infer that they are good because they have that property. So it is tempting to conclude that truth is a good-making property for beliefs. This paper will argue that we should resist this temptation and deny that truth is a good-making property. This is not to deny that truth is a value, however, since one can reject the idea that truth is a good-making property while retaining the idea that a belief is good just in case it is true. An Argument Against Causal Theories of Mental Content, TODD BURAS Some mental states are about themselves. Nothing is a cause of itself. So some mental states are not about their causes; they are about things distinct from their causes. If this argument is sound, it spells trouble for causal theories of mental content - the precise sort of trouble depending on the precise sort of causal theory. This paper shows that the argument is sound (§§I-III), and then spells out the trouble (§IV). Free Will and Reasonable Doubt, BENJAMIN VILHAUER The purpose of this paper is to raise what the author takes to be an old and widely shared worry about free will in a new way. (In this paper, "free will" is used to mean whatever satisfies the control condition of moral responsibility.) The worry has to do with the connection between free will</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 977 and retributive justifications of harm. No one can deserve to be harmed because of how he has acted unless he was morally responsible for that action, and no one can be morally responsible for an action unless he had free will with respect to that action, or with respect to some earlier action that determined the later action. However, when one surveys the long history of unresolved conflict in the free will debate, one may wonder whether the grounds for believing that people have free will are strong enough to bear the weight of such justifications. What is new in this paper is the argument hat this worry is very important. The term "the free will debate" refers to the debate about whether anyone ever has free will. (There are, of course, other important debates about free will, but the term will be used to refer to this particular debate for the sake of conciseness.) Fictional Characters as Abstract Objects: Some Questions, REINA HAYAKI Sir Arthur Conan Doyle wrote fifty-six short stories and four novels about Sherlock Holmes, collectively known as the Canon. The following are all true facts about the Canon: (1) It is true according to the Canon that Sherlock Holmes is a detective. (2) It is true according to the Canon that Queen Victoria hired a private consulting detective, gave him an emerald tie pin, and offered him a knighthood, which he refused. (3) The Canon is about Sherlock Holmes. (4) The Canon is about a brilliant private detective who solves many crimes that baffle Scotland Yard. (5) The Canon is also about Queen Victoria (among other things). This paper argues that the truth of these and similar facts creates some tension for the theory that fictional characters are abstract objects. A proponent of this theory will have to treat sentences (1) and (2) as disanalogous, and (3) to (5) as similarly disanalogous, in a way that undercuts part of the motivation for accepting an ontology of fictional characters. Do Moral Flaws Enhance Amusement? AARON SMUTS Can moral flaws make attempts at humor more amusing? Defenders of comic immoralism think so. They argue that the putatively immoral violations of the norms of propriety and good taste add to the outrageousness of some jokes. Since the added outrageousness seems to make jokes funnier, they conclude that some moral flaws with jokes can make the latter more amusing. This all seems fairly intuitive. Consider the aristocrats joke: In the abstract the joke is about a family theater group that pitches a new routine to a promoter. The routine usually involves graphic acts of incest, violence, and general perversion. After the family members perform the routine, the promoter asks "What do you call it?" The father replies, "The Aristocrats."</page><page sequence="8">978 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Since the punch line is not the slightest bit amusing, the humor of the joke is entirely dependent on the degree of salaciousness that the teller can achieve in describing the acts. Moral Saints, Moral Monsters, and the Mirror Thesis, PETER BRIAN BARRY Now, there can exist no irritating juxtaposition of dissimilar personalities comparable to that which is possible aboard a great warship fully manned and at sea. There, every day among all ranks, almost every man comes into contact with more or less every other man. In order to avoid even the sight of an aggravating object one must needs give it Jonah's toss or jump overboard one's self. This paper imagines how all of this might eventually operate on some peculiar human creature the direct reverse of a saintl AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 86, No. 4, December 2008 If It Itches, Scratch! RICHARD J. HALL Many bodily sensations are connected quite closely with specific actions: itches with scratching, for example, and hunger with eating. Indeed, these connections have the feel of conceptual connections. With the exception of D. M. Armstrong, philosophers have largely neglected this aspect of bodily sensations. This paper proposes a theory of bodily sensations that explains these connections. The theory ascribes intentional content to bodily sensations, but not, strictly speaking, representational content. Rather, the content of these sensations is an imperative: in the case of itches, "Scratch!" The view avoids nonintentional qualia and hence accords with what could be called, generalizing Lycan slightly, the "hegemony of intentionality." Are There Irreducibly Normative Properties? BART STREUMER Frank Jackson has argued that, given plausible claims about supervenience, descriptive predicates and property identity, there are no irreducibly normative properties. Philosophers who think that there are such properties have made several objections to this argument. This paper argues that all of these objections fail. It concludes that Jackson's argument shows that there are no irreducibly normative properties.</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 979 Reflectance Realism and Colour Constancy: What Would Count As Scientific Evidence for Hubert's Ontology of Colour? M. CHIRIMUUTA Reflectance realism is an important position in the philosophy of color. This paper is an examination of David R. Hubert's case for there being scientific support for the theory. The specific point in question is whether color science has shown that reflectance is recovered by the human visual system. Following a discussion of possible counter-evidence in the recent scientific literature, the paper makes the argument that conflicting interpretations of the data on reflectance recovery are informed by different theoretical assumptions about the nature of color, and of perception. If this is so, there cannot be neutral empirical evidence on this point, and this does seem to undermine Hubert's claim for empirical support. In the end, this essay suggests alternative ways of thinking about the relationship between color ontology and empirical work on color. The Liar Paradox and the Inclosure Schema, EMIL BADICI In Beyond the Limits of Thought (2002), Graham Priest argues that logical and semantic paradoxes have the same underlying structure (which he calls the "Inclosure Schema"). He also argues that, in coryunction with the Principle of Uniform Solution (same kind of paradox, same kind of solution), this is sufficient to "sink virtually all orthodox solutions to the paradoxes" because the orthodox solutions to the paradoxes are not uniform. I argue that Priest fails to provide a nonquestion-begging method to "sink virtually all orthodox solutions," and that the Inclosure Schema cannot be the structure that underlies the Liar paradox. Moreover, Ramsey was right in thinking that logical and semantic paradoxes are paradoxes of different kinds. Defending the Phenomenal Concept Strategy, E. DIAZ-LEON One of the main strategies against conceivability arguments is the so- called phenomenal concept strategy, which aims to explain the epistemic gap between physical and phenomenal truths in terms of the special features of phenomenal concepts. Daniel Stoljar has recently argued that the phenomenal concept strategy has failed to provide a successful explanation of this epistemic gap. This paper's aim is to defend the phenomenal concept strategy from his criticisms. It argues that Stonar has misrepresented the resources of the strategy, which can indeed accomplish the required explanatory task, once it is properly understood. A Gunk-friendly Maxcon, GREGORY FOWLER Hud Hudson has argued that if MaxCon, Ned Markosian's favored answer to the Simple Question, is true, then there couldn't be gunky objects. If Hudson's argument succeeds, then those who believe that gunky objects are possible have a good reason to reject MaxCon. However, I show that</page><page sequence="10">980 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Hudson's argument relies on substantive metaphysical claims that a proponent of MaxCon need not accept. Thus, one who endorses MaxCon need not reject the possibility of gunky objects and those who believe that gunky objects are possible need not reject MaxCon. AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY, Vol. 87, No. 1 , March 2009 Is Vagueness Sui Generis? DAVID BARNETT On the dominant view of vagueness, if it is vague whether Harry is bald, then it is unsettled, not merely epistemically, but metaphysically, whether Harry is bald. In other words, vagueness is a type of indeterminacy. On the standard alternative, vagueness is a type of ignorance: if it is vague whether Harry is bald, then, even though it is metaphysically settled whether Harry is bald, we cannot know whether Harry is bald. On my view, vagueness is neither a type of indeterminacy nor a type of ignorance. Rather, it is sui generis. Universalism, Vagueness and Supersubstantivalism, NIKK EFFINGHAM Sider has a favorable view of supersubstantivalism (the thesis that all material objects are identical to the regions of space time that they occupy). This paper argues that given supersubstantivalism, Sider's argument from vagueness for (mereological) universalism fails. It presents Sider's vagueness argument (§§ II-III), and explains why - given supersubstantivalism - some but not all regions must be concrete in order for the argument to work (§IV). Given this restriction on what regions can be concrete, it gives a reductio of Sider's argument (§ V). It concludes with some brief comments on why this is not simply an ad hominem against Sider, and why this incompatibility of supersubstantivalism with the argument from vagueness is of broader interest (§VI). Epistemic and Dialectical Regress, MICHAEL RESCORLA Dialectical egalitarianism holds that every asserted proposition requires defense when challenged by an interlocutor. This view apparently generates a vicious "regress of justifications," since an interlocutor can challenge the premises through which a speaker defends her original assertion, and so on ad infinitum. To halt the regress, dialectical foundationalists such as Adler, Brandom, Leite, and Williams propose that some propositions require no defense in the light of mere requests for</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 981 justification. This paper argues that the putative regress is not worrisome and that egalitarianism can handle it quite satisfactorily. It also defends a positive view that combines an antifoundationalist conception of dialectical interaction with a foundationalist conception of epistemic justification. Actions, Thought-Experiments and the 'Principle of Alternate Possibilities ' MARIA ALVAREZ In 1969 Harry Frankfurt published his hugely influential paper "Alternate Possibilities and Moral Responsibility" in which he claimed to present a counterexample to the so-called "Principle of Alternate Possibilities" ("a person is morally responsible for what he has done only if he could have done otherwise"). The success of Frankfurt-style cases as counterexamples to the Principle has been much debated since. This paper presents an objection to these cases that, in questioning their conceptual cogency, undercuts many of those debates. Such cases all require a counterfactual mechanism that could cause an agent to perform an action that he cannot avoid performing. This essay argues that, given our concept of what it is for someone to act, this requirement is inconsistent. It has recently been argued by John Fischer that a counterexample to the Principle could be a "Fischer-style case," that is, a case where the agent can either perform the action or do nothing else. This paper argues that, although Fischer-style cases do not share the conceptual flaw common to all Frankfurt-style cases, they also fail as counterexamples to the Principle. The paper finishes with a brief discussion of the significance of the Principle of Alternate Possibilities. Emergentism and Supervenience Physicalism, ROBERT J. HO WELL A purely metaphysical formulation of physicalism is surprisingly elusive. One popular slogan is, "There is nothing over and above the physical." Problems with this arise on two fronts. First, it is difficult to explain what makes a property "physical" without appealing to the methodology of physics or to particular ways in which properties are known. This obviously introduces epistemic features into the core of a metaphysical issue. Second, it is difficult to cash out "over-and-aboveness" in a way that is rigorous, metaphysically pure, and extensionally apt for the purposes of the debate. This paper considers the claim that supervenience theses cannot define physicalism because they allow classical emergentist dualism through the physicalist door (Horgan 1993, Kim 1998, Wilson 2005). It argues that when the relevant supervenience thesis is metaphysical, emergentism is excluded. Against recent arguments to the contrary, the paper maintains that this is the case even given necessitarianism about natural laws (Wilson 2005). Further, it argues that a necessitarian with emergentist sympathies will be forced either into a type of quasipanpsychism, where our basic physical properties contain the illicit seeds of mentality at their core, or into admitting that emergence laws are not necessary after all. Either way, the combination of necessitarianism and emergentism does not provide a counterexample to supervenience physicalism.</page><page sequence="12">982 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Senses for Senses, BRAD THOMPSON If two subjects have phenomenally identical experiences, there is an important sense in which the way the world appears to them is precisely the same. How, then, are we to understand this notion of "ways of appearing"? Most philosophers who have acknowledged the existence of phenomenal content have held that the way something appears is simply a matter of the properties something appears to have. On this view, the way something appears is simply the way something appears to be. This identification supports a Russellian theory of phenomenal content, according to which phenomenal content is exhausted by facts about what specific properties are represented by an experience. The present paper motivates and develops an alternative Fregean theory of phenomenal color content. According to Fregean theories, the phenomenal content that is shared by any two phenomenally identical experiences is a matter of how the world is represented, and need not involve sameness in what is represented. It is argued that ways of appearing are modes of presentations of external properties and objects, and a detailed theory is presented about the nature of the modes of presentation involved in color experience. The Return of Taylor's Putnam, ADAM KOVACH This essay argues that the version of Hilary Putnam's model-theoretic argument developed by Barry Taylor in Models, Truth and Realism poses no threat to the realist claim that an ideal theory may be false. Monism and Intrinsicality, KELLY TROGDON Central to the program of sparse ontology is a hierarchical view of reality; the basic entities form the sparse structure of being, while the derivative entities form the abundant superstructure. Priority pluralism and priority monism are both theses of sparse ontology. Roughly speaking, the priority pluralist claims that wholes and their properties ontologically depend on parts and their properties, while the priority monist claims that it goes the other way around. This paper focuses on Ted Sider's recent argument that priority monism is probably false because it is incompatible with our best account of intrinsicality. In response it proposes an account of intrinsicality that is compatible with both priority monism and priority pluralism. I argue that the account, in addition to having the virtue of being neutral between priority monism and priority pluralism, is independently plausible.</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 983 AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY, Vol. 87, No. 2, June 2009 John Stuart Mill, Determinism, and the Problem of Induction, ELIJAH MILLGRAM Auguste Comte's doctrine of the three phases through which sciences pass (the theological, the metaphysical, and the positive) allows us to explain what John Stuart Mill was attempting in his magnum opus, the System of Logic: namely, to move the science of logic to its terminal and "positive" stage. Both Mill's startling account of deduction and his unremarked solution to the Humean problem of induction eliminate the notions of necessity or force - in this case, the "logical must" - characteristic of a science's metaphysical stage. Mill's treatment had a further surprising payoff: his solution to the Problem of Necessity (what today we call the problem of determinism and freedom of the will). Truth and A Priori Possibility: E gari s Charge Against Quasi- Realism, SIMON BLACKBURN In this journal Andy Egan argued that, contrary to what this paper claims, quasirealism is committed to a damaging asymmetry between the way a subject regards himself and the way he regards others. In particular, a subject must believe it to be a priori that if something is one of his stable or fundamental beliefs, then it is true. Whereas he will not hold that this is α priori true of other people. This paper rebuts Egan's argument, and gives further consideration to the correct way to think about our own fallibility. The Cavemaris Conscience: Evolution and Moral Realism, SCOTT M. JAMES An increasingly popular moral argument has it that the story of human evolution shows that we can explain the human disposition to make moral judgments without relying on a realm of moral facts. Such facts can thus be dispensed with. This argument is a threat to moral realism only if there is no realist position that can explain, in the context of human evolution, the relationship between our particular moral sense and a realm of moral facts. This essay sketches a plausible evolutionary story that illuminates this relationship. First, the sorts of adaptive pressures facing early humans would have produced more than just potent prosocial emotions, as evolutionary antirealists like to claim; it would have produced judgments - often situated within emotions - to the effect that others could reasonably disapprove of some bit of conduct, for an early human who cared deeply about how others might respond to her action ei'joyed the benefits of more cooperative exchanges than those early humans who did not. Second, according to</page><page sequence="14">984 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS objectivist versions of moral constructivism, moral facts just are facts about how others, ideally situated, would respond to one's conduct. Thus, if any objectivist moral constructivism story is true, then we can intelligibly assert that a) our capacity for moral judgment is the product of adaptive pressures acting on early humans and b) some moral judgments are objectively true. Probabilism Today: Permissibility and Multi-Account Ethics, JOHN HILL In ethics, "probabilism" refers to a position defended by a number of Catholic theologians, mainly in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. They held that, when one is uncertain which of a range of actions is the right one to perform, it is permissible to perform any which has a good chance of being the right one - even if there is another which has a better chance. This paper considers the value of this position from the viewpoint of modern ethical philosophy. The unusual nature of probabilism as a theory focusing upon permissibility, rather than right-making properties, is explored and related to some modern attempts to set out "satisficing" and "hybrid" ethical theories. Such theories try to distinguish between what is best and what is permissible, and probabilism can be understood as an alternative way of supplementing a theoiy of right-making properties by adding to it a theory of permissibility. But a more radical version is also possible, where one abandons any attempt to identify right actions or right-making properties, and instead considers permissibility alone. Accordingly, a "multi-account theory" of permissibility is proposed and defended as a model of how many people actually make moral decisions. Structure-Making, KRIS MCDANIEL Friends of states of affairs and structural universais appeal to a relation, structure-making, that is allegedly a kind of composition relation: structure- making "builds" facts out of particulars and universais, and "builds" structural universais out of unstructured universais. D. M. Armstrong, an eminent champion of structures, endorses two interesting theses concerning composition. First, that structure-making is a composition relation. Second, that it is not the only (fundamental) composition relation: Armstrong also believes in a mode of composition that he calls mereological, and which he takes to be the only kind of composition recognized by his philosophical adversaries, such as David Lewis. Armstrong, accordingly, is a kind of pluralist about compositional relations: there is more than one way to make wholes from parts. This paper, critically evaluates Armstrong's compositional pluralism. Logical Pluralism Is Compatible With Monism About Metaphysical Modality, NICOLA CIPROTTI and LUCA MORETTI Beali and Restall (2000, 2001, 2006) advocate a comprehensive pluralist approach to logic, which they call Logical Pluralism, according to which there</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 985 is not one true logic but many equally acceptable logical systems. They maintain that Logical Pluralism is compatible with monism about metaphysical modality, according to which there is just one correct logic of metaphysical modality. Wyatt (2004) contends that Logical Pluralism is incompatible with monism about metaphysical modality. This paper first suggests that if Wyatt were right, Logical Pluralism would be strongly implausible because it would get upside down a dependence relation that holds between metaphysics and logic of modality. It then argues that Logical Pluralism is prima facie compatible with monism about metaphysical modality. Moral Ambition, GLEN A. PETTIGROVE and MICHAEL J. MEYER The paper opens with an account of moral ambition which, it argues, is both a coherent ideal and an admirable trait. It closes with a discussion of some of the ways in which this trait might differ from traditional virtues such as temperance, courage, or benevolence. Reconsidering the Value of Equality, IWAO HIROSE Some people believe that the equality of people's well-being makes an outcome better, other things being constant; call this Telic Egaiitarianism. The paper proposes a new interpretation of Telic Egaiitarianism, and compares it with the interpretation that is proposed by Derek Parfit (1995) and widely accepted by many philosophers. This paper's interpretation is more plausible than Parfit's because, for example, it shows that his Levelling Down Objection does not undermine Telic Egaiitarianism. In addition, it better explains the important similarity and difference between Telic Egaiitarianism and his proposed Priority View. Parity, Intransitivity, and a Context-Sensitive Degree Analysis of Gradability, YITZHAK BENBAJI Larry Temkin challenged what seems to be an analytic truth about comparatives: if A is Φ-er than Β and Β is Φ-er than C, then, A is Φ-er than C. Ruth Chang denies a related claim: if A is Φ-er than Β and C is not Φ-er than B, but is Φ to a certain degree, then A is Φ-er than C. This paper advances a context-sensitive semantics of gradability according to which the data uncovered by Temkin and Chang leave both statements intact.</page><page sequence="16">986 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 47, No. 2, April 2009 Recent Themes in the History of Early Analytic Philosophy, JULIET FLOYD This paper offers a survey of the emergence of early analytic philosophy as a subfield of the history of philosophy. The importance of recent literature on Frege, Russell, and Wittgenstein is stressed, as is the widening interest in understanding the nineteenth-century scientific and Kantian backgrounds. In contrast to recent histories of early analytic philosophy by P. M. S. Hacker and Scott Soames, the importance of historical and philosophical work on the significance of formalization is highlighted, as are the contributions made by those focusing on systematic treatments of individual philosophers, traditions, and periods in relation to contemporary issues (rule-following, neo-Fregeanism, contextualism, theory of meaning). "Their Intention Was Shown by Their Bodily Movements'1: The Basran Miïtazilites on the Institution of Language, SOPHIA VASALOU Following the initiative of Abu Hashim al-Jubba'i, the Basran Mu'tazilites rejected the view of language, dominant till then in the Islamic milieu, according to which humanity had received it by way of divine revelation, and defended the position that language had arisen by means of a human convention. On the Basran understanding of this convention, the connection between words and things was effected by means of a momentous act of intention to assign a name, which was revealed to another through a bodily gesture or act of pointing. In considering the signifying powers of this bodily manifestation of intention, this paper discusses two points of difficulty, one internal and one external (grounded in Wittgenstein's critical framework) which beset the Basran Mu'tazilite account. The Principle of Continuity and Leibniz's Theory of Consciousness, LARRY M. JORGENSEN Leibniz viewed the principle of continuity, the principle that all natural changes are produced by degrees, as a useful heuristic for evaluating the truth of a theory. Since the Cartesian laws of motion entailed discontinuities in the natural order, Leibniz could safely reject it as a false theory. The principle of continuity has similar implications for analyses of Leibniz's theory of consciousness. This paper briefly surveys the three main interpretations of Leibniz's theory of consciousness and argues that the standard account entails a discontinuity that Leibniz could not allow. It argues that the principle of continuity and the textual data favor an interpretation according</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 987 to which a conscious mental state just is a perception that is distinct to a sufficient degree. The Divorce of Reason and Experience: Kant's Paralogisms of Pure Reason in Context, COREY W. DYCK The paper considers Kant's criticism of rational psychology in the Paralogisms of Pure Reason in light of his German predecessors. It first presents Wolffs foundational account of metaphysical psychology with the result that Wolffs rational psychology is not comfortably characterized as a naively rationalist psychology. It then turns to the reception of Wolffs account among later German metaphysicians, and shows that the same claim of a dependence of rational upon empirical psychology is found in the publications and lectures of Kant's pre-Critical period. Considering the Paralogisms in this context reveals Kant's conception of rational psychology to be distinctly novel and has important consequences in shifting the argumentative focus of the chapter. A Brief History of Time-Consciousness: Historical Precursors to James and Husserl, HOLLY K. ANDERSON and RICK GRUSH William James's Principles of Psychology, in which he made famous the "specious present" doctrine of temporal experience, and Edmund Husserl's Zur Phänomenologie des inneren Zeitbewusstseins were giant strides in the philosophical investigation of the temporality of experience. However, an important set of precursors to these works has not been adequately investigated. Beginning with Reid's essay "Memory" in Essays on the Intellectual Powers of Man, this paper traces out a line of development of ideas about the temporality of experience that runs through Dugald Stewart, Thomas Brown, William Hamilton, and finally the work of Shadworth Hodgson and Robert Kelly, both of whom were immediate influences on James (though James pseudonymously cites the latter as "E.R. Clay"). The paper argues that Hodgson, especially his Metaphysic of Eocperience (1898), was a significant influence on Husserl. JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. 47, No. 3, July 2009 The Function of Sensations in Reid, TODD BURAS According to Reid, "the external senses have a double province; to make us feel and to make us perceive." This essay is about the relation of the feeling and the perceiving. By drawing out the interrelations among a cluster of</page><page sequence="18">988 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Reidian distinctions, the paper offers a systematic interpretation of Reid's sign theory of sensations that reveals its overall rationale, structure, and coherence. Three Kinds of Rationalism and the Non-Spatiality of Things in Themselves, DESMOND HOGAN In the Transcendental Aesthetic, Kant argues that space and time are neither things in themselves nor properties thereof, but merely subjective forms of sensible experience. An influential "neglected alternative" objection holds that Kant's premises fail to exclude the possibility that spatiotemporality applies both to appearances and to things in themselves. Investigation of Kant's engagement with competing accounts of a priori knowledge uncovers an unsuspected ambiguity in a premise of the Aesthetic. The result is a new response to the neglected alternative charge, and the identification of a key presupposition of Kant's metaphysics of freedom in his argument for Transcendental Idealism. Kant, Non-Conceptual Content and the Representation of Space, LUCY ALLAIS This article argues against a dominant reading of Kant according to which he thinks that we cannot be perceptually presented with particulars independently of applying concepts, in particular the categories, to these particulars. It argues that, for Kant, the role of intuition is to present us with particulars and that it does not depend on concepts to play this role. The paper presents textual evidence against John McDowell's very strong and influential claim that intuition does not make an even notionally separable contribution to cognition, and it responds to the considerations from the Transcendental Deduction that lead commentators to the strong conceptualist reading. On Hume on Space: Green's Attack, James9 Empirical Response, ALEXANDER KLEIN Associationist psychologists of the late nineteenth century premised their research on a fundamentally Humean picture of the mind. So the very idea of mental science was called into question when T. H. Green, a founder of British idealism, wrote an influential attack on Hume's Treatise. This essay first analyzes Green's interpretation and criticism of Hume, situating his reading with respect to more recent Hume scholarship. It focuses on Green's argument that Hume cannot consistently admit real ideas of spatial relations, and then argues that William James's early work on spatial perception attempted to vindicate the new science of mind by showing how to avoid the problems Green had exposed in Hume's empiricism. James's solution involved rejecting a basic Humean assumption-that perceptual experience is fundamentally composed of so-called minima sensibilia, or psychological atoms. The claim that there are no psychological atoms is interesting because</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 989 James supported it with experimental data rather than (as commentators typically suppose) with introspective description or a priori argument. James claimed to be the real descendent of British empiricism on grounds that his antiatomistic model of perception fortified what Green had perhaps most wanted to demolish - the prospect of using strictly empirical, scientific methods in the study of mind. Shame as a Tool for Persuasion in Plato's Gorgias, D. B. FUTTER In Gorgias, Socrates' interlocutors charge him with argumentative "foul play" involving manipulation by shame. In an important recent paper, Jessica Moss presents an apologia for Socrates on these charges, arguing that although (1) Socrates adopts a strategy of shaming rather than reasoning his interlocutors into agreement, this is legitimate because (2) his appeals to shame function as appeals to a moral sense, which connect a person to his own "deep" convictions. Moreover, she claims that (3) shame "can be a more effective tool of persuasion than reason" for it is capable, where reason is not, of dislodging a person's "intuitive" moral beliefs. The current paper argues that each of these claims is mistaken. INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. 49, No. 1 , March 2009 The Geography ofFinitude: Myth and Earth in Plato's Phaedo, SARA BRILL Plato's use of afterlife myths is often viewed as an abandonment of rational discourse for a coercive practice designed to persuade citizens to be concerned about the condition of their souls by appealing to their worst fears about the afterlife. But such interpretations overlook the frequently critical tenor of Plato's myths. This paper develops the claim that Plato appeals to mythos as a means of critiquing various specific logoi by focusing upon the relationship between the myth of the earth in the Phaedo and the four logoi about immortality that precede it. The paper argues that these logoi fail to be persuasive because they rely upon a construal of the relationship between body and soul that denies them meaningful reference to the lives and deaths of embodied beings. The myth of the earth provides a critical engagement with the perspective from which Socrates and his interlocutors have produced these logoi.</page><page sequence="20">990 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Is KanVs Theoretical Doctrine of the Self Consistent with His Thesis ofNoumenal Ignorance? THEODORE DI MARIA, JR. The relation between the concepts of the subject of apperception, the phenomenal self, and the noumenal self has long puzzled commentators on Kant's theoretical account of the self. This paper argues that many of the puzzles surrounding Kant's account can be resolved by treating the subject of apperception and other transcendental predicates of thinking as a dimension of the noumenal self. Yet this interpretation requires a clarification of how the transcendental predicates of thinking can be attributed to the noumenal self without violating the thesis of noumenal ignorance. The clarification is achieved through a careful analysis of the meaning of the latter thesis. The paper's interpretation is then shown to be consistent with Kant's rejection of traditional ontology and with the dual-aspect view. The paper's final section argues that transcendental predicates are properly construed as logical predicates, but must be distinguished from ordinary examples of the latter. Emotional Subjects: Mood and Articulation in HegeVs Philosophy of Mind, JOHN RUSSON In his discussions of "sensibility" and "feeling," Hegel has a compelling interpretation of the emotional foundations of experience. This paper situates "mood" within the context of "sensibility," and then focuses on the inherently "outwardizing" or self-externalizing character of mood. It then considers the different modes of moody self-externalization, for the sake of determining why we express ourselves in language. It concludes by demonstrating why the notions of emotion and spirit are necessarily linked. Nameless Virtues and Restrained Speech in the Analects, ERIN M. CLINE Examples of "nameless" virtues are discussed by Aristotle in the Nicomachean Ethics. They are also found in the Confucian Analects. This paper explores what makes a virtue nameless in the Nicomachean Ethics and the Analects, and then argues that restrained speech is best understood as a nameless virtue in the Analects. It further argues that the virtue of restrained speech merits careful study because it contributes to our understanding of nameless virtues generally, while also deepening our understanding of Kongzi's ethics by showing why he thought it was important to cultivate certain virtues. Indeed, many of the things that make restrained speech valuable hold in a contemporary setting as well, making restrained speech a virtue that is important for us today. The Jesuit Magis and the Ethics ofCeteris Paribus, RONALD H. MCKINNER, S.J. This article explores the relevance of the thought of Ignatius of Loyola regarding moral discernment of the magis for adjudicating the debate</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 991 between traditionalists and proportionalists in contemporary Catholic ethical theory. The Ignatian criteria for discerning the magis have ceteris paribus qualifiers attached. The relevance of this type of qualifier for ethical theory in general is assessed by examining contemporary analytic philosophy's quest to interpret what W. D. Ross means by prima facie obligations. The similarity between his thought and that of Ignatius is explored, as well as the resulting paradoxical implications for resolving the debate between traditionalists and proportionalists. Who Is the Author of the Summa Lamberti? THOMAS S. MALONEY Two persons have been proposed as the author of the Summa Lamberti, a thirteenth-century treatise on logic. Franco Alessio takes him to be the Auxerre Dominican Lambert of Ligny-le-Châtel, and he bases his claim on Dominican sources from the fourteenth to the nineteenth centuries. Recently, Alain de Libera has presented a counter-proposal: the author was Lambert of Lagny, a secular cleric at the time of the composition, who afterwards became a Dominican. This claim is based on the acta of the counts of Champagne and a document of Pope Urban IV. This essay concludes that, given the present evidence, de Liberals case rests on more historically sound data, but that to arrive at this conclusion one must impeach the Dominican sources (not done by de Libera) and take into consideration additional data from the research of Michèle Mulchahey on the introduction of logic into the Dominican curriculum. MIND Vol. 118, No. 469, January 2009 No Good Fit: Why the Fitting Attitude Analysis of Value Fails, KRISTER BYKVIST According to the fitting attitude analysis of value (FA-analysis), what is good is what it is fitting to favor in some sense. Much of the discussion of this analysis has been concerned with the wrong-reason objection: it can be fitting to have an attitude towards something for reasons that have nothing to do with the value the thing has in itself. Much less attention has been paid to the problem of identifying the relevant attitudes in virtue of which value is supposed to be defined. An old complaint, however, is that the FA-analysis is bound to be circular because the fitting attitude is best seen as an evaluative judgment or an evaluative experience. This paper argues that the challenge to find a noncircular account is deepened by the fact that on many popular nonevaluative understandings of favoring, there are good states of affairs that it is never fitting to favor because it is logically impossible or irrational to</page><page sequence="22">992 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS favor them. The paper also shows that the remaining candidate of favoring, "imaginative emotional feeling/' will generate a new version of the wrong- reason objection, if it is put to use in the FA-account. The essay concludes that the prospects of finding a noncircular FA-analysis look bleak. - Correspondence to: krister.bykvist@jesus.ox.ac.uk Against Content Normativity, KATHRIN GLÜER and ASA WIKFORSS As meaning's claim to normativity has grown increasingly suspect the normativity thesis has shifted to mental content. This paper distinguishes two versions of content normativism: "CE normativism," according to which it is essential to content that certain "oughts" can be derived from it, and "CD normativism," according to which content is determined by norms in the first place. The paper argues that neither type of normativism withstands scrutiny. CE normativism appeals to the fact that there is an essential connection between content and correctness conditions. However, this fact is by itself normatively innocent, and attempts to add a normative dimension via the normativity of belief ultimately fail. CD normativism, in turn, falls prey to the "dilemma of regress and idleness": the appeal to rules either leads to some form of regress of rules, or the notion of rule-following is reduced to an idle label. The essay concludes by suggesting that its arguments do not support naturalism: it is a mistake to assume that normativism and naturalism are the only options. Necessities and Necessary Truths: A Prolegomenon to the Use of Modal Logic in the Analysis of Intensional Notions, VOLKER HALBACK and PHILIP WELCH In philosophical logic, necessity is usually conceived as a sentential operator rather than as a predicate. An intensional sentential operator does not allow one to express quantified statements such as "There are necessary a posteriori propositions" or "All laws of physics are necessary" in first-order logic in a straightforward way, while they are readily formalized if necessity is formalized by a predicate. Replacing the operator conception of necessity by the predicate conception, however, causes various problems and forces one to reject many philosophical accounts involving necessity that are based on the use of operator modal logic. This article argues that the expressive power of the predicate account can be restored if a truth predicate is added to the language of first-order modal logic because the predicate "is necessary" can then be replaced by "is necessarily true." The paper proves a result showing that this substitution is technically feasible. To this end it provides partial possible-worlds semantics for the language with a predicate of necessity and performs the reduction of necessities to necessary truths. The technique applies also to many other intensional notions that have been analyzed by means of modal operators. - Correspondence to: volker.halbach@philosophy .ox.ac.uk and p.welch@bristol.ac.uk</page><page sequence="23">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 993 Identity and Indiscernibility, KATHERIN HAWLEY Putative counterexamples to the Principle of Identity of Indiscernibles (PII) are notoriously inconclusive.

EINAR DUENGER BOHN This article first explores the notion of the world's being such that everything in it is a proper part. It then explores the notion of the world's being such that everything in it both is and has a proper part. Given two well recognized assumptions, it argues that both notions represent genuine metaphysical possibilities. Finally it considers, but dismisses, some possible objections. Expressivism and Moral Certitude, KRISTER BYKVIST and JONAS OLSON Michael Smith has recently argued that noncognitivists are unable to accommodate crucial structural features of moral belief, and in particular that noncognitivists have trouble accounting for subjects' certitude with respect to their moral beliefs. James Lenman and Michael Ridge have independently constructed "ecumenical" versions of noncognitivism, intended to block this objection. This paper argues that these responses do not work. If ecumenical noncognitivism, a hybrid view which incorporates both noncognitivist and cognitivist elements, fails to meet Smith's challenge, it is unlikely that "purer" and more familiar versions of noncognitivism will succeed. When Is Parsimony a Virtue? MICHAEL HUEMER Parsimony is a virtue of empirical theories. Is it also a virtue of philosophical theories? This article reviews four contemporary accounts of the virtue of parsimony in empirical theorizing, and considers how each might apply to two prominent appeals to parsimony in the philosophical literature, those made on behalf of physicalism and on behalf of nominalism. None of the accounts of the virtue of parsimony extends naturally to either of these</page><page sequence="24">994 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS philosophical cases. This suggests that in typical philosophical contexts, ontological simplicity has no evidential value. Luck and History-Sensitive Compatibilism, NEIL LEW Libertarianism seems vulnerable to a serious problem concerning present luck because it requires indeterminism somewhere in the causal chain leading to directly free action. Compatibilism, in contrast, is thought to be free of this problem, as not requiring indeterminism in the causal chain. This paper argues that this view is false: compatibilism is subject to a problem of present luck. This is less of a problem for compatibilism than for libertarianism. However, its effects are just as devastating for one kind of compatibilism, the kind of compatibilism which is history-sensitive, and therefore must take the problem of constitutive luck seriously. The problem of present luck confronting compatibilism is sufficient to undermine the history-sensitive compatibilist's response to remote - constitutive - luck. A Science of Intention, MICHAEL MCDERMOTT Quine's key argument against intentional psychology is that belief ascriptions have no determinate empirical content unless we take facts about linguistic meaning for granted, but meaning claims have no determinate empirical content unless we take belief for granted. This paper tries to show that, on the contrary, an intentional psychology can explain behavior without relying on any concept of meaning. On Essentially Conflicting Desires, PATRICIA MARINO It is sometimes argued that having inconsistent desires is irrational or otherwise bad for an agent. If so, if agents seem to want a and not-a, then either their attitudes are being misdescribed - what they really want is some aspect χ of a and some aspect y of not-a - or those desires are somehow "inconsistent" and thus inappropriate. This paper argues first that the proper characterization of inconsistency here does not involve logical form, that is, whether the desires involved have the form a and not-a, but rather the possibility of fulfilling all one's desires; and secondly, that the "essential" conflicts involved in such inconsistencies are quite common, and no worse for an agent than contingent conflicts. The paper draws implications concerning moral epistemology, moral realism, and the logic of attitudes. Fixing Perceptual Belief, GERALD VISION In specifying the sensory evidence for perceptual belief, thinkers have either chosen a common perceptual idiom or have invented one of their own as a starting-point for their enquiries. It is becoming clearer that the choice harbors crucial, often disputable, assumptions. This essay compares two sorts of constructions, a variety of propositional ones, and an objectual one,</page><page sequence="25">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 995 and argues that the objectual idiom is indispensable in order to explain how a perceptual belief can arise out of what is not already a belief. This has implications not only for the question of how belief is generated from perceptual evidence, but also for various other controversies. The paper discusses two of these implications: the character of inferences from evidence, and basic belief. THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. 118, No. 2, April 2009 Production and Necessity, LOUIS DE ROSSET A major source of latter-day skepticism about necessity is the work of David Hume. Hume is widely taken to have endorsed the Humean claim: there are no necessary connections between distinct existences. The Humean claim is defended on the grounds that necessary connections between wholly distinct things would be mysterious and inexplicable. Philosophers deploy this claim in the service of a wide variety of philosophical projects, but Saul Kripke has argued that it is false. According to Kripke, there are necessary connections between distinct existences; in particular, there are necessary connections between material objects and their material origins. This essay argues that the primary motivation for the Humean claim, Hume's datum, also motivates the key premise in an argument for the necessity of origins. The very considerations that the Humean takes to show that necessary connections between wholly distinct things would be mysterious and inexplicable indicate that there must be some such necessary connections. Thus, in the absence of alternative support, there is no reason to believe the Humean claim. Canny Resemblance, CATHARINE ABELL Depiction is the form of representation distinctive of figurative paintings, drawings, and photographs. Accounts of depiction attempt to specify the relation something must bear to an object in order to depict it. Resemblance accounts hold that the notion of resemblance is necessary to the specification of this relation. Several difficulties with such analyses have led many philosophers to reject the possibility of an adequate resemblance account of depiction. This essay outlines these difficulties and argues that current resemblance accounts succumb to them. It then develops an alternative resemblance account, drawing on Grice's account of nonnatural meaning and its role in determining sentence meaning to argue that something depicts an object if it bears intention-based resemblances to the object that jointly capture its overall appearance. In addition to solving the metaphysical</page><page sequence="26">996 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS problem of what it is for something to depict an object, this account also sheds significant light on the epistemológica! issue of how we are able to work out that something depicts an object. This essay argues that our ability to work out that something depicts an object results from both our more general ability to identify intentions from the products of communicative behavior and our knowledge of stylistic conventions. This account avoids the difficulties that face rival attempts to analyze depiction in terms of resemblance. It also clarifies and explains the features that distinguish depictive from nondepictive representation. Epistemic Relativism, MARK ELI KALDERON In Fear of Knowledge, Paul Boghossian argues against the very coherence of epistemic relativism. This essay does two things. First, without questioning the truth of his conclusion, it argues that Boghossian's argument for that conclusion fails. Second, it argues that the avowed aim of Fear of Knowledge, to dislodge relativistic conviction, could not be served even if Boghossian's argument worked perfectly on its own terms. The eponymous fear, and not rational argument, is the source of much of the relativistic conviction to be found at large in the culture. And Fear of Knowledge simply does not address this fear. PHILOSOPHY Vol. 84, No. 1 , January 2009 Concepts: Where Subjectivism Goes Wrong, HANS-JOHANN The debate about concepts has always been shaped by a contrast between subjectivism, which treats them as phenomena in the mind or head of individuals, and objectivism, which insists that they exist independently of individual minds. The most prominent contemporary version of subjectivism is Fodor's RTM. The Fregean charge against subjectivism is that it cannot do justice to the fact that different individuals can share the same concepts. Proponents of RTM have accepted shareability as a "nonnegotiable constraint." At the same time they insist that by distinguishing between sign- types and tokens the Fregean objection cannot just be circumvented but revealed to be fallacious. This paper rehabilitates the Fregean argument against subjectivism. The RTM response rests either on an equivocation of "concept" - between types which satisfy the nonnegotiable constraint and tokens that are mental particulars in line with RTM doctrine - or on the untenable idea that one and the same entity can be both a shareable type and hence abstract and a concrete particular in the head. Furthermore, subjectivism cannot be rescued by adopting unorthodox metaphysical</page><page sequence="27">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 997 theories about the type/token and universal/particular contrasts. The final section argues that concepts are not representations or signs, but something represented by signs. Even if RTM is right to explain conceptual thinking by reference to the occurrence of mental representations, concepts themselves cannot be identical with such representations. Virtue, Mixed Emotions and Moral Ambivalence, DAVID CARR Aristotelian virtue ethics invests emotions and feelings with much moral significance. However, the moral and other conflicts that inevitably beset human life often give rise to states of emotional division and ambivalence with problematic implications for any understanding of virtue as complete psychic unity of character and conduct. For one thing, any admission that the virtuous are prey to conflicting passions and desires may seem to threaten the crucial virtue ethical distinction between the virtuous and the continent. One recent attempt to sustain this distinction - considered in this paper - maintains that the contrary-to-virtue emotions and desires of the virtuous (by contrast with those of the continent) must relinquish their motive power as reasons for action. Following some attention to the psychological status of feelings and emotions - in particular their complex relations with cognition and reason - this paper rejects this solution in favor of a more constructive view of emotional conflict. Responsible Belief and Our Social Institutions, RENÉ VAN WOUDENBERG The idea that we can properly be held responsible for what we believe underlies large stretches of our social and institutional life; without that idea in place, social and institutional life would be unthinkable, and more importantly, it would stumble and fall. At the same time, philosophers have argued that this idea is strange or defective. This paper develops the alleged problem and seeks to measure the damage in case the idea turns out to be defective. This is done by substantiating the claim that this idea underlies stretches of our social and institutional life, which is accomplished by presenting the results of a web search on the use of what can be called "deontological epistemic expressions," that is, expressions in which deontological and epistemological notions (both broadly construed) are combined. The ubiquitous use of these expressions is evidence that the contested idea indeed pervades our social life. The third section moves beyond the linguistic evidence and discusses two social institutions, namely education and law, and argues that they cannot be made sense of unless the contested idea is in place. No Abiding City: Hume, Naturalism, and Toleration, SAMUEL CLARK This paper rereads David Hume's Dialogues Concerning Natural Religion as dramatizing a distinctive, naturalistic account of toleration. This</page><page sequence="28">998 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS has two purposes: first, to complete and ground Hume's fragmentary explicit discussion of toleration; second, to unearth a potentially attractive alternative to more recent, Rawlsian approaches to toleration. The paper connects Dialogues and the problem of toleration to the wider themes of naturalism, skepticism, and their relation in Hume's thought before developing a new interpretation of Dialogues part 12 as political drama. Finally, the essay develops the Humean theory of toleration by comparing Rawls's and Hume's strategies for justification of a tolerant political regime. Making Sense of What We Are: A Mythological Approach to Human Nature, MICHAEL HAUSKELLER The question: What makes us human? is often treated as a question of fact. However, the term "human" is not primarily used to refer to a particular kind of entity, but as a nomen dignitatis - a dignity-conferring name. It implies a particular moral status. That is what spawns endless debates about such issues as when human life begins and ends and whether human-animal chimeras are "partly human." Definitions of the human are inevitably "persuasive," telling of what is important and how to live, and thus help us to make sense of what we are. Absurdity, Incongruity and Laughter, BOB PLANT In The Myth of Sisyphus, Camus recommends scornful defiance in the face of our absurd, meaningless existence. Although Nagel agrees that human life possesses an absurd dimension, he objects to Camus's existentialist "dramatics." For Nagel, absurdity arises from the irreducible tension between our subjective and objective perspectives on life. This paper does two things: (i) it critically reconstruct Camus's and Nagel's positions, and (ii) it develops Nagel's critique of Camus in order to argue that humor is an appropriate response to absurdity. Stephen Clark, the Laws of Logic and the Sorites, LAURENCE GOLDSTEIN A standard method for refuting a set of claims is to show that it implies a contradiction. Stephen Clark questions this method on the grounds that the Law of Non-Contradiction, together with the other fundamental laws of logic does not accord with everyday reality. He accounts for vagueness by suggesting that, for any vague predicate "F," an ordinary object is typically to some extent both F and not-F, and that objects do not change abruptly from being F to being not-F. This article challenges Clark's "deconstruction" of logic, and shows that, in characterizing vagueness and dealing with the associated Sorites paradox, we can accommodate his observation that change from being F to being not-F is ineradically continuous without tampering with any fundamental logical laws.</page><page sequence="29">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 999 PHILOSOPHY Vol. 84, No. 2, April 2009 What is the Order Among the Varieties of Goodness? A Question Posed by von Wright; and a Conjecture Made by Aristotle, DAVID WIGGINS The great variousness and plurality of goodness has given comfort to general skepticism about values and a multitude of metaethical attitudes or predilections. But is this variousness and plurality really the hotch-potch it has appeared? The paper recapitulates and expands von Wright's typology of the varieties of goodness and looks to explain the order or system that underlies the phenomena by developing and extending a coi'jecture of Aristotle's, the so-called "focal hypothesis," and combining therewith a suggestion of von Wright's to the effect that the central case of something good is the faring well of a being. By means of focal hypothesis, one may account fairly well for medical, technical, instrumental, beneficial, and utilitarian goodness. Other varieties such as hedonic and ethical goodness complicate the picture, as also do all cases where it seems that an antecedent kind of goodness impinges upon a being. These complications mirror in part the finding that the human scale of values is not a scale exclusively of human values. Time and Truth: The Presentism-Eternalism Debate, TOM STONEHAM There are many questions we can ask about time, but perhaps the most fundamental is whether there are metaphysically interesting differences between past, present, and future events. An eternalist believes in a block universe: past, present, and future events are all on an equal footing. A gradualist believes in a growing block: he agrees with the eternalist about the past and the present but not about the future. A presentisi believes that what is present has a special status. This essay's first claim is that the familiar ways of articulating these views result in there being no substantive disagreement at all between the three parties. It then shows that if we accept the controversial truth-making principle, we can articulate a substantive disagreement. Finally, the paper applies this way of formulating the debate to related questions such as the open future and determinism, showing that these do not always line up in quite the way one would expect. Could Time be Change? DENIS CORISH Sydney Shoemaker argues that time without change is possible, but begs the question by assuming an, in effect, Newtonian absolute time, that "flows equably" in a region in which there is no change and in one in which there is.</page><page sequence="30">1 000 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS An equally possible, relativist assumption, consistent it seems with relativity theory, is that where nothing changes there is no time flow, though there may be elsewhere, where there is change. Such an assumption would require some revision of uncritical common thought about time. Aristotle argues that there is no time without change, but that time is not change. His arguments for the latter can be faulted both internally and again in terms of the same relativist assumption. From the Physics we can derive, though Aristotle himself did not, an argument that time is to change as geometrical space is to body: the thing itself in abstraction. Sex, JONATHAN WEBBER The sexual domain is unified only by the phenomenal quality of the occurrence of the desires, activities, and pleasures it includes. There is no conceptual restriction on the range of intentional objects those desires, activities, and pleasures can take. Neither is there good conceptual reason to privilege any class of them as paradigmatic. Since the quality unifying the sexual is not morally significant, the morality of sexuality is no different from morality in general. The view that participant consent is morally sufficient in the sexual domain therefore requires the more controversial view that it is morally sufficient in general. Reconsidering the Ad Hominem, CHRISTOPHER M. JOHNSON Ad hominem arguments are generally dismissed on the grounds that they are not attempts to engage in rational discourse, but are rather aimed at undermining argument by diverting attention from claims made to assessments of character of persons making claims. The manner of this dismissal however is based upon an unlikely paradigm of rationality: it is based upon the presumption that our intellectual capacities are not as limited as in fact they are, and do not vary as much as they do between rational people. When we understand rationality in terms of intellectual virtues, however, which recognize these limitations and provide for the complexity of our thinking, ad hominem considerations can sometimes be relevant to assessing arguments. God, Wittgenstein and John Cook, DON S. LEVI This essay is a meditation on Wittgenstein's ir'junction to "look and see," especially when it is applied to the debate over theological realism. John Cook thinks that the injunction should be followed in metaphysics and epistemology, something he believes that Wittgenstein himself did not do. This paper posits that Cook is right about this, even though it remains unpersuaded by him that Wittgenstein goes wrong because he was committed to Neutral Monism. Interestingly, Cook thinks that there is no need to adopt the look-and-see approach when it comes to the philosophy of religion, and this paper tries to show why he is wrong to think so.</page><page sequence="31">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 1 001 PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. 78, No. 2, March 2009 The Conventional and the Analytic, MANUEL GARCÍA-CARPINTERO and MANUEL PÉREZ OTERO Putting Thoughts to Work: Concepts, Systematicity, and Stimulus- Independence, ELISABETH CAMP This essay argues that we can reconcile two seemingly incompatible traditions for thinking about concepts. On the one hand, many cognitive scientists assume that the systematic redeployment of representational abilities suffices for having concepts. On the other hand, a long philosophical tradition maintains that language is necessary for genuinely conceptual thought. The paper argues that on a theoretically useful and empirically plausible concept of "concept/' it is necessary and sufficient for conceptual thought that a thinker be able to entertain many of the potential thoughts produced by recombining her representational abilities apart from a direct confrontation with the states of affairs being represented. Such representational abilities support a cognitive engagement with the world that is flexible, abstract, and active. Must the Fundamental Laws of Physics be Complete? MARC LANGE Reddish Green: A Challenge for Modal Claims About Phenomenal Structure, MARTINE NIDA-RÜMELIN and JUAN SUAREZ This paper discusses two modal claims about the phenomenal structure of color experiences: (i) violet experiences are necessarily experiences of a color that is for the subject on that occasion phenomenally composed of red and blue (the modal claim about violet) and (ii) no subject can possibly have an experience of a color that is for it then phenomenally composed of red and green (the modal claim about reddish green). The modal claim about reddish green is undermined by empirical results. The essay discusses whether these empirical results cast doubt on the other modal claims as well, and argues that this not the case. The argument is based on the thesis that the best argument for the modal claim about violet is quite different from the best argument for the modal claim about reddish green. To argue for this disanalogy a reconstruction of the best available justification for both claims is proposed.</page><page sequence="32">1 002 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS When Best Theories Go Bad, DAVID MANLEY It is common for contemporary metaphysical realists to adopt Quine's criterion of ontologica! commitment while at the same time repudiating his ontological pragmatism. Drawing heavily from the work of others - especially Joseph Melia and Stephen Yablo - this paper argues that the resulting approach to metaontology is unstable. In particular, if we are metaphysical realists, we need not accept ontological commitment to whatever is quantified over by our best first-order theories. Will and Representation in the Resolution of Metaphysical Doubt, IVAN FOX PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. 78, No. 3, May 2009 Leibniz on Natural Teleology and the Laws of Optics, JEFFREY K. MCDONOUGH This essay examines one of the cornerstones of Leibniz's defense of teleology within the order of nature. The first section explores Leibniz's contributions to the study of geometrical optics, and argues that his "Most Determined Path Principle," or "MDPP," allows him to bring to the fore philosophical issues concerning the legitimacy of teleological explanations by addressing two technical objections raised by Cartesians to nonmechanistic derivations of the laws of optics. The second section argues that, by drawing on laws such as the MDPP, Leibniz is able to introduce a thin notion of teleology that gives him the resources to respond to the most pressing charges of his day against teleological explanations within natural philosophy. Finally, the third section argues that contemporary philosophers have been overly hasty in their dismissal of Leibniz's account of natural teleology, and indeed that their own generally thin conceptions of teleology have left them with few well-motivated resources for resisting his elegant position. Evidentialism, Vice, and Virtue, JASON BAEHR The Conditional Analysis of Dispositions and the Intrinsic Dispositions Thesis, SUNGHO CHOI The idea that dispositions are an intrinsic matter has been popular among contemporary philosophers of dispositions. This paper first states this idea as exactly as possible, and then examines whether it poses any threat to</page><page sequence="33">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 1 003 the two current versions of the conditional analysis of dispositions, namely, the simple and reformed conditional analysis of dispositions. The upshot is that the intrinsic nature of dispositions, when properly understood, does not spell trouble for either of the two versions. Along the way, an extensionally correct and practically useful criterion for identifying nomically intrinsic dispositions is proposed and one objection raised by Lewis against the simple conditional analysis of dispositions is criticized. Knowledge and Conversation, ALLAN HAZLETT Incompatibilism's Threat to Worldly Value: Source Incompatibilism, Desert, and Pleasure, ISHTIYAQUE HAJI Can Intrinsic' Be Defined Using Only Broadly Logical Notions? DAN MARSHALL An intrinsic property is roughly a property things have in virtue of how they are, as opposed to how they are related to things outside of them. This paper argues that it is not possible to give a definition of "intrinsic" that involves only logical, modal, and mereological notions, and does not depend on any special assumptions about either properties or possible worlds. PHRONESIS Vol. 54, No. 2, 2009 Mistakes of Reason: Practical Reasoning and the Fallacy of Accident, ALLAN BACK For Aristotle the fallacy of accident arises from mistakes about being per accidens and not from accidental predication. Mistakes in perceiving per accidens come from our judgements about being per accidens and so commit that fallacy. Practical syllogisms have the same formal structure as being and perceiving per accidens. Moreover perceiving per accidens typically provides the minor premise for the practical syllogism as it makes it possible for us to know singular propositions, especially those about substances. Thus, these minor premises may come about through fallacious reasoning, what today would be called reasoning via collateral information. On account of these foundations for the practical syllogism, even a person of practical wisdom will need a lot of luck to avoid mistakes.</page><page sequence="34">1 004 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Sons of the Earth: Are the Stoics Metaphysical Brutes? KATJA MARIA VOGT This paper argues that the Stoics develop an account of corporeals that allows their theory of bodies to be, at the same time, a theory of causation, agency, and reason. The paper aims to shed new light on the Stoics' engagement with Plato's Sophist It argues that the Stoics are Sons of the Earth insofar as, for them, the study of corporeals - rather than the study of being - is the most fundamental study of reality. However, they are sophisticated Sons of the Earth for developing a complex notion of corporeals. A crucial component of this account is that ordinary bodies are individuated by the way in which the corporeal god pervades them. The corporeal god is the one cause of all movements and actions in the universe. Le Contre les géomètres de Sextus Empiricus: sources, cible, structure, GUILLAUME DYE and BERNARD VITRAC This paper examines Sextus Empiricus' treatise Against the geometers. It first sets this treatise in the overall context of the sceptic's polemics against the liberal arts. After a discussion of Sextus' attitude to the quadrivium, it discusses the structure, the sources, and the target of the Against the geometers. It appears that Euclid is not Sextus' source, and neither he, nor the professional geometers, seem to be Sextus' main targets. Of course, Sextus never really makes clear his precise target, but his attacks are rather directed against geometry as a means of modelling the physical world, thus ruining the support geometry was intended to bring to the physical part of dogmatic philosophy. RATIO Vol. 22, No. 1 , January 2009 Naturalism Without Tears, JAMES LENMAN Parfit argues that naturalistic theories that seek to understand normative concepts either as simply descriptive of certain natural facts about our desires or as expressive of our desires commit us to a bleak normative nihilism whereby nothing matters. This paper defends such naturalism, in particular its expressivist variety, against this charge. It is true that such views commit us to there being no reasons os Parfit understands them. But for Parfit to suppose that equivalent to there being no reasons leaves him begging the question where the relative credibility of these rival understandings is just what is at issue.</page><page sequence="35">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 1 005 Can There Be a Kantian Consequentialism, SEIRIOL MORGAN In On What Matters, Derek Parfit argues that we need to make a significant reassessment of the relationship between some central positions in moral philosophy because, contrary to received opinion, Kantians, contractualists, and consequentialists are all "climbing the same mountain on different sides." In Parfit's view Kant's own attempt to outline an account of moral obligation fails, but when it is modified in ways entirely congenial to his thinking, a defensible Kantian contractualism can be produced, which survives the objections that are fatal for Kant's own theory. This form of contractualism would lead rational agents to choose consequentialist moral principles. This paper argues that Parfit significantly misrepresents Kant's project in moral philosophy, and that no genuinely Kantian moral theory could issue in a form of consequentialism. The Kantian Argument for Consequentialism, MICHAEL OTSUKA This paper constitutes a critical examination of Parfit's attempt to reconcile Kantian contractualism with consequentialism, which disputes his contention that the contracting parties would lack decisive reasons to choose principles that ground prohibitions against harming of the sort to which nonconsequentialists have been attracted. Climb Every Mountain? MICHAEL RIDGE The central thesis of Derek Parfit's On What Matters is that three of the most important secular moral traditions - Kantianism, contractualism, and consequentialism - all actually converge in a way onto the same view. It is in this sense that he suggests that we may all be "climbing the same mountain, but from different sides." This paper seeks to demonstrate that Parfit's argument that we are all metaphorically climbing the same mountain is unsound. One reason his argument does not work is that he has misunderstood the way in which a plausible rule-consequentialism should understand the supervenience of lightness on all possible acceptance levels of the ideal moral code. In place of Parfit's own understanding of this, a view called "variable-rate rule-utilitarianism" is developed, The paper argues that this view shares the key insight of Parfit's view but avoids a fatal objection to his own articulation of that insight. Finally, the essay explores the way in which this modification might allow us to still make a case that we are all "climbing the same mountain," albeit in a very different way and for very different reasons than the ones Parfit had in mind. Might Kantian Contractualism Be the Supreme Principle of Morality? GIDEON ROSEN According to Parfit, the best version of Kantian ethics takes as its central principle Kantian Contractualism: the thesis that everyone ought to follow the principles whose universal acceptance everyone could rationally will. This</page><page sequence="36">1 006 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS paper examines that thesis, identifies a class of annoying counterexamples, and suggests that when Kantian Contractualism is modified in response to these examples, the resulting principle is too complex and ad hoc to serve as the "supreme principle of morality." Desires, Values, Reasons, and the Dualism of Practical Reason, MICHAEL SMITH In On What Matters, Derek Parfit argues that facts about reasons for action are grounded in facts about values, and contends against the view that they are grounded in facts about the desires that subjects would have after fully informed and rational deliberation. This article describes and evaluates Parfit's arguments for this value-based conception of reasons for action and finds them wanting. It also assesses his response to Sidgwick's suggestion that there is a Dualism of Practical Reason. Parfit seems not to notice that his preferred value-based conception of reasons for action augurs strongly in favor of a view like Sidgwick's.</page></plain_text>
