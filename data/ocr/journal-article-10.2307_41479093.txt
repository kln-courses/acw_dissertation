<plain_text><page sequence="1">v Editor's Introduction The theme of this issue, Andrei Platonov: Style, Context ; Meaning, is broad by design. The Ulbandus staff and I wanted to allow our contributors to focus on whatever element of Platonov's work was currently of greatest interest to them, be that his linguistic experiments, his place in the Soviet literary system, his philosophical orientation, or something altogether different. As it turned out, taking this approach proved quite fruitful, as it yielded a rich mix of insights into a wide range of Platonov's compositions and the literary environment in which he created them. When read alongside one another, the articles collected here create a lively and productive conversation about Platonov's oeuvre and our strategies for making sense of it. Part One ("Interpretations") approaches individual works by Platonov. It opens with Aage Hansen-Löve's " Chevengur Between Defamiliarization and Compassion," which analyzes Platonov's novel in the context of Russian neoprimitivism. Next, we feature three articles on Kotlovan ( The Foundation Pit). The first, by Natalia Duzhina, examines one of the principal figures of the novella, "the common proletarian house," and offers a possible literary source for it. In the second, Olga Meerson discusses how collaborating with Robert Chandler on a translation of Kotlovan gave her new insights into the novella's Biblical and liturgical intertexts. The last article in this set, Tora Lane's "A Groundless Foundation Pit" analyzes the novella as a meditation on the attempt to form a new base for language, culture, and society after the Revolution. Part One is rounded off by Robert Chandler's reassessment of The Magic Ring as an integral "final chapter" in the "single book" of Platonov's varied works and Bela Shayevich's original illustrations for Platonov's skalka "Bezruchka" ("No-Arms"). Part Two ("Contexts") puts Platonov in dialogue with a diverse set of his predecessors and contemporaries. Boris Gasparov investigates the "family resemblance" between Platonov and Fedor Mikhailovich Reshetnikov, arguing that Platonov's lineage stretches back to the nineteenth-century physiological sketch. Robert Hödel then charts the development of Platonov's narrative perspective from his early prose fiction to Chevengur against the background of the author's literary environment. After this, we turn to three articles that discuss Platonov's relationship to official Soviet culture. First, Natalia Kornienko details the points of contact between Platonov and the "first proletarian poet," Dem'ian Bednyi. Next, Evgeny Dobrenko attends to the clash between the linguistic projections of Stalin and those of Platonov. Finally, Jonathan Brooks Piatt evaluates Platonov's engagement with the Pushkin jubilee campaign of 1936-1937.</page><page sequence="2">vi Part Three ("Syntheses") offers new perspectives on Platonov's oeuvre. First, Hans Günther explores the prominent role of anthropomorphism, zoomorphism, and metamorphosis in Platonov's texts. Natalia Poltavtseva then approaches the problem of power in Platonov's plays, arguing that the dynamics of Self and Other are central to these philosophically rich - and often poorly staged - compositions. Next, Thomas Seifrid examines how the existential drama of virtually all of Platonov's narratives is staged as a "drama of sight." Finally, Philip Ross Bullock takes up the problem of what "openness" might mean in the case of Platonov, linking developments in the study of his practice as a writer with reflections on the significance of his prose for readers. I extend my profound gratitude to all those who helped make this issue possible. I offer my thanks not only to those listed in the acknowledgments section, but also to Bradley Gorski, Greta Matzner- Gore, Brittany Pheiffer, Emily Traverse, and Edward Tyerman for their editing assistance; to Kelsey Rubin-Detlev for managing the journal's circulation; and to Boris Gasparov for doing so much to ensure the quality of our conference and its published proceedings. Most of all, I am grateful to the scholars who presented papers in New York last February and then generously contributed articles to this volume. I am confident that our readers will be as inspired by your work as I have been. Katharine Holt February 2012</page></plain_text>
