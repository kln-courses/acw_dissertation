<plain_text><page sequence="1">Michael Longley: Poet in No Man's Land FRAN BREARTON 'For here the lover and killer are mingled' Keith Douglas, Vergissmeinnichť 'I have written ... in a kind of space between - 1 don't know between quite what -' David Jones, 'In Parenthesis' L 'I am still of [the] opinion', Yeats writes, 'that only two topics can be of the least interest to a serious and studious mind - sex and the dead'.1 Echoing this attitude, Longley states '[m]y concerns continue to be Eros and Thanatos, the traditional subject-matter of the lyric', concerns that are focused for him by 'the natural world' and by 'the catastrophe of the First World War, the influence of that catastrophe on subsequent Irish and European history and politics'.2 Those two things - the war and the natural world - like love and death, impinge upon each other throughout his work; both inform a psychic land- scape that, Yeatsian-style, is always characterised by awareness of its dual possibilities. Paul Durcan notes the grounding of Longley's aes- thetic in the landscape, literal and metaphorical, of the Great War, a grounding which has coloured all his collections from the early No Continuing City through to the recent The Ghost Orchid : 'Longley's themes: Of Love and War. The First World War (which was the begin- ning of the Irish tragedy as indeed it was the beginning of every other convulsion in the western world in the twentieth century) has been the primal landscape of Longley's poetry from the start'.3 The dual possibilities, the ambivalence informing that landscape are inherent in, and originate in, the No Man's Land of the Great War. Con- sequently, No Man's Land resonates both literally and symbolically in Longley's poetry. His engagement with the Great War starts with the ©CS 1998</page><page sequence="2">60 Critical Survey ; Volume 10 , Number 1 familial, expands to encompass a sense of poetic ancestry, and, more recently, has led to a conscious redefinition and rehabilitation of the politics - in the broadest sense of the word - of remembrance, all three strands working in the elegiac mode. And elegy is, he notes, one side of a coin of which the love poem is the other.4 The sense of belonging in No Man's Land that resonates through his poetry is both symptomatic of, and a cause of, this engagement. No Man's Land, with its universal significance, begins as a private and literal ground for Longley, which gradually expands within his aesthetic to become an all-encompassing, sometimes intangible, imaginative space, potentially and simultane- ously redemptive and threatening, a place of infinite possibility and infinite regret. As it does so, it moves away from its specific historical location in 1914-1918, but also reaches back to those origins through a developing understanding in the poetry of the inherent ambiguities of the original Great War landscape, and the ways in which those ambi- guities have persisted through the century. During the Great War itself, No Man's Land was perceived both as actual and metaphorical space. The setting for the now legendary 'fraternisation' with the enemy on 25 December 1914, and for the car- nage of 1 July 1916, it was, in myth and in fact, both the place of greatest danger in the war and the only place where enemies met without enmity. It was the setting for some of the most anomalous events in trench-life: Leed notes that '[i]n certain sectors there were extraordinary agreements that provided for ... sunbathing on the first days of spring, and the cutting of grass and the harvesting of fruit in No Man's Land'.5 It was also the site of some of the most horrific experiences of the Great War: men drowning in shell-holes already filled with decaying flesh; wounded men, beyond help from behind the wire, dying over a number of days, their cries audible, and often unbearable, to those in the trenches; sappers buried alive beneath its surface. At its most appalling, it was beyond language, beyond description. Wilfred Owen, trying to describe No Man's Land, resorts to an apocalyptic mode, a heightened rhetoric that struggles, in one image after another, to convey what can only be approximated: It is like the eternal place of gnashing of teeth; the Slough of Despond could be contained in one if its crater-holes ... It is pock-marked like a body of foulest disease and its odour is the breath of cancer ...</page><page sequence="3">Michael Longley 61 No Man's Land under snow is like the face of the moon chaotic, crater- ridden, uninhabitable, awful, the abode of madness.6 But, he also writes, 'Christ is literally in no man's land. There men often hear His voice'.7 It is, paradoxically, the place of eternal damna- tion and of redemption. Unsurprisingly, No Man's Land became the focus of war myths - notably the belief that an army of deserters lived beneath its surface, scavenging off corpses - and it did so because it remained, to the end, an unknown quantity, an unconquerable space, at least in human terms. Eric Leed notes that for many Great War veterans, it persisted in the post-war years as 'their most disturbing and lasting image' of the war. No Man's Land was, he points out, 'the very image of the mar- ginal, the liminal, the "betwixt-and-between"'; as a term, it 'captured the essence of an experience of having been sent beyond the outer boundaries of social life, placed between the known and the unknown, the familiar and the uncanny'.8 The existence of a No Man's Land indicates perpetuation of a war of attrition; it is also a landscape where resolution of the problem is deceptively and tantalisingly possible. (The 'resolution' is the point where it is written out of existence.) In the post-war years, 'No Man's Land' has become a dominating metaphor for what David Jones calls 'the space between', for any- thing and everything which falls between or beyond reductive social, linguistic, political, literary and other categories. But if it is now indicative of a potential realm beyond reductive categorisation, it was also, in the Great War, a 'deathscape' which implicitly questioned the value of writing as it also made the act of writing more difficult. '[I]t is impossible now to work', Rosenberg complained in 1916, 'and dif- ficult even to think of poetry'; but, he also noted, 'if poetry at this time is no use it certainly won't be at any other'.9 No Man's Land is, there- fore, both the area which must be challenged if the poet is to find his own aesthetic space, and a metaphor which can create that space. It is the image of war which, perhaps more than any other, still dominates memory in the Western world; it is the place where the question '[w]hat is the use or function of poetry?' re-surfaced with a new energy and new resonance to worry the century's poets.10 Derek Mahon and Seamus Heaney began their careers, Longley suggests, with what he himself lacked, 'recourse to solid hinterlands - Heaney the much publicised farm in County Derry, Mahon his working-class background and the shipyards'. In contrast, Longley,</page><page sequence="4">62 Critical Survey, Volume 10, Number 1 who as a child 'walked out of an English household on to Irish streets' felt himself to be more obviously 'schizophrenic on the levels of nationality, class and culture'.11 As a result, No Man's Land is a land- scape which does not simply inform Longley's own poetic locale, rather it becomes that poetic locale: it is adapted and adopted as a kind of schizophrenic hinterland which, in acknowledging the con- tradictory nature of its origins, challenges as it enables the poetry. It offers a 'solid' ground whose solidity depends, paradoxically, On its fluidity, on its 'betwixt-and-between' quality. Significantly, the evolution of that hinterland is also entwined with the evolution of a distinctive poetic 'voice', and a growing awareness of identity as ultimately unquantifiable. Longley himself notes 'I was slow to find a voice, much slower than Mahon or Heaney'.12In retro- spect, a poem in his first collection, No Continuing City , has become, for critics, particularly noteworthy: the elegy for his father, 'In Memoriam'. It stands, in some ways, as a precursor to an aesthetic developed with greater effectiveness and wider resonance in subse- quent collections. In 'In Memoriam', the poet's father and, by implication, the poet, narrowly escape death in No Man's Land: Between the corpses and the soup canteens You swooned away, watching your future spill. But, as it was, your proper funeral urn Had mercifully smashed to smithereens, To shrapnel shards that sliced your testicle. That instant I, your most unlikely son, In No Man's Land was surely left for dead, Blotted out from your far horizon.13 The poet exists in two places - in life here and now, and in an imagi- native realm of non-existence. He is, therefore, indebted to the past, but exists in spite of the past, since No Man's Land is as much the land of what might have been as of what is. The poet projects back to meet the vision of the future, the 'far horizon', at the moment when it is under threat: his own far horizon recedes into the past to make present into future possibility. No Man's Land, both literally and metaphori- cally, is seen as his ground of inception as man and poet. The speaker of the poem, as well as his father, is a survivor of the Great War, if only by virtue of the poem he has written. And, by implication, since he was held secure by history, history will be secure with him: 'As your voice now is locked inside my head, / 1 yet was held secure, waiting my</page><page sequence="5">Michael Longley 63 turn'. The poem simultaneously finds a voice for the present as it enacts the finding of a voice in the past: from the words written 'in memory' (and from memory) of the father's 'anecdote rehearsed and summarised', the narrative is appropriated imaginatively as an authen- tic telling - 'Now I see in close-up...'. The 'last confidence' spoken by the father - 'You hunted down experimental lovers, / Persuading cho- rus girls and countesses' - enables the poet's own last confident resurrection of 'those lost wives', in a voice that can 'summon' and 'materialise', as consolation at the end of the poem: 'They lift their skirts like blinds across your eyes.' The poem is also inadvertently prophetic: 'old wounds woke / As cancer' resonates now in the wider context of Northern Ireland, and the re-surfacing of the Troubles in 1968. If the father's experience of the Great War is technically separated from the son's experience of Northern Ireland, the poem offers both the first connection between the two and the last distinction. In subsequent collections, his father is elegised again and again, not only because he is the subject of pri- vate grief, but also because he is representative of a generation who survived the trenches, and, more broadly, of twentieth-century war victims. An almost symbolic figure, he provides not merely a taproot into the wars of the past, but also a taproot into the present. In a two- way process, the Great War offers a way into writing about Northern Ireland, as Northern Ireland prompts an eternal imaginative return to the earlier conflict. That process also incorporates a development: if the strength of the early 'In Memoriam' lies in the way in which it expresses private grief through public utterance, a progression that is self-referential and heavily coded enables public utterance in the later poems to be mediated through what is felt as private grief. Longley describes 'In Memoriam' as 'some kind of descent from the ivory tower'; it confirmed for him the view that '[y]ou have got to bring your personal sorrow to the public utterance' to avoid the 'deadly danger of regarding the agony of others as raw material for your art, and your art as a solace for them in their suffering'.14 'Wounds', from his second collection, An Exploded View, is itself an exploded view of the earlier 'In Memoriam'. In 'Wounds', the Great War becomes, as Fussell notes, both an 'archetype for subsequent violence - as well as a criticism of it'. 15 The poem is notable, in the first instance, for being one of the few, and earliest, imaginative evo- cations of the Unionist experience of the Great War, an evocation which, in linking that experience with personal suffering, and with</page><page sequence="6">64 Critical Survey ; Volume 10, Number 1 sectarian killing in contemporary Northern Ireland, breaks tribal taboos 'kept ... like secrets', sets memory in opposition to society. It is an elegy for (sometimes misguided) innocence in whatever shape or form that might take: its sympathies encompass the Ulster Division and the 'boy about to die, / Screaming "Give 'em one for the Shankill!'", the teenage soldiers in Northern Ireland, 'bellies full of / Bullets and Irish beer', the murdered bus-conductor and his family, and the 'shivering boy' who pulls the trigger in front of 'the children', the 'bewildered wife' ( P , 86). Against the youth of those suffering and causing suffering in the poem is set the death of the father, a delayed result of violence that revises, or at least offers a retrospective per- spective on, the passionately held beliefs that inspire violent action. '[I]t seems to me', Longley writes, 'important ... to imagine how one can be so brain washed or so angry or in a sense perhaps even so inno- cent that one can drive in a car and go into somebody's house and shoot that person stone dead'. 16 The 'shivering boy', the 'teenage sol- diers', the innocent civilian victim - all these things are, unexpectedly, redolent of the now-notorious 'innocence' that charac- terised the 1914 generation, that led to the inspired, futile attacks on the Somme in 1916. 'Bewilderment' in both stanzas unites the actions if only in their incomprehensibility. The 'landscape of dead buttocks', over which his father followed for 'fifty years', is a permanent condi- tion: past and present, like the war and the consequent death(s), are not so much paralleled as telescoped into a seamless continuity. 'Wounds', as a title, thus encompasses more than the obvious wounds in the poem - the cancer, the bullet-holes. It looks back to the 'old wounds' of 'In Memoriam' ; it expands to include emotional as well as literal wounding, the open wounds of history aggravated in Northern Ireland in the early 1970s, the wounding of the innocent, the invisible scars left on society. Longley's elegies reveal not only the short-term, tangible damage caused by violence, but also the long-term effects not immediately, or possibly ever, readily apparent. The modern elegy, Ramazani writes, 'resembles not so much a suture as "an open wound'". It exists, in one sense, in the space between its author and its subject matter, to the extent that the subject matter itself may become the impossibility of crossing that space. Ramazani suggests that: Owen states only half of his paradoxical aesthetic when he writes: 'My subject is War, and the pity of War. The Poetry is in the pity' . . . His sub-</page><page sequence="7">Michael Longley 65 ject is also the incomprehensibility of war; the poetry is also in the alien- ation. Having roused pity, Owen often forces the reader back, warning that pity cannot bridge the chasm separating spectator and victim.17 In effect, he concludes, 'the poet inhabits a terrible no-man's-land between victim and reader'.18 Longley 's poetry, like that of the Great War poets, exists 'in the pity'. But, as with Owen, it exists also in the alienation, in its helpless awareness of the impossibility of reaching its own subject-matter. In 'Last Requests', that alienation is imaged as a tangible barrier: I thought you blew a kiss before you died, But the bony fingers that waved to and fro Were asking for a Woodbine, the last request Of many soldiers in your company, The brand you chose to smoke for forty years Thoughtfully, each one like a sacrament. I who brought peppermints and grapes only Couldn't reach you through the oxygen tent. (P, 150) It is also intangible, in the failure in understanding, and in the inabil- ity of love to counteract death: the 'Heart contradicting ... epitaph' in Part I does not do so metaphorically in Part II. The last request is also a last rite, one rehearsed again and again through a life that, after the experience of the Great War, is no longer taken for granted. Longley attributes to his father a sense of 'unexpected bonus' which 'pervaded all the ordinary aspects of life'.19 But the reverse side to a celebration of life - the awareness of death - is implicit in the 'sacramental' nature of celebration: each moment held as if it were both the first and the last. That sensibility forms what Fussell describes as 'the Great War theme - already mastered by Hardy even before the war broke out - of the ironic proximity of violence and disaster to safety, to meaning, and to love'.20 The persistence of that theme in Longley 's work means that the effective elegies are those which are anti-elegiac, that do not impose meaning or consolation on the inconsolable and incomprehensible, but instead point up the inadequacy of traditional elegiac resources. They do so as a way of finding a voice for, rather than an answer to, grief. Their hallmark, as with many of Owen's poems, is sometimes one of guilt. It is there at the end of 'Last Requests' for the failure to 'reach' his father; it is implicit in 'Kinder- totenlieder', which opts for a Dylan Thomas 'Refusal to Mourn',</page><page sequence="8">66 Critical Survey, Volume 10, Number 1 mourns the fact that it can no longer mourn, but still creates, though rhythmic repetition, the song it will not create: 'There can be no songs for dead children ... No songs for the children ... ' (P, 87). As, per- haps, with every modern elegist, 'every elegy is an elegy for elegy'.21 II. Fussell's Great War theme is a theme peculiarly pertinent to Northern Ireland, where the redemptive ground is also, in Keith Douglas's phrase, 'the nightmare ground', where 'proximity' collapses into syn- onymy. The private, domestic space, which in the Great War was idealised by the soldier at the Front, is no longer inviolate: the domes- tic details in 'Wounds', the invasion of violence 'Before they could turn the television down / Or tidy away the supper dishes' (P, 86), hint at what is explored more comprehensively in the later 'The Civil Ser- vant', from the sequence 'Wreaths': He was preparing an Ulster fry for breakfast When someone walked into the kitchen and shot him: A bullet entered his mouth and pierced his skull, The books he had read, the music he could play. (P, 148) 'I will not', Rosenberg insisted in the trenches, 'leave a corner of my consciousness covered up'.22 In the face of random domestic killing, Longley implies, it is, in any case, impossible to do so. Longley has absorbed the 'hereditary' knowledge from the First World War that colours all subsequent perceptions, and that he writes with a sense of 'pervasive, latent war' may be one reason why the title 'war poet' is attributed to him perhaps even more frequently than to Heaney, even if Heaney, as the more popular figure, has been exposed to greater 'war poet' pressures from the public. It may also be something to do with the fact that a poet in Ireland is known partly by the ancestry he keeps. The family ghosts who habitually walk Longley's poetry are rarely separated from the war which he perceives as a turning point for Western civilisation, and in which they were intimately, and destructively involved: from his father, to 'Uncle Lionel' who 'good for nothing except sleep-walking to the Great War ... [collected lit- tered limbs' in a sack until 'His head got blown off in No Man's Land' ( P , 133), (and whose 'vanishing act', Longley writes, 'haunted my childhood'23), to his mother, elegised in 'Third Light' as making</page><page sequence="9">Michael Longley 67 the transition from life to death, to re-marry her husband, on a Great War battlefield: 'Waiting to scramble hand in hand with him / Out of the shell hole ... 4 (P, 200) and his grandmother with 'second sight' and 'Flanders ... at the kitchen window - / The mangle rusting in No Man's Land, gas / Turning the antimacassars yellow' (P, 151). His sense of the Great War as a political and social crisis which Europe is 'still getting over' is also allied to his sense of literary antecedents. To a greater extent than perhaps any other contemporary Northern Irish poet, Longley's aesthetic measures itself against the war poets associated with the First and Second World Wars: Owen, Douglas, Thomas, Rosenberg. '[0]ne is shamed by the example of ... Wilfred Owen', Longley suggests, since 'in the front line, [he] just sat down and wrote poems'.24 It is not as simple as it sounds, in that Owen fought and killed even as he offered the 'pity of war' as his sub- ject. But it does recognise that the answer to the dilemma - as it was also Owen's answer - is to write the dilemma. It is perhaps for this reason that Brendan Kennelly describes Longley as 'probably the most confident poet writing in Ireland today ... the one who most suc- cessfully resists the temptation to explain himself or his work'.25 The 'apologia', either for one's political activities, or inactivities, is not made to facilitate poetry; rather it constitutes the poetry: I accept, as I must, the criticism of the slogan 'Malone Road fiddles while the Falls Road burns', the implication that the still and heartless centre of the hurricane is the civic inactivity of liberals like myself. Nevertheless, I have to insist that poetry is an act which in the broadest sense can be judged political, a normal human activity . . .26 For Longley, the war poets serve to prove the point that the lyric tradi- tion is alive and kicking, and potentially inexhaustible. Crucially, his own sense of a literary tradition is validated not so much because it is formed in No Man's Land, but because it survives and precedes it. The sense of tradition serves to validate for Longley an underlying assump- tion that 'the equipment as lyric poets'27 to deal with conflict is lyric poetry. In a retrospect on the reasons behind the stylistic inheritance of the Ulster 'tight-assed trio', the description sometimes applied, with a negative charge, to Mahon, Longley and Heaney, he suggests that: the poets here needed some kind of shape with which to deal with the emerging nightmare of the Troubles. Some kind of tact was required; some kind of order was required, which meant that all of the resources of</page><page sequence="10">68 Critical Survey, Volume 10, Number 1 the native tradition were required. And that meant looking to what had happened at an earlier time of disturbance and menace . . .28 To be a 'war poet' may simply be, in the broadest definition, to assert the inherent value of poetry at a time when it appears to be proscribed, whilst simultaneously destabilising the text by opening it up to the very context in which it is threatened. Since that context - a psychic landscape that is also a landscape of war - is seen by Longley (as, also, by Ted Hughes) as the essential condition of the twentieth century, the war poet 'ancestors' are also appropriated, imaginatively, as ghostly contemporaries: in 'Second Sight', the poet himself is, in a traditional as well as familial sense, a 'ghost among ghosts ... Who crowd around me to give directions' in the troglodyte trench- world of the London Underground ( P , 151). Notably in the two late 1970s collections, Man Lying on a Wall and The Echo Gate, the war poets become subjects as well as precursors: Edward Thomas, Keith Douglas and Isaac Rosenberg are obliquely elegised in a way which casts the subject of elegy as the ghostly self- elegiser. 'Edward Thomas's War Diary' (P, 134) undertakes the task that Thomas himself, killed in 1917, was largely unable to fulfil, or even begin - to write the experience of the Front into his poetry. 'Mole', the companion piece to 'Edward Thomas's War Diary', also fills in the blanks, responding to Thomas's original question - 'Does a mole ever get hit by a shell?' - with its own further question, a question that encompasses the whole poem and in doing so turns Thomas's original question into its own answer: Who bothers to record This body digested By its own saliva Inside the earth's mouth And long intestine, Or thanks it for digging Its own grave, darkness Growing like an eyelid Over the eyes, hands Swimming in the soil? (P, 135) The poem's anthropomorphism serves to elegise the dead of the war (including Thomas himself) - the soldiers lost in a communal grave;</page><page sequence="11">Michael Longley 69 the men who were drowned in the mud of No Man's Land; more gen- erally, those forgotten by history: the 'vanishing act[s]'. The lines also reverberate in a Northern Irish context, with its own unrecorded or unremembered vanishing acts. 'Concepts such as "a clean slate" and "drawing a line" are', Longley writes, 'offensive. If we are not ever to know who bombed Enniskillen, Birmingham, Dublin and Monaghan, we can at least go on asking "Where are all the missing bodies of the last twenty-five years? Where have they been buried?" In the ghastly paramilitary argot these are the "bog jobs".'29 In 'Bog Cotton', different historical and geographical perspectives also work to illuminate the poet's home ground. Keith Douglas, in 'Desert Flowers', acknowledges, ironically, the 'tautological' nature of the war-poet's enterprise: Living in a wide landscape are the flowers- Rosenberg I only repeat what you were saying- the shell and the hawk every hour are slaying men and jerboas, slaying the mind: but the body can fill the hungry flowers and the dogs who cry words at nights, the most hostile things of all. But that is not new.30 All the Great War elements are here: the flowers, the rats, the quench- ing of human spirit as well as life, the enemy (the opposing army) that is not really felt as the true enemy (lice, rats, etc.). The first stanza of Longley's 'Bog Cotton' stylistically imitates 'Desert Flowers', but with a difference: Let me make room for bog cotton, a desert flower- Keith Douglas, I nearly repeat what you were saying When you apostrophised the poppies of Flanders And the death of poetry there ... (P, 167) The poem evokes images of the First and Second world wars, but the 'flower' on his Irish landscape is not one which feeds on the corpses of victims of violence; it acknowledges the war landscapes evoked by his poetic predecessors, but attempts to make instead a 'hospital' of his own. To 'make room' is a tentative endeavour, against the odds, that takes place entirely in parentheses. The parentheses extend through the second and third stanzas to become the substance of the</page><page sequence="12">70 Critical Survey, Volume 10, Number 1 poem, pushing outwards to create, literally and metaphorically, the 'space between': '(It hangs on by a thread, denser than thistledown, / Reluctant to fly ... And useless too, though it might well bring to mind / The plumping of pillows, the staunching of wounds It is a healing pastoral which, with awareness of the ambiguous nature and function of pastoral in the wars, makes no such grandiose claims for itself. As with Douglas's own 'Desert Flowers', fine detail is rewarded with a far horizon: the two, in fact, become inseparable. Douglas, in his final stanza, writes: I see men as trees suffering or confound the detail and the horizon. Lay the coin on my tongue and I will sing of what the others never set eyes on. Longley's tribute to Douglas's vision works with the same technique: it sees beyond the Second to the First World War, and does so from the perspective of his own ground: You saw that beyond the thirstier desert flowers There fell hundreds of thousands of poppy petals Magnified to blood stains by the middle distance Or through the still unfocused sights of a rifle - And Isaac Rosenberg wore one behind his ear. (P, 167) The 'hundreds of thousands of poppy petals' evoke the poppy petal shower of Remembrance Day ceremonies, realised fully in the poem, in the context of another war, as deaths - 'Magnified to blood stains': the last line, while it looks back to Rosenberg's poem, also looks to his death. Longley family and literary ghosts, hitherto never explicitly con- nected in the poems, converge on 'No Man's Land'. The first half of the poem appeared in Man Lying on a Wall entitled 'Granny'. An elegy for his 'jewish granny', the poem redresses the neglect of her memory, gives her substance within the family history - 'I shall give skin and bones / To my jewish granny ...' - and obliquely indicts the anti-Semitism of the twentieth century: 'A terrible century, / A circle of Christian names'. It was subsequently rewritten to become Part I of 'No Man's Land', included in the 'New Poems' of Poems 1963-1983. The poem is both a culmination of the preoccupations that colour the first four collections; it also points towards the themes which dominate the later two:</page><page sequence="13">Michael Longley 71 I Who will give skin and bones to my Jewish granny? She has come down to me in the copperplate writing Of three certificates, a dog-eared daguerreotype And the one story my grandfather told about her. He tossed a brick through a rowdy neighbour's window As she lay dying, and Jessica, her twenty years And mislaid whereabouts gave way to a second wife, A terrible century, a circle of Christian names. II I tilt her head towards you, Isaac Rosenberg, But can you pick out that echo of splintering glass From under the bombardment, and in No Man's Land What is there to talk about but difficult poems? Because your body was not recovered either I try to read the constellations of brass buttons, Identity discs that catch the light a little. A shell-shocked carrier pigeon flaps behind the lines. ( P , 199) The 'vanishing act[s]' in his family history are connected here to both world wars and the issue of remembering the century's dead. On one level, Longley 's poem is a Holocaust poem: less confident than the ear- lier version - opening assertion modified to question - the attempt in 'No Man's Land' to give tragic status and human dignity to his 'Jewish granny' loses its significance in a 'terrible century' simply by reason of numbers. It returns to the Great War as the origin of a 'terrible century', the first calamity in which the sheer scale of suffering seemed to disal- low space for individual tragedy ('can you pick out that echo While the 'mislaid whereabouts' of Jessica may be literal - as it is with Rosen- berg, whose 'body was not recovered' - it refers also, and in both cases, to a mislaid whereabouts in history: those for whom public remem- brance has obscured remembering; those whose deaths themselves are unrecorded; the deaths whose numbers are not even known. Connect- ing the two deaths also evokes the concept of the lost generations - Jessica's 'twenty years' serving as an ironic counterpoint to the 'granny' of conventional expectation and one which offers a parallel with the soldier-poets killed prematurely in the Great War. If the place in which the poet is writing is in some respects a No Man's Land, he is implicitly passing judgement on a society which forces poetry into the margins (a society which has also permitted</page><page sequence="14">72 Critical Survey, Volume 10, Number 1 much of its own history to founder there). It is also an implicit judge- ment on the political violence of his own country where, as Falkenhayn said of the First World War, '[t]he first principle ... [is] ... to yield not one foot of ground'.31 Sassoon wrote that: while exploring my way into the War I had discovered the impermanence of its humanities. One evening we could all be together in a cosy room in Corbie, with Wilmot playing the piano ... A single machine-gun or a few shells might wipe out the whole picture within a week . . . And now there was a steel curtain down between April and May. On the other side of the curtain, if I was lucky, I should meet the survivors, and we should begin to build up our little humanities all over again.32 In 'No Man's Land', Longley writes from a poetic landscape that is designed to make the survival of poetry as evidently problematic as it is felt to be within the poetic tradition of war poets that he constructs in his own verse. But the poem simultaneously searches, through Part II, for a way of hearing, articulating and visualising that which is in danger of obliteration - not only Sassoon's 'humanities', but, more specifically, poetry itself. In the rhetorical question 'in No Man's Land / What is there to talk about but difficult poems?', Adorno's suggestion that to write poetry after Auschwitz is 'barbaric' is up for interrogation, as it is also countered. 'Perhaps', Longley states elsewhere, Adorno was 'suggesting that there would have to be distortions, that art would have to contort and hurt itself before it could face a nightmare like that'.33 The rhetorical question in 'No Man's Land' both recognises the distortion and asserts the value of poetry (inherent in its difficulty) within that distorted and traumatised context. Famously, Owen wrote in his draft preface: 'if the spirit of [this book] survives - survives Prussia - my ambition ... will have achieved fresher fields than Flan- ders'.34^ at first glance, this seems to suggest that the war landscape can be erased from memory, or at least contained in the Western Front, it is obvious now (as it was to Owen then) that it cannot. It is as much a psychic condition as it was a geographical entity. But Owen still implies what Sassoon explicitly asserted: 'The only effective answer that a poet can make to barbarism is poetry, for the only answer to death is the life of the spirit. Explosives cannot destroy the immaterial or dumbfound the utterance of inspiration.'35 When, in the final stanza of 'No Man's Land', the poet tries to read 'the constellations of brass buttons', he is attempting to find his way in a landscape where, the pre- vious stanza implies, poetry itself might founder, a No Man's Land</page><page sequence="15">Michael Longley 73 strewn with dead bodies in quantities like the stars.36 Longley 's poetic hinterland is always qualified by the 'shell-shocked carrier pigeon' flapping behind the lines of the verse. But in the ebb and flow of what can or cannot be heard, seen, or created under the bombardment, the desire to build up what Sassoon describes as 'humanities' is consis- tently present. '[T]o admit any hope of a better world', Keith Douglas wrote, 'is criminally foolish, as foolish as it is to stop working for it',37 and it is an awareness of the validity of this contradiction that informs the landscape of Longley's poetry, as it informs the Great War itself. III. Gor se Fires, 38 which appeared after a twelve year gap, was, rightly, hailed as a volume which signalled a new energy in Longley's writ- ing. And The Ghost Orchid 09 is, in many ways, a continuation of Gorse Fires. The two volumes negotiate both with each other, and with Longley's previous collections. The poems work in the fine dividing line between memory and remembrance, birth and death, love and war, barbarity and civility. No Man's Land remains a poetic locale, a paradigm of the 'betwixt and between'. That sensibility dominates Gorse Fires; in its epigraph imagined 'Between now and one week ago ...'; 'Between hovers and not too far from the holt' (GF, 5); 'the otter, on wet sand in between, / Engraves its own reflec- tion and departure' (GF, 6); 'travelling from one April to another. / It is the same train between the same embankments' (GF, 10); 'I lie awake between the two sleeping couples' (GF, 17); 'Between the bells and prayers ...' (GF, 27); 'harmonics, / A blackbird fluttering between electrified fences' (GF, 43). The sense of No Man's Land as poetic hinterland expands in these later collections to become an all- encompassing hinterland as secure in its indeterminacy as Heaney's specific geographical locale. The Great War elegies of Poems 1963- 1983 feed into the elegies of Gorse Fires. 'Between Hovers', an elegy for Joe O'Toole, looks back to 'Third Light': the dead badger in the poem is 'a filament of light our lights had put out' . (It also evokes the guilt and love of Othello's tormented 'Put out the light, and then put out the light'.) The ghosts of 'Second Sight' who collapse distinctions between past and future, life and death, metamorphosise into the 'dying otter' who 'gaze[d] right through me ... as though it were only / Between hovers' (GF, 5). The poet's relationship with his father, and</page><page sequence="16">74 Critical Survey, Volume 10, Number 1 through his father, the world wars, is rehearsed again in the Homeric translations that also reflect on violence in Northern Ireland. Odysseus is 'the master-craftsman ... love-poet, carpenter' (GF, 25); the compassionate custodian of memory who 'drew the old man faint- ing to his breast and held him there / And cradled like driftwood the bones of his dwindling father' (GF, 33), (looking back to the voice 'held secure', 'locked inside my head' of the early 'In Memoriam'). But if he is the lover, he is also the killer who, in 'The Butchers', 'made sure there were no survivors in his house / And that all the suit- ors were dead, heaped in blood and dust', became 'a lion dripping blood / From his chest and cheeks', and who 'hanged the women', the 'disloyal housemaids'. The poem returns to a specifically Irish con- text at the end: their souls 'came to a bog-meadow full of bog-asphodels / Where the residents are ghosts or images of the dead' (GF, 51), an image that in 'Bog Cotton' is connected with victims of both world wars and the Northern Ireland Troubles. The moments of poignant healing are counterbalanced by acts of butchery, and vice versa, ad infinitum (or, in effect, for as long as one requires the other): the poems traverse the distance between the two as they also acknowl- edge their mutual dependence. As Odysseus is a double-sided figure - 'lover and killer ... mingled' - so too the love poems of the later vol- umes are also the war poems. In 'The Kilt', the father's march into battle, to kill 'in real life', is accompanied, in the final stanza, by an act of love: You pick up the stitches and with needle and thread Accompany him out of the grave and into battle, Your arms full of material and his nakedness. (TGO, 25) Longley writes: 'I suppose that my love poetry is addressed to what I grandiosely call the female principle, to the Gravesian notion of the Muse' . 40 If he is a Muse poet, he is also a war poet and a political poet in a sense that Graves, Longley's 'kindred spirit', would, Mahon notes, have recognised. Longley protests against the 'ruin' wrought by what Graves, in The White Goddess, describes as the 'capricious experiments in philosophy, science and industry'.41 Set against those capricious experiments is the act of naming, a technique which reaches its apotheosis in Gorse Fires, notably in 'The Ice-Cream Man' and 'Ghetto'. It is a technique which was also a mainstay of First World War writing, a ritualistic assertion of sanity, or, in T.S.</page><page sequence="17">Michael Longley 75 Eliot's phrase: 'These fragments I have shored against my ruins'. It is present not merely because it was a Georgian poetic convention, but because it offers at least a form of response to that which cannot be contained within a coherent narrative; in the last analysis, naming means something to write, the sounding of a voice. Edward Thomas's perceptions of the 'ruin of Estaminet' are recorded in his diary as: 'wet, mortar, litter, almanacs, bottles, broken glass, damp beds, dirty paper, knife, crucifix, statuette, old chairs.'42 Sassoon habitually Usted the belongings taken out to France after each leave; he also devotes two pages of his wartime diary to listing fifty-seven '[b]irds seen in Judaea'.43 Hemingway writes of the Great War: ... I had seen nothing sacred, and the things that were glorious had no glory and the sacrifices were like the stockyards at Chicago if nothing was done with the meat except to bury it. There were many words that you could not stand to hear and finally only the names of places had dignity. Certain num- bers were the same way and certain dates and these with the names of places were all you could say and have them mean anything. Abstract words such as glory, honour, courage, or hallow were obscene beside the concrete names of villages, the numbers of roads, the names of rivers . . .M John Lyon's illuminating study of Longley's lists notes that 'their recoverable literary origins [are] in the epic lists of Homer', but that the 'attractions of naming, classifying and cataloguing also manifest themselves early in the poet's own biography'.45 The breakdown of the relationship between word, concept and experience in the Great War, the failure of language, and yet, paradoxically, the refuge of words, might also be added to this analysis, as an origin which com- bines the biographical and intertextual. In 'Laertes': Odysseus sobbed in the shade of a pear-tree for his father So old and pathetic that all he wanted then and there Was to kiss him and hug him and blurt out the whole story, But the whole story is one catalogue and then another. (GF, 33) Listing, then, is a form in which the inaccessibility of the subject mat- ter and the inadequacy of language is turned into the subject matter. 'Laertes' has Gravesian echoes: 'There is one story and one story only'46 which is told and retold. The one story in Longley - or rather the 'whole story' - is itself the problem of telling. In this sense, 'The Ice-Cream Man', is, understandably, as Lyon notes, 'currently acquir-</page><page sequence="18">76 Critical Survey, Volume 10, Number 1 ing the status of a poetic touchstone'.47 Every word in the poem 'works for its keep', and does so with awareness of its own inade- quacy. It imitates a traditional Georgian form of pastoral - naming as many flora as possible in one poem - with the naming an almost 'reli- gious' incantation, an attempted stay against violence which, in contrast to Georgian pastoral, is aware of itself as such not only within history but within the context of the poem: Rum and raisin, vanilla, butter-scotch, walnut, peach: You would rhyme off the flavours. That was before They murdered the ice-cream man on the Lisburn Road And you bought carnations to lay outside his shop. I named for you all the wild flowers of the Burren I had seen in one day: thyme, valerian, loosestrife, Meadowsweet, tway blade, crowfoot, ling, angelica, Herb robert, maijoram, cow parsley, sundew, vetch, Mountain avens, wood sage, ragged robin, stitchwort, Yarrow, lady's bedstraw, bindweed, bog pimpernel. (GF, 49) The poem incorporates the violence which implicitly tries to unravel the list even as it is formed. Thus, the list is felt to be never-ending. That sense is illustrative of its limitations - one might list forever, but the death still occurred; it is also implicitly an indictment of the on- going violence which prompted the list, and an acknowledgement that the effects of that violence are not finite. The two lists of flavours and flowers within the poem exist on either side ('before' and after) of the short sentence - the killing - which neither of them reaches: struc- turally, the poem embodies the impossibility of traversing the psychological distance between then and now - pre- and post- violent interruption. The once inspiring and consolatory concepts of sacrifice, glory and honour no longer hold meaning after the Great War. In 'The Ice-Cream Man', the catalogue itself becomes the 'in memoriam', rather than any abstract ideals embodied within it: the flower-names, in Longley's own phrase, are turned into 'a wreath of words'.48 For Longley, the idea of poetry as a gesture of remembrance, a 'wreath', is a way of redirecting the traditional forms of remembrance that have sometimes served to obscure rather than illuminate history. 'The Remembrance Day ceremony', he argues, 'encourages us not to remember how shrapnel and bullets flay and shatter human flesh and bones, how continuous bombardment destroys minds as well as bod- ies'. The recitation of Binyon's 'We will remember them' from 'For</page><page sequence="19">Michael Longley 77 the Fallen' is, he suggests, used as a 'mind-numbing narcotic'. In opposition to this, he places the work of Owen, Sassoon, Rosenberg, Sorley and Gurney, work which undermines the 'cult of remem- brance' which has developed over the years.49 To oppose, as Sorley did, 'mind-numbing' consolations - the forms of remembrance that are akin to, and as culpable as, forgetfulness - is also the driving force behind Longley's latest collection, The Ghost Orchid. A volume concerned with memory, it is dominated by the colours and symbols of remembrance, those associated with the wars of the twentieth cen- tury - snow, white feathers; red poppies, blood - colours that also evoke the sacrament (sacrifice) of the Eucharist. 'We Irish', Longley writes, 'are good at claiming a monopoly on human suffering. We are good at resurrecting and distorting the past in order to evade the pre- sent. In Ireland we must break the mythic cycles and resist unexamined, ritualistic forms of commemoration.'50 One of the strengths of The Ghost Orchid is that it uses the images of 'mythic cycles' in order to break or disrupt them: traditional symbolism is redirected in order to interrogate the values (or evasions) behind it. Thus, in 'Poppies', the poppy is the wound itself; but it also inflicts wounds in a controversial remembrance that has little to do with the dead and everything to do with versions of history: Some people tried to stop other people wearing poppies And ripped them from lapels as though uprooting poppies From Flanders fields, but the others hid inside their poppies Razor blades and added to their poppies more red poppies. ( TGO , 40) The poem describes events in Ireland, notably in Dublin, in the post- war years: it also indicts what becomes a self-perpetuating blood feud, from war to remembrance to war. Two histories compete: one which would 'uproot' its past from any connection with 'Flanders fields', the other which wears its historical wounding on the Western Front as a weapon. If the poppy is seen here as a tool manipulated by competing and reductive mythologies, in 'Buchenwald Museum' it is rehabilitated as a symbol of that which it is both difficult and painful to remember - the history that is forgotten by, because it complicates, political 'bias': Among the unforgettable exhibits one Was an official apology for bias. Outside</page><page sequence="20">78 Critical Survey, Volume 10, Number 1 Although a snowfall had covered everything A wreath of poppies was just about visible. No matter how heavily the snow may come down We have to allow the snow to wear a poppy. ( TGO , 41) The poem's imagery, as with others in the collection, also looks to Mahon, MacNeice, Eliot, Wallace Stevens. To 'allow the snow to wear a poppy', however difficult that conjunction might be, incorpo- rates a veiled allusion to Louis MacNeice's 'Snow': 'the great bay-window ... / Spawning snow and pink roses against it / Sound- lessly collateral and incompatible .../ There is more than glass between the snow and the huge roses'. Longley's snow also owes something to Eliot's The Waste Land, where the 'pathetic fallacy' associating winter with death and spring with birth is parodied and reversed: 'April' is 'the cruellest month ... mixing / Memory and desire, stirring / Dull roots with spring rain', a painful awakening and remembering set in opposition to the 'Winter' which, paradoxically, insulates the mind from reality, and 'kept us warm, covering / Earth in forgetful snow'. The 'snowscape' of poems in The Ghost Orchid (and Gorse Fires) is an inherently ambiguous and dualistic landscape, one which may be both a healing and a cover-up; it may symbolise death, or disguise it, obscure images or freeze them. Thus, one side of the image - 'the snowscape of the big double-bed' (TGO, 34); snow as 'feathers from the wings of Icarus', an imaginary fountain of poetry (TGO, 57) - is compromised by awareness of its other - 'the need for whitewash and disinfectant' ( GF , 51); the obliteration of voice, 'as if snow had fallen ... ' (TGO, 54). The child in 'Ghetto' who is fixed in memory - 'He turns into a little snowman and refuses to melt' (GF, 41) - and who lingers on into The Ghost Orchid ('the melting snowman was somebody's child', 10), also reminds of the paradoxical nature of elegising in Wallace Stevens's 'The Snow Man', the anti-elegiac striving after a 'mind of winter ... not to think / Of any misery'. In Tuppenny Stung, Longley quotes Don Shriver's '[t]he cure and the remembrance are co-terminous'.51 'Remembrance' itself, though, the experience of Northern Ireland makes clear, is a double-edged sword, one which can harden into what Mahon calls 'the rigor mortis of archaic postures, political and cultural' or melt into the 'fluidity of a possible life' .52 For Longley, writing from a hin- terland informed by both, the 'cure' is in the balance of opposing forces, the potentiality of the space between: 'The wind-farmer's</page><page sequence="21">Michael Longley 79 small-holding reaches as far as the horizon. / Between fields of hail- stones and raindrops his frost-flowers grow' (TGO, 50).
