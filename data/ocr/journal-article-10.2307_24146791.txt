This is un derstandable because evolution is an abstract and generally non-observable phenomenon, and living things do seem well-designed for their environments. Even those students who have taken a college biology course retain essentially Lamarckian views of evolu tion. They tend to believe that an organism's survival needs cause offspring to acquire adaptive features. The slow outworking of natural selec tion on random mutations is not intu itively obvious. The purpose of this ar ticle is to present a simple activity that simulates natural selection working on random mutations through many gen erations. THE ACTIVITY Creating imaginary creatures for educa tional purposes has been used to teach classification of organisms and the work ing of natural selection. The imaginary creatures made here differ in that they are the product of students' random moves on graph paper followed by teacher selec tion. (Figure 1 summarizes the evolution ary concepts that can be covered during this activity.) Students work in pairs during this ac tivity. Each team will need a brown paper lunch bag, graph paper, and a pen or pencil. Before class, you should make a copy of Figure 2 for each pair of students, cut each copy into 16 direction-giving strips, and place the strips in a lunch bag. When class begins, distribute a sheet of graph paper to each student and ask them to fill in the center square of the grid. You are now ready to begin the activity. To start, students mix the contents of the bag thoroughly and, without looking, randomly draw out a single strip. They then darken the squares on their graph paper according to the instructions on the strip. Figure 3 is an example of how the instructions should be followed. They should repeat this sequence 20 times and finish by circling the last square that they JANUARY 1993 ■ 43 EVOLVING STUDENT THOUGHT Simulating evolution over many generations by Jan Peczkis</page><page sequence="3">FIGURE 1. The evolutionary concepts. EVOLUTIONARY CONCEPT Mutations are accidents in the genes of organisms. They do not occur according to any purpose; they just happen. Mutations cause a large variation of organisms in a population. There is room on Earth for only a fraction of organisms that are born or hatched. The individuals which happen to have the mutations giving them the best adapta tions to the environment will be the ones that survive. The survivors will have their own offspring. The offspring will be subject to their own random mutations. Again, only the most advantageous mutations will result in the survival of the next genera tion of offspring. Countless generations of mutations and natural selection result in organisms that have very different structures. SIMULATION The "mutations" in the imaginary creatures (squares drawn by following random commands) do not occur for any purpose. Since every student performs a different sequence of moves, every drawing is different. There are as many different designs as there are students. A few of the drawings will happen to have the features which will cause them to be chosen by the teacher. These will be photocopied and redistributed to the students. Students will add "mutations" to the photocopied drawing. Again, only a few of the modified drawings will have the features that will cause the teacher to select them for further photocopying and redistribution to students. Several "generations" of random additions of filled squares, selection of specific designs by teacher, and photocopying of the selected designs results in figures that have very different features.

This will be the starting point for the next generation. The teacher now acts as the agent of natural selection, by searching out certain adaptations (such as a circular shape) from among all the patterns. The designs se lected become the ones that leave descen dants (are photocopied). The five features I chose are shown in Figure 4. You should avoid choosing patterns that resemble particular objects (such as a lamp or flower) because this may reinforce the miscon ception that evolution is goal oriented. The photocopies are given to the stu dents, and they are told to repeat the procedure of darkening squares accord ing to the random instructions, starting with the last square previously filled in (the circled one). The teacher then, once again, selects the drawings with adapta tions—either new ones or the same ones used before. This entire procedure can be repeated several times, resulting in a variety of creatures that are very different from each other (Figure 4). I have found it to be helpful not to tell students in advance what the selected features will be so that students can see that mutations are ran dom and not goal-directed. It also dis courages "fudging" of drawings. I monitor students carefully to see that they are following instructions and re mind them to mix the contents of the bag thoroughly to ensure a random selection of instruction slips. The student creations should not be considered for the "natural selection" by the teacher if they are done erroneously or carelessly. CONCLUDING ACTIVITIES The final designs can be enlarged and placed on a bulletin board. Students can visualize the randomness of natural selec tion over many generations. They can see small changes gradually add up to large differences in structure. The teacher can point to a drawing and ask: "While this creature has many internal gaps as its 44 ■ THE SCIENCE TEACHER FIGURE 1. The evolutionary concepts. FIGURE 2. The directional slips.</page><page sequence="4">adaptation, did any of you make it so that it would have those gaps? Did the muta tions for the gaps happen because the creature would later need them to survive the natural selection?" The class should realize that their ac tions and those of evolution are not pur poseful but can give rise to features that certainly appear to have been goal-directed.
