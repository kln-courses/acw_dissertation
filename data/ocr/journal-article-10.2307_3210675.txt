Dever N THE FIELD OF BIBLICAL STUDIES TODAY, JOURNALS, MAGAZINES, national meetings, international symposia, even the Inter- net, are awash with heated and often acrimonious discussions: Was there an "ancient" or "biblical" Israel at all? Was there even a "Bible," and whose is it? Since many of the declarations of the "revisionists" (as the radical schol- ars often call themselves) seem so absurd to mainstream scholars, and the exchange increasingly descends to the level of personal polemics, it is tempting to dismiss all this as so much "post-modern piffle"-a mere quarrel among acade- mics, one that will soon pass.1 My purpose in writing this article, however, is to argue that we should take the "revisionists" seriously, not so much because their assertions will stand the test of time, or even because their flawed methodology in itself is worrisome. Rather, we must confront the "revisionists" head-on because they are rapidly becoming ideologues; and their ideology poses a threat to biblical studies, to Syro-Palestinian archaeology, to theological and religious studies, to the life of syna- gogue and church, and even to the political situation in the Middle East. How Ideology Has Always Plagued Biblical and Syro-Palestinian Archaeology Syro-Palestinian and especially "biblical" archaeology have always been particularly subject to perversion by ide- ology. There are obvious reasons for this: They deal uniquely with the "Holy Land," which for centuries has been emo- tionally laden, not only for Jews and Christians, but for nearly all who count themselves part of the Western cultural tra- dition ("politically correct" or not). Furthermore, the current struggle for supremacy and national destiny in the Middle East-especially for control of the areas that were once ancient Palestine-has brought the protagonists to the flash-point. Whose Bible is it? Whose land is it? The whole world has a stake in the answer. It is easy to give examples of how our branches of archae- ology have been perverted by ideology. Among the most egregious examples are: (1) German and American excava- tions in the Palestine of the 1920s-1930s, which Neil Silberman has shown in Digging for God and Country (1982), were con- ducted partly out of competing nationalisms. (2) The classical "Biblical archaeology" movement of the 1920s-1950s was rife with examples of theological and pietistic biases, some Near Eastern Archaeology 61:1 (1998) 39</page><page sequence="2">of them quite crude, which shaped the archaeology of that period. Even Albright's early "scientific" excavations at Tell Beit Mirsim were published by his co-director, James L. Kelso--one of the authors of the 12-volume series The Fun- damentals (1910), which gave its name to the "Fundamentalist-Modernist" controversy--under a differ- ent title as "proving the Bible." The legendary Dame Kathleen Kenyon, who worked in Arab-held areas, was accused of being an "anti-Semitic." A few "secular fundamentalists" in Israel have leapt from the pages of the Hebrew Bible right into the trenches, such as Adam Zertal, who claims to have found "Joshua's Altar" on Mt. Ebal. In Syria, the extremely important Italian excavations at Ebla near Aleppo, directed by Paolo Matthiae, became involved in an ugly contro- versy between American biblical scholars looking for the "biblical patriarchs" and the Syrian authorities, providing a media feast. Many other scandalous examples of the intru- sion of pernicious ideologies into archaeology could be cited, from Turkey, Jordan, Cyprus, Egypt, and elsewhere in the Middle East.2 I hasten to say that the "case-studies" I have cited some- times represent only amateur work, and they certainly are exceptions; but they do provide cautionary tales. Even the dis- interested "secular and professional" Syro-Palestinian archaeology that I have advocated as separate from biblical, and theological studies is not immune from temptation. We all create our own ancient and biblical "Israels," to suit the demands of our modern situation. That is because there is no such thing as "objectivity" in archaeological, his- torical, or biblical studies. History is a "tale told for a specific purpose." Thus we construct the past that we need, partly out of what I have called "a nostalgia for a biblical world that never was." Yet the limitations on our knowledge of the past do not mean that no certain knowledge can be obtained, that nothing can be said about or learned from the past, as we shall see. The first mistake the "revisionists" make is that they state a commonplace historiographical principle as though they had invented it--all history writing is "sub- jective"-then carry it to ridiculous lengths. This is a parade example of the logical fallacy of reductio ad absurdum. Dealing With Ideology in Archaeology Most of us are aware of the insidious dangers of ideol- ogy when it is unconscious or unrestrained. But in recognizing it, how can we deal with it best? Certainly not by denying having any! For the most part, the history of Syro-Palestin- ian and "biblical" archaeology shows that many have at least tried to control ideological biases by stating "up-front" what their objectives were. Currently, the demand for "research design" in all archaeological projects makes such explicit statements of purpose even more necessary. Sometimes, how- ever, what is not said is also revealing. Thus most of us who are foreign archaeologists have scrupulously avoided involvement in print in Middle Eastern politics. For instance, in thirty-five years of working in that area I do not think that I have ever made a single statement in any publication that Three directors of national schools in 1937 (I to r): Nelson Gleuck of the American School of Oriental Research (Jerusalem), Sir Flinders Petrie of the British School of Archaeology (Egypt), and P. L. O. Guy of the British School of Archaeology (Palestine). No one would naively represent the conscious and unconscious interests of these institutions. It is impossible totally to transcend constructing the past to meet current needs. Though there is no "objectivity," that doesn't mean there is also no certain knowledge about the past.

Of course, but I try to keep them separate from my scholarship, because these views are subjective and would only interfere. Such efforts at "neutrality" are one of the best hopes for the future of archaeology in this troubled part of the world. It is immensely encouraging that despite all the local .tensions, foreign, Israeli, Jordanian, and now real "Palestin- ian" archaeologists are collaborating quietly but effectively. Yet it is precisely at this point that the "revisionists" post a threat, not only in their anti-Israel stance, but also in their charge that we archaeologists have "suppressed Palestinian history" (below). The "Post-Modern" Agenda First, we must understand what this reactionary move- ment was reacting against-in this case, late nineteenth and early twentieth century Modernism or "positivism." Among the main propositions of "positivism" were the following: (1) There are immutable and universal "laws" governing the universe and the relationships of all its parts, including, of course, human society. (2) These "laws" are objective facts and thus can be discovered by science, based on observation of the empirical evidence. (3) This modern and "positivist" way of thinking supersedes all earlier stages of thinking, such as (a) "theological/fictive," (b) "metaphysical/abstract," or (c) both "materialism" and "spiritualism." "Post-modernism," of course, must be understood as a 40 Near Eastern Archaeology 61:1 (1998)</page><page sequence="3">reaction against "positivism." Thus its main features were and are: (1) rebel- lion against all authority; (2) distrust of all universal, "totalizing" discourse; (3) the assumption that "social constructs" determine all knowledge; (4) it is only "discourse" and "realms of discourse" that matter; (5) all "truth" is relative; (6) there is no intrinsic "meaning," only that which we supply; (7) there is no oper- ative "consensus" view, so that everything becomes ideology, ultimately politics; (8) one ideology is as appropriate as another (sometimes the more "radical" the better); (9) ideological discourse need not be rational or systematic, but may be intuitive or even eccentric, representing the neglected "peripheries" of society rather than the "center."3 Such "post-modem" thinking has affected nearly all dis- ciplines since ca. 1950, both in the natural and social sciences, to such an extent that it is now taken for granted as the reign- ing paradigm. "Deconstructionism" One particular expression of "post-modernism" is a move- ment or a method called "deconstructionism." Recently, it has been prominent in literary criticism, especially in some university English and comparative literature departments, but it has also spread to other areas of the humanities, even biblical studies. "Deconstruction's" major premise, derived from its overall "post-modemrn" stance, is that texts have no intrinsic "meaning," at least none that is recoverable in the case of ancient texts, and the modem interpreter gives to the text whatever "meaning" seems appropriate in the social context of his or her own "realm of discourse," whatever the "realm" of the original author may have been. The more extreme deconstructionists even argue that the original author may not have had any specific intention (a curious conceit). Instead, the critical and sensitive reader must inquire what the author's subjective inner world was about, who the audience may have been, and what the rea- son for the particular style of discourse was. Ultimately, one must ask not what a text "signifies," but how. We can go no further; seeking a "historical context," an original mean- ing, or an agreed-upon interpretation is methodologically suspect.4 In the past decade or so, the "deconstructionist" mode of textual analysis-especially in the form of "New Literary Criticism"-has made such inroads into biblical studies that the traditional historical exegesis and criticism that have ruled for more than a century are often dismissed today as passe. Obviously, if the search for "history" and for a historically- based exegesis of texts is obsolete, the archaeology of the "biblical world" is irrelevant, if not perverse. That may explain why archaeology is neglected or at best misunderstood almost everywhere in biblical studies and theology today. "The revisonists are carrying out a classic, deliberate, single-minded 'deconstruction ist' agenda." "Post-Modern" Ideology and the "Revisionist" Agenda It is at this point that I think that we can comprehend the "revisionist" agenda in biblical studies. It is, I suggest, thinly- disguised "post-modernism," in this case specifically "deconstructionism." If the reader thinks this proposal too far-fetched, or too severe an indictment, consider the following, which are the main points that the "revisionists" them- selves have set forth-what I would call the manifesto of a movement that self-consciously portrays itself as revo- lutionary. (1) All the texts of the Hebrew Bible in its present form date to the Persian or more likely the Hellenistic era (or even as late as the first-second century CE). They are therefore "unhistorical," of little or no value for reconstructing a "bib- lical" or an "ancient Israel," both of which are simply modem Jewish and Christian literary constructs. "The Bible is not about history at all." (2) Interpretation of the biblical texts should be "liber- ated from historical considerations." It should proceed strictly on the basis of literary analysis of the Bible's "stories," which reveal mainly the "self-perception" of the narrators. (3) This radically "anti-historic movement" in the study of ancient Israelite "history" has at last brought us such "new knowledge" that it makes all other approaches obso- lete, indeed illegitimate. Those who persist in traditional approaches may be dismissed as either servants of the reli- gious establishment or simply crypto-fundamentalists. (4) Attempts to write any more histories of "Israel" should be abandoned. Instead, we should be writing "Palestinian history," which American and Israeli biblicists and archae- ologists have conspired to "suppress" because of their biblical and nationalistic biases. The quotes above are all taken directly from the current literature; and I can supply numerous other quotations from the principal spokesmen of "revisionism," like Philip R. Davies, Thomas L. Thompson, Niels Pieter Lemche, and Keith W. Whitelam.s That my paraphrase above fairly represents the "revisionist" position in general is easy to document (although, of course, this "school," like others, is not neces- sarily monolithic). I suggest simply that the reader reflect on the obviously ideological pronouncements above, then com- pare them with the "post-modern"/"deconstructionist" agenda that I have outlined above. Can there be any other background against which to portray the "revisionists" and their stated objectives? A "Revolution"? It is true that most of the revisionists have either care- fully avoided the terms "deconstruction" and "New Literary Criticism" or else have denied that the terms describe them. Near Eastern Archaeology 61:1 (1998) 41</page><page sequence="4">Nevertheless, I think that it is always instructive to pay more attention to what people actually do than to what they say or think they are doing. And in my judgment the "revi- sionists" are carrying out a classic, deliberate, single-minded "deconstructionist" agenda. It is also evident that their pro- gram is complete with all those elements that typically characterize "revolutionary" movements: (1) pretense to authoritative cre- dentials; (2) ideological manifestos; (3) polarization of viewpoints; (4) extremist rhetoric; (5) personal polemics; (6) evangelical (!) fervor; (7) apparatus for disseminating its own views; (8) pre- vailing dogmatism; and (9) utopian ideals. Readers can readily confirm these programmatic objectives by browsing through the flood of recent "revisionist" publications. If I perceive their intentions wrongly, I would welcome other readings (that is, if texts really have any "meaning"). On Ideology, Bias, and "Realms of Discourse": Some "Case-Studies" Even if my attempt here to identify the "revisionists" as "ideologues" is persuasive to some, others may protest. They could say, for instance, that (1) all scholars are in a sense ideologues, i.e., they have a position to defend; and that (2) the "revisionists"' ideology is not necessarily wrong-headed or particularly menacing. If the latter qualifications are valid, then the whole controversy is a "tempest in a teacup." But I think that there is more to it than that. Before proceeding, let me define "ideology" and "ideo- logue." The former term is often taken only in the pejorative sense, i.e., as the unacceptable bias of the "other." I use "ideology" here, however, in its proper and neutral meaning, since we all have "ideologies," or a "system of ideas," "a way of thinking."6 It should be content that determines whether a given ideology is good or bad (I do not espouse to be a relativist). By "ideologue," on the other hand, I refer to those who espouse a particular ideology, often uncritically exam- ined, to the exclusion of others, and who then become obsessed, who adopt this ideology as the basis for a revolution of one sort or another. Space prohibits more than a few specific exam- ples of how ideology typically shapes "revisionist" discourse. Philip R. Davies and the Search for "Ancient Israel" Much of the present controversy began with Philip R. Davies, of Sheffield University, in his provocative little book In Search of "Ancient Israel" (1992). Here Davies set forth the basic "revisionist" premises noted above, which became the foundation for most subsequent discussions. The casual, off-hand, sometimes outrageous style of Davies' book tempts one to dismiss it as either an example of British eccentricity (the British are "eccentric"; Americans are just plain "crazy") or perhaps intended only as a tongue-in-cheek piece for our amusement. But I suspect that Davies, with all his disarm- ing flair, is in deadly earnest: there was no "ancient" or "biblical" Israel; and the "historical Israel" that archaeology might recover in theory is beyond our reach due to archaeology's deficiencies. Yet I would point out that nowhere that I can see does Davies document the basic premise on which his statements rest-that all the literature of the Hebrew Bible Tel Dan stele: Davies and other revisionist writers have turned into contortionists trying to turn this stupendous ninth-century inscription into anything but what it is: a historical datum fixing the "house of David" and Israel into the bedrock of the Iron Age. Courtesy of Hebrew Union College-Tel Dan Excavations; photograph Zev Radovan. in its present form was composed long after the fact and thus yields no real "history." Davies has simply asserted this, neglecting to inform his readers that his is a decidedly minor- ity view, one which goes against a long tradition of mainstream biblical historical-critical scholarship, as well as many studies in oral transmission and literary production. As for archaeology's potential for writing a history of "ancient Israel," Davies rejects this as anything more than a remote possibility. Only once does he cite any of the basic archaeological handbooks-Mazar's Archaeology of the Land of the Bible 10,000-586 B.C.E. (1990)-merely to dismiss it as irrelevant, since Mazar ends with the Iron Age in Palestine and does not cover Davies' "biblical world" in the Persian- Hellenistic period. Davies does not even cite Helga Weippert's Pallistina im vorhellenistischer Zeit [Palestine in the Pre-Hellenistic Era] (1988), which, although only a handbook, is the single work lionized by Thompson and other "revisionists." Together these two fundamental sources contain some 700 pages of detailed presentation of archaeological data on the Iron Age. If this complex, or archaeological assemblage, is not "Israelite," what is it? An even more egregious example of Davies' tailoring the evidence to fit his presuppositions is his notorious attempt (along with others) to discredit the recently discovered ninth century BCE inscription from Tel Dan in northern Israel. The inscription mentions the "house of David" and a "king of Israel," a king we can now identify as Jehoram, ca. 840 BCE. Davies, however, refuses to take the Dan inscription seriously as a historical datum-in this case one that would effectively contradict his assertion that there were no early Iron Age 42 Near Eastern Archaeology 61:1 (1998)</page><page sequence="5">Israelite and Judean "states." But Thompson (below) has gone so far as to imply that the inscription is a forgery, a hoax "planted" on an unsuspecting dig director, the venerable Avra- ham Biran. Several other "revisionists" have turned amusing intellectual somersaults to avoid the obvious meaning (!) of the Dan inscription. The irony is that biblical scholars have long demanded that we archaeologists supplement our "mute" artifacts with texts. But what do they do when we find a spec- tacular text? They discard it. More recently, Davies has alleged that our most secure ancient Hebrew monumental inscrip- tion-the famous Hezekiah tunnel inscription, dated to the siege of Sennacherib in 701 BCE (2 Chron 32:1-5)-is a Has- moneaan/Hellenistic work of the second century BCE, in effect a "fraud" as used by epigraphers and paleographers (Roger- son and Davies 1997). As for "biblical" Hebrew, Davies regards this as a Bil- dungssprache, an artificial "literary" language that was invented by the late scribes who wrote the Bible. He ignores the fact that we have hundreds, probably thousands, of ostraca, inscriptions on stone, inscribed pots, seals, and seal-impres- sions from well dated tenth-sixth century BCE contexts, in precisely this "non-existent" Iron Age Hebrew. What is one to make of all this, unless we suppose that we are dealing here with ideological pronouncements, rather than with hon- est, competent, fully documented scholarship?7 At least Davies' bias is obvious, and he has recently defended it: he is resolutely anti-theological. Here, I might agree with Davies, since one can easily show, as I shall do below, that theology constitutes a separate quest and must be clearly distinguished from historical and archaeological inquiries, which have different motivations (Dever 1996c; compare, ironically, Davies 1997). But it appears to me that Davies is largely reacting against his own fundamentalist background. Thomas L. Thompson and the "New Historiography" Another of the current "revisionists," Thomas L. Thomp- son, actually set out on this path, although apparently not deliberately, many years ago with his iconoclastic work, The Historicity of the Patriarchal Narratives (1974), a radical attack on Albright and his school. An "outsider" for many years, never accepted by the religious establishment, Thomp- son has finally ended up in Denmark on the faculty of the Institute of Biblical Exegesis, Copenhagen University with Lemche (below). In a very defensive piece recently in the Journal of Biblical Literature (1995), Thompson describes him- self as "a Joycean Catholic Irish-American emigree" and as a "Neo-Albrightian." However, the first characterization helps us only to account for Thompson's polemical and often obtuse writing-style; and the latter is patently absurd.8 Thompson's real point of departure is revealed in com- ments elsewhere in this article. He is "strongly influenced by the political, ideological, and religious turmoil of the late 1960s"; 1968 was the year that meant "denying authority to old opinions and institutions which are no longer able to present a decent argument in favor of their continued exis- tence." Thompson and the other "revisionists" are committed rather to Wissenschaft (or scientific knowledge), in this case partly a real theology that can be illustrated (as Lemche says also) by a quote from Schiller: "For some it (religion) is a matter of heavenly deities; for others it is the efficient cow, who provides them with butter and milk." Thomp- son (and, I suppose, others) "never gave up the hope that we could do something positive for this world." Somehow, all this does little to reassure me on the issue of social constructionism; and political activism hardly provides the most fruitful orientation to the "objective and critical" study of the biblical texts that Thompson claims to be doing. On the other hand, such an orientation-complete with the utopian ideal--does characterize "post-modernism" generally, and the biblical "deconstructionists" in particular. Can one be forgiven for suggesting that there may be a connection here? The issue, however, is whether or not Thompson's ide- ological agenda, or ours, has adversely affected scholarship. I think that in Thompson's case it has, both in method and in results. Positing in Thompson's work a "revolutionary" ideology explains many things, such as his exaggerations. Among them are the following statements. (1) There were no real "cities" in the Bronze Age Palestinian heartland. (2) Archaeology "cannot distinguish" Israelite from Canaanite culture. (3) Albright's "Canaanites" existed only "in his head." (4) In the Iron I period (twelfth-eleventh centuries BCE), the notion of an "indigenous Israel...is historically meaning- less." (5) "The Bible is not history, and only recently has anyone ever wanted it to be." (6) "The Bible's stories about Saul and David are no more factual than the tales of King Arthur." (7) There was no Judean "state" until the seventh century BCE, because "only a few dozen villagers lived as farmers in all the Judaean highlands." (8) "The very exis- tence of an 'exilic' period...is open to serious challenge." (9) The concept of "Israel" was a literary and theological cre- ation of the Persian, if not the Hellenistic, period. (10) Our "new knowledge" proves that the Hebrew Bible is a late, "Jewish construct." (11) There was no "Judaism" until the second century CE, and claims to the contrary are "literary fiction."9 Such exaggerations-which I can easily multiply-will no doubt be defended by Thompson, as in past, by coun- tering they are quotations taken out of context, or simply part of Thompson's deliberately provocative style of debate. Nevertheless, this is irresponsible scholarship-simply ideological rhetoric, with no attempt at documentation or a well balanced presentation that might enlighten the reader. Another aspect of Thompson's ideology is his misrepre- sentation or suppression of the views of those who would oppose him. Typical of numerous examples are, for instance, Thompson's charges against me. From the beginning, he says, I have really been an old-fashioned, Albrightian "biblical archaeologist" (despite my much-publicized opposition to this kind of archaeology for twenty-five years). I have dis- torted archaeological evidence by using it to prove the "historicity of the Biblical Patriarchs" (although in fact I wrote to oppose Near Eastern Archaeology 61:1 (1998) 43</page><page sequence="6">this twenty years ago). Others have argued for the method- ological separation of Bible, archaeology, and the history of ancient Palestine, but I have uncritically combined them; my "project has always been the relationship asserted by biblical and Christian fundamentalism" (i.e., between Bible and archae- ology). I have "never recognized the methodological and historical issues that were involved." I and other archaeolo- gists "only visit ideas." As proof of my "biblical bias" is the fact that I went to Gezer in 1%7 deliberately to find a "Solomonic" city gate, where we pulled out large in situ stones and rolled them down the hill, suppressing this evidence in our reports. And "when it came to questions of chronology and the gate itself, all pottery discrepancies were consciously dis- carded prior to recording." Thompson says that I refuse to address the issue that the "revisionists" raise, that my "ancient Israel (is) a scholarly figment, rather than the goal of cur- rent research," a "harmonistic scenario" with which to wed my "own hardly independently derived phantasms." "Dever's methods...have little to do with archaeology." Mine is "his- tory by committee"; "not history at all"; "wholly bereft of method." By contrast, the "revisionists'" separation of archae- ological and historical pursuits is "a hard-won gain that has been accepted by all but fundamentalists." My few recent attempts to counter Thompson's absurd and slanderous charges are dismissed as seeking "credit for initiating the now dominant historiographical develop- ment in our (sic) field which understands archaeology and the history of the southern Levant as independent disci- plines," or at worse simply "acrimonious debate and ad hominem attacks." I and others who are finally compelled to expose the blatant ideology are said to be introducing irrel- evant issues such as questions of competence and integrity, and even of faith and morality. Thompson simply labels us obstructionists who stand in the way of acceptance of the New Truth that will soon triumph and will resolve the "historio- graphical crisis" that many have acknowledged. The "newer archaeology" that will support this historiographical break- through is not according to Thompson a view that I and other archaeologists have developed. Rather, it is the work of bib- lical scholars whom I do not even cite ("a form of Harvard censorship"), such as G. Ahlstr6m, E. A. Knauf, N. P. Lem- che, J. M. Miller, J. Van Seters, and of course Thompson himself (never mind that I have cited and discussed all in detail). These scholars are not "ideologues" or "radicals," their crit- ics are. They are not "skeptics" about the history of ancient Israel, but their opponents are "maximalists" or "credulists." They are embattled protagonists for Wissenschaft, "scientific historical knowledge," the New Truth. What is the fair-minded reader to make of all this ful- mination? Let me suggest that Thompson's writing, as in the other voluminous literature being spewed forth by this vocal minority, bears all the classic hallmarks of the "ideologue": (1) the claim to be a "voice from the margin"; (2) unmasking others' ideology, while denying their own; (3) "liberation" rhetoric; (4) the deliberate intent to overthrow the Estab- lishment and to repudiate its "power to sanction"; (5) dogmatic The Iron Age gate at Gezer, excavated under my direction. Beautifully preserved, the dating of the gate is a matter of intense, professional archaeological dispute that distinguishes itself from the innuendo and false representation of views that constitute the revisonists' "critique." These include slanderous charges that the excavation yanked out in situ boulders and discarded discrepant ceramics in order to arrive at a preconceived Solomonic dating of the structure. Photograph courtesy of the author. assertions with little documentation; (6) caricatures of the views of opponents; (7) claims to have discovered a New Truth, without, however, telling us how and why they have repudiated their own former "truth"; and (8) revolu- tionary slogans and then claims to have won the victory already. Keith W. Whitelam and the Invention of Ancient Israel A more recent convert to "revisionism" is Keith W. White- lam of the University of Stirling in Scotland, who had earlier collaborated with Robert B. Coote on an innovative settle- ment-history of ancient Palestine entitled The Emergence of Early Israel in Historical Perspective (1987). This foray into archaeology was followed by Whitelam in several pro- grammatic statements on "early Israel" on his own. Then in late 1996 there appeared a full-scale work, The Invention of Ancient Israel: The Silencing of Palestinian History. Whitelam's basic thesis is similar to that of Davies (1992) and Thompson (1992), except for one twist. Not only have scholars been pre- occupied with reconstructing an imaginary "ancient Israel," but American and Israeli biblicists and archaeologists have at the same time conspired to deprive the modern Pales- tinians of their history. Whitelam's main arguments are: (1) that both archaeol- ogy and biblical studies have conspired to "usurp Palestinian history"; and (2) that the conspiracy results from the biases of European and American scholarship regarding an "ancient Israel," as well as the program of Zionism coupled with mod- em Israeli archaeology. According to Whitelam (with Davies, Lemche, and Thompson), "the 'ancient Israel' of biblical studies is a scholarly construct based upon a misreading of the biblical tradition and divorced from historical reality." 44 Near Eastern Archaeology 61:1 (1998)</page><page sequence="7">The result of the preoccupation with an "Israel" has been that "in effect, Pales- tinian history, particularly for the thirteenth century BCE to the second cen- tury CE, has not existed except as the backdrop to the histories of Israel and Judah or of Second Temple Judaism" (1996:2) As proof of this bias, Whitelam asserts that recent Israeli archaeological sur- veys of the West Bank have been "heavily influenced by biblical scholarship and the all-consuming search for 'ancient Israel'." These are research strategies that have "invented and located Israel in the Late Bronze-Iron Age transition and early Iron Age." The surveys "are also an expression of a claim to the land by the mapping and conceptualization of that land." Biblical studies and Israeli archaeological scholarship have "dis- possessed Palestinians of a land and a past." The "new paradigm" in both dis- ciplines must be to rediscover the "Palestinians" in the Iron Age and even in the Bronze Age; all who oppose that agenda are "distracting" us from the proper objectives of scholarship (White- lam 1996). Here the sensitive reader will see red flags all over the place; but let me suggest only the chief misgivings that I have about Whitelam.10 Unsubstantiated Charges. Whitelam does not document any of his charges against Israeli (and other) archaeolo- gists. That archaeologists, Israeli or others, are not "objective," that they too are conditioned by their social context, is a tru- ism. But Whitelam would need to give some specific "case-histories" to show how a connection with the Bible or the land of the Bible has adversely influenced scholarly con- clusions. For instance, Whitelam castigates Finkelstein in particular as one of the leading Israeli archaeologists who carried out the West Bank surveys, charging him with using this research to create an "early Israel" and to validate mod- ern Israeli claims to these territories. Whitelam does not inform his readers that: (1) Since 1991 (even earlier, in Hebrew), Finkelstein has repudiated the use of the label "Israelite" or even my "Proto-Israelite" for the twelfth-eleventh century BCE hill country archaeological assemblage that he himself did so much to place on our settlement map; (2) Finkel- stein does not belong to the political right in Israel, which defends the modern settlements, but is strongly affiliated with the opposition on the far left; and finally (3) Finkel- stein-like all the Israeli archaeologists-is a secularist whose work is entirely separated from programs of biblical and reli- gious studies at every level, and who is adamantly opposed to the religious establishment in Israel. Finkelstein's current negative views on "Israelite ethnicity" do indeed pose some serious problems, which is why he and I are constantly engaged in con- troversy in print (Dever 1995b and Finkelstein 1996, 1998). But these are strictly archaeological disputes-not ideological, nationalistic, religious, or personal, much less biblical. They have to do with legitimate professional dif- ferences in interpretation. And here, Whitelam, not being an archaeologist of any sort, really has no credentials that would entitle him to enter the debate. Bogus Archaeology. The latter point leads me to the second problem that I have with Whitelam's ideology: his appeal to archaeology is bogus. The fail- ure here lies in the fact that Whitelam has no experience in fieldwork; no first- hand acquaintance with the material culture of ancient Palestine (or for that matter, his "Palestine") and its inter- pretation; and only superficial and secondary knowledge of the critical lit- erature. Furthermore, if Whitelam wishes to complain of scholarly "usurpation," let him confront his own hubris in claim- ing that he and other European biblicists must now take up the burden of the "neglected history of ancient Palestine." Where has he been? We archaeologists have been doing precisely that history for nearly 150 years now! Are he and the other "revisionist" biblical historians better equipped for this task? Are they better equipped than the real "Palestini- ans," who now have their own Department of Archaeology in the new Palestinian Authority and have no need for out- siders like Whitelam to patronize them or to write their history. Some of these Palestinians are already collaborating with American, Israeli, and Jordanian archaeologists to write a history of ancient Palestine in all periods, not just that of the Israelite monarchy (but see below). Anti-Semitism? Finally, several of Whitelam's statements border dangerously on anti-Semitism; they are certainly anti- Jewish and anti-Israel. There is a dear bias here, as early critics have pointed out, on the part of a scholar who has written perceptively and sensitively about a real "ancient Israel" in the past." What has happened to convert Whitelam to "revi- sionism"? Is it possible that isolation from Jewish scholarship in Europe, or a pacifist Quaker background, effected White- lam's more recent works, even if subconsciously? Perhaps, but in any case, other critics on the horizon will be less char- itable. These critics will charge (and perhaps document) "anti-Semitism"; others will be outraged and will come to Near Eastern Archaeology 61:1 (1998) 45 Sampson and Delila, in an "orientalizing" style, adorn the cover of Keith Whitelam's The Invention of Ancient Israel (1996). The volume has caused a furor primarily because of its ideological agenda, but its argument is also riddled by unsubstantiated claims and second-hand archaeology. The net result of Whitelam's publication will be widening polarization within the discipline and profitless distraction from the crucial tasks of archaeological research.</page><page sequence="8">the defense of the "revisionists." Thus our several disciplines are likely to be further polarized and isolated by the acri- monious discussions of what are essentially non-issues. I choose to believe that Whitelam did not consciously intend to precipitate such a furor. But that is what he has done; and it is not just his scholarship that is at fault, but also and principally his ideological agenda. Already, as we shall see, Whitelam's rhetoric has been seized upon by a few Arab archaeologists seeking to politicize Palestinian (and Israeli) archaeology (below). William G. Dever: Archaeology and History Writing Having sought to expose others' ideology, I should be candid about my own, although it should be clear to anyone who has read my writing over the past thirty years. I was raised as a Christian, have two seminary degrees, and for a time was an ordained minister. Now I am nomi- nally Jewish, in the sense of identifying more with that tradition, that is, with the Hebrew Bible and with ancient Israel. But, after pondering the issues for a lifetime, my intel- lectual position is now closer to that of secular humanism. Although I studied theology throughout graduate school, I have long been convinced that theology and belief cannot be, indeed should not be, truly "historical," much less hope to find confirmation in archaeological discoveries. Thus, like Davies (and many others in our disciplines), I am deter- mined to keep theological issues out of the study of ancient Israel and Palestine. I try to read the Bible exactly as I read any other ancient Near Eastern text, i.e., not as "Scripture," but as a partial, though limited source of data for writing history. I do regard the Hebrew Bible (parts of it) as a possible source of morals and ethical behavior and as one of the most funda- mental sources of the Western cultural tradition; but such issues must be kept separate at this point. I have been consistent over thirty years in calling for a "secular, professional Syro-Palestinian archaeology" that is separate and entirely free from issues of biblical interpreta- tion, as "objective" as possible, but fully aware of its limitations. If I have a "bias" here, it is against any kind of archaeology that is dilettantish, pretentious, or politicized.12 If anyone can demonstrate that my own "social construct of knowledge" as outlined above has made me a dishonest scholar or an ideologue, I will accept that challenge. Mean- while, I will continue to be a passionate advocate of archaeology as a proper and valuable source for history writing, in line with mainstream archaeology today. I am also committed, as I have been from the beginning, to a fruitful dialogue between biblical and archaeological studies: it is our only hope for writing a comprehensive, balanced, satisfying history of ancient Israel. My dissatisfaction with the "revisionists," my determi- nation to oppose them, is precisely because I am convinced that they neither understand nor care about Syro-Palestin- ian archaeology, ancient Israel, or the interdisciplinary dialogue that I envision. It is in that sense that I suggest that they really are "nihilists": their radical undercutting of more traditional approaches to the Hebrew Bible and the history of ancient Israel, pursued to the end, results in nothing-except ideol- ogy. So far the ideology of the "revisionists" has not been subjected to critical attack, except in an article by Iain Provan in a recent issue of the highly respected Journal of Biblical Literature. Provan rightly characterizes them as "ide- ologues," but he is absolutely wrong in thinking that the "revisionists" are "materialists" or "positivists"--quite the contrary (as Thompson [1995] in the same issue correctly points out). It is we archaeologists who are materialists, in the proper sense of studying material culture; and "positivists," not in the older sense, but in that we are opposed to "mini- malists" who can say little or nothing about the past. The "revisionists," of course, will doubtless reject the term nihilist; but let them show us what is left in their wake. Curi- ously enough, the "revisionists" are so out of date in literary theory that they do not know that their sort of "decon- struction" in English Literature and Comparative Literature departments has been recognized as essentially nihilist. Accordingly, many such departments have now moved on in search of something called "neo-pragmatism." And even in biblical studies, the latest critical essays have cau- tioned us about the limitations of all "post-modem" approaches, such as structuralism, New Literary Criticism, or feminist and other "liberation" criticism.13 A Key Issue: "Ethnicity" Many of the issues brought to a head by "revisionist" ide- ology have been noted above, but none is more critical or urgent than that of "ethnicity." On the one hand, the "revi- sionists" one and all deny that anything like "ethnic identity" can be recognized in the archaeological record, so there can be no talk of an "early Israel" (the biblical texts are discounted, of course). On the other hand, virtually all archaeologists do recognize, and indeed characterize in some detail, "Canaan- ites," "Egyptians," "Philistines," and, of course, "Israelites" in the well known succession of material cultures of the Late Bronze-Iron Ages of ancient Palestine (ca. 1500-600 BCE). Some may question the appropriateness of my cautionary term "Proto-Israelite" for the twelfth-eleventh century BCE highland assemblage.14 But all Syro-Palestinian archaeolo- gists proceed on the assumption that material culture in general reflects ethnicity (among other things), and that "eth- nic labels" where attested by textual evidence are permissible, indeed necessary, in proper historical method. The specific issue here, of course, is whether an "early Israel," or even an "Israel of the monarchy," ever really existed, and, if so, whether archaeology can attest to it. The "revi- sionists" simply beg the question by denying the validity of the term "ethnicity" itself, then by declaring that in any case archaeology cannot identify anything so nebulous in mater- ial culture remains. Thus Lemche (1991:51-52) declares: "The Canaanites did not know that they were Canaanites." Thomp- son (1997) informs us that archaeology "cannot distinguish" Israelite from Canaanite culture. Lester Grabbe (1997:17) states categorically: "Markers of ethnicity are simply not present 46 Near Eastern Archaeology 61:1 (1998)</page><page sequence="9">100 7 150 200 00 Mediterranean Izbet Sartah 150 Gezer Sea Miqne / Dead 100 Sea Arad 'Ar6'er Qitmit 50 o miles 10 0 k 10 Haseva Neighboring sites within the same environmental niche manifest distinctive and contempora- neous material cultures-from ceramics to architecture. Since the appellations exist within the literature of the period, are not archaeologists and historians justified in labeling these material cultures with their ethnic names? In the twelfth-century Shephelah, these would be Philistine, Canaanite, and Israelite; in the seventh-century Negev, Judaite, and Edomite. in the artifactual finds, and there is nothing in the archaeol- ogy of the highlands to distinguish it from other regions." I could multiply these statements of self-styled "experts" in Syro-Palestinian archaeology many times over. But are these statements of fact-or ideologically-driven pro- nouncements? Are we not justified in suspecting that no archaeological evidence of an "early Israel" can be admit- ted, because the "revisionists" are ideologically committed to the proposition that there cannot have been an "ancient Israel"? Don't confuse them with facts: their minds are made up (ironically, not unlike the Fundamentalists they decry so furiously). Archaeology and "Ethnicity" What are the "facts" about ethnicity in the archaeologi- cal record of the Iron I and II periods? Let me take only one of many examples in each period where archaeological data attest to ethnicity beyond any reasonable doubt. Three Contemporaneous Neighboring Sites In the twelfth century BCE there are at least three well excavated sites, within less than twenty miles of each other and in a single homogeneous ecological niche, that pro- vide a striking exhibition of the diverse, multi-cultural ethnicity of this region of Iron in Palestine. These sites are: Gezer: "Canaanite." 'Izbet Sartah: "Proto-Israelite." Tel Miqne/Ekron: "Philistine" Here I cannot describe in detail the material culture of each of these "type-sites" and can only refer the open- minded reader to the literature, easily accessible but apparently unknown to the "revisionists." The salient point is simply that in each of the three puta- tive "ethnic" categories to which in have assigned the sites there are character- istic, typical, and indispensable material culture differences. There are, of course, many universal "Iron I" material traits that are common to all sites simply because they are universal in this period, such as typical cooking pots spring- ing off the local Late Bronze II repertoire. It is the clear-cut and consistent differ- ences from site to site, however, that are diagnostic of cultural and thus of "eth- nic" identity. These differences include: site-type; settlement plan; house-forms; technology; subsistence; social orga- nization; ceramic repertoire; religion and ideology; and even, one might argue, language, the latter surely an "ethnic marker." Gezer (Dever 1993) is a large urban tell-sites that still strongly exhibits the centuries-old, well known "Canaanite" Bronze Age culture. It has very little Philistine Bichrome pottery or any other new cultural traits of the early Iron I period, and if Gezer was eth- nically "Canaanite" earlier, it is still. To the north of Gezer, cIzbet Sartah stands in sharp con- trast. It is a tiny unwalled village, established de novo in the late thirteenth/early twelfth century BCE and abandoned by about 1,000 BCE (Finkelstein 1986). It features distinctive "four- room" or "'courtyard" houses that will soon characterize many sites of the Iron II or Israelite monarchical period (ideal farmhouses); numerous stone-lined silos for storing agri- cultural surpluses; and typical local Late Bronze-Iron I ceramic forms. Its assemblage contains no imports but an increase in local utilitarian forms like large "collar-rim" storejars (completely absent at Gezer). The picture one gets is that of an isolated farm village, reflecting a single kin-based rather .than the stratified entrepreneurial society typical of urban centers. An ostracon inscribed with an abecedary in Old Canaanite script may indicate attempts to adapt this script to early Hebrew. And, if biblical texts are not arbitrarily ruled out, we may tentatively identify cIzbet Sartah with the "Ebenezer" of the Battle of Aphek in 1 Samuel 4, the text of Near Eastern Archaeology 61:1 (1998) 47</page><page sequence="10">/ Gezer's granary: This twelfth-century public storage of grain contrasts decisively with the ubiquity of grain pits surrounding the contemporaneous farmstead of Clzbet Sartah, implying individual family storage of grain.

Finkelstein. 0 o50 which suits the terrain and the geopolitical character of this area of the northern Shephelah admirably. Tel Miqne, securely identified with the Philistine site of Ekron known from the Bible and other texts, has been exten- sively excavated (Dothan 1989). The large Bronze Age mound (forty acres) undergoes a major change in the late thir- teenth/early twelfth century BCE, after which it exhibits a new material culture with overwhelmingly Mycenaean fea- tures. The evidence is clear in a monumental megaron-like building with a "hearth sanctuary"; in many distinctive items like incised scapulae and composite iron daggers that have exact Cypriote and Mycenaean parallels; in Anatolian- style kraters and cooking pots; and, above all, in enormous quantities of both imported Late Mycenaean III C:lb mono- chrome wares and later, locally made "Philistine" bichrome wares. Tel Miqne/Ekron is thus indisputably a "Philistine" site, where the archaeological and biblical data converge. To emphasize the distinctions in only one regard, "Canaan- ite" Gezer-only about seven miles distant as the crow flies-has not produced among the many thousands of twelfth century BCE sherds examined over the years a single diag- nostic Late Mycenaean III C:lb sherd. Are such material culture variations among nearby sites merely coincidental, or are they significant for defining "ethnic" differences among local groups? I suggest confidently that there can be no other expla- nation for the observable distinctions in the archaeological record in this case. Chronological explanations carry no weight since all three sites we are presenting as "case-studies" are exactly contemporary. An "ecological" model will not clar- ify matters, since all three sites are in precisely the same ecological zone, the northern Shephelah. This is a "micro niche" that is characterized throughout by the same soil and water resources, the same defensive locations, the same access to communication routes-all variables that would likely prove decisive if techno-environmental factors could explain the observable cultural differences here. Nor could the "revi- sionists" defend their nihilist position by admitting that a sense of "ethnicity" might have existed, and that it differed from site to site, but no specific "labels" can be applied. In this case, all the "ethnic labels" I suggested are attested in contemporary and non-biblical texts, even the term "Israelite" (on Merneptah's stele; see Hasel 1994). Northeastern Negev in the Iron II A second "case-study" has to do with the Iron II period and with other known ethnic groups. In another homoge- nous ecological zone, the northeastern Negev/Arabah valley, the following sites might be considered: Arad and &lt;Ar68er; Horvat Qitmit, and (En Haseva. Judean Sites. Arad and Ar&amp;er, both extensively excavated, have produced seventh century BCE remains that even the most extreme "revisionists" would have to concede are Judean.15 In addition to typically Judean settlement type, architecture, pottery, shekel-weights, pillar-base figurines, and other diagnostic items, Arad and CAr&amp;er have produced Hebrew ostraca (dozens at Arad). These sites, and scores more, constitute a distinct political, socio-economic, and cul- tural region, with clear archaeologically defined borders, an entity that is denoted as "Judah" in both biblical and extra- biblical texts. If there is a seventh century BCE "Judah," there are ethnic "Judeans" (Kletter 1996). Unique Ceramics. Only a few miles to the east and southeast of Arad and &lt;Ar86er are the sites of Horvat Qit- mit and (En Haseva.

The ceramic vessels recovered consist principally of hundreds of fragments of "exotic" anthropomorphic, zoomorphic, and other cult vessels. All of these vessels are unique and do not find any parallels even at nearby Judean sites such as CAro)er and Arad (six to ten miles dis- tant). The "Edomite" character of this pottery is confirmed, even though it occurs west of the Arabah valley and the sup- posed borders of ancient Edom, by quantities of pottery similar to that of southern Transjordan; by an inscribed seal in Edomite script; and especially by ostraca and pottery stands found at the site, some sherds mentioning the well known Edomite deity "Q6s." (En Haseva is a small fort some twenty-five miles farther south in the Aravah (Cohen and Yisrael 1995, 1996). It has architecture that overlaps with that of Judah, such as an ear- lier three-entryway gate, and also some standard Judean pottery. By Stratum 4, however, of the late seventh century BCE (contemporary with Qitmit), (En Haseva apparently became an Edomite city. A large assemblage of seventy- five ceramic vessels of cultic character, found in a pit, parallels the repertoire of Qitmit quite closely. It matches no other assemblage. Again, we have textual evidence for the pres- ence of "Edomites" at "En Haseva in a seal inscribed in Edomite script, as well as in the distinctive non-Judean iconogra- phy of the cult vessels and stands. Why do the "revisionists" not cite the foregoing evidence, even in their latest denials of archaeologically attested "eth- nicity?" Are they not obligated to give both sides of the argument? Once again, they are either ignorant of the fun- damental data, or they wish to keep their readers ignorant. Near Eastern Archaeology 61:1 (1998) 49</page><page sequence="12">In neither case do they qualify as honest scholars, operating with commonly accepted historical methods. Their pro- nouncements on "ethnicity" are purely ideological, part and parcel of their nihilist views of biblical history, of early Israel, and even of Israel's neighbors. "Revisionism" and Middle Eastern Politics if the reader thinks I am raising false alarms about the "revisionists'" latest forays into the area of ethnicity, consider for instance a recent paper of Thompson entitled "Hidden Histories and the Problem of Ethnicity in Palestine." This was read at a meeting in Amman, Jordan in 1996. Was this a representative international scholarly symposium? And why Amman? I suggest that Thompson, who is so outspo- kenly anti-Israel throughout his work, is now pandering to pro-Palestinian elements. In his latest articles, he refuses even to use the name "Israel," speaking instead of "Southern Syria," or "the Southern Levant." He argues that there was no ancient "Judaism" until late in the Roman period. And his Bible- bashing has now gone to the extent of spelling Bible as "bible"-reminiscent of the "Amerika" of the Berkeley anti- war movement (1998a, 1998b). Are these antics of Thompson not evidence of an ideological agenda? Still more disturbing is the fact that in the past few months Palestinian activists, some of them archaeologists connected with the new Palestinian Authority, have apparently adopted Whitelam's Silencing of Palestinian History as their Bible. The Jerusalem Post of October 11, 1997 carried a story about such Palestinians, who have written a history of Palestine for school textbooks and distribution on the Internet that all but eliminates any reference to Israel, ancient or modern, in the long history of Palestine. Their "Palestine" is Judenfrei. The Zionists whom Whitelam castigates have no place in this Palestine, no historical claim to it. No matter how the "revisionists" may attempt to dis- tance themselves from this latest, racist perversion of archaeology and history, they are culpable. Theirs is irresponsible "schol- arship," inflammatory rhetoric. They must be held accountable. Conclusion Among the principal contentions of the "revisionists" are these. There are no "objective facts"; all our observations are "theory-laden"; knowledge is "subjective" because it is socially conditioned. Precisely. Such epistemological presuppositions, however, are not new, are in fact banal. Nor do they carry the revolutionary implications that the "revisionists" seem to think. They certainly do not mean that all becomes ideology, politics. The fact is that we all have "ideologies," most of them with political connotations. The goal should be not to elim- inate such ideologies, since that is impossible, but to try to unmask them in ourselves and others. Only that way can we deprive ideologies of their power to create in us bias, cant, and demagoguery. It has been said that an ideologue at best is "a person pre- occupied mainly with ideas; mainly with ideas" (see note 6). Two bearded, robed figures stand before a horned altar on this engraved stamp seal (22 mm in diameter) from cEn Haseva. The Edomite script identifies the seal's owner: "belonging to mskt son of whzm." As at Horvat Qitmit, epigraphic data in combination with elements of distinctive material culture identify an ethnic presence at CEn Haseva. Courtesy of the Israel Antiquities Authority. The problem lies not in having ideas, even utopian dreams, but in basing them on illusions rather than on facts. There really is an "objective world out there to be known," and some secure knowledge to be obtained of it, provided that we eschew hostility toward the past that we say we wish to understand, abandon simple-minded slogans that only polarize the discussion, and desist from sensationalist polemics. Apprehending the reality of ancient Israel, in particular, requires an empathetic insight into all sources, not puffed- up science.
