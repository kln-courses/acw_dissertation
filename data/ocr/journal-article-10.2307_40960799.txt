<plain_text><page sequence="1">36 Cult activities at the Palace of Knossos from the end of the Bronze Age: continuity and change Mieke Prent Apart from being the seat of Minoan palace civilisat- ion, Crete has often been noted as an island whose Early Iron Age and later culture was characterised by a re- markable degree of continuity of Bronze Age traits and customs. Observations along this line can be found in the works of scholars from Aristotle {Pol 1271 b3i), who pointed to the survival of "the laws of Minos" among the island's inhabitants, to the present day. Mod- ern scholars, beginning with Arthur Evans, have called attention to deep-rooted patterns of continuity, which characterise many aspects of the island's material and immaterial culture, though perhaps most of all its reli- gion (Evans 1894, 359; Hall 1928, 267; Willetts 1962, 38; Snodgrass 1971, 42, 401; Desborough 1972, 334-5; Coldstream 1991, 289; Morris 1998, 59, 63). Crete is famous for the longevity of its Bronze Age sanctuaries, such as the Idaian cave and Kato Symi, where cult ac- tivities continued into Roman times. Such sanctuaries, as Nilsson already had observed, present a favourable environment for the survival of elements of Bronze Age cult, in some cases even of the deity with his or her original name (Nilsson 1950, 457). Crete has preserved the names and epithets of several pre-Greek deities, such as Diktynna and Britomartis and the epithet Diktaios for Zeus (Willetts 1962). It is not my intention to question the strength of the continuity of Bronze Age cult traditions in Crete;1 but it is clear that the term "continuity" needs clarifica- tion. Relatively little attention has been paid so far to the different processes and mechanisms that would have been involved in the maintenance of older cult tradi- tions in the island.2 This presents somewhat of a con- trast with recent studies focusing on other parts of the Greek world, in which interrelated concepts of conti- nuity, rediscovery and revival have been refined con- siderably (Snodgrass 1971, 396-7, 399; De Polignac 1994, 8-9). Particularly relevant for Crete is the recog- nition that continuity of cult practice at a site does not necessarily mean lack of change in that practice, and certainly cannot be taken to imply a constancy of mean- ing (Renfrew 1985, 3). Even in an island commonly known for the strength of its continuity with the Bronze Age past, some variation will have occurred in the ap- preciation and application of that past both through time and in different social environments. The role of older, Bronze Age cult traditions may have ranged from residual, unarticulated influence, to active preservation and rediscovery and reuse after a period of no interest and neglect. In this paper I shall try to illustrate some of these variations by focusing on the evidence for cult activi- ties at the site of the Palace of Knossos from the later parts of the Bronze Age onward. Three sanctuaries, founded in LM IIIB, LM IIIC and PG respectively (FIG. 36.1), testify to the idea that the Palace, even after its destruction, continued to occupy a special position for the inhabitants of the surrounding settlement. As first noted by Evans, the fact that traces of Geometric occupation existed immediately around, but not within, the Palace area implies a conscious avoidance of later habitation in this area (Evans 1904, 51, 1928, 7, 346, n. 1; Coldstream 2000, 288, 298). In Evans's mind, there could be little doubt that the memory of the Minoan Palace - in its capacity of "Central Sanctuary of the Minoan Goddess" - had been faithfully kept alive through the centuries. However, the three sanctuaries just mentioned display sufficient differences in form, location and in associated votives as to suggest differ- ent functions and different audiences for each period. A century of British archaeological research in and around the Palace allows us to refine the picture pre- sented by Evans. Thanks to ongoing excavations in set- tlement and cemeteries, the later cult activities at the site of the Palace can now be placed in a wider social 1 S. Morris (1992, 183) argues for instance that Minoan elements in the material and literary culture of Crete have been exag- gerated for romantic and political reasons. I deal with this is- sue in more detail in Sanctuaries and Cults in Crete from the Late Minoan IIIC to the Archaic period: Continuity and Change, PhD diss. (2003), University of Amsterdam. 2 Important exceptions are case studies by J. N. Coldstream (e. g. 1996) on the adoption of Bronze Age motifs and customs in the EIA North Cemetery of Knossos, A. Lebessi (1981) on patterns of survival and revival in the sanctuary at Kato Symi, and L. Nixon (1990), who discusses EIA sanctuaries at Cretan Bronze Age settlements as a more general phenomenon.</page><page sequence="2">412 MIEKEPRENT cemetery / 'j -^ ( [If i ^"^ / IV eia town I [rô ( f / y acrop°'|s )i y ^^üiiiied ^stf^ .' ^' j f ' ' [(( lower gypsadeé ' ^ l ]V' / / Fig. 36.1.

In addition, an impression may now be gained of the changes in local appreciation of the Bronze Age past as visibly represented by the ruins of the Palace. THE LATE MINOAN IIIB SHRINE OF THE DOUBLE AXES In LM IIIB there was a small bench sanctuary, called the "Shrine of the Double Axes" by Evans, in the south- east quarter of the Palace (FIG. 3Ó.2).3 It contained pot- tery, a steatite double axe, a plaster tripod offering ta- ble, two pairs of horns of consecration, one male and three female figurines and a terracotta figure of a god- dess who is represented with upraised arms (FIG. 36.3). The large quantities of LM IIIB pottery found in the immediate surroundings led Evans to propose that the Shrine of the Double Axes, despite its modest size (c. 1.5 x 1.5 m), had been an important and much fre- quented sanctuary (Evans 1928, 332). Popham pointed out that this LM IIIB pottery does not display the usual range of domestic shapes, but is marked by a prepon- derance of stirrup jars, amphorae and "champagne cups" (Popham 1964, 7-9). Unfortunately, disagree- ment about the state and status of the Palace ofKnossos in LM IIIB makes the association of this pottery with the shrine uncertain. Likewise, it remains disputed whether the Shrine of the Double Axes belonged to a 3 As kindly pointed out by Sinclair Hood during the discussion at the Conference, an even earlier shrine, dating to the MM III period, had existed in the same area (Hood and Taylor 1981 . 273; Gesell 1985, 92. 38). This article treats only the Postpalatial and later periods.</page><page sequence="3">CULT ACTIVITIES A T THE PALACE OF KNOSSOS 41 3 Fig. 36.2 (above).

More may be learned about the function and social context of the Shrine of the Double Axes through a comparison with bench sanctuaries at other LM III sites. The associated cult, of which the divine figure with upraised arms is the apparent focus, has rightly been considered as part of a broader, possibly island- wide phenomenon. Varying numbers of similar figures have been found at no less than 10 Cretan LM HIB and IIIC sites (Alexiou 1958; Gesell 1985, 47). Although the possibility cannot be excluded that some of them derive from domestic shrines, a more firmly established association is with freestanding bench sanctuaries (Peatfield 1994, 28). The rise in popularity of LM III bench sanctuaries, with their characteristic cult inventory, has been con- vincingly interpreted as a response to the disappear- ance of centralised palace religion (Renfrew 1985, 401; Gesell 1985, 54; Kanta 1980, 324; Peatfield 1994, 32- 3). On the one hand, the idea has been advanced that their emergence represents the more modest continua- tion of a former palace cult at the regional or local level. Nilsson had already identified the LM III figures with upraised arms as the successors of a Minoan goddess who had served as the protector of palace and house- hold. The guardian function was also reflected in an association with snakes, which was maintained in the</page><page sequence="4">414 MIEKEPRENT LM III bench sanctuaries. Many of these sanctuaries (though not the Shrine of the Double Axes) have yielded the so-called "snake tubes", which served as stands for kalathoi or offering bowls (FIG. 36.4; Nilsson 1950, 77- 82, 309-21; Gesell 1985, 50-1). Recently, Robin Hägg has reiterated the view that the LM III bench sanctuar- ies and associated cult betray - more than anything else - a Minoan ancestry. Bench sanctuaries in Crete may go back to the Early Minoan period and the use of Minoan cult symbols is maintained, most notably in the tiaras of the goddess figures (Hägg 1997, 167). On the other hand, the possibility has been suggested that the LM III bench sanctuaries developed under the im- mediate influence of Mycenaean settlers in the island, thus presenting an instance of syncretism between Minoan and Mycenaean religion (Renfrew 1985, 400; Peatfield 1994, 35). While the presence at Knossos of Linear B tablets mentioning both Mycenaean and Minoan deities surely supports the likelihood of syncretism, its scale and depth are not readily assessed. Suffice it to repeat the conclu- sion of previous authors that the changing social and political circumstances of the LM III period cannot but have affected form and function of the bench sanctuar- ies. As a new incarnation of an old cult, the associated worship will surely have been subject to re-definition and change (Mersereau 1993, 15; Peatfield 1994, 20, 33). In this context, it is perhaps most important to stress that the widespread occurrence of LM III bench sanctuaries seems best explained by their function as focal points for community cult activities at the local or regional level (Kanta 1980, 324; Peatfield 1994, 31). In Fig. 36.4. Snake tube with kalathos attached, after Gesell et al iQQi, pi 63 e. most settlements, the bench sanctuaries occupy a promi- nent and central position and are not attached to houses - characteristics that point to public or communal use. The closest parallels for the Shrine of the Double Axes are the LM IIIB bench sanctuaries at Ayia Triada and Gournia. As with the former, these combine the usual characteristics of communal bench sanctuaries and a location amidst (formerly) palatial structures - per- haps, to paraphrase Gesell, in commemoration of the history of these places as important religious centres (Gesell 1985, 42). THE LATE MINOAN IIIC-SUBMINOAN SPRING CHAMBER The Shrine of the Double Axes, which was found with much of its inventory still in position, gives the im- pression of having been suddenly abandoned towards the end of LM IIIB (Popham 1964, 7). This was a pe- riod of general disturbance in the Knossos area. The Bronze Age quarter on the Lower Gypsades hill was deserted (Hood and Smyth 1981, 1 1-12), while the site of the Stratigraphical Museum, where occupation had ceased earlier, was reoccupied in LM IIIC (Warren 1983, 69). From that time on, the area west of the Palace be- gan to evolve into the principal habitation nucleus. There are comparable interruptions and shifts in the use of the old Knossian burial grounds. Several cem- eteries were abandoned and the reuse of LM III tombs in LM IIIC and SM commonly follows on a brief pe- riod of abandonment. In SM, the North Cemetery was established to the north of the Palace and began to serve as a primary burial ground (Hood and Smyth 1981, 1 1- 14; Coldstream 1984, 314-17, fig. 1). The appearance of new, Mainland traits in the LM IIIC pottery and architecture of Knossos, and the, for Crete, unusual custom of intramural baby burials un- der the floors of LM IIIC houses (Warren 1983, 69- 73), have led several scholars to propose the arrival of new people from the Mycenaean Mainland (Popham 1964, 8-9; Hood and Smyth 1 981, 14; Cadogan 1992, 132-3), who may have been followed by Doric-speak- ing Greeks at the beginning of SM (Coldstream 1984, 317). Without getting into the thorny question of the identification of ethnic groups in the material record, it is worth emphasising that LM IIIC-SM at Knossos appears to have been a time of change and diversity. The excavators of the North Cemetery, for instance, contrast the variety in burial customs with the greater uniformity and regimentation of the subsequent PG period. At the same time, the shift to the new burial ground at the North Cemetery and the adoption of cre- mation by some Knossians indicate a departure from the past (Coldstream 1991 , 291 ; Coldstream and Catling 1996,715). In the context of these changes, a traditional sanctu- ary like the Shrine of the Double Axes may have lost general appeal. Its abandonment did not, however, mark</page><page sequence="5">CULT ACTIVITIES AT THE PALACE OF KNOSSOS 415 the end of cult activities at the site of the Palace. These found continuation in the Spring Chamber, the small but well built ashlar fountain house that originally formed part of the Caravanserai (FIG. 36.5) (Evans 1928, 123-39, figs. 59-69; Hood and Smyth 1981 . 285). While the rest of this Neopalatial complex was abandoned in LM IIIB or earlier (Evans 1928, 128), the Spring Cham- ber attracted considerable numbers of votives during LM IIIC-SM. Apart from a few terracotta figurines and closed vessels, these votives consist of kalathoi, many of which still contained the remains of olives (FIG. 36.6). The interior back wall of the Spring Chamber has a central niche with ledges on either side - a tri- partite design typical of certain Minoan shrines (Shaw 1978, 446-7; Gesell 1985, 100-1). While this religious symbolism may have appealed as much to the LM IIIC- SM votaries as to earlier users of the Spring Chamber, there are no finds to indicate votive activity at the Spring Chamber prior to LM IIIC-SM {contra Hood and Smyth 1981, 14; Coldstream 1984, 317). It is therefore Fig. 36.5. Spring Chamber, after Evans 1928, suppl. pi 16. Fig. 36.6 (below). Kalathoi from the Spring Chamber, from Evans 1928, 134, fig. 68.</page><page sequence="6">4l6 MIEKEPRENT unlikely that the LM IIIG-SM cult at the Spring Cham- ber continued an earlier cult at the same spot. Because of the quantity of votives, the LM IHC- SM cult at the Spring Chamber is sometimes described as public (Hood and Smyth 1981, 14; Coldstream 1991, 289). This qualification, however, needs modification in as far as it implies a centrally located and organised cult that served large or representative parts of the com- munity. That this may not have been the case can be inferred both from the character of the votive assem- blage and from the location of the sanctuary. Like the earlier Shrine of the Double Axes, the votives at the Spring Chamber preserve certain icono- graphie or symbolic links with earlier cult expressions, albeit in a weakened and less explicit form. Instead of large goddess figures with upraised arms, the Spring Chamber yielded a cylindrical model, with a female figu- rine whose pose is similar to that of the large figures attached to the bottom (FIG. 36.7). As noted independ- ently by Hägg (1990, 1 01-2) and Mersereau (1993, 17), cylindrical models such as the one from the Spring Chamber are to be associated with a cult for a goddess represented with upraised arms, but generally belong in the realm of domestic cult. From the time these mod- els make their first appearance in LM IIIA, up to PG times they are found principally in houses, with the exception of the one from the Spring Chamber and one in the North Cemetery (Coldstream and Catling 1996, 217, 368. 219. 86). Similarly, the kalathoi, which are akin to the bowls set in snake tubes (Gesell 1976, 255, 1985, 51), represent a simpler type of offertory vessel, which may have been particularly at home in domestic shrines (Seiradaki i960, 11). The more elaborate snake tubes are, like the large goddess figures, missing from the Spring Chamber. Fig. 36.7. Cylindrical model from the Spring Chamber, after Evans 1928, 129, fig. 63. The domestic connotations of the votive assemblage from the Spring Chamber contrast with the more for- malised and standardised assemblages as known from bench sanctuaries of both LM IIIB and LM IIIC-SM. The lack of formalised cult equipment, together with the Spring Chamber's distance from the main habita- tion nucleus to the west of the Palace, suggests that the fountain house did not serve as a primary community sanctuary. Two, possibly overlapping, groups of wor- shippers present themselves. On the basis of funerary evidence, it has been tenta- tively proposed that the Gypsades hill, to the south of the Spring Chamber, had become the domain of a small group of "survivors from the Minoan past" (Coldstream and Catling 1996, 715). The burial grounds here show signs of reuse but would have become peripheral after the establishment of the North Cemetery. In contrast to the majority of reused Bronze Age tombs at Knossos, those in the Gypsades cemetery were reused for inhu- mations without clearing out the earlier remains (Coldstream 1984, 317, 199 1, 290). If the association of the Gypsades area with a group of indigenous Knossians is correct, it may perhaps also be proposed that these people, who would have been well steeped in older cult traditions, were responsible for cult activities at the Spring Chamber. In more general terms, the remains of olives in the kalathoi and the association of the Spring Chamber cult with water seem to point to a concern with vegetation and fertility. If the analogy with later Greek cults at springs and fountains holds true, we may suspect a pre- dominance of female worshippers. THE PROTOGEOMETRIC-HELLENISTIC "SANCTUARY OF RHEA" By the PG period the Spring Chamber was no longer used. Not long afterwards, however, a third cult place came into vogue amid the ruins of the former Palace. This time, a more central site was chosen at the south- west corner of the Central Court (Evans 1928, 5-7; Hood and Smyth 1981, 20, 32, n. 72-3). Here, Evans found a pit with sherds of EIA drinking equipment (G and possibly PG one handled cups, G skyphoi and bowls, and a krater) and two clay animal figurines, one possibly a griffin from a clay cauldron (Hartley 1931, 92-3, 108, figs. 23, 33. 4, pl. 18. 4; Popham 1978, 185- 7, n. 34). An MG askos, found in the same general area, may also have been an early votive (Coldstream 2000, 288-9). It is further tempting to associate with this sanc- tuary the "darker soil full of wood ashes and bones, possibly of a sacrificial nature" in the Central Clay Area, which Evans mentioned in his first report (Evans 1900, 17)- EIA architectural remains were not identified, and cult seems to have taken place in the open air. Worship- pers literally gathered amidst the ruins, the dramatic effect of which will have been reinforced by the fact</page><page sequence="7">CULT ACTIVITIES AT THE PALACE OF KNOSSOS 417 that impressive sections of the Palace were still stand- ing. Evans, for instance, described how fragments of the Minoan bull fresco in the Northern Entrance Pas- sage were found 1 m higher than the LM IIIA stratum, on a level which he associated with Geometric sherds found some 20 m to the north (Evans 1930, 171, n. 2, fig. 1 14, 1935, 18; also Coldstream and Macdonald 1997, 196). Evans identified the PG and later cult at the Palace as that of Rhea, mother of the gods. He based this con- jecture on the mention by Diodorus Siculus of a sanc- tuary for this goddess "in the land about Knossos" (Evans 1928, 5-7; D. S. 5. 66). Unfortunately, the mod- est votive deposit from the Central Court provides few iconographie clues as to the character of the deity. Nei- ther do we get much information on the votaries. It should be emphasised that the votive deposit compares poorly to the large assemblages from community sanc- tuaries at other EIA settlements. In the urban and sub- urban sanctuaries of sites such as Axos, Gortyn, Lato and Praisos, hundreds of terracotta votives were dedi- cated, a large proportion being of anthropomorphic type (Rizza and Santa Maria Scrinari 1968; Forster 1905). The absence of such votives at the Central Court sug- gests a relatively restricted group of worshippers - people who seem to have engaged more in rituals of drinking and libation than in the dedication of repre- sentations of deity or dedicator. In an indirect way, the question of who these wor- shippers were is illuminated by funerary evidence from the North Cemetery. Here, we have the great benefit of the work of Coldstream, who has called attention to what seems an attempt of leading Knossian families to mimic or fashion for themselves a Bronze Age burial style. Coldstream and Catling (1996, 715-17) note how the pronounced variation in burial customs in SM gave way to a growing trend towards uniformity in PG: cremation in rock-cut chamber tombs became the domi- nant rite, and in some cases burials were accompanied by funerary symposia. Another change occurs in the PGB period, when some of the burials begin to use very large chamber tombs, which are among the richest found in the cem- etery (Coldstream and Catling 1996, 716-20). The fact that these are either thoroughly cleared out LM III tombs or very close imitations implies a rediscovery or, perhaps better, an appropriation of the Bronze Age heritage. The enhanced interest of the EIA Knossians in this heritage was also expressed in their choice of urn type. While more modest, contemporary crema- tions were placed in coarse pithoi, or in belly-shaped urns decorated in the older PG tradition, the straight- sided urns from the large chamber tombs seem to imi- tate a Bronze Age form (pyxis) and are decorated in the new PGB style. This eclectic style is likely to have drawn part of its inspiration from Bronze Age motifs. The latter include female figures and the bird-and-tree theme, while in the Geometric period there is a short lived revival of the Minoan octopus. Motifs like these may have been seen on LM HI larnakes, fragments of which were found in at least ten of the EIA chamber tombs (Coldstream 1991, 290-1, 296-7, 1996). Coldstream convincingly interprets this as an attempt of leading Knossian families to associate themselves more closely with the Bronze Age past. This phenom- enon, of course, ties in with the more widespread re- vival of especially aristocratic interest in an heroic past, which characterises much of the Greek world of the eighth century. The same group of leading Knossians may have taken the initiative in establishing the sanctuary at the south- west corner of the Central Court. On present evidence, precious votives, which would more overtly betray aris- tocratic involvement, are wanting. However, the drink- ing equipment provides a clear cross-link with aristo- cratic burials in the North Cemetery (FIG. 36.8). There is now an impressive body of literature showing how ritualised forms of drinking and feasting in early Greece became the prerogative of a male elite, eventually de- veloping into the institution of the Symposion in Ar- chaic times. Such rituals can be seen as a way of (selec- tive) bonding, of creating a sense of unity between par- ticipants and, at the same time, defining the exclusive- ness of the group in relation to other segments of soci- Fig 36.8 Selection of PG drinking vessels from North Cemetery T 287 (left) and Teke T.Jf (right), after Coldstream and Catling iqq6, figs. 65 and 143.</page><page sequence="8">41 8 MIEKEPRENT ety (Murray 1990; Schmitt-Pantel 1992). In a similar fashion, a privileged association with the past would serve as a mark of social distinction and contribute to the articulation of aristocratic groups. Later finds from the votive pit in the southwest cor- ner of the Central Court included two probably fifth century coins from Aegina and a series of fine Classical and Hellenistic drinking vessels (Popham 1978, 186-7, pl. 27 b' Coldstream 2000, 286-8). This indicates con- tinued emphasis on drinking and/or libation, although the exclusively aristocratic connotations may, by this time, have worn off. In these later periods, there may also have been a temple, that is, if Evans's characterisa- tion of the rectangular building in the adjacent West Wing is correct.4 The recent discovery of a fifth cen- tury paved road, which seems to have led from the southwest of the Palace to the sanctuary area (Coldstream and Macdonald 1997, 244), strengthens the idea of renewed building activities at the site of the former Palace in the Classical period (Coldstream 2000, 296). CONCLUDING REMARKS To sum up, we may observe a pronounced pattern of continuity in the sense that the Palace of Knossos con- tinued to have a special, even sacred meaning long after its destruction. This was given visible expression in the form of cult activities throughout the period from LM IIIB to Hellenistic times. The related cults, however, vary in location, form and expression and served chang- ing audiences. While the Shrine of the Double Axes, a type of sanctuary well-steeped in Cretan cult tradition, may have served as a primary community sanctuary, the Spring Chamber, though maintaining a physical link with the Palace and some kind of iconographie rela- tionship with earlier cult expressions, seems to have taken a less prominent position in the religious life of the Knossians. The importance of the Palace as a sa- cred area seems to have been enhanced as part of more general aristocratic interest in the Bronze Age past in the course of the PG period. A cult was brought back to the centre of the Palace and closer to the contempo- rary settlement. But this appears to have served only a small group, whose association with the Palace and other Bronze Age monuments served as a special mark of dis- tinction. In this respect, we may speak of a profound change since the time of the Shrine of the Double Axes. 4 The size, date and function of the rectangular building in the area between the Minoan Grand Staircase and Central Court are all disputed. Alternative interpretations propose a Postpalatial megaron (Palmer 1963, 63-8, 223-6; Driessen 1992, 15, 99). See also the reaction of Popham (1993) and sum- mary by Coldstream (2000, 286).
