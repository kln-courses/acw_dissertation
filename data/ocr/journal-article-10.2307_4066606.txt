<plain_text><page sequence="1">Pagans at the Parliament Dale Wallace abstract Paganism is one of the fastest-growing religions in the west today. It encompasses a variety of traditions, mostly unified by conceptions of the sacrality of the natural world and the re-embracing of the feminine aspects of the divine. Consequently, both feminism and Nature are central to the discourses of much of contemporary Paganism. This reportback is able to highlight only some of the debates around these features, as they were presented by Pagans at the Parliament of the World's Religions, held this July (2004) in Barcelona, Spain. It also suggests how central these debates are to many critical issues that face our society and espouses their validity in being 'pathways to peace'. keywords Pagan, Wicca, nature, Goddess, spiritual, feminist Introduction The Parliament of the Worlds' Religions that has been held every five years since 1993, is modelled on the first Parliament, held in Chicago in 1893, which is regarded as the beginning of the global interreligious movement. Essentially a forum where the religious and spiritual communities of the world can explore their responses to the critical issues that face humankind and our planet, the fourth Parliament, held this July (2004) in Barcelona, Spain, employed as its guiding theme,'Pathways to Peace: the wisdom of listening, the power of commitment'. Paganism is an umbrella term for a wide diversity of traditions that have developed in the West since the 1 950s, of which, Wicca and Witchcraft form the largest groupings. From a small showing at the 1993 Parliament, this year's Pagan representation had grown to over 60 individuals, and included representatives from Circle Sanctuary, Lady Liberty League, Gaia's Womb, EarthSpirit, the Pagan Federation International, the Covenant of the Goddess, as U A flag at the Pagon booth at the Parliament depicting a Goddess holding the Earth in her arms well as independent Pagan practitioners and scholars. Pagans presented three panel 80 Agenda 6! 2004</page><page sequence="2">Reportback Pagans at the Parliament discussions, participated in interfaith panels, and provided musical and ritual presentations. As a Pagan, and as one who has worked in Pagan Studies for eight years, I was invited by Rev Selena Fox, senior minister of Circle Sanctuary, to be the South African representative on her panel discussion entitled'Pagan Religions around the World'. Over the course of a week, Pagans aimed at elucidating how this nascent, and frequently misrepresented religious orientation, is able to respond to the goals and guiding principles of the Parliament and how it is poised to address the contemporary issues and concerns of humanity and of the Earth herself. My selection of the gendered pronoun in relation to the Earth is an apposite starting point to this discussion. My mother taught us thot God, the creative source, wos femole; a womon and Goddess who manifested herself in the natural cycles of the Earth, of life being evident in the rising and setting of the sun, the phases of the moon, life and death, and much of what we learnt predates most of the moinstream religions today. She came before, She always has been, and continues unbroken. These are the words of Angie Buchanan, public relations advisor for Lady Liberty League, director of Gaia's Womb, Pagan interfaith activist, and first Pagan to be nominated to the board of the Parliament of the World's Religions, as she opened the first of the Pagan panels, entitled 'Pagan Dialogues: Inside and Outside the Circle'. It is an important quotation in that it immediately drew attention to two of Paganism's most central concerns. Firstly, is the centrality of the earth, or Nature, to the Pagan worldview, and the associated recognition of the divine as being immanent in the material world. Secondly, is the fact that the divine feminine is intrinsic to the Pagan worldview. Despite this latter fact, there is within Paganism, what Pagan academic Michael York, in his panel presentation called 'a multiple and gender-differentiated understanding of God'. Paganism can be pantheistic, polytheistic, panentheistic or animistic, dependent on the particular persuasion of the practitioner. Consequently, one finds some traditions that elevate the Goddess over the God, others that honour deity equally as both masculine and feminine, a few forms in which the God is more central, and some without any anthropomorphic references to the divine. Regardless of these differences, all endorse the acceptance of masculine and feminine attributes in divine energy. Paganism and Nature Although Pagan conceptions of Nature are multifarious, all panellists affirmed the Pagan rejection of any religious model that entrenched a divide between spirit and matter, divinity and humankind, and rather asserted the need for a vertical, participatory relationship with the divine. By opposing religious beliefs that the world is 'something to be transcended', Pagans blur the boundary between the sacred and the mundane, and look to Nature as an expression of divine immanence with which they can engage. Pagan traditions are more concerned with praxis than with belief, and it is primarily through ritual that this engagement is facilitated. The peace ritual held by Pagans in Barcelona was consistent with most Pagan rituals in the invitation extended to the four elements, and to the God and the Goddess, to participate in, guide and protect the ritual circle that Pagans cast as sacred space. By attuning their inner lives to the outer cycles of nature through rituals and through a calendar of seasonal festivals, Pagans celebrate an embodied existence that embraces'an intimacy with all that exists' (Harvey, 1997:1). These unmediated encounters with the sacredness in Nature are a deliberate corrective to religions that separate humankind from each other, from all forms of sentience, and most importantly from direct encounters with the divine. My mother taught us that God, the creative source, was female Agenda 61 2004 81</page><page sequence="3">Pagans at the Parliament Reportback Mother Tongue, the performance and ritual wing of the EarthSpirit community Inconsistencies in Pagan rhetoric with regard to Nature can be found, particularly where its recognition of the sacrality of the Earth and the need for communion with Nature, does not necessarily translate into active engagement with the environmental crisis. Reclaiming and feminist traditions are leading exceptions as they marry women and the earth as both being colonised victims in male-dominated societies. Representing these traditions at the Parliament was director of the Harvard Pluralism Project, Grove Harris, who, in her presentation, radicalised the necessity for ecological involvement when she said:'We are Nature and to heal Nature we heal ourselves'. Pagan Models of Divinity Notwithstanding York's usage of the term 'gender-differentiated',Wiccan priestess and civil rights lawyer Phyllis Curott was correct in saying that Paganism is a religion in which the Goddess is mostly elevated over the God. Central to Paganism is the discovery/recovery of the Goddess, and whilst She can take on a range of forms, that of Earth Goddess is preeminent. Deirdre Arthen of the EarthSpirit community opened her panel with the chant: We are one with the soul of the earth: Mother Earth. In doing so she firmly located humans in an interconnected relationship with the sacrality of the earth, and also personified this sacrality in terms of, not only the divine feminine, but more specifically as 'Mother'. The Earth/Mother Goddess Many Pagans personify the earth as Mother or as a manifestation of the Earth Goddess, and, in doing so, honour the feminine as the natural source of fertility. In the first Pagan panel, Angie Buchanan asked all in attendance to put their hands over their hearts. The sound of the mother, she stated, was the first sound heard in the womb, and, is 'where our religion starts and from where we create our sanctuaries'. This depiction of the Goddess in which the procreative and nurturing qualities of the feminine are emphasised, has found its critics over the years. In tracing the history of the modern Goddess, Ronald Hutton (I1998:97) validly states that in periods when Woman stood for virgin, mother, nature or the source of fertility, she seldom seemed to stand for more 'emancipatory' roles such as Woman as surgeon, director or politician. The attribution of such roles to the Goddess can itself be a form of sexual stereotyping, and a branch of feminist theory that Val Plumwood (quoted in Hutton, 1998:99) suggested: ... had just replaced the myth of woman as 'the angel in the house' with the equally restrictive one of'the angel in the ecosystem'. The whole body of the Goddess Hutton's point brings the discussion closer to the politics of the Goddess, and to the forms of Paganism that employ the Divine Feminine, as opposed to Nature, as the central rubric of their tradition. Paganism offers a range of models of the Goddess, and, within each of them, different models of female identity can be explored. One of the most overtly political forms of Wicca/Witchcraft is that of Starhawk's Reclaiming Tradition,' born in America in the 1 960s.This tradition that has inspired many branches of Feminist Wicca around the world is a synthesis of spirituality and politics. Once again in her discussions, Grove Harris, ratified the Pagan contention that polarised and dualistic systems of divinity do not 'honour all 82 Agenda 6/ 2004</page><page sequence="4">Reportback Pagans at the Parliament aspects of life'. Harris extended this position by stressing the necessity to 'reclaim the knowing of ourselves, Nature and the Earth'. Her Feminist Wicca is, in some ways, an intense broadening of the notion of the Goddess as Earth Mother, and is a discourse that embraces 'the whole body' of the Goddess. Such a discourse provides the option for females who choose not to centre their identity in fertility and motherhood, but who, equally validly, need to find expression amongst a range of possibilities that include and combine the body, the spirit and the intellect. This model subtly challenges the more ubiquitous Pagan depictions of the Goddess that exclusively embed the feminine within the material universe. Supporting feminist theologian Mary Daly's view that religions, in which the God is male, create societies that support the male as God,2 Harris argued for a Goddess-centred religiosity as a corrective to patriarchal systems in which, she contends 'the earth, the body and women are denigrated'. Many question whether such radically feminist rhetoric does little more than reverse patriarchal oppression and yet fail to take the Pagan quest for gender equality and balance any further. Contextualising her remedy to these imbalances within the guiding theme of the Parliament, Harris suggested that what is required 'to heal that level of damage is to listen and to pay attention to these issues'. A note of caution comes from Wiccan priestess, psychotherapist and Parliament attendee, Judy Harrow ( 1996:19), when she says: I insist, as radically as I know how, on the complete equality and full participation of the genders. Responding to concerns regarding the potential marginalisation of males within some strands of Paganism, Harris made the following statement: When English language uses He, He, He, there is the assumption that I am going to include myself in that. What is wrong with starting with She, She, She and assuming that everyone present, including all of the Intolerance and discrimination happen when people see one another as objects, as "other. "As we frankly exchange ideas and get to know one another as people like ourselves we establish Q true world harmony. An exhibit board in the registration holl at the Parliament men, are perfectly copable of including themselves in a model of divinity in femole form? There is no exclusion of the masculine in knowing the feminine. FeministWicca urges that past imbalances are as a direct result of patriarchal religions that perpetuate, in society, the domination and exploitation of matter, the earth, and, consequently, of women. Even Pagans outside of feminist traditions would mostly agree with the following indictment Harris made of such systems when, in her presentation, she said: ... a non-sentient Nature provides the ideological justificotion for dominotion, and this mindset has a direct link to misogyny. When a male Godhead has dominance over the Earth, then society is bound to reflect that model, with dire consequences for humanity and the Earth. Harris pertinently implied that abuses of women are equally abuses of men who also are scarred by what Judy Harrow calls 'patriarchy's training in toughness and competition' ( 1996:21). The South African context The issues raised by Pagans at the Parliament Agenda 61 2004 83</page><page sequence="5">Pagans at the Parliament Reportback touch on a multitude of contemporary local and global issues and concerns; many of them requiring more debate and deeper analysis but all, I maintain, are important. Paganism has undergone tremendous growth in South Africa since its visible emergence in 1996. Some reasons for this growth are without doubt the fact that it affirms the female and provides a role for women as spiritual leaders; that it is an undogmatic religion that questions, and frequently overturns or inverts, many mainstream positions and stereotypes, not least those with regard to sexuality and gender Without invalidating the enormous progress South Africa has made since our change in dispensation, I believe there is still in place, what Harrow calls 'a dominator culture3 (1996:21), whose language, values and attitudes are so ingrained in the fabric of our society that they are often perilously invisible. In such a culture the principles of balance and partnership are eroded by the privileging of one gender, class, religion, institution or ideology, over another, resulting in the abrasion of social conscience and of concern for the environment. Violence and crime continue to affect all sectors of our population, our rape statistics are amongst the highest in the world, and there is inequitable access to natural resources, most especially, water. We remain a country still undergoing transformation and often in need of new models of relating to each other The Parliament advocated'the wisdom of listening'.To listen to the Pagans at the Parliament was to hear a new, still relatively marginalised voice. It spoke of a paradigm shift wherein the recognition of the sacrality of the earth and the recovery of the divine feminine, would facilitate new ways of being IN this world. It is a radical position that calls for a resacralisation of all forms of life, for the imperative to see the sacredness in the 'other', to heal past imbalances and to look to the natural world for ways in which to address and apprehend the issues that affect us all. As Judy Harrow (1996:9) so relevantly remarks: But the Goddess is, as all true religious symbols, multi-vocal. Certainly she is about the empowerment of women and the gentling of men, but she is about a great deal else as well.
