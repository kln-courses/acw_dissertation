<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMOS STUDIES I JULIAN MORGENSTERN. Hebrew Union College, Cincinnati, Ohio I1 I The Initial Problem IN a recent work Alois Musil, unquestionably one of our most eminent and authoritative students of Bedouin life and lore, makes the following interesting observation. Speaking of the Rwala Bedouins he says," "A poem is but rarely written down. As a rule the poet's friends learn it by heart, and others learn from them. Every Bedouin knows several poems but hardly ever the whole of any. He usually recites from six to ten verses and then says that perhaps someone else knows the rest. Hence, since every long poem must be collected piecemeal from a number of men, the order of the individual verses can seldom be accurately established. If two Bedouins know the same verses of the same poem, they never recite them in exactly the same way but change the original words and often whole verses. Sometimes these changes are due to later improvements by the poet himself, but in most cases his unconscious or careless friends are to blame. The Bedouins often quarrel as to the original wording of the verses and frequently ask the poet himself about this, but even he is not always absolutely sure. Often the poet insists that a verse was at first worded in such and such a way, but his friends contradict him. This makes him exclaim that all the versions are good and original, and he ends by appealing to the omniscience of Allâh. After hearing this answer from a number of poets, I gave up the search for the original wording, as the task is not only most difficult but quite useless. At other times I found that the poet himself knew barely the first few verses of his own 1 The Manners and Customs of the Rwala Bedouins (New York, 1928), 283f. 19</page><page sequence="2">20 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [2] poem. The rest he had forgotten and was glad that his friends remembered more than he. Only poems dealing with subjects of common interest become widely known and are preserved, whereas poems describing particular events are recited only by the persons concerned and fall into oblivion when these persons are dead." This statement is of far-reaching significance for Biblical Science. We accept almost without question the rather gratuitous hypothesis that among primitive peoples, dwelling upon a plane of cultural evolution in which the art of writing has not yet evolved and become fairly general, the human memory is much more prodigious, persistent and infallible than it is among peoples more advanced culturally and therefore accustomed to rely upon written records. This hypothesis has played a role of more than passing import in the determination of the history of those masterpieces of world-literature whose beginnings obviously antedate the evolution of the art of writing in their respective cultural groups, and which must therefore have been transmitted orally for relatively long periods. We assume that in this period of oral transmission the literary form of the composition in question must have remained fairly, if not almost absolutely, constant, that the practically infallible memory of primitive peoples must have preserved almost without change or omission the entire work as it first emerged from the inspired mouth of the original author, that the poetic, rhythmic form of most literary compositions of primitive peoples contributed in great part to their preservation in practically their original wording, and that the form in which they were ultimately written down records with approximate exactness the precise utterance of the author and of the professional tribal bards who transmitted the composition through successive generations to the age of writing. Now we learn from one whose authority is beyond all question that among those present-day representatives of the Semitic peoples whose mode of life still in many respects resembles quite closely that of the primitive Semites of the various stocks and peoples, and among whom in particular the arts of writing and reading are not widely disseminated, and who must therefore,</page><page sequence="3">[3] AMOS STUDIES 21 in the preservation of literary compositions, rely very largely upon memory, this memory is far from being the infallible and tenacious instrument we have fondly imagined it to be, that very speedily the exact wording of poems and likewise their full content are apt to be forgotten even by the author himself, that within a not too long period various more or less divergent forms of a poem or of portions thereof are liable to appear, with no possibility any longer of determining precisely what the original wording may have been, and that more or less extensive portions of a poem are quite likely to disappear from memory completely and thus become lost irretrievably. There is every reason to believe that what obtains today among these still comparatively primitive Semites must likewise have obtained in a comparable degree among the ancient Semitic peoples living upon relatively the same plane of cultural evolution. For ancient Semitic literature in general these considerations should have a deep significance, especially in the case of such folk-compositions as the Gilgame§-epic for example. Certainly for biblical literature they have a far-reaching import with regard to such early, pre-writing compositions as the Song of Deborah. And likewise for the study of the prophetic books these con siderations are of great moment. For while it is true that the literary prophets all lived in a period when the arts of writing and reading must have at least begun to become fairly general in Israel and Judah, none the less we must bear constantly in mind that the prophetic compositions were in origin, almost without exception,2 spoken addresses, delivered for the most part in the fervor of religious passion, if not of actual ecstasy, that for varying periods of time they could have been preserved only in the memories of the prophet himself or of his hearers or interested friends, and only eventually, perhaps after months or even years, did they come to be written down, either by the prophet himself or by some friend or disciple. During this period ג Such few exceptions as, for example, Jeremiah's letter to the Babylonian exiles (Jer. 29.4ff.). Notice too how much stronger is the impression of correct ness of transmission which the assuredly authentic opening vv. of this letter (4-7) make than is the case with other passages and even with the major portion of the book.</page><page sequence="4">22 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [4] intervening between spoken address and written record memory, or memories, may have come to play strange tricks. The prophet's own memory may have proved none too retentive and accurate, particularly if his words, which he eventually sought to recall and record, had been spoken originally in an abnormal, ecstatic or semi-ecstatic, psychic state; and the memories of hearers and friends may have showed themselves to be even more unreliable. In time different versions of his actual words may well have arisen; and if in preparing the written record of his words the prophet consulted some friend or friends,3 or if perhaps the written record were made, not by the prophet himself, but entirely by friends or disciples, and perhaps even after the prophet's death, when appeal could no longer be taken to his own memory, a version of the prophet's words differing considerably from what he had actually said, or, not impos sibly, several divergent versions of the same utterance, may have crept into the written records. Or not impossibly the com mitting of the prophet's originally spoken address or addresses! to writing may have been in order to deal with a situation quite i different from that which called forth the original utterances. In such case the prophet's actual, spoken words, written down, may have been consciously modified, so as to deal with the new situation. Again portions of the original utterances of vary ing length may have been forgotten, some permanently, others temporarily. The former would, of course, be lost forever. The latter would naturally be incorporated into the text, if space allowed each into the place where it properly belonged, but just as probably into some place where it did not belong at all but where perhaps space permitted; or equally probably, it may, together with other at first forgotten and then recalled passages, have been tacked on to the end of the book as a kind of appendix of half-forgotten passages or of passages whose original connection with the main body of the address or addresses was no longer remembered. נ As, for example, an illuminating instance indeed, Jeremiah did with Baruch;Baruch; for assuredly Baruch was far more than a mere mechanical amanuensis to Jeremiah, and the prophet must frequently have relied upon his disciple's recollection of his master's words.</page><page sequence="5">[5] AMOS STUDIES 23 Such and other similar considerations undoubtedly have prime validity for all originally oral compositions in biblical literature, and especially for the writings of the prophets, and demonstrate conclusively what a delicate and precarious task the reconstruction of the actual, original words of any prophet must be. Yet it is an imperative task, which may not be escaped. But these considerations tell us that the results must always be more or less subjective, that there is no possibility of invariable, absolute, demonstrable finality, that there must always be the widest latitude of legitimate opinion and conclusion, the propriety and inevitability of which must be generally recognized. Particularly in the case of the scientific study of the Book of Amos these considerations have far more than passing sig nificance. During the last half-century or more biblical scholars, practically without exception, have recognized clearly that within the book, as we have it now, there is abundant and unmistakable evidence of textual disarrangement and disorganl ization. Thus, for example, particularly in chapters 8 and 9, excluding the two visions at the beginning of each chapter, such unquestionably authentic portions as 8.4-7 (in the main), 9-10, 13-14 (in the main); 9.7-8a, 9-10,4 which have no apparent connection whatever either with what precedes or with what follows, make the distinct impression of utterances of Amos, forgotten at the moment of writing down the main body of the prophet's words, then subsequently recalled and added as an appendix, instead of being inserted into their proper place as originally spoken. And perhaps neither Amos himself nor any one who might have heard him remembered any longer, par ticularly if some time had elapsed between the actual close of his prophetic activity and the writing down, either by himself or by some hearer or disciple, in precisely what connection these words had been spoken. Within the prophet's address proper (1.3-6.14) there are, moreover, numerous places where the connection, both with what immediately precedes or with what immediately follows, 4 The genuineness of 9.9-10, questioned by most modern scholars, is stoutly maintained by Sellin. This question will be considered thoroughly in its proper place in the course of these studies.</page><page sequence="6">24 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [6] is not readily apparent, and the passages in question seem to stand in comparative isolation, such passages as 3.3-8; 4.1-3; 5.1-3, to quote but a few of the most striking examples. Else where the connection between passages seems obscure and uncertain, as the various scholarly attempts, for the most part somewhat forced, to establish some connection prove, such as between 2.12 and 13; 2.16 and 3.1; 3.12 and 13; 4.5 and 6; 5.11 and 12, 20 and 21, 24 and 25 and 25 and 26; 6.11 and 12, again to cite but a few striking examples. As a result scholars have generally assumed, quite gratuitously but nevertheless without apparently the slightest question, that the book consists of a collection of addresses or fragments of addresses by Amos, delivered at different times and places in the course of his prophetic career. There is no agreement whatever as to the content and limits of the various addresses. Nowack, following Baumann, holds that the book may be divided broadly into five main addresses. Sellin too finds five main themes in Amos' addresses, and holds, together with Hôlscher, that some of these were delivered in Samaria and others in Bethel, although it is no longer possible to determine the original chronological sequence of the addresses nor precisely which were delivered in Samaria and which in Bethel, certainly a vague, unsatisfactory and purely conjectural hypothesis to say the very least. Marti divides 3.1-6.14 into fourteen separate paragraphs or sections, representing seemingly as many different addresses or fragments of addresses. Gressmann refuses to recognize actual addresses of Amos, but prefers to speak instead of "sayings," i.e. of scat tered, fragmentary, more or less unrelated utterances. Of these, he maintains, some thirty are recorded in the book, many con sisting of not more than a single verse. This is obviously not only an extreme hypothesis, but likewise a singularly convenient one, since it obviates completely the scientific necessity of seek ing for a basic interrelationship and unity within the book and in the significant prophetic message which it presents. Such a hypothesis manifestly merely sidesteps the inherently difficult problem and evades the main issue. Upon almost only one point does there seem to be a fairly general agreement, viz. that 1.3-2.16, with the secondary portions</page><page sequence="7">[7] AMOS STUDIES 25 omitted, constitutes in itself the first single and complete address of Amos' prophetic ministry.5 Yet careful and searching thinking should have warned imperatively against such a conclusion. It is quite generally conceded that the denunciation of the various foreign nations serves merely as the introduction to the prophet's denunciation of Israel and pronouncement of its doom, that it was designed quite artfully to secure an initial assent of the people to the message which the prophet was preparing to bring, a sympathetic hearing thereof and a general admission of his prophetic authority, before he launched upon the main theme of his message, the denunciation of Israel and the pro nouncement of its doom, and this in terms comparable to and at least as definite, comprehensible and scathing as his denuncia tion of the foreign nations and pronouncement of their doom. But certainly this passage, consisting of at least twelve verses,6 can not be the introduction to merely 2.6-16, a passage con sisting of only eleven verses, of which three and one-half verses, viz. 7b, 10-12, have been regarded by various scholars as not genuine, while four other verses, viz. 13-16, as we shall see, have in all likelihood, been displaced from their original setting or settings elsewhere in Amos' address. Moreover, 2.6-16 in its present form, contains only the vaguest and most general pronouncement of the doom of Israel, not at all comparable to the specific and absolute pronouncement of the doom of the foreign nations, and therefore not at all the expression of the full message which Amos was, as he sincerely believed, divinely commissioned to deliver to Israel. And it is incomprehensible why in his initial address, after working up his audience with the powerful and moving denunciation of the foreign nations, Amos should have contented himself with only a vague, inconclusive, unconvincing denunciation of Israel and in itself only a timid, obscure, mystifying hint at its divinely 5 Sellin, however, while recognizing the apparent internal unity of this long passage, refuses to grant that this was Amos' opening address and falls back upon his general thesis that the chronological sequence of the various addresses can no longer be determined. 66 1.3-8, 13-15; 2.1-3; a full discussion of this entire section will follow later in the course of these studies.</page><page sequence="8">2626 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [8] determined doom, assuming that he had found for himself a satisfactory audience. Or if he had not yet found such an audience, then still less comprehensible is it why he should have delivered his initial address at all, with its powerful, preparatory intro duction, instead of waiting for the favorable occasion and pre cisely the type of audience which he needed to make his initial address effective, the type of audience, in turn, of which alone the powerful, preparatory denunciation of the foreign nations was worthy. Furthermore, as we shall see more clearly and con clusively in the course of these studies, the very pronouncement of the doom of Israel in manner and upon a scale which con forms to the expectations suggested by the uniform pronounce ment of the doom of the foreign nations, is found actually, and precisely as we would expect it, later in the book, with full detail as to the destruction of the nation, the overthrow of the royal dynasty and the exile of the people. All this suggests unmistakably that the denunciation of the foreign nations is introductory, not merely to the comparatively brief paragraph in 2.6-16, but rather to the entire book, or better,, to the one, single, closely unified address contained within the book. Moreover, it is significant that within the book itself we find few or no instances of repetition of thoughts, ideas or denuncia tions, such as we find again and again in Isaiah, Jeremiah and Ezekiel. Still less do we find in Amos indications of a gradually unfolding message, of a changing, expanding, growing thought and an insight into the full implications of his prophetic mission penetrating more and more deeply with passing days and enlarg ing experience and meditation, as we find in these same prophets and even perhaps in Hosea too. In fact, as we shall see, the evidence of the book points to the conclusion that from the very first moment of his active prophetic career, Amos was com pletely aware of the full content of the message which he was commissioned to deliver and of the far-reaching import thereof. All these considerations suggest that instead of numerous addresses, five or fourteen or thirty as the case may be, Amos actually delivered only one single address, the address at Bethel, of course, cut short by Amaziah's interruption, yet, as we shall see, not before Amos had actually said his full say and com</page><page sequence="9">[9] AMOS STUDIES 27 pletely discharged his divine commission. This address could at the very most have required not over thirty minutes to deliver, perhaps not even more than twenty, surely not too long a time to allow for this high purpose. It is strange indeed that this hypothesis of one single address, of a professional career the public portion of which was crowded into a space of not more than a brief half-hour's duration, should apparently not have occurred to any scholar previously. Yet a moment's thought must show that this is in all likelihood the import of the opening biographical and literary-historical statement of the book, that Amos' entire prophetic career fell during the reign of a single king, Uzziah of Judah and Jerobeam II of Israel. True, the reigns of both these kings were of comparatively long duration, so that from this one datum alone we can draw no conclusion, other than a purely negative one, that Amos' prophetic career was at the very most over only that period during which these two kings reigned synchronously, a period, however, of approximately forty years. But the other statement, that the prophetic activity of Amos came just two years before the earthquake, would seem indeed to limit the prophetic career of Amos to a period not" exceeding one year. Probably chiefly upon this ground both Hôlscher and Sellin have concluded that the entire duration of Amos' prophetic activity could have been of only a few months. But if so, then why not draw the further conclusion that the entire active career of Amos as a prophet, his complete function ing before the people in his prophetic role, consisted only of the single moment of his appearance at Bethel, and that there he delivered his entire, closely unified address? This hypothesis we shall test closely in the course of this investigation and, so we believe, we shall establish its validity with reasonable certainty. And this will in turn set various matters in quite a new light and clarify certain basic problems of the interpretation of the message of Amos and of his work as a prophet. The initial task therefore in the systematic study and inter pretation of the Book of Amos is a rearrangement of the at present disorganized text into what will seem after careful analysis to have been approximately the original sequence of thoughts in the single address, as we shall endeavor to prove,</page><page sequence="10">28 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [10] which Amos delivered at Bethel before the great assembly of the people of the Northern Kingdom, gathered at the national sanctuary for the celebration of the annual Asif festival at the end of the old year.7 Such rearrangement of the text of Amos in order to establish proper connection between seemingly related passages and proper consecution of thought is by no means a new procedure. Various scholars have sensed the validity and even the necessity of such procedure and have accordingly ventured to make certain rearrangements of text, although, so it would seem, upon too hesitant and restricted a scale to achieve conclusive results. Thus, to cite but a few instances of such proposed rearrangement of text, Duhm and Baumann would transpose 7.10-17 to follow immediately upon chapter 6. Budde would transpose this same passage to the very beginning of the book, following 1.1, while Sellin in turn would transpose it to the very end of the book, following 9.8-15, which he holds to be genuine. Duhm would likewise transpose 7.9 and 8.3 into the text of chapter 6. Marti and Proksch would set 1.5aa after 1.5a/3. Harper would transpose 1.8c to precede 1.8ab, 2.10 to precede 2.9, 2.12 to precede 2.11b and 5.3 to precede 5.2. Butten wieser would insert 8.4-8a before 3.9, and would rearrange the entire chapter 5 thus, 1-6, 14-15, 12, 7, 10, 13, 11, 16-17.8 If nothing else, these few instances of proposed textual rearrange ment prove that eminent and responsible scholars have had recourse to this procedure in the past and justify its renewed י Amos' sudden, unannounced appearance at Bethel during the Asif festival at the end of the year, with its climax in the celebration of the New Year's Day and the beginning of the new year upon the eighth and last day of the festival (cf. my "Two Ancient Israelite Agricultural Festivals," JQR, N.S.N.S. VIII [1917], 40fF.; "The Three Calendars of Ancient Israel," HUCA, I [1924], 22-58), was well considered indeed. This was the main annual festival of the nation, at which, more than at any other festival, the people were accus tomed to throng to the chief national sanctuaries (cf. 1 Sam. 1.3; Amos 5.5, 21). There Amos could be sure not only of a large audience, but also of one thorough ly representative of every social, economic and political stratum within the nation. This procedure on the part of Amos parallels exactly that of Elijah at Mt. Carmel, likewise upon the same festival just preceding the advent of the rainy season (1 Ki. 18), and of Jeremiah with his so-called Temple address (Jer. 7 and 26; cf. my "The Gates of Righteousness," HUCA, VI [1929], 20ff.). 8 Vv. 8-9, of course, he regards as not genuine.</page><page sequence="11">[11] AMOS STUDIES 29 application upon larger, bolder and more systematic scale than has been ventured thus far. It will be well to begin this attempted solution of one of the most difficult problems connected with the study of the book and the life and work of Amos with the consideration of one of the most troublesome, most frequently discussed, and unques tionably most significant passages in the entire book, viz. 3.3-8. II 3.3-8+7.10-17 The internal interpretation of 3.3-8 is relatively simple. In v. 3, as most modern scholars have agreed, נועדו must be retained (against the נודעו of LXX) in the sense, "to come together for common purpose and action."9 In v. 4b ממעונתו, contrary to Budde and Weiser, but in agreement with most modern scholars, must be omitted as a meaningless gloss. Not only does it disturb the manifest rhythm or meter of the passage, as we shall see, but it is also altogether contrary to fact. A young lion, still too immature to seek its own prey, might cry for food from its den, but a lion, such as is pictured here, mature enough to seek its own prey, does not cry from its den, but rather, precisely as is represented here, roars when, away from its den, it is about, to spring upon its prey. In v. 5a פח must unquestionably be omitted as meaningless in this connection and as undoubtedly a duplication from 5b. For ומונן ש the simplest emendation is ומוקש; the hif'il seems preferable to the pi'el, ומיקש, since the verb occurs once in the hof'al (Eccles. 9.12), but not even once in the pi'el. The emendation is, of course, necessitated by the consideration that a snare, no matter how effective and how cleverly set, can not cause a bird to fall to earth; all it can do is catch the bird which unwittingly falls into it.10 In v. 6 the twofold use of בעיר in such immediate juxtaposition seems awkward and suspicious. Budde proposes, though quite tenta tively, בעם for the first בעיר; but in such case the even closer ' Cf. Josh. 11.5; Ps. 48.5; Job 2.11; Neh. 6.2. 10 Weiser would nevertheless retain ומוכןש.</page><page sequence="12">30 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [12] juxtaposition of בעם and עם would be still more awkward. Far more probable would be the emendation of the first בעיר to בשער. Inasmuch as the gate is the meeting-place of the city where the authorities gather, it is there that, in all likelihood, the alarm-blast upon the so far would be sounded on an occasion such as is here contemplated." V. 7 is undoubtedly a gloss to 8b, as the vast majority of modern scholars are agreed." In v. 8 אדני may well be omitted, in order to achieve in v. 8b metrical uniformity with v. 8a. The metrical arrangement of the passage is unmistakable, as the appended form shows : 3 הילכו שנים יחדו בלתי־אם נועדו: 4 הישאג אריה ביער וטרף אין־לו היתן כפיר קולו בלתי־אם לכד: 5 • התפול צפור על־הארץ ומוקש איךלה היעלה פח מךהאדמה ולכוד לא־ילכוד: 6 אכדיתקע שופר בשער ועם לא־יחרדו אם;תהיה רעה בעיר ויהוה לא־עשה: 8 אריה שאג מי־לא יירא יהוה דבר מי־לא ינבא: The passage consists of nine couplets. The prophet presents his argument in the first seven couplets, each seemingly containing one homely but forceful metaphor, drawn from the ordinary experiences of life. Each couplet falls regularly into two halves, the first half consisting of three beats or bars and the second 11 Cf. Ezek. 33.3f., where the watchman, stationed no doubt upon the lookout post upon the city wall, and in all likelihood just above the city gate, through which the main approach to the city leads and an enemy would there fore enter, sounds the alarm when he beholds danger approaching, and the people, obviously within the city or in the neighboring fields, take warning. 12 Lôhr, Baumann, Duhm, Nowack, Marti (whose presentation of the evidence is most convincing), Steuernagel, Hôlscher, H. Schmidt, Budde and Weiser. The attempts of Oort, Oettli, Harper and Gressmann to prove the genuineness of the v. are forced and unconvincing.</page><page sequence="13">[13] AMOS STUDIES 31 half of two beats; in other words the quite common 3 + 2 mea sure. The second halves of all nine couplets exhibit a striking uniformity of form, with their undeviating use of short words and with the unvarying position of the negative particle. The staccato effect is obvious. Moreover, couplets 2-7 employ the characteristic "parallelism of members" in most forceful manner. Only couplet 1 lacks this parallelism, but this very lack is all the more striking and effective, for it serves to make the basic theme of the paragraph stand out all the more emphatically. In the two final couplets the prophet draws the inference from his argument. Here the first half of each couplet consists of only two beats, again with forceful staccato effect. The second half of each couplet consists of the regular two beats, in other words a 2+2 measure. Artistically and effectively in couplet 8 the prophet returns to the figure of the lion of couplet 2, and in couplet 9 he returns to his figure of couplet l13 with the subtle implication that the two who walk together by mutual agree ment for common purpose are Yahweh and His prophet. The unity both of thought and of form of the entire passage is unmistakable.14 Manifestly the passage deals broadly with the relation of cause and effect, or perhaps more exactly, with the relation of effect and cause.15 But this is no mere general disquisition upon 13 So Budde. 14 It is therefore to me utterly incomprehensible, on the one hand, how Marti could detach v. 3 from w. 4-8 in order to link it (but only as an editorial gloss) to vv. 1-2, or, on the other hand, how H. Schmidt, Gressmann, Holscher, Kôhler and Baumgarten could detach v. 8 from w. 3-6. Gressmann's argu ment, based upon his hypothesis of Amos' use of sacred numbers, particularly seven, is especially artificial and ineffective. Weiser has conclusively refuted this hypothesis and proved the unity of the entire passage, with the single exception of the omission of v. 7 as a late gloss. 15 The fact, to which Lohr, Gressmann and Baumgarten call attention, that in vv. 3-Sa and 6b the order of presentation is (1) effect and (2) cause, while in vv. 5b-6a it is reversed, (1) cause and (2) effect, is, as Budde has shown, of no significance whatever. A moment's thought should show that the thought of v. 5b could scarcely have been expressed other than as it is, at least certainly not effectively and in metrical form; and certainly v. 6a is more forceful, euphonious and rhythmic than were it expressed in the reversed order, הלא יחרד עם אם יתקע שופר בשער.</page><page sequence="14">32 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [14] this oft-discussed philosophic question.16 Rather it is an argument with a definite and immediate purpose, directed by the prophet to his audience, composed in large part of simple, lowly people, and therefore illustrated by him with homely figures springing not only out of his own, but also in great part out of their daily life as well.17 The argument is, of course, that no effect happens without its cause; or, more specifically, nothing transpires in this life without its initiating cause; therefore, if some event, condition or phenomenon becomes manifest, it is not that it came about of its own accord, without cause or initiating agent or instrument. In the presence of every such phenomenon then the initiating cause or force must be inquired after. If therefore one, such as he for example, speaks as a prophet, it must not be imagined for one moment that he is speaking only upon his own initiative and volition, but it must be definitely understood that he speaks as a prophet only because Yahweh has spoken first to him, and he has no alternative whatever but in turn to speak out as Yahweh's agent; the effect must always flow irresis tibly out of the cause; and in the case of prophetic utterance Yahweh is the invariable cause. Self-evidently then the two who, in the prophet's initial question, in the statement of his thesis,18 walk together with mutual agreement and understanding and for common purpose are Yahweh and His prophet. No other interpretation of this passage is justifiable.1' 16 As Gressmann apparently, with his altogether supererogatory and characteristically fanciful comment that, inasmuch as Israel was not a philo sophically minded people, too abstruse a consideration of this problem might not be expected from Amos, would have preferred. 17 It may well be too that in most of these figures there is something of an axiomatic background, just as Weiser suggests. 18 Just because this is the main thesis of this argument, and therefore the semi-rhetorical question in v. 3 is more the statement of this thesis than an illustration to enforce the argument, very appropriately and effectively it is presented, unlike the other illustrative figures, singly and without parallelism; cf. also below, p. 67. 19 As Budde has correctly maintained, the return in v. 8a to the figure of the lion of v. 4a does not mean at all to imply that Yahweh is the lion in ques tion. The mere fact that אריה is used again here without the article precludes such an interpretation. V. 8a says no more than this: "Very well; admitting that, as these illustrations have demonstrated, no effect transpires without its</page><page sequence="15">[15] AMOS STUDIES 33 And this is indeed the opinion of most modern scholars. The attempts of a few scholars, such as Nowack and Harper, to link 3.3-8 to 3.1-2 and to interpret the two who walk together as Yahweh and Israel, are forced and unconvincing, and are rejected practically universally. Furthermore, there is today a general agreement on the part of biblical scholars that 3.3-8 stands absolutely isolated in its present position, that it has no direct connection whatever either with what precedes or what follows. The customary interpretation is therefore that this passage constitutes an address, or at least a fragment of an address, by Amos, in which, in response to a challenge by a doubting and resisting audience, Amos states his divine authority, the source of his commission as a prophet.20 The passage then has man ifestly a personal implication; it recounts clearly how Amos looked upon his own commission by Yahweh as a prophet. In thought therefore it has a definite relationship to the visions, especially the first four, as is recognized by many scholars.21 Actually, however, as closer thought shows, this passage does much more than merely give Amos' statement of his divine commission as a prophet to a doubting and challenging audience. Rather, as the entire import of the argument, and particularly of the concluding half-stanza indicates, Amos is replying here to an urgent command that he desist from prophesying further by the statement that it is impossible for him not to prophesy, even if he should choose to do so, for Yahweh has spoken to him, and it is impossible for one to whom Yahweh has spoken in this manner to resist Yahweh's word. Yahweh is the irresistible cause, and his prophesying is the inevitable effect flowing there from. That alone can be the true and full import of his, "Yahweh has spoken; who will not prophesy," i. e. who can refrain, even under the most extreme conditions and in the face of the most imperative prohibition, from prophesying. cause, now let it be realized that a potent, irresistible cause has actually been in operation; can then its effects fail to follow? Yahweh has spoken; can then he to whom Yahweh has spoken refrain from prophesying?" 20 So in particular and in greatest detail, Weiser. ]I Duhm, Marti (vv. 4-8), Hôlscher and others.</page><page sequence="16">34 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [16] Obviously therefore, as has been said already, but as can not be emphasized too strongly, 3.3-8 is more, much more, than what most scholars seem to imagine it to be, a mere state ment on the part of Amos, to his doubting and questioning audience, of the source of his commission as a prophet. It is manifestly an affirmation, presumably in answer to a command by some one in high authority that he desist from prophesying, that such a command can not be obeyed by him, even were he inclined to obey it, that there is an authority over him higher far than the authority which bids him desist from prophesying, an authority which is absolutely irresistible and which has bidden him function as a prophet in precisely the manner in which he has functioned. The word which he has spoken is not actually his own personal word, but rather the word which Yahweh has spoken to him, spoken to him that he might in turn communicate it to His people; and just this he has done. It is therefore futile to bid him desist from prophesying; in the face of this higher, this supreme authority, this irresistible cause, the authority of him who bids him, Yahweh's prophet, to desist from prophesy ing, is as nothing at all. Clearly then this statement is not directed merely to any nondescript audience, such as might have gathered to hear the prophet's words upon some ordinary occasion. Rather this reply is directed to some one of high authority, directed sternly and with implicit rejection of his command not to prophesy. Of course, these words fit only one specific occasion in the prophet's life, at least only one of which we know aught; but they fit this occasion so completely that there can be no doubt thereof. The occasion is that recorded in 7.10-17, when Amaziah, the priest of Bethel, bids Amos desist from prophesying and return to his home. Various scholars, notably Marti, Bertholet, Sellin and Budde," have recognized a relationship of 3.3-8 with 7.10-17 and particularly with 7.15. Both passages, they hold, deal with practically the same theme, viz. Amos' own conception of the manner and nature of his prophetic call. But, at least so our contention is, they have failed to realize how much closer even than this is the relationship of the two passages. " But against this Weiser.</page><page sequence="17">[17] AMOS STUDIES 35 The problems inherent in 7.10-17 are many and difficult. That the passage is an important biographical note is, of course, self-evident, as is also the fact that it has deep additional sig nificance for the history of prophecy itself. That the passage is out of place, coming as it does between the third and fourth visions, and that originally it must have stood elsewhere in the prophet's book, is equally apparent. And that in vv. 10, 11, 12 and 14 Amos is referred to in the third person, instead of in the first person, raises the interesting question whether Amos himself was the author of the entire passage, or whether it must be ascribed wholly or in part to some other writer or compiler. All these questions will be carefully considered in their proper place. For the present our task is to consider the passage itself in its obvious relation to 3.3-8. The text of the passage is in almost perfect condition. In v. 13 one of the two הוא's is apparently superfluous, but whether it be the first or the second, is difficult to determine ; nor actually is anything of great significance involved in the decision.23 Like wise in v. 14a one of the two 8'אנכי seems to be superfluous, pre sumably the second just as in 14b, but this is largely a matter of taste, and the omission is by no means imperative.24 Similarly in v. 15 the second יהוה seems almost certainly not only super fluous but even awkward and disturbing, and should unquestion ably be omitted. In the same v. we should probably read על for אל with Pesh. and also as in v. 16.2S More significant is the change of בוקר in v. 14 to נוקד, a change which involves only minor substitutions of two letters for others closely similar in form, and which has the approval of the vast majority of present day scholars.26 The correctness of the emendation is proved by 3נ Budde would retain both 3'הוא. Lohr, Baumann and Harper would omit the second. To me it seems more in accord with the spirit of the Hebrew lan guage to omit the first and retain the second. 24 Nowack and Budde would retain both 8'אנכי. Lôhr, Baumann and Harper omit the second. 45 So Harper, Weiser and others. 36 Marti, Nowack, Sellin, Gressmann, Budde, Weiser. H. Schmidt prefers to retain בוקר, chiefly, so it seems, because it is one of the important props of his ingenious but far-fetched hypothesis that Amos was, not a Judaean, but a Northerner.</page><page sequence="18">36 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [18] a number of considerations. This is absolutely the only passage in the entire biblical literature where the term בוקר occurs, or where from the noun בקר a verbal derivative is built up. More significant is the consideration that the very concept of cattle herding as a regular occupation, particularly for a grown man, in ancient Palestine is almost inconceivable. On the one hand, cattle were seldom, if ever, raised in sufficient numbers and in such man ner as to require the attention of professional cow-herds. Cattle must be watered so frequently that they can graze only in proximity to their source of water, and can not be driven to any considerable distances. In consequence they must be kept fairly close to the homes of their owners, are purely family property in the narrowest sense, and are regularly cared for by the imme diate members of the family. Seldom, if ever, are they entrusted to the keeping over a protracted period of a professional herds man.2! It is unimaginable therefore that Amos could have designated himself as a בוקר. On the other hand 1.1 says explicitly that he was a נוקד, while v. 15 here says explicitly that Yahweh took him from following, not the cattle, but the sheep. And, unquestionably his regular occupation as a shepherd, with its constant occasion for roaming with his sheep in the solitude of the waste country adjacent to his native Tekoa, far from the settled abodes of men, furnished ample opportunity for quiet meditation and for the visions which he experienced, far better than had he, as a cow-herd, been obliged to remain constantly in close contact with the village and its human relations, an opportunity almost indispensable for the psychic experiences which led to his consciousness and conviction of his prophetic commission. In the light of these considerations there can be no doubt of the justification of the emendation of בוקר to נוקד. In v. 16, just as also in v. 9, I suspect that the strange form 2י Ex. 22.9-12 indicates that the entrusting of cattle and asses to the custo dy of some person other than a member of the family was a by no means every day procedure. Certainly here oxen are in the same category as asses; and inasmuch as ass-herding was an occupation practically, if not entirely, unknown in ancient Israel, so also, it may be assumed, was cow-herding.</page><page sequence="19">[19] AMOS STUDIES 37 ישחק is a corruption of an original 28.יעקב The ש instead of the normal צ is difficult, though, of course, by no means impossible to explain. More problematic is the use of either ישחק or יצחק to designate the Northern Kingdom, in contradistinction to the Southern Kingdom, particularly since Isaac seems to have been a Southern, rather than a Northern, hero inasmuch as Hebron was apparently the center of his traditional activity. However, nothing vital is involved in either the retention of ישחק or its rejection in favor of יעקב. In v. 17 the emendation of תזנה to ת^נה, first proposed by Halévy, is undoubtedly correct.29 Like wise the omission of ובנותיך has been adequately justified by Budde, and is also confirmed by considerations of meter, as we shall see. Finally, Marti has demonstrated conclusively that v. 17b is either a gloss30 or else has been dislocated from its original position at the end of 7.9. We come now to the interpretation of the passage as thus emended. The implications of the fact that Amaziah reports to Jerobeam that Amos is fomenting conspiracy in the midst of the nation are of more than passing significance. It is not at all that, as has been frequently suggested, Amaziah thinks only of Elisha's conspiracy with Jehu and Jonadab ben Rechab. Far rather he has in mind what had been hitherto the regular, established policy of the professional prophets, beginning with Ahijah of Shiloh. For the evidence is unmistakable that the division of the kingdom in 932 B.C. and the accession of Jero beam I to the throne of the Northern Kingdom were very 38 So also Budde, although his final decision is to abide by MT. Actually in v. 16, LXX does read יעקב, even though in v. 9 it must have read ישחק, since it paraphrases this του yk\uros. Pesh. too paraphrases ישחק in v. 9 fcguhka,', i. e., "the laughing one," but unlike LXX in v. 16 it retains ישחק. 2» Budde prefers to emend to תן!גל, but this seems quite unjustified. On the one hand, the emendation of תזנה to ת^נה involves the change of only one letter to another not greatly dissimilar to it. On the other hand, the picture here is not so much that Amaziah's wife will be captured and become the concubine of her captor, but rather that she will be ravished by the conquering enemy as one of the customary, but from the standpoint of the conquered, most horri fying aftermaths of the battle and capture of the city; cf. Lam. 5.11. 3° So also Lohr, Baumann, Nowack. Duhm and Budde would retain the half-v. in its present position.</page><page sequence="20">38 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [20] largely the result of a rebellion fomented by Ahijah of Shiloh and supported by Shemaiah31 and other professional prophets of the time. Their program was unquestionably to put upon the throne a king who, in contradistinction to Solomon, would revive the old, simple, democratic life and form of government and would show himself amenable to their doctrine of loyal relations to Yahweh, whose champions, as the national god of Israel, they conceived themselves to be. Later, when these same prophets came to realize that Jerobeam I was the very last man to adapt himself to their program and prove amenable to their authority and leadership, they turned against him and, quite in accordance with their now established policy, sought to dethrone him and elevate in his stead one who would prove more conformable to their program.32 Jerobeam I, however, succeeded in maintaining himself upon the throne during his entire lifetime; but not so his son and successor, Nadab. After a brief reign of but two years he was put out of the way by Baasha, undoubtedly with prophetic connivance. But Baasha too disappointed prophetic expectations and proved no more amenable to prophetic counsel and policies than did the kings of the preceding dynasty. Once more the prophetic program was renewed, this time under the leadership of Jehu ben Hanani,33 with the result that, even though Baasha, like Jerobeam I, succeeded in maintaining him self upon the throne until his death, his son and successor, Elah, succumbed, likewise after a brief reign of two years. Whether the two rivals for the throne of the Northern Kingdom, Omri and Tibni, both enjoyed prophetic support is not certain because of the paucity of biblical data bearing upon the matter. But that Omri and Ahab also, in the first year of his reign, did enjoy such support may be inferred from the interesting narrative recorded in I Ki. 20.13ff. In all likelihood this attempt of Ben Hadad of Syria to crush Ahab and Israel happened at or very soon after Ahab's accession to the throne. The incident recorded in I Ki. 20.35-43 narrates how and when the professional prophets turned against Ahab. On this very 3' 1 Ki. 11.29-31; 12.22-24. 31 ־ Ki. 13.1-32; 14.1-20. 33 1 Ki. 16.1-7.</page><page sequence="21">[21] AMOS STUDIES 39 occasion, in connection with the defeat of Ben Hadad, they came to realize that the young king had a will and a policy of his own, a policy which differed radically from their own. Accord ingly, so we may infer, at the very commencement of his reign a rift manifested itself between Ahab and the professional prophets. The rift grew wider and wider with the development of Ahab's economic, political, social and religious program. Undoubtedly the professional prophets would eagerly have reinaugurated their established procedure and disposed of Ahab in some way and elevated some other more tractable man to the throne. But unlike the two previous occasions in the history of the Northern Kingdom, the king now proved more powerful than the prophets. The prophetic movement in the Northern Kingdom was well-nigh crushed in Ahab's reign. In' every way the reactionary prophetic program, religious, economic,'■ political, social, ran counter to the progressive policies of the strong and vigorous king. And their now well known hostility to him justified him in open and aggressive procedure against them. Apparently during Ahab's reign the person of the pro fessional prophet ceased to be sacrosanct, as it seems to have been, for instance, in the days of Jerobeam I, in connection with both Ahijah of Shiloh and Shemaiah. Tradition records that Ahab did not hesitate to employ violence against the prophets,3יי including Elijah. By the end of his reign the ranks of the profes sional prophets were greatly reduced, and those who survived, with but very few exceptions, as the incident of Micaiah ben Yimlah evidences,35 had themselves lost almost all of their former independence and sense of devotion and responsibility only to Yahweh, and become merely passive tools of the king, speaking only the word which the king wished to hear. Obviously during the momentous reign of Ahab professional prophecy in the Northern Kingdom, even with its crude standards and policies and shortness of vision, had degenerated immeasurably. An organized professional movement, such as prophetism had been up to this time, could not maintain itself in an age of 34 1 Ki. 18.4, 13; 19.10, 14. 3s 1 Ki. 22.6-28.</page><page sequence="22">40 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [22] political independence, strength and ascendancy, cultural prog ress, economic prosperity and social revolution, which ran com pletely counter to the entire traditional, reactionary, back-to-\ the-desert program of prophetism. Professional prophecy in the North was doomed. Only a new type of prophecy, that of the non-professional, individual prophet, with the consciousness of a direct commission from Yahweh Himself, could persist and achieve in the face of the new times and conditions. Elijah was the forerunner of this new type of prophet. The death of Ahab and the fact that he was succeeded by weaker kings, unable to carry on effectively his religious, social, economic, and cultural program, apparently gave to professional prophetism an opportunity for temporary revival. In this Elisha was, it would seem, a fostering spirit. In significant contrast to the shepherd Elijah, born in an agricultural environment and therefore inured from birth to the social and religious conditions and standards of agricultural life, Elisha seems never to have realized the true inwardness of the message and program of his great master. For a few years after Elijah's death Elisha seems to have continued to follow his master's policies of preaching and appeal to the people at large to reject the steadily encroaching Phoenician Ba'al worship and the rapidly evolving social and economic reorganization which Ahab had initiated. But after some years or so of such efforts, apparently discouraged by the slow and meager results of such a program, largely educational in character, and, inasmuch as in its main aspects it ran diamet rically counter to the natural trend of the times and the ordinary laws of social evolution, necessarily, in its practical aspects, doomed to failure, Elisha seems to have reverted from the high prophetic standards and policies of Elijah to the far lower and more primitive standards and practices of early professional prophetism. Unlike his great master, he now made intimate common cause with the professional prophets of the day and joined with them in a revival of the old, crude policy of dethrone ment and massacre of the ruling dynasty and the elevation to the throne of one who would in all likelihood prove more tractable and amenable to prophetic leadership and program. The révolu tion was successful in every way. The dynasty of Omri was</page><page sequence="23">[23] AMOS STUDIES 41 annihilated; the dynasty of Jehu was on the throne. The period of Israel's decadence had set in. That during the reigns of Jehu and Jehoahaz and even into the reign of Joash this dynasty continued amenable to prophetic leadership, and especially that of Elisha, may well be inferred from the little narrative in 2 Ki. 13.14-19. But the death of Elisha coincided practically with the beginning of the brief period of political and economic revival in Israel. Damascus apparently had been crushed by Assyria in 797 B.C. and its power so broken that thereafter it ceased to be aught than, at the very most, a weak though still frequently annoying neighbor of Israel. Once again, and, so it seems, to an even more pro nounced degree than in the days of Ahab, Israel became the leading state in Western Asia. True, it was anything but an exalted leadership ; rather it was a hegemony among a large group of petty, weak states by that state which, because of purely fortuitous circumstances, because for one reason or another its little strength had not been exhausted by Assyrian conquest, as had been the strength of the little states north and north east of it,36 rather than because of any positive accession of new strength and power, could now show itself the least weak and least exhausted among them. Israel was but a shell. Its eventual doom was sealed. What the little states of Western Asia, united in joint defense against their common enemy, Assyria, especially in 797 B.C. or the years preceding this, might have achieved, it is, of course, impossible to say. But Ahab, with his far-sighted, statesmanlike policy of conciliation of his neighbors and of union and cooperation with them, was dead. The day of coalition and united and successful defense, as at Karkar, was past forever. A new dynasty, amenable to the leadership of professional proph etism, was on the throne. The blood-bath at Jezreel and the immediate and abject submission of Jehu to Salmaneser in 842 B.C., contrasting so significantly with Ahab's role at the Battle of Karkar but twelve short years before, were the first expressions and the effective symbols of the new dynasty and its prophet-led policy. Small wonder therefore that a prophet 4נ Cf. Alt, "Die syrische Staatenwelt vor dem Einbruch der Assyrer,' ZDMG, NF, XIII (1934), 233-258.</page><page sequence="24">42 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [24] of the new type should have denounced so scathingly and unre servedly this prophet-led dynasty and its initial acts just about a century after its accession to the throne." In all this the policy of professional prophetism is readily comprehensible. To the professional prophets Yahweh was a national deity in the narrowest and most literal sense. As a national deity He stood in constant and aggressive rivalry with the gods of other nations, precisely and in practically the same degree as Israel stood in competition, rivalry and enmity with its neighboring states. At the beginning of Ahab's reign the professional prophets had earnestly counselled the execution of the captive Ben Hadad and the complete crushing of Syria. This was the beginning of their break with the statesmanlike, young king. To have butchered Ben Hadad and annihilated Syria would have meant to them the complete triumph of Yahweh over His greatest rival and enemy, would have evidenced His supreme, indisputable power among His rivals, the gods of the other petty, West Asiatic States. Beyond this short horizon apparently their gaze did not penetrate; a world-outlook and a unified world-concept they were too provincial and too reac tionary to be capable of. Ahab alone apparently, with states manlike vision, saw beyond Ben Hadad and beyond Syria the slowly awakening giant, the reviving Assyrian Empire, and sensed the ultimate danger which lurked there. He at least must have had something, even though merely incipient and undefined, of a sense of world-unity and world-domination, over a century in advance of his time. Had Ahab been succeeded by a line of kings equally far-sighted and capable, who could have continued his policies of conciliation and unification of and cooperation with his neighbors, the history of the Near East might have been radically different. But a new and weak dynasty, pursuing a petty, divisive, nationalistic policy, shaped and controlled largely by professional prophetic influence and directed', in part at least, to the sure and speedy enhancement of the glory of Yahweh as a purely national deity in the most literal and petty sense, was on the throne. The confident expecta מ Hos. 1.4-5; 2.2b.</page><page sequence="25">[25] AMOS STUDIES 43 tion of the Day of Yahweh, the day of Yahweh's certain and complete triumph over all His enemies and, of course, of Israel's triumph with Him, the day when He would be recognized even by His enemies as supreme among the gods, and Israel too would be recognized as supreme among the nations, must have been cherished, not only by the people at large, but also and even more by those who must have evolved and fostered it, the pro fessional prophets of the day and the court, the nobles and the economic aristocracy, those who would obviously be the chief beneficiaries of such a triumph and the subsequent regime. Yet we may scarcely imagine that the relations between the ruling dynasty and the professional prophets continued per manently to be those of perfect understanding and of complete and ready conformity to prophetic program and leadership. Such they had been apparently through the reigns of Jehu and Jehoahaz and well into the reign of Joash, so long as Elisha lived. But Elisha, after a period of prophetic activity which must have continued for at least fifty-five years, died apparently about 797 B.C., or shortly thereafter, very soon after the accès sion of Joash to the throne and the overthrow of Damascus by Assyria. This was, as has been said, practically coincident with the commencement of Israel's final ascendency, of what was really, as with the perspective of history is almost self-apparent, a brief respite from Israel's certain political doom, a period of almost exactly sixty years of Israelite political hegemony in Western Asia, of restored economic prosperity and of rapid and extreme social evolution and cultural expansion. The social and economic conditions and evils which had begun to manifest themselves with the development of systematic commercial life during the reign of Solomon, and which had reasserted them selves upon a larger scale during the reigns of Ahab and his sons, once more reappeared and upon a wider, more general and more extreme scale than ever before. Luxury, licentiousness and social oppression were rampant. The miscarriage of justice and the systematic defrauding of the poor through the connivance of corrupt judges and witnesses, which, in Ahab's day, but a century earlier, had been a procedure so unknown and incomprehensible in Israel that even Ahab, the king, would not have understood</page><page sequence="26">44 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [26] how to carry it through, or, apparently, would not even have dreamed of it, in the case of Naboth, had it not been for the suggestion and guidance of Jezebel,58 trained in such practices in her culturally more advanced Phoenician home, had now become quite general and were carried on, not by the king himself, or perhaps better, not only by the king himself, but also and more widely and upon a scale which reached even to the poorest and humblest in the land, of whom the king himself would scarcely have deigned to take notice, by the rich, com mercial aristocrats. Whereas in Ahab's day apparently only the king himself had been in a position to build an ivory palace, such extravagant structures, even though upon a scale no doubt somewhat less pretentious than that of royalty, were now pos sessed by many of the more wealthy of these commercial aris tocrats."tocrats." And whereas, again in Ahab's day, the possession of both a winter house at Jezreel40 and a summer house in Samaria41 had apparently been the privilege of the king alone,42 now such extravagances seem to have become widespread among these same commercial tycoons. Conditions had indeed changed greatly from what they had been, not only in the olden days, but also even in the palmy days of Ahab, but a century before. And certainly, despite the growing assurance of the imminent coming of the Day of Yahweh and of Yahweh's consequent triumph over His rival deities, fostered by professional prophets as well as by king, court and aris tocracy, the professional prophets must have looked more or less askance and with dismay upon the social and economic conditions and evils, so far removed from their own basic, reactionary, back-to-the-desert standards of life, conduct, 3» 1 Ki. 21.1-16. 3» Amos 3.15. 40 1 Ki. 21.1-24 (particularly v. 23); 2 Ki. 9.15-37; note also the import of 1 Ki. 18.46. 41 Cf. 1 Ki. 10.1. 42 Cf. also the inscription of Bar-Rekub, son of Panamu, in which he records that his ancestors, the kings of Sam'al, had had only one palace, which there fore they were compelled to use as both a summer and winter house; and so, apparently to put an end to this reproach, he built a new palace. This was about 735 B.C., i. e., but a few years later than the time of Amos.</page><page sequence="27">[27] AMOS STUDIES 45 morality and religion, which their movement had fostered so sincerely in the days of its independence and vigor.43 These present conditions were so radically different from all that they had confidently expected to achieve with their revolution and the attendant reformation in 842 B.C., so utterly contrary to the standards of Yahweh-life and worship which they had sought so sincerely and earnestly, even though so mistakenly, to enforce, that they must have been grievously discontented and dismayed by all that had come to obtain in the evolution of the program which they had themselves inaugurated ; either this deep-seated discontent, or else they must themselves have fallen far from the original standards, ideals and authority of their movement to a level of servile acceptance of and conformity to conditions similar to and probably even more general and extreme than those which had characterized the professional prophets during the greater part of the reign of Ahab. More likely the latter condition than the former. In all probability, in fact in almost complete certainty, during the latter part of the reign of Joash and during the entire long and superficially prosperous reign of Jerobeam II professional prophecy must have retrograded steadily until the professional prophets had become men of no authority and low repute, men who functioned in their professional capacity only at beck and call and for what it might profit them.44 The command not to prophesy45 must have been directed frequently to the professional prophets, not only in the days of Ahab, but likewise during those of Joash and Jerobeam II. Professional prophetism had degenerated irredeemably and hopelessly. Never again could it be resuscitated. Professional prophets had now become largely false prophets, speaking only the word which the king and the rich and powerful wished to hear. Just as in the days of Ahab and Elijah, but to a a degree infinitely greater, a prophet of a new and altogether different type than the professional prophet was needed, was indispensable, if the true worship of Yah weh and His true way of 43 "The Oldest Document of the Hexateuch," HUCA, IV (1927), 98-119; "The Book of the Covenant," I, HUCA.V (1928), 138-151. « Cf. Mic. 3.11. 45 Amos 2.12b.</page><page sequence="28">46 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [28] life for Israel, inherent in the basic principles of prophetism, were to persist. With this picture of the evolution of professional prophetism up to the moment of the advent of Amos before us, we can understand perfectly the import of 7.10-17, and, in the first place, the import of Amaziah's word that Amos was fomenting conspiracy against the royal house in the midst of the people. Obviously he looked upon Amos as merely a professional prophet, a member of that lowly and now despised caste, who was foolishly seeking to revive the old, oft-tried policy of professional prophet ism of arousing a conspiracy against the king and effecting a change of dynasty in the fond hope of thus procuring a king more amenable to prophetic policy and program. After all it was just such a movement which had placed the present dynasty upon the throne. What more natural therefore than that Amaziah, mindful of this, should have construed thus the import of Amos' words, and particularly his very last words, which he, Amaziah, had heard with his own ears? On the other hand, apparently Amaziah did not take Amos too seriously; after all, what did professional prophets amount to in this advanced day? No one paid heed to them and nothing was to be feared from even the most extreme of Amos' words. As a responsible and efficient official of the king he promptly, and even with some slight but altogether comprehensible exaggeration, which reflects not so much what he had actually heard but rather how he interpreted those words, reported to the king what Amos had just said. But then, recognizing Amos by his dialect or by some char acteristic of dress or appearance as a native Judaean, and there fore as a stranger, and perhaps looking upon him too, in his supposed role as a professional prophet, as more or less crazy and irresponsible,46 perhaps also as more or less sacrosanct and inviolable, he spoke to him, half indulgently and half con temptuously, "Seer, flee away to the land of Judah and there earn thy bread and there practice thy profession of prophet; but at Bethel prophesy never again, for it is a royal sanctuary and a national shrine." Here Amaziah applied to Amos both «6Cf. 2 Ki. 9.11.</page><page sequence="29">[29] AMOS STUDIES 47 technical terms for prophet, נביא and ד1זה ; moreover, he showed by his cynical suggestion that Amos should practice his prophetic profession back in his Judaean home and thus earn his livelihood, that he regarded Amos, as a matter of course, as one of those typical, degenerate professional prophets of the day whose primary or sole interest in their formerly exalted profession was merely that it was for them a source of livelihood earned by devious and questionable methods. Obviously he anticipated from Amos immediate, unquestioning conformity to his com mand; least of all did he expect any reply to his words or any challenge of his authority. To him this was apparently a more or less every day affair, another, ordinary instance of " bidding a prophet not to prophesy." Amos' reply was therefore in itself altogether surprising. The mere fact that this man had the temerity to respond to the command of this high official indicated that this was no person and no prophet of the ordinary type. But far more than this, the content of Amos' reply was startling and challenging. "I am not a prophet nor one initiated in prophetic technique, but I am a shepherd and a dresser of sycamores. But Yahweh took me from following the sheep and He said unto me ; Go, prophesy against My people, Israel." What Amos says here of himself and of the nature of his prophetic commission and of his con sciousness thereof is overwhelmingly significant. In the first place he affirms in the most positive and unqualified terms that he is not a prophet, not a נביא, and that he neither knows nor employs aught of the established technique of professional prophecy.47 He is but a simple, ordinary man of the very humblest walk of life; nevertheless, despite his simplicity and lowliness of origin and occupation, Yahweh had taken him, Yahweh Himself, and charged him with the high commission to go and prophesy against His nation, Israel. In the first place, it is self-apparent here that Amos does not regard himself as a prophet at all. Manifestly he conceives of the נביא only as one who is thoroughly trained in the complex technique of professional prophecy, and such he knows himself &lt;בן נביא ל, i.e. literally, a member of a prophetic group or community; cf. 2 Ki. 2.15; 6.1*</page><page sequence="30">48 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [30] not to be. It is clear that when he uses the verb הנבא here and in 3.8 with application to himself, he does so only because he knows no other word which might even approximately describe what he is doing, the divine mission upon which he has been sent. He is thoroughly conscious of the fact that what he is doing and the nature of his divine commission are something altogether novel and hitherto unknown in the history of prophecy and of the religion of Israel. He has no specific, technical term by which to describe this new sacred function, and so, for want of a better term, and perhaps also so that he might make himself as comprehensible as possible to Amaziah and to all the bystand ers, he uses the best term available, הנבא, the only term his audience would half-way understand and the new and larger implication of which they might vaguely sense. In so doing he unconsciously gave to the term נביא and the verb הנבא an addi tional, technical connotation, which they had never thus far pos sessed. And subsequent generations, instead of eventually coining a new and better technical term to describe this divine functionary of this new type, accepted the old term in the new and more exalted connotation which Amos had unconsciously given to it. It would have been simpler and in a way more natural if a new term had been invented for this new divine office; it would have obviated much subsequent confusion and misunderstanding. It would have distinguished effectually between the old type of professional prophet and this new type of divine messenger, who had, after all, only a small, almost insignificant minimum in common with the professional prophet. A new technical term would undoubtedly have emphasized the divergent and superior nature of the direct divine commission of this new messenger of the Deity and would have established once for all the suprem acy, the higher authority, of the latter over the old professional prophet. And this would, in turn, have in all likelihood spared Jeremiah, Ezekiel and others of the later, true prophets much of their trouble and controversy with the professional prophets of their day, those who, like Hananiah ben Azzur for example,48 still animated, though undoubtedly with considerable, even if &lt;8 Jer. 28. Iff.</page><page sequence="31">[31] AMOS STUDIES 49 not absolutely perfect sincerity, by a persistent, short-sighted, flamboyant, misleading nationalism and concept of Yahweh as a purely national god, who could therefore never allow His nation to be destroyed and His people to be sent into exile, continued to function as spokesmen of their nationalistic Yahweh well into the post-exilic age.4» It would have obviated the problem dealt with so ineffectually and with such manifest failure to comprehend the true nature of the exalted prophet and of his divine commission and message in the Book of Deuteronomy.50 It would likewise have safeguarded against much confused thinking and conclusion in present-day study of the prophetic movement. But it did not occur to Amos to formulate a new technical term to describe the new divine function of which he was the very first conscious exponent.51 Instead, even though « Cf. Neh. 6.7; Lam. 2.20; Zech. 7.3. s» 13.2-6; 18.15-22. SI As we have already intimated and as we shall develop more fully later, Elijah had very much in common with Amos, and the nature of his divine call, commission and manner of functioning were so similar to those of Amos that strictly speaking Elijah might quite correctly be regarded as the very first of the prophets of this new and high type, and the term נביא in its more exalted connotation might justifiably be applied to him. However, we have far too little information about Elijah of a personal character to know the specific term by which he himself designated his own functioning as Yahweh's messen ger. From 1 Ki. 19.10 and 14 we might infer that he too designated himself as a נביא, though whether he actually conceived of himself as such in the strictest sense, or whether he too applied the term to himself for want of a better desig nation, is not at all certain and can, of course, never be determined with cer tainty for lack of conclusive evidence. On the other hand, the various narratives which emphasize Elijah's individualism and solitariness (2 Ki. 1, for example) and those other narratives which show unmistakably that the professional prophets of the day looked up to both Elijah and his successor, Elisha, as divine agents of an authority and power greatly superior to their own (2 Ki. 2.15-18; 4.1; 6.1-7; 9. Iff.) probably indicate that, on the one hand, the professional prophets and the people at large, and, on the other hand, Elijah and Elisha themselves likewise probably conceived of their divine commission and function as greatly superior to and only partially identical with those of the professional prophets. As has been shown already, Elisha, despite his unquestioned great ness and the wide extent of his influence, fell far short of his master in depth of insight into the true nature and import of his divine commission and message. But all the more clearly therefore does Elijah appear to merit the title נביא in its later, exalted implication and to be regarded as truly the first of the great prophets.</page><page sequence="32">50 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [32] he very clearly attempted to avoid as completely as possible the old technical term נביא, none the less he found himself com pelled to use the derivative verb, הנבא, as the only term available in the language to describe the divine function which he was discharging; and in so doing he perpetuated the old, technical term נביא, but gave to it an altogether new and more exalted connotation than it had had before. This new connotation of the term נביא is significant of the new development in the religion of Israel and of the new type of agent of Yahweh who had thus come into being.52 sa As the inevitable result of this new development and the new connota tion thus given to the term נביא, the need eventually became imperative of distinguishing effectively between the two types of נביא, the old, professional prophet and the new type, of whom Amos is typical. Hosea apparently did not yet sense this need, and accordingly when in 6.5; 9.7; 12.11 (12.14 is undoubted ly a late, theological gloss) he refers to the prophets, he has in mind seemingly only the old type of professional prophet, for whom quite clearly he still has a high regard as the legitimate agent of Yahweh. Apparently Isaiah and Micah were the first to draw this far-reaching distinction. On the one hand, Isaiah seemingly applied the title, נביא, consciously to himself, and, in direct contra diction to Amos, must have been the first non-professional prophet to do so, for in 8.3 he speaks of his wife as הנביאה. But, on the other hand, he denounces the professional prophet as the 9.14) נביא מורה שקר), "the prophet who makes false oracular utterances," and again in 28.7 and 29.10 he speaks of these pro fessional prophets with scathing contempt and denunciation. Micah too (3.5, 6, 11) held the professional prophets in the same low, contemptuous esteem. From that day on the distinction was clearly drawn, and the former professional prophets became now the false prophets, between whom and the prophets of the more exalted type only the bitterest and most zealous antagonism and mistrust existed. And yet, as has been intimated already, it would probably be not altogether correct or fair to these professional prophets to interpret this term, נביאי שקר, too literally. Undoubtedly there were among them many who were corrupt and specious and used their prophetic office for personal gain. But many among them must have been sincere and earnest and filled with high faith in their old, nationalistic concept of Yahweh and of His relation to and purpose for His people, Israel. They must have prophesied truly as they saw. Rather the difference between them and the great prophets was not so much a difference between true and false, as a difference between a narrow and a broad vision, between a persistent, nationalistic concept of Yahweh and His relation to Israel, which failed or refused to conceive of aught beyond the certain, ultimate victory and triumph of Yahweh over all other rival nationalis tic deities and the consequent ultimate triumph of Israel over the surrounding nations, and a far broader, universalistic concept of Yahweh and His relations,</page><page sequence="33">[33] AMOS STUDIES 51 That from the very beginning of his public ministrations Amos was fully aware that he was a divine messenger of an altogether new type, is, as has been said, self-evident. Two questions arise here; wherein did the novelty and uniqueness of Amos' message consist, and how had he become or been made conscious of the fact that it was a new and unique message and that he was a messenger of Yahweh of a new type and character? The answers to both questions are simple and ready to hand. not only with Israel, but also with other nations and all mankind, gradually unfolding through the successive great prophets until its culmination in the almost absolute universalism of Deutero-Isaiah, with his message of Yahweh as the one, solely existent world-god, and of divine world-purpose animating all of life and history. These considerations may help somewhat to fix the approximate date of the gloss in 1 Sam. 9.9, so important for the determination of the history of prophecy in Israel. Manifestly there נביא connotes the old type of professional prophet, whose function consisted for the most part of divining and soothsaying, much after the manner of the still older ראה, rather than the later, exalted type of prophet of whom Amos is an outstanding pattern. Clearly at the time of the insertion of this gloss into its present place the term, נביא, had not yet acquired its ultimate significance, as depicted above. Probably then the gloss comes from the period preceding somewhat the time of Amos, or at least of Isaiah. Similarly, however we may resolve the textual difficulties inherent in the passage, Num. 12.6-8 should be assigned to the period of Amos or Isaiah, for there quite manifestly a clear-cut distinction is drawn between two types of prophet, the lower and more numerous type, to whom alone the term, נביא, is here applied, and to whom Yahweh reveals His will and purpose in visions or dreams, and the other, far more exalted type, who operates only as a solitary individual and entirely without professional technique, with whom Yahweh rejects all the technique of professional prophecy, but to whom He speaks mouth to mouth, and whom likewise He permits to behold His own divine form and presence. This description of this higher type of prophet fits the case of Amos precisely, as will become increasingly clear in the course of these studies. And significantly too this higher type of prophet is designated by no term other than the extremely vague and general עבדי, "My servant." And of still further significance, the passage seems to picture a deep-rooted and aggressive antagonism between the two types of prophet, with, however, the initiative in the antagonism being taken here, just as, for example, in 1 Ki. 22.24 or Jer. 28, by the professional prophets. The passage clearly depicts conditions which must have developed in prophecy very soon after the time of Amos and Hosea, or perhaps a little more exactly, after the time of Isaiah and Micah, and should therefore in all likelihood be assigned to the end of the 8th or the beginning of the 7th century B.C.</page><page sequence="34">52 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [34] The novel feature of Amos' prophetic message to Israel was that it was a message of destruction and of doom, destruction and doom at Yahweh's own hands. Amos was unquestionably the very first to come with such a message from Yahweh. Not even Elijah, Amos' greatest predecessor, with whom Amos had manifestly so very much in common, had brought such a message. The utmost that Elijah had ventured to proclaim was the death of Ahab and Jezebel and the overthrow of their dynasty, not, however, in the manner of the professional prophets, as the result of political machination and intrigue, but as the will and through the direct processes of the judgment of Yahweh. But never once, so it would seem, had Elijah announced the doom of the nation, that Yahweh would cast His people off completely. This it remained for Amos, a century after Elijah, to proclaim. This was that which was basically novel in his message. This was what in particular distinguished Amos' message from the mes sage of the professional prophets, both in the preceding and in the subsequent age; for, as has been intimated already, theirs was the concept of a national Yahweh, closely and inseparably bound to His people, Israel, whose fortunes, whose existence, whose salvation were inseparably linked, yes were actually identical with their fortunes, their existence, their salvation. Theirs was likewise a message, broadly speaking, of national victory, national triumph, national ascendancy, national suprem acy for both Deity and people, the confident expectation of which was greatly confirmed by the political and economic developments of approximately the last half century. After the conquest of Damascus in 797 B.C. Israel would have been the next nation in the line of march of the Assyrian conqueror; and no one could deny that at just that moment Israel had not been strong and undoubtedly would have succumbed before the powerful invader. But the Assyrian had had to turn back without apparently setting foot in Israelite territory, certainly without working any extensive damage within the country; and since then the Assyrian had not ventured again into the vicinity of Yahweh's land. Who could have wrought all this but Yahweh Himself; and in so doing He had shown His preeminent power decisively, had manifested that He Himself was superior</page><page sequence="35">[35] AMOS STUDIES 53 even to Ashur, the powerful, all-conquering, national deity of Assyria. The political ascendancy and the economic progress which had followed almost uninterruptedly since that momentous day were further, indisputable evidence of Yahweh's power and supremacy and of His favor towards and His ultimate, high purpose for His people. Even greater achievements by Yahweh, greater triumphs over the other nations and their gods, greater prosperity and glory for Israel, more absolute and undisputed supremacy for both Deity and people were assured and, what was more, were very near. The Day of Yahweh could not be far off, the day of final and complete conquest and triumph and of absolute and enduring supremacy. So the nationalistic, professional prophets must have firmly believed and vigorously and ceaselessly proclaimed; and their words must have fallen upon receptive ears and have found firm lodgment in exultant hearts. To all this Amos brought an absolute and vigorous denial. To him, in theory at least, Yahweh was not a national, but rather a universal god, a world-deity. True, of the full, far-reaching implications of the concept of a universal world-god Amos had only the vaguest, most incomplete concept. It could not well be otherwise, for Amos was absolutely the pioneer in this alto gether new field of speculation, absolutely the very first to con ceive of a world-deity.53 It was enough that he evolved the concept in its barest and most rugged outlines. The corrolaries of the major proposition, the questions, for example, of the nature of Yahweh's positive relations as a world-god to other nations and to mankind in general, of Israel's relations to the other nations in the scheme of a world-god, with the resultant concept of a unified world, and of the relations of all the nations to each other, and of divine purpose for all mankind, these and other more remote implications Amos could not sense as yet. It needed time and rich, complex, historical experience and the thinking and consecrated meditation of successive generations of inspired prophets of the Amos type, to become clearly aware 53 For the conditions and forces which led to the evolution of the concept of a world-god at just this moment in history cf. my article, "World-Empire and World-Brotherhood," Menorah Journal, V (1919), 82-92.</page><page sequence="36">54 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [36] of all these and other parallel implications of the concept of a single world-god and to find, even with the help of prophetic inspiration, a positive and half-way satisfying answer to these, the deepest questions of life. Not until Deutero-Isaiah, or perhaps even Trito-Isaiah, was Judaism's definitive answer to these questions evolved. It was enough for Amos to have formulated the major proposition; we have no right to either demand of him or credit to him the perception of the corrolaries likewise as well as of their answers. But Amos' concept and message of Yahweh as a universal world-god, with all its incompleteness and crudeness, and even with his at times unconscious, inconsistent, but perfectly natural and comprehensible reversion to the terminology and concepts of national religion, were the very antithesis and the defiant challenge to the principles of national religion, of a nationalistic concept of Yahweh and His relations to and purpose for Israel, the complete denial and refutation of the message of the pro fessional prophets and of popular, exultant belief. The Day of Yahweh would come, of a surety, and come speedily; but it would be a day not of light but of deep darkness, not of victory but of defeat, not of Yahweh's elevation of Israel to a position of supremacy among and domination over the other nations, but of Yahweh's casting Israel off forever, His complete rejection and repudiation of His former people; and Israel, thus repudiated and left a people without a god, was certainly doomed to extinc tion; conquered by an irresistible enemy, sent against them by Yahweh Himself, the flower of the nation must perish in battle and the survivors must inevitably go into exile into a far distant, unclean land, unclean because Yahweh was not there, and there enslaved and oppressed, they must ultimately disappear from among the nations. What fate more dire than this could possibly be conceived for any nation? This was the Day of Yahweh and this Yahweh's present and final purpose with Israel, His former people, as Amos conceived and proclaimed it. The absolutely novel and unique nature of this message is self-evident. Of this Amos was fully conscious from the very beginning of his active career as a prophet. He knew therefore that in the most fundamental respects he was the very antithesis</page><page sequence="37">[37] AMOS STUDIES 55 of the professional prophet. Therefore he could and must reply to Amaziah's application to him of the titles נביא and חזה in the most absolute and unqualified manner that he was not at all a נביא nor one versed in the technique of prophecy, but that instead he spoke with larger and more indisputable authority, the authority of a personal call directly from Yahweh and a commission emanating immediately from Him and therefore inescapable, irresistible. How Amos had come to be aware of all this, how he had become conscious of his call, of the inavert able, irresistible nature of his divine commission, and of the broad content of the message of doom which he was charged by Yahweh to bring to Israel, all this will find its clear and con vincing answer in the analysis and interpretation of the visions. But in this connection one other matter of primé importance. How could Amos have arrived at, or at least how could he justify his proclamation of doom, his proclamation that Yahweh would completely and forever repudiate and reject His people, Israel? To the people at large such a message was unheard of and such a principle well-nigh incomprehensible. Manifestly completely ignorant of the original nature and historical evolution of the true concept of Yahweh and of the beginnings of His actual relationship with Israel, they conceived of Him, practically at least, and in a manner resulting most naturally from at least four centuries of unbroken relations with Him, as their natural god, whose relations with them were indissoluble, who was their god from of old, yes, from the very beginning of their existence as a nation, through whose favor toward them and whose power ful, irresistible championing of their cause they had successfully resisted and overcome seemingly unconquerable enemies, the Egyptians, the Emorites, the Philistines, and most recently, at least so it must have seemed in the light of present circumstances, the Syrians. It was He at whose inviolable bidding the Assyrian conqueror had been compelled to turn back, and who in most recent days had given victory to Israel's arms at Lo-Debar and Karnaim. His fortunes and His role among the gods were indis solubly bound up with their fortunes and their role among the nations; His very existence was coterminous with their existence. Yahweh without Israel was as inconceivable, unreal as Israel</page><page sequence="38">56 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [38] without Yahweh. So ran popular belief, insofar as it meditated upon these matters at all instead of accepting these conclusions, as it undoubtedly did, unquestioningly, unconsciously and unqualifiedly. But somehow Amos was conscious of, or at least vaguely sensed, a relationship between Yahweh and Israel resting upon a foundation altogether different from that which unquestioning, uninquiring, popular belief conceived of and unreservedly accepted. Somehow he was aware that Israel's basic relationship with Yahweh was not a natural and eternal relationship, but rather that it was what might well be termed an artificial relation ship, a relationship of adoption rather than of creation of Israel by Yahweh. In all likelihood this awareness sprang not so much from a definite and exact knowledge of Israel's actual historical antecedents in the days of Moses and immediately thereafter as from his basic concept of Yahweh as a world-god, a universal deity, whose basic relations must have been with nations at large and therefore, who, if He had particularistic relations with any one people and nation, must have had these through choice of some kind, through singling out that one nation as His par ticular people and the object of his particular solicitude, pro tection and favor. But be the basis of his belief what it may, perhaps a vague consciousness of actual historical antecedents combined with a drawing of conclusions from his fundamental concept of Yahweh as a world-god, certain it is that Amos conceived of Yahweh's relations with Israel as by no means primary, natural and indissoluble. Rather he conceived of them, as has been said, as artificial, resulting from a process of choice or adoption of Israel by Yahweh, as based upon a covenant established by Yahweh with Israel at the very beginning of their relations, at the moment of the beginning of Israel's actual history. The record of this covenant, in a number of versions varying from each other only in incidental details, is written clearly in all the documents of the Hexateuch, K, C, E, D and P, with the single apparent exception of J.54 From Amos on through practically all the prophets, as well as in much of the « Cf. "The Oldest Document of the Hexateuch," HUCA, IV (1927), 1-138.</page><page sequence="39">[39] AMOS STUDIES 57 other biblical literature, it plays an ominipresent and funda mental role. This doctrine of the covenant-relationship between Yahweh and Israel is basic to the theology and to the message of all the prophets from Amos through Jeremiah, and even, though in not quite the same direction or degree, through Tri to Isaiah and Malachi. But actually a covenant is a compact between two contract ing parties, by which each obligates himself to the other. Each binds himself by this compact to do for the other something which is supremely desirable to that other and which presum ably he can not do or achieve for himself, at least not by his own, unaided efforts. Such a compact is obviously dissoluble, at least for cause. If either of the two contracting parties violates his part of the mutual obligation, if, particularly over an extended period of time, he persists in disregarding the duties and tasks which he has assumed, if he obstinately refuses to heed the repeated warnings which the other contracting party has com municated to him and defiantly carries on in his self-willed, irresponsible manner, then certainly the other contracting party, convinced at last that there is no further hope that his partner will resume and faithfully discharge his contractual obligations, is fully justified in repudiating the covenant and terminating completely his relations with the first party. Nay more, under the strict application of the principles of justice this second party, thus injured by the failure of the other to fulfill his cov enant-obligations, is entitled to damages and either to himself inflict or to have inflicted for him punishment upon the irrespon sible and guilty first party.ss Precisely such Amos conceived Yahweh's relations with Israel to be. Yahweh was the world-god, therefore with dominion over all peoples. He it was who had brought not only Israel from Egypt, but likewise Aram from Kir and the Philistines from Kaftor and settled each nation in its own land. In the final analysis therefore Israel is to Yahweh no different than are the other nations, even the Kushites, the slave-people, the 55 Cf., for example, Ex. 21.7-11; 22.1; Deut. 22.13-21; more clearly in the Code of Hammurapi, passim.</page><page sequence="40">58 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [40] lowliest of all nations. But for some reason best known to Himself, Yahweh had had a particular fondness for Israel and so had taken Israel as His own nation, had known it more intimately and more dearly than any other nation or people, had established a convenant with it and had called it endearingly, "My people, Israel." Israel had accepted this covenant-relationship, all its terms and obligations, had bound itself to worship Yahweh and Him alone and to live punctiliously and in all details the life which was dear to Yahweh and which He demanded that His people should live. But in time Israel had become rebellious and disobedient. More and more it disregarded its covenant-obliga tion and went in devious ways. It accorded homage to other deities and above all else, at least from the standpoint of Amos, it gave itself to ways of life which Yahweh had not commanded and which were in direct contravention and open defiance of all that was dear to Yahweh and to which He had by the cov enant obligated Israel. It practiced upon a steadily increasing scale social injustice and licentiousness and wantoness, the very acts and manner of living which were most abhorrent to Yahweh. Yahweh had borne with His people patiently and considerately, hoping that they might turn from their evil, irresponsible ways and return to Him and to His covenant. He had sent His servants unto them, prophets56 and nazirites, to teach and, particularly in the case of the nazirites,57 to exemplify, the simple, unostentatious, culturally relatively backward life which He would have His people live. But the people had openly and rebelliously flouted the nazirites and forced them to drink wine and had silenced the prophets with the command not to 56 That Amos himself had as yet no quarrel with the professional prophets, even though he knew himself to be not one of them, and in particular that he himself did not regard them as false messengers of Yahweh but rather looked upon them still as legitimate agents of the Deity, we have shown already. 57 Cf. Jeremiah's use of the Rechabites, themselves actually nazirites in their abstention from wine, to illustrate faithful conformity to the life which Yahweh had ordained (Jer. 35). The illustration set forth in the last two sentences of the text assumes that Am. 2.11a and 12 are genuine; however, this is by no means absolutely certain, as the subsequent investigation will show.</page><page sequence="41">[41] AMOS STUDIES 59 prophesy. He had sent repeated warnings to His people of the dire consequences which might be in store for them did they persist in their evil, faithless ways, famine, drought, ruination of crops, pestilence, warfare and earthquake, so that Israel was left, after the Aramaean wars for example, like a brand snatched from the flame. But all in vain. He had hoped yearningly after each such warning visitation that Israel might take heed and understand and turn from its evil way and return unto Him, its God, and resume its proper covenant-relations with Him; and had it done so, so the unmis takable implication is, He would have accepted its repentance, would have let it return to Him, would have permitted it to resume its covenant-relations with Him, because Israel was dear to Hip1&gt; and it only of all the peoples of the earth had He known so intimately. But all to no avail. Israel was stubborn, rebellious, self-willed, bent upon its way regardless of its cov enant-obligations to Yahweh. And now at last, convinced that Israel was hopeless, that it would never return and conform to its part of the covenant with Him, He was determined to repu diate the covenant, to cast off Israel. Never again would He forgive His people; never again would He let it return to Him; now the die was cast, the doom was assured. Now let Israel prepare to meet its God, its God who now demanded and was making ready to execute judgment upon it for its faithlessness to the covenant. Cast off by Yahweh, without a god to protect it any longer, Israel was surely doomed. Nay more, Yahweh would proceed actively against it; He would send a conquering enemy against it, to invade its land and conquer its cities, to butcher its youths and lead away the survivors into exile and slavery in a distant land, there to be forgotten, perhaps even to speedily perish completely. Rejected by Yahweh, Israel would at the very least revert to its original condition, would again become in Yahweh's sight like the Aramaeans or the Philistines or even the lowly and despised Kushites, the slave-people. Such was the tenor of Amos' message, well-unified, thorough, con vincing. Manifestly the conception of the covenant-relationship between Yahweh and Israel was basic to this message, con stituted the starting-point from which Amos advanced to his</page><page sequence="42">60 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [42] complete, well-rounded gospel of destruction and doom for Israel. With these considerations in mind, just as they must have been present in Amos' own mind at the moment, we can under stand the more clearly the complete import of Amos' emphatic reply to Amaziah that he was not a נביא, not a professional prophet. His answer was much more than a mere denial that he was a member of a group or caste of professional prophets and that he was initiated in the technique of professional prophecy. It was also and preeminently a repudiation and rejection of the traditional message of professional prophecy, the message of a nationalistic Yahweh and assured national triumph and national supremacy over all Israel's ancient enemies; it summed up and set forth the supreme, indisputable authorization for his message of the doom of Israel. It was indeed an effective answer. Yet if this answer had consisted only of 7.14-15, it would manifestly have been incomplete and indecisive. Two points still remain unconsidered, two questions unanswered. Even though Amos had affirmed that his message was not like that of the professional prophets, that theirs was an unjustified message of national triumph while his was a message of national doom, he had not yet indicated how he became or was made aware that Yahweh's message to Israel through him was such a message of doom. And even more obvious is the fact that he had not yet replied to Amaziah's command not to prophesy further at Bethel, but instead to return to his Judaean home, by the affirmation that it was impossible for him to obey this command, since it emanated only from a mere earthly official, a creature of flesh and blood, himself involved in Yahweh's impending general destruction of the nation, while Amos, on the other hand, was responsible to and must obey unquestioningly and undeviatingly a far higher power, Yahweh Himself. True, in 7.16-17 he denounced Amaziah for bidding him desist from prophesying and announced his unhappy fate at Yahweh's hands; but this was actually only a defiance of Amaziah, and not at all a statement of why Amos could not obey his command, even were he inclined to do so.</page><page sequence="43">[43] AMOS STUDIES 61 But when we insert 3.3-8 between 7.15 and 16 we see not only how perfectly it fits there, in both its beginning and its end, but also how completely it supplies the missing ànswers to these two essential questions. Budde has very correctly emphasized the fact that, with the single exception of the first figure of speech, that in v. 3, all the other parallelisms in 3.3-8 produce an effect of horror and fear. They speak of death, of capture and consumption of the weak by the powerful, irresis tible, natural enemy, of utter helplessness before mysterious, unknown danger and the stark terror resulting therefrom, of the inevitability of the law of cause and effect, with Yahweh as the ultimate cause and with destruction and terror and doom impliedly His obvious purpose. This is the tenor of the message which Yahweh has communicated to Amos and which He has bidden him to go and speak against His people Israel, this message of foreboding and doom, and not the message of national triumph and exultation and glory which the professional prophets mistakenly bring. Now it is clear how Amos has come at this novel, strange, hitherto unheard and startling message of doom, of Yahweh's complete rejection of His formerly beloved people. And still more emphatically in the concluding half-verse of this passage we have Amos' answer to Amaziah's command not to prophesy further; "Yahweh has spoken; who then, to whom Yahweh has spoken in this manner, can refrain from prophesy ing?" Even in the face of the commands of the very highest earthly officials, he must do Yahweh's bidding, must deliver his message unto its very end, must prophesy and prophesy still further until his mission is completely fulfilled. Now Amaziah has his answer. And in proof thereof that he can not desist, that so long as Yahweh speaks to him and through him he needs must prophesy, he turns upon Amaziah himself with his final word, "And now you hearken to the word of Yahweh; you say, do not prophesy against Israel nor inveigh, oracularly against the house of Jacob; just because of this thus hath Yahweh said," etc. Nowack, Marti and other scholars after them have commented, and cor rectly, upon the significant and effective contrast here between</page><page sequence="44">6262 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [44] "Thou sayest" of v. 16 and "Therefore thus hath Yahweh said" of v. 17. But, with 3.3-8 inserted here, there is still another contrast here, presented in effective chiastic form, a contrast deeper and far more significant. It is between יהוה דבר מי לא ינבא of 3.8b and ועתה שמע דבר יהוה of 7.16a; it is likewise between יהוה דבר מי לא ינבא of 3.8b and אתה אמר לא תנבא of 7.16ba;" Yahweh hath spoken; who then can refrain from prophesying," and "And now you hearken to the word of Yahweh, this final word, which has not yet been spoken and which concerns you yourself directly"; and again, "Yahweh hath spoken; who then can refrain from prophesying" and "You say, do not prophesy." The withering scorn and contempt for Amaziah, despite his high office, surpassing far the condescending contempt which Amaziah had a moment before previously manifested for this seeming professional prophet, is felt in every word. In this short but bitter struggle between these two, not ordinary men, but men symbolic of two basically antagonistic forces and principles of existence, Amaziah symbolic of the king, whose officer he was and in whose name and interests he spoke, and of the nation whose doom had been spoken but which refused to hearken or to accept the message, and Amos, symbolic of Yahweh Himself, whose chosen messenger he was, and of the divine control of existence, of the destiny of men and nations, and of the law of righteousness and justice by which Yahweh had meant that His people and, as a world-god, all mankind, should live, this answer turns the tables utterly upon Amaziah and all that he represents and gives the victory unmistakably and decisively to Amos and to Yahweh. We can readily imagine the effect upon the throng of bystanders, gathered in vast numbers at the foremost national sanctuary for the celebration of the main festival of the year, as they beheld the chief priest of the temple, undoubtedly one of the highest officials of the land, thus denounced, discomfited and vanquished by this humble stranger. Of a surety they must have come to realize at last, in the words of a later prophet,58 that "a prophet had been among them," a prophet of different stature and authority than the professional s' Ezek. 2.5:33.33.</page><page sequence="45">[45] AMOS STUDIES 63 prophets whom they knew so well and held in such low esteem. We can picture Amos turning now to depart, his message delivered in full, his victory won, his authority recognized, and conviction, for the moment at least, sinking deeply into the hearts of the people at large, to whom, in the last analysis, his message had really been directed. We can see in our mind's eye the crowds respectfully making way for this dread prophet, Yahweh's messenger of doom for them. And we can see Amos returning slowly and with dignity to his Judaean home, conscious that he has fulfilled his divine commission faithfully, but return ing likewise sadly and humbly, for it has been a commission of doom and rejection by Yahweh of His people. But all this is implicit and becomes apparent only with the insertion of 3.3-8 between 7.15 and 16. Without the insertion the passage 7.10-17 is strong unquestionably, but unquestion ably also incomplete in its full argument. With the insertion, however, not only is the argument rounded out completely but also the passage becomes infinitely stronger and more illuminât ing and convincing. And when we come to realize in the course of this study that this scene which we have just depicted with all its dramatic force is the closing moment, not of a prophetic career extending over several months at least and perhaps over several years, as the vast majority of biblical scholars would have it, and expressing itself in numerous scattered, more or less independent, unrelated speeches and utterances, but of a prophetic career the active expression of which was summed up in a single day, yes in a single hour or half hour and in one single, closely unified, supremely powerful address, we realize all the more the force of this dramatic climax and its effect upon the people in the reenforcement of the prophet's word. There can scarcely be any doubt that the insertion of 3.3-8 between 7.15 and 16 is completely justified and as certain as any such subjective procedure may be. And this conclusion is confirmed when we consider the entire passage as a whole in its literary form with 3.3-8 inserted between 7.15 and 16.</page><page sequence="46">64 JULIAN MORGENSTERN 7.10 וישלח אמציה כהן בית־אל אל־ירבעם מלךישראל לאמר קשר עליך עמוס בקרב בית־ישראל לא־תוכל הארץ להכיל 11 את־כל־דבריו: כי כה אמר עמוס בחרב ימות ירבעם וישראל 12 גלה יגלה מעל אדמתו: ויאמר אמציה אל־עמוס חזה לך 13 ברח־לך אל־ארץ יהודה ואכל־שם לחם ושם תנבא: ובית אל לא־תוסיף עוד להנבא כי מקדש־מלך 1 ] ובית ממלכה 14 הוא: ויען עמוס ויאמר אל־אמציה לא־נביא אנכי ולא בךגביא 1 t כי־*נוקד אנכי ובולס שקטים: 15 ויקחני יהוה מאחרי־הצאן ויאמר אלי לך הנבא *על־עמי ישראל: 3.3 הילכו שנים יחדו בלתי־אם נועדו: 4 הישאג אריה ביער וטרף איךלו היתן כפיר קולו נ ] בלתי־אם לכד: 5 התפול צפור על־ג !הארץ *ומוקשאיךלה: היעלה פח מךהאדמה ולכוד לא־ילכוד: 6 אס־יתקע שופר *בשער ועם לא־יחרדו אס־תהיה רעה בעיר ויהוה לא־עשה: 1 ] אריה שאג מי־לא יירא 1 1 יהוה דבר מי־לא ינבא: ועתה שמע דבר־יהוה אתה אמר לא תנבא על־ישראל ולא תטיף על־בית־*יעקב לכן כה־אמר יהוה אשתך בעיר *תענה ובניך בחרב יפלו ואדמתך בחבל תחלק ואתה על־אדמה־טמאה תמות: 1 ] והוא] [אנכי] *בוקר *אל [מטענתו] !פח] *ומוקש *בעיר 17כי לא יעשה אדני יהוה דבר כי אבתלה סודו אל־עבדיו הנביאים:] [אדני] *ישחק *תזנה !וישראל גלה יגלה מעל אדמתו! The unity of the complete passage is self-evident and its artistry is startling in its effect. It is significant that Amos' actual words are cast in rhythmic, poetic form coupled with prounounced parallelism of the members, while, in pointed con trast, the words of Amaziah are in prose. Even more than this,</page><page sequence="47">[47] AMOS STUDIES 65 and proving beyond question that this difference in literary form is not at all accidental, is the fact that when Amaziah reports Amos' words to the king in 7.11, he turns the undoubtedly original, rhythmic form of Amos' words into commonplace prose. On the other hand, when in 7.16 Amos repeats Amaziah's command to him not to prophesy further, spoken originally in ordinary prose (7.12-13), he immediately, and perhaps uncon sciously, casts it into characteristic poetic form, in two measures of three beats each, marked by a striking double parallelism of the members: לא תנבא על־ישראל ולא תטיף על־בית־יעקב. The dominant measure in which Amos' prophetic words are cast is that of three beats, but with two-beat measures used frequently and effectively. Thus in 7.14 the prophet begins his answer to Amaziah with the sharp, staccato, two-beat measure, 2+2, 2 + 2, but immediately in v. 15, where he recounts Yahweh's procedure with him, he advances to three three-beat measures, 3+3+3. Then in 3.3-6 he combines the two measures effectively in the form 3+2, 3+2,59 with the exception of v. 3, where there is only a single 3+2,60 and thus, with the short, staccato, two beat second measures in each strophe he adds greatly to the effect of horror and terror which the series of figures, as has been already indicated, was, consciously or unconsciously, intended to produce. And finally, in 3.8, at the end of his reply proper to Amaziah's command not to prophesy further, where he draws the far-reaching conclusion of his argument and thus reaches the climax of his thought, Amos returns most effectively to the 2+2, 2+2 measure with which he had begun his answer to Amaziah. Then in 7.16-17, where first he repeats, though in his own words, Amaziah's command to him not to prophesy, and then turns upon Amaziah with his final, withering denuncia tion and pronouncement of personal doom, spoken as Yahweh's actual words, Amos again reverts to the dominant 3+3, 3+3 s» Or should in the second half of each couplet the negative particle be re. garded as a separate beat? In such case the second half of each of these couplets would consist of three beats, precisely as does the first half of each couplet. Nevertheless the staccato effect produced by these short, one-syllable, oft repeated, negative particles is unmistakable. 60 The reason for which will be considered shortly; cf. also above, pp. 31-32.</page><page sequence="48">66 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [48] measure.61 The effective, metrical unity of the entire passage is beyond all question. And one final and most significant consideration. As has been said, a question long at issue among biblical scholars has been who are the two who walk together, referred to in 3.3. For many years the dominant interpretation was that the two were Yahweh and Israel, His people. The majority of recent biblical scholars incline, however, to the view that the two are Yahweh and His prophet. With 3.3-8 inserted between 7.15 and 16 the answer to this important question becomes simple, decisive and significant. In 7.12 Amaziah commands Amos, לך ברח לך אל־ארץ יהודה. In 7.15 Amos tells that Yahweh has commanded him, לך הנבא על־עמי ישראל. The two commands to the prophet to go, לך, are diametrically opposed to each other. That of Yahweh bids Amos go from his native country to the land of Israel; that of Amaziah from the land of Israel back to his native land. That of Yahweh bids Amos go and prophesy; that of Amaziah bids him go away and desist from prophesying. Which command to go will Amos obey, that of Amaziah or that of Yahweh; with which of the two will he go or walk? In the light of this dramatic situation, and particularly following immediately upon Amos' statement of Yahweh's charge to him to go and prophesy, as it does when 3.3 follows immediately upon 7.15, Amos' initial question becomes doubly significant, "Can two walk together, without having come together for common purpose?" Is it possible for him to walk with Amaziah, to conform to his command, when between them there is not the slightest point of agreement, when in all that they represent they are the very antitheses of each other? Rather, is it not the other command to go, the command of Yahweh, between whom and himself, as the subsequent argument shows convincingly, there is perfect agreement and understanding, which he must under any conditions and at all costs irresistibly obey? The connection is obvious and the import of the two contrasted commands to Amos to go and his reply thereto are most striking. 61 In v. 17ba it is necessary to read על־אדסה טמאה as one beat; but despite the length of this beat it presents no particular difficulty. In fact trial will show that this measure can not well be read otherwise.</page><page sequence="49">[49] AMOS STUDIES 67 Moreover, thus interpreted the full force of 3.3 becomes increasingly apparent, and the reason becomes manifest just why this verse is cast in the single 3 + 3 measure instead of the double 3+3 with the regular parallelism of the members. This verse does not offer at all the first in the series of instances of the inevitability of the law of cause and effect. It does not deal with cause and effect at all. Instead it deals with what precedes and the two commands to Amos to go presented there. Its affinities of thought are rather, or at least as much, with 7.15 as with what follows immediately, and its single 3+3 measure might be regarded as in a way complementing the otherwise in this passage unparalleled 3 + 3 + 3 measure of 7.15. And so the evidence seems to be cumulative and decisive that originally 3.3-8 stood between 7.15 and 16. And here, for the present at least, this matter may rest. How 3.3-8 came to be displaced from its original setting to its present location is an interesting, though not necessarily a significant question, one which we may consider in its proper place. But whether a satisfying and definitive answer may be found for this question or not does not affect in the least the validity of the conclusion to which we have come regarding the original position of this dislocated passage. Still less does the question as to the authorship of this par ticular passage affect this conclusion, whether Amos himself was the author or some third, unknown party, a friend or disciple or amanuensis of Amos. Certainly the passage in this, its expanded form, contains the authentic words which the prophet spoke at this supreme, critical moment of his prophetic career, when everything which he championed was challenged and stood at stake. At the very most the merest narrative framework could have emanated from another hand. But even this is by no means certain ; and this question too will bear further and more detailed consideration in due time. For the present we may pass on to the study of those other sections of the Book of Amos which give us a further and even deeper insight into the workings of the prophet's mind and spirit and the nature of his prophetic call and how he himself con ceived of and interpreted it, the visions.</page><page sequence="50">68 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [50] III The Visions At the very beginning of his penetrating and significant study of Amos Weiser makes the statement that the uniqueness of Amos is to be explained from the uniqueness of his personal experience and of the relationship of this to his prophetic utter ances. The point of approach is the interpretation of the visions. This is correct beyond all question. More even than the record of his contest with Amaziah, and that even in the form to which we have expanded it, do the visions, properly interpreted, give us a deep insight into the inner workings of the prophet's mind and soul and an understanding, or at least an intimation, of the forces and motivations which impelled him irresistibly to his prophetic career. And in so doing they give us likewise a com prehension of the psychological bases of the new prophecy, of which Amos was the first outstanding exponent. However, the interpretation of these five visions is anything but simple and sure. In the first place, as we shall see, three of the five visions are in exceedingly fragmentary state. In the second place, in the extant text of the visions quite a number of textual corruptions are manifest, some of a character so far reaching as to affect vitally the precise interpretation of the visions. In the third place, even after a reasonably certain text has been reconstructed there is still abundant room for wide latitude of interpretation of the very fundamentals of the visions. The result has been that with perhaps no other section of the entire Bible has there been such a wide range of textual recon struction and attendant interpretation as just in connection with these five visions. Within the last twelve years two studies of the book and the work of Amos have dealt with the visions in particular in unusually authoritative and illuminating manner. In his "Zu Text und Auslegung des Bûches Amos"62 that great and gentle biblical scholar, Budde, has summarized in masterful manner the textual emendations and interpretations of the visions up 6נ JBL, XLIII (1924), 46-131; XLIV (1925), 63-122.</page><page sequence="51">[51] AMOS STUDIES 69 to the time of his own writing and then proceeded to give his own emendations and interpretation with an acumen, con servatism and authority which betoken the truly great scholar. His work is unquestionably the sanest and most responsible interpretation of the visions to date. A few years later Weiser published the most extensive and, as a psychological study, the most penetrating investigation of the book and the work of Amos that they have as yet received.63 The work is concerned primarily with a psychological study of prophecy in general and of Amos in particular. In consequence the analysis and inter pretation of the visions form not only the starting-point but also the main theme of Weiser's investigation. The chief value of the work lies in just this emphasis upon the psychological element in the study of the prophet, a matter overlooked more or less completely by the majority of biblical scholars in their predilection for textual criticism, and in its stimulus and sug gestion. Actually, as we shall see, the main conclusions to which Weiser comes and the general interpretation of the visions which he gives are quite untenable. But despite this his work is of deep significance for the study of Amos. The first vision is preserved in most complete form of all the five visions. It deals with a plague of locusts. As the vast majority of scholars have realized, this plague of locusts is only in pre paration or anticipation when Amos is made to behold it and promptly intercedes in behalf of Jacob, with his plea, סלח־נא. The plea is effective, and Yahweh desists from His intention. This plea, סלח־נא, is significant when contrasted with the parallel plea, חד־ל־נא, in Vision II. The implication of this second plea, "desist," is that, precisely as the preceding portion of Vision II states explicitly, the work of destruction has already begun and is well under way at the moment when Amos presents his sup plication. But in contrast thereto the implication of the plea, סלח־נא, "forgive," is that the work of destruction is not yet actually under way, but is only in contemplation, or rather in preparation. Obviously therefore there is a definite climactic progress in this respect from Vision I to Vision II. This must '3 Die Projette des Amos (Beiheft z. ZA W, 53), 1929.</page><page sequence="52">70 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [52] be kept constantly in mind in the interpretation of Vision I in particular, and within the confines of Vision I especially in con nection with two moot points. In 7.1a for יוצר of MT LXX reads ־6.יצר• Hoffmann was the first to accept the LXX reading in preference to that of MT, and in this many subsequent scholars have followed him.65 With the versions they interpret צר גבי! as "a formation {Brut) of locusts," i.e. locusts just emerging from the larva-state. The majority of these scholars then go on to emend לקש in lb to ילק. They then interpret this portion of the verse thus, "And behold a formation of locusts (גבי) at the beginning of the coming up66 of the aftergrowth, and behold (it had become) full-grown locusts (ילק) after the royal shearings." Apparently these scholars have been misled by Driver's excursus on Locusts in his commentary, and not improb ably also on the part of some by an irresistible impulse to display excessive critical acumen by extreme emendations and inter pretations. Unfortunately, however, for this daring hypothesis, צר! never has precisely the meaning which these scholars would ascribe to it here. This interpretation which the versions would give to יוצר of MT is manifestly the result of a late theologizing of the passage, an attempt to remove Yahweh Himself as an active agent so far from these visions as possible.67 Even more 6וי So also Pesh. and Targ. 65 Guthe, Wellhausen, Ldhr, Cheyne, Marti, H. Schmidt, Hdlscher, Sellin, Weiser and others. 66 Or, with Baumann, omitting חחלת, "at the time of the growth," etc. 6ד This theologizing process is precisely the opposite to that which Weiser posits and which he makes one of the main pillars of his entire argument and conclusions. He contends that in Visions I-IV Amos does not see Yahweh at all, but in I—II natural phenomena and in III—IV ordinary objects of daily life which any normal person might perceive. What was distinctive and unique for Amos, and therefore what distinguished him from ordinary mortals, was not the actual sight of these phenomena and objects but the apperception of the import of these visions and of the divine purpose behind them. Only in V does Amos actually behold Yahweh in action; and just this is one of the circum stances which make V different from the others and the climax of all the visions. Weiser then contends that the introduction of Yahweh as a present reality and active force in the events narrated in the visions in MT of I-IV</page><page sequence="53">[53] AMOS STUDIES 71 disastrous for this hypothesis is the fact that there is not the slightest evidence that גבי means "locusts just emerging from the larvae and preparatory to their developing into that stage called ילק." In the only other biblical passage in which the word (as indicated by the participles in 7.1, 4, 7 and ובידו אנך in 7) is the result of a late, theologizing process which seeks apparently to represent Yahweh as the prime active and creative force in all the conditions, events and phenomena of existence. This argument of Weiser is astounding in that it not only has no foundation whatever in fact, but also is quite contrary thereto. The only possi ble evidence upon which Weiser might perhaps have supported his argument is the indubitable fact that in the time of Amos the belief was generally current that for ordinary man to gaze upon Yahweh's face or person meant death (cf. Ex. 33.18-23; 1 Ki. 19.13 and the interpretation of these passages given in my "The Oldest Document of the Hexateuch," HUCA, IV [1927], 10-54; cf. also Isa. 6.5) ; therefore it might be doubted whether in Visions I-IV Amos actu ally sees Yahweh Himself. But the fact remains that, despite his first fear, Isaiah does in his vision actually behold Yahweh enthroned in the Temple, and he emerges from this experience unharmed. Likewise, as we have just seen, the import of Num. 12.6-8 is that the prophet of the new and higher type actually beholds Yahweh in person and speaks with Him mouth to mouth. Furthermore, Weiser himself admits that in Vision V Amos too actually beholds Yahweh. Of course, Weiser argues that in Visions I-II Amos is still an ordinary person (and this despite his contention that Amos has been able to perceive divine import and purpose behind even these two first visions, something which, he contends, the ordinary man could not perceive) and that he rises to prophetic stature only with Vision III. Nevertheless Weiser maintains that even in Visions III-IV Amos does not yet behold Yahweh but only in Vision V. The inconsistency of this argument is self-evident. Accordingly, even though at first glance it might seem to possess some validity, Weiser's argument must be rejected. Actually the process of theological evolution was in precisely the opposite direction to that which Weiser posits, as the biblical evidence demonstrates overwhelmingly. As is well-known, the tendency was to de-anthropomorphize and transcendentalize the concept of Yahweh and to remove Him farther and farther from participation as an active, working, creative agent in the affairs of ordinary life. Thus, in the visions of Zechariah the Deity Himself no longer contacts the prophet but employs an angel, or even a host of angels, as agents and mediators. The classic and convincing illustration of this process is, of course, manifest in the comparison of the two creation stories, that of J in Gen. 2.5-24, where Yahweh actually still functions, just as here, as the יוצר, "the potter; the fashioner" (cf. vv. 7 and 19; also Isa. 45.7, 18; 64.7; Jer. 10.12 16; Zech. 12.1) and the primary P version of creation in Gen. 1.1-2.4 (cf. my "The Sources of the Creation Story—Gen. 1.1-2.4," AJSL, XXXVI [1920],</page><page sequence="54">72 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [54] occurs, Nah. 3.17, the גובי appear along with the ארבה, the customary term for and presumably therefore the commonest kind of locust, as a particularly destructive species. ילק likewise occurs in the same passage (v. 16), presumably as an altogether different species of locust. There does not appear the slightest ground for the assumption that גבי as they mature become ילק. Accordingly we must retain the reading יוצר of MT,M and like wise, with the majority of scholars, regard lb as an explanatory gloss defining precisely what the rare,6® and not improbably by the time of the glossator obsolete, term לקש meant. More interesting and significant is the emendation and interpretation of 2a. That emendation is necessary is self-evident. The vast majority of scholars have accepted unqualifiedly the emendation of והיה אם כלה, first proposed by Torrey,70 ויהי הא מבלה ; and indeed this does involve a minimum of textual change and emendation. Weiser, however, seems to feel something 169-212), where Yahweh creates, no longer by the quite anthropomorphic process of fashioning things with His own hands, but rather by fiat, by merely uttering His divine command, at which things automatically come into being (cf. also Ps. 33.6; 104.30; 148.1-5). This evidence, which might, were it needed, be multiplied greatly, is self-evident and conclusive. The true course of theo logical evolution in Judaism is clearly apparent. And the realization of this leads in turn to a conclusion the very opposite to that which Weiser seeks to estab lish, viz. that the reading צר! of the versions in place of the original יוצר of MT was the result of precisely this de-anthropomorphizing process of late Jewish theology and represents an attempt to remove Yahweh as an active, working agent from this vision. Certainly יוצר of MT, and not ר^! of the ver sions, is original here (so Harper, Nowack). 68 Duhm would read יוצא for יוצר ("And behold גובי were coming forth [from the larval"); this is accepted by both Sellin and Budde. But it is surprising indeed that scholars so competent as these should conceive or approve of this emendation, inasmuch as the resultant reading is impossible Hebrew. After הנה or והנה the subject must follow immediately, either expressed or implicit in the participle itself. In no case whatever may the participle precede the ex pressed subject, as would manifestly be the case in the reading proposed by Duhm. The full import of this rule of Hebrew syntax for the reconstruction of the text and the interpretation of these visions will become fully apparent very shortly. 6» Found only here. י» JBL, XIII (1894), 63.</page><page sequence="55">[55] AMOS STUDIES 73 amiss in this reading, though precisely what it may be he does not define, and endeavors to meet the situation by omitting לאכל. What he senses is apparently that ויהי הא מכלה לאכל את־עשב הארץ can mean only, "And it was just about to completely con sume, or to finish consuming the herbage," whereas, as we have seen, the manifest import of Vision I is that the work of destruction is only in contemplation and preparation, but has not yet actually begun, at the moment of Amos' intercession. But certainly the omission of לאכל does not approach in any way nearer to the desired meaning. Sensing this Gressmann cleverly proposes to emend still further and read ויהי הא מחל לאבל, an emendation which is half-way accepted by Budde. But this carries the process of emendation rather far. A much simpler and better emendation, one which departs from the text of MT no further than, if quite as far as does that of Torrey, is to read, והיה הא מכלה לאכל את־עשב הארץ. This involves no more than the insertion of a single letter, ה, after והיה, a letter which may well have been lost by haplography, if lost at all. The mean ing would then be, "And its purpose was to completely consume," etc., literally, "And it was to be one which would completely con sume." Normally we would expect והיה הא למכלה לאכל; but with this reading the double occurrence of the preposition ל at the beginning of two successive words, and perhaps also the four occurrences of the ל in these two words might well be regarded as dissonant. At any rate the omission of the preposition ל in precisely such a construction as this, and with precisely this same implication, "And it should be a ", is amply attested.71 Actually, if the meaning of the passage were at all that which most scholars would ascribe to it, viz. "And just as it was on the point of completely consuming, etc.," it would have to read, ויהי הא מכלה לאכל את־עשב הארץ ואנכי אמרתי or והנה אנכי אמרתי ; i. e. the second clause would have to be a nominal clause, introduced 1י Isa. 11.5; 32.17; Jer. 17.7; Mic. 5.4; Obad. 18. This last instance is partie ularly illuminating, since in this single v. this construction occurs three times, twice without ל and once with it. Not impossibly in the one case the ל may have been omitted before להבה in order to avoid the awkward contiguity of two ל 's, a situation much the same as here.</page><page sequence="56">74 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [56] frequently by והנה for the sake of heightened vividness.72 All these considerations show that it is impossible to read here anything other than והיה. But this in turn establishes beyond all doubt that the meaning implied in Vision I is not at all, "And just as they were about to completely consume the herbage, I said, etc.," but, just as we have proposed, "And they were intended to be complete consumers of the herbage. And I said, etc." Manifestly ואמר is not the continuation within the same sentence of והיה הא מכלה לאבל, for, as has been shown, had this meaning been intended the sentence would have to read ואנכי אמרתי; instead ואמר begins an absolutely new and independent sentence. But this resultant meaning of the emended passage, והיה הא מכלה לאכל, "And it was intended to consume the herbage completely," establishes with positive certainty the necessity of retaining the reading יוצר of MT at the beginning of the vision, with, of course, Yahweh Himself understood as the subject. Vision I tells, simply, naturally, concisely and most vividly that Amos sees Yahweh at work fashioning locusts which were intended by Him to consume all the herbage completely. But realizing all that this would mean in the way of calamity and suffering for Jacob, the prophet intercedes; and moved by his intercession, Yahweh interrupts His creative work before it has been com pleted or the actual work of destruction has even begun. This is unquestionably the meaning of Vision I. Within Vision I the text is now complete and perfect in every way, with perhaps the single, though by no means absolutely compulsory omission of אדני in the very first line, as well as in the corresponding lines of Visions II and IV, for the sake of the meter, as we shall see. And it is indeed significant that the only textual emendation in the entire ten lines of the vision was the insertion of a single letter, ה, lost for the very simple reason גז Cf. Gen. 42.35; 1 Sam. 7.10; 2 Sam. 6.16 (corrected text); 15.32; 1 Ki. 20.39; 2 Ki. 2.11; 6.26; 8.5; 19.37 ( = Isa. 37.38). Absolutely the only partial exception is 2 Ki. 13.21, where surprisingly והנה is followed by וראו. Normally we would expect here והם between והנה and ראו. At any rate it should be noted that even here the verb is used in the perfect with the waw connective instead of imperfect with waw consecutive, quite as if הם definitely stood or was under stood there.</page><page sequence="57">[57] AMOS STUDIES 75 that another letter ה followed immediately thereafter." In other words, the text of Vision I has been preserved in practically perfect form, precisely as its author, whether Amos himself or some disciple or amanuensis, wrote it down. The bearing of this upon our study and reconstruction of the subsequent four visions is of utmost importance.74 Before turning our attention to the literary form of Vision I it will be advisable to consider carefully the text of II. The crux of this Vision is the reconstruction of the utterly impos sible text והנה קרא לרב באש אדני יהוה. The number of proposed emendation is almost as many as of the scholars who have busied themselves with this problem, and the range of conjecture and interpretation is correspondingly wide. Only one thing is certain, viz. that the feminine singular verbs, ותאכל and ואכלה, indicate that אש is their subject, and therefore that the fire here referred to was represented as the active agent of Yahweh in His work of destruction. Manifestly then this fact must be brought out in the emended text. A tabular survey of the most important reconstructions of the text and interpretations of the passage, particularly those of recent scholars, will facilitate our own consideration of the problem. 1. 1. Lôhr and Harper retain the reading of MT and render, "And behold, the Lord Yahweh was calling to contend by fire." Harper attempts to support this interpretation by reference to Isa. 66.18. 2. Baumann omits אדני יהוה but otherwise retains MT. 73 Perhaps we should not even regard this ה as having been lost. In all likelihood the original text read, without division of the words, והיהאמכללאכל. This MT divided thus והיה אם כל(ה) לאכל, whereas actually it should have been divided thus, .והמה) הא מכל(ה&gt; לאכל לל Some slight difficulty exists in מי יקום יעקב of both Visions I and II. As Budde has remarked, actually we would expect... איך יקום; but it is hardly justi fiable to emend מי to איך. Probably Oort's reading מז'קום (for מה־יקום; originally no doubt written טיק(ו)ם, in other words perhaps a third instance of the absence of the final ה of MT in this one vision alone), is the best emendation con ceivable. Or perhaps still better, this should be emended slightly further to בטה־'קום; cf. Ex. 33.16; 1 Sam. 6.2; Isa. 2.22; Mal. 1.6, 7; 3.7, 8; Ps. 119.9.</page><page sequence="58">76 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [58] 3. Proksch and Sellin read, והנה כ!רא להב אש ואכלה.

It is the principle already referred to in our discussion of I, viz. that whenever הנה or והנה is followed by a participial clause the subject must absolutely come immediately after הנה and precede the participle unless, of course, just as here, it be implicit in the participle itself, in which case naturally the participle itself would follow immediately upon הנה. But under no condition whatever may the participle precede the subject. As is readily apparent, readings 1, 4, 5, 6, 8, 9, 10 disregard this rule utterly and are therefore so completely at variance with the syntax and spirit of the Hebrew language as to merit no further consideration. But the implications of this fact reach even farther. A number of scholars, Weiser in particular, have, for various reasons, 75 Unless with Elhorst and Halévy we read להבת אש. 76 Budde is, however, none too well satisfied with this והיא אכלה. 77 I have purposely omitted from this list the emendation and interpre tation proposed by Gressmann, והנה קנה לרב אש יהוה ותאכל את־תהום רבה ואכלה את־כלה(?)את־כלה(?) as too far-fetched, quixotic and arbitrary to merit consideration. Judging from their practically unanimous silence with regard thereto modern biblical scholars have appraised this emendation at the same value.</page><page sequence="59">[59] AMOS STUDIES 77 chiefly theological, sought to read Yahweh as the active, initiating and creative agent out of Visions I-IV. Weiser's argument and conclusions have been presented already and so need not be repeated, other than to recall his thesis that in these four visions Amos is in a normal psychic state and that what he actually beholds are in Visions I-II regular phenomena of nature and in III-IV ordinary objects of daily life, which any other normal person could have beheld in precisely the same manner. What distinguishes Amos from ordinary individuals and makes a prophet of him is not the visions themselves but rather that behind the visions he beholds, apprehends, something of divine reality and purpose. But to achieve this end Weiser must dispose in some way of the participles which in Visions I-II follow immediately upon והנה, and likewise in Vision III if the super fluous אדני be omitted. As has been indicated, the inavertible implication of the fact that in I and II the participles follow immediately upon והנה is that Yahweh is the subject of each participle, since He is likewise the subject of the verb immediately preceding והנה, and, moreover, since the name, יהוה, actually occurs before each והנה. Also in III, whether we retain or omit אדני, the clear implication is that Yahweh is represented as the subject of the participle ב?}. To obviate this interpretation, of the syntactical necessity of which apparently neither Weiser nor the majority of the scholars cited above seem to have been aware, Weiser, as we have seen, accepts the altogether unjustified and impossible emendation of יוצר to יצר_ in I, and in II he emends קרא to קרב and לרב באש to להב אש, and thus brings about the impossible construction of the subject following the participle, a condition which compels the immediate rejection of this emendation and interpretation; and in III he endeavors to meet the situation by the transposition of אנך from the end of 7.7a to a position between והנה and נצב, an altogether unjustifiable procedure, as we shall see shortly. The implication of all this is unmistakable. It is impossible in Visions I-II I not to interpret Yahweh as the subject of all three participles. This conclusion is inescapable. And with it the attempt of Weiser and of the various scholars before him, whose hypothesis he has developed to its utmost limits, fails</page><page sequence="60">78 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [60] completely. The theory that in these visions, I—III at least, Yahweh is not the present, active, initiating force, and that Amos sees mere, ordinary phenomena or objects of daily life and in a perfectly natural and normal manner, just as any other mortal might behold them, is refuted completely. What Amos beholds in Visions I-III is Yahweh Himself at work, initiating something, doing something of portentous significance. Amos alone beholds these visions, and no other person, and to him alone the import thereof is revealed. And this is true also of all the other prophetic visions of which we have record in biblical literature. Certainly in the classic instance of a prophetic vision, that in Isa. 6, Isaiah alone beholds Yahweh enthroned in the Temple. Likewise in I Ki. 22.17-22 the unmistakable implication is that Micaiah alone beholds both visions. The same seems to be the implication of the visions of Jeremiah in Jer. 1.1 Iff. And even in the one vision in Jer. 24. Iff., which of all biblical visions apparently has the closest affinities in form and nature with these visions of Amos, there is nothing whatever which might suggest that the vision was beheld by others than Jeremiah alone. Likewise the visions of Ezekiel and Zechariah are revealed to them alone, largely through the mediation of an angel or some other divine agent. And Dan. 10.7 affirms absolutely that only Daniel himself beheld the vision, while the men with him beheld nothing at all, but fled away in terror. Manifestly then the entire biblical record of the manner of revelation of prophetic visions points to the conclusion that such visions were beheld only by the person for whom they were destined. This is likewise the implication of the pronominal suffix of 78.הראני Accordingly we must conclude that the hypo thesis of Weiser and his predecessors, that in Visions I-III and even in IV Amos does not actually behold Yahweh Himself,7' but only ordinary phenomena of nature and objects of daily, profane life, is without the slightest foundation. The import of all this for the interpretation of these visions and of the entire 78 Cf. also Num. 24.4, 16; 12.6-7 and the import of 1 Sam. 3.1-10. 75 Even though he does hear Yahweh speaking directly to him.</page><page sequence="61">[61] AMOS STUDIES 79 work and message of Amos in particular, and for the history and psychology of prophecy in general can, of course, not be overestimated. Returning now to the consideration of Vision II and par ticularly of the difficult passage in 7.4a we need give our atten tion, and that but very briefly, only to the emendations of Baumann, Proksch and Sellin, and Nowack, since these alone conform to the syntactical rule that after והנה the subject must either precede the participle or be implicit in it. The interpréta tions of Baumann and Nowack differ but little. Both omit the seemingly superfluous and disturbing אדני יהוה after באש. Baumann retains קרא of MT, but Nowack prefers to emend this to קרב. The meanings thus achieved by both are practically identical. But this interpretation shatters upon the following considerations. Despite Harper's citation of Isa. 66.15, it is difficult to compre hend precisely what לרב באש might mean. The context would suggest for לרב a connotation, "to punish." But actually ריב never has this meaning, but only "to contend," either physically or legally. Furthermore, 'ריב ב means only "to contend against,"80 never ' ' to contend by means of" ; and certainly the fire is Yahweh's agent of destruction and not at all that against which He con tends. Accordingly this interpretation of Baumann and Nowack may be dismissed. The emendation of Proksch and Sellin might be regarded as more satisfactory, particularly if, with Elhorst and Halévy, we would read להבת אש for להב אש which Proksch and Sellin pro pose. This would safeguard the feminine verbs which follow. The change of ותאכל to ואכלה seems not only unnecessary, but to miss the real import of the vision. Moreover, this emenda tion would leave this vision vague and colorless and without adequate force. Therefore, even though little actual fault may be found with this suggested emendation, it has, on the other hand, little to commend it. If at all possible, some other, more satisfying emendation and interpretation should be sought. 80 Gen. 31.36; Ju. 6.32; Jer. 25.31; Hos. 2.4. However, even this expression is not at all common; the usual formula is ריב עם or ריב אח.</page><page sequence="62">80 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [62] There seems no reason whatever for questioning the correct ness of the participle קרא. Moreover, since in this vision the fire is manifestly Yahweh's agent of destruction, it follows that it is the fire which Yahweh summons or to which He calls. Accordingly we must read unquestionably קרא לאש. Furthermore, the mission of the fire is that of destruction; therefore for לרב we propose the emendation להחרב or even more simply, with the loss of but one single letter, the contracted form לחרב. But להחרב or לחרב must necessarily be followed by some object, explicitly expressed. It is clear that in the vision the mission of the fire was to consume all the earth. Amos beholds it in actual operation, after it has finished consuming the ocean and is about to proceed against the dry land. Seemingly the altogether superfluous and disturbing אדני יהוה following באש has taken the place of the object of לחרב which stood here originally. For this we would propose את־כל הארץ. For the meaningless and impossible החלק we would accept Budde's proposed החרבה or 81.החלד And finally, it is impossible to escape the impression that the close juxtaposition of the two forms of ותאכל ,אכל and ואכלה, is awkward and disturbing; nor does ותאכל fully bring out the idea implied here, viz. that of the complete consumption of the ocean by the fire, preparatory to its turning upon the dry land. Accordingly for ותאכל we propose ויז?ל, again an emendation involving the omission of only one letter. The correctness of this emendation finds strong confirmation in the correlation of the same two verbs as here, כלה and אכל, in מכלה לאכל of the same corresponding lines of Vision I. 7.4, as thus emended, would now read; כה הראני יהוה והנה קרא לאש לסרב את־כל הארץ נסכל את־תהום רבה ואכלה את־החרבה. There has likewise been a wide latitude of conjecture in the interpretation of the vision. Duhm and Gressmann maintain 81 Cf. Ps. 49.2. All in all, as Budde suggests, החרבה seems preferable since it is quite likely that חלד may be a late term, perhaps not yet in use in Amos' day. Weiser's retention of החלק, with his interpretation that it designates the field or piece of ground upon which Amos was standing at the moment of this vision is too forced and impossible to merit consideration.</page><page sequence="63">[63] AMOS STUDIES 81 that the fire here is the lightning. The vast majority of biblical scholars hold that the fire is the devastating heat of mid-summer and that the תהום רבה is the subterranean ocean from which the springs and streams and sources of water-supply emerge, and that accordingly we have here a picture of the extreme heat of summer drying up all the sources of water and causing drought and famine. But despite this unanimity of opinion, this inter pretation hardly satisfies. Gen. 7.11 and 8.22 do speak of the "springs of the Tehom," but despite this it is difficult to conceive of a figure of speech so hyperbolical as to so completely identify the springs and rivulets on the earth's surface with the subter ranean ocean, their source. More significant, however, is the fact that precisely such a drying-up of the springs and rivulets, except of the very few perennial streams, with the resultant withering of the herbage, was the regular and normal annual experience at the height of summer in Palestine, particularly in the vicinity of Tekoa, Amos' home; such an experience therefore could hardly suggest itself to the prophet as a particularly abnormal, destruc tive and terrifying visitation from Yahweh. Certainly this con ventional interpretation does not satisfy. Unquestionably Budde is correct in his contention that what Amos beholds here is neither lightning nor extreme summer heat, but, precisely as the text states, a fire, a great fire, the like of which had never been known, an all-consuming, supernatural fire, which has already devoured the ocean and now is proceeding to destroy the dry land. And if it be objected that such a fire is unreal and inconceivable, the answer is, precisely as Budde contends, that, of course, it is, that what Amos beholds is no real fire, for naturally history has no record of such a fire, but rather it is an unreal, imaginary, all consuming fire, beheld, not with normal gaze, but in a vision, in an abnormal psychic state, when the imagination has free rein and its creations may reach to the utmost bounds of fantasy. Such is undoubtedly this fire here, and such likewise the locusts in Vision I. We may now record the text of Visions I and II as we have reconstructed it. And for reasons almost self-apparent we set the two visions down in parallel columns:</page><page sequence="64">82 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [64] I II כה הראני יהוה כה הראני יהוה והנה קרא לאש והנה עצר גבי לחרב את־י־יבל הארץ בתחלת עלות הלקש ותכל את־תהום רבה והיה הא מכלה ואכלה84 את החרבה לאכל את־עשב הארץ ואמר אדני יהוה ואמר אדני יהוה חדל־נא 82מה־יקום יעקב סלח־נא 82מה־יקום יעקב כי קטן הוא כי קטן הוא נחם יהוה על־זאת נחם יהוה על־זאת 86לא־תהיה אמר יהוה לא־תהיה אמר יהוה It is readily apparent that these two visions are cast in metrical form. Each consists of ten lines or bars of three beats each. The two poems balance each other exactly. The first line of each poem is identical. The vision proper is contained in lines 84 Or, as has been suggested, במה. Or perhaps, though far less probably, מי might be retained, and the strophic division be thus: סלח־נא פי יקום יעקב כי קטן־הוא Forgive; who can endure? As for Jacob, verily, he is small! 8ג Reading כל for the sake of the meter. 8484 Regarding את החרבה as two beats, for the sake of the meter, which the inherent rhythm of the phrase readily permits. 8585 Because of the meter regarding both נס־היא here and אדני after אפר as late, editorial insertions (so also Baumann, Nowack, Prâtorius; Duhm, Proksch, Sellin, Gressmann, Weiser omit only אדני). Were these words retained, it would become necessary to arrange the last two lines of Vision II thus: נם־היא לא תהיה אפר אדני יהוה This arrangement, while formally preserving the three-beat measure, would make Vision II consist of eleven lines, and would thus destroy its balance with Vision I. The words are altogether superfluous, contrary to the characteristic and effective extreme conciseness of style of Amos and weaken the force of the picture. They should therefore be omitted.</page><page sequence="65">[65] AMOS STUDIES 83 2-5; in each case it is introduced by והנה followed immediately by the participle; in lines 4-5 of each poem we find a play upon the two verbs כלה and אכל. Lines 6-10 of both poems are identical, with the single exception that line 7 of I begins סלח־נא, while line 7 of II begins חדל־נא. The relationship of the two poems and of the two visions which they record to each other is obvious. Their relationship becomes even more apparent in translation : I Thus Yahweh caused me to see,86 And behold, He was fashioning locusts At the beginning of the coming up of the aftergrowth ; And it was (they were) intended to completely Consume the herbage. 86 Or perhaps "let me see" rather than "caused me to see." The implica tion would then be that, precisely as in Isa. 6, where the prophet is permitted to behold Yahweh àt work performing, not some special task upon this one occasion, and performed solely in order that the prophet might behold it, but performing rather His regular annual task of judging the nations upon the New Year's Day (cf. "The Book of the Covenant," I, HUCA, V [1928], 48ff.), so also Amos beholds Yahweh in Vision I fashioning locusts and in Vision II summoning the fire. This would imply that Yahweh performs each of these two acts in turn, not as the mere precursors to and preparation for the visions, but rather as the expression of His purpose with Israel. In I His purpose to destroy Israel, or even all the inhabited world, is fully determined upon, and He is now fashioning the locusts to be the agents of this destruction. In II His purpose is not only fixed, but the work of destruction is already well under way, when the prophet is permitted to look on and behold comprehendingly. The vision itself, with its implicit revelation, vouchsafed to the prophet, was not purposed primarily by Yahweh, nor was Amos' intercession anticipated by Him. The vision thus granted to the prophet was at first really incidental to what Yahweh was doing. It was only the prophet's intercession, wrung spontaneously out of his loving heart, filled with sympathy for Israel thus doomed, and quite unexpected by Yahweh, which lifted the prophet's at first purely incidental role in the vision to the position of primary importance and induced Yahweh to forego, first, His preparations for the destruction, and, later, the work of destruction itself after it had actually been set in operation. All in all, however, it seems best to adhere to the rendering, "caused me to see," with its implication that from the very beginning Yahweh had selected Amos as the agent of His revelation unto Israel, and therefore divine purpose animated throughout the manifestation of these four visions to him.</page><page sequence="66">84 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [66] And I said; O my Lord, Yahweh, Forgive; how can Jacob endure, For87 he is small!88 Yahweh revoked His purpose in the matter; It shall not be, said Yahweh. and II Thus Yahweh caused me to see, And behold, He was summoning fire To destroy the entire earth ; And it had completely consumed the ocean And was now devouring the land. And I said; O my Lord, Yahweh, Desist; how can Jacob endure, For he is small! Yahweh revoked His purpose in the matter; It shall not be, said Yahweh. Even in the translation the powerful, moving effect both of the extreme conciseness of the language, without a single superfluous or dispensable word, and of the short, staccato-like lines is immediately apparent. These poems are the work of a master artist, a poet whose soul was most sensitively attuned to God and the apperception of His purpose. No second hand, no recorder nor biographer, could have composed these stirring, self-revealing poems, but only the prophet himself, only he who had himself experienced these visions. The brief appeal for his doomed people,89 all the more moving just because of its extreme brevity, reveals the innermost workings of the prophet's tender soul, torn by this sudden revelation of the fate impending over his people. Initially, normally, Amos is anything but the stern prophet of tradition, who unfeelingly, soullessly, mechanically 8ל Or "verily." 881, e. either "weak" or, perhaps better, "young, immature, not yet able to realize the enormity of his offense." 8' For from the standpoint of Yahweh and of the prophets, His messengers unto them, Israel and Judah were always one people, Yahweh's people.</page><page sequence="67">[67] AMOS STUDIES 85 proclaims his message of absolute justice and inevitable doom over a, but not his, condemned people. Rather, as himself one of the adjudged people, even though not a member of that particular section of the people whose doom is immediately pending, he can and does feel for this people and suffer deeply at the realization of their approaching doom. Such is Amos at the moment of this first, and even of the second vision. It is clear that the visions stand in a progressive relationship to each other. Vision I comes to Amos in the spring, "at the beginning of the coming-up of the aftergrowth," as it expressly states. Vision II comes to him some two or three months later, at the very height of summer. For even though, as we have seen, the fire here is not at all the withering heat of mid-summer, as most scholars interpret it, none the less it is self-evident that it would naturally be during the period of extreme heat and drought that a fire such as this could best perform its work of destruction. These months intervening between the two visions have not been empty, fruitless months for either Yahweh or His prophet. For Yahweh they have been obviously a period of trial and waiting, in which another opportunity has been given to Israel to repent, to turn from its evil way and return unto Him and to its faithful covenant-relation with Him; but all in vain; Israel was hopelessly set in its evil way and would not return unto Yahweh. And so at the end of this period Yahweh's purpose is renewed, His purpose of repudiation of His convenant with Israel and destruction of the sinful people. For the prophet too these months have been a period of thought, of deep meditation upon Yahweh's nature and purpose, His purpose with him and with Israel. And then at the end of these months comes the second vision, and the prophet now sees and understands more clearly than at first the full import of the situation. Yahweh had indeed heark ened to his plea for Israel and had granted it a respite. Manifestly then, so far as he himself was concerned, he stood close to Yahweh, in Yahweh's confidence, was Yahweh's chosen servant, and, so it must have now begun to seem to him, chosen for some all important purpose. This second vision must have strengthened greatly his own faith in himself as one called by Yahweh. But</page><page sequence="68">86 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [68] also it brought to him the realization that his intercession in behalf of Israel had borne no fruit. Even though Yahweh had granted Israel a respite and a new chance, Israel had refused to avail itself thereof, had refused to repent and to return unto its God and to fulfill its covenant-obligations ; therefore deservedly Israel was doomed. And now the situation is much further advanced. The destruction is no longer merely determined and in preparation; it has actually begun, is already under way. But even the realization of this can not deter this man with the deeply loving, sympathetic soul from pleading anew on behalf of his people. Yahweh may not again hearken to his supplication, but none the less he must plead. But with the evidence of the stubbornness and sinfulness of the people clear before him and with the work of destruction already under way, he can no longer plead, "forgive"; he can beseech only, "desist." But Yahweh, as Amos knows Him and as He reveals Himself to His prophet, is not a god bent upon punishment and destruction. Rather He desires the repentance of His people and their return unto right relations with Him ; and so long as there is the slightest ground for hope, He is ready, willing, perhaps even eager, to at least desist, and wait again and see what Israel may do. And so a second respite; and again in vain. And now what next? But the Yahweh whom Amos thus beholds in these first two visions is not only a merciful god, eager for the repentance of His people, loathe to sever His covenant-relations with them; He is also a god of justice, who, if He must punish, will punish surely, if He must cast off His people, will cast them off com pletely. He is not to be deterred from His purpose by any con giderations of sacrifice, abundantly heaped up, nor by what might popularly be imagined as His own personal interests, by a desire to triumph over the gods of other nations and show Himself supreme over them. For, in the final analysis, even though Amos himself does not yet see the full implication of this clearly, the Yahweh whom Amos is permitted to behold in the visions, is more, far more, than a national god, even the highest and most powerful among the whole throng of national gods; He is a world-god, the creator-god, the One who fashions the locusts to fulfill His purpose, the One who, obviously not</page><page sequence="69">[69][69] AMOS STUDIES 87 with Israel alone in mind, but in judgment upon all the nations, summons the fire to destroy the whole earth, the fire which has, in the vision, already consumed the ocean and is just on the point of devouring the land. In comparison with such a god what are mere, petty national gods and what their selfish interests, rivalries and competitions? He is far above such considerations, even as He is far above such gods. And even the nations whose gods they are supposed to be, whose destinies they are supposed to control and in whose achievements and victories over their rival nations they themselves are supposed to triumph, these nations too are verily subject to His all-controlling will, are under His power and must likewise comply with His law and submit to His judgment and punishment, even, though perhaps not to quite the same degree, as Israel, His people, whom, of all the nations, He had known most intimately and affectionately, and who should therefore in turn have known Him best and been most ready to conform to His law and to live His life. The Yahweh whom Amos thus came to know through these first two visions was truly a world-god as well as Israel's particular god. All this is implicit in these two visions of world-cataclysm, even though perhaps not fully and definitely expressed, nor yet comprehended in its complete reality by the prophet. So much for Visions I and II. As various scholars90 have rightly emphasized, together these two visions form a pair, just as III and IV, as we shall see, form another pair. I and II are much more closely related to each other, and III and IV to each other, than they are to the visions of the opposite pair. In I and II we have the concept of the world-god, who is still patient and forbearing with and hopeful for the one people whom He has known most intimately from among the nations; in III and IV His interest is centered upon this one particular people; His patience is at an end ; His hope for the people has vanished ; His purpose now is fixed, repudiation and destruction. In Visions III and IV the prophet no longer beholds phenomena of nature, wide-sweeping cataclysms which threaten to destroy the entire earth and all mankind upon it; now he beholds simple י° And particularly Weiser.</page><page sequence="70">88 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [70] objects of ordinary life, objects which are themselves in no way destructive, but which in the hands of Yahweh symbolize destruction. This characteristic of these two visions in itself serves to distinguish Visions III and IV from I and II and to establish their close and inseparable relationship to each other. And in addition thereto, in both these visions, and in significant contrast to I and II we find the dialogue between Yahweh and the prophet, the question, What seest thou, Amos?, and the prophet's answer. Of this more in due time. But first one most significant question. In both visions the affirmation by Yahweh occurs, לא־אוסיף עוד עבור־לו, "Never again will I pardon him," i. e. Israel. The meaning is, of course, self-evident. The reference is backwards to Visions I and II, in which, in answer to the prophet's plea, Yahweh has forgiven Israel and granted it a respite, in the hope that it would at last repent. But two such manifestations of favor, two such forgivenesses, two such respites, are enough; and so, "Never again will I forgive Israel"; now Yahweh's purpose is fixed and is unalterable, implacable; the end has come, destruction must follow. But this realization of the unquestionable relationship of the divine dictum, לא־אוסיף עוד עבור־לו, to the thought of Visions I and II makes it perfectly clear that there is neither occasion nor room for the double pronouncement of this divine decree in both Visions III and IV. In itself, with Amos' oft described economy of words, particularly manifest, as has been said, in these visions, it would be surprising indeed, to have this one thought thus repeated, and particularly in the same, identical words. It would be a confession of literary incapacity and poverty of both thought and expression, qualities as foreign to Amos as anything might be. In one or the other vision, III or IV, this clause is superfluous, does not fit and must be removed. It is surprising indeed that this seems not to have occurred to any biblical scholar before this, or that at least the sugges tion had to wait thus long to be definitely offered for general consideration. There can be not the slightest question in which of the two visions the clause, לא־אוסיף עוד עבור־לו, belongs. It is in Vision IV. The clause carries further the thought of the explicit statement,</page><page sequence="71">[71] AMOS STUDIES 89 בא הקץ "לישראל, "the end has come for Israel." The end in question is the end of Yahweh's patience with, forgiveness of and covenant relations with Israel, the end which marks likewise the end of Israel as Yahweh's people and of its national existence. Misled by the unnatural position of Vision IV after Vision III, some scholars have been inclined to read into הקץ something of the far-reaching, eschatological import which came to attach to the term in the course of the theological evolution of Judaism. But there is absolutely nothing of that either in this one passage or in the actual message of Amos itself. What Amos envisages is not the rejection of Israel by Yahweh and its destruction at the "end-time," but in the near, the immediate and certain future; nor does the prophet envisage this "end-time" as almost here. He knows naught whatever of the later, theological concept of the "end-time," with its many and supernatural attendant circumstances. He sees political, historical realities in the near future, and not theological speculations in the remote, uncertain, dim time to come. The "end" which Vision IV foreshadows therefore must be, not a theological concept, but an actual, real, concrete condition or circumstance, the end of Yahweh's forgiveness of Israel, and with this of necessity the end of the nation, its doom, which Visions I and II already forecast, and which had been averted then only by Amos' intercession. Accord ingly the assurance in Vision IV that the end has come for Israel carries with it for Amos an implied command, or at least an implied instruction, that he plead no more on behalf of the sinful, unrepentant nation which refuses to return to its god; the end has come at last; further pleading would be in vain; never again will Yahweh let Israel return unto Him. Nor does Amos plead again; Vision IV gives him the assurance that Israel's doom is definitely sealed. But these considerations lead to a conclusion of great impor tance. In the climactic progress of the visions and their picture of Yahweh's purposed dealing with Israel Vision IV is out of place where it stands. The scene which it unfolds is the immediate continuation of that of Vision II, where the work of destruction " For this slightly emended reading cf. below, p. 95.</page><page sequence="72">90 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [72] has begun but is interrupted and a respite is gained for Israel by Amos' intercession. The next step in the unfolding of Yahweh's plan and purpose with Israel is just this assurance which Vision IV gives, that now the end has come, the end of Yahweh's for bearance with His faithless people and likewise the end of their national existence, which they had maintained only through Him. Vision IV says not a word as yet as to the manner in which the end will come, how Yahweh will carry out His purpose of rejection and destruction of the sinful and faithless nation. That picture Yahweh reserves, quite naturally, for the next following vision, Vision III. It is enough in this Vision IV to have declared the startling, inexorable decree that "now the end has come for Israel; never again will I pardon its sins." The details of the destruction can follow later, in the final, culminât ing vision. And, as we shall see, precisely this is what Vision III does unfold for Amos. There can not be the slightest doubt of the correctness of this conclusion. Where it stands, at the beginning of Chap. 8, and following upon and separated from Visions I-III by the personal narrative recorded in 7.10-15; 3.3-8; 7.16-17, Vision IV is out of place. It must for some reason or other have been dis located from the position in which it stood originally, and this must have been between 7.6 and 7. But when we do transpose this vision to that place, then we realize that at last we have all four visions which preceded and were the indispensable pre paration for Amos' going upon his mission not only in the proper sequence of their climactic unfolding, but also as a literary unit; for, as we shall see clearly in due time, Vision V is both of a different type and also of a different occasion and purpose than Visions I-IV. And not only this, but also, as we shall likewise see in due time, the relation of the literary record of the visions to the narrative, biographical incident of 7.10-15; 3.3-8; 7.16-17, which followed immediately upon the complete account of the four visions, becomes very much clearer. We may therefore &lt; j regard it as almost absolutely certain that Vision IV was actually the third in the series of visions which came to Amos and that the literary record of it stood originally between 7.6 and 7. The next matter to be considered is that of the complete</page><page sequence="73">[73] AMOS STUDIES 91 form and content of Vision IV.'2 Two main questions arise here. The first is whether v. 3 is either wholly or in part an integral portion of this vision. On this question scholars are divided. Lôhr, Baumann, Marti, Nowack, H. Schmidt, Proksch, Budde and others retain the entire verse for the vision, although the majority of them admit considerable difficulty and resultant doubt in so doing. Sellin would retain only 3b for the vision. Harper and Gressmann would transpose the entire v., and Sellin merely the first half, to follow 7.9, and so, of course, dissociate it completely from the vision. Duhm and Weiser too would reject the verse completely as a part of the vision. We too are strongly of the opinion that the v. can not possibly be a part of the vision. The grounds for this conclusion and for transposing this v. to another and more appropriate position we will consider in our discussion of Amos' complete picture of the Day of Yahweh. The other question is more immediate; it is whether the dialogue between Yahweh and the prophet in Visions III and IV is original or secondary. The question arises out of two con siderations, first, that no such dialogue occurs in Visions I and II, and second, that it is difficult to arrange this dialogue in the three-beat metrical form in which, as we have seen, Visions I and II are couched, and which, as we shall soon see, runs through Visions III and IV likewise. Of course it is not particularly difficult to rearrange the dialogue in trimeter form. Thus in Vision IV we need only transpose יהוה אלי from following the second ויאמר in 8.2 to follow the first, and to regard מה־אתה as one beat. This would then give the following arrangement of this passage; ויאמר יהוה אלי מה־אתה ראה עמוס ואמר כלוב קיץ " For the sake of convenience and to avoid confusion we must continue to designate this vision as Vision IV. But we must constantly bear in mind that in point of time of revelation as well as in its original position in the book Vision IV preceded Vision III.</page><page sequence="74">92 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [74] But this would, in turn leave the next bar consisting of ויאמר alone, unless, of course, we should repeat יהוה אלי here, certainly not an elegant nor forceful phrasing; and at the best, despite the trimeter form thus achieved, this would be dull and prosaic poetry, quite unworthy of Amos. This question and answer introduction characterizes the visions of both Jeremiah and Zechariah; but this very considéra tion suggests that here the question and answer may well have been inserted by a later editor, who sought to cast these two visions of Amos into the conventional form of his day. On the other hand, it might be argued that this dialogue is almost indispensable here, for it serves to focus the prophet's attention upon the object in question, here the basket of summer produce, and thus pave the way for the symbolic interpretation of that object which is to follow. It might be argued still further that in Visions I and II there was no need for such focusing of the prophet's attention since those two visions dealt with striking phenomena of nature, not at all ordinary occurrences of the prophet's daily life, which must of themselves attract his atten tion, while such would not be at all the case with objects of ordinary character and occurrence, such as a plumb-line, even though held in Yahweh's hand, and a basket of summer produce; therefore the import of this dialogue. Weiser has gone even further and argued for the absolute indispensability of this dialogue in Visions III and IV by the contention that here in Vision IV the symbolism of the basket of summer produce is apparent, not at all in the sight or appear ance of the object, but only in its name as actually pronounced. He suggests still further that in all probability Amos pro nounced the name, not ק;ץ, in bisyllabic form, but קיץ, as a monosyllable and practically indentical in sound with the word קץ which, with its connotation of "end," it now suggests. The idea is attractive indeed at first glance. But second thought gives rise to grave doubts. Of course it is not impossible, nor even unlikely that in answer to the question, "What seest thou, Amos?," the prophet might have responded by using the general or collective term, קיץ. But it seems far more probable that he would rather have specified the exact produce which he beheld,</page><page sequence="75">[75] AMOS STUDIES 93 pomegranates, grapes, apples, or whatever it may have been. Of course, if the basket contained several varieties of summer produce, then the collective term, קיץ, may well have been the best and most natural term to use. With Vision IV therefore this argument may not be pressed too far. But when we turn to Vision III we find a different situation. There, in answer to the question, "What seest thou, Amos?," the very last word which would have suggested itself to the prophet would be the foreign word אנך. Instead he would undoubt edly have replied with the word קו, or perhaps more specifically משקלה.« And yet, had he used in his reply either of these two normal Hebrew terms, the necessary symbolism and the very point of the vision would have been missed completely, as we shall see. Certainly in Vision III the development of the vision is presented more simply and with far greater characteristic conciseness, and the symbolism of the name of the object is brought out more surely and clearly if the whole of the question and answer in 7.8a is omitted entirely, and it is left for Yahweh Himself in 7.8b to pronounce the word אנך, and thus pave the way unerringly for the symbolism inherent in the word. Nothing whatever is lost by the omission of the question and answer. And indeed if, as Weiser holds, it were necessary to focus the attention of the prophet upon the object in question, a slight gesture on the part of the Deity, whom, as we have endeavored to show, Amos actually beheld in all these visions, a gesture so slight that no mention thereof need be made in the extremely concise record of the vision, would have sufficed completely for this purpose. And still one other consideration, in itself of secondary char acter, yet in this connection perhaps of larger significance. We have seen already that in Vision IV in order to obtain the regular three-beat arrangement for the dialogue it was necessary to transpose יהוה אלי from its present position after the second ויאמר in 8.2 to a position immediately after the first ויאמר; in fact this transposition is almost compulsory if the question and answer be retained as an integral part of the vision.»4 But, as « Cf. 2 Ki. 21.13; Isa. 28.17. י&lt; So Duhm, Budde.</page><page sequence="76">94 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [76] we have seen, its removal from after the second ויאמר leaves that particular bar of the poem unbalanced and certainly lacking something. If ידווה אלי be retained in its present position, and instead the question and answer be omitted as secondary, then the bar is perfectly balanced and complete both in form and thought. Something comparable in a way exists in Vision III, for while there, in 7.8, יהוה אלי is in its logical place after the first ויאמר, an altogether disturbing and superfluous אדני occurs after the second ויאמר, quite as if it were there as the result of rather bungling editing.95 Furthermore, as a number of scholars have discerned,96 in v. 7 אדני after והנה is clearly out of place. Both LXX and Vulg. read it after הראני, i. e. in its logical place; but in all likelihood אדני there really represents an original יהוה, precisely as in the three other visions. But with יהוה standing in this position and therefore, as we have learned, not only the subject of הראני but also in consequence the implied subject of the participle נצב following immediately upon והנה, the repetition of יהוה אלי after the first ויאמר, if the question and answer were original, or after the second ויאמר, if it be agreed that the question and answer are not original, would not only be inelegant and out of harmony with the characteristic conciseness of expression of these visions, but also it would leave the last bar in v. 7 with only two beats. In the light of these considerations we feel very strongly inclined to regard the question and answer in both Visions III and IV as late, editorial insertions, designed to make these two visions conform to the conventional literary form which the record of visions such as these, dealing with ordinary objects of every day life, took in the period from Jeremiah to Zechariah, or even a bit later, i. e. in the exilic and early post exilic period. We may now turn to the detailed consideration of the text of Vision IV in 8.1-2. In 8.1a, just as in Visions I and II, אדני after הראני should probably be omitted in order to achieve the customary three-beat meter. It is quite probable that in lb after והנה we should insert 97;בידו but in such case we must regard &gt;s Duhm, Nowack and Budde would omit this אדני. 96 Lôhr, Baumann, Nowack, Marti and others. 97 So also Condamin, Lôhr, Baumann, Nowack, Marti.</page><page sequence="77">[77] AMOS STUDIES 95 כלוב־קיץ as one beat. The insertion is not at all necessary, but is suggested by comparison with 7.7b in Vision III. The two situations seem to be precisely parallel. Furthermore, there is no reason for doubting that in Vision IV, just as in Visions I-III, Amos not only hears Yahweh speaking, but also actually beholds Him; and in such case, of course, we would have to presume that the basket of summer produce is held in His hand. These con siderations seem to justify the insertion. In 8.2 v. 2a must in all likelihood be omitted as a late, editorial interpolation, as we have seen. In 2b עמי should probably be omitted both because it is superfluous and also to achieve the regular three-beat meter; in fact it is quite unlikely that in this vision, dealing with Yahweh's repudiation of Israel, He would still apply the designation, עמי, "My people," to the nation. Perhaps too for the resultant אל־ישראלאל־ישראל we should read a trifle more simply, לישראל. Accordingly we have as the original text of Vision IV the following: כה הראני ידווה והנה בידו כלוב־קיץ ויאמר יהוה אלי בא הקץ לישראל לא־אוסיף עוד עבור־לו: The conventional three-beat meter in all five of these lines produc es the effect of vividness and of a reaction of dismay and terror at this absolute pronouncement of the doom. The characteristic conciseness of expression is manifest throughout. But the question arises here, whether the vision is actually complete in this form. It consists of only five bars or lines, whereas Visions I and II consist of ten lines each. And Vision III, as we shall see, certainly contained more than five bars and in all likelihood actually consisted originally of ten bars, precisely as I and II. The natural presumption is therefore that IV likewise consisted originally of ten bars, that, in other words, only half of the original statement of the vision has been preserved. This is borne out by the consideration that in its present five bars the vision seems somewhat incomplete. We might expect some what more of the play upon the words קץ'קיץ t^an we actually have here, and likewise somewhat more elaboration of the</page><page sequence="78">96 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [78] thought that the end has come for Israel and of the implication of this, viz. Yahweh's repudiation of the covenant and complete rejection of Israel. The probability of this will be strengthened by the realization that Vision III too is incomplete and by our proposed reconstruction of its text.98 We come now to the consideration of Vision III. And first it will be well to recall that we have had to conclude that the question and answer in 7.8a and also לא־אוסיף עוד עבור־לו in 8b/? are late insertions. The crux of the vision lies, of course, in v. 7. Here manifestly a number of textual difficulties exist, for which a wide range of solutions have been proposed by various schol ars. In the first place, the expression, חומת אנך, seems to have given trouble from the very first. LXX renders it τβίχουϊ" άδαμαντίνου,άδαμαντίνου, while the second אנך it renders άδάμας. Theodo tion renders אנך τηκόμβνον, as if he either emended it to or correlated it with some form of the nifal, נמק. A number of scholars, notably Driver and G. A. Smith, retain the text as it is and endeavor to read some meaning into it.100 The majority of scholars omit the first אנך and for חומת read 101.חומה Baumann omits all of 7a/?, which is indeed a cutting of the Gordian knot. Gressmann makes the first אנך the subject of נצב, but whether in doing so he would transpose אנך to follow immediately after והנה is not clear;102 in addition Gressmann reads with LXX 98 Not improbably the late, editorial insertion of the question and answer into Visions III and IV, with the resultant undue lengthening of them and the destruction of their original, conventional ten-line, trimeter form, may have occasioned, or at least contributed to the loss of portions of these two visions. 99 Obviously LXX read the plural, nfcnn. 100 G. A. Smith translates the v. thus: "And behold, the Lord had taken his stand upon a city wall (built) to the plummet, and in His hand a plummet." 101 Oort, Gràtz, Nowack (partially), Elhorst, Lôhr, Oettli, Harper, Proksch, H. Schmidt, Weiser. 102102 Weiser interprets the clause in the same manner and likewise actually makes this transposition. But this interpretation of this difficult passage shatters completely upon the fact that נטה or שים are the verbs regularly em ployed with קו and משקלת. There is not a single instance of either word being used with נצב. And certainly the picture of a plumbline "standing up against" (נצב על) a wall is preposterous, inasmuch as a plumbline never "stands" or "is stood up against," but is only "suspended," "stretched" or "placed." But the necessary rejection of this very forced interpretation of this passage is</page><page sequence="79">[79] AMOS STUDIES 97 חומות for חומת. Sellin too cuts the Gordian knot in a way by quite gratuitously changing the first אנך to ארמון. Budde suggests that the first אנך is a corruption of some other word which stood here originally, but he does not follow Sellin in his emendation. In some respects the most original, but at the same time the most far-fetched and improbable interpretation of the v. is that of Condamin,103 which, in turn is accepted with considerable favor by Marti. He contends that אנך does not mean "plumbline" at all, but, following the lead offered by LXX, rather "steel, adamant," at any rate a hard metal. Furthermore, following another lead of LXX, which apparently either read or inserted 104איש after והנה, he holds that what Amos beheld in the vision was a man standing upon a wall of steel or some similar metal,105 with steel, i. e. a sword in his hand.106 The wall of steel symbolizes unconquerability. The man standing upon this wall is the uncon querable, destroying enemy of Israel, whom Yahweh will send against the sinful nation. The sword in his hand symbolizes the slaughter and devastation which he will bring upon Israel. In our own reconstruction of this vision, in addition to the textual difficulties inherent in v. 7 in its present form and to the omission of v. 8a and 8b/?, we note first of all that the vision is incomplete and fragmentary. This becomes all the more apparent when we realize that v. 9 can not possibly be an integral part of the vision. This opinion is shared by quite a number of schol ars.107 The three threats voiced in this v. are too specific to accord another severe blow to Weiser's hypothesis that in Visions I-IV Amos does not actually behold Yahweh. For undoubtedly even Weiser must admit that if אנך can not be the subject of נצב, then naught remains but to regard 'הוה, the subject of הראני, as likewise the subject of נצב; in other words, precisely the same construction as in Visions I-II. Moreover, the vision beheld by the prophet here, described by the words יהוה) נצב על), is precisely the same as that described by the very same words in Vision V (9.1). "3 "Le pretendu 'fil k plomb' de la vision d'Amos," RB, Oct., 1900. 4" ανηρ έστηκώς =איש נצב (Cod. Alexandrinus). 105 In comparison he cites Jer. 1.18; 15.20; Ezek. 4.3. 106 An interpretation which he justifies by reference to בחרב in v. 9. But not only is this forced indeed, but also, as we shall see, v. 9 is not an integral part of this vision. 107 Duhm, Proksch, Gressmann, Weiser. Nowack, Sievers-Guthe, and Kohler link v. 9 with w. 10-17, which follow, rather than with what precedes.</page><page sequence="80">98 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [80] with the general tone and spirit of the visions. They have all the earmarks of words spoken by the prophet directly to the people, rather than of a pronouncement made by Yahweh to the prophet in the body of this vision. This conclusion is confirmed by the fact that only to these words in this v. can the report of Amaziah to the king, in v. 11, refer, for nowhere else does the prophet describe so specifically the fate in store for the royal house. Moreover, as we shall see convincingly in due time, such a state ment by the prophet directly to the people was absolutely indis pensable to the completion of his message contained in his spoken address. Therefore only if we may assume that these visions were actually spoken to the people by Amos as an integral part of his address, may we regard v. 9 as a part of Vision III. And very soon we shall be compelled to reach the conclusion that the visions could not possibly have been a part of Amos' spoken address to the people, but are instead, precisely like 7.10-15; 3.3-8; 7.16-17, a literary, biographical appendix to the written record of the spoken address. But with v. 9 no longer regarded as a part of Vision III, it is almost self-evident that what remains is only a fragment of the complete vision, as Amos actually beheld and recorded it. In v. 7, with the majority of scholars, we would insert יהודז after הראני and likewise remove אדני from after והנה. In this way the introduction of Vision III would correspond exactly, as it undoubtedly did, to the introductions of the three other visions. Likewise, for חומת אנך we too would read חומה for reasons which will soon be made clear. This gives us accordingly for the extant portion of Vision III the following; כה הראני יהוה והנה נצב על־חומה ובידו אנך ויאמר הנני שם אנך ב ישראל The consideration of these five lines makes it doubly clear that the vision has been preserved in only a fragmentary state. Our task therefore is to endeavor to supply the missing portions, so far as this may be possible within reason.</page><page sequence="81">[81] AMOS STUDIES 99 Now it is clear, as most scholars have realized, that the key to the vision lies in the interpretation of the peculiar word, אנך. That it means "plumbline," just as most recent scholars have maintained, seems to be beyond question. The word is actually an Akkadian word. In that language it means "lead."108 Here it is obviously the equivalent of the regular Hebrew term, משק ל ת.משק ל ת. Probably we should not infer from this that in Amos' day the Akkadian term was current in Israel and had supplanted to any degree the Hebrew term. It is much safer to infer that this Akkadian term is used here with a twofold purpose. Its very use, in preference to the regular Hebrew term, suggests just what nation will be Yahweh's agent of destruction against Israel, viz. Assyria. It will be the אנך applied to the walls of Israel's cities, which will betray their inherent weakness and instability and bring them toppling to the ground. But beyond this there is good reason for believing that there is a play on words implied in אנך, comparable in every way to that upon קץ—קיץ in Vision IV. This was sensed by both Riedel and Prâtorius; but the textual emendations which they pro posed to carry out this play on words have been rejected by scholars with practical unanimity. To Riedel אנך has suggested a form of the verb נכה. And, he argues, since it must be a form resembling אנך in sound, in other words a form retaining the נ of the stem, it must necessarily be a pi'el. Now actually no certain form of the pi'el of נכה occurs in biblical literature,10' but the pu' al, although exceedingly rare, is none the less attested in Ex. 9.31, 32. There seems accordingly no good reason for questioning the general principle of Riedel's suggestion on lexicographical grounds, although the apocopated form, אנך, which he would substitute and the manner of his emendation are exceedingly doubtful. On the other hand אנך has suggested 108 Delitzsch, HWB, lOOf. Already near the end of the 3rd millenium B. C., as the so-called Cappadocian tablets show, lead was a regular article of export from Assyria to Western Asia (cf. Lewy, "Les textes paléo-assyriens et l'Ancien Testament," Rev. de l'Hist. des Relig., CX [1934], 39). It was therefore a most appropriate symbol for Assyria. 109 Unless the dubious form n^J in Num. 22.6 be regarded as genuine.</page><page sequence="82">100 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [82] to Prâtorius an affinity with אנכי. But he misses the real play upon words when he substitutes אנכי for אנך in v. 8ba, and thus brings forth the atrocity, "See, I will put 'I' in the midst of My people, Israel." Rather, it should now be clear, this אנך in v. 8ba is indispensable to prepare adequately for the play on words to follow, and this play on words must have occurred in the portion of the vision which is now missing. It is just this which we must attempt to supply; nor is the task unduly dif ficult. Naturally the proposed reading must conform to the regular three-beat measure. Moreover, it is clear from the picture of Yahweh standing upon a wall, a wall which he is measuring with the plumbline in His hand, and which, impliedly, He finds out of plumb and therefore doomed to fall, and also from the symbolism of the use of the Akkadian term, אנך, that in this vision we have a detailed forecasting of the conquest of the land by the Assyrian, the capture of its cities and the exile of its people, in other words the completion and climax of the series of pictures of the inevitable doom and destruction of Israel contained in the four visions. Furthermore, if, as we have contended, the use of עמי in Vision III, in 8.2ba, after Yahweh's announcement of His repudiation of the covenant and rejection of Israel as His people, would be surprising, if not absolutely impossible, then how much the more so must be the use of the same word in this, the final vision, in 7.8ba? Unquestionably it is a corruption of some other word. Accordingly, carrying out these ideas, and likewise following a hint given by Budde, who suggests that בקרב may be a corruption of an original 0",?קלת we would first emend line 5 of the vision, in which we have thus far left two blank spaces, to read בקרת ערי ישראל and then supply the next two lines of the vision very much as follows; אנכי אכנו בחרב ונפלו חומותיו תחתיהן1" 110 Specifically, with relation to the city wall קיר seems to designate "the outer portion, face or surface thereof," cf. Josh. 2.15; Num. 35.4. 111 Cf. Lam. 2.8; 2 Ki. 21.13; Isa. 34.11; cf. Harper to this v. Or perhaps in place of תחתיהן we should read הבצורות (cf. Isa. 2.15) or something similar.</page><page sequence="83">[83] AMOS STUDIES 101 This last line, of course, would carry out the symbolism of the picture of Yahweh measuring with the plumbline the wall upon which He stands. This would then give us seven lines of the original ten of the complete vision. In all likelihood this vision too, as well as Vision IV, concluded in the same manner as Visions I and II with a final line, in the regular three-beat measure, .אמר אדני יהוה This leaves actually only lines 8 and 9 of the original ten-line text of the vision missing. In all likelihood these contained some reference, more or less specific, to the fate in store for the royal family and to the impending exile of the people. We are now in position to set down the texts of Visions IV and III,1" as we have been able to reconstruct them, in parallel columns, just as we have done already with Visions I and II. IV III כה הראני יהוה כה הראני יהוה והנה נצב על־חומה והנה בידו כלוב־קיץ ובידו אנך ויאמר ויאמר יהוה אלי הנני שם אנך בא הקץ לישראל בקלת ערי ישראל לא־אוסיף עוד עבור־לו אנכי אכנו בחרב ונפלו חומותיו תחתיהן אמר אדני יהוה אמר אדני יהוה Two important considerations are now completely apparent. The first is that of the climactic arrangement of these four visions, with Vision III recognized now as later than Vision IV. Vision I tells of Yahweh's contemplated destruction of the 112 Referring to the visions in this order to conform to their actual chrono logical sequence.</page><page sequence="84">102 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [84] herbage by the locusts which He was just forming for this pur pose, a destruction which, so it seems, would be world-wide and involve not only Israel but also all the other sinful nations; Amos' plea forestalls this and gains a respite and opportunity for repentance and return to Yahweh and His way of life, appar ently not only for Israel, but also for all the nations; Amos' intercession therefore has import both for Israel and for the other sinful nations as well. In Vision II we have the foreshadow ing of the destruction by fire, this time certainly of the entire earth and all its inhabitants, all the sinful nations including Israel; and again Amos' supplication gains for doomed mankind a respite and another opportunity for repentance and return to Yahweh and His life; and again in vain. Accordingly Vision III brings to the prophet through its unfolding picture and its symbolism, revealed by Yahweh, the message that now further pleading is useless, yes, is forbidden; no more foregiveness and opportunities for repentance ; the end has come, with a significant narrowing of the application of the vision, for Israel, the end of its chance of repentance and forgiveness, the end of its cov enant-relations with Yahweh, the end of its existence as a nation. And finally, in Vision IV, Yahweh reveals to the prophet the manner in which the destruction and doom will come, at the hands of Assyria, the all-conquering, irresistible world-power, with the siege of Israel's cities, the falling of their doomed walls, the devastation of the land, the overthrow of the royal dynasty and the complete exile of the people. The climactic progress of the visions and the picture of Yahweh's purpose with Israel, and also to an extent with the nations at large, which they unfold, and their consequent literary unity, are self-apparent.113 "3 It is clear too, as Weiser has emphasized, and as we have agreed, that these four visions, themselves constituting a distinct unit of thought and of literary form, may readily be divided into two pairs, Ï-II and III-IV. I—II then portray Yahweh's purposed destruction of all the earth and the sinful nations upon it and the averting of this dread purpose by Amos' plea on behalf of Israel, with the resultant new opportunities for repentance and forgiveness. III-IV, on the other hand, have centered the application of Yahweh's purpose of punishment and doom upon Israel alone. And in forbidding all further plead ing on Amos' part and denying all further opportunity for repentance and for giveness and in their pronouncement of the absolute doom of Israel as a nation</page><page sequence="85">[85] AMOS STUDIES 103 And this becomes even clearer and its import all the more apparent when we consider the time-sequence of the four visions. The first vision is dated exactly; Amos beholds Yahweh forming the locusts at "the beginning of the coming up of the after growth," i. e. in the spring. The second vision, as most scholars maintain, and as we have agreed, comes a few months later, at midsummer, the time of the most extreme and devastating heat. The third vision comes only three or four weeks after this, near the end of the summer season, when the summer produce has ripened completely and is ready for consumption. And as for the fourth vision, no specific moment of the year is implied in the scene which it depicts; yet in view of the fact that the interval between the second and third visions was manifestly much shorter than the interval between Visions I and II, we may probably infer with reasonable certainty that an even shorter period, presumably about two weeks, elapsed between the third and fourth visions, viz. between IV and III. But if Vision IV was revealed to the prophet near the end of the summer season, then in all likelihood the fourth and final preparatory vision came to him at the very end of the summer season and just before the celebration of the great, annual Asif festival, the most important festival of the entire year, during which the people gathered in vast throngs at the great, national sanctuaries or even pilgrimed in joyous procession from one main shrine to another in festal celebration. And, as we shall soon see, Vision V came to Amos while at Bethel during the celebration of the festival, and in all likelihood on the־ last, the great day thereof, the New Year's Day,"4 just as he had completed his entire prophetic address and mission and, after his denunciation of Amaziah, was turning away from the great sanctuary to depart and in the manner thereof, they are indeed the very antithesis of I-II. Yet with. the removal of the question and answer dialogue from III-IV their form be comes apparently identical with that of I-II, and the difference between the two pairs of visions not nearly as pronounced as it would seem at first, and as Weiser would emphasize it. And certainly the inherent unity and climactic sequence of the four visions are much more positive and significant than Weiser's more or less artificial arrangement of them into two pairs. "&lt;Cf.

Two important conclusions flow from all these various con siderations. The first deals with the psychic or psychological nature of these visions. The coming of visions or hallucinations such as these with steadily diminishing intervals between them is a well-recognized condition with psychic personalities, tem peramentally predisposed to such experiences, such as Amos undoubtedly was. We must realize accordingly that in the mere fact of these successive visions we have to do with a by no means uncommon psychic phenomenon. That these hallucinations or visions should have taken the form they did and have dealt with the themes which find expression in them reveals unmis takably the general direction and content of the prophet's more or less constant meditation in the solitude of his shepherd profession and of his growing conviction and passion. He must have pondered long and deeply upon the conditions of life, par ticularly as they obtained in the larger and more powerful and economically and culturally more advanced Northern Kingdom, and interpreted these both from the point of view of his own humble calling and station and also from that of his intense devotion to Yahweh and his conviction that Yahweh had insti tuted for His people and for all mankind a certain form of life. It was a form of life with simple customs and social relations; it reflected a democratic point of view which approximated very closely in fact, as in theory it agreed absolutely with the old, 115 Or even less than this, six or seven days perhaps. For if our contention be correct, that Amos delivered only one single address, and this on the very last day of the eight-day festival, and if it be presumed that Amos delivered his address immediately upon his arrival at Bethel, that, in other words, he did not come up to Bethel until the very last day of the festival, then it is quite possible, and even probable, that Vision III, the final, preparatory vision, came to him in his home at Tekoa only after the festival had actually begun and carried with it the irresistible impulse to go at once, before the festival had come to an end, to Bethel, the great sanctuary, and there proclaim his divine message before the vast, assembled throng, an audience such as, as he must have known full well, he could have upon no other occasion in the year. The eight days of the festival would have allowed him more than ample time to carry out this plan.</page><page sequence="87">[87] AMOS STUDIES 105 simple, democratic, semi-nomadic life which Israel's ancestors had lived, as shepherds like himself, in the latest desert period of their history and during their early sojourn in Palestine. This was the life which alone was pleasing to Yahweh and which by His covenant with them He had obligated His people to live. And from this life they had departed far, very far, and that too, not unwittingly nor unwarned by Yahweh, but willfully, deliberately, defiantly. It was indeed a grievous sin, conscious transgression, open rebelliousness, פשע in the strictest sense of the term. The realization of all this must have troubled Amos, with his sensitive, sympathetic soul, yearning for the ethical rehabilitation of his people with its god, exceedingly. How must Yahweh Himself react to all this; how must He manifest His will and purpose for Israel ? Along these lines Amos' thoughts and meditations must have run during the long silences of his solitary shepherd life until they developed eventually into a veritable obsession. And gradually conviction deepened, passion was aroused, and a psychic state was induced and became stead ily more and more intense, which led to the first and then to the succeeding visions. With Amos these visions could deal with no theme other than Yahweh's purpose with Israel in the light of its deliberately and flagrantly violated covenant-relations with Him. Further than this we may not go in this direction; this is a task for the psychologist. Whether these visions were actually experienced in a physical, concrete manner by Amos or were pure figments of an overly sensitive, deeply emotional and highly stimulated mind and soul, we are not competent to say. It is enough to have laid the foundation for this particular investigation of the psychological aspects of Amos' work. But whatever conclusion be reached, this much is certain, that Amos actually experienced these visions, if not objectively, then subjectively, psychically, but in either case with the same reality for himself and with equally absolute conviction. He had beheld Yahweh, so he firmly believed, beheld and heard Him. Yahweh had• indeed spoken to him ; therefore he needs must prophesy. Yahweh had called him from following his flock, had revealed a message to him and sent him upon a mission. And unresistingly</page><page sequence="88">106 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [88] he must go and proclaim this message to the people for whom it was destined and thus fulfill his mission. What if it were a mes sage of judgment, of retribution, of repudiation and doom; the message must be delivered, betide him what may. Nor, once the commission given and the message fully communicated, might the divine messenger delay. He must go upon his mission at once, and not hesitate nor turn back until the message be fully delivered, the mission completely fulfilled. Thus, whatever the psychological nature of the visions may have been, must Amos' thoughts have run. And this in turn makes the second important conclusion perfectly clear. These four visions were the indispensable pre paration for Amos' prophetic career. All four must have preceded his setting out for Bethel. Without all four visions in their proper sequence his message would have been incomplete, incomprehensible either to himself or to his audience, ineffective, and his commission as a prophet would have been unconvincing to both himself and the people whose doom he was sent to pronounce. And it needs but a brief survey of the four visions, particularly in the form and sequence in which we have recast them, to make it clear that all the basic elements of Amos' message to Israel were communicated to him therein. There we first behold Yahweh as the world-god, intent upon bringing destruction to all the nations, impliedly because of their sins against Him, and thus forecasting the denunciation of the nations in 1.3-2.3. We behold Amos pleading on behalf of Israel and Yahweh thereby diverted from His first purpose, not only once but also a second time, precisely as Amos, in turn, in 4.6-11 pictured to his audi ence Yahweh's forebearance with Israel. We hear then Yahweh's dictum, לא־אוסיף עוד עבור־לו, "Never again will I forgive him," foreshadowing Amos' repeated declaration to the sinful nations and to Israel in particular, לא־אשיבנו, "I will not let him return (to Me)"; the opportunity for repentance and forgiveness has passed; therefore, even as in 4.12, must Israel now prepare to meet its God and be judged and doomed by Him. And finally we hear the manner of the doom pronounced upon Israel, the conquest and devastation of the land by the irresistible enemy,</page><page sequence="89">[89] AMOS STUDIES 107 with the implied defeat in battle, the siege and conquest of Israel's strongest cities and the razing of their walls, the exile of the people, poor and rich, weak and powerful, oppressed and oppressor, humble and arrogant, the overthrow and annihilation of the royal family, the end of the nation. The entire content of Amos' message in its broad outlines has been communicated to him in these four visions. Before he sets out upon his mission he knows in full the message which he is charged to deliver. There is no actual need for any supplementary, later revelation in subsequent visions. His preparation for his task is complete. It remains for him only to go, but to go at once, upon his God appointed mission. And so Amos set out, probably just after the Asif festival had begun, in ample time to arrive at Bethel on the last day of the festival, the New Year's Day, the climax of the entire festival celebration, when sacrifices were being offered in heaped-up abundance, when the sacred dances were being performed,116 when the festival frenzy and madness were at their height, and the throngs at the national shrine were thickest, and the occasion for proclaiming his divine message of Yahweh's purpose of doom was the very best. And as he wended his way up to Bethel he had ample opportunity to ponder upon the full import of the message he was to deliver and the manner in which he could deliver it most effectively and with maximum conviction. And the realization must have come to him that he could present this message in no more effective manner and with no more convincing sequence of thought than as it had been presented to him. And so, as we shall see, in his address at Bethel his main thoughts unfolded themselves in practically the same order as they had come to him in these four successive, pre paratory visions. But before we may approach this task of the analysis and interpretation of the address proper, we must first consider Vision V, in 9.1, and determine its occasion and import. That this vision differs in essential respects from the four preparatory 116 Cf. my "Two Ancient Israelite Agricultural Festivals," JQR, NS, VIII (1917), 31-54.</page><page sequence="90">108 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [90] visions is evident from its opening statement. It does not begin, as do the first four visions, כה הראני יהוה, "Thus Yahweh let me (or "caused me to") behold," but simply, ראיתי, "I beheld." No longer is the vision purposed by Yahweh, but, at least so this introductory statement seems to imply, it is quite incidental, something which more or less just seemed to happen, rather than to have an integral and indispensable role in the preparation for and fulfillment of Amos' prophetic mission. Moreover, this vision came to Amos in the precincts of some temple, in the immediate vicinity of the altar. A number of scholars, and Weiser in particular, have contended that this sanctuary could not have been that at Bethel. Weiser holds that it must have been some sanctuary in the vicinity of Amos' home in Tekoa. Their arguments are altogether forced and unconvincing. What would be the import for the particular prophetic mission of Amos, directed primarily to the Northern Kingdom, of a vision of the destruction of some local sanctuary in the vicinity of Tekoa? Moreover, this picture here of the sanctuary with elaborate altar, pillars and threshold hardly comports with any local sanctuary in the vicinity of Tekoa. These must all have been small, unimportant affairs, none of them sufficiently extensive and elaborate to be equipped in this manner. Nor have we archaeological evidence of the existence in the vicinity of Tekoa of any sanctuary like this. And while, unquestionably' this description might well apply to the Temple at Jerusalem, the question becomes doubly pointed, what import for the prophetic mission of Amos to the Northern Kingdom would a vision of the destruction of the Temple at Jerusalem have? There can scarcely be any doubt that the sanctuary of the vision is the great Northern national sanctuary at Bethel. But if so, then it follows almost of necessity that this vision must have come to Amos during his visit there in the fulfillment of his prophetic mission. It was on this occasion that he was so keyed up mentally and emotionally as to become susceptible to such a psychic experience. But if this vision came to Amos while he was at Bethel, either in the course of or just after he had concluded his prophetic address and his denunciation of Amaziah, then it follows necessarily that it can not have been</page><page sequence="91">[91] AMOS STUDIES 109 a part of his preparation for his prophetic ministry, as were the first four visions, that it came to him entirely unexpectedly and incidentally, just as the introduction, ראיתי, implies, and that in consequence it was of an altogether different nature and purpose and played an altogether different role in Amos' prophetic ministry than did the first four visions, that, as has been said, it was more or less incidental, and even without it Amos' prophetic mission would actually have been completed. The analysis of the vision is exceedingly uncertain and difficult due in the first place to the manifest corruption of v. la, and in the second place to the doubt whether any of the w. which follow are actually a part of the vision, and if so, just what portions of these w. are integral thereto. There has been wide divergence of opinion on this last question. In fact there seems to be only one point upon which there is fairly general agreement, viz. that vv. 5-6 are not a part of the vision, but, just as the manifestly closely related 4.13; 5.8; 8.8, they are a late insertion of liturgical character, a kind of doxology as it were."7 The genuineness of the remaining vv., 2-4, 7, in the vision is a matter of dispute. An enumeration and discussion of the various textual emendations and interpretations of the passage would be interesting but futile. We may therefore proceed immediately to our own solution of the problem. Our first con elusion is that w. 2-4 are not integral to the vision at all, but are a late insertion, probably from the post-exilic period. Marti has called attention to the similarity of these vv. in form and thought to Ps. 139.7-12. In fact the similarity is so striking that it seems almost certain that the one passage is dependent upon the other; and if this be granted, then the next, inescapable conclusion is that Ps. 139.7-12, marked, as it is, by all the freshness and vividness of originality, is the pattern and Am. 9.2-4 is the copy; and practically all modern commentators are agreed that Ps. 139.7-12 is a post-exilic composition. More over, it is significant that, in striking contrast to the almost "י For an interesting and suggestive, though by no means convincing treatment of these w., cf. T. H.

Oriental Society, XIX (1935), 23-26.</page><page sequence="92">110 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [92] hopelessly corrupt state of the text of v. 1, the text of vv. 2-4 is in almost perfect condition. Gressmann would omit both 3'משם in v. 2 and, probably correctly, מנגד עיני in v. 3. Oort and Grâtz would read nijç; for יחתרו in v. 2, despite the fact that this same word is used again in v. 3. Probably it would be better to retain יחתרו and emend בשאול to לשאול. Otherwise, however, except for these small, inconsequential emendations, the text of w. 2-4 seems to be in complete and perfect condition.118 And perhaps the simplest explanation of this striking contrast between the condition of the text of v. 1 and that of w. 2-4 is that v. 1 had become corrupt already at a fairly early date, whereas w. 2-4, inserted much later, at a time when textual preservation and transmission had become much surer, and likewise, again in contrast to v. 1, expressing ideas quite con ventional and generally comprehensible in the age in which they were inserted and thereafter, were preserved in practically their original, unmodified form. However, the most significant consideration is the fact that w. 2-4 completely misunderstand and contradict v. 1. Appar ently, as we shall see, the opening portion of v. 1, in which the deep-seated textual corruption exists, deals with the vision of an earthquake destined to destroy the sanctuary and cause the death of many people. To this Yahweh adds the pronouncement that all those who escape destruction by the earthquake will meet their end by the sword, i. e. will fall in battle or be slain in the wide-spread slaughter and devastation which follow upon a great national defeat; not a single fugitive shall escape this fate. At first glance, but only at first glance, as we shall soon see, this picture does seem to contradict Amos' previous proclamation of exile as the fate in store for the great mass of the nation, those who would actually survive the conquest by the irresistible enemy. But all the more then do w. 2-4, follow ing immediately upon v. 1, and seeking obviously to reaffirm and reenforce the pronouncement there of the destruction by death in one form or other of every member of the nation, go too far. The statement of v. lb, "No fugitive shall escape, nor 118 Perhaps in v. 3b and again in v. 4a for סשם we should read merely שם.</page><page sequence="93">[93] AMOS STUDIES 111 shall any survivor rescue himself," is absolute and neither needs nor permits any amplification. The meaning of the half-verse is not at all that which w. 2-4 would ascribe to it, viz. that if any fugitive should escape and any survivor rescue himself, it will still be all in vain, for wherever he may go Yahweh will still still Tind him out and destroy him, whether in heaven or She'ol, at the bottom of the sea or in the traditional hiding-places of the caves on Mt. Carmel. Rather the meaning of v. lb is quite plain; no fugitive shall escape nor any survivor rescue himself because from this double destruction, by earthquake and by sword, neither fugitive nor survivor will remain. Furthermore, v. 4 presents a disturbing thought. In the first place, after the pronouncement in v. 1 that those who survive the earthquake Yahweh will slay with the sword, the return in v. 4 to slaughter by the sword as Yahweh's final method of disposing of the survivors is weak indeed, a manifestation either of literary incapacity or of secondary composition; and between these two alternatives we must perforce choose the second. Also we note that in v. 4, not as in v. 1, but precisely as we find in Ezekiel,"9 the sword is personified as Yahweh's conscious agent of destruction, another indication of late literary affiliations. And, as Lôhr, Guthe, Riessler and Nowack have recognized, v. 4b is decidedly Jeremianic in its thought and wording.120 Moreover, the theological concept here expressed, that even in a foreign land Yahweh's power can reach out to destroy, or, in turn, to protect, His people, actually found its first positive expression only with Jeremiah.121 True, Amos had conceived of Yahweh as a world-god who visits judgment and punishment upon all nations. But, as we have contended, Amos had, and could have had, no full realization of all the implica tions of this new doctrine. In his actual, personal religious "»14.17; 21.14ff. ; 30.4; 33.2-6; 38.21; cf. also Isa. 34.5f.; Jer. 12.12; 25.29; 46.10-14; 47.6; Zech. 13.7. "° Outside of Gen. 44.21 שים עיני occurs only in Jer. 24.6; 40.4. לרעה occurs only seventeen times in the entire Bible, nine of which are in Jer.; לטובה only sixteen times, of which six are in Jer.; the combination, לרעה ולא לטובה, outside of this passage only three times, all in Jer. 121 Jer. 29; cf. also Mai. 1.5, where the doctrine in its practical reality seems still so novel as to occasion surprise and to require ocular proof.</page><page sequence="94">112 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [94] thinking he still conceived of Yahweh as practically subject to the old limitations of national power, of power which did not reach out beyond the boundaries of His own country.1" Therefore he must announce to Amaziah that he would die in an unclean land, unclean because Yahweh was not there, and there was in consequence no possibility of worshiping Him there. And likewise he could proclaim exile in a foreign land as the ultimate doom of the people, for in that far-distant land Yahweh would not be present, nor would His arm reach out to protect and sus tain them; there, away from their land and their god, they would be a people entirely without divine protection and therefore utterly doomed. And in the light of this, Amos' practical religious belief, it is clear that the exile itself is the utter end of destruction, punishment and hopelessness for the people ; there can be nothing beyond this. But in the light of this consideration the threat in v. 4a, that even in captivity in the land of their enemy Yahweh would still seek out the survivors and slay them, is absolutely meaningless; only after the proclamation of Jeremiah's message, that even in a foreign land Yahweh can still come unto His people and protect and prosper them, and that therefore they may settle down in Babylonia and rehabilitate themselves there, can this threat here, that in the foreign land, the land of their captivity, Yahweh will seek them out and slay them, have mean ing and arouse terror. Certainly v. 4 can not come from Amos; can in fact not be earlier than Jeremiah; and if not v. 4, then certainly also not w. 2-3, with which v. 4 is an inseparable unit of thought and literary form. And that v. 7 too is not an integral part of the vision is almost self-evident. This has been granted by the majority of modern biblical scholars, who recognize that in its present setting the v. has absolutely no connection either with what precedes or what follows and that accordingly, if it be retained for Amos at all, some other setting must be found for it. Baumann, Nowack, Marti, Harper and Gressmann apparently would retain the 121 That this doctrine was current in the Northern Kingdom still in the days of Amos and for a generation or more thereafter is evidenced by the narrative in 2 Ki. 17.24-28, with its primitive theological basis of the inseparable rela tionship between a deity and his land.</page><page sequence="95">[95] AMOS STUDIES 113 v. as part of the vision, but manifestly with considerable uncer tainty and hesitation and, so it seems, chiefly because they know not what else they might do with it. Only Weiser insists upon positive grounds that v. 7 must be an integral part of the vision, just as he likewise retains w. 2-4. But to achieve this end he must rearrange v. 7 in the order, 7bca, and likewise insert it between v. 4a and v. 4b. He argues that the entire vision must conclude with a supreme threat of the direst calam ity. He realizes that v. 7, no matter how it be rearranged, does not contain such a threat in its final, absolute, climactic form; accordingly he transposes the altogether conventional and absolutely colorless v. 4b to the end of the vision ; but the ineffec tiveness of the conclusion thus attained is the best proof of the weakness of his whole hypothesis and reconstruction. Moreover, if our contention be granted, that w. 2-4 are a late interpolation, then the connection for v. 7, if it be retained for this vision, must be sought, not with v. 4, but with v. 1; and manifestly no such connection exists. On the other hand, as various scholars have recognized, the direct form of address in v. 7 indicates that it was spoken directly to the people, in other words, that it must have been an integral part of Amos' spoken address, which, as we shall see, the visions, and particularly Vision V, certainly were not. There is nothing whatever in 9.1, or for that matter in 9.1-4, with their repeated reference to Israel in the third person, which would suggest that, like v. 7, with its use of the second person, they were a part of Amos' actual address. Unques tionably then v. 7 can not have been an integral part of Vision V. In due time our task will be to ascertain the precise place in Amos' address in which 9.7 stood originally and then to interpret it in that setting. For the present, however, we may dismiss it from further consideration. This brings us accordingly to the conclusion that all of Vision V that has been preserved in this passage, is contained in the single v., 9.1. The entire v. is simple and perfectly com prehensible with the exception of the clause, ויאמר הך הכפתור וירעשו הספים ובצעם בראש כלם. But here almost insuperable dif ficulties exist. Unquestionably in ובצעם בראש כלם some deep rooted corruption exists, for as they stand the words are absolutely</page><page sequence="96">114 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [96] incomprehensible. The versions offer almost no assistance what ever. In consequence biblical scholars have been compelled to fall back upon pure conjecture. Naught would be gained by enumerating all the various conjectures and seeking either to prove or disprove any or all of them. It resolves itself into the determination of which conjecture seems most probable, to fit in best with the conditions and tenor of Amos' prophetic ministry. Now the one thing which does seem to be fairly certain is that Amos beholds in the vision the destruction of a sanctuary, a main sanctuary, since the altar, or perhaps better, the temple structure itself is supported by columns. The temple is destroyed by Yahweh's smiting the columns so that they shake and totter and, impliedly, fall and with them, of course, the entire edifice. The further implication is also that in the collapse of this great temple many people, participating in the worship of the day, lose their lives. Perhaps in consideration of the implication that the number of those who perish is sufficiently great as to con stitute a major catastrophe, we may be justified in inferring that the occasion was the celebration of one of the great annual festivals. The situation would then parallel very closely the incident recorded in Ju. 16.23-30. But, of course, we may not assume that the cause of the collapse of the temple here was the same as there. Far rather, the picture here of the destruction of the temple in this manner by Yahweh is that caused by an earthquake. And that this destruction was so understood in the post-exilic period may be inferred from the insertion of w. 5-6, with their vivid portrayal of an earthquake sent by Yahweh, as an elaboration, in liturgical form, of Vision V. All this has long been recognized by biblical scholars. Accordingly Volz, with keen insight and acumen and following a hint given by LXX, would reconstruct the difficult passage as follows, דך הכפתור וירעשו הספים ויאמר אבצעם ברעש כלם. It must be admitted that this reading fits quite well the general setting, with the picture of the earthquake as the background. It has accord ingly been accepted by a large number of scholars."3 Budde, quite correctly, feels that אבצעם is hardly the correct verb to 1ננ Marti, Sellin, Weiser and others.</page><page sequence="97">[97] AMOS STUDIES 115 describe the effects of the collapse of the temple as the result of an earthquake with the resultant slaughter, and so proposes ארעצם for ובצעם. But even with this change the proposed emendation does not satisfy completely. In the first place, ואחריתם is hardly the correct word here. Actually ואחריתם can not mean "and the rest of them," but only, "yea, the very last one of them."12'' The simplest emendation, and one conforming fully to the require ments of the context, is to read ושאריתם, or perhaps ושארית העם, for ואחריתם. Even more awkward and disturbing is the repetition of the object in כלם with its pronominal suffix, after it has already been expressed adequately in ארעצם, or however we should emend ובצעם. Of course this reading is by no means impossible, but it does make the impression of awkwardness and awakens sus picion. Following a suggestion of Elhorst"5 I would redivide the words somewhat and read 126.אשכלם Also for ובצעם, instead of "4 In support of the translation, "and the rest of them," for ואחריתם, which the context quite clearly demands, Amos 4.2 and Ezek. 23.25 are usually cited. But a moment's consideration shows that in Amos 4.2 ואחריתכן means, not "and the rest of you," but "yea, the very last one of you." And in Ezek. 23.25, where ואחריתך occurs twice, the meaning in each case is exceedingly doubtful. Cornill and Bertholet would translate the first ואחריתך, "And thy posterity"; v. 25b, in which the second ואחריתך occurs, they regard as an explanatory gloss. Hôlscher too apparently feels the impossibility of translating ואחריתך "the rest of thee," for he renders the first ואחריתך "Dein Gesâss" and the entire clause, "Durchs Schwert fàllt dein Gesâss," a monstrosity of translation indeed and obviously prompted by sheer desperation. V. 25b he too regards as a gloss. Inasmuch as v. 26 patently is the direct continuation of v. 25aa, since ונתתי . . . יסירו and all that intervenes disturbs the connection, the simplest solution of the problem here is to regard the whole of v. 25a(3b as a gloss, a gloss absolutely unintelli gible in this context, and in particular with the meaning of ואחריתך in both cases altogether uncertain. But from all this it follows that there is not a single instance in the entire biblical literature where אחרית has indubitably the mean ing, "rest, remnant." I!s Elhorst's complete emendation of this passage, ובצעי בצע מבר אשכלם, which involves merely the supplying of בצעי after the ו of ובצעם and then a redivision of the words, is ingenious and interesting in the extreme, but as the attitude of later scholars indicates, scarcely acceptable. 116 The basic meaning of שכל is, of course, "to slay children," secondarily, "to bereave parents of their young." In Lev. 26.22 and Ezek. 14.15 wild beasts are the agents of such destruction, and this very appropriately, since pre</page><page sequence="98">116 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [98] Volz' אבצעם or Budde's ארעצם, I would read 127,אלעס and like wise, with Volz, ברעש for the ברי of בראש. However, it may be possible to salvage something more of the original text of Vision V than merely what is contained in 9.1. Seemingly alone of modern scholars, Guthe has recognized an apparent relationship between the thought of 3.14-15 and that of 9.1, without, however, drawing any further conclusion. And indeed the relationship between these two passages does not become altogether clear until we understand definitely that 9.1 envisages the destruction of the sanctuary at Bethel by an earthquake; then, however, the relationship becomes immediately self-apparent self-apparent ; for unquestionably the picture of Yahweh's destruction of the sanctuary of Bethel and of the adjacent palaces in 3.14-15 is that of a destruction, not at the hands of a con quering and ravaging enemy, but by an earthquake.127* Marti has established convincingly that w. 13-15 in their present setting stand absolutely without connection either with what immediately precedes or with what follows; but from this he draws the further and not at all necessary conclusion that w. 13-15 constitute an independent utterance of the prophet, either complete in itself or else fragmentary. This conclusion manifestly sumably wild beasts in Palestine attacked little children rather than adults. In Ezek. 5.16 famine is associated with wild beasts as the agent of the kind of destruction implied in the term, שכל, presumably too because children are as a rule the first to succumb to famine. But in Deut. 32.25 and Lam. 1.20 the sword is the agent of the destruction described by שכל, and here manifestly the implied meaning is no longer "to slay children" or "to bereave parents," but rather "to slay in great numbers, to slaughter, to massacre." In Jer. 15.7 שכלתי is used in parallelism with אבדתי and with את־עסי as the object of both verbs, clearly with the specific meaning, "I slaughtered." The verb is used here in Amos 9.1 in precisely this same meaning; cf. also Ezek. 36.12, 14. 127 Cf. Ps. 2.9; Job 34.24 and especially Isa. 24.19, and in fact the whole of w. 18-20, where, in a graphic picture of an earthquake, רעע is one of the descriptive verbs. Or, not impossibly, though seemingly a bit less probable, we might read אך^?ןם ; cf. Ps. 74.14; 2 Chron. 16.10 127a So already the mediaeval Jewish commentator, Çimhi; in fact it is not without interest and even significance for this study that Kimhi correlates the earthquake of 3.14-15 with the earthquake in the days of Uzziah of 1.1 and Zech. 14.5.</page><page sequence="99">[99] AMOS STUDIES 117 means no more than that Marti could interpret the passage only negatively, but not at all positively. Wellhausen, followed by Nowack, Lôhr, Sellin and Budde, would omit v. 14b on the ground that it does not fit into the present context. Sellin would go so far as to insert it after 4.12, a procedure which is, however, rightly rejected by Budde. That w. 13-15, or at least 14r-15, do not belong in their present position, may be regarded as quite certain. But the matter may not be allowed to rest with this negative conclusion. Assuming that the w., either wholly or in part, are actually from Amos, then, just as Sellin saw correctly, we must endeavor to determine where they may have stood originally. Now within v. 14 the expression ביום פקדי . . . ופקדתי is manifestly inelegant and altogether unworthy of such a master stylist as we have seen Amos to be. The expression, ביום פקדי or עד יום, occurs in only three other biblical passages, Ex. 32.34; Jer. 27.22; 32.5, and all three are recognized by the vast majority of modern biblical scholars as secondary and comparatively late. It is impossible not to draw the same conclusion with regard to Amos 3.14a and to regard this as an editorial clause inserted to provide a proper introduction to and connection for w. 14b-15, after they had been removed from their original position in the book and inserted into their present place. Furthermore, the appreciation of this import of v. 14a establishes also that w. 14b-15 have no necessary nor apparent connection with v. 13."7b There is accordingly no longer any reason why w. 14b-15 may not be regarded as the continuation of 9.1, as constituting the concluding, missing portion of Vision V, and so be transferred to their original place. And when this is done the appropriateness of the procedure is immediately self evident. Within the w. three minor emendations suggest themselves. In v. 14b the use of the plural, מזבחות, followed immediately by the singular, המזבח, seems both inelegant and suspicious. Accordingly Oort has very properly emended מזבחות to מצבת, and in this has been followed by Valeton, Elhorst, Stade, von "נ'ל The original position in the book of v. 13 will be considered in due time.</page><page sequence="100">118 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [100] Gall, Marti, Gressmann and Budde. Furthermore, it is readily apparent that metrically v. 14b must be arranged thus; ופקדתי על-מצבת בית-אל / ומדעו קרנות המזבח / ונפלו לארץ i. e. it falls into the form 3+3+2, a metrical form by no means uncommon either in Amos or in other prophetic writings.1270 But it must be admitted that the final bar, ונפלו לארץ, adds a thought altogether superfluous and quite commonplace. Isa. 22.25 offers a partial parallel to the sequence, גדע ונפל, and Isa. 14.12 offers a partial parallel to the sequence, נגדעה לארץ; but both these passages are recognized by practically all modern scholars as quite late. While, therefore, there is no positive and absolute justification for such a procedure, it seems not at all amiss to regard ונפלו לארץ as a late, editorial expansion of the original text.I27d Certainly without these two words the passage is more vigorous and seemingly more in conformity with Amos' oft-noted economy of words and remarkably concise style. Also in v. 15 בתים, following so closely after בתי and the twice-mentioned בית of v. 15a, seems likewise both inelegant and commonplace. Budde cites Isa. 5.9 in partial defense of the expression, only, however, to reject it in the end. Marti, by analogy with Ezek. 27.15,1270 would emend רבים to 128,הנמים and in this is followed by Proksch, Gressmann and Budde. This, of course necessitates the further slight emendation of בתים to בתי ; and it must be admitted that בתי ההבנים would offer 1270 Cf. Torrey, The Second Isaiah, 151-172. "7d Unless perhaps, as an alternative procedure, we might assume that originally we had a 3+3+3 verse here and that a word has been lost at the end. In such case, though entirely without any aid or suggestion from the versions, we might venture to supply some such word as ונבלעו. The clause would then supplement graphically the picture of the effects of the earthquake, and would be vigorous enough even for Amos. Furthermore, this one word in particular would create an interesting paranomasia with ונגדעו, while the resultant chiastic form of the sentence would likewise be noteworthy. How ever, it must be emphasized that this emendation is purely hypothetical, and that the utmost that can be said in its behalf is that it is fairly plausible. "?e Also, so I have been reminded by my colleague, Professor Nelson Glueck, in Cant. 3.10 הבנים should probably be read for אהבה. 128 Or, more correctly, as Budde has suggested, ההבנים.</page><page sequence="101">[101] AMOS STUDIES 119 a close parallelism to בתי השן. In fact the parallelism seems almost too close, and the similarity of the two expressions and the uniformity and monotony of the picture which they call forth seem almost too pronounced. Furthermore, after רבים LXX inserted אחרים. This suggests that in place of the present בתים רבים the original may have read ארמנות, supplemented by some final word, such as העיר or בית-אל or even ההבנים, and that eventually in the master-manuscript the second half of ארמנות and the entire final word became obliterated so that only . . . ארם remained, and this was ultimately expanded, on the one hand to רבים, and on the other hand to אחרים, with, of course, either word necessitating the insertion of בתים. Accordingly we would reconstruct the entire text of Vision V as follows : 9.1 ראיתי את-יהוה נצב על-המזבח ויך הכפתור וירעשו הספים ויאמר ארעם ברעש אשכלם ושארית העם בחרב אהרג לא ינוס להם נס ולא ימלט להם פליט 3.14b ופקדתי על-מצבת בית-אל ונגדעו קרנות המזבח 15 והכיתי בית-החרף על-בית-הקיץ / ואבדו בתי השן / וספו ארמנות .... נאם יהוה: But against this simple appending of 3.14b-15 to 9.1 it might be argued with considerable seeming justification that in this order the thought of Vision V is unfolded somewhat illogically, that we would expect the graphic picture of the effects of the earthquake upon the great sanctuary at Bethel and the surround ing palaces of the nobility to follow immediately upon ויאמר of 9.1, or at the very latest immediately upon ארעם of the same v., and to precede the announcement of the destruction of the people, first by the earthquake, and after, that, and more com pletely and definitively, by the devastating war and ensuing exile, which Amos had proclaimed. Unquestionably were it possible to so rearrange these various parts of the vision as to bring out clearly this sequence of thought without doing too great violence to the text, it would be eminently desirable. But this the present reading of the text absolutely forbids. Perhaps if we might emend ופקדתי to אפקד and thus make possible the insertion of 3.14b-15 after ויאמר of 9.1, and then assume that</page><page sequence="102">120 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [102] before ארעם some noun, referring to the people, and particularly to those present at the festal celebration at Bethel at the time of the earthquake, and thus providing a suitable antecedent for the otherwise exceedingly difficult pronominal suffixes of או־עם and □אשכל, some such word as וישביהם for example, has been lost in the editorial process,129 we might rearrange the text of Vision V in this manner. Actually it would involve the emendation of only two words, an emendation, it must be admitted, decidedly modest, even though finding little or no support in the versions. So emended the text of Vision V would read : 9.1 ראיתי את-יהוה נצב על-המזבח ויך הכפתור וירעשו הספיםaa 3.14 ויאמר אפקד על-מצבת בית-אל ונגדעו קרנות המזבחb 15 והכיתי בית־החרף על־בית הקיץ / ואבדו בתי השן / וספו ארמנותaba 9.1 ו .... ארעם ברעש אשכלם ושארית העם בחרב אהרגa/3b לא ינוס להם נס ולא ימלט להם פליט 3.15 נאם יהוה:b/3 Between these two possible versions of Vision V it is difficult to choose. The latter is perhaps a little more logical and climactic in its thought sequence; but, against this, it necessitates a more radical textual emendation and rearrangement. And perhaps in the first version we may account for the thought sequence thus presented by the assumption that Amos, for reasons quite cogent, preferred to end the narration of the vision with the emphasis laid upon the earthquake and its immediate, terrifying effects, rather than upon the ultimate and total destruction of the nation, still to follow, just as he had predicted. Finally, the full effect of the concluding נאם יהוה may now be determined. Obviously it marks the completion of the vision. But equally and even more significantly it suggests something more. For we shall see shortly that in the final, literary form, as written down, either by Amos himself, or else at his dictation, Vision V constituted the very last portion of the book, its final and, in a way, its climactic paragraph. נאם יהוה is there fore obviously the concluding declaration and summing up, not 1"י In such case it might be possible, though perhaps not preferable, to retain ושאריתם instead of emending it to ושארית העם.</page><page sequence="103">[103] AMOS STUDIES 121 only of the vision itself, but also of the entire book. It is the vigorous and defiant declaration of the great prophet to his misunderstanding and reluctant public that his entire book, all that he had said and that he had recounted therein in its final, written form, all this announcement of the import of the earth quake and of the ultimate and complete doom and annihilation of the nation, was Yahweh's word, His unchanging, irrevocable judgment upon Israel, now begun to be fulfilled in slight measure and sure to be fulfilled completely in a time none too distant. The book ends, just as did the address proper, in a climactic expression of faith in Yahweh and in the truth of his prophetic mission on the part of the prophet and a ringing defiance of the rebellious nation which would not understand and accept the full import of his message. No matter which of the two alternative versions of the text of Vision V we accept, it is self-evident that in form it differs radically from Visions I-IV. Instead of the uniform, three-beat, ten-line form of those four visions, Vision V seems to consist of six lines, totalling twelve bars, and therefore to be longer by two bars than Visions I-IV. Moreover, its bars are of varying, four, three and two beat lengths, and arranged in parallelistic form, 4+4, 3 + 3, and even one line of 3 + 3+3 and with a force ful conclusion in a single two beat line.130 This divergent form serves to emphasize the peculiar character and purpose of Vision V, so completely different from the character and purpose of Visions I-IV. We may now inquire as to the precise import of this final vision, the occasion when it was experienced by the prophet and likewise the reason for its being recorded as and just where it is. We have already suggested that the sanctuary in question, whose overthrow by an earthquake Amos beholds in the vision, must have been the national shrine at Bethel. We have further suggested that this vision, the unforeseen and incidental char acter of which is, as has already been intimated, almost self evident, came to the prophet during his brief stay at Bethel while upon his prophetic mission, and just at the end thereof, And if version II be accepted, also one 4+3 line, unless we may set ויאמר on a line by itself and so read it outside the meter.</page><page sequence="104">122 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [104] just after he had finished his address and as, after his denuncia tion of Amaziah, he was turning away to depart unto his Judaean home. If this surmise be correct, then the vision must have served to confirm to the prophet the truth of his general pro nouncement of the doom of the nation and of his particular denunciation of Amaziah, for it follows necessarily that the destruction of the sanctuary at Bethel by Yahweh would have had a direct effect upon Amaziah's tenure and discharge of the duties of his priestly office. Yet we may hardly believe that this fifth and final vision, so different in most respects from Visions I-IV, and apparently not at all essential to the completion of Amos' prophetic ministry, came to him only to confirm unto him the truth of the message which he had proclaimed and to enable him to return to his home with the gratifying conviction that he had done his work and fulfilled his mission to the complete satisfaction of the Deity who had sent him. Had this been the purpose of the vision, then unquestionably it would have taken an altogether different form and would have told undoubtedly that the Deity addressed to Amos words of commendation; but instead the Deity does not address the prophet directly in this vision nor take actual cognizance of him, but is rather, in momentous contrast to the other visions, in which the actions of the Deity were primarily symbolic, now altogether intent upon the actual work of destruc tion which He is about to carry out; the prophet beholds this vision only as an onlooker, and no longer as an active participant therein; the vision is not intended primarily for him; rather he sees it, as it were, only incidentally and by chance. In this vision the prophet beholds the Deity actually engaged in the work of destruction ; the doom has already begun to set in. But all the more significantly then, it seems at first glance that the destruction is proceeding in a manner not at all foreseen and announced by the prophet. He had proclaimed with complete confidence that the destruction would be at the hands of an all conquering, irresistible enemy, acting as Yahweh's agent of punishment, who would conquer in battle, slay the flower of Israel's youth and carry off the rest of the citizenry into exile. This vision then of the actual destruction of the people by an</page><page sequence="105">[105] AMOS STUDIES 123 earthquake, which he had not announced in his address, might well seem to refute his words and to destroy the effect thereof upon the people. But reconsideration of the vision reminds us that it says that only the beginning of the destruction will be by the earthquake, but that the continuation and completion thereof will be, precisely as the prophet has announced it, by the sword, i. e. by conquest, slaughter and exile. Actually there fore what the vision seems to say is that even though an unusually severe and destructive earthquake may have befallen the nation, the people must not think that this is the end of Yahweh's punish ment and destruction of them which the prophet had proclaimed, and still less must they imagine that the destruction and doom at the hands of the all-conquering enemy, which he had foretold with such absolute assurance, will now not come; of a surety it will still come, and this devastation and slaughter which the earthquake has wrought is merely the begining of the total destruction which in Yahweh's name he had predicted; the situation has not changed in the least. Actually this is precisely what this fifth vision implies. And this in turn suggests the full implication of this vision. 1.1 1.1 records that just two years after Amos had delivered his address at Bethel an earthquake occurred, an earthquake so severe that it served for a very long time, so it seems, as a point from which to date historical events. Certainly it was an earth quake of such unusual intensity and wrought such devastation that the memory survived for over two hundred and fifty years, for still in Zech. 14.5 the earthquake in the days of Uzziah served as the pattern of earthquakes of the most extreme intensity and devastating character; and we may hardly surmise that two such earthquakes occurred within the reign of a single king. Of this earthquake we know that it must have been felt with unusual intensity at Jerusalem. Perhaps the picture of the effects of an earthquake in Zech. 14.4-5, the land splitting up and great fissures, like veritable valleys or canons, opening up in the earth, and the people fleeing in panic to the valleys and gulleys for safety, reflects actual conditions which may have obtained in and about Jerusalem during this particularly severe earthquake and the memory of which may have survived through all these</page><page sequence="106">124 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [106] generations. And, while we have not the slightest evidence thereof, none the less it is not at all improbable that this earth quake may have centered, or at least been particularly severe, at Bethel, none too far from Jerusalem, and that there it may have wrought the maximum of destruction, and especially the overthrow of the great, national sanctuary there. We may go even one step further and assume that this earthquake may well have happened during the week of the celebration of the Asif festival, and even on the very last day thereof, the New Year's day. Various considerations tend to confirm this hypothesis.131 Moreover, already at that time the New Year's Day was regarded as the day of Yahweh's annual judg ment, the day when He took His place in His sanctuary to judge the people and determine their fate for the year just beginning.132 If therefore this earthquake, with its far-reaching destruction, happened just upon the New Years' Day, it would naturally have been regarded by the people as the actual and immediate manifestation of Yahweh's judgment upon them; and this in turn would have had a mighty effect in preserving the memory of this particular earthquake for over two centuries and a half as the pattern of Yahweh's final judgment upon His people and the nations of the world upon the great day of Yahweh, itself the New Year's Day, which would usher in the new age. But if this earthquake, with its epicenter at Bethel and marked by the complete collapse of the great national sanctuary there, befell upon the New Year's Day, then, of course, it must have been while immense throngs were gathered there; and the collapse of the temple structure must have been attended by much slaughter and devastation, a literal fulfillment of the picture which Vision V seems to record. Moreover, if this entire ני ■ני■ In another article, to appear later, a mass of significant evidence, from both biblical and post-biblical sources, will establish conclusively that this earthquake did in very truth happen precisely upon the New Year's Day of the year in which Uzziah was stricken with leprosy and in consequence Jotham became regent, and therefore just two years to the day after Amos had deliv ered his address at Bethel. For the remainder of this article I must ask the reader to accept this conclusion tentatively until the appearance of the above mentioned article. Cf. "The Book of the Covenant," I, HUCA, V (1928), 48ff.</page><page sequence="107">[107] AMOS STUDIES 125 hypothesis be correct, then all this must have transpired exactly two years to the very day after Amos had delivered his message of destruction and doom at this very shrine in the sight and hearing of a vast throng, many of whom had no doubt returned to the sanctuary for the celebration of this same festival two years later. And this cataclysm must have recalled to many of the festival pilgrims who survived the destruction the words of doom which they had heard from the strange Judaean prophet upon this very same day but two short years before. This recol lection must have called forth various reactions among them. Some, perhaps the majority, must have seen in the earthquake complete confirmation of Amos' words. Others, no doubt, less pious and credulous, must have realized that this destruction had not come at all in the manner foretold by Amos, that his words had contained not the slightest hint of this earthquake; and what kind of a prophet could he have been if he could not have foreseen a catastrophe so severe as this? And then after the earthquake had ended and order began to reappear out of the initial chaos, and fears quieted and life once again became normal, many no doubt, even among those who gave a large measure of credence to Amos' words, may well have thought that now it was all over, Yahweh's judgment upon them was fulfilled. The prophet had spoken truly, but naturally with some exaggeration. Beyond this terrible, devastat ing earthquake they need expect no further destruction at Yahweh's hands, for, despite what this strange prophet had said, they were still Yahweh's people and He their god, and even though they might sin against Him and He might punish them in turn, still He could not cast them off completely nor destroy them utterly. This one great cataclysm was punishment enough for their sins; now they might well feel that these were sufficiently expiated and that they could accordingly go upon their normal way and expect a restoration of Yahweh's favor and a revival of their shattered fortunes. And perhaps word of this steadily growing reaction to the earthquake, interpreted in the light of his address spoken just two years before, may have come to Amos in his home at Tekoa. There he too must have experienced the earthquake, even though</page><page sequence="108">126 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [108] in all probability in a manner not so severe as it had been felt at Bethel; and he too must have regarded it as a manifestation of Yahweh's judgment and punishment of His people. But in contrast to steadily growing public opinion, Amos must have realized with complete conviction that this earthquake, terrible though its effects had been, was not at all the end and fullness of Yahweh's judgment upon His people, that in fact it was only the beginning, and at that even only a small beginning, and that the great, total destruction which he had announced two years before, conquest, slaughter and exile at the hands of the enemy, was still sure to come, as sure as it had been two years before when he had uttered his message of doom. And in the face of the growing tide of disbelief and of feeling that the danger was past and that the people might now go the even tenor of their faithless, sinful ways, undeterred by fear of further divine displeasure and punishment, Amos may well have felt an irresistible impulse, which not improbably he may have attributed to divine urge, to write down, or, if he himself could not write, at least to have written at his dictation, a permanent record of his message as he had delivered it at Bethel two years before, so that it might serve as enduring testimony and warning to the people and disabuse them of their self-satisfied feeling of having expiated their sins sufficiently and that now they were again assured of Yahweh's favor. Cer tainly the message was needed quite as much now as it had been two years before. Quite probably this was the occasion of the written record of Amos' spoken words. But merely to record the spoken address itself was not enough, not nearly enough. The present popular thought and conviction had grown out of the interpretation put upon the devastating effects of the earthquake, and particularly as they had affected the national sanctuary at Bethel, and perhaps even the priest Amaziah. All this had double significance in the light of his personal encounter with Amaziah and his pronounce ment of the latter's dire fate. Therefore it was absolutely neces sary to recount that incident as it had actually transpired, that its true and full import might be made clear. And inasmuch as Amaziah had challenged his authority as a prophet and had</page><page sequence="109">[109] AMOS STUDIES 127 failed completely, as obviously the vast majority of the general audience had failed likewise, to comprehend the true nature of his prophetic call, authority and message, it became imperative that this be now presented as fully, clearly and convincingly as possible. Accordingly Amos anticipated in his written record of his prophetic ministry the challenge of Amaziah to him by the account of the four preparatory visions which brought to him, and the narrating of which must now bring to the people, the knowledge and conviction that he was indeed a prophet of Yahweh, a prophet of a new type, with a supreme calling and authority, and that he had been charged to speak precisely the message of absolute doom which he had uttered. Accordingly he wrote down the record of his four preparatory visions at the end of the record of his spoken words and as the indispensable introduction to the narrative account of his contest with Amaziah. Here, it may be remarked in passing, we believe we have the answer to the oft-discussed questions as to the original place in the Book of Amos of this record of the four preparatory visions, and their relation to the biographical narrative in 7.10-15; 3.3-8; 7.16-17, and likewise the answer to that other question, whether the record of these four visions constituted a part of Amos' spoken address or was merely a written record and nothing more. The answer is, of course, that the record of the four visions was not in any way a part of Amos' spoken address, but only a supplementary, written account of his initial, preparatory experiences as a prophet, appended to the record of the spoken address for some such reason as this which, as a very plausible hypothesis, we have ventured to propose. But even all this was not enough to meet the present, dif ficult situation adequately. The mind of the people had to be disabused of the thought that this earthquake marked the end of Yahweh's discipline of Israel, that accordingly in the final analysis Amos had prophesied falsely, or at least only half truly, and that there was nothing further to fear in the way of Yahweh's retribution. And so the fifth, supplementary vision, differing so completely from the four visions which had preceded it. It was the unequivocal affirmation by the prophet that even</page><page sequence="110">128 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [110] this earthquake, which, true enough, he had not actually pre dieted, was not altogether unrevealed to nor unforeseen by him, for still while at Bethel itself, and in the very precincts of the sanctuary, and just as he had completed his prophetic utter ance and mission and was preparing to depart, a new, vision had been vouchsafed to him quite unexpectedly, and it had been given to him to behold Yahweh Himself actually engaged in the work of destruction, bringing an earthquake of such intensity that the very sanctuary, the proud, national shrine, was seen by him in the vision tottering to its ruin and carrying with it to their death all the assembled throng. He had foreseen it all and knew with assurance that this earthquake would surely come. But inasmuch as he had beheld it at the very end of his prophetic mission, and particularly after he had been bidden by Amaziah to prophesy no further, and inasmuch too as, unlike with the other visions, he had received from Yahweh no com mand, either expressed or implicit, to transmit to the people the content of this vision and its application to them, inasmuch as in this vision he had received no communication whatever from Yahweh, but had merely been privileged to behold Him at His work of destruction, he had quite naturally been silent, nor proclaimed publicly that this earthquake would befall the sanctuary and the people. But let them not imagine for one moment that he had not been fully informed by Yahweh long in advance that this earthquake, with all its dire effects, was destined to befall them or that his prophetic authority and direct commission from Yahweh were qualified in the least. And still less let the people dare to believe that this was the end and that Yahweh's wrath and punishment were now spent. This was only the beginning, and all that he had pre dieted in his spoken address, conquest, slaughter, downfall of the royal dynasty, exile of the nation and end of its existence, was sure to follow. Those who had escaped from the earthquake Yahweh would slay with the sword; no fugitive would escape nor any survivor rescue himself. The doom, announced in the spoken address at Bethel, was inavertible, inescapable, still awaited them and must still befall them at the appointed time. Therefore still let Israel prepare to meet its god. Such is</page><page sequence="111">[Ill] AMOS STUDIES 129 the import, so it seems, of Vision V. Not actually integral in the record of Amos' active prophetic ministry, none the less it has its very definite place therein. And so very properly it was appended, not to the written record of Visions I-IV, with which it had no connection whatever other than the fact that it too was a vision, but to the biographical narrative in 7.10-15; 3.3-8; 7.16-17, the immediate continuation and sequel of which it actually was. But it is also the conclusion of the account of the final act of Amos' entire prophetic ministry, the compilation of the com plete record of his address and of the events and psychic expe riences which both preceded and prepared for this phase of his ministry and which followed thereupon. With the conclusion of this written record Amos' prophetic ministry terminated, so it would seem, permanently. He had fulfilled his prophetic mission, fulfilled it faithfully and well. His actual, personal work was done. But his book remained as the lasting monument of his service of his God and as the persistent witness unto the people of their faithlessness and guilt before Yahweh, of His righteous and justified indignation against them, and of the certain doom at His hands which still awaited them. Until the doom should have come, just as the prophet had, at Yahweh's command, predicted it, and the prophet's word should thus be fulfilled, this written record of his complete message and ministry would stand as a living witness against them to convict them in their own, eventual self-judgment and to testify to the world of Yahweh's justice and righteousness and of the life of justice which He would that all nations, His creatures, should live. Or if perchance it be argued that a people absolutely doomed by divine fiat, and beyond all hope of repentance and eventual pardon and resultant remission of the doom would have no need of such a persistent warning and reminder as the written record of the prophet's address would furnish, then it might be answered that Amos may well have prepared this written record of his prophetic experience and ministry, less for the sake of already doomed and hopeless Israel than for that of its sister nation, Judah, likewise Yahweh's people. In Isa. 5 we have convincing evidence thattheverysamesocialevilswhich Amos had denounced</page><page sequence="112">130 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [112] so scathingly for the Northern Kingdom, had by this time begun to manifest themselves in the Southern Kingdom as well, and to such a degree that but thirteen or fourteen years after Amos they called forth from Isaiah an invective as bitter and uncompromising as Amos himself might have uttered. Although Judah's feet were now definitely set in the same path of social injustice and oppression as those of Israel, it had not yet advanced quite so far therein; it was not yet doomed. For it there was still hope, if only it could be warned and could take the warning to heart. Not impossibly therefore this written record of Amos' address and entire prophetic experience may have been directed really to a Judaean audience, rather than to the hopelessly doomed survivors of the earthquake at Bethel. It was to be the ever-present, living warning from Yahweh to Judah, Amos' own people, of the fate in store for them if they did not repent and turn from this evil way before it were too late. Why should not the prophet have been deeply concerned for the future of his own nation? It is a thought which commends itself in many ways. So much then for the five visions and for the biographical narrative in 7.10-15; 3.3-8; 7.16-17, for their interrelationship and for their relationship in turn, as a literary unit, to the spoken address contained in the opening three quarters of the book. In subsequent studies we may turn freely, with the way well prepared and many of the difficulties which impeded it cleared away, to the analysis and interpretation of the address proper. IV 1.1-2 1.1-2 However, one small task still remains to be performed before we may give our attention to the consideration of Amos' address proper, viz. the analysis of what is obviously the introduction of the Book, 1.1-2. The basic problem is, of course, to determine what portion, if any, of these two w. is original with Amos or his amanuensis, and what its precise import may be. The analysis of v. 1 is not difficult in any way, but in the end it remains largely a matter of subjective feeling and impres</page><page sequence="113">[113] AMOS STUDIES 131 sion rather than something which can be proved with absolute certainty. Since 1897, when Budde first presented the thesis,133 the majority of biblical scholars have agreed that the clause, אשר היה בנקדים, is an editorial insertion really dependent upon what, we have seen,134 must have been the original reading of 7.14. The phrase, מתקוע, then must be coordinated with עמוס, rather than with בנקדים, as usually, and, in its present setting, naturally interpreted. Such an identification of a person has ample parallel in biblical literature, and particularly in the older strata thereof.135 A number of scholars136 are of the opinion that the long phrase, בימי עזיה מלך יהודה ובימי ירבעם בן־יואש מלך ישראל, is likewise editorial. They hold, and correctly, that on the one hand, the concluding phrase, שנתים לפני הרעש, fixes the date of Amos' prophetic ministry adequately, and that therefore the additional, long temporal clause is really superfluous. Moreover, this dating of the prophet's activity by the reigns of particular kings con forms exactly to the regular pattern of the late, editorial intro ductions to the large majority of the prophetical books. Budde, however, would retain the first half of the phrase, viz. בימי עזיה מלך יהודה, as indispensable for fixing the date of the earthquake.137 This seems, however, quite unnecessary, for unquestionably the earthquake is represented here as an event of such historical importance and persistent reminiscence that of itself and without the necessity of fixing the moment of its occurrence further it might well serve as the relative dating-point for subsequent '33 Semitic Studies in Memory of Reverend Dr. Alexander Kohut, 106-110; also Wellhausen Festschrift (1914), 65-77. 133 Above, p. 36. '35 In addition to the one passage usually cited, Ju. 12.8, the following may also be enumerated, Gen. 36.33, 36, 37; 1 Sam. 17.4; 2 Sam. 9.5; 17.27; 23.29b ( = 1 Chron. 11.31); 2 Ki. 12.2 ( = 2 Chron. 24.1); 15.2; 24.8; 1 Chron. 11.26 (cf. 2 Sam. 23.24 and 21.19); 2 Chron. 20.37; 25.1. All these passages, even those in Chron., seem to be from or directly dependent upon the older biblical literature, from the pre-exilic period. We may infer therefore that this manner of identifying a man by his home town was current in Amos' day and accordingly see in the name, עמוס מתקוע, further indication of the genuineness of these words. 136 Nowack, H. Schmidt, Gressmann, Proksch and others. '37 Budde regards the entire passage as the work of a Judaean editor, another reason therefore for his retaining this one phrase.</page><page sequence="114">132 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [114] events. And if, as we have contended, this earthquake, just two years to the day after Amos had delivered his prophetic address at Bethel, furnished the occasion for preparing the permanent, written record of this address, then certainly for the audience of his own day, whom the prophet had primarily in mind, this dating, "two years before the earthquake," would need no further definition. It seems best therefore to regard this entire additional, temporal phrase as a unit. But it would seem that not merely this phrase alone, but the entire clause of which it is a part, אשר חזה . . . מלך ישראל, is secondary and editorial. In the first place, the construction itself is awkward and vague in the extreme. As Budde has pointed out, it is not at all clear whether the antecedent is דברי, so that we must translate, "The words or affairs138 of Amos of Tekoa, which he saw," etc., or עמוס, so that we would translate, "The words of Amos of Tekoa, who functioned as a seer," etc. We can hardly imagine that, had the original writer wished to give expression to either of these two thoughts, he would not have done so in a manner which would permit no uncertainty of meaning. Moreover, the expression, (אשר חזה על"(ישראל, which occurs also in Isa. 1.1; 2.1; 13.1; Mic. 1.1; Hab. 1.1, all late, editorial superscriptions of prophetic books or addresses, seems, as Duhm to Isa. 1.1 has suggested, to have something of an eschatological implication. Actually the verb, חזה, in the quite general sense, "to prophesy; to prognosticate," i. e. a synonym of 5?א, and no longer in the specific, technical meaning which it must have originally possessed, is found in biblical writings only from Ezekiel on.135 For these reasons we must conclude that the entire clause is editorial and late. Accordingly we have left as the original introduction to the Book the simple, direct statement, דברי עמוס מתקוע0,־1 שנחים לפני '3' "Die Begebenheiten," as Budde renders it. '3'Ezek. 12.27; 13.6, 7, 8, 9, 16, 23; 21.34; 22.28; Isa. 47.13; Mic. 3.7; Zech. 10.2; Lam. 2.14; Num. 24.4, 16. 1•0י In all likelihood the words, על־ישראל, were original too and so should be included here; this original phrase then would have been expanded by a late editor by the insertion of only the two words, אשר חזה, into the present second ary clause.</page><page sequence="115">[115] AMOS STUDIES 133 הרעש. But in the light of our conclusion that Amos delivered only one, single address, and that on the New Year's Day at Bethel, and that the earthquake which came on the same day two years later and wrought terrible havoc and destruction at the great, Northern, royal sanctuary was the occasion for Amos' writing down himself, or else having written down at his dicta tion, the full address of two years before, this simple, direct introduction has deep meaning indeed. We can hardly imagine that Amos' address would have been written down without some brief and directly pertinent superscription. And what would such a superscription have said other than precisely what these few words do say, and that too in the extremely concise manner which characterizes all Amos' utterances, "The words of Amos of Tekoa (against Israel) two years before the earthquake"? They say practically this, "These words Amos of Tekoa spoke against you, O Israel, two years ago on this very day, as a mes sage of denunciation and doom from Yahweh. But you refused to take warning. Now, on this very same day two years later, this earthquake has befallen you. Realize though that it is not the full measure, but only the beginning of Yahweh's punishment and destruction of you, which, as His messenger, I announced two years ago, and that the complete doom will surely come. Let these words, now written down in permanent record just as spoken two years ago, serve as warning to you, and perhaps also to Judah, and as witness of Yahweh's way of justice unto the nations and unto future generations." These few, simple words of introduction can hardly be aught than the work of either Amos himself or of his amanuensis, prefixed to the address when it was committed to permanent, written form. One slight consideration tends to corroborate this conclusion somewhat. Of all the introductions to the different prophetical books only that of Jeremiah parallels this exactly. It too begins דברי ירמיהו בן־חלקיהו and continues with the simple statement of the family status of the prophet and the place from which he hailed, and then continues with v. 4,141 in which he tells in !4■ V. 4 is the immediate continuation of v. 1 ; w. 2-3, giving the date and duration of Jeremiah's prophetic ministry according to the reigns of the kings</page><page sequence="116">134 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [116] the first person of his call by Yahweh to prophetic ministry. And, as we know, the Book of Jeremiah proper, of which 1.1 was undoubtedly the original superscription, was prepared at the direct dictation and under the immediate supervision of the prophet himself, precisely as we have posited for the Book of Amos. The import of this fact for this study is readily apparent. And even more significant for this study is the fact that in the introductions to only three prophetical books, viz. Ezek., Hag., and Zech., do we find a dating other than the conventional one, by the reigns of the kings under whom the respective prophets ministered, comparable to the שנחים לפני הרעש here, and in each case this dating gives, not a merely approximate time, but rather, the precise moment when the prophet in question gave utterance to the message recorded in his book. It is difficult in the light of this fact to conclude other than that שנחים לפני הרעש here is, not an approximate, but instead a very precise date, "exactly two years before the earthquake," i. e. to the very day. Amos 1.2 has occasioned much diversity of opinion among biblical scholars. The question at issue is whether it is original with Amos or not. The grounds for suspicion of its genuineness are (1) that actually its thought seems to have little affinity with the message of Amos, either in its central theme or in the details thereof, and (2) that v. 2a, with the exception of the opening word, ויאמר, occurs verbatim also in Joel 4.16aa/3 and again in a slightly variant form in Jer. 25.30b. The question is, in which of these three passages is it original. Some scholars, notably Buttenwieser and Sellin, have sought to account for this repetition by the assumption that these words constituted an ancient, common saying or axiom, current in both Israel and Judah, which permitted a rather wide range of application, as is manifest in the variant supplementations of the clause in each of these three passages. Budde, however, is inclined to ridicule this assumption. He argues instead that the passage was original with Amos and that the introductory ויאמר comes of Judah, are, of course, the work of the late Judaean editor of the prophetic books, as practically all modern scholars are agreed, and as their contents show unmistakably.</page><page sequence="117">[117] AMOS STUDIES 135 from the late editor of the Book of the Twelve, who set Joel just before Amos with the result that Joel 4.16a preceded the beginning of the Book of Amos by only a few lines; and by inserting this v. here with the introductory ויאמר he declared that the words found in Joel 4.16a, but a few lines above, really came from Amos. This is ingenious indeed, but on the whole far-fetched and improbable. Moreover, even were his hypothesis correct, it fails completely to take into consideration the variant version of this sentence found in Jer. 25.30b. Now if these words had actually been spoken by Amos, it would be our task to determine into just what context in his spoken address they might fit. And then more than ever it would be clear that they fit, even poorly, into not a single, authentic utterance of Amos, and that they have nothing at all in common with Amos' thought or message. Budde and other scholars, no doubt correctly, see a reference to the earth quake in these words, and support this argument by the context in Joel 4.16-17 in which these same words occur. Actually the passage can not possibly come from Amos. The clear implication of the sentence is that Yahweh dwells in the Temple at Jerusalem, and that from there His destructive influence reaches out even to the farthest boundaries of the Northern Kingdom. But it must be admitted that such an argument would hardly have had an effective appeal for the citizens of the Northern Kingdom. If anything, it would have tended rather to awaken their chau vinistic resentment and antagonism to the prophet and his message. And it is exceedingly doubtful whether Amos, with his inchoate but none the less real concept of Yahweh as a universal god, could have actually conceived of Him as resident in any one sanctuary, whether that at Jerusalem or elsewhere. Actually, as I have endeavored to show in another work,142 the belief that Yahweh had taken up His residence specifically in the Temple at Jerusalem, as is here pictured, could not pos sibly have developed before the Deuteronomic Reformation, almost a century and a half after the time of Amos, with its basic program of the institution of the single, central sanctuary; "The Book of the Covenant," I, HUCA, V (1928), 37-81.</page><page sequence="118">136 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [118] and actually it is doubtful whether this doctrine, which came in time to play a most significant role in the theology of Judaism, could have acquired definite and positive formulation before the post-exilic period and the erection of the Second Temple. And even then, as Isa. 66.1, for example, shows clearly, this doctrine did not by any means find universal acceptance. In the days of Amos and immediately thereafter, as we know most clearly from the J Code, the dominant conception of the abode of Yahweh was that He dwelt in heaven, and from there descended upon occasion to commune with His people. Such a concept alone in this period fitted the general picture of Yahweh as a universal god. And that this concept of Yahweh's dwelling place persisted in Israelite religion and in subsequent Judaism is manifest not only from such passages as Isa. 66.1,143 but also and particularly from Jer. 25.30b, the variant version of Amos 1.2a and Joel 4.16a, for there Yahweh is represented as dwelling, not in Jerusalem and on Zion, but on high, i. e. in heaven, His holy habitation. Moreover, in Jer. 25.30b these words appear as a quotation from an older original, which the prophet is charged to direct against the sinful nation. It is recognized by practically all scholars that this entire section of the Book is not from Jeremiah himself, but is the product of the post-exilic age. But how much earlier than this the original of the quotation in 25.30b may have been it is impossible to determine. Still less can it be determined which is the original form of the quotation, that of Jer. 25.30b, which represents Yahweh's particular dwell ing-place as being in heaven, or that of Amos 1.2a and Joel 4.16a, which represents Yahweh as dwelling in the Temple at Jerusalem. And between the two latter passages it is impossible to deter mine with absolute certainty which is the older and the original, or whether perhaps, just as Buttenwieser and Sellin maintain, in all three passages these words represent variant versions of an older, widely current saying. Only this much seems quite certain, that Amos 1.2 seems to have nothing at all in common with Amos' well authenticated thought and message, and that the particular picture of Yahweh dwelling in the Temple at *« Cf. also Ps. 2.4; 11.4; 103.19; 113.4-6; 115.3; 123.1; Lam. 3.41; Eccles. 5.1; also perhaps Job 16.19.</page><page sequence="119">[119] AMOS STUDIES 137 Jerusalem was far indeed from Amos' own belief and that of his age and his particular Israelite audience. Therefore the entire v. must be set down as a gloss, in all likelihood much as Budde has maintained, but with an altogether different implication, coming from the editor of the Book of the Twelve.144 '** However, it is not impossible to account by conjecture for the presence of 1.2. Regardless of what its actual origin may have been, the version in Joel 4.16 is an integral part of its setting, indispensable to the complete thought of the passage. Furthermore, whatever Yahweh's roaring, as implied in the verb ישאג, may have originally connoted, thunder perhaps, or even the roaring of the lion, in this passage, as the continuation of the v. indicates, it depicts the deep, roaring, rumbling noise of the earthquake. Moreover, an earthquake of extreme magnitude is here conceived of as a part of the phenomena of the Day of Yahweh. In this respect the picture here agrees completely with that of the Day of Yahweh in Zech. 14, with its earthquake likened to the terrible earth quake in the days of Uzziah. Here the picture goes even beyond, and far be yond, that of Zech. 14; here the earthquake will even affect both heaven and earth. It is indeed the utmost extreme in the depicting of an earthquake. Now actually in the genuine portions of Amos there is not a single verse, other than the extant portions of Vision V, in 9.1+3.14b-15, which refers to an earthquake. As we have intimated, in Amos' spoken words there was no suggestion whatever that Israel would be visited by a devastating earthquake as the beginning of Yahweh's repudiation and punishment of it. Only in Vision V do we find any reference to the earthquake, but with the explicit intimation that Amos received the revelation of the earthquake which was actually to be fall the land just two years later, just as he was turning away to depart from Bethel. Furthermore, as we have seen, he included his account of Vision V in the written record of his book in order to affirm to his readers that he had known of the earthquake in advance of its coming and as the immediate sequel to his de liverance of his message; and from this he bade his readers take warning and interpret the earthquake aright, as but the beginning of Yahweh's punishment. But what more natural than that some late editor should have felt that Amos' book would be incomplete, his announcement of the doom not altogether effec tive, and his authority as a prophet open to serious question, did his book not contain some word, no matter how brief, ascribed to Amos, indicating that he had announced the earthquake too to the people in his spoken message at Bethel? And if so, then what more natural than that this editor should have borrowed from Joel 4.16, immediately preceding, these few words, which there are linked with the prediction of a most devastating earthquake, an earthquake which was associated with the Day of Yahweh, i.e. also with the New Year's Day, and have inserted them into the book of Amos, and that too at the very beginning, and thus have given concrete expression to his thought that Amos must surely have said something in his address about the earthquake? This assumption would also give a significant meaning to the introductory ויאפר,</page><page sequence="120">138 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [120] which, as we have noticed, is lacking in Joel 4.16. In this setting the word would seem to imply, not quite what Budde has suggested (JBL, XLIII [1924], SO), viz. that it was actually Amos, and not Joel, who had originally uttered these words, but rather and even more, that, taking the cue from Joel 4.16 that these wotds depict an earthquake, Amos also had said "Yahweh will roar from Zion," etc.; that, in other words, Amos did utter a significant and predictive word about the earthquake. That the conclusion of the v. in Amos 1.2 should differ entirely from the conclusion in Joel 4.16, that, in other words, this editor could borrow no more than the half-verse and was compelled to conclude the v. in his own way, is easily explained. The formulation in Joel 4.16 is eschatological, looks to the far-distant future, future even to the editor of Amos 1.2. But this latter passage, even though predictive from the standpoint of the prophet himself, from the standpoint of the editor deals with a historical event or condition of the past. Destructive and devastating though the earthquake in the days of Uzziah had been, it could nevertheless not be truthfully said of it that it had shaken heaven as well as earth. Therefore the whole of Joel 4.16a could not be applied to it; the editor, in inserting the quotation into Amos 1.2, was constrained to supply something more fitting for Joel 4.16a7■. Accordingly he supplied what now con stitutes Amos 1.2b. If, following Jerome, we may assume that נאות הרעים refers to the grazing lands of southern Judaea, while ראש הכרמל refers to the summit of Mt. Carmel at the northwestern end of the Valley of Jezreel, then we may infer that this editor meant to imply by his words that the entire country, from the far south to the extreme north, would be shaken by the earthquake. (However, not impossibly נאות הרעים means "grazing lands" in general, and not specifically those of southern Judaea, and הכרמל connotes, not Mt. Carmel, but "garden land" in general, cultivated land, in contrast to grazing country [cf. Isa. 10.18; 16.10; 29.17; 32.15, 16; Jer. 4.26; 48.33], ראש הכרמל then would mean, not "the summit of Mt. Carmel [in contrast to 9.3], but "the best of the garden land" [cf. Josh. 11.10; Jer. 22.6]. However, even so interpreted, the clause would designate, with an effective figure of speech, the entire country.) This thought he expressed, not in ordinary, prosaic language, but in a manner quite poetic, not at all unworthy of the prophet himself, and couched in the regular 3+3 measure of not only the first half of the v., but which also predominates in the prophet's spoken address. The procedure of the editor was by no means ineffective. It must be emphasized again that this entire assumption and argument are conjectural, even though they do seem reasonable. But if the conjecture and the resultant conclusions have any weight at all, then we must conclude further that this editor must have done his work at some time after Joel had been inserted into its present position, immediately preceding Amos, in the Book of the Twelve. (Cf. Wolfe, "The Editing of the Book of the Twelve," ZAW, NF, XII [1935], 107f.; however, I would fix the date of the incorporation of Joel into the Book of the Twelve somewhat earlier than does Wolfe, viz. about 310-300 B.C.). Furthermore, if our interpretation of the reference to the sum mit of Carmel be correct, that it was regarded as marking the extreme northern</page><page sequence="121">[121] AMOS STUDIES 139 Accordingly, of 1.1-2 we find as authentic, as coming either from Amos himself or from his amanuensis merely the simple, natural statement in 1.1, in every way a worthy introduction to the Book, a summary of its contents and a statement of the occasion of its being written down, (דברי עמוס מתקוע (על־ישראל שנתים לפני הרעש ; nothing more. But this simple statement enables us to fix the date of Amos' prophetic ministry, confined, as we have seen, to a single address, and therefore to a single day, with almost exact precision. We have concluded that the statement, "two years before the earthquake," must be interpreted with absolute literalness. We have first well-grounded, though for the present still tenta tive, reason for believing that Amos delivered his address at Bethel upon the New Year's Day, the day of the fall equinox. We conclude furthermore from a quite remarkable and com pletely rounded out chain of evidence, to be presented in a subsequent article, that the great earthquake in Uzziah's reign likewise happened upon the New Year's Day, i. e., of course, exactly two years to the day after Amos delivered his address. Moreover, we shall see that the complete tradition, as pieced to gether from its various sources, told that it was upon this day, the New Year's Day upon which the earthquake happened, that Uzziah-Azariah functioned as high-priest in the Temple at Jeru salem and was stricken with leprosy. The tradition then goes on to tell that it was because he was afflicted with this defiling disease Uzziah was disqualified from further functioning as king, and, by implication, also as high-priest of the Jerusalem Temple. Undoubtedly then this day and this occasion marked the nominal boundary of the land, then the composition of the v. in its present form must be ascribed to a period when Galilee was not reckoned as a part of the national territory. This would probably point to a time within the Persian period, and perhaps before the Samaritan schism became absolute and final; for, as 2 Chron. 30.10ff. clearly indicates, after the Samaritan schism had become definitive and within the Greek period Galilee came to be regarded again, just as we find it in the New Testament records, as thoroughly Jewish and closely integrated with Jerusalem and Judaea. This would probably point to some moment in the first half of the 4th century B.C. as the time of the composition of Amos 1.2 and its insertion into its present position.</page><page sequence="122">140 JULIAN MORGENSTERN [122] accession of Jotham to the throne and the beginning of the sixteen years of rule which 2 Ki. 15.33 ascribes to him. Amos then must have delivered his prophetic address at Bethel two years to the day before the accession of Jotham to the throne of Judah. If therefore we could determine exactly the accession year of Jotham, we would know likewise the precise date to the very day of Amos' prophetic ministry. Unfortunately, however, just this datum is one of the great and troublesome uncertainties of biblical chronology. As is well known, the chronological data of just this period of both Israelite and Judahite history are so confused and contradictory as to make it quite impossible to fix the precise dates of the reigns of the various kings with aught more than reasonable probability. The majority of historians who venture any specific dating for the reign of Jotham set his ascension to the throne, while his father, Uzziah, was still alive, in 750 or 749 B.C. If this be correct, then it follows that Amos must have delivered his address at Bethel on the day of the fall equinox of 752 or 751 B.C. Begrich, who has made the latest and most exhaustive study of the chronologies of Israel and Judah,145 fixes the date of Jotham's accession as either the fall of 758/7 or of 747/6 B.C. If this dating be correct, then, of course, Amos' date would be the day of the fall equinox of 760/759 or 749/748 B.C. Between these various datings the confused chronological data do not permit a certain conclusion. But relatively at least the date of Amos is fixed with exact precision. And now, with these two w. and the questions and con elusions incidental to them out of the way, we may proceed in the continuation of these studies to the analysis and interpréta tion of the address proper which Amos delivered at Bethel on the New Year's Day two years before the earthquake. {To be continued.) 1,5 Chronologie der Kônige von Israel und Judah, (1929), 155.</page></plain_text>
