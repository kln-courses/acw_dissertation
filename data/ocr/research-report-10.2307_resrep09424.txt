Working under the assumption that Salafi behavior is caused by a specific ideological  interpretation of the material conditions of a movement, this study identifies two main themes  and two modes of behavior in Salafi ideology. It shows how these themes and modes  constitute a four-field matrix in which the Salafi interpretation of reality takes place, and  behavioral options for the movement are identified. This approach, as the title suggests, is  dynamic, because it allows for an analysis of an unlimited set of attitudes of a Salafi actor.  The immediate advantage of this method is that it allows for much more detailed insight into  the motivations of an individual, group or network, while enabling the scholar or practitioner  to alternate the set of questions according to the objective of his research or intelligence  needs.    The second part of this study combines this dynamic approach to Salafi activism with Social  Movement Theory.

A few dozen men and children sit on carpets arranged along the walls of a  small courtyard somewhere in Pakistan. Most of them are clad in the traditional, loose-fitting  1    </page> <page sequence="4">    Pashtun dresses that are worn by most men in the Pakistan-Afghanistan border area. A few  gas lamps light up the musing faces of the bearded men in the front row. The children, rapt in  awe, gaze at the young man with the white knitted hat and scarf wrapped around his  shoulders. He is singing a nasheed, a traditional-style Islamic song, that is called ”Dying in  order to live”. It calls on the crowd to join Jihad and die for Allah on the battlefield. What  makes the scene bizarre: The tune sounds like a corny Western pop song with a melodramatic  chromatic modulation after almost every stanza – and the lyrics are in German. The online  clip is a production of Jundallah Studios, the media arm of the militant Islamist group  “Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan” (IMU).  The young Jihad-artist is one of two brothers from Bonn, the former capital of Germany, who  i went to Pakistan to join Al-Qaeda (AQ) in its fight against the West.  They are not alone.  During the past decade, a growing number of young Germans have sought their way to  ii training camps of AQ and its militant affiliate groups.  Meanwhile, Germany has become a  target of Islamist terrorism itself. Since 2000, at least 12 terror plots in Germany have been  registered. All but one failed or could be foiled: In March 2011, Kosovo-born Arid Uka  succeeded in opening fire at Frankfurt Airport, at a bus carrying U.S. airmen bound for  iii Afghanistan, killing two soldiers and wounding two others.   German authorities and the media alike have linked this recent domestic Islamist militancy to  the rise of a new Islamic movement in Germany, which is most often referred to as Salafism.  iv The young militants had previously been active in this Salafi milieu,  and they have often left  in groups to join Global Jihad. The argument runs in line with the dominant opinion among  students of Islamist terrorism, who have been noting that a strategic defeat of terrorist groups  v can only be achieved if their ideological and material support networks can be destroyed.   Consequently, the growing interest in the German Muslim militants puts domestic Salafi  groups and preachers into the limelight. This is not only true for the German arena. In recent  2    </page> <page sequence="5">    years, Salafi ideology has drawn a lot of scholarly attention, and a number of writings have  vi been published on the matter.   Despite this public interest in Germany and beyond, there is still some confusion not only as  to how to deal with Salafism but moreover, what it actually is and what its proponents want to  achieve. In German media usage, the term is often somewhat ill-defined as either an “ultra- conservative” or “radical” form of Islam. The claim that Salafism is conservative stands in  strong contrasts to the Salafi self-understanding and praxis of reforming Islam and trying to  follow an alleged true path by disposing of most of existing Muslim culture, belief and praxis.  But the claim that Salafism is radical also has to be re-visited. It is certainly true in the sense  that Salafis are fundamentally opposed to Western society and its focus on individual freedom  and happiness. However, the term radical is also commonly used to differentiate an  individual or organization from the mainstream, implying a phenomenon that would emanate  from the fringes of a particular society. As we shall see in case of Salafi networks in  Germany, this assumption is, to a large extent, wrong.  Even though there is a tendency amongst Salafi groups to limit or even avoid contact with  non-Muslim mainstream society in Germany, much of their ideology would be considered  mainstream in countries in the Arabian Gulf, and specifically in Saudi Arabia. Also within  Germany, many Salafi groups and individuals have proven to be able to interact with all  segments of society if it suits their purpose. Salafis have been active in inter-faith events,  vii appeared in televised Talk Shows,  cooperated with local politicians in various  municipalities, developed connections to street milieus of young Muslims, especially, and  established ties to other Muslim organizations in Germany and abroad.  The network character of Salafism in Germany, with its wealth of informal ties and multiple  affiliations spanning from AQ militants to established Muslim preachers who cooperate with  local politicians, and the lack of a clear-cut distinction among different Salafi groups, pose a  great challenge not only to students of Islamism and Islamist terrorism but also to German  3    </page> <page sequence="6">    decision makers and the security apparatus. This problem is aggravated by the absence of  studies on Salafism in Germany. Much of the scholarly literature has focused on processes of  individual radicalization and the militant extremes of the Salafi movement. Yet only little  research exists on the Salafi scene itself, in which these processes of radicalization often take  place and to which the militant groups are linked. This narrow focus on the militant side of  Salafism is understandable, given its importance to counter-terrorism efforts. But it also  under-appreciates the wider problem of Salafism as a new anti-democratic, anti-liberal  movement in the West that is fast growing and increasingly influential amongst Muslim  communities, not only in Germany.  viii There are only a few studies of Salafism in the West,  and there is even less research on  ix Salafism in Germany.   It has been argued that the difficulty of understanding Salafi actors lies not in a diversity of  x ideologies within Salafism.  All Salafis principally share the same creed. They differ,  however, in the contextual reading of the religious sources, i.e. the transformation of the  divine word into practical action in today’s world. This divergence in interpretation is  manifest in a multitude of different trends within the Salafi movement, ranging from Salafi  preachers who hold inter-religious dialogue with Jews and Christians, to militant ideologues  of AQ; and from small, introverted communities to the religious establishment of Saudi  Arabia. To make matters worse, Salafi actors have proven to significantly change their  interpretation of what is correct Islamic practice according to changing circumstances. One of  the most-cited examples of this is the fatwa issued by the former Saudi Grand Mufti Bin Baz  justifying the presence of U.S. troops on Saudi soil following the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait in  1990. His decision earned him a lot of fierce criticism from younger Saudi preachers, who,  unlike Bin Baz, did not hold official government posts and felt much less loyalty to the house  xi of Saud.  Another important Salafi preacher, Sheikh Nasir Al-Din Al-Albani, significantly  altered his judgment of the rival Islamic schools of Sayyid Qutb and the Muslim Brotherhood  4    </page> <page sequence="7">    later in his career, when he realized that his rigorous stance was alienating a large part of his  xii own audience.  This was not the only one of Al-Albani’s “turnovers”, but none of them  necessitated a principal change of his ideology. Not only scholars but also entire Salafi  organizations have shown repeated changes in course. Egypt’s Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiyya, is one  example; it started as a network of independent circles at Egyptian universities loyal to the  state, and evolved into an influential organization that used violence to enforce what it  claimed to be Islamic behavior. Subsequently, the group openly mobilized against the  government. Parts of it evolved into a disciplined military organization, only to recede to a  xiii non-violent stance after a massive crackdown by the Egyptian military in the 1990s.  None  of these different modes of behavior led the organization to abandon its Salafi ideology. To  reconcile theory and praxis, all it had to do is re-interpret its ideological principles to justify  its new programmatic orientation. This flexibility of political behavior is also a feature of the  Salafi movement in Western societies.  Scholars of Islamism and counter-terrorism have tried to answer the question of the nature of  different radical Muslim groups by attempting to categorize them. Hegghammer rightly  xiv summarized many of the previous such attempts as focusing on political preference  – most  notably Wiktorowicz’ classification of Salafism into a xvpurist, a politico, and a jihadi faction   – and proposed a categorization of Islamist groups according to their dominant rationale,  instead. Both attempts, however, create theoretical constructs that are unable to adapt to the  dynamic character of Salafi praxis and discourse.  The first part of this paper will therefore try to tackle the problem of conceptualizing Salafi  activism by deciphering the religious justifications of Salafi actors in terms of their profane,  political content. This content will then be reviewed in order to develop a new approach to  analysis that accounts for the diverse and dynamic nature of Salafism. The second part of this  paper will then apply the new approach to the Salafi networks in Germany.  5    </page> <page sequence="8">    The goal of this paper is thus threefold. First, it aims to understand why Salafism, an ideology  that eschews political pluralism and claims there is only one, narrow path to paradise,  translates into a highly diverse social movement. Second, it will then utilize this  understanding to map out a model of Salafi behavior. Finally, this model will provide a new  and systematic outlook on the Salafi movement in Germany. The following three research  questions derive from these goals:  6    </page> <page sequence="9">    Research Questions    1. What causes the diverse and dynamic behavior of the Salafi movement?  2. How can this behavior be conceptualized?  3. What does this tell us about the Salafi movement in Germany?    Before we can start answering these questions, we need to clarify our concepts of Salafism  and Islamism.  The following explications of Salafi ideology occasionally make use of specific Islamic  terms, printed in italic type, that are transliterations of the Arabic original. At their first  appearance in this paper, these terms are followed by a short explanation in brackets. A more  detailed description can be found at the end of this paper under the List of Islamic Terms.    7    </page> <page sequence="10">    Theoretical Background    The Salafi Ideology  Islamism  A number of scholars prefer the terms Islamic Fundamentalism or Neo-fundamentalism to the  xvi term Islamism. There are two major arguments against this.   The label Fundamentalism originated in United States of the 1920s, and was used to refer to  Protestant Christians trying to reaffirm the literal text of the Bible in the face of scientific  xvii theories and philosophical skepticism.  These Christians lived in an already secularized  society. The first Islamist mass movement, the Muslim Brotherhood, emerged around the  same time but in a very different social constellation, characterized by centuries of stagnation  and resistance to the deep social changes with which the developing market society had swept  xviii the Western hemisphere.  The second argument against this term is of a religious nature. A  “fundamental institutional tension”xix runs through Western history. In Christianity, the  division between the worldly and the sacred can be traced back to Jesus’ caution in Mark  12:17 to “Give to Caesar what is Caesar's and to God what is God's.” In contrast, Islam since  xx its inception has proclaimed the unity of religion and rule.  These arguments, of course, are  known, and have not remained undisputed. One of their notable critics is Olivier Roy, who  argued, ”the key question here is not what the Koran actually says, but what the Muslims say  the Koran says.”xxi This is certainly so, but it does not answer the question of whether Islamic  scripture and culture are factors that influence what ”Muslims say the Koran says”. After all,  religion is open to interpretation, but the interpreting act refers to the same object, i.e. the  specific religion. Interpretation is bound to the indissoluble something that it interprets.  Hence, the question that should be raised is what part is played by the historical ”striking  fusion of political power, economic utility, and the sacred”,xxii which was Islamic society, for  today’s Muslim communities in a secularized world?  8    </page> <page sequence="11">    This problem leads to another difficulty for the study of Islamist movements, which are  distinct from Islam but not simply because they have a political agenda. The International  Crisis Group tried to solve this issue by changing its definition of Islamism from “Islam in  political mode” to the more general “Islamic activism”, meaning “the active assertion and  promotion of beliefs, prescriptions, laws, or policies that are held to be Islamic in  character.”xxiii  This notion solves one problem but creates another. It no longer supposes that Islam is  apolitical per se. But at the same time it dispenses with the difference between Islam and  Islamism.  Roy argued that Islamists make a distinction between a society that is composed of Muslims,  and a society that is Islamic in its foundation and structure, which legitimizes the use of the  term “Islamism”.xxiv This focus on the self-understanding of Islamists helps to appreciate the  difference of Islam and Islamism, just as the previous focus on the political nature of Islam  helps to avoid the pitfall of creating artificial distinctions.  xxv In mainstream Islam, religion is an intrinsically public concern.  Yet Islamists criticize that  the umma has deviated from the Islamic ideal. Despite being predominantly Muslim, state and  society are supposedly not truly Islamic. To get rid of this error, Islamists advocate a greater if  not dominant political role for Islam. Therefore, the term Islamism, as it is used here, is  necessarily iridescent. It refers to a political activism that is Islamic in its ideology, but at the  same time distinct from most Muslim communities and states.    Salafism  Defining Islamism is a challenge. To come to terms with what in recent years has most often  been summarized under the label “Salafism” is certainly no easier a task. The term as it is  used in the media and scholarship refers to a variety of different groups and movements with  often highly diverse ideas, goals and tactics.  9    </page> <page sequence="12">    Salafism has appeared in scholarly publications since the early 20th century, but was only  xxvi introduced into Western media in 2000,  when it became known as the ideological basis of  a transnational Islamist militancy that targets Western countries, their military and their  citizens. In fact, before 9/11 there was little mention of Salafism by Western media outlets,  and only a few scholars were concerned with the topic. With the attack on the Twin Towers  and the subsequent bombings in Europe, this rapidly changed. Most of the research on  Salafism has reflected the focal point of public interest: how is Salafism connected to Muslim  xxvii radicalization and Islamist terror attacks?  These questions, of course, are important.  However, they fall far short of helping to understand Salafism as a religious ideology and  movement. A meaningful notion of Salafism should try to trace its ideological and historical  roots, rather than commence with its violent, contemporary extreme. This shall be done in the  following, in order to clarify the subject of this research.    As-Salaf as-Salih  The word “salafism” is a neologism. It derives from the Arabic salaf (forefather), and refers  roughly to the first three generation of Muslims, the so-called as-salaf as-salih (the pious  ancestors), whom modern-day Salafis idealize as a perfect Islamic community and model for  xxviii the future. The last of these generations died out around 810 CE;  however some limit the  xxix period to the four rightly-guided Caliphs (632-661 CE),  while others include the Islamic  xxx scholar Ahmad Ibn Hanbal (780-855 CE) as the last of the virtuous community.   The use of the term salaf was transmitted by a number of early Islamic scholars, a fact that is  often referred to by Salafis. Among them is the founder of the Hanafi school of fiqh (Islamic  law), Abu Hanifah (699-767 CE).  He is alleged to have said: “Adhere to the athar (narration)  and the tareeqah (way) of the salaf, and beware of newly invented matters for all of it is  innovation.”xxxi xxxii Ibn Taymiyya,  for modern Salafis certainly the most important of the  earlier scholars, wrote on the self-appellation “salaf”: “There is no criticism for the one who  10    </page> <page sequence="13">    proclaims the madhab (way) of the salaf, who attaches himself to it and refers to it. Rather, it  is obligatory to accept that from him by ittifaaq (unanimous agreement) because the madhab  (truth)”.xxxiii(way) of the salaf is nothing but the haqq   From early on, the notion of salaf was closely connected to the idea of Islamic authenticity  and purity. Nothing less do Salafis today claim for themselves and their religious practice:  that only they believe in and practice Islam as it was prescribed by Allah and his messenger.  To legitimize the distinction of the purportedly pure aqida (creed) and manhaj (practice) of  Salafism from other Muslim communities, Salafis often cite a hadith (saying of the Prophet  Muhammed) that was transmitted by several scholars and which is considered sahih  xxxiv (sound):  “My ummah will be divided into seventy-three sects, all of whom will go to the  hell fire except one sect.” They [the companions] asked: “Who are they, O Messenger of  Allah”. He said, “They are those upon what I and my companions are upon.”xxxv  Salafis believe that they are this firqa najiyya (saved sect), which on yawm ad-din (the Day of  Judgment) will be spared from hell fire, while most other Muslims will be punished for their  sins before being allowed into heaven.    Wahhabism  Contemporary Salafi ideology derives mainly from three historically and geographically  distinct traditions: Saudi Wahhabism, the Indian school of Ahl-e-Hadith, and the early  “Muslim Reformists” in Syria and Egypt.xxxvi  Of these three, Wahhabi ideology was the first attempt to “purify” Islamic doctrine and  practice. In 1744, Muhammad Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab, a Hanbali scholar of the Banu Tamim  Tribe on the Arabian Peninsula, entered an historic alliance with the ruler of a local city-state  called Diriyya, Muhammad Ibn Saud. The bond between a rigid class of ulama (Muslim  scholars) and the governing family of the Saud would become the basis for the Saudi state,  11    </page> <page sequence="14">    xxxvii which exists until today.  In it, the ulama provides religious legitimacy for the ruler, who  in return delegates much of his power over domestic affairs to the religious establishment.  Abd Al-Wahhab preached a return to what he claimed to be the fundamentals of Islam, the  Qur’an and the tareeqah (traditions) of the Prophet Muhammad.  Of Abd Al-Wahhab’s small  number of writings, his Kitab Al-Tawhid (book of monotheism) is most important for  outlining the Wahhabi ideology. Its central argument focuses on the Islamic principle of  tawhid (the oneness of Allah). Abd Al-Wahhab distinguishes among tawhid ar-rububiyya  (unicity of creation and lordship of Allah), tawhid al-asma wa as-sifat (the unicity of Allah’s  99 names and attributes as found in the Qur’an), and tawhid al-ibada (unicity of  xxxviii worship).  The latter, in particular, stood in stark contrast to most popular Islamic  practices, such as saint worship and the celebration of the prophet’s birthday, and also to other  streams of Islam, such as Shi’ism and Sufism.xxxix Abd Al-Wahhab claimed that his  contemporaries had deviated so far from the path of the first three Muslim generations that  society had fallen back into a state of jahiliyya (lit. period of ignorance, the era preceding  xl Islam),  which the newly established kingdom had to fight by force.     Ahl-e-Hadith  The second school important for the development of modern Salafism is the Ahl-e-Hadith in  India. It developed in the 1860s and 1870s around Nazir Husayn in Delhi, and Siddiq Hasan  Khan in the princely state of Bhopal. While Abd Al-Wahhab had promoted a return to the  sources of Islam, he still relied on the Hanbali school of jurisprudence for his fatawa  xli (religious rulings, sing. fatwa).  Yet his call to return to Qur’an and Sunna as the only  sources of religious judgment necessitated renewed study of the Hadith as the body of  scriptures describing the Sunna of the prophet. The Ahl-e-Hadith focused not only on the  reading of the Qur’an but also the study of the Hadith as the legal sources for the umma  (Muslim community). Like Wahhab, they opposed Shi’ism and Sufism, adopted a literal  12    </page> <page sequence="15">    reading of the Islamic sources, and rejected reason as epistemologically invalid, similar to the  xlii aforementioned Ibn Taymiyya.  From early on, the Saudi Arabian ulama established close  ties to the Ahl-e-Hadith. A number of important scholars went to India for their studies,  including Saad Ibn ’Atiq (1850-1930), who would become judge of Riyadh, Imam of the  Grand Mosque and an influential teacher for the later Grand Mufti of Saudi Arabia, Abd Al- Aziz Bin Baz (1910-1999).    Muslim Reformism  The third group, the scholars of “Muslim Reformism” mainly active in Syria and Egypt from  the end of the 19th century, is the youngest influence on the development of Salafism. They,  too, called for a return to the Islamic sources as the answer to the deep social and economic  crisis that was omnipresent in the Muslim Middle East in general and the decaying Ottoman  Empire in particular. These reformists shared with Wahhabism and Ahl-e-Hadith a rejection  xliii of taqlid (imitation) of the traditional Islamic schools of jurisprudence  and a call for ijtihad  (interpretation) to find an answer to modern day problems by returning to the Islamic sources.  The three names commonly associated with Muslim Reformism at the end of the 19th and  beginning of the 20th century are Jamal Al-Din Al-Afghani (1838-1897), Muhammad Abdu  (1849-1905), and Rashid Rida (1865-1935). However, Al-Afghani and Abdu did not follow  the anti-rationalist teachings of Ibn Taymiyya. Rather, they were part of the Ash’ari School  and not Salafis in the contemporary sense, which is why they are sometimes also referred to  xliv as liberal salafiyya.  Both lived in Europe for years, and developed close relationships with  a number of Europeans. While Al-Afghani remained outspoken against British and French  imperialist influences in the Muslim world, Abdu in 1888 returned to Egypt from his exile in  Paris, acquiesced to British dominion in the country, and concentrated on internal social and  xlv educational reforms.  Rida, in contrast, had little direct contact with the Western world.  xlvi Except for some very basic Turkish, he only knew Arabic.  He was strongly influenced by  13    </page> <page sequence="16">    Muhammad Abdu, with whom he published the journal Al-Manar in Cairo. In his earlier  years Rida made a clear distinction between European expansionist politics, which he  opposed, and European culture, which he embraced as the source of a renaissance for Islam.  After the defeat of the Ottomans in WWI, the subsequent occupation of the Middle East and  the abolishment of the Caliphate in 1924, Rida and many of his contemporaries changed their  view of Western culture. The idea of a decaying Western world doomed to fall also fed on  European misanthropist thought and the rhetoric hostile to civilization that was blooming  xlvii between the two world wars.  Soon Rida grew closer to the ideas of Ibn Taymiyya and Abd  xlviii Al-Wahhab, to which he had hardly been exposed before.  Rida’s journal Al-Manar  became the most important medium for the spread of Muslim Reformist ideas at the time and  pivotal for a young self-taught scholar from Albania, who would become one of the most  influential Salafi preachers of the 20th century. Muhammad Nasiruddin Al-Albani was not  only influenced by Al-Manar but also by the circles of Muhammad Bahjat Al-Bitar, which he  attended during his time in Damascus. Al-Albani, other than his Damascene teachers,  radically rejected the use of reason for the study of the Hadith. Thus, instead of discussing the  content of the sayings of the prophet, he made it his discipline to study the sanad (the  Hadith’s chain of oral transmission). As the prophet was considered infallible in religious  matters and his sayings not subject to interpretative reason, all that could be called into  question were the human beings who had transmitted a Hadith. This analysis of transmission  is called ’ilm ar-rijal (science of men). It became the most important aspect of Hadith studies  xlix for Al-Albani, as it was necessary to authenticate a particular Hadith.  Al-Albani's studies  had a great impact in Saudi Arabia, where his call for an independent verification of the  religious sources was used by a younger generation of ulama to break away from the Saudi  state’s official doctrine.l    Immanent problems of a definition   14    </page> <page sequence="17">    Saudi Wahhabism, the Indian Ahl-e-Hadith, and Muslim Reformism showcase similar  features that can provide a basis for a definition of Salafism. Like all definitions, the  definition of Salafism simplifies the proper object for the purpose of analysis by cropping its  incommensurable parts. The definition provides a theoretical construct, which can inform the  real-life issue. It would be a mistake, however, to take the definition for the object itself.  This is not an idle mind game; it is an acute problem in academic debate, as well as in the  li intelligence community.  The use of a clearly defined term carries the risk of missing  important aspects of the object in question. The changing nature of the object itself is not  lii reflected in the static term used to define it.   Identifying the traits of Salafi ideology does not give us access to the minds of Salafi  ideologues, who might be driven by a whole range of issues divergent from Salafi ideology.  Herein lies a problem for the concept of ideology itself: A thought – or ideology as a set of  thoughts – does not exist in itself but only through the thinking of individuals. A concept of  Salafism that wants to inform us about the existing Salafis would therefore have to cover not  only the historical lines of Salafi ideology but also the contemporary opinions of its  proponents. The question thus arises of whether individuals who are considered Salafis but  who deviate from our concept of Salafism should no longer be considered Salafis, or whether  we should change our concept of Salafism to accommodate the new reality.   Especially when analyzing Salafism as a social movement, one has to draw a clear distinction  between an ideologically-refined, theoretical notion of Salafism and the existing social  networks, groups and individuals summarized by the labels “Salafi movement”, “Salafi  milieu”, “Salafi scene” and the like. It will be useful to separate both issues linguistically,  also. We shall henceforth use the term “Salafism” to refer to the yet-to-be-defined Salafi  ideology. Terms like “Salafi network, movement etc.” will be used to refer to the  corresponding social organizations that exhibit Salafi ideology in their statements, writings,  and actions. This is not to say that Salafism is the only ideology relevant in these networks,  15    </page> <page sequence="18">    nor does it mean that ideology as such is the only cause for their social cohesion. The Salafi  movement is an analytical object in its own right. Grasping Salafi ideology can be a first step  to understanding the movement itself.    Concept of Salafism  Keeping these reservations in mind, we can formulate a concept of “Salafism” based on four  dominant principles: tawhid, Sunna, the rejection of reason, and ijtihad.  Tawhid – strict monotheism – is the focal point of Salafi thought. It encourages the Salafi to  dedicate himself entirely to the serfdom of Allah. This total submission is seen as necessary  for a pure creed and praxis. Every other aspect of human life is rendered unimportant before  the commandment to worship nothing but the one and only God. While all Muslims are  monotheists, the Salafi concept of tawhid reaches much further to include not only belief but  also the behavior of the individual Muslim. Every act in accordance with the sharia is  considered an act of submission to God, while deviant behavior indicates misguided worship  liii of something that is not God and is thus a violation of tawhid.  There is unanimous  liv agreement about this point in Salafi circles.  However, disagreement exists as to what  constitutes worship. Salafis opposing a particular government would for instance call  advocates of the government, or even everybody not opposing it, “idolaters” who worship  human beings and ideas instead of Allah. Some hold the view that all forms of democracy and  even the seeking of money and other worldly gains is such a form of taghut (idolatry), while  lv other see worldly rewards as a present from Allah.  The commonality of all Salafis lies in the  proclamation that their deeds and ideas are a result of what was prescribed by Allah, i.e. a  negation of human free will.  The call to literally follow the Sunna of the Prophet Muhammad is responsible for the  enormous importance that is assigned to the study of the Hadith. But it is also a call to  emulate the life of the prophet and his companions. All questions of everyday life are subject  16    </page> <page sequence="19">    to scrutiny that aims to supplant one’s own decisions with mimicry of the transmitted  behavior of the prophet. This not only includes detailed instructions for prayer but also eating  habits and codes of behavior within and outside the family. It also typically influences the  outward appearance of Salafis, who wear traditional Islamic dress according to clearly- lvi defined rules.   The third principle that is part of the proposed notion of Salafism is the rejection of human  reason. Islam states that God revealed his final law between 610 and 632 CE. To believing  Muslims, this law shall govern all aspects of human life and it is the task of men to learn and  revelation from the Qur’an and Sunna.lviiunderstand the perfect  Salafism holds that this  understanding is not possible through reason and rational interpretation of the scripture.  Instead, Salafism operates as if the meaning and rules for application of the Qur’an and Sunna  were self-evident. Because human beings can be misled by desire and personal interest, the  application of reason or logic would lead to a foul and biased extrapolation of God’s  lviii commands.  The promotion of this anti-rationality dates back to Ahmad Ibn Hanbal’s  debate in the 8th century with the Mu’tazilah, an Islamic school that argued reason and  revelation could not contradict each other. Hanbal, and later Ibn Taymiyya, argued that the  Qur’an is not open for interpretation.lix  Finally, Salafi ideology is characterized by a rejection of the four orthodox schools of  jurisprudence (taqlid) and the call for a new interpretation of the religious sources to find  Islamically correct rulings for contemporary problems (ijtihad).  These four dimensions – tawhid as submission to Allah in all aspects of life, following the  Sunna as a strict emulation of the life of the Prophet Muhammad and his followers, the  rejection of human reason in matters of religion, and a renewed interpretation of the religious  sources – are henceforward implied when speaking of “Salafism”.  The author’s concept of Salafism excludes one of its common descriptors. Haykel has argued  that Salafis are not, strictly speaking, a political actor because they eschew most civic forms  17    </page> <page sequence="20">    lx of organization.   This would go along with Al-Albani’s argument that the correct manhaj is  lxi to shun political parties and civic associations, as they lead to divisiveness within the umma.   Hasan has described how Indonesian Salafis deplore hizbiyya (party politics) for being  opposed to the right manhaj, deviating from the right path and bringing its leaders close to  bid’a (religious innovation). They argue that members of hizbiyya-groups are loyal along  party lines, rather than to Allah and his umma, and that this misplaced loyalty will lead them  lxii to think narrowly about seizing political power.  The same Salafi opposition to hizbiyya  lxiii holds true for the Saudi Arabian establishment against the Sahwa-movement,  the  Sudanese’ Salafis’ criticism of that country’s ruling Islamist party,lxiv and, formerly, the  doctrine of Egypt’s Al lxv-Jamaa Al-Islamiyya.   But for the many examples one can marshall to support the idea that a certain rejection of  politics is peculiar to Salafism, there are counterexamples, too. Be they the Saudi Sahwa  lxvi Sheikhs, the followers of Muhammad Surur Zayn Al-Abidin,  the Salafis of Al-Qaeda or  Egypt’s post-Mubarak Al-Nour party – all of them are or were intrinsically concerned with  political issues. Whether an Islamist shuns politics can thus not be part of a meaningful  concept of Salafism. Furthermore, the very notion of an apolitical Salafi praxis is  objectionable. As Salomon has remarked about the Sudanese Ansar Al-Sunna group, Salafis  can understand their religious efforts to “purify” Islamic doctrine as fundamentally political  work. Considering the Salafis’ view of Islam as an all-encompassing way of life, relevant to  every human being, Salafism’s praxis is political by virtue of transgressing the secular  concept of religion. Thus, Salomon notes, the category of “Muslim politics” needs to be  lxvii rearticulated beyond the sphere of sovereignty and the implementation of Islamic law.   It would be detrimental for an analysis of Salafism to draw a principal, theoretical boundary  between Salafis who shun politics and those who do adopt political issues. Instead, the second  part of this paper will suggest a concept of Salafism that includes both extremes as necessary,  complementary antipodes of the same ideology.  18    </page> <page sequence="21">    Another concept that is often part of definitions of Salafism has been excluded here, too. Talk  of bid’a, innovation, in Islamic doctrine and praxis is a major part of Salafi discourse. But  rather than being a distinct problem, it is covered by the concept of tawhid. Whoever ”spoils”  the purity of Islamic worship with religious innovations that were not part of God’s revelation  adds or changes something of what was prescribed by him, which is tantamount to an attack  on the sole Lordship of God. The same holds true for accusations often invoked by Salafis  like shirk (polytheism), taghut (idolatry) and kufr (unbelief). All of them are violations  against tawhid, and so are implicit in the concept of Salafism as outlined above.  After discussing the ideological roots and conceptual tenets of Salafism, we can now move on  to establishing the theoretical framework within which we will study the contemporary  manifestation of Salafism as a socio-political phenomenon.    The Salafi Movement  Roy, who subsumes Salafism under the term Neofundamentalism, argues that it is a product  of globalization: “Neofundamentalism valorises the uprootedness of uprooted people. [...] It  works along the same lines as globalisation – individualisation, deculturation, and  deterritorialisation – and promotes a reconstructed identity based on the homogenisation of  of conduct.”lxviiipatterns  Global migration and the subsequent growth of Muslim minorities in  the West, but also a generally much greater degree of mobility, has led to the demise of “local  Islams” in favor of a “global Salafism”.lxix  In other words, Salafi ideology with its cross-cultural and trans-national impetus coincides  with the objective, socio-political conditions of a globalized world. But Salafism does not  only affirm the disappearance of the “pristine ethnic culture”lxx of the first generation of  Muslim migrants to the West. Salafism strives to transform these different Muslim “ethnic  cultures” into a new community that defines itself purely in Islamic terms and as distinct from  the majority of Muslims and mainstream society alike. This new Salafi community is political  19    </page> <page sequence="22">    inasmuch as Salafism conceives the umma to be not only a religious but also a political entity.  As such, Salafism is fundamentally opposed to secularism. Its efforts to “proselytize” other  Muslims and non-Muslims are a promotion of faith – and at the same time political  propaganda. The mere idea of a human-centered, secular polity violates the principle of  tawhid, even though Salafism provides some ideological leeway to at least temporarily  lxxi acquiesce to majority rule in the West.  The desire to spread Islam and to call Muslims to a  pristine creed and praxis results in a specific social action known as dawa (Islamic call).  Dawa-work includes acts as diverse as preaching to one’s colleague at work, uploading  Islamic sermons on YouTube, rallying for the right to wear a niqab (full veil for women), and  constructing mosques and Islamic shops. Salafi activists believe in promoting a global  message that is the solution to all the problems of mankind. Salafi dawa is therefore neither  limited to a particular addressee, nor is its scope restricted to a particular domain of life. It is  supposed to reach out to every human being and to encompass all facets of life. Hence, the  study of Salafism must include what in Western terms is divided into spheres: political,  private, social and cultural.    Salafism as a Social Movement  Salafism in general does not appear as a single organization, nor does it have a central  leadership. It consists of a network of organizations, informal groups and individual activists.  Its activities take place in the real world, but increasingly also in cyberspace through websites,  video-sharing platforms like YouTube, blogs and forums. It showcases a multitude of  personal and organizational links, ranging from loose informal ties to firmer institutional  connections. Salafi ideology is the common point of reference for these networks; a set of  shared beliefs generates basic solidarity among network members. In this, the Salafi network  is like a social movement. According to Della Porta and Diani, there are four aspects to a  social movement: It 1) consists of informal interaction networks that provide information,  20    </page> <page sequence="23">    expertise and material resources; it is signified by 2) collective identities and value systems  that can persist during a temporary lapse of movement activity; 3) the collective action of  movements is focused on conflicts with opposing actors; and 4) it uses different forms of  lxxii protest in regard to these conflicts.  The Salafi milieu fully matches the first two criteria. It  is an informal network that shares the collective identity of being the firqa najiyya (saved  sect) or taifa mansura (victorious group). The latter two criteria are met only with some  limitations. Dawa is the Salafi mode of collective action that ultimately aims to create an  Islamic society, understood as a unity of politics, religion and moral conduct. It is focused on  a conflict with the majority of the society about the general social and political order. So far,  it does match the third criterion. But Salafi action is not limited to this confrontation with the  out-group. In fact, a sizable number of Salafi groups and individuals limit their activities to  their private lives, their families and the community. A large part of Salafi activism consists  of individual worship, regular prayer, religious education and other communal activities that  do not seek confrontation and do not focus their activities on an opposing actor. Individual  conduct according to the Salafi ideology and communal activity provide cohesion to groups  and networks where they do not mobilize for collective action. This of course affects the  fourth criterion. While Salafi groups do use various forms of protest to further their goals,  they do not cease to exist in times when there is no protest. It is impossible to think of the  Anti-War Movement or the Environmental Movement without their mobilization and protest  against war and for environmental issues. In both cases, the movement objective is limited to  lxxiii a certain political goal, which is the defining characteristic of the movement.  Salafism has  no such limitations, so its analysis needs to reflect what Salafism is beyond a social  movement.    Salafism as an Enclave Culture  21    </page> <page sequence="24">    Sivan relies on Douglas’ concept of the “enclave culture” to study what he terms religious  lxxiv fundamentalism.  In line with Douglas, he differentiates three social contexts: The  hierarchy is comparably sure of its outer group boundary and is defined by an upside- downside relationship of its members. The market consists of “individually negotiated social  networks” that are hardly influenced by questions of belonging to a certain group or social,  sexual, ethnic or religious category. The enclave, finally, is defined by its fear of losing  members and the consequent importance of its inside-outside relations. Its members are  attracted to the outside group that appeals with prestige, cultural hegemony and access to  political power.  The enclave has no coercive power over its members that could stop them  from defecting and lacks the resources to compensate for loyalty to the group. All it has to  lxxv offer is a moral reward.  It creates an ideological “wall of virtue” that separates the “free,  equal and saved group” from the temptations of the “central community”, i.e. the mainstream  society. This explains the dichotomous thinking in the enclave’s ideology and the prevalence  of conspiracy theories. The members of the enclave feel besieged from outside and threatened  lxxvi by the enemies within their midst.   Sivan comprehensibly applies the concept of enclave culture to “Islamic fundamentalism”,  which sees modernity and a “human centered world” as its central threat.lxxvii-  These  descriptors of the enclave do reflect many of the features of the Salafi movement and  ideology. Salafism forms a minority that is organized into a tight social network that tries to  shield its members from the worldly temptations of mainstream society. It aggrandizes the  virtuousness of the Salafi community while constantly warning group members not to stray  from the right path. It has little material reward to offer and no coercive power over its (adult)  members beyond the state-sanctioned authority that is exercised over children within the  individual families of the Salafi community.   The concept of the Salafi movement as an enclave culture can answer the question of its  cohesiveness beyond the mobilization for protest over issues that are contentious vis à vis  22    </page> <page sequence="25">    mainstream society. But it fails in a central point. It cannot explain the influx of Salafi  converts nor the fact that Salafi communities are much less a reaction of the first generation of  Muslim immigrants than they are a phenomenon of third-generation immigrant, Western-born  Muslims. The central characteristic of the enclave – the fear of losing members – does not  help us comprehend how the Salafi community developed in the first place. It cannot inform  us why the Salafi community expands, nor can it account for internal movement dynamics  and conflicts.  To answer these questions we have to return to the idea of Salafism as a social movement.     Social Movement Theory as Analytical Framework  The social movement approach to Islamism was made popular by Wiktorowicz’ seminal work  lxxviii on Islamic activism,  and has served as a theoretical framework for a number of important  lxxix studies on Islamism, Salafism and Global Jihad.   While keeping in mind that we also have to account for Salafism where it lacks the  characteristics of a protest movement, Social Movement Theory (SMT) can offer valuable  insights into the internal dynamics of the Salafi movement. SMT has an important advantage  over other approaches. It is interdisciplinary and can be used to scrutinize Salafi activism at  an individual and organizational level, while also considering the greater sociopolitical  framework in which the Salafi movement is unfolding.  SMT does not attempt to explain the root-causes of a movement, as do the sociological and  lxxx psychological inquiries of different strain theories.  A number of scholarly studies have  tried to explain the emergence in a society of social movements with structural strains, or the  lxxxi anomie created by the deep social changes concomitant to modernity.  The social  movement approach answers these theories that “grievances are ubiquitous but movements  are not,”lxxxii and rather asks: Why does a specific social movement form successfully at a  particular time in a particular place?  23    </page> <page sequence="26">    To answer this question, SMT distinguishes four main analytical dimensions of social  movements: 1. political opportunity, 2. resource availability, 3. mobilizing structures and 4.  framing. These shall briefly be explained below.      Political Opportunity  According to Cragun, the concept of “political opportunity refers to the receptivity or  vulnerability of the existing political system to challenge.”lxxxiii lxxxiv Meyer notes  that Eisinger  was the first to introduce the idea that the political structure of a society or community, and  specifically its degree of openness to political contenders, is relevant to the likelihood of  lxxxv social protest.  His idea of open versus closed societies was taken up by Tilly, who added  that protest tactics are dependent on the “repertoire of contention,” which is determined by the  political openness and the opportunities for action that the political framework grants to  lxxxvi contenders.  Political openness and opportunity are further shaped by the tolerance of the  lxxxvii lxxxviii elite of a society  and potential conflicts within this elite,  the degree of stability of  lxxxix xc political alignments,  and the availability of allies for the social movement.     Resource Availability  Resource Mobilization Theory (RMT) has contributed to SMT the idea of the importance of  xci resources to the development and success of a social movement.  RMT argues that the  capacity for movement mobilization depends on material resources like work, money,  infrastructure, media access, member-expertise and non-material or “symbolic” resources like  xcii xciii authority, faith, friendship,  the moral engagement of movement members  and  xciv solidarity.  Fireman and William identified five factors that link individuals to a group and  thus create the basis for in-group solidarity: a) friendship and kinship with group members, b)  participation with group members in an organization, c) a common design for living of the  24    </page> <page sequence="27">    individual and other group members, d) a shared set of subordinate and superordinate  xcv relations with the out-group, and e) the difficulty of exiting the group.  These considerations  of in-group solidarity overlap with the third analytical dimension of SMT.    Mobilizing Structures  Many scholars of social movements have highlighted the great importance of social networks  xcvi to recruitment to a social movement.  Della Porta and Diani note that the importance of  social networks is also a function of the strength of the counter-culture behind the social  movement. If the counter-culture is strong, individual mobilization is more likely to be  xcvii facilitated through friendship.  It has also been established that younger age groups are  most prone to be mobilized for action, as they are still in the process of identity formation and  xcviii are more able to sustain the costs and risks that protest and collective action involve.   Jasper and Poulsen have suggested that “moral shocks” can take the place of social network  mobilization – an idea that seems also highly relevant to explanations of “lone wolf” terror  xcix attacks.  Sageman, who focused on the contemporary Global Jihad movement, has noted  that the internet enables bonding in a virtual space, and thus helps to facilitate group  c cohesiveness.   Also, internal movement dynamics play a role in the recruitment, mobilization  and overall success of a movement. Zald and McCarthy found that the denser the  relationships among leaders of a social movement organization (SMO), the greater the  ci chances for cooperation among SMOs.  It is important to understand that a social movement  does not consist of a homogenous group of actors with an absolute sense of solidarity. To  understand the internal dynamics of a social movement, it is equally important to scrutinize  inner-movement competition for mobilization potential and inner-movement cooperation on  common objectives. Della Porta and Diani have drawn on a number of studies about leftist  and environmental groups in Italy in the 1970s and 1980s to distinguish four patterns of inter- organizational relations within a social movement, according to the prevalence of cooperation  25    </page> <page sequence="28">    and competition: a) non-competitive cooperation; b) neutrality as an absence of cooperation  and competition alike; c) competitive cooperation; and d) factionalism as an absence of  cii cooperation in a state of competition.   In her study on the evolution of social-movement organizations, Stern utilized ecological  theory’s concept of niche-competition to explain the behavior of SMOs under the pressure of  competition. She presupposed that SMOs compete for membership, and argued that if  membership in a given SMO excludes membership in another SMO, then SMOs in the same  ciii organizational niche  are in direct competition with each other; this can pressure the weaker  civ SMO to move its mobilization efforts to a less competitive environment.  Rethinking her  study in regard to the Salafi movement, we can conceive of “membership” as the specific  manhaj of a Salafi individual which, as was explained above, is the main point of contention  in the Salafi movement and the expression of its factionalism. By reformulating the concept  of niche as the attitude of movement members, niche theory can help explain how Salafi  groups and factions are under pressure to adjust their manhaj so that they may recruit new  members whose attitudes might otherwise not resonate with their prevalent manhaj. But the  attitude of an individual can be changed much more easily than can his social status or age,  which are the variables Stern employed in her study. This mutability of attitude offers the  Salafi group another way to recruit and maintain membership: It can change the attitude of its  members in accordance with its ideology. This leads to the fourth analytical dimension of  SMT.    Framing  The term “framing” goes back to Goffman’s “Essay on the Organization of Experience”,cv in  which he denotes frames as “schemata of interpretation that enable individuals to locate,  perceive, identify, and label occurrences within their life space and the world at large,”cvi the  underlying theory being that our perception of factual reality is shaped by a preconceived idea  26    </page> <page sequence="29">    of this reality, and that facts can be presented or “framed” in a way that corresponds to the  ideas and identities of potential movement members. The “fit” between “frames and  audiences’ previous beliefs, worldviews, and life experiences”cvii was termed “resonance” by  cviii Snow and Benford.  Frame resonance is what “will transform mobilization potential into  actual mobilization.”cix Snow et al. have explored how movements can create frame  resonance, and thus mobilization of movement members, by what is called “frame  alignment”.cx They suggest four main forms of frame alignment: a) “Frame bridging” is “the  linkage of two or more ideologically congruent but structurally unconnected frames regarding  a particular problem,” and facilitates the linkage of an SMO to “unmobilized sentiment pools  or public opinion preference clusters”.cxi b) “Frame amplification” is the “clarification and  invigoration of an interpretive frame that bears on a particular issue, problem or set of  events”.cxii c) “Frame extension” is the adoption of an issue new to the movement’s repertoire  in order to broaden the movement’s constituency.cxiii d) “Frame transformation” of movement  members is necessary for the long-term cohesion of a movement, if this movement’s ideology  is incompatible with conventional life-styles; it calls for a “systematic alteration”cxiv of the  cxv Weltanschauung of movement participants.  The idea of a transformation of “global  interpretive frames”cxvi of movement members is highly relevant for the Salafi movement  study. Salafism not only provides a “master frame”cxviiunder  that filters occurrences in the  surrounding world and translates them into religious terms, it also provides a strict code of  moral conduct that permeates the individual life of its adherents. The process by which an  individual changes previously-held beliefs and morals towards a Salafi or other Islamist  worldview is commonly termed “radicalization”. In light of SMT, radicalization can also be  viewed as a form of “frame transformation”, which adds an organizational perspective to an  individual process: radicalization as a process of membership consolidation of the Salafi  movement.    27    </page> <page sequence="30">    Framing Dilemma  The need to create frame resonance leads to a problem. On one hand, individuals who do not  yet participate in the movement and whose individual frames are different from those of the  movement can be mobilized, if the movement frames its messages according to the audience  it wants to mobilize. At the same time, the movement wants to preserve its goals and  ideology; it therefore transforms the master frame of new recruits, rather than adapt itself to  the majority. Thus, the movement’s dilemma is between adapting its frame to the audience,  versus adapting the audience to the movement’s frame. We will call this the framing  dilemma. Tarrow has identified a paradox in the “symbolic politics of social movements” that  mirrors this dilemma: “to mediate between inherited symbols that are familiar, but lead to  iliar to lead to action.”cxviiipassivity, and new ones that are electrifying, but may be too unfam   In the course of this paper, it will be shown how the Salafi movement successfully deals with  this dilemma, attracting new members and support from non-Salafi actors while preserving its  core ideology.    Research Design  The study of Salafism as a social movement is a comparably new field.  Interest in the West  in Salafism as a social movement is even more recent. Of course, this is because the  phenomenon itself is relatively new. In order to explore a phenomenon that has just begun to  attract scholarly attention, this study used a qualitative approach. The lack of previous  literature called for an in-depth study of Salafism, in the hope that new insights would help  create a framework for future analyses. Apart from this consideration, the Salafi phenomenon  as a whole combines the differing features of a religious community, a social movement and  an enclave culture, which span an individual, organizational and societal dimension. This  cxix makes for a complexity that quantitative research would find difficult to tackle.   28    </page> <page sequence="31">    Another advantage of the qualitative approach is that it allows for detailed descriptions of the  phenomenon, which can, as Boor explains, “enable practitioner audiences imaginatively to  s”cxxjuxtapose their own everyday practice  or, in our case, their own everyday experience with  the Salafi movement. It can help them to “reflect upon, previously taken-for-granted,  action”cxxiknowledge-in-  and offer a new perspective on the data that analysts of Salafism are  dealing with on a regular basis.    Research Strategy and Rationale  During the course of the research, the following research strategy will provide a structure and  limit essayistic digressions to the minimum that is inevitable in qualitative research as it  cxxii pursues new and perhaps unforeseen insights.   Firstly, the object of our research has to be clarified: What is the Salafi movement behavior  that we aim to analyze? We have already stated that the Salafi movement shows strong  features of a social movement as defined by Della Porta and Diani as “(1) informal networks,  based (2) on shared beliefs and solidarity, which mobilize (3) conflictual issues, through (4)  the frequent use of various forms of protest”.cxxiii We have added that this notion has to be  broadened to account for the quasi-private dimension of Salafi activism and the partial  absence of mobilization for conflictual issues and protest.  We will therefore include benign and cooperative behavior towards the out-group as well as  the absence of collective action as part of the behavioral repertoire of the Salafi movement.  This results in a broad notion of movement behavior, which ranges from a lack of visible  collective action and a restriction of movement activity to the private sphere and the  immediate community through non-violent protest and organized opposition, to terrorist  recruitment – all of which are justified by Salafi arguments. It includes Salafi alliances for  public rallies and declarations of takfir (denouncing somebody as an infidel), participation in  inter-faith events, and hate speech against other denominations. Only by considering the  29    </page> <page sequence="32">    whole spectrum of Salafi action – from non-violent to Jihadi terrorist and from cooperative to  seclusive – can we draw conclusions about the behavior of the movement as a whole.  Consequently, the first part of this paper will systematically review the ideological sources of  Salafism and conceptualize them so as to explain the whole spectrum of Salafi activism. The  second part of this paper will then discuss a case sample of German Salafi groups chosen to  represent a maximum measure of diversity, so as to cover the full spectrum of the German  Salafi movement.  The data in this sample will then be evaluated utilizing the analytical dimensions of social  movement theory – political opportunity, resource availability, mobilizing structure, and  framing – in order to understand 1. What were the specific conditions under which the  specific behavior occurred? and 2. How was the behavior framed and justified in Salafi  language?    Population  As we have noted, a social movement consists of a dense, informal network of organizations  and individuals. The research strategy demands a large data pool on the whole spectrum of the  Salafi movement in Germany. Hence the population of this study consist of German Salafi  organizations and individuals, including those that play a seemingly marginal role in the  movement as a whole.     Data Collection Methods  Twelve unstructured, exploratory interviews were conducted. The interviewees included  German professionals and non-professionals familiar with Islamism, in general, and the Salafi  movement in Germany, in particular, including specific parts of it such as a regional network,  an important individual or a particular mosque community. Amongst the interviewees were  government- and security officials, scholars, NGO-professionals working in the area of  30    </page> <page sequence="33">    Salafism, and representatives of different religious communities who have direct experience  cxxiv with Salafi actors.  In addition, semi-structured interviews were conducted with seven  prominent Salafi preachers and representatives of Muslim organizations open to Salafi  cxxv thought, and were analyzed where they were relevant for this study.     Finally, a wealth of open source material was collected from internet publications, as was  print media from Salafi mosques and info-stands. By making inquiries to the human sources  cited and using this open source material, we built a database containing case studies of 176  individuals and 62 organizations, all of which are connected to Islamism, and the vast  majority of which are connected to Salafism in Germany, specifically. The author evaluated  these cases and their context, and the opinions retrieved from the expert interviews, so as to  select a number of cases for discussion (the selection criteria are elucidated below).    Problems in Data Collection  Collecting in-depth data on a social movement that includes clandestinely-operating, militant  actors is highly difficult; it is usually the task of security agencies that are far better equipped  for intelligence-gathering than is the academic researcher. However, data on extreme actors  within the Salafi movement cannot simply be omitted without relinquishing this study’s goal  of explaining Salafi behavior as a whole. The restriction of access to information can  potentially lead to a bias regarding the data gathered.  Different actors within the Salafi movement take fundamentally different approaches to  information distribution, depending on their current strategy and tactics. While most Salafi  groups upload copies of nearly every speech, gathering, and rally to the internet, those groups  that are closer to militant, and therefore illegal, action operate, understandably, much less  publicly, such that less information about them is freely available. This problem was also  reflected in the interviews with German Salafi preachers used for this study. Even though, as  we shall see, they represent a broad spectrum of Salafi groups and ideas in Germany, they do  31    </page> <page sequence="34">    not include representatives of the openly militant view, who encourage martyrdom for the  sake of armed Jihad. The author has tried to compensate for this “blind spot” in the interviews  with the preachers by interviewing experts and consulting German Jihadi websites, social  media platforms, and relevant German online forums.    Case Selection  Seawright and Gerring define a case study as “The intensive analysis of a single unit or small  number of units, where the researcher’s goal is to understand a larger class of similar  units.”cxxvi The problem here lies in the inferability to the population, in our case: What cases  of Salafi behavior allow us to generalize about Salafi behavior per se? Seawright and Gerring  have remarked that in small N samples, which are used for qualitative research, sample cases  chosen through randomization are often not representative of the population under study.  cxxvii Purposive case selection is therefore the better alternative.   As this study aims to explain the whole range of Salafi behavior, the cases chosen had to  reflect the greatest diversity of behavior, rather than the most “typical” or “influential”  behavior. Newcomers to the movement might also have presented cases of different behavior,  which we would have had to take into consideration if we were aiming to represent the whole  range of behavior. However, the question is whether the cases of newcomers are part of the  whole range of Salafi behavior. While they might have added to the aimed-for diversity of the  sample, they would most likely not have exemplified typical Salafi behavior because they  were new to the movement and had had less exposure to its ideology, and less time to  internalize its norms, frames and jargon. Hence, we can assume that the behavior of  newcomers is shaped less by Salafi ideology than by the behavior of prominent movement  actors such as preachers, board members of Salafi organizations, moderators of online  forums, hosts of Salafi websites, or militant activists.  32    </page> <page sequence="35">    Therefore two criteria determined case selection: The sample needs to be limited to 1. typical  Salafi behavior of which the sample 2. needs to represent the greatest possible diversity. Thus,  cases were selected for the most diverse behavior of the most typical actors in the  cxxviii movement.     Strategies to Ensure Quality and Rigor of Research  Qualitative research has often been attacked as lacking academic rigor and what in  quantitative research is known as “validity” and “reliability”.cxxix Anfara et al. have met these  accusations by offering a guideline to ensure the lamented lack of rigor and quality. They  translated a number of concepts that are commonly used in quantitative research for  application in qualitative studies: “Internal validity” is conceptualized as the credibility of the  research; “external validity” is measured as the transferability of the research results; and  “reliability” is conceived of as dependability, which is achieved by making “all aspects of the  analysis process open to the public” and by creating an “audit trail.”cxxx  This study aimed to comply with the proposed standards in the following way:    Credibility: The author of this study conducted field research over a period of about one year,  during which he monitored websites and online forums as well as physically interacting with  Salafi activists and organizations. During the research, developments within the Salafi milieu  in Germany were discussed with local experts, relevant information was exchanged, and peer  debriefings were conducted. He also visited Salafi mosques and schools in Germany, Syria  and Egypt.

This process forms a triad of reality-ideology-action. To understand Salafi action, it  would be a valid approach to simply study the reality that Salafis react to. It has been  explained that it would be appropriate to study this reality with a social movement approach,  i.e. to conduct an analysis using the categories of political opportunity structure, resource  availability, mobilizing structures and frames. But if we claim that the reaction of the Salafi  movement to reality is not simply an exemplar of social movement activism in general, but  also has its own characteristic features, then we will first have to identify these features – that  is, to study Salafi ideology and understand how it shapes the movement’s translation of reality  into action. This can be seen as an attempt to understand the framing-process in Salafi  ideology or, to use another term, the Salafi solution to the framing dilemma of social  cxxxi movements.

It will be argued that virtually all of these    35    </page> <page sequence="38">    justifications are linked to a concept of tawhid or a concept of umma, both of which constitute  the first two cornerstones of a framework of Salafi behavior. The second part of this chapter  will discuss how the means for a particular behavior are chosen and justified: How do Salafis  vindicate violence, and how do they argue against it? In what way do they sanctify a  cooperative, tolerant relationship with mainstream society, and what reasons do they give for  seclusion, confrontation and hostility? Noting the Islamic sources used to justify each of these  behaviors, and drawing on the precedents of early Islamic history that serve as models for  contemporary Salafis, two modes of Salafi behavior will be suggested: a Meccan-type and a  Medinan-type.  The third part of this chapter will then explain how the distinctions of the content of Salafi  ideology according to the concept of tawhid or umma, and the modality of Salafi behavior as  Meccan or Medinan, constitute a matrix along which Salafi disputes take place and behavioral  decisions are formulated.  This matrix will serve as the framework for chapter II, which will explore the link between  socio-political conditions and Salafi action in Germany.      Salafi Master Frames – Tawhid and Umma  The discourse of the contemporary Salafi movement revolves around two central themes: The  first holds that the Muslim community has deviated from the true tawhid of its pious  cxxxii forefathers and must be called back to the pure creed and praxis as revealed by Allah.  The  second theme, much less peculiar to Salafism, is concerned with the Muslim umma as a  whole. It extends from fear of inner-Muslim strife over perceived threats of “anti-Muslim  racism” and a Western, cultural subversion of Islam, to the idea of a ”Zionist-Crusader  alliance” th cxxxiiiat wants to physically destroy Muslim countries and their citizens.  While  36    </page> <page sequence="39">    Salafi ideologues deal with a variety of topics, all of their arguments are, as shall be shown,  essentially derivative of either theme.  37    </page> <page sequence="40">    Tawhid  The idea of tawhid is the one great abstraction of Salafi thought. Every idea that touches upon  Islam as a religion derives from it. It is an ideal – free of the deficiencies of actual Muslims.  The umma might sin or go astray but tawhid is the fixed star on the Salafi horizon that the  cxxxiv believer must strive towards or else there is hell.  As such, the idea of tawhid is distinct  from real Islamic life. It claims the absolute, total dominion of God to which humans are mere  objects and simultaneously demands from men, as if they were free to choose, obedience.  Tawhid, as understood by Salafis, essentially calls to consciously subjugate every expression  of one’s life to what it is allegedly already subject to: Allah. Prayer, work, sex and the walk to  cxxxv the toilet  – everything becomes an act of worship if performed in the light of and in  accordance with tawhid. It is fundamentally opposed to the idea that an individual could have  any value of his own. Human expression in itself is void, if not blasphemous. Only as an act  of conformity with tawhid is it good and worthy. When Salafis express their affection for  somebody they typically add to ”I love you” the adjunct ”for Allah.” Similarly, hate shall not  be for personal reasons either but only as an act of tawhid. In an anecdote often cited in Salafi  circles, Imam Ali did spare an enemy’s life in battle after the combatant had spit in Ali’s face.  Already closing in for the final strike Ali paused because he was afraid that killing the enemy  cxxxvi upon the insult would mean to kill him for personal reasons and not in the name of Allah.   The essence of tawhid is the total submission of every aspect of human life to God. But what  God wills Salafis believe to know best. Here is the catch. Surrender and absolute obedience  are imperative to Salafism. But what exactly that means often remains a heated debate.  The  ever-present call for submission is essentially negative because the only categorical  imperative that Salafism has to offer is conformity with tawhid, i.e. submission itself. In the  name of God it is directed against the idea that individuals could be more than mere means to  some divine end. The apotheosis of human impotence lies at the heart of Salafism.  38    </page> <page sequence="41">    Even though there is scholarly consensus on the centrality of tawhid to the Salafi movement  and its ideology, it is usually only named as one of several core concepts of Salafism along  cxxxvii bid’a cxxxviiiwith shirk (lit. association)  and (religious innovation).   Sometimes shirk is  sub-divided into ash-shirk al-asghar (the minor shirk) and ash-shirk al-akbar (the greater  shirk), and other concepts like kufr (unbelief) and taghut (idolatry) are added. The plurality of  Salafi terms and concepts can easily hide the fact that virtually all of them are only derivatives  of tawhid. It shall therefore be shown first how all these different terms lead back to the same  concept.    Concepts of Tawhid  Salafi elaborations of tawhid are essentially identical. There is a wide consensus regarding the  cxxxix importance as well as the meaning  of tawhid and, therefore, it will suffice to follow the  explanations of one widely read Salafi preacher in order to extrapolate the implications of  tawhid for, and its logical connection to, the majority of Salafi concepts. “The Fundamentals  of Tawhid”, the main work of the Jamaican-born Salafi preacher Bilal Phillips, provides such  an explanation. Published in Saudi Arabia and by and large following the explications of  Abdul Wahhab’s ”Kitab at Tawhid”cxl- , it has arguably become one of the most-cited  cxli contemporary writings amongst Salafis in the West.   In his book, Phillips divides the concept of tawhid in three categories: tawhid ar-rububiyya  (the unicity of creation and lordship of Allah); tawhid al-asma wa as-sifat (the unicity of  Allah’s 99 names and attributes as found in the Qur’an); and tawhid al-‘ibada (the unicity of  cxlii worship).     Tawhid ar-Rububiyya – The Unicity of Lordship  Tawhid ar-rububiyya refers to the belief that God was the sole creator of the universe and is  still the sole existing power. Everything happens only by virtue of Allah and no other entity.  39    </page> <page sequence="42">    “Allah alone caused all things to exist when there was nothing; He sustains and maintains  creation without any need from it or for it; and He is the sole Lord of the universe and its  inhabitants without any real challenge to His sovereignty.”cxliii Inherent to this idea is the  belief that God is all-knowing of the past, present and future and, thus, everything is  preordained by Allah – good things as well as bad things – and was written down in al-lauh  cxliv al-mahfooz (the preserved tablet) fifty thousand years before creation.  The concept of an  all-encompassing omnipotence of God produces a theoretical problem. If everything depends  on God, then nothing depends on men, and the divisions between good and bad, right and  wrong are void. Properly speaking, the idea of tawhid ar-rububiyya eliminates morality,  which again stands in stark contrast to the moral activism of Salafism with its perpetual calls  to follow the Salafi path as the only way to salvation. The solution to the problem is old, and  only affirms the mainstream opinion of Islamic theology on this issue: Even though God is  the cause for everything to exist and happen, man is still free in his decisions, and the  resulting contradiction must not be inquired into. Tabooing rational inquiry where it would  hurt Islamic doctrine is the mantra not only of modern-day Salafis. It dates back to the times  cxlv of the prophet.   Islamic theology later approached the problem of predestination and free will by sub-dividing  God’s will into two kinds. The first, al-irada al-kawniyyah (universal will), is pertinent to  Allah’s creation and includes everything regardless of whether it is good or bad. The second  kind is al-irada ash-shariyyah (judicial will), also called al-irada ad-deeniyya (religious will)  or mashi’a (will), and describes what Allah “loves” –  i.e. the right behavior for the obedient  Muslim. This second type of divine will establishes the realm of free choice for men to obey  or disobey God’s commandments.cxlvi Both dicta are equally valid, even though each logically  excludes the other. This division leaves the actual question unanswered. How can men be free  to make choices, if their choices have already been made and written down by God? The strict  affirmation of both – predestination and human freedom – disempowers rationality. The  40    </page> <page sequence="43">    believer must not ponder the problem, but rather must accept both sides of the aporia as  equally valid. He must accept that he is a mere object of God and simultaneously a subject  that shall behave to please God.  No sense can be made of this. The synthesis of the aporia is  cxlvii forced by the plain submission of the believer.     Tawhid Al-Asma wa as-Sifat – The Unicity of the Names and Attributes  The second concept of tawhid essentially describes the prohibition of likening God to His  creation or His creation to God. This includes a prohibition on trying to understand God’s  attributes and names in human terms. Allah has to be referred to as He has called himself in  the Qur’an and as Muhammad referred to him, and these names and attributes must not be  cxlviii interpreted metaphorically.   Phillips terms it: “...without explaining away His names and attributes by giving them  meanings other than their obvious meanings.”cxlix Yet, since Allah is different from any part  of His creation, the ”obvious meaning” of his names and attributes cannot refer to what they  commonly describe, and is therefore not obvious at all. As if to wipe out any doubt, Phillips  reiterates: “When attributes are used in reference to God, they are to be taken in the absolute  sense, free from human deficiencies.”cl But ”absolute sense” is a contradictio in adjecto. A  word necessarily relates to something, otherwise it would not have any meaning at all and  thus not be a word. Adorno made this point with unsurpassable clarity: ”Something – as a  cogitatively indispensable substrate of any concept...is the utmost abstraction of the subject- matter that is not identical with thinking, an abstraction not to be abolished by any further  thought process.”cli Phillips’ and, for that matter, the Salafis’ rejection of reading Qur’an and  Sunna metaphorically inevitably leads to an anthropomorphic understanding of God, which is  th hidden behind the taboo against further inquiry. This taboo dates back to the 8  century when  the problem of understanding God’s attributes became for the first time an ideological  41    </page> <page sequence="44">    battlefield on which the factions of the Caliphate competed. It is characteristic of Salafi  thought throughout, and deserves a closer look.     Excursus: The Mihna and the Concept of Bi-la Kayfa  Subsequent to the overthrow of the Umayyad Caliphate, the Abbasid dynasty rose to power  and moved its capital from Damascus to Baghdad. The Persian aristocracy that relied on the  gnostic heritage of Zoroastrianism, Manichaeism and Mazdaism confronted it.  The Abbasids,  keen to formulate their own Islamic doctrine that would support their rule, reacted and  commissioned the first translations of Greek philosophy and embraced the Islamic rationalist  school of Mu’tazilism. Under the seventh Abbasid Caliph, Ma’mun, Mu’tazilism became  clii state doctrine.  Only a few months before Ma’mun’s death in 833, a religious purge was  launched, the Mihna, which was to last until 850.  It is commonly held that the trials of the Mihna were primarily concerned with the question of  the createdness of the Qur’an.cliiicliv Contrary to this, the Mu’tazilite essayist and polemicist,  Al-Jahiz, who closely followed the Mihna trials, noted that the main problem was the  anthropomorphist view of God among the traditionalists and a large part of the Muslim  clv umma.  The dispute about corporeal features of God is rooted in the Qur’an and the Sunna  clvi themselves, which are replete with theophany and anthropomorphic references,  while  clvii simultaneously claiming that there is nothing like God.  But if there is no likeness between  God and His creation, then the Qur’anic terms that are predicated of God and also,  simultaneously, of other creatures, must be interpreted. In other words, if God is unlike  anybody else but has a face, hands and feet, then “face,” “hands” and “feet” cannot denote the  same as they commonly do when used to describe human beings. This problem was open to  only two solutions. The Mu’tazilah chose what Wolfson has called an “anti attributist”clviii-   approach, which argued that the anthropomorphic references in the Qur’an had to be  understood metaphorically, since reason and revelation could not contradict each other. The  42    </page> <page sequence="45">    traditionalists, on the other hand, held that the Qur’an was not open to interpretation, but  rather had to be understood in a literal sense. Yet this attributist stance had to answer the  question of how Qur’anic terms predicated of God could be interpreted literally without  clix violating the teaching that there is none like Him?  Most traditionalist scholars adopted a  clx specific attributist approach, which is often, if mistakenly, ascribed to Ibn Hanbal.  They  confirmed the literal meaning of the Qur’an and Sunna, but argued that God’s attributes were  beyond the capacity of human thinking and had to be accepted bi-la kayfa (lit. without how),  clxi i.e. without inquiring about their modality.  This is identical to the denial of the  contradiction between predestination and free choice. Whenever rational thought reveals the  clxii implausibility of Salafi Islam, it is placed under a taboo.   The formula of bi-la kayfa does not solve the contradiction, it simply denies it exists, because  the mere articulation of the question already sanctifies the reflective thinking that would  highlight the logical contradictions in the literal reading and open the door to rational  clxiii inquiry.  The problem thus remains of how to comprehend a God with human features who  sits on a throne, without likening Him to men. If the “mode” of the description is  inconceivable, then the whole description does not mean anything.  Pictorial expressions that are only known from the sphere of daily human life will necessarily  stir up images from this same sphere. Bi-la kayfa does not counter this association, but rather  counters its articulation: Every Muslim reading about a God with a face, hands, feet and so  forth sitting on a throne will picture something human-like, yet nobody must talk about it, for  fear of being called an “innovator” or worse. Bi-la kayfa conserves the anthropomorphic  images of God that the reading of the scriptures and their oral account necessarily evoke, but  establishes a taboo against their articulation. This taboo against articulating what everybody  necessarily experiences, shields Salafism from rational inquiry, and thus from an awareness of  its many inconsistencies.    43    </page> <page sequence="46">    Tawhid Al-‘Ibada – The Unicity of Worship  Of all three concepts of tawhid, the third one, tawhid al-‘ibada, is the most important to the  political character of Salafism. The ”unicity of worship” demands from men not only that  they believe in the sole lordship of God and his absolute uniqueness, but also that they act  accordingly. Phillips explains: “In spite of the Meccans’ confession of Tawhid and their  knowledge of Allah, Allah classified them as disbelievers (kuffar) and pagans (mushrikun)  simply because they worshipped other gods along with their worship of Allah.” The crux of  the matter is the understanding of “other gods” and “worship”. If, as is often the case, Salafis  consider other ideas to be “another god,” and behavior that is not explicitly sanctified in the  Qur’an to be “worship,” then the religious concept of tawhid al-‘ibada seamlessly becomes a  political weapon. As one major Salafi preacher in Germany, Ibrahim Abou Nagie, explained:  “If you worship a president you have not understood ‘Allahu akbar,’ God is greater. If you  worship your wife you have not understood ‘Allahu akbar’. If you worship money you have  not understood ‘Allahu akbar’. Now somebody asks himself: How, worship money? Though  money is worshipped. A minister is worshipped. A president is worshipped, too.”clxiv With  similar arguments, Jihadi scholars have declared takfir over Muslim governments. Sheikh  Abu Muhammad al-Maqdisi, one of the most influential Jihadi clerics today and the  ideological father of the former commander of AQ in Iraq, Abu Musab az-Zarqawi (1966- 2006), outlined the Salafi answer to the question of when Muslim rulers are apostates even  though they uphold the tenets of Islam. There are three cases of this: a sin supported by  conviction of its rightness (i’tiqad); giving others permission to sin (istihlal); and the negation  clxv of the truth of Islam (jahd).  But Maqdisi goes a step further, and infers from the habit of  applying un-Islamic laws or enacting a constitution other than the sharia that the ruler must  be an infidel even without proof of i’tiqad, istihlal or jahd. The majority of Salafi scholars,  clxvi however, do not share this opinion.  In fact, this question is always a highly controversial  44    </page> <page sequence="47">    issue, as it is crucial for the relationship to the state and society that the Salafi movement  contests.  As Phillips writes, the implementation of the sharia is a ”significant part of Tawhid al- ‘Ibada...especially in lands where Muslims form the majority of the population.”clxvii He  continues that these countries are often dominated by unbelief and un-Islamic rule. “Those in  a position to change it must do so, while those unable to do so must speak out against the rule  of kufr and call for the implementation of Shar’iah. If even this becomes impossible, un- Islamic government must be sincerely hated and despised for the pleasure of God and the  upholding of Tawhid.”clxviii The vagueness of Phillips’ explanation retains the whole spectrum  of Salafi positions on the issue. Common to all of them is the call to action in the name of  tawhid. As deviant behavior already indicates the submission to something other than God,  clxix Salafism urges the believer to a certain action.  This action is ill-defined and subject to  debate, especially when it comes to politics. Phillips’ formulation regarding the obligation to  implement sharia as part of tawhid al-‘ibada is important. He calls it a “significant part”. It  remains unclear how significant a part it is, i.e. when Muslims should acquiesce to infidel rule  and when they should take offensive action against it. Phillips at least gives a hint that sharia  rule is of “special significance...in lands where Muslims form the majority of the population.”  But this specification, in a strict sense, violates the notion of tawhid. If the execution of sharia  is part of tawhid and tawhid is supposedly the highest goal for all people everywhere, then it  should be equally important to assert tawhid in Muslim and non-Muslim countries alike – just  as Allah’s will, the irada ash-shariyyah, concerns all mankind and not only the Muslim  community. Phillips’ tripartite classification of behavior concerning the implementation of  sharia helps solve the puzzle: Those who can introduce sharia “must do so,” those unable to  do so “must speak out against the rule of kufr” or at least “hate and despise” the un-Islamic  government. Here Phillips introduces a new concern. The believer not only has to consider  what is necessary in light of tawhid but also what is possible in light of his own, limited  45    </page> <page sequence="48">    power. This power of course largely depends on the society the believer lives in, the political  opportunity it provides and the resources of the believer. All of these, however, are practical  considerations, and as such cannot belong to the concept of tawhid revealed by Allah in the  Qur’an, which is not subject to change or practicability. As a matter of fact, if life was merely  the trial Salafis want it to be, and if submission to tawhid was the sole content of life, then  Salafis should necessarily do everything possible to establish sharia rule, irrespective of their  chances of succees, or the gravity of the consequences if they fail. Concern for what is  possible cannot be related to the worshipped God, but only to the worshippers themselves,  viz. the umma. Attempts to implement sharia where Muslims do not have the power to do so  provokes a reaction from those who do have power and refuse to conform to tawhid as Salafis  understand it: mainstream society and its state institutions. The violent response of police and  military to Salafi militants who want to bring about the desired change by force hurts not  God, but the community of believers – be they the respective terrorist group and its  sympathizers or the Muslim umma at large, and be it through imprisonment and killing or  through the restriction of the funds available to the Salafi movement, or measures against its  propaganda. Phillips’ concern as to what is possible with regard to tawhid al-‘ibada is a  concern as to what could happen to the Salafis and the wider Muslim community. It thus  belongs to what we have previously introduced as the umma-theme, which is discussed in  detail below.  As for the concept of tawhid al-‘ibada, it is essentially a call to implement tawhid in the  private and public spheres of life, which is countered by considerations of what is practically  possible without hurting the Salafi movement and the umma.    Violations of Tawhid  A number of concepts are appendant to the Salafi concept of Allah’s unicity, inasmuch as  they denote forms of violation of tawhid. They can be categorized according the trichotomy  46    </page> <page sequence="49">    of tawhid. Phillips describes the first form as “shirk in rububiyya,” which includes the belief  that others share in Allah’s lordship over His creation, and the belief in the idea that there was  no Lord of creation at all. The first idea refers to religions other than Islam, and the second to  clxx atheism and philosophy.  Phillips calls these forms “shirk by association” and “shirk by  negation,” respectively.clxxi  The second form of violating tawhid is “shirk in al-asma wa as-sifat,” which may also be  divided in two. “Shirk by humanization” refers to the attribution of forms and qualities of  clxxii human beings or animals to God, thus likening him to His creation.  The counterpart to  humanizing God is “shirk by deification”, i.e. the imputation of God’s names and attributes to  something other than Allah. Interestingly, apart from the beliefs of a number of other  denominations such as the Shia and the Druze, Phillips also finds Einstein’s theory of  relativity worth mentioning; he classifies it as shirk by deification, because it states “that  either be created nor destroyed.”clxxiiienergy can n   The third and last form of shirk is “shirk in al-‘ibada”. It, too, is divided in two categories,  which differentiate not only the content of shirk but also its gravity. The first, ash-shirk al- akbar or “major shirk,” denotes the worship of anything along with or instead of Allah; it is  clxxiv also known as taghut.  The importance of the definition of “worship” also appears in  Phillips’ explications. He remarks: “Love is a form of worship which, in its perfection, should  irected to Allah.”clxxv This “perfect love” is total obedience to God.clxxvionly be d    Consequently, affection in general is considered ash-shirk al-akbar in al-‘ibada. ”If man  allows the love of anything or anyone to come between himself and Allah, then he has  worshipped that thing. In this way, money can become one’s god or even one’s desire could  become a god.”clxxvii But because ash-shirk al-akbar is considered “the greatest act of  rebellion against the Lord of the Universe...and guarantees its perpetrator eternal damnation  ll,”clxxviiiin He  the believer needs to be permanently vigilant, wary of all of his feelings and  ready to purge them of anything that might contradict submission to God. Ultimately, this  47    </page> <page sequence="50">    leads to a mindset where nothing can be endearing or lovable by itself, but only “for  Allah.”clxxix  Apart from the major shirk in al-‘ibada there is the “minor shirk” or ash-shirk al-asghar.  Phillips refers to a Hadith to explain that this minor idolatry is the performance of an act of  worship not in order to please God but rather for personal benefit, such as “showing off” in  front of fellow believers in order to be respected and praised for one’s piousness, which is  also called ar-riya. To avoid this pitfall, Phillips goes on to explain, the believer has to  constantly “purify his intentions”, e.g. by using informal prayers “before and after all natural  habits like eating, drinking, sleeping, sex, and even going to the toilet”. clxxx This constant  awareness of Allah in every moment of life is called taqwa (piety, wariness). Once a sin has  already been committed, tawba (repentance) can help the sinner receive divine forgiveness.  Taqwa and tawba are part of tawhid, insofar they are ways of confirming tawhid in the first  place, or of returning to it after a sin has been committed.  Two more concepts are frequently mentioned as core parts of Salafi ideology: kufr and bid’a.   The word kufr derives from the Arabic term “to cover” (in the Islamic sense of “to cover the  truth of Islam”), and means disbelief in Allah and the Prophet Muhammad. As such, it  includes the various forms of shirk.  Bid’a literally means innovation, i.e. innovations in matters of religion that deviate from  Allah’s orders as revealed by Muhammad. Depending on the stance of the respective Salafi,  bid’a clxxxithe mihrab, or nook inside a mosque that faces Mecca, can as easily be considered   clxxxii, another Salafi group’s means of actionclxxxiiias might nationality , saint-worship, or  music. What makes bid’a deplorable is its violation of tawhid, whether in form of shirk or by  transgressing what was prescribed by Allah.    The Tawhid-Theme  48    </page> <page sequence="51">    This discussion has elucidated how all of the concepts of Salafism that are concerned with the  Islamic ideal, as distinct from the factual situation of the Muslim umma, lead back to the idea  of tawhid.

Sincere remorse that can lead to God’s Way to return to  forgiveness. tawhid    The commonality between the trichotomy of tawhid and its related concepts lies in their focus  on something categorically separate from real life: God. They refer to an ideal free from the  deficiencies of reality. The sorry state of affairs in much of the Muslim world – or in the  individual lives of the believers – does not impair God because He is aloof from His creation.  All efforts to submit to God constitute the Salafi quest for religious purity. Salafi movements  around the globe all agree to the centrality of this purity, which is echoed in scholarly  clxxxiv literature on Salafism.  However, analysis of Salafi ideology usually falls short of  extrapolating the actual meaning of this purity. As examination of tawhid in all its aspects  reveals, the “pure creed” is logically inconsistent, and the “pure praxis” is consequently ill- defined and a matter of interpretation. Salafi purity is coherent only as a negative concept:  submission of individual thought, desire and behavior to something. This something  necessarily remains subject to debate.  But since God’s word is considered to be obvious in  meaning, the interpreting act of the Salafi is not recognized: If a scholar only had enough  knowledge, then the path of sharia would be crystal clear. Thus, ideas about life and religion  that diverge from Salafism, as well as different Islamic interpretations of what is right and  wrong can only be caused, according to Salafi ideology, by ignorance or evil intentions. If the  contender acts out of ignorance, he is beneath the Salafi believer. If he acts out of evil  intentions, he is an adversary of God’s revelation. In both cases, the contender is no  competition for the Salafi in the strictest meaning of that word, as competition is only possible  between equals. Any person who accepts his faith as what it is – one belief amidst other  beliefs whose truth cannot ultimately be established by proof – can compete with other views  on the grounds of their commonality among all forms of faith. But the idea of tawhid does not  50    </page> <page sequence="53">    distinguish among forms of faith, but rather between belief and disbelief.  One leads towards  heaven and one towards hell, with no common ground between them. Anyone who is not on  the right path – i.e. who does not share Salafi ideology and praxis – can only be an object for  proselytization, or else is a kafir (infidel), mushrik (polytheist), mubtadi’ (innovator), munafiq  (hypocrite), or another of the derogatory terms on the long list used by Salafi Islam. This is  why Salafi ideology produces fierce conflict not only with other Muslims but also within the  Salafi movement itself – conflict that usually ends in mutual accusations of being kafir,  mushrik, mubtadi’ etc. The consequence of the elimination of competition among faiths is the  opposite of contentment: The tawhid-theme marks all contenders against Salafi ideology as  agents of evil, thus superseding competition. In this way, the tawhid-theme excludes Muslim  contenders by accusing them of violating tawhid and framing them as being not truly Islamic,  or even as agents of forces hostile to Islam. In this operation lies the organizational  significance of the concept of purity in Salafism: it is a means of exclusion.  By demarcating evil, the Salafi community constitutes itself as a pure community, firqa an- najiyya (the saved sect) or taifa mansura (victorious group) that has to constantly watch over  clxxxv its purity by purging the group, the movement and eventually society as a whole.  As  such, the tawhid-theme marks the boundaries of the pure community by excluding the kuffar,  deviant Muslims and Salafi contenders.  The tawhid-theme of Salafi ideology does nothing but exclude. It laments the shortcomings of  Salafi adherents, the inadequacy of other Muslims, and the ignorance and wickedness of  everybody else. By itself, it would not only lead the Salafi movement to total isolation, but  would also cause utter, internal fragmentation. What provides coherence to the movement is  the second theme, which runs counter to the concern for purity and tawhid: the umma-theme.    51    </page> <page sequence="54">    Umma  The umma is the community of believers in Islam. About 1.6 billion Muslims living around  the globe are part of this community. There is no unitary representation, no body or institution  that speaks for the umma. At least since the end of the Ottoman Caliphate, the umma has had  no territorial delineation; neither does the umma have, apart from a shared belief in Islam, a  civilizational denominator. Kamali contended: “The notion of umma was used by Muhammad  to unify Arab tribes,”clxxxvi and “Neither in the Arab world nor in Iran was there ever a society  consisting of a unified body called umma.”clxxxvii The idea of the umma may play a role in  Muslim societies and in Islamic organizations and movements, but it is nonetheless a fiction  or, as Roy has put it, “It has to be thought of in abstract or imaginary terms.”clxxxviii This,  however, does not mean that the imaginary community does not have real-life implications.  After all, many Muslim individuals and organizations act from the very consciousness of  being part of the global umma. For our purposes, it is largely irrelevant how the idea of the  umma as a single Muslim community finds specific expression in the various Muslim  societies of today’s world. Our interest may thus focus in its entirety on the concept of umma,  where it is relevant to the behavior of the Salafi movement and, more specifically, where it  functions as a means of inclusion antagonistic to the exclusionary function of the tawhid- theme. That the notion of a united umma of Muslims is indeed a unifying idea appears almost  self-explanatory. However, in formulating what we have called the umma-theme, we again  aim to describe an overarching concept that is implicit in Salafi ideology and its logical  derivatives, just as we have argued before that the tawhid-theme is the common denominator  of concepts like kufr, bid’a, taghut etc. We must examine those concepts that relate to the  community of believers. Such a relationship can logically exist on two levels only: the level  of the collective as a whole, and the level of the members of that collective. The relationship  of individuals to the collective may be established by virtue of their being, or not being, part  of it, or by their becoming part of it or becoming estranged from it. The first two instances  52    </page> <page sequence="55">    describe attributes or situations, viz. being a believer or being an unbeliever. The latter two  instances describe a process or action, viz. becoming a believer or becoming an unbeliever.  The individual level of community membership appears in discussions about takfir (declaring  somebody an infidel) and about who should be considered a kafir (infidel). The same can be  said for the level of the collective, i.e. of the umma as a whole. There are two possible states  and two processes. The first state would be the umma itself, the second the community of  clxxxix unbelievers.  In terms of processes, one can conceive of the collective, or umma,  becoming part of its opposite, that is of the community of unbelievers, as the first process, and  of the community of unbelievers becoming part of the umma as the second process – that is,  as the ultimate victory of Islam. But neither process has a historical precedent, nor has either  idea truly developed into a specific Salafi concept. To be clear, the impending doom of the  umma and (alternatively) the ultimate victory of Islam are very much present in Salafi  teachings. But they form two extreme outcomes for the umma, just as heaven and hell  constitute two extreme outcomes for the life of the individual. What are important are those  Salafi, umma-related concepts that are relevant to the umma prior to its final doom or  cxc victory  – that is, the state of the umma itself, whether it stands united or is in disarray. In  Salafi terms, this concerns the question of fitna (striving).  Given these rather abstract considerations, we can identify those Salafi concepts that are part  of the umma-theme. We will examine the concept of the umma itself and its logical opposite,  the kuffar (infidels), who are the external threat to the umma. Similarly, we will inspect the  concept of fitna, insofar as it constitutes the internal threat to the umma.  Solicitude for the umma, the community of all Muslims, is not peculiar to Salafism. In fact,  cxci the unity of the Muslims has been an issue since the early days of Islam.  At least since the  Abbasid dynasty, it has served as a rallying cry in Islamic statecraft. Moreover, it has  provided much of the ideological basis for the multi-ethnic Ottoman Empire, the Third World  th century, and for today’s AQ.cxciimovements of the 20    53    </page> <page sequence="56">    An analysis of the concept of the umma reveals that what we are here trying to extrapolate as  part of the broader framework of Salafi activism is neither a theoretical construct of the author  nor a doctrinaire invention of the ideological leaders of contemporary Salafism. Yet neither  can it be a concept that covers the myriad communities of more than 1400 years of Islamic  history. Instead of trying to distill a substratum from the variety of Islamic communities in  time and space, we will examine what Nieuwenhuijze has called the “operational  significance”cxciii of the umma concept, which, as we shall see, provides an opposing theme to  the exclusionary tawhid rhetoric. To this end, the umma concept shall be traced back to the  time of its genesis: the age of the salaf as-salih and the Prophet Muhammad.     Historical Development of the Umma Concept  The exact derivation of the word umma is disputed. Jeffrey speculates that it was borrowed  from the Hebrew uhma (lit. tribe or people), although it seems not to be a Semitic word at all  cxciv but rather a derivate of the Akkadian ummatu.  In the Qur’an it appears sixty four times,  thirteen of them in the plural, umam. The Meccan suras use it forty seven times – much more  often than the do Medinan suras, in which it occus only seventeen times. Throughout the  Qur’an, the term umma covers a variety of realities.cxcv  In its earliest and most frequent use in the Meccan suras, the term refers to “communities or  nations in general,” each of which has its “fixed term and a day of judgment”.cxcvi Already  during the Meccan period, this meaning changed and took on a religious connotation, coming  to denote the monotheistic religions as one community of believers in the same God and his  cxcvii prophets, or as the entirety of humankind.  Considering the situation of Muhammad during  the early stage of his prophethood – as a member of the Meccan aristocracy who turned  cxcviii against the traditional structures of his ailing and disintegrating community  – his early  message added an Arab dimension (the Arab umma) to what Muhammad claimed was a  community of believers in the prophets who had essentially brought the same, universal  54    </page> <page sequence="57">    cxcix revelation from the same God.  Upon Muhammad’s failure to establish a new social order  and his forced departure from Mecca, this concept changed again. In Medina the term umma,  which had been more an abstract ideal than a descriptor of a social reality, gained a judicial  and political character, and was used to express the contracted union between the tribes of  cc Muslims and Jews in the city:  the “Constitution of Medina”. This reflected on its meaning.  Denny argues: “The ummah of the constitution is made up of believers and Muslims, and  quite possibly Jews as well.”cci Rubin points to article 1 of the constitution, which refers to the  contractors as umma wahida (one umma), an expression that in the respective passages of the  Qur’an always indicates a common religious orientation. In this light, the constitution declares  ccii Muslims and Jews to share the same creed.  However, article 25 recognizes the Jews as an  “umma of believers,” who were entitled to retain their own creed.cciii  Therefore Denny  contends that article 25 can be read in two ways: the Jews are part of the umma or they  cciv constitute an umma of their own.  Rubin concludes that the inclusion of the Jews in the  concept of “umma” was mainly a far-reaching concession aimed at winning them over to  Muhammad’s cause,ccv while Denny formulates the status of the Jews in the constitution as a  kind of “sub-ummah”ccvi within the united umma of Medina. Instead of pondering the precise  notion of umma that is stipulated in the Constitution of Medina, it is worthwhile to  ccvii recapitulate the operational significance of the term for the social process in the city.   Muhammad moved with his followers from Mecca to what was then called Yathrib, a highly  heterogeneous area of loosely-connected oases with multiple clans and tribes laying claim to  the sources of water and fertile ground. Yathrib’s incoherent built environment reflected its  political disunity. For at least fifty years, the tribes of Yathrib entertained feuds that had  steadily grown in number and intensity, ultimately culminating in attempts to evict or even  ccviii exterminate rival groups.  Muhammad’s standing in Medina was in the beginning by no  means that of an autocratic ruler. He was acknowledged as a prophet; the constitution stated  to refer internal disputes to him. Essentially, he was similar to a tribal chief, and as such only  55    </page> <page sequence="58">    ccix one of many important men in Medina.  The inclusion of the Jewish tribes in the concept of  umma appears, consequently, as an act of political necessity. Watt argues that the umma in  Medina had factually a territorial basis even though the parties, whose thinking was still  ccx rooted in tribalism, could not have acknowledged this.  The operational significance of the  umma concept in the Constitution of Medina seems therefore to be the formulation of a  communal and territorial bond that was religious and tribal at the same time, inasmuch as it  was shaped in the image of the traditional, kinship-based community system, with a religious  dimension. The concept of the umma described the heterogeneous community in Medina,  while simultaneously denoting a community of believers for whom Muhammad was God’s  messenger.  The Medinan suras know “umma” only in the sense of a religious community. In them, the  concept refers to the religious community of humankind, of Abraham and of the community  ccxi that surrenders to God.  But the notion of the umma underwent another, final transformation  that reflected Muhammad’s growing power base, which allowed him to loosen the  community’s ties to non-Muslims. In the chronologically last suras, the Qur’an again applies  the term umma to particular groups or religious communities, and heralds the Muslim umma  ccxii as the best umma.   The Qur’anic development of the concept of umma thus shifts from “a community under  judgment” in the early Meccan days, to a “religious community,” and finally to the “almost  exclusive property of Islam as a world historic movement.”ccxiii If the umma ever had a  territorial dimension, it was during the Medinan period prior to the victory over pagan Mecca.  After the conquest of Mecca, the term umma reappears neither in the Qur’an nor in any treaty.  Watt presumes that an official term was no longer needed, since official diplomacy was  conducted in the name of God and His prophet, and members of Muslim tribes were simply  ccxiv considered Muslims.  The concept of the umma as the community of the Muslims became,  ccxv however, dominant,  if not always relevant. Under the Persian-influenced Abbasid caliphate  56    </page> <page sequence="59">    and, much later, under the multi-ethnic Caliphate of the Ottomans, the idea of an Islamic  ccxvi umma again became somewhat more important as a symbol of political unity.   But, paradoxically, the true renaissance of the umma concept coincides with the actual decline  th of its political and social institutions. Beginning in the 16  century, the Ottoman Empire was  ccxvii in decline.  The ban on the printing press, the disregard of the discovery of the Americas,  internal political decay and, of course, the resistance to economic reform during the  development of a market economy in Europe all were milestones in the decline of the last  Caliphate, which lost more and more of its military power and territories. The defeat of the  Ottoman forces at the battle of Vienna in 1683, and the subsequent Peace of Karlowitz in  1699, which marked the end of the short-lived Ottoman control over most of central Europe,  were the first visible signs of this decline. The next major blow to the Caliphate, and more  importantly to the Muslim consciousness, followed when Napoleon invaded Egypt in 1798  and crushed the Mamluk army near the Pyramids of Giza. Even more insulting to the great  Muslim empire, was that another European power drove out the French: It was Rear Admiral  Nelson and the British forces that defeated the French fleet, and not the Ottomans themselves.  Given the increasing stagnation and decay of Ottoman rule, and the growing influence of  Europe in the lands that had been dominated by Islam for hundreds of years, the idea of a  united umma increasingly became the substitute for material power. At the same time, it  became the rallying cry for an Islamic revival whose first proponent was Jamal Al-Din Al- Afghani, who has already been cited as one of the early Muslim reformers. Al-Afghani gave  the term “umma” new meaning: that of a modern, political community.ccxviii It goes without  saying that the determination of the umma as a political community was an entirely  teleological concept – quite similar, actually, to its original determination, proposed by  Muhammad, only under very different circumstances. The next in line to appropriate the term  umma, after the early Salafiyya, were the secular Arab dictatorships and their Nasserite and  Baathist ideologues, which used “umma” as a catch phrase for pan ccxix-Arabism.  The Islamist  57    </page> <page sequence="60">    th movements of the 20  century took advantage of the deep-rooted sympathy for pan-Islamic  ccxx ideas even after pan-Islamism as a political program had failed.  Islamist propaganda about  the umma as the transnational, political and religious unity of all Muslims can be traced to the  ccxxi early days of the Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt, and continues in agitation of AQ today.   Revisiting the sympathy for the umma from the end of the last caliphate to this day, Halliday  concludes: “Modernist political movements have an instrumental relation to the substratum  [of the concept of umma], and use whatever is available for contemporary purposes”. The  contemporary Salafi movement is no exception to this.  Having reviewed the historic development and use of the concept of the umma, we can now  outline its substratum, and thus our concept of the umma-theme.    The Umma as a Collective Identity  The foregoing considerations suggest that the substratum of the umma concept is a  teleological vision rather than a manifest social reality.  But it is a vision that is applicable and  has been applied to the aggregate of Muslim societies, countries and movements throughout  history, virtually unifying the fragmented real world of Muslims by imposing on it a concept  rooted in the Qur’an that shares in the divine grandeur of Islamic scripture. The lack of any  body or institution that symbolizes the umma has certainly worked to augment this  ideological projection. So has the fact that sharia does not stipulate any organ for its  ccxxii implementation and maintenance.  The absence of any institution that embodies the umma,  in conjunction with the implicit call to realize the umma as an actual community, leads to a  situation, as Nieuwenhuijze put it, in which “the individual human person, tends to end up in  a position where ‘individual’ is more relevant (for the given balance in the relationship  between individual aspect and community aspect), than ‘person’.”ccxxiii The “latitude of  ‘individual’, non-socially controlled, movement” that is significant for Islam ultimately  renders the individual Muslim “sociologically, a monad, notwithstanding the fact that of  58    </page> <page sequence="61">    course logically and religiously nothing would seem to be farther from him than just  this.”ccxxiv Consequently, the amorphousness of the concept of community intrinsic to the  umma creates an “existential need for social cohesion” that can logically only be fulfilled by  communities that are “complementary (in the modern, strict sense) as regards the concept of  ‘umma’.”ccxxv  It follows from this that the concept of the umma is in itself distinct from the social reality it  refers to. To quote Nieuwenhuijze once again, the “umma” can be seen as a “social identity”  in the sense that it describes “a complex of experiential data, observed as one reality, which is  the self-perpetuating autonomous function of one case (or, single process) of social cohesion.  individual image.”ccxxviAs such, it is a resultant case of osmosis between reality and its supra-   It therefore makes no sense to ask how the Salafi movement relates to the umma. Instead we  must ask: What is the specific function of the concept of the umma in Salafi ideology?   Thus far, we have tried to explain that this concept is by no means different for the Salafi  movement than for any other movement, government, or autocracy that uses it, and has not  been at least since the abolishment of the Ottoman Caliphate. Through a religious tradition  based on the Qur’an, it links a given cause to a social identity that it shares with the majority  of Muslims (irrespective of everything else that Salafis and other Muslims disagree about).  Therefore, any reference to the umma subsumes the person, group or movement referring to it  in a much larger virtual community. This is what we may call the inclusionary function of the  umma-theme. Before conceptualizing this theme as the antipode of the tawhid-theme, we shall  now briefly introduce the two other main concepts that are related to it logically, as well as in  Salafi praxis.    Takfir  The root of the word takfir, k-f-r, is the same as the root of the words kufr (unbelief) and kafir  or kuffar (infidel, sg. and pl., respectively). Takfir denotes the action of declaring somebody  59    </page> <page sequence="62">    an infidel. It is therefore always directed against a person or a group of people, who were born  as Muslims or who have converted to Islam and who at least nominally still belong to the ahl  ccxxvii al-qibla (the people who pray facing Mecca).  Kruse has pointed out that there is no  specific institution in Islam that is vested with the authority to declare takfir (with exception  of the Bohra, a branch of Ismaili Shia-Islam). Consequently, the ulama and fuqaha (Islamic  jurists) usually fulfill this task, even though the success of a given verdict depends on the  ccxxviii support it gains, either from the believing masses or the political authorities.  A  declaration of takfir casts the one it is declared against as an outlaw and murtad (apostate)  from whom the aman (protection) that God grants all believers is withdrawn. Not only is  killing such a person not considered a sin, but as an apostate, he actually must be killed.  ccxxix Hegghammer has divided the use of takfir into three categorical instances:  A group that  opposes a ruler may declare him an apostate in order to legitimize violent insurrection. A  prominent example of this is AQ’s calls to fight the apostate regimes of the Middle East:  “After the fall of our orthodox caliphates on March 3, 1924 and after expelling the  colonialists, our Islamic nation was afflicted with apostate rulers who took over in the  Moslem nation. These rulers turned out to be more infidel and criminal than the colonialists  themselves.”ccxxx The second type of takfir is that declared by a recognized or self-appointed  official against an individual, usually a progressive intellectual. Cases in point are the 1989  fatwa of Iran’s Supreme Leader Khomeini against the author Salman Rushdie, and the 2008  ruling of a group of Saudi clerics that two Saudi columnists should be killed for questioning  ccxxxi the view that adherents of other faiths are infidels.  Hegghammer’s third type of takfir is  that of a small sect that considers the whole society to be kuffar. In modern history, this idea  was first propagated by Sayyid Qutb, who outlined in his “Milestones” that society had  ccxxxii regressed to a state of infidelity comparable to that of pre-Islamic times (jahiliyya).  His  ideas of jahiliyya and hakimiyya (that only God has the right to rule) subsequently served as  60    </page> <page sequence="63">    the ideological basis for the violence of various militant groups, among them the Egyptian  ccxxxiii Salafi group Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiyya.   The idea of seeing the majority of Muslims as unbelievers whose murder would go  unpunished dates back to the early Islamic sect of the Azariqah, who were part of a group of  ccxxxivccxxxv Muslims that has come to be known by the name khawarij.  The memory of the  khawarij is still very much alive in Muslim and particularly Salafi debate today. They serve as  a negative example of the use of takfir, and are often referred to by contemporary scholars  ccxxxvi who wish to impugn the teachings of rival ideologues.    Takfir, like khawarij, has a negative connotation in Muslim debate. Consequently, the  derivative takfiri is used to describe a person who declares takfir, but is not a self-appellation.  ccxxxvii Even though this has been pointed out before,  the terms takfiri and takfirism are often  still misrepresented in the media, official publications and even scholarly literature. Without  elaborating on the spread of the misconception of takfirism as an ideology in its own right, it  is sufficient to note that numerous sources persist in using the term without recognizing that,  ccxxxviii like khawarij, it was coined within Muslim debate to stigmatize a political opponent.   The uncritical use of both terms creates a faulty point of departure for any analysis of  Islamism: It conceives, a priori, of a certain group or current as featuring a fundamentally  distinct point in its ideology, while in reality it is not only the individuals and groups  considered to be takfiris or kharijites that accuse other Muslims of being apostates.  The same holds true for a term with an almost opposite meaning: murji’a, which is used to  stigmatize those Muslims who actually or allegedly separate belief from action, thereby  violating tawhid al-‘ibada as explained above. Derived from the Arabic irja’ (to defer), it is  applied to proponents of the idea that Muslims cannot be judged by their actions, because  only a loss of faith can make a Muslim an apostate. Wiktorowicz mentions the murji’a as a  ccxxxix sect of early Islam opposed to the khawarij.  However, Pessagno has already shown that  murji’a ccxlis an umbrella term;  he concurred with Schacht, who explained: “The Murji’a,  61    </page> <page sequence="64">    indeed, was [sic] none other than the great majority of Muslims at the time of the Umaiyads;  they kept clear of Khariji risings and of ‘Abbasid propaganda, movements which menaced the  unity of the community; this is why they were loyal to the government, for whatever its faults  they would not pass judgment on any of those who professed Islam but resigned themselves  tion.” ccxlito things as they were and accepted the decrees of divine predestina   Reviewing the term murji’a and its operational significance for those using it to stigmatize  their ideological competitors reveals that it is the logical opposite of the accusation  “khawarij”. Wiktorowicz is well aware of this when he writes: “The doctrine of irja was thus  a means of maintaining unity amidst the chaos of civil war.”ccxlii While Salafis use the  accusation of murji’a to emphasize the need to stick to all aspects of tawhid, including tawhid  al-‘ibada, they use the stigma of khawarij against groups whose use of takfir seems  inappropriate. Wiktorowicz stresses that the mainstream Salafi position on the matter of takfir  is to differentiate acts of apostasy from the apostate – that is, a person who has actually  ccxliii renounced Islam.   In his treatise “Warning against the Fitna of Takfir,” the eminent Salafi  scholar Al-Albani has gathered much of the Salafi argumentation against a broad use of takfir  and outlined how, in his view, apostasy should be determined. Al-Albani cites a faulty  understanding of Sura 5:44 as the foundation of takfir: “And whosoever does not judge with  what Allaah has revealed are the kuffar.”ccxliv He argues that the kufr referred to in this ayah is  “a kufr less than kufr;” thus, the kuffar mentioned are not necessarily apostates from  ccxlv Islam.  He concludes that declaring takfir on sinners is not allowed, unless “it becomes  apparent to us – with certainty – and it is unveiled with what is in the depths of their own  selves that from their Aqeedah they do not prohibit what Allah and His Messenger have  prohibited.”ccxlvi  The problem is therefore that this assessment necessarily includes some arbitrariness, as there  is no way to objectively determine when a sinner sins out of “the depths of his own self” and  62    </page> <page sequence="65">    when his behavior might be excused by ignorance, the derivation of personal gain from the  ccxlvii sin, extenuating circumstances, or an outside force that coerced the person to sin.   Wagemakers has examined the problem in the writings of the preacher Abu Muhammad Al- ccxlviii Maqdisi, which are highly influential in Jihadi circles.  As Al-Albani has critiqued, Al- Maqdisi uses Sura 5:44 to declare Muslim rulers apostates if they do not implement sharia  (and nothing but sharia, in its entirety). To refute Al-Albani’s objection that the kufr  mentioned in the sura was a form of lesser kufr and not sufficient cause for takfir, Al-Maqdisi  divides faith into three levels. The first level, sihhat ad-din, includes the basic tenets of Islam.  The second level, wajib ad-din, comprises the commandments and prohibitions of Islam. The  third level, kamal ad-din, encompasses only Islamically commendable acts. The violation of  the first level of faith inevitably makes a Muslim an apostate, while the omission of acts from  the third level has no consequences. It is the second level that is problematic: a violation of  faith at this level is in any case considered to be fisq (a sin), and as such at least kufr asghar  (minor disbelief). The question, however, is under what circumstances it becomes kufr akbar  (major disbelief), and therefore synonymous with apostasy. Al-Maqdisi repeats the conditions  that most Salafi scholars cite: If the action is supported by conviction (i’tiqad), if it involves  the explicit legitimization of the action for others (istihlal) or if it negates the truth of Islam  ccxlix (jahad), it may be considered a violation of the second level of faith, and hence apostasy.   While Al-Maqdisi agrees with Al-Albani that Surah 5:44 was revealed with regard to the  Jews, he argues that if a Muslim ruler were to repeatedly and systematically apply un-Islamic  laws, he would also have to be considered an apostate, as the surah does not say that the Jews  “disbelieved in their hearts” when they applied their own laws.ccl The impreciseness of the  stipulation in the Qur’an does not allow for a strict interpretation of the status of a Muslim  legislator who applies law alien to sharia. Both scholars can therefore deduce opposite  understandings, which cater their respective political preferences: Al-Albani can defend the  ruling establishment in Saudi Arabia, and Al-Maqdisi the rebellion against it.  63    </page> <page sequence="66">    When we compare khawarij, takfirism and murji’a, it is the latter concept that stands out. The  question of when to apply takfir or, more precisely, when someone must be considered an  apostate, cannot strictly be answered. Therefore, the designation of khariji for a person  wrongfully applying, or exaggerating the application of, takfir is as much a political  designation as is the concept of takfir itself. Conversely, the concept of murji’a is at least  potentially untainted, when it refers to the stance that “works” are not part of faith: That is,  “as long as a person professes belief in Islam (through the single ‘act’ of confession of faith),  then that person is a Muslim.”ccli In Salafi praxis, however, the concept of murji’a, like takfir  cclii and khawarij, is usually applied as suits the needs of the day.  All three concepts – khariji,  murji’a, and takfiri – are therefore what we call a “means of exclusion,” and belong to the  tawhid-theme. But accusations against kharijis and takfiris also differ from charges  concerning violations of tawhid. They imply that not do these “extremists” deviate from the  true path, but also that their behavior is politically harmful because it causes dissent and may  lead to civil strife, which weakens the umma in face of the kuffar. This unease stems much  less from concern for religious purity than it does from the fear of a state of fitna.    Fitna  means, “putting to the proof” or “discriminatory test”.ccliiiLiterally fitna  The early  commentators of the Qur’an, Al-Tabari, Ibn Kathir and Al-Razi, consider fitna to be any thing  or person that separates a Muslim from Islam so that he repudiates it and becomes an  cclivcclv infidel.   In this early sense, fitna relates to the attempts of the unbelievers to lure Muslims away from  Islam, which combines the elements of a threat to the nascent Muslim community and to the  worship of God. The latter threat we have already covered under what we have called the  tawhid-theme. What is more important here is the threat towards the Muslim community. In  sura 2:217 this threat still appears as the infidels, who fight Muslims. With the ascension of  64    </page> <page sequence="67">    Mu’awiya and the Umayyads, the term fitna was applied to the ensuing civil war in the  cclvi Caliphate.  This second meaning of fitna has remained prevalent ever since. Ayalon notes:  “Fitna epitomized all that was objectionable in an act of rebellion against the government: it  meant sedition, civil strife, the disruption of political and religious order, and a grave menace  ric of the community.”cclviito the social fab  This notion remained the dominant Muslim view  th on violent insurrection up until the 20  century. Even then the popular revolts and coup  d’états in the Arab world were not seen as  cclviiifitna but rather as thawra (revolution).   The concepts of takfir and khawarij are closely linked to fitna as two of its main causes.  “old fitnah germinated by the khawarij.”cclixAlbani calls takfir  Here again, fitna explicitly  refers to the dissent resulting from accusations of apostasy. But in Salafi ideology, fitna can  only be because the umma does not follow tawhid in all its aspects. Thus fitna is a deviation  from the correct creed and praxis of Islam; at the same time, it is detrimental for the umma. It  indicates a discrepancy with the Islamic ideal and a hazard to Muslim life, a threat to doctrine  and reality. Both have to be considered separately. As a state in which tawhid is violated, fitna  is a problem of religious purity and thus concerns the after-life of the individual believer. But  as a state in which the Muslim community is weakened due to infighting, it is a problem of  political utility and thus concerns this life’s reality.  Turning to the Saudi Sheikh Salih Ibn Fawzan Al-Fawzan we find both issues, the violation of  tawhid and fitna, interlinked as the greatest problems facing the umma. Fawzan writes in a  fatwa: “Likewise the greatest danger facing the Islamic umma is the misguidance and  deviation regarding the creed and the infiltration of kufr, shirk, bid’a, grave-worship, Sufism,  cults and superstition. Also of the greatest danger for the Islamic umma is her separation and  enmity between [the Muslims] themselves. The cure for this is in the return to the book and  the Sunna, to learn them, teach them, judge by them between people and adopt their  thics.”cclxe  Violation of tawhid and fitna are both presented as the greatest threat to the umma.  Fawzan’s solution, the return to the Qur’an and Sunna, is the typical panacea of Salafism: If  65    </page> <page sequence="68">    everybody would follow the true path the umma would be pure and united – the caveat being  that the true path is the way of the Salafis, or, in case of Salafi dissent, the way of the  respective group, or, in case of dissent within the group, the way of the respective rivaling  factions and so forth, all the way down to the single Muslim individual who sees his own way  as the way of God. This constitutive, destructive dynamic of the Salafi movement is reflected  in much of Salafi thought as a weakness advantageous to the enemies of the entire umma,  who are typically identified as Jews, Christians or Crusaders, atheists and the West in  cclxi general.   In this sense, deviation from tawhid and fitna are threats to the umma from outside –  embodied in the kuffar and Satan. Both pose an external threat but affect the umma also from  within by luring Muslims away from the right path, i.e. tempting them to violate tawhid. As  was discussed above, the guidance derived from the Qur’an and Sunna, especially on political  issues, depends on the contextual reading of the sources. A definite conclusion cannot be  drawn, yet the form of Islamic authority to decide disputes is not stipulated in the scriptures  either. Hence, internal disagreement is bound to occur. This completely inherent cause for  dissent cannot be reflected in Salafi thought, as it touches on the dogmatic infallibility of the  Qur’an. Nonetheless, it constantly recurs in the Salafi aporia of “purifying” Islam from “false  belief” on one hand and uniting the umma on the other. In a letter to Sheikh Al-Fawzan, this  conflict is called “ bid’a;”cclxiifitna inherent in  the letter asks Fawzan how to resolve the  problem that calling to purity can lead to fitna. It is an important document, as a senior Salafi  scholar addresses the aporia at the heart of Salafism without diverting attention to outside  forces:  “If there was an alert about the fitna inherent in bid’a, should silence be kept first on that  matter? Or does one have to call out and let happen what will [i.e. fitna]?” Al-Fawzan  answers: “This depends on the circumstances. If the results would be more harmful than  beneficial then it would be most appropriate to choose the lesser of the two evils.” cclxiii  By  66    </page> <page sequence="69">    referring to “the circumstances” Fawzan avoids a definite answer to the question, which  would inevitably suspend the aporia of ideological rigidity and political practicability in favor  of one or the other. His mentioning “the lesser of the two evils” does not provide any basis  from which particular instances can be judged, because there is no measure with which the  magnitude of a given evil can be determined: How far would how many Muslims have to  deviate from tawhid to justify a countermeasure that would lead to a certain intensity of fitna?  Al-Fawzan cannot answer this question, abstract as it is, which is symptomatic of Salafism in  general. Instead, Fawzan outlines the range of measures a Muslim can take against the  deviation of others: “But do not keep quiet about the [wrong] statement and call to God with  good exhortation and educate the people little by little...[teaching] the ignorant begins with  this, with wisdom and leniency, and if we see from him some reluctance we will preach and  make him fear God Almighty, and if we see that he does not accept the truth and wants to fend  off the truth with force, then he will meet force in response.”cclxiv But a forceful response  against a Muslim (and perhaps a Salafi) who disagrees with a particular idea or interpretation  of another Salafi Muslim is exactly what the questioner wants to avoid: fitna. Fawzan closes  his argument with the Arabic proverb: likul muqam maqal [lit. “every situation has its  locution”] – each case must be decided individually. This is precisely the opposite of an  answer to the question. There is no rule the believer can stick to, but only a plentitude of  situations, each in need of a different approach to fulfilling tawhid and keeping the umma  united. Essentially, Fawzan refers the question to the arbitrary decision of every Muslim, and  asks only for his initial restraint and an effort to avoid fitna. In reality this advice can only  lead to a great measure of opportunism. If a Salafi (or group of Salafis) feels strongly enough  to call somebody a mushrik (polytheist), mubtadi’ (innovator), or worse – he can do so. If he  feels that a harsh word or even action would be detrimental to his missionary work, he should  fight it. This impetus is the logical link to the umma concept. Even though Salafism does not  specify the hierarchy of “ensuring tawhid” and “avoiding fitna” in case of a clash of interests,  67    </page> <page sequence="70">    the idea of safeguarding the umma from internal fighting and dissent as a value of its own,  separate from tawhid, is a cornerstone of Salafi ideology. As a negative expression of the  value of the umma, fitna is part of the umma-theme.     The Umma-Theme  The umma-theme, as it is presented here, is an attempt to conceptualize the second  cornerstone of Salafi ideology, which acts as an antipode to the various other Salafi concepts,  which refer to the Salafi ideal of total obedience to God. Being the advocate of a complicated  reality, the umma-theme softens the rigidity of the tawhid-theme. The reality it defends is not  the reality of individual persons, however, but the reality of the imagined Muslim collective  and its composite monades: individual persons not as persons but only as Muslims.  Paradoxically, it leads back to what is completely imaginary – God – because the value of the  umma derives solely from its expressing the conformity of reality to God’s legislative will,  the al-irada ash-shariyyah. This is also why the umma itself is not part of the Islamic  cclxv creed.  Therefore, strictly speaking, the tension between the umma-theme and the tawhid- theme appears as a contradiction within tawhid itself. The demand that reality must submit to  Islam has a quantitative and a qualitative dimension. The greatest number of people must  adhere to Islam as closely as possible. This contradiction becomes an aporia because “as  closely to Islam as possible” is indeterminable; the greater the number of people who submit  to Islam, the greater the number of ideas of what “as closely to Islam as possible” is.cclxvi  The main concepts that are logically linked to the umma-theme are presented in Tab. 3.  68    </page> <page sequence="71">      Tab.3 Concepts of Umma  Concept Meaning Relation to Umma    Community of believers Entirety of Muslims as one  Umma  collective  Strife, civil war Disunity of the umma  Fitna    Takfir Declaring one or several Muslims to be apostates Leads to disunity of the umma    Muslim habitually declaring other Muslims to be Harms the umma by causing  Takfiri  apostates fitna  Practice of habitually declaring other Muslims to be Harms the umma by causing  Takfirism  apostates fitna  Another term for takfiri, derived from the historical Harms the umma by causing  Khariji  group of  Khawarij fitna  Infidels, all non-Muslims thought of as one collective Community opposed to the  Kuffar  umma    All of these concepts of the umma-theme agree in their relationship to what is practicable:  They are concerned with political utility. Whereas the tawhid-theme strives to make reality  conform to tawhid, the umma-theme points at the danger of outsiders and internal dissent, thus  preferring real power to ideological purity or, more precisely, preferring a maximization of  Islam’s power base (the whole umma instead of a virtuous vanguard) to a minimization of the  number of contenders for Islamic leadership (the groups and individuals considered to be on  the “true path of Islam” and thus legitimately speaking for Islam). The function of the umma- 69    </page> <page sequence="72">    theme is thus inclusionary. Whereas the exclusionary function of the tawhid-theme finds its  cclxvii theoretical limit only in the single Muslim, who declares takfir over all mankind,  the  umma-theme generally does not stretch beyond the number of people who declare “La ilaha  illa llah, Muhammadun rasulu llah”cclxviii and those who were born to a Muslim father, viz. the  Muslim umma. With an understanding of these conceptualizations of the notions of tawhid  and umma as broader ideological themes or master frames, we can now attempt to outline the  functional basis of Salafism.    Tawhid and Umma as the Aporetic Core of Salafism  Salafi ideology is based on two contradictory master-frames or themes. The tawhid-theme  works to distinguish the Salafi-movement from other Muslim schools and the Muslim  mainstream in general. Through this distinction it creates the collective Salafi identity, the  firqa najiyya, conceiving of the Salafis as the only group of Muslims who truly adhere to  tawhid and who therefore will be saved from hell fire.  The umma-theme, on the other hand, uses people’s existing Muslim identity to recruit and  mobilize them for the cause of the Salafi movement. It creates a sense of collectivity and  cclxix belonging by stressing the threat against the shared identity of being Muslim.   The tawhid-theme is exclusionary inasmuch as it narrows the group boundary to a chosen  circle in an ocean of infidelity, ignorance, half-belief and compromise. It is the leitmotif of  Salafism as an enclave culture. The umma-theme is inclusionary insofar as it rhetorically  includes all Muslims (who are rebuffed by the tawhid-theme). It is the leitmotif of Salafism as  a powerful movement and as the Caliphate to come. As such, the umma-theme is a means of  symbolic empowerment. It frames Salafi dawa efforts as beneficial to the umma and  humankind in general, and lends greatness to an otherwise insignificant political force.  70    </page> <page sequence="73">    Because of the aporetic nature of tawhid, Salafi propaganda can play both tunes: In the name  of Islam it chastises Muslims who do not follow the Salafi path, and in the name of Islam it  speaks for all Muslims, whether or not they are Salafis.   Since the argument for tawhid essentially claims Islamic identity as the prerogative of the  Salafi community, it is logically directed against competitors for this identity – other Muslims  – and consequently frames them as not “real” Muslims, or even as infidels. In other words, it  qualitatively increases inner-Islamic competition by declaring competitors to be adversaries.  Conversely, the umma-theme virtually eliminates inner-Islamic competition by fantasizing a  common adversary from outside, be he the kuffar, Satan, Jinn – or Satan and Jinn in the form  cclxx of the kuffar.   This leads to a comprehensive concept of Salafism as a bi-polar ideology: Its tawhid-theme  excludes contenders for Islam as an identity marker. Its umma-theme includes all Muslims as  an extended, virtual power base of the Salafi movement.  What remains to be seen is how both themes translate into the behavior of the Salafi  movement. To this end, we will have to examine how Salafism derives from the Islamic  sources’ practical instructions for life today.  71    </page> <page sequence="74">    Modes of Salafi Behavior  The process by which Allah’s decrees are translated into praxis is an act of interpretation. It  consists of an assessment of whether a Qur’anic decree or a trustworthy hadith is applicable  to a particular set of contemporary circumstances, and a conclusion as to what this means for  the right behavior of the believer: Do Muslims in the West have to adhere to man-made laws?  Is violent jihad against Western governments a fard ayn (individual duty) for every Muslim?  May Muslims socialize with non-Muslims?  Salafis operate as if the Qur’an and the Sunna were self-explanatory on these and all other  questions. When it comes to the Islamic creed, they reject human reason and logic as leading  to a biased reading of the Islamic sources that accommodates human interests and desires and  cclxxi fails to promote behavior in accordance with the revelation of Allah.  Consequently,  Salafis, claiming to follow the perfect path of the Prophet Muhammad, usually substitute  cclxxii argumentation with the quotation of hadiths and verses from the Quran,  declaring  emulation of what they state to be the only valid way to correct, Islamic behavior.    Reasoning by Analogy: What Would Muhammad Do?  It has been argued that, contrary to Salafi claims, it is impossible to deduce objective rulings  from the ancient sources, especially for the complexity of today’s world. The difficulty of  applying the commandments of the Qur’an to modern problems cannot be solved by turning  to the Sunna of the Prophet, because even the narrated examples of how Muhammad applied a  Qur’anic ruling to a specific problem has to be interpreted in order to determine whether it is  also applicable in a contemporary context. Wiktorowicz pointed for example at the Islamic  prohibition of usury and the derivative questions it leads to: “Does it include a home  mortgage, car loans, or credit cards? Is it determined by the amount of interest? Because the  Qur’anic verses about usury do not directly refer to contemporary economic practices,  scholars must infer mobile principles from the prohibition that can traverse particular  72    </page> <page sequence="75">    economic practices not necessarily envisioned in the text.”cclxxiii Wiktorowicz infers from the  ambiguity in the Qur’an the reliance of the Salafi community on scholars trained in the corpus  of hadith. But he also concedes that even if a hadith is proven to be sound and clear, “its  translation to modern issues and problems is not”, just as the reliability of a hadith “does not  on.”cclxxivensure an objective process of religious interpretati  The analogical reasoning (qiyas)  of Salafis, who try to proceed like Muhammad in solving contemporary problems, is in fact  merely inferential thinking that uses a set of religiously-sanctified commandments (the  Qur’an) and actions (the Sunna) of the past to deal with contemporary issues; it relates these  issues to past incidents in an attempt to draw a definite conclusion about the religious sanctity  of a present action or inaction. Since the Qur’an and the Sunna include a broad spectrum of  commandments and examples for Islamic behavior, the Salafi scholar has at his disposal a  huge number of cases (commandments and hadiths) that may provide a solution to his  problem. The question for the Salafi scholar, therefore, is which case so fits a contemporary  situation that the historic solution may be applied to it, and a ruling inferred. Wiktorowicz has  shown that the choice of a hadith or sura depends entirely on how the scholar interprets a  cclxxv contemporary issue.  The process by which Salafis derive conclusions from the sources  with which to inform their political behavior is thus an extreme form of data picking and  anecdotal evidence. The scholar picks the part of a text that fits his view of a specific case,  and uses it as evidence to promote certain behavior as a religious obligation. Diverse and at  times opposite conclusions of Salafi scholars may not only be based on the same revelation,  but may also be based on the same body of scholarly literature. In order to justify a certain  idea or position, Salafis will look for the most appropriate text by a renowned Muslim scholar  for support: “If a scholar believes that the current context is similar to the Mongol period, he  will look for Ibn Taymiyya’s writings related to the Mongols, which includes a fatwa  denouncing the Mongol leaders as apostates, even though they converted to Islam. On the  other hand, if a scholar rejects the analogy to the Mongols, he will likely instead focus on Ibn  73    </page> <page sequence="76">    Taymiyya’s writings about tawhid, shirk (worshipping other than God), and the dangers of  rationalism. The different uses of Ibn Taymiyya are not a matter of belief; all of the factions  accept him as a Salafi scholar par excellence. Divergent conclusions about which of his  ation, not theology.”cclxxviwritings to emphasize are contingent on contextual interpret  Hence,  what matters for a religious conclusion is the way the scholar sees the problem itself.  “Different interpretations make different jurisprudential principles operative” and “similar  principles operative.”cclxxviiinterpretations make similar jurisprudential   These jurisprudential principles were shaped by the historic circumstances at the time of their  creation. The single most important change in these circumstances was the emigration of the  persecuted Meccan community to Medina, and the founding there of an Islamic state with  Muhammad as its leader. This development is reflected in the chronological development of  commandments in the Qur’an and the change in Muhammad’s political behavior that is  documented in the Sunna.    From Mecca to Medina  The Qur’an is divided into 114 chapters called cclxxviiisuwar  (sg. sura), with each sura differing  in length and number of verses (ayat, sg. aya). The chapters of the Quran are not ordered  chronologically according to the time of their revelation, but according to their length; the  first, short sura, “Al Fatiha,” revealed prior to the hijra, is an exception. Muhammad did not  intend this division of the Qur’an, even though he organized at least some of his revelation  cclxxix into sections, which he called suwar.  Weil argues that the older suras have been lost or  destroyed, whilst the newer and longer suras comprise several passages revealed at different  cclxxx times.    The Qur’an can generally be divided into Meccan and Medinan suras, whose differing  content reflects changing circumstances during Muhammad’s lifetime. Even though this  partition is accepted in Muslim orthodoxy and Western scholarly debate alike, it seems  74    </page> <page sequence="77">    impossible to determine the origin of each and every sura with absolute certainty. This must  be attributed to the failure of Muhammad to ever order a compilation of his message, which  Muslim scholars usually excuse by stating that there was no need to put the revelation into  writing since the sahaba preserved it in their memories and through oral transmission. Weil  has pointed at many of the inconsistencies in the claim that the entirety of Muhammad’s  Qur’anic message survived this way without alteration. Furthermore, he suggests that the  reason for Muhammad’s carelessness in this regard was “that the majority of the so-called  revelations were called forth by the exigencies of the moment and had but a passing  significance so that their preservation did not appear very important to him.”cclxxxi Other  reasons, Weil adds, might have been Muhammad’s awareness of the many contradictions in  cclxxxii his message, and the advantage of his being able to change it at any given time.   The chronological development of the Qur’anic revelation corresponds to the changing  attitude of the Muslim community toward the pagans in Mecca, the Jews in Medina and  finally to the Christians at the northern border of the nascent Islamic empire. The Qur’an not  only provides different approaches to the unbelievers, but also divergent commandments on  the question of what constitutes just war and legitimate violence. Thus the Qur’an stipulates  peaceful perseverance in the face of enmity – but it also justifies defensive as well as  cclxxxiii offensive wars against all unbelievers.   In our discussion of the concept of umma, we have already mentioned that during the earliest  days in Mecca, Muhammad came as a reformer and prophet to his own pagan society,  preaching a monotheistic religion that he considered nothing but the Arab dimension of the  cclxxxiv existing monotheistic religions, Judaism and Christianity.  Consequently, the earliest  Meccan suras do not attack the polytheists, and even “assumed in the audience a vague  monotheism.”cclxxxv Even when the pagan majority of Mecca refused to accept Muhammad as  their prophet, no sura was revealed that called for open hostilities against them. In retrospect,  this restraint appears to be motivated by very practical considerations: “In the Meccan period  75    </page> <page sequence="78">    the believers were few, disorganized and in danger. Meccan revelations dealt with the  existence and identity of the One God, the signs of his existence, and the coming of the Last  Judgment.”cclxxxvi  With the emigration to Medina this situation changed. The early Medinan suras still reflect  cclxxxvii the need of Muhammad to win over the influential Jewish tribes in the area.  In suras  10:94 and 26:197, Muhammad even referred to the Jews as guarantors of the truth of his  cclxxxviii message.   As Muhammad was trying at that time to balance a fragile, tribal power system and assert his  position within it, the commandments he received stated that no one should be forced to  believe: There shall be no compulsion in [acceptance of] the religion. The right course has  become clear from the wrong. So whoever disbelieves in Taghut and believes in Allah has  grasped the most trustworthy handhold with no break in it. And Allah is Hearing and  cclxxxix Knowing.   ccxc As regards the Meccans, however, sura 22 contains the first permission to carry out war:   Permission [to fight] has been given to those who are being fought, because they were  wronged. And indeed, Allah is competent to give them victory.  [They are] those who have been evicted from their homes without right - only because they  say, "Our Lord is Allah." And were it not that Allah checks the people, some by means of  others, there would have been demolished monasteries, churches, synagogues, and mosques  in which the name of Allah is much mentioned. And Allah will surely support those who  ccxci support Him. Indeed, Allah is Powerful and Exalted in Might.   As he consolidated his powerbase and saw that he could not convince the Jewish tribes of  Medina to accept him as their prophet, Muhammad quickly changed his stance towards the  Jews. As Watt notes, their intransigence threatened Muhammad’s expanding enterprise: “In  Muhammad’s first two years at Medina the Jews were the most dangerous critics of his claims  to be a prophet, and the religious fervor of his followers, on which so much depended, was  76    </page> <page sequence="79">    liable to be greatly reduced unless Jewish criticisms could be silenced or rendered  impotent.”ccxcii  It was at that time that Muhammad received the first polemical suras regarding the Jews. In  order to denigrate Judaism, these suras present Islam as the religion of Abraham. This had  two advantages. Firstly, it referred to a figure who was recognized as the father of Jews and  Arabs alike. Secondly, Abraham had believed in the One God even before the Torah and the  Gospels had been revealed, and was therefore neither Jew nor Christian. Thus, Islam was  constructed as the millat Ibrahim (creed of Abraham) as distinct from Judaism and  Christianity, which had allegedly diverged from the pure religion and distorted the scripture  ccxciii out of ignorance or evil intent.   The religious condemnation of the Jews was concomitant with the physical destruction of the  Jewish tribes as a political force in the Arabian Peninsula. During the Medinan period, prior  to the conquest of Mecca, Muhammad’s relationship to the Christians, whom he had long  regarded with sympathy, outlived his deteriorating relationship with the Jews. Watt even  suggests that some of the suras in the Qur’an that speak derogatorily about Christians and  Jews might originally have been exclusively aimed against the Jews, and only later amended  ccxciv to include hostile invective against Christianity.  It is not far fetched to argue that the more  favorable attitude towards Christians was mainly the result of their virtual absence in Medina.  They therefore could not challenge the leadership of Muhammad. Similarly, the Jews had  been regarded with sympathy as long Muhammad was still living far from them, in pagan  Mecca.  Upon the conquest of his hometown and the subsequent Battle of Hunayn, in which  Muhammad decisively defeated a large Bedouin tribe that had refused to submit to Islam, his  attitude towards Christians changed, as well. Muhammad’s plans to expand his empire to the  north were obstructed by a Byzantine resurgence along the route to Syria, where Muhammad  could not gain new adherents. Therefore, sura 9:29-35 commanded a new hostile policy  77    </page> <page sequence="80">    ccxcv towards Christians, which was to outlive the death of Muhammad.  Salafi scholars who try  to legitimize enmity between Muslims and mainstream society and to slam religions different  from Islam, extensively quote from sura 9 to this day. Sura 9:29, in particular, sanctions  violence against unbelievers:  Fight those who do not believe in Allah or in the Last Day and who do not consider unlawful  what Allah and His Messenger have made unlawful and who do not adopt the religion of truth  from those who were given the Scripture - [fight] until they give the jizyah willingly while they  are humbled.  The Medinan suras are replete with derogatory invective against Jews and Christians, and  provide legitimacy to the violent struggle against all unbelievers, including the “people of the  book”. Considering the history of early Islam and the link among the situation of the early  Muslim community, Muhammad’s policies, and the respective suras legitimizing them, we  can agree with Weil’s old insight that “Muhammad himself had not the remotest idea of  establishing a definite dogmatic structure” and “usually spoke only according to the  momentary pressure of his feelings”.ccxcvi  The Center for the Study of Political Islam (CSPI) has tried to trace these “momentary  pressures” throughout the lifetime of Muhammad and within the Qur’an, the hadith literature  and the sira (biography of the Prophet Muhammad) by quantitatively analyzing the themes  occurring in these writings. Unsurprisingly, the numbers correspond with what our  explications have suggested: According to the CSPI, 1% of the Meccan Qur’anic verses speak  ccxcvii negatively about the Jews while 17% of the Medinan do.  Similarly, while the Meccan  suras do not mention violent struggle, 24% of the Medinan suras are devoted to jihad and  ccxcviii violence against the infidels.  It should be noted that the meaning of jihad is, as are so  many concepts in Islam, ambiguous. As scholarly debate never tires of pointing out, the  Arabic root of jihad (j-h-d) refers to striving and effort, and does not necessarily imply  ccxcix violence.  The conceptualization of a greater jihad (al-jihad al-akbar) as a struggle against  78    </page> <page sequence="81">    the sinful self and a lesser jihad (al-jihad al-asghar) as actual holy war goes back to a  narration about the Prophet Muhammad, who after a military expedition told his followers  ccc that they had returned from the lesser jihad to the greater jihad.  Later scholars came to  denote these concepts as “jihad of the heart” and “jihad of the sword”, respectively, adding  others such as jihad of the tongue, of the heart and of money – all of which described efforts  ccci for the general betterment of the umma.  Nonetheless, the codification of jihad as a doctrine  th cccii fell to the later 8  century, the time of the great conquests of Islam,  which, according to  Lambton, “gave a psychological twist to Islamic thought, as a result of which the duty of  in the Traditions.”ccciiijihad [as violent struggle] was exalted  In line with this argument, the  ccciv CSPI study finds that only 2% of the hadiths in Sahih Bukhari  relate to the greater jihad,  cccv while 98% refer to the lesser jihad of violent struggle.  This places in an even more  significant light the fact that a total of 21% of the hadith literature and 67% of the sira, which  cccvi for the most part narrate the Medinan period, are concerned with jihad.   Modern day Salafi scholars trying to justify violence in the name of Islam invoke, for this  reason, those parts of the Qur’an and Sunna that were revealed in the Medinan period. Jihadi  preacher Abu Muhammad Al-Maqdisi, and the leader of the takeover of the Grand Mosque in  Mecca 1979, Juhayman Al-‘Utaybi, based their militant doctrine on the idea of millat  cccvii Ibrahim , which Muhammad had developed to justify enmity against Medina’s Jewish  tribes. In one example, Maqdisi quotes sura 60:4 to support his claim that Muslims had to  cccviii separate their lives from those of the kuffar and confront them with enmity:   “There has already been for you an excellent pattern in Abraham and those with him, when  they said to their people, ’Indeed, we are disassociated from you and from whatever you  worship other than Allah. We have denied you, and there has appeared between us and you  sity and hatred forever until you believe in Allah alone’ cccixanimo [...]"   79    </page> <page sequence="82">    Maqdisi, like Sayyid Qutb, Muhammad ‘Abd Al cccx-Salam Faraj  and many other jihadi  preachers, also uses sura 9:31, revealed later during the Medinan period against Jews and  cccxi Christians, to denounce modern state law as shirk:   „They have taken their scholars and monks as lords besides Allah, and [also] the Messiah,  the son of Mary. And they were not commanded except to worship one God; there is no deity  except Him. Exalted is He above whatever they associate with Him.”  Besides sura 9, Qutb and Faraj refer to sura 5:44, without adding much explanation, to  declare takfir over Muslim rulers:  Indeed, We sent down the Torah, in which was guidance and light. The prophets who  submitted [to Allah] judged by it for the Jews, as did the rabbis and scholars by that with  which they were entrusted of the Scripture of Allah, and they were witnesses thereto. So do  not fear the people but fear Me, and do not exchange My verses for a small price. And  whoever does not judge by what Allah has revealed - then it is those who are the disbelievers.  Even though there is a clear trend of Salafi and other Islamist scholars to base aggressive,  intolerant and militant political opinions on the Medinan period of the Quran and Sunna, and  a more moderate and benign stance on quotations from the Meccan period (or the very early  Medinan period), there are also contradictory examples. ‘Utaybi, in a prominent case in point,  built his concept of millat Ibrahim mainly on the two Meccan suras 16:123 and 6:161.  Naturally, ‘Utaybi can only use these earlier suras for his rebellion against the house of Saud  by extracting them from the historical context in which they were revealed, and at least  implicitly likening the Saudi rulers to pre-Islamic Arab pagans.  Conversely, sura 2:256 from the early Medinan period, which famously states “there is no  compulsion in religion”, is frequently cited whenever the tolerant side of Islam is to be  cccxii emphasized.  Despite these and similar overlaps of the character of Meccan and Medinan  texts, we can generally agree with Wiktorowicz’s opinion on the different content of both  periods, and thus their potential to legitimize Salafi political behavior today: “If, for example,  80    </page> <page sequence="83">    a scholar believes that the current context is analogous to the Meccan period [...] he will likely  argue that the focus of Islamic activism should be peaceful propagation [...] However, if the  scholar reasons that today is better compared to the Medinan period after the hijra (migration)  nclusions about Islamic activism will likely include more militant measures.”cccxiii[...] co   Since it is not our objective to discuss the development of the concept of jihad, legitimate  violence, or just war in Islamic doctrine, we may stop here and summarize what is relevant for  our goal of understanding the sources of religious legitimacy for the political behavior of  Salafism.    Meccan and Medinan Behavior  The doctrinal basis of Salafism is to be found in the Qur’an and the Sunna – the sayings of the  prophet Muhammad and the narrations of his life, respectively. All of the scriptures can be  divided into a Meccan and a Medinan period. These periods’ distinctive features derive from  the decisively different situation of Muhammad’s community (and its attitude toward the  pagans, Jews and Christians on the Arabian Peninsula), prior and subsequent to its migration  from Mecca to Medina. In Mecca, Muhammad and his followers were a small and, at times,  persecuted minority. Trying to proselytize to his own heathen community, and wary of  potentially crushing retribution, Muhammad refrained from violence, instead preaching  forbearance in the face of hardship. He had little contact with Jews and Christians, whom he  saw, overall, as being of the same ilk and sharing the same religion.  Upon emigration to Medina, Muhammad’s attitude toward other religions and toward  violence in the name of Islam changed dramatically. Violence was first granted legitimacy as  retribution for expulsion from Mecca, and then as an entirely offensive tactic in the name of  Islam. Similarly, the attitude toward polytheists, Christians and Jews became increasingly  hostile, to the point where pagans were ultimately only left the choice of submission to Islam  81    </page> <page sequence="84">    cccxiv or death, and Christians and Jews were only tolerated as inferior dhimmi,  or else as  people to be fought and killed.  Since Salafism is based on the religious sources, we can conceptualize Salafi behavior as  being rooted in the religious scriptures of either the Meccan or Medinan period, where Salafi  ideas find their expression. Reliance on texts from the Meccan period leads to non-violent,  peaceful self-restraint. In contrast, reliance on texts from the Medinan period leads to violent,  aggressive and offensive behavior. This understanding of the realization in behavior of Salafi  ideology takes into account that, to a certain extent, it must be a simplification of the actual,  historical behavior of Muhammad and his followers, insofar as it abstracts the extremes of  behavior of the early Islamic community, recognizing them as either Meccan conflict- abstemiousness or Medinan confrontation.    Answer to the First Research Question  Having conceptualized the theoretical aporia of Salafism as tawhid- and umma-themed, and  its behavior as Meccan or Medinan, we can now answer our first research question.  The tawhid-theme as a device of exclusion against Muslim competitors, and the umma-theme  as a device of inclusion and empowerment against a real or imagined non-Muslim adversary,  both refer to the same Islamic identity, framed in contradiction. This creates antagonism  within Islamic identity, which can be translated into antithetical objectives – of the Salafi  movement actors who are defined by this identity. The arbitrariness exercised in choosing the  religious sources on which to rely – and hence the means of reaching (antithetical) objectives  – provides additional grounds for disagreement on the Salafi code of conduct, even when  Salafis agree in principle on the objective of their action.      The Matrix Approach to Salafi Behavior  82    </page> <page sequence="85">    Religious purity in the name of tawhid, political utility in the name of the umma, Meccan  conflict-abstemiousness and Medinan confrontation – these are the cornerstones of Salafi  ideology. They constitute the link, peculiar to Salafism, between socio-political reality and  action in what we have earlier termed the triad of reality-ideology-action. Its master-frames –  tawhid and umma – are the principle rationales for Salafi activism that can lead to action in  either the Meccan- or the Medinan mode. Considering the functional significance of the  tawhid-theme, viz. exclusion, and of the umma-theme, viz. inclusion, on one hand and the  practical significance of the Meccan-mode, viz. moderation, and of the Medinan-mode, viz.  confrontation, on the other, we derive a matrix with tawhid and umma as rationales for action  and a Meccan- and Medinan mode of action, which we will call the Matrix of Salafi  cccxv Reasoning  (MSR). It is shown in Tab. 4.  This matrix exhibits four types of Salafi behavior, which we will call Meccan Exclusion,  Meccan Inclusion, Medinan Exclusion, and Medinan Inclusion. To understand the actual  meaning of this typology it is necessary to recall that it merely describes the way in which  Salafi ideology frames a certain reality and presents an appropriate course of action.

Tab. 5 shows how the MSR delineates the limits of framing in  Salafi ideology, and thus the limits of Salafi perception of reality.

MSR versus Categorizing Approaches    In his contribution to Meijer’s study of Salafism as a global movement, Hegghammer has  critiqued much of the previous scholarly attempts to understand Islamism, in general  (including Salafism): He claims these are based on what he calls “preference based terms”,  84    Confrontation  </page> <page sequence="87">    cccxvi and summarizes the most prominent views put forth by scholars:  Kepel differentiated  between a a) gradualist approach, used by the Muslim Brotherhood; b) a Bolshevik-style  organization like the Egyptian Islamic Jihad (EIJ); and c) isolationist groups like the Jamaa  Muslimin, which are often referred to as “Takfir wa Hijra”.cccxviiAl- -l-  Similarly, Dekmeijan  differentiated among a) gradualist pragmatic, b) revolutionary, and c) messianic-puritanical  cccxviii approaches.  Rubin, introducing the rationale of “national liberation” into the typology,  cccxix suggested a) revolutionary, b) national liberationist, and c) reformist approaches,  while  Gerges and others distinguished a) irredentist movements like Hamas, which seek local  independence; b) revolutionary groups like the EIJ, which fight a domestic regime; and,  cccxx finally, c) global jihad groups like AQ.  But the categorization of Salafism that is perhaps  best-known stems from Wiktorowicz, and categorizes purist-, politico- and jihadi-types of  cccxxi Salafis.   Hegghammer has rightfully argued, “All these typologies are problematic, either because they  are inconsistent — mixing means (e.g., violence / engagement / separation) and objectives  (e.g., national liberation / regime change / increased social conservatism) — or because they  are incomplete — omitting prominent forms of Islamist militancy such as sectarian  violence.”cccxxii He contrasts these preference-based approaches with his own rationale-based  classification of Islamism, and names five rationales that would explain why Islamists act in  the mid-term: a) state-oriented Islamists try to change the social and political order of a state;  b) nation-oriented Islamists aim to establish their rule over a territory that is dominated by  non-Muslims; c) umma-oriented Islamists try to protect the whole Islamic nation from outside  threats; d) morality-oriented Islamists strive for different social conduct of the Muslim  population; and e) Islamists with a sectarian agenda want to reduce the influence of a  competing sect. Hegghammer then distinguishes these groups as being either of a violent or a  cccxxiii non-violent form.  Even though Hegghammer’s classification of Islamist groups and  movements helps clarify the agenda of an Islamist (or, specifically, Salafi) group, it does so  85    </page> <page sequence="88">    by multiplying the number of categories rather than by questioning the categorizations of the  preference-based approach itself. Hegghammer concedes that most groups have multiple  rationales. However, to fit his categorization, he has to focus on a respective group’s “most  urgent threat” as the dominant rationale for its activism.cccxxiv By this method, however, the  multitude of differing and at times competing Salafi factions cannot be accounted for; neither  can attitudinal changes within a group be traced. Yet another problem is posed by  Hegghammer’s focus on one dominant rationale, when groups with various dominant  rationales (state, nation, umma, morality, sectarianism) should be scrutinized from a  comparative perspective regarding a specific issue. Since groups are perceived through their  dominant rationale, every other rationale of such a group necessarily remains  underappreciated; this can lead to a biased research focus, especially when a group’s  dominant rationale only barely trumps its other important concerns. The first step to a more  accurate understanding of the various motivating factors of Salafi groups would be to refrain  from categorization altogether.  Since the entire Salafi movement is based on the same ideology, the matrix approach, with its  four ideal-type Salafi interpretations of reality, can be applied across the analytical spectrum,  from the micro- to the macro-level. The matrix approach is thus pertinent well beyond a  categorization of Salafi factions. It posits the extremes of rationale and conduct in Salafism as  the legitimating ideology for action, and can therefore be applied on the individual level, the  group level and even the movement level. Indeed, also the MSR could be used to construe the  typical behavior of individuals and groups by focusing on their respective dominant rationale  and code of conduct Like all the other categorizing approaches, the MSR would then construe  four ideal-type factions of Salafism, each of which would be dominated by moderate  exclusionary behavior (Meccan Exclusion), moderate inclusionary behavior (Medinan  Inclusion), confrontational exclusionary behavior (Medinan Exclusion) or confrontational  inclusionary behavior (Medinan Inclusion). These four ideal types of faction could then be  86    </page> <page sequence="89">    characterized as follows: Meccan Exclusion factions principally reject violence, but also try,  to the extent possible, to shut themselves off from mainstream society and other Muslim  organizations. Their behavior is therefore generally non-cooperative. Meccan Inclusion  factions exhibit a maximum measure of tolerance and openness towards other Muslim  organizations, and try to keep in touch with mainstream society by participating in inter-faith  events and community outreach programs and by maintaining a general open-door policy,  aiming for acceptance within society and a growing measure of financial support and  influence to pursue the movement’s goals. For the same reason, they take a cooperative stance  towards other Salafi Movement organizations. Medinan Exclusivists are generally non- cooperative and approve of violence to further their goals. Their typical behavior is  vigilantism and aggressive campaigns against intra-movement competitors. Finally, Medinan  Inclusion factions focus their efforts on fighting outside enemies, typically by using violent  means to combat whomever they perceive to be an enemy of the umma. AQ ideologue Abu  Musab Al-Suri is an extreme example of a leader of this latter type of Salafi faction: He  focuses on the “infidel powers” of the West (which threaten the whole umma), and has little  understanding of the intra-movement strife caused by doctrinal disputes. In MSR terms, we  would say that Al-Suri is opposed, in particular, to the Medinan Exclusion trend in the jihadi  cccxxv current.   However, using this approach to categorize the Salafi movement within the framework  provided by the MSR would only repeat the mistake of oversimplifying the complexities of  Salafi activism by narrowly focusing on one outstanding feature of a group (or network),  instead of analyzing all aspects of the group’s rationale and mode of action. Instead, the  matrix approach caters to detailed analysis by providing a framework for analyzing the  political preferences of Salafi actors – not only their overall attitude but also their stance  regarding well-defined questions such as: What is the attitude towards the non-Muslim  mainstream? What do they say about non-Salafi Muslim organizations? What is their take on  87    </page> <page sequence="90">    different forms of violence in a range of scenarios, e.g. Taliban insurgents in Afghanistan,  cccxxvi Hamas in Israel, attacks against military targets vs. attacks against civilians,  and attacks  against domestic targets vs. attacks in theatres of jihad? The MSR approach is not simply  rationale-oriented, nor is it preference-based in the sense that Hegghammer has critiqued.  Rather, it combines the features of both, inasmuch it considers the rationales and modes of  action that underlie Salafi ideology as a whole. This it does in order to understand the political  preference(s) of a Salafi actor regarding a specific problem, thereby facilitating an analysis of  the internal attitudinal structure of individuals, groups and movements within Salafism.  Additionally, it offers the possibility of comparing the reaction of different groups to an  identical question (e.g., approval of violence against Western army personnel in Afghanistan).  Thus, by enabling us to analyze an individual or group’s arguments regarding a specific  question and to determine into which of the four main Salafi interpretations posited by the  MSR it falls, the matrix gives us the ability to trace developments within a movement, group  and even within an individual Salafi.  The MSR approach can also be applied to peruse important Salafi fatwas, such as the  collection of opinions of Saudi scholars Shaikh Bin Baz and Shaikh Uthaymeen regarding the  cccxxvii life of Muslim minorities in the West.  Instead of trying to affix labels to both scholars’  ideas such as “Mainstream Salafism” or “Purist Salafism,” the MSR helps us identify what  kind of behavior they see favorably in a specific situation. For example, we find that both  advocate Meccan-Exclusive behavior when it comes to relations between Muslim minorities  cccxxviii and non-Muslims. Specifically, Bin Baz advises against marrying a non-Muslim  and  cccxxix stresses that mixed education is forbidden,  while Uthaymeen states that Muslims should  cccxxx have no job rather than being exposed to co-workers of the opposite sex.   Similarly,  “imitation of both West and East is not permissible for Muslim women nor for Muslim men”  cccxxxi in dress or behavior.  Yet both scholars stress that, despite seeking seclusion from non- Muslims, Muslim minorities should maintain benevolent relations with mainstream  88    </page> <page sequence="91">    cccxxxii Muslims do not “cause harm or are oppressive,”cccxxxiiisociety,  as long as the non-   because “this is what will lead them to give importance and embrace Islaam and to prefer it to  their falsehood, idolatry, Christianity and so forth”.cccxxxiv Conversely, whereas “rashness,  especially in non-Muslim countries might attract people’s attention and put an end to the  propagation of Islam.”cccxxxv  Nonetheless, the sheikhs’ emphasis on Meccan Exclusion, for the purpose of insulating  Muslim minorities from non-Muslims, does not foreclose Medinan behavior under certain  – cccxxxvicircumstances  as they betray in a passage on the virtue of jihad.   89    </page> <page sequence="92">    MSR from a National Security Perspective  Upon reviewing the meaning of every square of the MSR, we find that one of them seems to  stand out as being less applicable in a typology of Salafi groups. Meccan Inclusion is a  pragmatic stance, marked by a certain measure of tolerance for the sake of political utility.  Medinan Exclusion means an offensive stance on doctrinal purity, and Medinan Inclusion  denotes aggressive behavior that is directed against the outer enemy, with a certain level of  tolerance for doctrinal deviation within the movement. All three behavioral types include an  offensive element, as can be seen in Tab.6: Medinan Exclusion struggles against intra- movement competition, Meccan Inclusion non-violently expands its power through  cooperation and acceptance-building measures, and Medinan Inclusion unites against the  outer enemy. Compared to these three types, Meccan Exclusion appears entirely defensive. It  neither attempts to draw strength from cooperation with other Muslim groups nor challenges  these groups by openly attacking them as infidels. Meccan Exclusion shares with Meccan  Inclusion a disapproval of violence. However, Meccan Inclusion empowers a group through  cooperation in the name of the umma. Meccan Exclusion, furthermore, shares with Medinan  Exclusion a sectarian tendency, but without the aggressive means that might empower a Salafi  group at the expense of other Muslim groups by intimidating them and recruiting their  members. Finally, Meccan Exclusion is entirely contrary to Medinan Inclusion, which we can  describe as militant Salafism that derives a measure of internal tolerance from the act of  uniting against enemies of the umma. This focus on a common enemy makes it resistant to  internal fissures; its Medinan stance justifies the use of violence.  From a counterterrorist perspective, Medinan Inclusion is consequently the least preferable  behavior: a united Salafi group willing to fight. In contrast, Meccan Exclusion, from a  counterterrorist perspective, is the most preferable ideal-type behavior for a Salafi group. It  rejects violence as well as cooperation with other Muslim groups, thereby marginalizing itself  without posing much of a risk to society. Naturally, this is also the behavior that Salafi groups  90    </page> <page sequence="93">    try to avoid: In fact, it is the behavior that is forced upon them in cases of weakness, when it  must compete with other groups or, conversely, when there is a lack of groups or of Muslims  with whom to cooperate under the uniting umma-label. As for Medinan Exclusion and  Meccan Inclusion, from a national-security point of view, both types of behavior have an  advantage and a disadvantage. Medinan Exclusion is offensive and potentially aggressive  against other Muslim groups and the non-Muslim mainstream, but since its sectarian character  inhibits coalition-building with other militant groups, it limits the power base and influence of  a group in the long run. Meccan Inclusion eschews the open use of violence, but can use its  pragmatic stance to increase its powerbase, thereby mustering organizational capabilities that  pose a risk of indoctrinating a greater number of individuals, out of which future jihadis might  eventually emerge. A great measure of Meccan Inclusion is therefore typical for what  Neumann has termed “gateway organizations,” which “prepare individuals ideologically and  socialise them into the extremist ‘milieu’.”cccxxxvii  As this section has shown, the MSR helps us identify four tendencies within Salafi ideology,  which intersect each other. The tawhid-theme constitutes a centrifugal trend within the Salafi  movement, which can cause internal strife and inhibit cooperation. Conversely, the umma- theme represents a centripetal trend within the Salafi movement. The Meccan and Medinan  mode describe the conflict-abstemious and the violent trend within Salafism. The more the  Salafi movement is caused to focus on the tawhid-theme, the more internal conflicts will  occur; and the more the Salafi movement is caused to behave according to the Meccan mode,  the less opportunity it will have to increase its membership at the expense of other, more  moderate Muslim groups. It should therefore be in the interest of state security agencies to  encourage the defensive, centrifugal trend within the Salafi movement, in order to discourage  violence and inhibit the growth of Salafi infrastructure and movement capabilities.

With it, we can understand how Salafi ideology offers flexible, interpretative frames  which a Salafi actor uses to identify a given reality as an analogy to the Islamic past, and  draws conclusions about his actions accordingly. The centrifugal trend of the Salafi  movement, rooted in the exclusionary character of the tawhid-theme, causes movement rifts,  while the centripetal trend, deriving from the inclusionary character of the umma-theme,  supports movement cohesion. The multitude of competing sects falling under the label of  Salafism are not to be conceptualized in terms of a categorical typology, but as a matrix of  Salafi reasoning that is applicable to the varying circumstances to which a Salafi actor is  exposed and that defines that actor’s possibilities of behavior.    92    Mode of Action  Confrontation Moderation  Defensive trend Offensive trend    </page> <page sequence="95">    The third and final part of this paper will utilize Social Movement Theory and the Matrix of  Salafi Reasoning to examine the Salafi movement in Germany. As outlined in the study  design, this examination aims to study the broadest possible range of Salafi behavior.  Therefore, the following analysis does not claim to study all German Salafi actors, nor does it  attempt to consider the most important ones (which renders unnecessary the creation of an  index of what counts as “important” for the purpose of analysis). Instead, a short introduction  will be provided to Germany’s Salafi scene, focusing on its rapid development during the past  decade. Subsequently, a sample of seven Salafi actors will be analyzed according to a set of  narrowly-defined questions regarding their take on a number of domestic and international  issues.  In this way, the MSR will prove its proclaimed functionality for scrutinizing the attitude of  Salafi actors. It will also deliver an answer to the third and final research question.  93    </page> <page sequence="96">    II  The Salafi Movement in Germany    Only ten years ago, it would have been odd to speak about Salafism in Germany as a  movement. There were Salafi groups and preachers, but only a few, and they were not yet  able to reach out and attract a larger audience. This has changed. Within less than a decade,  Germany has seen the speedy growth of new Salafi groups, the multiplication of Salafi  preachers, and the spread of Salafi ideas to a growing number of German mosques. The  variety of Salafi public events has increased to a point where meetings, talks and weekend  seminars are held regularly throughout the country, including nationwide gatherings with  several hundred participants. A rally in Frankfurt in 2011 even assembled close to 2,000  cccxxxviii participants.  Apart from physical meetings, the Internet has also proven its significance  as a major means of communication and propaganda for German Salafis. Numerous German- language websites provide digital recordings of past events for consumption at home. Salafi  forums provide a means for active participation in ongoing debates, which range from  religious advice on dietary issues to political discussions and calls to militant jihad. The State  Office for the Protection of the Constitution Baden Wurttemberg notes in its annual report  that “Salafi currents are the Islamist movement that grows the strongest”, going on to say that  “the number of dawa activists from different clubs, who appear in public, is steadily  increasing.”cccxxxix The Salafi milieu in Germany has developed from a socio-religious niche  into an active movement with a strong appeal to a growing minority of young German  Muslims. The following will present this movement and a selection of its actors.  94    </page> <page sequence="97">    Salafi groups in Germany primarily address a Muslim audience. While it is true that Salafi  online propaganda is available to everyone, and that courses exist offering instruction on how  cccxl to proselytize to atheists and Christians,  it nonetheless appears that it is much easier for  the Salafi movement to approach Muslims, for two obvious reasons. Firstly, because they  share the same Muslim socio-religious identity, the Salafi claim of preaching a purer creed,  the “true Islam,” is likelier to catch on amongst those for whom Islam is already a part of their  lives. Secondly, much real-life Salafi agitation (as opposed to Internet propaganda) takes  place in mosques, where most of those present are Muslims. The Salafis claim that all other  currents within Islam are somehow inferior in their worship of Allah – if they can be  considered Muslim at all. This being the case, relations between the Salafi movement and  other Islamic and Islamist organizations in Germany are ambivalent at best. There is plenty of  cooperation and competition among different groups and networks, which decisively  influence the political opportunity of Salafism, shape its mobilizing structures and provide or  withhold resources. For these reasons, it seems beneficial to provide a short overview of  Germany’s Muslim population and major Islamic organizations before proceeding to discuss  the development of Salafism in Germany. This discussion aims to achieve two objectives: 1)  to summarize the major Salafi actors in Germany and their relations within the Salafi  movement, whereby some Salafi groups that are important to the jihadi fringe of the Salafi  cccxli movement had to be neglected,  just as all developments after January 2012 had to be left  unconsidered. 2) This overview will provide the pool of data from which the next chapter will  select three Salafi groups for analysis according to the SMT-MSR approach.      The Landscape of Islamism and Salafism in Germany    cccxlii German Muslim and Islamist Organizations   95    </page> <page sequence="98">    Almost all (98%) of the Muslims in Germany live in the states of the former West German  cccxliii Republic and Berlin.  The state that is home to the largest number of Muslims is North- Rhine Westphalia, with 33.1% of Germany’s total Muslim population. It is followed by  cccxliv Baden Wurttemberg (16.6%), Bavaria (13.2%), and Hesse (10.3%).   The reason for the concentration of Muslim communities in the west of Germany and for the  predominance of Muslims with a Turkish background in these communities dates back to the  1950s and 1960s, when the West German government signed so-called “Anwerbeverträge”  (recruitment agreements) with foreign countries in an effort to replenish the German work  force, which at the time was in urgent need of skilled labor.  After the arrival of Muslim migrant workers and their families, the next group of Muslims  who migrated to Germany arrived beginning in the mid-1970s, as refugees. Most of them  came from Lebanon, Iran, and Afghanistan. Since the disintegration of Yugoslavia in the mid- 1990s, residents of Bosnia-Herzegovina and Kosovo have also emigrated to Germany. Many  of these people decided to stay in Germany permanently, to avoid the politically unstable  cccxlv conditions and crises plaguing the countries they came from.  In the 1980s, the Soviet- aligned government of the German Democratic Republic (GDR) decided to allow refugees to  arrive through Berlin-Schönefeld airport, calculating that new arrivals would continue to the  West German part of the city, causing economic problems for its Cold War competitor.  Indeed, West Berlin became the main destination for Mideast refugees entering  cccxlvi Germany.  This accounts for the greater proportion of Palestinian and Lebanese Arabs in  today’s capital than in the rest of the country.  Another group of Muslim immigrants came to Germany to study. Even though there are no  exact figures on Muslim students in Germany, it is known that students and scholars from  Muslim countries have been the most active in establishing Islamic centers around the  foundations of much of today’s Muslim community infrastructure.cccxlviicountry, laying the   96    </page> <page sequence="99">    The influx of immigrants and their decision to stay in Germany has not only helped the  German economy; it has also raised the issue of integration, as has been discussed in a  cccxlviii number of studies.  What is relevant for the following analysis of Salafi actors in  cccxlix Germany is the limited degree of formal organization within the Muslim community,  and  the prevalence of Islamist ideas amongst a significant portion of German Muslims, especially  cccl those organized in Islamic NGOs.  Islamist influence can also be seen within a number of  major Muslim associations in Germany.  There are five Muslim umbrella organizations in Germany, independent of one another: The  Turkish-Islamic Union for Religious Affairs (DITIB); the Federation of Alevi Communities  in Germany (AABF); the Islamic Council for the Federal Republic of Germany (IRD); the  Association of Islamic Cultural Centers (VIKZ); and the Central Council for Muslims in  Germany (ZMD). Three of these five organizations are heavily influenced, if not controlled,  by Islamist actors.  The IRD is dominated by its largest member organization, the Islamic Community Millî  Görüş  (IGMG), which is also the largest Islamist organization in Germany overall. The VIKZ  cccli has repeatedly been accused of promoting anti-democratic ideology.  The ZMD is a  platform for several important Islamist organizations in Germany, most notably the  “Islamische Gemeinschaft Deutschland” (Islamic Community Germany, IGD) and the Islamic  Center Hamburg (IZH). The IGD is the main representative of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB)  in Germany. A number of other organizations associated with the MB are also organized  ccclii under the umbrella of the ZMD.  The IZH, however, is controlled by the Iranian Islamic  Republic. The head of the IZH, currently Dr. Reza Ramezani, is regularly appointed by the  Iranian foreign ministry and serves as the official representative of Iran’s Supreme Leader in  Europe. The IZH is also a meeting point for Hizbullah members in Germany. It dominates  Germany’s Shiite community.cccliii  97    </page> <page sequence="100">    In 2007, the VIKZ, DITIB, ZMD and IRD jointly established the Coordination Council of  Muslims in Germany (KRM), which claims to represent the majority of Sunni and Shiite  cccliv Muslims living in Germany and is striving to become a centralized contact for the state.   Judging by its membership, the KRM is also strongly influenced by Islamist actors. On the  other hand, the majority of German Muslims seem not to have taken notice of the KRM.  According to the MLD study, less than 10% of Germany’s Muslims have even heard of the  KRM. Of them, almost 60% report not feeling represented at all by Germany’s newest and  ccclv largest Muslim umbrella organization.   Unfortunately, there is no reliable data on the size of the Salafi scene in Germany. This is a  major weakness of the BAMF’s MLD study, which lacks any data on Salafis in Germany and  disregards the issue of converts to Islam. A slightly dated estimate puts the number of German  ccclvi converts between 10,000-100,000 in total,  while a more recent report claims there are  ccclvii 40,000-60,000 converts to Islam in Germany.  Regarding the number of Salafis, an  ccclviii official report of the BfV from 2012 puts the number of Salafis in Germany at 3,800 ;  ccclix another estimate speaks of 4,000-5,000.      Nascent Stage of Salafism until 2005  Until the beginning of the new millennium, Salafism in Germany was limited in scope and  confined to regional activities, mostly within the Arab-Muslim community, where, as we have  seen, the Salafi ideology originally emerged. Not long ago, prayers and sermons were almost  exclusively held in Arabic. Only a few websites in German were online, their readership  limited.  Reflecting the overall distribution of Muslim communities in Germany, Salafi groups mostly  started to develop in the former West Germany and Berlin. The founding members and  leaders of these early associations and mosques were mostly seasoned, Arab-born men, in  98    </page> <page sequence="101">    some cases students from Arab countries studying in Germany. Many of them had been active  ccclx in the Muslim Brotherhood or Salafi organizations of their home countries.   By far, not all of the Muslim organizations that would become important for the emergence of  a German Salafi movement were Salafi organizations themselves. However, the proximity of  Salafism to other Islamist movements like the Muslim Brotherhood makes it no surprise that  many German Salafi activists started their careers in these older organizations. This also  explains the ease with which some of the institutions discussed herein became increasingly  influenced, if not dominated, by Salafism.  One such center is the Islamic Center Aachen, which was founded by members of the Syrian  Muslim Brotherhood but subsequently also played a role in educating a new generation of  German Salafi activists. The Multi-Cultural House and Hamburg’s Al-Quds Mosque were  Germany’s first large centers of Salafi jihadism to produce numerous militants. Salafi  activists in Berlin, Leipzig, Bonn and Brunswick, in particular, provided the basis for a still- growing network of Salafi organizations in Germany.    Islamic Center Aachen  The origin of the Islamic Center of Aachen dates back to the 1960s. A group of Arab students  from the local Technical University had organized into the “Internationale Muslimische  Studenten Union e.V.” (International Muslim Student Union, IMSU). The IMSU oversaw the  construction of the “Bilal Mosque” from 1964 until its completion 1968. From early on, the  mosque project gained support from the university, which offered a parcel of its property as  the site. These ties to the university made for a membership base dominated by Muslims with  ccclxi an academic background, some of whom are lecturers at the university.  The project,  which cost about 800,000 Deutschmarks at the time (app. €400,000), was mostly financed by  private donations from Muslim countries, which members of the IMSU raised during their  semester breaks. The state of North Rhine-Westphalia helped by selling the property for a  99    </page> <page sequence="102">    symbolic 10,000 Deutschmarks, and the municipality of Aachen helped by giving a donation  that equaled the price of the property. The Saudi Arabian Ministry of Islamic Affairs  ccclxii contributed the carpets.   In 1978, a new association was officially registered as the legal body responsible for the  mosque and its activities: the “Islamisches Zentrum Aachen e.V.” (Islamic Center Aachen,  ccclxiii IZA).  Under its auspices, in 1979-80 the Bilal Mosque building was enlarged to  ccclxiv accommodate 600 worshippers.   The chairman of the IZA was Dr. Issam Al-Attar, the former head of the Syrian Muslim  Brotherhood. Under Al-Attar’s leadership, the mosque became the European headquarters for  the Syrian MB, which at the time was fighting the Syrian regime under Hafiz Al-Assad,  bringing the country to the brink of civil war. Many commentators saw the IZA as the  command center in exile of this insurgency. Syrian secret services targeted several of its  Attar’s wife, who was killed March 1981 in Aachen ccclxvmembers, including Al- .  The IZA  ccclxvi states it is a member of the Muslim World League (MWL),  a large Saudi NGO that has  ccclxvii repeatedly been involved in financing terrorist organizations.  The IZA’s most prominent  member is Dr. Nadeem Elyas, a Saudi gynecologist who came to Germany in 1964 to  ccclxviii complete his medical studies.  He was member of the IGD, the previously-mentioned  front organization of the Muslim Brotherhood, before joining the IZA, which maintained a  close relationship to its affiliate organization in Munich. In 1994, both groups were founding  members of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany (ZMD), for which Dr. Elyas served  as chairman until 2006. He still plays an important role as liaison to the MWL and other Saudi  ccclxix organizations.   The roots of the IZA in the Muslim Brotherhood (MB) and in Saudi institutions reflect the  alliance between Saudi Wahhabism and members of the MB who had fled Nasser’s  ccclxx Egypt.  Even though not dominated by Salafi ideas, because of its ties to Saudi Arabia and  100    </page> <page sequence="103">    its ideological proximity to Salafism, the IZA became a platform for activists in the later  Salafi movement in Germany.    Multi-Cultural House and Islamic Information Center  One of these activists is David Mitterhuber. After graduating from high school in 2000, the  young convert went to Saudi Arabia to study Arabic and Sharia law at the Islamic University  of Medina. Upon his return in 2003, he enrolled in the Academy for Islamic Studies in  Aachen, which runs its courses in the facilities of the IZA. Mitterhuber sat on the board of the  Islamic Information Center (IIZ), which was founded 1999 in South-Germany’s Ulm in  close  ccclxxi association with the Multi-Cultural House (MKH) in neighboring Neu-Ulm.  Mitterhuber  and another IIZ board member, Ahmed Ateia, are responsible for the translation  of several  ccclxxii Saudi publications into German.   The MKH and IIZ were the first and most prominent centers of the fledgling German Salafi  scene. The MKH, founded in 1996, featured two Egyptian expatriates who shaped its  ideological outlook: founding member Dr. Adly el-Attar, also member of the Egyptian Salafi  group Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiyya, and Dr. Yahia Yusuf, allegedly a former member of the  ccclxxiii EIJ.  The many high-profile ties of the MKH to militant Islamists in virtually all arenas  ccclxxiv of global jihad have been discussed elsewhere.  However, close ties to AQ and its  affiliates is by no means characteristic of the majority of today’s Salafi community in  Germany. On the other hand, many those Salafi preachers who today speak out against  terrorist attacks were once in contact with the more violent milieu in Ulm and Neu-Ulm.  German security officials described the inner circle of the MKH as holding “a hostile,  aggressive attitude towards democracy, the Jewish people and generally the whole Western  hemisphere.”ccclxxv Salafi ideology, promotion of militant jihad and direct contact with  veterans of jihad made the scene around the MKH a hotbed of recruitment of young Muslims  to armed struggle abroad. Several of the MKH went to fight in Chechnya, Bosnia- 101    </page> <page sequence="104">    Herzegovina, Pakistan and Afghanistan. Two protagonists of Germany’s first large-scale  ccclxxvi homegrown terrorism plot also came from the MKH and IIZ.  Both groups were shut  down in 2005 and 2007, respectively.    The Al-Quds Mosque and the Hamburg Milieu    Another well-known center of radicalization and militant recruitment was the Al-Quds  Mosque in Hamburg. It was founded as “Arabischer Kulturverein e.V. Masjid Al-Kods”  (Arabic Culture Club Masjid Al-Quds) in March 1993. Its founding members were  established middle-class men of Arab descent. The first chairman of the mosque and cultural  association was Salah Ben Bouchaib Anour, born in 1948 in Morocco and employed as a  dispatch manager. His deputy was an hotelier, Mohamed Jaoudat, also of Moroccan origin,  ccclxxvii who was born in Casablanca in 1950.   The Al-Quds Mosque quickly became a hotspot for Salafi radicalization and jihadi  recruitment. Apart from the members of the 9/11 Hamburg Cell who frequented the mosque,  the most prominent members were two men of Syrian origin, Mamoun Darkazanli and  Mohammed Haydar Zammar. Darkazanli, born in 1958 in Damascus and also a member of  the Syrian MB, entered Germany in 1983 and became naturalized in 1990. He served as the  ccclxxviii Imam of the Al-Quds Mosque for a few years until its closure in 2010.  Darkazanli  worked for the Hamburg-based “Tatex Trading Company”, which was known to be involved  with Syrian intelligence and which probably tried to keep a close watch on Syrian Islamists  ccclxxix living in Hamburg.  Darkazanli was first scrutinized in 1993 after a person with a false  passport and counterfeit money was arrested in Africa carrying Darkazanli’s telephone  number. The FBI became interested in him after it found out that his number also appeared in  the address books of two men convicted of the US Embassy bombings in East Africa in  ccclxxx 1998.  Darkazanli was acquainted with the members of the Hamburg cell, and is alleged  102    </page> <page sequence="105">    ccclxxxi to have helped finance the 9/11 plot. Following the Madrid train bombings in 2004,  the  Spanish authorities requested Darkazanli’s extradition and charged him with providing  logistical and financial support to AQ since 1997 in Spain, Germany and the UK. They  further claimed that Darkazanli was the constant interlocutor and assistant of Osama bin  Laden in Germany. Darkazanli appealed his detention following the extradition request, and  was released in July 2005 when the German Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the arrest  ccclxxxii warrant violated German law.   The second prominent AQ figure at the Al-Quds Mosque was Mohammed Haydar Zammar.  Born into a religiously conservative family in Aleppo, Syria in 1961, he moved with his father  to Hamburg in 1971. After dropping out of school, he began training to be a metalworker, but  subsequently could not find a job. He became a regular visitor at Hamburg’s Imam Ali  Mosque and Muhadjirin Mosque. When still in his teens he met Darkazanli, and entered the  milieu of radical Muslims in Hamburg. In 1982 he waived his Syrian citizenship and became  a German national. During the mid-1980s he lived and worked in Saudi Arabia before  returning to Germany to make his living as a truck driver. In 1991, Zammar travelled for the  first time to Afghanistan, where he was assigned to an elite camp near Jalalabad and fought  alongside the leader of the militant Hizb-i-Islami group, Gulbuddin Hekmatyar. Inspired by  the jihadi propaganda videos that were freely distributed in Hamburg during the 1990s,  Zammar went to Afghanistan a second time in the summer of 1995 and, after a short return to  Germany, subsequently decided to fight in Bosnia with other Arab militants. In 1996 he  formally pledged allegiance to AQ. Zammar not only provided financial support to AQ in  Afghanistan, but also became a recruiter for AQ in Hamburg. Amongst his disciples were  Mohammad Atta, Ramzi Binalshibh, Marwan Al-Shehhi and Said Bahaji – all of them  members of the 9/11 Hamburg Cell and three of them pilots. Zammar was acquainted with  other German jihadis, as well. After flying to Morocco in 2001 to pay a visit to the family of  Mounir Al-Motassadeq  (an aide to the 9/11 cell), Zammar was arrested by domestic secret  103    </page> <page sequence="106">    service, handed over to the CIA and then transferred to Syria, where he has been held ever  ccclxxxiii since.   The history of the 9/11 attacks and their connection to Germany’s jihadi Salafi milieu has  ccclxxxiv been studied in great detail and will not be repeated here.  Suffice it to point out that by  the 1990s, such a Salafi jihadi milieu had developed in Hamburg, and centered on the Al- ccclxxxv Quds Mosque and other, private meeting venues.   Between 1999 and 2000, another  radical preacher from Morocco frequently appeared at the Al-Quds Mosque: Muhammad el- Fazazi called on his audience to “remove the infidels from power, kill their children, capture  their women and destroy their houses.” Back in Morocco he was jailed and made headlines  again, when he wrote a letter from prison calling on German Muslims to renounce  ccclxxxvi violence.  The Salafi milieu in Hamburg, nonetheless, continued to spawn jihadi  militants. While the recruitment of young German Muslims for jihad rose sharply around the  middle of the past decade, Hamburg was one of the early centers of Salafi radicalization and  propaganda for jihad; another was Berlin.    Al-Nur Mosque, Berlin and the Leipzig connection  For years, the Al-Nur Mosque in Neukölln has made headlines as a center of Salafism in the  German capital. A comparably old Muslim association runs the mosque: The “Islamische  Gemeinschaft in Berlin e.V.” (“Islamic Community in Berlin,” IGB), officially registered in  January 1986. Its chairman, Dr. Hamad Izzeldine, a Sudanese born in 1949, has served the  association in this capacity since its founding. During the 1990s, the IGB established its first,  modest “Al-Nur” prayer rooms in Glasower Street. Soon it attracted the attention of Saudi  diplomats, who saw the potential of turning the community into a center of Wahhabi  proselytization. It seems the first to consider turning the Al-Nur Mosque into a large center  was Ahmad Al-Dubayan, who at the time was working as the equivalent of a cultural attaché  at the Saudi embassy in Berlin. Even after leaving this position and resettling in London in  104    </page> <page sequence="107">    2000, he retained his diplomatic credentials for nearly three more years, becoming a mentor to  his successor, Mohammed Jaber Fakihi, with whom he maintained frequent contact. Fakihi, a  Saudi national born in 1970 or 1971, entered office in June 2000. He adopted Dubayan’s idea  of expanding the Al-Nur Mosque and, with Dubayan’s help, contacted a number of Saudi  ccclxxxvii government officials.  In one letter to the then-Saudi Minister of Islamic Affairs, Saleh  bin Abdulaziz Al-Ashaikh, he explained his plans to use the Al-Nur Mosque as a center of  Islamic missionary work for ethnic Europeans in Eastern Europe – specifically Poland, the  Czech Republic and Hungary. Fakihi recommended purchasing real estate for the center, as  “property ownership is more secure, and offers greater guarantees should it come to a conflict  between Muslims and the others.”ccclxxxviii  The request must have fallen on sympathetic ears. The notorious Saudi Al-Haramain  Foundation promised to contribute 75% of the funds necessary for a new mosque. Soon an  appropriate plot of land had been found at 3 Haber Street. The founder and director of the Al- Haramain Foundation, Aqil Abdulaziz Al-Aqil, together with two Lebanese nationals – Dr.  Salem Abdul Ghani el-Rafei and Dr. Kamal Rafehi. El-Rafei – founded  “Grundstücksverwaltungsgesellschaft Haberstraße 3” (“3 Haber Street Real Estate  Administration Company”), which bought the property for 2.375 million Deutschmark. Dr.  Kamal Rafehi, who has close ties with the Lebanese Muslim Brotherhood, came to Germany  in 1985. He first lived in Dusseldorf, then moved to Berlin in 1992. All the while, German  ccclxxxix authorities were monitoring his contact with the Islamist milieu.   The building at 3 Haber Street was renovated and turned into a mosque with a separate prayer  room for women, a shop, a library, a hairdresser’s and a café. El-Rafei became the imam of  the mosque, while the IGB headed by Izzeldine officially ran the facility. Up to 1,200  Muslims attend Friday prayers at the mosque, many of them Palestinian Arabs. In his  sermons, El-Rafei openly supported Palestinian suicide attacks, and called on Muslims to kill  105    </page> <page sequence="108">    all unbelievers and kings standing in the way of Islam. Meanwhile, Fakihi, his friend at the  cccxc Saudi embassy, buttressed global jihad with more than just words.   Within two years, Fakihi had raised about $800,000 for militant jihadis while keeping in close  contact with El-Rafei and the Al-Nur Mosque. Fakihi also met with at least one of the  members of the 9/11 Hamburg Cell, Mounir Al-Motassadeq, and provided him with a forged  passport to facilitate his escape from Germany after the attacks in New York. Fakihi’s  involvement with Motassadeq fueled suspicions that high-ranking members of the Saudi  cccxci government were involved in the 9/11 attacks.   The Al-Nur Mosque promoted Islamist ideas, anti-Semitism, hatred towards the West and a  misogynist worldview. It soon attracted young radicals with an inclination to violent jihad,  whom it tolerated – if not encouraged.   But the measures taken by the international community against terrorist financing affected the  Al-Nur Mosque. First, the authorities had delayed the official registration of the property  under the name of its new owners, Aqil Abdulaziz Al-Aqil, Dr. Kamal Rafehi, and Dr. Salem  Abdul Ghani El-Rafei – for bureaucratic reasons. Then, in early 2004, the UN put Al-Aqil on  its official list of terrorists, because of his multiple ties to AQ affiliates around the world. Al- Aqil was removed as director of the Al-Haramain Foundation and its offices shut down one  by one; the organization then disbanded. However, the former owners of the 3 Haber Street  property in Berlin were less interested in the terrorism charges against their business partners  than they were in finalizing the deal to sell the property. They pressed forward to legally  transfer the land. After several appeals to the European Court of Justice, the Court ruled in  cccxcii October 2007 against the plaintiffs and to uphold the UN boycott regarding Al-Aqil.   Meanwhile, the Al-Nur Mosque had increasingly become a meeting point for militants. In  2003, it was in the limelight as the center of a bombing plot: A cell of Muslims was caught  planning attacks related to the US-led war against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq. At the center of the  plot was a Tunisian, Ihsan Garnaoui, whose biography was rather typical of radicalized  106    </page> <page sequence="109">    Muslims: He was born 1971, met a German woman in Tunisia 1995, married her a year later,  and moved to Germany. Several years later he traveled to Belgium, where he contacted  Islamists, becoming radicalized himself. His wife left him 1999. In 2001, Garnaoui visited an  AQ training camp, where he apparently met Bin Ladin. It is said that a senior AQ member  cccxciii ordered Garnaoui to perpetrate an attack in Germany.   Upon his return to Germany, Garnaoui moved to Berlin and became a frequent visitor at the  Al-Nur Mosque. He approached the imam (El- Rafei), who permitted him to offer training in  close combat to interested Muslims at the Al-Nur Mosque’s facility. In this context, he tried  to recruit jihadis in preparation for an attack in Berlin, which was planned to take place early  in the Second Gulf War. Rafei became suspicious, and banned Garnaoui from the mosque’s  premises. Although he was already under investigation, Garnaoui met repeatedly with Fakihi,  the Saudi embassy official. He applied for a Saudi visa, to prepare his escape. On March 20,  2003, police who were tailing Garnaoui saw him disappear into a car with Saudi diplomatic  license plates. German authorities believe Fakihi was the driver. When Garnaoui got out of  the car, he was arrested on terrorism charges. Two days later, the German Foreign Ministry  finally heeded the advice of intelligence officials and informed the Saudi embassy that  Fakihi’s accreditation would be withdrawn unless he returned to Saudi Arabia. Shortly before  his departure, Fakihi again met with his mentor Dubayan, who had quickly flown in from his  new domicile in London, where he now heads the London Central Mosque and the Islamic  cccxciv Culture Center.   The trial against Garnaoui was logged as a defeat for those who wanted to see him convicted  as a terrorist. Because police had arrested him before the bombing plot was finalized, the  evidence that could be assembled in court was sufficient only to convict Garnaoui of tax  evasion, fraud, and illegal possession of firearms. Garnaoui received a sentence of less than  cccxcv four years in jail. By December 2006, he had been released and had returned to Tunisia.   107    </page> <page sequence="110">    One witness at the trial who could have testified against Garnaoui was a young preacher at the  Al-Nur Mosque, Abdul Adhim Kamouss. Born in Morocco in 1978, Kamouss had come to  Germany in 1997 as a student. During his first year of study, in Leipzig, he contacted the  Syrian-born Dr. Hassan Dabbagh, aka Sheikh Abulhussein, the imam at the local Ar-Rahman  Mosque and an important and controversial figure for Germany’s Salafi milieu. Well- connected to the leaders of the MKH and IIZ in Ulm, to AQ suspect Mamoun Darkazanli in  Hamburg, and to Reda Seyam in Berlin (to name but a few), Dabbagh was seen by the  Criminal Police of Saxony as a contact for extremists and jihad-ready fighters. However,  these allegations have yet to be verified, and contradict Dabbagh’s denunciation of  cccxcvi violence.  Dr. Hassan Dabbagh was born in July 1972 in Syria. He found his way to  Salafi Islam during the 1990s when he was already in Germany. He is allegedly a student of  the Saudi Arabian scholars ‘Adnan Aal ‘Ar’ur and Ahmad Salam, aka Abu Suhayb, who is  active in The Netherlands. Both scholars were students of Al-Albani, and bear prime  responsibility for the spread of Salafism in central Europe – so much so that they can be  considered the heads of an ‘Ar’ur-Salam-Network, whose unofficial German head is Hassan  cccxcvii Dabbagh, operating out of Leipzig.  In 1995, Dabbagh founded Leipzig’s first mosque,  the Ar-Rahman, for the small Muslim community of that East German city. When Abdul  Adhim Kamouss arrived from Morocco and enrolled in a German language course in Leipzig,  Dabbagh became his mentor. Around that time, Dabbagh started using the internet for Salafi  propaganda. In 2002, his website “salaf.de” became “audioislaam.com,” where interested  cccxcviii users could live-stream lectures and sermons.   Upon graduation, the young Kamouss bid farewell to his mentor Dabbagh and relocated to  Berlin to find a job as an engineer and continue his Islamic studies with Dr. Salem Abdul  Ghani El-Rafei at the Al-Nur Mosque. There he met Ihsan Garnaoui, who was recruiting men  to his bombing plot. When Garnaoui approached Kamouss, in February 2003, Kamouss  turned him down. A few weeks later, Garnaoui was arrested. Kamouss was summoned as a  108    </page> <page sequence="111">    witness in the subsequent trial, and found himself facing a moral dilemma. He called his old  teacher Dabbagh in Leipzig for advice. An agent of the German Office for the Protection of  cccxcix the Constitution recorded the following conversation between them:   Dabbagh: If a Muslim covers up for another Muslim, then he’ll be protected by Allah on the  Day of Judgment in this life and in the hereafter.  Kamouss: Even if it is [about] a horrible crime, which will hurt Islam and the unbelievers?  Dabbagh: You must not hand your brother over nor abandon him.  Kamouss: But if he is a criminal? They know exactly that one has met with him and want to  know more.  Dabbagh: If something may still happen and others may be caused an injustice, then one has  to testify.  Kamouss: They have arrested him before...  Dabbagh: Then you should forget, my brother. Nothing has happened. You should say that it  happened a long time ago. That you are a human being, who is easily agitated and forgets  quickly.   When called to testify in court, Kamouss followed Dabbagh’s lead and covered for  cd Garnaoui.   That same year, the main preacher of the Al-Nur Mosque, El-Rafei, boarded a flight to  Lebanon from which he would not return to Berlin: On his way back, German authorities  cdi barred him from entering the country.  Subsequently, a new generation of mosque-goers  took over.    Islamic Union Schwerin, Mecklenburg Western Pomerania  Located in the northeast of Germany, Schwerin is far from being a center of Salafi activism.  However, it is relevant to Salafism in Germany, inasmuch as it provides an example of the  109    </page> <page sequence="112">    spread of Salafi influence in a very small Muslim community, and the collaboration between  a Salafi-dominated mosque and the municipality.  The “Islamischer Bund in Schwerin” (“Islamic Union Schwerin,” IBS) was officially  established in March 1993 under the leadership of the German convert Haiko Hoffmann and  his deputies, the Nigerian-born Alhaji Asmaila Musuf and the Iranian-born Ali Goudarzi. The  ethnic diversity of the IBS board was an accurate reflection of its membership. The chairman  and his deputies were in their 30s and 40s at the time. However, the small group of founding  members also included one-third ethnic Germans, which is atypical among the older Muslim  associations in Germany. Rather, it is a feature of the activist Salafi groups of the past  cdii decade.   The IBS was the only Muslim organization in Schwerin at the time of its establishment.  According to its statutes, it aimed to establish a Muslim community in Schwerin within the  legal framework of the German constitution. It built a mosque in Schwerin which not only  caters to the religious needs of the community but also “offers opportunities for inter-religious  and generally beneficial contacts, in an effort to make a contribution to inter-cultural  communication and understanding.”cdiii To fulfill these goals, the association built a mosque  with teaching facilities, a meeting venue, and an Islamic library. The group’s statutes also  promise it will assist with social issues and, when difficulties arise, with state offices or legal  problems. It also promises to educate and inform people outside the Muslim community about  Islam. These activities will be concentrated in Schwerin, the statutes read, but will also extend  cdiv their reach beyond its borders.   This small community with its diverse composition subsequently proved to be very  responsive to Salafi propaganda. At the same time, it became well integrated into Schwerin’s  non-government sector, and established formal relations with the municipality: In August  2003, the “Netzwerk Integration” (network integration) was founded as a contact point  between the offices of the municipality and local NGOs that dealt with issues of migration,  110    </page> <page sequence="113">    faith and multi-culturalism. Headed by the local Commissioner for the Integration of  Immigrants and Foreigners’ Affairs, its members are represented through a biannually elected  speakers’ council, and maintain contact with five working groups on different topics, amongst  hem a “Forum Interreligious Dialogue” of which the IBS is a part.cdvt   Despite this integration into community outreach programs in Schwerin, the IBS became  heavily influenced by the surge of Salafism in Germany, which began around the middle of  the decade.    Salafi Surge after 2005  Prior to 2005, there were only a few Salafi preachers who practiced outreach beyond their  local communities. They were the Moroccan Abdul Adhim Kamouss in Berlin; the Syrian  cdvi Hassan Dabbagh in Leipzig; and the Palestinian Abu Jibriel in West German Wuppertal.   This situation changed when a new generation of young preachers started dawa campaigns in  Germany. Their more sophisticated websites, forums and social media tools made them much  more popular amongst young German Muslims than their predecessors had been. Seminars  and sermons were recorded as audio files and later as video files, which were made available  online. Cross-regional seminars were frequently organized, and became an important tool for  movement networking and the radical transformation of sympathizers into activists. Salafi  literature and fatwas were translated from Arabic and English sources into German, making  them accessible to a much larger audience in Germany. The main language of communication  of these Salafi activities was thus German. This helped to link the culturally and ethnically  diverse membership of the Salafi movement, which comprised Muslims of Turkish, Arab,  Russian, Yugoslavian, native German and other backgrounds. When Salafi propaganda began  using the German language, the Salafi movement found it could attract far more media  attention – even if this included negative reports of its goals and ideology. According to  Dantschke, there are at least 20 Salafi itinerant preachers in Germany, with many more Salafis  111    </page> <page sequence="114">    preaching at local seminars and to religious study circles in their respective communities.  Salafi activities are not limited to Salafi own infrastructure; rather events involving Salafis  have been taking place at other mosques, leased meeting halls, and various other public  venues. There is no German state without at least one active Salafi organization. Many of  Germany’s larger cities feature so-called “dawa teams”, which explicitly try to recruit  Muslims, Christians and atheists through info stands, the distribution of leaflets, and public  cdvii events.    Two of the principle actors spurring this development were “Die Wahre Religion” (The True  Religion, DWR), and “Einladung zum Paradies” (Invitation to Paradise, EZP).    “The True Religion” and “Invitation to Paradise”  In 2005, the German convert Pierre Vogel, aka Abu Hamza, from Frechen met the middle- aged Muslim businessman Ibrahim Abou Nagie from nearby Cologne, who had discovered  cdviii Islamic dawa  as the new source of meaning in his life. Both decided to enter the debate on  the permissibility of Islamic headscarves for Muslim teachers at German public schools.  Abou Nagie’s physician, Dr. Kai Lühr, who under Abou Nagie’s influence had just converted  to Islam, joined Vogel and Nagie in their campaign. The three men recorded a DVD  promoting the headscarf for women, and distributed a large number of copies of it for free. In  October, Abou Nagie created the website “islamweb.info”, adding the moniker  “DieWahreReligion.de” (The True Religion, DWR) about a year later. These self-proclaimed  preachers networked with other Muslims in Bonn, most notably Said Al-Emrani, aka Abu  Dujana; his father Sheikh Al-Arabi (who is the acting imam of Bonn’s Al-Muhajirin  Mosque); and Ibrahim Belkaid, aka Abu Abdullah. Soon they became established in the local  cdix Muslim community, and frequently gave talks at different mosques and meeting venues.   Vogel had more ambitious plans and, as a semi-charismatic German native, also greater  ability. He traveled across Germany to call people to Salafi Islam wherever he was allowed to  112    </page> <page sequence="115">    appear. In February 2008, Vogel and Abou Nagie announced in a joint statement that they  would part ways because “brother Abu Hamza wants to conduct dawa work on a large scale,  in halls, and we [Abou Nagie and the remaining preachers from DWR], want to take care of  the people who have embraced Islam, who have started to practice this religion.”cdx Despite  its amicable tone, the statement was an attempt to gloss over significant discrepancies in the  perception of militant jihad and armed Islamist groups, which had developed over the years.  cdxi After the arrest of members of the Sauerland Cell, this issue came to the fore.  While Pierre  Vogel had repeatedly and publicly rejected terrorist attacks, the other preachers of “Die  Wahre Religion” (DWR) promoted militant jihad and martyrdom. In a lecture, Belkaid  explained DWR’s understanding of jihad: “In Islam it is just not called NATO, BND, don’t  know, KSK, and so on, but it is called jihad. This is roughly the same. [...] One side fights for  injustice, the other for justice. One side fights for Satan, kills women and children and says,  we have apologized to the Afghan government. [...] Of course there is jihad. You attack us  and we defend ourselves.”cdxii Similarly, Abou Nagie has glorified the death of Muslim  militants as a blessed martyrdom. In one of his lectures, he listed the after-worldly benefits of  a “martyr”, concluding, “May Allah let us all die as martyrs. By God, this is my desire and I  ask Allah every day: Let me die as a martyr.”cdxiii In its propaganda, the group uses an Islamic  concept, al-wala wa-l-bara (loyalty and enmity), which it interprets as a commandment to  avoid contact with the kuffar (infidels), whereby this strict separation of Muslims from non- cdxiv Muslim society shall be accompanied by feelings of animosity.   In the wider Salafi debate about whether Muslim rulers in the Arab world are kuffar (infidels),  DWR positioned itself ideologically alongside AQ, declaring Arab dictatorships to be run by  apostate governments. Vogel criticized these views. In one talk he answered a question  regarding Abou Nagie, stating that it is not true that a Muslim ruler becomes a kafir (infidel)  when he legislates differently from what Allah has revealed. Vogel also slammed the  preachers of DWR for arbitrarily interpreting the Qur’an and Sunna with disregard for the  113    </page> <page sequence="116">    cdxv opinion of eminent Muslim scholars.  Even though Abou Nagie retracted his statement  cdxvi regarding the status of Muslim rulers,  DWR continued to advocate militant jihad. The  conflict between DWR and the less violence-prone current around Vogel was fought by their  followers in online forums, where, at times, opponents declared takfir upon each other. The  heated debate waged throughout 2009 and well into the following year.  After Vogel had split from the preachers of DWR, he joined another Salafi group that was  even newer than DWR: „Einladung zum Paradies” (Invitation to Paradise, EZP). Founded in  October 2006 in Brunswick, it hosts events featuring many of the popular Salafi preachers in  Germany, who are also featured on the group’s website. Two main organizations are directly  tied to EZP: The „Islamic Education and Culture Center e.V.” in Brunswick, which was  established by Muhamad Ciftci, who also served as EZP’s chairman until May 2011; and the  Masjid As-Sunnah e.V. of Munchengladbach, which was headed by the German convert and  preacher Sven Lau. The latter organization officially dissolved itself in May 2010 and merged  cdxvii with EZP. Subsequent to the merger, Sven Lau became deputy chairman of EZP.   According to Ciftci’s website, the EZP is active internationally, but focuses on Germany,  Turkey, Bosnia and Macedonia. The main contact for the Balkans is Ciftci, who has spent  cdxviii some time in Bosnia and whose wife is Bosnian.   Ciftci was born on August 27, 1973. His full Islamic name is Sheikh Muhamad Ciftci  Seyfudin Abu Anas. His website includes a short biography that provides some insightful  information, including that Ciftci’s Turkish-born father was a founding member of the  Islamist organization IGMG, which was established in the 1960s as platform for Turkish  Muslim migrants; his father had come to work in Germany after the industrial boom of the  1950s made the immigration of foreign workers necessary. Ciftci grew up in Brunswick,  where he attended the Lessing Gymnasium until the 11th grade. Already as a child he studied  the Qur'an and the legal writings of the Hanafi school of Islam. Between 1992 and 1994, he  cdxix was a social worker for the Islamist Muslim charity IHH in Bosnia,  allegedly coordinating  114    </page> <page sequence="117">    the work of several physicians in Bosnian and Croatian refugee camps. However, it is also  cdxx known that, during the 1990s, the IHH supported jihadi cells in Bosnia.  As a witness in the  terror trial of Ömer Özdemir, Ciftci admitted that he was wounded by gunfire in Bosnia,  although he claimed that this happened when his aid convoy came under attack, and that he  had not been engaged in any hostilities. Since 1994, Ciftci has considered himself part of the  Salafi branch of Islam. He has continued his Islamic studies with various imams in Europe,  and also took classes, by telephone with the widely popular Salafi scholar Muhammad  Nasiruddin Al-Albani for about a year. Since 1997, Ciftci has guided pilgrimage tours to  Saudi Arabia. He studied Sharia Law at the Islamic University of Medina with various Saudi  scholars between 1998 and 2006, when he himself also started preaching throughout the  country, including in Medina and Mecca. Upon his return to Germany he became an imam in  Brunswick, established EZP and, in 2007, began teaching online German-language courses in  Islam, allegedly according to the standards of Medina University. In 2009 he became the  owner and director of EZP’s publishing house and its magazine cdxxiZam Zam.   Ciftci is under observation by German security agencies. A 2010 report cites one of Ciftci’s  online clips, in which he explains that decapitation is an appropriate punishment for the  renunciation of Islam, and that women must conceal their faces and hands in public and may  cdxxii only leave the house in company of a male guardian.   At the trial of Ömer Özdemir, the defendant accidentally mentioned Ciftci when asked if he  collected money for AQ in Germany: „Let’s say, I had gone to Ciftci of Brunswick and said:  Give me money for jihad! He wouldn’t even have believed me.” Unfortunately, nobody raised  cdxxiii the question why he should have gone to Ciftci, of all people.    In 2010, Ciftci planned to move his Islamic school to Munchengladbach. One probable reason  for the move was a desire to move a bit closer to his comrades in the far west of Germany and  to the much larger Muslim community in the Ruhr area, which would provide more clients for  the school than Brunswick. In recent years, Munchengladbach has become a center of Salafi  115    </page> <page sequence="118">    activism in the region: In July 2005, the Islamic Culture Center Masjid As-Sunna was  founded as legal body running the local As-Sunna Mosque. Half a year later, the German  convert and EZP preacher Sven Lau assumed the center’s chairmanship, serving in this  capacity until the association officially dissolved in May 2010 and merged with EZP. As  noted, at that time Lau became the vice chairman of EZP, which took over running the  cdxxiv mosque.   Sven Lau himself was born in 1980. A native German from Munchengladbach, he was raised  in a Catholic family. At the age of eighteen, just when he was finishing his vocational training  as an industrial mechanic, he met a Turkish colleague at work, whom he describes as an  altruistic and welcoming person. Enchanted by his colleague’s forthcoming behavior, Lau  became interested in Islam – specifically, the explicit confirmation of an afterlife, which upon  Lau’s conversion became a main topic and “catch phrase” of his proselytization efforts.cdxxv-   Ciftci’s plans to relocate to Munchengladbach were not kept a secret. EZP had already  purchased a plot of land next to the mosque for about €180,000, raised from donations, one of  cdxxvi which was sizable and provided by an unnamed foreign donor.  In August 2010, the  website of the state intelligence office of Lower Saxony noted Ciftci’s intention to move his  Islamic school to the planned facilities in Munchengladbach. Soon the local media picked up  the story, followed by features on national TV. A citizens’ action group opposed to EZP was  formed, and the issue made some headlines. The Munchengladbach municipality started to  look for ways to curtail the growing influence of the local Salafis. The Construction of the  new missionary center was easily stopped, due to the lack of a building permit. Further  scrutiny revealed that the existing facilities had only been issued a permit to function as a  shop, and not as a prayer room or meeting venue. Thus, not only had the association run its  mosque illegally for five years, but the kindergarten it had been operating since 2008 had  never been approved either. The authorities took prompt action, sealing up the building. EZP  reacted with a public relations campaign, organized information stands spread throughout the  116    </page> <page sequence="119">    city, a rally, and public prayers. All of this effort only made things worse for EZP. Although  Ciftci had already declared in September 2010 that he had changed his mind and would stay  in less troublesome Brunswick, citizens continued to rally against the Salafi center. Also in  September 2010, the Ministry of the Interior of North Rhine-Westphalia issued a statement  that EZP’s ideology violated the German constitution, although it was unclear whether there  was sufficient evidence to shut it down. In an unsuccessful attempt to collect this evidence,  the Federal Ministry of the Interior intervened in December 2010 and ordered a raid on the  cdxxvii facilities in Munchengladbach and Brunswick.   The tense situation in Munchengladbach led some right-wing activists to jump on the  bandwagon and demonstrate against EZP. In one incident, Sven Lau and his family were  attacked by what he claimed was a mob of right-wing extremists. However, local media  described the incident as a mere confrontation between Salafis and a group celebrating  carnival. The chain of events must have confirmed EZP’s idée fixe of a society hostile to  Islam and hankering for murder. Pierre Vogel, in particular, plays this tune over and over,  repeatedly preaching that Muslims in Germany are today’s Jews, and that the German public  was ripe for a new “Kristallnacht.” In one clip he explained, “What do you think would  happen if somebody threw the first stone? One can see this [by what happens] in  Munchengladbach. This is why – don’t make yourselves a fool! Here, one lives in  danger.”cdxxviii  In an apparent attempt to manufacture some proof of EZP’s allegations of a pogrom-like  atmosphere in Munchengladbach, Lau is said to have set fire to a house next to his mosque in  June 2011. EZP claimed to be the victim of the attack, but police investigators found contrary  evidence, brought Lau in for questioning, and started arson proceedings against him and two  cdxxix other Salafis.  Mounting pressure from the public, the media, state security services, and  cdxxx these legal proceedings finally led EZP to officially dissolve on August 4, 2011.   117    </page> <page sequence="120">    Prior to that, as noted, Pierre Vogel had split from the organization. According to a report of  the German intelligence service BND, the cult of personality surrounding Vogel had proven  to be detrimental to the missionary work of EZP. In fact, Vogel had become somewhat of a  cdxxxi star for many young Muslims, even though he has few religious credentials.   Arguably the most popular convert in Germany, Pierre Vogel, aka Abu Hamza Salahudin,  was born in 1978 in the town of Frechen near Cologne in what was then West Germany. He  cdxxxii was baptized an Evangelical Christian.  His family lives in Bergheim, a small town west  of Cologne, where his parents run a restaurant. Vogel first attended an elite Catholic  gymnasium before transferring to a special sports gymnasium in Berlin Hohenschönhausen.  There he underwent intensive boxing training, and finally signed a professional contract in  2000. After his conversion to Islam in May 2001, he wanted to stop boxing, since it is  forbidden to punch people in the face, according to the Sunna. However, for financial reasons,  he ended his brief career only in 2002. Vogel then enrolled in a social science and geography  teacher training program at the University of Cologne, but left after one semester. He planned  on becoming an interpreter, and started a program in Arabic language – but did not finish that,  cdxxxiii either.  Since the Muslim tradition of a family-arranged marriage was not feasible for  cdxxxiv Vogel, in 2003 he asked his friends to choose a wife for him.  Beginning in 2004, he  attended three semesters of Arabic language study at the institute for foreigners of the Umm- Al-Qura Islamic University in Mecca, Saudi Arabia. His plans to reunite with his Moroccan  wife and his son Hamza in Saudi Arabia had to be cancelled when his daughter was born with  cdxxxv a cardiac disorder, in 2006. He returned to Germany to join his family.   In internet clips Vogel rejects the label „Wahhabi” that both the media and other Muslims  often apply to Salafi preachers to emphasize their ideological proximity to official Saudi  doctrine rather than to that of the pious forefathers of Islam, the salaf as-salih. However, his  convictions indicate the similarity of his thinking to the ideology promoted in Saudi Arabia.  On one occasion, during a talk at a mosque in the city of Göttingen in 2007, he justified the  118    </page> <page sequence="121">    marriage of nine-year-old girls. As is Salafi consensus, Vogel advocates the use of corporal  cdxxxvi punishment, as it is prescribed in the sharia [Islamic law].  Even though Vogel  emphasizes the need of Muslims to adhere to German law, as they are a minority in the  country, he fantasizes about toppling the state and its man-made institutions: “Our goal is to  call the whole world to Islam. Our goal is to tear down the wall of taghut [lit. idolatry] in this  country and level it to the ground.”cdxxxvii Despite Vogel’s vocal denunciation of terrorism, for  which he allegedly has received numerous death threats, his attitude towards political and  religious violence is ambiguous. Subsequent to the killing of US airmen at Frankfurt airport,  Vogel explained that even though he considers an attack on soldiers to be less severe than an  attack on civilians, he still speaks out against it. But instead of stressing that the attack in  Frankfurt was illegitimate in itself, he explained that it was wrong because it was “harmful to  ion]”.cdxxxviiithe umma [the Muslim Nat  The question remains as to what Vogel has to say  about attacks which he believes would be “useful to the umma”.  According to German security officials, Vogel and the other prominent figures of EZP have  for years been in contact with the MKH in Ulm and the IIZ in Neu-Ulm – both of which were  hot spots of jihadi recruitment before their closure on December 28, 2005 and October 2,  cdxxxix 2007, respectively.  Police raided Vogel’s home in April 2008 and again in December  2010, but no evidence relevant to criminal prosecution could be found. A large part of  Vogel’s appeal certainly stems from his ability to portray himself as a persecuted outlaw who  is simultaneously both an upright Muslim and a completely average German. A T-Shirt in  Vogel’s local dialect reads “German Muslim – Here at home. Alright!” caters to this image,  as do occasional squabbles with the police, and travel bans such as the one imposed in  December 2009, when Swiss authorities barred Vogel from entering Switzerland to attend a  cdxl public rally against the local minaret ban.   The combination of public, confrontational statements against Western, democratic society  and the renunciation of terrorist attacks in the name of the umma have guaranteed Vogel mass  119    </page> <page sequence="122">    appeal as a German renegade who found his way to Islam, swims against the tide and fights  the establishment. In addition, he already leads a growing following, which will rule the  anticipated “secret caliphate to come.” Vogel simultaneously embodies the outsider and the  leader. His followers can identify with his role as outcast of an evil but ailing society and  simultaneously feel part of the vanguard of a new Islamic age that will be born in a life-and- death struggle. Vogel has repeatedly propagated this idea. In April 2011, he preached to a  group of local Salafis in Munchengladbach: “One will try to destroy us. The hostility has been  clearly shown. We must not deceive ourselves. [...] I also advise everybody to keep a suitcase  ready at home and enough money to be able to buy a flight ticket and flee this country as  quickly as possible. Because history tells us that this kind of incitement always leads to two  things: Either it totally backfires and everybody is all of sudden on our side, or one is  slaughtered. This is the historical truth. Every time such incitement was practiced it led to  annihilation.” Vogel continued to explain that although people denigrate him for equating the  situation of Muslims today with that of European Jewry just before the Holocaust, this  equation is nevertheless accurate. He concluded: “Therefore there are just two options. Either  [the situation] escalates in one direction or all of Germany adopts Islam. We hope it will be  the latter. But in the end we will always win. [...] The victory will either be that people adopt  cdxli Islam, or [that] one will be expelled and, through striving, Allah will elevate him  or he  will be killed and become a shaheed (martyr). But victory is with the believers.” cdxlii  Listening to these ideas, Vogel’s rapprochement with DWR in 2011 might come as less of a  surprise. A week after his sermon in Munchengladbach, Vogel declared his support for  Ibrahim Abou Nagie, who then faced charges for his calls to violence and incitement. Two  months later he and Said el-Emrani, the other DWR preacher, finally announced Vogel’s re- cdxliii union with DWR.   Vogel’s growing popularity can be seen not only in his success as an online preacher, but also  in his ability to mobilize young Muslims for public rallies and to entice internationally- 120    </page> <page sequence="123">    renowned Salafi preachers to visit him in Germany. In April 2011, Vogel appeared in front of  a crowd of about 1,500 mostly young Muslims together with Bilal Philips in Frankfurt; the  following month he preached alongside Abdul Raheem Green in Koblenz. Both Philips and  Green are convert preachers who are widely popular, especially in Salafi circles in the West.  Philips was born in Jamaica but grew up in Canada. After converting to Islam, he studied in  Saudi Arabia and later started teaching Islamic studies at Riyadh High School. One of his  students, Ali Al-Timimi, later became a preacher of jihad in the US. In April 2005, Al-Timimi  was convicted for inciting to terrorism, supporting the Taliban, and possession of explosives  and firearms. Philips had been speaking in support of his former student since 2004, and  called on Muslims to assist Al-Timimi “financially, morally or politically.” In addition,  Philips was notorious for his 1993 program to convert American servicemen, some of whom  he encouraged to join jihad in Bosnia, and for his public promotion of the death penalty for  cdxliv “A slow and painful death by stoning”cdxlvhomosexuals.   was also advocated by Abdul  Raheem Green on his website as the Islamic punishment for homosexual intercourse. Green is  a UK-based Salafi convert and preacher. Even though he argues that targeting civilians is  prohibited by Islam, during a lecture at the University College London, Green showed a great  deal of understanding for the terrorism campaign of Osama bin Laden: “If you kill our women  and children we’re going to kill your women and children. And we’re going to keep on killing  your women and children until you stop killing our women and children. This is his [Osama  bin Ladin’s] rationale. If you just take the point of view of logic and reasoned argument... it’s  pretty difficult to counter an argument like that. It’s pretty difficult to do it. There’s a sort of  justice to that, isn’t there?”cdxlvi  This ideological oscillation between empathy for violent jihad and rejection of attacks as  “terrorism” is typical of Vogel. Defending Ibrahim Abou Nagie for his calls to armed  resistance and his hate speech against Christians Vogel explained in an online clip that those  Muslims who exaggerate in their use of takfir are usually those who “love the religion, see  121    </page> <page sequence="124">    ut this whole issue.”cdxlviiinjustices and get so agitated abo  After the killing of Osama bin  Ladin in a US commando operation in Pakistan, Vogel called for a public Islamic requiescat  in Frankfurt. Not only the mainstream media lambasted Vogel, but so did many of his more  moderate Salafi friends, including preachers from EZP. In an interview Vogel explained that  the gathering was meant more as a marketing strategy than a provocation. The authorities  denied Vogel’s request but had to allow the demonstration under the title: “What is Islam’s  stance on terrorism?” On May 7, 2011 Vogel gave a speech in Frankfurt explaining the  difference between the killing of soldiers and civilians. Ciftci, then the head of EZP, did not  want to play along with the increasingly political statements of Vogel; he sent an email to  cdxlviii about 5,000 of his followers, officially breaking with Vogel.   It remains to be seen whether, after his re-union with DWR, Vogel will fall in line with  Nagie’s, El-Emrani’s and Belkaid’s explicit support for jihad and martyrdom, or whether he  will remain more ill-disposed towards contemporary jihadi violence.  Regardless of how Vogel and the heads of EZP and DWR develop, there are now other  preachers in Germany who not only promote Salafi ideology but who also have been in direct  contact with senior jihadis. Often they walk a fine line between placating mainstream society,  and promoting an essentially dichotomous, misogynist, and violent worldview. Depending on  their assessment of the political situation at any given time, these preachers either condone or  reject jihadi violence. The scope and target of such violence is included into their calculations  no less than are the anticipated reactions of the media, the public, the authorities and even the  Salafi community. Unsurprisingly, hardly any Salafi preacher in Germany calls for attacks  against civilians on German soil, or defends such attacks. A much greater number of them  make statements supporting jihad against foreign military forces in countries with a Muslim  majority, such as the US Army in Iraq and Afghanistan. It is a matter of discussion how these  calls to ”defend the umma” abroad have been heeded by scores of young Germans throughout  Germany. Even though Salafi groups and mosques have burgeoned throughout Germany in  122    </page> <page sequence="125">    recent years, a few regional centers hold special importance for recruitment to jihad. Hamburg  is one of these.     Developments in Hamburg, 2005-201  Since 2001, the Al-Quds Mosque had attracted a great deal of publicity, which is why in July  2008 the association running the facility finally decided to change its name to Al-Taiba  Mosque. However, the mosque continued to cater to militant Salafis in Hamburg, amongst  them a group who would later fight with the Islamic Movement Uzbekistan (IMU), and who  cdxlix formed the heart of the 2010 Europe plot.  In August 2010, the German authorities finally  cdl shut the mosque down.  Until then, AQ veteran Mamoun Darkazanli served as the imam at  the mosque.  In 2008, Hamburg became the home of Germany’s most important German Salafi Forum,  “Ahlu-Sunnah.com”, which allows for a plurality of Salafi opinions but largely conforms to  the jihad-friendly stance of DWR.  After the German section of Al-Qaida’s “Global Islamic Media Front” (GIMF) had been shut  down in July 2008 and its members arrested in September 2010, two new websites tried to  replace AQ’s German propaganda platform: The “Islamic Hacker Union” and the website  “Islambruederschaft.com.” Both websites paled in comparison to the online presence of both  EZP and DWR. (Pierre Vogel, who was always keen to set himself apart from the other  groups, established his own website in December 2010, but it, too, had far fewer visitors than  cdli the websites of either of the other two groups. )  The Islamic Hacker Union and Islambruederschaft.com explicitly catered to German-speakers  cdlii interested in jihadi violence, and who follow the more radical German preachers.  The  founder of Islambruederschaft.com, Omid H., was arrested in July 2011 and his website shut  down. The Islamic Hacker Union was active for an even shorter time. The German Harry  Machura, who called himself Isa Ibn Khattab, ran the site. Born in 1992 in a small town near  123    </page> <page sequence="126">    Hamburg, Machura had a troubled youth until his brother-in-law, Salman Al-Farsi, introduced  him to Islam when he was 16. Machura went to Hamburg to listen to sermons, including those  delivered at the radical Al-Quds/Al-Taibe Mosque. He first frequented the website of EZP,  cdliii but soon was drawn to the more violent message of DWR.   A day before the closure of Hamburg’s Al-Taibe Mosque on August 9, 2010, a new mosque  association, ”Masjid Al-Sunna,” was established a few miles north of Hamburg, in Pinneberg.  It became the meeting point for many of Hamburg's most radical Salafis. Machura, living less  than 40 miles away in Neumünster, also visited it. The head of the Masjid Al-Sunna  association was Slim Kliti, aka Salim Ibn Omar, who was born in Oldenburg in 1984. Kliti  and his friends are close to the preachers of DWR and Dawa FFM from Frankfurt. When  Berlin’s ex-rapper Denis Cuspert, aka Deso Dogg, aka Abou Maleeq, aka Abu Talha Al- Almani performed his first jihad anthem at a joint seminar of both groups in Mayen in  January 2011, Kliti and other Salafis from Pinneberg were in the audience, smiling and  cdliv applauding.   After his performance in Mayen, Cuspert received an invitation to appear at Pinneberg’s  Masjid Al-Sunna. Until this point, the mosque community had been able to avoid public  scrutiny. The first articles published about the mosque appeared in a local newspaper on  January 14, 2011, and covered Cuspert’s visit to Pinneberg and the radical background of the  mosque. A few days later, the head of the Jewish community publicly called for the mosque  association to be outlawed. Finally, Machura had found a local target for his jihadi ambitions.,  He posted a picture of the Jewish official, crossed out in red, on his Islamic Hacker Union  website and wrote: ”Watch out that Allah does not already punish you with death in this life”  and ”The punishment of Allah can strike you anywhere”.cdlv   Suddenly the mosque was in the limelight as a new center of militant Salafis from around  Hamburg. The owner of the mosque’s facilities declared that he would not extend its contract;  the mosque association reacted to this announcement quickly, and left the premises on  124    </page> <page sequence="127">    cdlvi January 28.  Machura continued his propaganda campaign from home, posting footage of  the Islamic Jihad Union fighting in Afghanistan. In March 2011, subsequent to the deadly  shooting at Frankfurt Airport, Machura uploaded a video clip praising the shooting as a  counterstrike against the infidels. His rare openness in praising AQ and terrorism made  Machura interesting to the media. In May he was interviewed for a German TV report, in  which he explained that today’s Muslims had to learn how to handle weapons and explosives.  He added that he wished to die as soon as possible as a martyr. His wish was thwarted,  however, when he was arrested by the police on June 30 and transferred to Karlsruhe, where  he faces charges of recruitment for the IJU and the terrorist group The Islamic State of  cdlvii Iraq.   State pressure on Salafi groups, preachers, and activists factors into the growing importance  of internet forums where Salafis can communicate anonymously and access links to the whole  spectrum of Salafi propaganda. Apart from mainstream providers of social networking, like  Facebook, there are online forums that cater to the Salafi movement. With more than 2,000  registered members, the aforementioned Ahlu-Sunna Forum, online since 2008, is the most  cdlviii important of these.  Machura’s brother-in-law, Salman Al-Farsi (b.1991), is a moderator  of a forum which, despite heated debates about the correct manhaj, is closer to the jihad- supporting milieu of DWR. Al-Farsi also uses mainstream social media like Facebook to  cdlix disseminate his propaganda in an attempt to raise donations for Machura.   In recent years, the nascent Salafi movement in Germany has been able to grow and diversify.  Even though the German authorities have successfully cracked down on a number of terrorist  cells and their supporters and ideologues, Salafi groups have continued to spring up all over  the country and a younger generation, often with no direct connection to experienced jihadi  groups abroad, has started to autonomously spread Salafi propaganda. Taking the success of  jihad-leaning groups and forums like DWR, Dawa FFM and Ahlu-Sunna.com into  consideration, it is safe to assume that there are at least several hundred young Salafis in  125    </page> <page sequence="128">    Germany who are in favor of global jihad. Even if these radicals do not train to participate in  attacks, they are likely to support terrorist groups in Germany and elsewhere, making a  sophisticated attack on German soil more likely.   The mounting political and media pressure on prominent Salafi imams, however, seems also  to have had a moderating impact. At least, this has been the case in Leipzig.    Developments in Leipzig  Eager to establish relations with local non-Muslim communities and the Leipzig municipality,  Hassan Dabbagh was active in a number of inter-faith events and organized open door days at  his mosque. As one of the few imams in the area, Dabbagh was even allowed to work at  Leipzig’s penal facility. When two engineers from Leipzig were abducted by insurgents in  Iraq in 2006, Dabbagh publicly called for their release, dedicated a prayer to them and joined  the official rally demanding their freedom. That same year he was invited three times to  cdlx appear on major German TV talk shows, without having his Salafi ideas confronted.   The television channels’ editors could have known whom they were inviting. Dabbagh’s close  ties to the network of Salafi groups surrounding EZP and DWR are well known. For years he  has been giving talks that can still be found online. In one speech, Dabbagh lamented the  ”bestial slaughtering of Muslims in Chechnya, Palestine and elsewhere” and discussed the  resulting need for jihad. In the same speech he called “Jews the enemies of Islam, who try to  kill believers”. In addition to his guest lectures, Dabbagh also holds seminars and weekend  retreats, which he often organizes together with a Salafi preacher from Bonn, Mohamed  cdlxi Benhsain.   Benhsain runs his own publishing house in Bonn – Al-Tamhid Verlag – and organizes Salafi  cdlxii Islamic seminars that feature Salafi preachers from the EZP and DWR networks.  These  ties are no secret, as these events are usually filmed and documented and the resulting video  cdlxiii clips posted online.  The seminars have become increasingly popular in recent years, and  126    </page> <page sequence="129">    cdlxiv are sometimes attended by up to 500 participants.  The Office for the Protection of the  Constitution believes that Benhsain is one middleman between radical Salafis in Germany and  militant jihadis abroad, and helps facilitate the recruitment and transportation of German  cdlxv Muslims to AQ and IJU training camps.  Indeed Benhsain was acquainted with several  jihadis including Eric Breininger and Abdirazak B., who had tried to join his infamous friend  and AQ operative Bekkay Harrach in Pakistan but was stopped by police. Benhsain’s  seminars on Islam have also been attended by Attila Selek and Adem Yilmaz, who were part  of the Sauerland Group, as well as by Germany’s first suicide bomber, Cüneyit Ciftci, and of  cdlxvi course by Bekkay Harrach, who had even lectured at these seminars.  However,  Hummel/Malthaner point out that militant jihad was usually not an official topic at the  seminars. Rather, like-minded attendees gathered during the breaks in informal groups to  cdlxvii openly discuss matters of jihadi violence.  Even though jihad did not play a central role in  the lectures of Benshain and Dabbagh, the educational literature they used spoke clearly  derogatory of non-Muslims and, as a matter of principle, sanctioned religious violence. One  of the basic readings assigned by Benhsain for his seminars is Aqeedah Ahlu Sunnah wal  Jamaa'ah [Doctrine of the Sunni Community], authored by the Saudi scholar Sheikh  Muhammad Ibn Saleh Al-Uthaymeen. Uthaymeen was a student of the well-known Saudi  scholar Sheikh Abd Al-Aziz bin Baz, who also wrote the introduction to the book. Benhsain  translated the book from Arabic into German. One passage explicitly calls the followers of  other faiths “unbelievers”. It remains dubious as to whether only apostates should be  reprimanded and, if intransigent, killed, or whether all non-Muslims are considered apostates  and should ipso facto be put to death: „It is our opinion that whoever claims the acceptability  before Allah of any of today’s religions – different from Islam – e.g., Judaism, Christianity,  and so forth – is an unbeliever. He should be asked to repent, and if he does not he has to be  ), because he denies the Qur’an.”cdlxviiiexecuted as an apostate (murtad   127    </page> <page sequence="130">    An ex-Salafi described the major message of all Islamic seminars as a call to reject everything  that is not sanctioned by the Qur’an, the Sunnah, or the teachings of Qur’anic scholars.  Participants are advised to refuse friendship with Christians and Jews, and girls are taught not  to attend swimming lessons or school trips. According to this former Salafi, many of his  cdlxix friends quit their jobs because they were not able to pray five times a day.   The Salafi network in Germany is so tightly knit that it is perhaps less surprising that Hassan  Dabbagh is also linked to international jihadis: For years he was in close contact with the  scene in Ulm, and he was a personal acquaintance of Dr. Adly el-Attar, who had hosted AQ’s  former chief of finance, Mamdouh Mahmud Salim, in Germany. In 1997, Dabbagh received  1,000 Deutschmarks from the alleged senior AQ member Mamoun Darkazanli. He was also  in contact with Atta, Bahaji and Binalshibh of the 9/11 Hamburg Cell, as well as with the  members of the Sauerland Group. All of this, however, was circumstantial evidence. In 2008,  federal prosecutors leveled allegations against Dabbagh and a number of other Salafi  preachers under §129 of the German Criminal Code, which punishes the formation,  membership and support of a criminal organization. Those accused included Mohamed  Benhsain, Hassan Dabbagh and Reda Seyam, who after his jihadi globetrotting in Bosnia,  Saudi Arabia, Pakistan and Indonesia had begun producing video documentation of various  cdlxx Salafi events in Germany.   The investigation stirred up a lot of negative publicity but did not lead to a trial. With his  image badly hurt, Dabbagh tried harder to portray himself as a moderate. He continued to  preach about the peacefulness of Islam and condemned suicide attacks as alien to his religion.  Early in 2011, one of the seminars he had given in Switzerland was posted online, including  his views and those of Mohamed Benhsain on terrorist practices. Dabbagh explained, with  explicit referral to the fact that non-Muslims might be watching the recording, ”This is my  faith and I hold this before Allah - Subhanahu wa ta'ala - that one is neither permitted to  perpetrate suicide attacks nor that one may terrorize the others or that one - wa-l-I'jadu billah -  128    </page> <page sequence="131">    blows up busses or trains or planes. The Muslim must not do this because you will be called  to account for every drop of blood.” Then a guest in the audience asked about Dabbagh’s  opinion in case the kuffar had perpetrated atrocities against Muslims. Dabbagh cut him short  and replied that there is no vigilante justice in Islam, and that only the caliph, as the successor  to Muhammad, had the right to declare jihad. “With us it is often emotional. Perhaps the  kuffar have done something to us. Then we say 'oouuuhh, we show revenge.' – But there is no  revenge in Islam. The Prophet Muhammad did not show revenge when he liberated Mecca.”  Benhsain agreed with Dabbagh and seconded: “You need a caliph, you need a judiciary, you  – Then the discussion is superfluous.”cdlxxineed a system. Is there one in an Islamic country?    For all his efforts, Dabbagh could not win the media back to his side. Although Dabbagh had  previously been a well-liked guest at local inter-faith events, the invitations to these became  cdlxxii more seldom. Nevertheless, Dabbagh continued his work as an itinerant preacher,  and  even extended his influence. He organized Islamic seminars in Eisenberg, and his mosque  association in Leipzig, the “Ar-Rahman Moschee e.V.,” is listed as the beneficiary if the  cdlxxiii largest Muslim association in the same German state, Thuringia, is dissolved.  Moreover,  Dabbagh holds his stakes in the expanding Salafi milieu in Berlin.    Developments in Berlin 2005-2011  After el-Rafei’s forced withdrawal from the affairs of the Al-Nur Mosque, another Salafi  preacher became its new imam: Abu Nasser Al-Issa. The younger Abdul Adhim Kamouss  focused on recruiting teenagers. For some time he had already given Islamic classes every  Sunday at the Al-Nur Mosque, where he is known as Abdul-Adhim Abu Abdir-Rahman. In an  attempt to establish an independent power base within that institution, in late 2006, Kamouss  and his mostly young Arab disciples founded the “Tauhid e.V.” association.cdlxxiv In addition,  Kamouss occasionally preaches at the Masjid-E-Bilal – a mosque headed by the young imam  Ferid Heider, who is close to the Muslim Brotherhood and works for several mosques in  129    </page> <page sequence="132">    Berlin, including an affiliate of HAMAS in Germany, the ”Islamic Culture and Education  Center Berlin” (IKEZ).cdlxxv  While avoiding open calls for the establishment of Islamic rule in Germany, Kamouss  promotes typical Islamist values: He legitimizes the stoning of men and women for  fornication as is laid out in the sharia. His praise of Palestinian “martyrs” and condemnation  of the state of Israel are evidenced in many of his speeches, which are available on the  internet. On one occasion, the German police tapped into a conversation between Kamouss  and his companion Sami Ben D., and heard Kamouss talk about “spitting on the unbelievers,  devouring them, and letting them drown in rivers and lakes.”cdlxxvi Nevertheless, Kamouss is  eager to keep jihadi cells out of sight. He has spoken out against terrorist attacks in Germany  and has asked his followers: “Anyone who is approached by someone about such things – like  whooping [sic] against presidents, joining jihad, carrying arms and such things – shall please  tell me. Absolutely! Absolutely my dear brothers. It is an important issue for us, a measure of  ave such a thing amongst us.”cdlxxviiprotection. We do not want to h    Despite this measure of moderation, at least in the public statements of Al-Nur’s leaders, and  although the openly militant preachers of DWR became personae non grata at Al-Nur, the  mosque has remained a center for militant Muslims. Time and again young disciples of the  mosque have disappeared to training camps in Pakistan. At times, whole circles of friends  have left Germany to fight jihad abroad. In its 2010 annual report, the LfV Berlin stated:  ”Young adults between 18 and 25 years, including born Muslims and converts, left Berlin,  too, some of them with their wives, to join jihad. In 2010, at least one Berlin jihadi was killed  in clashes; others were arrested when departing and are now back in Berlin”.cdlxxviii   At the same time, growing public pressure on the Al-Nur Mosque and the seeming  moderation of Al-Nur’s preachers have begun to bear fruit. Young, violence-prone Muslims  in Berlin have found a new meeting point in northwest Berlin: the “As-Sahaba e.V.” This  130    </page> <page sequence="133">    relatively new association highlights how closely related so-called “purist Salafis” and known  jihadis can be.  Founded in May 2007 by a small group led by the German convert Andreas Salzmann (b.  1979), the As-Sahaba e.V. is practically an offshoot of Dabbagh’s Ar-Rahman Mosque in  Leipzig. A few weeks prior to the association’s official establishment, Dabbagh had come  from Leipzig to give a talk about the Islamic features of a good spouse, in which he basically  explained that men should be good to their wives and wives should obey their husbands.  Mahmoud Attaha (b. 1976), a friend of Salzmann’s, had just married; soon thereafter, he  cdlxxix became the deputy, and Salzmann the chairman, of the association.   Salzmann also owns the As-Sunna publishing house – a German Salafi outlet that sells books  and distributes video recordings featuring Dabbagh and the imam of the As-Sahaba Mosque,  Ahmad Abul Baraa. Like Dabbagh, Abul Baraa is often criticized by more confrontational  Salafis for his too moderate views. The rejection of terrorist attacks and the dismissal of the  idea that Muslim rulers are apostates because they legislate laws that diverge from the sharia  seem to have dominated the teachings in the As-Sahaba circles during the first years of its  existence. In the jihadi-friendly online forum, “Ahlu-Sunnah.com” Abul Baraa and Dabbagh  faced allegations that they were too lax in declaring other Muslims apostates, and for  cdlxxx denouncing jihadi preachers.  However, Salzmann had had contact with MKH and IIZ  prior to their closure, and in 2008, police had raided his apartment, too, in a failed attempt to  produce evidence that Salzmann was part of the same allegedly criminal organization as  Dabbagh, Vogel and others. Ultimately, these charges had to be dropped, and the association  thrived. The Islamic studies circle around Ahmad Abul Baraa grew steadily until 2010, when  the As-Sahaba e.V. established its own prayer rooms at 14 Torf Street in Berlin.   There are two indicators that since 2011 at least, the mosque has been a new center for jihad- prone Salafis in the German capital. Firstly, the ex-rapper Denis Mamadou Cuspert started to  frequent the mosque. Cuspert had finished his career as a “gangster-rapper” in 2010, after  131    </page> <page sequence="134">    Pierre Vogel and Abdul Adhim Kamouss won him over to Salafism. In an online clip from  April 2010, Pierre Vogel is seen talking to Cuspert. Vogel first nonchalantly remarks that he  would not listen to any music at all, and suggests that Cuspert should find “a new field of  occupation” more appropriate to Islam. He then discusses the possibility of meeting other  German rap-artists in order to win their fans over for Islam. Cuspert agrees to help, and offers  to attend Vogel’s future talks and to promote his cause.cdlxxxi However, soon after his  inclusion in the Salafi milieu, Cuspert became close to the more jihad-prone Salafi groups,  cdlxxxii especially DWR and the Frankfurt-based Dawa FFM.  In January 2011, Cuspert  appeared at a seminar hosted by both groups in Mayen, about 40 miles south of Bonn, where  he performed a song explicitly calling the audience to join jihad in Afghanistan and die as  cdlxxxiii martyrs.  Since then, Cuspert has written several more jihad anthems, amongst them  “Mujaheed Run” and “What We Stand For,” in which sequences of Islamist militants and  cdlxxxiv battles are shown as Cuspert calls for violence against the infidels.  Due to his broad  appeal, especially amongst young German Muslims who favor violent jihad, Cuspert’s  presence at the As-Sahaba Mosque in Berlin drew some of the more radical young people  away from the Al-Nur Mosque.  The second indicator of the As-Sahaba Mosque’s new role was its new emir: Reda Seyam.  While most Muslim associations in Berlin do not want to be affiliated with Seyam, who was a  member of AQ in the past, and have asked him to stay away, the As-Sahaba circles have  cdlxxxv made Seyam their de-facto leader.   Ten years after 9/11, one of the longest-serving and  most experienced German jihadis, a personal friend of Osama bin Ladin and an AQ operative  allegedly responsible for the deaths of 202 people in Bali, headed a mosque in the German  cdlxxxvi capital.   It is questionable whether the ideological shift of the As-Sahaba Mosque towards jihad was  evidence that Dabbagh and Abul Baraa were losing their grip on the association, or evidence  that they tolerated Seyam, Cuspert and the like as long as they kept a low profile. In fact, a  132    </page> <page sequence="135">    surveillance protocol that was leaked to the press in 2009 suggested clear hierarchies in the  group, and that Seyam took orders from Dabbagh. In an older interview, Dabbagh also  downplayed the role of Seyam, calling him nothing but “a camera man” and “a  journalist.”cdlxxxvii  Thus, the As-Sahaba e.V. displayed the interconnection between the two main currents of  Salafism like no other active Salafi organization in Germany: Those who call for dialogue and  speak out against Islamist terrorism, and those who denounce the “infidels” and incite to kill  them. The latter group rarely raises its voice in public. The threat of state action and legal  prosecution is real, as evidenced in the numerous trials against jihadis in Germany. In any  case, Jihadi websites, which keep their readers informed with news from “the front”, and  jihadi-friendly forums, which facilitate anonymous communication among Salafis, seem to be  cdlxxxviii of greater importance.     Developments in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania  In April 2006, the long-serving chair of the IBS, Haiko Hoffmann, headed the association’s  general assembly for the last time. He had converted to Shia Islam the previous year, as part  of the disagreement that eventually led to a split in the Sunni-dominated IBS and the  foundation of Schwerin’s Shia association, the “Islamisches Zentrum Schwerin,” (Islamic  Center Schwerin, IZS), which cooperates closely with the Iranian Shiite center (IZH) in  cdlxxxix Hamburg.   The new head of the IBS was Abdelkader Aloui (b. 1962), who reportedly holds weekly  cdxc Islamic classes for the IBS community, with his wife.  Their growing influence is  evidenced not only by events featuring Salafi preachers in Schwerin, but also by availability  of Salafi propaganda at the mosque, including German translations of Saudi literature and  posters on the prayer room walls, which were published by EZP head Muhamad Ciftci and  cdxci which propagate a dress code dictated by the ideology of the Salafi Neo Ahl-e-Hadith.  In  133    </page> <page sequence="136">    addition, political and terrorist events seem to have been discussed, at least occasionally:  According to news reports, the imam of the IBS’ “As-Salaam Mosque” talked about film  maker Theo van Gogh, who was murdered in 2004 by a member of the Dutch jihadi “Hofstad  Group”. During Friday prayers, the imam stated that van Gogh had made a “dirty movie about  Islam”, and the “infidels in Holland” had now been shown that Islam was nothing to joke  cdxcii about.    At its general meeting in 2008, the association elected another convert as Aloui’s deputy  chairman in charge of public relations: Uwe Troppenz, aka Mikail, a German with a rather  checkered biography. Born in Berlin-Pankow in 1947/48, he grew up in the western part of  divided Berlin. He later moved to Schleswig-Holstein, and still later to Mecklenburg-Western  Pomerania. Before his brief Islamist career, Troppenz was involved with various right-wing  organizations. Between 1969 and 1972 he was a registered member of the German Neo-Nazi  party (NPD). Thereafter, he joined the “Aktion Neue Rechte” (Action of the New Right) and  various other far right-wing groups. Until 1986, he sat on the board of the “Deutsch  Europäische Studiengesellschaft” (German European Study Society), a successor organization  of the “Bund Nationaler Studenten” (Union of Nationalist Students), which was outlawed in  cdxciii 1960/61.  In 1989, he actively promoted German re-unification and, by his own  admission, became the public relations officer for the state association of the Christian  Democratic Party (CDU) in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania; he even served as a press  officer in the German Bundestag. Around 1998, after a trip to Tunisia, Troppenz converted to  Islam. He got involved in Berlin’s Muslim community, acting as the spokesperson of the  umbrella organization “Initiative Berliner Muslime” (Initiative of Muslims in Berlin,  IBMUS), which subsumes the Al-Nur Mosque and a number of other Islamist groups and is  cdxciv heavily influenced by Salafism. Some time between 2005 and 2007, he left Berlin.  In  Schwerin, Troppenz made use of his contacts in Berlin to help organize events with Axel  Ayyub Köhler, then-general secretary of the ZRM, and Ismet Misirlioglu, deputy chief of the  134    </page> <page sequence="137">    German Islamic party “Bündnis für Innovation und Gerechtigkeit” (Union for Innovation and  cdxcv Justice, BIG) and deputy director of the German branch of Islamic Relief Worldwide (IR).   Troppenz also kept in touch with Berlin’s Salafi community. In 2008 he gave a speech at the  Al-Nur Mosque in which he talked about the crimes of the Western world against humanity,  and particularly against Muslims. He encouraged Muslims not to acquiesce to injustice and  oppression, saying: “But against the imperial powers the oppressed and wretched hardly stand  a chance.” Equating the Danish cartoons of Muhammad with the anti-Semitic propaganda of  the Nazis, he warned of a campaign to annihilate the Muslims, and drew a parallel between  German media that allegedly called Islam “a cancer” to the 1995 massacre of Muslims in  Srebrenica, and the fighting in Chechnya, Iraq, Afghanistan and the Palestinian arena. Lastly,  he claimed that anti-AIDS organizations would promote the spread of HIV [among the  Muslims] through “inflammatory posters” provoking sexual intercourse outside marriage.cdxcvi  In November of the same year, Troppenz co-founded the “Koordinierungsrat der Muslime in  Mecklenburg-Vorpommern” (Coordination Council of Muslims in Mecklenburg-Western  Pomerania, KRMV). It made its first public appearance in early 2009 with the organization of  cdxcvii an anti-Israel rally in Rostock,  for which it had garnered support from many non-Muslim  NGOs including the “Rostocker Friedensbündnis” (Rostock Peace Union).cdxcviii  Four additional organizations from Greifswald, Wismar, Neubrandenburg and Rostock are  also members in the KRMV. The “Islamischer Bund in Rostock” (Islamic Union in Rostock,  IBR) is the most relevant of the four. It is headed by the Syrian-born Dr. Ahmed Maher  Fakhouri, who arrived in Germany around 1984 to further his PhD studies at the University of  Rostock. He married around the time of his graduation in 1990, and returned with his wife to  Syria in order to finish his military service. In 1992, they moved back to Germany and settled  in Rostock, where Fakhouri lives to this day. He began his professional life as a social  worker.. Soon he became a member of the Foreigners’ Assessment Council of the Hanseatic  City of Rostock, and later its president – an office he held until July 2010. In the early 1990s,  135    </page> <page sequence="138">    there was only a small makeshift prayer room for Muslims at the University of Rostock, and it  catered mostly to Syrian and Palestinian students. In 1998, Fakhouri used his close contacts in  the municipal administration to help find some barracks that could house the newly-founded  IBR, of which he became the chairman. The desire for close cooperation at the municipal  level continued, and the IBR became part of the statewide migrant federation “Migranet MV”.  The small Muslim community developed and, within a few years, plans were made to build a  more representative mosque. In 2010, the municipality of Rostock allocated a sum of €10,000  to an architecture competition amongst local students, which produced the blueprint for a new  mosque. Meanwhile, Fakhouri secured the promise of the Muslim World League to fund 75%  of the construction project once the IBR had raised the capital to cover the remaining  cdxcix costs.   The IBR is not only well connected to local NGOs and the Rostock municipality, but also to  the German Islamist and Salafi milieu. According to a report of LfV Mecklenburg-Western  Pomerania, the IBR has repeatedly propagandized for the “World Assembly of Muslim  Youth” (WAMY) and the large Islamist organization “Islamic Community Germany” (IGD).  Upon the outbreak of the “Second Intifada” in the fall of 2000, donations were collected and  transferred to the “Al-Aqsa e.V.” in Aachen, which was outlawed 2002 for supporting the  terrorist group HAMAS. Especially after the beginning of the US-led “Operation Iraqi  Freedom” in 2003,  jihad and the killing of kuffar was propagated within the facilities of the  IBR. Also in 2003, a member of the Iraqi terrorist group “Ansar Al-Islam” spent several  weeks at the IBR’s facilities before returning to Iraq, where in spring 2004 he participated in a  suicide attack that killed 100-200 people in Arbil. According to the German security agency,  since 2004, Salafi ideas have gained increasing influence within the IBR; it suggests that this  d influence will increase if the Saudi-funded mosque construction goes through.  This analysis  is corroborated by Fakhouri’s invitation to Berlin’s Abdul Adhim Kamouss to attend his  di open-mosque-day on October 3, 2011.    136    </page> <page sequence="139">    The 2008 founding of the KRMV, with Fakhouri responsible for organizational matters and  dii Troppenz, in Schwerin, for public relations,  has thus far had little impact on developments  diii in Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. The small size of the Muslim communities  and their  fluctuating membership have made cooperation difficult, virtually rendering the KRMV an  empty “label”.   In May 2010, Troppenz left the board of the IBS in Schwerin. The general assembly elected  Syrian-born Mohamed Dib Khanji (who had arrived in Germany in 1967 as a student) as  chairman in his stead. Abdelkader Aloui was elected Khanji’s deputy.div    SMT-MSR Analysis of Salafi Movement Actors in Germany  The following is an attempt to analyze a selection of German Salafi movement actors using  Social Movement Theory and the previously-developed Matrix of Salafi Reasoning to draw  conclusions about the actors’ prospective behavior. The validity of these analyses depends on  the stability of the social and political conditions in which the respective actor is embedded. If  the reality around a Salafi actor changes, it is naturally possible that this will affect his  specific picture of reality, which in turn may lead him to re-interpret his need to act in a  certain manner and, consequently, to change his behavior.  As was outlined in the research design, the sample was chosen from among typical and  maximal-diverse Salafi movement actors. Accordingly, three groups were analyzed using the  SMT-MSR approach. In cases where leading members of a group had divergent opinions on a  fundamental question, SMT-MSR analysis either used the dominant attitude within the group  regarding that question, or considered each of the varying attitudes within the group.  According to the data gathered for this analysis, in only one case was it necessary to analyze  the attitude of a leading preacher of a group separately, because his stance on a number of  questions diverged significantly from that of other members of his group. The case in  137    </page> <page sequence="140">    question is that of Pierre Vogel of EZP; in reality, Vogel’s attitudes led him to split from the  group in summer 2011.  If not otherwise cited, all of the cases refer to the most recently-recorded attitudes toward a  specific question of the actors studied.    Selected Cases  All of the three groups presented here were introduced above. They are as follows:  1) Invitation to Paradise – EZP  EZP is an officialy-registered Salafi group founded in 2006. It speaks out against  terrorist violence.  2) The True Religion – DWR  DWR is a non-registered Salafi group founded around 2005. It has repeatedly called  for jihad, and the glorification of martyrdom is a common theme in its propaganda.  3) Islamic Union Schwerin – IBS  The IBS was founded in 1993 and began to be influenced by Salafi ideas concomitant  with the rise of Salafism in Germany. It still cooperates with non-Muslim society at  the municipal level.    138    </page> <page sequence="141">    Questions of Analysis  The limited data on the attitudes of the chosen Salafi movement actors regarding specific  questions inhibits a more detailed analysis. Instead, we used four broad questions to compare  the actors’ attitudes regarding relations with non-Salafi groups and jihadi violence:    1. What is the general attitude towards the non-Sunni and non-Muslim community in  Germany?  2. What is the general attitude towards the established Sunni, non-Salafi, umbrella  organizations in Germany?  3. What is the general attitude towards Sunni organizations in the locality of the analyzed  actor?  dv 4. What is the general attitude about actors who are part of the global jihad movement?     The following shortcuts are used for these questions:  1. Attitude to non-Sunnis  2. Attitude to Sunni umbrella organizations  3. Attitude to local Sunni groups  4. Attitude to GJ    The fourth question subsumes all forms of violence, when the non-state actor uses Islamist  – dviideology to legitimize it  i.e., it includes terrorist acts as well as guerilla warfare.  A more  thorough analysis would have required distinguishing the Salafi actors’ attitudes towards  dvii different jihadi actors and their targets.  A lack of relevant data necessitated a generalized  dviii consideration of the overall stance on current Islamist violence.     Invitation to Paradise – EZP  139    </page> <page sequence="142">    EZP is one of the two main, trans-regional Salafi organizations in Germany. Its leaders, Sven  Lau and Muhamed Ciftci, were born in Germany and have a native German and Turkish  background, respectively. They therefore provide the cultural sensitivity and language  capabilities necessary for recruiting adherents from within the largest segment of German  society (native Germans) and the largest segment of German Muslims (Germans who are or  descended from Turkish migrants). In addition, Ciftci obtained Islamic credentials through his  studies in Saudi Arabia, and benefits from his father’s leading position in the IGMG, which  provdides him with contacts and lends a measure of credibility within the Turkish Islamist  community in Germany. EZP’s liaison to Vogel also boosted its influence. Thanks to his  charismatic appeal, Vogel regularly draws audiences of several hundred, mostly young,  Muslims.  EZP had its own infrastructure in Brunswick and Munchengladbach. However, it was Vogel’s  touring the country, in particular, that provided EZP with wide influence at several mosques  in the Ruhr area, as well as in other parts of the country. The two cities in which EZP had its  main branches each have a Muslim population of between 3% and 6%, out of a total  dix population of roughly 250,000.  Even though EZP hds some contact with other Sunni  organizations, its local influence was rather limited.  EZP owned a publishing house, enabling it to distribute not only online propaganda but also  print media, which can be found in mosques around the country. EZP organized annual hajj  tours (pilgrimages), and this enabled its leaders to keep in personal contact with Salafis in  Saudi Arabia and thus with potential donors. For example, in January 2011, when EZP was  still hoping to build a new mosque in Munchengladbach, Lau posted on its website that a  dx foreign donor had been found to cover the remaining costs of construction.  Other sources of  income were sales of its own publications and of donated books from Saudi Arabia as well as  domestic sources, and the fees for the Islamic courses offered by Ciftci (paid via PayPal).  140    </page> <page sequence="143">    Since the majority of EZP’s following was young and less financially affluent, its financial  resources seemed nevertheless to be limited.   While Salafism was hardly noticed until a few years ago, an increasing number of media  reports on the Salafi movement in Germany have been published. This has exposed a larger  audience to the movement’s propaganda, especially given its strong online presence and that  of similar groups, which are easily be found by anyone following up on a news report. At the  same time, such reports have influenced public opinion against Salafi communities in  Germany. This impeded EZP’s efforts to expand its facilities in Munchengladbach, and also  led an increasing number of mosques and private owners of meeting venues to disinvite EZP  preachers, and withold infrastructure for Salafi events (either due to an honest dislike of  dxi Salafism or out of tactical considerations).  Established Muslim associations in Germany  usually tried to keep their distance from EZP, due to strong ideological competition with  Salafi groups, in general. EZP had repeatedly tried to attract members of the IGMG and from  the more moderate DITIB. According to Dantschke, EZP had run whole campaigns against  the latter organization, in particular, in an attempt to show the latter’s Islamic teachings to be  dxii deviant as regards belief and practice.     1. Attitude to non-Sunnis  EZP considered the non-Muslim mainstream, as well as non-Sunni Muslim denominations, to  be kuffar that will receive divine punishment and eternally dwell in hell. This attitude was not  merely a theoretical consideration; rather, it was an immanent part of the group’s propaganda.  The rejection experienced in Munchengladbach, and the mainstream media, did not cause but  certainly augmented this perception.  EZP’s attitude oscillated between Medinan and Meccan Exclusion. While it did not call for  violence, EZP – especially under Vogel – had portrayed itself as haunted by a non-Muslim  mainstream, and had cautioned its following to prepare for a final clash. However, because  141    </page> <page sequence="144">    Salafism is still marginalized in Germany, and because there are advantages to working  within the legal system and avoiding criminal prosecution, EZP had had strong incentives for  moderating its activities against non-Sunnis.    2. Attitude to Sunni umbrella organizations  EZP claimed to be boycotted by Germany’s large Muslim umbrella organizations, which it  dxiii accused of bowing to political pressure.  Although  at times it denounced these  organizations as deviants, EZP generally avoided making accusations of takfir.  There was a certain discrepancy in EZP’s approach to Sunni groups in Germany. While it  seemed to have no desire for official cooperation, it did maintain many contacts at the  individual and community levels. Ciftci, in particular, claims to be open to cooperating with  everybody in Brunswick, even though time constraints and limited resources are actual  impediments to this. This Meccan inclusiveness towards local Muslims allows for individual  contacts between Sunni SMOs in Brunswick, and for multi-group membership. Ciftci’s strong  standing as a local Islamic scholar and his unrivalled appeal amongst young Muslims explains  this Meccan Inclusionary behavior at the local level: Although Ciftci is unlikely to lose  adherents to Sunni competitors, he keeps the threshold low so that interested people can  attend Salafi activities. In addition, Ciftci focuses much of his ability on trans-regional events  and online propaganda, which is why a local feud in Brunswick would likely harm his cause  more than it would benefit it. However, Ciftci takes a Meccan Exclusivist stance vis-à-vis the  large, established Sunni-organizations in Germany, in part because he aims to call their  members to the “true” path of Islam, and in part because he shows little tolerance for  diverging ideas.    3. Attitudes to local Sunni groups  142    </page> <page sequence="145">    EZP had tried to keep the peace with local Sunni groups. Even though it considered the creed  of other groups to be flawed in many ways, it did not usually engage in verbal assaults or  other offensive action against Sunni organizations in Brunswick or Munchengladbach.  Especially in reaction to the legal proceedings against it, EZP had stressed its commonality  with them, of being Muslim. In several cases, Salafis close to EZP have also held membership  in other Sunni organizations, where they promoted a Salafi-friendly attitude.    4. Attitude to GJ  EZP has rejected GJ terrorist attacks and has repeatedly spoken out against them. However,  the group did not engage in open confrontation with Salafi groups that do hold militant views.  On the contrary, it invited preachers who propagate anti-Semitism and call for violence, and  dxiv featured them on its website.     All four attitudes of EZP are presented in Tab.7 within the MSR.     Tab.7 MSR for Invitation to Paradise  MSR  for Exclusion Inclusion  EZP  4  3  2  1       The True Religion – DWR  143    Medinan Meccan  </page> <page sequence="146">    DWR is the second major Salafi organization in Germany. It is not officially registered or  formally organized. DWR does not own facilities, although it frequently meets at mosques all  over Germany, with a focus on Bonn and the greater Rhein-Main region – the area with the  largest number of Muslims in Germany, which is also home to DWR’s preachers. About  30,000 Muslims live in Bonn, most of them in the Tannenbusch neighborhood; in other words  a total 9% of the residents of Bonn are Muslim; the percentage in Tannenbusch is around  dxv 30%.   Even though no exact data is available, it appears that the influence of Salafism in Bonn is  significant. For years, the city has hosted a vibrant community of Salafis, many of whom are  open to the ideas of jihadi militancy. One reason Bonn became attractive to Salafis is the local  King Fahd Academy. The academy, which is overseen by the Saudi embassy, was established  in 1995. In 2003, German authorities embarked on an investigation, which ultimately revealed  multiple ties between the academy and terrorism suspects, as well as abundant evidence that  one of the academy’s imams had been promoting jihad, and that the school had been teaching  hatred of Jews, Christians and the West and encouraging students to sacrifice their lives for  Islam. Local officials tried to shut down the academy complex. However, in an effort to  protect German-Saudi relations, the German foreign ministry intervened, leading to an  arrangement in which the school had to change its schoolbooks and submit to tighter  dxvi controls.   Neverteless, Bonn has maintained its appeal for the Salafi milieu. In 2005, groups from  Hamburg’s Al-Quds Mosque and from the former MKH in Ulm relocated to Bonn, further  prone camp among the city’s Salafis.dxviibolstering the jihad-   At the time of writing there are nine mosques in Bonn. Salafi thought is dominant in at least  five of them: the King Fahd Academy; the Al-Muhajirin Mosque; the Al-Muhsinin Mosque;  the Ar-Rahma Mosque; and the As-Sonnah Mosque, all of which are known for their close  affiliation with DWR. At least two more mosques – the Al-Ansar Mosque and the facilities of  144    </page> <page sequence="147">    the IGMG, “Bonner Moscheegemeinschaft” (Mosque Community Bonn) – are subject to  dxviii Salafi influence and are recommended by the German Salafi web forum Ahlu-Sunna.com.   This makes Bonn the city with the highest density of Salafi infrastructure in Germany. Some  of the above-named mosques are the preferred places of worship for local jihadi militants,  who have also spent time in AQ and IMU training camps, primarily in the Federal  dxix Administered Tribal Area (FATA) along the border between Pakistan and Afghanistan.   Some of them have quickly climbed the hierarchy within those organizations, and were or are  still important to those terrorist groups’ propaganda efforts. One such jihadi from Bonn was  Bekay Harrach, who was in contact with Muslim militants before eventually joining AQ in  Pakistan. In 2003, Harrach was wounded in clashes with Israeli security forces in the West  Bank. After recovering, he went to Iraq where he contacted local insurgents; however, he was  arrested and sent back to Germany. Since the Ar-Rahma Mosque found none of this  objectionable, he served as deputy chairman of its legal body, the “Verein Deutscher Muslime  Bonn” (Association of German Muslims in Bonn), between 2006 and 2007.dxx It is worth  noting that the head of this mosque was former EIJ leader Abdel Akher Hammad, who had  been sentenced to death in Egypt on terrorism charges but granted political asylum in  Germany. Whilst in Bonn, he served as both imam of the Ar-Rahma Mosque and a leader of  EJI’s precursor organization, the Egyptian Al-Jamaa Al-Islamiyya, in which capacity he  granted an interview to Al-Jazeera. In 2007, an Egyptian court revoked his death sentence,  and Hammad returned home. Since the ouster of Mubarak, Hammad has preferred democratic  elections as the way to Islamize Egyptian society. He continues to call for attacks against  dxxi Israel.   There are numerous cases of Salafis from Bonn being tied to jihadi enterprises around the  world. For the most part, these cases involve recruits who support or have joined AQ or its  affiliates in Central Asia. It also includes a support network for Somalia’s Ash-Shabab  dxxii militias.   145    </page> <page sequence="148">    Given this comparably large milieu of Muslims inclined to Salafi ideas, DWR finds that Bonn  offers a sizable pool of potential supporters and an environment friendly to its confrontational  course.   Apart from Vogel, who only recently re-united with DWR, its preachers are of Arab origin  and have long-standing family-ties to the local Salafi milieu. One preacher, Said el-Emrani,  aka Abu Dujana, is the son of Sheikh Al-Araby, the imam of the local Al-Muhajirin Mosque  which was founded in 1997 by Arab men in their late 30s and 40s with multiple family ties to  the Arab world. For planned construction work, which will make Al-Muhajirin the biggest  mosque in Bonn, it seems DWR has secured a €1 million donation from a private donor from  dxxiii the UAE.  DWR is well established at most of Bonn’s mosques. Its preachers hold regular  dxxiv sermons, Islamic courses for children and adults, and other dawa events.   Due to its informal organization, DWR is much less vulnerable to state prosecution. It can  draw support from the radical milieu in the Rhein-Main region while relying on inter-personal  ties, rather than formalized relationships, to use local mosque infrastructure. This  “arrangement” also gives mosque administrators enough flexibility to present their facilities  as moderate places of worship, while plausibly denying any cooperation with known Salafi- jihadi scholars.  DWR has its own internet presence and by late 2011, operated the most popular Salafi  dxxv website in Germany.   Numerous Salafi mosques in Bonn and surroundings provide a social network, which remains  either supportive of or by and large indifferent towards aggressive Salafi propaganda. Thus,  DWR can draw on existing sentiment pools within its audience for further Salafi  radicalization, without having to fear significant opposition from the Muslim community. The  “Rat der Muslime in Bonn” (Council of Muslims in Bonn, RMB) plays an important role in  this regard. It organizes almost all of Bonn’s Muslim associations on a common platform,  dxxvi including the Salafi mosques.    146    </page> <page sequence="149">    Purportedly established in reaction to the controversy surrounding the Danish cartoons  lampooning Muhammad in 2006, the RMB’s founding father was the Turkish-German  businessman Haluk Yildiz, who has lived in Bonn since 1993 and held German citizenship  since 1997 – the same year in which he grew religiously observant. The RMB claims to strive  for public acceptance of Islam and the protection of Islamic identity. One of its major  objectives is the construction of new facilities for the Salafi-dominated Al-Muhajirin Mosque  dxxvii in the Tannenbusch neighborhood of Bonn.   The RMB has repeatedly denied any serious problem of Islamic radicalism in Bonn. When  asked about AQ militant Bekay Harrach, who had served as deputy chairman of one of the  RMB’s member organizations, “Deutsche Muslime Bonn” (German Muslims Bonn), and, as  noted, participated in militant activities in Israel and Iraq, Yildiz claimed that Harrach could  at times be a “hothead”, and that his organization had tolerated Harrach’s fighting in the Near  dxxviii East for the Muslim cause.  When in early 2011 the Ministry of the Interior in North- Rhine Westphalia decided to bolster the police office in Bonn due to the growing radical  milieu there, Yildiz declared the decision an exaggeration and suggested, alternatively, openly  dxxix approaching known Islamists.   By talking down the problem of jihadi trends in Bonn and openly cooperating with local  Salafi groups, the RMB provides legitimacy to the whole Salafi network. Members of the  RMB who are well-established municipally, including on the Bonn city council, wield some  influence in local politics. In 2009, Yildiz founded a voters’ association, the “Bündnis für  Frieden &amp; Fairness” (Union for Peace and Fairness, BFF), based on existing RMB  organizational structures. It ran in the municipal elections and secured two mandates in city  hall. In 2010, a BFF sister-organization, “Bündnis für Bonn” (Union for Bonn), won three out  dxxx of seven mandates on the municipal council for integration.   Even though the BFF did not openly promote an Islamist or even decisively Islamic agenda in  its campaign many in the Salafi circles of Bonn saw it as an “Islamic alternative” in the  147    </page> <page sequence="150">    elections. Prior to the election the Salafi website way-to-allah.com published an  announcement in which the BFF is introduced as a new voters’ union of Muslims. In order to  canvass Muslim voters from the openly anti-democratic spectrum, the announcement explains  that  local Salafi scholars – among them Abdel Akher Hammad from the Ar-Rahma Mosque;  an imam from the Al-Muhsinin- and the Al-Ansar Mosque; and Mohamed Benhsain – have  confirmed the legality of the elections and lists these preachers as contacts in case of further  dxxxi questions.   In several online clips, DWR preacher Emrani gives his account of BFF’s strategy, in which  he reluctantly acknowledges the legitimacy of the political enterprise, while simultaneously  casting doubt on the Islamic purity of BFF members. Emrani explains that during the runup to  the elections, BFF went to Bonn’s mosques and asked their imams for fatwas in support of it.  Emrani complains that the candidates had never approached the Salafi sheikhs Abdel Akher  Hammad, Sheikh Muhammad and especially his father, Sheikh Al-Arabi because, as Emrani  remarks ironically, they were “too hard, too radical.” He then explains his opinion of  democratic elections, which he claims is in line with the above-named Salafi sheikhs from  Bonn, as well as with Saudi Sheikh Abdurrahman bin-Nasir Al-Barak. He then quotes the  latter’s fatwa on the subject: In an Islamic country, Qur’an and Sunna need to be the sole  source of government and, therefore, elections are haram (forbidden). However, in a non- Islamic country like Germany, to run for office or vote in elections is allowed if certain  conditions are met. Firstly, the candidates for whom a Muslim votes must work to benefit  Islam once they assume office. Secondly, these candidates must be honest and decent  Muslims, knowledgeable about Islam, and run for office only for the sake of Islam. Thirdly, it  must be certain that once the candidates assume office a) they will not commit a sin like  shaking a woman’s hand or attending a Christmas party; b) they will not violate tawhid, i.e.  adopt democratic principles with conviction or make declarations to that end; and c) they will  not agree with any judgment that contradicts sharia. Emrani explains that if these conditions  148    </page> <page sequence="151">    can be met at all in Germany, it is only in municipal elections. Even though he advises  Muslims in Bonn not to vote, just to be “on the safe side,” he argues that it is legitimate in  principle to participate in elections after considering the stated conditions – a stance for which  dxxxii he was criticized by many Salafis on online forums.   Emrani also takes great pains to point out that the approval of the Salafi sheikhs covers only  the specific elections in Bonn. His position balances his defense of his father and other older  preachers (who for their part try to keep the peace with BFF/BIG members in the RMB) with  his own radical, anti-democratic following.  A sizable community of Muslims, significant sentiment pools favoring an offensive Salafi  Islam, the activity of numerous mature Salafi scholars, and the possibility of cooperation with  well-established local Sunnis all provide DWR with the political opportunity to mobilize for  its cause.    1. Attitude to non-Sunnis  DWR’s attitude towards non-Sunnis is a clear Medinan Exclusion. In the name of al-wala wa- l-bara, DWR preachers demand a far-reaching separation from non-Muslims wherever  possible. Denigration and verbal abasement of the infidels is a core theme of DWR’s  propaganda.    2. Attitude to Sunni umbrella organizations  By and large, DWR frowns on even those Sunni umbrella organizations in Germany that are  dominated by Islamists, accusing them of bowing to the pressure of the kuffar and sacrificing  Islamic ideals for the sake of integrating into an infidel society. Yet despite occasional  rumblings about these umbrella organizations, DWR refrains from declaring takfir on specific  dxxxiii Muslim functionaries.   Therefore, DWR’s attitude in this regard can be considered one of  Meccan Exclusion, with a tendency towards a Medinan Exclusivist stance.   149    </page> <page sequence="152">      3. Attitudes to local Sunni groups  Even though DWR treats other, non-Salafi Sunni groups in Bonn with some contempt, it  rarely speaks out against them. Conversely, DWR’s preachers appear at most of Bonn’s  mosques, and often stress the need for unity amongst Muslims in order to stand strong against  Western society. Abu Dujana’s vindication of Muslims in Bonn who favor the political ideas  of BFF and BIG is the perhaps best example of DWR’s attempt to shepherd decent  relationships with other groups in Bonn.    4. Attitude to GJ  DWR is the most popular Salafi group in Germany to be openly supportive of global jihadi  groups. Its preachers have repeatedly spoken of the nobility of dying for the sake of Allah.  They have co-organized events with other jihad-prone Salafis, and celebrated the jihad- anthems of Denis Cuspert. When it comes to the jihadi struggle against non-Muslim  countries, DWR has shown some tolerance of other Salafis’ lack of Islamic education or  erroneous statements, for the sake of maintaining a united front against the infidels. Its  attitude towards global jihad actors is thus one of Medinan Inclusion.    The four attitudes of DWR are presented in Tab.8 within the MSR.     Tab.8 MSR for The True Religion  MSR  for Exclusion Inclusion  DWR  2 3  150    Meccan  </page> <page sequence="153">    1 4      Islamic Union Schwerin – IBS  Of the three cases analyzed here, the IBS plays only a marginal role in the Salafi movement in  Germany as a whole. However, it does present a case of a Salafi-dominated Muslim  organization very different to those of EZP and DWR.  Until 2006, the IBS was the only Muslim organization in Schwerin. To date, it is still the only  Sunni group there. Its chairman, Khanji, claims it has some 60 active members, most of them  from Iraq and many of them from Algeria. However, the community also includes native  Germans and people of other nationalities.  Considering the small size of Schwerin’s community, the IBS is rather well organized and  connected at the municipal level and to the Salafi community. It has organized a number of  events with Salafi preachers, as well as with prominent members of Germany’s Muslim  umbrella organizations. It is formally a member of the local inter-religious forum. Khanji  excuses its rare presence at this forum’s meetings as being due to a lack of manpower, and the  overlap of these events with times of Islamic prayer. The IBS has not engaged in public dawa  activities in Schwerin.  The material resources of the IBS are limited. Its mosque facilities are very basic, and it  laments its monthly struggle to pay rent and bills. This lack of resources is partially  compensated for by the use of print media issued by other German Salafi groups, and books  donated from Saudi Arabia. Even its Friday sermons are often copied from online sources  such as the website of Neil bin Radhan, a Salafi preacher from Heilbronn, who was educated  dxxxiv in Saudi Arabia.   151    Medinan  </page> <page sequence="154">    The municipality of Schwerin has little experience with Islamists, and even less with Salafis.  This leads to a political climate in which the IBS is hardly criticized or confronted for its  ideology.  The small size of the community, however, also makes it necessary for IBS members to come  into contact with the mainstream population. An isolated Muslim community in a  neighborhood offering social infrastructure that caters to Muslims is hardly possible.  Similarly, at work, members of the IBS usually have to deal with many non-Muslims.    1. Attitude to non-Sunnis  Despite sharing a Salafi disdain for other religions and atheists, the IBS officially welcomes  participation in inter-faith events, and declares itself to be open to discussions with non- Muslims. However, its representatives often hold the opinion that society does not want to  integrate them, but rather to assimilate them. In IBS members’ statements, the main  antagonist is not non-Muslim mainstream society, but politicians and the state in general. This  attitude to non-Sunnis is Meccan Exclusion.    2. Attitude to Sunni umbrella organizations  The IBS held an event with Axel Ayyub Köhler from the ZMD, and still features a link on its  website to that organization. However, Khanji also stresses that the IBS wants to retain its  autonomy. Speaking at an event held jointly with Pierre Vogel, Uwe Troppenz – head of the  IBS’ As-Salaam Mosque –  focused on the alleged problems and injustices faced by Muslims  in Germany, but did not mention any of the other Salafi exclusionary themes, such as  opposition to the improper creed or praxis of Sunni Muslims. The general attitude of the IBS  can thus be determined to be Meccan Inclusion.    3. Attitude to local Sunni groups  152    </page> <page sequence="155">    Since the IBS is the only Sunni group in Schwerin, question 3 cannot strictly be answered.  However, the IBS has friendly relationships with the few Sunni organizations throughout  Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania.    4. Attitude to GJ  Even though the IBS offers few statements on current events, on several occasions IBS  representatives played up the narrative of an evil Western world that oppresses, persecutes  and discriminates against Muslims, and against which resistance would be justified. The only  pamphlet that the IBS features on its websites, which was written by Uwe Troppenz, features  similar sentiments. However, the wrongdoing is blamed not so much on German society as a  whole but rather on politicians, the media, German security services, American military in  Germany, Jewish-American businessmen, former President George W. Bush, the West in  dxxxv general, Russia, the GDR, and the decay of morality.  All of these stereotypes tap into  sentiment-pools of prejudice that are common to non-Muslims and Muslims alike. Troppenz  even spells this out, when he reads a list of “what should make us all – whether Muslim,  – raid”.dxxxviChristian or Atheist  af   One can thus determine that the IBS’ attitude to global jihad is one of Meccan Exclusion,  even though there are tendencies within the group to stress the evil and violence of the  Western world, which repeat the basic arguments of jihadi groups.     Tab. 9 shows the attitude structure of IBS within the MSR.    Tab.9 MSR for Islamic Union Schwerin  MSR  for Exclusion Inclusion  IBS  153    </page> <page sequence="156">      1 2  4 (3)           A Comparative Perspective  These brief SMT-MSR analyses of EZP, DWR and the IBS have highlighted the socio- political environment in which these groups are embedded, and their attitudes towards non- Salafi and jihadi actors. Although it is not possible to point out strict causality between a  group’s socio-political condition and its behavior, it is possible to find a relationship between  the two, inasmuch as a group’s environment remains neutral towards certain behavior, while  gratifying or sanctifying others. A Salafi group that has the opportunity to use the resources of  non-Salafi groups, will find it beneficial not to attack those non-Salafi groups, whilst another  group that is in competition with non-Salafi groups would find similar behavior detrimental to  its course. Although the incentives are clear in both cases, we cannot deduce the behavior of  the respective Salafi group with absolute certainty. Firstly, there are many more incentives  and disincentives for certain behavior, which must be considered. Secondly, the fixation on  tawhid can lead to complete disregard for the practical consequences of behavior, setting an  dxxxvii abstract of total obedience to God as the motivation for action.    However, to the extent that the Salafi movement responds to the incentive structure of its  socio-political environment, a comparative perspective on a number of Salafi organizations,  their environment and behavior can be beneficial to an understanding of what affects Salafi  154    Medinan Meccan  </page> <page sequence="157">    behavior and can thus ultimately provide us with a more precise understanding of the  conditions that promote or inhibit Salafi radicalization and de-radicalization.  The MSR tables for EZP, DWR and the IBS are combined in Tab.10: blue represents the  values of EZP, red those of DWR, and dark purple those of the IBS.    Tab. 10 – Merged MSR for EZP/DWR/IBS  EZP  DWR Exclusion Inclusion  IBS  1  2  22  333  44  11 4      The merged MSRs of all three groups put their features into perspective. More than two-thirds  of the behavioral choices studied lie in the Meccan category. DWR is the most radical of the  groups, in its approval of (4) global jihad. The IBS is the only group whose behavioral  choices all fall into the Meccan category. This comparison also highlights similarities among  the groups on specific issues: All three groups practice Meccan Inclusionary behavior towards  (3) local Sunni groups. While EZP and DWR behave in an exclusionary manner towards (2)  Muslim umbrella organizations, without declaring takfir on them, the IBS takes an  155    Medinan Meccan  </page> <page sequence="158">    inclusionary stance toward umbrella organizations. It is also the only group to maintain a  more moderate view of non-Sunnis.  The attitudes of DWR and the IBS only coincide in regards of (3) local Sunni groups. EZP  matches the IBS’ principal distance from actors of (4) global jihad, while its attitudes towards  (3) local Sunni groups and (1) non-Sunnis coincide with those of DWR.  Identifying identical attitudes among Salafi actors can help us evaluate the chance of future  cooperation among them. Naturally, factors such as geographic proximity, overlapping  membership, and relationships among leaders must also be considered in making such  predictions. Nevertheless, the MSR can identify opportunities for cooperation, or – when  applied to factions within a group – chances of a split within a group.  Furthermore, reviewing the SMT for each group and putting it into a comparative perspective  allows us to determine which factor relates to which attitude. A sample of three groups is  certainly too small to draw generalizable conclusions. A future study, however, could analyze  a much larger sample in an effort to identify similarities among Salafi actors and, in a second  step, examine the socio-political environment of these similar actors in order to find  correlations between the material conditions of the Salafi movement and its attitudes and  behavior.  Thus, the MSR approach is also suitable for use in quantitative data analysis, in cases where  reliable data can be obtained for a set of questions and a large number of Salafi actors.      Summary and Conclusions  This study has aimed to develop a new and more adequate framework for the analysis of  Salafi behavior, one that accounts for diverse behavior inside the movement and towards  outside actors. It has been argued that SMT is an appropriate tool for understanding the socio- political conditions of the Salafi movement, but that a new framework had to be developed in  156    </page> <page sequence="159">    order to understand how a Salafi view of reality is translated into the terminology of Salafi  ideology, and thus becomes the basis for the ideology of a specific group, faction or current  within the broader Salafi movement.    Contribution of the Salafi Framing Dilemma to SMT  During the course of this analysis, an aporia within Salafism has been identified: a  contradiction between a tawhid- and an umma-theme, which both provide the motives  underlying Salafi reasoning.  This aporia is not a mere creation of Salafi thought. Rather, it is the expression of an attempt  to overcome what we have called a framing dilemma – a problem not peculiar to Salafism. An  idea, identical in itself, cannot be realized identically but only through its manifestation in  matter. Matter, indispensable for realization of the idea, spoils the idea at the moment of its  realization, because the idea cannot be realized in-itself, but only as something that is not the  idea – i.e. reality.  However, Salafism pretends that its concept of tawhid  could become unmediated reality This  problem is exacerbated by the intentional vagueness of sharia – that is, the Islamic decrees  and precedents that supposedly present an impeccable guide to the implementation of the  Islamic idea, but which in fact provide the basis for essentially arbitrary judgments.  The refusal of Salafism to reflect upon its inherent contradictions begets a need to find a  different explanation for the shortcomings of Islamic praxis. Salafism holds Islam to be  nothing but the only way for men to live according to God’s will, and in perfect harmony with  the universe that He has created. Everything and anything that disturbs this harmony is  therefore not Islam and against Islam, by definition. This is why all the tales of Jinn, devils  and the evil powers trying to destroy Islam are no accident, but rather an intrinsic part of  Salafism, the strict result of forcing identity in the concepts of tawhid and Islam.  157    </page> <page sequence="160">    Salafi thinking is unable to reflect upon its immanent contradiction between tawhid and  umma, because its very premise is that there can be no such contradiction. Similarly,  Salafism’s answer to the framing dilemma is to refuse to accept that there is any such  dilemma. The striving for an ideologically rigid, pure tawhid amounts to the advancement of  the umma’s power in this world. But because this is not possible, the Salafi movement must  constantly redefine what it is that constitutes the one and only true way of Islam, based on a  changing socio-political situation, and while blaming evil forces from without and traitors  from within for the failure to establish the perfect Islamic society. Herein lies the reason why  Salafi ideology necessarily re-enforces the movement’s characteristics as an enclave culture.  The Salafi enclave constitutes itself in the perpetual process of identifying an enemy. This  enemy is absolute, in the sense that there must be such an enemy, irrespective of whether or  not there is a real actor hostile to the Salafi movement. In its most benign form, Salafism still  needs the concept of Satan, but dispenses with identifying who his evil forces are in the real  world (for the time being). Even then, the identification of real world actors as forces of Satan  is only in a state of latency. It can become manifest as soon as the socio-political conditions  change so as to lead the movement to aggressive behavior towards what it perceives to be an  evil and hostile outside world.  It appears that SMT, in general, could benefit from the study of the Salafi solution to the  framing dilemma as a case illustration of a movement ideology that inhibits the conscious  realization of the dilemma, and reacts by projecting everything controversial onto the outside  world. Such behavior could be compared to other types of social movement, as a means of  studying fundamental ideological differences and of identifying deep similarities among  social movements which, on the surface, may appear radically different. This would be  especially fruitful for an understanding of transitions of membership among different social  dxxxviii movements with strong in-group solidarity and hatred of the out-group.     158    </page> <page sequence="161">    Answer to Third Research Question  As a second step in the extrapolation of a new framework for the analysis of Salafi  movements, it has been shown that the religious sources of Salafism essentially justify a  defensive or Meccan mode of behavior, and an offensive or Medinan mode. This reasoning,  and the behavior to which it leads, have been conceptualized in a Matrix of Salafi Reasoning,  MSR, and applied to three Salafi actors in Germany. Despite severe shortcomings, the  dxxxix analysis  provides an understanding of the importance of combining SMT and the MSR  approach for research and intelligence analysis. Through SMT, the analyst can understand  which conditions factor into the Salafi movement’s behavior; and through MSR, the analyst  can show how these conditions are translated into Salafi terminology, where they become the  basis for particular ideological currents within the movement.  Thus, we are finally able to answer the third research question regarding the prospects for the  conceptualization of Salafi behavior and its contribution to the study of Salafism in Germany.  Given that a future SMT-MSR analysis of Salafism in Germany will utilize a more thorough  set of more precise questions, and a much larger sample of Salafi groups (including foreign  groups), SMT-MSR analysis will then 1. allow for a comprehensive, comparative perspective  on Germany’s Salafi movement and its main actors; 2. enable the researcher to identify the  likelihood of cooperation and conflict among or within Salafi groups and networks; and 3.  provide the basis for a systematic study of factors of radicalization and de-radicalization.     Prospects for the Use of MSR in Quantitative Data Analysis  Given that an analysis of the Salafi movement, or parts thereof, would have access to  comprehensive, reliable intelligence on movement actors, a set of relevant research questions  could be assembled and answers given according to the four categories suggested by the MSR  approach – Meccan Exclusion, Meccan Inclusion, Medinan Exclusion and Medinan Inclusion  – as has been exemplified in this thesis using three German Salafi movement actors. In this  159    </page> <page sequence="162">    way, intelligence about the Salafi movement may be transformed into nominal variables,  thereby facilitating a comparative study of a large number of Salafi movement actors.  It has been suggested that, from a national security perspective, the four categories of MSR  assume a quantifiable feature that derives from a biased view of the Salafi movement, viz. the  desire to 1. minimize it in size and limit its resources and power and 2. pacify it and force it  into the Meccan mode. In this regard, there are sufficient grounds for the operationalization of  the MSR conceptualization, which treats the four categories of Salafi behavior as ordinal  variables, with Meccan Exclusion as the most preferable and Medinan Inclusion as least  preferable variable. In such a case, however, it would be a crucial, and an essentially political,  decision which position Meccan Inclusion and Medinan Exclusion would assume – that is,  whether moderate, pragmatic behavior that eschews open hostility but bolsters the power base  of a Salafi group is preferable to openly hostile behavior that simultaneously alienates  potential support groups.  This question would be hard to answer in the abstract. It will very much depend on the  condition of the respective Salafi group or movement. If a group’s strength and ability to  harm society is minimal, then Medinan Exclusion behavior would likely be preferable to  Meccan Inclusion behavior, because the group would be likely to be motivated to cause harm  but have limited capacity to do so and poor prospects for extending its power base. In an  opposite scenario, a Salafi group with a large membership and well-established support  networks might better be contained by a policy that creates an incentive-disincentive structure  that would cause the group to choose Meccan Inclusion behavior rather than Medinan  Exclusion behavior, in which it would be more likely to use its already significant ability in  an openly aggressive manner.  Despite the intriguing opportunities for quantitative research that such an ordinal use of the  MSR categories would allow, a number of problems would first have to be taken into  consideration. Perhaps the most important of these is the assumption that exclusionary  160    </page> <page sequence="163">    behavior necessarily leads to the net loss of a group’s power by alienating potential  supporters. Reviewing the success of Salafism, it appears that much of its appeal stems from  the rigor with which traditional Muslim authorities are rejected and from the movement’s re- clamation of Islamic identity. In Germany, for example, it would have made no sense for the  first Salafi preachers to cooperate with other Islamic groups (even though many of their goals  overlapped), because the latter had already lost credibility in the eyes of many young  Muslims: the prime target audience of Salafi propaganda. In this scenario, offensive  propaganda against established Islamist organizations like IGD, IGMG or ZMD not only had  an exclusionary function, but also were a major reason for the success of Salafism and the  actual recruitment of many new members to the movement. In other words, the Salafi groups  tapped into existing sentiment pools of the established organizations’ members (viz.  frustration of the young about a perceived acquiescence by these organizations to the non- Muslim mainstream).  In comparison, the application of MSR to nominal data is much less prone to complications. It  can be used to help identify points of agreement and friction among different groups, and thus  to provide the key to what influences a network, by facilitating an understanding of what  leads to cooperation among Salafi groups, and what amplifies simmering internal conflicts.  Furthermore, if used in combination with other tools of analysis, the MSR approach can  facilitate quantitative research on the causes of Salafi behavior. This would necessitate a large  sample of Salafi actors. Once similarities had been determined, the actors could be grouped in  “attitude clusters”, and each cluster examined for the socio-political conditions to which its  units are exposed, and which (might) correlate with a certain behavior. This would make it  possible to test for correlations between the socio-political conditions of the Salafi movement  and the movement’s behavior, thereby opening the door to a scientific inquiry into the causes  of Salafi radicalization and de-radicalization, politicization and retreat.    161    </page> <page sequence="164">    As promising as these prospects may be, it is no less important to bear in mind that every  theory must know its boundaries, lest it re-enact the epistemological mistake of Salafism  under the cloak of science. Salafism postulates an idea as reality, and ends up waging a war  against everything that does not conform to that idea. Science postulates an idea of reality.  The ideas and abstractions that we strip from the world in all its puzzling particularity, and  without which we could not make any sense of the world, but would have to surrender our  thinking to an inconceivable multitude of information – these very ideas tend to block our  understanding of the subject matter, if we mistake them for reality itself.      162    </page> <page sequence="165">    Notes  1  Arid Uka is an exception, inasmuch as his contacts to Salafi groups and preachers were online  acquaintances.

Gebauer, "Spuren des Airport-Killers," Spiegel Online, 4 March 2011;  Musharbash, "Falsche Freunde, echte Freunde, Facebook-Freunde," Spiegel Online, 4 March 2011.  2  Taqiy Al-Din Ahmad Ibn Taymiyya (1263-1328) was a major proponent of the Hanbalite school and  a fierce opponent of the philosophy and predominantly rationalist Islamic establishment of his time.  3  So called isnad are attributed to every Hadith. They describe the trustworthiness of one particular  Hadith depending on the chain of human narrators who transmitted it, until it was written down. There  are three categories into which the whole body of Hadith is divided: sahih (sound), hasan (fair), da’if  (weak). Cf. Guillaume, “Traditions of Islam,” 83-88.   4  There were, however, a few interruptions in Saudi rule. The First Saudi State lasted until an  Ottoman-Egyptian invasion toppled the king in 1818. In 1824, the House of Saud returned to power.  The Second Saudi State lasted until 1891. After a string of Saudi conquests starting in 1902, the Third  Saudi State was established in 1932, as The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  5  For a short summary of Wahhabi ideology cf. Blanchard, “Wahhabism and Salafiyya,” 2. A more  detailed analysis is provided in Voll, “Al-Sindi and Abd Al-Wahhab”.  6  It has already been noted that Wahhabism, despite its vocal rejection of taqlid, did rely on the  Hanbali school for legal rulings. To date, Saudi judges overwhelmingly follow Hanbali’s views in  their judgements, even though they are given the discretion to perform ijtihad. cf. Vogel “Islamic  law,” 125-126.  7  During her guest lecture at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC) on 10 Jan 2010, Prof. Ofira  Seliktar made a case in point when she described the problem of  “deception by default,” which  hampers US intelligence services from accurately assessing Islamist actors. According to Seliktar, the  CIA’s paradigm that Sunni and Shia Muslims do not collaborate prevented it from understanding  Iran’s influence in Sudan or its relationship to Osama bin Ladin, while he resided in Sudan. Seliktar  highlighted the problem of construing the unit of analysis as a unitary actor, as a major source of self- deception.  163    </page> <page sequence="166">    8  Adorno described the problem as follows: “The concept’s immanent claim is its order-creating  invariance against the change in what it covers. The form of the concept – ’false’ in this respect also –  would deny that change. [...] The concept in itself, previous to any content, hypostatizes its own form  against the content. With that, however, it is already hypostatizing the identity principle: that what our  thinking practice merely postulates is a fact in itself, solid and enduring.” Adorno, “Negative  Dialectics,” 153-154.  9  In Germany, some Salafi-dominated mosques showcase Saudi posters, which are distributed by the  German Salafi preacher Muhamad Ciftci, and which call on men to only wear trousers that don’t reach  below the ankle. They read: “Everything below the ankle is in hell fire.” This practice is known from  the “neo-Ahl Al-Hadith”, an Al-Albani inspired Salafi current in Saudi Arabia, which highlights its  influence on the German scene. The neo-Ahl Al-Hadith became dominant in Medina University in the  early 1990s. Many foreign students, including important German Salafi preachers, have studied at this  institution. – cf. Lacroix, “Between Revolution,” 72,77.  10  Cf. Wiktorowicz, “Anatomy,” 220. The Sahwa or ”Awakening” movement refers to a number of  Saudi Arabia’s non-establishment scholars, who protested the Saudi king’s decision in the early 1990s  to allow US troops on Saudi soil after Saddam Hussein invaded Kuwait and threatened the Saudi  kingdom. The Sahwa movement has its ideological roots in an amalgam of Saudi Wahhabi ideology  and the ideological heritage of the violent current of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, whose preachers  fled in great numbers to Saudi Arabia after Nasser’s Egypt began to persecute them. The most  prominent of the Saudi Sahwa Sheikhs are Salman Al-Auda and Safar Al-Hawali. For a detailed  discussion of the Saudi Sahwa movement see: Al-Rasheed, “Contesting the Saudi State”.  11 Originally active in the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood, Al-Sururi drew closer to Salafi ideology while  residing in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Relying mainly on Ibn Taymiyya and Sayyid Qutb, he  developed a distinct ideological practice termed by its adversaries “Sururiyya”. Cf. Lacroix,  “Muhammad Surur,” 435-436; Keppel, “The war for Muslim minds,” 174-177; Al-Dhaydi, “What is  the story”.  12  Salafis who want to justify their acquiescence to un-Islamic rule in the West typically argue that the  Muslim community has made a peace agreement with the majority, which it must uphold. Often they  164    </page> <page sequence="167">    invoke the Peace of Hudaybiyah between the Prophet Muhammad and the polytheist tribe of Quraish  from Mecca as an historical precedent. One article explains Allah’s commandment regarding behavior  towards non-Muslims: “To make peace with them if the Muslims are in need of making peace and  when there is an overriding benefit for the Muslims in making peace; just as the Prophet (sallal-laahu- alayhi-wasallam) made peace with the kuffaar at Hudaibiyyah.”, see “Love and Hate for the Sake of  Allaah,” Website of The Salafi Center of Manchester,  http://www.salaficentre.co.uk/articles/minhaj/correct-wala-bara-kuffar-Sheikh-fawzaan.pdf  13  It must be added, though, that large parts of these movements were oftentimes rooted in counter- cultures with a quasi-religious fervor; in other words, they, too, transcended their immediate political  objective. Cf. Shea, “Reason and the Religion”.  14  Arid Uka, who killed two US servicemen at Frankfurt International Airport, is just such a “lone  wolf”. Uka was not connected to any terrorist cell, even though he seems to have undergone a self- induced radicalization process through Salafi and jihadi online propaganda. The trigger for his plan to  attack the US Army was allegedly an online clip showing US troops storming an Afghan house and  raping the family’s daughter. This might well have been the “moral shock” that initiated the violent  action. – see: Matthias Gebauer, "Spuren des Airport-Killers," Spiegel Online, 4 March 2011.  15  Stern conceptualizes this “niche” as a “membership profile” or as “characteristics of the  organizations' members,” but focuses in her analysis on the social status and age of registered  members. Cf. Stern, “The Evolution of Social Movement Organizations,” 92, 94, 97.  16  The audiotaped interviews were provided courtesy of S.B.  17  The Salafi Preacher Pierre Vogel coined the phrase on his website: “Islam is not what Muslims do  but what they should do.” http://www.pierrevogel.co  18  Shirk describes the association of others with God and of God with attributes of his creatures.  19  Hamid considers it (next to Al-Albani’s “The Prophet’s Prayer Described”) to be the most  influential book for Salafis in the UK. Cf. Hamid, “The Attraction of ’Authentic’ Islam,” 389.  20  Phillips, “Fundamentals,” 17-18.  21  Muhammad himself faced the problem of asserting predestination while simultaneously motivating  his followers to act on their own. In a Hadith transmitted by Ali, he explained to his companions:  165    </page> <page sequence="168">    ”There is no individual from among you except that indeed his seat in paradise and his seat in Hell  have been written down for him.” The companions responded: “O messenger of Allah, then why  shouldn’t we just trust in what is already written down for us and leave off deeds?” The Prophet did  not have a clear answer for them: “Perform deeds, for every matter that has been made easy is due to  what was created for him, as for who is from the people of sa’dah (i.e. happiness/paradise), then it will  be made easy for him to do the deeds from the people of sa’dah; and as for who is from the people of  shaqawah (i.e. misery/hellfire), then it will be made easy for him to do the deeds from the people of  shaqawah.” (Cf. Bin Baz, “Al Qadaa’ wal-Qadar,” 8.) Instead of answering, Muhammad simply shifts  the attention of his followers to another question: how to determine whether they are destined for  heaven or hell.   22  Consequently, instead of applying himself to the contradiction, the former Grand Mufti of Saudi  Arabia, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz Bin Baz, just holds out the prospect for blindly accepting what cannot be  thought: “From the things that elevates the status (of the believer) is that believing in the two types of  Allah’s will comes together within the believer. Thus verily, he believed in Allah’s mashi’ah (i.e.  legislative will) as well as Allah’s universal will at the same time.” Bin Baz solution to the  contradiction is to praise the negation there was any. The Salafi answer to Kant’s motto of  enlightenment would be: “Noli sapere aude! Forfeit the courage to use your own intelligence!” (Cf.  Bin Baz, “Al Qadaa’ wal-Qadar,” 14) The German Salafi preacher Pierre Vogel talks about the same  problem in simple metaphors that bridge the gap between scholarly Islamic debate and the experiences  of his followers. He likens men to factory workers. Life, Vogel explains, is a test, whose outcome was  already written down fifty thousand years before creation. But, Vogel goes on, only unbelievers would  ask: Why then does Allah test me at all? Just as a worker in a factory does not know why or for whom  he produces a certain product, the pious Muslim does not know why he is put to trial. He lives his life  and does what he is told to do by God, just as the factory worker does what he is told to do by his  boss. All the factory worker needs to know is what exactly he has to do, and that he will earn a reward  for his work. So, too, all the Muslim needs to know is how to conform to sharia. (Cf. "Pierre Vogel -  Die Vorherbestimmung (al-Qadr) im Islam 3/3," online clip, uploaded 2 March 2011 by user  PierreVogelDe, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TsvGBnlZVA.) Vogel’s metaphor, of course, has  166    </page> <page sequence="169">    its limit: the laborer can leave his work place, go home and – if so he pleases – inquire into the  conditions, means and ends of his labor. The Salafi vision for humanity, on the other hand,  hypostatizes the state of man as a weak, petty, unconscious tool of a superior force.  23  The state-sanctioned Mu’tazilah argued that the Qur’an was in fact part of God’s creation, while the  traditionalist school argued that, “nothing which is of God is created and the Qur’an is of God.” Cf.  Lapidus, ”The Separation of State,” 380.  24  Ahmad Ibn Hanbal, the founder of the Hanbalite school of jurisprudence and theology and the most  famous scholar to stand trial during the Mihna, took a full-fledged anthropomorphic stance: “He  affirmed the divine of a human form, including face, eyes, curly hair, mouth, voice, breath, chest and  two elbows, back, arms, hands with a palm, five fingers and fingertips, legs, shin, feet, soul, physical  beauty, a limit, and even, shockingly, loins” (Williams, ”Aspects of the Creed,” 449.) Williams  concludes: “For Hanbal, to deny that God truly has a form is kufr.” Williams, ”Aspects of the Creed,”  443.  25  The doctrine of “bi-la kayfa” goes back to a narration of Malik Ibn Anas (711-795) which,  according to Abrahamov, might reflect a tradition of the Sahaba (companions of the Prophet) or even  of Muhammad himself (Abrahamov, “The Bi-la Kayfa Doctrine,” 366.): "We were with Malik when a  man asked him: ‘O Abu `Abd Allah! "The Merciful is established over the Throne" (20:5): how is His  establishment?’ Malik lowered his head and began to sweat profusely. Then he lifted up his head and  said: ‘"The Merciful is established over the Throne" just as He described Himself. One cannot ask  "how." "How" does not apply to Him. And you are an evil man, a man of innovation. Take him out!’  The man was led out." (Narrated by Ibn Wahb. Cited after: Haddad, Dr. G.F. “Imam Malik,” The As- Sunnah Foundation of America, http://www.sunnah.org/publication/khulafa_rashideen/malik.htm.)  There are a number of versions of this narration, all of which agree with Malik’s basic argument that  God’s sitting (istiwa’) on the throne is known, while its modality (al-kayf) is unknown; and that belief  in this is obligatory, while inquiring about it is an innovation (bid’a) (Cf. Shahran, “Divine  Transcendence,”4).  26  The concept of bi-la kayfa is also used by German Salafis today. Convert preacher Vogel explained:  “If we say, ’Allah is above the throne’ then we do not imagine anything. Because it is only tashbih  167    </page> <page sequence="170">    (anthropomorphism) if one associates that with a specific form. [...] We have to believe what Allah  says in the Qur’an in light of ’leysa ka mithli shey,’ nothing is like him.” (“Vortrag Pierre Vogel –  Abu Hanifa sagt – Wer leugnet das Allah über seinem Thron ist, ist ein Kafir,” online clip, uploaded  by user Hacko44English on 20 August 2011, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYsi0-XrYUw).   27 Al-Jabri notes that the Muslim gnostics, too, were well aware of the superiority “of the reasoning  method that establishes the legitimacy of the knowledge of an in absentia element, the object-to-know,  from an in-praesentia element that can be observed in the world of empirical data.” They consequently  “shielded themselves behind Shi’ism.” Cf. Al-Jabri, “Arab-Islamic Philosphy,” 50.  28  The depreciation of other beings and objects of one’s affection adds to the radical escapism of Salafi  ideology. Consequently, Salafis support the mindset of “a suicidal religious terrorist” as discussed in  Stein, “Evil as Love and as Liberation”.   29  The Salafi concepts of tawhid and purity are also most relevant on an individual level. Taqwa and  tawba are an attempt to induce a permanent state of alert in the individual believer, who conceives of  his deviant thoughts and desires as satanic temptations and who thereby externalizes them as an evil  influence from without.  30  Naturally, this “community of unbelievers” is even more imaginary than the umma. The plentitude  of religions, societies and countries only become the strict opposite of the community of believers –  that is, a community of infidels – when they are considered in light of their relationship to the umma.  31  Even though the umma features prominently in Salafi ideology as the victim of infidel attack and  suppression, the fundamental fixation of Salafism on the afterlife transforms even the hypothetical  defeat of the umma into a success because in any case victory is with God, and the pious will enter  paradise regardless of the success of the umma.  32  The term Khawarij derives from the Arabic kharaja (to leave, exit), and refers to the defection of  the Khawarij after the battle of Siffin. The members of the group are called Kharijites. After the  assassination in 656 of the third Caliph, Uthman bin-Affan, a power struggle erupted between  Muhammad’s cousin and son-in-law Ali ibn Talib and Mu’awiya bin Abi Sufyan, a member of the  Meccan Umayyad family. In 657, both leaders’ armies engaged in the inconclusive battle of Siffin,  after which Ali agreed to arbitration to settle the dispute. However, some of Ali’s own men seceded,  168    </page> <page sequence="171">    arguing  “La hukm illa lillah” – that is, that arbitration is in the hands of God alone – and declared  takfir on Ali. Ali’s force routed them that same year in a battle at Nahrawan. However, in 661 Ali fell  victim to a Kharijite assassin.  33  For example, Sheikh Salih Ibn Fawzan Al-Fawzan, member of the Permanent Committee for  Islamic Research and Fatawa, Saudi Arabia’s highest religious body likened the Sahwa-Sheikhs Al- Hawali and Al-Auda, Sayyid and Muhammad Qutb, as well as Muhammad Surur, to the Khawarij of  early Islam.  34  A case in point is made by the doctoral thesis of Saudi Sahwa Sheikh Safar Al-Hawali, in which he  calls Al-Albani a Murji’a due to his weaker position on takfir, even though Albani does not  categorically reject considering a Muslim an apostate. Unsurprisingly, Al-Albani responded by  branding Hawali a Khariji. Cf. Wiktorowicz, “Anatomy,” 232.  35  This interpretation is congruent with Qur’anic verse 2:217.”They ask you about the sacred month -  about fighting therein. Say, "Fighting therein is great [sin], but averting [people] from the way of  Allah and disbelief in Him and [preventing access to] Al-Masjid Al-Haram and the expulsion of its  people therefrom are greater [evil] in the sight of Allah. And fitnah is greater than killing." And they  will continue to fight you until they turn you back from your religion if they are able. And whoever of  you reverts from his religion [to disbelief] and dies while he is a disbeliever - for those, their deeds  have become worthless in this world and the Hereafter, and those are the companions of the Fire, they  will abide therein eternally.”  36  Another eminent Saudi scholar, Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Baz, warned against fitna in a similar fashion:  “Likewise, the Lord of Might and Majesty warned the nation of Muhammad sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa  sallam against splitting and disunity, since that is one of the greatest causes of failure and of the  enemy taking control. There is no doubt that the multitude of [differing] sects and groups in Islaamic  society is, firstly, something desired by Shaytaan and, secondly something desired by the enemies of  Islaam from amongst mankind. Since agreement and unification of the Muslims and their being aware  of the dangers which threaten them and their beliefs, will make them active in refuting and rebutting  it, and acting is a unified manner for the benefit of the Muslims – thus repelling the danger from their  religion, their lands as well as their brothers. [...] Therefore they [the enemies of Islam from amongst  169    </page> <page sequence="172">    men and jinn] are very eager to split-up the Muslims, destroy their unity and to sow the seeds of  enmity and discord between them.” (Bin Baz, “The Ideological Attack,” First Interview, First  Question). The reference to outside forces hostile to Islam and the entire umma leads to a search for a  way to mitigate internal friction in the movement. The cause of dissent is not the umma itself, but  rather an outside power that infiltrates an otherwise virtuous society. In the absence of an actual  occupier, Bin Baz coined the term “ideological attack” to describe a malicious society of infidels  insidiously poisoning the umma: “The term, ‘the Ideological Attack,’ [al-ghazwa al-fikree] is a set of  efforts, undertaken by a particular nation, in order to conquer or influence another nation, such that  [the attacked nation] is steered in a particular course of direction because of it.” This attack is “far  more serious than military warfare” because it is so subtle that the attacked nation does not defend  itself and becomes “diseased in its thoughts and senses,” [...] “It is a chronic disease, which attacks  nations, doing away with its characteristics, removing its foundations and strength. [...] “This war  takes place by means of school curriculums, general education, media, small and large size  publications, and other such channels.” (Bin Baz, “The Ideological Attack,” Second Interview, First  Question). In a different fatwa, Bin Baz names the forces he believes are behind this “ideological  attack”: Modern-day Christian “crusaders”, whose propaganda corrupts Muslim minds so that they  acquiesce to Christian rule; Jews, who “strive their utmost to corrupt [the] beliefs, morals and manners  of Muslims [...] scheme and crave after possessing the Muslim lands, as well as the lands of others”;  and finally Communists and atheists, notably Russia and China, which “tore the umma apart” and  made its Muslims “troops of Satan,” aided, of course, by Christians and Jews (Bin Baz, “The  Ideological Attack,” Second Interview, Second Question).  37  Bid’a as sinful innovation in matters of religion is nothing but a violation of tawhid, and can also be  seen as a form of kufr, taghut, or shirk – depending on the angle one chooses.  38  Nieuwenhuijze has pointed at this often-neglected fact, which sets Islam apart from Christianity and  Judaism: “It should be noted in this connection that the ummah has not been incorporated in the creed.  By pronouncing the shahadah one becomes a member of the ummah; one does not profess one’s faith  in the ummah.” Nieuwenhuijze, “The Ummah,” 18.  170    </page> <page sequence="173">    39  In this light, the history of Islam, its expansionism and simultaneous fragmentation of power seems  the practical development of its inherent aporia.  40   As far as the author is aware, no Muslim has ever declared takfir over everybody else.  Sayyid Qutb  and the groups that came to be called Takfir wa-l-Hijra certainly came closest to this practice. What  makes Salafism different from an individual paranoid psychosis is, amongst others, that the paranoia  about evil (infidel) forces is part of a group ideology, which subsumes the individual in a larger  collective, no matter how small that collective may be in reality.  41  The Islamic credo (shahada).  42  It is thus not simply a diversionary technique when registered Salafi groups in Germany declare in  their statutes that their general goal is the “furtherance of Islamic religion, culture and education”.  43  The flexibility with which the agents of evil can be identified as real people or, more anonymously,  as the invisible enemy, Satan, is noteworthy. This flexibility ensures the possibility of projecting  contradictions within the Salafi movement onto the outside world, without necessarily having to attack  mainstream society or the larger Muslim community to do so. This helps to avoid eliciting a negative  response detrimental to the Salafi movement.  44  Wiktorowicz wrote of the relationship of Salafis to rationality: ”For a Western audience, the  presentation seems almost mind numbing and lacks convincing argumentation. But it reflects the  Salafi rejection of human logic” (Wiktorowicz, ”Anatomy,” 212). It is important to note that Salafis  are not simply anti-rational, as Wiktorowicz suggests. For one, the plentitude of Salafi propaganda  distributed by the latest means of communication (websites, forums, YouTube channels, blogs, online  lectures, Facebook pages) are proof that the movement accepts the use of rational, modern tools. For  another, the rejection of human logic often remains declarative, and does not prevent the application of  rationality if it suits the purpose of the Salafi propagandist. Consider the following incident, which is  prototypical for the pragmatic use of rational argumentation by Salafis when it suits their agenda:  During a Salafi rally in the the West German city of Munchengladbach, Pierre Vogel – probably the  best-known Salafi preacher and convert to Islam in Germany – asked a number of Christian protestors  to join him on stage. A short conversation followed:  Vogel: Do you think Jesus is God?  171    </page> <page sequence="174">    Protestor: Yes.  Vogel: Is God all knowing?  Protestor: Yes.  Vogel: God is all-knowing so Jesus is all-knowing. Does God lie?  Protestor: No.  Vogel: So then Jesus does not lie. Marcus 13, Verse 32. Jesus is asked: ”When is the Day of  Judgment?” He says: ”This I don’t know nor do the angels. God alone knows.” Did he lie here or  does he not know?  Protestor: He does not know.  Vogel: He does not know? Well then he is not God. You just said yourself, God is all-knowing. The  protestor wants to answer and asks for the microphone. Vogel rejects his request, and security pushes  the young man off the stage. Vogel concludes: “We just saw the truth. This is all we need. He said  God knows everything and Jesus does not know. I really don’t want to insult any faith. We are  concerned with an objective, factual approach.” Ironically, the structure of Vogel’s argument is  exemplary of an Aristotelian categorical syllogism, where the premise is that 1. God is all-knowing  and 2.Jesus does not know the date of the Day of Judgment leads to the conclusion that 3. Jesus cannot  be God.  Aristotle: “A syllogism is an argument in which, certain things being posited, something  other than what was laid down results by necessity because these things are so.” This is only one of  many occasions on which Salafis in Germany have used formal logic to dismiss Christian doctrine  because of its alleged irrationality. But such simple logic is only welcome when it can be used against  religious adversaries. It is banned from the realm of Islamic doctrine. This is why the Salafis’  relationship to reason can best be described as “pragmatic rationality”, or “placing a pragmatic taboo  on reason”, as was hinted on pp. 40-45 of this paper. For the online clip and the citation of Aristotle  see: Aristotle, “Prior Analytics,” 2; and ”Pierre Vogel – KO 1. Runde!,” online clip, uploaded by user  habibiflo2 on 14 March 2011, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-ZJrXCM-fe0.  45  This vague idea of one monotheistic community was probably only possible due to very limited  contact with actual Christians and Jews. Cf. Watt, “Muhammad at Medina,” 314.  172    </page> <page sequence="175">    46  “Sahih Bukhari” is one of the great Hadith collections that is considered trustworthy. The other is  “Sahih Muslim”. To a certain degree, the collections of Abu Dawud and Malik are also considered  trustworthy.  47  To justify a far-reaching separation of the “true believers” from society, Maqdisi built on the older  Islamic concept of al-wala wa-l-bara (lit. loyalty and enmity), which has its pre-Islamic origins in  Arab tribal culture, and which was used in the name of Islam by the Khawarij for the first time. It was  later declared to be bid’a by Hanbali, but was subsequently rediscovered and used by Ibn Taymiyya to  fight what he called “innovations” in the Islamic umma (bid’a). The descendants of Muhammad Ibn  Abd Al-Wahhab, specifically Sulayman Ibn ‘Abdallahal-ash-Sheikh, expanded the concept to include  all relations to the kuffar, with whom they urged Muslims to avoid contact. Maqdisi finally uses al- wala wa-l-bara to call for disobedience against Muslim rulers, until nothing but the rule of God is  established in the respective country. Cf. Wagemakers, “The Transformation,” 82-87, 95.  48  Faraj was one of the leaders of the EIJ. He headed the plot to assassinate Egyptian President Anwar  Sadat in 1981, for which he was executed in 1982. Cf. Sageman, “Understanding Terror Networks,”  15, 30-33.  49  This very general formulation spawned much exegetical controversy. While some Muslim scholars  hold that the verse was abrogated by later revelations, others claim that it only applies to certain  groups of believers under certain conditions or at certain times in history. Cf. Friedmann, “Tolerance  and Coercion,” 102-106.  50  Flaig summarized the status of the dhimmi in an essay (translation from German by the author):  “The subjugated people were not allowed to bear arms, they were unable to defend themselves and  thus not fully-valued men. Their shoes and clothes had to be cut in a special way in order to  distinguish them for ridicule. Christians and Jews had to wear specific colors (the Jewish badge  derived from this discrimination). Their houses had to be smaller and their door frames lowered. They  were not allowed to ride horses, only donkeys, so that they would constantly be reminded of their  degradation. They paid a special tax (jizya), which they had to hand over in person, whereby they  received a slap on the head. They had to bow their heads to a Muslim and pass on the left. They had to  tolerate beatings from Muslims and were not allowed to defend themselves. If a dhimmi fought back,  173    </page> <page sequence="176">    his hand was cut off or he was executed. A dhimmi could not testify against a Muslim. Muslims had to  suffer only half of the usual punishment, if their crime was committed against a dhimmi, and a Muslim  could not be executed for committing an offense against a dhimmi. Conversely, the cruelest forms of  the death penalty were reserved for the dhimmis (e.g., burning at the stake, flaying).” Flaig, “Essay:  Djihad und Dhimmitude”. Regarding the inequality of Christians and Jews under Muslim rule see  also: Ye’or, “The Decline”.  51  The pragmatic relationship of Salafism to rationality and logic has already been discussed. The term  “reasoning” can thus only be applied in a very limited sense: as thinking about contemporary issues by  identifying these issues with commandments and incidents from early Islamic history. Jabri calls this a  “fundamentalist reading” of history: “The future is subject to a reading that is based on the  interpretation of the past, but not the past as it actually happened but the ‘past as it should have been.’  But because there never was such a past outside of the imagination, the perception of a coming future  was never able to distinguish itself from the idea of a future related to the past. [...] The  fundamentalist reading bases on a religious understanding of history in which history is but a moment  that stretches into the present, into the emotional life ...” Hence, the Matrix of Salafi Reasoning  describes a reasoning without reason. Al-Jabri, “Arab-Islamic Philosophy,” 11.  52  Al-Suri is a borderline case of Salafism. Even though he operated within the Salafi jihadi network,  most notably AQ, he also criticized Salafis within jihadi groups for causing factionalism and counter- productive infighting. Cf. Lia, “Destructive Doctrinarians,” 287.  53  Wiktorowicz has already pointed out that all Salafis reject violence against civilians, but that some  in the movement would consider Western construction workers in a pre-dominantly Muslim country  (for example) to be agents of an aggressive, imperialist attack and thus de facto legitimate targets. Cf.  Wiktorowicz, “Anatomy,” 216.  54  Of those groups not included, the most noteworthy, high-profile recruiting spots for militant Salafis  are the “Islamic Cultural Center” and the “Family- and Culture-Club” in Bremen, the Frankfurt milieu  and the Salafi dominated mosques in Bonn. Cf. Horst, “Salafi Jihadism”.  55  The following paragraphs are a revised version of the introduction to the German Muslim  community in: Horst, “Salafi Jihadism”.  174    </page> <page sequence="177">    56  Only 20% of Germany’s Muslims belong to a religious association or are officially registered in  their community. In fact, less than 25% of all Muslims feel represented by any of the large Muslim  umbrella organizations. Cf. BMI/DIK, “Summary: Muslim Life in Germany,” 9-10.  57  A 2007 study by the Federal Ministry of the Interior shows that the glorification of Islam and the  derogation of Christian and Western society is widespread. Of the survey respondents, 26%   absolutely agreed with the idea that “Only Islam is able to solve the problems of our time” while  another 19% agreed somewhat. In other words, almost half of Germany’s Muslim population is at  least open to the idea that Islam should play a political role in Germany. The topic of sexuality is the  strongest indicator of contempt for Western values. Almost half of the Muslim community absolutely  agrees that “The sexual morals of Western societies are entirely corrupted”. A total of 71% support  this notion at least to some extent. Accordingly, 71.9% of Turkish parents see the German society as a  threat to the religious and cultural development of their children. The findings on attitudes towards  violence were similarly alarming: 17.9% of Muslims absolutely confirmed the statement, “The threat  the West poses to Islam legitimizes Muslim self-defense through violent means.” Another 20.4%  agreed with this statement somewhat. An item measuring whether respondents condoned suicide  bombings found that 8.7% of German Muslims absolutely did not, or somewhat did not, object to  suicide attacks. Cf. BMI, “Muslime in Deutschland – Integration, Integrationsbarrieren,” 120-121,  176-177; Breuer, “Bildungs- und Sozialarbeit,” 28.  58  According to police reports, students in the VIKZ’s Qur’an schools were beaten, and jihad was  glorified. Because several of the organization’s facilities were misused as religious boarding schools,  they were closed by the authorities. Cf. Brandt, “Verfassungsschützer sollen VIKZ beobachten,”  Spiegel Online, April 16, 2008.  59  In his unpublished study from 2009, Hummel not only provides an excellent overview of the early  development of Salafi activities in Germany (cf. Hummel, “Salafismus,” 8-9), but also describes many  of the international ties of the various currents of Salafism in Germany.  60  Cf. The case of MKH and IIZ has been previously discussed in: Horst, “Salafi Jihadism”. If no other  citation is given, the information provided refers to this report.  175    </page> <page sequence="178">    61  Specifically, writings of Dr. Abdul Rahman Al-Sheha like “Misconceptions of Human Rights in  Islam”; “Muhammed, the Messenger of Allah”; “The Bulwark of the Believer”; and “The Standing of  Women in Islam”.  62  Dr. Ayman Al-Zawahiri was the second and last leader of the Egyptian Islamic Jihad. Since Osama  bin Ladin’s demise, he has headed AQ.  63  The owner of the company is Abdul Matin Tatari, who is a longtime backer of Syria’s ruling family  and whose oldest son was close a friend of Mohammed Atta, the leader of the 9/11 Hamburg cell. A  second shareholder in the company was Mohamad Majed Said, head of Syrian intelligence between  1987-1994 and a member of the Syrian National Security Council in 2001. Cf. Joscelyn, "The Wanted:  Mamoun Darkazanli," The Weekly Standard, 27 July 2009.  64  The East Africa embassy bombings were a string of attacks perpetrated on August 7, 1998:  Hundreds of people were killed when explosives-laden trucks were driven into the US embassies in  Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, and Nairobi, Kenya. The bombings were planned and orchestrated by AQ.  65  The Madrid train bombings of March 11, 2004 were a coordinated attack against four commuter  trains in which 191 people were killed and about 1,800 were wounded. An AQ-inspired Islamist  terrorist cell was responsible for the attack.  66  Another important Salafi preacher in Hamburg was Mohammed Al-Fazazi, who was the imam of  the Al-Quds Mosque in 1999-2000. During that time, he called on Muslims “to remove the infidels  from power, kill their children, capture their women and destroy their houses.” He was sentenced to 30  years in prison for his involvement in the Casablanca attacks in 2003. In July 2009, Fazazi wrote a  letter from prison addressed to German Muslims, which stated that “Germany is not a battle zone.”  German authorities believe Fazazi’s change of mind is sincere, and have hailed his letter for sparking  intense discussion at radical mosques in Germany. Cf. “Radical Cleric Calls on Muslims in Germany  to Reject Violence,” Spiegel Online, 26 October 2009.  67  The Arabic term dawa literally translates into call or invitation. Salafis use the term for all activities  that promote the Islamic message and Islamic values.  68  Vogel has publicly confirmed that he met the leader of the Sauerland Cell, Fritz Gelowicz, during a  pilgrimage to Mecca, and allegedly asked him to pray that no attack would take place in Germany, as  176    </page> <page sequence="179">    the Germans would hold it against the whole Muslim community. The statement by Vogel was aired  during a roundtable discussion in September 2010 on the German national television station, ARD.  See “Di, 21.09.10 Menschen bei Maischberger Pierre Vogel,” online clip, uploaded by user DMK2oo6  on 21 September 2010, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EVK0wnV10Ko.   69  One could argue that the concept of al-wala wa-l-bara should figure more prominently in a study of  Salafism, or even that it is a major element of Salafi ideology. This is a reasonable objection, since the  concept recurs, especially among those Salafi groups that care less about their reputation among non- Muslims. DWR is such a group. In a number of online clips, DWR preacher Abu Dujana explains the  meaning of the concept as a commandment to love fellow Muslims while hating and keeping separate  from the infidels: “Abu Dujana –al-wala wal bara 1 von 7 (Seminar Moers).avi,” online clip, uploaded  by user SchahadaFisebililah on 20 June 2010, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jZr8Tqa1tr4.  However, those Salafi groups that do seek contact with mainstream society refer to the concept less.  Similarly, eminent Salafi scholars like Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Baz offer ambiguous advice on  relations with non-Muslims. On one hand, Bin Baz advises Muslims that “They should [...] be  merciful and compassionate to the poor and destitute even if they are disbelievers” and that “Allah has  forbidden argumentation with the People of the Book, and they are the Jews and the Christians, except  in the best possible way.” (Cf. Bin Baz, Uthaymeen, “Muslim Minorities,” 16f), On the other hand,  Bin Baz urges Muslims “to be distant from their enemies and not mix with them nor listen to their  sermons because they call to the fire.” (Ibid, p. 28). Thus, the study of the concept of al-wala wa-l- bara can give important insight into the ideology and concomitant behavior of a Salafi group or  scholar at a given time in a give situation. However, the idea of hatred of disbelievers seems too  situational and bound to circumstance to be a constant feature of Salafi ideology. Using the MSR  approach, one would conceive of the use of al-wala wa-l-bara as part of a Medinan mode of behavior.  For a thorough discussion of the concept see: Wagemakers, “The Transformation,” 81-106.  70  The German cell responsible for the Europe Plot was apparently led by the Algerian-French suspect  Naamen Meziche. Meziche recruited Sidiqi and the others at Hamburg’s Taibe Mosque. The group left  for the FATA area of Pakistan in late 2008 via different routes. Eight of them, including two women,  were said to have joined the IMU. Another Salafi from Hamburg, Asadullah M., was said to have  177    </page> <page sequence="180">    arranged the travel logistics. More light is shed on relations among the IJU, IMU, AQ and the Taliban  by the fact that Meziche’s Hamburg group was associated with the group German Taliban  Mujahideen. Rami Makanesi, a German national of Syrian descent and a resident of Hamburg, was  arrested in June 2010 and extradited to Germany, where in May 2011 he was sentenced to four years  and nine months in jail. One of the jihadis allegedly tasked to be on the team of attackers was Shahab  Dashti, who also attended the Al-Taibe Mosque. Dashti was already known from an IMU video dating  to late 2009, in which he called German Muslims to join jihad. Dashti was killed in October 2010 in a  US drone strike in Waziristan. He appears to also have been active in the association that runs the Al- Taibe Mosque. His name appears on two lists of the mosque association’s plenary assemblies in 2007  and 2008. Cf. Robertson and Cruickshank, “Hamburg cell at heart of terrorist plot against Europe,”  CNN, October 4, 2010; “Detained German says Dozens Europeans fighting in Afghanistan,” Earth  Times, 23 June 2010; Robertson and Cruickshank, “Sources: Senior AQ leader directed Europe plot,”  CNN, 6 October 2010; Cruickshank, "Jihadi website: One of Hamburg terror group killed in drone  strike," CNN, 7 October 2010; Official file of "Arabisch-Deutscher Kulturverein Masjid Al-Taiba,"  registry court: Hamburg, registry number: VR13763, March 2011.  71  The Web Information company “Alexa” ranks websites according to their average number of daily  visitors and pageviews. In May 2011, EZP ranked around 8,000 on the German list, DWR ranked  around 17,000, and Vogel ranked around 26,000. Vogel’s reunion with DWR and the receding  influence of EZP is reflected in the online ranking. In September 2011, DWR was ranked at about  13,000, whereas EZP’s new website, muslimtube.de, only scored 19,000, and pierrevogel.de decreased  in popularity to a rank of some 32,000. Cf. Alexa Traffic Rank at Alexa.com.  72  In May 2011 the Islamic Hacker Union had a German traffic rank of around 187,000, while and  Islambruederschaft had a rank of 311,000.  73  See for example the following clip from an Islamic seminar in Elsdorf by Cologne, held in October  2009. It shows Benhsain on the podium with Muhamad Ciftci of the EZP. Dr. Hassan Dabbagh is seen  converting a native German to Islam: “Konvertierung im Deutschsprachigen Islam Seminar Herbst  2009 Elsdorf,” online video clip, November 15, 2009,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0pvayWgWPbo.  178    </page> <page sequence="181">    74  On weekends, Dabbagh runs what he calls a “Mobile Islamic Academy” at mosques throughout  Germany. He continues to organize, with Mohamed Benhsain, “Islamic education meet-ups in  German”. These events are advertised on a mailing list of the Quran-Sunna.de Forum:  http://www.quran-sunna.de.  75  Heider had serious problems at school and, as a teenager, was sent by his parents to Egypt, where he  attended a high school affiliated with Al-Azhar University for six years. He learned Arabic and  became more religious. Once he was back in Germany, he took a distance-learning course with the  "Institut Européen des Sciences Humaines" (IESH) in France, which was founded by a Muslim  Brotherhood front organization, and whose spiritual leader is the Egyptian cleric Dr. Yusuf Al- Qaradawi. Cf.

It is headed by  the preacher Abdel Latif, who was charged in February 2011 with recruiting for Al-Qaida affiliates in  Central Asia. Abdel Latif regularly preaches at at least three mosques in Frankfurt: the “Masjid Al- Falah,” the “Bilal-Moschee,” and the “Zakarija-Moschee”. Another senior activist of the group is the  former German police officer Roman Reinders, aka Abu Bilal, from Bad Homburg. The group had ties  to the jihadi internet label “Islambruederschaft.com” of Afghan Omid H., who was arrested on 20 July  2011 for distributing AQ propaganda via the internet. Cf. Website “Dawa FFM,” www.dawaffm.de;  "Nach Razzia: Islamisten rufen im Internet zur Einheit auf," Frankfurter Neue Presse, 23 February  2011; "Festnahme wegen Internet-Werbung für Al-Qaida in Nordhessen," Open Report, 21 July 2011;  "Bad Homburger Gesetzeshüter predigte im Internet den Islam," May 2010, Frankfurter Neue Presse,  published on: Website "Deutschsprachiger Muslimkreis Karlsruhe e.V.” http://www.dmk- karlsruhe.de/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=1848; "Gruppe:  www.youtube.com/DAWAFFM," website wer-kennt-wen.de, http://www.wer-kennt- wen.de/gruppen/frankfurt-am-main/www-youtube-com-dawaffm-s8sbvum0/; "Interview mit Bruder  Sayfudin (Dawa FFM)," Blog "Islambruederschaft",  https://www.islambruederschaft.com/blog/?p=3004.  179    </page> <page sequence="182">    77  As deputy chief of IR in Germany, Misirlioglu is also linked to the organization’s head, Hani Al- Banna, who is a listed trustee of “Muslim Aid,” a British charity linked to AQ. Cf. "Feierliche  Eröffnung des Islamic Relief Büros in Essen," Website Islamic Relief Germany, 19 August 2009,  http://www.islamicrelief.de/meldungen/feierliche-eroeffnung-des-islamic-relief-bueros-in-essen/ and  Gunaratna, “Spain: An AQ Hub?”.  78  Even so, Troppenz alleges that the IBS’ membership has grown to around 100 individuals. See:  “Angst vor dem Islam in Deutschland ... Ein deutscher Muslim aus Schwerin,” online clip, n.d.,  http://video.google.de/videoplay?docid=-1015103832868300590.  79  By “actors of global jihad” we refer to AQ and AQ-like organizations, i.e. Sunni militants with a  local or trans-national agenda, excluding Palestinian terrorist groups like HAMAS and PIJ, since the  latter organizations receive much more support from Islamists in Germany and worldwide.than do  similar groups elsewhere.   80  This neglects the otherwise relevant distinction between terrorism and guerilla warfare made by  Prof. Boaz Ganor, based on the target of the attack: While the guerilla fighter aims at military  infrastructure and personnel, the terrorist deliberately targets civilians. Cf. Ganor,”Defining  Terrorism,” 287.   81  As already noted, none of the prominent preachers in Germany publicly call for terrorist attacks in  Germany (that is, for deliberate violence against civilians) – even though a number of them either  applauded or downplayed the magnitude of the shootings at Frankfurt Airport in March 2011. An in- depth examination would also have to consider differences in the perceptions of jihadi actors such as  HAMAS and Hizbullah, which perpetrate terrorist and guerilla violence against Israel and which are  much more widely accepted among established Islamist organizations in Germany, and of AQ and its  affiliates in Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen.  82  The findings of this analysis, which relies primarily on OSINT, must naturally be considered with  caution.  83  Vogel reflected on this situation during a Friday sermon in Munchengladbach: “One will try to  destroy us. The hostility has been clearly shown. We must not deceive ourselves. [...] Therefore there  are many people in Germany hostile to Islam. [...] We have to be prepared. One has tried to stop the  180    </page> <page sequence="183">    mosques. That means one has succeeded that we hardly appear in mosques anymore. Then one has  succeeded in destroying the halls so that we hardly get a hall anymore. The next step is one will try to  outlaw the association with any speculations. [...] The next step will be to try and pull out the videos  from the internet. But the problem is when thousands of Muslims download those videos and  distribute them. Brothers, we don’t know what will happen tomorrow. We have to be prepared. You  have to meet in your apartments.” "Über die Lage in Mönchengladbach; Entweder wir siegen  oder...wir siegen!," online clip, uploaded by user TheLightOfTheTruth on 9 April 2011,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXxRf7leE4.  84  One such preacher is Egyptian Sheikh Abu Ishaq Al-Heweny. In 2010, he toured Germany and  appeared on numerous occasions with EZP preachers. In one speech, titled “The Threat of the Jews”  (available on his website), he calls the Jews a wicked people with whom peace can never be achieved.  Hinting at atrocities allegedly perpetrated by Israel, he asks that terrorism be responded to with  terrorism. Cf. http://www.alheweny.org/aws/play.php?catsmktba=736.  Another German Salafi preacher criticized cooperation with Al-Heweny, claiming that many of his  fatwas about what makes a Muslim a kafir are incorrect, and adding that some authentic scholars even  consider him a mubtadi’ (innovator), takfiri and khariji. See: “Die Gelehrten über Ishaq Al-Heweny,”  video clip on Wegdersalaf.de,  http://www.wegdersalaf.de/videos?task=viewvideo&amp;video_id=45.  85  Abou Nagie, in particular, is active in Islamic education for children. Many of his lectures are  available online. See e.g. “Das Verbot für Nicht-Muslime Mekka zu betreten – Ibrahim Abou-Nagie,”  online clip, uploaded by user 00AllahuAkbar00 on 1 March 2011,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=OM7zmTRzLrY; and “Abu Nagie – Kinder unterricht 10  Lernstunde,” online clip, uploaded by user IslamErobertEuropa, 3 July 2011,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H0CvPfYz_bk.  86  The RMB explicitly lists “DITIB – Türkisch Islamische Gemeinde zu Bonn” as non-member in the  council. See: “Nicht-Mitglieder des Rats der Muslime Bonn,” Website Rat der Muslime in Bonn,  http://muslimrat-bonn.de/index.php?id=63.  87  Abou Nagie once considered Arab dictators to be infidels, but later retracted his statement. See:  "Klarstellung von Ibrahim Abu Nagie NEU zu (warum Pierre Vogel gegen Ibrahim Abu Nagie  181    </page> <page sequence="184">    arbeitet)," online clip, 8 January 2010,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6dyCe6XggbM&amp;feature=related. On a seminar Abu Dujana even  explicitly criticized a Salafi group from Bremen as takfiri, and explained the “correct understanding”  of when someone becomes a kafir. See: "Abu Dujana - Regeln desTakfir", online clip, uploaded by  DAWAFFM, January 4, 2011, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE_NGcueYMM&amp;feature=related.  88  This can be studied among militant Salafis, who often claim that the result of their fight in this  world is unimportant, as they will either achieve victory for Allah or die as martyrs and become  revered heroes in the next world. This idea also appears among Salafi preachers who have no  imminent jihadist ambitions, but who face severe hardships, such as Pierre Vogel in  Munchengladbach: “But in the end we will always win. [...] Either the victory will be that people  adopt Islam or the victory will be that one will be expelled and that through this striving Allah elevates  one in level [of paradise] or that one is killed and even becomes a shaheed. But victory is with the  believers.” 182    </page> <page sequence="185">    List of Acronyms  Abbreviation –   Title –  Title in English AABF – Protection of the Bundesnachrichtendienst  Almanya Alevi Birlikleri Constitution –  Federasyonu –  German Federal  Federation of Alevi BGH – Intelligence Service  Communities in Germany Bundesgerichtshof –    German Federal Supreme   AQ – Court CDU –  Al Qaida  Christlich-Demokratische   BIG – Union –  BAMF – Bündnis Innovation und Christian Democratic  Bundesamt für Migration Gerechtigkeit – Party  und Flüchtlinge – Union for Innovation and   Federal Office for Justice DIK –  Migration and Refugees  Deutsche Islam   BKA – Konferenz –  BfV –  Bundeskriminalamt – German Islam Conference  Bundesamt für Federal Criminal Police   Verfassungsschutz – of Germany DITIB –  Federal Office for the  Diyanet Işleri Türk-Islam  BND – Birliği –  183    </page> <page sequence="186">    Turkish-Islamic Union for Bundesrepublik   Religious Affairs Deutschland – HAMAS –   Federal Republic of Harakat al-muqawama  DWR – Germany al-islamiyya –  Die Wahre Religion –  Movement of the Islamic  The True Religion  resistance   GDR –   EIJ – Deutsche Demokratische IBR –  Egyptian Islamic Jihad Repubik – Islamischer Bund Rostock   German Democratic –  e.V. – Republic Islamic Union Rostock  eingetragener Verein –    Registered association in GIMF – IBS –  Germany Global Islamic Media Islamisches Bündnis   Front – Schwerin –  EZP –  Islamic Union Schwerin  Einladung zum Paradies GSG 9 –   – Grenzschutzgruppe 9 – IGB –  Invitation to Paradise Border Protection Group Islamische Gemeinschaft   9, German Counter Terror Berlin –  FATA – Unit under the authority Islamic Community  Federally Administered of the Federal Police Berlin  Tribal Areas in Pakistan     GTM –   FRG – German Taliban   Mujahideen IGD –    </page> <page sequence="187">    Islamische Gemeinschaft Islamische Dschihad Islamische Bewegung  Deutschland – Union – Usbekistan –  Islamic Society Germany Islamic Jihad Union Islamic Movement    Uzbekistan  IGMG – IKEZ –   Islamische Gemeinschaft Islamisches Kultur- und IR –  Millî Görüş – Erziehungszentrum – Islamic Relief Worldwide  Islamic Community Millî Islamic Cultural and   Görüş (lit. “National Education Center IRD –  view”)  Islamrat für die   IBMUS – Bundesrepublik  IHH – Initiative Berliner Deutschland –  İnsani Yardım Vakfı – Muslime – Islamic Council for the  The Foundation for Initiative of Muslims in Federal Republic of  Human Rights and Berlin Germany  Freedom and    Humanitarian Relief IMSU – IZA –   Internationale Islamisches Zentrum  IIZ – Muslimische Studenten Aachen –  Islamisches Union – Islamic Center Aachen  Informationszentrum – International Muslim   Islamic Information Student Union IZH –  Center  Islamisches Zentrum    Hamburg –  IJU –  Islamic Center Hamburg  IMU –     </page> <page sequence="188">    KRM – Landesamt für NPD –  Koordinationsrat der Verfassungsschutz – Nationaldemokratische  Muslime in Deutschland – State Office for the Partei Deutschland –  Coordination Council of Protection of the National Democratic  Muslims in Germany Constitution Party Germany      KRMV – MB – RMT –  Koordinierungsrat der Muslim Brotherhood Resource Mobilization  Muslime in Mecklenburg-  Theory  Vorpommern – MKH –   Coordination Council of Multikulturhaus – SMT –  Muslims in Mecklenburg- Multi Cultural House Social Movement Theory  Hither Pomerania     MLD – SMO –  KSK – Studie “Muslimisches Social Movement  Kommando Spezialkräfte Leben in Deutschland” – Organization  – Study “Muslim Life in   German Special Forces Germany” StGB –  Command  Strafgesetzbuch –   MSR – German Criminal Code  LeT – Matrix of Salafi   Lashkar-e-Taiba – Reasoning VIKZ –  Army of the Good  Verband der islamischen   MWL – Kulturzentren –  LfV – Muslim World League Association of the Islamic   Cultural Centers    </page> <page sequence="189">     ZMD –   WAMY – Zentralrat der Muslime in   World Assembly of Deutschland –   Muslim Youth Central Council for    Muslims in Germany       </page> <page sequence="190">      </page> <page sequence="191">    List of Islamic Terms    al-irada al-kawniyyah –  Allah’s universal will. It is pertinent to his creation and  includes everything regardless of it being good or bad.    al-irada ash-shariyyah –  Allah’s legislative will. It includes what is not only willed  by Allah to exist but also sanctified as good and worthy.  Other common terms for this are al-irada ad-deeniyya  (religious will) and mashi’a (will).    al-irada ad-deeniyya –  see: al-irada ash-shariyyah    al-jihad al-akbar –    see: jihad    al-jihad al-asghar –   see: jihad    al-lauh al-mahfooz – the preserved tablet. Salafis believe that every thing and  incident that exists was written down on this tablet 50,000  years before the creation.    aqida –    belief or religious doctrine.      </page> <page sequence="192">    ash-shirk al-asghar –   See: shirk.    ash-shirk al-akbar – See: shirk.    as-salaf as-salih – the pious forefathers. The term usually refers to the first  three generations of Muslims.    ahl-al-kitab the people of the book. A more benevolent term for the  followers of the non-Islamic monotheist religions.    ahl-e-hadith – people of the narrations of the prophet. It denotes a religious  group that developed in the 1860’s and 70’s on the Indian  sub-continent.     athar –    narration.      aya / ayat –    verse in the Qur’an.    bid’a –     innovation in religious matters.    bi-la kayfa – lit. without how. It is an Islamic concept for a taboo against  the inquiry into the modality of Allah’s names and attributes    </page> <page sequence="193">    so as not to liken God to men, while accepting  anthropomorphic descriptions in Qur’an and Sunna.     dawa – call or invitation. Salafis typically describe their propaganda  as dawa, i.e. a call or invitation to Islam.    fard ayn – individual duty. In Salafi discourse it typically means the  duty of every Muslim to use force in order to “defend” the  Muslim umma. Conversely, fard kifaya means collective  duty and exempts the individual believer from participating  in hostilities himself.    fatwa / fatawa –   Islamic ruling.    fiqh –     jurisprudence.    firqa najiyya – the saved sect. Salafis believe to be the only Islamic group  that will be safe from hell fire on the Day of Judgment.    fisq –     sin.     fitna / fitan  –    strife, civil war or dissension within the umma.      </page> <page sequence="194">    hadith / ahadith – a tradition or narration of the prophet Muhammad. The  body of authentic ahadith composes the Sunna.    hakimiyya – sovereignty of God as opposed to the sovereignty of people.  The term was coined by Said Qutb.    haqq –     truth.       hijab – headscarf.    hijra – the emigration of Muhammad and his following from  Mecca to Medina.    hizbiyya – party politics. Salafis use the term to denigrate Islamic  groups trying to use a party system to further their goals and  thereby, allegedly, serving party interests rather than God.    ijtihad – individual interpretation of the Qur’an and the Sunna. It is  opposed to taqlid, i.e. the following of the schools of  Islamic jurisprudence.    ’ilm ar-rijal – science of men. Al-Albani coined the term for the endeavor  to trace the sanad (chain of transmission) of ahadith in    </page> <page sequence="195">    order to verify the reliability and moral integrity of the  human narrators.    yawm ad-din –  Day of Judgment.    istihlal – making something permissible. Meant is something that was  forbidden by God. This act is tantamount to apostasy.    i’tiqad – conviction. In Salafi debate it often refers to committing a  sin with a conviction of the rightfulness of the act of  sinning. As such it is one of three possible prerequisites for  a form of great disbelief that is tantamount to apostasy. The  other two are istihlal and jahd.    ittifaaq –    unanimous agreement.    jahd – denial. In Salafi debate it is often meant the denial of the  truth of Islam and in this sense it counts as one of three  possible prerequisites for a sin to become a form of great  disbelief that is tantamount to apostasy. The other two are  istihlal and i’tiqad.      </page> <page sequence="196">    jahiliyya – the age of ignorance. The times preceding Islam are referred  to this way. In contemporary usage Salafis often claim that  modern and especially Western societies are in a state of  jahiliyya as well. Sayyid Qutb was the first to accuse  Muslim countries to live in jahiliyya as well, an idea that  usually rejected by Salafis.    jihad – lit. striving or effort. The term usually denotes the holy war  of Islam and was used in this sense in most of the Sunna.  However, later Muslim scholars differentiated between  violent and non-violent forms of jihad. al-jihad al-akbar  (greater jihad) is also known as jihad of the heart and  denotes a struggle against the sinful self of the believer. al- jihad al-asghar (lesser jihad) refers to the actual fighting in  the name of Allah. Later Muslim scholars added other, non- violent forms of jihad that refer to activities for the  betterment of the Muslim umma like jihad of the tongue and  jihad of the money. Both are also forms of dawa.    kafir / kuffar – an unbeliever. It is the general term for all non-Muslims  even though the followers of other monotheist religions are  sometimes referred to less derogatorily as ahl al-kitab.      </page> <page sequence="197">    kamal ad-din – completeness of faith. The third of three levels of faith. It  includes only commendable acts. The other two levels are  sihhat ad-din and wajib ad-din.      khariji / khawarij – lit. the leaving one. The term refers to an incident in early  Islamic history, where a group of fighters left Caliph Ali  and accused him of heresy for agreeing to arbitration after  an inconclusive battle with a Muslim rival. They argued  Allah is the only legitimate arbitrator. Today the term is  used derogatorily against Muslim radicals, whose behavior  might cause fitna.    kufr –  disbelief. There is kufr akbar (major disbelief) that makes  someone an apostate and there is kufr asghar (minor  disbelief) that is manifest in sinful behavior.    kufr akbar –    see: kufr    kufr asghar –    see: kufr      </page> <page sequence="198">    madhab / madhahib – school of jurisprudence. Salafis generally reject the blind  following of the four schools of jurisprudence and call for a  new interpretation of the religious sources (ijtihad).    manhaj – method, praxis, code of conduct. The major point of  disagreement between Salafis is the application of their  aqida in today’s world, i.e. the correct praxis of Islam.    mashi’a –     see: al-irada ash-shariyyah    mihna – religious purge in early Islam in which the state-sanctioned,  rationalist school of Mu’tazilah disputed the doctrine of the  traditionalists.    millat Ibrahim – creed of Abraham. In Medina Muhammad tried to set  himself apart from the Jewish tribes stressing Islam’s origin  in Abrahamic religion from which Jews and Christians had  deviated. The concept was used by Juhayman Al-‘Utaybi in  his struggle against the Saudi monarchy and famously  revived by Jihadi scholar Abu Muhammad Al-Maqdisi to  justify hatred against non-Muslims.      </page> <page sequence="199">    murji’a – The ones who defer judgment. In Salafi debate the term is  usually meant derogatorily against Muslim competitors  whose criticism of sinful practice or disbelief is not harsh  enough.    mushrik / mushrikun – polytheist, person committing shirk.    murtad  –    apostate.    nasheed / anasheed –   a traditional-style Islamic song without instruments.    niqab – veil for women that covers the face. It is worn in addition to  the hijab.    qiyas –     analogical reasoning.     riya  – Showing off. It usually means the performance of deeds in  accordance with the sharia in order to appeal to human beings  rather than God.    sahaba –   the companions of the prophet Muhammad.      </page> <page sequence="200">    sahih – true. There are different collections of ahadith that are considered  to be more or less trustworthy according to their chain of  transmitters. The most reliable ahadith bear the attribute sahih.    sanad –   a hadith’s chain of oral transmission. See also: ’ilm ar-rijal    sharia – sources of Islamic jurisprudence as laid out in Qur’an and Sunna.    shirk – association, polytheism. Every association of Allah, his names or  attributes with his creation is considered shirk. It is generally  divided in ash-shirk al-asghar (minor shirk) and ash-shirk al-akbar  (major shirk) that signifies somebody is an apostate.    sihhat ad-din – truth of the faith. The first of three levels of faith. It includes the  basic tenets of Islam. The other two are wajib ad-din and kamal ad- din.    sunna –   traditions and sayings of the prophet Muhammad.    sura / suwar –   chapter in the Qur’an.    taghut –   idolatry.      </page> <page sequence="201">    takfir – the act of declaring somebody an infidel. The term has a derogatory  connotation as such declarations can lead to internal strife. The  invective for a Muslim who regularly declares other Muslims to be  apostates is takfiri.    takfiri –   see: takfir.    taifa mansura – the victorious group. It is another self-appellation of the Salafi  community. See also: firqa najiyya.    tareeqah –   way, traditions.    taqlid – imitation or blind following of the traditional schools of Islamic  jurisprudence. Its opposite is ijtihad.    taqwa –  piety, wariness. The term covers all attempts to remain wary of  sinful behavior.    tawba – repentance. It means a return to the way of Allah after every  deviation.    tawhid – unicity of God. In Salafi doctrine tawhid is interpreted as a strict  monotheism that is divided in three aspects: tawhid ar-rububiyya    </page> <page sequence="202">    (unicity of God’s Lordship), tawhid al-asma wa as-sifat (unicity of  God’s names and attributes) and tawhid al-'ibada (unicity of  worship).    tawhid al-asma wa as-sifat – See: tawhid.    tawhid al-'ibada –   See: tawhid.    tawhid ar-rububiyya –  See: tawhid.    ulama –   the class of Islamic scholars.    umma – the community of the faithful, all Muslims thought as one  community.    wajib ad-din – duties of the faith. The second of three levels of faith. It includes all  in Islam obligatory acts and prohibitions. The other two levels are  sihhat ad-din and kamal ad-din.    </page> <page sequence="203">    Bibliography  Media publications  "‘Al-Qaeda man’ wins German appeal," BBC News, 18 July 2005,  http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4692375.stm    "Bad Homburger Gesetzeshüter predigte im Internet den Islam," May 2010, Frankfurter Neue  Presse, published on: Website "Deutschsprachiger Muslimkreis Karlsruhe e.V.”  http://www.dmk-karlsruhe.de/index2.php?option=com_content&amp;do_pdf=1&amp;id=1848    “Bin Laden Said to Have Financed European Terror Plot,” Spiegel Online, October 2, 2010    "Bonner Muslime schließen sich zusammen," General-Anzeiger, 21 September 2006,  http://www.general-anzeiger-bonn.de/lokales/bonn/Bonner-Muslime-schliessen-sich-zusammen- article109736.html     “CIA Part of Investigation of ’Düsseldorf Cell’,” Spiegel Online, 29 April  2011.http://www.spiegel.de/international/germany/0,1518,759852,00.html    “Detained German says Dozens Europeans fighting in Afghanistan,” Earth Times, 23 June 2010,  http://www.earthtimes.org/articles/news/330932,dozens-europeans-fighting-afghanistan.html    "Drei Jahre Haft für Terrorverdächtigen," Sueddeutsche Zeitung, 6 April 2005.     “English Translation of Ayman Al-Zawahiri’s letter to Abu Musab Al-Zarqawi,” The weekly  Standard, 12 October 2005,  http://www.weeklystandard.com/Content/Public/Articles/000/000/006/203gpuul.asp?page=3    "FEATURE - In free Egypt, Salafists speak out," AlertNet, 21 February 2011,  http://www.trust.org/alertnet/news/feature-in-free-egypt-salafists-regroup-speak-out/    "Festnahme wegen Internet-Werbung für Al-Qaida in Nordhessen," Open Report, 21 July 2011.

They describe the trustworthiness of one particular  Hadith depending on the chain of human narrators that transmitted it until it was written down. There are  three categories into which the whole body of Hadith is divided: sahih (sound), hasan (fair), da’if (weak).  Cf. Guillaume, “Traditions of Islam,” 83-88.   xxxv Al-Tirmidhi, “Al-Jami’ Al-Sahih,” Book 43, Ch.18:2650.  xxxvi  Lacroix, “Between Revolution,” 59-62.  xxxvii  There were, however, a few interruptions of Saudi rule. The First Saudi State lasted until an  Ottoman-Egyptian invasion toppled the king in 1818. 1824 the house of Saud returned to power. The  Second Saudi State lasted until 1891. After a string of Saudi conquests starting in 1902 the Third Saudi  State was established in 1932 as Kingdom of Saudi Arabia.  xxxviii  Zuhur, “Saudi Arabia,” 16-17.  xxxix  For a short summary on Wahhabi ideology cf. Blanchard, “Wahhabism and Salafiyya,” 2. A more  detailed analysis provides: Voll, “Al-Sindi and Abd Al-Wahhab”.  xl  Lacroix, “Between Revolution,” 59-60.  xli  This was later pointed out by Sheikh Al-Albani, a revered authority for many Salafis today,  who called Abd Al-Wahhab a Salafi in aqida but not in fiqh. Cf. Lacroix, “Between Revolution,”  68.  xlii  Abou Zahab, “Salafism in Pakistan,” 127; Lacroix, “Between Revolution,” 61.  xliii  It has already been noted that Wahhabism, despite its vocal rejection of taqlid, did rely on the Hanbali  school for legal rulings. Until today Saudi judges overwhelmingly follow Hanbali’s views in their  judgements even though they are given the discretion to perform ijtihad. cf. Vogel “Islamic law,” 125- 126.  xliv  Haykel, “On the nature,” 45; Wiktorowicz “Anatomy,” 212.  xlv  Ryad, “Islamic Reformism and Great Britain,” 263.  xlvi  Ibid. 263-264.  xlvii  Sivan, “The Clash Within Islam,” 35.  xlviii  Sirriyeh, “Rashid Rida’s autobiography,”187.  xlix  Lacroix, “Between Revolution,” 63-65.  l  Ibid. 67  li  During her guest-lecture at the Interdisciplinary Center Herzliya (IDC) 10 Jan 2010, Prof. Ofira Seliktar  made a case in point when she described the problem of  “deception by default” which hampers U.S.  intelligence services to accurately assess Islamist actors. According to her, the CIA’s paradigm that Sunni  and Shia Muslims do not collaborate prevented the service from understanding Iran’s influence in Sudan  and Iran’s relationship to Osama Bin Ladin while he resided in Sudan. Seliktar pointed at the problem of  construing the unit of analysis as a unitary actor as a major source of self-deception.  lii  Adorno described the problem as follows: “The concept’s immanent claim is its order-creating  invariance against the change in what it covers. The form of the concept – ’false’ in this respect also –  would deny that change. [...] The concept in itself, previous to any content, hypostatizes its own form  against the content. With that, however, it is already hypostatizing the identity principle: that what our  thinking practice merely postulates is a fact in itself, solid and enduring.” Adorno, “Negative Dialectics,”  153-154.  liii  Wiktorowicz, “Anatomy,” 209.    </page> <page sequence="228">                                                                                                                                                                                                liv  cf. Haykel, “On the nature,” 51.  lv  See e.g. the statement of the German Salafi preacher Ibrahim Abou Nagie: "Ein Muslim der  das Grundgesetz akzeptiert ist ein Ungläubiger" online clip, June 09, 2009,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HOWPGyWbvSY&amp;feature=related; regarding the perception  of financial affluence as sign of Allah’s benevolence see: Adraoui, “Salafism in France,” 377.  lvi  In Germany some Salafi dominated mosques showcase Saudi posters distributed through the German  Salafi preacher Muhamad Ciftci that call on men to only wear trousers that don’t reach above the ankle.  They read: “Everything below the ankle is in hell fire.” This practice is known from the “neo-Ahl Al- Hadith”, an Al-Albani inspired Salafi current in Saudi Arabia, which highlights its influence on the  German scene. The neo-Ahl Al-Hadith became dominant in Medina University in the early 1990’s. Many  foreign students, including important German Salafi preachers have studied at this institution. – cf.  Lacroix, “Between Revolution,” 72,77.  lvii  cf. Vogel “Islamic law,” 4-5.  lviii  Wiktorowicz, “Anatomy,” 210.  lix  Ibid. 211-212.  lx  Haykel, “On the nature,” 34.  lxi  cf.

The Sahwa or ”Awakening” movement is a term for a number of  Saudi Arabia’s non-establishment scholars, who protested the Saudi king’s decision in the early 90’s to  allow U.S. troops on Saudi soil after Saddam Hussein had invaded Kuwait and threatened the Saudi  kingdom. The Sahwa movement has its ideological roots in an amalgam of Saudi Wahhabi ideology and  the ideological heritage of the violent current of Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood, whose preachers had fled  in great numbers to Saudi Arabia after Nasser’s Egypt had started to persecute them. The most prominent  of the Saudi Sahwa Sheikhs are Salman Al-Auda and Safar Al-Hawali. For a detailed discussion of the  Saudi Sahwa movement see: Al-Rasheed, “Contesting the Saudi State”.  lxiv  Salomon, “The Salafi Critique,” 143-168.  lxv  Meijer, “Commanding Right,” 204.  lxvi  Originally active in the Syrian Muslim Brotherhood Al-Sururi came closer to Salafi ideology while  residing in Saudi Arabia and Kuwait. Relying mainly on Ibn Taymiyya and Sayyid Qutb he developed a  distinct ideological practice termed by its adversaries “Sururiyya”. Cf. Lacroix, “Muhammad Surur,” 435- 436; Keppel, “The war for Muslim minds,” 174-177; Al-Dhaydi, “What is the story”.  lxvii  Salomon, “The Salafi Critique,” 151.  lxviii  Roy, ”Globalized Islam,” 270.  lxix  Ibid. 104.  lxx  Ibid. 122.  lxxi  Salafis who want to justify their acquiescence with un-Islamic rule in the West typically argue that the  Muslim community has made a peace agreement with the majority which it has to uphold. Often they  invoke the Peace of Hudaybiyah between the prophet Muhammad and the polytheist tribe of Quraish  from Mecca as a historical precedent. One article explains Allah’s command regarding behavior towards  non-Muslims: “To make peace with them if the Muslims are in need of making peace and when there is  an overriding benefit for the Muslims in making peace; just as the Prophet (sallAl-laahu-alayhi-wasallam)  made peace with the kuffaar at Hudaibiyyah.”, see “Love and Hate for the Sake of Allaah,” Website of  The Salafi Center of Manchester, http://www.salaficentre.co.uk/articles/minhaj/correct-wala-bara-kuffar- Sheikh-fawzaan.pdf  lxxii  Della Porta, Diani, “Social Movements,” 14-15.    </page> <page sequence="229">                                                                                                                                                                                                lxxiii  It must be added though that large parts of these movements were oftentimes rooted in counter  cultures with a quasi-religious fervor, meaning that they, too, transcended their immediate political  objective.

Uka was not connected to any terror cell even though he seems to have undergone a self-induced  radicalization process through Salafi and Jihadi online propaganda. The trigger event for his plan to attack  the U.S. army was allegedly an online clip showing U.S. troops storming an Afghan house and raping the  family’s daughter. This might well have been the “moral shock” that initiated the violent action. – see:  Matthias Gebauer, "Spuren des Airport-Killers," Spiegel Online, 4 March 2011.  c  Sageman, “Leaderless Jihad,” 144.  ci  Zald, McCarthy, “Social Movement Industries”.  cii  Della Porta, Diani, “Social Movements,” 125-128.  ciii  Stern conceptualizes this “niche” as “membership profile” or as “characteristics of the organizations'  members” but focuses in her analysis on the social status and the age of registered members.

Cf. ibid. 297- 298.  cxxix  Anfara et al., “Qualitative Analysis on Stage,” 28.   cxxx  Ibid. 33.  cxxxi  It seems important to note that the category of “framing” assumes a unique position within  the set of analytical tools of SMT. Political opportunity structure, resource availability and  mobilizing structures all refer to the material conditions of a social movement, whereas framing  deals with the way these conditions are perceived and articulated by SMOs.   cxxxii  There is a wide consensus amongst scholars about the centrality of tawhid in Salafi thinking.

In a Hadith transmitted by Ali he explained to his  companions: ”There is no individual from among you except that indeed his seat in paradise and his seat  in Hell have been written down for him.” The companions responded: “O messenger of Allah, then why  shouldn’t we just trust in what is already written down for us and leave off deeds?” The prophet did not  have a clear answer for them: “Perform deeds for every matter that has been made easy is due to what was  created for him, as for who is from the people of sa’dah (i.e. happiness/paradise), then it will be made  easy for him to do the deeds from the people of sa’dah; and as for who is from the people of shaqawah  (i.e. misery/hellfire), then it will be made easy for him to do the deeds from the people of shaqawah.” (Cf.  Bin Baz, “Al Qadaa’ wAl-Qadar,” 8.) Instead of answering, Muhammad shifts the attention of his  followers simply to another question – how could they determine whether they were destined to go to  heaven or hell?   cxlvi  Cf. Al-Saleh, “The Salaf’s Guide,” 5.  cxlvii  Consequently, instead of applying himself to the contradiction the former Grand Mufti of Saudi  Arabia, Sheikh Abdul-Aziz Bin Baz, just holds out the prospects for blindly accepting what cannot be  thought: “From the things that elevates the status (of the believer) is that believing in the two types of  Allah’s will comes together within the believer. Thus verily, he believed in Allah’s mashi’ah (i.e.  legislative will) as well as Allah’s universal will at the same time.” Bin Baz solution to the contradiction  is to praise the negation there was any. The Salafi answer to Kant’s motto of enlightenment: “Noli sapere  aude! Forfeit the courage to use your own intelligence!” (Cf. Bin Baz, “Al Qadaa’ wAl-Qadar,” 14) The  German Salafi preacher Pierre Vogel talks about the same problem in simple metaphors that bridge the  gap between scholarly Islamic debate and the experience realm of his following. He likens men to factory  workers. Life, Vogel explains, is a test, whose outcome was already written down fifty thousand years  before the creation. But, Vogel goes on, only unbelievers would ask: Why then does Allah test me at all?  Like a worker in a factory does not know why or for whom he produces a certain product, the pious  Muslim does not know why he is put to trial. He lives his life and does what he was told by God just as  the factory worker does what he was told by his boss. All the factory worker needs to know is what  exactly he has to do and that he will earn the reward for his work. So the Muslim only needs to know how  to conform to the sharia. (Cf. "Pierre Vogel - Die Vorherbestimmung (Al-Qadr) im Islam 3/3," online  clip, uploaded 2 March 2011 by user PierreVogelDe, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-TsvGBnlZVA)  Vogel’s metaphor, of course, finds its limit where the laborer can leave his work place, go home and – if  so he pleases – inquire into the conditions, means and ends of his labor. The Salafi vision for humanity on  the other hand hypostatizes the state of man where he is the weakest, pettiest, the most unconscious and  merely a tool of superior forces.  cxlviii  Ibid. 26-27  cxlix  Phillips, “Fundamentals,” 26.  cl  Ibid. 27  cli  Adorno, “Negative Dialectics,” 135.  clii Cf.

Williams concludes: “For Hanbal,  to deny that God truly has a form is kufr.” Williams, ”Aspects of the Creed,” 443.  clx  See e.g. Wiktorowicz, “Anatomy,” 211.  clxi  The doctrine of “bi-la kayfa” goes back to a narration of Malik Ibn Anas (711-795), which according  to Abrahamov might reflect a tradition of the Sahaba (companions of the prophet) or even Muhammad  himself (Abrahamov,  “The Bi-la Kayfa Doctrine,” 366.): "We were with Malik when a man asked him:  ‘O Abu `Abd Allah! "The Merciful is established over the Throne" (20:5): how is His establishment?’  Malik lowered his head and began to sweat profusely. Then he lifted up his head and said: ‘"The Merciful  is established over the Throne" just as He described Himself. One cannot ask "how." "How" does not  apply to Him. And you are an evil man, a man of innovation. Take him out!’ The man was led out."  (Narrated by Ibn Wahb. Cited after: Haddad, Dr. G.F. “Imam Malik,” The As-Sunnah Foundation of  America, http://www.sunnah.org/publication/khulafa_rashideen/malik.htm) There are a number of  versions of this narration all of which agree in the basic argument of Malik that God’s sitting (istiwa’) on  the throne is known while its modality (Al-kayf) is unknown and belief in it is obligatory while inquiring  about it is an innovation (bid’a). (Cf. Shahran, “Divine Transcendence,”4.)  clxii  The concept of bi-la kayfa is also used by German Salafis today. Convert preacher Vogel explained:  “If we say, ’Allah is above the throne’ then we do not imagine anything. Because it is only tashbih  (anthropomorphism) if one associates that with a specific form. [...] We have to believe what Allah says  in the Qur’an in light of ’leysa ka mithli shey,’ nothing is like him.” (“Vortrag Pierre Vogel – Abu Hanifa  sagt – Wer leugnet das Allah über seinem Thron ist, ist ein Kafir,” online clip, uploaded by user  Hacko44English on 20 August 2011, http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EYsi0-XrYUw)   clxiii  Al Jabri notes that the Muslim gnostics were well aware of the superiority “of the reasoning method  that establishes the legitimacy of the knowledge of an in absentia element, the object-to-know, from an  in-praesentia element that can be observed in the world of empirical data.” They consequently “shielded  themselves behind Shi’ism.” Cf.

The quest for purity is also the main cause of internal disputes in Jihadi  groups. Cf. Lia, “Jihadi Strategists,” 101.  clxxxv  The Salafi concepts of tawhid and purity are also most relevant on an individual level. What is called  taqwa and tawba is the attempt to induce a permanent state of alert in the individual believer, who  conceives of his deviant thoughts and desires as satanic temptations thereby externalizing them as an evil  influence from outside.  clxxxvi Kamali, “Civil society and Islam,” 464-465.  clxxxvii  Ibid. 467  clxxxviii  Roy, ”Globalized Islam,” 19.  clxxxix  This “community of the unbelievers” is naturally even more imaginary than the umma itself. There  is a plentitude of different religions, societies and countries but only when considering them under the  viewpoint of being part of the umma or not they become the strict opposite to the community of the  believers: the community of the infidels.  cxc  Even though the umma features prominently in Salafi ideology as victim to infidel attack and  suppression the fundamental fixation on the afterlife does even transform the hypothetical defeat of the  umma into a success because victory is, in any case, with God and the pious will enter paradise regardless  of the success of the umma.  cxci  Nieuwenhuijze, “The Ummah,” 22.  cxcii  Cf.

The members of the group are called Kharijites. Upon the  rd assassination of the 3  Caliph, Uthman bin-Affan, in 656 a power struggle between Muhammad’s cousin  and son-in-law Ali ibn Talib and Mu’awiya bin Abi Sufyan, member of the Meccan Umayyad family,  erupted. Both leaders’ armies engaged 657 in the inconclusive battle of Siffin, after which Ali agreed to  arbitration to settle the dispute. But a group of Ali’s own men seceded from him arguing  “La hukm illa  lillah,” arbitration was only with God, and declared takfir upon Ali. Ali’s force rooted them the same year  at the battle of Nahrawan but in 661 Ali fell victim to a Kharijite assassin himself.  ccxxxvi  Sheikh Salih Ibn Fawzan Al-Fawzan, member of the Permanent Committee for Islamic Research  and Fatawa, Saudi Arabia’s highest religious body e.g. likened the Sahwa-Sheikhs Al-Hawali and Al- Auda, Sayyid and Muhammad Qutb as well as Muhammad Surur to the Khawarij of early Islam.  ccxxxvii  Cf.

This and the following citations of this work  were translated by the author.  cclxi Another eminent Saudi scholar, Sheikh Abdulaziz Bin Baz, warned against fitna in a similar fashion:  “Likewise, the Lord of Might and Majesty warned the nation of Muhammad sallallaahu ‘alayhi wa sallam  against splitting and disunity, since that is one of the greatest causes of failure and of the enemy taking  control. There is no doubt that the multitude of [differing] sects and groups in Islaamic society is, firstly,  something desired by Shaytaan and, secondly something desired by the enemies of Islaam from amongst  mankind. Since agreement and unification of the Muslims and their being aware of the dangers which  threaten them and their beliefs, will make them active in refuting and rebutting it, and acting is a unified  manner for the benefit of the Muslims – thus repelling the danger from their religion, their lands as well  as their brothers. [...] Therefore they [the enemies of Islam from amongst men and jinn] are very eager to  split-up the Muslims, destroy their unity and to sow the seeds of enmity and discord between them.” (Bin  Baz, “The Ideological Attack,” First Interview, First Question.) – The reference to outside forces, hostile  to Islam and the entire umma leads the argumentation to find a way to mitigate the internal frictions of  the movement. The cause of the dissent is not the umma itself but a power from outside that infiltrates    </page> <page sequence="236">                                                                                                                                                                                                an otherwise virtuous society. Lacking a physical force occupying the country, Bin Baz coined the term  “ideological attack” to paint a malicious society of infidels insidiously poisoning the umma: “The term,  ‘the Ideological Attack,’ [Al-ghazwa Al-fikree] is a set of efforts, undertaken by a particular nation, in  order to conquer or influence another nation, such that [the attacked nation] is steered in a particular  course of direction because of it.” This attack is “far more serious than military warfare” because it is  subtle so that the attacked nation does not defend itself and becomes “diseased in its thoughts and  senses,” [...] “It is a chronic disease, which attacks nations, doing away with its characteristics, removing  its foundations and strength. [...] “This war takes place by means of school curriculums, general  education, media, small and large size publications, and other such channels.” (Bin Baz, “The Ideological  Attack,” Second Interview, First Question.) – In another fatwa Bin Baz finally names the forces he sees  behind the “ideological attack”: Modern day Christian crusaders, whose propaganda corrupts Muslim  minds so that they acquiesce to Christian rule, Jews, who “strive their utmost to corrupt beliefs, morals  and manners of Muslims [...] scheme and crave after possessing the Muslim lands, as well as the lands of  others” and finally communists and atheists, notably Russia and China, which “tore the umma apart”  and made its Muslims “troops of Satan,” aided, of course, by Christians and Jews. (Bin Baz, “The  Ideological Attack,” Second Interview, Second Question.)  cclxii  Bid’a as sinful innovation in matters of religion is nothing but a violation of tawhid and could also be  mentioned as a form of kufr, taghut, or shirk – depending on the angle one chooses.  cclxiii  Fawzan, “Al-Muntaqa min fatawa,” No.98.  cclxiv  Ibid.  cclxv  Nieuwenhuijze has pointed at this often-neglected fact, which also sets Islam apart from Christianity  and Judaism: “It should be noted in this connection that the ummah has not been incorporated in the  creed. By pronouncing the shahadah one becomes a member of the ummah; one does not profess one’s  faith in the ummah.” Nieuwenhuijze, “The Ummah,” 18.  cclxvi  In this light, the history of Islam, its expansionism and simultaneous fragmentation of power seems  the practical development of its inherent aporia.  cclxvii   As far as the author is aware no Muslim has ever declared takfir over everybody else. Closest were  Sayyid Qutb and the groups that were labeled Takfir wa-l-Hijra. What makes Salafism different from an  individual paranoid psychosis is that the paranoia about the evil (infidel) forces is part of a group ideology  that subsumes the individual to a larger collective, no matter how small it may be in reality.  cclxviii  The Islamic credo (Shahada).  cclxix  It is thus not simply a diversion technique, when registered Salafi groups in Germany declare in their  statutes quite general the “furtherance of Islamic religion, culture and education” to be their goal.  cclxx  Noteworthy is the flexibility with which the agents of evil can be identified as real people or, more  anonymously, as the invisible enemy, Satan. This flexibility ensures the possibility to project  contradictions within the Salafi movement onto the outside without necessarily having to attack the  mainstream society or larger Muslim community and thus avoiding negative response that could be  detrimental to the Salafi movement.  cclxxi Cf. Wiktorowicz, “Anatomy,” 210.  cclxxii Wiktorowicz wrote on the relationship of Salafis to rationality: ”For a Western audience, the  presentation seems almost mind numbing and lacks convincing argumentation. But it reflects the Salafi  rejection of human logic” (Wiktorowicz, ”Anatomy,” 212.) – It seems important to point out that Salafis  are not simply anti-rational as Wiktorowicz suggests. Not only is the plentitude of Salafi propaganda    </page> <page sequence="237">                                                                                                                                                                                                distributed by the latest means of communication (websites, forums, you-tube channels, blogs, online  lectures, facebook pages), proof to the acceptance of highly rational tools. Moreover, the rejection of  human logic often remains declarative and does not prevent the application of rationality if it suits the  purpose of the Salafi propagandist. Consider the following incident, which is proto-typical for the  pragmatic use of rational argumentation by Salafis if it suits their agenda: During a Salafi rally in the  West-German city of Munchengladbach Pierre Vogel, the probably best known Salafi preacher and  convert to Islam in Germany, asked one of a number of Christian protestors to join him on stage. A short  conversation followed:  Vogel: Do you think Jesus is God?  Protestor: Yes.  Vogel: Is God all knowing?  Protestor: Yes.  Vogel: God is all-knowing so Jesus is all-knowing. Does God lie?  Protestor: No.  Vogel: So then Jesus does not lie. Marcus 13, Verse 32. Jesus is asked: ”When is the Day of Judgment?”  He says: ”This I don’t know nor do the angels. God alone knows.” Did he lie here or does he not know?  Protestor: He does not know.  Vogel: He does not know? Well then he is not God. You just said yourself, God is all-knowing. The  protestor wants to answer and asks for the microphone. Vogel rejects and security is pushing the young  man off the stage. Vogel concludes: ”We just saw the truth. This is all we need. He said God knows  everything and Jesus does not know. I really don’t want to insult any faith. We are concerned with an  objective, factual approach.” Ironically, the structure of Vogel’s argument is exemplary of an Aristotelian  categorical syllogism, where the premises that 1. God is all-knowing and 2.Jesus does not know the date  of the Day of Judgment lead to the conclusion that Jesus cannot be God. – Aristotle: “A syllogism is an  argument in which, certain things being posited, something other than what was laid down results by  necessity because these things are so.” This is only one of many occasions where Salafis in Germany use  formal logic to dismiss Christian doctrine for its alleged irrationality. But such simple logic is only  welcome when it can be used against religious adversaries. From the realm of Islamic doctrine it is  banned. This is why the Salafis relation to reason could best be described as “pragmatic rationality” or  “pragmatic tabooing of reason” as was already hinted on pp. 40-45 of this paper.

The descendants of Muhammad Ibn Abd Al-Wahhab,  specifically Sulayman Ibn ‘Abdallah Al ash-Sheikh, expanded the concept to include all relations to the  kuffar, who they called to avoid contact with. Maqdisi finally uses Al-wala wa-l-bara to call for  disobedience against Muslim rulers until nothing but the rule of God is established in the respective  country. Cf. Wagemakers, “The Transformation,” 82-87, 95.  cccx  Faraj was one of the leaders of the EIJ. He was the head of the plot to assassinate Egyptian president  Anwar Sadat in 1981 for which he was executed 1982. Cf. Sageman, “Understanding Terror Networks,”  15, 30-33.  cccxi  Ibid. 92, 96.

While some Muslim scholars  hold the verse was abrogated through later revelations others claim it does only apply to certain groups of  believers under certain conditions or at a specific time in history. Cf. Friedmann, “Tolerance and  Coercion,” 102-106.  cccxiii  Wiktorowicz, “Anatomy,” 215.  cccxiv  Flaig summarized the status of a dhimmi in an essay (translation from German by the author): “The  subjugated people were not allowed to bear arms, they were unable to defend themselves and thus no full- valued men. Their shoes and clothes had to be cut in a special way in order to distinguish and ridicule  them. Christians and Jews had to wear specific colors (the Jewish badge derived from this  discrimination). Their houses had to be smaller and the doorsills lowered. They were not allowed to ride  on horses but only on donkeys so to constantly remind them about their degradation. They paid a special  tax (Jizya), which they had to hand over in person, whereby they received a slap at their head. They head  to lower their head in front of Muslims and walk on the left side. They had to tolerate beatings from  Muslims without being allowed to defend themselves. If a dhimmi hit back, his hand was cut or he was  executed. A testimony of a dhimmi against a Muslim was invalid. Muslims had to suffer only half a  punishment for crimes against a dhimmi and they could not be executed for an offense against a dhimmi.  Conversely, the cruelest forms of the death penalty were reserved for the dhimmis (burning at the stake,  flaying).” Flaig, “Essay: Djihad und Dhimmitude”. Regarding the inequality of Christians and Jews under  Muslim rule see also: Ye’or, “The Decline”.  cccxv  The pragmatic relationship of Salafism to rationality and logic has already been discussed. The term  “reasoning” can thus only be applied in a very limited sense: as thinking about contemporary issues by  identifying these issues with commands and incidents from early Islamic history. Jabri calls this  “fundamentalist reading” of history: “The future is subject to a reading that is based on the interpretation  of the past, but not the past as it actually happened but the ‘past as it should have been.’ But because there  never was such a past outside of the imagination, the perception of a coming future was never able to  distinguish itself from the idea of a future related to the past. [...] The fundamentalist reading bases on a  religious understanding of history in which history is but a moment that stretches into the present, into the  emotional life ...” The Matrix of Salafi Reasoning, hence, describes a reasoning without reason.

Even though he did operate within the Salafi Jihadi  network, most notably within AQ, he put forth a lot of criticism against the Salafis within the Jihadi  groups for causing factionalism and counter-productive infighting. Cf. Lia, “Destructive Doctrinarians,”  287.  cccxxvi  Wiktorowicz has already pointed out that all Salafis reject violence against civilians but that a part  of the movement would consider e.g. Western construction workers in a pre-dominantly Muslim country  as agents of an aggressive, imperialist attack and thus de facto legitimate targets.

In fact, less than 25% of all Muslims feel represented by any of the large Muslim  umbrella organizations. – Cf. BMI/DIK, “Summary: Muslim Life in Germany,” 9-10.  cccl  A 2007 study of the Federal Ministry of the Interior shows widespread attitudes of glorification of  Islam and derogation of Christian and Western society. 26% of the survey respondents absolutely agreed  with the idea “Only Islam is able to solve the problems of our time” and another 19% rather agreed,  which amounts to almost half of German’s Muslim population being at least open to ideas that Islam  should play a political role in Germany. The topic sexuality is the strongest indicator of contempt for  Western values. Almost half of the Muslim community absolutely agrees, “The sexual morals of the  Western societies are entirely corrupted”. A total of 71% support the notion at least to some extent.  Accordingly, 71.9% of Turkish parents see the German society as a threat to the religious and cultural  development of their children. Similarly alarming were the findings on attitudes towards violence. 17.9%  absolutely confirmed the statement “The threat the West poses to Islam legitimizes that Muslims defend  themselves with violent means.” Another 20.4% rather agreed with it. An item measuring the condonation  of suicide bombings found still 8.7% of German Muslims absolutely or rather not objecting to suicide  attacks. – Cf.

In July 2009 Fazazi wrote a letter from prison,  addressing German Muslims and saying “Germany is not a battle zone.” German authorities perceive  Fazazi’s change of mind to be sincere and hailed his letter as having led to intense discussions within  radical mosques in Germany. – Cf. “Radical Cleric Calls on Muslims in Germany to Reject Violence,”  Spiegel Online, 26 October 2009.  ccclxxxvi  “Radical Cleric Calls on Muslims in Germany to Reject Violence,” Spiegel Online, 26  October 2009.  ccclxxxvii  Official file of "Die islamische Gesellschaft in Berlin e.V.", registry court: Berlin,  registry number: VR8699B; Piper, "Al-Qaida und ihr Umfeld in Deutschland”; Crawford, "How  a Diplomat From Saudi Arabia Spread His Faith," The Wall Street Journal Online, 10 September  2003.  ccclxxxviii  Citation according: Crawford, "How a Diplomat From Saudi Arabia Spread His Faith,"  The Wall Street Journal Online, 10 September 2003.  ccclxxxix  Schmidt and Stark, "Unerwünschte Nebenwirkung," Spiegel Online, 3 April 2006;  Ramelsberger, “Der Imam taktiert,” Sueddeutsche Zeitung, 27 February 2004; EuGH, Verdict  from 11 October 2007, C-117/6; Piper, “Al-Qaida und ihr Umfeld in Deutschland,” 54-55.  cccxc  Ramelsberger, “Der Imam taktiert,” Sueddeutsche Zeitung, 27 February 2004; Official file  of "Die islamische Gesellschaft in Berlin e.V.", registry court: Berlin, registry number:  VR8699B.  cccxci  Piper, "Al-Qaida und ihr Umfeld in Deutschland,” 55.

Meziche recruited Sidiqi and the others in Hamburg’s Taibe Mosque. The group left in  late 2008 via different routes to the FATA area in Pakistan. Eight of them, including two women, were  said to have joined the IMU. Another Salafi from the Hamburg scene, Asadullah M., was said to have  arranged the logistics for the travel group. What sheds more light on the relations between the IJU, IMU,  AQ and the Taliban is the fact that Meziche’s group from Hamburg was associated with the German  Taliban Mujahideen. Rami Makanesi, German national of Syrian descend and resident of Hamburg, was  arrested June 2010 and extradited to Germany, where in May 2011 he was sentenced to four years and  nine months in jail. One of the Jihadis allegedly tasked to be in the team of attackers was Shahab Dashti,  also from the Al Taibe mosque. He was already known from an IMU video dating late 2009, in which he  called upon German Muslims to join the Jihad.

Cf. Ganor,”Defining Terrorism,”  287.   dvii  It has already been mentioned that none of the prominent preachers in Germany call publicly for  terrorist attacks in Germany (in the sense of deliberate violence against civilians) – even though a number  of them applauded or downplayed the shootings at Frankfurt Airport in March 2011. An in-depth  examination would also have to consider the difference between the perception of Jihadi actors like  HAMAS and Hizbullah, who mainly perpetrate acts of terrorist and guerilla violence against Israel and  who have a much greater degree of acceptance amongst the established organizations of Islamism in  Germany than AQ or its affiliates in e.g. Afghanistan, Pakistan, Somalia and Yemen.  dviii  The findings of this analysis that relies mostly on OSINT will naturally have to be considered with  caution.  dix  Brunswick has a population of about 10,000-15,000 Muslims. Around 10,000 Muslims live in  Munchengladbach.   dx  The clip has since been taken offline.

The hostility has clearly shown. We must not deceive ourselves. [...] Therefore there are  many people in Germany hostile to Islam. [...] We have to be prepared. One has tried to stop the  mosques. That means one has succeeded that we hardly appear in mosques anymore. Then one has  succeeded in destroying the halls so that we hardly get a hall anymore. The next step is one will try to  outlaw the association with any speculations. [...] The next step will be to try and pull out the videos  from the internet. But the problem is when thousands of Muslims download those videos and distribute  them. Brothers, we don’t know what will happen tomorrow. He have to be prepared. You have to meet in  your apartments.” "Über die Lage in Mönchengladbach; Entweder wir siegen oder...wir siegen!," online  clip, uploaded by user TheLightOfTheTruth on 9 April 2011,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tOXxRf7leE4  dxii  Interview with Claudia Dantschke, December 2010.  dxiii  The same was mentioned in an interview with Ciftci.  dxiv  One such preacher is the Egyptian Sheikh Abu Ishaq Al-Heweny. In 2010 he toured through Germany  and appeared on numerous occasions with preachers of EZP. In one speech on his website, titled “The  threat of the Jews,” he talks about the Jews as a wicked people with whom peace can never be achieved.  Hinting at alleged atrocities in Israel he asks to respond to terror with terror. Cf.  http://www.alheweny.org/aws/play.php?catsmktba=736  Another German Salafi preacher criticized the cooperation with Al-Heweny claiming many of his fatwas  about what makes a Muslim a kafir were wrong and that some authentic scholars even consider him a  mubtadi’ (innovator), takfiri and khawarij.

On a  seminar Abu Dujana even explicitly criticized a Salafi group from Bremen as takfiri and explains the  “correct understanding” of when somebody becomes a kafir. See: "Abu Dujana - Regeln desTakfir",  online clip, uploaded by DAWAFFM, January 4, 2011,  http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AE_NGcueYMM&amp;feature=related  dxxxiv  Cf. “Freitagspredigt-Chutbah,” Website of Neil Bin Radhan, http://durus.de/freitagspredigt- chutbah.html - The Website also includes a short biography of Radhan:  http://www.durus.de/kurzbiographie.html   dxxxv  Cf. Uwe Troppenz, “Keine Angst vor dem Islam!,” Website Al-Salaam.de, http://www.al- salaam.de/downloads/VortragAngstIslam2008AlNur.pdf - It also shows just how well Troppenz  could preserve right-wing stereotypes within his new Muslim identity and the German Salafi  movement.  dxxxvi  Ibid. 17  dxxxvii  This can be studied well amongst militant Salafis, who often claim that the result of their fight in  this world is unimportant as they will either achieve victory for Allah or die as martyrs and become  revered heroes in the next. This idea appears at times also amongst Salafi preachers with no imminent  Jihadi ambitions but facing severe hardships. E.g. Pierre Vogel in Munchengladbach: “But in the end we  will always win. [...] Either the victory will be that people adopt Islam or the victory will be that one will  be expelled and that through this striving Allah elevates one in level [of paradise] or that one is killed and  even becomes a shaheed. But the victory is with the believers.”  dxxxviii  In this paper only one such case was suggested. See the example of Uwe Troppenz pp.130- 131 and 140-141.  dxxxix  These shortcomings are the very small size of the sample, insufficient intelligence (i.e. data)  and, as a resultant of this, a set of rather broad analytical questions.    </page> </plain_text>
