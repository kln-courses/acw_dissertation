<plain_text><page sequence="1">ARCHAEOLOGY OF IL. 19, 387 AND OD. 1, 128* We know two Greek words to denote "spear-holder", oupvyÇ and ôo\)poÔÓKT|, both of which are found in Homer. ZupiyÇ appears in the "Iliad" in a scene (19, 387; see also 10, 13 and 18, 526) in which Achilles is preparing for battle: ÈK Ô' âpa aúpiyyoç rcaxpéiov eorcaaax' eyxoç... An inquisitive reader might ask himself how a spear can be stored in a panpipe. Mark W. Edwards tries to convince us that a panpipe is actually not involved at all: avpiyÇ, occurring twice in the "Iliad" for shepherds' pipes, is only here [at 19, 387, its third occurrence] used for a spear-case, but the basic meaning "pipe" gave rise to its use for various hollow objects in later Greek. SoupoSóien (Od. 1, 128) is different, a rack for several spears.1 This comment does not rank among the chief achievements of Edwards' admirable vol- ume. His source is the commentary of Walter Leaf,2 whose source was in turn Liddell &amp; Scott,3 for which the source is Eustathius,4 for whom the source may be the "Suda".5 I am unable to detect the source of the information in the "Suda",6 yet surely it was a scholar expert in tattle rather than in battle. I cannot imagine how such a case for a spear could be useful, and even if it could, II. 16, 139-44 must always be kept in mind while reading 19, 387-91 ,7 and that passage provides clear evidence that there are several spears in the oüpiyC. A clever solution to the problem was once unveiled by Arthur W. Verrall, according to whom avpiyÇ is here used to describe a rack for spears, but that seems no longer to be remembered: the oiípiyÇ [. . .] is strictly not a "spear-case" that the poet has in view, but a spear-stand, some- thing like that in which a modern Peleides keeps his guns or his billiard-cues, a frame with a series of holes and a box beneath. When filled with a set of spears, which would naturally vary in length, such a 6opaxo6r|KT| would have an obvious resemblance to the ovpiyÇ proper. Somewhat similar is Tcevxecrúpiyyov £úÀ,ov or stocks, with its five holes for the neck, hands, and feet [Ar. Eq. 1049]. 8 There is little to be added on the "spearpipe" subject, except the picture.9 AoDpoôÓKTi in the "Odyssey" is apparently similar; at 1, 127-9 we are told how Telemachus took care of Athena-Mentes' spear: * I am very grateful to Christopher Callanan, Adolf Köhnken, and Mikotaj Szymanski for helpful criticisms and suggesting valuable corrections. The responsibility for remaining infelicities lies solely with me. 1 M. W. Edwards, The Iliad: A Commentary, V.

Compare the Ôo\)poôÓKT| éúÇooç of a 128, which stands against a pillar in the house of Odysseus". 3 LSJ's oupiyÇ = "anything like a pipe", specifically "spear-case" has remained unchanged for too many years. 4 Eust. ad II. 19, 387: oupiyÇ Ôè Ô7cf| xiç £7tiur|KT|ç ôopáxov (J&gt;utaxKTiKf|, f\ Kai õoupoõóiav 5 Cf.

Stephanie West has noted: The ancients [i. e. scholiasts of Homer] supposed that the spear-shafts rested in the flirtings of the columns; alternatively, we might envisage a rack or a large jar (like an umbrella-stand) set against the pillar.10 I do not believe that spears, which are very unlike umbrellas, were stored in jars resem- bling umbrella-stands,11 but since due to the lack of evidence we can here appeal only to the imagination and common sense, obviously no strong argument can be made. And even if we exclude the "umbrella-stand" from consideration, the matter must be left open to doubt; ôovpoôÓKrj may have originally denoted a rack similar to the oõpiyÇ, but more elaborate hypotheses cannot be easily dismissed, such as the following: Was die Säulen im Hause des Odysseus betrifft, so scheint es mir wahrscheinlich, dass sie von Holz waren, entsprechend dem hölzernen Gebälk, und Cannelüren hatten. [. . .] Der Speerbehälter an einer oder mehreren Säulen im Saale wird in zwei Riemen oder Ringen bestanden haben, von denen der eine um den Fuss der Säule sich legte, während der andere etwa vier Fuss höher angebracht war. Die Cannelüren nahmen dann die Lanzen auf, die Riemen oder Ringe hielten sie fest.12 panpipes in vase-paintings and on coins (see G. Haas, Die Syrinx in der griechischen Bildkunst, Wien 1985, esp. figs. 101-6, 1 14-37 - they are all late, yet provide a better parallel than the elegant representation of the panpipe played by the muse on the Francois Vase, which is however the earliest known). That the spears in the picture vary in length is the arbitrary decision of the illustrator. This agrees with the common notion of the shape of panpipes, but disagrees with the results of present Musikwissenschaft. We are told that the trapezoidal shape is of Roman or Etruscan origin, while "the Classical Greek panpipe had a rectangular shape, all the tubes being cut to the same length and then blocked with wax to the depth necessary to give the required notes" (M. L. West, Ancient Greek Music, Oxford 1992, 111). Yet we know at least one example of the Classical Greek trapezoidal instrument: the persistently disregarded figurai vase from 460 BC (Louvre CA 1959, see Haas, 106, fig. 94), of which I hope to offer an extensive treatment elsewhere. Hence it is impossible to decide whether we should assume a rectangular or a trapezoidal shape for the "spearpipe" under discussion. The spears of Achilles are certainly of different length, as Peleus' spear is obviously larger than those chosen by Patroclus (at II. 16, 139; cf. also the gigantic, eleven cubits long spear of Hector at II. 6, 319, 8, 494), and if there are any trophies in the rack (as in the hut of Idomeneus, cf. II. 13, 260-5), they can differ in length being adapted to the height and abilities of their original owners (for the actual variety of spears in the Late Bronze and Early Iron Age cf. A. M. Snodgrass, Early Greek Armour and Weapons from the End of the Bronze Age to 600 BC, Edinburgh 1964, 115-39). Yet such variety is not in keeping with the conventional uniformity of hoplites' spears in vase-paintings, and one can easily imagine a spear-stand filled with spears of equal length. 10 S.

The vivid imaging inherent in this word reminds one rather of the military jargon of the Romans: testudo for "shelter of shields" provides a good parallel. The supposition that it was among common soldiers, and not in a poet's atelier, that the sense of spear-stand was transferred to crupvyÇ is supported by the low origin of the crupiyÇ proper.19 1 shall repeat after Maurice Pope: This suggests that [Homer's] language was not as remote from that of everyday use as some theories of epic diction would have us believe.20 Warsaw University Jan Kwapisz Illustrated by Anna Malesiñska 16 AoupoôÓKti literally "takes spears" (cf.
