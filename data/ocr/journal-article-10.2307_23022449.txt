<plain_text><page sequence="1">Four Female Novelists and Spanish Children's Fiction The most popular children's books in Spain are the translations of international favorites such as Grimm's fairy tales, stories by Hans Christian Andersen, and Disney books. Also popular are coloring books and stories about the Smurfs (Pitufos) and books by Spaniards who write juvenile fiction exclusively. In addition, some authors who are better known for their adult narratives have also written fiction for a younger audience. Valle-Incl5n wrote La cabeza del dragdn, and Miguel Delibes published his first children's book, Tres pajaros de cuenta, in 1982. Ana Maria Matute has produced many books for young readers, as has Carmen Conde, the first woman member of the Royal Academy. One of Dolores Medio's first publications was a play which she wrote to entertain her young students. Carmen Kurtz, winner of the 1956 Planeta Prize for her novel El desconocido, says she prefers writing for children because they are more appreciative and responsive to her efforts.1 Finally, Carmen Martin Gaite tried her hand at juvenile literature in 1981 with El aastillo de las tres murallas. In this study, selected children's works by the latter four women--Medio, Conde, Kurtz, and Martin Gaite--will be discussed. Representative works will be surveyed, and their purposes and styles of writing will be compared and contrasted. Dolores Medio's second published fictional work was also her only book for children. El milagro de la Noohe de Reyes (1948) is a combination of several original stories and modernized fairy tale classics which Medio wrote for her students and which they subsequently performed.2 As the title implies, the story takes place on the eve of January sixth. While the children sleep, the three kings approach with their entourages. Each is presented as an individual. King Melchor is described by an epithet reminis cent of the Cid: "el de la luenga barba blanoa." This old man, who brings gold to the Christ child from the Asiatic Courts, is stooped beneath a rich cloak, which is "un tanto desluoido [porque] . . . haoe mas de dos mil anos que reoubre los hombros del Prino-ipe de la Magia" (14). King Gaspar is a blond, blue eyed representative of Europe while King Baltasar is a black, Ethiopian king, representing Africa. Unfairly, he is not as popular as the other two because mothers tell their children he is the one who fills the shoes of bad children with coal. After this, the real series of stories is introduced by a literary convention. This one night every year, the miracle of the fairy Ilusidn allows the children to follow the star of the Magi. As they do, they arrive at the Great Bazaar where the Wise Men watch as the fairy brings all the toys to life, explaining their histories. In addition to such standards as Micifuz 40</page><page sequence="2">(Puss - in-Boots), Mickey Mouse, and Little Orange Riding Hood, Medio also presents stories about four other occupants of the Ba zaar. One occupant is Flor de Luz, the star which led the kings and the children that night. She was once a little page of Sefiora Luna, but because she often daydreamed and neglected her duties, she was dismissed, "despedida del cielo." On earth she is eaten by a little ass, who glows, thus appearing to be enchanted. At last Flor de Luz escapes but is terrified that she will be eaten again, possibly by a wolf: "ella es la Caperucita de las estrellas" (40). Finally, she is rescued by Hada-Ilusic3n, who gives her a throne atop a Christmas tree in the Great Bazaar. In another story a young princess who stole the seven colors of the rainbow from a personified Principe Iris is punished by being turned into a doll. Yet another doll's history resembles that of Pinocchio. A carpenter carves a small gnome of wood, who comes to life just as some children are teasing a cat. He becomes frightened and runs away. When the children promise not to harm him, he is reunited with the modern-day Gepetto, Tio Juan. Another toy, a small elephant named Senor Trompa, misses his wife, Osita Blanca, who was bought by a little girl named Marilis. The three kings decide to deliver the elephant and his two chil dren to Marilis' home next morning, thus reuniting the family. The remake of Little Red Riding Hood is humorous. The doll with an orange cape begs to become the real Caperucita, and her wish is granted. The grandmother is amazed that the little girl is so well-preserved after so many years in a fairy tale. When Caperucita finally meets the wolf, she looks in vain for the woodsman. In desperation, she offers a cake to the "ferocious" animal, who barks with delight. The humble dog leads her to his masters, some gypsies, who kidnap her. When she is rescued by Hada-Ilusi6n, Caperucita is content to be only a doll. One story leads to another until nearly daybreak, when the Wise Men rush off to make their deliveries. The book ends when the children awake on January 6. Although Medio's primary purpose is that of entertaining young children, her vocation as a teacher is obvious, for the stories contain subtle messages. The star's laziness and Papussa's burglary of the rainbow are both punished by a meta morphosis into a humbler creature. The importance of the family is stressed in the story of the elephant and his wife. Children are urged not to harm or tease animals in the story of the wooden gnome. Brief references to the Christ child are also subtly instructive: i[El Mago Melchor] ha ofrendado al Dios-Nino el oro de los Reyes! Por eso . . . trae los parpados entornados. Si sus ojos han contemplado la maravilla de las maravillas, £que le queda ya por ver? (14) For the same reason the eyes of Caspar "no podr^n ya despojarse de su dulzura" (15) and Baltasar "conserva . . . su expresi6n inocente y regocijada" (18). 41</page><page sequence="3">Medio captures the attention of young readers-listeners in several ways. First, she personifies elements of nature such as Seftora Luz, Amiga Nieve, Principe Iris, and Seftor-Suefio. Also, the Magi are seen as individual personalities. The presentation or revision of famous stories would appeal to children, who de light in hearing old favorites again and again. El Milagro de la Noahe de Reyes is heavily illustrated, making it visually appeal ing, and it uses many onomatopoeic sounds which would maintain interest auditorily. Medio's style is direct and rather simple so that a child would easily understand and be entertained by this, her only work for children. Carmen Conde, on the other hand, has written at least four teen books for young people. She expressed her enthusiasm for the genre in 1945 when she wrote: "Me apasiona escribir para la infancia, . . . aunque lo m£s probable es que me refiera a la remota infancia de los adultos."3 In our interview this past summer (1983), Conde stated that she believed the major purpose of young people's literature was to stimulate their imaginations, which have been stunted by passive television watching. Two works, Doha Centenito: Gata Salvaje (1943) and Zoquetin y Martina (1979) excel in modern fantasy and imagination, while the plays in A la estvella por la cometa (1961)--a collection written in collaboration with her husband, Antonio 01iver--are more tradi tional. k For example, El lago y la oorza is written entirely in octosyllabic verse and includes among its characters doncellas, Narcissus, Echo, a chorus, dryads, and an enchantress. The plot involves the casting of spells, metamorphoses, and other elements typical of a fairy tale or tale of chivalry. A young maiden who constantly looks into a mirror, seeking an apparently impossible lover, angers her father who believes that she is lazy and narcis sistic. Therefore, he puts a curse on her, turning her into a deer, thus fulfilling a prophecy made at her birth. The spell is broken only when she loves a young man and forgets her self-love. She is reunited with her parents who beg forgiveness, and the young man declares his love for her. The second play, El Conde Sol, combines characteristics of a fairy tale and those of a Byzantine romance. Occurring in the Middle Ages, the play has historical figures (King Don Juan II, Don Alvaro de Luna) as well as stock characters (a Moor, a Jew, a minstrel, and a oristiano viejo). Mistaken identities, a woman disguised as a man, and a final recognition scene all occur. On his wedding day, the Count is called by the king to be the leader of the Spanish forces against Portugal. In a traditional farewell scene between the newlyweds, the Count tells his bride that if he has not returned within six years, she may presume that he is dead and may remarry. When the deadline passes and no news has arrived, the Countess goes out in search of her husband, disguised as a female pilgrim. The Count, meanwhile, assuming that she has remarried, plans to marry another woman although he does not love the latter. In a recognition scene worthy of the Byzantine romance, the Countess asks her husband for a ring which he put on his hand the day they were married. The Count faints, and when he regains conscious ness, he begs forgiveness. As they walk off into the sunset, his 42</page><page sequence="4">fiancee faints, and a young country girl (straight from the sevvanillas of the Marques de Santillana) chases a cowherd. The third and final work in the collection, El monje y el pajavillo , is a didactic, religious play written in free verse. An estribillo introduces the main theme of the play: Porque mil anos en tu gloria, Senor, son como el dxa de ayer, que ya paso, y como una de las vigilias de la noche. (95) Inspired by this song, a young monk prays that he may understand God's perception of time, a prayer which the Virgin grants. He follows a bird which sings a beautiful song, gradually transform ing into an old man, unawares. He returns to the monastery three hundred years later, believing that he has been absent for one evening. When he fails to recognize any of the monks and then glimpses himself in a mirror, he exclaims: iSoy un viejo, soy un viejol Y hace horas, un muchacho• . ■ • Porque mil anos en tu gloria, Senor, son como el dfa de ayer, que ya paso. (108) He thanks the Virgin Mary, who addresses herself to the audience with the moral of the play: Y si alguno de vosotros tiene falta de sabidurxa, demandela a Dios, el cual da a todos abundantemente y no zahiere; y le sera dada. (110) God adds that one must ask in faith, doubting nothing. The chorus ends the play with a three-fold Alleluia. All three plays differ greatly from the other two works by Conde which were mentioned earlier. The first half of Zoquettn y Martina (1979) appeals to adult humor.5 The commentary on the importance of one's name exemplifies this. Those with the name Perez "tienen acceso, de repente, de cualquiera de las sesenta y cinco Academias con que cuenta una naci(5n que se respete" (4) . Conde, herself an academician (elected to the capital K seat in 1978--one year before the publication of this book), pokes fun at the proliferation of academies in Spanish-speaking countries. The better parts of the story contrast the world of children to that of adults, introduce fantasy, and include episodes from Conde's own childhood. Zoquetln learns that adults do not always say what they mean or practice what they preach. He hears his father tell an associate that he must "grab the bull by the horns." Days later, on an excursion to the country, Zoquetln follows his father's advice. After he is rescued by a rancher, he decides that adult language cannot be taken literally. The adult perception of time which seems to go too fast is also 43</page><page sequence="5">contrasted well with that of children who feel that they will never be grownups. Fantasy is introduced into the second part of the book in two ways. First, Zoquetln and his friend Martina have super natural friends: Zoquetln talks with a "caballito de mar," and Martina is often visited by the moon. Secondly, their mothers narrate stories which have hidden morals. An ambitious waterdrop, for example, learns that it should accept its identity and its fate. The other story teaches the importance of sharing in order to make others happy. The autobiographical parts of the story are especially well written. The cook in Martina's house tells her of digging for dwarfs when she was young. Conde's autobiography, Empezando la vida, contains the same story told by a servant.6 The explanation of the origin of large holes in the earth is also found in both works. Clouds drink from the sea, sometimes mistakenly taking up boats as well. When it rains, the boats fall, making holes in the earth.7 Martina, like Conde, goes to Morocco to live and makes Moorish and Jewish friends there. The story ends with a lesson about peace: Tenemos que defender [la paz] fuera de nosotros, para que vaya adquiriendo fuerza dentro de nuestro corazon. La paz es estar a bien con nosotros mismos. . . . Y olvidar. Y perdonar. Y que el amor nos rebose de tal manera, que manana estemos unidos como si nunca nos hubieramos desgarrado los unos de los otros. (54) In my opinion, the best work of the five works mentioned by Conde is Dona Centenito.Q One appealing perspective is maintained throughout the work--that of a wild kitten. Conde writes in the prologue: "El mundo visto por sus hermosos ojos tiene encantos que no vemos las personas, y una interminable serie de misterios que ella se esfuerza en desvelar" (3). Dofta Centenito and her five brothers are born when the Gato Alado leaves them between the paws of the sleeping mother cat. After many adventures, including befriending a young rabbit, Gazapo Lorenzo, Dofla Centenito is captured by humans and becomes the pet of a gentle little girl. Of particular interest in the story are the amusing anthropomorphic actions of the animals, understated lessons, and commentaries about humans. The animals appear to be almost human as they converse and prepare dinner or eat merienda. They pack their bags to leave the area when they discover there are six new cats in the forest. When Dofta Centenito is captured, her rabbit friend becomes a hermit: "se retiro a hacer vida solitaria, . . . trabajando en su huerta, fumando pensativo y callado como si no supiera nada del mundo" (37). Young listeners are taught the value of obedience when they realize the danger in which Gazapo Lorenzo finds himself because he ran away, against his father's wishes (9). Tolerance is also extolled when Grandfather Thyme convinces the kitten to become 44</page><page sequence="6">friends with the young rabbit despite the hatred which exists between their parents (10). The animals teach a lesson about the environment as well, commenting on human carelessness in the woods: enclenden fogatas que ponen en peligro grave el pinar. . . . Cuando se van se dejan el sitio lleno de papeles con grasa, pellejos de fruta y huesos de aceitunas. (27) Lessons on ecology in this work are ahead of their time, since the work was published in 1943. The story ends with Dona Centenito's interpretation of a house within her uncivilized perspective. She crosses the carpet, jumps onto the bed, and finds her little owner sleeping between the sheets: Andaha sobre un c6sped sin olor, seco; . . . encontrd un montecillo y salt&lt;5 a 61 para divisar el horizonte; encima, envuelta en nubes blancas, estaba la nifia. (48) While Conde's stated primary objective is the stimulation of imaginations, she also includes moral and social lessons in her works, as observed above. Similarly, Carmen Kurtz utilizes ad venture or fantasy while instructing her readers. The latter as pect predominates in several of her works, such as Primer aamino. Conoeimientos sociales. Written for classroom use, it includes elementary history, important Spanish legends, science, and social lessons. Kurtz is best known, however, for her juvenile fiction, having published some twenty-six novels and collections of stories for children and having made six children's films. On the back cover of Oscar, espeleologo , Kurtz is described thus: "Carmen Kurtz es una de las autoras contemporSneas de mayor prestigio, considerada internacionalmente una experta en litera tura juvenil e infantil. Sus libros se traducen al alem&amp;n y a.1 ingl6s." Her short story collection Piedras y trompetas (1981) is appropriate for children ages five to eight, approxi mately. Most have the feel and texture of new fables or fairy talcs, occasionally offering moral lessons. For example, the story "La Ovejita Negra" shows that prejudice is wrong. When the ovejita asks if it is bad to be black since she is shunned by the white sheep, the answer is: "Ser negro es como ser bianco. Y en ciertos casos es una ventaja. Si vienen los lobos, por la noche, no te verSn."9 In another story greed is defeated. It appears that most Spanish writers avoid the realities of birth in stories for children. Much as Conde's mother cat gave birth under unusual circumstances, Kurtz's "gigantona" gives birth when she is thrown into the air by a bison and has twins in her arms when she lands far away. In "La Princesa y la trompeta," young Leovig.ilda decides that she does not want to become a queen and die of boredom in a palace. Instead, she cuts her hair, dresses as a boy, and becomes a trumpeter. She has many adventures on 45</page><page sequence="7">her travels and enjoys life thoroughly. On her way home she meets a young prince who dreads having to marry the supposedly boring Princess Leovigilda, When her identity is revealed to him, he loves her and they marry willingly. The stereotypes are broken though the clichS ending remains intact. In another story in the same collection, a vain and greedy queen is punished and order is restored to the kingdom. Lastly, an ugly fairy learns that actions make one attractive and loved not outward appearances. Fifteen of Carmen Kurtz's novels feature Oscar Tur's adven tures, as an astronaut, atomic spy, spelunker, or secret agent. In others he has experiences at the Olympic Games, at the South Pole, in Africa, with a UFO, with frogmen, and with a laser. Although Oscar and his friends have Catalan names, they are shown to represent children everywhere: "Oscar--ese nifto corriente de de una barriada cualquier."10 Oscar, then, is an ordinary boy of twelve with an extraordinary imagination. Kurtz merges fiction and reality well, so that the reader is unsure if Oscar dreams his adventures or lives them. For example in Oscar, espta atomico, the protagonist sees a car in a spy movie which is simi lar to one belonging to some strangers in town. Oscar, therefore,_ deduces that the tourist couple are also enemy agents, and leaves the theater in order to stow away in the trunk of their car. Thus begin his adventures. Likewise, in Oscar, cosmonauta, the boy and his friends build a rocket, the Bfilido X-23. When he decides to test the rocket, he bumps his head. In this way Kurtz offers an excuse or reason for his fantasies. The author's use of detail makes even the most fantastic adventures seem believable. People, buildings, and resources on the planets Telo and Mars are vividly described. Neologisms are also presented as ordinary words, e.g., amertizaje is the landing of a vehicle on Mars and atelizaje is a landing on Telo. Thus the reader feels wonder but not disbelief. Fortunately, Kurtz avoids the usual conflict between children and adults in her works. Although all the villains are mature, there are also many helpful, understanding adult friends and parents presented. Juvenile readers would enjoy and identify with Oscar's vacillation between mature and childish actions. For example, when Oscar is discovered by the spies, "decidiS hacerse el tonto, conducirse como un nifto, admirarse de todo y mostrarse encantado con las novedades del viaje. ... En cuanto pudiera ponerse en contacto con la PUMBA, todo serla distinto."*1 Oscar always manifests a credible mixture of courage, fear, and bravado when facing danger. Obviously, entertainment and even escapism would be a young person's reason for reading the Oscar adventure books. Neverthe less, important lessons are also learned. Oscar chides his new friends who have ostracized another child: "A los amigos se les ha de tener amistad precisamente cuando van peor las cosas. Y si no, no vale" (Espta, 66). Kurtz also signals the dangers of t nuclear weapons research: "pese a que utilizamos para los ex perimentos dosis minimas de energla nuclear, nunca se sabe hasta ddnde puede llegar la expansion" (94-95) and, again, a scientist says to Oscar: 46</page><page sequence="8">Ojala todos los locos del mundo, todos esos hombres irresponsables que no vacilan en llevarnos a la catSstrofe, sintieran como tu. Ojala todos sintieran el amor a 'su cludad' y el respeto por la de los otros. (99) In Oscars cosmonauta the importance of freedom of thought and expression is stressed. Written in 1962 the work appears to criticize the Franco regime's insistence on conformity, for on Mars the miners are viewed as traitors because "no estfin con formes con nuestro modo de entender las cosas."12 In other novels the author instructs her readers about such diverse topics as the Olympic games, cave exploration, and the geography of Africa. Women are portrayed as equal to men in abilities and opportunities. Love for friends and family is a constant theme. Kurtz's books always end optimistically. Contrariwise, Martin Gaite creates a sad, mythic world in her first juvenile story. El castillo de las tres murallas , pub lished in 1981, would definitely not be standard fare for very young children. I believe that it would be understood best by adolescents and adults. The author's purpose seems to be entirely literary. She creates a microcosm in which the characters and the reader are isolated from the outside world. Within this gloomy atmosphere, a child's worst fears become reality as Altald's mother flees with a music teacher and her old father becomes increasingly aloof. Her only companions are her caged birds and a servant man named Cambof Petapel, who is more than one hundred years old. Altale feels a special affinity for the birds, since she too lives in an enclosed space as had her mother. On several occasions the castle is likened to a prison: "asl se pareclan [el tocador y el cuarto de costura] m^s de verdad a la carcel que eran" and the special room built for the baby Altaic "parecla una gran jaula."1-3 No joy exists within this walled castle, and there are creatures which inspire fear and repulsion. The twelve creatures which live in the dark green water of the moat are brundas, una especie de ratas gigantes de color rojo y cola de cetaceo. . . . Estaban muy nerviosas porque nunca dorraian. Sus ojos brlllaban con una fos forescencla amarilla, . . . [y] lanzaban un grito de alerta, mitad chillido de foca mitad graznido de cuervo, tan agudo y espeluznante que hubiera sido capaz de espantar ... a una cuadrilla de ladrones. (9-10) The horror of the brundas is also present within the castle in the person of Lucandro, Altaic's father, whose appearance is described as increasingly like that of the rats. Lucandro's soul is equally ugly for he embodies avarice: "nunca habla sido capaz de disfrutar de su riqueza. . . . Estaba rodeado de objetos sin vida que le esclavizaban" (9, 18). Even his daughter is consi dered a precious object to be hidden and protected, rather than loved. 47</page><page sequence="9">In this gothic environment, mythic events occur. Cambof often speaks in oriental-sounding riddles and discusses his previous lives as a princess, hermit, pirate, soldier, and an eagle. "Me he inuerto otras voces y no to crcas que se nota mucho," he says. He never finds out how he passes from one state to another (19). In the end, Cambof dies but reappears as Amir, the young leader of a revolt against Lucandro. Amir loves Altale and takes her away to search for her mother. AltalS recog nizes both Cambof*s voice and his ring which Amir now wears. Another form of metamorphosis-reincarnation occurs when Lucandro disappears and a thirteenth brunda is found in the moat the next day. All the events surrounding the castle are mysterious. No one in the village has ever been inside its three walls. The villagers are shocked to learn that Lucandro has a wife, because they have never seen anyone enter or leave there. There are two messages in El castillo de las tres murallas. First, greed is seen as a horrid, destructive sin. Secondly, Martin Gaite presents a social commentary. Lucandro's exploita tion of the villagers whom he ignores is criticized severely. Altaic approves of the villagers' taking over more land to culti vate since they are hungry and must continue to pay tribute to her father regardless of the scant harvests. When Amir is im prisoned for his activities, he escapes magically with the help of one of AltalS's birds. The mythic hero thus triumphs over the corruption of a typical Spanish landowner. The ending is too ambiguous to be described as a happy one. However, Altaic does escape and hopes to find her mother. The reincarnations as well as the oppressive ambience of the work would probably confuse and/or frighten a young child, while older children and adults would be intrigued by this tale. Martin Gaite seems to believe that the work is appropriate for all ages, for she writes in the introduction to her work: Tal vez este cuerito pueda gustarles tambien a los mayores, lo mismo que los anteriores de la autora podria entenderlos uri nino. Porque no hay razon para que a los ninos y a las personas mayores tengan que gustarles cosas distintas. (8) The four writers discussed here use fantasy to capture the attention of their young audience. Supernatural elements are prevalent in Medio's M-ilagvo de la Noohe de Reyes, in the three traditional plays by Conde (A la estvella pov la aometa), and in Carmen Martin Gaite's El castillo. Carmen Kurtz artfully com bines imagination and reality in the Oscar series. Moral or social lessons are often disguised within an interesting story to a greater or lesser degree in all the works. While all four women entertain their readers, each differs in style and tone. Medio's play and Conde's stories appeal to a younger audience as do Kurtz's short stories (Piedras y tvompetas). The latter's adventure novels would be appreciated by young adolescents while 48</page><page sequence="10">Carmen Martin Gaite's El oastillo de las tres muvallas is most suitable for older readers, liunice L).
