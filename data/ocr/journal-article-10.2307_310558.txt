<plain_text><page sequence="1">PLATO'S VIEW OF POETRY 1 By WILLIAM CHASE GREENE ANY one who reads the dialogues of Plato even superficially is bound to be first surprised, then perplexed, by the treatment that poetry receives at the hands of the philosopher. A further reading discloses such apparent inconsistencies that one is tempted to ask whether Plato really had a definite view about the value of poetry. Himself an artist endowed with a richly poetic spirit, he never wearies of quoting the poets. At times he appears to attribute their art to divine inspiration 2 or to a form of madness.3 In his ideal state a large part of the education of the young is based on the study of certain kinds of poetry. Nevertheless he fiercely criticizes poetry as a whole, and professes to banish the tribe of poets from his commonwealth; they are perverters of morality, mere imitators and deceivers, and their art is concerned with the world of appearance, not of reality. So, as the founder of a city, he insists upon the ancient quarrel between phi- losophy and poetry; 4 the legislator can brook no rival.5 If we turn to modem critics for an explanation of these apparent contradictions, we are met by most divergent views. J. Reber 6 holds that Plato criticizes poetry because it is imitation,7 because the artist is ignorant of the things which he imitates,8 and because poetry ad- dresses itself to the lower faculties of man, with which he can not grasp truth.' Reber therefore concludes that Plato, loyal to a political pur- pose, definitely deprives poetry of its freedom.10 Again, F. Stiihlin " defends a similar view with greater thoroughness, and concludes12 that 1 This essay in its original Latin form, entitled Quid de poetis Plato censuerit, was presented in 1917 in partial fulfilment of the requirements for the degree of Doctor of Philosophy in Harvard University. 2 Ion, 534 c.

On the other hand, J. A. Stewart,' holding that the Platonic doctrine of ideas is a method of accounting for concepts in use, goes so far as to contend that it is in poetry that we come into contact with reality that is timeless, because the poet concentrates his attention on that which interests him; and " groups which interest us as groups acquire a coherence which makes them what we call 'Things.' " 2 Thus it is only in the world of aesthetic experience that there are eternal and immutable archetypes.3 Stew- art's views are criticized by J. Burnet4 and by A. E. Taylor.5 Burnet argues that for Plato the Form of the Good is the E uYLro70 p40j6ya, and that judgments of value are impossible without the exer- cise of the intellect, since they imply a reference to the Good, which is known by the intellect only. He urges that for Plato everything is mythical except the ideas; in the world of sense and of time, knowledge ceases and myths become appropriate. And Taylor points out that the account which Stewart gives of the e677 neglects the fact that Plato represents the scientific treatment of them as an act of contem- plation. Further, the discussion of poetic imagination and of mystic reverie that Stewart gives us, however interesting and valuable it may be, can not take the place of a sober examination of the dia- logues of Plato. The question of Plato's views is, despite Stewart's contempt for the " Critics, most of whom have attended too much to the letter of Plato's text," 6 not so much one for the psychologist as for the student of Plato's own utterances. The problem which con- fronts those who are puzzled by the apparent inconsistency in Plato's writings and by the disagreement of modern interpretations, is: What sort of truth did Plato attribute to poetry, and what is its relation to philosophy ? Did Plato really intend to exclude the poets from his polity ? 1 J. A. Stewart, The Myths of Plato, Oxford, Igo5; his reply to a review of this work by J.

And we shall listen in a friendly manner; for we are likely to profit if she proves to be not only pleasant but useful." 1 For a study in Plato one could ask for no better imprimatur than the authority of the philosopher himself. It is chiefly in Plato's own works, then, that we must look for the answer to the challenge. And if we examine them carefully, perhaps we shall discover that the explanation of Plato's apparent inconsist- encies is not the hopeless task that some writers have thought it to be. When one remembers how far divergent are the views of the most eminent scholars on this point, it seems pertinent to ask why such differences of opinion with regard to the same author are possible. A great deal of the current misunderstanding of Plato's views about poetry is due to an examination of only parts of his writings and to an attempt to fit these into a formula which is assumed to represent the Platonic philosophy. Those who consider chiefly the Republic carry away only the impression that he banished the poets and denied poetry all access to truth; whereas those who think chiefly of the Phaedrus often remember only the apotheosis of poetic madness, and suppose that Plato intended to dethrone the reason. It is therefore, of the greatest importance to consider every piece of evidence, even when it is imbedded in logical discussions. Above all, it is important not to regard each passage as an isolated dictum, but to consider it in its relation to the context, and in relation to Plato's historical and philo- sophical milieu. Though such a precaution would doubtless be neces- sary in the case of most philosophers, it is supremely necessary in the case of Plato; for Plato, more than any other philosopher, adapts his procedure to the circumstances. It is a commonplace that we must never forget that his dialogues are dramatic; but we often forget what that implies. We must remember that Plato's own thoughts are actors in the drama, and make their exits and their entrances in ac- 1 Rep. 607 d.</page><page sequence="4">4 William Chase Greene cordance with the plot, sometimes, as it were, in the spirit of the mime. The phase of any subject that shall be presented on any particular occasion is therefore determined by the particular interest of the oc- casion; another occasion may suggest that a contrasting phase be introduced. Many remarks about poetry and inspiration and imita- tion are no more intended to be regarded as Plato's ultimate views than are the ironical and dialectic obiter dicta and excursus of his logical discussions. Sextus Empiricus, no doubt a prejudiced witness, tells us: 1 " Some said that Plato was a dogmatist, others that he was a doubter, still others that he was at times a dogmatist, at times a doubter." It transpires nevertheless that in almost every case where Plato discusses poetry he seems to play the role of doubter. A dilemma confronts him, and he solves as best he can the particular problem, never imagining that he has disposed of the whole question. The examination of the occasion and of the context ought to help us in determining how Plato came to make each remark, and how far it goes to show that all his remarks together imply a definite belief in the value of poetry.2 At the outset we must ask what evidence is fairly to be admitted in our investigation. One would suppose, to be sure, that the natural recourse for light on the views of Plato would be to the dialogues of Plato. But although we have always realized that Plato is a dramatic artist and that we must be on our guard against imagining him to speak at all times in propria persona, we have lately been told by Taylor 3 and by Burnet 4 that much that we had been prone to regard as dra- matic is in truth historical, and is to be regarded as giving an account not of Plato's thought but of that of Socrates, who thus becomes a Pythagorean and Orphic philosopher, the head of a cult, and the champion of a well-developed doctrine of ideas. If this is true, our evidence for the views of Plato is much decreased. Yet the grounds on which this evidence is denied us are slender.5 Unconvinced by 1 Hypotyposes, i, 221. 2 Cf. P.

(i) It is not clear that Xenophon, the author of the Anabasis and of the Hellenica, was incapable of writing serious history, or that his picture of Socrates is essentially false. He expressly denies that Socrates was interested in mathematics and science; he is silent with regard to any " inner circle " of Pythagoreans and with regard to the theory of ideas. If Xenophon was trying to refute charges of impiety based on no- torious facts, his silence is a strange sort of refutation. (2) Aristotle doubtless derived most of his information about Socrates from Plato; but he need by no means have learned all that he knew from Plato's writings; in fact, he frequently distinguishes between the historical Socrates and the dramatic character Socrates in the dialogues. The passages in which Aristotle most ex- plicitly tells of the genesis of the theory of ideas (Met. I. 987 a 32-b o0; 13.1078 b 9; cf. also 13. io86 a 32) make it clear beyond all possibility of doubt that Aristotle sharply distinguished between Socrates, who was responsible for universals and definitions, and Plato, who was the author of the doctrine of ideas. (3) The so-called Pythagorean comrades of Socrates were only in a limited sense Pythagoreans; and it is at least as significant that these young men (cf. Phaedo, 89 a 3) were Socratics. So it is fair, I think, to hold against Burnet (Early Greek Philosophy2, p. 355) that when " we " discuss a familiar theory of ideas (Phaedo, 76 d 8; 75 d 2; and passim), " we " means not an older philosophical school but simply " you and I," the speakers in the dialogue. (4) In adducing Plato's dialogues as evidence, we must distinguish between the one dialogue in which a certain degree of historical exactness was to be expected and the other Socratic discourses which were, according to Aristotle (Poetics, 1447 b 4) a form of poetic imitation. In the Apology, Plato could hardly make any actual misrepresentation; in it not only is there no reference to Pythagorean or Orphic cults in either accusation or reply, but Socrates declares that his interest is not in the teaching of specific philosophical or scientific tenets but in practical life. He expressly rules out of court one of Taylor's chief witnesses, Aristophanes (18, 19), and explicitly denies the charge of an inner circle of pupils (33). (Burnet, in The Socratic Doctrine of the Soul, Oxford, 1916, makes much of the use in the Apology of the word #vx1; in a specialized sense. But that the word as used by Socrates did not imply what we mean by an " immortal soul " seems clear, I think, from Xen. Mem. 3. 10, 7; 3- 3, 14; 4. 8, 1; 1. 4, 9, 13, 14, 17.) The interest of the other Platonic dialogues varies from the purely ethical to the metaphysical. If</page><page sequence="6">6 William Chase Greene Though he began by considering the topics that interested Socrates, his interests expanded and his doctrine developed far beyond their origin. Taylor and Burnet, on the other hand, are in the present case interested in the history of philosophy; unfortunately their very in- terest has prevented them from applying a proper canon to the his- torical evidence involved. When Plato declared in the Republic 1 that there was an ancient quarrel between philosophy and poetry, he was stating no more than the truth. He did not invent the quarrel; he found it already old, and he was so much impressed by its importance that he undertook to solve it. We are too often inclined to remember only that Plato used the phrase " ancient quarrel " in the Republic, and to neglect both the long development of thought that preceded his treatment of the problem and the survivals of older creeds that were potent even in his day. In order to understand Plato's discussion, we must trace rapidly the his- tory of the quarrel ab ovo. And that means that we must realize as vividly as possible the conflict between emotion and reason, between the immediate intuition and the progressive discovery of truth that Socrates really had a theory of ideas at the centre of his philosophy, it is curious that Plato should have expounded this philosophy in some ten dialogues, according to the ordinary arrangement of the works, before he mentioned it at all. It is cer- tainly more natural to explain the silence of the dialogues before the Phaedo as indicating that Plato did not regard the doctrine as Socratic, and that he resorted to it after some years of speculation, influenced not only by the interests of Socrates but by those of the Ionian scientists and of the Pythagoreans. Because his interest came primarily from Socrates, however, he continued to express his opinions through the mouth of his master. Similarly, we are not surprised to find in the dialogues earlier thinkers - as Parmenides - discussing doctrines that they could not have known, or the " Pythagorean " Cebes defending a distinctly Heracleitean view (Phaedo, 86 e ff.). We notice that although the theory of ideas is mentioned as familiar (Phaedo, 76 d) it is nowhere in the dialogues explained in detail. It is natural to suppose that the introduction of the theory in this way is a mere literary device, and that Plato reserved a more exhaustive account of it for his oral dis- courses in the Academy; we know from Simplicius that several of his pupils pub- lished their notes on his lecture on the Good. And it is by no means necessary to hold that Plato's own conception of his doctrine was ever entirely definite and capa- ble of complete demonstration; it was a living thing, rather than a formula. 1 Rep. 607 b.</page><page sequence="7">Plato's View of Poetry 7 was a part of Greek life and thought. For in Greece, as in all countries, men found that their lives were controlled by two forces; the power of instinct and the love of reason. Man acts before he knows why he acts; so it is not surprising that the earliest records of Greek civiliza- tion must be sought not in science or in history, but in religion and poetry. In these activities the early Greeks expressed their concep- tions of their relation to the world about them and of the way that they must act toward it. When they asked what might be the source of their ideas, they could not do otherwise than reply that the gods had inspired them. The Greeks generally held that this immediate approach to truth was a gift of the gods. Dreams, for example, were a vision of the truth, though there were false dreams as well as true,' and Prometheus taught men to distinguish the true from the false.2 Pindar says that the soul alone " is from the gods; it sleeps while the limbs of the body are active, but when they sleep it gives in dreams clear knowledge of future joys and troubles." 3 Socrates is said to have inferred the day of his death from the dream of a woman who quoted Homer; 4 and Plato distinguishes between dreams in which man's lower nature con- trols and those in which the reason rules; these may attain truth.5 Some persons are divinely endowed with a greater gift than ordinary mortals possess. In Homer, prophets like Teiresias, Helenus, and Calchas know the divine will, and expound it to the common people; they interpret dreams and omens and portents. Others act under the inspiration of madness; the L&amp;bvTS is especially &amp;Oeos. Cassandra is 4pEvopav7~s and Oeo46ppros,6 since she has the bpOoavretas rb6vos.7 Plato gives an account of the common belief of his day about avrrtKci vOeos which is better, as a divine gift, than human aw4poarbv.8 And he mentions, as examples of divinely-inspired tellers of truth, i ev AeXXoZs rpo7^4Ats al 7' vp Aowfc vy lppetat ,taveaoatu. The gods spoke through the lips of the prophets at the oracles. The Olympian religion was closely related to the established order of the state; it could be invoked in the interest of conventional morality 1 Od. ig, 562. 2 Aesch. Prom. 485. 8 Pind.

To question the right of kings would have been an offence not only against law but against religion. For the individual, accordingly, the old religion had little significance; it could not solace him in distress or give him hope of a happier life in the hereafter. In the political revolutions of the sixth century, it is not surprising that the tyrants founded their claims on other grounds, and were inclined to favor newly-discovered forms of religion that promised greater contentment to the common people whose champions they professed to be. And these new forms of religion offered immediate revelations of divine things not only to privileged persons but to ordi- nary men, satisfying their desire for a more abundant life, a life of greater hope and significance than their daily round. So arose the ritual of the Eleusinian mysteries, so too the intoxication of Bacchus and the ecstasy of his worshippers. His religion was purified, the Greeks supposed, by Orpheus.? The principle of Orphic worship is that its initiates may attain divine life; they become bo~o.2 In order to secure this end, the initiates lived a sober life, and engaged in various symbolic rites that survived from the more savage Dionysiac ritual. In later years these observances were carried to absurd lengths, and became the object of ridicule.3 Both the Eleusinian mysteries and the Orphic religion encouraged their adherents to believe that through initiation and their presence at certain rites they could win blessedness.4 Yet the act of initiation or of participating in the rites was not an intellectual act; according to the testimony of Aristotle, " the initiated do not learn anything so much as feel certain emotions and are put into a certain frame of mind." 5 And all that we know of the ritual suggests that it consisted of the enactment of a simple drama and of spoken formulae.6 Of the mysteries, the central part was the iroarrela, which meant either the revelation to sight of symbols or the beholding of a play that repre- sented the union of the human and the divine. In the Orphic ritual carried on at the oracle of Trophonius near Delphi, there was a vision 1 Diod. Sic. 3, 65. 2 Cf. Eur. Cret., Frag. 475: B6Kxos &amp;XnOv 6r&amp;0wels. 3 Cf. Theseus in Eur.

Not different from the early Greek view of religion was the view of poetry. As the gods sent dreams and inspired prophets, so they in- spired bards. So in Homer the blind bard Demodocus was " beloved by the Muse " who gave him the gift of song; and is " impelled by a god."4 Phemius, we find, was "self-taught but god-inspired." Homer himself appeals for knowledge of his story to the Oet or to the MoDTa.6 And the Muses are the daughters of Memory.7 Democritus held that " all that a poet writes under the influence of enthusiasm and of holy inspiration is exceedingly beautiful "; 8 he " denies that any one can be a great poet unless he is mad." 9 Plato, whether seriously or ironi- cally, was giving only the current notion of the poet when he referred to Homer as divine.10 Through the poets, then, the gods speak, and in poetry the people seek for truth. At Athens, the poems of Homer were familiar in the sixth century; by the fifth century, Homer had become the "educator of Hellas.""1 In fact we have in the Protagoras of Plato, in the course of an argument intended to show that virtue can be taught, a picture of the Athenian boy's education in virtue; a large part of it consists of the study of the poets.12 This description, we notice, comes from the famous sophist who was the arch-champion of humanism in the conflict that was be- ginning between humanism and science. 1 Paus. 9. 39, 5-14. 2 Cf.

Xenophanes, the first to rebel against anthropomorphic religion, declared, " Homer and Hesiod have imputed to the gods all that is blame and shame for men." 1 Heracleitus exclaimed, "Homer and Archilochus deserved a sound thrashing," because they held that happiness is dependent on the will of Heaven.2 And Pythagoras was said to have seen in the lower world the soul of Homer hanging from a tree, encircled by serpents, for his words about the gods.3 The poets were apt to retaliate against these rebels; the philosophers who reduced the universe to a mechanism resembled barking dogs.4 And in reply to those critics who were shocked by the obvious moral inferiority of the Homeric gods, judged by the standards of their own day, the students of Homer had at- tempted to interpret the poet by finding in him allegorical meanings.s Theagenes of Rhegium suggested a double interpretation: the names of the gods expressed either the mental faculties of man or the elements of nature. Antisthenes was a commentator on Homer; 6 the poet rd tcav 66 a rh 4 &amp;iaOe~lX e~ p rax, he held. He, too, interpreted the poet allegorically, denying that Eros was a god, and calling him mere KaKta But the " ancient quarrel" between philosophy and poetry lay still deeper. It was not enough for the humanists to apologize for Homer's lapses in morality, to allegorize his gods, or to turn their backs on science as a profitless and confusing pursuit, and to expound trivial matters in the poets 8 or to discuss the characters of Homer, as did Gorgias 9 and Hippias.10 For science and philosophy were raising more profound questions. Men were asking about the nature of reality and the meaning of knowledge. What could men know ? The earliest Greek thinkers, to be sure, had not put the question in this form. They had not realized that the relation of man to nature involves man as much as it involves nature. But the very one-sided- ness of their views had brought to light the need for the larger question. Plato suggests that the contradictions brought to us by the evidence of our senses are the source of our inquiry into the nature of being. For 1 Sext. Emp. Math. 9. I93. 2 Diog.

Water, the boundless, air - these were their names for the primal unity in diversity. The Pythagoreans fixed upon number as the counterpart of reality, and therefore as their chief study. Heraclei- tus, scornful of the opinions of the mob and of the poets, declared " Wisdom is one thing. It is to know the thought by which all things are steered through all things." 2 This " thought " or law,3 he holds, is the unity of the many conflicting things that we perceive, and the plurality of the one. Plato says that Heracleitus remarked that it was safest to say that reality is both many and one and is kept together by Hate and Love.4 Burnet has pointed out I that the discovery of Heracleitus can not be called a logical principle. Logic, it is true, did not exist as a specialized branch of study; but Heracleitus was trying with the best logical instruments at his command to state a paradox that has always existed and that will always exist. Later thinkers did, indeed, use the doctrine of Heracleitus as the basis for a logical theory; since the only permanent thing was change, the only knowledge must be relative. The Eleatics, in their several ways, demonstrated the unity of na- ture.6 Aristotle tells us that Parmenides believed only in a sensible reality; 7 this sensible universe is one; it can not change, or it will become what it is not - which is absurd. In order to account for change, it is necessary either to deny that reality is one or to deny that it is merely sensible. Empedocles therefore, supposed there were a number of physical elements, two of which, Love and Strife, caused change. He made no distinction between thought and perception.8 Anaxagoras conceived of an infinite number of elements, whose mo- tion was caused by voDs, which, however, is nothing more than a material substance. Leucippus dispensed with any imputation of a rational principle. But it was not hard for Zeno to attack such posi- tions; his book " argues against those who uphold a Many, and gives 1 Cf.

Confused by such contradictions, the teachers of Greece naturally supposed that science must be incapable of discovering an absolute truth. They therefore abandoned inquiry into the unity of the world of sense, and sought for principles of human conduct. Yet in the world of human affairs they found no less confusion; opinions and customs vary. From this Protagoras concluded that what appears to each man is for him true. Though he probably did not himself hold that knowledge consists entirely of sensations, Plato intimates in the Theaetetus 2 that the doctrine was held in his own time, and that he regarded it as sprung from the doctrine of Protagoras, which in turn was the offspring of the flux of Heracleitus. What Protagoras really was interested in maintaining was doubtless not the fluidity of the outer world, but the positiveness of the perceptions. The result was however, the same; there can be no absolutely true statements which are true for all persons, and judgments about particular things are all that we can make. This doctrine certainly was held by Aristippus. Gorgias maintained by means of Eleatic dialectic that there is no truth at all. Such was the world in which Socrates began to teach. The poets and their interpreters still claimed a divine inspiration as the warrant for the truth of their works. Ordinary men believed, if not in all the mythology of the old Olympic religion, at least in a world of super- natural powers that spoke to men through dreams and oracles, and that could even be approached by means of rites which made men blessed. Eternal things could be seen, things that satisfied men's craving for perfection and for union with a world larger than them- selves. Concerning the physical world, to be sure, the wisest men dif- fered, and their opinions involved them in absurd contradictions. In matters of conduct, however, it was possible to learn enough to be a good artisan, a good soldier, a good citizen; and there were clever foreigners to teach them how to speak well in the courts and to explain the old literature to them. In human affairs all was relative; but even 1 Plato, Parm. 128 d. I Theaet. 152 a ff.</page><page sequence="13">Plato's View of Poetry 13 what was accepted as ordained by convention was often valuable in practice; those who did not choose to obey it were deterred by no dictate of an absolute right or wrong. For every man, his own percep- tion was the most positive thing that existed. The work that Socrates set before himself was to find in this world of flux and confusion certain permanent principles. It is customary to emphasize the skepticism of Socrates, the man who knew only that he knew nothing. We ought long ago to have been put on our guard against these rational doubters. Descartes built a colossal system on a smaller foundation. It is not likely that Socrates would have under- gone poverty, ridicule, and death simply to convince Athens of his ignorance.1 It is clear that Socrates distinguished between the sub- jects in which sure knowledge can not be found and those in which we can know something. He had nothing but ridicule for those con- temporaries who speculated about the physical universe and its laws; they were not only ignorant of human affairs, but were vainly trying to learn what man can never learn. Speculation about it led to the most inconsistent explanations, and in the end had no practical appli- cation.2 He himself, however, discoursed on human affairs, trying to define 7r eoeIbaO, r7 &amp;oaeIEs, r6 KaXbv, r7 alaxpb6v, and other concepts of the same type.3 And in the definition of these qualities, he was always using an inductive method and citing analogies drawn from those practical arts where, for ordinary purposes, no one could doubt that something fixed could be found. For him the type of all knowledge was that possessed by the artisan, who knows how to apply special knowledge to appropriate ends. Indeed, his ideal of knowledge is not really that of science but that of art; and this conception tinges not only his ethical notions but even his idea of creation as teleological. For example, his interpretation of " yvw-OL aeavr6v " might almost be paraphrased as: " know what you can do for the service of mankind." * He was in fact always trying to find the peculiar capabilities of his as- sociates for special purposes; 5 hence the virtues are different kinds of knowledge. And his whole account of the physical universe is directed 1 Cf. Burnet, The Socratic Doctrine of the Soul, pp. 7-II; A. W. Benn, The Greek Philosophers2, pp. Io4-Io6. 2 Xen. Mem. I.

So far Socrates answered the doubters of his own time. It is possi- ble, he asserted, by looking into the mind of man to find and by rational discourse to fix principles of conduct. Yet there is another side of his creed. Xenophon tells us that Socrates advised a resort to divination in those affairs whose termination was doubtful, but not in those in which the result was a necessary consequence of certain acts; 2 it was in accordance with this view that Socrates would depend at times not on the exercise of reason but on a god-given voice, that aLupbbvY Tt whose promptings were never reducible to the form of connected reasoning. It was for this reason, too, that he observed the vb6os r'bXews in matters of religion, and obeyed divine injunctions.3 In like manner, Socrates quoted the poets often, as popular con- veyers of knowledge.4 Yet he finds that because they can not account for their wisdom they are ignorant,5 unlike the artisans, who have learned how to make things adapted to special uses. Art, then, is a technical matter; and things are not absolutely beautiful, but are good or beautiful only with regard to purposes for which they are adapted.6 He takes it for granted that sculpture is an imitation of visible objects, yet holds that it should be more than literal imitation; it should try to imitate expression and emotions.7 If there is any his- torical element in the Phaedo, it must be in the opening passage; and there Socrates is represented as debating how to express in a myth the abstract idea of the relation of pleasure and pain.8 Throughout all his restless life, a life that combined the ardor of the prophet with the common-sense of the man of affairs, Socrates main- tained these two aspects. To him, a life that did not examine ration- ally the ethical concepts that guided it was no life at all; on the other hand, he did not give up a faith in powers and motives that transcend reason. 1 Xen.

View of Poetry 15 II That Plato, the happy son of a happy age, grew up under the influ- ence of poetry, seems certain. As a member of an aristocratic family in comfortable circumstances, he must have had the traditional educa- tion in Homer and the other poets whom he so frequently quotes, even to the end of his life, with signs of respect. We can detect in the words which he puts into the mouth of Socrates 1 the affection which he felt for Homer even when he was preparing to express the most severe censure on the whole tribe of poets: " And yet a certain friendship and a respect that I have felt from boyhood keeps me from speaking about Homer; for of all these fair tragic poets he seems to be the first teacher and leader." We need not believe implicitly the tradition that he wrote a great deal of poetry in his youth, but burned it when he came to know Socrates; nor are we obliged to hold that the poems which have come down to us under his name are genuine, or again to trust the story that later in his life he used to sleep with a copy of the mimes of Sophron under his pillow. For even without these pleasant tales, we can readily perceive in his own writings an instinct for beauty that is akin to poetry, and that occasionally kindles his discourse with a divine flame. Yet his great master had discovered that the poets understand nothing of what they say; their poems are the result not of ao4ia but of 4bTLs L s; they write VOovmaL'OTves &amp;rirep ol OOLVTELs KaL oL XPpr'l,.~coL.2 So Plato himself, in his first 3 consideration of poetry, takes up just this problem: how much do the poets know, and what is the source of their knowledge ? One who reads the Ion might almost imagine him- self to be present at one of those conversations with the poets that are mentioned in the Apology. The conceited rhapsode Ion, who professes a superlative ability to expound Homer, is unable to account for his 1 Rep. 595 b. 2 Apology, 22 a-c. 3 In this study it seems unnecessary to discuss the chronology of Plato's dia- logues; I shall assume them to have been written in the order in which they are placed by Lutoslawski (The Origin and Growth of Plato's Logic, London, 1897). It will be seen that I am far from accepting all the methods and results of Lutoslaw- ski; but his arrangement of the dialogues is of service to all students of Plato, whether they acknowledge the fact or not.</page><page sequence="16">i6 William Chase Greene inability to rhapsodize except in the case of Homer.- Socrates sug- gests that it is not by virtue of any re~xtY that Ion can discourse about Homer, but that a Oda b vacLs moves him, like a magnet.2 The Muse communicates her inspiration from one inspired person to another. So the poets: " For all good poets compose their beautiful poems not by art but by inspiration and in a state of possession; and good composers of songs are not in their senses when they write their beautiful songs, but are just like Corybantes who are not in their senses when they dance. . . . For a poet is a light and winged and holy creature, and can not make poetry until he is inspired and is out of his senses and his reason is no longer in him; and until this comes to pass, no man can make poems or give forth oracles. For it is not by art that they make their many beautiful poems and speeches about things, . . . but by a divine dispensation each man can make a beautiful poem only about the single matter to which the Muse inspires him; . . . about all else he is incapable. . . . And this is the reason why the god chooses their minds and uses as his servants the deliverers of oracles and the divine soothsayers, that we who hear them may know that it is not they who speak who are of much account, since they have no reason, but that it is the god himself who speaks and addresses us through them." 3 This explanation is enthusiastically accepted by Ion. Socrates pro- ceeds, however, to show that in all the special fields of action treated by the poet, the specialist is better informed than the poet and than the rhapsode who derives his inspiration from the poet.4 Ion must therefore admit either that he is a deceiver or that his pretensions are founded on inspiration; he prefers to be regarded as inspired. I have quoted extensive passages of this dialogue because they ex- hibit the traditional view of poetic inspiration 5 which Plato was com- ing to weigh. Some suppose that Plato is here seriously upholding this view; others contend that the dialogue was written expressly to ridicule it and to discard it. Neither interpretation, I think, is right. Plato here is weighing the common Greek notion that attributes the inspiration of the poet to an external influence. Just as the Greeks tended to find a myth in order to account for whatever they happened 1 Ion, 530-533 c. 2 Ibid., 533d. 3 Ibid., 533 e-534 b. * Ibid., 536 e-541 e. 6 As expressed, for example, by Democritus; cf. p. 9.</page><page sequence="17">Plato's View of Poetry 17 to believe, and to find ancestors for everything,' in the same way, recognizing that poetry is obviously a different thing from a man's ordinary expression, they assumed that some one else must have sug- gested it to him - a Muse or a god. So the poet was not his normal self; he was bO0eos, or the victim of i5Kcraal. Plato does not in the Ion discard this notion. He does, indeed, indicate the futility of ap- peals to inspiration for special knowledge in the ordinary affairs of life, in medicine and in chariot-driving, for example. Like the Socrates whom Xenophon knew, he distinguishes between things that are a matter of learning and left to human understanding and things that are not a matter of r4xvPt. That is a distinction that Plato himself almost always preserved,2 though he enormously increased the province of human understanding. And the irony that undoubtedly exists in the Ion is not that Socrates is supposed to deny the bewildered Ion all knowledge, but that Ion does not realize the meaning of knowledge. Plato at all periods of his life attributes inspiration to the poets in utter seriousness,3 as giving forth wisdom in a way that can not be reduced to a -rxv77. What kind of wisdom this is, Plato had yet to consider. We must remember that at the time this dialogue was written, although the germ of the doctrine of ideas may well have been in Plato's mind, the doctrine itself had not yet been broached; the in- spiration of the poet is therefore contrasted not with the knowledge afforded by science or by dialectic but with the purely practical kind of knowledge required in ordinary life-- in other words, with the ideal of knowledge that Socrates had sought, typified by the arts. If we had to recast the conclusion of the Ion in modern language, it would be something like this: The poet's work is not produced in the same rational way that other things are produced; it is the result of his having a peculiar power, greater at some times than at others, of giving utterance to thoughts that are in some way more precious than those of ordinary life. Naturally Plato does not imply that all who pretend to be poets are thus inspired, even though otherwise bad poets may have occasional flashes of inspiration. And the irony of the dialogue lies in the fact that the fatuous assumption of the rhapsode 1 Cf. Benn, The Greek Philosophers2, pp. 47-52. 2 Not in every case, however; see pp. 52 f. 3 Cf. Phaedrus, 245 a; Laws, 682 a.</page><page sequence="18">i8 William Chase Greene that he, too, shares in the inspiration of Homer, is apparently accepted by Socrates. In the Meno we begin to see the emergence of a new standard of truth. " Can virtue be taught ? " is the question. Only that can be taught, the argument proceeds, which can be known. Yet it appears that a man can not seek either for that which he knows or for that of which he is ignorant.' As a solution of this dilemma, Socrates proposes the previous existence of the soul, which he accepts from the priests and from Pindar and many other poets. " The soul, then, being im- mortal and having many times come to birth, and having beheld the things of a former life and of Hades and all matters, there is nothing which it has not learned; so it is not strange that it can recollect what it knew before about virtue and about other matters. . . . For in truth investigation and learning are altogether the same as recollec- tion." 2 This doctrine is confirmed by the geometrical reasoning of an untrained boy, who is described as recalling opinions that he previously held.3 Human affairs, however, are conducted not by science, but by right opinion, which must be distinguished from science because it can not, like science, deduce things rationally from a cause.' Hence erLrLaTi7. is more valuable than b6pOi 56oa,5 though in practice 6pO) 6rba is as effective as EntLaTr?1u .6 So the statesmen, who act through '6p0 564a and not through eTrLaTr77 , are, like the XprjqEroL and avIrets and ol 7roL)TyrLKOL irarTes, divinely inspired.' In the Meno two points should especially be noted. In the first place, Plato is hinting at a standard of truth that shall be nothing less than absolute. The soul in its previous existence knew everything,8 and can recover this knowledge by degrees. That is different from the knowledge of practical arts with which the inspiration of the poet and of the rhapsode was contrasted in the Ion; for it discovers necessary relationships among things, and it does not depend on inspiration. Of the methods of &amp;vuvneals, Plato does not here say more than that the opinions which a man has always held are aroused by questions; 9 the method was later to be developed further in the Pkaedo. We must note moreover that inspiration, which in the Ion was contrasted with 1 Meno, 80 e. 2 Ibid., 81 cd. 3 Ibid., 85 c. * Ibid., 98 a. 6 Ibid. 6 Ibid., 98 bc. 7 Meno, 99 cd. 8 Ibid., 81 c. 9 vpavep craL, Ibid., 85 d.</page><page sequence="19">Plato's View of Poetry i9 the knowledge of the practical arts, is here placed in the same category with it. The reason, however, is patent; the inspired ~roLTr&amp;xo ~ ravre together with the statesmen, are unable to refer their opinions to a cause, and can not therefore be credited with science in the strict sense. But their opinions may be as valuable for practical purposes as if they were causally connected. So 6po0) 56ba may imply a real possession of truth, and is inferior to nrLaTriI only because it can not explain the truth. It is not Plato's intention, of course, in this place to laud the practical value of inspiration, which is in theory only a makeshift; on the other hand, it becomes a makeshift only when the theoretically possible grasp of truth by means of Avaijymts is assumed to be not an ideal but an actuality. We shall see that a similar valuation of 664a occurs in later dialogues. The Symposium is so full of imagery and of poetry that it is a hard and not altogether a gracious task to seek in it a definite formulation of philosophic doctrine. Yet the dialogue, in spite of its exceedingly complex form, throws a new light on our problem. At the home of Agathon, the tragic poet, the guests engage in a series of encomia on love. Although Socrates does not altogether omit, in his own contri- bution to the discussion, the ideas of his other predecessors, it is par- ticularly the speech of the poet Agathon that is taken up and developed by him. For Agathon in his eulogy of Love has asserted that Love is a poet and the source of poetry in others.1 " Since the birth of Love, and from the Love of the beautiful, has sprung every good in heaven and earth."2 Using this rhetorical panegyric, which was "half playful, yet having a certain measure of seriousness," as a sort of text, Socrates proceeds to contribute his share to the discussion. Only he will not, like the others, say only what is good of Love, whether true or false; he will say only what is true. From his predecessors, then, Socrates accepts the conception of Love as a force that permeates all nature; he agrees with Agathon that Love is of the beautiful, and emphasizes, in a bit of dialectic, the point that it is of a beauty not in possession of the lover. And since the good is also beautiful, Love in wanting the beautiful wants also the good.3 The discourse of Diotima, which Socrates recounts, may be regarded as giving the views of Plato himself, who wishes to represent Socrates 1 Symp. 196 de. 2 Ibid., I97 b. 3 Ibid., 201.</page><page sequence="20">20 William Chase Greene as too tactful to give utterance on his own authority to views that in a way contradict those of his host. He is also a learner. And what does he learn ? Diotima explains to him, in allegory, the paradox of the position of Love between possession and non-possession. In the Meno, we saw, a similar paradox was solved by an appeal to the doc- trine of dv&amp;upvtas; the soul recovers what it formerly had.' Here the solution is in mythical form; as the child of Plenty and Poverty, Love is neither fair nor foul, and is between divine and mortal, as he is be- tween ignorance and knowledge.2 Love then, aims at the beautiful, or rather at the everlasting possession of the beautiful and the good.3 Further, in accordance with its nature, Love desires to procreate, and to bring forth offspring, since only in this way can mortals achieve a sort of immortality. For in a world where all is change, both in body and in soul, it is only reproduction on the one hand and recollection on the other hand that conserve identity; hence the desire for immor- tality of either kind.' Diotima describes the creations of the soul: "wisdom and the other forms of virtue, of which all the poets and those who are called creative are the begetters." I And the fairest part of wisdom is that which is concerned with the ordering of states and families. Whoever has the seed of these qualities planted in him in his youth, in maturity seeks the beautiful so that he may beget off- spring. His children are fairer than mortal children; and so it is that Homer and Hesiod, that Lycurgus and Solon have achieved im- mortality." At this point, though there is not an actual break in the thought, Diotima indicates by her language that we are passing to a new stage in the argument. She adopts the language of the mysteries, and tells Socrates that the mysteries so far described are within his grasp, but that the complete initiation and the sight of the mystic revelation to which they lead are perhaps beyond him. When we remember the ironic assumption by Socrates of the r6le of pupil in this part of the dialogue, we are justified in regarding what follows as exactly the new doctrine that Plato is interested in putting forth, and which he wishes expressly to distinguish from what has gone before and to mark as something not easily to be grasped by the average man. In what has gone before, 1 Meno, 80 c ff. 2 Symp. 204 b. 3 Ibid., 206 a. 4 Ibid. 207 c ff. SIbid., 209 a. 6 Ibid., 209og a-e.</page><page sequence="21">Plato's View of Poetry 21 the aspiration for permanence in a life of change has resulted, through the loving embrace of beauty, in the begetting of wisdom and virtue. Of these the types are the productions of the poet and of the legislator. In what follows, we have a glowing forecast of the stages by which the lover should I proceed. In other words, a programme is being an- nounced. The lover should begin with the love of a single beautiful body, and should thus beget beautiful thoughts; then, perceiving that the beauty in any body is akin to that in other bodies, and that their beauty is one, he should be a lover of all beautiful bodies. Next, he should realize the superiority of the beauty that resides in souls, and should proceed to the contemplation of the beauty that is to be found in practices and in laws, and hence to think little of bodily beauty. He will then approach the sciences and contemplate their beauty, till drawing near to the vast sea of beauty he gazes upon it and begets a host of fair thoughts in his love of wisdom, and at last he beholds a single science, namely, that of beauty. The scholar in love who has reached this point then suddenly catches sight of a wondrous beauty, the goal of all his toils, a beauty that is eternal, absolute, and unchang- ing. It can not be represented to sense 2 or stated in terms of intellect.3 It is absolute, and the source of the changing beauties of other things. This is the goal toward which tends the right love of beautiful things, rising as by the steps of a ladder from the love of particular beauties, through fair practices and fair sciences to the science of beauty itself, which ends in the knowledge of the essence of beauty.4 This life, lived in the contemplation of real beauty, is the noblest ideal that a man could have; and the lover, always desirous of procreation, would at this stage have come into contact with truth, and so would beget not mere images of virtue, but true virtue. In the Symposium, Plato develops further the notion at which he merely hints in the Meno - the ideal of a knowledge that is absolute. But whereas in the Meno the method was one of simple remembering, in the Symposium Plato, influenced no doubt by the image of the 1 Symp. 21o a: MYv Lrs 6pnS puert'.; ibid., 21o a: Trv bp&amp;2is !6&amp;ra rl roivro 7 rpaypcL. 2 Ibid., 21I a: ob 6' af 6crprTaOEcra&amp; ab6r^3r r IcaXMy oior Tp6awwpr6 e o. xeapes oi68 A oXX obA Oh (iVa^t Iat xeL. 3 Ibid., o Wk 7Ls X6yos os W &amp;k s rLr74or7. 4 Ibid., 211 c.</page><page sequence="22">22 William Chase Greene lover's separation from the beloved, proposes knowledge of the abso- lute as the goal of love of the beautiful. From this point of view, the discourse must be regarded as the sketch of the end toward which the aesthetic experience logically tends. Particular beautiful things impel us to go beyond the world of sense into the world of thought where beauty itself is contemplated. But inasmuch as this ultimate beauty is neither corporeal nor even capable of representation in terms of intel- lect, it may be distinguished from the absolute that is finally envisaged by the philosopher who goes through the various steps of dialectic described in the Phaedo and the Republic. In this case, Plato seems to have been carried away by the enthusiasm of his imagination, in his attempt to assume a goal for the activity which deals with beauty. In later discussions of the dialectic process Plato does not indeed try to describe his absolute, but he makes it clear that he is dealing with a postulate of reason. In a certain sense, therefore, Love may be said to philosophize; 1 but in order to accomplish this end, Love is forced to give up its contact with the things of sense and to seek real beauty by the exercise of the intellect. What he finds is something that would ordinarily hardly be described as beauty at all. The later stages of the lover's ascent are described much as are those of the b&amp;aXeKrcK6o, who proceeds from the perception of particular objects to universal quali- ties and finally to an absolute. Is the account in the Symposium, then, simply an account of dialectic ? The answer must be, I think, that it includes dialectic and something more. The lover of beauty aspires not only to know the truth but to embrace it ardently and to beget true virtue. His path, like that of the &amp;aLXEKr1KbS, leads to the sum- mit of the same mountain; 2 the mountain to him, however, is known as beautiful, to the &amp;LakeKTrK6s it is known as good. That does not mean that we have in the Symposium merely a dialectic tinged with emotion, such as we undoubtedly find in the Republic. We have rather the purifying of emotion by the intellect. And this conception was the more easily entertained by Plato by reason of the Greek tradition that extended the meaning of KaX6v to conduct; it seems to be Plato above all, however, who extended the meaning of the word still farther to include the region of the intellect. Is it then fair to sup- 1 Symp. 203 d: tXoao4,av; ibid., 2zo d: v OLXoroo~i 4&amp;,eb6c. 2 Symp. 2 11 C: oarep rava#aa/ots; Rep. 5z11 ab: oto, brLkleaets re ,calb 6p/Aas.</page><page sequence="23">Plato's View of Poetry 23 pose that any other concept would have served Plato's purpose as well as that of beauty ? I Could he have begun as easily with justice or equality ? From a logical point of view, no doubt he could, as in fact, in the Phaedo, he did. Where Plato seems to make a distinction is in the greater impetus that the love of beauty gives to the lover. Though the perception of similar qualities in any kind of sensibilia may arouse a reminiscence of universals,2 we are told in the Phaedrus, as we shall see,3 that it is especially the sense of beauty which instigates this reminiscence. It is in fact hardly too much to say that it is the love of beauty that first gives Plato the incentive to rise from the world of sense to the world of pure thought, and that he makes the method which is outlined in the Symposium his general type of philo- sophic investigation. It is possibly going too far to find with Lfv~que in the preceding growth of Greek art the seeds of the doctrine of ideas.4 Yet it is true that whenever Plato has occasion to mention a quality and regard it as an delos, rb KaXov is usually the first or one of the first that comes into his mind; in the later dialogues, rb &amp;'yaObv more fre- quently comes first.5 Further we note that in the Symposium the only concept that is mentioned is the single one of beauty. Now it would of course be absurd to imagine that Plato ever thought he could solve all metaphysical problems by the use of this one concept." Clearly Plato deals in the Symposium with the concept that fits his immediate subject; the significant thing is that his consideration of it leads him to sketch for the first time an ideal something like the science of dialectic. 1 Cf.

In the first place, we have a statement of the actual results of the love of beauty, and of the productions of the soul that come to birth thereby; the typical examples of these are the works of the poets and the other creative artists, and of legislators. As in the Meno, there is no depreciation of the works of poets, except, of course, as they necessarily rank lower than the productions of the ideal activity that is to follow. Secondly, we have a statement of the end toward which the love of the beautiful ought to lead if carried to its logical extreme. This end is described as no more than a desirable, though never attained, ideal; I and it takes us from the perception of particu- lar beautiful objects to the pure concept of beauty. It is really the denial of the principle on which modern languages describe the love of the beautiful by expressions derived from the word alaefrtzs. It ends, we notice, with the statement that he who is in contact with reality will bring forth true virtue. That means that truth can be begotten by the ecstatic vision of the lover of beauty. The truth so begotten, of course, would be of a purely intellectual nature. III Even more than the Symposium, the Phaedo affirms a distinction between body and soul, between sense and thought. In the acquisition of wisdom the body is an obstacle; the sight and the hearing can not give truth, still less the other senses.2 Even the soul is hampered in its search by the body, and can grasp the truth only as it succeeds in getting rid of this disability. Of such a process, the life of the philoso- pher is the supreme example.3 He alone has learned the necessity of purification from bodily impediments that must precede all knowledge, and regards the attainment of the several virtues as an initiatory pur- 1 That this passage describes an experience whose realization can be only ap- proximated appears from the language: Symp. 21o a: ~&amp;P s p0ws pS perly . . . r 6p0oos 16vra Cri oUTo 7b rp'rpa . . . &amp;a. v 6pO8s 7rjytraL b ~'robfpeos; ibid., 21o e: 0&amp;- Evos /4ei~s re Kal o6pOOs Td KaX&amp;; ibid., 211 b: &amp;iaw 64 " L Ilrb rvoe bd&amp;&amp; r6 b0is vratSepaareiTv kArcal V kelVO Td KacbX &amp;PX7r1c KaOOpiav, '7Xe5-v TPv 7r T Lt ro TO "TrXOvs; ibid., 211 d: bIra0a . . etrep roo AXXoM0; ibid., 211 d: 8 MPv wore ZSs; ibid., 211 d: ri ~ra . ..

But Plato makes reservations., In the proof of the immortality of the soul, as in the defiihition of virtue in the Meno, Plato has recourse to the doctrine of recollection. Knowl- edge of the abstract ideas may arise by a process of association." For example, the lover may be reminded of his beloved by a lyre or by a garment; to see Simmias may remind one of Cebes; to see a painted horse or lyre may remind one of a man; a picture of Simmias puts one in mind of Cebes or of Simmias himself.4 This reminiscence arises partly from the perception of similarity, partly from the perception of dissimilarity.' Moreover, in addition to the recognition of similarity, we notice whether one thing falls short of another with regard to simi- larity. Now there is such a thing as abstract equality, not one of a number of particulars. Yet we are put in mind of it by our perception of particulars. On this point Socrates is explicit; it is the senses through which we attain to our rediscovery of the universals.6 What is modre to our purpose, T7 KaXbv is described as being in ex- actly the same relation as the other qualities that have been discussed.7 The demonstration of the immortality of the soul, moreover, rests on the affirmation of these qualities as having a real existence prior to the particular things which we refer to them; and this affirmation is de- scribed as familiar.8 In fact, nothing is to Socrates so clear as the ex- istence of these things.9 Unlike the particulars, they are immut~ble and invisible, and can be apprehended only by a process of thought.10 Accordingly, the universe is divided into two types of existence: the visible and the invisible, of which the former is ever-changing, the 1 Phaedo, 65 c-69 c. 2 Ibid., 69 c. 8 Ibid., 73 c. 4 Ibid., 73 de. , Ibid., 74 a. * Ibid., 75 ab: 765E buLoXoyoVo.Ie, JJ I &amp;XXoOe abrbT [i. e. 7b Taro] Z eporP17paL jp75v 5wvTarpb* doat bPo)aju K A&amp;XXa ' V L oK V 1BeY j &amp;OaarOa 4 ZIjS TWOS AXX7Sr 7TCv ala0;arewp.

This circumstance is given as the reason for an ascetic life; the senses are to be distrusted,' and one should guard against being deceived by the emotions, and especially by the emotions that are excited by the sense of sight, into accepting for true what is really not true; in this condition, above all, the soul is shackled by the body.2 Again, in order to investigate the nature of causality, Socrates has recourse to a second resort,3 that is, to thought,4 making use of hy- potheses.5 This process brings him back to what he describes as a familiar and often discussed hypothesis, namely, the real existence of certain concepts." Further, how the relation of beautiful things to beauty itself is to be expressed, he is not quite sure; he is sure, how- ever, of the fact that they are beautiful by reason of beauty.7 In the Phaedo, then, as in the Symposium, we find a sharp division between the world of sense and the world of thought. Sure knowl- edge can be only of the world of thought; it follows, therefore, that in order to attain sure knowledge one should get rid of the dependence on the evidence of the senses as far as possible. Whereas, however, the transition from the senses to thought is in the Symposium effected by the discovery of beauty first in sensible forms, then in intellectual forms, in the Phaedo it is effected by the discovery of an intelligible principle beyond particulars 8 or inherent in them,9 which is to be ac- cepted as an hypothesis as certain as anything that is known.'0 We note further that however anxious Plato is to get rid of the dependence on the senses" and the emotions,2 the senses are indispensable as a means of acquiring knowledge of ideas. Of themselves, they can give no truth; yet without them we can not recapture the eternally existing realities that we once knew. Now the doctrine of recollection is only a poetic way of throwing into quasi-historical form a logical principle. 1 Phaedo, 83 a. 2 Ibid., 83 cd. 3 Ibid., 99 c: 6bebrpov irXogv.

The logical truth that is contained in this explanation, however, is not dependent on the explanation; it amounts to what modern philos- ophers would call the a priori 3 possession of forms of thought and perception. Indeed, one is tempted to compare the doctrine of wAvq&amp;iaYns with the doctrine of Kant, in which the universals are forms of cogni- tion, and are not valid except in relation to perception. But Plato would never have admitted that the universals are dependent for their validity on perception; all that he will grant to the senses is that for us they are the means by which we first obtain our acquaintance with universals. In the Symposium, the only universal discussed, as we saw, was that of beauty. In his discussion of the love of beauty, he found that love of beautiful sensible objects leads to love of beauty itself. In the Phaedo, the perception not only of beautiful objects but of other objects may lead to the knowledge of their respective universals. Naturally we find that these universals are now not the end of desire, as was appropriate in the Symposium, but objects of knowledge. That is because we have here the logical statement, in a general form, of the principle that leads us from sense to thought. We note, however, that just as in the Symposium Plato foreshadowed a science of beauty which was to crown all lower forms of experience, in the Phaedo again we have the presage of a science 4 which is to deal with the hypothesis of forms, which are to be examined so as to secure the greatest degree of certainty of which man is capable.5 Each universal is the cause of the particulars to which it is related; and in general, everything is dis- posed in the way that is best for it.6 Since in the Phaedo Plato does not discuss directly the matter of poetry proper,7 we can only reconstruct from it the views that he I Cf. pp. 8 f.; I6 ff. 2 Meno, 85 c.

I have already</page><page sequence="28">28 William Chase Greene would probably have expressed, and then note in succeeding dialogues how far these views are confirmed. Knowledge of the truth must mean knowledge of universals; to concern oneself only with the world of sense is to shut oneself off from the only region where truth can be found. Therefore the poet who attempts to convey truth simply by the use of sensible images is lending himself to deception. In order to make sure that his poems give some sort of knowledge of truth, he must choose his images in such a way that the reader or hearer shall be reminded by the particulars of the universals. Further, Plato would deprecate any attempt by the poet to appeal so strongly to the emotions that the mind would think only of the sensible images, and forget to pass beyond them to the realities that can be apprehended only by the mind. So much, and perhaps not more than so much, Plato might have said. There is no suggestion yet that poetry as a whole is to be distrusted.' IV In the previous dialogues we have seen Plato gradually approaching the problem of the nature of truth. In each case he has chosen a single aspect of the problem, because of a special interest. In the Republic we find his most extended and his most serious attempts to formulate an answer to the problem; we find in it also several discussions about the value of poetry in its relation to philosophy. indicated (p. 14) my belief that there is no reason to suppose this passage not to be Socratic. If the passage, however, is Platonic, it supports the view here defended, since Socrates is represented as trying to express in the form of a myth, dealing with sensible material, a universal idea. Moreover, ovIcLK in the popular sense is portrayed as a form of otXowoola, the highest /ovwLKi. 1 Lutoslawski suggests, The Origin and Growth of Plato's Logic (p. 264), that in the Phaedo Plato treats the poets with less respect than in the Symposium. He says that they are quoted " with a certain irony " (65 b) or with a " certain air of superi- ority and contempt " (70 c). But OpvXoVTLv (65 b), the word which Plato here uses of the poets, is exactly the word which he himself uses of the precious doctrine of ideas (76 d). Cf. Plotinus io. 6 (I, ioi, ed. Kirchhoff); OpvXXof4evop surely means merely "frequently discussed." Again, the mention of the comic poets (KOcY05o7roL6s 70c) is a good dramatic touch; it was the comic poets who had just been among the indirect accusers of Socrates, and they had made the very charge that they are here said to make (cf. Apology, i8 d; 19 c). But it is impossible to deduce from these references a notion of Plato's attitude. Can we argue a respect for Homer from the use of quotations (94 d-95 a) ?</page><page sequence="29">Plato's View of Poetry 29 We have already seen' that the claim of Homer to be regarded by the Greeks as their chief educator had been disputed on moral grounds by several early philosophers. Further, a writer of great learning and insight has told us: 2 " The underlying presumption of the whole of Plato's attack upon Greek poetry is that poetry was the universally recognized teacher of Greece. The head and front of his indictment is not that poetry does not teach, but that her doctrines - so Plato at least believed - are too often demoralizing and degrading." These words sum up very aptly a part of Plato's criticism; they err, as I think it will appear, in pretending to explain " the whole of Plato's attack." They describe well and truly the criticism of the second and third books of the Republic; the criticism is there based on ethical grounds. They do not account for the criticism of the tenth book, which is based, as it is easy to show, on another view of the nature of truth and of knowledge. Similarly, Stiihlin argues 3 that the banish- ment of Homer is apparently founded on the impossibility of finding knowledge in him, but that in reality the reason is his imitation of the immoral, and that the result of the discussion in the tenth book is es- sentially the same as that in the third book. Again, it will not be hard to show that there is a real difference in the point of view of the two discussions, and that the difference rests on the metaphysical discus- sion that has intervened. The first half of the Republic deals with the founding of a city not essentially different from the best Greek states.4 This fact ap- pears in the ordering of many of the social institutions on Spartan models.5 Indeed many of the regulations that deal with poetry in the second and third books of the Republic are like those of Sparta, which kept ancient traditions about music and poetry, permitting only hymns to the gods. Accordingly, the criticism of poetry in the early books of the Republic is based partly on the difference between the morality of Homer and that of his own day, partly on his observation of the psy- 1 P.

Jowett, transl. Plato, iii, pp. clxx ff.</page><page sequence="30">30 William Chase Greene chological effect of contemporary drama. It will suffice to illustrate briefly each of these points. Plato begins his account of the education of the guardians of his state by suggesting the traditional training.' This training includes the tell- ing of stories,2 which may be either true or false. Since these are used at any early age, when children are impressionable, it is important to choose only good fictions. But of the old story tellers of Greece even the greatest, Homer and Hesiod, not only tell lies but tell them badly, in that their stories do not give true pictures of the gods. They de- scribe the gods as committing all sorts of immoral acts of which chil- dren ought not to hear. And children are incapable of understanding allegorical interpretations of these stories. At this time Socrates and Adeimantus are not poets, but founders of a state; so they can not say just what poems shall be written, but can merely indicate what forms 3 will be accepted. In the first place, God is always to be represented as he is; that is, as good and as the cause only of good. In the second place, God never changes. Stories of Homer to the contrary are to be condemned. God has no need of any kind of lie; though there is room for an innocent sort of lie, in which the liar is not himself deceived. This serves its purpose in mythology, where we make falsehood as much like truth as we can, since we know little about ancient times.4 It is justified because it gives a notion of truth even before children are capable of understanding the truth by the use of their reasons; 5 but the use of lies is permitted only to rulers.6 There is another reason for censuring Homer; his poems tend to make men fear death and the lower world. No less reprehensible are the lamentations of heroes and above all the lamentations and the laughter of the gods. Plato shrinks from accusing Homer of impiety in telling immoral stories about Achilles; I yet all stories that impute evil-doing to the gods and that make heroes no better than men are to be done away with, lest they make the young lax in morals.8 Finally, the poets are not to be allowed to represent wicked men as prospering and just men as wretched.9 1 Rep. 376 e. 2 Ibid., 376 e: 0byovs; 377 a: ,bovs. 3 Ibid., 379 a: Trbrovs, 4 Ibid., 382 d: dro oro0vrsO 7L &amp;AiOeXb 2~E60 sL r.

All his criticism of Homer to this point is based on ethical grounds; it is, in- deed, a more complete and illustrated version of the criticisms which Xenophanes and Heracleitus had made.2 It would be true to say that it exemplifies the ancient quarrel between poetry and philosophy, if we limit philosophy in this instance to moral philosophy. But there has not yet been any hint of a criticism of poetry as such; stories and poems even though fictions, are retained, provided that they are purged of immoral elements. Plato next discusses the forms of poetry.3 He divides poetry into kinds, according to the extent to which imitation is employed. Thus tragedy and comedy are altogether imitations of action and of speech; dithyrambic is devoid of imitation; epic is in part imitative. The question propounded is whether poets are to be admitted as imitators in general, or whether they shall be allowed to imitate only certain things, and, in that case, what they may imitate, or, finally, whether they shall be debarred altogether from imitation.4 This may mean only a question whether tragedy and comedy are to be admitted, or the argument may lead us further.5 As it turns out, the argument in this passage is concerned with the effect of imitative poetry on the minds and characters of the public. Plato begins by asking whether the guardians ought to be imitators; this question, however, he finds, has been settled by the rule already laid down that one man can do only one thing well. If a man is to play a serious part in life, he can not at the same time imitate other parts also. Even when two kinds of imi- tation seem to be close to each other, the same persons cannot succeed in both; they can not write comedy and tragedy equally well.6 The I Rep. 392 d. 2 Cf. p. Io. * Rep. 392 d. " Ibid., 394 d. 5 This is not a reference to the discussion of epic in the tenth book, as Jowett and Campbell wrongly hold. (Cf. Adam on 294 d; 595 a.) Here the reference is clearly to the question that immediately follows: shall the guardians be imitators at all (394 e)? Note the word rolivy, 394 e i; this word introduces the b6-yos just mentioned, 394 d 8. 6 But in Symp. 223 d Socrates tries to make Agathon and Aristophanes admit that the same man ought to be able to write both tragedy and comedy. We notice that the two poets do not quite follow the argument (ob acr6pa bropvovs); as a matter of history, the Greek comic writers did not write tragedy, nor did the Greek tragedians write comedy (in the strict sense). That, perhaps Socrates meant to argue, was because their notions were derived from the world of sense about them,</page><page sequence="32">32 William Chase Greene reason for this lies in human nature; 1 we can not do more than one thing well. And the art which the guardians have adopted is the ex- clusive art of making freedom for the city; therefore " if they imitate at all, they should imitate only those characters which are suitable to their profession - the courageous, temperate, holy, free, and the like," since " imitations begun in youth and continued into later life grow into habits and are established in the body and voice and mind." The guardians accordingly must not imitate women, or base men, or animals, or natural phenomena; they will, in fact, prefer to imitate the sayings and actions of good men, and will shun those of inferior men. The worse a man is, the more he will be inclined to imitate any and every sort of thing - even all the sounds and voices that are to be heard in the decadent theatre. Plato will admit only the pure imitator of virtue.2 He grants that the mixed style is pleasant, but it is unsuitable for his state, in which men are not double or manifold, but play only one part.3 The man who imitates everything in his poems is, there- fore, to be treated with all courtesy, but is to be sent out of the city; only the austere and severe poet is to be employed who imitates only the style of the virtuous and submits to the forms that the legislators have prescribed. In this passage, Plato has announced that he is going to discuss mat- ters of literary form or style. And he begins, to be sure, with an analy- sis of literature from the point of view of form. In this analysis he makes use of the obvious fact that poetry, like other kinds of art, is imitative; that is, it represents persons and things. In this sense, Plato is making no innovation. Socrates had expressed only the obvi- ous and accepted notion when he said that sculpture is an imitation of visible objects; 4 and it is in this obvious sense that Aristotle declares that epic poetry, and tragedy, and comedy, and dithyrambic, and most flute and lyre playing are, generally, imitations.5 To Socrates, how- not from the contemplation of such pure beauty as Diotima had described to him. And such a contemplation would include the understanding of opposites (cf. Laws, 816 d). But this sort of argument is not in Plato's mind here; he is thinking here not of the understanding that creates drama, but of the character that drama pro- duces, a character that must be one and not many. 1 Rep. 395 b: ? )To) &amp;vOpc(0'irov bats. 2 Ibid., 397 d: rb 70To t)btetKoVs l1tpr, i kp(KLaroV. a Cf. also 387 b. 4 Xen.

In the present passage, Plato divides literature according to the extent to which direct imitation enters into the various forms; tragedy has a larger amount of direct imitation than epic. At first, then, it seems as if Plato is going to base his decision about the admission of poetry strictly on the question of literary form. That, indeed, is the conclusion to which Adeimantus leaps.2 But that is just what Socrates will not say; all that he will lay down at this point is that the question must be determined as the argu- ment leads.3 Now the argument that follows, we must note particu- larly, is based not on the distinction of literary form, but on the effect produced by poetry on its hearers. The question that immediately follows is whether the guardians ought to be imitators, and, if so, what they ought to imitate. Plato almost seems to suggest that his guardi- ans are actually to become actors on the stage; but that he expressly denies.4 Yet he proceeds at once to suggest that if they are to imitate at all, they shall imitate only characters that are becoming to their profession. It is clear that his meaning is not that they are to become actors, but that they shall by force of imagination and sympathy enter into the spirit of poetic imitations; they shall imitate, not on the stage, but with their minds and emotions, and as result, in their character.5 In this sense, the spectator of a play is as much an imitator as the poet or the actor. Now it can not be doubted that Plato is thinking in the present passage especially of the sort of plays that were being exhibited 1 Aristotle, of course, changed the meaning, too, but in a different way. It will be seen that in this study I make a very sparing use of Aristotle. That is partly because the relation of Aristotle's theory of art to Plato's has been well discussed (C. Belger, De Aristotele etiam in Arte Poetica Componenda Platonis Discipulo, Berlin, 1872; G. Finsler, Platon und die Aristotelische Poetik, Leipzig, igoo), partly because although, as all writers agree, the germs of most of Aristotle's ideas about art are to be found in Plato, Aristotle's purposes and views are so different that his writings are in this matter a misleading guide to the meaning of Plato. 2 Rep. 394 d: avreboua L ... aKolrqtaai Oe ehe 7rapcabe6jOa rpay yita rt oaul Kw/B5lav Eir lsr)v ir6Xv, eTere Kal o. 3 Ibid., 374 d: 6rVi &amp;v6 6, o tyo rrep rvpEtAa 4 pP, 67abrv T174010.

And the purpose of this drama, as Plato had already pointed out, was not to be of profit to the spectators, but to give them mere pleasure of a low sort, and to flatter the mob.1 This appeal was all the more dangerous if the poet happened to be a man of talent.2 Yet Plato does not here attempt to decide on a basis of literary form what kinds of poetry are to be admitted. What he does lay down as a principle is that poets must not be allowed to pre- sent realistically all sorts of persons and situations; only those things are to be imitated which would serve as examples for imitation by the citizens. In this passage, several points should be especially noted. In the first place, although we are led to suppose that the argument is to be one of literary form, it turns out that the argument is really concerned with ethical questions. That is because Plato begins by defining the types of literature according to their use of imitation, but then asks, not which is the best type, but quite a different question. He asks what sort of human nature ought to be imitated. The conclusion is, the sort of human nature that we ought in actual practice to imitate is the sort that poets ought by their art to imitate. The answer, then, is ethical. In the second place, we note that Plato does not here raise at all the question whether it is possible for poetic imitation to give any grasp of truth. Here it is assumed that imitation may, so far as it goes, give a true picture of its object. In a word, the metaphysical criticism of imitation has not come into the argument. We note further what is implied in the view of imitation that is here advanced. Plato seems to hold that poetic imitation may to a certain extent deal with universals. He has blamed Homer for not representing the gods as they are; 3 that implies at least that a true representation of them is not impossible. Again, he says that there is a sort of style in which a good man would speak,4 and he admits the poet who imitates the 1 Gorgias, 502 b-d. 2 Cf.

In theory, at least, then, there is a form or type of activity and of speech which not only can be imitated but which should be imitated.2 Finally, we note in passing that Plato hints that even comedy is not to be ruled out of the state, provided that it is pro- duced in a proper spirit of pleasantry.3 The next passage concerns us, because although it is not about poetry it is about other forms of art, the discussion of which is expressly based on the same principles.4 Just as subject matter and style were subjected to a censorship, to make sure that they tended to produce certain kinds of character, melody and harmony and rhythm are to receive a similar purgation. Plato implies that in some way it is pos- sible to imitate character by these musical modes, and that character may therefore be influenced by them.5 And in words that are full of feeling and of poetry he describes what may be the influence on the young of an environment of beautiful sculpture and architecture and other works of creative art; if the artists are naturally endowed with the power to track out the essential nature of the beautiful and the graceful," the young receive the good in everything, and through eyes and ears an effluence of every beautiful thing, like a breeze from a healthful region, reaches them, and they are insensibly brought into harmony with the beauty of reason.7 Music above all sinks into the inward places of the soul, and breeds in one an appreciation of the beautiful and the good, so that when, later, reason comes to one, it is greeted as no stranger. But education will not be complete till the guardians have learned to know the essential forms of temperance and courage and liberality and magnificence and their kin and their oppo- sites and can recognize them in every context wherever they are found, and also their images, not slighting them in small things or in great, but regarding them as all within the same art or study.8 Finally, the 1 Rep. 398 b: 6s ... . riv r70To '7OLer o X^Lv tlutoiAro. 2 Cf. also 4oi b: TroTs roL-)raTL iL . . .. . r&amp;TararylTr?OP Kal rpoavayKaarToV TrpV ro d&amp;yaOo3 elr6va 1Oov rAroev 7ois 7ror4carv 4 pv j 7rap' t'iTv nwotei.

So education ends in the love of beauty.' Since Plato explains that his attitude toward music is to be consistent with the statements that he makes about the other arts, we are justified in looking for light on the foregoing passages in the present passage. And the principle, as it appears, that governs Plato in the discussion of music is again an ethical principle. Again it is the man of single and fixed purpose whose character is in the first place to be the model which music should try to express and which in the second place it should try to produce --iustum et tenacem propositi virum. So far, Plato's criticism is negative; certain types of art are to be repressed. But he also sketches the positive benefits that art can give. Here once more the effect of art seems to be ethical, or rather the idea of beauty and of goodness are so mingled that it is impossible to distinguish them; for in both, it is implied, there is a rational element, so that the culmination of an early acquaintance with the beauty and goodness everywhere to be discerned is a similarity or friendship or harmony with the beauty of reason. Education is thus nothing less than the process that is instigated by the perception of ordered beauty in the world of sense, that sinks into the soul and breeds character, that then rises from love of sensible things to love of beautiful character in the soul, and that ends in the love of pure beauty. Of course this process reminds us not only in its general thought but even in its language of the discourse of Diotima.2 What is here especially interest- ing is that not only beauty, or even beauty in sensible form, is given the power of influencing the soul in a rational way, but works of art. One may find it curious that Plato's instances here are not drawn from poetry, which he has just limited, but from sculpture and architecture and other constructive arts 3 and music.4 Perhaps the reason is that Plato could not approve of contemporary poetry, or indeed fully of any poetry that had ever been written, whereas it would be hard for sculpture to change much without ceasing to be sculpture.' And so Plato " did not see in the sculptors and architects of his time the signs 1 Rep. 403 c: 6ei b i roT reXeurv i, vovaUOI *16 r&amp; T o XoG WPXr4v . 2 Symp. 20o e ff. 3 Rep. 401 b.

The first suggestion that occurs to one is that they are the ideas to which Plato's famous doctrine is related. If that is the case, we find it laid down here that the poet and the artist are to imitate directly the ideas. Such a conclusion is of course in opposition to the doctrine of the tenth book of the Republic. Is that any reason for supposing Plato not to have had this meaning here ? It depends, I think, on the extent to which the ideas are supposed by him in this passage to be separate. Though we have not had, to be sure, the discussion of the seventh book, in which the ideas are undeniably separate, in the Sym- posium and the Phaedo we have had the discussion of rb KaX6v, which is separate; and education here, we are told, ends in the love of r6 KaX6v. Adam,' admitting that if the language of this passage be in- terpreted in the light of Book VII it can bear the meaning that.I have suggested, argues that the doctrine of separate ideas does not appear elsewhere in books I-IV, and that the ideas here are spoken of as im- manent.7 He concludes therefore that we must suppose that the artist copies from the life. The use of ec6r7 is thus " a sort of half-way house between the Socratic X6-yoL and Plato's ideas." 8 But even if these elZ6b are not separate, we must ask what it means " to copy from the life."

It is the discovery in things everywhere of the essential natures of all elements that constitute or that contribute to beauty; and it is this concern for beauty that unites our interest in small things and in great. We have seen, then, that all the discussion of poetry in the second and third books of the Republic is based on ethical grounds. Imitation, is not, as such, criticized in an unfriendly spirit; on the contrary, the imitation of the good and of the beautiful that is to be discovered every- where, in bodies and in souls, is expressly encouraged.' Each art is to assist, in its own medium, in the ennobling of character. This is not a complete theory of poetry and of the other arts, but it is by no means a low or an unworthy theory. Moreover, Plato is not committed by the introduction of the theory of ideas to any adverse criticism of the arts, as such. Plato explains that the object of the training of his soldiers in uovacKi and in "ywvaarTLKl is to prepare them to take the dye of the laws so that their opinions 2 may sink indelibly into their natures. In this passage, there is no reason to suppose that Plato speaks of 36&amp;a in a tone of disparagement.3 In fact, for practical purposes, courage exists through the saving power of true opinion.4 But, as it will appear, Plato never confuses true opinion with knowledge. When Glaucon brings down upon Socrates the " third wave," it is in the form of a question whether the state that is being described could ever exist.5 To this Socrates replies that the very essence of an ideal is that it can not exist, and that this is no reproach against it. So one must not insist on his proving that any actual state will coincide with his ideal state; one must be content with an approximation. But he will go so far as to lay down the principle that actual states might be reformed so as to agree with the ideal state, provided only that phi- losophers were to become kings or kings were to become philosophers. The explanation of this principle requires Plato to ask what is the 1 Lutoslawski is simply wrong in saying (Origin and Growth of Plato's Logic, p. 286) "Plato now (i.e. in Rep. ii-iv) despises poetry as a mere iPtlauvs, and banishes Homer from his state."

As the lover loves all things that are lovable, the philosopher, if he is true to his name, is a lover of all knowledge. But this does not mean that the name of philosopher is deserved by all lovers of sights or by the frequenters of the theatre who run to hear every chorus; they are merely somewhat like the true philosophers, who love the vision of truth.4 The lovers of sights and sounds 5 are fond of beautiful tones and colors and figures and all that is made of them, but are incapable of seeing or loving absolute beauty.6 They are like dreamers who take the resemblance for the reality, unlike waking persons, who recognize the existence of absolute beauty, and who do not confuse it with the objects of sense that are beautiful. They only who know this have knowledge; the others have only opinion - though Plato does not grudge them any knowledge that they may have. In general, knowledge is of being, and ignorance is of non-being; opinion, which lies between knowledge and ignorance, is of that which is between being and non-being. Now the 4tXoOteacov, who does not believe that beauty is one, must admit that beautiful things are also base, and that all visible things are rela- tive, and do not deserve one name more than another. The notions of the multitude about these things therefore are tossing about between being and non-being; they must, then, be opinions, not knowledge. And those who see the many beautiful things that are visible to sense, and who yet neither see absolute beauty nor can follow any guide who points the way thither, have opinion, not knowledge; they are qAX6- 04oto, not 4LX60o4oL. Attempts have been made to show that Plato is here gracefully re- futing the views of Antisthenes, who is depicted as the kLXoOe&amp;.UWv.7 There is no doubt that rivalry existed between Plato and Antisthenes, or that their philosophies were opposed at every point.8 The interests 1 Rep. 474 b-48o. 2 Ibid., 484 a-502 a.

But his philosophy was the negation of the possibility of real knowledge; though he required concepts of things,4 he limited all predicates to proper names, so that only identical propositions were possible. For him, general conceptions are mere names. Thus he denied the real existence of genera in the famous remark, " I see a horse; but horseness I do not see." 5 It is not at all unlikely that Plato intended a glancing blow at this doctrine of Antisthenes; it is possible, too, that in 480 a Plato is replying to Isocrates,6 the man who, though claiming for his notion of culture the name " philosophy," preferred to limit himself to matters in which opinion is more valuable than knowledge.7 But what we must not fail to notice is that Plato's aim here is the definition of the philosopher. Accordingly, the philosopher, or lover of knowledge, is contrasted with the lover of opinion; and the distinction rests en- tirely on the doctrine of ideas. Now this doctrine is exactly the doc- trine that Antisthenes of all people would not admit.8 Further, we notice that in this place there is no attempt to demonstrate the theory of ideas. It is introduced, with hardly a word of explanation, as some- thing familiar, much as in the Phaedo. It is, as in the Phaedo, readily accepted. We must conclude, then, that the theory has already been conceived in Plato's mind, and that he introduces it here for the ex- press purpose of distinguishing between knowledge and opinion.

Here Plato attacks the habit of mind, shown by the LXo0ee&amp;Awv and by most people, that rests content with particulars, and shows that such people have no real knowledge, but only 5b?a. Here, then, for the first time, we have an announcement on the part of Plato that he is going to set up a doctrine that opposes the ordinary conception of the value of poetry and art. And this opposition comes not from any ethical reason, but is made expressly in the name of philosophy; for it is the philosopher who is opposed to the lover of beautiful sights. And the philosopher is, in a word, no longer merely he who by a gift of nature loves to learn,3 but he who accepts and applies the doctrine of ideas. But even now Plato does not condemn poetry or art as such; all that he says is that if the spectator rests content with the contem- plation of sensible objects, he has no true knowledge. The theory of ideas which Plato has already held for some time does not make art impossible; it actually explains that which is valuable in art. Why does Plato write in so different a spirit in the tenth book ? In order to understand the change of spirit, we must consider the theory of ideas that comes between the two discussions of art in the Republic, noting especially the grounds on which Plato came to hold this theory and his attitude toward the theory after he had conceived it. V The theory of Ideas has been so often discussed that I need not in this study give an exposition of it. But I must call attention to a number of points that have been too little noticed, or, at least, that have often been forgotten in the final estimate of the Platonic philoso- phy. I wish in the first place to point out the reasons that drove Plato to formulate the doctrine. I intend, moreover, to inquire to what ex- tent he believed absolute knowledge to be attainable, noticing several indications on Plato's part of a failure to adhere to his own tenets. It is the neglect of this discrepancy that has led to the misunderstanding of Plato's treatment of the poets in the tenth book of the Republic. 1 Rep. 43o a. 2 Ibid., 402 c.

There, we remember, Plato was portrayed as having at one time adhered to Heraclei an views, and as having been weaned from them by Socrates. In order to escape from the flux of Heracleitus, in which no knowledge was possible, Plato had to assume that there is a different kind of reality that could be known. And this he did by supposing the moral concepts of Socrates to have a real existence. That is the germ of the whole theory of ideas: if knowledge exists, it must be of general ideas; it is impossible to deny the existence of knowledge; therefore general ideas must exist. " This argument, which Aristotle calls the 'argument from knowledge,' 2 . . is the only formal argument in defence of the Ideal Theory with which we meet in the writings of Plato himself." 3 The ideas, then, are the postulates of the reason. In the Cratylus, Plato deals especially with this matter. They who gave names to things gave them under the wrong impression that all things are in motion and flux, and try to drag others into the same whirlpool in which they themselves are.4 But Socrates dreams of a real and unchanging beauty and goodness.5 And we can not rightly speak of a beauty that is always passing away and is first this and then that; it is born and vanishes while we speak.6 Nor can knowledge exist if everything changes and nothing abides; 7 but if there is a permanent thinker, and a permanent object of knowledge, they are not like the changing objects of sense.8 Socrates does not positively affirm his view, but observes that the contrary view is very unlikely.9 This appeal to permanent objects of thought as the alternative to the denial of knowledge that is implied in a Heracleitean philosophy persists in other dialogues. The everlasting change in body and in thought is the reason why the soul, like the body, desires immortality.10 That is, the relativity of the world of sense can be escaped only by postulating a real object of knowledge, in this dialogue, beauty. In the Timaeus, that which is apprehended by intelligence and reason is always in the same state; but that which is conceived by opinion with 1 Met.

So the soul, when caught in a tumult of change, does not at first attain to truth, but has only sensations; when the torrent is abated, the soul regains its proper motion, and may be- come rational.2 Phenomena, since they change, have no fixed identity; it is better to say of them that they are " of such a nature," rather than that they are " this " or " that." 3 Again, it is asked whether there is such a thing as self-existent fire, and the other things that are ordinarily supposed to have self-existence.4 Although the present subject, it is answered, does not allow a long digression to establish the point, it will suffice to set forth briefly the great principle to which Timaeus adheres.5 The principle then laid down is that these intelligible, imperceptible forms do exist; the ground, which for us is the important thing, is that reason and true opinion are not the same, but two distinct species, and that the object of reason must therefore be different from that of true opinion. The ideas again appear as practical postulates of reason; if there is knowledge, there must be ideas. Again, in the Parmenides, the difficulties that are involved in supposing ideas to have a real existence are clearly set forth; " he who hears what may be said against them will deny the very existence of them." 6 And yet, as Parmenides points out, if one fixes one's attention on these difficulties and will not admit the existence of ideas, one will have no object for one's mind, and so will utterly destroy the power of reasoning.' What then is to become of philosophy, if ideas are unknown ? 8 The recourse to the theory of ideas, it appears, is once more a postulate of thought. So in the Theaetetus, the Heracleitean doctrine is dismissed as unable to give an account of knowledge; 9 the separate senses give percep- tions of particular things, but general ideas are perceived by the mind alone, without the help of the senses.'0 In the Sophist, again, we find a discussion of the conflict between idealism and materialism. It is admitted that the mind employs a certain kind of motion in the act of thinking; yet if it is admitted that all things are in motion, the mind has no existence. For identity and permanence can not exist without 1 Timaeus, 28 a. 2 Ibid., 43, 44. a Ibid., 49 c. 4 Ibid., 51 b. I Ibid., 51 d. 6 Parmenides, 135 a. Ibid., 135 b. 8 Ibid., 135 c.

Here we have in a few words the whole of Plato's position; the cat is out of the bag. He has adopted the theory of ideas as a less evil than its alternative, the confession that knowledge is impossible. Finally, in the Philebus, Socrates explains the common paradox about the one and the many, which are an impediment to thought,4 by the use of a divine gift,5 which turns out to be nothing else than the theory of ideas, used for the purpose of definition. There is no attempt to prove the existence of ideas; it is not profitable to deal with the diffi- culties involved in the assumption of their existence. It is better to assume them, and to use them.6 The theory of ideas, then, is in origin, according to Plato's account, a postulate of the reason. He even describes it as an hypothesis. In the Phaedo, he assumes the real existence of beauty, goodness, great- ness, and the like, as giving an explanation of immortality.7 This is the hypothesis which he judges to be the strongest, and by agreement with which he proposes to test everything else." If the hypothesis is attacked, it is to be defended by being deduced from another hypothe- sis which appears best of those higher in the scale, till one is reached which is satisfactory.9 Plato gives an example of the method in the Meno.1' And Plato expressly directs that the hypotheses be examined, and says that the testing of them will carry one as far in the pursuit of knowledge as it is possible for man to go." 1 Sophist, 249 b. 2 Ibid., 249 c. 3 Ibid.: Kal iv r p6s ye To'TroV rav~ri X16y pIaXerTov, 8 iv E iritlrTIi7v I4 /pb?qOLvo vo01v dravp'rwv aXvpltrat rept Tros b6rloiiv. 4 Philebus, 14 d.

But Plato was unwilling to stop at this point. The love of beautiful things had led him to the love of beauty itself; and this beauty was a permanent thing, free from the vicissitudes to which particular beautiful things were subject. But the existence of this beauty was only an hypothesis. So the same faith that impelled Plato to postulate the existence of ideas carried him still further to postulate a first cause to which they were related. Ideas must exist, he argued, since knowledge is possible; absolute knowledge must have as its object an absolute idea that is unconditioned. In this way Plato projected an ideal that was nothing more than the logical end toward which the method of dialectic tended. To put the matter in the form of a paradox, the Idea of the Good, like the mental operation of which it is the correlate, is the end of an infinite line. That does not mean that the Idea of the Good, or that the ideas, are mere notions of the mind. For the argument is not: "knowledge is possible if I think that ideas exist; " it is rather: " knowledge is impossible unless ideas really exist." That is what Plato means when he declares that the Idea of the Good, though the cause of being and of knowledge, is higher than being and knowledge.' But we may notice a general tend- ency of Plato to assume conceptions, sciences, and objects of knowl- edge where the tendency of a course of reasoning seems to demand them. It was in this spirit that real beauty in the Symposium was spoken of as incapable of representation in terms either of sense or of thought; 2 that is because language could not keep apace with Plato's imagination. It is for this reason, too, that Plato made the sciences of harmonics and astronomy unduly abstract, in the hope of getting rid of all the bonds of the flesh. So, moreover, he arranged the subjects in his higher education, on the principle of an advance from the sensible to the intellectual, introducing certain of them simply to find suitable objects for the faculties of the mind which he had assumed.3 the Idea of Good." This notion, however, implies that Plato had already thought of the Idea of the Good. I think Burnet is nearer the truth when he observes (ed. Phaedo, note on 107 b 9), " the argument ends with a fresh confession of human weakness." Cf. Pkaedo, 66 b ff.; Timaeus, 29 c; Parmen. 135 e-136 e. 1 Rep. 5o8 e; 5o9 b. 2 Symp. 211 a. s Cf. Jowett, transl. Rep. iii, pp. xciv f.</page><page sequence="46">46 William Chase Greene We need not pause long to ask why Plato chose the Idea of the Good as the first principle of his philosophy. There are enough indica- tions in the history of philosophy before him of attempts to find final causes;' moreover Plato had good authority in Greek usage for giving to the word dyaf6s more than a merely moral or eulogistic meaning - something perhaps more akin to what is implied in the idea of fitness for a particular use.2 Plato, however, was the first to attempt to unite the whole content of the universe in one orderly scheme, in which the operation of things was to be not mechanical but rational; 3 in which existence and goodness were to be merged; and in which each part was to be explained not as separate, but as deduced from one perma- nent principle which was the reason and cause of all things. Thus to know anything would be to explain its relation to this principle.4 It is this explanation that is the goal of the higher kind of dialectic, which proceeds by the use of reason only, without any reliance on sense, till it reaches the end of the intellectual world, which is the per- ception of the absolute good.5 The nature of this perfect kind of dialectic can be understood only by those who have passed through the preliminary sciences.' But whereas even the highest of these de- pend on the use of hypotheses which are left unexamined and unac- counted for, it is only dialectic that proceeds by the destruction of hypotheses to the actual first principle, in order to make itself secure.7 Since the dialectician in general is he who has apprehended the essence of each thing,8 the same principle holds with regard to the Good; only he knows the Good or any good who can abstract and define it ration- ally and pass through all tests, appealing not to opinion but to real existence.9 From this it appears that just as in the lower form of dialectic, exemplified in Phaedo ioi d and 107 b, one hypothesis is deduced from another, and consistency with the highest hypothesis discovered is the supreme test, here all the ideas are regarded as hy- 1 Cf.

The Idea of the Good is thus known indirectly, as the principle that orders the other ideas. The conception of the higher dialectic, like that of the Idea of the Good, is a bold leap of the imagination. It tries to complete in theory what is seen in practice. But when it professes to be a completed science, no longer merely a method, it is only an ideal, an aspiration to which Plato himself is unable to give content: " his mind seems to be filled with a vacant form which he is unable to realize." I That would not, perhaps, in his eyes imply any censure of the conception; 2 he would be content to have pointed out the true end of philosophy. We must, however, note that the ideal is one that not only he but no phi- losopher could more than approximate, valuable as the ideal undoubt- edly is; we must note, also, how far the criticism of art and poetry in the tenth book of the Republic comes from the assumption of a com- pleted science of knowledge and an absolute attainment of truth, such as Plato defined in 511 bc. So far we have examined the reasons that led Plato to adopt the theory of ideas, and have found that it was an hypothesis demanded by the possibility of knowledge, the testing of which, theoretically, would lead one eventually to a vision of the perfect Idea of the Good. We must now ask how far he believed that he, or that any one, could attain to this vision. In almost every dialogue we find expressions of doubt and of hesi- tancy in the affirmation of important doctrines. Many of these, to be sure, are only examples of Socratic irony, and are used for the purpose of calling attention to these doctrines. But others are the genuine expression of a man who feels that much is at stake,3 and that he must feel his way in darkness. He speaks truly through the mouth of Socrates in the Meno: he does not lead others into difficulties when he 1 Jowett, transl. Rep., iii, p. xciii. Plato does not even have any explanationof the relation of mathematical ideas to the Good, or of numbers to ideas. The differences of opinion shown by commentators on the analogies of the Line and the Cave show not that the commentators are lacking in ingenuity or perseverance, but that Plato's own thought about these matters was not capable of being made perfectly precise and consistent.

The one thing in his argument on which he will insist is his duty to seek for knowledge of the things of which he is at present ignorant. So he could hope to be better and more manly and less idle than if he were to suppose that he could not find out what he did not know.2 In the same spirit Simmias in the Phaedo, expecting Socrates to agree with him, observes that knowledge is hard or impossi- ble to gain, but that only a weak man will refrain from testing views and acting on the best of human reasonings, risking himself as on a raft, unless he can get a divine reason.3 So far, the discussion is only of the attitude of mind; the philosopher must not be discouraged by difficulties. But a little later Socrates lays down nearly the same principle as the limit of argument that is humanly possible.4 And Socrates expressly warns his comrades against u.woXoyla,5 hinting that although arguments seem to be unstable, if one is not skilled in reason- ing, there is a true and stable kind of argument that is intelligible, and that could lead to truth and science." What, then, is the hypothesis that Plato regards as most secure? It is simply that of the real exist- ence of ideas, criticized and defended by the appeal to any higher hypothesis that he can find.7 There is in the Phaedo no suggestion that human beings can attain to absolute knowledge; there is merely the exhortation not to be afraid to use the reason, to make use of the hypothesis of ideas, and to test the ideas as far as is practicable. How far does Plato imply in the Republic that absolute knowledge is attainable? The discussion of the higher dialectic and of the Idea of the Good occurs in the course of the creation of the state whose realization is confessedly impossible." Even so, when Adeimantus asks how the Good is to be conceived, and will not be content with 1 Meno, 80 c. 2 Ibid. 86 b. a Phaedo, 85 c. 4 Cf. ibid., 85 c: Tb6 PoOU P TLrtaroP TrP &amp;vOperlcw Ayc X6w a Xa46p7a Kal Gauc4EeXe7K- 6TraTro.

Indeed, he has more in his mind than he can express, and will only describe the " child of the Good." 1 The importance of this passage has been too often overlooked. The confession that Socrates is here represented as making is one that is never retracted or even modified. Plato is no misologue; but he simply can not give a reasoned account of the Idea of the Good. He can only hint at its existence, or depict it by means of a comparison, or describe the steps that one should take in order to approach it. If it be urged that because Plato says that he can not now 3 describe the Good he hopes at a later time to do so, we must remember that in no dialogue does he do so.4 In fact, in no dialogue after the Republic does he even mention the Idea of the Good.5 It is his opinion, whether true or false, that in the world of knowledge the Idea of Good appears last of all and is beheld with an effort; when it is beheld, it is inferred to be the cause of all things good and beautiful; and it is this which one must look upon if one is to act rationally.6 Yet when Glaucon asks for a description of the higher dialectic and of its divisions, and the paths by which the end was to be reached,' Socrates replies that Glaucon could not follow him, however eager his explanation; yet if he should try to set it forth, he could enable one to see something like the truth, and that is all he dares affirm.8 Here again Plato refuses to 1 Rep. 50o6 d.

He was averse to committing his views on this subject to writing; it was not capable of expression like other subjects. If he thought they could be ad- equately written out and communicated, what finer and more useful occupation could he have than to reveal Nature to the light ? But he thought it wiser only to indicate it briefly to a few. (Epistle 7. 341 c-e. I do not think it necessary here to inquire into the authenticity of the Epistles. I will merely remark that many scholars to-day regard most of them as genuine. Even if the present passage were a forgery, however, it would be a stupid forgery if Plato had left any exposition of the Idea of the Good.)

To use the figure just suggested by Glaucon,' he could point to a path which leads in the right direc- tion, but he could not see the end of the path. For Plato, as for us, dialectic, like the Idea of the Good, is a limit which can never be reached: like the sailor's horizon, it always lies before one.2 At times, however, Plato speaks as if the experience of the higher dialectician were actually an attainable goal. We remember that the process, as it is described in the sixth book of the Republic, theoreti- cally involves a double journey; first an ascent by means of hypotheses up to the unconditioned first principle, then a descent, starting from the summit and proceeding without the use of any sensible object, through and to ideas (which are no longer hypotheses but perfect ideas, since they are deduced from the Idea of the Good).3 In the Timaeus, Plato proceeds on the assumption that he has already reached the unconditioned first principle, and that he is coming back into the world of sense. But in describing the creation of the world in accord- ance with a divine pattern he is aware of the fact that he can not entirely follow the rule laid down in the Republic, since he must to a certain extent use sensible materials; of the created copy he can speak only in the language of probability.4 We shall see that Plato's criti- cism of poetry in the tenth book of the Republic is based on the temporary assumption that absolute knowledge of this sort is before him. VI At the beginning of the tenth book of the Republic, Plato expresses his gratification at the legislation that has been passed with regard to poetry. " What is that ? " Glaucon asks. " The exclusion of poetry so far as it is imitative," Socrates replies.5 We remember, however, that imitative poetry was not excluded in the earlier discussion, but only the imitation of the bad. The sentence therefore puts us on our guard for the remainder of the present discussion. If all imitative i Cf. p. 49, n. 7. 2Cf. also Parmenides, 133 c-134 c: absolute knowledge is not within our grasp. 3 Rep. 511 b. Tim. 29 b. * Rep. 595 a.</page><page sequence="51">Plato's View of Poetry 51 poetry is now to be excluded, it must be on some new ground; and, what is more, Plato must have some new motive for wishing to exclude it. The reasons which Plato brings forward in this discussion are two. In the first place, the theory of ideas is to be used in order to account for the nature of imitation; this part of the argument extends from 596 a to 602 c. The theory of ideas, we have seen, was Plato's method of dealing with the fact that knowledge is impossible in a flux. The second ground is the division of the soul into parts; I this division was made, we remember, because it was discovered that the soul can be affected in contrary ways by the same object, and because the soul can apprehend truth only by thought, not by sense. In both arguments, then, what Plato is interested in deciding is whether imitative poetry, as such, can give us an apprehension of truth, it being understood that truth can be apprehended only by the reason. The account of the theory of ideas which Plato here sketches strikes us at once as curious. Whereas in most of the previous discussions of the doctrine he has used ethical ideas and general notions as his ex- amples, in the present instance it is not the beautiful or the good that he adduces, but a bed. Now Plato did at times admit the existence of ideas of created things and of natural genera, as well as of ethical notions.2 So it can not be argued that Plato is giving here an account of the theory of ideas that was for him absolutely false. The interest- ing question for us is: When it was possible for Plato to use as examples in this discussion either the idea of the beautiful or the idea of the bed, why did he choose the latter ? The answer must be that Plato deliber- ately chose the example that lent itself to exhibiting the artist in the most unfavorable light. Such an interpretation is supported by the fact that Plato begins the discussion of imitation with painting, and argues about poetry by analogy; for it is painting that most obviously imitates the objects of sense. Again, when it is possible for Plato to use as his example any of the created things of nature, such as man, he deliberately chooses an artificially created thing, in order to interpo- late another process and to remove the imitative artist still further from the truth. All this discussion is doubtless influenced by the analogy of the divided line; but the analogy can not be pressed in 1 Ibid., 595 a; the results of this division are discussed in 602 c. ff. a Cf. Cratylus, 389; Meno, 72 c; Parmenides, 130 de.</page><page sequence="52">52 William Chase Greene detail. For example, in the present discussion, the created things of nature and those created by the artisan are regarded as having a dif- ferent degree of validity, since the Oe6s is higher than the KXtrVO7rO6s; whereas in the Line, '4^a and TKEUva~rTA are placed together.2 In the allegory of the Cave, however, it is only images 3 and shadows of them that are in the Cave, while the prisoner who is led into daylight, though he sees things at first most easily in shadows and images, finally sees things themselves.4 These discrepancies I cite merely to show that the analogy of the Line and the allegory of the Cave can not be pressed in detail to illustrate the principle of poetic imitation. All that Plato wishes in any case to insist upon is the inferior value of sense to thought in the search for truth; and he places the imitator at one or two or three removes from the truth according to the demands of his special contexts.5 Here, then, he asks once more for a definition of imitation in general.6 Although he has previously reached the conception of an imitation of universals,' here he wilfully reverts to the primitive and obvious notion of imitation - the imitation of particular objects of sense.8 But to this notion he further applies the general condemnation of the objects of sense that is implied in the theory of ideas. Imitation is therefore condemned now, not for the imitation of evil, but because, as imita- tion, it is incapable of apprehending the truth. If one could make both the original and the copy, would one seriously make mere copies and set this sort of imitation as the principle of one's life ? 9 Further, imitative art creates false notions in the minds of specta- tors, who take the image for the reality - though only children and simple persons are deceived. The instance chosen here is curious: they may, at a distance, take a picture of a carpenter (which aims at representing the carpenter as he appears, not as he is) for the real carpenter.10 This argument is connected in thought with the argument that immediately follows only by reason of the fact that both are 1 Cf. also Sophist, 266 b ff. 2 Rep. 50xo a.

The poet, though he speaks of generalship and statesman- ship and all the other arts, speaks of things of which he is ignorant, but imposes on ignorant people by the incantation of metre and other adornments. This is the same matter that Plato discussed in the Ion; 2 and, as in the Ion, Plato will not admit that the poets are authorities to whom one can go for enlightenment in ordinary practical affairs.3 In that dialogue, however, Plato left to the poet the appeal to inspira- tion, a conception whose possibilities he has not yet exhausted; 4 here, the only sort of knowledge that Plato will admit as valid, since he has adopted the method of original and copy, is knowledge of the original which is being copied. And in the present case, of course, the poet turns out to be ignorant. The only reply to this argument would be that the aim of the poet is entirely different; but that reply has been forestalled by Plato in the present case 5 by the assumption that the mere definition of imitation in general will cover the aim of poetry. In a word, he has already begged the question at the start: the rest follows easily enough. Imitation having been proved, by reference to the theory of ideas, to be third from the truth, Plato gives a subsidiary proof of the igno- rance of the artist, not strictly dependent on the theory of ideas.6 It proceeds in Socratic fashion to distinguish degrees of knowledge ac- cording to practical familiarity with things; the user is higher in the scale than the maker, who, in turn, is higher than the imitator. Cor- responding to the arts of these men are three states of mind, knowl- edge, opinion, and ignorance.' This argument, too, hinges on the as- sumption that the aim of the poet is to give information on the practical affairs of life. The other main argument which Plato adduces for the condemnation of poetry is based on the division of the soul, and the discovery that poetry appeals to the irrational part of the soul that can see only ap- pearances. This argument is not strictly new; 8 it derives new force however, from the analogy of the Line and the allegory of the Cave, in I Rep. 6oo e. 2 Cf. pp. 06 f. 3 As the Greeks did go; cf. p. 9.

Protagoras, 356 d.</page><page sequence="54">54 William Chase Greene the light of which the argument must in general be read. Imitation appeals to the faculty that is deceived by the illusions of sense, not to that which is able to correct rationally the variety of appearances. This fact is not confined to the sense of sight, but extends also to hear- ing and to poetry, which imitates men's strifes and inconsistencies, and their lapses from fortitude in pain and sorrow. These passions, indeed, offer a greater variety for imitation than does the equable temperament; and they appeal especially to a promiscuous crowd. But the imitative poet who aims at being popular is not by nature able, nor is his art intended, to please the rational part of the soul. He is like the painter, in that he is interested in appealing to the lower part of the soul, and in that his creations have an inferior degree of truth. Most important of all, poetry can harm even the good; few escape its evil influence. It calls forth our sympathy for imaginary woes, whereas in real life we restrain our feelings; and out of sentimental pity grows a real weakness. In the same way, the enjoyment of comedy tends to turn us into buffoons. In general, poetry feeds and waters the passions, instead of drying them; it enthrones the passions, rather than the reason. For these reasons, Plato concludes, we can not accept Homer as an educator, or admit that he is profitable for the ordering of human affairs. We can admit no poetry in our state save hymns to the gods and praises of famous men; for if the Muse of pleasure is admitted, in epic or in lyric verse, the place of law and of universally accepted reason will be usurped by pleasure and pain. In short, there has always been a quarrel between philosophy and poetry; so that the former judgment of exile passed against poetry is justified by the nature of poetry.' If Plato is trying in the tenth book merely to support his former argument, he has proved his case far too well. It is clearly his purpose in this place to damage the cause of poetry as much as he can. In order to do so, he (a) makes an inaccurate statement about the con- clusion reached in the earlier discussion of art,2 (b) narrows the meaning of the term ip~lips, (c) tacitly assumes that the aim of the poet is either to give practical advice or to play on the passions of the mob, (d) uses trivial or sophistic arguments which he can not himself have 1 Rep. 607 b: 7oatirv o'iCay. ' Cf. p. 38, n. I.</page><page sequence="55">Plato's View of Poetry 55 regarded as conclusive,' and (e) does all this in the name of philosophy! Does Plato mean us to take it all seriously ? Is it Plato's final judg- ment on poetry ? Is he altogether ingenuous ? Plato himself gives us a clue to help us out of the difficulty. He who listens to poetry should, fearing for the safety of the city which is within him, be on his guard against her seductions.2 That very phrase has just been used 3 of the city which is an ideal that can not be real- ized.4 Plato, then, tells us as plainly as words can tell us that poetry is being brought into opposition with an ideal of philosophy such as he himself admits is unattainable. Further, whereas in the earlier discussion of poetry and of art it was in general the higher possibilities of art which Plato had in mind, and which he believed could deal with universals, here it is art as he found it in his own Athens that he con- demns. Having sketched his picture of the ideal philosopher and of the absolute knowledge which is to engage his activity, Plato returns to the world about him, as the liberated prisoner of his allegory returns to the cave, and looks once more at the objects from the contemplation of which his fellow-countrymen hope to attain truth; the images of the cave happen to be the poets. In a certain sense, Plato's task is finished when he has pointed the path to the ideal world. But the temptation to imagine this world to be realized is too great; he must needs, in the spirit of the mime, contrast it with our visible world. So he calls into being his Paradiso, the Civitas Dei, and to it he opposes feeling and the senses in their most specious form. Of course they seem pale and unsatisfactory shadows when they are confronted with the dazzling radiance of the ideal world. Poetry is, poetry in this world must always be, like opinion, in some degree a makeshift. This is not the time to remember all that Plato has said about the contact of poetry with the ideal world, or, on the other hand, his frequent ad- missions that dialectic and the Idea of the Good are only ideals of the imagination; if we have the reality, the poet, as an imitator, is of course superfluous. At this stage, we need remember only that the philosopher is the sole hope of man's happiness, and that philosophy 1 Cf. 6oo a-e; note especially obkoiv (6oo e).

The poet, as he is, has been pronounced to be the ally of the tyrant; 1 he is a sophist; 2 and he is actually taken as an all-sufficient guide.3 It is hardly fair, then, to say that Plato's argument is insincere, though it is so complex as to lend itself easily to misunderstanding. Plato himself realizes how great are the chances against his own ideal being taken seriously, even as an ideal; 4 we must not outdo him and suppose that his exile of poetry from a Paradise is tantamount to sober literary criticism.5 It must be read rather as a dramatic gesture, as a bit of satire on the accredited educators of Hellas. Plato himself adopted the r61le of poet in his sentence against the poets, and the very excess of his argument is almost a sufficient indication that he did not mean us to take him altogether seriously. The "ancient quarrel," then, is simply the quarrel between sense and thought which we have been tracing. And the whole of the present argument is directed toward showing that any one who is content with the world of sensible things or who is content with imitations of them is thereby cut off from any possibility of real knowledge. If poetry is content with such imitation, it is to be condemned. If Plato seriously meant more than this in the Republic, we may expect to find traces of the more severe condemnation in the later dialogues. We may expect also to discover whether the theory of ideas in itself necessarily con- demns imitative poetry. VII The subject of the Phaedrus has been much disputed. Some have held that the subject is love, others that it is rhetoric. Jowett sug- gests 6 that " the dialogue is not strictly confined to a single subject, but passes from one to another with the freedom of conversation." The unity of the dialogue, however, seems to me to have been estab- 1 Cf. Rep. 568 a-d. 2 Protag. 316 d. 3 Cf. Laws, 701 a. 4 Cf. Rep. 473 e. 6 As most critics take it. Cf. Zeller4, ii, pp. 940-945. Stiihlin, Die Stellung der Poesie in der Platonischen Philosophie, following Diimmler, argues (pp. 26 ff.) that Plato is here engaging in a polemic with Antisthenes, and beating him with his own weapons. But Antisthenes would not admit just the theory (of ideas) on which imitative art is here condemned. Cf. pp. 39 f. 6 Jowett, transl. Plato, i, p. 393; cf. pp. 402 ff.</page><page sequence="57">Plato's View of Poetry 57 lished by Bonitz.1 He has shown that the dialogue falls into two parts: (a) the speeches on love, and (b) the discussion of rhetoric. These are intimately related, and neither alone is the subject. The proposition that Plato is putting forward in the dialogue is this: A speaker must know the truth in order to speak.2 So Plato echoes almost the words of the myth about love when he comes to deal with rhetoric.3 This dialogue, then, like several others - the Protagoras, the Euthydemus, and the Gorgias---are examples of an attempt on the part of Plato to carry philosophy over into life, and to make it not merely a theoretical study but a principle of action.4 Plato is opposing the sophistic rhetoric of his contemporaries and putting before them a philosophical ideal; 5 he tries " to establish the conditions of a phil- sophical rhetoric," 6 and to show in what way it is possible to impart the knowledge that he has in theory attained. Although the primary aim of the dialogue is, then, the elucidation of the conditions to which rhetoric should conform, it contains a general statement of the rela- tion of all utterance to truth, and is therefore of concern to us in deal- ing with our special problem. In the second discourse of Socrates on love,' the speaker distinguishes from the kind of madness which is evil a noble madness. The distinc- tion is made more clear in a later passage, where it appears that the divine sort of madness liberates us from ordinary conventions.8 The liberating power of this madness is seen in each of its species - in prophecy, in the inspired rites and mysteries that deliver the guilty from sin, in poetry, and in love. Each of these is one of those mani- festations of feeling and intuition by which the Greeks supposed that they could pass from the immediate object of sense to something be- 1 Bonitz, Platonische Studien, pp. 270 ff. 2 Cf.

So poetry, Plato says, can not be produced by mere art, without the madness of the Muses.2 Is this, then, simply a reversion to the doctrine of inspiration that was dis- cussed in the Ion and mentioned in the Meno? And is the criticism of poetry made under the aegis of the theory of ideas here repudiated ? We must examine more carefully the nature of the inspiration that is here given as the justification of poetry.3 In the account of love, which is the best kind of madness, we are re- minded of the earlier dialogue on love, the Symposium, in which the love of beautiful objects of sense incited the lover to the love of abso- lute beauty. In the Phaedrus, however, Plato not only attempts to depict the process with greater wealth of mythological detail, but he gives us more hints that enable us to connect the account with his view of poetry proper. The soul is figured as a charioteer with a pair of winged horses; in the human being, the pair is ill-matched, one horse being noble, the other ignoble. The wings, the corporeal element most like the divine, tend to soar to " the upper region which is the habitation of the gods, where is the divine - beauty, wisdom, good- ness, and the like - on which the wing is especially nourished." * The gods go to the vault of heaven easily, and at the outside of heaven behold " the things beyond." I At this point, Plato can hardly find words to describe the vision of the absolute that awaits the charioteers; it is absolute reality; it is without color or form, and is intangible; it is visible only to the intelligence that is at the helm of the soul, and with it true knowledge is concerned. On this feeds the divine intelli- gence, and the intelligence of every soul that is capable of receiving its proper food. It beholds perfect justice, temperance and knowledge, not under the form of generation or of relation, but in existence abso- lute.6 But most souls have difficulty in beholding true being, because their steeds are unruly. Many fail, and feed on opinion instead. So with broken wings, they drop to earth, and are born as men. Those souls that have seen most of truth pass into the body of a philosopher or of a lover of beauty or of some other musical and loving nature.' 1 Cf. pp. 6 ff. 2 Phaedrus, 245 a. 3 Ibid.: dr6 Movaoip KaroKWXS i Te Kr jal carla, Xapoac &amp;7rcaXr Kcal ABaro, #4vx, 4'yelpovac Kcl kKclaKXebovac KarL re (~Bcas sKal ar j rp XXtlpy rol7TyL,. 1 Ibid., 246 a-e. 6 Ibid., 247 c. 6 Ibid., 247 c-e.

In the sixth class are found poets and other imitative artists. All must undergo a period of probation, in order to grow their wings again, and to determine what form they are to assume in their next transformation.' Then, in the midst of this highly poeti- cal passage, we are told in purely logical language of the principle that governs the choice of these forms: the human form is reserved for those only who have seen the truth; and this vision is nothing else than the vision of universals, generalized from particular perceptions.2 When Plato comes to apply the present discussion to the subject of rhetoric, he will not pretend that everything in this myth was uttered seriously, but two principles were implied in his discourse the effectiveness of which he would be glad if art could set forth; these are, the compre- hension of particulars under a single idea, and, conversely, the division of wholes into parts according to natural species.3 This power of divi- sion and generalization,4 the power of seeing a One and a Many in nature, is a faculty of which Socrates is very fond; it is, indeed, the mark of the dialectician, as distinguished from the mere rhetorician; it is the most important part of the reformed art of rhetoric that Socrates sketches.5 By dialectic, therefore, man is to try to recover the vision of reality. We must notice, however, that whereas the dialectic described in the sixth and seventh books of the Republic is entirely free from any ' Phaedrus, 249 b. 2 Ibid., 249 bc: oo y&amp;p iy' er pjro re eMokea rizv &amp;X40etav dc 76c 6 feL r 7 x6 ax9mc. 6bei y&amp;p vOpwrov avvz'vac Kar' elbos Xe'y6bevov, &amp;K 7roXXC v ibv a'ltaewv el's ISv XoyLac.u vawapobilepov. roDro &amp;7re Y ~Lavvai.YLtL tIeivoWP v &amp; ror' eL6be rwv n5 I'?vXi aUvropevOeiocra Oe4 Kal bVrepstoD(ca &amp; vvPl eLval QCapeL , Kadi &amp;PaKLaa els 7 -0 8iVWrS. .. . .

So it is necessary for all who are to become men to proceed from the particulars of sense to one form comprehended by reason; 2 and this process is expressly affirmed to be the reminiscence of reality.3 The process is not different, therefore, from that which was described in the Phaedo,4 in that there is a passage from sensibilia to the idea by means of a&amp;vai ivqs. This, apart from the imagery and the conception of the preexistence of the soul, means that the experience of individual objects of sense may lead one to envisage directly an idea that one possesses a priori.5 This process is to be distinguished from the higher dialectic, in which the memories of these ideas are used,6 and by which only one can attain to a perfect initiation into the mysteries. That is the higher dialectic that was sketched in the Republic. So far the description of the regained vision of reality has been given in general terms. The soul beheld beauty, wisdom, goodness, and the like,7 justice, temperance, and absolute knowledge.8 But at this point Plato restricts the description so as to include, as the channel by which the vision of reality is recaptured, only one concept - that of earthly beauty.9 The reason that Plato gives for this restriction is significant. It is hard for man to recall the things of the other world, which he may have seen imperfectly, and the memory of which may have been im- paired during this life.

The tran- sition from ideal truth in general to this particular variety, in other words from rb &amp;p to -6 KaX6bY, had been prepared by the vivid imagery of the brepovp&amp;vos lropeia, and the speaker is able to slip in the word KaXXos at the very commencement of this portion of the discourse, as if it were synonymous with rb 6v, and had formed the subject of the foregoing episode, when in fact it has never once been mentioned."</page><page sequence="61">Plato's View of Poetry 6I ceive an image' of reality, they are bewildered, because their percep- tions are inadequate. Moreover, in the images of justice and temper- ance and other precious ideas there is no gleam of light, so that they are dimly beheld, and few can pass from the contemplation of them to the contemplation of their originals. But beauty was beheld in the other world shining brightly; 2 and we who have come to earth find her shining here, too, by means of our clearest sense - that of sight.3 For though sight can not behold wisdom, it is yet the sharpest of the senses; and beauty alone of the objects of desire, has the privilege of being the most lovely and the most palpable.4 The perception of beauty in this world therefore incites the lover to the sight of absolute beauty,5 and the wings grow anew, though the recollection may be tardy, if the lover's initiation is not recent.6 The meaning of all this discussion appears to be this: it is possible by the perception of visible beauty to gain an immediate apprehension of truth. Sensible objects, to be sure, are not affirmed to be real-- Plato does not in the Phaedrus raise this point so explicitly as in the Phaedo - but they may put us in mind of beauty itself. So at least a part of our inquiry is answered; 7 we find that the theory of ideas, which is by no means given up in the Phaedrus, is not an obstacle to the passage of the mind from the world of sense to truth; it is rather a bridge. Neither has the figure of image and original been dropped,8 though it is not employed in such a wooden way as in the tenth book of the Republic. 1 6;ioloa, Phaedrus, 250 a. 2 Ibid., 250 b. * Ibid., 250 d. * Ibid.: viv 6 KXXh os r6vov rabrTpv IaXe oApav earT' &amp;CSavpararov etva t Kal 4oaorItAL,"ar'ov. * Ibid., 250 e: b'ob'e &amp;Ie&amp;tq 4 fpcrac irp6r at6b b6 KxXos. 6 It would be hard to say how much of the thought and language in this remark- able passage is of Orphic origin or derived from the Mysteries.

But more important than the use of such language is the idea that underlies it; the idea that it is possible by the contemplation of sensible objects to suffer initiation into a blessed state in which one beholds reality. The Plato who wrote the Republic might have used there such ecstatic language about the con- templation of ideas; the significant thing is that it is used here to connect the world of ideas with sensible objects.

Possibly it may be objected, however, that we have here only a general account of the aesthetic experience, somewhat idealized, and that little has been said of poetry proper. It may be admitted that Plato places the lover of beauty in the same class with the philosopher; ' but it is in the very same passage that the imitative poet is placed in the sixth rank.2 The reason is not, however, far to seek. Plato is giving, as we have just said, an idealized account of the aesthetic experience: this may well be compared with the account of the higher dialectic given in the Re- public. It is exactly because such an experience can not be completely realized that Plato is unable to give a description of the super-celestial region that is any more clearly defined.3 The imitative poet, whom Plato has already criticized, so far as he is content with mere images, could not at best attain to the same level that is reached, theoretically, by the lover of beauty; 4 he must, then, perforce be ranked lower. In the assigning of ranks I think we must recognize a certain spirit of humor, another touch of the mime; 5 the poet comes after the poli- tician, the economist, the trader, the gymnast, the physician, and the hierophant. If, on the other hand, we are required to suppose that Plato was serious in his arrangement of ranks, we must notice that the imitative poet is here ranked above the artisan. How that is to be reconciled with the fact that the imitative poet was ranked below the artisan in the tenth book of the Republic is a question that I leave to those critics who hold that Plato was always in earnest when he attacked the poets. Perhaps it may serve the rest of us as a warning against too great literalness of interpretation. Yet there is one more passage in the Phaedrus that will help us to understand the bearing of the dialogue on poetry proper. We remem- ber that the object of the dialogue is to give an idea of the conditions of a truly philosophical rhetoric, a rhetoric that is to be different from that of Plato's contemporaries. The method involves an account of 1 Phaedrus, 248 d. 2 Ibid., 248 e. 3 Cf. Jowett, transl. Plato, i, p. 413: " This is because force of language can no further go." 4 Cf.

Near the end of the dialogue, Plato, having briefly applied these principles to the art of rhetoric, sends an imaginary mes- sage to "Lysias and the other writers of speeches." And here, we must notice, although the discussion has been in the main on the principles of rhetoric, Plato goes out of his way to include the poets: they, and the political writers, if their compositions are based on such knowledge of the truth as surpasses their poor compositions, deserve the name of philosophers; if they can not rise above their compila- tions, they are mere poets and speech makers.' If Plato's main sub- ject in this dialogue had been the conditions of a philosophical poetry, we should undoubtedly have more indications of the methods by which the vision of truth was to be realized in poetry; 2 as it is, the notable thing is that Plato cared at all to pause in his argument to give us the clues by which we are enabled to relate his view of the aesthetic experience as a whole, by means of the theory of ideas, to his view of poetry. Perhaps, then, it is not too much to say that Plato in this manner answers the question that he raised in the Ion about poetic inspiration; he does not, indeed, do away with the conception and the language of inspiration,3 but he replaces it in his mind by the con- ception of the state of enthusiasm that the vision of beauty produces in its lover. In a word, then, inspiration by a god gives place to in- spiration by the vision of the ideas.

Yet he does not abandon the theory of ideas.- In his criticism of poetry, he does not once suggest, however, that poetry can not imitate reality; on the contrary, he expressly enjoins that it shall imitate universals. In the second book, he explains that the object of early education is to train the young in right opinions and habits of character.2 Education is, in a word, the attempt to bring the soul into harmony with reason and law.3 The legislator, therefore, will persuade or compel the poet to express the character of good men; 4 he should be compelled to say that the good man, if he is temperate, is fortunate; 5 and he " shall compose nothing contrary to the idea of the lawful, or the just, or the beautiful, or the good, which are allowed in the state."6 So poetry is to be subject to a censorship.' For Plato still opposes the sort of poetry that exists in his own day; the poets are now subject to no restrictions, and so introduce whatever novelties they think will please and flatter their audience.8 They also are responsible for the idea that injustice can be expiated by sacrifices.9 So far, then, Plato's criticism in the Laws is much like that of the second and third books of the Republic. He is not satisfied with poetry as it is, for it inculcates bad moral notions and seeks rather to appeal to the mob than to assist in the reign of reason and law. But Plato goes farther than that. He actually raises again the question whether comedy and tragedy are to be admitted in the state that he is planning, and, with certain restrictions, admits them. For comedy, he finds, is essential to a complete understanding of things, and may teach us what sort of folly we should avoid.10 But only slaves and hirelings are to be allowed to impersonate comic characters;" and the comic writers shall be admitted only on the condition that their ridicule shall be mere pleasantry, not bitter and serious vilification of citizens.12 What is to be said to the tragic writers, if they beg to be admitted to the state ? Plato cautiously but definitely admits them, provided that they will submit to the censorship. He, too, is a crea- I Cf. Laws, 965. 2 Ibid., 653 ff-.; cf. 815 d ff. s Ibid., 659 d. * Ibid., 660 a.

This passage may be regarded as Plato's answer to Republic 607 b ff. In the earlier passage, Plato is working from sense to thought, from particular to universal. Finding poets, as they exist, to be an obstruction, he resorts to the poetical expedient of banishing them. His motive there, as he tells us, is the building of a city; 2 and this city proves to be not any actual city, by the time that the exile of the poets is decreed, but a city expressly de- voted to the fulfilment of an ideal which Plato admits is unattainable. In the Laws, Plato is speaking as a poet,3 but as a poet who has achieved a greater degree of truth and hence a greater seriousness of purpose than other poets. When he undertakes here to step back into the world of sense, he welcomes the cotiperation of these other poets, so far as their aims can be made to fall in with his own. Indeed, when we remember the dramatic character of the whole discussion, it is per- haps not too much to say that Plato is himself speaking in the mouths of the petitioning poets, as well as in the mouths of the legislators. Since he has once used the image of a state and of exiled poets to ex- press the conception of a conflict between thought and sense, he ad- heres to it in the expression of a partial reconciliation. If this be true, Plato is himself definitely announcing his own belief in an austere and chastened poetry as a vehicle for the realization of his ideals. The poetic faculty is still irresponsible; 4 yet the inspiration I of the poet is to be enlisted in the discovery of the best hymns.6 Thus the legis- lator (i.e. the philosopher) does not surrender the right which he claimed in the Republic, of laying down the forms to which the poets are to submit; 7 but he is more friendly to the poets than he was in the Republic, since he is now dealing with a possible commonwealth more like ordinary Greek states.8 If he had written the third plan of I Laws, 817 a-d. t Rep. 378 e: ob~ k .opL trovral ky6 7e cKal cri b &amp; Tvr rapbj7, dXX' oLuorral rbMco s. t Laws, 817 b. 4 Ibid., 670 e; 682 a. 6 Ibid., 802 b; 682 a.

Reality can be ap- prehended only by thought, yet we live in a world of sense; poetry can be approved only if it helps us to pass from sense to thought. It remains for us to consider a number of indications that Plato has given of the way that he viewed the opposition, indications widely scattered in the dialogues, giving evidence of a persistently held attitude. As in the Symposium, the Phaedo, the Republic, and the Phaedrus the lover of beauty climbs from beautiful things up to beauty itself, he comes back in the other direction, Plato hints at times, to express this vision in the world of sense. We must note, then, in the first place, the difficulty that Plato finds in expressing the relation of the world of sense to the world of ideas. In every case he has to resort to a metaphor, though no single phrase is altogether satisfactory.3 He can show us the Good only through the " child of the Good." The reason is that our minds can not easily grasp abstract ideas without visible symbols.4 But it is because the ideas are in some way represented in the world of sense, however im- perfectly, that we begin our search for them. So the discussions in the Symposium, the Phaedo, and the Phaedrus imply the existence of the universal beauty in particular things, not necessarily in " works of art," but among beautiful things of all sorts.6 It is only because of a 1 Laws, 739 c. 2 Finsler suggests (Platon und die Aristotelische Poetik, pp. 243 f.) that Plato's views in the Laws, though reflecting the struggle through which he had passed, rep- resent almost a return to those of his youth. Possibly this is going too far; yet it is not mere caprice that sees in the partial reconciliation of the Laws something like the aspiration for a purified love of beauty that we find in the Symposium.

It is possible, then, for a universal idea to find expression in sensible form. This may mean simply the shaping of material for a certain purpose: so the workman, if a shuttle is broken, will use not the broken instrument as a model for a new one, but the imagined shuttle which expresses the essential nature of the shuttle.' Indeed, this conception of an ideal to which the artisan " looks " is a favorite one with Plato.2 The orator, likewise, should have an ideal in view.3 The ideal may be only an imaginary perfection, such as we never see in our visible world; yet it may be exactly such an ideal that an artist sets himself to depict.' Such a procedure is Plato's own purpose in seeking for per- fect justice.5 Yet the philosopher who has gained a vision of truth will be no mean artificer of virtue.6 When the divine Demiourgos of the Timaeus stamps the ideas upon the matter, using the unchangeable as his model, his creations are fair; when he uses the changeable, they are not fair; 7 but in ordinary life we have to admit that the good is a mixture of different qualities and to accept music although it is an impure form of knowledge.8 The value of any sort of imitation, Plato holds, depends on the extent to which the imitator knows the thing that he professes to imitate; so the sophist is criticized because he has no knowledge of virtue. But there is such a thing as a scientific or 1 Cratylus, 389 b: 1Xeirwv prp s KCeJvo 76 ets o rp6s rep KaOi P KaTr7ev 4lrolte; . O. oiv . .. ..roas p be 6tL?

So far as universals (not merely sensibilia) are known, then, Plato would admit the pos- sibility of imitating them.2 It is not hard to apply the notion of imitation in sculpture and painting, from which the notion of copy and original may well have been derived in the first place and transferred to the vocabulary of the theory of ideas.3 How ideas are to be expressed in other media is a more difficult problem. Yet Plato believed that not only can a physi- cal shape be expressed in different materials,' but physical and mental qualities can be imitated in painting and music,5 and beauty is to be found embodied in different forms.6 That is because things are similar to each other by reason of their relation to the same idea; ' and in this way it is possible to speak of spiritual beauty.8 So the problem that confronts the artist is that of correctness of imitation; 9 he must, since music is imitative, seek that which represents the beautiful.10 Although Plato's illustrations here have been drawn chiefly from music and sculpture, the same principles hold, he affirms, in the other arts." And it is precisely because the poets of Plato's time deny the existence of any such standard of correctness that they are censured.12 1 Sophist, 267 d: Tip i pLer' TLiTrypp la rooputcv rea Zl/4wq/t,. 2 It has been held that since in the Republic the poets are always regarded as imi. tators, the admission of certain kinds of poetry is tantamount to a distinction be- tween a true and a false imitation.

This Plato recognizes. Yet he holds that it is possible to appeal to the soul through the eyes and the ears in such a way that it shall be properly disposed toward the truth, because good habits are inculcated and fostered. So the dances of the unwarlike Muse express an escape from danger or labor into good, or the preservation and increase of former good.' Music, in a similar way is to be used to symbolize the character of a brave man, and should be adapted to the words, rather than the words to the music; 2 indeed, Plato's objection to instrumental music without words is the difficulty presented to the hearer of recognizing that any worthy object is being imitated by it.3 His perception of the difficulty of explaining in just what way music and words are related to ideas may be traced in his diction.4 Indeed the relation is one that can not be precisely stated, any more than could the hierophant at the mysteries always say why certain rites and symbols were supposed to give access to grace. Plato would have to admit, as Aristotle said of the mysteries,5 that the hearer of music does not learn anything so much as feel certain emotions and fall into a certain frame of mind. It can not be doubted, however, that Plato had in mind also a notion of the relation of mathematics to ethics.6 We have come very near to the heart of Plato's conception of poetry. When he remarks in the Republic that he is afraid that he is speaking like a tragic poet,' he means only that he is speaking metaphorically; for he has half revealed, half hidden in symbolic language the truth that he would fain express. And that is the trait of the poet.8 Enigma- tical or figurative language may be used to darken counsel,9 or to hint 1 Laws, 815 de. 2 Rep. 399 e. 8 Ibid., 669 e. 4 Ibid., 399 a 6: uLL/LAa4Tro 399 c 3: uAiaouvrac; 400 a 2: gre~aT ; 4oo a 7: To'La 'Wirolov Oiov pJljpa'Ca; 400 b 3: rp-irovwac; 400oo C 7: &amp;oXovO; 4oo d 2: brecraL 6poLobpevov; 400 d 5: ra r&amp; ye X67c d&amp;KoXovO?Ir-ov; 400 d 7: 7 ris 77vX s OX e grerac ; 400 e i: KoXoOvOEL; 401 a 7: d6eX4&amp; rT Kci /lca laTa; Phileb. 17 d: rv rTe TaLs KL*TeWaV a Tro^ acl?aros &amp;repa "rotaD'ra kb6vra 7r&amp;'077 yLyv6Mbeva; Laws, 661 c 7: itro/p- vovs; 956 a 6: XpcLparTa 6~ XevKa&amp; pbrOPT 'av OeoL~ eq.

The poet, as seer, has beheld the truth; it is as artist that he seeks to convey it by means of images.2 We have therefore come back to the problem that puzzled Socrates in the Phaedo; how is the poet who has conceived an idea that embodies truth to find the images that will constitute a myth ? 3 Socrates is represented as perplexed by the difficulty of find- ing a myth that will express a certain abstract idea. This, it appears, is his conception of the end of poetry; for, although he recognizes that philosophy is the greatest form of music,4 nevertheless when he is con- vinced by a dream that he should apply himself to music in the popular sense, he tries for the first time to compose poetry. First he composes hymns to the god of the festival; 5 then he reflects that the mark of a poet is the invention of myths, not reasoned discourse,6 and so, adopt- ing some myths from Aesop, he sets them to music.7 In this distinction between 000os and X6yos, here made by Socrates in the Phaedo, Plato perseveres.8 Avapbs yvoptlar" i~.7 7e p rpbs 7(b)ete 70oabrT7b elva, &amp;raY X&amp;7raeCL &amp;vdpbs )Oovepo Tre cKal p7) fovXopJLvovU ?JLV EV6EIvUrOaO &amp;XX' d&amp;roKpbrTerTOatc6 -tr /&amp;XLTra Tjv ab-ro ao~olav breppvc&amp;s ?i vr Xpjlpa cf s baTvoaoov Oatvve rat Sv7r wore voovaLv xaaTros abtcv. 1 Phaedo, 69 c: oali KLVIUVEUOctL Kcl Tra TE-ETc a&amp;s I O&amp;TO&amp;T KaTr rVTes O 4aLvXot rLves eIvaL, AXXad 7T Ory 7 rd'aX aivlTrec0atL 671i.8 &amp;V &amp; a/41rTO0s Kal &amp;T xET0s Els 'ALboV &amp;CkoLK7)a&amp; E OpfI6pIP f KeLaETaL, 5E KEKcaOappeVos Te Kal TETEXEcjAeVOs &amp;Ketae cLK61AVOS /LETd OeEC oiv LKjatE. etativ yap 5a, ,Oaav ol rept ras TrXer&amp;v, " vapOl0xo46pot jpV wroXXoi, 3&amp;KXO&amp; 5 U e rav"poL. 2 Aristotle has interpreted Plato somewhat narrowly; but his general concep- tion is the same.

In general, I am glad to be able to agree with Stewart in holding that the myths are to be distinguished from allegory; they do not take the place of reasoned discourse.' They appeal rather to that "part of the soul" which expresses itself not in " theoretic judgments " but in "value-judg- ments," or rather in " value-feelings." Plato never resorts to myths when his meaning could be adequately stated in logical formulae. Hence he is always careful to explain that he does not affirm his myths to be true in detail, or real objects to correspond with each part of them.2 He does hold, on the other hand, that one would do well to act on the belief that they are in some sense true.3 They are, perhaps, like the " noble lie." 4 How does Plato himself believe that the poet 5 comes to find the particular images that are to assist his hearers to contemplate truth ? 1 The Myths of Plato, pp. 20 ff. 2 Cf. pp. 69 f. 3 Phaedo, IIo; II14d; Rep. 621Ib; Phaedrus, 252 c; 265 c; 274 c; Politicus, 277 a. 4 Cf. Rep. 414 b ff.; 377 de; Politicus, 309. ' It may be convenient at this point to ask in what sense Plato regarded the poet as a creator. The word TroLica was at first used of any sort of created thing. So Herodotus speaks of 7roL?caLara Xpteaa (4. 5), or 7roLlcTara X1c XKea Ka aSleapE (2. 135). In this sense, too, Plato could speak of the frotrr'ts of a KXi'l (Rep. 597 d). Plato also distinguishes the rolqars that is carried on by man from the divine creation (Sophist, 266 d ODas lpya rotL~ewrs; cf. Symp. 197 a: w v owv roilr7v ir4drwo). He distin- guishes likewise between the general meaning of irotlacts as a creation of something that did not previously exist (Symp. 205 bc; Sophist, 265 b), and the special mean- ing of the word as applied to metrical composition (Symp. 205 c. So Protag. 325 e; Rep. 6oo a; Laws, 802 b, refer to the poet simply in the accepted and narrowed sense. Gorg. 449 d; 502 a; Rep. 394 c; Phaedrus, 245 a, 278 c, refer to poetry specifically as concerned with metre and music). In this sense, the poets leave creations, that is, the poems which are their offspring (Symp. 209; cf. Sophist, 265 b: j t-p rou 1tALIAt Ls irol0Iols riS &amp;rav, eCb16WP k p ro7 . .. . XXA' obK abr3V ^p4arwv. Plato could, on the other hand, refer to the writing of poetry in a depreciatory sense, as mere compiling (Phaedrus, 278 de). From this it appears that to Plato, as to Greeks generally, the activity of the poet was creative only so far as it created poems; it could not create ideas (cf. Rep. 596 b: no workman can create the b8ka). In this respect the imitative poet is dif- ferent from the ideal lover of beauty who does, by union with beauty, beget fair discourse (Symp. 21o d) and truth (212 a). Henri Weil has proved that the Greeks generally used the derivatives of the word wromw in a narrower sense than we com-</page><page sequence="72">72 William Chase Greene This is a matter in which the legislation of the state not only could not help but would have a positively baleful effect; 1 nor can even an art produce poetry by laws of its own.2 Plato wisely does not try to tell how poetry is produced. So far as he commits himself on the subject at all, it is by falling back on the doctrine of inspiration, which, to be sure, he has modified considerably.3 He is himself too much a poet to believe that it can ever be possible to lay down rules for the composi- tion of poems. It is impossible, too, for him to solve the problem by an appeal to the conveniently ambiguous language of modern discus- sions. He "has no term for imagination as a faculty intermediate between abstract or verbal thought, on the one hand, and sense- perception, on the other. For avcraaria takes its color from qbai~prat and davraTerat, which includes all forms of opinion and illusion, and it is often merely a disparaging synonym of &amp;6~a." I Most modern appeals to " imagination " as the source of poetic inspiration are de- cidedly less helpful than Plato's recourse to divine madness. Perhaps a still more significant reason for Plato's failure to give a reasoned account of the poet's method is his perception of the fact that poetry is produced under the conditions of a flux, to which reasoned rules could not possibly apply. The vision of the poet as seer is de- termined by the immutable principles that are the same for all individ- uals, however imperfectly individuals may envisage them; but the poet as writer must deal with the evanescent sensibilia that no a priori principles can completely order. Generally the process will work in one of two directions, although it may be hard to pigeon-hole given cases too nicely. Either a definite experience encountered in the world of flux, an experience that appears to be unique, impresses the monly attach to the word poet (Etudes sur l'Antiquitt Grecque, Paris, 19oo; pp. 237 ff.: L'Origine du Mot Podte). He seems to me, however, to be mistaken in saying (p. 239), that what the Attic writers meant by irotetv A0ov was not to invent a story but to put it in verse, and in citing the Phaedo as proof of this. Doubtless the expression did generally mean " to tell a story in verse "; but the very remark made in this place by Socrates is that he was not himself good at telling stories (abr&amp;s o0 6i JwOoXoYrcK6, 6I b), and, therefore, borrowing stories from Aesop, he set them to music (cf. Burnet, note on 60 d i). The task of the genuine poet, then, would be to find the 1A00os as well as to put it in verse; he is the creator, not, to be sure, of ideas, but of images. 1 Politicus, 299 b-e. 2 Phaedrus, 245 a. a Cf. p. 63. 4 Shorey, Unity of Plato's Thought, p. 48.</page><page sequence="73">Plato's View of Poetry 73 poet so strongly by some phase of beauty that he determines to fix it in words, and in the process of so doing he lets shine through his work the ideal beauty that he beheld during his experience. The poems of Homer would be, in the main, an example of this process. Or the poet may conceive an abstract idea, and then endeavor to clothe it in such imagery as will present it concretely to those who have not yet become acquainted with it, trusting that their perception of the concrete imagery will serve as an initiation for them into the perception of the ideal beauty that he has seen. Of such a process we find instances in the hymns to the gods that Plato approves, and in his own myths. X We have now reached a point where we may turn and look back on our study in the hope of disengaging certain results. Yet once more we must caution ourselves against hoping for a definite formula that shall represent Plato's views. Plato himself knew better than that. He realized that truth is elicited from the conflict of views, and from the struggle with ever-recurring problems. He felt at liberty to modify and expand or even to retract statements, if the argument so de- manded. He did not build a system of philosophy; he did much more than build a system, for he laid bare the springs from which all later streams of philosophy have flowed. His work then could never be finished or completely consistent. Above all, we must remember that Plato was a man in whose own breast raged the conflict between poetry and philosophy. Had he not himself been a poet, he had not been able to feel with such desperate seriousness the danger of poetry, or to resort, in a rash moment, to the poet's gesture of exiling the poets; had he not been a philosopher, he had not been able to see the heights to which poetry, regarded as an ideal, should climb. What makes our study so difficult is that the whole problem is not a mathematical puz- zle but the workings of a human personality, the least ponderable of all things. We can set forth all that is certain; the rest can not be explained till personality can be explained. We must suppose Plato, it follows, to have been born with a genius of many kinds. In his boyhood, the love of poetry and of the world of images and colors and sounds appealed strongly to him. As a stu- dent of philosophy he inclined to the creed that recognized most defi-</page><page sequence="74">74 William Chase Greene nitely this fascinating world. He had also a leaning toward reasoning about ethical matters, which found nurture in his association with Socrates. Later, during travels in Magna Graecia, he came into touch with the Pythagorean and Orphic sects, which stimulated, on the one hand, his tendency to speculate in a mystical fashion about the origin and the destiny of the soul, and which aroused, on the other hand, his interest in mathematics and pure science. When he started to teach in the Academy, all these interests crowded his mind, and he wavered in his devotion to them. Gradually the scientist in him came more and more to the fore, and tended to crush the poet; but the suppres- sion was never complete. For one thing, the instinct of the poet was born too deep in him; and, as he came to realize after his first flush of enthusiasm was over, science itself has a limit. If man can not rid himself altogether of the trammels of sense, he may then at least use his earthly surroundings in order to see through them or to express by them the reality beyond them that his faith gives him. We have traced the opposition of Plato's interests through a number of dialogues. In the Ion, we saw him weigh and reject the ordinary notion of poetic inspiration, reserving for some later occasion a more adequate explanation of the value of poetry. In the Symposium, we saw him sketch the ultimate goal to which the experience of the love of beauty, breaking away from sense and ascending by means of thought, should proceed. In the Phaedo, we found him elaborating the distinc- tion between sense and thought, and indicating the manner in which, by the use of the theory of ideas, the ascent may be made from sense to thought. In the Republic, we saw him restrict the province of po- etry, because of an ethical interest; and we watched him develop the hope of finding absolute knowledge to such a point that, for a moment, he almost imagined himself to have attained it, and spurned the poetry that clung to the world of sense. In the Phaedrus, we discovered him returning to the problem of inspiration, and relating it to the doctrine of ideas, distinguishing between the perfect experience of the ideal lover of beauty and the imperfect experience of the imitative poet. And, finally, in the Laws, we beheld him in a more practical mood reopen the issues of the Republic and, without his assumptions of om- niscience, waive the condemnation of poetry in favor of a more temper- ate, though still an austere, acceptance of the art.</page><page sequence="75">Plato's View of Poetry 75 Plato, then, did not formulate a definite creed about the poetic faculty, and his special utterances are moulded by special interests. Accordingly, those interpreters are mistaken who attempt to make a sweeping generalization - as that Plato expelled the poets,' or that his real doctrine is contained in myths. But in spite of minor incon- sistencies it is possible to see that Plato held during most of his life that thought and an understanding of life are possible only on the hypothesis that eternal forms exist, and that thought is ultimately an act of intuition which passes from the perception of particulars to the contemplation of these eternal forms. The absolute, for him, is both a principle of existence and a principle of goodness and beauty, and hence, in theory, can be approached either by a hypothetical science of dialectic or by the direct intuition of the lover of beauty. In prac- tice, this goal is never attained, for both thought and aesthetic experi- ence are corrupted by sense. Sensible objects and symbols may, how- ever, put one in a way of approximating a vision of reality; and though the lover of beauty has to a certain degree a vision of reality, he can communicate this vision only by the imitation of it by means of sen- sible objects. If this imitation is regarded as true and valuable of it- self, it is to be condemned; and since most contemporary poetry was content, Plato thought, to produce images without passing on to the ideal world, it was so far to be condemned. He recognized, however, that the poet might express eternal forms, and so far as he did so, he became a philosopher. In some such way Plato imagined that the ancient conflict between philosophy and poetry might cease. 1 So, for example, I am obliged to disagree with R. K. Hack (The Doctrine of Literary Forms, H. S. C. P., xxvii (1916), pp. 1-65), who holds that Plato, in order to enthrone scientific truth, excluded poetry (p. 44; pp. 47 f.), ignoring the fact that poetry is really the expression of man's creative power (p. 45), and has nothing to do with universals (p. 54). I hold, however, that Plato was right in believing that some sort of ideal theory must penetrate even the province of art, as a counterblast to the hopeless confusion that would come from a mere creative impulsive or mere expressiveness. My disagreement with the author of this brilliant essay on one point does not prevent me from admiring the essay in general. And I agree with him that the too literal interpretation of the doctrine of ideas has led the practi- tioners of literary art and the critics at times into grave errors.</page></plain_text>
