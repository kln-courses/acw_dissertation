<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> ABOUT STEAKS LIKING TO BE EATEN:  THE CONFLICTING VIEWS OF SYMBOLIC  INTERACTIONISTS AND TALCOl l  PARSONS  CONCERNING THE NATURE  OF RELATIONS BEWEEN PERSONS  AND NONHUMAN OBJECTS  Joseph Cohen*  University of Washington  Reasoning on the basis of the nature of a series of characteristics of social systems, Talcott  Parsons asserted that relations of persons with others are interactional, but that their relations  with what he called nonsocial objects-physical and cultural objects-are other than interaction-  al. Logical as well as common sense considerations show that persons do interact both with  categories of objects. Symbolic interactionists hold that interaction of persons with nonhuman  objects-their designation of what Parsons called nonsocial objects-occurs during the course of  the persons taking the roles of such objects internally with presumed mutuality, that is thinking  about them, and interpreting them as one or another of three different kinds of signs. In the  symbolic interactionist perspective, the overarching background of all interaction is the active self  mediating reflexively between the persons and whatever kinds of objects with which they are  involved.  It is surely an anthropomorphism to suggest that a steak likes to be eaten in the same  sense in which a hungry man likes to eat the steak.

In respect to both  kinds of situations, the analytical focus of the proponents of this position is upon  the reaction of the subjects to the objects, and not upon the possible interaction  between them which may be deemed, from other points of view, to occur.  Theories in the second group posit that relations between and among persons are  interactional, but that relations between persons and nonhuman objects are not  interactional. A formulation expounded by Talcott Parsons during the period from  the end of World War I1 into the 1970s-at which time he was a dominant figure, if  not the most dominant figure in American sociology, and whose influence in the  field of sociological theory continues on strongly to this day-was the most compre-  hensive and forthright of these theories. Parsons asserted that all significant rela-  tions of persons with one another are interactional, involving the subject and the  object mutually. He held further that although relations of persons with nonhuman  objects may sometimes have the appearance of being interactional, as in the case of  the anthropomorphism of a steak liking to be eaten, it is never possible for such  relations to be truly so.  Theories in the third group assert that persons interact both with human and with  nonhuman objects. Persons are viewed as interacting with nonhuman objects in a  process that is essentially the same as the process that occurs in the interactional  relations of persons with each other. This latter was the view of George Herbert  Mead, who viewed relations in both categories as occurring in the context of social  acts in which persons relate to all kinds of objects as vehicles or as producers of  signs, which the persons interpret and respond to out of habit at one extreme, or in  some original, reflective or creative way at  the other.  In this analysis, which focuses principally on Mead’s conceptualization of the  nature of relations of persons with nonhuman objects, I take for granted that  interpersonal relations are interactional. My special interest is in the grounds for  holding that relations with nonhuman objects may be viewed as also being so. In  the next section I present Talcott Parsons’ intermediate position, namely that  persons interact with human, but not with nonhuman, objects. No other author  before or since Parsons has set forth so forthrightly, so comprehensively and so  clearly, in sociological terms, the claim that a quantum difference exists between  the nature of relations of persons with one another and the nature of their relations  with nonhuman objects. By presenting the views of Parsons which are in opposition  to those of Mead, I believe that I can best clarify the central issues.  Parsons viewed persons in their relations with human objects, and with human  objects alone, as susceptible to interaction on the basis of the distinctive characteris-  </page> <page sequence="3"> About Steaks Liking To Be Eaten 193  tics of social systems. These characteristics can be summarized with a close approx-  imation to Parsons’ own language as follows:  1. Persons are capable of cognition, that is, of conceptualizing what objects are;  of cathexis, that is,, of responding with the expenditure of emotional energy to  cognized objects; afld of evaluation, that is, of preferring particular cognized  objects over others. Parsons referred to cognition, cathexis and evaluation as the  modes of orientcrtion, Persons are capable of orienting themselves in these three  modes both toward human objects and toward nonhuman objects.’ Nonhuman  objects such as steaks, in contrast are capable of orienting themselves in these  modes neither toward human objects nor toward other nonhuman objects (1951b,  pp. 3-15).  The modes of orientation of persons toward human objects are mutual; that is,  subjects and objects share each others’ cognitions, cathexes and evaluations. Since  persons alone are capable of the modes of orientation, mutuality between persons  and nonhuman objects, such as between persons and steaks, is precluded (1953, p.  27).  2. Persons occupy social positions and enact corresponding roles as structural  elements of social systems. Whenever the person enacting any given role in an  action situation is the subject of analytical reference, Parsons designated him as  ego, and he designated the person enacting the counter-role as alter. A mother is an  alter from the standpoint of her son. Since a steak is not capable of the modes of  orientation, it cannot occupy social positions, nor can it enact roles. In Parsons’  view, therefore, it did not make sense-or rather it made anthropomorphic  nonsense-to refer to a steak as an ego or as an alter (1951a, pp. 14-15,25-26,39-  40).  3. Role enactments are generally in compliance, but sometimes in witting or  unwitting noncompliance, with the norms of the encompassing social system. At  the level of individual actors, norms are experienced as expectations by ego and  alter in respect to each other’s behavior. Conformity to expectations is highly  contingent upon the gratification and nongratification which alter contributes to  ego’s viscerogenic and derived needs. Gratification and nongratification, when  linked to conformity and nonconformity, are termed positive and negative sanc-  tions, or rewards and punishments, which one actor bestows or inflicts upon  another. It is true that ego can provide gratification to alter by serving him a steak.  He can thereby intentionally or inadvertently influence the latter’s conformity to  the former’s expectations. A steak itself, however, cannot relate gratification to  conformity and nonconformity. That it cannot do so is, in fact, just a special case of  its not being an actor. As a consequence of its lack of capacity for engaging in the  modes of orientation and for occupying social positions, a steak cannot respond to  ego’s expectations nor have expectations of ego’s behavior. To assert that it can is  to perpetrate an anthropomorphism (1951a, pp. 11-19, 64-67, 98-105; 1951b, 36-  40).  4. Parsons’ central concern in the article from which the first quotation above  was excerpted is the nature and significance of the operation of what he called the  </page> <page sequence="4"> 194 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 12/No. 2/1989  psychological mechanism of internalization. This concern is central in his whole  theory of personality. Internalization, by Parsons’ definition, is the mechanism  whereby personality traits of alter become constitutive elements of the personality  of ego and of ego’s action. It is also the product of the operation of this mechanism.  When ego internalizes alter’s expectations of ego’s behavior, external compulsions  and constraints become constitutive elements of ego’s motivational system and of  his conscience. The capacity for internalization presupposes the capacities for  mutuality in the modes of orientation, for occupancy of social positions, and for  having and responding to expectations. Lacking these capacities, a steak cannot  either internalize or be internalized (psychologically, of course!) (1951a, pp. 14-24;  1951b, 36-45).  Two questions come to mind regarding Parsons’ view of relations between  persons and nonhuman objects as being noninteractional. The first is: If such  relations are not interactional, what is their specific noninteractional nature? Par-  sons did not specify, but we are able to detect two possible lines of answers in his  writings. Neither is satisfactory. One answer is that he adopted by reference the  position of the psychologist Edward C .  Tolman, widely known for his theory of  Purposive Behaviorism, with whom, among others, Parsons collaborated in writing  Toward a General Theory of Action: Theoretical Foundations of the Social Sciences  (1951a). It is not necessary to say more here about Tolman’s theory than that it is a  learning theory which incorporates important elements of cognitive theory. Cogni-  tive theory, however, tends to be interactional in respect to relations of persons  both with others and with nonhuman objects.  Parsons (1952, 1964) also had a very strong commitment to certain aspects of  Freudian theory, most specifically in respect to his interests in the concept of  internalization and to his interest in the broad field of family relationships. Freud,  too, did not differentiate analytically between the nature of relations of persons  with each other and the nature of their relations with nonhuman objects.3  The second question to be asked with respect to Parsons’ view of the nature of  relations between persons and nonhuman objects is: Precisely what did he have in  mind when he characterized the notion of a steak liking to be eaten as an anthro-  pomorphism? Anthropomorphization needs to be considered seriously by social  scientists. It should not be used as a garbage-chute down which to toss that which is  not understood. The uttering of anthropomorphisms in their exceedingly diverse  forms is a universal phenomenon of no minor significance. Wherever they have  lived in the world, and in all ages, people have thought, conversed and read (where  and when they have read at all), in varying degrees, in the anthropomorphic mode.  I shall argue in the next section that, when a prescribed kind of analysis is made  of anthropomorphizing behavior in the course of relations of persons with physical  objects, light is cast upon the nature of their nonanthropomorphizing behavior in  their relations with such objects. I show that anthropomorphizing behavior and  nonanthropomorphizing behavior are far from being totally disparate.  111  In this section I present four incidents in each of which it is made clear that  explicitly interactional relations do occur between persons and components or  </page> <page sequence="5"> About Steaks Liking To Be Eaten 195  segments of their nonhuman world. In the first two incidents I present persons,  both of whom are writers, who describe their relations with specific nonhuman  objects. To us, as detached and objective observers, but not to those writers as  participants in the events described, the relations are anthropomorphic. We under-  stand them as considering themselves to be actually taking the roles of those  nonhuman objects and to be perceiving those objects as in turn taking their roles in  the same kind of way even though they, of course, do not perceive the matter in  these technical terms. These incidents differ from Parsons’ hypothetical steak,  which he presumed not to be capable of liking to be eaten, insofar as they are not  far-fetched; they were actual. The third and fourth incidents are “normal,” that is,  they are incidents involving nonanthropomorphic interaction with nonhuman  objects.  Consider a description by the writer John Steinbeck of an often-repeated inci-  dent that occurred during a trip lasting many weeks, which he made in a coach-  camper across the United States in company with his poodle, Charley (1962, p. 12).  Charley likes to get up early, and he likes me to get up early too. And why shouldn’t  he? Right after his breakfast he goes back to sleep. Over the years he has developed a  number of innocent-appearing ways to get me up. He can shake himself and his collar  loud enough to wake the dead. If that doesn’t work he gets a sneezing fit. But perhaps  his most irritating method is to sit quietly beside the bed and stare into my face with a  sweet forgiving look on his face; I come out of deep sleep with the feeling of being  looked at. But I have learned to keep my eyes shut. If I even blink he sneezes and  stretches, and that night’s sleep is over for me. Often the war of wills goes on for quite  a time, I squinching my eyes shut and he forgiving me, but he nearly always wins. He  liked traveling so much he wanted to get started early, and early for Charley is the first  tempering of darkness with dawn.  Charley was a nonhuman object of orientation. Steinbeck left no doubt that he  interpreted Charley’s noisy movement of his body and of this collar, along with his  obliquely sarcastic sweet and forgiving look, to be what Parsons and other sociolo-  gists call an expectation. To this expectation, on the part of the dog ritually  repeated each morning, Steinbeck sometimes responded by evasively simulating  sleep. At other times he conformed grudgingly. This behavior was in the selfsame  manner in which he might have responded to the expression of an expectation on  the part of Mrs. Steinbeck or  of other humans. Nor can there be any doubt that,  over the years, the millions of readers of the book implicitly assumed Steinbeck to  be properly making this interpretation, as they themselves made it in taking  Steinbeck’s attitude while reading the account.  This episode is an illustration of the anthropomorphizing manner in which  persons relate to some nonhuman objects as if such objects were, in fact, having  expectations of their behavior and experiencing other characteristics of interaction.  We consider that Steinbeck’s relation with Charley was anthropomorphic insofar as  we assume that the dog, not having a self, did not actually cognize himself as having  the taunting “sweet and forgiving look on his face” which Steinbeck cognized,  cathected and evaluated. Assumed mutuality and occupancy of social positions  were not absent but, on the contrary, were essential characteristics of Steinbeck’s  </page> <page sequence="6"> 196 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 12/No. 211 989  relations with Charley throughout the many weeks of the ongoing interaction  between the writer-traveler and his canine companion.  The objection may be made that, after all, dogs, although nonhuman, are living  beings of an order capable of producing signs within a process characterized by  unmistakable, even though rudimentary, mutuality. When mutuality is operative in  any degree, the other basic characteristics of interactional relations between per-  sons and others are argued, from this point of view, also to be operative, at least  minimally. Since, according to this argument, the dog is not completely nonhuman,  this case would not be considered by some to be conclusive.  Let us go on, then, to consider an instance exemplifying the characteristics of  relations of a person with an inanimate object and, again, at the anthropomorphic  level. I quote from Robert Manry’s popular book, Tinkerbelle (1965). In that book,  the author gave an account of the events during his 78-day trip alone across the  Atlantic Ocean in his 13 1/2 foot sailboat. This very small boat, the name of which  he chose as the title of the book, was the acknowledged heroine of the saga.  A salient characteristic of Manry’s relation with the boat, and also with the  elements is illustrated in the following passage. The ordeal which it records oc-  curred during a storm at night in mid-ocean. The wind was so strong that Manry  would have lowered the sails completely and dropped a sea-anchor to ride out the  storm but for the circumstance that he was falling unduly behind the schedule upon  which the successful completion of the trip was contingent.  Even with shortened canvas Tinkerbelle rushed headlong through the darkness at  about seven knots, her top speed. Her spray-soaked sails strained against their  fastenings as the relentless wind probed for some point of weakness that could be  forced to give way. Every now and then a foaming wave-cap slammed into her  starboard side, sending up a geyser of spume and sloshing rivers of salt water back  along her deck, half filling her self-bailing cockpit. Under each blow of the waves, she  lurched like a wounded doe, dipping to leeward with a tense, stomach-churning heave.  She told me through her tiller, by the way she wanted to point closer to the wind, that she  was unhappy. But I forced her to go on, full tilt. (1956, p. 1, Italics added).  We note in this passage that Manry cognized Tinkerbelle as straining toward their  mutual goal, but at the same time, as having expectations of his and of her own  behavior contrary to those which he had. The pressure on the tiller was the sign to  Manry that Tinkerbelle, whose role he was taking, “wanted” him to permit her to  point into the wind in order to win surcease from the stresses engendered by the  wind and waves from which she was direly “suffering.” He persisted, however, in  pursuing his course pointing toward England. What Steinbeck referred to as the  “daily war of wills” between himself and Charley had counterparts in occasional  struggles between man and boat. Analytically considered, the relation between  Manry and Tinkerbelle was anthropomorphic because the boat, of course, did not  actually cognize her own behavior in the ways in which Manry cognized it, nor in  any other way.‘  It is difficult to understand on what grounds anyone who views interpersonal  relations as being interactional would refuse to acknowledge that anthropomorphic  </page> <page sequence="7"> About Steaks Liking To Be Eaten 197  relations of the kinds illustrated above are likewise interactional, and would insist  that they are, rather, something else. And what might that something else possibly  be? It is reasonable to distinguish between full-blown interaction which occurs  when persons interact with each other overtly, that is face-to-face or otherwise back  and forth, and the.very many subtypes of such interaction. One crucially important  subtype consists of relationships between persons and the images that they may  have in mind of absent others, and that often have important consequences in their  subsequent behavior. Another important subtype consists of the different catego-  ries of relationships that people have with nonhuman objects, as when they anthro-  pomorphize them. All these are subtypes of interaction, and not of something else.  In all such cases role-taking occurs internally with presumed mutuality.  Is it conceivable that there can be corresponding presumed conversation when a  nonhuman object is not anthropomorphized? How can a person, it may be asked,  presume to engage in conversation back and forth with an inert object without  anthropomorphizing it? Is this not a contradiction in terms? Since relations be-  tween persons and nonanthropomorphized objects are immensely more common  than their relations with anthropomorphized objects, and since they are in general  very much more important in their lives, this question is crucial. Presumed conver-  sation with nonhuman objects does not necessarily presuppose that those objects are  deemed by the persons to possess human-like characteristics. Non-  anthropomorphized objects can become presumed interlocutors in certain ways as  well as anthropomorphized objects can be presumed to do so. If that happens, such  situations constitute interaction.  Consider the hypothetical case of a curious and reflective person who wends his  way alone along a somewhat unfamiliar street. Initially, he is preoccupied within  his inner self with events far removed from his here and now. For whatever reason,  his attention begins to focus upon an object within his immediate purview the like  of which he has not previously seen. He becomes very curious concerning what it is.  Lacking immediate access to some knowledgeable person from whom he might  inquire about it, he resolves to solve the problem entirely by himself. The problem  is: What is the object, in the sense of by what name is it called and what purpose  does it serve?  In order to solve that problem, he needs to do two discretely different sets of  things. After he has made his initial observations that sparked his curiosity, he  needs: (a) to conjure up all possible reasonable hypotheses concerning what the  object is in terms of its resemblance to other objects in various categories into  which it might fall, with which he is familiar; and (b) to test the relative tenability of  each of those hypotheses by marshalling relevant facts, by means of further obser-  vations of the situation. It is immaterial in what order he proceeds, that is, how he  mixes hypothesizing and observing.  These reflections prepare us for considering our third illustration, a relation  between a person and a nonhuman object that is not anthropomorphized. This  illustration is excerpted from How We Think, by John Dewey. In a chapter titled,  “The Analysis of a Complete Act of Thought,” Dewey recorded a series of three  illustrations of reflective thinking which, he reported, were almost verbatim ac-  </page> <page sequence="8"> 198 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 12/No. 2/1989  counts of their own personal experiences submitted as reports by students in one of  his courses. The following is one of them.  Projecting nearly horizontally from the upper deck of a ferryboat on which I daily  cross the river, is a long white pole, bearing a gilded ball at its tip. It suggested a  flagpole when I first saw it; its color, shape, and gilded ball agreed with this idea, and  these reasons seemed to justify me in this belief. But soon difficulties presented  themselves. The pole was nearly horizontal, an unusual position for a flagpole; in the  next place, there was no pulley, ring or cord by which to attach a flag; finally, there  were elsewhere two vertical staffs from which flags were occasionally flown. It seemed  probable that the pole was not there for flag-flying. I then tried to imagine all possible  purposes of such a pole, and to consider for which of these it was best suited: (a)  possibly it was an ornament. But as all the ferryboats and even tugboats carried like  poles, this hypothesis was rejected; (b) possibly it was the terminal of a wireless  telegraph. (The event reported occurred before the era of radio communication.) But  the same considerations made this improbable. Besides, the more natural place for  such a terminal would be the highest part of the boat, on top of the pilot house; (c) its  purpose might be to point out the direction in which the boat was moving. In support  of this conclusion, I discovered that the pole was lower than the pilot house, so that the  steersman could easily see it. Moreover, the tip was enough higher than the base, so  that from the pilots position it must appear to project far out in front of the boat.  Moreover, the pilot being near the front of the boat, he would need some such guide  as to its direction. Tugboats would also need poles for such a purpose. This hypothesis  was so much more probable than the others that I accepted it. I formed the conclusion  that the pole was set up for the purpose of showing the pilot the direction in which the  boat pointed, to enable him to steer correctly (1910, pp. 69-70).  I take for granted that the actual experience of this particular student was not as  orderly as he set forth in his class-report. The essence of the matter, however, was  that the student asked himself, in very much like the manner indicated above, to  provide himself out of his fund of past experience, with all reasonable alternative  hypotheses regarding how the pole might be designated, and about what different  purposes it might serve. Although it is not ordinarily stated this way, it would not be  incorrect to go on and say that he asked the pole and pertinent environing objects to  provide the data by means of which he could conclude that the pole indicated to the  pilot the direction in which the ferryboat was heading.  Dewey analyzed what occurred in terms of formal logic. Our interest, however,  is in the events as constituting a social process. It was a social process because two  interacting actors were involved: the student and the pole, in the context of the  ferryboat in the harbor, who (and which) related to each other, analytically  considered, substantially no differently than if they had been two persons.  My final illustration of relations between persons and nonhuman objects, ex-  cerpted from the chapter on “The Self” in Mead’s Mind, Self and Society, is a  description and analysis of the relations between an engineer and the terrain on  which he plans to construct a bridge. Insofar as his illustration is of non-  anthropomorphic relations, Mead went on to explain, in a telling manner, how this  category of relations differs from those in which persons presume the object to be  human-like.  </page> <page sequence="9"> About Steaks Liking To Be Eaten 199  An engineer who is constructing a bridge is talking to nature in the same sense that we  talk to an engineer. There are stresses and strains there which he meets, and nature  comes back with other responses that have to be met in another way. In his thinking he  is taking the attitude of physical things. He is talking to nature and nature is replying to  him. Nature is intelligent in the sense that there are certain responses of nature toward  our action whibh we can present and which we can reply to ,  and which become different  when we have reached a point at which we can cooperate with nature.  Such is the development of modern science out of what we term magic. Magic is just  this same response, but with the further assumption that physical things do think and  act as we do. It is preserved in the attitude which we have toward an offending object  or the trustworthy object upon which we depend. We all carry about a certain amount  of this sort of magic. We avoid something because we feel it is in some way dangerous;  we all respect certain omens to which we pay some attention. We keep up some social  response to nature about us, even though we do not allow this to affect us in important  decisions. These are attitudes which perhaps we normally cover up, but which are  revealed to us in numerous situations. Insofar as we are rational, as we reason and  think, we are taking a social attitude toward the world about us, critically in the case of  science, uncritically in the case of magic (1934, pp. 185-186 italics added).  1 know of no more explicit statement that the process which operates in the  relations of persons with the physical world-both in its totality and in its separate  segments, and both in its natural conditions and as transformed by man-is a social  process. In Mead’s view, it is essentially the same process of interaction, with  essentially the same characteristics, as are found in the relations between man and  his fellows, except that it occurs internally with a presumption of mutuality on the  part of the person functioning as a social self.s The self under these circumstances  may be considered to be a process of intra-action occurring in the person in the  course of which he takes the roles of objects (that is, he thinks about them),  recognizing the necessities that they impose upon his conduct and, also, the options  that they make available to him.  In all four illustrations, the persons had prolonged and in varying degrees  exclusive relations with the nonhuman objects. What of relations that are cursory,  superficial, and in which the objects are in the background? In them, of course, no  such readily discriminable interaction occurs. The counterpoint must be made,  however, that in relations of persons with human objects that are cursory, superfi-  cial, or in which those human objects are in the background, discriminable mutu-  ality and the other characteristics of interaction also are not actively operative. In  general, meaningfully interactional relations with human objects are much more  nearly central and prevail in the lives of people over meaningfully interactional  relations with nonhuman objects. As a further general condition, relations with  human objects and with nonhuman objects are usually combined and interrelated.  IV  In the preceding section, I explained in more or less commonsense terms, and with  the use of illustrations, how relations of persons with nonhuman objects may be  viewed as. being interactional in nature irrespective of whether or not anthro-  pomorphization is involved. In this section I bring together, amplify and formulate  </page> <page sequence="10"> 200 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 12/No. 2/1989  systematically the fundamental elements in the symbolic interactionist conceptual-  ization of the matter. Parsons would have considered such an analysis as constitut-  ing a theoretical statement.  Since symbolic interactionists hold a unitary view of the nature of object relations  and do not differentiate between the fundamentals of the nature of relations  between persons and each other on the one hand and between persons and  nonhuman objects on the other, it is necessary to present their conceptualization of  the nature of object relations in general, and ' to  specify how these two major  categories of such relations do differ from each other. The following three proposi-  tions set forth summarily the important conditions which characterize the relations  of persons with objects of all kinds:  1. Signs of three kinds-language signs, post-language signs and presentational  signs--constitute the media by means of which persons become engaged in interac-  tion with all kinds of objects.  2. Overt role-taking is the process in the course of which the mutual exchange  of signs-most importantly of language signs-brings persons into interaction with  each other.  3 .  (a) Internalized role-taking is the process in the course of which a person,  considered from his own perspective, interacts with others with whom he is not at  the time actually communicating. He does so subliminally, again most importantly  by means of language signs (Vygodsky 1962).  (b) Internalized role-taking is also the process in the course of which a person,  once more considered from his own perspective, interacts with nonhuman objects.  He does so subliminally by means of one or another of the three kinds of signs,  most importantly by means of post-language and presentational signs.  Some of the terms in the foregoing summary of the conditions of interaction  require definition that will be provided in the course of the amplification of these  propositions. To understand provisionally what is meant by the neologism-not of  the writer's coinage-post-language sign, think of it as the kind of indication which  each of the four persons who was cited in the above illustrations presumed a  particular anthropomorphized or nonanthropomorphized object to be directing to  him and to which he responded as he did in the course of the events in which he and  the object were mutually involved.  It is a basic premise of symbolic interactionist thinking that signs constitute the  ever-present substantive content of all interaction. They are in that manner obtru-  sive and their nature, therefore, is considered first. It is self-evident that inter-  nalized role-taking in both forms that are indicated in the two parts of the third  proposition above (internalization of others and internalization of nonhuman ob-  jects) is derivative from the elemental form of role-taking that occurs in the course  of overt inter-personal interaction. The discussion of the two forms of internalized  role-taking, accordingly, follows the discussion of overt role-taking. The primacy  over the other of either one of these two forms of internalized role-taking, how-  ever, is problematical; that is, it is a matter which is subject to conflicting views. In  </page> <page sequence="11"> About Steaks Liking To Be Eaten 201  setting their order, I follow Mead who very early in his work wrote that “experi-  ence in its original form became reflective in the recognition of selves, and only  gradually wa5 there differentiated a reflective experience of things which are purely  physical” (1910, p. 180). Much later, he wrote in the same vein that “all objects are  at first social objects, . . . and the physical object is but an abstraction from the  social object” (1938; pp. 429-430). Mead indicated that he meant by this that the  process that occurs in the course of the responses of persons to the physical  properties of objects is the same kind of process that occurs in their responses to  each other. He viewed the kinesthetic experience of physical objects as occurring in  the context of an elemental counterpart of the interpersonal role-taking process  (Joas 1985, p. 153). The significant experience by persons of physical objects  initially is kinesthetic; following that it becomes visual and, finally, generally  sensate. Such experience becomes infused in the course of the social process with  all manner of symbolic themes and nuances taken over from the realms of personal  and interpersonal experiences, such as the different kinds described in the four  foregoing illustrations.6  Signs in Object Relations  The involvement of symbolic interactionists as social psychologists in the study of  interaction prior to this decade has been concentrated very heavily on the theory  and on the empirical study of role-taking and of attitudes almost to the virtual  exclusion of their attention from the manner in which signs as such, figure in  interaction (see Duncan, 1968 and 1969). Without explicit recognition of the nature  of signs, in their differentiated types, it is impossible to approach full understanding  of the nature of the interaction of persons with nonhuman objects. This is apart  from the corresponding importance of signs in the analysis of interpersonal behav-  ior. The delineation of the nature and scope of signs which follows in this sub-  section, insofar as it goes beyond the limits of what Mead explicitly wrote or clearly  implied, is based on the formulation of semiotics, the theory and science of signs,  most notably by Charles W. Morris and by Suzanne K. Langer.  It was more common in the past than it is currently to use the word symbol as a  generic term, as Mead did generally. The word sign, however, has come to displace  it in that respect in increasing degree, while the word symbol has been given  narrower and more restricted denotations which I do not consider in this analysis.  When referring explicitly to formulations by Mead and others who, like him, used  the term symbol generically, I refrain from departing from their usage. I attempt  otherwise to follow, insofar as possible, the prevailing practice in technical discus-  sions in this area.  Signs, in general, are real and imaginary objects, or activities of such objects,  that direct attention or behavior either to other objects or to themselves. Signs that  direct attention or behavior to other objects are designated in this analysis as  referential or representational signs. Referential signs fall into two closely interre-  lated sub-categories: language signs and post-language signs. I follow Langer in  designating signs that direct attention to themselves as presentational signs. John  Dewey referred to signs of this type as expressive signs (1934, pp. 82-83), and other  </page> <page sequence="12"> 202 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 12/No. 2/1989  writers have used still other designations such as autonomous or sovereign signs  (Simmel 1911 p. 267) and in the context of art as aesthetic signs (Panofsky 1955;  p. 11).  Language Signs  Language signs, consisting of words, singly or in combination with each other  are, of course, the most common and the most important of all types of signs, the  overt and subliminal use of which are pre-requisite, directly or indirectly, to every  other specifically human activity. Langer considered that language signs have three  distinctive characteristics that mark them off from both of the other two types of  signs. First, every language has a vocabulary, that is a fund of words, its units of  different kinds, which have relatively fixed meanings; and it has sets of rules, called  its syntax, governing the modification and the ordering of words for the develop-  ment of more complex meanings than those of the individual words themselves.  Second, all words in any given language have equivalent words, or combinations of  words, which constitute their definitions and which make dictionaries possible; and  different languages have different words, or combinations of words, with virtually  the same meanings as each other, making a different kind of dictionary possible,  and permitting the translation of the content of any true language into any other  true language of equal scope. Third, language permits the expression of gener-  alities. A true language is one having all three of these characteristics. Langer  referred to the use of language as discourse, and she referred to the process in the  course of which language is used as the discursive mode (1942, p. 94).  Post-Language Signs  It is of the very nature of referential signs that they are reversible, that is  whatever refers to something else can be referred to in turn by that something else  (Whitehead 1927, pp. 10-13). The word house, for example, refers to an object, or  more specifically to a kind of structure, used for the family or for the family-like  mode of living. Inversely, a kind of structure used for the family or for the family-  like mode of living refers to the word house, or, as we ordinarily are inclined to say,  is called a house. Our four earlier illustrations indicated, moreover, how physical  objects “tell us” more about themselves than their names and the uses to which  they are put. They may also become the central subjects of lengthy dramas or the  focus of indefinitely extended objective investigations. They “tell us” whatever we  imagine about them or are able to learn from them about themselves. Observation  and experimentation in the natural sciences entails the decipherment, i.e., the  meticulous examination and interpretation, of objects in nature as post-language  signs.  Morris who designated this type of sign as post-language sign, stated that,  “speech, when attained, itself makes possible a vast expansion of sign process: it  may give to preceived objects a signification first attained by language” (1946, p.  196). In another place he wrote, “A post-language sign is a sign which is not a  language sign, but which requires the operation of language for its signification. An  example is the reader’s perception of a star, that is the interpretation of spot of light  as a vast glowing body far away; this perception results from the fact that one has  </page> <page sequence="13"> About Steaks Liking To Be €aten 203  heard or read about astronomical theories developed in Western society” (1957, p.  181). Morris might just as well have used as his example any other physical object  in nature or  any artifact that has a name, or about which anything at all might be  thought or said that betokens its meaning. It was because of Morris’s view that  post-language signs have their base in language that he designated them as he did.7  Although post-language signs are closely involved with language, they themselves  have none of the.t hree characteristics of language specified by Langer.  Post-language signs may be personal, as in the case of Manry’s Tinkerbelle.  Manry’s perceptions of the boat and his sentiments toward it could not be shared by  any others until he verbalized those perceptions and sentiments, that is to say until  he interpreted those post-language signs verbally as by writing the book. Con-  trastingly, post-language signs may be interpersonal, as in the case of the North Star  which has an identical denotation to a large share of the population living in the  northern hemisphere who have awareness of it. The universally familiar and  everyday elements in our terrestrial environment constitute even clearer examples  of interpersonal post-language signs. It is the verbalized interpretants of such  interpersonal post-language signs, of course, that are shared and are interpersonal  (Morris 1946, pp. 196-198).  Presentational Signs  Presentational signs differ from post-language signs in two respects. First, they  are not limited to physical objects and to activities of such objects: They are very  prominent also as forms of activities of persons, such as when they constitute the  media in the fine arts of music and dancing and in ritual forms of religious  expression. Parsons referred to objects, some of which, as signs, are presentational  as cultural objects. Second, insofar as they are presentational, they have no equiva-  lent, that is to say no synonymous language signs. Only after their essential nature  in presentational terms has at least been begun to  be grasped can they be talked  about meaningfully and their character suggested, as is done in so-called program  notes prepared for concerts and in catalogues prepared for art exhibits. What is said  about them does not specify their intrinsic character as presentational signs, such as  occurs in the case of post-language signs (Langer 1942, pp. 79-102).  Consider two examples of presentational signs. A small sailboat may be focused  upon in terms of the circumstances under which it was built, who ever sailed it,  what experiences they had in it, and similar referential considerations, such as  mainly preoccupied Manry in the case of Tinkerbelle as a complex of post-language  signs. The very same sailboat, however, might be perceived by a painter to be an  aesthetically delightful structural pattern or form consisting of lines, masses, colors,  textures and lights and shadows fit to be rendered two-dimensionally on canvas. If  he is inclined to abstract expressionism, what he experiences as it comes to be  embodied in his work will have very little or no verisimilitude to the utilitarian  object which inspired the idea which he expressed aesthetically. The boat in the  painting as a work of art, although it is almost invariably given a name and can  always be talked about, such as by calling attention to its component aesthetic  features, has no verbal counterpart whatsoever in the sense that a boat as a post-  language sign has (Simmel 1911, pp. 267-275).  </page> <page sequence="14"> 204 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 12/No. 2/1989  My second illustration of presentational signs shows how language, although  itself representational, may be used presentationally, as happens regularly in liter-  ary prose, in drama, and most intensively in poetry. The book of Exodus presents  an account of a theophany, that of God appearing to Moses at the foot of Mount  Sinai, whither Moses had gone while tending the,sheep of his father-in-law Jethro.  Moses was charged by God, speaking from a burning bush, which was not being  consumed, to return to Egypt whence he had previously fled, and to persuade the  children of Israel to prepare to leave the country of their oppression and to return  to the land many times before promised to their ancestors, the land of Canaan.  Knowing that during the generations of their bondage, the Hebrews had lost their  knowledge of God and of his repeated promise to the patriarchs, Moses initiated  the following colloquy with God:  Behold when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of  your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? What  shall I say unto them? And God said to Moses, I AM THAT I AM: and he said, Thou  shalt say unto the children of Israel, I AM hath sent me unto you (Book of Exodus,  Chapter 3, Verses 13-14).  According to the outset of the account, God had introduced himself to Moses  representationally as “the God of thy fathers, the God of Abraham, the God of  Isaac, and the God of Jacob.” But Moses was charged not to refer to Him thus, nor  as the Lord of Hosts, nor as the Almighty, nor in any other representational form.  He was Z AM THAT Z AM or, more simply, Z AM, without further external  designation. Both the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament abound in like terse,  explicitly presentational signs. They have much greater immediacy and intensity in  appropriate contexts than do representational expressions. A corresponding exam-  ple in the secular realm is Gertrude Stein’s often-quoted dictum, “A rose is a rose,  is a rose.” Only as a presentational assertion does this statement make sense. While  we have been selecting stripped-down examples of the literary use of such signs, the  presentational mode is the pervasive character of literature as art. By means of the  creative skill of writers, in the manner in which they structure what they compose,  their representational signs become assimilated into an over-all presentational  effect .’  Works composed of presentational signs, such as works of art, consist in varying  degrees of prominence of three intrinsically different components. These three  components constitute the major subject matter of analysis and criticism of art  work. The first component is representativeness of elements of one or another  aspect of actual or imagined experience. It is notably prominent in novels and in  classical sculpture. Whether or not representativeness is present at all in music as  such (that is, when it is not fused with other media) remains a matter of debate. It is  a truism that music does not represent anything else in words. Composers widely  report, however, having been moved to create particular works under the inspira-  tion of specific landscapes or events in the same way as painters depend for  inspiration upon particular physical settings or objects. Beethoven’s Sixth Sympho-  ny, The Pastoral Symphony, is experienced as imagery suggestive of country  </page> <page sequence="15"> About Steaks Liking To Be Eaten 205  landscapes enlivened by suggestions of the singing of birds and so forth. The title  that Beethoven gave it suggests that this was what he intended.  To speak of the representative component in presentational works is not as  contradictory as initially appears, insofar as in truly competent presentational  works the representative component becomes transmuted into something other  than what it presumes to represent. Virginia Woolf was reported to have quipped,  “Art is not a copy of the real world. One of the damn things is enough” (Goodman  1968, p. 3). Expressing himself less cynically, Simmel wrote, “To be sure, the work  of art draws its content from reality; but from visions of reality, it builds a sovereign  realm” (1911, p. 267).  The second component is expressiveness of feeling or emotion. The major  portion of the enjoyment of most of Beethoven’s compositions for most listeners,  for example, resides, in the excitement which they engender by means of their  overwhelming dramatic quality, as is especially evident in his Ninth Symphony.  Mozart’s compositions tend to induce the listeners to feel uplifted. Musical scores  are selected or are composed for movies to emphasize the state of feeling consid-  ered to be appropriate in respect to what is shown on the screen, be it marching  soldiers, battles, or love scenes. The background music played in dining rooms is  intended to be soothing and not unduly distracting.  The third component which it is possible to discriminate is struclure or form. No  clearer illustration in the musical world is possible than the work of Bach, which is  extraordinarily formal. I asked a young relative who is studying musical theory to  read and comment on Leonard B. Meyer’s Emotion and Meaning in Music (1956)  as it relates to his interest in Bach. The content of that book is in a symbolic  interactionist framework, with music considered to be a system of signs that are  communicated by the composer to performers, and through them, to audiences  who internally take the role of either the composer or the performers. Emotion is  hypothesized to be generated by expectations of development that are, or are not,  fulfilled. The written comments were:  Part of my training involves recognizing scalar degrees by distinguishing them by  scalar functions. Some degrees tend upward to  the tonic, some downward to the  tonic, an octave lower. Thus a great deal of musical emotion involves tension  built by tending toward the tonic in either direction, and then missing i t .  Being  able to  miss it smoothly and without breaking the continuity of the phrase is one  of the most difficult in musical composition . . . Last week a group of us listened  to a collection of Bach keyboard works. I listened for the scalar functions of the  notes. It was seeing into another level of the music, not only sensing the tension  emotionally, but intellectually seeing it built and fall through the structure of the  music while listening to it. It is almost like seeing the score while you hear the  notes (Personal communication).  Versification with its symmetries in accentuation constitute a large portion of the  form which distinguishes poetry from prose. Structure in poetry has some detect-  able resemblance to structure in music. In some degree persons reading poetry  listen to it as they would to music, that is, with relatively less marked ideological  involvement (Sheppard 1987, pp. 4-55).  </page> <page sequence="16"> 206 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 12/No. 2/1989  The Use of Signs in Overt Role-Taking  Social interaction like every other activity has two inseparable, but nevertheless  analytically distinguishable, aspects: content and process. The content of social  interaction in its most general nature consists of the three different kinds of signs  the principal substantive characteristics of which I considered in the preceding sub-  section. The primary social process is overt role-taking. A derivative social process  is internalized role-taking. The latter is the more important of the two to us in this  analysis in view of our special interest in interaction with nonhuman objects, that in  the course of taking their roles-always internally-we experience as signs of one  or another of the three kinds.  Because my discussion of signs in the foregoing sub-section was limited to the  consideration of their nature as content, I refrained from designating them as  significant symbols which I would have done otherwise commencing with our  discussion of language signs. To have considered them as significant symbols before  this would have confused the discussion. Mead wrote that “gestures become  significant when they implicitly arouse, in the individuals making them the same  responses as they explicitly arouse or are supposed to arouse, in other individuals”  (1934: 41). In designating them to be significant in this manner, Mead was directing  attention to their operational or processual function, which was the character of his  principal interest in this general kind of sign. Language, post-language and presen-  tational signs, considered from the standpoint of how they function, are all signifi-  cant symbols, having common signification for their producers and their interpret-  ers (Mead 1922, pp. 157-163).  Mead spoke of a person taking the role of the other as equivalent to his having the  attitude of the other and, metaphorically, as his being the other while, at the same  time, having an awareness of his own sign indications and of his own reponses to  them. Insofar as the other, in responding, concomitantly takes that person’s role in  the same kind of way, this process goes back and forth between the two persons  dialectically. Commenting on the nature of role-taking, Morris wrote: “For Mead,  it is characteristic of the human being that he can react to his own (or to some of  his) actions as other human beings will react. He tells a joke and laughs at it; he  gives the clerk a ten-dollar bill and expects a certain amount of change in return; he  phones a friend for an appointment and expects to meet him at a certain time and  place. ”’  Overt role-taking may be said to occur in those situations in which significant  symbols are exchanged back and forth between a person and one or more others  with whom he is involved directly in communication. The back and forth or two-  directional nature of the communication is of the essence in overt role-taking. The  conditions which define internalized role-taking and differentiate it from overt role-  taking will be considered in the next sub-section.  In the course of my thumb-nail sketch of Parsons’ theory of personality in Section  11, I noted his view that persons enact or perform roles in encompassing social  systems generally in compliance with prevailing norms, which they experience as  expectations. Much less commonly they deviate from those norms. For Parsons,  role enacting constitutes the basic model of learning, with similar significant and  </page> <page sequence="17"> About Steaks Liking To Be Eaten 207  far-reaching further ramifications in personal and social development. Much criti-  cism has been directed at Parsons’ model from different points of view, with  consensus among many critics that it has the fault explicitly betokened in the title of  Dennis H. Wrong’s (1961 ; also Parsons 1962) article, “The Oversocialized Concep-  tion of Man.” Wrong’s criticism of Parsons was made from the psychoanalytic point  of view. Symbolic interactionsists similarly perceive Parsons as improperly over-  emphasizing persons’ tendencies to conform, in contrast to their own view of  persons as “searching and seeking” and as being more nearly tentative in their  approaches and responses to others (Cooley 1918, pp. 3-18). Ralph Turner writes  critically:  The idea of role-taking shifts emphasis away from the simple process of enacting a  prescribed role to devising a performance on the basis of an imputed other-role. The  actor is not an occupant of a position for which there is a neat set of rules-a culture or  a set of norms-but a person who must act in the perspective supplied in part by his  relationship to others whose actions reflect roles that he must identify. Since the role  of alter can only be inferred rather than directly known by ego, testing the inferences  about the role of alter is a continuing element in interaction. Hence the tentative  character of the individual’s own role definitions is never wholly suspended (1962,  p. 23).  Turner went on to comment that in the person’s attempt to make his or the other’s  role explicit, he is engaged as much in role-making as he is in role-taking. The  characteristics of role-taking or role-making that Turner described might equally  well have been designated and emphasized by him as characteristic of persons as  ,selves.  Which of the three kinds of signs that figure in interaction generally serve as  media in overt role-taking? Language signs clearly do constitute one of these  because, as significant symbols, “they implicitly arouse in the individuals making  them (as gestures) the same responses as they explicitly arouse, or are supposed to  arouse in other individuals.” This is characteristic of what occurs in overt role-  taking as a process. In other words, language is one kind of sign-content which is  used in the course of overt role-taking.  How about post-language signs? It might be assumed that since post-language  signs are the inverse of language signs that they also can and do constitute a  medium in the course of the process of overt role-taking. Such an assumption,  however, is totally incorrect. That post-language signs cannot serve as a medium in  the course of overt role-taking is the couterpart of the fact that the physical objects  with which persons interact by means of the medium of such signs cannot take the  roles of the persons. The role-taking that occurs from the perspective of the persons  when they interact with nonhuman objects is other than fully mutual. It is true that  the interpretants of post-language signs are usually language signs. It is the persons  and not the physical objects, however, who make the verbal interpretations of the  physical characteristics of the perceived objects and of their activities. The fact, for  example, that Steinbeck and Manry wrote books about their interactions with  nonhuman objects, expressing their interpretations of the objects with which they  </page> <page sequence="18"> 208 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 12/No. 2/1989  were involved as sign vehicles, does not imply that earlier, when those objects were  functioning as post-language signs, overt role-taking back and forth was occurring  between those writers and the objects. It, of course, was not.  Overt role-taking is not the major context in which the third kind of signs,  presentational signs, serve as a medium of communication back and forth between  and among persons. Unlike post-language signs, however, they are not totally  precluded by their very nature from such use. Many forms of art depend for their  execution upon overt mutual role-taking, with exchange of presentational signs, as  significant symbols, between and among performers. In the theater, in which  language is used presentationally, this is self-evident. Performers in the mixed arts  of opera and dancing make significant gestures to each other by means of presenta-  tional signs in a similarly patterned progress of themes, for the enjoyment of their  audiences. The same kind of interaction also occurs among different sections of  choirs and orchestral groups. Their compositions call for their addressing passages  to each other and for their responding in kind. In chamber music, the performers  become similarly involved with each other in like modes of musical colloquies.“’  Performers and audiences, however, do not take each others’ roles overtly. Their  interaction with each other is by that type of role-taking the broad aspects of which  I consider next.  Internalized Role-Taking and the Use of Signs  A concomitant of the capacity of persons to take each others’ roles overtly is their  capacity to take the roles of absent or unresponsive others internally. Mead called  the latter type of role-taking the “importation of the social process within the  conduct of the individual organism.” In order to carry on such internalized role-  taking according to Mead a person must have within himself the stimuli which call  out in himself the responses that others call out in him.  How much like overt role-taking is it possible for internalized role-taking to be?  The answer to this question is that it can approach being identical with it. This is  possible to the degree that a person taking the role of another internally has within  himself the kind of stimuli to which Mead referred, that is to the degree that he can  “have the attitude of the other” or that he “can be the other” in the same way as  when he and the other are actually taking each other’s roles overtly.  How much unlike overt role-taking is it possible for internalized role-taking to  be? The answer to this question is that it can be vastly unlike it. Internalized role-  taking can be vastly different partly because of the immensely greater number of  objects, and more importantly of the immensely greater number of kinds of  objects, of which it is possible for anyone to take the role internally than it is  possible for him to do it overtly. Since internalized role-taking need not be  consensual and since it need not be tested against reality, a vastly wider range of  stimuli that the person conjures up from memory and from imagination can be  brought into the process.  A person can take the roles of others to whom he does not have direct access, of  others who are removed long distances, who are no longer alive, who never were  and who never could be. More important to us, he can take the roles of rocks,  </page> <page sequence="19"> About Steaks Liking To Be Eaten 209  plants and animals, of rivers, lakes and seas, of mountains and valleys, of winds and  celestial bodies, of artifacts and of abstract powers imminent in the universe or  transcendental to it; in short, of any object that can serve as a sign to him. Indeed,  he may even take the role of a steak, Parsons notwithstanding.  A person can take the roles also of cultural objects. He may sit in the den of his  home, for example, and listen to a symphony performance that is being broadcast  over the radio, of which he knows the name of neither the composer nor of the  orchestra playing it. Following that, he may listen to arguments in a debate, and  consider the merits of the propositions of the opposing speakers, who may be  similarly anonymous. In both of those cases, he would be said, in terms of our  technical terminology, to be taking the roles of cultural objects.  When a person takes the role internally of a non-present actual other of his  acquaintance, he interacts by means of the same sign media as he uses when the two  are overtly taking each other’s roles, those being language signs and, very much less  commonly, presentational signs. When a person takes the role internally of physical  objects, those objects serve either as post-language signs or as presentational signs,  depending on whether the objects, as signs, are referential or non-referential. And  when he takes the role internally of cultural objects, the objects function either as  language signs or as presentational signs.  The process of internalized role-taking is involved in the occurrence of mystic  experiences (Morris 1957, pp. 179-187). It is, also, of the stuff of dreams and of  hallucinations. It is, further, that which permits artists, and the rest of us in  diminished degree and in more diffuse manner, to exercise creative skills.  It appears from the foregoing analysis of the nature of internalized role-taking  that persons individually and in social groups have the potentiality to soar in their  thinking to the furthermost horizons. When contained within restraints of realistic  possibilities, such activity carried on seriously provides one of the necessary condi-  tions for achieving change at all levels, with subsequent possibly enhanced adapta-  tion. Many solid realities have had their origin in “impossible” dreams. At the  extreme, on the negative side, so have many tragedies.  Symbolic interactionists generally do not differentiate as sharply as I have  between overt role-taking and internalized role-taking. Mead himself sometimes  did not do so, as when he asserted that “physical things are objects implicated in  the social act, whose role we can take etc.,” rather than asserting as he might have,  “whose role we can take infernally.” The reason for not differentiating is that when  two or more persons are engaged in conversation, and thereby taking each other’s  roles overtly, the one or ones who are not actively communicating at any given  time, are likely, also, to be thinking over what has been said and what might be  said, and thereby taking each other’s roles internally. Ralph Turner, as indicated  above, called attention to how this occurs also in the experience of the speaker.  Internalized role-taking, thus, goes hand-in-hand with overt role-taking. Unless I  differentiate as sharply as I do in the context of this analysis, however, it might not  be as clear as is necessary that internalized role-taking is the specific and sole sub-  process in the course of which persons interact with nonhuman objects. Overt role-  taking rarely occurs without some admixture of internalized role-taking; inter-  </page> <page sequence="20"> 210 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 12/No. 2/1989  nalized role-taking, on the other hand, very rarely occurs otherwise with even the  slightest admixture of overt role-taking.  The role-taking process considered in both of its forms together is the general  context in which, in the view of symbolic interactionists, all interaction occurs. It is  the most comprehensive, the most basic, and the most consequential in all of  Mead’s repertory of concepts. First, it constitutes the symbolic interactionist’s  model of the general learning process, in which all new attitudes and habits are  acquired, and old ones strengthened, by-passed, weakened or erased. Secondly, it  lies at the basis of mutuality in which persons enacting differentiated roles articu-  late their behavior with each other and develop consensus, and in which persons  enacting joint roles tend to become mQre alike in their attitudes. Persons involved  in conflict with each other learn by means of role-taking to co-ordinate their  behavior in relation to each other in the different kinds of ways in which they do so.  Thirdly, in taking the roles of others, and specifically in perceiving reflectively how  those others take his role, the person learns who he is and, thereby over time, he  becomes an autonomous self to himself and to others. Fourthly, in taking the roles  of others, and particularly of significant others who express attitudes which explic-  itly or implicitly denote right or wrong and good or bad, persons tend over time to  internalize and generalize those attitudes, thereby developing what Mead called the  generalized other, more commonly known as conscience. Finally, taking the roles of  others, in the course of thought processes, is the matrix in which mind as a  functioning operation develops.  ACKNOWLEDGMENT  I express my gratitude to my long-time friend and colleague Edward Gross but for  whose continuing encouragement this article would not have come to fruition.  NOTES  1. All other than human objects are dichotomized into the subcategories of physical  objects and cultural objects. Cultural objects are activities of persons, or products of their  activities, such as ideas, beliefs, value orientations, propositions, laws, novels, plays, cele-  brations and other such relatively autonomous objects, having the form of sign complexes.  2. Parsons used the terms social object and nonsocial object where I use the terms human  object and nonhuman object. By his very use of the designation “nonsocial object,” Parsons  underscored strongly his view that the nature of relations of persons with them is noninterac-  tional. The major theme in my analysis is that relations with all kinds of objects are  interactional. This signifies that in my view there can be no nonsocial objects. I believe that  the confusion that would result from my possibly using both of these intrinsically conflicting  terminologies alternately, in considering the two positions, is best avoided, without loss of  any kind, by my using my own basic terms throughout the major portion of the discussion,  beginning with my initial presentation here of Parsons’ position.  3. After the psychologist Henry A. Murray gave Freud a copy of Moby Dick, Murray  reported very much later (N.Y. Times June 24, 1988), “that the father of psychoanalysis  promptly proclaimed that the whale was a father image whom he felt driven to destroy.”  </page> <page sequence="21"> About Steaks Liking To Be Eaten 21 1  Freud’s writing abound with examples of all kinds of nonhuman objects serving similarly as  surrogates for persons and being interacted with accordingly.  4. Should the reader be inclined to discount considerably the two foregoing accounts,  and to regard both Steinbeck’s and Manry’s reports to reflect a literary and journalistic  striving for dramatic effect, his attention is directed to the very competent technical report  by R. R. Grinker and J. P. Spiegel, which described the identifications and loyalties of Air  Force combat teams during World War I1 in respect to their planes.  It is an interesting fact that, although the members of the combat crews are  thrown together only by chance, they rapidly become united to each other by  the strongest bonds while in combat . . . The men and their planes become  identified with each other with an intensity that in civil life is found only within  the family circle. Crew members habitually refer to each other as “my pilot,”  “my bombardier,” “my gunner” and so on, and their feeling for their plane is  equally strong, since its strength and reliability are as important as those of any  human member of the crew (1945, p. 22; italics added).  If it were true that such experiences as recounted by Steinbeck and by Manry were always  only literary or journalistic inventions, then the problem for analysis would become: How  are such literary and journalistic accounts, as cultural objects having widespread popular  appeal, explainable in social psychological terms?  5. The discussion and illustrations in this section are all of interaction with physical  objects as signs. If space permitted, it would be just as feasible to show that interaction, as  viewed by symbolic interactionists, occurs in a comparable manner in relations with cultural  objects, in all their variety as autonomous activities of persons, also as signs. Parsons held a  different view of this matter, namely that not only does the nature of relations of persons  with physical objects differ from the nature of interpersonal relations, but also in some  respects from the nature of their relations with cultural objects.  6. I have taken for granted as sound, and as a matter to which I have nothing more to  add, the writing of those sociologists who have not parted far from the limits of Mead’s  original formulation of the nature of relations of persons with physical objects, particularly  as set forth in his Philosophy of the Act (1938). That treatise considers the matter largely, as  the title of the book suggests, at the philosophical level, epistemologically and meta-  physically, albeit within a social psychological framework. I refer here particularly to Hugh  Dalziel Duncan’s chapters V-VIII in his Communication and the Social Order (1962) and to  E. Doyle McCarthy’s much more recent article on “Toward a Sociology of the Physical  World: George Herbert Mead on Physical Objects” (1984). What these writers do little  more than mention, and what I expand throughout this discussion is how relations with  objects in the physical world are social relations. I present them as being so during the course  of social acts in terms of the interpretation of such objects as signs within the context of the  process of internalized role-taking. It is readily apparent that this content and this process  encompass not only physical objects but also, beyond them, also as signs, all activities of  persons and of things which figure in internalized role-taking that, following Parsons, I  designate as cultural objects. On this basis I give the matter a very much more extended  application than have others heretofore. I consider that in doing so I do not depart at all  from the basic principles which Mead set forth.  7. A more specific reason for Morris naming them thus was that in his full treatment of  the matter he indicated a level of signs prior to language-signs which do not require language  </page> <page sequence="22"> 212 SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Vol. 12/No. 2/1989  for their signification. These he called pre-language signs. Illustrative of such signs at the  animal level are dogs conditioned to salivate as in Pavlov’s experiments. An example at the  human level is a sleeping person casting off blankets and starting out of bed at the ringing of  an alarm-clock prior to his reflecting about why the alarm was set and what he needs to do. I  do not consider this type of sign here because it does not figure in interaction. To Morris,  pre-language signs, language signs and post-language’signsc onstitute a progressive, symmet-  rical and comprehensive trilogy spanning, as he viewed the matter, the entire range of signs.  Morris held that Langer’s separate category of presentational signs constituted a form of  iconic signs, referential in nature and, accordingly, to be comprehended within the category  of post-language signs. I consider that Morris’s lumping together such essentially dissimilar  phenomena was unwarranted insofar as it blurs some of the most significant areas of human  experience and, insofar as accepted, renders their proper analysis and understanding imposs-  ible.  8. Much more elemental presentational signs than the illustrations cited from the  spheres of art and religion are presentational phenomena experienced as sense perceptions  in tasting and smelling. No one as much as tries to denote the taste of sugar or salt. In a  column on “Wine Talk” in the New York Times of May 4, 1988, Frank J. Prial wrote both  amusingly and wisely of the impossibility of making truly clear by means of language the  precise nature of the taste of wine. He showed how even the most articulate connoisseurs  talk circularly around the topic. They usually resort to references to the components, that is  to how bouquets resemble the aroma of blossoms or the taste of specified fruits and nuts,  making them out, accordingly, to constitute another category of referential objects. Actu-  ally, it is only by tasting a wine that it is possible to recognize what it is, in the same way that it is  possible one by hearing a symphony or by seeing a work of art to know precisely what it is.  9. The citation unfortunately has been misplaced.  10. The instrumental composition in which “communication” back and forth among the  performers may very well be the most saliently emphatic is Beethoven’s String Quartet No. 2  (Opus 18, No. 2) that is often known, and sometimes listed in musical programs, as the  Conversation Quartet.
