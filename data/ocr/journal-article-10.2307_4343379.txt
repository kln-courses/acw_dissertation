<plain_text><page sequence="1">REVIEWS Principium Sapientiae: The Origins of Greek Philo- sophical Thought. By F. M. CORNFORD. Edited by W. K. C. GUTHRIE. Cambridge: At the University Press, 1952. Pp. viii, 271. $5.00. This is the work on which Cornford was engaged at his death. It divides into two halves. In the first, en- titled "Empiricism Versus Inspiration," it is argued that the quarrel between poetry and philosophy is evidence of a common field of interest which had once been the preserve of a single figure, still extant in the shaman; this figure was later broken down into the three types of poet, prophet, and sage. Significantly, the three types continued to abide by the original assumption that all knowledge which lies beyond the reach of the senses in everyday experience must be revealed by divine in- spiration. Thus Burnet was wrong; with the partial exception of the doctors and a few others, the experi- mental technique was not known among the early philosophers. To prove this point, Cornford rather sur- prisingly turns to the procedure of Epicurus. He feels that if the Ionians had had an experimental technique, Epicurus, the supreme materialist, would have availed himself of it. Instead, we find the totally unscientific epibole dianoias which reminds us of the primitive view that the mind may occasionally leave the body to refresh itself at the source of knowledge. Plato, too, was re- duced to his "shamanistic" anamnesis which is analogous</page><page sequence="2">166 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY to the "inspiration" of Democritus, Hesiod, and others. Apparently Cornford does not distinguish between a passive "inspiration" and an active "ecstasy"; Hesiod is said to have looked upon his creative intuition in more or less the same light as Homer, or Heraclitus, or Empedocles. These pages are rather disturbing in their tendency to group a large variety of subtly differentiated phenomena under one and the same vague and inclusive rubric. The Ionians, then, in their lack of a truly scientific technique, were only the heirs of a tradition of "inspired" vision. Now what about the content of their teaching? This is the subject of the second part, entitled "Philo- sophical Cosmogony and Its Origins in Myth and Ritual." Cornford begins with a chapter on the system of Anaximander which seems to the reviewer much the best thing in the book. The Unlimited, we learn among other details, is neither infinite in extent nor qualita- tively indeterminate, but a homogeneous uninterrupted divine sphere from which the various contrasting masses, and the great cosmic cycles, came to be evolved. This system, and indeed the Ionian system of cosmogony in general, for which Cornford provides a striking tri- partite formulation (p. 189), is found to be merely an older mythological construct stripped of its divine ap- paratus. There are analogies between Hesiod, Genesis 1, and the lonians. The Theogony, in fact, presents the more abstract system, in which Gaia and Uranos are merely cosmic masses, along with (after line 132) the older anthropomorphic conception. Hesiod's story of Zeus is seen as a hero tale of the standard Frazerian pattern, here divided into seven phases (instead of Lord Raglan's twenty-two). In the end, the cosmogonic myth is associated with a ritual such as the Babylonian New Year Celebration; and, "the ritual is prior to the myth" (p. 237). This portion of the book is the least finished; there are statements which do not square with the final summary which the editor has prepared from the author's notes. The upshot of the argument is, however, clear: Ionian philosophical speculation ultimately derives from Syrian or Sumerian ceremonial hymns, themselves based on a primeval pre-agricultural ritual. This reviewer was greatly stimulated by some sections of the book, and somewhat uneasy over others. The second half in particular is subject to the same kind of criticism which has been levelled against T. H. Gaster's Thespis (cf., e.g., Rev. of Rel. 16 [1952] 163-166). For the rest, here are three comments: (1) The correlation between shamanistic (Thracian?) inspiration and (royal- ist?) Babylonian mythology is not made clear. (2) Even if the Ionians inherited the traditional pattern of cosmogony, the fact remains that they sloughed off the divine apparatus. Cornford does not ask why; but is this not the major mystery? (3) Cornford seems to assume that there are only two ways of looking at the problem: (a) the nineteenth century view that philosophy developed as a protest against religion, and (b) the right view, that philosophy started as an extension of religion. He does not allow for a third view, surely held by Burnet, that there is little contact between religion and philosophy, except that both are products of the human mind, and therefore obey some of the same formal laws. The following passage is instructive (p. 109): "The great pre-Socratic thinkers . . . have not . . . two dis- tinct versions of the universe-a religious one for Sundays and a scientific one for weekdays. Each has a single, unitary vision. . . ." It could be effectively argued that no man has merely one vision of the universe; even Durkheim's primitives, who have had so much to do with the shaping of Cornford's thought, have at least two approaches to reality. Actually Cornford's unitary vision, the merger of philosophy and religion, has a very old-fashioned look about it. Needless to say, in spite of its incomplete state the book contains many fascinating passages. If it is not as stimulating as Ftorn Religion to Philosophy, that may be due in part to the fact that we have learnt much in the past forty years, and that striking hypotheses can no longer be produced with the same unselfconscious and exhilarating gusto.
