<plain_text><page sequence="1">WERNER HAMACHER History, Teary Some Remarks on La Jeune Parquel -for Claudia In the "Avant-Propos" to his Regards sur le Monde Actuel (1931), Valery, mentions two historical events which, in spite of their relatively limited ef- fect, had for him the character not just of accidents but of shocks, to which he did not for a moment hesitate to attribute the significance of symptoms of long-term, but thus far hidden, historical movements. The shock proceeding from them is a jolt of cognition and disclosure, concerning a region of experi- ence hitherto inaccessible to consciousness. As Valery defines it, "[a] shock that reaches us from an unforeseen quarter can give us a sudden, novel sensa- tion of the existence of our body as an unknown quantity; . . ." (10,4).2 The deferred, belated cognition, in many respects too late, which is imparted by this unforeseen blow is, in this case, Valery's cognition of the "virtual idea of Europe" which, thus far unknown to him, regulated part of his psychic and intellectual economy. The shocking events mentioned lie three years apart- Valery notes their dates in the single footnote to his text: 1895 and 1898-and the first of the two follows by three years the date 1892, on which Valery's lyric production stalled for a long time: not until seven times three years later would Valery again begin work on a major lyric, La Jeune Parque. This peculiar arithmetic of stalling, repeated shocks, and a new beginning of lyric production not only suggests doubts about the genuinely shocking character of the events 1. Other remarks on the problem of History, Teary, relating to Hegel, Homer, Aristotle and Holderlin will be found in a lecture given in Gottingen in 1985 at the Seventh International Congress of Germanists and published in its Akten (Book 11, Tfibingen: Niemeyer, 1986) under the title "Ober einige Unterschiede zwischen der Geschichte literarischer und der Geschichte pha- nomenaler Ereignisse." 2.

[Translator's note] 67</page><page sequence="2">68 Yale French Studies mentioned-for selected shocks are hardly shocks-it also suggests that these events, as interpreted by Valery, could say something about the problems to which Valery responded once by breaking off his lyric poetry and later by beginning it again. It is a question, then, of two wars, that of Europeanized Japan against tradition-bound China and that of the United States against Spain. "One was the first act of power by an Asiatic nation remodeled and equipped on European lines; the other was the first act of power against a European nation by a nation derived and, as it were, developed from Europe" (10,4). What is shocking about these two armed conflicts becomes clear if, like Valery, one disregards all motivations of political economy and military strategy. In each case a "de- rived" power rises against the power from which it developed: an Asian coun- try affiliated with Europe rises against its Asian origins; another country affili- ated with Europe rises against its European origins. The drama of cultural filiation concealed under the political drama becomes clearer if one looks at Le Yalou, a text written by Valery during the war between China and Japan, in which he has his Chinese interlocutor speak of the double death of the Euro- pean fathers and the unlimited living on of the Chinese fathers: "Every man here feels that he is both son and father, . . . and is aware of being held fast by the people around him and the dead below him and the people to come.... Here everything is historical . . . " (10,374). To be historical is to be at the same time father and son, to see oneself not only as alive but at the same time as dead and as coming, to be as a part of an organic totality always also all its other parts and thus to perpetuate infinitely the cycle of historical life, which is essen- tially a cycle of organic life. In contrast to the patriarchal, organic history of China, European history is the patricidal and suicidal history of disorganiza- tion, of dead flowers cut off from their roots. "Think of the web of our race, and tell me, you who cut your roots and dry your flowers, how is it you still exist? " (10,374). The attack of Europeanized Japan against the culture from which it developed, like the attack of America on Spain, is a blow against the fatherland, patricidal, organicidal, and consequently historicidal. The shock that these two wars dealt to Valery leads him not to the calm acceptance of a modification within history or an inversion of international relations of filiation, but to the experience of the end of the international family history and its Oedipal disorders. What is implied by the parable of the conflict between China's natural history and Europeanized Japan's lack of history can be confirmed as a planetary experience more than forty years later, in 1931, for the Valery of the "Avant-Propos": history is at an end. In place of isolatable genealogical lines set up within geographically limited spheres of effect, there has appeared an endless, uncontrollable net of relations whose complexity permits neither long-term planning nor continuous development nor even the cognition of the motives or grounds for political action. "The age of the finite world has begun" (10,15). Once the finitude of the world is reached, so is the end of its organizability, the end of its predictability, and the end of every rational, consistent, sequentially proceeding and narratable histo-</page><page sequence="3">WERNER HAMACHER 69 ry. Even if the history of the finite world could be given an order, it could not be distinguished from a game of chance. Valery can conclude: "Hence the new politics are to the old what the short-term calculations of a stock market gambler-the nervous spurts of speculation on the floor of the exchange, the sudden fluctuations [ . . . ] are to the old patriarchal economy, the slow, careful accumulation of a patrimony .. . " (10,16). The death of the father and his long, slow gaze, the end of his house and his law, the exhaustion of his means and of the means for history, the stalling of historicality itself in the sphere of specula- tion-of stock market speculation. "The long-pursued schemes and profound thought of a Machiavelli or a Richelieu would today have no more reliability and value than a 'stock-market tip"' (10,16). The world of history, as Valery here enigmatically implies, stood under the principle of the appropriation of all future events to the authoritative word of the historicopolitical fathers. Wher- ever the reliability and the value of this word have shrunk to those of a stock market tip, wherever the power of the word to project and control history must give way to the incalculable play of chance, it is not only history which is over, but also the means, the capacity, the potential for history, historicality itself as a category of appropriation, of projection and capitalizing return to itself, of self-recognition and self-realization. But whenever historicality, far from hav- ing a "history" itself and being subject to "historical" changes, can stall, can break off, can end, then the means for history must already have been inserted all along into a context that has never been completely covered by historicality itself, that always already exceeded the limits of its conception and efficacy and whose range could no more be defined by the concept of historicality than the infrastructure of that to which that context was explicitly related could be. Whenever historicality can be devalued into a stock market tip, into a wager in a game of chance, then it has already been exposed all along to the game of chance that can be regulated only with difficulty and only for a limited time, but is for the time being uncontrollable; and this chance finds no support in any necessity or any law. Historicality is only a move in a game that can be mas- tered by neither rules nor means, without drawing them sooner or later into the game. There is no essence of this game other than one lost in the game. But that is also to say that no means of this game with the means, no rule of this game of chance with the rule can preclude a rule, an ordering, or an organization like that of history from reinstating itself by a further move in this game. And that is to say that the end of history, the end of historicality-what would other- wise be called a game-could be repeated countless times. The question, therefore, is what will become of history and its end in the deregulated context of the game of chance. The question is how history, its orderings and its names are transformed, deformed, displaced and decomposed</page><page sequence="4">70 Yale French Studies by conditions that no longer obey these orderings and names. How, therefore, does history survive, how does its end survive? What happens to its traces and to their disappearance? Valery's La Jeune Parque is a text that both thema- tically and formally attaches an unusually great weight to these questions- unusual, at least, if measured by the standard of that still ingrained habit whereby poesie pure, in which in any case its author's work is classed, may well have been itself a historical phenomenon, yet one that knew as little about its own history as it did about "history on the whole." As Valery stressed countless times, the work on La Jeune Parque was a refuge, the poem a fortress against the war; this time not against the Asian war or the equally distant Spanish-American War, but against the First World War that threatened the center of Europe with barbarism. While working on this text Valery wrote to Andre Breton in 1916: "I imagine a worker from the age of Latin verse. Back in the days of Attila and Genseric, there were rhetoricians chewing hexameters in a comer. For whom? For what?" (1, 1638). Almost thirty years later he wrote to Pauline Mascagni: "I saw myself as a fifth century monk who knows that all is lost, that the monastery will go up in flames and the barbarians will destroy everything. No one will see his work" (1, 1638). And in 1929 he wrote to Georges Duhamel: "This poem . . . has all the marks of the poems that might have been writtein in 1868 [an "arbitrary" date, but not far from 1898] as well as in 1890. 'For to all intents and purposes' the World War, during which it was written, might never have happened.-And yet I who wrote it know perfectly well that I did it sub signo Martis.... I would never have written it if it were not for the war- . . . I was paying homage to something about to vanish. I compared myself to those early medieval monks who heard the civilized world falling apart all around their cloisters, who believed in nothing except the end of the world, and yet wrote painstakingly, in hard, lowering hexameters, im- mense poems for no one" (1, 1637-3 8). The chiliastic, eschatological anxieties about the end of culture, the end of Europe, the end of the world and of history concern first of all language and its functions: the war, this First World War, would not only turn language into babble, into an unordered chaos of sounds or an automatism of mindlessly prattling repetitions, it would also rob it of its addressees, of the possibility of apostrophe, of the possibility, therefore, of being for others or for some other. Since then-and at the latest since then, for Valery himself refers to the chiliastic anxieties of the Middle Ages and could just as well have referred to those of antiquity without encountering signifi- cant differences-since that time language has been exposed to the possibility of addressing itself to no empirical other, of being for no one and nothing: "immense poems for no one. No one will see his work." To be for no one and nothing also means to be intended not even for its author, for the writing I or for the empirical person of this monk or this Paul Valery, since the latter will outlast "the end of the world" at most for a finite period: "the monastery will go up in flames." In every poem and linguistic utterance, the-apriori-pos- sibility of being for no one and nothing, of being without direction, determina-</page><page sequence="5">WERNER HAMACHER 71 tion, and meaning, goes along with the possibility of not being, of not being alive, of not being real and of not being effective as language. "I confess that French seemed a dying language to me, and that I was schooling myself to consider it sub specie aeternitatis . . ." writes Valery in his letter to Duhamel (1, 1638). And in a letter to Albert Mockel, shortly after the conclusion of the work on La Jeune Parque in 1917, he writes: "to erect a small, possibly funer- ary monument to this language, a monument made with its purest words and its noblest forms-a little, dateless tomb-on the threatening banks of the Sea of Drivel . . ." (1, 1630). A grave for a dead language, for a language that no longer speaks, or which, instead of speaking, is only mindlessly babbled-the babble, against which this tomb is supposed to be erected as a dam, sounds, as it were, in it-such a grave, however much it is intended to maintain language and preserve it beyond its death, contains at best its decomposing corpse and is itself constructed out of something that can no longer simply be called lan- guage, if all language is past, decayed and disintegrated. The "little, dateless tomb" which Valery's poem is supposed to be is a tomb for a language without language and for no one who could still remember this deceased. And it is a tomb without language for the language that is lost: "dateless," without a name, without dates of birth and death, for something that may have been born sometime or other and simultaneously have died. A statutory passing away. Intended for no one and nothing, this remainder of language that the tomb presents may well be language in its purity, nonreferentiality, and virtuality, "made with its purest words," but not as a living and undecomposable sub- stance, rather merely as a temporary deferral of its decay. A statue passing away. The eschaton of language, pure language, is destined to set a limit to its empirical passing away, but it can only do so in such a way that it is hardly an empirical object itself any longer, neither vivid nor readable nor comprehensi- ble. To the extent that it is pure language, it is no language. In its tomb language is external to itself. It is contracted into it as the condition of its survival-but into it as the metaphor, the translation and the exodus of itself into a space in which it is temporarily safe from decay. In order to be itself at all, it must externalize itself into a spatial object, into its own tomb, into the monument of its death in which, entirely for itself, it is no longer with itself. Since this movement of the self-interment and autosar- cophagism of language is immanent to language, if its tomb is still to be there as the remains of the totality of what has passed away, then "tombeau" is no simple metaphor; it is the first metaphor of language, the metaphor of its metaphoricity, the very metaphor of linguisticity in general, because it is that metaphor, and in it the withdrawal of metaphor and language, which first opens the possibility, the most precarious possibility of language. Were it not the withdrawing marker of its own transience, language would never "be." Only under the condition that it no longer be language, not an empirical, psychological, historical fact among others, can it survive as language. Its world is only given retrospectively by its ending, and only the end of history,</page><page sequence="6">72 Yale French Studies even the end of the means for history as presented in the grave of language, opens the sphere of its historicality. If something still happens in the tomb of language, it is that the possibility of history proceeds from here. If language still speaks in the poem, its "possibly funerary monument, " then it is only by allowing speaking to begin here, and if it still signifies, then it is by offering the condition of signifying and of Being without itself signifying something or even being something. The poem-a transcategorical tomb of history, of language. The commentaries about La Jeune Parque cited here from Valery's corre- spondence would have merely the limited significance of recollections of the intentions that he pursued in his work or the slight importance of a self- interpretation, were it not that they are factually grounded in his text and could be read as its further working out in prose and sometimes even as citations from it. In fact La Jeune Parque offers the image of an anthology, of shorthand notes or a reservoir of myths and literatures of Europe and especially of France. Without being named by name, the characters and stories of Eurydice and Psyche, for example, of Leda and Semele, Alcestis, Athalia and Alcyon, the motifs and techniques of Euripides, Virgil and Ovid, of Racine, Corneille, Baudelaire, and repeatedly, above all, of Mallarme, may be recognized in this text. But it is not only their characters and words that are conjured up in it; more precisely, it is their deaths, it is they as dead, as such, that run through a catabasis and that have survived through the act of speech that Valery's text cites. La Jeune Parque is a grave of graves and funeral pyres, a literary history of the surviving dead, of linguistic phantoms, shadows, and masks-a history, in short, of literature. What speaks in it as an I, as a poetic I, an I of poetry with the name La Jeune Parque, if it can then speak, is death. As "Le Philosophe et la Jeune Parque," the short didactic poem that provides less Valery's sarcastic response to Alain's interpretation than the response of the Jeune Parque her- self-the poem still speaks beyond the poem-puts it: Qui s'6gare en soi-meme aussit6t me retrouve. Dans 1'obscur de la vie oui se perd le regard, Le temps travaille, la mort couve, Une Parque y songe a 1'cart. C'est MOI ...

Readers are referred to the English edition of Valery cited in the notes. [Editor's note]</page><page sequence="7">WERNER HAMACHER 73 other death embodied and awakened to life, am death, corporeal, living death-and death, still the absolute reality of finite life in he who reads me: thus first of all in me myself. Death of death, pure death is like that pure I that presents itself as MOI, always the death of an other, always another death and never death itself: immediately different from itself, one only as the incom- patible many that it must cite in order to give itself a shape, however dark, one only as the one that (it) is not, and real power only as fiction: "death"-even if it is not designated as a goddess of death or of destiny, as a Parque, or, as Valery had planned it in his drafts of the title, as La Stygienne or Divinite du Styx-is an allegorical figure. Death-the word, the occurrence, as the parting from occurrence-is a poem: "Poeme que je suis .". ." not a poem of death as a real, empirical "theme" or a referent within a historically describable reality, but rather a poem of death as the end of reality and its referents, as the athe- matization and withdrawal of theme, therefore a poem that speaks not at all of death but itself speaks as death, as the trace of this withdrawal, as with-drawal. Yet as death, as this withdrawal and its trace, and speaking, death-the poem-is no longer or not yet death-the poem-itself. Thereby severed from itself; both the end and the mark of the end that it outlasts, both the parting from the possibility of signifying and the promise of its return, both the with- drawal of the present and the trace that it leaves behind as something that never has been and never can be present itself-death, doubled, is "death"; the language of finitude is always at the same time the opening and the disguising of finitude, and the poem, by being itself, is what remains of its disappearance, the "poem." Valery wanted to name his poem Jeune Parque de soi-meme, the Parque written by herself, the Parque her own writing, autogeneous, but in this auto- geneity, this generatio aequivoca, also absolutely heterogeneous, the Parque, the death goddess of her self, the other, inauthentic, allegorical "death," that has overtaken death itself, actual, meant, my own death-and overtaken it in itself, in death itself, in the concept of its self. The immediate doubling that has already split the mere name "Parque" or "Death" makes all speech that may be concerned with it, makes every finite language into the Doppelganger of itself, into a spirit, a phantom, into the trace and the citation of what is meant in it, into the citation of itself as the citation of an irreducible and unobtainable, unrepeatable other. The fact that La Jeune Parque presents itself as a grave of graves, that it offers a succession of citations of other poems of conjuration and an inventory of strictly observed classical rules of poetry and, moreover, that structurally it is nothing other than a self-proliferating citing and reciting of literary history, is only the consequence of the tear [Rif?] that opens up in the single word "death" or "I" or "world" and in fact in every word of the language, as soon as it is read in relation to "itself." La Jeune Parque is a masterpiece of unoriginality-hence the impression of neoclassicism and theatricality that it always provokes-not because it speaks its language only as a restaging of another language that has passed into history, but rather because it speaks its</page><page sequence="8">74 Yale French Studies own language as immediately other and thereby makes itself into a language that has passed into history. Only this delicate tear that is opened in its "self"- relation, this alteration in its "self"-citation, draws the works of historical literatures under its spell. The historicity articulated in La Jeune Parque is its own, improper historicitation [Historizitat]. La Jeune Parque is a grave of graves first and foremost because it is its own grave. Already different from itself in each of its utterances, it is what remains of it and what it is still to become. It is the retelling of the memory of its past and the foretelling of its future, a memorial speech of its foretelling and a foretelling of the past of its foretelling. It thus marks the moment of absolute danger of language: the danger of being in itself null, of already being the past in every possible future; and it is the moment of its greatest hope: of being able to consolidate itself with itself in the future that would be its own past. In the seventh section of La Jeune Parque, the outcry "O dangereusement de son regard la proie!" is followed by the narrative motivations for this warning cry that explains the provenance of this danger and cry in the mode of a recollect- ing speech and thereby opens out the second of the exclamatio into the histor- ical extension of its ground: Car P'oeil spirituel sur ses plages de soie3 Avait deja vu luire et palir trop de jours Dont je m'6tais pr6dit les couleurs et les cours. L'ennui, le clair ennui de mirer leur nuance, Me donnait sur ma vie une funeste avance: L'aube me devoilait tout le jour ennemi. J'6tais a demi morte; et peut-etre, a demi Immortelle.... [I, 1011 The future known as the past reduces all futures that could be imagined, foretold or anticipated to pasts that can no longer be exceeded by any further future. The foretold future is the history that one has behind oneself, but this history, as concluded history-like every history, regardless of genre-has a privileged narrator who is dead. Yet she who narrates a history, and moreover the history of her future, must not only be dead, she must at the same time be immortal. She must not only survive her death, she must also always still have her past before her, this death itself, as her future, suffering an infinite series of deaths, that she must make by her narration into moments of a life that is dedicated entirely to the narration of its past and to the narration of the past of this narration. Whoever wants to narrate his history must have it not only behind him; he must also always have it before him, since he must also include the narration of history in it. He must be half-dead and half-immortal; but- "peut-etre, a demi / Immortelle." For whoever always still has his death before 3. Or de soi, as Celan's admirable translation suggests: "Denn ihm, dem kustenreichen, dem geistigen Auge...." [For to it, the spiritual eye, rich in shores ... I In: Paul Celan, Gesammelte Werke in Five volumes Frankfort on Main: Suhrkamp, 1983), 4, 133.</page><page sequence="9">WERNER HAMACHER 75 him can never know, since his history is not yet concluded and is actually unconcludable, that death will not befall him- as little as he can know that he is already dead. For the narration of history, it is strictu sensu unavoidable that the narrator be both, and be both halfway: dead and immortal; but for the cognitive status of the narrator it follows, equally compellingly, that a knowl- edge of his death and a familiarity with his immortality, however halfway they may ever be, remain inaccessible to him. The one double word "peut-etre" marks this difference between the necessities of the performative structure of narration and the impossibility of its cognitive content. But since the history here narrated by the Parque is a history of self-consciousness, of knowledge knowing itself-its problems touch those of Hegel's history just as its "solu- tions" are close to those of Nietzsche's history of the eternal return-in this "peut-etre" is also indicated that the consciousness which must grasp itself as historical, that is, as always and absolutely past, can never be certain of its duration, and consequently that the history of self-consciousness can never be that history in which a consciousness can know that it narrates itself. The self- relation of consciousness must be narrated as history, for this relation implies a distance whose reduction may be expected solely in the medium of history; but once exposed to this distance, no consciousness can know any longer whether its history is narrated and whether it itself narrates it. Not knowing what it does, consciousness can never be conscious of itself and never self- consciousness. It forfeits control over itself at the same time that it forfeits the ability to assert itself as the origin of history. It is not its historicality that is articulated in history, and if the question here can be of historicality at all, then it is not in the sense of a substantial capacity of the subjectivity of the subject, but rather in the sense of a contingent game of unreliable affirmations, among which the assumption of the possibility of self-consciousness is only one. "J'etais a demi morte; et peut-etre, a demi / Immortelle ... ." this line speaks of the problematic consciousness of history as a matter of the past; it speaks of its death and of its virtual immortality as survived, and therefore speaks from a position which is no longer simply that of consciousness. It becomes clear from its eccentric position that it never was the consciousness that sought to comprehend itself in its projection and narration, rather that it was only the fiction of a consciousness that would be able to identify itself in its narration. J'etais a demi morte; et peut-etre, a demi Immortelle, revant que le futur lui-meme Ne fut qu'un diamant fermant le diademe Oii s'echange le froid des malheurs qui naitront Parmi tant d'autres feux absolus de mon front.[I, 1011 The diamond, as which the future was then dreamed, would have been the keystone bringing together the two halves of consciousness, its unthinkable death and its uncertain immortality, into the full circle of self-consciousness.</page><page sequence="10">76 Yale French Studies In it the deaths of consciousness would be just as many immortalities and consciousness would be able to become aware of itself in each of its positions as the self that, untouchable by any time, founds its own infinitude. After this dream of an unlimited self-consciousness has foundered-that is, foundered because of the internal tensions of the project of a consciousness knowing itself-there remains only the helpless question of whether uncontrollable time will call forth a recollection of its childhood out of the graves of the I (ressusciter-and in fact the following lines contain a citation from Victor Hugo's funeral homage upon the death of Theophile Gautier): "Osera-t-il, le Temps, de mes diverses tombes, / Ressusciter un soir favori des co- lombes, / . . ." (I, 101). Yet the opening of the "diadem" between self and consciousness and in these two, the virtual impossibility of opening up the graves and of citing the recollections, are already indicated on the near side of the narrative and semantic statements in Valery's handling of the alexandrine that concerns the dream of a diamond future. "Ne fut qu'un diamant fermant le diademe" is interrupted by a caesura at exactly the spot where-as confirmed by the adjective "fermant" belonging grammatically to the noun "diamant" and by the rhyme between them, and confirmed as well by the prefix rhyme between "diamant" and "diademe"-it should tell of the indivisible closure and the power of closure of that language of the future. The line in which the circle of self-consciousness should be closed, at least in a dream and in the art of the Parque, opens through formal and mechanical compulsion a pause in the aesthetic project of a "Harmonieuse MOI" (I, 99), a pause which opens out knowledge and self into separate entities. The language of the knowing self is interrupted here not by an act of arbitrariness, but by a formal law of traditional prosody, thus by a conventional rule with which no meaning out of the circle of an autonomous linguistic self may be joined. The history and language of the Parque is interrupted, no doubt, in this caesura-but the Parque, La Jeune Parque, speaks of this interruption and speaks of nothing other than precisely this interruption of her language and the history of her consciousness throughout the text. In the passage of her text that precedes the narration of her impossible self-citation, the sixth section in which she speaks explicitly of her art for the only time- "Oh! combien peut ... de sombres essais s'approfondir mon art! . . ." (I, 100)-and of the vision of her dephenomenalized and dephenomenalizing gaze, of the absolute borderline position of her eye that is "seuil d'infernales demeures" and at the same time "bord dore de l'univers" and in which, as over and over again in her entire text, she unfolds the oxymoron of the blind sight of art, in order thereby to solicitate the anthropomorphic contours of her image of art, of the image of herself as a statue-at the end of this seventh section is said: Je renouvelle en moi mes enigmes, mes dieux, Mes pas interrompus de paroles aux cieux, Mes pauses, sur le pied portant le reverie, Qui suit au miroir d'aile un oiseau qui varie,</page><page sequence="11">WERNER HAMACHER 77 Cent fois sur le soleil joue avec le neant, Et brile, au sombre but de mon marbre beant. [I, 101] The subject of these lines is the art of language, of the language of riddles and the language of prayer, that begins in the thought of the end of the world- "que le monde finisse" concludes the preceding line. They have, once more, "them- selves" as subject-that is, not immediately their rhetorical but first of all their prosodic mode. "Mes pas interrompus de paroles aux cieux, / Mes pauses, sur le pied portant la reverie"-if the subject of these lines, as of so many others, is the foot or the feet of the Parque, then it is the metrical feet, the pieds metriques of the Jeune Parque, and if the subject is her pas, then it is not the steps of a person descriptively presented in this poem but the "pas . . . de paroles" made with these metrical feet. The limbs grow on the Parque by the anthropomorphizing catachresis of a terminus technicus of prosody.4 But this figure, into which the Parque, the "I" of this poem, momentarily organizes herself, is led in each of its positions to the point of its mechanical disorganiza- tion, its deanthropomorphization, its amorphization. Thus it may well be possible to read and to translate the line "Mes pas interrompus de paroles aux cieux" as Celan does: "die Schritte, unterbrochen von Worten himmelwdrts, "5 by putting the caesura between pas and interrompus and making the words of the prayer into the agent interrupting the human steps; but this possiblity of scansion is interfered with by the other possibility of reading the pas not as the steps of the marble figure but as those of the paroles: "Mes pas interrompus de paroles aux cieux. . . . " The scarcely resolvable syntactosemantical ambiguity motivated by the rhythmic interference and by the syncopation of the caesuras affects not only the status of pas and paroles, but also the status of interrom- pus, to the point of their inability to be comprehended and carried out: pas, paroles, interrompus are pas, paroles, interrompus and are not; by theirpauses and poses they mark the shape of language and at the same time suspend by multiplication its contours, limits, and caesuras to the extent that it is no longer at all certain what paroles, what words and what language might be here at all and whether they really are. "Douceur d'etre et de n'etre pas" (I, 121)- wrote Valery in the poem "Les Pas," but the pas of La Jeune Parque and its Being are anything but blissful. For the line "Mes pauses, sur le pied portant la reverie," which lacks a comma in earlier versions (cf., I, 1643), not only makes a pause out of the metrical foot, like the preceding line, it not only makes a reverie of pauses out 4. They do so in interplay with other body parts, especially the bras which is determinant for the entire structure of La Jeune Parque-and its phonetic metastases bas, bague, arbre, mar- bre . . . -which are to be read as catachreses for the parentheses, not only for the graphically explicit ones but also for the structural parentheses of the poem, as is programmatically indicated in its first section by the lines "Quand (au velours du souffle envolk lor des lampes) / J'ai de mes bras 6pais environn6 mes tempes" (1, 97). These limbs and body parts-pied, bras, joue, genoux, 6paule, main, sein . . . -found and contour the anthropomorphic figure of the Parque in her poem. 5. Celan, 4, 131, "The steps, interrupted by words heavenward."</page><page sequence="12">78 Yale French Studies of the reverie, which is related to the pied- "la reverie... portant ... sur le pied"-it also makes this pied, almost literally, into the piedestal which bears the reverie of the marble statue, a reverie which is the statue of the Parque and is the Parque "itself." But the reverie that the word, and more precisely, the graphics of the "word"pied, bears- "sur lepied portant la reverie"-is first of all nothing other than the dot on its "i." It is no longer a matter of the word designating something, whether it be, like pauses, this stalling, abiding or faltering of language that give it contour and figure-and no longer a matter of the pauses and caesuras that by their interruption give language contour and techno- or anthropomorphic shape. It is rather a matter of a dot that hardly has a morphological function at all (it would disappear if one capitalized the word pied bearing it: PIED) and consequently does not belong in a strict sense to the significant traits of language, but does belong to the traits of its writing, of language not determined as the morphological unity of a significant corpus. The dot belongs to those traits of language in which it founds in its conven- tional materiality neither a distinct form nor a well-defined meaning. In its dots, writing is language that has nothing to say. Accordingly, the lines of the Parque assign to this dot of pied the status of both a pause- "Mes pauses, sur le pied"-and a reverie- "sur le pied ... la reverie"-of a pause in the dream of language and of a reverie that is the pause of language. This suspension of language and morphologically determined writing in the mute dot of the "i' makes the dot, precisely because it has nothing to say, accessible for its cata- chrestic interpretation by the reverie; and because it does not have the unity of a diacritical mark, it may, without remaining the same, be repeated, declined and inflected by the graphic markings of the reverie, especially by its circum- flex accent. Reverie here does not simply mean reverie, daydream, but rather the word that is marked by a dot and an accent, in which the dot is inflected and repeated, a word therefore, that comes into consideration not so much as a word than as a bearer of its markings, as a graphic notation, that with its circumflex accent ^, a mirror image of the wings -, follows that varying bird which the dot of the "i" has become by that tropo-graphic reverie, by the graphics of its r 'v r "Mes pauses, sur le pied portant la reverie, / Qui suit au miroir d'aile un oiseau qui varie"-these lines are written as a catachrestic meditation on the stalling of language-and also the stalling of the language of this meditation- in the caesura and in the writing, and as articulation, inflection, and displace- ment of those borderlines of language that define its morphological and, more- over, its anthropomorphic figure in its unity, representability, and signifi- cance. The shifting stall of language in its pauses, dots and curves is not a process in which a consciousness could still come to an understanding of its own functions, or in which an I could find the ground for its constitution or even its stabilization. Rather, the language of the representing consciousness irresistibly slips away from itself in the pauses and dots of its writing and must abandon the project of a history of self-consciousness which should be able to</page><page sequence="13">WERNER HAMACHER 79 grasp itself as itself in each of its points; it must abandon it to the game of a dot whose appearance is contingent, whose movement is uncontrollable and whose significance is null. "[ . . . . I un oiseau, qui varie, / Cent fois sur le soleil joue avec le neant, / Et bru'le, au sombre but de mon marbre beant." If the entire movement of the last six lines had proceeded from the I and the renewal of its language- "Je renouvelle en moi mes enigmes, mes dieux"-then it con- cludes without concluding, after the uplifting of the language in prayer, after the elevation of the rhythmic and graphic marking of the morphological cor- pus in the hundredfold game of a bird, of a dot, that plays with nothingness, with "its" nothingness, and like Daedalus or the Phoenix, burns and is extinguished6 at the end, at the end of the sentence. The language of the I is, in its prayer and in its writing, at its goal, which is at the same time an end and an opening, for by burning up, the bird-dot opens the sentence that as an intact dot it could only conclude-; the language of the I is not simply nothing at this goal; rather, whether embers or ashes-and elsewhere it expressly says "je goute a la cendre" (I, 109)-it is a game with nothingness. A game with the nothingness of this language and the nothingness of this I-with a noth- ingness, therefore, that can always be stated, which can always be played and played with; a game that is always a game with the great sun myths of Hellenistic antiquity, French classicism and symbolism, and that ends at the goal, however sinister, of a marble that can be called mine. The game of this dot, of this pause, or of this reverie of the I is filled to bursting with historicist, morphological and egological reminiscences and intentions-and as such it is, without a doubt, a game of the I, an eschatological game in which the I can record its counted losses as just that many gains in order to assert its mastery at the end and after the end of the game. But this controlled movement of self- assertion is thwarted in the asemantic dot and the syncope of its caesura by a movement that can no longer be dominated by the I, its reminiscences, and intentions; the game of the I is crossed by a game to which the I is exposed, and the end, its marble shape, the highest point of its morphological intentions, splits: ". . . mon marbre beant." The shape, the I, gapes. Blanc. New section: "O dangereusement de son regard la proie!" The gaping opening in my marble statue is interpreted by the succeeding lines as its dan- gerous, rupturing, vanished gaze. Even if it is interpreted in the concepts of a negative aesthetics which are intended to make up part of its loss in mor- phological self-control, the I is expropriated by this son in the caesura of the highest point of its shape. In the attempt to become totally transparent and to determine thoroughly the limits of its language in the abstract forms of its temporal measures (in the metrical feet) and the spatialization of its writing (in the reverie of the dot)-therefore of its time and its space-a movement has been marked off in the I that disrupts its figure and the forms of its intuition. Not, as might be supposed, that a second I would have nestled itself in the first 6. Celan/Antschel translates: verascht. Cf., Celan, 4, 131.</page><page sequence="14">80 Yale French Studies one, nor that its spatial and temporal determination would be overlaid by the grid of a second, autonomous determination; rather the figure of the spa- tiotemporal I itself in its utmost universality has been destituted and disiden- tified in the course of its linguistic constitution ... and opened out into a sphere that slips away from it and its pretentions to consciousness and thor- ough self-determination all the more incessantly that it can gain a foothold only in its mute, inhibited materiality. Valery, to be sure, stressed repeatedly and with the greatest sincerity, both in his correspondence and his notes, that "the vague subject of the work is Awareness; Poe's La Conscience de soi- meme, if you will" (I, 1630)-therefore the artifact's constructivist self-con- sciousness of its individual technical and rhetorical operations-and he was certainly not wrong in his impression that La Jeune Parque was "an (intellec- tual, of course) autobiography" (I, 1633) and "that the FORM of this song is an autobiography" (I, 1635), "consciousness conscious of itself is both its persona and its object" (I, 1636)-but this cursory reference leaves unmentioned what is most important: that the autos of this autobiography, the form, in the course of its becoming self-conscious and of its self-realization, different from the Hegelian self, splits off from its graphie; that consciousness in the course of its realization must be acknowledged as incapable of consciousness; and that the I stands not in its history and not in the world of a history organized by it, but rather, as expressed in the fifteenth section of La Jeune Parque with greater precision than in Valery's self-commentary on the theory of consciousness, it stands "Entre des mots sans fin, sans moi, balbuties . . ." (I, 109). The trace of these stammered, endless, and aimless words that slip away from the supervision of the I-but do not slip away from it without it itself naming the form of its absence-; the trace of these suspended words of an I suspended in its gaping remains extremely discreet in Valery's text, but can hardly be overlooked. If one disregards the endless series of catachreses, ana- coluthons and paronomases that constantly disrupt the verbal and syntactical unities of the text and thwart its stable organization, the trace is perhaps most prominent in that for which French has the most appropriate expression: in the points de suspension, in the dots with which the text of La Jeune Parque is strewn like no other text from Valery's pen, and to which one knows that Valery devoted the greatest attention in correcting various already published versions. In the sixth section these dots, which no reader can know exactly how to understand, are put in an almost explicit relation to the art of the Parque: "[ ... ] de sombres essais s'approfondir mon art! . .. ," and in an equally almost unmistakable relation to the theme majeur of the entire text, the gaze: "Je ne rends plus au jour qu'un regard etranger. . . ." This relation between art, regard etranger and the points de suspension is almost explicit and almost unmistakable because every thematic relation into which the points de suspension could enter ... is suspended by the merely formal char- acter of their materiality." [ . .. ] mon art! . . ." is the art of the suspension of</page><page sequence="15">WERNER HAMACHER 81 art that attempts in the statuary work to illustrate thematically the form of the I; "un regard etranger . . ." is not only the strange gaze but that gaze whose "own" strangeness is overrun by those dots that no longer sight anything distinct and thus mark the suspension of even the strangest gaze. The art, the gaze, the I ... go astray, as it were, in the graphic markings of what they themselves-as well-defined morphological unities, as subjects or as themes-cannot state and without which they themselves, in their own artic- ulation, could not manage. By means of the points de suspension, every word and every sentence becomes the catachresis of its suspension. But the sus- pended relation which the points de suspension maintain to the words, syn- tagms and themes of the text which they pervade, this relation of the suspen- sion of their relation to the text and to its metrics still remains just enough relation to be able to be affected, tropologized, and semanticized by its themes and movements. The points de suspension are also point de suspension [no suspension]: they suspend themselves and give themselves up, hardly different from the pure, wordless I, to their disfiguration in the medium of mundane designation. While the speaking gaze of the self-conscious I presents the cen- tral theme of La Jeune Parque, the dots of La Jeune Parque articulate the exorbitant theme of the incontinence of the theme "gaze" in their interpreta- tion as surplus, ascent, distance, spatial and temporal indetermination of the gaze . . . and as tears from the eye that casts the gaze and can no longer cast it because of them. The tears of La Jeune Parque belong to the series of cata- chreses of its points de suspension. "Senti monter / larmes de l'esprit"-thus reads one of the first notes which can be shown to have led to the earliest stages of La Jeune Parque. This note is a marginalia to the uncompleted draft of a poem on the death of Stephane Mal- larme entitled "Stephane Mallarme melodieusement / mysterieusement." Its text, as far as it may be deciphered on the basis of the facsimile in Florence de Lussy's La Genese de La Jeune Parque de Paul Valery, reads: Et si la terre trouble hume ta chair chetive J'ai de ton pur esprit le plus beau tombeau je serai le tombeau de ton ombre pensive L'ombre de ne savoir si tu cherches encore Mon ame de ton ane est le vivant tombeau Ombrage quelquefois par ton ombre pensive</page><page sequence="16">82 Yale French Studies Terre melee a l'herbe et rose, porte moi Porte doucement moi, 6 trouble et bienheureuse Terre jusqu'A le bleu tremblant mon emoi jusqu'A la place ofi je sente l'rmoi l'idee 7 A second marginalia to this text may be deciphered as "parque." This draft for a "Tombeau de Stephane Mallarme" dates from the year 1898, in September of which Mallarme died, and the year of the Spanish-American War, of which Valery was able to say in the "Avant-Propos" to his Regards sur le Monde Actuel that it had dealt him one of those blows that led to a new sense of the existence of his body as something hitherto unknown-a shock that, as Le Yalou makes clear, is closely associated with the experience of the death of the father and thereby at the same time with the experience of the dying out of the capacity for history. Fifteen years after writing the draft of this poem, as he began work on La Jeune Parque, Valery no longer designated himself as the grave of his teacher's shadow. But he made his poem into the burial place of Mallarme's name and wrote it with the remains of his name. The apostrophe that appears in the draft of the "tombeau" in 1898, "Terre melee a l'herbe et rose, porte moi / Porte doucement moi, 6 trouble et bienheureuse," became in 1917, in the tenth section of La Jeune Parque, this less euphoric call that is conscious of danger: "Terre trouble . . . et melee a l'algue, porte-moi, / Porte doucement moi . . . Ma faiblesse de neige / Marchera-t-elle tant qu'elle trouve son piege?" (I, 105). Even if one reads the "faiblesse de neige" not as motivated by the association between "algue" and the latin algor [snow flurry], and correspondingly reads the solid earth not as dissolved with the "algue" as algor into a flurry of flakes, but rather as merely mingled with the algae of the sea, on the coast of which the Jeune Parque is situated, then in comparison with the earth in the earlier draft of the poem, the earth called to here has forfeited almost all of its stability. It no longer offers the I of the poem and the course of its language any firm, lasting support. All the less support, that is, since this course engenders the earth as the ground of this course: ... Durete precieuse ... 0 sentiment du sol, Mon pas fondait sur toi l'assurance sacree! Mais sous le pied vivant qui tate et qui le cree Et touche avec horreur a son pacte natal, Cette terre si ferme atteint mon piedestal. Non loin, parmi ces pas, reve mon precipice . . . [I, 105] 7. Florence de Lussy, La Genese de "La Jeune Parque" de Paul Valery, essai de chronologie (Paris: Minard, 1975).</page><page sequence="17">WERNER HAMACHER 83 Nothing more misleading than the Valery criticism, which sees a suicide fan- tasy at work in these lines. These lines speak about speech, its step, its foot and metrical foot, its cadences and caesuras, in which it gropes, slips, and falters, and in which it threatens to lose itself: they speak about pas, pied, pacte, piedestal, parmi, pas, their rhythmic arsis and thesis and the pauses in which the ground posited by their steps withdraws. It is not beyond these steps and their interruptions, not before them in a threatening future, but "Non loin, parmi ces pas," among and between the steps of this speech that the gap is opened in which speech threatens to lose itself with every posing and every stalling of the step, in which the pied of speech threatens to sink into a plege. The pacte natal that the poem does not cease to touch upon, shuddering, is, from the first word on, a deadly pact with "itself" as a slippery rock that affords no foothold, but to leave which would mean to be "en soi-meme ineffablement seul," lonelier than lonely, unspeakably lonely: unspeakable and therefore as language not to be. The pacte natal of language with itself as its sole ground- the symbolic and symbolistic pact par excellence-is therefore apriori a pact with the inevitable necessity, already here and now, at the conclusion of the pact, to dissolve the pact. A pact with the impossibility of the pact; one whose positing is immediately exposed to its stalling; a pact broken not by an external effect, an oversight, an accident, but one that is broken in its very conclusion- therefore itself external, parapraxis and accident.... While the early draft of a "tombeau, " which reflected the linguistic condi- tions of a monument funeraire as little as the laws under which language stands generally, was still able to make the promise that it would contain, keep, and preserve Mallarme, his soul, and his spirit: "Mon Ame de ton Ame est le vivant tombeau"-the language of La Jeune Parque, in which the problem of Mallarme's burial is further worked out, cannot even preserve itself. Its pact with itself is one and is not one; its pas multiplies and revokes itself in the same pas, parmi ces pas, -but in this affirmation of its original lack of a self, in the giving up of the I that is articulated in its pas-pas, it relinquishes the word with much less restraint to an other than could the speech that declares itself to be the precinct and the limit of the other. But it relinquishes the word not to a pure other that would merely be the complement of the pure I and that, in order to present itself as pure, would have to enter the realm of empirical, historical articulation like this I; it relinquishes it just as little to an empirical other and its supposedly well-defined unity, but rather to an other whose language enters its text only fragmentarily and whose name enters it only as dismembered and mistakable: as a citation therefore of a deconstituted lan- guage and of a self-decomposing name. The name that leaves behind its traces in this rewriting of "Stephane Mallarme mysterieusement"-perhaps only as one of many-is no longer simply that of Mallarme; rather the name "Mal- larme"-for only thus is it historically read-is to be spelled by these decom- posing traces in Valery's text. The scene that the wind weaves here gives an</page><page sequence="18">84 Yale French Studies echo from "Brise Marine" and Un Coup de Des-named in Valery's notes to the Parque in Occitan as Cop de dad:8 ... Et le vent semble au travers d'un linceul Ourdir de bruits marins une confuse trame, Melange de la lame en ruine, et de rame ... Tant de hoquets longtemps, et de riles heurtes, Brises, repris au large . . . et tous les sorts jetes Eperdument divers roulant l'oubli vorace ... The name Mallarme-if it is then still his-stands here at the limit of read- ability. To read it nevertheless as a decomposed name is only possible and legitimate on the basis of the philological reconstruction of the derivation of this text from the earlier draft of the poem on the death of Stephane Mallarme; it is possible, moreover, because these lines themselves describe the work of weaving dispersed sounds into a thread: "Ourdir de bruits marins une confuse trame"-and in describing the elements of this woven thread, display the sounds of which it is composed: "M6lange de la lame en ruine, et de rame . . ." Me1 ... lame ... ra ... : "Mallarme" is named in each of its syllables- "a travers un linceul." But these lines-and for this reason the name Mallarme remains at the edge of readability-do not themselves do what they describe as the activity of the wind; they make common cause with the sea and impart only its isolated, dispersed, broken, yet repeatedly echoed syllables, without assembling them into the distinct and unproblematically identifiable unity of its form. They make common cause with the shifting rock-"L'insensible rocher ... Commence ... Et le vent semble . . ."-with the stalling of lan- guage in its positing, common cause with the immediate disintegration and accident of language and of the name-"sorts jetes"-as it is displayed in Mallarme's Un Coup de Des, common cause with a mer-and with a mere- whose voracious forgetting still threatens to devour the last remains of lin- guistic sounds. Valery's lines make-"a travers d'un linceul" and "Eperdu- ment divers"-common cause with Mallarmort and Mallarmere: common cause with what is inaccessible for communication, except, perhaps, the rup- tured, partial, and decaying communication in the process of linguistic decomposition. If all history is a relation to the other as a finite other, then every attempt at imitation, assimilation or incorporation of the other is an attempt to ensure its survival and to deny its finitude. But every attempt to make the other survive proceeds from the tacit presupposition that it is finite, mortal, and, already in its lifetime, in all the forms of its being present, touched by death. The survival 8. Cf. ed. Nadal 5/30.</page><page sequence="19">WERNER HAMACHER 85 of the finite other in the shapes of historical relations is therefore never merely the survival of its life, but always rather of its death. Every citation, be it the citation of a gesture, a text, or a name, declares the death of what is cited, and every survival in citation is the survival of one that is dead, one that absents itself, withdraws, disintegrates and, slipping away from its own control and the control of every possible other, is altered. If all history is a relation to the other as a finite other, then it is a relation to a self-altering other, to the withdrawal of the other, and is therefore a self-altering, self-withdrawing relation, a with- drawal of that relation, that first of all makes it into a historical-and this also always means a cognitively or morphologically controlled or controllable- other. History as a relation to the finite other is therefore not only itself finite, but, because of its finitude and in spite of the denials that it mobilizes in the forms of assimilation, incorporation, and repetition in knowledge or habit, it is never in its own element, never in the element of the knowing, representing and determining reference. History, the self-withdrawing reference to the other in its finitude, is-and is therefore barely-still the withdrawal of histo- ry that is formulated in cognitively graspable and phenomenally representable relations to the other. It is finite history only as a parting from itself as phe- nomenology and morphology, from itself as the aesthetics and logic of histor- ical relations. Only where it itself-as, for example, in Valery's text-is relin- quished to the dephenomenalizing, deaestheticizing, anamorphizing, or amorphizing withdrawal of its relation to the other; only where it is exposed to the other in its alteration and virtual unreadability, and where it is exposed to its own relation as a dwindling one, does it begin to free itself from the on- tological primacy of form and from the epistemological primacy of a presenting cognition, and thus to enter the field of its finitude. The reference to the other is then no longer to be thought of as a communicative exchange in the medium of a common share in a formative principle, no longer as a securing of the self against the loss of the other and no longer as a preservation of the other in the refuge of its presentation; rather it is to be carried out as a parting from the other as its own and appropriable, as an interruption of the circle of commu- nication and as an imparting of that division which separates the other not only from the self but even from itself. An imparting of division that does not stop dividing the other-self, history would always be at the same time the decomposition of the limit that severs self from other in order to give them a form; it would be the decomposition of the morphological principle of the "as," through which-whether apophantically or hermeneutically-the other as other, the name of the other-for example "Mallarme"-as this name can be encountered; and history would be the decomposition-the apriori, non- historical, and anything but organic decomposition-of itself as the placeholder of the principle of the other-self, of the "As" and of the mediation between one and another self. History would be the event of the di-stancing, the de-parting of the other: of the self of history. The with-drawal of history-a move in a game that history does not dominate and in which, for example in</page><page sequence="20">86 Yale French Studies Valery, history is on the point of being lost: "...et tous les sorts jetes / Eperdument divers roulant l'oubli vorace . . ." The with-drawal of history does not mean that history is the past, rather that it passes away; not that it is lost and forgotten, rather that it is on the point of becoming lost and forgotten without ever being lost and forgotten. History is written not in the perfect tense, but in a hypothetical futurum exactum: it would have been. As it is always already, in more or less explicit ways, on the point of being lost in an uncontrollable game, no longer itself and not yet nothing, it is thus never what is itself present or what could ground the present of the self. The thirteenth section of La Jeune Parque, a short meditation on pr6- in all its variants, combinations and meanings (apprets, pres, pr6tendre, supreme, prete and presence) and thus a sort of elegiac prelude to Ponge's Fabrique du PrM, allows no doubt that no presence corresponds to the future of presence and that the historical delay that precedes it is absolute: [l'ame] Prete a s'6vanouir de sa propre m6moire, Ecoute, avec espoir, frapper au mur pieux Ce coeur,-qui se ruine a coups myst6rieux, Jusqu'A ne plus tenir que de sa complaisance Un fr6missement fin de feuille, ma presence ... Attente vaine, et vaine ... [I, 107] History is 6vainement, as long as it is tied to the hope that it could be the arrival of a present-even if it be in the quivering of a leaf. Pr6sence, according to the logic of this text, is always pr6-sence-in advance of itself and therefore always too late for itself; a future that withdraws as death from every living experi- ence, and that precisely as with-drawal of this death, as "death" of "death," grounds an experience of the self that is not the living experience and awareness of its transpiring present and not the transformation of death ac- cording to the image of its life. History is event as the experience that presence fails to arrive, that my presentness is inaudible and my writing is effaced-in it is not encountered "Un fremissement fin de feuille, ma presence . . ." rather in it is asked "quel fremissement d'une feuille effacee / Persiste .. ." (I, 96). The thematic form assumed in Valery's text by this failure of presence to arrive is the tear, weeping. "Attente vaine, et vaine . . . Elle ne peut mourir / Qui devant son miroir pleure pour s'attendrir" (I, 107). Valery's lifelong con- cern with the problem of the self, of reflection, of the mirror, of Narcissus, was always closely linked with the problem of the melting, dissolution, and expen- diture of the self, with the problem of weeping. To be reflected in a mirror means to become visible to oneself as an other and as mortal. To see oneself is to see oneself dying. One of the fragments from "M6lange, " "Avec Soi Seule, " whose third section deals with tears, formulates the following in its second section under the titles "Narcisse":</page><page sequence="21">WERNER HAMACHER 87 Is not looking at oneself in the mirror the same thing as thinking of death? Doesn't one see in the mirror one's perishable part? The immortal sees there its mortality. A mirror makes us step out of our skins, out of our faces.-Nothing can hold out against its double.-Repeat three times what you have said. [I, 332] The paradoxical logic of the encounter with one's own mortality in the Dop- pelganger implies, though, that whoever has externalized himself in his repeti- tion, precisely because he is thereby an other and because he views himself in this other-and only in it-dying, cannot himself die. The ideal medium of reflection, as in particular Valery's last text, the prose poem "L'Ange," makes clear, is therefore tears: externalizations of the I, they are, like language, the presentation of the I as a finite being, and at the same time liquidation, decom- position of precisely this presentation. The tears of Narcissus are the source in which he finds and in which he loses his death at the same time as his immor- tality. In tears, the self as mortal is projected and slips away. They suspend life as well as death. Tears never come on time. As original self-affecting, they are the bodily linguistic gesture in which time is first engendered. Tears separate the I from itself and contract it with irreducible delay into itself. The time of tears is the time of delay in the self . . . and the time of the delay of tears themselves: the I always comes too late to experience them, they are always already there before the I can experience and question them, and they always come too late for an I that hopes to experience itself in them. The Parque calls the tear "Tres imminente" in her long apostrophe in the tenth section, shortly before the shipwreck of the name: Je n'implorerai plus que tes faibles clartes, Longtemps sur mon visage envieuse de fondre, Tres imminente larme, et seule a me repondre, Larme qui fait trembler a mes regards humains Une vari6t6 de funebres chemins;l1, 104] Already long there and eager to flow, the tear-this allegory not only of tears must be implored to impart its light, however weak, to the face of the Parque. The only partner in a possible dialogue- "seule a me repondre"-this tear is a figure of precisely the request or the prayer that is directed to it-implorer literally means "to beseech in tears" and is closely related to pleurer-but is a figure of that speech which, itself figurative, first has to implore it, first has to ask for it weepingly-a speaking that comes ahead of speaking, and, since in speaking it does not yet speak, is a mere promise to speak, a coming to speak and to cry without ever arriving, without the tear itself responding (later it is called "muette l'eau"), the trait of a language without response and without correspondence. It is this trait of a constitutive delay that does not permit the tears to come to light, to come into appearance or language . .. that does not let language</page><page sequence="22">88 Yale French Studies itself come to language, which Valery emphasizes in the following lines with the word and sound groupings around trait and tais, where the whole paradox of muteness and speech, of coming and not coming to become a tear is un- folded. After calling the tear "goutte contrainte" and "distraction de mon suc pr6cieux," the Parque continues in her apostrophe: D'oii nais-tu? Quel travail toujours triste et nouveau Te tire avec retard, larme, de l'ombre amere? Dans le temps que je vis, les lenteurs que tu fais M'6touffent ... Je me tais, buvant ta marche sure ... -Qui t'appelle ... 4I, 104] The distraction of the trait avec retard-the delaying withdrawal-of the tear, which takes up the entire time of a life and according to which the time of this life is measured, deprives the I of breath and speech: "M'6touffent. . . ." But however great the delay may be that lets language stall in the points de suspen- sion, these dots mark simultaneously the arrival of the tears and with this arrival the stalling of language once again: " ... Je me tais, buvant ta marche sure. .. . " Not yet arrived, the tear chokes language ... and arriving makes it fall mute. . . . The sole site of language, the site, on which the tear-and with it language-comes to language, is that between its delayed coming . .. and its arrival; but this single site is exactly where language is interrupted and con- tracts into the graphic marking as the remainder or the beginning of language. But the graphics of distraction is at work not only in the interval between delay and arrival that is marked by the points de suspension, but likewise in the statement that concerns this delay and this arrival itself: they are both log- ically untenable, for to say "les lenteurs m'6touffent" and "je me tais" in the present tense also always means: choked, I still speak and speaking, I am already silent. This difference between stating and saying, between the cog- nitive meaning and the operation of language that is opened by the movement of its distraction, assumes in the next line the shape of the alteration of the I, in the question "Qui t'appelle"-for it was precisely the Parque by whom the tears were summoned, and it is now, in the presence of this question, no longer the same Parque who asks about the origin of the summons. It is the work-or the game-of this internal separation of the I from itself, of the not yet from the no longer of speaking and of the operation of language from its meaning-and from the meaning of this operation as operation, from the meaning of meaning as meaning-it is this work of the distraction of language, that is "done" and "meant" by the tear. But since the tear itself as a linguistic figure and as a figure of speaking is cited, what happens in it is the distraction of the tear as theme, as word, figure, and bodily linguistic function. The tear-distraction of the tear. The language-of language. Larme, the movement of the tear's distraction, is not a word. It is the trait in which the possibility of the word announces and withdraws itself. It is not a word for a figure or a thing, rather the way in which a name, partially and</page><page sequence="23">WERNER HAMACHER 89 mistakably, is intimated and effaced. "Senti monter/larmes de 1'esprit"-this marginalia to the early draft "Stephane Mallarme mysterieusement" may des- ignate an experience in the writing of this draft, may also have been intended for inclusion in this draft; in any case it contains a deformed reminiscence of the name of the one for whom this draft was destined. This intimation of a connection between Mallarme and larme becomes clearer in one of the first working notes for La Jeune Parque from the year 1913, preserved on the second page of the first bundle of manuscripts of La Jeune Parque, in which the con- nection between larme and the abyss of language is established that later leads to the evocation of the shipwreck of the name: "mal-Larme-Sommeil- animal-O n'aurait-il fallu- Demi nue herissee-Terre rude-et mer- precipice-." "Mal," "larme," "animal," and furthermore "l'ame," "arme" are not only assonances of the name Mallarme, but likewise resonances and citations from the text of the Herodiade of which a few fragments cited in Huysmans's A Rebours established Valery's first acquaintance with Mal- larme, and the manuscript of which he found eight years later, shortly after the death of his fatherly friend, incomplete on his work table in his house in Valvins, in an "appalling shred of convulsed writing" (I, 26). That Herodiade, therefore, in which, from the first to the last line, Mallarme had treated the word and the problem of larmes in all its abundance: Abolie, et son aile affreuse dans les larmes Du bassin, abolie, qui mire les alarmes, Des ors nus .................... Une Aurore a ......... . choisi Notre tour cin6raire et sacrificatrice, Lourde tombe qu'A fuie un bel oiseau, .. .9 Whatever by means of this distraction of the name in the citation remains, distorted, deformed, disfigured, at the edge of the sea, is a residue of language and the name with which it is summoned. Not "Mallarme," but "larme." Not "la langue," but turbid earth "melee a l'algue." Not the measured course of the language of the I, but the trace of it in the sand.

Jean- Aubry (Paris: Gallimard, 1970), 41.</page><page sequence="24">90 Yale French Studies thinking of the trace, to forget himself-such a trace would be only the mark of a past presence, a constant sign that outlasts the passing away of a body, of language, a representative anthropomorphic form. Earlier drafts of these lines speak of such a trace: "Je retrouve l'empreinte sur le sable de mon d6sir / Comme le pied d'inconnu non abolie" and also "Les pieds vont, errent, ta- tent . . . le vide. / Leur empreinte reste sur le sable" (ms III, 132). Such a trace is no longer the subject at the end of the reworkings. That the reader will only think of himself when he finds the trace in the sand is beyond question; whether he will think of himself by forgetting the trace, or thinks of himself as the trace, makes no difference, insofar as his relation in both cases must be one of identification-be it with the trace, be it with himself. Only in the question of how long the reader will hesitate in his turn to the trace as trace or as himself, only in the question of the interruption of the as, the eclipse of the identity of the trace in the transition between the trace and its reading, does this trait of the trace come forward, not to be assimilated to any self, not to be identifiable, to be in delay. In the moment in which the reader encounters not himself and not the trace itself, in this moment of the interruption of the reading and of the historical-hermeneutical communication, the trace and thereby the ground of historicality withdraws. The possibility of history is tied to the endurance of the traces of what is past and their identifiability as such traces. Wherever this identification stalls, as it must-and that it stalls is the only assumption made with certainty in Valery's lines-it is all over for histo- ry as a self-reference incapable of being lost. History as the form of the return and the recognition of the self stalls, always stalls, in every moment in which the trace withdraws in the hesitation of the reader between the trace and the trace itself. By writing the stalling of their trace, Val6ry's lines are written from the perspective of their own unreadability. What happens in them, only deli- cately intimated, is their beginning in the departure from their history.

Mais qui pleure, Si proche de moi-meme au moment de pleurer?[I, 961 The double question with which La Jeune Parque opens is to be read as a dialogue between two questions or as a monologue of a questioning in two voices. The second question-to which the weeping, still linked in the first question to "diamants extremes," seems closer: "si proche de moi-meme"- makes the first into the subject of the question, into what weeps and into weeping-and thereby makes it into what this first question views as some- thing other and distant. But the second question contains no knowledge of the subject of the weeping, knows only that it weeps, but not who weeps-and can therefore, as it is related to the first question that lacks this knowledge, relate to itself as the weeping, whose source it does not know. Every question weeps and no question can know, weeping, the origin of this weeping. The poem is set up under the unspoken and unspeakable presupposition of the weeping, and it speaks until its end only of this weeping, without being able to fix it anywhere in a subject, a source, or an origin. From its beginning the poem is exposed to the end of the accord between its operation and its knowledge. It is written in the gap between what occurs in it and what it can know of this occurrence. From its first lines on, Valery's poem articulates the impossibility of a reduc- tion of its performative process to an agent that could be the object of its own cognition. The irreducibility of speaking to a subject that could grasp itself as this speaking assumes first of all in La Jeune Parque the form of the temporal difference in which an I does not say what it does but only what it is about to do; not that it weeps but "au moment de pleurer," on the brink of weeping. Furthermore it assumes the spatial form of the distance between the weeping and the one who hears it-it is respectively a "la, " with "diamants extremes, " or a "si proche de moi-meme"-this distance never contracts to the single unspatial point of a unity of weeping and hearing the weeping, even if at the same time the simplicity of the wind- "le vent simple"-and paradoxically the loneliness of the weeper are insisted upon. But more radical than the thoroughly ambiguous spatiotemporal difference in the sphere of appearance is the functional difference that separates language as occurence from language as the order of signification and cognition. In fact the performative and cog- nitive-semantic functions of language in Valery's introductory lines lie so far apart that it remains uncertain what even happens in them-and in all the lines of La Jeune Parque: a weeping or a speaking; so far apart that weeping and speaking become substitutable for one another and the endless series of meta- phors for tears, from sea to milk to starlight to snakes's poison . .. can be generated; and even so far apart that it not only remains doubtful whether what happens happens in language as a constituted organon of speaking, it is even doubtful whether it happens at all. In order to decide upon the occurrence of</page><page sequence="26">92 Yale French Studies weeping-or of speaking-the reader would require a hold in the structure of this occurrence itself that would allow him to immobilize it as the object of his cognition, a point in which occurrence and cognition would converge. Pre- cisely this reducibility of occurrence to its origin in a subject of cognition is categorically contested, however, in the double question of La Jeune Parque. Yet if the subject of weeping is indeterminable, then it is possible that the weeping is not weeping, but rather a questioning of weeping, and furthermore, that the questioning is no real questioning, nor questioning certain of itself and of what is in question; it must repeat itself and repeat itself virtually endlessly often in order to verify itself as a question: "Qui pleure la, . . . Mais qui pleure. . . . " Under the conditions of language's internal tear between occurrence and signification, all statements are structurally ironic: they speak without the possibility of being sure of this speaking and the reality of its objects. But wherever it has become undecidable whether occurring occurs-therefore whether history is history-whether language speaks and whether weeping weeps, then all language and every gesture becomes that emblematic bird which "Cent fois sur le soleil joue avec le neant, / Et brule" . . . , becomes a game with the possibility of the nothingness of speaking itself. Valery's com- ment on La Jeune Parque is perhaps to be understood in this sense: "In fact, the problem goes beyond the domain of literature. The mechanism of the mind, and what one might call the functioning of language, are at work here" (I, 1622). It is the functioning of language that becomes a problem whenever this lan- guage as a process can no longer become the object of its cognition. As its occurrence withdraws from its theoretical objectification, so does the occur- rence to which language refers as its metaphor: the weeping and its eternal return. These tears are no theme; they are, in a strict sense, unavailable to theory. There is no theory of tears, but only at best-and Val6ry's poem, any- thing but larmoyant, is a contribution to it-a teary . .. a theory that is itself distorted and deformed by the event whose traces it seeks to articulate. Valery's texts-and not only his-cannot simply be incorporated into a history of tears, as is offered by the histoire des mentalit6s and the histoire des 6motions that have recently succeeded the psychologistic historicism of the nineteenth century. And like the former, the history of ideas is based on the problematic conviction that historical changes are objects accessible to theory because they could in principle be read without doubt from the diacritical marks they leave behind in representations. Like every historicism, the history of ideas builds on the belief that history is organized as a process of the transfor- mation of a privileged paradigm, namely that of theoretical cognition. By thereby making its objects into more or less strictly coded metaphors of itself, it dehistoricizes history and orders it into the stable continuum of a great chain of being that finds its telos in the ideal of its transhistorical contemplation by the historian. No history of ideas of tears.... In it everything irritating that</page><page sequence="27">WERNER HAMACHER 93 could happen to thinking and language by the singular constitution of its subject would be wiped away, in order to engender the theoretical gaze that should be able to be touched by no history and should not itself be historical. But how would a reading proceed historically?-that is, historically in the sense that it would be a reading relating to the other as a finite other; that this historical relation in its specific finitude, singularity and materiality happens as this reading-and thereby is exposed to the game that does not stand under the rules of a history of self-consciousness? How, then, is reading historical? In the manner, for example, in which Valery in La Jeune Parque, and here in its opening lines, reads Mallarme. Here "Mallarme" is not simply ma larme or moi, larme, although the tear announced in the "Qui pleure la" is meant to be the tear of the speaking I, and although the "sinon le vent simple" is a prelude to that "Et le vent semble au travers d'un linceul" of the tenth section, in which the wind weaves together the dispersed name of Mallarme. In the first lines, no differently than in the later ones, Mallarme is not named as a name from a positive history and in fact is not named as a name at all-and yet in this rewriting of the early "tombeau" draft, he is still evoked in its disfigured and transformed remainders. This unnamed name is evoked precisely in what is apostrophized in the naming language of the poem as a never-present object of the theoretical gaze: as larme in delay and as event of language that withdraws from its meaning. This larme is the now material relic of a name that enters Valery's text as an occurrence only by simultaneously withdrawing as an ob- ject of knowledge. As the privileged site of this with-drawal of a name and the suspension of the history of knowledge, Valery designates with the opening words of La Jeune Parque, "Qui pleure la"-the only words that remained constantly the same through hundreds of alterations of the text-his own anagrammatically disarranged name, suspended as a question: Pqule Valeri. "Qui pleure la"- Pqule Valeri-asks after the origin of ". . . larme," without being able to un- derstand its "own," disowned, and perhaps feminized occurrences as the scene of the with-drawal of this "name," as the scene of its distraction and decom- position. La Jeune Parque is signed by-at least-two names playing around each other, anamorphizing each other and failing to meet each other. One "name" signs another-Pqule Vale]ri signs ma larme and med lame ra. Their reciprocal expropriation is the event that is played out in it as the withdrawal of the autonomous shapes of knowledge and its history. Each of the names re- peats itself in the other, but since each is reachable and incomparable to itself in the other, their repetition is only the return, the virtually infinite return of what is not the same. The historical reference to the finite other is in the strictest sense of the word the parody, the para-6d e of its name, of its memory and its grave. The history of tears has from the beginning played and lost in this parody and-Nietzsche takes part in this play, and another part of Valery's name-has become the unclosable circle of laughter:</page><page sequence="28">94 Yale French Studies De toujours reparaitre incomparable et chaste, Et de restituer la tombe enthousiaste Au gracieux 6tat du rire universel.[L, 106] Or as the ideal reading of La Jeune Parque, the parody La Jeune Carpe by Jean- Luc Nancy, puts it: Qui recite ce chant, si simple, et qui l'imite, Insoucieux de s'y dissiper? ...
