(Arbeiten zur Geschichte des antiken Judentums und des Urchristentums.) Leiden: E. J. Brill, 1978. 140 gld. This is the first time that the theme of God's grief and lamentation, which often appears in rabbinic literature, has been studied in its own right. After a summary of the work of other scholars on the subject,</page><page sequence="2">182 REVIEWS Peter Kuhn sets out seventy-five texts, each with a detailed commen tary, giving other recensions of the pericope under discussion, its paral lei versions in other rabbinic texts, information about the masters who have handed it down, and close analysis and exposition of the text. This valuable exercise takes up over half the book. Any cause for human sorrow is cause for divine anguish too. The two destructions of the Jewish State and Temple, however, are most often cited as causes of God's grief (there are sixty-four instances of this in forty texts): otherwise, Israel's plight in Egypt and the death of Moses play an important part. Since the Destruction of a.d. 70 it is said that there is no joy before God: his continuing sorrow over his ruined Temple and exiled People is thus poignantly expressed. The texts show God full of pity (Mitleid) for Israel and directly feeling sympathy (Mitleiden)(Mitleiden) with them; they speak consolation for Israel, and show God's love and involvement with Israel in exile. But God cannot for ever remain in exile: he must 'redeem himself' and his people. Thus God's sorrow has a sort of revelatory character in many of these texts. The texts use strongly anthropomorphic language, which Kuhn examines in chapter 3. He argues that although the rabbis sensed the strangeness of the idea that God feels sadness and grief, they did not understand this language metaphorically. Neither was God's sadness taken literally; rather, it was understood as an ideal expression, a peda gogical means of setting out a highly abstract theology of divine partici pation in human affairs. The book closes with a study of biblical passages which speak of God's sorrow, and a comparison of biblical and rabbinic uses of the theme. Of interest here is Kuhn's discovery that very few of the biblical verses which deal explicitly with God's sadness actually appear in rabbinic sources interpreted of his pain, lamentation, or sorrow. The author's knowledge of the sources is undoubted, and the book's interest undeniable; unfortunately, however, the texts are treated quite uncritically. At the literary level, variant forms of a particular tradition are too easily presented as separate recensions. There is no systematic literary analysis of all the variant versions to discover whether an origi nal form may be discerned beneath the present differing versions. This uncritical view of the texts is most apparent in Kuhn's discus sion of the tradition-history of the sources (pp. 391-9). He accepts that the traditions derive from the rabbis named in the sources: hence his claim that, while the sadness of God is most prominent in Palestinian haggadah of the third century a.d., the roots of this theme lie in the first century, after the Destruction of 70. God's grief is thus taken by Kuhn to be a contemporary rabbinic response to the loss of State and Temple</page><page sequence="3">REVIEWS 183 (pp. 362-3, 392 ff.). But if he is correct in this, it is surely strange that only nine of the texts which he cites appear in Tannaitic sources, and Tannaim are quoted in only fourteen texts over all. Kuhn clearly senses the difficulty of this when he explains somewhat unconvincingly that Tosefta,Tosefta, Sifra, and Sifre to Numbers lack reference to God's sadness because of their almost exclusively halakhic nature. The only masters named in the Tannaitic material are R. Meir, R. Jose b. Halafta, R. Eliezer b. Hyrcanus (twice), and Samalyon. Are the traditions attributed to them historically authentic ? The question is not raised, nor do we hear of Jacob Neusner's form-critical study of the Eliezer traditions. Kuhn also passes over in silence works like 4 Ezra, 2 Baruch, and Ps.-Philo's Liber Antiquitatum Biblicarum, all of which reflect the theological questions raised by the events of 70, but scarcely touch the subject of God's grief. The usefulness of Kuhn's book lies mostly in its setting out of the sources and the commentary upon them. The author's largely uncrit cal view of the material, however, still leaves open the question of the historical origins of this theme within rabbinic Judaism. Robert Hayward</page></plain_text>
