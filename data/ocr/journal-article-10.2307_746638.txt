<plain_text><page sequence="1">Liszt's Les Pr ludes and Les Quatre Elimens: A Reinvestigation ANDREW BONNER When Liszt published his first twelve sym- phonic poems in the 1850s and early 1860s, his intention was to present a unified compilation of one-movement orchestral works with ac- companying programs. The apparent unifor- mity of this collection is deceptive, however, for the works are dissimilar both compositionally and programmatically.' This lack of consis- tency results from a conflict between Liszt's constant need to experiment compositionally during this period and his eventual desire to pro- duce an aesthetically and intellectually unified symphonic collection that would help him gain respectability as an orchestral composer. More- over, although Liszt first considered such a publication seriously in 1853 or 1854, many of these works were originally conceived in the previous decade. Liszt first used the term "symphonic poem" in 1854 to describe a new aesthetic that empha- sized equally the importance of both program 19th-Century Music X/2 (Fall 1986). @ by the Regents of the University of California.

More- over, the connection between the symphonic poems and their antecedents is not clear-cut, because virtually all of these pieces underwent a complex compositional evolution between their conception and eventual publication. Les Pr6ludes represents a particularly notori- ous case of a discrepancy between original func- tion and final intention, because the original source of inspiration seems to have been com- pletely different from that mentioned in the program. Liszt conducted the first performance for a benefit concert at the Weimar Hoftheater on 23 February 1854. Concurrently he had printed and distributed to his friends a program that described in vague terms the work's associ- ation with Alphonse de Lamartine's lengthy poem of the same name, from his Nouvelles meditations poetiques. This program appeared in a modified version as a preface to the printed score, published by Breitkopf und Hirtel in 1856.4 Recently uncovered evidence, however, confirms that Liszt first conceived this piece as an overture to four choruses entitled Les Qua- tres ElImens, settings of four poems by the ob- scure Provencale poet Joseph Autran. In the second volume of her official Liszt biogra- phy, published in 1894, Lina Ramann was the first to mention the connection between Les Prdludes and Les Quatre Elemens; she probably received her information from Liszt, or more likely from his mistress, Princess Carolyne Sayn-Wittgenstein.S According to Ramann, Liszt wrote the choruses and began the overture in 1844. He soon became aware of the feeble- ness of the poetry and put the work aside until 1854, when he needed a new orchestral piece for a benefit concert at the Hoftheater in Weimar. He then resurrected this neglected overture and "transformed" it into a symphonic poem based on Lamartine's Les Pr6ludes. Two subsequent biographers, Peter Raabe and Emile Haraszti, claimed that there was in fact no compositional "transformation" in- volved, only a retitling of the same work; thus the association with Lamartine was com- pletely artificial, and it distorted the original meaning of the piece by obscuring its source of inspiration.6 Raabe never presented in print the evidence for his conclusion; but a more de- tailed discussion survives in his unpublished notes in the Goethe-Schiller Archive in Weimar. Here Raabe showed the similarity of the principal themes of Les Pr6ludes and the Au- tran choruses, and he cited those places in the correspondence where an overture to Les Qua- tre El1mens is mentioned. Haraszti's primary discovery was some unpublished correspon- dence between Liszt and Autran that confirmed that Liszt had written an overture to Les Quatre Elemens. He also believed that the shared the- matic material of Les Prdludes and the choruses 2From early 1854 on one finds almost exclusively the terms symphonische Dichtung and poeme symphonique in the correspondence. In his unpublished notes in the Goethe- Schiller Archive in Weimar, Peter Raabe refers to the exis- tence of a concert program, dated 19 April 1854, that refers to Tasso as a symphonische Dichtung. Possibly Liszt was not the originator of this term, for two years previously, in a let- ter to Liszt, Wagner wrote of his intention to change the title of his Faust-Overture to Faust: ein Tongedicht ffir Orches- ter (Briefwechsel zwischen Wagner und Liszt, ed. Franz Hueffer [Leipzig, 1887], I, 190). 3The two exceptions are Heroide funebre and Ce qu'on en- tend sur la montagne. The former was originally intended as the first movement of the five-movement Symphonie re- volutionnaire. Although Liszt drafted all of the movements and Raff orchestrated at least two of them, the composer nevertheless abandoned the project in 1853 and later pub- lished HIroi'de funebre separately. Liszt's original subtitle for Ce qu'on entend before 1854 was Meditation-sym- phonie (cf. plate 3). This term appears on the earliest surviv- ing manuscript score, in the early layer of the thematic cata- logue that Liszt compiled in 1853 and in Princess Carolyne Sayn-Wittgenstein's personal catalogue. In the correspon- dence he also called it the Bergsymphonie. Despite the claim of Alexander Main ("Liszt after Lamartine: 'Les Pre- ludes'," Music and Letters 60 [1979], 137), based on an error in Milller-Reuter's Lexikon der deutschen Konzertliteratur (Leipzig, 1909), p. 294, Liszt never used the name Medita- tion-symphonie in reference to Les Preludes. 4Miller-Reuter (Lexikon, pp. 294-301) prints both versions as well as two additional, unrelated versions, one from an 1855 performance in Berlin, the other written by Hans von Billow for an 1860 performance in Prague. 5Franz Liszt als Kiinstler und Mensch (Leipzig, 1880-94), II, 304. 6Raabe, Franz Liszt, 2nd edn.

More recently, Alexander Main has chal- lenged this view.7 Although he concedes that an overture to the choruses as mentioned in the correspondence must have existed, he main- tains that Raabe and Haraszti did not succeed in presenting a single bit of documentary evidence to prove that this was the same work as Les Pre- ludes. Indeed, Raabe's standard catalogue of Liszt's works mentions no orchestral score bearing the title Les Quatre ElAmens; nor is there any letter or document that states explic- itly that the title was changed. Like Ramann, Main believes that Les Preludes is a transforma- tion of an abandoned work. Main insists, how- ever, that this transformation must have repre- sented a radical revision of the missing overture, because it seems closely to parallel the structure and the sequence of poetic images found in Lamartine's poem.8 The overture may have provided some thematic material for Les Prdludes, but it could not have shared the same form or the same poetically inspired details. In- deed, in Main's view the parallels between Liszt's and Lamartine's Les Pr6ludes preclude the possibility that the music for the sym- phonic poem was composed prior to its associa- tion with its programmatic model. Although Main's conclusion is well argued, it is incompatible with the evidence I have found in the Goethe-Schiller Archive. The doc- uments suggest that there was only one orches- tral work, which underwent a gradual transfor- mation from the overture for the Autran choruses to the symphonic poem as we know it today. Although this piece progressed through many compositional stages, the changes seem not to have been primarily the result of its even- tual association with Lamartine's poem. The exact nature and significance of this transfor- mation can only be understood by studying the entire history of the work from conception to publication. Indeed one reason the issue has re- mained unclear until now is that no one has at- tempted to present a detailed history of Les Pre- ludes based on the surviving sources. The difficulty of such an undertaking is that, as with all the orchestral works of this period, this piece went through a complex series of stages from its earliest version as an overture to its final version as a symphonic poem. Since not all the sources survive, it is not possible to docu- ment each of these stages. Viewed collectively, however, the orchestral works provide enough comparative evidence of Liszt's compositional process to allow us to hypothesize about the nature and significance of missing sources and thus provide a more complete history of the work. This method has been helpful in recon- structing the initial events in the composition of the work, including its sketching, drafting, and orchestration. In addition, it has aided me in establishing the order of events in Liszt's de- cision to change the function and title of the work. Table 1 is a chronology of the history of Les Pre- ludes / Les Quatre tElmens. For the sake of clar- ity this table has been divided into three peri- ods: (1) the "Autran Period," when the overture and choruses were composed, the choruses or- chestrated, and the overture still associated with Autran; (2) the "Raff Period," when the overture was orchestrated by Joachim Raff; and (3), after a hiatus of three years, the "Lamartine Period," when Liszt revised the piece and even- tually associated it with Lamartine. While the early history of the overture re- mains problematic, the genesis of the choruses themselves is relatively clear-cut, due to the survival of the manuscripts and to Haraszti's in- vestigation of contemporary newspaper ac- counts.9 Liszt met Joseph Autran during a visit to Marseille in 1844, when the latter presented Liszt with his poem, Les Aquilons. Liszt imme- diately set the poem to music, and the new work was performed a few days later by a local chorus, with the composer accompanying at the 7"Liszt after Lamartine: 'Les Prel1udes' " (see fn. 3). 8Main implies a compositional situation similar to that found in Liszt's Die Ideale, where the sequence of the music follows the poem, stanza-for-stanza. Here the published score has the appropriate verses printed above the corres- ponding sections of music. In Main's analysis the order of two sections of Lamartine's poem is reversed in the sym- phonic poem. A similar reversal occurs in Die Ideale. More disturbing in Main's analysis is that one significant theme is unaccounted for (the E-major theme for horn quartet), and that the "transitions," which are clear, discrete sections in Lamartine, are not always so clear in the symphonic poem, except insofar as Liszt is always concerned to make smooth and gradual transitions from one section to the next con- trasting section.

The following year he received three other texts from Autran, La Terre, Les Flots, and Les Astres, and he set them to music while on tour in the Iberian Peninsula. The manuscripts of the unpublished cho- ruses are in the Goethe-Schiller Archive. Two of them, La Terre and Les Flots, are dated 1845; the former was written in Lisbon and Malaga, the latter in Valencia. Although all four poems are based on a similar literary conceit, Autran subsequently published them in different col- lections.'0 It seems possible that it was Liszt's idea to group the poems together and to title them Les Quatre Elkmens. These manuscripts are in piano or short score with occasional or- chestral indications. Whether or not Liszt at- tempted to orchestrate these works at that time is not known. Sometime in the late 1840s Liszt invited the composer August Conradi to Weimar to be his personal assistant." Besides copying, his chief duty was to orchestrate various works for Liszt. These orchestrations, including the earliest of the overture to Tasso, survive in three bound volumes in the Goethe-Schiller Archive (mss. B20, B21, and B22).12 Two of these volumes, B21 and B20, contain two consecutive attempts to orchestrate the Autran choruses in conjunction with five other short choral works. The second orchestrations, contained in B20, seem to be a reworking of the material based on Liszt's sug- gestions. Conradi dated the reorchestration of Les Astres 14 April 1848. These volumes con- tain only the orchestral parts, not the vocal parts. There is no evidence that a subsequent neat copy was made, and it seems the choruses were abandoned compositionally from this point on. Since the earliest manuscripts for the over- ture do not survive and since Liszt was always noncommittal in writing about the early his- tory of the work, it is impossible to establish precisely when he started the overture. Three conflicting and somewhat unreliable sources have provided our only evidence so far. The first of these is a small leather-bound notebook, Z18, which Raabe refers to as the "Verzeichnis der FiHrstin" ("Princess's Catalogue"). This is a per- sonal list that Carolyne kept during her stay in Weimar of all of Liszt's newly composed works. In the opening section labelled "Juin 1848" she lists an "Ouverture des quatre E16mens." In his catalogue of Liszt's works Raabe quite rightly interprets this date as a terminus ante quem since several other works included in this sec- tion were certainly written before 1848. (It should be added that this catalogue contains many inaccuracies; for example Carolyne has included under the rubric "Liste cat6gorique des ouvrages 6crits ou refondus depuis Juin 48 jusqu'au Juin 53" works that Liszt never com- pleted, such as the Symphonie revolutionnaire and Sardanapale.) Another clue, unknown to Raabe, comes from an unpublished letter from Liszt to Au- tran, which was discovered by Haraszti.'3 In this letter, dated 7 August 1852, Liszt thanks Autran for sending him his recently published collection of poetry, Poemes de la mer. In pass- ing he mentions their previous collaboration: Do you remember having entrusted four texts to me in Marseille? Les Flots, les Bois [sic], les Astres, les Autans [sic]? I completed the music a long time ago and, while orchestrating them, the idea came to me to join a rather long overture to them. We will do something about it some fine day. Unfortunately, music does not come to life except in performance, and it is not always easy to gather the appropriate per- sonnel for this type of composition, which does not adapt well to most programs and concerts.14 'lLes Aquilons first appeared in La vie rurale (Paris, 1856), the other three in Tableaux et recits (Paris, 1856). Each of the four poems is a chorus spoken, in the first person plural, by the collective, anthropomorphic voice of all the mem- bers of a particular natural entity. Thus in La Terre the trees of the world speak in one voice, in Les Flots the waves of the ocean, in Les Aquilons the north winds, and in Les Astres the stars. Each group makes its observations, both as a pas- sive and active participant, on the earth and its human in- habitants. The title of the collection is based on the fact that these four natural entities are representative of the four an- cient Greek elements. "G. R.

(This is presumably the basis for the date that Humphrey Searle provides in The New Grove.) Apart from the possibility that he had made some previous orchestration, Liszt's ref- erence is too vague to provide an absolutely firm dating. There is yet a third conflicting source for the date that must be taken into consideration, an article on Liszt's symphonic works written by Richard Pohl in 1859 and later included in his 1883 collection of essays entitled Franz Liszt: Studien und Erinnerungen.is Pohl, whose wife was principal harpist in the Weimar court or- chestra at the time of the premi"re of Les Pre- ludes, was an active music critic in Weimar and knew Liszt personally. Pohl probably received most of his information from Liszt himself. He writes that Liszt began Les Preludes in 1845 in Marseille and finished it in 1850 in Weimar. Al- though Pohl does not mention Les Quatre Ied- mens (information that Liszt may have sup- pressed), it will become clear that the reference is to the Autran overture. With this in mind there are no real grounds for doubting that Liszt started the overture as early as 1845. The 1850 date of completion surely refers to the time when the overture was first orchestrated by Joa- chim Raff. Part of the confusion about the date of com- position may stem from the length of time that possibly elapsed between the work's inception (i.e., the initial sketches) and the first complete orchestration. An investigation of the other symphonic poems of the period for which early sources survive reveals that most of them devel- oped over a long period of time. The most sub- stantial source of evidence for this initial com- positional procedure in the symphonic poems comes from the nine surviving sketchbooks from the 1840s and 50s. These books can be roughly divided into two partially overlapping categories: those in which Liszt jotted down melodic fragments and harmonic ideas (e.g., N1, N6, and N8), and those in which he drafted complete pieces, or substantial portions thereof, in short-score format (e.g., N2, N3, N4, N5, and N7). Some of these books may have been used for convenience during Liszt's con- cert tours and extensive travels. N1, of the first type, from 1846-47 (or possi- bly as early as 1845) contains thematic sketches of Tasso, Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne, Festklidnge, and several movements of the Sym- phonie revolutionnaire, including Heroi'de fun bre.16 The sketches for Tasso are not new material, but rather various thematic transfor- mations and motivic derivations of an old gon- dolier melody written to fit the opening lines of Tasso's Gerusalemme liberata. Similar sketch- es probably existed for the overture to Les Qua- tre ltrlmens, whose melodic material is derived exclusively from-yet never quotes directly- the previously composed choruses.17 The first draft of the overture is also missing, but proba- bly consisted of a two-to-six staff short-score with brief written directions for orchestration. About eight such short scores survive, some in sketchbooks, others in loose gatherings. There is some evidence that the actual draft- ing process was generally very quick. For exam- ple, Liszt marked on the 1849 draft of Hroi'de funebre (Paris, Bibliotheque Nationale, ms. 158) that he completed the entire draft in two days. The gap of time could be large, however, between the melodic sketches and the short- score draft. In the case of HMroide funebre this was probably about two years, since the me- lodic sketches survive in N1. Moreover, there could be an additional hiatus between the short score and the initial orchestration: the first or- chestration of Tasso dates from 1849, almost two years after Liszt wrote out the first draft.'8 In almost all these works we encounter the '5(Leipzig, 1883), p. 221. 16This dating is partially based on the presence of the Tasso sketches that predate the first draft of Tasso contained in the N5 sketchbook. This draft is dated 1 August 1847, and not 1849, as stated in Raabe. '7This thematic paraphrasing is an extension of the princi- ple of thematic transformation, which forms the basis of his construction of the overture. Neither the choruses nor the overture was intended to have the definitive form of any given theme. '8The orchestration, contained in B22, is by Conradi and was prepared for the Goethe Centennial Festival that took place on 24 August 1849 for a performance of Goethe's Tor- quato Tasso. The fact that Liszt resurrected a previously drafted composition for this occasion (see fn. 16) may help to explain his later admission in the 1856 published preface that the work had been primarily inspired by Byron's poem, The Lament of Tasso, rather than Goethe's play, for which it was supposedly written. 100</page><page sequence="7">ANDREW BONNER Liszt's Les Prludes same compositional sequence: initial melodic sketching, drafting, and finally orchestrating. It is reasonable to assume a similar order of events in the case of Les Preludes / Les Quatre Elemens and that, as elsewhere, these stages were sepa- rated by gaps of time. Although such indirect evidence does not provide a specific date, it tends at least to support Pohl's claim that the work had a lengthy gestation. The earliest surviving manuscripts for the overture date from late 1849-early 1850, or what I have called the "Raff Period." There is no evidence that the overture was ever orches- trated before the arrival of Joachim Raff, who re- placed Conradi as copyist in 1849. At the begin- ning of 1850 Raff wrote a letter to his friend and confidante, Kunigunde Heinrich, in which he enumerated his many projects with Liszt, in- cluding a complete orchestration of the over- ture to Les Quatre Elemens.19 Until now this or- chestration has never been identified. It survives, however, as ms. A3c in the Goethe- Schiller Archive, although Raabe listed it merely as the earliest manuscript of Les Pre- ludes in an unknown hand. There are two rea- sons for this confusion. The first is that Raff's handwriting changed radically during his stay in Weimar, to the point where Raabe some- times misidentified it in his catalogue. A care- ful comparison of all the Raff manuscripts re- veals a logical chronological succession. I have divided the Raff manuscripts into three basic handwriting types. Each of these fits into an ap- proximate time period based on corresponding dated manuscripts (see plate 1). A3c is in what I have called the Type I hand, which places it be- fore 1853. The second point of confusion is that the manuscript has only the title Les Preludes, written by Liszt on the cover of the first bifo- lium in red pencil. The explanation of this title and evidence for a more specific dating come from another source, the so-called Prometheus Sketchbook, N3. The majority of this small book consists of a short-score draft of the cho- ruses and overture to Herder's Entfesselte Pro- metheus. In the middle of this volume is a four- page correction in Liszt's hand to a score of Les Quatre El1mens (see plate 2). This is the only surviving source, orchestral or choral, that bears this title. The correction is cued to p. 25 of an orchestral score. This passage in N3 corres- ponds exactly to the music on pp. 25-26 of A3c, and the nature of the variants proves that it must have preceded A3c.20 What previous score could have existed with almost identical pagi- nation to A3c? The answer is surely Raff's rough draft of the orchestration. In his letters Raff usu- ally refers to a two-step process: orchestrating the work, then making a fair copy. Although most of these rough drafts are lost, ones survive for Prometheus, the Goethe March, and for two movements of the Symphonie revolutionnaire. The case of Prometheus is relevant because it closely parallels that of Les Quatre Elemens; moreover, all the sources survive (see table 1). Here the pagination for the rough draft, A5d, and the fair copy, B 16b, are identical. The work was orchestrated by Raff from Liszt's short- score draft in N3. Although N3 is full of verbal indications for orchestration, in more cases than not Raff chose to ignore Liszt's written in- dications. Liszt went through and made only corrections of tempo, dynamics and articula- tion in A5d. The fair copy thus represents Raff's instrumentation, with little or no input from Liszt. A similar sequence of events is probable in the case of Les Quatre Elmens. It is also quite certain that at the time he renamed the piece, Liszt went back, removed the title page (if there was one), and hastily wrote Les Prbludes in red pencil on the score.21 A3c must therefore represent the fair copy of the orchestration of the Les Quatre Elemens overture, to which Raff refers in his letter to Heinrich. Liszt seems to have put the overture aside for some years. Raabe mentions the existence of or- chestral parts in Jena, apparently copied from A3c, which would indicate that this version of the piece was performed or read through in a re- hearsal sometime before the work was revised in 1853. These parts are, however, lost. Evidence from another manuscript source, 214, indicates that the work remained essen- tially unaltered until 1853 (see plate 3). This 19"Franz Liszt und Joachim Raff im Spiegel ihrer Briefe," ed. Helene Raff, Die Musik 1 (1901-02), 389. 20For example, the viola figuration in mm. 4-5 of N3 (see plate 2) has been corrected by Liszt. Only the corrected ver- sion appears in A3c. 21Liszt also used red pencil when he revised the manuscript in 1853. 101</page><page sequence="8">19TH CENTURY MUSIC 70'! zr:_:iii-i~ii ~ iii -::-------::--?:::-':--::::::-:-: : iig- x:? 71i ~1'~ 111 ::_. .iijijiii jijijji:iiiiiii:-:::.:-.::::~~~iI:_:i --.::. ~ ~~-ii-::---;- ::_:--:-;::;::: :; ??: - _::.:~- c: ........ . . . . . .: :i, :~. -iii X Z -~i-ii~i:ii-i:-- itrvrwb r ':--: :.;-i~iiiiil---i- - ioe- 0#00,10`i~iii~i 40iiiiiiiii~ - ~ ~-iid~ ii-~~iiiii~R "ii`~~i~i .j-::::::::::::-: -::~:-- : "0, 1 . ii--~ii~i:i?Z :i -:_-:i:si:::-::?:: :?::::::: ~ i:~i~iii::: :':~j:-:-:::::::-: ::i-- aiii*4 4: 16 ,?::~~~-''~':- :- : Mili .::.: 101::":-: ':::::'- ~i'i:ii~: a.

Included here are all his orchestral works (since none had been pub- lished), that is, all the works considered to be autonomous orchestral compositions. The four incipits included on this page are of versions that were later superseded. The second incipit, which corresponds exactly to the opening of A3c, has a blank space where title should be. The implication seems clear: Liszt had removed any associations with Autran, yet had not de- cided upon or committed himself to a new pro- gram. The next source, A3a, falls chronologically between Z14 and the first recorded performance in 1854. It is primarily in Liszt's hand, but large sections were written by Hans von Bronsart, a composer, pianist, and conductor fairly promi- nent in Weimar.23 This manuscript is a revision of the 1850 version, seemingly done in great haste. It is apparent that Liszt went through A3c and divided it into those sections that needed extensive revisions and those that needed few or none. The latter pages he gave to Bronsart to copy, with directions for minor revisions; the rest he copied out himself. Liszt then collated the pages and gave them to Raff to copy. The result was A3b. It should be emphasized that Raff had little creative input at this point-or, 22The title page reads: "Catalogue thematique des oeuvres publies par F. Liszt 1853." The date was later crossed out and changed to 1855. The exemplar for this copy, presum- ably in Liszt's hand, has been lost. 23I am grateful to Rena Mueller for this identification. 102</page><page sequence="9">ANDREW BONNER Liszt's Les Preludes - - : .j Ei2. -:ii _i!)

Close scrutiny of Raff's hand in A3b reveals that it comes from two distinct chronological periods, for both Type II and Type III are repre- sented. The majority of the manuscript is of Type II, and thus stems from 1853 or early 1854. The Type-III sections, which include the open- ing bifolium and several paste-overs, date from late 1855 or 1856 and represent the minor revi- sions that Liszt made for the 1856 Breitkopf und Hiirtel publication. Of all the various stages of Les Preludes, only the A3a revision of A3c constitutes a major re- working of the piece. Although there were some subsequent alterations, the version in A3a is es- sentially the piece as we know it today. In re- writing the overture Liszt was primarily con- cerned with the proportion of the individual sections, the smoothness of the transitions, and the definition of the thematic material. An analysis of the opening section can provide a good example of the type of revisions he made throughout the piece. The introduction in the final version can be divided into two parts; the second section is a continuation and intensification of the first sec- tion. The music of the first part (mm. 1-19) is intentionally static and vague, both harmoni- cally and metrically. It opens with a quiet, reci- tative-like melodic statement for unison 103</page><page sequence="10">19TH CENTURY MUSIC ::-:-:::::i-: ::: -.-. :!-iii -. :-''i-l'i-i-i-i-i:iiiil--il- -.-.:: - --::_-- :-: - ~i:~e;:~i'?i;i:~-:ili::-:i:iii:i:::::i- miiiaii-iii~iii;i'?:il"i? iiziiiil'iii~i:ilii:i:iii:iiiiii ::' -:??::--:iiii- ---:.:.- -iii--:-;-i~-l::::- -I--i--lii_~---:ii i . -iji:.-::i: -i-i--:i--~n:~~:~:! :::.--:::::::M :" .,iiiiiiiii:iiiicisiisii:i:iil~~~i~~?zi "~"ii~.--:~.~~-3ai-~~~iiii- ;:- i-i-;::.:in-?,--~;?i: - .::. : -ii :::_:::-, ? . __ ~~'il;~-iii~i?-i~:::::::: _I:_--8:i:i:i-i~:i-:-:::.::i:--.i:ii--: : :_:i_: :::-::- _ B:::.i-:::-:: :::::i~~i_-i: ii-:_ii-:__ ::_- ::i~-ii?:?I.~:::"~::-:B::-:::: :: . .: ::: :: : : : :-- _- ::; :::: . . :_ ::-::-_ : :_ i_?i - : :-: i:: :: :?iiiii;iiiiiii?i?:i?:::'::???iiicr:i:i- i?'?'~?:i- :: I:: - --ii-i -: -: --'" -:-''-' -.:--..-.: i-iiii ii: -:: --- -'-:-:--::--- --- '?:-- -----::::- ::'l:-::-::-iiii:-::i:---il::: i:lr-:--l :::::---::: ~Br~`~:~-'li-:~ ;-; lil: :: 1::::i:: it:::: :::: : i :: : : 'ii~iiaiiiiliii R-?iiii~ii- i ~::i:~: :i:~_i:_-_i:ii-_--i:--i:iiii_:;i:-_i__-i :-:i_-_::_-:-_-~:__:i:i.::-::::l-i:::::- :.::',_i.::'~i~giI Fiiiiiii;i~liiaiiii i'~/i~ ii8iiii:iiiliiiiiiii iii: i:iir-i-i:-i:i-::i-:-i_--i.- tii'?:-::;i:ciiiiiriiiii ii"iii8ii:iii:i?Bi:i: i-~i :::??:_;::-I-:----:::::-:---s::-::?:i:l -::-- ?.iiiHii:i i~SF":i' i~_-i:-~i5~:~j~ :i:_ :::~:___ . ~:~-1-I~~-I -- .' ;;'::::::::':: "::.:::::::::: :::-:i--:- -.::...: :1- :: :?_ :-:I iiiiiii-i:i:i:i--i:Ii?i'i?;~?i:iiili:iii -_iii--iiiii:iiiiii :i?iii~iii:-iii:i-i-i:--::iiii:-?::;::ii :; li:::l-i-i-i:i:i:i:i i~i . -i?::':::::-'-- ---::----?:-- --: -:iii i::i:::::_i: :~~~~-i:i`n~i?;)iiiiiiii:-~iii~i-ii-isi :: __:::: __i:::: ::i-::-:':-::::: ::-::::--:::i:::-- :?::-::::i:-:-::::-:-:?:I--.: i-:-:_i~:ii--_~-::'liiii:iii:iiiii?-i- :-.-.. ::-::- :iii-i:i-i-iiiiiiiiii: i::iiiiiii?i- i_-i- .....:. -:::iiii -ili-?i i-_ -- -:ii ....- : ;i~;- .. - .-- . :::: : i _II.,?! - !::-I -.(: : :::i i: .:-.; Zi?iiiiiii-liiiiiiiii-:-:.:::: :::: ::: ::: .. :. :: ::: :... .: : ::: : : :_ -: .- :- :- -::-: _--:-: :- : : : :: : : : . - : ::: :::::: :::: ii:j-i:~?iiiiiiiiiiiii i:ii iiiiiiiii ii:?-iiiiiii i--- -:-i:i-i-i-i- . :--:__:: .:?::is'::_:i:::i::?;::::::::-::1:::::: :: : : : -i-: :::-:i:_i_::-_:: .:..:-.. :-:::::,:??-:i-i:i::ii.iiiiii~i-i ~ii~ iii- i ii: ii:i?i ' ii?ii-i- i:::~:_:iii :-:i:i: - : --:::--:-:~-i . , ::::-:_ -::: u: -_--.--- ::li:;l: ii i-i . i _:::~:: :~::::~~ ~-~:-:?u:::::;;:-:?:1:::j::::::: .:. : :;::::::_-::: n;2::":::::~-:i:':-:::-j::ji:::--:-:_:- -:::-:-: ---- : ::-: :: iii-siisiiiiiii-2:i:~ii:i~' r'iii`liii-i4i-i:~;itlxi~iiiiii~iii- il:li-i-iiiiiii i: i-ii: i- : ::i:::::-; -i: i!(:?_-i:--_:::: ::--i---i :: : :i:::: ::i--- : -.: - ? :;:-::--- ::- lil--:i~~c. ~~- ~:--(-~ I: . :i ii i-i---i-::--::-- - iiiii:iii:iiii :-:i -- iiii:i .~i ~-- - ~::~ :: 1: a-_tl " ii ;:i:i iiiiiil?:il:i's-::::?'-- I:: ?:-: iii:lli-~i-:i._:: - :~i? :i,-i-)i-'--a----:--:-i--:::i-i:i:i"-i ::::i::::::: :: :: ii: *L . -: :::;;::: : : :::~:~ :: i' .:.: i':--_?-~:;:-;?'~:: ?B?

Liszt creates a sense of rhythmic disorientation with the dis- placed metric accent and a sense of harmonic ambivalence with a melody that outlines suc- cessively the tonic, submediant, and mediant triads, ending with a half-cadence on V/II. The whole passage is repeated a half-step higher, ending with an augmented chord on F, which is transformed to a diminished chord on B. In the following section (mm. 20-34) the music begins to gain forward momentum as well as metric and harmonic focus. Liszt intro- duces a quarter-note ostinato in the winds, pro- viding a metric grid for the ensuing sequential repetitions of the theme (played here without the initial pizzicati). He increases the motion by continuing to reduce the theme, as it moves up- ward chromatically by sequence, until all that remains is the three-note motivic cell outlining the dominant-seventh chord. In m. 29 there fol- lows an extended statement of the melody in the dominant, providing a strong preparation for the final arrival in C major. As a whole, then, this introduction creates a continuous transition leading from the seem- ingly amorphous opening, with its displaced meter, irregular phrasing, and harmonic ambi- guity, through a very strong dominant prepara- tion, to the C-major theme (mm. 35-46) with its regular rhythm and phrasing, clear melodic profile, and definite expository character. On a linear level (see ex. 1) the whole introduction 104</page><page sequence="11">ANDREW BONNER Liszt's Les Prdudes A3c TI V - 1 A3a 38 mm. removed. "J ? , I '1a Example 1 consists of a chromatic-third ascent from E to G, and thus, in a sense, constitutes a structural upbeat to the C-major theme. The earlier version of the introduction begins and ends with basically the same music as the final version, but the overall direction is not as purposefully continuous and linear. The first section is essentially identical to the revised version (i.e., mm. 1-19) except that the basic meter is 6 rather than C.24 At the point where the wind ostinato enters, however, there are an ad- ditional thirty-eight measures, removed in the later version, but there is no clear movement to the dominant (see ex. 1). There is indeed a quick initial ascent to G as well, but the presence of the minor tonic weakens the arrival. At this point the G is prolonged by a descent into an in- ner voice from G down to D, then a chromatic ascent back to G. Just before the G is reached, the wind ostinato stops. There follow a series of metrically displaced chords, repeated twice, whose outer voices outline the Phrygian scale from G to G. The ostinato then recommences and the dominant is finally reached before the ultimate arrival in C major. The intention of these extra measures in the early version seems to be to prolong the sense of harmonic and metric disorientation of the first section. As a whole, the early introduction has a static and meandering quality, and lacks for- ward motion. Absent here is a clear drive to the dominant and, with the intermittent ostinato, a sense of steadily increasing metric stability. Only at the very end, with the final arrival on the dominant, does the earlier version attain fo- cus and direction. The differences between the two versions of the C-major melody are also significant (see ex. 2). In the later version the phrasing is regular, with a clear succession of two-measure phrases, dividing into two groups of six measures (al- though m. 40 is really an overlapping measure, serving as an ending to the first group and an up- beat to the second group). It is difficult to imag- ine this passage without the prominent coun- termelody, which adds a compelling rhythmic counterpart to the theme and provides the most distinctive version so far of the crucial Les As- tres motive. Liszt in fact did not add the countermelody until 1853. Thus in the early version the first distinctive statement of the motive comes with the E-major theme (corresponding to m. 56ff. in the revised version). Without the countermel- ody the C-major theme does not provide a moti- vic culmination for the preceding section. This effect is compounded by the undermining of the dominant preparation and rhythmic drive. Moreover, the phrasing in A3c is much more ir- regular, grouping into 2 + 4 measures and 2 + 3 measures (actually 4 + 8 and 4 + 6, since there 24The early version continues in 4 time straight through to the E-major theme, corresponding to m. 67 of the later ver- sion. 105</page><page sequence="12">19TH CENTURY MUSIC A3c 3.

Indeed, the melody in the early version seems much less a new, clear expository statement, but rather more a rounding off of the introductory section. The revisions in A3a in a sense constitute the "transformation" that Ramann mentions in her biography. We know that Liszt worked on A3a at about the same time he chose the Lamartine 106</page><page sequence="13">ANDREW BONNER Liszt's Les Preludes program, although the exact chronology is un- clear. The central question remains: could the revisions have been primarily the result of the new programmatic association? The answer is emphatically no. Although the revisions in A3a are substantial and interesting, they are not structural revisions of the type found in Ce qu'on entend sur la montagne, Hroi'de funk- bre, or Tasso, where Liszt added or deleted large sections or changed the sequence of the sec- tions, thereby altering the music's basic struc- ture. Alexander Main's chief argument for asso- ciating the music with Lamartine's Meditation is the similar sequence of events in both the poem and the music. Whatever parallels exist must be regarded as fortuitous and coincidental, because the same sequence of musical events existed when the piece was connected with Les Quatre ElAmens.25 Although Liszt's choice of Les Preludes was after-the-fact, there is one piece of evidence that suggests that his decision was neither hasty nor arbitrary: a list of titles of four French poems, made in 1846 or 1847 in the N5 sketchbook. The poems are Les Djinns and Ce qu'on en tend sur la montagne, both by Hugo; Les Haleines, whose author I have not been able to identify; and Les Prdludes by Lamartine.26 Such inventories are common in the sketch- books, usually representing titles of works planned or in progress. We know that Liszt had already started sketching Ce qu'on entend at this time. In the N4 sketchbook I have found a short sketch from the early 1850s, entitled Les Djinns. But an original piece based on Les Pre- ludes was apparently never written. Liszt even- tually found in the overture to Les Quatre EIk- mens a pre-existent piece of music that fit closely the poetic model he had been consider- ing for at least seven years. It is not hard to see why Liszt rejected the Au- tran choruses. Ramann says that he found the poetry feeble. Despite Haraszti's protestations, we can agree with that assessment. The same can be said of Liszt's music, which is not among his most inspired. Moreover, the overture, which is fifteen minutes long, is disproportion- ate in length to the choruses, which together last only twenty to twenty-five minutes.27 Without the choruses, the title, which re- ferred to four separate poems, ceased to have any meaning, and would thus have been unsat- isfactory as a programmatic reference. The La- martine poem was a felicitous substitute, pro- viding a unified poetic model that seemed to parallel the atmosphere and successive moods of the overture. Such a close marriage between music and poetic model was an aesthetic pre- requisite to Liszt's publication of his sym- phonic poems. Liszt's probable embarrassment that the pro- gram had not in this case determined the music might explain what seems to be a total suppres- sion on his part of the early history of the piece. Perhaps this circumstance inspired him to start work on Die Ideale, where the relationship be- tween text and music is stronger and more ex- plicit. Although Liszt's presentation of Les Pre- ludes may have obscured his original source of inspiration, his intent ultimately should be un- derstood as well-considered and sincere. To us, however, Lamartine's Les Preludes should serve only as a subjective description of a suc- cessful orchestral work and not as the prescrip- tive model for the music's form and content. 25The individual poetic images that Main sees in the sym- phonic poem are also found in A3c and thus could not have been inspired by Lamartine. A notable exception is the harp part, which was added in the A3a revision. To Main, the harp mirrors the many references to plucked instruments, most significantly the muse's lyre. It is perhaps arguable that once having recognized the accidental compatibility of the overture with Lamartine, Liszt would wish to enhance the relationship. A more straightforward explanation is that the Weimar orchestra did not acquire a regular harpist until 1851 (see Searle, "The Orchestral Works," p. 281). Another minor addition in A3a is the rushing string scales that begin the Allegro marziale section, which Main hears as the "voix du coursier" accompanying the "cri du clairon." Such a spe- cific poetic interpretation for this revision seems forced. Moreover, these revisions may have preceded the new pro- gram. 26This dating is made possible by the work that Rena Muel- ler has done on N5, a sketchbook that includes the first draft of Tasso; see Rena Mueller, Liszt's Tasso Sketchbook: Stud- ies in Sources and Chronology (Ph.D. diss., New York Uni- versity, 1986). 271If one takes Liszt's own words at face value (cf. p. 98) it may possibly have been problematic to program a work with male chorus and large orchestra. But this was more likely just an excuse. 107</page></plain_text>
