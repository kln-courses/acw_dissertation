STRAUSS ABSTRACT Current attempts to extend the concepts and theories of learning to social psychology do not adequately take into account the biases in learning theory inevitable from the fact that it is derived primarily from the study of lower animals rather than man. The current position of American experimental comparative psy- chology not only involves dubious and controversial philosophical and methodological commitments but is contrary to the anti-anthropomorphist stand of the psychologists themselves. The specific concepts and theories applied to the behavior of any species ought to rise inductively from the study of that species. Since social psychologists and, indeed, all social scientists are almost exclusively concerned with learned behavior, the ad- vocating that they borrow from psychology some of the fundamental concepts and "laws" of learning theory is not surprising. Recent proponents of this view include Murdock, Hallowell, Kluckhohn, New- comb, Morris, Doob, Gillin, Miller, Dollard, Murphy, Gibson, and Mowrer. To those social scientists concerned with the broader aspects of group life, learning theory may seem remote and inapplicable, but to those investigating the behavior of individuals and small groups the blandishments of learn- ing theory are understandably seductive. After all, if there are laws of learning which have been experimentally validated by methods much more precise than those which the social scientist uses, why not employ them as basic points of reference?- "learning is learning . . . whether it occurs in man or animal."' The rationale of the American experi- mental psychologist invites this type of bor- rowing. The avowed goal of the experimental psychologist is the understanding of hu- man behavior, although the vast bulk of his work, from which learning theory and concepts derive, is done with the lower animals. It is assumed that findings may be extrapolated with some modification to human beings. The intellectual justification involves several philosophical commitments. The purpose of this paper is to point out some of these commitments and their im- plications, with particular reference to their application to human relations. RETURN TO ANTHROPOMORPHISM? The dominant orientation of American experimental animal psychology is derived from a particular interpretation of the work of Darwin. It assumes continuity and unity in the animal world and conceives the differ- ences between all species as being differ- ences of degree only. This allows the psy- chologist to admit that human behavior is not exactly duplicated in the lower species while insisting that the differences are not qualitative and so do not require any funda- mentally new principles of explanation. Although most American experimental- ists take this for granted as the only possible interpretation of evolution, a great many Europeans and some Americans do not con- cur.2 The treatment currently accorded Lloyd Morgan and the famous canon which he enunciated in the 1890's throws an inter- esting light on the contemporary view and raises several questions. Morgan, in 1894, leveled devastating criticism at overen- thusiastic attempts to find resemblances be- tween the mental processes of humans and lower animals. His attacks upon anthropo- morphism, his criticism of the anecdotal method, and his insistence upon controlled observation have become basic tenets in 1 N. L.

Morgan's attack upon the attribution of human qualities to lower animals was epitomized in his well-known canon: "In no case may we interpret an action as the outcome of the exercise of a higher psychical faculty, if it can be inter- preted as the outcome of the exercise of one which stands lower in the psychological scale."' Morgan's canon is still referred to with approval by contemporary writers who use it as an instance of the law of parsimony or as a caution against anthropomorphism. Yet many experimentalists violate it in practice. The contemporary literature is replete with references to the appearance in animals of reasoning, abstraction, generalization, conceptualization, hypotheses, supersti- tions, neuroses, and so on. Sometimes such terms are used in quotes to indicate that the writer does not mean them literally; but that they are taken liter- ally by many there can be no doubt. What appears to have happened is that, while Morgan's canon has been verbally es- poused, it has, operationally speaking, been stood on its head. The unformulated ver- sion may be stated as follows: "Never inter- pret the behavior of lower animals in terms of relatively simple psychological functions generally admitted to exist in lower ani- mals, if it is at all possible to interpret the behavior in terms of superficially similar bur relatively complex psychological func- tions generally believed to exist only in man." In short, experimental psychologists today often attribute to lower animals the same complex processes attributed to them by those psychologists of the nineteenth century whom Morgan attacked. The evi- dence to justify this interpretation is ex- perimental rather than naturalistic and anecdotal, but it is not different in kind from that available to Morgan. The contemporary psychologist who, while he pays his respects to Morgan, has come full circle to take the position that Morgan so vigorously assailed, accom- plishes this feat by ignoring distinctions central to Morgan's thinking. Morgan, for example, carefully distinguished between what he called "reason" and "intelligence."4 By "reason" he meant behavior guided by ideational schemes and symbolic processes, and by "intelligence," adaptive behavior not involving such features. Morgan was well aware that animals were able to learn from experience and to solve certain kinds of problems, but he also insisted that reason- ing in the human sense probably does not occur in the infrahuman organisms. The contemporary psychologist has suc- ceeded in finding reasoning in infrahuman species not by uncovering new evidence but by redefining "reason" so as to equate it with what Morgan called "intelligence." Recent evidence of higher mental processes in lower animals merely demonstrates ex- perimentally what Morgan was quite willing to admit and what everyone knows: namely, that animals are capable of intelligent be- havior. Thus the current position is the re- sult of a semantic shift in which Morgan's distinction between reason and intelligence has been converted into a continuum, and qualitative distinctions between them have been ignored or denied. From the stand- point of the experimentalist, the behavior of the animal is merely a simple, and human reason a complex, example of the same phenomenon. Few psychologists have rejected Mor- gan's canon, though they should to remain consistent, for it and Morgan's whole scheme are essentially an attack upon their current point of view: Those who lay stress on continuity employ "inference," "reason," and other terms in a broad generic sense to include all phases of a slowly evolving process; those who insist on differentiation use these terms in a narrower specific sense to mark off the higher from the lower stages attained in the course of evolution. When the doctrine of evolution was winning its way to acceptance, it was natural that its 3 Lloyd Morgan, Introduction to Comparative Psychology (London: W. Scott, 1894), p. 53. 4These distinctions are paralleled by those of other early writers, e.g., Carr, Hobhouse, Herrick, and Hunter.</page><page sequence="3">274 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY advocates should employ every means at their command to strengthen their position and to emphasize the continuity underlying diversity of aspect. But now that the position is secure, and continuity is generally admitted, it seems desirable to mark off, by restriction of the range of use of the terms we employ, the stages of differentiation.5 The contemporary comparative psychol- ogist who refers with respect and approval to Morgan's canon generally believes himself to be well buffered against accusations of anthropomorphism and loose generalization, not realizing that the current position is not the only possible one or that it does not simply arise "inductively" from experi- mental evidence. He also does not realize that the current view is practically identical with that which Morgan so effectively criticized more than a half-century ago. CONTINUITY VERSUS LEVELS As indicated, the hypothesis of extreme continuity is not the only respectable and feasible one. Equally harmonious with the evolutionary hypothesis and with the em- pirical evidence, however gathered, is what may be called the "levels" or "emergent evolution" conception, which admits the existence of similarities in behavior in species at all levels but also emphasizes the emergence of new properties of organization or new levels of behavior in different species. In short, it assumes that "differ- ences of degree" also often involve or co- exist with differences of kind. The "levels" or "creative evolution" idea has its advocates both among philosophers and scientists. It, also, purports to give an answer to the ancient philosophical prob- lem of how new forms emerge from the old. One of its most vigorous and persuasive pro- ponents among American comparative psy- chologists is Schneirla, who states the case as follows: The principle of levels has come into cur- rent usage through a recognition of important differences in the complexity, the degree of de- velopment, and the interdependent organiza- tion of behavioral functions through the animal series. The evidently superior properties that appear on a new level of organization are ... functional properties arising from a new system of organization which differs in given ways from "lower" and "higher" systems.6 Psychologists who emphasize broad com- parisons of species rather than learning problems in one or two seem more likely to stress the "emergent" characteristics of the evolutionary process. Beach's conclusions that the control of sex behavior passes from the hormones to the cortex as one moves up the evolutionary scale is an example.7 European comparative psychologists seem to be much less committed than Americans to the postulate that "the cona- tive and cognitive processes of humans and other species belong on a continuum, vary- ing only in complexity."8 One can briefly summarize by saying that European com- parative psychologists tend to support Morgan's canon and the ideology behind it, whereas Americans do not. IS COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY COMPARATIVE? Because he is less favorably disposed toward the hypothesis of continuity, the European is more likely to notice and stress differences between the species and to be more concerned with broader and more in- clusive comparisons. He is interested in the animal per se and not so much for the light that animal investigations may throw upon human behavior. A noted Dutch psycholo- gist, Bierens de Haan, states the matter forcefully: Thus, every animal lives in his own world, differing from that of other animals, differing r Lloyd Morgan, Introduction to Comparative Psychology (London: W.

The knowledge of each animal's sensations and perceptions, of his feelings and drives, of his intellectual facul- ties and spiritual experiences, if any, must be regarded as the ultimate aim of the study of animal psychology.9 The American comparative psychologist's adherence to the dogma of continuity dove- tails with his "homocentric" interest in ani- mal data and with his tendency to stress the similarities rather than the differences among species. The American comparative psychologist is relatively little interested in broad comparative study and has been re- proached with justification for having virtually adopted the white rat as the pro- totype of the mammal. Beach, in a recent presidential address to the American Psy- chological Association, chided his colleagues for this and bemoaned the lack of genuine comparative studies.'0 Schneirla quite ac- curately notes that "the true comparative aspects of the science have been progres- sively minimized the more investigations have been focussed upon mammalian sub- jects and upon problems 'close to the human level.' "I, Though the comparative psychologist concentrates on certain rodents, chim- panzees, dogs, and an occasional pigeon, the logic of the argument for continuity might well lead him to study one-celled organisms, whose behavior is the simplest of all. The rationale for studying mammals be- cause of their structural similarity to human beings brings in qualitative considerations by the back door. The comparative psychologist's interest in extrapolating principles from animals to human beings would lead one to expect him to stress similarities between man and lower animals and to play down the differ- ences. This he does. If no a priori philo- sophical commitments were involved, the investigator would search impartially for differences and similarities and be equally content with either. It is of course obvious that real differences of certain kinds exist: dogs do not sing Bach chorales. Psycholo- gists readily admit this, but in the areas in which they experiment they do not admit any essential differences-whatever differ- ences jump to their attention they consider as "differences of degree only." If rats or chimpanzees or pigeons can be trained, cajoled, coerced, or tricked into acting like men, there is great joy in camp. The goal appears to be to get similarities at all costs no matter how superficial they may be. The experimental psychologist on oc- casion dwells upon some of the more out- standing differences between human beings and rats, but when he does he may indicate, as Tolman has done, that the differences are in the rat's favor: "Rats live in cages; they do not go on binges the night before one has planned an experiment; they do not kill each other off in war; . .. they do not go in for either class conflicts or race conflicts.... They are marvelous, pure and delightful."'2 One is tempted to infer that behavioral differences of the kind he stresses can be safely empha- sized in contemporary experimental psy- chology only in a joking manner. "When you say rats are not like me, smile, pardner, smile2!" LIMITATIONS OF EXPERIMENT The American psychologist tends to ac- cord a low status to nonexperimental obser- vations no matter how carefully made. The history of American comparative psychol- ogy shows a movement from anecdotal methods of proof to controlled observation and thence to experimental observation. The experimental method is peculiarly well adapted to the demonstration of simi- larities among species. When various types of animals are observed in their natural 9 J. A.

Tolman, "A Stimulus-Expectancy Need- Cathexis Psychology," Science, CI (1945), 166.</page><page sequence="5">276 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY habitat, the whole situation is relatively favorable for the observation of behavioral snd environmental differences. Placing mem- bers of these species in an experimental situation loads the dice in favor of the similarities. Kellogg has said: "Of special interest in the study of learning is the direct comparison of animals with humans.... When two mazes of exactly the same pattern are employed . .. the results show remark- able similarity."'3 As this quotation brings out, the experimental situation, by restrict- ing the opportunity of the human to use his capabilities and past learning, enables the psychologist "to point to the basic nature of the learning process and . .. its similar- ity in different organisms."114 In the experi- mental literature behavioral differences be- tween the species are, of course, noted and reported; but, because of the very frame- work of the experiment, differences come to be ignored unless they can be expressed as quantitative variations. Many European comparative psycholo- gists understandably criticize American ex- perimental techniques. They complain that the highly artificial laboratory situation prevents the animal from exhibiting his proper characteristics and misses many of the most significant aspects of his behavior.'5 They suggest in fact that the American psy- chologist often underestimates the behavior- al capabilities of animals simply because he does not bother to observe animals in nature. The European places considerable reliance upon careful observation of animals in natural settings as well as upon controlled but nonexperimental laboratory observa- tions. The almost exclusive emphasis on experimental verification is distinctively American. It unduly limits the sources of data and methods of proof. The criticism made here is not of the ex- periment as such but only of a particular biased use of it and of the tendency to allow one's enthusiasm for it to obscure the logic of evidence. Some critics have argued that the experimental method-as now used to buttress the "homocentric" view-forces both the animal behavior and the interpre- tation of it into a human mold. Thus Schneirla maintains: Abstractions are introduced from the human level and not really as developments arising inductively from the study of the animal's behavior and capacities.. .. Under the domi- nation of concepts introduced from another level, inductive procedures are minimized or even excluded, and experimentors tend to work on animal subjects and under experimental conditions that facilitate deductive patterns of thought.... Teleology may be avoided in the interpretation of results but anthropo- morphism is introduced on the ground floor.'6 The English investigator Russel puts his finger on the matter when he contends that the experimentor should bear in mind al- ways "the limitations of the animals and devise experiments which are simple, suited to its capacity and means of action, and within its power of perception."'7 This re- quires a thorough naturalistic study to pre- cede experimentation, the experiment being adapted to the animal, rather than the ani- mal to the experiment. Or as another British psychologist has recommended, "The ob- server tries to find out how the animal be- haves instead of torturing it into perform- ing what he intends."'8 The doctrine that data used as proof must be experimental leads to the arbitrary exclu- sion of rich sources of comparative data. This is true in making interspecies compari- sons whether or not man is involved-it is 13 W. N. Kellogg in T. G. Andrews (ed.), Methods of Psychology (New York: John Wiley &amp; Sons, 1948), p. 36. 14 Ibid. 15 As Tinklepaugh admits, "The information we secure in the lab tells us what the organism can do under given conditions and frequently how it does do it.

Salman, "Note on the Number Conception in Animal Psychology," British Journal of Psycholo- gy, XXXIII (1942-43), 217.</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE PSYCHOLOGY AND SOCIAL PSYCHOLOGY 277 particularly apparent in human-animal comparisons. Experimentalists undoubtedly do not choose the relatively simple animal subject for lack of interest in human prob- lems. It is probably unfair to accuse the ex- perimentalist, as is often done, of fleeing from the problems of human existence, for he is actually following a rigorous and well- thought-out plan of action. The experimentalist's position is based upon skepticism, with which one may well sympathize, concerning the value of mere rhetoric and endless debate. He often ad- mits the complexities of human problems but feels they cannot be grappled with until a firm foundation of empirically grounded theory has been built. The commitment to a roundabout ap- proach has led to the reproving of some of the more impatient brethren-mainly social psychologists-for applying findings to or experimenting with the difficult human sub- ject prematurely. Patience is advocated: science moves slowly but surely, and often indirectly, its wonders to perform. The ex- perimentalist sometimes consoles himself for the seeming remoteness and inapplicability of his findings to the larger human issues by reminding himself of this fact. HIGHER MENTAL PROCESSES The treatment accorded "higher mental processes" and "language" in contemporary comparative psychology illustrates its char- acteristic biases in an area of special interest to social psychologists. As already indicated, comparative psychologists have redefined terms like "reason," "generalization," "ab- straction," "concept," and "hypothesis" in such a broad way that these processes, by definition, must be found in lower animals and then are delighted when they find them! The concept of "concept" is illustrative. If an animal can be taught to discriminate, say, triangles from other shapes, he is said to have developed a concept of triangularity through abstraction of common features. "There is justification for declaring that the animal has formed a concept."'9 Since lower animals accomplish this readily without language, language obviously is not essen- tial. Defined in this way, the matter is either absurd or self-evident, since it has long been known that even the simplest organisms discriminate gradations of tone, color, tex- ture, taste, and temperature and make qualitative distinctions between the sexes, between species, and what not. Their very lives depend upon doing so. It has always been known that pets can distinguish be- tween chairs and beds and other distinctive- ly human artifacts. Experimental demon- stration of this was unnecessary. When human infants distinguish be- tween various types of stimuli, they are not usually credited with concepts. No one teaching geometry would agree that a pupil who could unerringly pick out a triangle had a concept of triangularity by virtue of that skill. If one did make this claim, it would be embarrassing to know how to describe what happens when the pupil learns about tri- angularity in the way required to pass examinations. The comparative psychologist's stretch- ing of the "concept" may be taken as an illustration of what has been done with a great many other terms ordinarily used to describe complex human mental processes. The social scientist finds himself in the awk- ward position of being accused of quibbling over words when he insists that the original and more specific meaning of the terms be restored. If the social scientist, for example, is disposed to be agreeable and concede that rats reason but then wishes to indicate that human "reasoning" is not exactly the same, he finds himself having either to coin a new word or add the awkward qualifier "hu- man." The semantic tactic involved here is that of cashing in on the prestige of imported honorific terms. The investigator first tells us the meaning of his borrowed terms as "operationally" defined for the laboratory. It is bad enough that he confuses matters by using human terms anthropomorphically, but, worse yet, he may then depart from his 19 W. Heron in Moss, op. cit., p. 272.</page><page sequence="7">278 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY own operational definitions and gratuitous- ly extend his findings to human behavior- which he does not investigate. The equiva- lence of animal and human behavior is thus brought about by a form of word magic rather than by genuine empirical compari- son. The psychologist sometimes responds to this line of argument by stoutly maintain- ing the indefensible position that definitions are arbitrary and matters of individual taste. Some argue, as Kellogg has, that it is unfair to compare men with animals on tests involving language.20 Others seem to deny that language is a form of behavior at all or regard it as an epiphenomenon or mere ac- companiment of "real behavior." Thus Maier writes: Because I believe in physical mechanisms I am not ready to concede that the term "reasoning" must be reserved for symbolic verbal reactions. "Symbolic behavior" is a respected concept in mentalistic psychology, but it reduces to equivalence in behavior when objectivity is demanded. The "verbal" part of the definition merely protects against en- croachment of animals on his most cherished process.2' Note that Maier uses a common tactic to discredit the critic who wishes to recapture language and the vocabulary of symbolic processes for the human race by calling him "mentalistic." This puts the critic on the side of the theologians and against science. Perhaps as good an answer as any to Maier is Morgan's remark: The psychologist is apt sometimes to smile when after the recital. .. of some anecdote of animal intelligence the writer exclaims "If this is not reason I do not know what reason is." As, however, in such cases the writer has him- self suggested the alternative, there is perhaps no discourtesy on the part of the psychologist in accepting it.22 CONCLUSION The social psychologist who imports the learning theory and concepts of experimen- tal comparative psychology into his field ought to be quite clear about what is in- volved. He should have a consistent orienta- tion with respect to such matters as those discussed above. He ought to be aware of what is involved in: the "degree-only" doc- trine of evolution; the dispute about an- thropomorphism among comparative psy- chologists themselves; the heavy emphasis upon experiment as opposed to other meth- ods; and so on. He ought to be especially well aware of the fact that there is serious question among the experts themselves as to whether present findings concerning a few mammalian species can properly be ex- tended to other nonhuman mammalians- much less to nonmammals or to humans. One may agree to the need for a firm em- pirical foundation for theories of human be- havior. However, in the light of these criticisms, one may question the wisdom of premature borrowing from learning theory. One of the most important criticisms of- fered within the field of comparative psy- chology itself is that conclusions and con- cepts should be inductively derived from the study of the particular species under consideration. This principle, applied im- partially, leads to the conclusion that con- ceptual schemes for the analysis of human behavior should arise inductively from the study of human beings. One may deny this principle and go on studying lower animals "homocentrically," hoping that eventually significant applica- tion to human behavior will be possible. Or one may adopt another alternative-as some social psychologists do-and force human phenomena into an alien conceptual scheme imported from the animal field. This results in labeling long-established facts with new names.23 The borrowed concepts in- evitably are used in ways which do violence 20Op.

Another conse- quence of the importation of concepts is the familiar eclecticism of textbooks. The learn- ing concepts are first paraded in solemn procession in the introductory chapters and pretty well ignored in later ones. Instead of this sort of procedure, if we follow the principle that conceptual schemes should be derived from the study of specific species, it should be possible to arrange the latter in an ordered framework which will emphasize evolutionary development and at the same time take the latest phases of the evolutionary process into full account. A comparative psychology based on this idea would be of great significance to social psychologists. Many of the problems of social psychol- ogy have to do with the socialization process in which complex adult behavior emerges from the simpler behavior of the child. The usual categorical assertion by the sociologist that the infant, like the lower animal, has no culture and no symbols is no more helpful for developmental problems than is the usual position of the comparative psy- chologist. A truly inductive comparative psychol- ogy should include the human species in its purview and should have as its central task "the solution of one of the most difficult problems in evolution by continuous proc- ess-that of the transition from animal be- havior to human conduct."24 In working out the problems of the transition from the primate to the human and the child to the adult, the social psychologist will have to devise his own concepts indigenous to the material with which he deals. In this sense social psychology becomes a part of com- parative psychology rather than its poor relation. INDIANA UNIVERSITY UNIVERSITY OF CHICAGO 24Lloyd Morgan, Animal Behavior (London: E.
