<plain_text><page sequence="1">From the twilight of cultural memory: the bumah in the mosques of central Oman Soumyen Bandyopadhyay Introduction Traditional mosques in central Oman do not have minarets; instead, a diminutive domed structure (cupola) surmounts the prayer hall. Known locally as the bumah, its physical form, as well as the appellation, is peculiar to Ibadï Oman.1 The paper here is concerned with this particular structure as it explores, investigates and speculates on a nexus of concepts regarding its formal origin, derivation and nomenclature. The Ibâdïs, in their mosques of central and eastern Oman, seem to have preferred this diminutive form to the towering minaret for the purposes of adãn, which some scholars have seen as reflecting the inherent simplicity and austerity of their philosophy (Eickelman 1987: 32). Others have seen the bumah as the product of a culture conditioned by subsistence economy. There were of course exceptions. Occasionally smaller mosques were devoid of such rooftop appendages (Bandyopadhyay 1998: 320 fig. 15.17). While mosques in cosmopolitan Muscat displayed the bümah (Bandyopadhyay 1998: 331 fig. 15.44),2 those in the Sunni-dominated coastal UAE (formerly Trucial Oman) were adorned with stubby minarets resembling the watchtowers of local defence installations (Kay &amp; Zandi 1991: pis on 84-87).3 This coastal typology continued into Bahrayn where detached square squat minarets were common (Donaldson 1999). The Wahhabi-influenced parts of al-Zãhirah quite often did not have a manara, or bumah at all (Peyton 1983 : 83 pl.), a condition also evidenced in the Wahhabi heartland in Saudi Arabia, where more orthodox believers avoided 'building minarets on the grounds that they are ostentatious and unnecessary1 (Hillenbrand 1991: 361; also King 1978 &amp; 1980: various pis). There are nevertheless countless examples from the Nagd and other parts of Saudi Arabia of staircase minarets which 'consist simply of a few broad external steps leading to a diminutive kiosk a little above roof level1 (Hillenbrand 1991: 361; also, King 1978 &amp; 1980: various pis). The latter, it appears, follows a practice prevalent in the first century of Islam, initiated by the Prophet's preference for a rooftop adãn. The bumah in Omani-Ibadï mosques is located 'generally though not invariably at the north-east corner (al- rukn al-sharqï al-nagdi)* of the prayer hall,4 thus appearing on the right-hand corner of the prayer hall façade facing the main courtyard (barh/sahn). Although their shapes vary considerably, they are always built with horizontal mud-brick or thin stone courses of diminishing circumference and finally rendered with mud or guss (gypsum), and have a triangular or parabolic aperture facing the roof terrace. The mtfaddin's access is from within the prayer hall, via a rung-ladder built into the corner and through a square roof hatch (Figs. 1, 2, 3 &amp; 4).

Since it served as a place for adãn, why does the name fall outside the known terminology (manarah/sawmďah/ mPdanah) associated with the architectonic expression of a ritual function of such great importance (Hillenbrand 1991: 362-363)? An economic explanation is implausible since the bumah would, in that case, sit very uneasily with the exquisite mihrãb decorations often found within the same mosques (eg. Bandyopadhyay 1998: 159 figs 9.26 &amp; 9.27). Nor can one make a direct typological and functional comparison with the domes found in the mosques and tombs of Dhofar and the Hadhramawt. What is the formal origin of such a peculiar accessory on the Ibâdï mosques? Our investigation thus has to pursue a two-pronged approach: while, on one hand, the meaning and etymology of the Omani Arabic word bümah has to be explored, a careful study of its formal characteristics and possible connections seems also to be very necessary. 'Bumah1 in Literary Arabic and Omani-Arabic The word bümah in Arabic refers to the owl and its use is attested as far back as pre-Islamic Arabic poetry: Bum, sadã, hãmah, and their plurals are the most frequently used terms to denote an owl in pre-Islamic Arabic poetry. A fourth term, duwac of questionable etymology and quite likely a foreign loan word, is occasionally found, . . . Bum, sadã, hãmah and duwac are collective nouns referring to both male and female though some attempts have been made to distinguish them on the basis of sex: bum, sadã and duwac are said to be male, bumah and hãmah female. While this division is applicable to gender and agreement, sex distinction was not important in the poetry, and the choice of a specific term was largely determined by a poem's rhyme and meter. (Homerin 1985:175) The few archaeologists and Arabists who have cared to comment on the Omani mosques have opined that the name bumah was derived from its form, which is analogous to that of an owl silhouetted against the sky (Costa 1997: 8; Damluji 1998: 478; Baldissira 1998). This is possibly because of the well-known sedentary and inert posture often exhibited by the owl frequently found perched on roof tops at dusk, 'The "brown-owl", perched upon the roof of a house and suggesting by its inert posture that it is waiting in true oriental fashion for an event expected within a few days, . . . ' (quoted in Modi 1923: 57); also, '. . . like an owl of the wasteplaces;/ 1 lie awake, I am like a lonely bird on the housetop.' (quoted in Homerin 1985: 171). The construction of this image of stasis has been aided by its motionless vertical posture and the attribution to it of certain anthropomorphic characteristics, and it is this peculiar state of human- like repose that has imparted to it a degree of solemnity and has allowed the owl in many cultures and in many periods to be considered as a bird of wisdom (Modi 1923: 58; Homerin 1985: 170). However the lure of such a simple yet acceptable explanation linking the rooftop cupola with the owl seems to be undermined by the fact that in Arabia the owl has been largely regarded as inauspicious and connected with death, calamity, and the spirit or ghost (Rehatsek 1876: 163-166; Homerin 1985; Stetkevych 1986: 40-42). The pre-Islamic Arabs, especially the frail and the sick, referred to their impending death by the proverb, 'I am but an owl of today or tomorrow1, an idea which evidently passed into the Islamic era, since so pious a Muslim as the poet Labid is known to have used such an expression (Lyall 1877: 69 &amp; 81 n. 24).5 The Arabs in the pre-Islamic period saw the soul (al-nafs) as a bird which resided within the body, with its wings spread out at ease. When the man died or was slain, this bird, released from its bodily confines, continued to circle the mortal remains till it grew larger and became an owl (bum) which cried over his grave in a savage and shrieking voice. According to Al-Shahrastânï, this owl (hãmah), formed through the conjunction of the blood of the brain and the physical constitution (binyah) , returned to the top of the grave every one hundred years. Such an owl, often described as the receptacle of the dead person's spirit (ruh), dwelt alone in the 'desolate dwellings and the sepultures and where slain men fall and where death occurs' (Homerin 1985: 168-169; also 18</page><page sequence="7">THE BÜMAH IN THE MOSQUES OF CENTRAL OMAN Rehatsek 1876: 165). The dead returned to their progeny and took cognizance of their acts, which frequently found expression in the elderly warning their descendants against any unlawful deeds in the future. Incarnation as an owl was not seen as a universal image of resurrection, but rather as the troubled and tormented existence of men slain unavenged returning thirsting for the blood of their perpetrators: And it is said that a man when he is killed and his revenge not taken, an owl comes out from his grave and then continues screeching 'Quench me!1 'Quench me!' (isqunï, isqüní), continuing so until the killer is killed. (Homerin 1985: 169)6 Conceptions of the thirsty owl in Arabic poetry have been investigated by Homerin, and we shall return later to examine certain aspects of this and other related phenomena. Meanwhile, one begins to wonder, if the word bumah carried such negative connotations in Arab culture, how could it have become acceptable in Omani sacred architecture? Two fragments of evidence could be cited to illustrate the ambivalent position occupied by the owl in Omani culture. In his huge corpus of Omani proverbs, Halïfa b. cAbdallah al-Humaydï was able to cite only one proverb related to the owl (Dévényi 1996).7 On the other hand, a leading contemporary Omani musician is known to have acquired the nickname of Abu al-Büm, 'the Father of the Owl' (Shawqï 1994: frontispiece pl.).8 All this suggests that the origin of the bumah in Omani mosques is much more complex than that proposed by recent commentators, and that its route to acceptance into Omani culture was tortuous. Indeed, the situation is further complicated by Müller's position vis à vis the etymology of bümah. Rejecting the connection between the Omani word bumah and the Arabic word for owl (bumah) as a folk etymology and citing Brockett's work on the spoken Arabic from the Haburah region of the Bãtinah (Brockett 1985: 65), he contends that the Omani bumah (pl. bwem, root bwm), which also has the meaning of 'a pre-Islamic hill-top cairn1, 'beehive tombs' as Brockett adds, ought to be connected to the Biblical Hebrew bãmâ (with the variant bõmâ, pl. bãmôt) 'hill, high place, place of worship' (Müller 1999). Literary traditions of the Nagd indicate a tendency to link the altar with the mountain top, 'He moved therefrom and reached a mountain top,/ like a high altar sprinkled with the blood of sacrifice' (Kalbi 1952: 29).9 Carter has published a photograph of a ruined hill-top enclosure in the Wadï Aswad in Oman which he identifies as a xbomd (Carter 1982: 76, pl. 17). The tomb, for which no further information has been provided, appears to be a Hafit- or a beehive-type of grave structure. As I shall attempt to show, these two conceptions of the bumah, i.e., the 'owl' and the 'pre-Islamic hill- top cairn', in their myriad manifestations, seem to have become curiously intertwined to give us the diminutive bumah on Omani mosques. This connection, it appears, is already suggested in cAbïd ibn al-Abras' line, 'Or until I become a possessor of an owl on top of a hill/ or at the bottom of exposed, open ground' (Homerin 1985: 182), where the word 'owl' seems to be connoting both 'soul' and 'tomb' at the same time, as well as in the name õabal al- Hãmah, the hill known for the location of a concentration of Hafit-type hill-top cairns in the south-east of Oman (Potts 1990: i, 77 &amp; 78 n. 78). One can detect a complex interplay between forms and meanings, and between concepts. Form and Concepts (1) Formal Similarity Indeed, there exists a very striking formal similarity between the bumah and the hundreds of Neolithic early 3rd millennium ВС Hafit-type and beehive burial chambers found all over central Oman (Potts 1990: i, 74 fig. 7 &amp; 75 fig. 8). First discovered by Danish archaeologists in 1959 near the oasis of Buraimi and dated by Bibby to the 14th or 13th century ВС,10 During Caspers and Karen Frifelt soon established their greater antiquity (Potts 1990: i, 72-73; recent summary, Crawford 1998: 108- 1 1 1).11 These single-chambered burial cairns - the Hafit-type 'constructed of two concentric ring-walls of unworked stones heaped up to form a domed chamber' (Potts 1990: i, 73), and the beehive graves, consisting of 'two or three curtain walls with hand- sized stones between . . . built of ... brownish limestone' with 'a low plinth, about half a metre wide' encircling them (Frifelt 1975: 67) - were a maximum of с 8-9m. in exterior diameter, of which 19</page><page sequence="8">SOUMYEN BANDYOPADHYAY the interior chamber was only 1-2. 5m. These beehive graves, Frifelt thought, could mark a possible transition from the older Hafit horizon to the more recent Umm an-Nar culture (Frifelt 1975: 69; Potts 1990: i, 96 fig. 12), while Vogt contends that they could be variants of a single architectonic form (Potts 1990: i, 78). These graves, often located above the level of the wadi bed (e.g. Bandyopadhyay 1998: 333 fig. 15.48), have managed to survive the ravages caused by the flash floods that rush down the wadis, a fate which, it appears, must have befallen the settlements proper. The tombs were built of unbonded flat stones or slabs and were of an internally corbelled construction, which eventually formed the chamber roof. The opening in the circular ring construction was achieved in a similar manner, thus creating a triangular aperture. This is also the technique of construction employed in the bumah, where the layers of mud bricks, lying in a circular arrangement, corbel inwards as they rise towards the apex. Its diminutive form meant that fewer courses were necessary, which causes one to wonder why a monolithic clay shell was never adopted. (2) Diminution The bãmâ was not solely connected with Judaic traditions, as the remains of the pre-Islamic Arab sanctuaries of Sde Boqer in the Negev show, bãmôt were associated with centres of cultic worship in the èãhill period (Nevo &amp; Koren 1990: 23-44 esp. figs 3 &amp; 6). Interestingly, 'elevations' of bãmôt depicted on several coins minted in Adraa and Bostra during the Roman period between 64/63 ВС and 256/257 AD show an elevated platform, surmounted by a dome-shaped baetyl (one among the coins from Adraa and three among those from Bostra), accessible by a ladder or a staircase (Spijkerman 1978: 60-65; 78-89 &amp; pis 10, 11, 15 &amp; 17). While the examples from Bostra depict the baetyl surmounted by more flat stones (one or seven), their shape, general arrangement and means of access show a remarkable resemblance to the bumah on our mosques. In Nabataean cult centres, a triple-stela arrangement is often found associated with a bãmâ (Nevo &amp; Koren 1990: 35 fig. 7c). While stela burials in high places are known from Sde Boqer (Nevo &amp; Koren 1990: 36),12 the presence of 'Dushara niches' in the sanctuary of Ma|lis al-Sultãn at Mada'in Sãlih, Saudi Arabia, which are fashioned in the form of a sectioned dome-shaped hollow baetyl, with one or three stehdbaetyls 'buried' inside, the section itself suggesting an exhumation or a re-'discovery' (Department of Antiquities. 1975: 47-49), appears to confirm the primitive function of the high places as sepulchral sanctuaries (Hirsch 1904: 388). This nexus of implied connections between the bãmâ, the Omani cairns, and tomb- representations in Arabic literature, is fully established by the presence of the eagle at the apex of these niches, a representation so frequently associated with Nabataean tombs of that region (Department of Antiquities 1975: 39-45). Stetkevych has suggested that the use of eagle/ vulture imagery in Arabic poetry is a heavier, larger equivalent of the original owl concept, glutted from feeding on the carcases of those slain in revenge, too heavy to take flight (Stetkevych 1986: 40).13 This diminutive conception of the owl vis à vis the eagle/ vulture appears to have a parallel in the popular understanding of the name of Bõmat Sãlah, a small tower within the Muscat fortification. According to locals, the tower is called a bumah and not a bure because of its smaller size (Peterson 1999). (3) Denial of Sepulchral Function Often referred to as bwem gihil, 'cairns of [the] Days of Ignorance', Brockett's informants in üäburah were adamant that these hill-top cairns were not burial mounds but look-outs (sawu hadë l-bwem minien harãbe mitil syeb, 'they made these cairns for battles like look-outs') or houses (Brockett 1985: 65). The so-called 'houses of the high places' in association with the bãmôt attest to the notion of 'dwelling/ house' (Hirsch 1904: 387). On the other hand, there is evidence of the bãmâ having the meaning of a hill-top fortress or defense installation from the verbs and phrases used in connection with its destruction. Examples from Qaryat al-Faw in Saudi Arabia suggest that some of these Omani cairns could well have been re-used (Ansary 1982: 44 pis 1-4), a possibility well supported by Nagdi literary traditions: 'I mounted the watching-mound on the top of a dusty hill/ narrow in standing-place, 20</page><page sequence="9">THE ВОМАН IN THE MOSQUES OF CENTRAL OMAN whose dust blew towards the standards of the foe1 (Lyall 1877: 88 v. 64). This again has close parallels in the Arab literary conception of the observing owl- spirit in its humanized sedentary posture perched on rooftops: And they maintain that the owl (hãmah) stays . . . with the sons and grandsons of the dead person and keeps them company, in order to learn about what occurs after him, so that she may inform him of it, to the extent that as-Salt ibn cUmayyah said to his sons: My owl informs me of what you feel, so may you avoid the disgraceful and disgusting. (Homerin 1985: 168) Again, I enjoin you two, sons of Nezár, to follow his advice who exhorts you with sincerity, truth and love. That my owl may not witness combat among the owls, do not ye two - woe be to you! - shoot arrows after my demise. (Rehatsek 1876: 166) Thus the denial of their essential sepulchral function, and an affirmation of what was decidedly a subsequent appropriation, appears to denote a significant positional shift adopted by the Omani- Arab culture which, through the anaesthetization and modification of the occult-spirit connotations connected with the owl, has made possible the later acceptance of the bumah within a sacred architectural programme. (4) The Warrior and the Liminality of the Bumah The bãmôt were found 'in cities ... at their gates' (Hirsch 1904: 387) acting as sentinels to the city, a concept which has its reverberations in the mosque bumah, located on the right-hand corner of the prayer-hall façade. Arab cultic sanctuaries related to the bãmôt would often have a large, heavy cornerstone placed on the highest course of an enclosure, slightly projecting beyond the wall line. Their cultic significance becomes clear from the treatment accorded them when the site was deserted, for the buildings or the enclosures were not destroyed, but the cornerstones were often pulled out of the wall and found lying nearby (Nevo &amp; Koren 1990: 36). These cornerstones, predecessors of the arkãn in Islamic traditions, find their apotheosis in the famous Black Stone (hagar al- rukn) of the Kacba.14 Like the bãmôt, they functioned as symbolic sentinels and as points of orientation within the sacred enclosures. One can detect parallels with the word used in North Africa for the minaret, sawmďah, where its initial connotation of a hermitage/monk's cell was later transformed into a sentry-box (Hillenbrand 1991: 362). More generally sawmďah means 'a higher place' or a 'high building' which appears to have interconnections with the Omani-Arabic sõmcah (root swmc), 'narrow towering mountain- peak' (Brockett 1985: 146). 15 Another word used for the hill-top cairn in Oman, siba (pl. syeb, root syb), indicates for the first time 'attack' as opposed to 'defensive observation' through its meaning, 'to go down from a higher place ... to assault' (Brockett 1985: 146) which prompts us to connect this with the idea of the owl as an avenger or an instigator of revenge: 'Days of battle in which we struck their skulls/ with sharp-edged swords until they were benf (Homerin 1985: 179) and, Your brother, I just recognized his place at the foot of Qubã - the whirlwinds blowing dust upon it, He has an owl which calls, when night covers it, fBanï cÃmir, is there an avenger for al-Halâlï?1 (ibid. 180) This hints at a possible curious connection with the Greek conception of Athena as the enlightened goddess of war, the 'owl-eyed maiden' (Sparks &amp; Soper 1970: 161; Homerin 1985: 173). Silver coins found in South Arabia, clearly inspired by the Hellenistic iconographie depiction of the owl, indicate an Arab awareness of the owl's connection with Athena and war (Doe 1971: 1 18-122 &amp; pl. 44). It is likely that both these concepts - the owl as an avenger of tribal pride, and as connected to war - would have been well-known to the Arab tribes migrating into Oman and establishing a new social structure. The pan-Semitic concepts connected to the bãmâ will also have been known in the region. Camels were often equated with warriors who were repeatedly taken to the pools of death to quench their thirst (Lyall 1878: 11-12 v. 40, also ibid.: 24 n. 40). It was the custom to 'tether a camel by the grave of a dead warrior, and to let her die there of hunger and thirst; they believed that on the 21</page><page sequence="10">SOUMYEN BANDYOPADHYAY Judgement Day her master would ride on her at the Resurrection to the gathering of mankind' (Lyall 1877: 89 v. 76, ibid.: 95 n. 76). The swift she camel with her pads bleeding, is a powerful image employed for a companion in a desert journey, battling her way through the intense heat and the fathomless nights filled with the hooting of owls (Homerin 1985: 180-181). Guidestones/cairns (irem, pl. ãrãm) were set up on mountain ridges, in much the same way as our Omani ridgetop tombs, to mark the way in the desert (Lyall 1877: 92 n. 27; Doe 1971: 236 &amp; pl. 127), and together with the ridges and valleys, resembled a camel caravan with the litters in which they carried the women (Lyall 1877: 85 v. 15, ibid.: 91 n. 15). Indeed, the hilltop tombs and guiding cairns are equated in the celebrated verse of Layla al-Ahayliyyah, where the owl-avenger lurking behind the cairn is made to confront the warrior on his camel (Lyall 1881: 141), thereby confirming the connection between the owl- avenger and the warrior which was suggested earlier. The true Ibadï (sg. šar/šari, pl. Sarah), who contracted his life for the faith and bought salvation in his after-life, was also a warrior who 'wakes up in the morning hoping for death in the fight after the model of Mirdas' (Wilkinson 1976: 537). In such a self-sacrifice, one can detect an introversion of the familiar blood-vengeance plot found in the ritãc genre of Arabic poetry. For the Sarah, faith (much like tribal pride in the ritãc) could be established, while salvation (like personal pride for the tribal warrior) could be bought through the death of the sari, who now simultaneously represents the non- kin of the ritäF. Such complex and overlapping concepts highlight the Arab conception of life alternating between the two antithetical states of harãm and halãl (Stetkevych 1986: 36). Such overlaps of tribal and Islamic intentions are understandable, for the Ibadï state developed as a supra-tribal entity strongly representing both tribal aspirations and a balance of power. Blood- vengeance could be seen as a sub-class of sacrifice, where the tripartite 'entry or separation'/'sacrifice or liminality'/'exit or aggregation1 schemes of the rites of sacrifice and of blood-vengeance coincide (Stetkevych 1986: 29; also see, van Gennep 1975 &amp; Hubert &amp; Mauss 1968). For the sari, like his tribal counterpart, the entry/separation occurs with his taking the oath; his impatient wait for daybreak appears to have exact parallels in Arabic poetry of sleepless nights awaiting revenge or the seemingly endless desert journeys. The morning battle, again, coincides with myriad examples of morning attacks where the enemy is given the morning draught of wine or a commensal meal of death (Stetkevych 1986: 33 &amp; 38). The bümah, with its emanating/a^r adãn of twilight ushering in the morning, seems to stand within a liminal condition between a series of oppositions such as, night and day, awaiting and avenging, unclear and clarified destiny, life and death, the true misr and the untruth, and between the screeching owl of death and night and the rhythmic poetic hoot (bum) of adãn during the day. It also stands guard over the passage of initiation from boyhood/adolescence to manhood, since his life sacrifice, through an Oedipal violence of emulation, allows him to elevate his soul to an exhalted or sacred status (like Mirdas). Following the avenging, the faithful partakes in the feast of renewed faith through the magnanimity of the Sari who has bought his salvation. Assimilation Wilkinson relates how a local sheikh in central Oman described numerous graves on surrounding hill tops as 'Malik b. Fahm tombs' (Wilkinson 1977: 129-130). Such a legend is no exception, as examples from Aflaj show how the beehive tombs, the circular kerbed structures and the cairn tombs are attributed to the Yemeni tribe of Banï Hiläl (de Cardi, Collier &amp; Doe 1976: 157). Clearly, these are yet other examples of an attempt at incorporating material fragments of a pre-Arab cultural tradition cited earlier. The Arab migration into Oman, emanating from the nomadic fringes of the settled area of Mãrib, probably tied to the successive breaches of the Mãrib dam (Kitchen 1994: 128-131), began around the 2nd century AD and continued intermittently over a period of many centuries well into the Islamic era. According to legend (Ross 1874: 112-118), a family and tribal feud forced Malik, the legendary forefather of all Omanis of Yemeni origin, to leave 22</page><page sequence="11">THE ВОМАН IN THE MOSQUES OF CENTRAL OMAN his homeland near Mãrib and embark on a journey which took him up the coast to Qalhãt and then inland into the Jawf. There, Malik encountered the Persians and routed them in battle on the plains of Salut and established the Azd-Arab stronghold. Malik reputedly had a falag dug for him in Manh, whose disused overgrown channel the locals are still keen to point out. Following the ejection of the Persians, Malik established the Arab tribal system through his progeny and lived in and ruled Oman for a significantly long period. However, Malik met a tragic end when one of his sons accidentally killed him. The legend of Malik b. Fahm therefore represents the classic mythopoeic 'structural unity1 described by Slochower as 'a drama in three acts with an epilogue1 (1970: 22-26), consisting of (1) an initial blissfulness represented by Eden or Paradise (here, the early existence in fertile Mãrib); (2) the departure from home or expulsion of the hero and a difficult journey (here, the departure from home of Malik, the journey from Yemen to Oman and the more metaphorical journeys of life represented by the war with the Persians); (3) the destiny, home- coming or the recreation of Eden (here, the establishment of the Arab settlement in Oman); and, (4) the tragic epilogue (here, Malik being killed by his own son, a clear case of Oedipal violence). In our case, we are particularly concerned with the reconstruction of Eden: Malik has to eject the Persian 'demons' to begin such a reconstruction. He digs a falag in his new dominion implanting the symbolic seed of Eden, the eternal flowing river, where water also represents the most vital aspect of the landscape he had deserted. He reinstates the social structure of kinship and tribal values which he had once rejected. He remakes himself as the protector of a wider group and a more extensive territory. Thus the reconstruction of Paradise does not take Malik back to the landscape of his origins, rather, by introducing the symbols of the landscape Malik models this alien territory to approximate to the authentic landscape of his origins. Within such a recreation the fragmentary remains of earlier material cultures posed a particular problem: Malik chose to recast them within the newly instituted mythical tradition. It appears that it was necessary to incorporate the prehistoric hill-top cairns, possibly because of their unavoidable presence and the pragmatic problem their physical obliteration posed. Their subsequent transformation into the diminutive cupola of the Ibadï mosques is a story of the denial of certain primal functions and acceptance of others, and of forms and conceptions that played complex intertwining games; the final tapestry represents a rich mixture of a series of opposites around the owl and the prehistoric tomb motifs. Notes 1 Ibadism arose out of the Kharijite division during the first century of Islam. See Wilkinson 1972; also Wilkinson 1976 &amp; 1987. 2 Photograph courtesy of the Ministry of National Heritage and Culture. 3 Links between the Trucial coast and the Ibadï heartland were first ruptured during the civil war that ushered in the collapse of the First Imamate during the 10th century. See Wilkinson 1972. 4 That the bumah in the Ibadï mosques corresponds to the minaret (manãrah) in Hadramï mosques is clear from this similarity (Serjeant 1959: 446). 5 This is significant because the Prophet Muhammad, evidently in view of the huge popularity of such beliefs, had prohibited any belief in them and denied their very existence (Rehatsek 1876: 166 &amp; п.). 6 For an affirmation of this aspect see also, Rehatsek 1876: 165 &amp; Lyall 1881: 142 n. 7 This work cites, Humaydï 1986-1994.

Našir b. cAbdullãh al-cArïmï, who is, as the picture- caption records, 'leader of the tanburah (nübän) ensemble in Sur'. 9 The poet Zuhayr ibn abï-Sulmâ quoted by Ibn al- Kalbi. 10 Based on the discovery of a bronze sword of a type known from Luristan in western Iran and dating to the late 2nd millennium ВС. 11 From the type and style of pottery found in the graves, During Caspers asserted that these were types common in southern Mesopotamia from around Babylon and the Diyala regions in the Jamdet Nasr period (c. 3000 ВС), a suggestion 23</page><page sequence="12">SOUMYEN BANDYOPADHYAY also made by Karen Frifelt at roughly the same time. 12 This, in turn, hints at a very old Semitic tradition associated with the burial, and thus disappearance, of votive objects, and their subsequent reappearance or rediscovery. Hawting (1980: 44-54) has parallels in folklore from Oman and the UAE (in Oman eg. Carter 1982: 172). 13 Modi mentions, '. . . in the old times when the Avesta was translated into Pahlavi (250-300 ВС), the owl was not probably classified as a distinct species and was included in the category of gizdreh ..., vulture or carnivorous bird, because it feeds upon flesh1 (Modi 1923: 52-53); cf. Vulture-mother representing death and calamity in Zuhayr, 'In that place where the Vulture-mother cast down her camel-saddle' (Lyalll878:23v.37). 14 Certain recently demolished mosques in Saudi Arabia appear to have shown a curious continuation of this tradition in the use of inscribed cornerstones (Zaylacï 2000). 15 Interestingly, Ewald suggests that the substructure of a bãmâ might have been a conical stone pile which replaced the primitive dolmen (Hirsch 1904: 387).
