The hominization starts with the divergence between the lineages of Apes and Hominids, about 6-7 million years ago, and includes the preparation of man, the appearance of man and the transformations that lead to the present mankind. The regions which furnished remains that are referable to the hominization are localized in the East Africa. We mention Orrorin tugenensis, Ardipithecus kadabba and Sahelanthropus chadensis near to the Hominid-Ape split. In the East Africa regions, after the formation of the Rift valley, it became available a wide environment favourable to the bipedism. It has been observed that evolution began from the feet, however it perhaps should be better to state that it began with the raising of the vertebral column. (Coppens, 1991b). Adaptations to this new and wider environment are present in the Orrorin and in the Australopithecines of 3-4 million years ago discovered in Ethiopia, Kenya and South Africa. Numerous Australopithecus remains have been described, and they can be grouped in archaic, gracile, and robust forms. About two million years ago in Africa were present Hominids with a greater cranial capacity and a particular industry: the choppers and chopping tools. They were named by Leakey, Tobias and Napier Homo habilis. A more cerebralized Hominid from Turkana was named Homo rudolfensis (Wood, 1992). * University of Bologna.

The relations of Homo habilis/rudolfensis with the Australopithecines are viewed differently. The oldest forms of the genus Homo are related to an archaic Australopithecus, as Lucy, or to Australopithecus africanus or to Kenyanthropus or probably to A. anamensis who lived around 3.9 million years ago or to Ardipithecus (4.3 million years ago) recently again studied. But we must remark that recently Wood (1999, 2001) attributed Homo habilis and Homo rudolfensis to the Australopithecus (A. habilis and A . rudol- fensis)t a new, but discussed opinion. In east Africa Homo habilis evolved into a form with greater cerebralization, more complex stone tool industries and territorial organization. This level is named Homo ergaster (the oldest African form of Homo erectus), which appeared around 1.6 million years ago. Other specimens of Homo ergaster come from Olduvai (Tanzania), Daka (Etiopia), Buia (Eritrea). Culture is represented by bifaces and Levallois flakes. Homo ergaster spread and evolved during a few hundred thousand years in Europe and Asia where he migrated. The migrations of man out of Africa happened in different times. The most ancient is documented by the remains recovered at Dmanissi, in Georgia, dated to 1,7 million years ago. They are intermediate chronologically and morphologically between Homo habilis and Homo ergaster. The cranial capacity is small, but lithic industries are present. The ancient remains from Asia are documented by Pithecanthropus from Java, by Sinanthropus and other remains. In Europe the most ancient remains of man come from Ceprano (Italy) (800.000 years ago) and Atapuerca (Spain) (800.000 years ago). They attest the presence of Homo erectus (Ceprano) and possibly of Homo antecessor (Atapuerca), which would be representatives or related to Homo ergaster that in Africa would meanwhile have originated Homo sapiens . The roots of Neanderthal man can be recognized in some specimens from Heidelberg, Atapuerca, Tautavel. They present some characters that evolved in more clear neanderthalian features in the European regions. In the descent of these Hominids we can include many remains of low Palaeolithic from Bilzingsleben, Steinheim, Swanscombe, La Chaise, Lazaret. The classic neanderthalian remains come from Krapina, Saccopastore, Circeo, La Chapelle, Neanderthal, Le Moustier, La Ferrassie, Saint-Césaire (cf. Facchini, 2006b).

To Neanderthal man is referred the culture of low and middle Palaeolithic. In Europe Homo antecessor from Atapuerca evolved in Homo heidelbergensis and neanderthalensis, in Africa Homo ergas ter evolved in Homo antecessor and in archaic forms of Homo sapiens. From Idaltu, Laetoli and Omo come the most ancient specimens of archaic Homo sapiens, that migrated to the Near East and to Europe around 100.000 years ago. The last great migration out of Africa took place 50.000-70.000 years ago and around 40.000 years ago anatomically modern man spread in all the regions of the world. The culture of upper Palaeolithic is represented by Leptolithic and by artistic manifestations and burial practices. In the hominization, different species of the genus Homo have been recognized, but we must observe that in paleoanthropology the application of the concept of species is only supposed, and not demonstrated. As remarked by Coppens, Jelinek, Ferembach etc. in the human evolution the species correspond more to stages or steps, rather than to biological species. In any case we can ask: at which point of the hominization can we identify the human level in the philosophical sense? From the biological point of view bipedalism is not sufficient. A certain level of cerebral organization that allows for language and psychic activity at the human intellectual level is to be admitted. The existence of a link between psychism and cerebral organization is difficult to contest. As Bergson observed: "Consciousness (we would say psychism) does not spring from the brain, but brain and consciousness correspond because equally they measure, the one by the complexity of its structure, and the other by the intensity of its awareness, the quantity of choice that the living being has at his disposal." Cerebralization has been proposed by Teilhard de Chardin, Jerison and others as a parameter by which to measure evolution. According to Teilhard de Chardin the cerebralization: it gives meaning and thus, at the same time, proves that there is a meaning in evolution (cf. Le phénomène humain ). Nevertheless the identification of the minimum cerebral threshold for human remains is problematic. According to Piveteau: "in a similar study the anatomical criterion can be only a factor of indecision: the psychical criterion is certainly the preponderant one" (1986, p. 85). The discoveries of hominids with a small cranial capacity but probably humans, as Homo habilis and Homo floresiensis , are a confirmation of this Revista Portuguesa de Filosofía Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="4">566 Fiorenzo Facchini position. In this regard, the differentiation of cerebral areas related to language (Brocas area and Wernicke s area) is of obvious interest. Indeed these areas have been identified on the endocranium of Homo habilis (Falk, 1983; Tobias, 1987). Behaviourally it is necessary to look at the manifestations that can be interpreted as culture. It is culture that reveals the presence of man. But what characterizes cultural behaviour? At an evolutionary level, cultural behaviour must have two essential characteristics, which appear closely linked to each other and reveal an abstractive intelligence: planning capacity and symbolization. Planning capacity means the ability to act intentionally by means of the predisposition of certain actions to achieve a goal. Planning means originality and innovative ability, whether expressed in stone tool making or in territorial organization. It is what occurs in the human technology. Intentionality reveals the notion of time: the subject elaborates images of the past and projects them into a future that he is able to prefigure. According to Henry Bergson (1941). intelligence, considered in what seems to be its original feature, is the ability to manu- facture objects and particularly tools to make tools and to alter them in order to vary indefinitely their production." In the animal world, one also finds techniques (at times very complex ones), but they are regulated biologically and do not exhibit innovation and progress. There are no evident signs of abstract ability to project into the future. In his manifestations of intentionality, man also shows the capacity for choice and thus self-determination and liberty, an aspect that places him on a plane of values and thus ethics. Symbolization is the other characteristic of human cultural behaviour. It consists in attributing to a sign (a sound or an object) a value or meaning that goes beyond the sign. By means of symbolization realizations of techniques are enriched with meaning and value. The symbolic content is evident in artistic representations, religious expressions (spiritual symbolism ), in the human language and the various forms of social communications (social symbolism). However one can recognize symbolic value also in the products of techniques. What is obtained from the technique, in addition to the response to a plan, assumes the value of a sign or a reference to some use. The tool reflects the function to which it is performed and assumes a meaning in the imagination of man and in the context of life. Therefore the products of the technique assume a symbolic value (Ries, 1993; Deacon, 1997). One can speak of functional symbolism . Homo symbolicus is such because he is human, creator of tools and of art, able to communicate his internal world in various ways, particularly by means of language. Revista Portuguesa de Filosofía Vol. 66- Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="5">Culture in the Hominization and its Philosophical Implications in an Evolutionary View 567 There are good arguments to affirm that the first cultural manifestations were product by Homo habilis. The cultural expressions observed in the phase of Homo habilis/rudolfensis seem to characterize (albeit in an elementary and simple form), his behaviour and living environment. There are records of stones flaked or used by the australopithecines, but their meaning in the context of living is very different from that of the Homo of 2-1,5 millions years ago, just as it is different from those of current Primates. For the latter, tool making is not essential for survival and for their relationships with the environment (Kitahara-Frisch, 1984). The human artifactual level is defined by the plan it expresses and by the meaning it assumes in the context of life and survival. Although Australopithecus was capable of manufacturing tools, Coppens (1991b) recognized that such tool making "had an anecdotal nature". We admit a pre-human stage of the tool, as we admit a pre-human stage of the organization (Piveteau, 1983, p. 48). But with man the tools became permanent, numerous, and diversified. It is exactly because of this cultural development that man has progressed in evolution while the australopithecines became extinct. Moreover the tool kit and the organization of the territory, oriented toward subsistence and the life of the family group, constitute a symbolic system of relationships that developed during the evolutionary history of man. These activities, long practiced by Homo erectus and in an elementary form by Homo habilis , represented true adaptive strategies in the relationship with the environment. (Facchini, 1999). Some scholars believe that the birth of symbolic thought occurred only around 150-100.000 years ago, with anatomically modern man, whose roots are recognized in Africa. Certainly in the middle an upper Palaeolithic there are clear manifestations of spiritual symbolism, particularly in the burial and in the aesthetic expressions in periods that go back to more than 20.000 years ago (Magdalenian art). In the interpretation we propose, the symbolic activity of man can be considered co-natural with the humans, although the available documentation regarding the earliest forms concerns the expressions of functional symbolism. In any case we know of spiritual manifestations also in the low Palaeolithic. Culture as discontinuity and transcendence of man Culture is to be considered as extra-biological or meta-biological characteristic, in the sense that it achieves a transcendence with respect to purely biological laws or modalities of behaviour. In fact even when it has some relationship with biological needs, it occurs outside of any biological or Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="6">568 Fiorenzo Facchini behavioural determinism and as mentioned above it is a sign of liberty or self determination. This is particularly evident in the manifestations of spiritual and social symbolism. According to Dobzhansky (1967), in the evolutionary history of life there have been two great moments of crisis. In consequence, although the organizational laws and modalities of the previous phase were conserved, there was an advancement beyond the preceding organization to a new level. The author proposes to call these new moments "evolutionary transcendence". A first transcendence was the passage from non-life to life. The laws of chemistry were not broken, but a new organizational modality and a relationship with the environment were established: "cosmic evolution transcended itself, giving birth to life". A second moment of transcendence was the appearance of man: "biological evolution transcended itself, giving rise to man". "The laws regulating beings were not cancelled, but the organizational modalities of human society are set on another plane. Organic evolution is superimposed on inorganic evolution...; cultural evolution is superimposed on biological and inorganic evolution." In this way of considering evolution, which in various aspects recalls the conception of Teilhard de Chardin (of whom Dobzhansky was an admirer), the author does not wish to attribute a philosophical or mystical meaning to the term transcendence. According to Dobzhansky (1967) "transcend means to exceed the limits or go beyond the normal, usual possibilities already experienced by a system". In my view (and remaining on scientific ground) the term transcendence can be used correctly regarding man. The activity that man performs by means of culture (including instrumental culture) is external to fixed and constant biological schemes, is performed freely with innovative modalities based on individual experience, and is able to counteract natural selection. We can speak of extra-biological values or instances. Man is capable of these activities because he is a thinking being and he is capable of self-consciousness and freedom. Culture represents a discontinuity of man, in relation to the animal world. According to Francisco Ayala (1998) "Biology precedes, culture transcends". Moreover, unlike what occurs for any other species which faces new environmental conditions by means of its genetic variations, man counteracts the selective forces of the environment with other, non-biological means, both defending himself by cultural adaptation and modifying the environment. Culture acts an adaptive discontinuity in comparison with other animals. This is an absolute novelty in the history of life. In this regard the development of the human species represents a paradox on the evolutionary plane: natural selection has produced a being able to oppose Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66- Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="7">Culture in the Hominization and its Philosophical Implications in an Evolutionary View 569 it by a modality that not longer falls within the natural game of competition of living beings with the environment. In this way natural selection is slowed down or even cancelled. This is a unique case in the world of living beings, one can say an anomaly, which can be explained by the development of culture, a factor not found in any other species. This is another reason to recognize a cultural discontinuity between man and animals. Some philosophical implications As pointed out above, Dobzhansky sees in the apparition of man the second form of transcendence in the history of life. This is affirmed on the phenomenological plane. Ayala (2009) speaks of a "super-organic evolution". Concerning the explanation of the nature of this transcendence and its causes it is necessary to move beyond the phenomenological aspects into a purely philosophical plane. a) The ontologica I discontinuity The discontinuity, represented by abstractive intelligence, self-awareness, symbolic communication and language, gratuitousness and freedom, all of which cannot be reduced to purely biological activities and introduces into the picture the spiritual dimension. If matter becomes thinking (Coppens 2006), one can speak of a qualitative difference in comparison with animals, not of a difference of grade, as affirmed by Darwin, according to whom "the difference in mind between man and the higher animals, great as it is, certainly is one of degree and not of kind" ( The Descent of Man, 1871). The presence of the spirit is outside the realm of empirical evidences and can be dealt with only at the philosophical level whether we are talking about the human phylogenesis or the ontogenesis. The discontinuity that can be observed on the phenomenological level may be interpreted as a transcendence at the philosophical or ontological level. John Paul II so describes mans appearance: With man we find ourselves in the presence of an ontological difference, one ontological leap, one could say." (Message to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences, 22 October 1996; in Papal addresses to the Pontifical Academy of Sciences 1917-2002, p. 273, Vatican City, 2003). If discontinuity is observed in a long time at the phenomenological level, at the philosophical level this discontinuity must be radical, no matter what its Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="8">570 Fiorenzo Facchini cultural expressions are, because the spirit cannot come out of living matter. As the Pope remarked: "Theories of evolution which, in accordance with the philosophies inspiring them, consider the mind as emerging from the forces of living matter, or as a mere epiphenomenon of this matter, are incompatible with the truth about man." (ibid.) In the address to the last Plenary Session of the Pontifical Academy of Sciences (31 October 2008) Benedict XVI reaffirmed "that every spiritual soul is created immediately by God - it is not produced' by parents - and also that it is immortal." (cf. Catechism of the Catholic Church , 366) We can assume that the will of the Creator includes, at a certain moment of the evolutionary process, a corporeity enriched by spirit, not in the sense of an entity which is added to another one, almost placed on or beside it, but which, starting from a certain moment, exists inside the other one, as and when it is wanted by God, in a way similar to what happens in the human ontogenesis. All this for ontological reasons, not to supply, but to elevate the biological structures, if we recognize the presence of the spirit in man. We admit a concourse of the Creator both in supporting biological structures, and in the creation of spirit either in the hominization or in the human ontogenesis. There cannot be any form of intermediate psychism which would be only partially human, as Maritain noted. But there may have been intermediate forms of animal psychism between the human one and that of the apes, as it is right to think this about the Australopithecus (overdeveloped animals, according to Maritain, 1973). Nevertheless, the exact moment of passage into the spiritual realm, i.e. when the hominid becomes aware of itself cannot be identified by scientific methods or represented by our imagination, as remarked by John Paul II. The obscurity in representing the appearance of the spiritual dimension is similar to what happens in the ontogenesis. "The moment of transition to the spiritual cannot be the object of this kind of obser- vation, which nevertheless can discover at the experimental level through experimental research, a series of very valuable signs indicating what is specific to the human being. But the experience of metaphysical knowledge, of self-awareness and self-reflection, of moral conscience, freedom, or again, of aesthetic and religious experience, falls within the competence of philosophical analysis and reflection, while theology brings out its ultimate meaning according to the Creators plans." (John Paul II, 1996, quoted) The achievement of human level interested the first humans and since then all their descendents up to the present day humanity. After having reached Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="9">Culture in the Hominization and, its Philosophical Implications in an Evolutionary View 57 1 the human threshold in the hominization process, mans presence continues further in the time with the generation of every human being who represents an ontological discontinuity with respect to animals. The will of the Creator was accomplished without mediation of material agents in the first humans and continues in every human being, even if with the collaboration of the parents. Cultural manifestations cannot help in determining the exact moment of the achievement of the human threshold in the hominization, but can only help in supposing if that threshold can be considered as reached. b) The ethical behaviour Connected with the cultural attitude is the ethical behaviour which requires the ability to recognize certain values and to choose freely. Some Authors derive from the Darwinian framework a concept of ethics, inspired to the socio-biology of E. Wilson (1978), which regards culture and its manifestations as being regulated by genes. The moral characters would be evolved by animals and would have had a success by natural selection. Genes responsible for moral qualities are admitted, causal relationships between neuronal activity and behaviour, included self-determination and religious sense, are looked for. These conceptions are said to be based on the observation of the emotional expressions of animals, about which Darwin recognized differences only of grade, not of quality, in comparison with man. Natural selection would act on the moral qualities in the same way it works for the physical characters. If man has had success in the evolution, it has been for the natural selection. Someone speaks of coevolution for the ethic-cultural component and for the moral sense, by means of natural selection (Franceschelli, 2009). This conception also inspires the Darwinian naturalism (cf. Franceschelli, 2009; Pievani 2006; Girotto et al, 2009). But in this case it is postulated what instead should be demonstrated. If some ethical behaviour has had success in the society, this cannot be referred necessarily to natural selection. David Sloan Wilson (2002) proposes an evolutionary approach to the religions. They can be considered as adaptive units, characterized by selection of group. The natural Darwinian selection would have developed systems of belief. But this view seems ideological, because extends a biological theory beyond its field. In our opinion religion is a cultural aspect of the human society and what man realizes by means of culture has not necessarily a biological determination and an adaptive value in the Darwinian sense, even if in a general consideration the moral and religious sense can contribute to the survival of the human species. Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="10">572 Fiorenzo Facchini The successes of human behaviour are not related to the natural processes of selection, but to the culture, and the cultural evolution does not follow the Darwinian scheme, as remarked by many scholars, among which Francisco Ayala (2009). David Sloan Wilson points out the importance of selection of group in the evolution of culture, beyond physical evolution, but the evolution of society includes a socio-cultural selection that does not follow necessarily the rules of selection of group. About the ethical behaviour we observe that some issues, like cooperation, solidarity, altruism, the familiar dimension, freedom, are conditions of success for the human species because they correspond to the biopsychic structure of man. But they have no genetic determinations, because the manifestations, different in individuals and peoples, are always freely reached and expressed. Some behaviours are connected to the fundamental or vital needs of the individual or of the species and can have favoured the human groups, but in any case the answers to the biological needs are enriched by particular significance, are perceived as values and are pursued freely. In relation with these characters we must point out the responsibility of man in his choices. The experience of peoples suggests and confirms some moral behaviour for the benefits to the society. Ethic behaviour is exclusive of human species. According to Ayala (1987) three conditions are necessary for an ethical behaviour: a) the ability to foresee the consequences of ones own actions; b) the ability to make value judgements; c) the ability to choose from a set of alternative actions. These conditions are present in man and are linked to the abstractive intelligence and to the freedom. The capacity for planning and symbolic activity is revealed by the products of technology, as we pointed out in our previous considerations. Spiritual symbolism is recognized in particular rituals of the early Palaeolithic and in the burials or decorations of the last hundred thousand years. All this attests freedom and capacity of values that are at the basis of the ethical behaviour. They are evident in modern humans, but must have been present also in prehistoric man. Very important and significant were the different forms of free cooperation in the life strategies of man. In particular, in man, altruistic actions are undertaken in full awareness and are freely carried out. These properties are not observed in the animal world, in which we can only find some analogies, that lead some Authors to consider them as human, for a kind of anthropomorphism. But the animal behaviour lacks a reflected conscience and freedom, which are conditions for the moral behaviour. Consequently it does not make any sense to speak of Darwinian ethic and of values derived from the animal behaviour, as some Authors improperly Revista Portuguesa de Filosofia Vol. 66 - Fase. 3 • 2010</page><page sequence="11">Culture in the Hominization and its Philosophical Implications in an Evolutionary View 573 propose. At this regard we can point out the great confusion in the promiscuous use of some terms like mind, freedom, culture, consciousness, ethics that are applied indifferently to animals and humans. We think the conditions of the ethical behaviour are present in human nature, but the moral codes are not the product of biological evolution (as the sociobiologists think). They are connected to the cognitive capacity and to the cultural evolution as Ayala (2009) observed. In any case the norms of morality must be consistent with biological nature. Culture and ethical behaviour appear as a transcendence from organic to human evolution, i.e. as an evolutionary event which introduces novel laws in nature, like what happened in the evolution from inorganic to organic. The nature of this transcendence is not a biological property and suggests a spiritual dimension. References Ayala, F. J. (1987). The biological roots of morality. Biology and Philosophy, 2, 235-252.
