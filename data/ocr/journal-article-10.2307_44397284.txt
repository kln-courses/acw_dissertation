In Eastern Europe emissions have fallen by 40% but are now rising by 10% since 1998. EU- 15 emissions declined slightly in 2005 thanks largely to reductions in UK and Germany, the target is 8%.

Environmentalist Lester Brown, president of the Earth Policy Institute, has released a report that called the quarter of a million Katrina evacuees who will not return home "the world's first climate refugees." IPCC-FAR /AR4 leaked and critiqued A draft report by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is said to offer "a more certain projection of climate change than the body's forecasts five years ago. In 2001, the scientists predicted temperature rises of between 1.4 degree C and 5.8C on current levels by 2100, but better science has led them to adjust this to a narrower band of between 2C and 4.5C. The new projections put paid to some of the more alarmist scenarios raised by previous modelling, which have suggested that sea levels could rise by almost lm over the same period." ( The Australian, 2.9.06). According to Der Spiegel FAR warns of the disappearance of Artie ice by 2100. Fred Singer suspects that the IPCC overestimates both present and future forcing by C02, sea level rise and ignores solar-modulated cosmic rays. Model skills for precipitation are so bad, it is not reported. Not even these latest models can account for NH/S Hemisphere differences, for Antarctic cooling or why Artie temperatures were highest in the 1930s. According to Arthur Rorsch. the following remain in need of scientific assessment I. The longitudinal study of the global distribution of average annual (or seasonal) temperature, pressure, insolation and specific meteorological conditions. II. Theory of the greenhouse effect. (The explanation of pressure and temperature gradients in the troposphere, also taking in account energy removal from the surface by convection, water evaporation and the effect of clouds.) III. The longitudinal study of the global distribution of changes of SL and glaciations. IV. The longitudinal study of the sun and cosmic ray cycles. V. The sorting out of which conclusions are based on empirical data only and which</page><page sequence="3">Fuel for Thought 985 are the result of numerical modeling. VI. Climate variability on a geological time scale. VII. Climate variability predictions (projections) in relationship to the complexity of the system. VIII. The frequency of the occurrence of specific weather conditions, (e.g., storms, droughts, etc). A shorter list, which is more focussed on criticising AR4 should deal with suspected selective quotation in AR4, the expected selective evaluation of the mainstream view on the causes of observed climate change, the neglect of alternative views for what ever reason. (5.8.06) Global warming 'turning Britain into tropics' According to the Tyndall Centre for Climate Change Research, temperatures could rise by 15°C by the year 3000 and sea levels by more than 11 metres (36ft), flooding much of London. Britain could be as hot as the tropics and much of London could be under the sea if something is not done to tackle disastrous climate change, researchers claim... The report's findings dwarf previous estimates of sea level rises. In a report for the Environment Agency, the centre said the abrupt changes could make Britain much hotter, or even - such is the uncertainty of the predictions - first colder and then hotter. This could happen if the North Atlantic current system collapsed, denying Britain the warming effect of the Gulf Stream. Ocean surface temperatures would fall by 3°C, but as the Arctic sea ice melted, they would rise again by 8°C in an abrupt turnabout over a period of no more than about 20 years. Baroness Young of Old Scone, the chief executive of the Environment Agency, told The Times: "We are running out of road on decision-making. Unless we dramatically change the use of fossil fuels then we will be committing future generations to the most severe impacts of climate change." ...Sea levels will still be rising at the end of this millennium and the total increase could reach 11.4 metres, displacing hundreds of millions of people. The acidity of the oceans will fall significantly, posing a threat to marine organisms such as corals and plankton.... the solution is to reduce emissions to zero by 2200. Dr. Lenton, lead author' said: "While most studies stop at year 2100 with temperatures and sea level rising, we explored where they are heading into the next millennium. Only by starting to reduce carbon dioxide emissions now can we avoid dangerous climate change." The message is that the world can afford to burn only about a quarter of its known reserves of fossil fuels. (Courtesy Sepp, March 2006) Weber on latest Hansen opinion "... my impression is that Jim Hansen finally succumbed to Al Gore-ism. The paper is conviction driven but certainly not fact-driven. (It is) an amalgamation of some facts, convictions, speculations and personal feelings (but not a scientific paper). It is a good prelude to what we can expect from FAR. Hansen puts his own convictions, feelings and speculations ahead of even the traditional modelling results - quite a feat for Hansen, the modeller. A few examples: • He is convinced El Ninos will be more frequent and stronger because of GW - without really providing a compelling argument.</page><page sequence="4">986 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 17, No. 6, 2006 • Tropical storms will be more powerful - contrary to both observational and modelling evidence. • Sea levels will rise several meters, may be to 25 - 30 m , most of Greenland and the WAIS will be bathed in water (in stark contrast to almost every modelling result on Antarctic and Greenland ice melt due to GW) • Temperature trends are shown 1870-2005, falsely ascribing the warming 1910 - 1950 to greenhouse related warming. Why not showing trends 1950- 2005? • Large observed NH warming grossly contradicts predicted relative cooling of the NH due to sulphur emissions. • Sea ice melt lowers temperature rise, quite a turn around from earlier predictions that melting sea ice would steeply enhance warming because of the sea-ice-albedo feedback • Adherence to BaU scenarios for ghg emissions and climate scenarios - he himself showed that real emissions since 1990 evolved according to IPCC scenarios B and C rather than A. This is a typical paper "hyping the hype". . . it shows in an almost exemplary way what is wrong with climate research today and that climate research is probably the most politicized natural science. (Gerd Weber, Essen, Germany ) DOING POLITICS WITH CLIMATE SCIENCE The Royal Society not impartial To add light to the furore about a letter from the Society to ExxonMobil UK demanding information about climate contrarians it had funded and then published (September 2006). Your editor spoke to both parties, but was rudely shouted down only by Bob Ward, the RS communication manager who clearly saw the IPCC as the sole source of relevant knowledge. He has since moved on 'to take up a very prestigious job'. Ward had stated on the radio: "We're not trying to shut scientists up. What we're trying to do is say to the lobby groups and to the companies that they should present properly what the scientific community is saying." A second letter from the Society to journalists asked them to ignore people with perspectives outside the IPCC consensus. Critics, however, continue to argue that the Royal Society is seeking to use the authority of science to limit open debate. "Climate scientists and advocates confident of their positions should welcome any and all challengers, and smack them down with the power of their arguments, not the weight of their influence or authority. A strategy based on stifling debate is sure to backfire. ... for the scientific enterprise as a whole," according to BBC interviewer Dr.Whitehouse. He also wrote "something rather ugly and unscientific about the letter the Royal Society has sent to EssoUK (part of Exxon) as reproduced in the Guardian newspaper. . . My disquiet about this is nothing to do with the status of the debate about anthropogenic global warming but about the nature of the debate and the role of the Royal Society in it and the sending of such a hectoring and bullying letter demanding adherence to the scientific consensus." Editor 's Comment: The scientific community is not a single entity and does not speak with one voice. Had Ward said the Hadley Centre, he might have spoken truth. I was</page><page sequence="5">Fuel for Thought 987 informed that the Society had made similar misjudgements in the past. According to Jack Barrett the Society poured "scorn on organisations which derive funding from oil companies, but the scientists of the IPCC enjoy funding from the greatest gravy train ever invented!" ( The Guardian , 26th Sept 2006) http://environment.guardian.co.Uk/climatechange/storv/Q. .1876538.00 .html.) Lest we forget, the submission of 13 April 2005 by the Society to the House of Lords inquiry into the economics of climate change and prepared by a group led by Sir David Wallace and Sir John Houghton, was entitled "A guide to facts and fictions about climate change." It claimed that: "This document examines 12 misleading arguments put forward by the opponents of urgent action on climate change and highlights the scientific evidence that exposes their flaws." The first 'misleading argument was: "The IPCC has become too politicised and does not accurately reflect the wide range of views within the scientific community. ..."The fourth 'misleading argument that: "The Earth is getting hotter, but not because of emissions of greenhouse gases from human activities... Variations in the Sun are more likely to be the cause of climate changing than increases in greenhouse gases." How could the former head of the IPCC lead an unbiased evaluation of his own work? As if that were not bad enough, a more- worrying trend is apparent. On 11 May 2006, the Society "launched" its booklet "Science and the public interest". "Once any elite organization feels able to divine and invoke the public interest, trouble must surely lie ahead. Perhaps that ExxonMobil letter is only the start, " suggested Bob Foster who also remembered that the US NAS President had signed the G8 letter organised by May. None of the Academies that signed the G8+ letter put it to a vote among their members. It would be useful to insist that such votes be required. BAAS - adaptation is inevitable.... but to what? British Association for the Advancement of Science President Frances Cairncross says adaptation makes better sense than mitigation of climate change. Contrary to the Royal Society, she argued that the world must be more realistic about the chances of preventing climate change and prepare for the inevitability of global warming. Politicians and environmentalists have failed to understand how difficult it will be to curb global warming and are overlooking the importance of adapting to the hotter world it will bring. According to Cairncross, the "ineffectual" Kyoto Treaty will not stop temperatures rising, as the US and large developing nations such as China and India are not involved, and even if a global agreement to limit carbon dioxide emissions is reached, a significant degree of warming is still likely. "Adaptation policies have had far less attention than mitigation, and that is a mistake." She mentioned developing new crops, constructing flood defences, setting different building regulations, or banning building close to sea level..." she said. (Extracts from M. Henderson, The Times , 2.9.06) A political prediction: What Stern will say and why "The Conservatives' new focus on so-called green issues has occurred without much reaction from Labour. There has been the odd comment from David Milliband, but the</page><page sequence="6">988 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 17, No. 6, 2006 move has generally been allowed to grab the headlines that the Cameron team obviously wanted. . . Why the silence? The answer may lie in an unnoticed review into the economics of climate change currently concluding in Her Majesty's Treasury. As anyone who follows government reviews will know, they are never undertaken without the conclusion already being decided in advance. In this case, as some of us predicted, the review is expected to recommend immediate action to mitigate the supposed effects of climate change (unsurprisingly, the review will endorse the prevailing alarmist position) - and that this can be achieved only by means of a new global pact. This will almost certainly take the form of a global version of the European Emissions Trading Scheme, presenting itself as a free-market solution. Of course, it is no such thing. The central decisions will all be taken by government on the basis of incomplete information, with the usual unintended effects. The European scheme has already proved tremendously costly to consumers, while doing little to reduce emissions, because governments have been unwilling to set targets that will dramatically increase the cost of energy. And any effective global treaty will require a vast UN bureaucracy to enforce it - an unprecedented loss of sovereignty, and hardly a free-market solution. But as a matter of political calculus, this announcement will enable the Chancellor to present himself as the world leader on climate change. He can claim to have studied the matter in depth; he has the authority on the world stage to be able to propose a new global initiative; and he can even present himself as a free-marketer on the issue. At a stroke, he will have presented himself as greener than Cameron. Cameron will be unable to answer effectively, because he will have to agree with the findings and has no influence globally." (By Iain Murray. Adam Smith Institute Blog 10.9). Groundwater not global warming causes flooding "Some Philippine government sectors have begun to recognise that the sea-level rise of one to three millimetres per year due to global warming is a cause of worsening floods abound Manila Bay; but are oblivious to, or ignore, the principal reasons: excessive groundwater extraction is lowering the land surface per several centimetres to more than a decimetre per year."

THE COMBAT AGAINST CARBON INTENSIFIES - legally, financially and technologically Non-binding US Senate resolution In 2005 the US Senate passed the following as a non-binding resolution: Congress should enact a comprehensive.... national programme of mandatory, market-based limits and incentives on emissions of greenhouse gases... (Carbon Finance p37 /Environmental Finance(EF) Supplement May 2006). Is Californian leading the USA? "In September, California passed the Global Warming Solutions Act of 2006. supported by Governor Schwarzenegger. This commits California, the world's 12th largest source of carbon dioxide, to reduce global warming emissions by 25%</page><page sequence="7">Fuel for Thought 989 compared to business as usual, a reduction to 1990 levels by 2020. It will affect stationery sources such as utilities, oil refiners, cement plants etc. This new law follows the announcement a few months ago of a goal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions in California by 80 % by 2050. Carbon cap legislation and regulation of power generators is to be launched in several NE states and may drive federal action. Many believe these local initiatives will be challenged in court. The State of California is also suing the 6 largest automobile companies on a public nuisance theory claiming that automobile emissions have contributed to global warming and have caused substantial damage and economic loss with reduced snow pack, beach erosion, ozone pollution and the costs of mitigation. The public nuisance legal theory is similar to one urged by several states in federal court in New York against certain utilities but which was dismissed by the district court on the grounds that it presented a non-justiciable "political question". That decision is now on appeal in the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit. Also, a judge refused to dismiss a case brought by several car dealerships and manufacturers against the State of California which alleges that California's law, passed in 2004, requiring vehicle makers to reduce emissions from the mix of cars that they sell in California by 30 % beginning with the 2009 model year on the grounds that such action is pre-empted by U.S. federal legislation on fuel efficiency. The decision turns largely on a legal analysis rather than on the facts so it raises real questions as to how this case will ultimately go. .. The case is currently scheduled for trial in January. The decision may be influenced by a case now before the U.S. Supreme Court which would allow that court to resolve the question of whether the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has the power to regulate greenhouse gases under the Clean Air Act. In short, as is often the case in the U.S, absent clear federal direction by Congress, much is in the hands of the courts." (From E Sussman) California demands document disclosure The State of California has filed a request in federal court to force auto makers to disclose all documents and communications between the companies and the so-called climate sceptics. California accuses the climate sceptics of playing a major role in spreading disinformation about global warming. The underlying litigation is a lawsuit by General Motors, DaimlerChrysler Corp., and the Association of Automobile Manufacturers against the state of California challenging the state greenhouse gas emissions limits for new cars, light-duty trucks and sports utility vehicles. California has been joined in the lawsuit by environmental activist groups including, the Sierra Club, Natural Resources Defense Council and Environmental Defense.

Wojick 1/9/2006) RWE versus Greenpeace A legal battle dating back to 2004 and concerns the continued use of brown coal by RWE, has reached the Oberlandesgericht Cologne and concerns the 'truth' of man- made climate change. According the Greenpeace the German energy concern stands condemned for denying the causes and dangers of climate change, referring instead to subjectivity and perceived dangers and that the link between climate change and human actions remains an open question. 'Incredible', comments Greenpeace, 'such impudence is known only from US President Bush. "We shall prove to the court that climate is already warming, that emissions of carbon dioxide is the primary cause and that the use of brown coal in electricity generation is a main contributor, said Greenpeace lawyer Guenther. The Federal Government has signed an international environmental treaty. . . .RWE cannot rise above this." (Evidence includes the usual, five warmest years since the beginning of records(1998, 2002, 2003, 2004 and 2005): highest average temperatures in one century in 2005, increase in extreme weather, stronger hurricanes, melting glaciers and 35,000 people dying of heat in summer 2003.

"We've seen encouraging progress from big-name insurers and brokers since last year's devastating hurricanes, but many more creative services will be needed as we confront what is perhaps the biggest threat in the industry's history," said Ceres president Mindy Lubber. Among the proposed actions are: Crafting insurance products and aligning terms and conditions to induce climate-responsible behaviour; - Participating directly in carbon markets, e.g. by facilitating trading, managing project risk, or enabling customers to buy offsets; Involvement in R&amp;D and new technologies for reducing greenhouse gas emissions; and building awareness among customers and other actors and participating more formally in the formulation of public policy. ( Environmental Finance July- August 2006, p34). - Also, motor insurers are also developing pay-as-you-drive policies that link premiums to the mileage driven, or the price of petrol. "It's only a hint of the level of activity that is called for," said Mills (Nebraska Department of Insurance), hinting that these initiatives "demonstrate the fallacy of assertions that the prosperity of business is somehow at odds with environmental protection". But the insurance industry alone cannot provide a solution to climate change. "We are working on new products to serve customers, and working on new loss mitigation technologies. But these are only responses. It's very important that we have an energy policy that addresses the anthropomorphic carbon dioxide emissions across all sectors of the economy." Climate Change Capital to top $1 billion for carbon fund - London-based boutique merchant bank Climate Change Capital (CCC) is expecting to raise more than $1 billion into its second carbon fund, which had reached $830 million by its first close on 11 September.

CDP represents an efficient process whereby many institutional investors collectively sign a single global request for disclosure of information on ghg emissions. The CDP report is based on submissions from the world's largest public companies in response to the request for disclosure. In 2006 CDP attracted support of 225 investment institutions globally, representing in excess of $31.5 trillion of assets under management. CDP4 will illustrate that climate change and shareholder value are inextricably linked. Its aim is twofold: to inform investors of the significant risks and opportunities presented by climate change; and to inform management of the serious concerns of their shareholders regarding the impact of climate change on company value.

Hydrogen is burnt in a gas turbine and heat is recovered for a steam turbine, two streams of electricity are generated from separate generators. By middle of next decade, RWE hopes H2 could also be used for other purposes. Also, C02 scrubbing from flue gas is to be demonstrated after 2009. {Greenhouse Issues June 2006) Towards the hydrogen economy in Europe The EU's Dynamis Project is aiming to construct a hydrogen plant through SINTEF Energy Research (12 EU nations, 30 partners) with €4 million involving capture, transport and storage options. The aim is to bring forward the hydrogen economy and half the cost of carbon dioxide reduction by 50%. Or back to coal? - Battelle has led in carbon capture and sequestration technologies for 10 years and concludes in a report recently released that this technology 'offers the potential for the continued use of the earth's abundant fossil fuel resources while still making significant progress on climate change' {Greenhouse Issues June 2006:14) - BGS and Leicester University are doing a theoretical feasibility study for disposing of C02 as liquid or solid hydrate offshore Western Europe.

The company said it needed more financial incentives from the government before going ahead with the carbon capture programme. If it is viable the scheme could be running by the end of 2009. BP said it wanted signs of support from Chancellor Gordon Brown. The government is expected to outline measures later this year. The proposal would see the world's first industrial-scale hydrogen power scheme based in the Aberdeenshire town and would generate 'carbon-free' electricity from hydrogen, reducing greenhouse gas emissions by capturing carbon dioxide and safely storing it. ... MP Alex Salmond, a supporter of the project, called for government backing, and said: "I think we have a bit of negotiation going on." The SNP leader said: "It's the most important European energy project in the last decade." Energy Minister Malcolm Wicks confirmed further CCS measures would be outlined in a pre- budget report later this year. Geo-sequestration will double price of electricity There has been little coverage of problems for C02 geosequestration that recently occurred in the Australian Parliament. This is reported at http://www.petroleumnews.net/storvview.asp?storvid=65643&amp;sectionsource=s0 and stated that "CSIRO told the inquiry that installing geosequestration at existing power stations would double the cost of electricity. Even with future improvements in</page><page sequence="14">996 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 17, No. 6, 2006 the technology and installation from scratch in new power stations, geosequstration would still significantly increase the cost of power." Fall of real wages forecast A recent Australian Bureau of Agricultural and Resource Economics report on the cost of cutting greenhouse gas emissions estimated Australians would incur a fall in real wages of about 20 per cent if the nation was to unilaterally cut greenhouse gas emissions in half by 2050. According to PM Howard that sort of scenario would have an "enormously damaging" effect on the economy. "I accept that climate change is a challenge," the Prime Minister said. ".. I am sceptical about a lot of the more gloomy predictions. "I also recognise that a country like Australia has got to balance a concern for greenhouse gas emissions with a concern for the enormous burden to be carried by consumers ... of what you might call an anti-greenhouse policy. It's a question of balance." Also, Federal Environment Minister Ian Campbell said the draft IPCC report was still undergoing a thorough review process... "It highlights the need for an effective global response to climate change as Australia alone cannot alter the pattern of world emissions," Senator Campbell said. "We are taking a leading role internationally to achieve effective engagement by all major greenhouse gas-emitting countries." The new projections are based on the results of 23 climate models, developed by government climate scientists from IPCC member countries. According to current climate change models, stabilising global greenhouse gas levels to 400 ppm offers a good chance of avoiding 2C global temperature increases. This would require global emissions to be 50 per cent below 1990 levels by 2050. CSIRO recently concluded that the goal of 60% might be considered the minimum needed to avoid dangerous climate change. (CCNET 4.9.2006) Costs of wind intermittency ignored in UK UK Energy Minister when commenting on the recent UKERC Report on The Costs and Impacts of Intermittency' gave the wrong impression that the UK will in future be able to do without conventional power plant (gas or coal), argues Prof. Michael Laughton. He wrote: "With or without wind generation in the electricity system, security of power supply is governed by the probability of the available plant being able to meet demand at all times, especially at or near peak periods, wind generation on its own cannot provide a reliable supply When backed up... it can provide an annual energy supply within the desired level of probability.. Unfortunately ensuring reliability of annual energy supplies and ensuring reliability of daily power supplies are two very different problems.... with a 30% annual load factor this 25GW of wind capacity would generate annually the same energy on average as 7.5 GW of conventional thermal plant capacity.. It is the cost of this extra reserve plant plus extra annual balancing costs that are quoted as the additional costs arising from intermittency of wind. These are small... Other additional costs from transmission enforcement and distribution are omitted (in the report).... for a 20% wind penetration they are seen to add a further 50% to the total cost. This and other ignored costs were considered to be outside the remit of the UKERC Report.

But a border dispute with Russia is so far holding up exploration in the area. - Two major foreign oil firms, responsible for 60% of its production, have been asked to leave Chad in a row over taxes. President Deby gave the order to US firm ChevronTexaco and Malaysia's Petronas. However, Chevron says it has fully complied with tax demands and not had "official notification" to leave. - The US Energy Department is to spend US$3 million to help fund a demonstration project in Alabama that will inject carbon dioxide (C02) into a mature oil reservoir to push out more crude and also displace greenhouse gases. The department said once the field is depleted, it could then be used to store carbon dioxide, instead of releasing the gas into the atmosphere and exacerbate global warming. ..The project, proposed by the University of Alabama in Birmingham, calls for flooding the state's Cintronelle oil field in Mobile County with C02. The Cintronelle field is the state's largest oil producing field. The department chose the field for the project because of its uniform geological structure and for the fact that the field has already been flooded with water to recover oil. But with so-called C02 flooding, about 20 percent more of the oil originally in a reservoir can be recovered... an extra 64 million barrels might be squeezed out using the technique. (From Veronica Brieno Rankin 8.9.06) Peak oil replacing global warming scare? - According to both OPEC and the US Geological survey, there is no technical foundation for this currently fashionable fringe theory. The estimate of the ratio between historical and accumulated production and future reserves has been not, as some of the peak oil proponents have been suggesting, declining but actually increasing. The estimates of the "resource base" both by OPEC and USGS are that there is no reason for concern over peaking oil to 2025 - it means that even in 2025 oil peaking may, as estimates move forward, not be a serious concern. The Acting OPEC SecGen also discussed, critically, bio-fiiel incentives. He suggested they were economically unsustainable and would in essence lead to agricultural production earmarked for high cost and highly subsidised energy rather than for food, driving up food prices for in particular the poor. One may add that the environmental</page><page sequence="16">998 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 17, No. 6, 2006 implications of driving up bio-fuel production with heavy incentives (remember the cotton in Uzbekistan, the corn in the US Midwest or the EU common agricultural policy) are from being evidently positive. - However, Brazil remains devoted to the idea, 25 top Brazilian Infrastructure projects recently held an ethanol and bio-diesel cluster project for day two of the Brazil Leadership Forum. This day was to focus "Building Infrastructure in Ethanol Country, or rather the infrastructure needs of Brazil's ethanol industry, including logistics, transportation, ports and electricity requirements for both the southeast and north/northeast ethanol producing regions. (Others voices were very critical: the industry is heavily subsidised, based on monoculture that destroys soils and biodiversity.) Oil peaks in recent history "Houston was rocking and rolling in 1980, with oil at $40 a barrel and some people in the industry predicting it would soar to $100. One of the few dissenting voices, Henry Groppe Jr., forecasted that by 1985 oil would fall to $15. "This guy's a nut," Houston energy analyst Matt Simmons recalled an oil executive telling him then. "He ought to be locked up in a straitjacket." ... After oil plunged to $14 in 1986, Groppe was "treated like a prophet with a crystal ball," Simmons recalled. Groppe "has, in fact, an excellent record on long-term energy forecasts, according to people in the industry." And now claims that we are entering an unprecedented event in world economic history with oil production straining to meet demand at a time when China and India are developing huge consumer classes relatively overnight, and hundreds of millions more people will have vastly increased demands for energy. ...Groppe sees oil hovering in a range of no less than $55 to $65 a barrel for the next 10 years and likely much more because unforeseeable political unrest and weather will drive prices up.... At age 80, he has the fervor of someone out to save the world. ... To avoid a global crisis, Groppe thinks that Americans should use the next 10 years, a time in which production output is expected to peak, to transition into new energy-usage habits. "We must rely more on nuclear power and alternative energy supplies and use all energy more efficiently," he said. He is no fan of ethanol, which he calls "pure farm-bloc subsidy." The energy spent on producing it is greater than the output, he said, "not to mention depletion of the topsoil." Predictions regarding reserves are speculative, particularly at an early stage. Still, this discovery should be discussed in the context of the following (summary): • The projected reserves in the ANWR which are still off-limits after about 30 years of discussion • Reserves estimates in the Gulf have been exceeded by production in many cases. In fact in some cases the excess over reserves has given rise to the theory that lower unknown formations are migrating into upper formations. • Field reserve estimates have consistently proven to be lower than actual production over time. This is a fact that acquiring companies have long relied upon. In almost all cases the production exceeded the predicted reserves.

While the press focus on alternate sources, the petroleum business has gone about a quiet-but profitable- revolution. The USGS estimates about 36 billon barrels in the US offshore. Whereas under the Carter Administration all of the offshore was available for leasing under a phased leasing plan, the US is now- since the moratorium in the mid 1980's - the only nation on earth where its offshore area is largely off limits... One final thought, one advantage to producing oil on US lands is the fact that royalties and bonus's benefit the US taxpayers and the employees working the rigs are US workers. Fifteen billion barrels translates to almost 200 billion in royalties and an aggregate added value of over 1 trillion dollars without multipliers.

'Houston engineer develops reputation for accuracy over the long haul" by DAVID KAPLAN, Houston Chronicle From: RJDobie Langenkamp The geo-politics of EU energy supply Norway covers between 10 and 18% of EU oil demand and about 15% of its natural gas. The country, a member of the European Economic Area since 1994, is the world's third largest exporter of oil and gas after Saudi Arabia and Russia. Energy Commissioner Andris Piebalgs is holding talks with his Norwegian counterpart Roger Enoksen on 30 August in Brussels to examine ways of strengthening a bilateral energy dialogue launched in 2002. The issues include increasing Liquefied Natural Gas (LNG) deliveries to Europe as well as the opening in October 2006 of the "Britpipe" linking Sleipner in Norway to Easington, UK.(on time!) By 2015-2020, natural gas deliveries from Norway are expected to grow from 85 billion cubic meters to 120bn, EU officials said. However, talks on longer-term exploitation of the expected huge oil and gas reserves in the Arctic will probably attract most attention. The region is believed to hold 25% of the earth's hydrocarbons, according to the US Geological Survey. And as international demand for fossil fuels continues to rise, the High North is attracting growing interest from big oil and gas companies. However, a territorial row between Norway and Russia in the so-called "disputed zone" of the Barents Sea has so far prevented further exploration, let alone commercial exploitation of these resources. "The potential is huge," says a Brussels employee of Statoil, the Norwegian state-owned energy company who says clarification is needed on access, ownership and production rules in the region. A "broader international agreement" is needed for the Arctic, he says, adding that "increased political focus" would serve the area. According to Statoil, natural gas deposits in the Arctic could provide as much as 15 billion cubic meters of gas per year, or 7-9% of the EU's entire gas consumption by 2020. Other problems include the high costs of deep offshore drilling and environmental concerns such as the oil and gas industry's coexistence with fisheries.

The latest deal between Russian and Algerian state-controlled energy companies seems to make sure that Europe becomes more vulnerable, as it will increasingly depend on a limited number of fuel suppliers. On August 4, Russia's Gazprom and Algeria's Sonatrach signed a memorandum of understanding on closer cooperation. The document lists possible areas of joint initiatives between Russia and Algeria, including liquefied natural gas (LNG), geological prospecting, pipeline construction, asset swaps as well as "marketing oil and natural gas in Algeria, Russia and third countries." Of all the Russian-Algerian plans for future cooperation, it is the possibility of the two countries collaborating on gas prices that causes serious concern in Europe. If such a scheme is realized, some analysts note, many European Union member states will find themselves "at the mercy of two of its three largest natural gas suppliers."

A top Russian environment official stepped up his attacks on the Royal Dutch Shell-led $20 billion Sakhalin energy project saying Moscow wanted damages for every destroyed tree or damaged river. "If criminal cases are opened for everything, the company will read the Criminal Code, come to its senses, and stop the barbarian activity," Oleg Mitvol, deputy head of Russia's environmental agency, told reporters in Sakhalin. (Elif Kaban and Michael Stott,28 September). - The Federal Service for the Inspection of Natural Resources Use said that it had filed suit seeking to revoke approval for Sakhalin-2, a $20 billion oil project on the Pacific island of Sakhalin led by Royal Dutch Shell. . . .The service said in a statement that the suit was filed due to "unfulfilled recommendations, details of which are included in the state ecological review, and multiple digressions," along with project operators' failure to take necessary anti-erosion measures... The move is the latest in a growing number of complications for the project, whose major investors include Shell, Japan's Mitsubishi and others. The project halted pipeline-laying work at a second location along the 800-kilometer route after a complaint by the Natural Resources Ministry. - The motivation for this action remains hotly debated among experts as well as the governments of the EU and Japan. Observers have suggested that the ministry's attention toward Sakhalin-2 was aimed at pressuring Shell to offer state-controlled gas</page><page sequence="19">Fuel for Thought 1001 monopoly Gazprom better terms as it hopes to join what will be the world's biggest liquefied natural gas development. - This dispute has a long history and relates, like to much else, to the recent political past and many unresolved legal issues, especially the controversial sub-soil legislation of the early 1990s. The relationships between the Russian state as sovereign and commercial entities remains to be clarified, with Russia wanting to reassert its control over its natural resources, the state's main source of income. Foreign technical assistance has been sought since 1991 , first from a University of Houston team (which succeeded in persuading a Russian official taskforce to re-write the public policy objectives, the structure of the Russian SFSR Mining Code, and to write the Law on Subsoil anew in almost complete deviation from the tested standard Russian and USSR legislative procedures.), later from the EU when a larger civil law component was sought. After the EU funding was released, the Petroleum Advisory Forum was founded and made the PSA (production sharing agreements) as their main goal. - By late September TNK-BP, half-owned by BP Pic also had reasons to be concerned.. Its licence to operate the huge Kovykta gas field was in doubt. (Apparently BP was expected to meet terms under its original licence agreement that no longer made sense because originally outputs were no longer needed by the Irkutsk region). However, if this output is not produced, the firm could lose the right to operate the field, other affected include Royal Dutch Shell and ExxonMobil. (From Moscow Times , Sept. 6 2006, Issue 3491). Apparently, Gazprom wants to get into the consortium and discusses an asset/share swap with Shell (Sakhalin II vs. Access to gas in Western Sibiria). Furthermore, Sakhalin-II and two other consortia headed by foreign corporations seem to be under pressure from the government. Sakhalin-I, headed by Exxon (30%) has been refused a license expansion by the state. (Note: Sakhalin-I: 55% Exxon, 25% Mitsui, 20% Mitsubishi). Sakhalin-II: 30% Shell, 30% Japanese Sakhalin Oil Gas, 20% Rosneft, 20% Indian Oil Gas. - All of the PSA-consortia were concluded during the 90s when the Russian state and Russian corporations lacked financial funds and/or special knowledge for the Sakhalin projects. The (foreign) corporations were granted special export allowances and financial advantages (tax, customs etc.) in order to invest and develop the Far-East energy resources. Macroeconomic factors have changed fundamentally and opposition to PSA has risen, so no new PSA are expected to be concluded. But now there seems to be a new "initiative" to weaken the grandfathered PSA already in force. Keywords are "unfair advantages", "no foreign control over natural resources" etc. With regards to Sakhalin-II the Russian Environment Agency has taken Sakhalin Energy Ltd. to a Moscow Court over alleged violations of the environmental restrictions to the project. Sakhalin Energy denies the claims. The court actions may also threaten the LNG-Terminal in planning and contractual obligations for LNG deliveries. Mr. Igor Shovalov, Deputy Head of the Presidential Administration, proposed to give up the PSA voluntarily as they would cause too much trouble for all involved. The main winner with regards to an end of PSA rules would probably be Gazprom."

( Jack Barrett , September 2006) Methane estimates A dramatic increase about 12,000 years ago in levels of atmospheric methane, a potent greenhouse gas, was most likely caused by higher emissions from tropical wetlands or from plant production, rather than a release from seafloor methane deposits, a new study concludes. This research contradicts some suggestions that the sudden release of massive amounts of methane frozen in seafloor deposits may have been responsible for - or at least added to - past periods of rapid global warming, including one at the end of the last ice age.... There are still important questions to answer about methane in Earth's atmosphere and the role it may play in global warming, the scientists said. For one thing, the current understanding of methane sources and sinks does not completely explain the isotopie signature of methane now found in the atmosphere. This indicates that estimates of methane emissions, including the human-made contribution, may have to be revised.

While solar magnetic activity cannot explain away global warming completely, it does seem to have a significant impact. "A couple of years ago, I would not have said that there was any evidence for solar activity driving temperatures on Earth," says Paula Reimer, a palaeoclimate expert at Queen's University, Belfast, in the UK. "Now I think there is fairly convincing evidence." ( New Scientist, 16 September 2006) - If you look back into the sun's past, you find that we live in a period of abnormally high solar activity. Periods of high solar activity do not last long, perhaps 50 to 100 years, then you get a crash. It's a boom-bust system, and I would expect a crash soon. (Nigel Weiss, University of Cambridge, 16 September 2006) - Sunspot numbers are well on the way down in the next decade.

Indeed, it is supportive of Theodor Landscheidťs prediction ("New Little Ice Age instead of Global warming?", Energy &amp; Environment 2003, v.14 no.2&amp;3) who began his abstract with: "Analysis of the sun's varying activity in the last two millennia indicates that contrary to the IPCC's speculation about man-made global warming as high as 5.8C within the next 100 years, a long period of cool climate with its coldest phase around 2030 is to be expected." Is warming accelerating? According to Von Storch at a recent science meeting in Stockholm (see report), the second most important evidence for man-made global warming is accelerating warming ..." If there is accelerating warming, then von Storch's claim has merit. But is there really? Several climate sceptics doubt the evidence (Eschenbach, Beran). Chris Freitas comments:" I recall seeing another analysis of the all the date sets (CRU, GISS and NCDC) with the same results. Who is correct? Did Hans von Storch give references for his claim? (Chris de Freitas). Richard Courtney replied (14 Sep 2006) that Von Storch ignored the repeated observation of Carter that there has been no global warming since 1998. One apparent reason for the warming claim may simply be a consequence not of observation but of a Bayesian Assessment of Climate Change Using Multimodel Ensembles '(Seung-KiMin and A Hense, Meteorologisches Institut, Universität Bonn)... Abstract: "A Bayesian approach is applied to the observed global surface air temperature (SAT) changes using multimodel ensembles (MMEs) of the IPCC Fourth Assessment Report (AR4) simulations and single-model ensembles (SMEs) with the ECHO-G coupled climate model. A Bayesian decision method is used as a tool for classifying observations into given scenarios (or hypotheses). The prior probability of the scenarios, which represents a degree of subjective belief in the scenarios, is changed into the posterior probability through the likelihood where observations enter, and the posterior is used as a decision function. In the identical prior case the Bayes factor (or likelihood ratio) becomes a decision function and provides observational evidence for each scenario against a predefined reference scenario. Four scenarios are used to explain observed SAT changes: "CTL" (control or no change), "Nat" (natural forcing induced change), "GHG" (greenhouse gas-induced change), and "All"(natural plus anthropogenic forcing-induced change). Observed and simulated global mean SATs are decomposed into temporal components of overall mean, linear trend, and decadal variabilities through Legendre series expansions, coefficients of which are used as</page><page sequence="22">1004 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 17, No. 6, 2006 detection variables. Parameters (means and covariance matrices) needed to define the four scenarios are estimated from SMEs or MMEs. Taking the CTL scenario as reference one, application results for global mean SAT changes for the whole twentieth century (1900-99) show "decisive" evidence (logarithm of Bayes factor 5) for the All scenario only. While "strong" evidence (log of Bayes factor 2.5) for both the Nat and All scenarios are found in SAT changes for the first half (1900-49), there is decisive evidence for the All scenario for SAT changes in the second half (1950-99), supporting previous results. It is demonstrated that the Bayesian decision results for global mean SATs are largely insensitive to both intermodel uncertainties and prior probabilities". (The paper can be obtained from A. Rorsch (arthur@keykey.nl) Carbon dioxide and glaciers Much is made, by some scientists, of the parallelism of carbon dioxide content of the atmosphere and climate. Unfortunately there is often a fundamental error in the reasoning as to the meaning of this parallelism. I first became aware of this problem when I saw a speaker show a graph of what was called climate through the late Pleistocene with the carbon dioxide history on the same graph. Unfortunately his "climate curve" was the ice volume curve derived from oxygen isotopes. He insisted that the ice volume was an adequate proxy for the climate. Ice volume is not climate. It is the integral of the excess of snow accumulation over wastage, and thus the ice volume must lag behind the climate. If the ice volume and carbon dioxide are parallel, the carbon dioxide must follow behind the climate. As long as effect must follow cause, the carbon dioxide cannot be driving the climate. It must be, historically, a dependent variable .(Reid A. Bryson, Center for Climatic Research, Emeritus Prof, of Meteorology, of Geography, and of Environmental Studies) The oceans are cooling!

We compare here the available data sets related to Earth's reflectance, in order to assess the observational constraints on the models. We find a consistent picture among all data sets of an albedo decreased during 1985-2000 between 2-3 and 6-1 Wim 2, which is highly climatically significant. The largest discrepancy among the data sets occurs during 2000-2004, when some present an increasing reflectance trend, while CERES observations show a steady decrease of about 2 Wim 2."

This can be solved by the new ISCCP data, where the cloud increase 2000-2004 is mainly due to increasing mid and high clouds. These high altitude clouds will increase the Earth's reflectance, especially if the increase occurs over the relatively dark oceanic areas, but the net forcing of these high cloud changes is probably near zero or even positive, due to their strong infrared absorption." The Lyman et al paper suggests that the net forcing is actually negative. The Wielicki et al 2005 Science paper is entitled "Changes in Earth's Albedo Measured by Satellite" by Bruce A. Wielicki, Takmeng Wong, Norman Loeb, Patrick Minnis, Kory Priestley, and Robert Kandel with the abstract: "NASA global satellite data provide observations of Earth's albedo, i.e., the fraction of incident solar radiation that is reflected back to space . The satellite data show that the last four years are within natural variability and fail to confirm the 6% relative increase in albedo inferred from observations of earthshine from the moon. Longer global satellite records will be required to discern climate trends in Earth's albedo. " Thus the Wielicki et al 2005 paper was published to refute the Pallé et al Science paper. An unsettling issue with the two Science papers, is that Pallé was refused the opportunity to publish a response to the Wielicki et al criticism of their research. This is yet another example where a magazine that reports on climate science has inappropriately taken sides on an issue, and used its position to squelch alternative views of the science. The Lyman et al paper, which documents ocean cooling, provides scientific support for the finds in the Pallé et al study. (Roger Pielke Sr, Climate Science, 1 September 2006, Courtesy CCNet 6/9/06) - The reported over 20% loss of upper ocean heat content between 2003 and 2005, which had accumulated between 1955 and 2003, is a very important observational finding. According to the paper, this cooling corresponds to -1.0 (+/- 0.3) W/meter squared global radiative imbalance over this time period. This is a significant observation, which has important climate science implications. None of the multi- decadal global climate models predicted such a cooling. (Roger Pielke Sr., 10 August 2006) The hurricane debate continues "The important conclusion is that the observed SST increases in these hurricane breeding grounds cannot be explained by natural processes alone," says Wigley. "The best explanation for these changes has to include a large human influence." The 'warm' tropical oceans are but a thin lens of warm water overlying the cold abyss and separated by the thermocline. The lens is warmed by solar radiation absorbed through the surface layer and cooled by entrainment of cold water across the thermocline, conduction and evaporation into the atmospheric boundary layer, and net IR radiation from the surface. Changing up welling will change the entrainment of cold water across the thermocline, thus changing the temperature of the mixed surface layer and the rate of loss of energy from the surface (conduction, evaporation and IR rediation emission are all SST dependent). It is not necessary to run models to ascertain the cause of SST variation, only collect observations. I suggest that Dr Wigley has a narrow view of the climate system. It should also be recalled that 1997 was the year</page><page sequence="24">1006 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 17, No. 6, 2006 of record low number of tropical storms in the Atlantic. There is no statistically significant linear increase over the period 1906-2005." (William Kininmonth) Neither side is short of logic "My field of research is the logic of the AGW debate. Neither side is "short on logic." The arguments on both sides are extensive, detailed and deep. There are easily at least 10,000 arguments here. I have worked in litigation support, where my job was to advise my client, usually the one getting sued, as to the relative strengths and weaknesses of both his arguments and his opponent's arguments. Underestimating your opponents arguments is a good way to lose." 8/17/06 David E. Wojick wrote: Summary of IPCC • IPCC 1990 agreed that we could not determine the timing, magnitude nor regional impacts of AGW (although it then gave estimates based on crude GCM). • IPCC 1995 claimed that the data 'suggests' that there was a 'discernible' human influence on climate. • IPCC 2001 claimed that it was 'likely' (greater than 66 percent chance) that the global warming of the past 50 years was due to human influence. So, even IPCC admits that there is as much as one chance in three that recently observed global warming is not due to human cause .(William Kininmonth 21.8.) Comments Jack Barrett: "The problem is one of finding a needle in a haystack and the IPCC reckon they have found it, or at least discerned it. When the C02 concentration has risen by 30% or so and the surface temperature has risen by only 0.2% the problem becomes obvious. Radiative theory indicates that the increased C02 should provide extra warming and the exaggerated sensitivity value used by the GCMs supports the idea. Some of us reckon that the sensitivity should be around 0.1 rather than the 0.5 K (Wm-2)-1 used by the GCMs. (17.8.02) IPCC not always wrong Perhaps readers need reminding that Castle and Henderson had expected that "If the IPCC had accepted PPP rates, the emissions projected in the scenarios would have been reduced.... but we revised our views for reasons which are set out in the attached article (published in E&amp;E).. The SRES team should indeed not have used exchange-rate-based comparative figures of GDP per head; but since their procedure incorporates an offsetting error (a point we did not at first pick up) the implications for emissions are not serious. (David Henderson, 23/08/2006) DOE not IPCC initiated AGW research Long ago I heard a rumour that the AGW hypothesis was first selected as worthy of funding, by the USA Department of Energy in order to protect nuclear power from the growing attack by environmentalists. Blaming GW on carbon dioxide seemed a good strategy, if you believe in conspiracies or even simple strategic thinking, for doing just this. How true is this DOE involvement? I recently received a small piece of evidence and would welcome more. Raymond S Bradley in an interview with Ted Feldman (on</page><page sequence="25">Fuel for Thought 1 007 line, 30.9.2000 stated that he and two others, one of them being Mick Kelly of UK) - revealed that the DOE was indeed interested in global temperature research. They went to the DOE in the mid-1970s to get funding for 'to assemble a global data base of temperature data ' and were, because DOE "was getting involved in climate variability research in relation to C02 and energy policy issues." Money therefore went to the University of Massachusetts and from there to CRU, East Anglia, where Mick Kelly was later replaced by Phil Jones. Most users of global surface temperatures use the databases assembled by this group, with marine data sets from NOAA and the UK Met Office. The DOE was the only funder at the time, as far as Bradley remembered. Funding started in 1981, so the DOE must have decided its research priorities during the 1970s. I was told the interest in C02 dated back to the late 1960s. Is this enough evidence for the claim that the DOE supported the AWG hypothesis early in order to support its energy policy? (Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen) Wet or dry? Sahel's uncertain future Climate change in Africa's Sahel region challenges researchers and policymakers because the best models around predict opposite outcomes, reports Catherine Brahic. The semi-arid Sahel stretches across Africa just south of the Sahara. The region suffered severe drought during the second half of the 20th century, and the famine it caused is thought to have claimed hundreds of thousands of lives and affected millions more. Scientists initially believed that the decline in rainfall was caused by overgrazing and people clearing vegetation to make way for more farming and herding. But since the mid-1980s, several computer models have suggested that changes in the surface temperature of the oceans have changed the dynamics of the West African monsoon and are therefore to blame. This hypothesis has gained widespread support but there is still some disagreement. Different models point the finger at different oceans - some say the influence of the Indian Ocean is most important, others the difference between the North and South Atlantic. Most scientists agree that the greenhouse gases and aerosols that human activities release into the atmosphere are partially to blame for changing ocean temperatures. The question, then, is how this will affect future rainfall. Again, the answers depend on the models used. Last year US-based researchers Martin Hoerling and James Hurrell looked at all of the most recent climate models, averaged them out, and came to the conclusion that the Sahel's recent fate would be reversed in the 21st century. Global warming, they concluded, would bring much-needed rainfall to the region - one of the very few positive outcomes of greenhouse gas emissions (see Decades of drought predicted for southern Africa). But in late 2005, Isaac Held of the US National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration published the results of a new climate model that suggested that, far from becoming wetter, the Sahel faces a period of "dramatic drying" if greenhouse gas emissions are not checked (see Climate model refutes predictions of wetter Sahel).... Why the differences? Understanding why the models predict such widely divergent futures "is a scientific priority that requires really getting into the bowels of the models" says A.Giannini, a climate expert at Columbia University in the United States. "There must be something in the models' physics that is causing them to</page><page sequence="26">1008 Energy &amp; Environment • Vol. 17, No. 6, 2006 respond differently." "One thing is clear," says Richard Washington, a climate scientist at Oxford University in the UK. "If we carry on with the models as they are, we are just going to get different answers all the time, so we need to fix their basics. "Part of the problem is simply that scientists have little data about the West African monsoon to build into the models. (Extract from Timo Hamaranta 4 .8.2006) Decreasing Carbonl3/12 ratio "There is a simple explanation to the decrease in Carbon- 13/ 12 ratio, which is related to well-known isotope effects on separation processes and chemical reactions. There is an extensive literature on this also in the geochemical field, but it seems some forces, among those the IPCC, do not want to hear about this. ...So, as IPCC and the book "The Carbon Cycle" edited by Tom Wigley claim, that a decreasing Carbon- 13/12 ratio is proof of anthropogenic burning fossil fuels being responsible for the observed atmospheric C02 level increase is just nonsense and wishful thinking. (Peter Stilbs, September 2006) NUCLEAR HIGHLIGHTS (end of July - end September 2006) International The GNEP In early 2006 the Bush administration unveiled the Global Nuclear Energy Partnership (GNEP) 4 a long-term research and development program almost as audacious as the Manhatten Project'. Fuel reprocessing is at its heart The US would lease reactor fuel to other countries which would return their spent fuel. One assumption of the project (DOE) is that mid-century, there will be 1000 nuclear power plants compared to the current 441, too many for the available uranium supply. However, GNEP is the fifth such project dreamt up the DOE in as many years.

Three reasons for this policy reversal have been suggested ; climate change ..just in case; Yucca Mountain - only short lived 'dirty daughters' would have to be shipped there, taking decades rather than 10,000 years of guarding, and the availability of plutonium ad hence mixed oxide fuel from the dismantling of Russian weapons. The size and infrastructure of MOX making was greatly increased, spent fuel should not be treated as waste... MOX will not remain cheap "if the Bush-Cheney administration decides to establish a barely cost-effective MOX programme in competition with the Russians , the motive may be essentially unrelated to addressing global warming or the Yucca Mountain hysteria." A solution to the Iranian enrichment crisis may have occurred to the USA... Bushehr could be fuelled by MOX.
