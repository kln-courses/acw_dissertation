<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Mythology of All Races. Vol. VI: Indian. A. B. KEITH. Iranian. A. J. CARNOY. Marshall Jones Co.: Boston, 1917. Pp. IX, 404, 5 figs., 44 pls. Price $6.00. Keith and Carnoy are to be heartily congratulated on these first attempts at a historical and synthetic treatment of Indian and Iranian mythology. Carnoy's account is the first of its kind. For Indian mythology there are a few adequate works on special subjects such as Macdonell's Vedic Mythology, Hopkins' Epic Mythology, Grtinwedel's Mythologie des Buddhismus in Thibet und der Mongolei and Buddhistische Kunst in Indien (translated by Burgess); but there is no general historical treatment. Both accounts adequately fulfill their purpose as popular summaries; both will also be of value to specialists. Keith's judgment is sober and cautious; Carnoy is more speculative and venturesome in the projection of facts into theories. Keith devotes two chapters to the Rig-Veda, one to the Brahmanas, two to the Epic, one to the Purdnas, one to Buddhism, one to Jainism, and one to Modern Hinduism. Carnoy divides his material into the treatment of the wars of gods and demons, of myths of creation, of the primeval heroes, of legends of Yima, of traditions of the kings and Zoroaster, of the life to come. Keith keeps strictly to the main line of mythology and offers little on the development of myth to legend, folklore, and traditional history. Carnoy devotes much space to the latter development in the Persian</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 107 epic. In India the mythological material is so vast, the historical background so obscure, and so little of the preliminary work of analysis and classification has been done that no well-rounded treatment of the subject as a whole is possible at present. Much of the material of the so-called Indian mythology is Dravidian rather than Aryan, but it is impossible at present to distinguish Aryan from Dravidian with any certainty. The most satisfactory chapters of Keith are those on the Rig-Veda, the Brahmanas, and the Epic. Here he is completely master of his material. The mythology of the Purdnas, of Modern Hinduism, and of Jainism is sketched cursorily in only the broadest and most general outlines. The chapter on Buddhism is the least satisfactory of all. Here Keith's touch is not so firm and sure as in the earlier chapters. Keith argues (p. 188) that "we have no assurance that a single Buddhist text which has come down to us is even as early as two hundred years after Gotama had departed." So much may be granted, but if this assumption is made it is not fair to claim that we have "the authority of the Buddha himself for his abode in the Tusita heaven and his descent from it" (p. 194) or to speak of "the Buddha's belief in his own super- human nature" (p. 193) and "the natural explanation that the Buddha, like his followers, regarded himself as really divine" (p. 195). In India myths and legends develop with amazing rapidity, and two hundred years are not to be dismissed lightly. If no text can be assigned with certainty to the period within two hundred years after Buddha's death there is no certainty that the important mythological matters ascribed in the Pali texts to Buddha himself can be earlier than two hundred years after his death. This is admitted by Keith himself on p. 188: "for we have not, and never can expect to have, any conclusive proof as to the actual views and teachings of Gotama." The contention on p. 189 that "it was clearly more easy for a preacher of faith in a personal god to become regarded as himself a god than to deify a man who ex hypothesi was no god and had no real belief in the gods" may be true of the Anglo-Saxon mind, but is, I think, utterly fallacious in the case of the Hindu mind. In the dispute between those who approach Buddhism from the point of view of the Hinayana and the Mahayana texts respec- tively one thing is certain, that the Pali texts represent the ideas of only one Buddhist sect. Different groups of monks interpreted the enig- matical teachings of the Buddha according to their own thoughts and feelings. The Pali canon does not give us the unified tradition of Buddhism before the early split into sects, although it preserves much</page><page sequence="3">io8 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. s., 20, 1918 that is at variance with the professed doctrines of the Cinghalese school. Much that is put into the mouth of the Buddha may be due to speculative accretion generations after his death. The "thus I have heard" is no more proof of originality than is the corresponding formula of the Ma- hdymna texts. Further, many elements in the life of the Buddha himself (if any of the traditions concerning his life and deeds go back to real memories of his followers) show that he himself lived a life of ministry nearer in many ways to the Bodhisattva ideal of the Mahdymna than to the Arhat ideal of the Hinaydna. Both Keith and Carnoy (pp. 5, 25, 30, 263) refer to the names A-ru-na-a'-'i-il (or U-ru-w-na-a'-'i-el), In-dar (or In-da-ra), Mi-it-ra- a_-si-il, and Na-ga-at-ti-ia-an-na found in the Hittite records at Boghaz- kdi as Indo-Iranian. The reviewer has tried to show in a recent article in The American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literatures, 1917, pp. 261-82, that the matters involved are, as yet, purely linguistic ones on which no historical conclusions should be based. Keith argues here (pp. 125 ff.), as in previous articles, that Krishna was originally a vegetation-god, become anthropomorphic. He is over- skeptical of the possibility of men becoming gods in India. The classical prejudice against Euhemerism is not valid for India. In the case of Krishna it is much easier to explain the mythology as a later accretion (as in the cases of Buddha and Mahdvira) than as fundamental. The reviewer can interpret the Krishna of the epic only as a man deified. Where among the vague anthropomorphic figures of Indian mythology is there one which has become so concretely human as the Krishna of the epic? The Krishna (son of Devaki) of the Chandogya Upanishad 3, 17, 6 cannot be lightly dismissed as not identical with Krishna (son of Devaki) of the epic just because the identification invalidates a theory that Krishna must be a sun-god or a vegetation-god. The passage of Patafijali (p. 126 and Zeitschrift der deutschen morgenliindischen Gesell- schaft 64, p. 536) is far too late to prove that the mythological elements were original. Keith argues (Journal of Royal Asiatic Society 1915, p. 547) that a mere man is not sufficient to explain the mythological elements of the Krishna story. It may be answered that a mere god is not enough to explain the concrete human figure of the epic Krishna. On p. 126 Keith does not express definitely his attitude toward Garbe's very doubtful identification (Indien und das Christentum, pp. 215 ff. and Archiv fur Religionswissenschaft, I913, p. 537) of Buddhist Rum- mindei (Lumbini) with Rukmini, the name of Krishna's wife. There is no convincing proof that Krishna worship had penetrated so far east-</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS og09 ward by the sixth century B.C. For philological difficulties in the way of the identification see Charpentier (Indian Antiquary, 1914, p. 18). Keith (p. 177) is inclined to follow Garbe's theory that the (vetad- vipa story is to be explained on the basis of Hindu contact with Nestorian communities in the vicinity of the Balkash Sea. Garbe (in Indien und das Christentum) has summed up the weighty evidence against Weber's theory that the story is to be explained as referring to Christian com- munities at Alexandria; Pelliot ( T'oung Pao 1914, pp. 623-44. Cf. Laufer in American Anthropologist, 1916, pp. 572-3) has made available material which utterly invalidates Garbe's theory, at least so far as present evidence goes. There remains only the conclusion that the story is mythical (see Charpentier, Journal Asiatique, 1910, II, p. 605). It is most unlikely that any early Christian community could have served as the basis of such a description. The story may belong to the same development as that which resulted in the Buddhist descrip- tions of Sukhavati. It is more probable that the word dvipa of (vetad- vipa is to be connected with the mythical dvipas of Hindu cosmology than with any actual island. In connection with the story of the Bhavisya Purana (p. 183) con- cerning the " Magas" Keith might have referred to the important collec- tion of material made by Spooner ("The Zoroastrian Period of Indian History" in Journal of Royal Asiatic Society, 1915, pp. 63 ff., 405 ff.). Spooner's theories are far more pretentious and wide-reaching than the facts warrant, but the article should stimulate a closer consideration of the possibilities of early intercourse between Persia and India. Jack- son's "Notes on Allusions to Ancient India in Pahlavi Literature and Firdausi's Shah Namah" (in Festschrift Windisch, p. 209) seems to have escaped notice in the bibliographies of both Keith and Carnoy. It is by no means certain that the starting point for the personifica- tion of Vac was the thunder (p. 53). That is one of Yaska's guesses not fully corroborated by the evidence of the Rig-Veda itself. Vac is probably the personification of the voice (spoken word or hymn) which, as the sacrifice assumed a cosmic aspect became cosmic too. The bibliography, though well chosen, is, of course, far from com- plete. I would add at least such titles as Dowson, A Classical Dictionary of Hindu Mythology and Garrett, A Classical Dictionary of India- helpful, if not useful for scholarly purposes; 0. E. Martin, The Gods of India (Dent, London, 1914)-an uncritical but very useful popular account; Vans Kennedy, Researches into the Nature and Affinity of Ancient Hindu Mythology-old, but giving many translations from the</page><page sequence="5">I IO AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N.

Lists are given of all the articles in the first eight volumes of Hastings, Encyclopcedia of Religion and Ethics, bearing on Indian and Iranian mythology. Keith maintains a wise reserve on the question of the early relations between Buddhism and Christianity. Sub judice lis est. The Simurgh story as related by Carnoy (p. 289) has striking parallels with the story of Garuda in MahTbhhrata I, 29, 30. Carnoy's description of Nargarihsa as the sacrificial fire in India (p. 284) and references to pages 44-45 is not borne out by the statement of Keith, who refers to Nardgarhsa as " the personification of the praise of men, or possibly the flame of the southern of the three fires, which is particularly connected with the fathers." Naragamtsa is a very uncertain figure. There are several different theories concerning him. Carnoy has done a great service in calling attention to many curious coincidences between Iranian myths on the one hand and Indian and Babylonian myths on the other. No definite conclusions can be drawn, as yet, from what may be mere coincidences, but as the historical evidence becomes fuller such collections of parallels will be valuable. He deserves high praise for the success of this first effort to treat Iranian mythology historically and to bring Avestan mythology into connection with the legends of the later Persian epic.
