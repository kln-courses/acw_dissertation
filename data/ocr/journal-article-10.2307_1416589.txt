<plain_text><page sequence="1">BOOK REVIEWS regarded in the annals of human thought. On this account, and because of the critical scientific attitude of the author, the book is of significance. He does not hesitate to bring into the discussion mention of Noah's dove re- turning to the Ark, and other legendary incidents which indicate early views. Consider- able space is given to the legendary, the near scientific, and the scientific inquiry into the behavior of animals as regards their sense of direction and orientation at a dis- tance as well as to that of man. The latter is, of course, the main problem of the treatise. The author notes the efforts of the erudite mind to extricate itself from the anthropomorphic and fanciful interpretation of natural and psychological phenomena. One notes the author's severe criticism of Darwin for disregarding the now esteemed 'law of parsimony' with the implications of animistic meanings, and of even more recent interpretations such as are found in Jacques Loeb's mechanistic conception- for example in his "tropisms." Those who still hold to 'instinct' will find little com- fort here, and such speculative writers who are still willing to base their conclusions on reports from travelers on the sense of direction and orientation of the uncivilized will find that such peoples when placed under controlled conditions do not possess any such natural sense of direction. The book is to be regarded as a negative reaction to Levy-Bruhl's theories as they were accepted in France. For the 'mysterious sense of direction' or capacity for distant orientation in either animals or man, the author substitutes as a working principle the guidance by landmarks and other stimuli at hand of all such behavior. While further experimentation is still needed, doubtless this principle will eventually be established. It is noted that American psychologists have not fallen into the pitfalls of anthropomorphic interpretations of such behavior and of other instinctive conduct. University of Denver THOMAS R. GARTH Das erlebende Ich und sein Dasein. By OTTO JANSSEN. Berlin and Leipzig, Wal- ter de Gruyter &amp; Co., 1932. Pp. viii, 247. This book belongs to that German school of philosophical thought the develop- ment of which is marked by the names of Husserl, Scheler, and Heidegger. Its phe- nomenological method and its problems are not those of empirical psychology and cannot be represented adequately without a considerable discussion of the philosophi- cal implications. The book can be recommended only to the philosophically inter- ested and trained reader. The first part discusses the 'living and experiencing ego.' Ego is shown not to be subject to any definition; its chief characteristic is that of being a 'who' and not a 'what.' Emotions, wishes, attitudes in which the ego 'lives' constitute the sphere of the 'ego-belonging' (das Ichzugehorige) as opposed to the 'ego-strange' (das Ichfremde): colors, shapes, etc. However, pathological experience shows that the intrinsic bond between the 'ego' and the 'ego-belonging' can be loosened (deper- sonalization), and even the apparently impossible duplication of the ego in its own field is achieved in some cases of splitting of personality. In the second part the relation of ego to being and consciousness is discussed and relational theory of con- sciousness is sharply criticized. Of interest is the author's evaluation of the phenomenological method. Through- out the whole book he argues against the logistic interpretation of the phenomeno- logical findings which ascribes to them apodictic validity. He shows repeatedly that relationships apparently constitutive for the ego (e.g. its non-spatial character, its 363</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS unchangeability, its uniqueness in its field) can prove empirically non-valid under special conditions, and are therefore only probable, not necessary. This, as the au- thor himself points out, stresses the empiricism of the phenomenological method, but at the same time the acknowledgment of a discrepancy between phenomenological and empirical findings leads to the problem of validity and limitations of the phe- nomenological method. It would seem to one that this problem, though seen clearly by the author, is not solved adequately by the introduction of the concept of 'Gel- tungswechsel:" a mysterious, logically unexplainable, non-temporal change of an in- trinsic relationship, which for example makes possible the entering of the essentially non-spatial ego into the sphere of the spatial. Worcester State Hospital E. HANFMANN Man as Psychology Sees Him. By EDWARD S. ROBINSON. New York, Macmillan Co., 1932. Pp. vii, 376. In this book Robinson attempts to present some of the experimental findings of modern psychology together with a general point of view toward man and his nature, in such a way that they can be understood by the above-average reader who is not technically trained in psychology. In the reviewer's opinion he has succeeded admirably in this endeavor. The book is divided into two parts, the first dealing with man and his nature from the modern psychological point of view, the second part discusses psychology as a science. In the first part, the topics of motivation, heredity, learning, thought, person- ality, and the mind-body problem are dealt with. Many psychologists will find the last topic a little out of place but it is adequately treated in a manner comprehensible to most of those who will read the book. The reviewer feels that the first chapter, that on motivation is the weakest, drawing rather heavily as it does on doubtful psycho- analytic concepts and explanations. In justice to the author it should be said that such concepts are presented tentatively, conservatively, and without explicit endorse- ment. It is doubtful, however, that uncritical readers will recognize this. The chap- ter on learning, although the most technical in the book, is perhaps the most adequate. The point of view presented in part two is eclectic-the agreements, rather than the differences among the schools and men in psychology, being stressed. The present limitations of psychological information and doctrine are pointed out. For a sane, conservative, authoritative book on psychology for the general reader the reviewer knows of none better. University of North Dakota C. W. TELFORD Genetic Psychology. By A. R. GILLILAND. New York, Ronald Press Co., 1933. Pp. xii, 351. The evolution and the development of structures and functions are traced through 20 chapters, the subjects of which are suggestive of the contents. This work on genetic psychology is presented by the author as, "with one exception, the only text of recent times, which reflects the evolutionary or genetic approach to psychology." Chapters I and II are introductory in character. The first states the essential problem of a genetic psychology and the second considers the general characteristics of life and the theories as to its origin.
