<plain_text><page sequence="1">1 Epiphanies and Signs of Power: Minoan Suggestions and Comparative Evidence WALTER BURKERT I. Introduction A specialist in Japanese culture who did anthropological research at Hateruma, an isolated and relatively primitive island of the Ryukyu Group, encountered a strange custom: one day of the year people would assemble and go to a certain place at the seashore and stay there for hours, looking out into the sea. They would remain there, staring into nothingness, until something would appear on the glimmering surface, a ship, a boat, orjust a drifting log, an uncommon splash of water, a fish or a seal. When this had happened, they would quietly go home.1 This may be more than a curiosity. These island dwellers, surrounded by the infinite ocean, are not satisfied to live on a possibly blessed island within their own closed circle of life, even if the soil is granting the basis of livelihood and they have no pressing needs. There is this longing that something should arrive from without, to break into their eventless paradise. "Hope for the unhopeable," Heraclitus enjoined (DK 22 B 18). I am inclined to interpret also the famous sculptures of Easter Island in such a sense. For centuries the inhabitants of that lonely island have been working on giant figures of stone who all look out into the sea: Something should arrive. For hundreds of years they stared in vain. Such expectation of the unexpected is answered by the phenomenon which historians of religion call 'epiphany,' in Greek epiphaneia? It is not just the case that certain beliefs are held among certain people and are said to get sparse confirmation, nor that lively imagination has created a pantheon of anthropomorphic gods who may become directly visible to eidetic persons. The very existence of religion seems to point to the fact that humans are unwilling to function in a closed system, within their own circumscribed field. They tend to break borders at least in fantasy, looking for otherness, or they claim that others have crossed the boundaries from 1 Cornelius Ouwehand, oral communication.

What is known and familiar to each individual will be just a small and unsatisfactory section within a vast surrounding sphere of the unknown. There is the tendency, the wish, the passion for getting beyond, for uncommon encounters, for epiphany. Gods are "not obvious" (adelotes), as Protagoras stated.3 All the more people are aroused and waiting: "Shouldn't the obscurity be broken by a sudden flash of light?" There are claims of "real" experience at such events, of "visions." These immediately develop into eagerly accepted tales. Tradition will be formed, poetic tradition most of all; quasi-literary conventions are established. But ritual organizations also arise to keep or even to reproduce the experience. Modern events such as the emergence of Lourdes fall into this category. Poetical convention is free: from the Veda to Sappho's most famous poem,4 gods are described as setting out from their home, mounting their chariots, flying through the air from afar, and arriving. In epic tales such as Gilgamesh or Homer,5 men may happen to meet gods, as if by coincidence. There is equal freedom to produce representations, pictures, statuettes, and statues of gods in normal or abnormal forms and thus to create more tangible tradition out of fantasies. Man-made imagery will reciprocally influence ideas, dreams, and visions. We need not discuss here the possible psychological background of epiphany experience, altered consciousness, a medium's trance, ecstasy, or mere dreams.6 Note that Greek seers in a medium's trance do not "see," but speak in a way difficult to understand.7 Sometimes epiphanies are described as overwhelmingly powerful or even dangerous: "Harsh are the gods appearing clear and directly"; "Woe to me, I am lost: I have seen the King."8 Hence the experience is often minimal and somehow lessened: Isaiah did not see much, the house was "full of smoke," he heard the voice that decreed his mission.9 Ezekiel "beheld" the Lord in human shape, and he fell down; the rest was listening.10 King Ramses describes his encounter with God Amun, his "father" in the midst of the battle of Qadesh: he heard him calling from behind.11 Athena, too, in book one of the Iliad, stands 3 Protagoras, DK 80 B 4. 4 Sappho, fr. 1 (Voigt). 5 Gilgamesh meets with Ishtar (6. Iff.) and converses with the Sun God (Old Babylonian version X. iii. 1; Dalley 1989: 149). For Homer, see Kullmann 1956. 6 For an example of epiphany in a dream, see the Ugaritic Keret text, Pritchard 1969: 143.

"Do not look," Odysseus says to Telemachus, when a strange light fills the room; it is Athena holding her lamp, the poet tells us.12 Tales often elaborate what one could call epiphany in retrospect. These are encounters with strangers, or strangers paying a visit, who are recognized to have been gods afterwards by some sign or some consequence, be it blessing or punishment, or both.13 Athena, playing the role of Mentes or Mentor, leaves "like a bird," and Telemachus gets an inkling: this has been a god.14 The woman at Helen's sanctuary who changed an ugly baby into the most beautiful girl of Sparta: was this the goddess Helen herself?15 No need to decide. There are horror stories too, e.g. about personified Pestilence taken across the river by a ferryman; a tale variously attested in Germany.16 Further reduction of epiphany just leaves signs. Take the beginning of Callimachus' Hymn to Apollod1 How the laurel branch of Apollo has shaken, how the whole house: flee, flee, whoever is a sinner! And lo, Phoibos is rattling the door with his fine foot; don't you see: the palm tree suddenly has made a pleasant bowing, and the swan is singing beautifully in the air: Open by yourself, bolts of the doors, by yourself, keys; the god is no longer afar—and you, youngsters, make yourself ready for singing and dancing. The signal to flee forbids gazing; what is really visible is the movements of laurel and the palm tree; unclear sounds are heard and remain unchecked, including the unlikely singing of a swan. Firm and clear.is the performance of sacred ritual, the youths who start singing and dancing. There is no miracle, but signs suggesting religious experience enshrined in ritual. Thus not infrequently ritual means waiting for a sign, rather like Hateruma. So also the Roman ritual of inauguratio, as described by Livy. This of course is legend, but based on actually practiced ritual. Numa the future king is led by the augur to the Capitol, he is made to sit down on a stone, looking south. The augur sits down to the left of him, with veiled head, holding the augur's staff, the lituus in his right hand. He determines the regiones of the sky; then, taking the lituus in his left hand, and putting his right on Numa's head, he prays:18 12Horn.,//. 1.196-200; Od. 19.40ff. 13 On divine guests, see Burkert 1993. 14 Horn., Od. 1. 320; cf. 3.372. 15 Hdt. 6.61.

This is waiting for something to appear, be it bird or lightning.19 It is not prediction of any kind which is at stake, but reassurance in a moment of crisis. When the signs are observed, the ritual has been successful. The ritual power of the augur has limited the sphere of observation, and he names the signs which he wants to arrive. We may still wonder how long Roman augurs would have waited in such a situation. Cicero refers to the dreary routine which had taken over for augurs in his days: "Do you see?"—"Yes I see," without looking at anything.20 Epiphany has been effaced by administration. II. Minoan Epiphanies That epiphany played a central role in Minoan religion has become a commonplace, especially since the seminal study of Friedrich Matz, Göttererscheinung und Kultbild im minoischen Kreta. The basic evidence was already in Nilsson's Minoan-Mycenaean Religion.21 Matz, studying "the belief in bodily apparitions of the gods,"22 takes iconography for his basis. It seemed established that divine images were unknown in Minoan Crete, and distinct temple buildings were not to be found either, whereas religious ceremonies were prominent in the iconography of seals, rings and frescoes; and hence "beliefs" could be deduced. Since Matz's work some new findings have modified the picture, especially the remarkable ivory statue of a male god from Palaikastro; note also the figures with bronze locks from Knossos as reconstructed by Robin Hägg.23 But the impression remains that Minoan art and religion is different simply because those houses of gods known from Egypt and the Near East are absent, as are the cult statues belonging to them. The comparatively big clay images from Ghazi and Karphi are a new development within the sub-Minoan epoch.24 We also find temples and bronze statues of gods at Cyprus from the twelfth century B.C.E., but not earlier.25 Even the aniconic image of a goddess, that 19 Cf. three days' waiting for lightning 8i* cepnaxo&lt;; at Athens, Boethius 1918:1-12; waiting for a meteor to depose the king at Sparta, Plut., Cleom. 11. 20 Cic., Div. 2.70-73. 21 Nilsson 1950:330-88; Matz 1958; see also Hägg 1986; Marinatos 1993: 175-84. 22 Matz 1958: 28.

As far as I know, epiphany in Minoan religion, ever since Nilsson and Matz, is claimed to be found in three distinct forms: 1) Birds representing gods, or, the other way around, gods performing their epiphany in the form of birds. 2) The advent of little images high up, as if flying through the air, arriving from afar in a cultic context. This is peculiar to the imagery of gold rings. 3) Goddess impersonation, a priestess clad in special garments and seated on a throne to perform the role of a goddess. We still have no idea of the Minoan language, in spite of thousands of Linear A documents; we do not know names of gods nor terms of cult. Quä philologists, we are groping in the dark. What I am still trying do is to collect possible scenarios from other adjacent or later civilizations that might somehow fit the evidence adduced for Minoan epiphanies and thus correspond to experiences or celebrations deduced from iconography. I am not claiming to reconstruct belief but to recover possible contexts of demonstrative religious behavior. I am not claiming direct connections or direct continuity in any case, but I am using parallels, indirect parallels in all probability, to bring pictures alive amidst the resources of a broad and multifarious yet generally compatible Near Eastern-Aegean world-view. III. Birds "Eine längst ausgemachte Sache ist es, da!3 die Minoer an die Erscheinung einer Göttin in Vogelgestalt glaubten," Matz wrote in 195 8.27 The evidence is from pictures and figurines, with the Haghia Triada sarcophagus leading the ranks: as the offering at the altar and the libation through a large vessel is performed, birds are perching at the double axes.28 There are other representations of birds in similar contexts, e.g. three columns which may represent a sanctuary, with doves at the top.29 Later there are birds on the head of one of the goddesses from Gazi.30 Martin Nilsson wrote: "The bird is a form of the epiphany of the gods," but also: "The birds are signs of the presence of the deity."31 The two 26 Sophocleous 1985: Plate 1.1. 27 Matz 1958: 17; cf. Nilsson 1950: 330-40; Pötscher 1990: 102-07; Marinates 1993: 155— 56. For other interpretations of Minoan birds as souls, thunder birds, or just "heaven," see Nilsson 1950: 338-39. 28 Nilsson 1950: 426-42, esp. 427; Nilsson 1967: Plate 10.1/2; Buchholz-Karageorghis 1971: n. 1065b; see also Pötscher 1990: 171-91. 29 Nilsson 1950:331. 30 Nilsson 1967: Plate 14.4. 31 Nilsson 1950:330.</page><page sequence="6">6 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) statements are not at all equivalent, but point to a crucial difference of interpretation: Are the birds "the embodiment of the deity"—this too is an expression used by Nilsson on the same page—or an indirect sign of unseen presence, as the song of the swan in Callimachus? Should we assume the moving experience of a miracle, or just a sign noticed with a titillating "perhaps"? In the absence of Minoan texts, this is impossible to decide. All the more, the uncertainty should be kept in mind. The idea that gods do appear in the shape of birds is derived from Homer and has always been reinforced by this evidence.32 The main scene is in book seven of the Iliad. Athena and Apollo for once have agreed to stop battle and to arrange for single combat; Greeks and Trojans sit down, and Athena and Apollo sit down, too, "similar to birds, to vultures, on a tall beech tree of father Zeus," (€(eo0T]v, öpyiaiv eoiKOteg oclyuirioioiv / (jniycoi ecj&gt;' üi|/r|XfjL; 7. 59-60). Readers of Homer since antiquity have tried to get rid of those birds at the tree, to make the gods sit under the tree, not on the branches; but the text is there. Furthermore Hypnos,"Sleep," hides on a tree, "similar to" a certain bird called chalkis or kymindis ("owl"; 14. 286-91). Then there are three scenes in the Odyssey. Athena going out of sight "like a bird," leaving Telemachus (1. 320); Nestor's sacrificial feast "similar to a vulture," (&lt;t&gt;iivr|i etõopivri; 3. 372); finally during the "killing of the suitors," after encouraging Odysseus in the shape of Mentor, Athena flies up to the roof and sits there "like a swallow" (22. 240). Dirlmeier has contested the metamorphosis of the gods and tried to keep to metaphors, which remains unconvincing. But even if these birds are embodiments, they can hardly be called epiphanies. They are rather hiding, suggesting the "perhaps" of retrospect. Only in the mnesterophonia Athena is active. But is she still a bird when she is shaking her aigis (22. 297)? A swallow could hardly do that. Of course gods can move like birds, as Hermes flying to Calypso's island (Od. 5. 51-53), but this is poetry, not religious experience. As additional evidence for bird epiphany in the Greek Bronze Age those little gold ornaments from Shaft Grave IV at Mycenae are regularly adduced, the nude goddess with her doves, and the temple. Seldom has it been acknowledged that this goddess with her doves just represents a very common type of Syrian iconography:33 there is no question of embodiment; the doves belong to the goddess as her retinue, her helpers,34 her messengers, and, in real life, as sacrificial animals too, raised in appropriate 32 Critical discussion in Dirlmeier 1967. 33 Nilsson 1950: 333; 1967: Plate 23.3/4; Pötscher 1990: 102, without the oriental counterparts, for which see Winter 1977: 53-78; Keel 1984: 58-62; Burkert 2000. 34 See the myth about Derketo/Semiramis raised by doves in Ctesias, FGrH 688 F 1 = Diod. Sic. 2. 4.4.</page><page sequence="7">Walter Burkert 7 buildings at the respective temples.35 Doves were good to eat, after all, throughout the ages. The Semitic context comes out in the testimony about the festivals Anagogia and Katagogia at Elymian Eryx, Sicily, festivals of the goddess called Aphrodite by the Greeks and Venus Erucina by the Romans, a goddess who leaves and comes back. When she has left for Africa:36 After nine days one dove, outstanding by vigor and beauty, is seen flying in from the sea . . . and clouds of other doves accompany her, and again the people of Erys celebrate a festival (Katagogia, adventus). Could the one especially beautiful dove be the goddess herself? The tale intentionally leaves this open; there remains the "perhaps." The goddess leaving and coming back in the company of birds seems to appear in a post Bronze Age Cretan document, the picture on a ninth century B.C.E. pot from Knossos, published by Nicolas Coldstream.37 A winged goddess, on her chariot, is represented arriving on the one side, and leaving on the other. On the first side there are flourishing trees with a bird perched on one of them, and the goddess holding up two birds herself, whereas on the other, the tree's branches are hanging down, and the birds are flying off from the goddess' hands. Goddess and birds belong together, they act together, reconfirming their message. But there is no question of identity. Nevertheless new evidence may overturn the balance: on the Minoan rings from Sellopoulo and Kalyvia (Marinatos in this volume, Figures 8 and 9), a huge bird appears as a vision of the worshipper. It seems that this bird is a god. This is how Alcaeus around 600 B.C.E. celebrates Apollo's advent at Delphi; the text is only extant in a very free paraphrase of Himerius, a fourth-century C.E. orator, but it retains its effect:38 Nightingales are singing, swallows and crickets are singing ... the Kastalian fountain is flowing with silver rivulets,. . . even water can notice the advent of gods. Compare vase paintings that show Apollo flying on his swan.39 Birds mark the adventus. The god may keep hiding. Bird metamorphosis is not unknown in the Aegean-Near Eastern world. Prominent is the Egyptian myth how Isis took the form of a falcon to mate 35 Sacrifice of doves in the cult of Aphrodite Pandemos: IG II/III2 659; cf. Luke 2:24; Matt 21:12.

Somewhat closer to Homeric motifs is the Ugaritic myth of Aqhat who is killed by the goddess cAnatu and devoured by vultures. In the decisive scene of danger, "eagles were hovering over him, . . . between the eagles cAnatu was hovering."41 Was she just one within the flock of birds of prey, or distinguished somehow? The Ugaritic text does not express this. Later Greek stories of gods changing into birds are well known, such as Zeus the swan mating with Leda, or Zeus the eagle carrying off Ganymede 42 This is on the same level with Zeus changing into a bull, or into a golden rain in his amorous exploits. Pausanias tells about the gold ivory image of Hera in her temple in the Argive Heraion:43 A cuckoo is perched on the scepter which, they say, means Zeus, because when Hera was a virgin, he changed into that bird, and she hunted for the bird as a plaything . .. As a monument this scepter could recall Minoan imagery, but the tale has Zeus in disguise rather than performing his epiphany. Bird epiphanies overlap with bird watching in general, although it should be noted that Minoan iconography never suggests bird watching, never shows humans staring at those birds (but see Marinatos in this volume, Figures 8 and 9, where the visionary actually sees large birds). Bird omens (omina), auspicia, are most common in the ancient world-view. What is remarkable is that these signs very often do not mean prediction, but only reassurance and confirmation. The Roman inauguratio for Numa has been mentioned already. Romulus, at the foundation of Rome, was installed by the Augurium Maximum:44 Romulus and Remus were sitting as augurs on two different hills, watching for birds to appear. Lo! Romulus was the first to see twelve eagles. This was no forecast, but simply the decision needed at the moment: the birds' arrival gave authority to the ruler. This may still be called "epiphany," ending a conflict and deciding human affairs from above. The role of bird appearances to invigorate, to confirm, to console, is found in Homer, too. For example, Priam in the twenty-fourth book of the Iliad. As Priam starts on his difficult and dangerous expedition to meet 40 Impressive relief from the Temple at Dendera, see Mettinger 2001: 173, Figure 6.2. 41 KTU 1, 18, iv 31-32, cf. 18-22; de Moor 1987: 246, cf. 245; Pritchard 1969: 153. 42 LIMC 4 (1988), first representation with eagle, fourth century B.C.E., n. 200 = Piin., HN 34. 79. There is no iconographic connection with the oriental image of Etana riding the eagle: Ward 1910: 144, nn. 391-94; Weber 1920: 105, Figures 402-04. Note that Etana uses a "real" eagle to get up to heaven; to make the bird a god seems to be a purely Greek idea. 43 Paus. 2. 17.4. 44 Enn., Ann. firs. 47, 77-96 (Vahlen) = 46, 72-91 (Skutsch); Livy 1. 6. 4.

These birds are not gods, but they make visible the power of fate. Less important is bird watching for the selection of a daidalon, the wooden image to be burnt finally on Mount Kithairon, at the special festival of Plataiai. Pausanias reports that people go to a wood at Alalkomenai and lay down pieces of meat:46 They watch the raven which has caught a piece of meat, (to see) on which tree it will sit down; and the tree on which it has sat down, this they fell and from this they make the daidalon. There is no explicit speculation about the relation of that raven to any god, but the bird perching on a tree gives the sign for action. With the daidala ritual we may feel close at last to Mycenaean ritual, with the tree, the bird, and the fire festival. A daidaleion, which should mean "place of the daidala," is attested at Mycenaean Knossos.47 Fire festivals at the peak sanctuaries are a well-attested feature of Minoan religion. Unfortunately Minoan is not Indo-European—this should warn us not to set out for a great synthesis. IV. Sky-born Epiphanies A special kind of iconography has received primary attention ever since Nilsson and Matz;48 it seems to be "unique to Minoan Crete."49 Quite often, on golden finger rings, there appears a small human-like figure hovering in the air as if arriving from afar. There are no parallels in other Bronze Age iconography—"a remarkable departure from the established traditions of the orient."50 It is easy to assume that the Minoans devised this form to represent some special religious experience. A central piece of evidence is the ring from Isopata.51 It shows whirling females, dancing according to the common view, while a little figure with long locks and whirling skirts is flying down from above towards the raised 45Horn.,//. 24. 315; cf. also 8. 247,10.274. 46 Paus. 9. 3. 4.

See Cain 2001.</page><page sequence="10">10 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) hands of these women. Matz spoke of the "combination of dance, ecstasy and adoration."52 An equally well-known piece is the gold ring from Mycenae, which has a procession towards a goddess in a cosmic setting, with sky, moon and Sun, and with a little figure above in a figure-eight shield.53 A gold ring from Knossos has a little figure with a spear or staff descending in front of a pole and a sanctuary, with a female in a gesture of adoration.54 There are more pieces, not to be enumerated here, gold rings mostly and seal impressions (see Marinatos in this volume).55 The interpretation in the sense of epiphany has been generally accepted, but the context or contexts have remained enigmatic. C.D. Cain in a recent article writes: "The layers of uncertainty . . . ultimately baffle attempts to establish narrative connections."56 In this volume, Marinatos offers a new interpretation, still in the direction of narrative, based especially on the newly found Poros ring (cf. Marinatos, Figure 4): these are gods meeting other gods, comparable to what have been called scenes of "sacred conversation." If so, the scenes may not qualify as epiphanies. Thus uncertainties have been multiplied. Without dispelling these, I shall call attention to some tales about what may come from above: gods, signs, or sizeable objects. This does not explain the Minoan imagery, but it might contribute to reduce its isolation. Comparable to some extent with the Minoan pictures are Greek representations of the Dioscuri arriving for their theoxenia, small figures riding through the air above the huge couch prepared for them.57 Other gods too are believed to arrive for their festival, but they are never represented in such a fashion. The unique vision of the Dioscuri goes with another unique form of their epiphany, the undisputable reality of flames—in fact, electric discharge—striking ships in a thunderstorm (St. Elmo's fire).58 This miracle, inexplicable at the time, is firmly believed to be these gods" epiphany. Fire apparitions, fire miracles, and fire falling from heaven make a wide field of ideas, expectations, or experience of the divine. They may go 52 Matz 1958: 9. 53 Nilsson 1950: 347; Marinatos 1993: 159, Figure 143. On the problem of calling this figure a palladion, see Marinatos 2001; Nilsson 1950:354-55. 54Pötscher 1990: 157; Marinatos 1993: 173, Figure 171. 55 Note a seal from Zakro, Nilsson 1950: 283; Pötscher 1990: 120, with a temple structure towards which a descending figure is flying.

At Krastone in Thrace, during a sacrificial festival of Dionysus:59 If the god is about to make a good year, a great blaze of fire appears, and this is seen by all the people who stay in the sanctuary. Possibly the myth of Hephaistos falling from heaven towards the Sinties at Lemnos recalls a Lemnian fire festival.60 Quasi-magical production of fire by the use of a mirror seems possible. More dramatic is the ritual on Mount Carmel depicted in the Elijah story of the Hebrew Bible.61 From morning to night the priests of Baal perform their ritual invoking Baal: they dance, they wound themselves, they go into ecstasy, but nothing happens. Finally Elijah calls on Yahweh, and behold, fire falls from heaven to consume his offerings on the altar. This is Yahwist propaganda with a parody of "pagan," Canaanite ritual. It has the quest for epiphany, nay enforcement of epiphany by prayer, by uncanny performances, and by ecstasy. It is interesting that a somewhat parallel story was told at Lindus on Rhodes. At the birth of Athena the Rhodians went up to their acropolis to sacrifice at the altars, but they had forgotten fire, hence they prepared for sacrifices without fire, and later they still kept the custom of fireless offerings. But behold: "For them Zeus moved on a yellow cloud and made much gold rain down"; this was the origin of the riches and the crafts of Rhodes.62 A sign of selection, of special benediction from "Zeus, mover of clouds." The miracle comes from above as an answer to the ritual endeavor of men; in this case fire or lightning turns into gold. At the sanctuary of Aphaka in Syria:63 When the people come together in the place at a certain time, fire appears in the air, in the form of a torch or a globe. Another text, referring to the abolition of the rite by the Christians, recalls:64 Upon invocation, on a certain day, from the heights of the Lebanon, fire, darting through the air like a star, plunged into the river nearby; they said this was Urania —thus they called Aphrodite. The ritual invocation is answered by fire falling from above towards the sanctuary, and this is the goddess herself, performing her epiphany. Here 59 Arist., Mir. ausc. 122,842a21. 60 Cf.

It might be tempting to make a jump from these late testimonies to Bronze Age Ugarit and towards Minoan-Mycenaean connections from there. Let us rather be content with an imaginative scenario. What falls from heaven may be much more tangible in certain cases. The Greeks have special words for such objects, õioPXtitov or, possibly older, õieiiteie*;. This word is interesting because, with the element diwei-, it seems to point to a very old, Mycenaean and pre-Mycenaean heritage.65 A belief, widely diffused as it seems, is that stones fall down from heaven together with lightning: "thunder-stones," thunderbolts, kerauniai in Greek; these are collected and preserved, they are exhibited, they are believed to protect against lightning. Some of these may have been stone implements from the Stone Age, "celts" and axes,66 some actual meteors. In Byzantine times the emperor Alexius sent, among other valuables, a "star-axe" or rather "lightning-axe," bound in gold, as a present to the German King Henry IV (aatpoTreXeKiv).67 This brings us to the divine images called õiopXrrra in antiquity. The stone representing the Mother Goddess at Pessinus, transported to Rome in 203 B.C.E. was claimed to have fallen from heaven.68 Scholars acutely concluded that this must have been a meteor, which gives a comforting scientific background to these things falling from above. Meteors are rare and difficult to find. The piece of Aigos Potamoi, said to have fallen in 467 B.C.E. which had given the idea to Anaxagoras that the sun was a piece of glowing metal, was shown for centuries and even worshipped by the neighboring people.69 Pliny mentions a piece at Abydos which he says was venerated even in his time.70 If the image of Ephesian Artemis is called õioiretet; in the New Testament, this is probably an improvisation of the author of Acts who seems to be not too well informed about Ephesus.71 There remains the palladion fallen from heaven, to õunetei; nodXaÕLOv, which seems to have been a fixed concept. Normally a palladion is taken to be an image of armed Pallas Athena, i.e. a 65 The orthography Siciiwrfc attested in Zenodoros, Porphyry on Iliad 16. 174 (in Erbse 1975: 204); Di-we (Aifei), dative of Zeus, is attested in Mycenean. The word Sutctik is a standard epithet for rivers in Homer, but in Alcm. 3. 67, from the seventh-century B.C.E.,, it has become öiamexiic and is used for a "star falling across the resplendent sky," evidently a meteor. Lengthy discussion in Schmitt 1967: 221-36; see also Risch 1973: 82-83.

An isolated notice speaks about palladia that fell from heaven at the fight between gods and giants.73 Another story concerns the family of gephyraioi at Athens and the Athenian sanctuary enl nocAAaõtun. A palladion, they said, arrived flying with the clouds and came to rest precisely at a bridge (nubibus advectum et in ponte depositum), to give their name to the gephyraioi,74 But the most famous palladion was the one from Troy; and this too was "hurled down:" When Ilus, the mythical founder of Ilion/Troy, was founding his city, he "prayed to Zeus that some sign should appear to him; when day had come, he saw the palladion, fallen from heaven, lying in front of his tent." Others said that the palladion "came falling through the air to Tros, king of Phrygia."75 It is difficult to judge how old such stories may be. We recognize the ritual pattern which is familiar by now: the quest for a sign of confirmation, while a founder is building a city; he prays to the sky god, and behold, the sign arrives. The palladion from above is nearly equivalent to the twelve eagles which appeared for Romulus, or the celestial sign that was to inaugurate Numa, king of Rome. Another strange story appears in the context of Pindar's biography:76 When the flute-player Olympichos was being taught by Pindar, at the mountain, where he made this training, there occurred a great noise and fire falling downwards; and Pindar, noticing that, saw a stone image of the Mother of the Gods coming towards his feet. Pindar hence established a sanctuary of the Mother Goddess at Thebes close to his house.77 He did so, the tale goes on, even before the city could react to the apparition. The scenario is unique, but still has some familiar traits. Here it is the context of music which seems to trigger the epiphany, cosmic music, since the flutist bears "Olympus" in his name. It is strange that the Mother Goddess who usually is taken to be a personification of Earth should come from Heaven, but this conforms to the (legendary or real) 72 See Burkert 2000. "Phylarchos in FGrH S\ F47. 74 Servius, Comm. in Virg., Aen. 2. 166; cf.

If religion needs otherness, needs epiphany, even the power of earth could be confirmed from its opposite.78 These tales from Troy, Thebes or Pessinus will not help too much to understand Minoan scenarios, but they still seem to reduce its isolation. Note that Minaon epiphany-scenes are mainly bound to gold rings, i.e. to persons of high social standard, and they are never repeated; each item is a special composition. This makes them very personal documents. Should they belong to some "quest for a vision" in a situation en marge, as Pindar retiring to the mountain? But to repeat: this is not an argument for continuities or direct interrelations, but an attempt to figure out possible scenarios for what is hinted at in the fascinating but mute Minoan evidence. V. Goddess Impersonation: The Priestess Enthroned When Evans excavated the West Wing of the Palace of Knossos, he found a room with a throne, adorned by frescoes, accessible from the central court through an anteroom. There are griffons on either side of the throne, evidently guarding it. There was no doubt: this was the king's throne, and it was named "the throne of Minos" at once. Generations of visitors have been given this explanation when touring the "palace of Minos." There is no Bronze Age attestation at all for the name Minos. The "throne of Minos" comes directly from Homer's Netherworld, as reported by Odysseus:79 There I saw Minos, the brilliant son of Zeus, holding a golden scepter, meting out right to the dead, seated; and they around him asked his sentences, seated or standing in the house of Hades with its wide gate. For the ancients this was the starting point for the idea of the judges of the dead, with Aiakos and Rhadamanthys joining Minos. Moderns rather tend to say that the Homeric text has Minos the lawgiver continuing his activities after death. It was revolutionary when Helga Reusch, followed by Niemeyer, Hägg, and Marinatos, pointed out that in Minoan iconography, paired griffons only appear flanking a female, a goddess, not a male figure. Hence a female must have been seated on that throne, if not a real goddess. This would make a ceremony of divine epiphany.80 There is a compartment next to the throne room of the type called a "lustral basin" by Martin Nilsson and others, and "adyton" by Marinatos.81 Access to the throne room from inside 78 One Minoan ring seems to show a stone figurine or pillar in an epiphany scene; see Marinatos 1993: 186, cf. 176 79 Horn., Od. 11. 568-71. 80 Reusch 1958; Niemeyer 1986; Hägg 1986; Marinatos 1993: 53-54; 106-09 ("a priestess, dressed as a goddess," 108). 81 Nilsson 1950:92-94; Marinatos 1993: 77-87.</page><page sequence="15">Walter Burkert 15 passes a service section and a possible dressing room. Details of a possible ritual of god impersonation remain, of course, in the realm of imagination. But the argument for a female dominating the scenery is conclusive. There remains the question—and I think it is not just our rationalism to ask it: What does make her divine? Just the dress? And what would she be doing there? Different no doubt is Bronze Age evidence of how to select and to install a god's bride, as described in a long cuneiform text from Emar. Well known also is the wife of Amun in Egyptian Thebes; Herodotus attests a hierogamy at the top of the Babylonian tower.82 At Athens we have the wife of the archon basileus presented to Dionysus as a wife, in the ritual of Anthesteria; some vase paintings seem to allude to this ritual.83 Such encounters do not make the partners of the god divine. The Emar text closes with regulations of inheritance when the god's consort will have died, childless, of course. But as to Knossos, nobody has suggested that the throne ceremony was for marriage. In the later Greek evidence, there are a few cases when mortals play gods. In the mysteries of Andania certain people were made up to represent gods.84 The Iobakchoi at Athens have Dionysus, Kore, Palaimon, Aprodite among the participants at their drinking party.85 In the cult of Isis, two virgins were playing Isis and Nephthys the mourning goddesses with appropriate songs at the Osiris festival;86 priests don the mask of Anubis, the jackal's head, too.87 Best known, and controversial, is the story about Peisistratus, who, returning from exile, had a tall woman from Paiania supplied with armor and chariot and made heralds proclaim that: "Athena herself, honoring Peisistratus most of all men, is bringing him back to her acropolis." Herodotus, who tells the story, has his doubts whether the Athenians could have been that simple-minded to fall victims to such a trick. Moderns are split into those who believe that such a ritual of epiphany in procession was possible in archaic Greece, and those who would reconstruct several layers of propagandistic reinterpretations to turn Peisistratus' claim to owe his victory in the battle at Pallene to Athena into a silly masquerade.88 Comparable is a tale in a late author about Athena's sanctuary at Pellene in Achaia:89 82 Arnaud 1987: 326-37, and n. 369; Erman 1934:201-02.; 319-20.; Hdt. 1. 182. 83 Burkert 1983: 232-35. 84IG V.1.1390 = LSCG 65, § 4: öaac &amp; 5tl 6iaaKfuä(fo0ai el?

See Connor 1987. 89 Polyaenus, Stral. 8. 59.</page><page sequence="16">16 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) The Aetolians were marching against Pellene. In front of Pellene there is a high hill, opposite the acropolis; there the troops of Pellene came together and were taking up their arms. The priestess of Athena, who according to some custom was wearing full armor and a helmet with three crests on this day, the most beautiful and tallest of the virgins, came to look from the acropolis towards the crowd of citizens arming themselves. The Aetolians, beholding a virgin in full armor coming forth from the sanctuary of Athena, believed that Athena herself was coming as an ally for the Pellenians, and they beat a retreat. The Pellenians pursued them and killed a sizeable number of Aetolians. To wear armor and helmet seems to have been a regular ritual for Athena's priestess; to make this an epiphany was a unique event. Less serious is Xenophon of Ephesus in his romance about Habrokomes and Anthia at Ephesus: Anthia is by far the most beautiful of virgins at the festival of Artemis, she goes forth with golden hair, short purple garment, even with bow and arrows and followed by dogs. So "often when she was seen in the sanctuary, the Ephesians beholding her venerated her as if she were Artemis," and in the procession "some, stupefied, said she was the goddess."90 This seems a distant reflection of religion in rhetoric. Epiphany has been claimed by monarchs. Ptolemy V, king of Egypt, who changed from Macedonian to Egyptian-influenced style, was the first king to be called Epiphanes. He was thirteen years old in 197 B.C.E., when he was crowned with the title Ptolemaios Epiphanes Eucharistos, an adorable young Horos on the Egyptian throne.91 It seems that Antiochus IV the Seleucid king took the title from his cousin. Antiochus, who started the unfortunate conflict with the Jews, should have been called €iu|iavr|!; rather than €iu&lt;t&gt;ayr|&lt;;, as Polybius his contemporary dryly remarked.92 Christians were even more critical of such epiphanies. Herod Agrippa, the petty king of Palestine in 44 C.E., "put on his royal garment and sat on his tribunal"— the Roman seat of power has replaced the Hellenistic throne—and he gave a speech to his people that made them acclaim him a god. This displeased the Lord, and the Lord's angel struck Herod, and before long he was devoured by worms. End of epiphany.93 Serious ritual of a more special kind is presented in the account of Pausanias about the cult of Demeter at Pheneos in Arcadia. There they preserve a mask of Demeter Kidaria, he says, in a strange construction made of rocks, and once, at night, in the so-called greater festival, the priest puts on this mask and, "following some myth, he beats those under the 90 Xenophon of Ephesus, Ephesiaca 1.2.7. 91 OG/90.5 (Rosetta Stone). 92 Polyb. 26. la. 1, with anecdotes about the strange behavior of Antiochus; cf. 30. 25-26; Ath., Deipn. 5. 195c-f. 93 Acts 12:22.</page><page sequence="17">Walter Burkert 17 earth."94 Here a human male, by power of a mask, turns into the goddess Demeter, the angry goddess; he performs violent action, driving back uncanny powers, as it seems. Pausanias declines to explain this any further.95 Somewhat similar seems to be the oath ritual at Syracuse as described by Plutarch. This is the "great oath" which the women of the family of Dion made his future murderer undergo: "Going down to the Thesmophorion," after certain sacrifices he had to "don the purple garment of the Goddess and take the burning torch in his hands, and swear."96 Somehow identifying with the goddess, the man should be immune to subterranean powers and thus be considered absolutely trustworthy. These examples of goddess impersonation do not bring us closer to the Knossos throne. Another approach might be more promising, considering the function of a throne. The throne, together with crown and scepter, is a central sign of royal power in the Near East as in Egypt. Overthrowing a ruler means to take away his crown, his scepter, and his throne. The Hebrew Bible has imposing pictures of the throne of god, down to the vision of Isaiah: "I saw the Lord seated on a high and sublime throne." Psalms praise the throne of the Lord, too, with his enemies serving for a footstool.97 It was a unique privilege to have such a seat, with the others standing or crouching on the earth. In Egypt the throne seems to become identical with the goddess Isis who thus physically guarantees the sovereignty of the Pharaoh. But beyond the sphere of rulers, the throne also played a role in mystery initiations. Plato alludes to the thronosis in the telete of the Corybants, when they dance around the initiand in a way that must confuse him; Dion of Prusa describes such a ceremony in more detail, possibly referring to Samothrace.98 In the Orphic myth, Dionysus the child is set on the throne of Zeus prematurely, so the Titans, dancing around him, are able to allure him with playthings; leaving the throne, the child is put to death.99 As to Knossos, however, another ritual scenario seems more to the point: the Trophonius ritual at Lebadeia, described by Pausanias on the basis of his own experience, as he explicitly claims, means a journey to the Netherworld. How the priests would manage to perform this is left to conjecture; possibly by the use of drugs. It is the last phase of this strange experience which concerns us here:100 94 Paus. 8. 15.3. 95 Hermes is wielding a rod in an Anodos-scene; see Pelike of Rhodes, Berard 1974: Figure 63; cf. the use of a rod in the magic evocation of a soul in Clearchus, fr. 7 (Wehrli). 96 Plut., Dion 56. 5. 97 Isa 6:1; Ps 110. 98 Pl„ Euthphr. 277d; Dio Chrys., Or. 12. Burkert 1987: 89-90. 99 For a picture of this thronosis, see Kerenyi 1976: Figure 66b. 100 Paus. 9. 39. 13 ; see 9. 39. 5-40.2.</page><page sequence="18">18 Illinois Classical Studies 29 (2004) And the one who has come up from Trophonius, the priests take him again and make him sit on a throne which is called the Throne of Remembrance; it is situated not far from the Adyton; and when he has been seated there, they ask him what he has seen or come to know. And when they have learnt this, they permit him to join his relatives; and they guide him there... This means that unclear fantasies or memories of altered consciousness were to find expression and verbalization afterwards, a kind of unforeseeable revelation even to the priests who had manipulated the ceremony. The initiate, on account of his experience, is in a unique position, elevated beyond the limits of normal human knowledge. This is played out by making him sit on this unique "Throne of Remembrance," to tell what the gods may have revealed to him. There is a strange parallel in one of the most famous Greek cults, in the functioning of the oracle at Delphi. It is a woman selected on account of some special ability who is made to sit down not on a throne, but on a special contrivance which brings her right above the gap in the floor of the temple's adyton, the chasma. She somehow absorbs what is coming up from below, she goes into a state of altered consciousness, and makes utterances which are observed and interpreted by the priests who watch the performance. One speaks of going down even in the case of Delphi, even if there were just a few steps to mark the adyton within the temple. The ordinances of the god received in this way were called themistes—Apollo's activity is themisteuein—the very word used by Homer also for Minos sitting on his throne. Thus we see the Pythia as she takes a preliminary ritual of purification: she "goes down," she is "enthroned" on the tripod, and themisteuei. However, this scenario of Delphi is controversial in all its details since not much survives from the temple structure of the fourth century B.C.E. to reconstruct the adyton, and nothing from earlier temples. The account given here largely depends on descriptions by Plutarch, who knew what he was describing.101 The third example is the cave sanctuary of the Sibyl at Cumae, as it appears in a late and strange text, pseudo-Iustin's Cohortatio ad Graecos, a text probably from the fourth century C.E., but which was handed down among the works of the Christian apologist Justin Martyr from the mid second century. The author claims that he has personally been to Cumae. He is well informed: to his credit, he actually writes Kouma, not Kyme in the current Greek form, and he correctly describes the location close to Baiae. There is a large hall, he says, carved from one rock—possibly this is 101 SeeRoux 1971; Burkert 1985: 115-17.</page><page sequence="19">Walter Burkert 19 the great structure in the rock at Cumae, excavated by Maiuri—and in the midst of the hall there are three water-basins, carved from the same rock:102 When they had been filled, the Sibyl, they say, would take a bath in them, then take her clothing and go to the innermost room of the hall, still carved from the same rock, and in the midst of the room she would sit down on a high podium and a throne and thus speak out her oracles. The sequence of purification, taking a seat on the throne, and giving oracles quasi ex cathedra is equivalent to the Delphic procedure, and to the final section of the Trophonius sequence. Is something similar to be surmised for the situation at Knossos? Would this mean what was performed by the woman seated on the throne were not acts of ruling or meting out justice, but some form of "divination," not female ruling power, but moments of divine epiphany through a woman imbued with sacred authority? The inner access to the Knossian throne room passes a "lustral basin."103 The forms of the great man-made cave in the rock of Cumae somehow remind one of "Mycenaean" architecture. But let us not forget the hazardous steps from Minoan to Mycenaean, from Mycenaean to Iron Age Greece, from Greece to Southern Italy—we do not escape a quagmire of uncertainties.
