<plain_text><page sequence="1">JJQ Britain's Wild West: Joyce's Encounter with the "Apache Chief" Greg Winston Husson University What is this rubbish? he said. The Apache Chief! Is this what you read instead of studying your Roman History? Let me not find any more of this wretched stuff in this college. (D 20) Before all else, James Joyce's "An Encounter" is about the politics of reading. Prior to miching across Dublin, the boy-narrator and his companion Mahony encounter the ideology of London juvenile story-papers with their playmates. The opening allusion to three popular boys' periodicals suggests the culturally determined reading practices for this group of young Dubliners: "It was Joe Dillon who introduced the Wild West to us. He had a little library made up of old numbers of The Union Jack, Pluck and The Halfpenny Marvel" (D 19). After reading the western tales?or at the very least having them related by the ringleader Dillon?the boys emulate the action and characters from the stories by staging backyard Indian wars. They find in the Fleet Street fantasies materials for re-fashioning themselves and their surroundings so as to escape the tedium of school and home life. The influence of such extracurricular reading is something Father Butler fails to understand when he reprimands Dillon's brother Leo for reading the Halfpenny Marvel issue the "Apache Chief" in class. But apart from the title and Butler's heated reaction, Joyce provides no evidence as to the actual content of that story. What exactly has Leo Dillon been reading? Is the "Apache Chief" indeed "rubbish" and "wretched stuff" (D 20), or does the story simply enfiarne the priest because it interferes with his authority? Like Father Butler, readers have little more to go on than the title. This dearth of information is in keeping with the remarkable tendency of Dubliners stories to gen erate richer meaning from understated allusion than from lengthy exposition. It also owes something to the fact that Joyce could safely assume his early readers to be familiar with the Halfpenny Marvel and publications like it. To date, critics and commentators of Dubliners have generally taken the "Apache Chief" at face value, the title being sufficient to sustain the Wild-West motif begun in the opening.1 James Joyce Quarterly, Volume 46, Number 2 (Winter 2009), pp. 219-238.

By the time Dubliners was published, the three halfpenny papers had become household names, yet few, if any, twenty-first-century readers are familiar with these once ubiquitous periodicals. This eroded connection has taken with it a layer of inter pretive possibility for "An Encounter": in effect, the story's function as a Dublin-based parody of the single Halfpenny Marvel tale and issue it references. As with any effective parody, the logical drift is towards insightful cultural critique, in this case combined with ironic reflec tion of the racial and imperial assumptions upon which the source of parody is predicated. Using the American West as a trope for colonial Ireland, "An Encounter" condenses the interrelated issues of racial identity, imperial domination, and juvenile reading. As Elizabeth Butler Cullingford notes, such a trope is "complex, shifting and ambiguous in its relation to national or political allegiances."2 To the reader of Dubliners, such protean qualities should not be unfamiliar or unsettling. Several recent approaches have helped to emphasize the impor tance of reevaluating Joyce's fiction amid the overlapping contexts of colonialism and ethnicity.3 Since the mid-1990s, the cross-pollination of Joyce and postcolonial and Irish studies has helped to establish ways of reading Joyce's Dublin that avoid the all-too-reductive Ireland-England binary and concentrate instead on a more nuanced understanding of the varying range of subject positions that arise in colonial conditions. Derek Attridge and Marjorie Howes outline a "semicolonial" perspective that regards Joyce's fiction as convey ing "a complex and ambivalent set of attitudes, not reducible to a simple anticolonialism but very far from expressing approval of the colonial organizations and methods."4 This study will reconsider "An Encounter" in such a light, and through a newly discovered, likely source, "Cochise The Apache Chief" by Paul Herring, which not only provides Joyce's story with a realistic popular-culture allusion but furnishes a literary structure in which to portray the colonized status of the young reader-subject.5 As a failed imitation of Herring's Wild West tale, "An Encounter" implicates its source story, and the genre overall, as a cultural-ideological arm of British rule in late-nineteenth century Ireland. Joyce's appropriation and satire of a source text reveal how popu lar media, in the guise of children's literature, could (and still can) function as part of what Louis Althusser later identifies as the ideo logical state apparatus.6 Not unlike the schoolroom where it is dis covered, the "Apache Chief" ultimately serves as a highly controlling, programmatic function for its juvenile readers, despite the contention of Father Butler and other critics that the "penny dreadfuls" wielded 220</page><page sequence="3">a corrupting influence at odds with formal education. While seem ingly engaging juvenile readers with a discourse of unruliness and disorder, the Wild-West stories exemplified by the "Apache Chief" serve the political aims of the dominant culture, the British Empire in Ireland, by diverting the energies and indoctrinating the minds of its young consumer-subjects through their reading and recreation. While it offers no easy answer to the boys' dilemma, "An Encounter," owing to its emerging narrative awareness and multilayered parody, suggests the possibility of escape through artful revision. Harmsworth of the Farthing Press From the 1890s to the 1930s, at least one of the three story-papers read by the boys in "An Encounter" was available in all the major towns of Great Britain and Ireland. The combined circulation of the three weeklies ranged from 125,000 to 150,000 copies during the mid 1890s, then exceeded 200,000 by 1905/ Mere mention of the titles would have been enough to cement the association for the majority of Joyce's first readers. Such is not the case a century later, when the same publications have for decades been out of print or at best relegated to special collections and microfilm in a handful of libraries in Britain and the United States.8 Launched in 1893-1894 by Harmsworth's Amalgamated Press, the Halfpenny Marvel, the Union Jack, and Pluck featured tales of detection, warfare, exploration, and adventure. The basic format for each issue was one complete story of around 20,000 words set in two or three columns on thirteen to sixteen book-sized pages. The stories tended to repeat a formulaic structure in which heroes struggled and excelled in harsh settings, most often the far flung battlefields and outposts of Empire; they typically included what John Springhall terms "a strong military emphasis on manly heroism and romantic adventure" (118). According to Springhall, Pluck printed fictional accounts of military and civilian heroism in contested regions like South Africa, Afghanistan, and India; the Union Jack featured tales of British Army and Navy triumphs in adverse conditions around the world as they performed the wearisome but glorious work of Empire; and the Halfpenny Marvel published the early stories of detectives Sexton Blake and Nelson Lee, as well as S. Clarke Hook's tales about Jack, Sam, and Pete, "an Oxford graduate, an American trapper, and a Zanzibar negro who roamed the world clearing up international crises" (113). In addition, all three papers published scores of Wild-West tales of the sort favored by Joe Dillon and crew. Usually centered upon the heroic exploits of upper-class Englishmen in the North American wilderness, such stories offered a revisionist testament to the worth of British muscle and know-how in former colonial territories. They exhibited for young readers an 221</page><page sequence="4">James Joyce Quarterly 46.2 2009 unbounded pride in the mother country and its ruling class. In case the stories were not clear enough in their imperialist bent, the self-promotion for the Harmsworth boys' weeklies laid out an obvious agenda. Springhall quotes a brochure for the Union Jack that describes the paper as containing "stories relating to many phases of the British Empire. . . how we obtained our various colonies and stories of England's prowess on land and sea, and of her great naval and military heroes" and notes the proclamation of a 1912 edition: "[T]hese [boys'] journals aimed from the first at the encouragement of physical strength, of patriotism, of interest in travel and explora tion, and of pride in our Empire" (113, 109). Front-page promos for many early numbers of Pluck and the Halfpenny Marvel touted each as "[a] High-class Weekly Library of Adventures at Home and Abroad, on Land and Sea,"9 a slogan echoed with slight alteration in "An Encounter" by the boy-narrator's assumption that "real adventures . .. do not happen to people who remain at home: they must be sought abroad" (D 21).10 The change might owe something to the narrator's inaccurate memory of the promotional copy; or perhaps it is a con scious revision and calculated attempt to justify the "day's miching" with Mahony (D 21). Whatever the case, the imitative aspect is clear, as is the point that the British popular press has an indoctrinating impact on the young Irish reader, for even the most discerning and independent-minded of the Dillon gang appears to ape the ideals he encounters in the story-papers. On a commercial level, the Harmsworths intended to supplant the immorality (and undercut the price) of middle-class publications like the Boy's Own Paper, the Captain, and Chums, which had owned the market for popular juvenile reading during the preceding decades. Targeting a working-class audience, the brothers boasted that they would displace the so-called "penny dreadfuls" with a morally supe rior boys' literature at half the cost. Indeed, the phrase "penny dread ful" had itself originated in reformist declamations of the moral dan gers that stories of outlaws and adventure posed for young readers: captivated by the murderers and thieves depicted in many tales, these readers would presumably run away from the safe moral structure of home and school to embark on lives of crime and debauchery.11 Playing to this concern, the debut issue of the Halfpenny Marvel even went so far as to sound the death knell for its higher-priced competi tion: "No more penny dreadfuls! These healthy stories of mystery, adventure, etc., will kill them."12 To this end, the Halfpenny Marvel ran fictitious testimonials from appreciative headmasters, clergymen, and parents lauding the moral uprightness of the publication. For example, the Halfpenny Marvel of 13 May 1896 features the following letter of recommendation from "A. J. Nixon, Schoolmaster" of The Manhood Schools, Birdham, Chichester: 222</page><page sequence="5">Dear Mrs. Boughton, I have looked through the two numbers of the Marvel Library and as far as I can judge from these numbers, there is nothing objectionable in them, and they appear well suited for youths to read. If they succeed in doing what they profess to be attempting to do?"kill the penny dreadful"?they will be doing an excellent work. They are remarkably cheap, and it is wonderful how the books can be produced at the price. Yours faithfully, A. J. Nixon, Schoolmaster.13 Notwithstanding such ringing endorsements, the Harmsworth half penny papers produced the same sort of unsavory plots and dubi ous characters as their penny competitors. R. B. Kershner writes, "Ironically for a magazine generally regarded as cheaply sensational, the Halfpenny Marvel claimed the intent of counteracting the influence of unhealthy sensationalism aimed at children" (Joyce 33). In "An Encounter," Father Butler's hostility toward Leo Dillon's "Apache Chief" issue of the Halfpenny Marvel evinces a similar perception that the paper perpetuated the very immorality it claimed to abolish. The publishers, it seems, were quite aware of their editorial hypocrisy. Springhall notes Harmsworth even suggested to his brother in the early days of the Halfpenny Marvel that the paper be renamed the Boys' Weekly Reader because "[i]t soundfed] respectable and would act as a cloak for one or two fiery stories" (111). The name was never altered and remained until 1922, when the Marvel merged with Sport and Adventure, which would combine later with Pluck. Still, the con sideration of a name change shows Harmsworth in an ongoing effort to strike a balance between public morality and profitability. The politics of the Harmsworth papers were an extension of their publisher's own imperial conservatism. As J. Lee Thompson describes, "Harmsworth's political philosophy combined Tory popu lism, Disraelian imperialism, and a firm-belief in the 'Anglo-Saxon future.'"14 In 1895, Harmsworth ran unsuccessfully for a parliamen tary seat in Portsmouth in a campaign that promoted the pro-impe rialist views of Joseph Chamberlain. These ideals and the purchase of a baronetcy?he became Lord Northcliffe in 1904?to some degree belie Harmsworth's middle-class Irish origins. Nonetheless, Joyce seems determined to unmask Lord Northcliffe as a native son of Dublin when, in the "Aeolus" episode, the newest peer of the realm is referred to as the "Chapelizod boss, Harmsworth of the farthing press" (Li 7.732), an epithet that recalls at once his cheap journalistic sensationalism and suburban Dublin origin. The nickname denies Lord Northcliffe his newly bought social status, while the context resituates him somewhere in the no-man's-land between fiction and fact. He is first identified as the employer of Ignatius Gallaher, the arrogant Fleet Street newsman of "A Little Cloud," then immediately associated with his real-life friend Joseph Pulitzer, "his American 223</page><page sequence="6">James Joyce Quarterly 46.2 2009 cousin of the Bowery guttersheet" (U 7.732-33). The appositional phrase is far from complimentary, suggesting a breach of trust in both friendship and business. As Don Gifford and Robert J. Seidman note, on 1 January 1900, Harmsworth edited a special millennial edi tion of that "Bowery guttersheet," the New York World, but the two men became "estranged in 1907 when Harmsworth, despite a no-raid agreement, hired away one of Pulitzer's prot?g?s."15 While "Aeolus" offers this jab at Harmsworth's character, nearly a decade earlier, "An Encounter" had already launched a rhetorical assault on the politics and propaganda conveyed by his Amalgamated Press boys' papers. The attack is rooted in Dubliners' appropriation of the "Apache Chief." To study the source-story alongside "An Encounter" is to expose the colonizing effect the London media had on even the youngest Irish readers. For Dublin boys to read a British-imperialist version of the American West, then proceed to emulate its plotline, characters, and assumptions, exemplifies how the most disturbing work of the colonizer is to assume control not only of the land and resources but of the young minds of the colo nized. Such insidious activity in the realm of popular story-papers recalls Edward W. Said's definition of culture as "a sort of theater where various political and ideological causes engage one another . . . a battleground on which causes expose themselves to the light of day and contend with one another."16 In this sense, "An Encounter" becomes a theater of engagement and conflict, demonstrating what is at stake when cultural imperialism assumes the guise of juvenile reading. In essence, Joyce's story constructs an artful imitation of and critical response to the text it references, and in doing so, it illustrates how young Dubliners become subject to the intersecting ideologies of racialism and imperialism. At the same time, "An Encounter" sug gests the potential escape from these ideological nets, as Joyce offers a parody that complicates the ethnic and colonial propaganda of the Harmsworth papers. Oxford in Arizona The probable source of the "Apache Chief" allusion in "An Encounter" is "Cochise The Apache Chief," the featured story in the Halfpenny Marvel of 25 June 1895. Father Butler attributes the story in Leo Dillon's possession to "some wretched scribbler that writes these things for a drink" (D 20). In fact, the tale was written by Herring, a regular contributor to the Union Jack and the Halfpenny Marvel.17 Although the Harmsworth boys' weeklies published a steady stream of western stories, Joyce's decision to single out "Cochise The Apache Chief" might well be deliberate with respect to both content and chronology: its publication about seven months after the Joyce fam 224</page><page sequence="7">ily's move to North Richmond Street coincides with the end of Joyce's second spring at Belvedere College and occurs in close proximity to an actual day of truancy for James and Stanislaus that, according to Stanislaus, was the experiential source for "An Encounter."18 Analysis of the Herring source-text, particularly its ethnic assumptions and imperialist motifs, reveals complex interpretive possibilities for "An Encounter." "Cochise the Apache Chief" constructs an episodic sequence of incredible adventures and manly feats, grounded in a vocabulary of blatant ethnic stereotypes that articulates a pro-British imperialist bias. This ideological mixture serves in general to reassert British superiority over a former colonial territory and its landscape, climate, natural resources, and primitive peoples. "An Encounter" parodies numerous literary devices, racialist assumptions, and geo graphic features of Herring's tale, giving them a mock-heroic, urban Irish twist that underscores how young Dublin readers respond to the propagandist fiction of the Harmsworth story-papers. Numerous themes of the original tale, including martial violence, wilderness adventure, and male camaraderie, are co-opted and satirically reduced in Joyce's retelling. First, the title "Cochise The Apache Chief" is somewhat misleading in terms of the tale's true focus, which resides less with the real-life Indian leader than with a fictional English protagonist. Nevertheless, an editor's footnote about Cochise insists on historical verity: "This character is not an invention, but a real one. Cochise, the last of the great Apache war-chiefs of modern times, was at this period in his youth" (3). In an attempt at scholarly credibility, the editor goes so far as to cite an unnamed "American authority" who states, "There were formerly three principle war-chiefs of the tribe, under whose direc tion all hostile parties were marshalled?Mangus Colorado, Cochise, and Delgadito. Of these three, the only one now living who exercises any control over them is Cochise?a tall, dignified Indian" (3). The editor's footnote claims historical authority on multiple levels: of Apache chiefs over unruly followers, of white historiography over Indian history, and, finally, of newspaper editors over impressionable young readers. The Dublin boys re-fashion themselves as Indians, playing out the same textual and historical subject positions they know from reading the Halfpenny Marvel. "An Encounter" speaks directly to this literary-historical nexus when the narrator sees in himself and his companions a growing tendency towards disorder: "A spirit of unruliness diffused itself among us and, under its influence, differences of culture and consti tution were waived" (D 20). The vocabulary suggests the recurring mobilization-and-resistance pattern played out across the preceding century of Irish republican history, in which "differences of culture and constitution" (in effect, Protestant and Catholic, gentry and peas 225</page><page sequence="8">James Joyce Quarterly 46.2 2009 ant) were set aside for the higher purpose of self-government and national independence.19 Like the modern Irish republican move ment, itself inspired by the American and French revolutions ground ed in Enlightenment philosophy, the boys' reading and emulation of Wild-West stories features a literate diffusion of knowledge that galvanizes collective identity and foments armed insurrection against unjust rule. Vincent Cheng regards the moment as a prime example of the Bakhtinian carnivalesque, an opportunity in the energy of misrule "for people to accept each other as separate and different and free, and not as hierarchically overdetermined" (84). This is a useful way to read the boys' play in "An Encounter," all the more so because such subversive potential is totally absent from the "hierarchically overdetermined" depictions of race in "Cochise The Apache Chief," whose eponymous personage turns out to be little more than a stock character. Such a portrayal is a far cry from the Apache political dissident and military commander who challenged American westward expansionism and Indian resettlement policy in the mid-nineteenth century. The Harmsworth story might pay lip service to the idea of authentic history but only as an effort to appear credible while exerting authority over its readers and subject matter. Ultimately, "Cochise The Apache Chief" is more accurately fore cast by its unwieldy subtitle?"The Perils and Adventures of Dudley Fraser and his Chum in the Wilds of Arizona"?which provides the first hint that the story will have more to do with British fantasies than Apache realities. The protagonist and plotline follow suit. Fraser is an upper-class Englishman who constantly proves himself against the physical hardships and cultural challenges of the American fron tier. Having sold his gold-prospecting claim at Cedarwood Camp, he has decided to try his hand at ranching in Arizona. Alongside what his pal Yankee Nat calls a "U-niv-er-sit-y eddication" (1), Dudley displays his remarkable mastery of virtually every skill necessary for survival in the lawless American West. His refined language and manners constantly outwit or outmatch those of his coarse American inferiors, as do his physical prowess and general toughness. In a series of incredible episodes (usually rooted in equally implausible coincidences), Fraser bests a gang of outlaws, rescues and befriends Cochise, kills an attacking bear, defeats a vengeful vaquero, is taken prisoner and nearly executed by the Apaches, is freed by Cochise, helps Cochise defeat his Apache rivals, strikes gold, and marries his (appropriately English) sweetheart Alice, the sister of his best chum, Phil Stanton. Fraser 's checklist of amazing adventures is parodied through the series of less-than-heroic incidents for Mahony and the narrator in their day's miching. Just as they play Indian warfare at home, they attempt in their trek across Dublin to re-create the substance and style 226</page><page sequence="9">of the adventure story.20 If we consider the boys as re-enactors of the "Apache Chief," many instances in their own narrative suggest the shortcomings that ensue when applying the idealized story to the Dublin setting. In the wilds of Dublin, they confront a string of social threats rather than mortal dangers. The many strange adventures and intercultural episodes of the Herring story are relived in the row with the street children, the experience of "foreign sailors" on the quays and exotic passengers on the Liffey ferry, and, finally, the encounter with the old josser (D 23). Even Fraser's triumph over the deadly bruin is mimicked in Mahony's pursuit of the cat across the field in Ringsend. Yet, in every instance, the boys' experience falls disappointingly short of their reading. Of the ferry ride, for example, the narrator recalls, "We were serious to the point of solemnity, but once during the short voyage our eyes met and we laughed" (D 23). The oxymoron ("short voyage") and shattered mood undercut any hint of the heroism in the "Apache Chief." In contrast with Fraser?the successful imperial adventurer who acquires land, love, and wealth abroad?the boys fall short of any tangible success in their misadventure. They even fail to reach their planned destination of the Pigeon House, their overall failure rooted in the unwarranted attempt to emulate a narrative of imperial heroism in their colonized situation. Refashioned in the paralyzing milieu of Dublin, the heroic feats of the source-story are reduced to miniaturized or metaphorical render ings, as the boys' imaginations fuel a sense of adventurous action that consistently falls short of their reading. The changed setting for adventure distorts another key ingredient of the Halfpenny Marvel tale by substituting mundane urban Ireland for the unpredictable wilder ness of America. For instance, Belvedere College stands in for the law less mining settlement of Cedarwood Camp, as both places attempt to impose civil order on an unruly and uncouth populace. Dublin's "noisy streets flanked by high stone walls" and "groaning carts" (D 23) replace the American West, where Fraser and friends ride their tireless steeds through wide-open country. The "surging stream" in the "Apache Chief" (14), site of a hair-raising canoe chase and Cochise's vengeful killing of Texas Jake, contrasts with the commer cial and unexciting Liffey, which the boy-narrator nevertheless scans for a hint of the exotic. He momentarily thinks he finds it among the sailors on the quays, but this proves illusory: "I came back and exam ined the foreign sailors to see had any of them green eyes for I had some confused notion...." (D 23). Along with the telling ellipsis, the boy-narrator's failure "to decipher the legend" upon the stern of the "graceful threemaster" suggests a breakdown in reading and inter pretation through a palimpsest of cultures (D 23). The boys will face an element of perilous social adventure in the encounter with the old josser, but this presents a different sort of peril than encountered by 227</page><page sequence="10">James Joyce Quarterly 46.2 2009 Fraser and his chum in the wilds of Arizona. With incomplete adventures and mundane settings come imperfect relationships in another meaningful departure from Herring's formu laic fiction. Much of "Cochise The Apache Chief" centers on the male bonding of Fraser with Stanton and, to a lesser degree, with Cochise. There are hostilities and betrayals, to be sure, among Indians and Americans, but these social maladies are nearly always overcome by the unwavering affability and fidelity of the hero, his English chum, and his Apache ally. This is apparent, for instance, when Cochise arrives in the nick of time to spare Fraser from the hanging rope of the Vigilantes from Cedarwood Camp: "'Cochise does not seek the scalps of the white men,' went on the Apache. 'He does not wish for bloodshed. He asks only for the life of the young paleface who befriended him. The young man is honest as he is brave. His face speaks to the redskin in words that are sweet with the truth!'" (5). This ideal portrait of reciprocal friendship is upended by the world of "An Encounter," steeped as it is in competition, derision, and general distrust. First, when Leo Dillon fails to show up at the canal bridge, the fundamental reliability of his friendship is called into question. What was a gang of three becomes two, a reduction that suggests det rimental consequences for the entire adventure: "When we came to the Smoothing Iron we arranged a siege; but it was a failure because you must have at least three" (D 22). This logistical shortcoming is in contrast to the many successful sieges and cooperative ambushes in the "Apache Chief" arranged by Cochise and his loyal following or by the Navajo in their own concerted efforts. Unlike the loyal partners Stanton and Fraser, Mahony and the narrator bond mainly through vicarious revenge on Dillon when they insult his name and envision his corporal punishment at school (D 22). But even this vengeful alliance proves frail, as the narrator's ultimate ambivalence towards Mahony ("for in my heart I had always despised him a little"?D 28) completes the parody of loyal and unconditional friendship. Overall, Joyce's narrative reduces the true-blue social ties of the magazine story to something much more provisional, suspicious, and distrust ful. Along with this travesty of male camaraderie, "An Encounter" derides the ethnic stereotypes that are also a prominent feature of "Cochise The Apache Chief." Every character in Herring's story is easily plotted and predictably identified according to stock traits of racial or national background. At the top of the social hierarchy are the English hero, Fraser, as well as Stanton, and the latter's sister Alice, who is also Fraser 's sweetheart and future bride. With his Oxford diction and unwavering grace under pressure, Fraser is the paragon of Englishness. The initial description of him reassures readers that, despite his dusty dungarees and bronzed complexion, he possesses 228</page><page sequence="11">the best qualities of the home island: "The sun-tan had not in any way taken from the refinement or attraction of his well-chiselled features; he was as much a gentleman in his rough miner's costume as he would have been in fashionable English attire" (1). As a foil to such English perfection, "Cochise The Apache Chief" constructs a social order that descends from American roughneck to Mexican bandit, then on to Indians who are depicted as either utterly noble or inherently hostile. Among the Americans are the outlaw gang of Texas Jake and the Club of Ten; Jake's crew is pursued by the venge ful band of Vigilantes, whose frontier justice hands all cases over to a hanging-rope lawman named Judge Lynch. The coarseness of these Americans is slightly offset by Yankee Nat, a good-hearted (if simple minded) sidekick from the woods of Maine. But even more ruthless than any American settler is a disgruntled vaquero named Manco the Mexican, whose "dark, sinister face," "constitutional idleness," and literal backstabbing express prevalent Anglo-American perceptions of Mexicans (6). In the social world of the "Apache Chief," the darker the character, the less reason there is to trust him. Within its ethnic stereotypes, Herring's tale inscribes the familiar and reductive binary of good and bad Indians. This racial over simplification commences from the first glimpse of Cochise under ambush by three renegade Apaches, a number that corroborates the narrator's sense in "An Encounter" of the requisite number for a siege. The scene portrays Indians, by reputation, as menacing and sneaky: "Dudley had oftentimes been warned of the treachery of the Indians, especially of the Apache tribe, to which this redskin seemed to belong, and he fondled his rifle as the brave approached, deter mined to dodge and take a snapshot if the man attempted to throw his hatchet, which he knew was a favourite mode of attack amongst these savages of the plains" (3). Even after Fraser saves Cochise, the character and motives of the Apache remain in question, as shown in the metaphoric interaction of Cochise's calumet with Dudley's tobacco: "The voracious Indian pipe would have swallowed more of the unobtainable weed, but Dudley snatched the pouch away, in dread of being left tobaccoless on the plains" (3). In a reversal of his tory, the narrative assumes the white man to be at grave risk of being dispossessed and victimized by Native-American rapacity. Only gradually does the story establish Cochise as an ally and leader to be trusted rather than a "redskin" to be feared, but he ranks as the exception among a people otherwise assumed to be savage, deceitful, short-tempered, and unreasonable.21 Almost as a rule in the story, English civility overcomes Indian wildness to preserve the faint trace of civilization it has brought to the Wild West. This is exemplified in the narrative editorializing that follows the lifting of a Navajo siege at the Stanton homestead: "Baffled and beaten, the redskins are disorga 229</page><page sequence="12">James Joyce Quarterly 46.2 2009 nized and in full flight. Hurrah boys! Stanton's ranche [sic] is saved. The red scum of the plains have fallen back, shattered and whipped, before the bold dash of a little handful of men with an English leader at their head!" (7). History, according to the Harmsworth stories, would have us believe the Navajo are simply ruthless attackers, unprovoked by any past wrongs such as Anglo-American invasion or territorial dispossession. "An Encounter" mimics the racial hierarchy of Herring's story in terms that speak to the ethno-sectarian divisions of nineteenth century Dublin. When Mahony and the narrator encounter a group of children at the start of their journey, Mahony "play[s] the Indian" by thrusting his empty catapult toward a crowd of children; the "ragged troop" fires back with stones and ethnic slurs (D 22). Their shouted insult ("SwaddlersV?D 22) misidentifies the narrator and Mahony along ethno-religious lines, but the narrator's own false assumption furthers the misunderstanding: he assumes the hostile children see them as Protestant "because Mahony, who was dark-complexioned, wore the silver badge of a cricket club in his cap" (D 22). The frivolous description of Mahony's countenance suggests that the narrator, too, has learned somewhere to read ethnic markers and cultural signi fies in such minutiae as cricket caps. Like the green eyes he searches for among the foreign sailors, it seems he again has "some confused notion"?in this case, that religion somehow correlates with race. In his association of the two, the narrator perpetuates the contemporary racialist binaries of Protestant/Catholic and Anglo/Celt.22 Crossing in the Liffey ferryboat with "two labourers and a little Jew with a bag" (D 23), the boy further reveals himself as prone to making ethnic and class distinctions, even if he is not entirely sure what to do with the information. Reluctant Indians This apparent need of the narrator to locate individuals within racial categories is, in large part, a sign of the times. During the last half of the nineteenth century, in the context of emerging evolu tionary theories, it became increasingly important for many in the European scientific community to develop a more precise taxonomy of race. Louis Snyder has described the physical traits enumerated by Victorian scientists who sought to define a Celtic race (62). For exam ple, he cites the work of French surgeon and cerebrologist Pierre Paul Broca who, "using his own anthropomorphic techniques" during the 1860s, concluded that the dominant physical traits of Breton peasants were "short and brunette" (62). Snyder continues, saying that British scientists were not far behind: "In 1865, Davis and Thurman found that a large part of the Celtic-speaking population of the British Isles, 230</page><page sequence="13">particularly the Welsh, were also short and dark-complexioned" (62, my italics). Meanwhile, apologists for British expansionism had long sought to align the Celt, especially the so-called wild Irish, with the darker-skinned (and presumably inferior) races of Africa and the Americas. Luke Gibbons discusses how Elizabethan writers deployed the Irish-Indian parallel as justification for policies of territorial acqui sition and racial subjugation.23 For many, it was Britain's manifest destiny and paternalistic duty to establish dominion over these west ern territories and their childlike inhabitants. Science, historiography, and other cultural fields as diverse as literature, art, music, and jour nalism maintained this racialist view well into the twentieth century. Thus, with his focus on Mahony's dark complexion, the boy narrator appears to co-opt a discourse of racial and physiognomic taxonomy that had become a preoccupation of nineteenth-century scientific and popular culture. When Mahony decides to "play the Indian," his action not only repeats the back-garden Indian battles in which the boys regularly engage but also plays into the role defined for all Irish as both literal and metaphorical children. That the boys consistently assume the Indian rather than the Anglo-American cowboy roles the Harmsworth stories offer them suggests an affili ation of Indian and Irish posited by contemporary ethnography and reinforced by popular media. As Cullingford suggests, "[i]maginative connections between oppressed groups demonstrate that the postco lonial condition is widely shared, destabilize essentialist conceptions of national identity, and increase the potential complexity of literary metaphors."24 This most certainly seems to be the case with Joyce's reworking of the familiar ethnic parallel, one that originated in the discourse of the colonizer. The question remains whether the adoles cent Irish readers' adoption of Indian identity represents a conscious decision to become Indians or a deliberate choice not to be English. If the former, they appear to assume the role of childish savages long ascribed to them by colonialist texts; if the latter, they are staging a cultural rebellion through this literary re-creation/recreation. To address this question, it is useful to note that "Cochise The Apache Chief," like many of the Harmsworth western stories, is predicated on the opposition of Indian to white man.25 After the ini tial description of Cochise, the word "redskin" resounds many times throughout the story, as does the oppositional term, "paleface," the appellation by which Cochise and his fellow Apaches refer to Fraser, Stanton, and other white settlers. The complex history of ethnic divi sion and geographic control in the American West emerges from the redskin-paleface conjunction. In addition, the second half of the equa tion corresponds etymologically to another historical partition, that of the Anglo-Irish, since the long history of the word "pale" interweaves significations of human facial-racial description with a territorial 231</page><page sequence="14">James Joyce Quarterly 46.2 2009 enclosure (as in "beyond the pale"). "An Encounter" invokes this ethnic-imperial vocabulary when the boy-narrator explains how, for him, Father Butler's reprimand of Leo Dillon "paled much of the glory of the Wild West" (D 20, my italics). Besides suggesting the teacher's authority, the transitive verb offers a subtle hint of racialist thinking even before direct mention of Mahony's darker skin tone; at the same time, "paled" conveys the additional sense of territorial expansion and enclosure, whether in the American West or West Britain. By extension, the wordplay implies a certain interchangeability between the school-church authority of the priest and the ethnic-imperial dominance of the Harmsworth papers?a connection reinforced by Father Butler's comment that the Halfpenny Marvel is "such stuff" he would expect to find being read by National School boys, and not by the "educated" and elite Belvedere students (D 20). If the remark is intended to malign the National Schools as mere tools of Anglicization, it nevertheless snobbishly legitimates class bias in Irish education, ironically perpetuating the same prejudice and division as British rule. Father Butler's curriculum is no less hypocritical than his pedago gy, for assigning Julius Gaius Caesar's Commentarli de Bello Gallico?a veritable handbook of cultural conquest and empire-building?is, for all intents and purposes, not so different from teaching the "Apache Chief." Whether the boys read about Roman legions in Gaul or Fraser in Arizona, they will encounter the same fundamental themes of cultural conquest and imperial dominion, justified by an ideology of cultural invasion and racial superiority In his account of the Gaulic campaign, Caesar commences with a geographic description rooted in ethnic distinctions: "All Gaul is divided into three parts, one of which the Belgae inhabit, the Aquitani another, those who in their own language are called Celts, in ours Gauls, the third. All these dif fer from each other in language, customs and laws."26 By alluding to Caesar's Commentaries, Joyce underscores the link between racialism and imperial subjugation, starting with Roman expansionism and domination of the Celts, the distant ancestors of his Dubliners. The ironic implication is that the kernel of Father Butler's lesson might be as easily gleaned from forbidden magazines as from sanctioned schoolbooks. This parallel is further underscored by Father Butler's seemingly confused repetition of pronouns as he interrogates Leo Dillon: "This page or this page? This page? Now Dillon, up!" (D 20). For a moment, it is uncertain which page Butler means, as competing texts become conflated through a telling grammatical elision of the "Apache Chief" and Caesar's Commentaries.27 In effect, there are no "doors of escape" (D 20) or ideological alternatives to either one of these indoctrinating inter-texts. Such an entrapped position for juvenile readers and colonial sub 232</page><page sequence="15">jects might finally be described according to Althusser's "duplicate mirror-structure" theory of ideology (181). "An Encounter" shows this two-way function of ideology at work in its juvenile readers' reception of the "Apache Chief" and similar Wild-West tales. In their reading and ritual re-enactment, the boys anticipate the interpellated subjects and, to varying degrees, indoctrinated individuals described by Althusser. As disseminator of the Halfpenny Marvel and its ideol ogy, Joe Dillon represents a fully-interpellated subject who fulfills two of Althusser 's mirror-structure criteria: "the mutual recognition of subjects and Subject" and "the subjects' recognition of each other" (181).28 This no doubt helps prepare him for his career as priest, another role in which he will serve as a mouthpiece for the ideologi cal state apparatus. By contrast, the boy-narrator displays an aware ness of the political influences at work and a desire to evade them. Several times, he senses the power of ideology and contemplates escape, as when he perceives the conflict between the Harmsworth papers and school: "But when the restraining influence of the school was at a distance I began to hunger again for wild sensations, for the escape which those chronicles of disorder alone seemed to offer me" (D 20-21). The thought arises that the halfpenny papers are not what they seem: despite the "doors of escape" they appear to contain, they are as coercive and limiting as school. As Kershner notes, these "chronicles of disorder" end by exerting a rigidly structured hege mony of their own (Joyce 36-38). Later, as the narrator approaches the Liffey, he shows even greater awareness of himself and Mahony as being subjects of and subject to these ideologies: "School and home seemed to recede from us and their influences upon us seemed to wane" (D 23).29 Nevertheless, this insight is tempered by the repeti tion of the uncertain verb "seemed," which casts doubt on to whether the ideological influences are, in fact, lessening their grip. For one coming of age in late nineteenth-century Ireland, can geographic dis tance or physical departure ever provide a conclusive escape from the strictures of British imperialism? The possible answer to the question?and a key indicator of the boy-narrator's awareness of ideology?comes in his ability to see or imagine his own experience in the terms of the Wild-West genre. This begins with his identification of himself early in the story as one of the "reluctant Indians" (D 20) and continues in his frustration with Wild-West reading and re-creation, an ideology he finally recognizes as being just as limiting as that of school or home. The knowledge that the stories only "seemed to offer" escape already suggests a growing gap between subject and Subject in the ideological mirror-connection (D 21). This widening fissure leads to a sense of tedium and declining interest: "The mimic warfare of the evening became at last as weari some to me as the routine of school in the morning because I wanted 233</page><page sequence="16">James Joyce Quarterly 46.2 2009 real adventures to happen to myself" (D 21). From this point, the parody of the "Apache Chief" takes off, reset in the circumstances and characters of Dublin. From an initial awareness of himself as an unwilling actor, the narrator develops a nascent resistance writing that threatens to shatter imperial ideology's double-mirror by paro dying its form and thereby undermining its core assumptions and values. The real adventure and ultimate escape reside not in being a consumer of the Harmsworth boys' papers, but in becoming the subject who learns to revise their terms. Thus, when they "play the Indian," the narrator and his compan ions are symbolically at odds with the pale face of the imperial state apparatus. By playing out this opposition, they fall right in line with the ethnic-imperial ideology that functions through the popular press and the school curriculum. This is the true achievement and ideological effect of the British media on the developing Irish mind, according to Althusser: they direct their readers to believe in and rel ish their identity as wild Indians, presumably free and unencumbered individuals, who seem by their own volition to accept the "guarantee that everything really is so" (180). Joe Dillon accepts this guarantee twice over, first as the leader of the gang and later as a member of the clergy; in both instances, he plays the roles literally scripted for the colonial periphery by the imperial center. Dillon and crew have neither the recourse nor ability to invent their own communal or national narrative. Only the narrator, alone in his gathering dislike for the game and heightened understanding of the stories as ideology, suggests the potential to declare independence and break away. The ideological function of the Halfpenny Marvel, therefore, becomes marvelously complicated when recontextualized by Joyce's own account of boys reading the Harmsworth halfpenny papers in England's closest colony. "Cochise The Apache Chief" and scores of Marvel stories like it transmitted their message of ethnic inferior ity and imperial subjugation to generations of young Irish readers, providing them with narratives that sought to justify British imperial and racial superiority over inferior native populations. By a mere allusion to the boys' weeklies, and the "Apache Chief" in particular, "An Encounter" shows Joyce countering and complicating such ideo logical fictions. The parallel of frontier America with urban Ireland juxtaposes American Indian and colonized Irish, Manifest Destiny and British expansionism, initiating a broader discourse of read ing in which every text becomes a contested site. In consuming the Harmsworth Wild-West stories and reenacting their Indian warfare, the boys appear to assume prescribed roles as a factionalized and unruly ethnic minority, helpless without the colonizer's quieting, paternalistic influence. On the other hand, the narrator's growing awareness of his subject 234</page><page sequence="17">position and ability to revise the very discourse that would otherwise dominate him suggests that "doors of escape" from ideologies of cultural conquest and racial subjugation do in fact exist. Whether the narrator or, for that matter, Ireland's upcoming generation, will, in fact, pass through those doors is another question, to which the rest of the story, even the rest of Dubliners, yields no easy answer. Nor should it. For any simple resolution would belie the true complexity of the problem framed by "An Encounter": that even those innocent pastimes of boys' reading and imaginative play are not immune to a hegemonic political influence. What remains clear, however, is that the actual, interrupted excur sion of the day's miching?like Gabriel Conroy's imagined westward journey in "The Dead"?marks a fresh cognitive starting point and awakening perspective for the colonized subject. Cullingford calls "An Encounter" a "depressing story" in which "Joyce presents the idea of escape as a delusion" (Others 175). Yet, to label the story as bleak or depressing ignores the fact that, even through his thwarted adventure, the narrator succeeds in altering the familiar, colonizing narrative of the Harmsworth Wild-West story-papers. In this way, his role foretells Joyce's own literary project as anti-narrative coun terpoint to British literature, a thesis advanced by Andrew Gibson in Joyce's Revenge. Gibson remarks of the mimicking discursive styles in Ulysses, "They are wicked practices upon the colonizer's culture," but a reading of them as such "will work only if made so subtle as to seem self-contradictory" (15). Like Joyce himself, the young narrator in "An Encounter" evinces an ability to take the language and imagi native material of the colonizer and refashion them into something new. This practice can appear at times illusory or even self-defeating, but "An Encounter" ultimately turns its halfpenny source-text back upon itself, parodying the literary elements and ideological assump tions behind the Wild-West tale. In doing so, Joyce's story effectively critiques and quietly subverts the potency of the Harmsworth boys' story-papers as ethnic-imperial propaganda. NOTES 1 Chester Anderson, in "Should Boys Have Sweethearts?" James Joyce and Popular Culture, ed. Brandon Kershner (Gainesville: Univ. Press of Florida, 1996), p. 50, recounts his research into a number of Victorian boys' papers as pre-texts for "An Encounter," including many numbers of Pluck and the Union Jack, "though only one of The Halfpenny Marvel, and that not the one that includes The Apache Chief/" Anderson's essay highlights links between Joyce's fiction and the 1900 inaugural issue of the periodical The Boys Own Empire.

He later penned sev eral detective stories in the popular Sexton Blake series for the Harmsworth papers, including "The Parachute King," The Union Jack, 1.336 (29 September 1900), 1-16, "The Clue of the Freckled Hand," The Union Jack, 1.420 (5 October 1902), 1-16, and "On Special Service," The Union Jack, 1.13 (11 August 1906), 1-16.

Also see JJl 47-48. Such precise simultaneity of fiction with fact antici pates the sort of historical and biographical parallelism prevalent throughout the remainder of Dubliners, A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man, and Ulysses. It is akin to the often-cited example of Joyce consulting the Thorn's Official Directory to ensure that Leopold and Molly Bloom could inhabit a vacant 7 Eccles Street in June 1904?on this, see Ian Gunn and Clive Hart, James Joyce's Dublin: A Topographical Guide to the Dublin of "Ulysses" (New York: Thames and Hudson, 2004), p. 16. 19 The 1798 United Irishmen rising, led by Wolfe Tone and Napper Tandy, was known for its emphasis on a nonsectarian approach. 20 Kershner sees Mahony and the narrator as each enacting a different literary plot?the Wild-West tale for Mahony, the sea story for the narrator? but both fictional formulas ultimately fall short due to the rigid, hierarchical structure they present, rather than the "chronicles of disorder" the boys pre fer (Joyce 36-37). 21 Ron Marken, in "There is Nothing but White Between the Lines': Parallel Colonial Experiences of the Irish and Aboriginal Canadians," Native North America: Critical and Cultural Perspectives, ed. Ren?e Hu?an (Toronto: ECW Press, 1999), p. 168, considers this simplified duality in the more recent phenomenon of the Hollywood Indian: "The redskins are evil; the palefaces are good. Occasionally, the stereotype flips to the other extreme of romantic sentimentalism." The Halfpenny Marvel story perpetuates the same predeter mined and dehumanizing stereotypes well before Hollywood filmmakers appropriate it for their own purposes. The European "Enlightenment" con cept of the sauvage noble is among the original antecedents of such thinking. 22 Matthew Arnold represents such contemporary racialist assumptions in his essay "On the Study of Celtic Literature," "On the Study of Celtic Literature" and "On Translating Homer" (New York: Macmillan Publishers, 1899), and in Irish Essays (Ann Arbor: Univ. of Michigan Press, 1973). For example, in one of the Irish Essays, "The Incompatibles," he associates the English with such ingrained racial traits as "energy, firmness, industry," while connecting the Irish with the opposite qualities of "laxity and slovenliness" (pp. 322, 314). John Robertson features a chapter on "The Question of Race" in The Saxon 237</page><page sequence="20">James Joyce Quarterly 46.2 2009 and the Celt: A Study in Sociology (London: Univ. Press, 1897), pp. 1-124. Louis Snyder's chapter 6 "The Alleged Celtic Race," in The Idea of Racialism (New York: Van Nostrand Reinhold, 1962), provides a broad summary of how race theory was used to define Celtic culture. See Sinead Garrigan Mattar's Primitivism, Science, and the Irish Revival (New York: Oxford Univ. Press, 2004), for a more recent discussion of the politics of race and Irish literary studies in the nineteenth century, including Arnold's writing. Further references to the Snyder chapter will be cited parenthetically in the text. 23 Luke Gibbons, in "Race Against Time: Racial Discourse and Irish History," Oxford Literary Review, 13 (1991), 97, writes: "Far more important for understanding the distinctive character of Irish stereotypes was the anal ogy with the native Americans, or American Indians, an analogy, moreover, which had a foundation in the shared historical experience of being at the receiving end of the first systematic wave of colonial expansion." Gibbons notes how the Elizabethan conquest of Ireland became a template for North American conquest, including similar strategies for dispossession, assimila tion, or annihilation of native populations. 24 Cullingford, "Phoenician Genealogies and Oriental Geographies: Joyce, Language and Race," Semicolonia! Joyce (p. 220). 25 "The Golden Secret," also by Herring and featured in the Halfpenny Marvel, 4 (13 May 1896), 1-11, relates a similar instance of racial cross-dressing in the story of Arthur Stanton and Dick Trevor, two Oxonians forced to disguise themselves as "Kiowah [sic]" Indians. The narrator notes, "It was a strange scene in which the two Englishmen found themselves unwilling actors" (p. 2). 26 Julius Gaius Caesar, Commentaries on the Gallic War, trans. W. A. McDevitte and W. S. Bohn (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1869), p. 1. Caesar's tripartite division of Gaul resonates also with the persistent patterns of three found in "An Encounter" and Dubliners overall. Snyder notes that this same liter ary moment perhaps marks the origin of thinking about the Celtic people in racial terms: "Though Caesar was not thinking of races, his statement was interpreted to mean that the Celts, or Gauls, were a distinct race" (p. 62). 27 In A Portrait, Caesar's imperial-military account is satirically softened by a Clongowes student in the graffito "Julius Cdesar wrote The Calico Belly" (P43). 28 Cullingford likens Joe Dillon to the real-life Apache chief, Geronimo, on the grounds that both lives arrive at dead-end situations, Geronimo being "confined to a reservation" and Dillon "doomed to enter the reservation of the priesthood" (Others 175). This parallel is more workable, however, in the present social climate, especially following the 1994 case of Father Brendan Smyth and the ensuing clerical sex-abuse scandals in Ireland that Cullingford mentions in her chapter on Seamus Heaney and Sinead O'Connor (Others 250). It is important to bear in mind that in 1890s Ireland the priesthood was hardly a "doomed" status but an esteemed vocation held in high social regard by middle-class families like the Dillons. 29 The boy's intuition suggests Althusser 's own placement of school and family within the societal superstructure. He writes that "the School (and the School-Family couple) constitutes [sic] the dominant Ideological State apparatus" (p. 157). 238</page></plain_text>
