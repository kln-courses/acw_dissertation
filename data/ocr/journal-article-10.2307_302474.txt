<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Loss of the Bride in Heads of the Town and the Reclamation of the Text John Granger In the Vancouver Lectures, Jack Spicer states an analogy that sets the three books of Heads of the Town up to the Aether1 beside the three cantica of Dante's Divine Comedy. As the earlier imagery is returned and recast, the spiritual conditions of hell, purgatory, and heaven become conditions of language: the poetic, to name them, and to move backwards already, in "A Textbook of Poetry," the prosaic in "A Fake Novel about the Life of Arthur Rimbaud," and in "Homage to Creeley," the condition of language itself. Because these conditions of language have marked the contemporary condition of self, what structure we are given in Heads of the Town is best held in a relationship of the speaking voice to the spoken poem and of both to the unspoken and unspeakable that complete them. If we have become distant from the old vocabulary of God and Hell and Paradise it has been to return to the sentences in which they appeared (Paz: "language now occupies the place once occupied by the gods"2). And it has been to return to the subject that placed itself as an "I" within them. In "Homage to Creeley," the subject is banished from the sentences it speaks. Our own matched displacement is what makes all of us 145</page><page sequence="2">"partners of hell" (HC, 139) attempting the reconstitution of the "I" in an area to be opened above us. The serial poem that begins here will get that far, but at this point, in this first book, the subject is triply erased by past tense ("two loves I had"), negation ("what I knew wasn't true"), and guesswork ("what is, I guess, is big"). But this is a poetry of dictation and even an asserted "I" would not have held the speaking voice within a definition. As the false content of the "1" is erased, we, the readers, who would have joined the poet in his spoken self, are erased as well. Had the poet claimed some space, and had he spoken there with authority, we could have filled it with our presence too. Ironically, that space now denied us, presence is all we have in "Homage to Creeley." Spicer writes: "The poem does not know/ Who you refers to" (HC, 123). The poem doesn't know because we (the "you" the poem speaks to) refer to nothing. Where we are given over to Spicer's text, we can attach ourselves to no exterior meaning; we are "stripped of all meaning except presence" (Mallarm,).3 "In Rimbaud and Mallarm6," says Paz, "language turns back upon itself, it ceases to designate, it is neither a symbol of, nor does it refer to, external realities."4 Turned back upon ourselves, held from reference and relation, we are moved into the purity of our own presence, into what Mallarm6 calls "a narcotic calm of pure self."5 But that presence is not yet the text's articulation except where caricature or an occasional image of the dead has spoken it. Like Prospero's best strength, what meaning we have is our own, and like the magic Prospero worked over others, a shared meaning is no longer possible in an imaginative order that bars us from the habitual throne. In "Several Years' Love" (HC, 118), a letter written to the poet receives this explanatory note: "The letter, naturally (as will become apparent in the conquest of Algeria or outer space) was written to somebody else." The dictated poems are not for us, not even for the poet.6 We are not their subject, nor are we the subject of what we name. This will become more apparent in the conquest of Algeria or outer space because it will appear in a language that is no longer centered around us, around the location, the "here," that we have claimed as our own. The emptying of subject and self in "Homage to Creeley" has reopened them both. That self that had been filled by an exclusive content, and had silenced what moved outside its perimeter, is itself silenced now. As it is turned toward its own silence, the speaking voice is joined to the unspoken it had thought to abolish. In Spicer's Pentheus and the Dancers (a close translation of Euripides' Bacchae), Thebes is called the city "of the unlocked gates"; but because those gates are open, a deified disorder (Dionysus) is given entrance, and the king, Pentheus, is killed. As the barriers of a definition fall in "Homage to Creeley," a commotion enters and like Spicer's Dionysus, extends the dimensions of the subject beyond the possibility of kingship. In a similar sense, Spicer's "Surrealism" begins: 146</page><page sequence="3">Whatever belongs in the circle is in the circle They Raise hands. Death-defying trapeze artists on one zodiac, the Queen of Spades, the Ace of Hearts, the nine of Diamonds, the whole deck of cards (HC, 141) The glamour of three chosen cards gives way to an appearance of the whole deck. The deck, overturned and spread before us, speaks the totality the subject had excluded. "Homage to Creeley" argues a whole deck of cards, a totality, against the familiar deception of a poker hand. To lapse from the sobriety of metaphor, the full house of the closed self has become suddenly empty, and to paraphrase Mallarm6 badly: a selectivity that locates a meaning in us will never abolish those components of mind or heart or world that we do not determine.7 Whatever belongs in the circle is in the circle. The surreal enters and alters the real. A deck appears where three cards would have imaged us. We are posed as precariously and as laughably as trapeze artists in the opened and inclusive order of a thought that neither begins nor ends in us. As we "raise hands," and with the bravura of circus acts, fall from the platform of an old belief, our agility surprises us (we are, says Olson, spiritual exercise by having been born). And we are "death-defying" twice: by the risk of our venture upon the subjectless ground, and by the welcome with which we receive the death of our own inadequate image, returned to us in Cocteau's mirror. In a sense which begins here I have called "Homage to Creeley" a voice returned to the condition of language itself. By "language" I mean what Saussure meant by langue: a language-system; English, for example, or French. Saussure names three areas of linguistic activity: langage (our linguistic capacity), langue (language itself) and parole (individual ut- terance). The denial of the subject in "Homage to Creeley" is a denial of any utterance we can call our own. The absence of parole leaves us with a language that speaks without our voice, that speaks, in this sense, "by itself" (Blaser). In the "Fake Novel," Spicer writes: The marshmallows on the banks of the mag- nificent river draw away. Who is there to hear even his song. The coaches draw away. There is left a universe of letters and numbers and what I have told you. For Jim. (FN, 159) As the coaches withdraw, as the subject removes itself from its enthronement in the sentence, an illumination falls upon the letters and numbers that compose a language we do not speak. The components of the unuttered language spread themselves across a space ("a universe") we 147</page><page sequence="4">were supposed to have filled with a God. The privilege of a meaning, even if that meaning was only a presence, passes from the poet, and then from us ("who is there to hear even his song?"). In the first poem of the "Textbook of Poetry," the public will be formally damned, and the poet will be lost in a crowd of images, metaphors, words: To be lost in a crowd. Of images, of metaphors (whatever they were), of words; this is a better surrender. Of the poet who is lost in the crowd of them. Finally. The better and final surrender of self has stated a vacancy and then stated a world where the self had been talking. If we imagine a car and then call ourselves drivers, we have held ourselves from this surrender that allows poetry and paradise their chimerical presences. In "Dash" (HC, 146), those that ride serious cars are damned, just as the public, who re- semble them, will be damned at precisely the point a paradise proposes itself in a language transfigured by "the first appearance of the Logos" (TP, 169). "Everything is in the street," writes Spicer, "Then they meet/ It with their automobiles." The road which "they" (the riders of cars that "aren't funny") ride over has opened into a field of "everything"; or, absurdly, "everything" has collected within the artifice of a single street. But where we have constructed a meaning that remains within our dimension, within, say, the space of one street, everything does collect and obstruct that fake passage from self into world. The articulation of self into world, which is mirrored by an articulation of subject into sentence, never did allow the separation of terms. The "I," says Rimbaud, is an other ("Je est un autre");8 its exclusive forms are false. "Dash" takes this explanatory note: Cegeste comes back to a big meeting with his personal fate. He lacks knowledge of the driver's seat as did Cegeste, Creeley, and all of us. He intends to spend his fortune in banks, on the banks of some rivers. He will wreck their cars if he can have to. He. The driver's seat, filled first by the subject, and then filled by God, is emptied of both as a long-assumed knowledge begins to disappear. If all of us had knowledge of the driver's seat, we could have supposed an "I" and met there in a shared meaning. But the "I," placed in hell, has been coupled with an absence of meaning, with the silence at each side of its spoken name, with an unthought and an unknown which it had confronted by claiming a definition. Accordingly, what drivers there are in "Homage to Creeley" are "madmen who drive cars into the distances of dying" (HC, 137) or the dying and dead themselves. The fate of the ride is inevitably dismal ("The whole bus crashed with all the bus team" [HC, 148</page><page sequence="5">143] ), but as trucks and trains fall over cliffs and into lakes they are at least off a road that always ends up in us. And if "violations are rare" (HC, 133) it's through no lack of deviance but because of an absence of law throughout. Even the criminal ("Dillinger") appears, but then Yeats talks of the "crime-haunted threshold of sanctity,"9 and because we are moving toward paradise we can call this that edge. "To Be Inscribed on a Painting" (HC, 126) begins by bridging two imageries: The fate of the car And the fate of the ride Is only a bridegroom Without a bride In "Homage to Creeley," the bridegroom without a bride is mostly Orpheus without Eurydice, but he is, of course, Dante without Beatrice as well. The bride is the bridegroom's completion, the image that holds his desire. Her absence is the fate of the subject which the world does not predicate. The absence of the beloved becomes the absence of the subject who that beloved, if present, would have completed. The "1," in turn, is no longer possible because its desire has become imageless. The image of the beloved that would predicate that desire is placed, like Eurydice, "miles away" (HC, 128). But the space that the absent Eurydice has left, or the space in which she appears headless (HC, 127) to speak the unthought condition of the imageless, is the "place to step further" (TP, 182) that gives us metaphor, poetry, and a returned image of the beautiful. The promise of "A Textbook of Poetry" is that vast: "To create the beautiful again. It is as if somehow the lovers of postage stamps had created an image of themselves" (TP, 180). If the beautiful is returned to us in the space I am calling the lost Eurydice, we are returned to our own image, to an "I" that is mirrored in the image of its desire. Just as Thebes embraces the intelligence of Dionysus, we embrace the estranged ("the stranger") at the gates of our love (HC, 129, 138) and kill a king to reclaim our desire. In "The Territory Is Not the Map" (HC, 122) we are given "Orpheus and Eurydice . . in their last nuptial embrace." They embrace in an obsolete meeting of territory and map that the poem's title names and negates. Formal meanings (maps) tend to report an experience of the world that excludes the meaningless, or that remains outside the unsaid and unknown. In "Homage to Creeley," the nonsensical and meaningless are intelligences that disturb those orders that exclude them. "Wrong Turn" begins: "What I knew/ Wasn't true" (HC, 121). The exclusive orders that guaranteed our speech are false and behind us. The voice that speaks the explanatory notes says, "one throws away crutches" (HC, 117), and then knocks them out from under us by pointing out an absence of 149</page><page sequence="6">meaning in every poem. But those absences and silences are our semantic inheritance and the occasion of our estrangement. They are as much the territory we mean to map as the hills and lakes that mask them. The discrepancy between territory and map, like the distance between Orpheus and Eurydice, and like the post-Babelic split between sign and signified, has left us mapless. Like the Snark-hunters in Lewis Carroll's poem, our map is superbly blank, and like them too, when we meet what we hunt with no map at all we have "softly and suddenly vanished away."10 The vanishing of both subject and reader in "Homage to Creeley" is mirrored in the vanished God that we call hell. Where we have found hell (and our companions in the book - Persephone, the cast of Cocteau's Orphee - have placed us there), God's absence has itself become a presence. In Fifteen False Propositions Against God, his absence becomes "real" and his presence uninviting (FFP, 88). That book calls God a diamond ring and then watches the ring turn brass. Spicer says or sings: "If the diamond ring turns brass/ Mama's going to buy you a looking glass" (FFP, 93). If the alchemy that had lifted our image as high as God is reversed, and if God, in the process, is killed, our own unaltered reflection ("a looking glass") appears where God had been. In "Homage to Creeley," the looking glass is largely Cocteau's, and our own image, appearing there, is the image of death. There is, though, one mirror that is strictly Spicer's: "Imagining, at times, a mirror two sides of which are a mirror" (HC, 143). A two-sided mirror speaks the twin damnations of reflected presence. The reflected self may be caught within the lineaments of its image and then closed before the infinitude of its desire. And the unknown, the darkened area behind the mirror that has reflected us, may have been reflected back into itself and become, at last, unknowable. But in "Homage to Creeley" we are moving through an image of Dante's exile, and the unfolded darkness is informed by a possibility of return. Although the city and the City of God are as far away from Spicer as Dante was from Florence (TP, 176), the "Textbook of Poetry" will "in an utterly mixed and mirrored way" create again the city's image. Orpheus appears only once in the "Textbook" paradise, but his single appearance joins heaven to hell in a rare reciprocity of intelligence that allows the city its image. And so Dante appears only once in hell: Sheep Trails Are Fateful to Strangers Dante would have blamed Beatrice If she turned up alive in a local bordello Or Newton gravity If apples fell upward What I mean is words Turn mysteriously against those who use them 150</page><page sequence="7">Hello says the apple Both of us were object. There is a universal here that is dimly recognized. I mean everybody says some kinds of love are horseshit. Or invents a Beatrice to prove that they are. What Beatrice did did not become her own business. Dante saw to that. Sawed away the last plank anyone he loved could stand on. The dimly recognized universal is that words turn mysteriously against those who use them, that they turn against us, that our language isn't really ours, that we don't own what we name. The "Fake Novel" says "what the words choose to say" (FN, 166). On the other side of another mirror, Humpty Dumpty argues against that: "When / use a word," Humpty Dumpty said, "it means just what I choose it to mean - neither more nor less." "The question is," said Alice, "whether you can make words mean so many different things." "The question is," said Humpty Dumpty, "which is to be master - that's all."'11 But Alice, like us, and like Dante and Newton, can't call herself master, even if Humpty Dumpty does. We are "condemned to meaning" (Merleau-Ponty) just where Humpty Dumpty is given over to nonsense, where words, turned back upon themselves, no longer need to be meaningful, where the world, like the dark side of the moon, is meaningless, and just an image of its own desire to get beyond itself.1 2 When Dante names Beatrice he is really naming a complex of light and love, but at that extremity of language that places the eye of Horus beside the testicles of Seth, his name turns against him. Light turns up in the sexual; Beatrice appears in a local bordello. The silence that precedes and follows the spoken name "Beatrice" returns us to the radiance of desire that Beatrice, in the long spoken name of the Comedy, had masked. Like everyone else, Beatrice was in a bordello all along; but shining there, like God, she obliterated the particulars of that scene. Beatrice's death and transcendence did not become her business; they became, instead, Dante's. As Beatrice is moved into transcendence, it doesn't matter that she ascends or descends, and anyway gravity is upside 151</page><page sequence="8">down here. Like the apples, she falls upwards or outwards, but either way she is denied some principle of horizon, some plank, and is lifted above or has fallen from the erotic, for example, or her life. Like this poem's apple, the Orphic horse in Cocteau's play says "hello" to Orpheus, but spelling it with its hoof, spells "hell" and then pauses to mark the condition of the poet. The last letter - the "o" - placed first, becomes, in Cocteau's play, the initials of a new sentence "from the other side of death": Orpheus Hunts Eurydice's Lost Life.13 Dante and Beatrice are ghost and double to Orpheus and Eurydice, but while Orpheus hunts the lost content of his word (Eurydice) in hell, Dante erases his in heaven, or fills it with a light that negates its companion darkness. And if Spicer has taken a laughable and idiotic step through the complex order of Dante's light, it could be that laughter and idiocy are first forms of an intelligence that does not celebrate us. Our language is not our own, our lives are not our own. What we do does not become our own business. Rimbaud's biography is a fake novel because it isn't his, because he is not the subject of his own life. The disappearance of the subject, the appearance, as much as it does appear, of the subjectless ground, makes both of us, both poet and reader, object. The absence of the subject is an argument against anthropomorphism, against our speaking, against us. Who are you? the "Fake Novel" asks (FN 160), and we answer asking the question again in a tautology Paz says we killed God to escape.14 The absence of the subject is both determined by and determining of an absence of the subject's completion, the object. Anthony Wilden says of Jacques Lacan: "The discovery of the lack of the object is for Lacan the condition and cause of desire, the adult quest for transcendence, lost time, lost paradises, lost plenitude."115 Lost paradises, lost plenitudes inhabit any of Spicer's books. An orderly syntax is in every book broken. God is absent from the fifteen false propositions against Him; in The Holy Grail, the missing grail imprisons its seeker. In Language, empty Mesopotamian fragments are "found but not put together" and Zion is only remembered. The lost God of this poetry remembers a meaning, a plenitude which masked or filled the vacancies and absences that occupy us now. But those vacancies have returned us to the conditions that cause a God (the "chaos-fluid" of Greece, Egypt); and the lacked object, the lost God/grail/plenitude that would have predicated us, is reclaimed within language. "The lack of the object," says Wilden, "is the gap in the signifying chain which the subject seeks to fill at the level of the signifier."1 6 That gap ("the missing Eurydice") allows Orpheus and Dante their words and their poems. Whether in hell or just dead, the beloved is absent; but because it is absent, the beloved is named. In the ninth of the Duino Elegies, Rilke suggests that the world means to arise invisibly within us, within our language. Beatrice has risen invisibly in Dante's language, but when the Divine Comedy has been told, 152</page><page sequence="9">she turns up, visible, in a local bordello. The Beatrice Dante names is the Beatrice absent from all bordellos, the flower absent from all bouquets (Mallarm6); and she becomes, comically, the chair in the symphony of God that people will never sit on ("Duet for a Chair and a Table," A Book of Music). The sexual moves, here, from the sublime to the excremental ("some kinds of love are horseshit"), but the extremities of the literal ("there was a motion picture that showed everything" [HC, 119]) are only an edge that the sexual passes. Brought, as we are, to a relentlessly blasphemous communion rail, everything turns in mystery against us, or turns, in reflected presence, against ours. Like wafers and wine, bordellos are metaphors, and a realism that calls these poems sexual biography is itself as bizarre as Dada. Just as Rimbaud "could not imagine persons to listen to the new language" (FN, 151), the "Fake Novel" can't imagine its own audience. The audience, of course, is barely there (from Language:"No one listens to poetry"), but its absence has more to do with words than with a contemporary sense of culture; or with words, at least, in poems. Spicer writes: "All the words they use for poetry are meaningless" (TP, 180). The poetic word is meaningless because it neither refers to the phantom object nor attaches itself to some meaningful system of signs; instead, it draws attention toward its own linguistic properties, to the acoustic and graphic dimensions of the word. For Jakobson, the "poetic function" of language is that which emphasizes the utterance or message itself, and "this function," he says, "by promoting the palpability of signs, deepens the fundamental dichotomy of signs and objects."17 Since words and things broke their bond at Babel, the palpable properties of the sign have been ontologically competitive with the object; but because the object's absence is the condition and cause of the signifier, and because the palpability of the sign has been brought forward by the poetic function of language, the sign seems more substantial now, and words more real than things. Language again: "No one listens to poetry. The ocean/ Does not mean to be listened to. A drop/ or crash of water. It means/ Nothing" (L, 217). This poetry has no audience because it is not addressed to them, because like the ocean, it does not "mean" to be listened to. Nor are its words addressed to "the song of each idea (whatever that means) that they are bound to" ("Plato's Marmalade" [FN, 162]). Plato has become sandwich spread; the meaninglessness of the poetic world has unsettled the "symphony of God." Words in poems, the poems themselves, are neither addressed to us, nor addressed to a reliable world of things outside. In this sense they are the dead letters ("A dead letter is there because it no longer has real addresses," [FN, 162] ) that become a major imagery in the "Fake Novel"; or, to reverse that, they are "a blank check" (FN, 162) made out, perhaps, to us, but with no stated content and a value we determine ourselves. Spicer says there is a ready-made dead-letter officer "in every 153</page><page sequence="10">human life" (FN, 164); there is, that is, a place in us that was designed to receive what wasn't really sent. In that poem ("The Dead Letter Officer"), Spicer asks two questions: "Who really mailed the letter? Who stole the signs?" But answers are unlikely, and "unlikelyness" hints of metaphor (HC, 130). Dead letters don't have return addresses, and we can do nothing more than suppose a sender. We can't name one (the sender doesn't name himself), just as Spicer couldn't name God with the faith of a Calvinist. And if the sign has been criminally rent ("stolen") from the signified, it is only a post-lapsarian/post-Babelic inheritance. Where we call that divergence a crime, we assume "what Jacques Derrida calls a 'metaphysics of presence' which longs for a truth behind every sign: a moment of original plenitude when form and meaning were simultaneously present to consciousness and not to be distinguished."18 But words, for Spicer, are like the "mythopoetic creatures" of another poem: they are casual, he says, about the proof of their existence (FN, 163). The semantic vapidity and casual insistence of the sign articulate another space, here between word and thing, in which the beautiful is to be returned to us. The spaces echo and image one another: the space between Orpheus and Eurydice, between territory and map, between sign and signified; the distances of poet from poem, and of audience from both. The darkened area between is the hell of "Homage to Creeley"; it is, as well, the "inland sea," the "Africa in all continents" to which (all) "Things have passage" (FN, 160); and it is that dead letter office in every human life that ventures us into some sense of being beyond abstracted presence. Even the distance between two letters (L, 243) is enough of a rent in the emperor's gown to let a little light infiltrate the perilous, adulterous woods of The Holy Grail and the "dark forest of words" in Language. "A Textbook of Poetry" was "created to explain" (TP, 183). So was Jesus: "To proclaim his humanity is to lie - to pretend that he was not a Word, that he was not created to Explain" (TP, 169). Where word (Word) and flesh meet, meaning is everywhere. Explanation was improbable and then impossible in the two preceding books, but here, an explanation is closing that articulated space between word and world. Spicer has said that the "Textbook" poems "are largely using the incarnation of Jesus as a metaphor for poetry."19 But "Homage to Creeley" and the "Fake Novel" have attended to some part of deity not caught up in Christ's flesh, to some part of meaning not held by nails upon crosses. The reclaimed plenitude of an explanatory Christ is this book's divergence and the contradiction, if there is one, of the larger text. The "Textbook" Christ may have been transfigured by the dead letter office, and then may have sanctioned the meaningless as formally as an explanation would have silenced it. Or word and world may have met in a plenitude as dubious as those the earlier books named and discarded. But because that plenitude has drawn attention to its own error, a 154</page><page sequence="11">transfigured Christ is already possible. By becoming just another dis- embodied word, his once transcendent flesh is truly transcendent again. In the tradition that Spicer had been taught, Christ had transcended the meaningless; but here, in this book, Christ transcends meaning itself. The temple becomes the place "where we worship words" and then becomes a sentence: Where one is is in a temple that sometimes makes us forget that we are in it. Where we are is in a sentence. Where we are this is idiocy. Where we are a block of solid glass blocks us from all we have dreamed of. But this place is not where we are we are to meet them. (TP, 175) We are predicated in our sentences and given a meaning there, even if that meaning is only the cogito ("we are" in a sentence). Our predication by the world is different. We are given presence, but that presence confronts an absence (Heidegger: "Mortals, when we think of their nature, remain closer to that absence because they are touched by presence, the ancient name of Being" [PLT, 93]). The absence is eventually our own, but its first form in Heads of the Town is the lost Eurydice, the absence of what we desire, of what we dream of. In the sentence (in language) we can at least see what we dream of; we can imagine there, or name, that lost thing, the beautiful, that the "Textbook" would re-create. But a block of solid glass, a space more formal now and finally luminous, keeps us from what we see while ensuring an ironic visibility. But if the beautiful is apparent in the sentence, we are not to meet it there: instead, we meet it outside language, and outside Christ, whose intelligence in the "Textbook" is repeatedly linguistic. Where the sentence forbids that meeting the language itself falls outside appearance; accordingly, the appearances that open this book are faked or forced or failed: the "first appearance" of a surreal Logos (TP, 169), the ghosts that the radio circuits try to make us see (TP, 170), the photograph and anti-image that would make the motions "of what it was to be apparent," the "things" the poet is "made to see" (TP, 171), the prevented appearance of love ("I have not words for him" [TP, 172] ). But those appearances are preliminary to a larger failure: If you see him everywhere or exactly nowhere, he becomes as it were the circumference of a circle that has no point but the boundary of your desire. Coming to a point. 155</page><page sequence="12">And the human witness of this passion is rightly stunned by the incongruity of it. Lifting a human being into a metaphor. All that we do in bed, or sleep, or sex is limited by this circle which can only be personally defined. On the outside of it is what everybody talks about. On the outside of it are the dead that try to talk. Once you try to embrace an absolute geometric circle the naked loss stays with you like a picture echoing. (TP, 173) That circle or circumference would describe the boundary of our desire; but because desire is unbound, and because the beloved or beautiful that would bind and complete it is lost, like Eurydice, in hell, the circle isn't really there. Language starts to speak outside the drawn circle ("on the outside of it is what everybody talks about"), as the circle itself is restricted within a personal definition which words transcend. In "Homage to Creeley," the poem emptied itself of poet and reader. Their renewed insignificance here repeats that banishment, but the language of these poems has long been immersed in exile and our displacement is looking familiar. Like "all things that use separate words" (TP, 176), we join a crowd of displaced dogs and parrots outside a city we had inhabited once and had occasionally ruled. But outside the city, the personal, the "1," becomes possible again. That much is promised by the transfigured Christ and broken circle of these poems. And it is effected within language: both human being and human witness, we are lifted into metaphor. The negation of the literal, and of the attendant assumption that sign meets signified in God, is beginning to be reversed and beginning to affirm the figurative. Just as in King Lear, Cordelia is silent and Goneril is talking. But Goneril's language lies to fill the vacancy that an absent king has left; a better voice, given over to metaphor, opens the corresponding space in language here: What I am, I want, asks everything of everyone, is by degrees a ghost. Steps down to the first metaphor they invented in the underworld (pure and clear like a river) the in-sight. As a place to step further. (TP, 182) The spaces and vacancies that have been the special preoccupation of this poetry are no longer the obstructive block of solid glass; nor are they darkened and damned and supposed to be hell. Instead, they are the occasion of our venture, the space for our further step; and they are the place, both in and outside the sentence, where we are to meet the 156</page><page sequence="13">beautiful again. Like the beautiful, the universe itself moves somewhere outside the literal word: "From the top to bottom there is a universe. Extended past what the words mean and below, God damn it, what the words are" (TP, 182). In turn, a thematic of transgression invades and undoes an array of closed forms in the "Textbook." We are brought outside the bland but absolute circle and brought into afterlife (TP, 171) and underworld (TP, 182). Spicer talks about a love beyond heat (TP, 174) and a lamp above love (TP, 181), about the "horny deeps below finding" (the "metasexual" [TP, 174]) and the "blue surcharge" for imaginary Tchad (TP, 180). "Real" poetry is "beyond us, beyond them" (TP, 183); "sheer presence" moves "beyond the word 'Beauty'" (TP, 182). And one poem magnificently watches the soul go "beyond the thought of God" (TP, 182). Above love, beyond God, the words which had once so simply signified rock or tree are turned back upon themselves and emptied of a meaning that had affirmed us as well. Each of them becomes "the door, by no human hand/ Open" of The Holy Grail (and in "Homage to Creeley," "the knot unknotted by something other than our hands"). The sudden free passage is guaranteed and ridiculed by the absence of that meaning we tend to invest in language; and words, in this sense, are the makers and mockers of man's enterprise (TP, 182), and the breakers, or bakers, of hearts. But the door is opened and the knot unknotted by something other than us. The spaces that open around us as our meanings fall are not our invention. It is not that we venture, but that we are ventured. Heidegger cites Rilke on nature: "it ventures us./ Except that we, more eager than plant or beast,/ go with this venture, will it, adventurous/ more sometimes than Life itself is, more daring/ by a breath" (PLT, 99). Charles Olson talks about a divine Inert (Causal Mythology) and an inactive Zeus (Poetry and Truth) that entrust the muses, who in turn entrust us, with the "further results of creation"20 which the uncharted space of Spicer's poetry means to effect. Heidegger, again, citing H61derlin's "Mnemosyne": "the heavenly powers/ Cannot do all things. It is the mortals/ Who reach sooner into the abyss" (PLT, 92). If I can say it this simply, that "something other than us" that opens doors and unknots knots is an abyss we have observed, explored,and then appropriated with empty signs and vacated gestures toward some lost beloved. And it doesn't matter that the sign in which we currently conquer has lost its significance ("That they have lost the significance of a name is unimportant. In hoc signo vicit" [TP, 183] ). Instead, it has value by losing value: it's an advantage this poetry carefully claims. For Spicer would have us conquer the place we step when we step further, and we are met there by an unknown and an unknowable that resist signification. Like the blank sheets that Snark hunters call maps, the insignificant word directs us dependably and tells us something of the confrontation ahead; but it becomes, of course, fabulously useless in terms of retreat. 157</page><page sequence="14">Having moved this far, the intelligence of these poems falls into a mechanism of venture that renders retreat impossible. A title from "Homage to Creeley" has said it before: "When You Go Away You Don't Come Home." And where there is "no way to turn except upward" (FN, 158), there is no backwards step. In The Holy Grail, Gwenivere forgets that, but by forgetting can ask a brilliant question: The question is pretty simple. I would never have been admitted to the Grail Castle but if I had been I would have asked it: "Why Did you admit me to the Grail Castle?" That would have stopped him. I am sick of the invisible world and all its efforts to be visible (HG, 198) Gwenivere has been admitted to the Grail Castle by being born (every time she speaks the invisible appears). Like everyone else, she has been articulated into a world or a consciousness whose condition the castle has caught by both suggesting and withholding a grail. The castle itself is only that temple or sentence "that sometimes makes us forget that we are in it" (TP, 175), and Gwenivere's confusion is accordingly general.-Her question, in turn, is neither hypothetical nor simple: it is real and complex. Spicer asks it everywhere, but like Gwenivere, he is careful to ask it foolishly. This poetry could so easily claim despair, but desperation would credit us with a profundity Spicer never did acknowledge. We are given, instead, laughter and laughable confidence: the question, says Gwenivere, would stop what admits us to some place outside what we know. Against that admission, Gwenivere argues a vocabulary of desire that answers itself in Lancelot: "Lance," she says, "what eyes (mine and yours) when, looking at each/ other we forget the Grail Castle for a moment at least/ Make it worth seeing it?" (HG, 198). But as it had for Dante and Newton (HC, 125), vocabulary turns against her. Desire begins to answer itself in a world. The question has spoken what it meant to silence: it is not all Lancelot, there is something larger than his allure. And the unanswered question is probably the room through which the grail, posing riddles and leaving traces, has most recently passed. Gwenivere's question is occasionally answered by an intelligence opposite hers. In Heads of the Town, her ontological reticence is placed beside an emboldened Orpheus who refrains from asking anything and gets all the way to hell. Orpheus translates that "further step" from Gwenivere's passive tenses to an active and undertaken venture. Where we witness and join his search for Eurydice, we are not just "admitted to" castles. Instead, we crash that metaphysical party above and beyond our God and our love. We walk brazenly into the space the grail has left, we 158</page><page sequence="15">step where the ground seems less sure. If we are awkward there, or just worldly, we tend to take pride in that and call it dance or desire. And that space we step into when we step without doubting is where we are to meet what we dream of (TP, 175), where we create the beautiful again (TP, 180): And in the gradual lack of the beautiful, the lock of the door before him, a new Eurydice, stepping up to him, punning her way through his hell. (TP, 171) In "Homage to Creeley," we were given Orpheus and Eurydice in "their last nuptial embrace" (HC, 122), but they are together again here. Spicer, though, is right to place the nuptial embrace behind us: Eurydice, here, is "new." Precisely because the beautiful has become gradually absent, its renewed and vital form may be rebuilt. Returned to the formless condition of hell, the archaic and inadequate shape of an old Eurydice has been broken to allow the new Eurydice an authentic but chimerical presence. She has become caught in a ceaseless movement between collapse and recomposition which ensures her returned form by preventing its completion. In this sense, Heads of the Town doesn't come to the end the last poem claims ("Now the things that are for Jim are coming to an end, I see nothing beyond it" [TP, 183]); it closes, instead, with "more than the words." That area outside words occasions a back and forth movement, a shimmer between heaven and hell that returns the text to the place it began and continues its language indefinitely. For that reason, the "Textbook" paradise survives. By being broken ("It does not have to fit together" [TP, 176]), by being continually returned to and built out from the hell it would somehow order, paradise is disturbing and real. And if we wish the beautiful back, we are asked to reopen that space that some god or grail or Eurydice is falsely filling now (Olson: "that the Mind or Will always/ successfully opposes &amp; invades the Previous, This/ is the rose is the rose is the rose of the World"21 ). To get to that necessary hell we need only do what Orpheus or Dante or Spicer does: to think and to love. Lifted, here, out of sentiment, love and intellect are engagements with something outside what we are. So is language: when Eurydice, by punning, speaks the confusion between sign and signified, she is given passage through hell. By thought and love and words we defeat the hypnosis of presence, the "sheer presences" that, without them, remain "uncoded, uncyphered" (TP, 182). To decode presence, to decipher it, to "draw forth answers deep from the caverns of objects" (TP, 178): we are transfigured out of presence by the questions we ask without ever expecting anything like reply. A transfigured language returns us an "I," but an "I" outside its own presence and inside a world: "the eye in the weeds (I am, I was, I will be, I am not)." And that's how 159</page><page sequence="16">we come to be moved to "where the real edge of it is" (TP, 183), to the "real roar" (TP, 181), and moved finally from what was just seashells held to ears.
