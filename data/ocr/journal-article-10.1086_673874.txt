      <p>Unsurprisingly, the authors of commendatory sonnets—those ubiquitous squares prefacing early modern publications—cultivated hyperbole rather than ambiguity, and projected enthusiastic conviction far more often than critical poise. The first three sonnets introducing George Chapman’s 1595 volume <italic>Ovids Banquet of Sence</italic> applaud the commended poet’s superlative genius as distinguished from the inferior productions of contemporary rivals peddling popular and derivative Ovidian imitations. Richard Stapleton—whose anonymous translation of a frivolous Latin elegy concludes the volume—offers a characteristic commendation, “<italic>Phoebus</italic> hath giuen thee both his bow, and Muse; / With one thou slayst the Artizans of thunder…/ The other decks her with her golden wings.” Thomas Williams follows with two sonnets of his own, testifying to Chapman’s triumph “(like <italic>Joue</italic>)” over “that bastard traine / Whose…iudgments, formeles still remaine.” Both poets proclaim Chapman’s divinity in contrast to the nullity of his detractors.<sup>1</sup>
      </p>
      <p>The final two commendatory sonnets by the epigrammatist John Davies, however, present a subtle dissonance both from the preceding standard fare and between themselves. The first not only elevates Chapman over his contemporaries but identifies him with Ovid as the <italic>praeceptor amoris</italic>, love’s original schoolmaster: <disp-quote>
            <verse-group>
               <verse-line>Betweene these hallowed leaues <italic>Cupid</italic> dooth keepe</verse-line>
               <verse-line>The golden lesson of his second Artist,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>For loue, till now, hath still a Maister mist</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Since <italic>Ouids</italic> eyes were closd with iron sleepe;</verse-line>
               <verse-line>But now his waking soule in <italic>Chapman</italic> liues…</verse-line>
               <verse-line>And doth more Prophet-like loues art enroule:</verse-line>
               <verse-line>For Ouids soule, now growne more old and wise,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Poures foorth it selfe in deeper misteries.<sup>2</sup>
               </verse-line>
            </verse-group>
         </disp-quote> For Davies, Chapman enjoys Cupid’s patronage—something short of the preceding sonnets’ predictable apotheoses—but the new poet’s chief claim on our attention lies in his descent from Ovid himself. The Roman poet’s soul is imagined inhabiting Chapman—an instance of Pythagorean metempsychosis adapted from the final book of the <italic>Metamorphoses</italic>—but that soul has also “growne more old and wise,” matured to “deeper misteries,” and left behind “loues art” as originally promulgated by Ovid.</p>
      <p> Davies’s second sonnet is more fun:<disp-quote>
            <verse-group>
               <verse-line>Since <italic>Ouid</italic> (loues first gentle Maister) dyed</verse-line>
               <verse-line>he hath a most notorious trueant beene,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>And hath not once in thrice fiue ages seene</verse-line>
               <verse-line>That same sweete Muse that was his first sweet guide;</verse-line>
               <verse-line>But since <italic>Apollo</italic> who was gratified</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Once with a kisse, hunting on <italic>Cynthus</italic> greene,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>By loues fayre Mother tender Beauties Queene,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>This fauor vnto her hath not enuied,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>That into whome she will, she may infuse</verse-line>
               <verse-line>For the instruction of her tender sonne,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>The gentle <italic>Ouids</italic> easie supple Muse,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Which vnto thee (sweet <italic>Chapman</italic>) she hath doone:</verse-line>
               <verse-line>Shee makes (in thee) the spirit of <italic>Ouid</italic> moue,</verse-line>
               <verse-line>And calles thee second Maister of her loue.<sup>3</sup>
               </verse-line>
            </verse-group>
         </disp-quote>Davies here celebrates the “infusion” or reinspiration of “Ouids easie supple Muse” into Chapman himself. This poetic genealogy is not cultivated through arduous, mysterious learning but given freely and ready-to-order by a personified Venus. The charmingly ephemeral myth of Apollo’s kiss, invented by Davies to explain Venus’s preference for Chapman, replaces the high metempsychosis of the first poem, and recalls instead the brief, interstitial aetiologies of Ovidian verse. Here Ovid is reborn in Chapman, whereas in the previous sonnet Ovid was reformed by Chapman.</p>
      <p>Unlike his fellow sonneteers, Davies captures an ambivalence at the heart of <italic>Ovids Banquet of Sence</italic>. His attitude seems appropriate to the anamorphic, paradoxical status of the poem’s central image of the weeping statue of Niobe, which “More neerely viewed, / Nor weeping, heavy, nor a woman shewed.”<sup>4</sup> Indeed, the sanguine, one-dimensional hyperboles of Stapleton and Williams seem almost inexplicable when applied to the self-divided <italic>Banquet</italic>, and far more in keeping with the hyper-satirical tone of Chapman’s debut performance—the <italic>Shadow of Night</italic>, published a year earlier with extensive (though specious) learned annotations. In the <italic>Shadow</italic>, Chapman had fulminated against the vulgar eroticism and stylistic excess of professional peers and rivals, positioning himself in diametrical opposition to the unapologetically Ovidian verse then in fashion.<sup>5</sup>
      </p>
      <p>In the following pages, I argue that we cannot account for Chapman’s ambivalent attitude in <italic>Ovids Banquet of Sence</italic>—the simultaneously reformed and reborn Ovid Davies identifies with the poet himself—without first setting that famously perplexing poem against its much less competent and less studied predecessor. The furious allegorical satire of the <italic>Shadow</italic> presents Chapman’s initial posture of anti-Ovidian polemicism—a garish backdrop against which the canny poet reintroduces himself as the sensitive and culturally informed author of the <italic>Banquet</italic>. Though he had pointedly excluded Ovid from the <italic>Shadow</italic>’s annotations, Chapman boldly resuscitates the Roman libertine as the misguided protagonist of the <italic>Banquet</italic>, essentially convening the trial that the historical Ovid—summarily exiled by the emperor Augustus in 8 CE—never received.<sup>6</sup> While Chapman’s Ovid ultimately condemns himself, the poem’s refreshingly liberal narrative voice and newly multivalent allusive texture finally constitute a surprising testimony to the continuing relevance of a responsible and considered engagement with Ovid. In effect, the <italic>Banquet</italic> grants Ovid a reprieve, as Chapman seeks to recreate a traditional humanist attitude of ambivalence toward the Roman libertine, updated and amplified for an Elizabethan literary culture awash in what he saw as second-rate Ovidian eroticism.<sup>7</sup>
      </p>
      <p>This is not to claim that by the English 1590s Ovid was synonymous with the <italic>praeceptor amoris</italic>, nor that Ovidianism stood monolithically for eroticism. On the contrary, I argue that the judicious ambivalence of Chapman’s sophomore poem corrects for the <italic>Shadow</italic>’s shrill insistence that contemporary Ovidianism’s rich and protean mixture—of eroticism, mythology, materialism, aetiology, allegory—could be reduced to a single corporate villain, and hunted out of culture in a few hundred fustian lines.<sup>8</sup> Still in the golden age of the Elizabethan minor epic and erotic elegy, Chapman’s satirical <italic>Shadow</italic>—published five years before the bishops of London and Canterbury would order all satires burned in the streets—proved premature, giving way to the <italic>Banquet</italic>’s elaborate compromise with literary fashion. Chapman’s ambivalence—visible to contemporaries (or at least to Davies)—thus reflects more than the continued marketability of Ovidian <italic>imitatio</italic>, and returning to the <italic>Banquet</italic> via the <italic>Shadow</italic> should help us to reassess late Elizabethan culture’s lingering obsession with Ovid.</p>
      <p>Simultaneously the most decadent cliché of the 1590s and the decade’s most fruitful poetic ground, Ovidianism was no longer a retrospective mode but rather a means of locating oneself among peers and rivals, themselves invested in striking imitative postures relative to the established fact of Ovid’s cultural prominence. In this sense, Chapman’s shifting attitude toward Ovidianism typifies a larger truth about the rapidly evolving literary culture of the 1590s. At this transitional moment—as private patronage was giving way to market-driven professionalism, as new audiences developed and old ones splintered—a nimble, readily adjustable allusive posture proved indispensible to ambitious young poets like Shakespeare or Chapman. Ovid’s centrality, as the common vertex of so many competing acts of poetic self-fashioning via allusive triangulation, results most immediately from the straightforward fact of his popularity—quite simply, Ovidian poetry sold.<sup>9</sup> In a deeper sense, however, Ovid’s popularity as a model for imitative poets originates in the protean nature of his corpus, in his manifold identities as erotic elegist, epic celebrant of a pagan cosmos, urbane representative of the aristocratic lifestyle, plaintive and hopeless exile.<sup>10</sup> At the same time, the Ovid of the Renaissance was not merely (nor even primarily) a figure of his own construction; he was also the beneficiary—at times, the victim—of the medieval and early modern impulse to inscribe multiple new identities on the legendary figures of the classical world. Hence, he became the serial moralizer of the didactic tradition, the archvillain of antipoetic diatribes, the master and slave of courtly love, the admonitory embodiment of wasted genius.<sup>11</sup> With so many recognizable faces, Ovid became the literary reference point par excellence; the Elizabethan poet first chose his Ovid, then defined himself in relation or in contradistinction to that figure yet (importantly for Chapman) remained free to self-revise allusively, in accordance with a developing career and in response to an evolving readership.<sup>12</sup>
      </p>
      <p>Against this backdrop, Chapman’s allusive engagement with Ovid seems at first quite limited: for Chapman, Ovid may either represent a decadent materialism at odds with the ethereal ideals of continental Neoplatonism—a figure to be driven mercilessly from genteel culture, as in the <italic>Shadow</italic>—or he may become the pitiable, exemplary victim of his own rhetoric, as in the <italic>Banquet</italic>. Even if not static, this version of Ovidianism still seems parsimonious when compared, say, to Shakespeare’s exuberant, stereoscopic adaptations of Ovid’s Pyramus and Thisbe myth for both <italic>Romeo and Juliet</italic> and <italic>A Midsummer Night’s Dream</italic>.<sup>13</sup> But even without the tragic fatality of a Juliet or the ludicrous enthusiasm of a Bottom, Chapman proves an Ovidian pioneer in his own fashion: his <italic>Shadow</italic>’s opportunistic satire of Ovidianism arrives well before the similar efforts of John Marston and John Weever at the turn of the century, while his <italic>Banquet</italic>’s strikingly sympathetic portrayal of the hapless figure of Ovid precedes Ben Jonson’s self-affirming caricature of the Roman libertine in his 1601 play, <italic>Poetaster</italic>. Chapman, in other words, is at once typical of his literary milieu and prescient as an imitative poet; his Ovid flickers between familiarity and novelty, between the poles of reformation and rebirth.</p>
      <sec id="sc1">
         <title>Banishing the Ovidian Corpus from the <italic>Shadow of Night</italic>
         </title>
         <p>Both Ovid’s <italic>Metamorphoses</italic> and Chapman’s <italic>Shadow of Night</italic> begin with chaos, awaiting formation by divine fiat. While such a cosmogony is hardly unique to these two works, Chapman presumably derives his improbable adjective <italic>indigest</italic>—which he applies both to the cosmic formlessness preceding the world’s creation and to the corrupted state of contemporary civilization—directly from Ovid’s <italic>rudis indigestaque moles</italic>, the “rough, unordered mass” of the <italic>Metamorphoses</italic>’s opening lines.<sup>14</sup> The debt, however, would seem to end with this indigestion, for Chapman’s resolution of the chaos of the <italic>Metamorphoses</italic> into Neoplatonic order requires nothing less than the repudiation of Ovidian style and substance. Specifically, the remainder of the <italic>Shadow</italic> presents the new poet’s rejection or subversion of metamorphic myths, the castigation of a licentious poetics identified in the Elizabethan period with Ovid’s erotic elegies, and the telling exclusion of Ovidian reference from the volume’s elaborate (and spurious) citations.</p>
         <p>This decidedly anti-Ovidian stance, however, most directly opposes not the Roman poet himself but his Elizabethan descendents—Lodge, Marlowe, Shakespeare, even Spenser—riding the crest of the contemporary vogue for Ovidian imitations. Pointedly ironizing the Ovidian epigraph to Shakespeare’s immensely popular <italic>Venus and Adonis</italic>, published the year before, Chapman converts his rival’s self-congratulation to an admonishment against poetic license: “Presume not then ye flesh confounded soules, / That cannot beare the full Castalian bowles, / Which seuer mounting spirits from the sences, / To looke in this deepe fount for thy pretenses” (<italic>HC</italic> 162–65).<sup>15</sup> Already espousing the Neoplatonic division between “mounting spirit” and “confounded flesh”—the constant theme of his oeuvre—Chapman castigates all who succumb to the “lawless flames of Cupids Godhead,” while celebrating “Wise Poetes” who “properlie” portray the chastity of his Cynthia (484, 501). Alongside this distinction, Chapman endorses an old-fashioned allusive adjudication: those myths in accord with Christian ethics are to be preferred, adapted, and imitated; the “flesh confounded” elements of classical literature, on the other hand—the Ovidian most of all—are to be rejected.</p>
         <p>Yet even as he establishes Ovid as anathema, Chapman refers his reader repeatedly and explicitly to the myths he denigrates. Thus he impugns versions of the Endymion story that portray Cynthia as an adulteress: <disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Therefore those Poetes did most highly fault,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>That fainde thee fiftie children by Endimion,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>And they that write thou hadst but three alone,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Thou neuer any hadst, but didst affect</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Endimion for his studious intellect.</verse-line>
                  <attrib>(<italic>HC</italic> 490–94)</attrib>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>The inclusion here, not only of the most licentious portrayal of Cynthia as the mother of fifty bastards but also of an intermediate version of the myth, in which she bears “but three,” reveals Chapman’s tendency to draw attention to the kind of poetry he would be seen to avoid. Again, proposing to purge unsalvageably wicked myths from Diana’s temple, Chapman ironically ushers them into his poem: <disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Thy virgin chamber then that sacred is,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>No more let hold, an idle Salmacis,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Nor let more sleights, Cydippe iniurie [injure]:</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Nor let blacke Ioue possest in Sicilie,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Rauish more maids.</verse-line>
                  <attrib>(508–12)</attrib>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>As the <italic>Shadow</italic> draws to its close, this itemization of proscribed myths underscores the paradoxical element in Chapman’s allusive practice; Salmacis, Cydippe, and the rapacious Pluto (called “blacke Ioue” as Jove’s diabolical manifestation) are all of Ovidian provenance.<sup>16</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Chapman’s paradoxical reliance on Ovidian content moreover corresponds to an opportunistically Ovidian style throughout the <italic>Shadow</italic>, most emphatically during the poem’s longest narrative digression, in which the divine Cynthia spends an afternoon hunting down the sensual passions, figured as a hapless mob of rubes and dogs. In keeping with Neoplatonic doctrine—according to which the divine One differentiates itself into an infinite series of lower manifestations, increasingly subject to our human comprehension<sup>17</sup>—Chapman depicts his goddess’s descent from her heavenly sphere to a mythic landscape more amenable to narration. As Cynthia steps into the anthropomorphic dimensions of Ovid’s vindictive Diana, Chapman’s allegory likewise descends from a hymnic exposition of Neoplatonic mysteries to an incisive satire of the contemporary literary scene. Subverting one of the most widely imitated of Ovid’s myths—Diana’s transformation of Actaeon into a stag, to be devoured by his own hounds (<italic>Met</italic>. 3.138–255)—Chapman “confounds” his rivals with their own material.<sup>18</sup>
         </p>
         <p>At the same time, Chapman takes great care to keep his Cynthia chastely aloof from satire and sensuality. Having crafted a nymph she dubs Euthymia from pure ether, the goddess proceeds to summon a vociferous rabble of hunters and hounds out of the lower elements—from “the flowrs, the shadowes, and the mists, / (Fit matter for most pliant humorists)” (<italic>HC</italic> 221–22)—and sends them in pursuit of her simulacrum, transforming the latter into a panther for bait. Once she confounds the hunting party, we last see Euthymia “turn’d a Bore / More huge then that th’Ætolians plagud so sore” (378–79)—that is, larger than the beast described most fully by Ovid in the <italic>Metamorphoses</italic> (8.281–99). While the narrative thus verges on incoherence, the digression’s satirical gist remains clear enough: both earthly monarch and universal principle, Cynthia commissions Euthymia—Chapman’s own “shadow,” endowed with stoic imperturbability—to turn the tables on the sensual, semibestial Ovidians of the 1590s.</p>
         <p>Yet even as Chapman pursues an allegory simultaneously lampooning the contemporary literary scene and illustrating his own initiative to reform it, he reproduces and exaggerates the allusive and rhetorical tropes characteristic of early modern Ovidianism itself. Hence, his Actaeons proliferate; his Calydonian Boar balloons; his Cynthia begets an Ovidian Diana, whose metamorphic familiar bags more Ovidian game than ever. To be sure, Chapman eliminates the eroticism of Ovidian elegy—for now rejecting the unsavory role of <italic>praeceptor amoris</italic>—but everything else we might expect of Ovidian verse is here: the episodic and digressive narration, the recombination of mythic materials, the corrective moralization, the aetiological retrofitting of form to character, and a half-virtuosic, half-parodic epic catalog modeled on Ovid’s enumeration of Actaeon’s dogs. As he shows himself transcending the febrile sensuality of his own milieu, the new poet deploys his rivals’ low mythological means to his own higher philosophical ends, regenerating the Ovidian landscape in order to reenact its dissolution. As a chaste answer to Shakespeare’s voluble Venus, Chapman’s Cynthia reflects her opposite, and the new satirist’s fustian ultimately echoes the complaint he derides. The cacophony of confounded hounds and hunters—which the poet likens to a whirlwind and an earthquake—drowns out commonplace morality, until the poet must banish his own unruly myths with an arbitrary nightfall:  <disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>But dayes arme (tir’d to hold her torch to them)</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Now let it fall within the Ocean streame,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>The Goddesse blew retraite, and with her blast,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Her morns creation did like vapours wast [waste].</verse-line>
                  <attrib>(<italic>HC</italic> 390–93)</attrib>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>It is meant, perhaps, as sprezzatura—venery and the venereal dispelled within a line—but it reads with notable effort: both the parenthetical “(tir’d to hold her torch to them)” and Cynthia’s “retraite” confess the exhaustion of a poet unable to cope and to quiet the elements that after all make up his matter. On its own, this anticlimactic fiat cannot erase what is manifest in the preceding digression: as much as his contemporaries, Chapman identifies himself in relation to the literary fashion for Ovidian verse.</p>
         <p>Perhaps because the imitative and adaptive aspects of the <italic>Shadow</italic>’s constituent hymns invite readerly misidentifications of the poet with undesirable models like Ovid, Chapman appends an elaborate self-critical apparatus advertising his debt to a select group of preferred classical authors. Yet the volume’s forty-one endnotes also function as a blacklist of sorts, the exclusions—especially of Ovidian texts—as pointed as the inclusions. In these notes, Chapman develops a subgeneric play space, in which influence corresponds directly to the proportionality of competing citations. Here, the poet exercises a more direct control over his own allusive register, presenting his scholarly credentials while simultaneously testifying to the unimpeachable mores of the authors inspiring his <italic>furor poeticus</italic>. The notes thus recast the <italic>Shadow</italic> as it was meant to be, correcting for the ambiguities of mythographic poetry and shoring up the new poet’s anti-Ovidian posture.</p>
         <p>However classically oriented the <italic>Shadow</italic>’s notes—only two refer to early modern authors—scholars have long noted the precedent of Spenser’s <italic>Shepheardes Calender</italic> (published anonymously in 1579) and its copious commentary by the mysterious “E.K.” Elaborating the resemblance between the <italic>Shadow</italic> and the <italic>Calender</italic>, Gerald Snare distinguishes “Chapman the glossarial interpreter” from “Chapman the poet,” and argues that the “glosser articulates in another voice the precise preoccupations of the material invention itself, a voice made to be somewhat distant from the obsessions of poetic artifice and the voice invented to articulate them.”<sup>19</sup> Unlike E.K., however, Chapman permits the scholarly third-person voice of the annotations to break down in the final, unnumbered note to the “Hymnus in Noctem,” as he dismisses ignorant readers in the first-person: “for the rest, God help them, I can not (do as others), make day seeme a lighter woman then she is, by painting her.” The “other voice” of the <italic>Shadow</italic>’s glosses merges with the voice of the <italic>Shadow</italic> poet at the exact point where Chapman admits his “preoccupation” with the vulgarity he would be seen to reject. The visual metaphor seems more appropriate than the vocal one, for the note arrives at the center of the volume, preceding the “Hymnus in Cynthiam” as the last word of the “Hymnus in Noctem”—a prominent authorial interjection in the midst of scholarly posturing, and one that reflects Chapman’s approach to Ovidian material in the hymns themselves.</p>
         <p>Of course, scholars have long regarded the <italic>Shadow</italic>’s notes as imposture, ever since Franck Schoell exposed Chapman’s wholesale exploitation of Natale Conti’s popular <italic>Mythologiae</italic>.<sup>20</sup> Chapman adapts virtually all of the lore compacted in the hymns themselves from Conti’s encyclopedic work, while the learning on display in his notes is even more directly “extracted” from the same source—paraphrased, translated, or simply transcribed.<sup>21</sup> As John Mulryan and Stephen Brown have demonstrated, many early modern English authors quoted or paraphrased extensively from the <italic>Mythologiae</italic>, often without attribution,<sup>22</sup> but Chapman actively dissembles the nature and degree of his borrowing, citing Conti only once in a minor note (<italic>HN</italic> 204n). The initial notes to each hymn, moreover, create the impression that Chapman has obliged his readers by translating his recondite Greek “sources” into familiar Latin (though never into vulgar English), when he has merely transferred both the Greek texts and Conti’s Latin translations from the <italic>Mythologiae</italic>.<sup>23</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Given the ubiquity of Conti’s influence in the period, it seems unlikely that Chapman expected to deceive his well-educated readers, among them the aristocrats and potential patrons whose names he dropped in his dedicatory epistle. By opening the dedication—and in a literal sense, beginning his poetic career—with a paraphrase of Conti’s discussion of the Medusa myth as an elaborate allegory for scholarly endeavor, Chapman was presenting himself as one of a select intellectual community who knew exactly where to find and how to apply the best interpretations of classical literature. Chapman’s application of Conti thus entailed a twofold authorial strategy: even as he displayed his deep classical learning to the general reader, he sought to impress his more knowledgeable readers with his judicious selection and deft distribution of overabundant mythological material. To this latter end, he produced a significantly partial epitome of the <italic>Mythologiae</italic>, straining whatever seemed vulgar out of that universal source.</p>
         <p>Above all, this meant presenting a mythology cleansed of the Ovidianism of the moment, which indeed amounted to a revision of Conti, for while the preface to the <italic>Mythologiae</italic> culminates in a pointed dismissal of the <italic>Metamorphoses</italic>, Conti nevertheless cites Ovid over 150 times, ranging across the entire Ovidian corpus, referring even to the fragmentary <italic>Medicamina faciei femineae</italic> and the forgettable <italic>Consolatio ad Liviam</italic>.<sup>24</sup> When Chapman mines the <italic>Mythologiae</italic> for his <italic>Shadow</italic>, however, he discards all references to Ovid, even as he ventriloquizes the rest of the classical tradition. Judging from his self-critical apparatus, Chapman seems to rely on Aratus, Hesiod, Plato, Homer, Lycophron, Orpheus, Pherecydes, Callimachus, Catullus, Menander, Pausanias, Plutarch, Apollonius, Strabo, Nicander, Euripides, and Cicero—as well as on Giraldi and on Conti himself—but never on Ovid, whose exclusion is all the more conspicuous for the inclusion of the equally salacious Catullus.</p>
         <p>Hence, while he lifts the material for at least seven of his notes from Conti’s discussion of the goddess Diana in a single chapter of the <italic>Mythologiae</italic>, Chapman avoids any reference to the extensive quotations from Ovid’s <italic>Metamorphoses</italic> at the heart of that same chapter.<sup>25</sup> And though Conti cites both Euripides and Ovid as authorities on the Iphigenia myth, his Elizabethan beneficiary eliminates the latter reference from his notes, while pointedly retaining the former.<sup>26</sup> Extensively adapting Conti’s accounts of the tragedies of Actaeon and Meleager, Chapman obscures the <italic>Metamorphoses</italic> as the chief source for these myths.<sup>27</sup> Wherever Conti has anchored his research in Ovid’s accounts, Chapman systematically erases the vestiges of that influence from the mythographic record, banishing the Ovidian corpus from the phantom library of the <italic>Shadow</italic>.</p>
         <p>I do not mean to suggest that Chapman appended such an extensive self-critical apparatus to his debut volume merely to eliminate all traces of Ovidian influence, nor do I claim that the <italic>Shadow</italic>’s allegorical content is limited to its satire of Ovidian sensuality. Whether explicit or implicit, anti-Ovidianism presents but one aspect of the late Elizabethan poet’s necessarily complex negotiation among a multiplicity of past and present cultural authorities and literary models. Hence, even as he excludes Ovid from his notes, Chapman likewise suppresses any reference to Virgil, despite the prominence of both Augustan poets in Conti’s <italic>Mythologiae</italic>. In effect, Chapman’s exclusion of Virgil is even more pronounced than his exclusion of Ovid, insofar as the former had been defended and promoted by many generations of humanists, often at Ovid’s expense.<sup>28</sup> Conti, too, had noticeably exploited the differential between the poets’ reputations, generally quoting them in reverse order and allowing the elder laureate’s authority to correct the misprision of the exiled libertine.<sup>29</sup> Yet the very recognizability of Virgilian <italic>exempla</italic>—taught in grammar schools, quoted in courtesy books, imitated by poets everywhere, used up over the course of the Renaissance—prompts Chapman’s ostensible preference for more arcane and original learning. However superior his ethical claims, Virgil’s traditional eminence renders him just as unsuitable for Chapman’s purposes as the increasingly popular Ovid. More than ever, the classical precursor’s reputation drives the Elizabethan poet’s allusive choices and imitative postures, even when the result is the collapse of any effective distinction between fame and notoriety. In order to simulate an allusive investment in the remoter lore of classical antiquity, Chapman dismisses contemporary poetry’s most familiar precedents—Virgil as well as Ovid.</p>
         <p>These counterallusive gestures of exclusion, however, were only apparently commensurate. By the mid-1590s, the Ovidian authorial posture had grown increasingly viable, finding receptive audiences among patrons, readers, and playgoers. At the same time, the prestige of a traditional Virgilian persona proved all but unavailable to a new generation of poets writing in the shadow of the 1590 <italic>Faerie Queene</italic>. For even as he had simultaneously invoked and exploited the ideological dependability of Virgilian imitation, Spenser had pushed such obvious laurels beyond the reach of rivals and successors; indeed, he too responded to his own effectual laureate status with a recognizable turn toward Ovidianism in the second half of his career.<sup>30</sup> While Marlowe, Shakespeare, and others were happy to follow the fashion, Chapman sought to present an alternative set of allusive credentials, triangulating his own intellectual primacy by identifying himself increasingly with Greek sources.<sup>31</sup> In practical terms, while this intertextual self-centering entailed a simple avoidance of Virgilian precedent—Chapman all but ignored the Augustan laureate throughout his career<sup>32</sup>—the Ovidianism against which the new poet sought to define himself presented a far more urgent and formidable challenge. The desultory satire and selective annotations of the <italic>Shadow of Night</italic> were hardly adequate for that challenge, and within a year Chapman would publish the obsessional <italic>Ovids Banquet of Sence</italic>.</p>

            <italic>Ovids Banquet of Sence</italic> as Retrial and Mistrial</title>
         <p>For an Elizabethan writing self-consciously in the tradition of quattrocento Italian humanism, the correct attitude toward Ovid—as he was perceived through his extant works and legendary biography—was not the polemical rejection of the <italic>Shadow of Night</italic> but a politic reservation of judgment. To most Neo-Latin stylists, Ovid’s verse was admirable but frequently overwrought—an attitude underwritten by Quintilian’s classic assertion that Ovid was “an excessive lover of his own genius” (nimis amator ingenii sui).<sup>33</sup> The poet’s rumored affair with Augustus’s daughter Julia—generally identified with the “Corinna” who obsesses the lascivious persona of Ovid’s early elegies—lent this appraisal a moral valence, and many commentators regretted that the <italic>praeceptor amoris</italic> had apparently taught himself too well. Angelo Poliziano illustrates the temperate critical standard in his <italic>Nutricia</italic>, a hyperlearned digest of ancient authors composed in 1486: <disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Sed Tiberim, dominum rerum mundique potentem,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>ambigitur riguine tener Sulmonis alumnus</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>nobilitet magis an vero tibi, Roma, pudori</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>sit potius, Getica sic semisepultus harena</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>(proh dolor!) exsul, inops, nimium quia forsan amico</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>lumine Caesareae spectaverit ora puellae.</verse-line>
               </verse-group>
               <p>[It is uncertain whether the dear scion of well-watered Sulmona [i.e., Ovid] lends more nobility to the Tiber, master and ruler of the world, or whether he is rather a source of shame to you, Rome, half-buried as he was on the Getan shore, alas! an impoverished exile, perhaps because he cast too fond a glance at Caesar’s young daughter.]<sup>34</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote>The grammatically passive, impersonal verb <italic>ambigitur</italic> marks this noncommittal response as received wisdom, though the verb also distinguishes Ovid from the more objectionable (and infinitely less important) authors, like Cornificius, Cinna, and Anser, whom Poliziano unequivocally condemns.<sup>35</sup> Commenting almost 150 years later, George Sandys commits more firmly to Ovid’s exoneration: <disp-quote>
               <p>The cause of [Ovid’s] so cruell and deplored exile, is rather coniectured then certainely knowne. Most agree that it was for his too much familiarity with I<sc>ulia</sc> the daughter of A<sc>ugustus</sc>, masked vnder the name of C<sc>orinna</sc>. Others that hee had vnfortunately seene the incest of C<sc>aesar</sc>: which may be insinuated, in that he complaines of his error, and compares himselfe to <sc>Actæon.</sc> But the pretended occasion was for his composing of the Art of Loue, as intollerably lasciuious and corrupting good manners. A pretence I may call it, since vnlikely it is, that hee should banish him in his age for what hee writ when hardly a man, and after so long a conniuance.<sup>36</sup>
               </p>
            </disp-quote> The anti-Ovidian acrobatics of the 1594 <italic>Shadow</italic>, then, seem retrograde in relation to a broad historical trend toward Ovid’s recuperation, locating Chapman at a potentially undesirable cultural extreme.</p>
         <p>To be sure, disowning Ovid entirely could differentiate a young poet (and his patrons) from the unbridled eroticism of rivals like Marlowe and Thomas Nashe, who took evident delight in adapting salacious Ovidian models.<sup>37</sup> In the midst of the Elizabethan vogue for Ovidian <italic>imitatio</italic>, however, the reactionary attitude espoused in the <italic>Shadow</italic> might well have struck many readers as obsolete, redolent of an earlier generation’s efforts to discredit poetry in general, as exemplified by Stephen Gosson’s 1579 <italic>Schoole of Abuse</italic>. Gosson had been especially shrill in his rejection of Ovid, and had specifically condemned “that trumpet of Baudrie, the Craft of loue”—the <italic>Ars amatoria</italic>.<sup>38</sup> In his famous riposte to Gosson—<italic>The Defence of Poesy</italic>—Sir Philip Sidney quotes and translates a harmless line from the <italic>Ars</italic>, and resorts periodically to Ovidian allusions.<sup>39</sup> At the same time, several of Sidney’s allusions retain the studied ambivalence of Poliziano,<sup>40</sup> and his elegant, diplomatic Ovidianism exposes the truculence of Gosson, whose diatribe—derivative even in 1579—was hardly current in 1595 when Chapman published his second volume, <italic>Ovids Banquet of Sence</italic>.<sup>41</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Chapman’s sophomore poem corrects for the stale polemicism of the previous year’s <italic>Shadow</italic>, reclaiming the traditional attitude of ambivalence toward the Ovidian corpus as a model for imitation. Indeed, the <italic>Banquet</italic>’s long, bifurcated critical legacy—identifying the poem alternately as sardonically anti-Ovidian or as recuperating even the <italic>praeceptor amoris</italic> through an appeal to Ficinian Neoplatonism—has followed naturally from this fundamental ambivalence.<sup>42</sup> In the <italic>Banquet</italic>, Chapman neither emulates Ovid’s style nor parodies it but rather stages a trial of the poet himself, resuscitating the <italic>praeceptor amoris</italic> and his beloved Corinna as characters, in order to investigate the origins of Ovidian eroticism and adjudicate the ethos at its core. The <italic>Banquet</italic>’s ambivalence, I argue, resides not in Chapman’s treatment of the resuscitated Ovid, who is in any case prejudicially condemned—his physical corpus destined for banishment, his subversive literary corpus to be left in the hands of unscrupulous imitators. Instead, the poem’s ambivalence lies in Chapman’s metaphorical deferral of the execution of Ovid’s sentence, in his ambiguous presentation of a mediating narrator, and in his deployment of a multivalent allusive texture altogether opposed to the specious Contian annotations of the <italic>Shadow</italic>. Chapman’s <italic>Banquet</italic>—unlike Sandys’s apologetic preface decades later—is not meant to exonerate Ovid, whose dubious reputation the unabashed sensuality of Elizabethan admirers had undermined anew. Instead, Chapman presents the mature poet’s response to the cultural phenomenon of Ovidianism, facing poetic fashion—however regrettable, however ephemeral—as a present fact. In the process, whether by design or by accident, he develops one of the most complex portraits of Ovid to emerge from the Renaissance.</p>
         <p>Chapman begins by shuffling the “facts” of Ovid’s biography, engendering a more complex, self-ironizing figure. According to his own apology in the late <italic>Tristia</italic>, Ovid’s banishment had resulted from <italic>carmen et error</italic>—a poem and a political misstep.<sup>43</sup> As Sandys notes, Ovid himself identified the former as the <italic>Ars amatoria</italic>—the infamous erotic primer Chapman’s character promises to compose toward the <italic>Banquet</italic>’s conclusion—but the <italic>error</italic> remained unspecified and was therefore open to later biographical embellishment. At least for the purposes of his <italic>Banquet</italic>, Chapman subscribes to the “conjecture” of Ovid’s “familiarity” with Julia/Corinna—herself later banished by her father for sexual license<sup>44</sup>—yet reverses the order of the Roman poet’s supposed transgressions: rather than interpreting the furor over the long-notorious <italic>carmen</italic> as an official cover-up for the mysterious <italic>error</italic>, Chapman reimagines the <italic>error</italic> as the inspiration for the <italic>carmen</italic>. By rearranging the conveniently dubious biography, Chapman clears space for the presentation of an Ovid we do not quite recognize: the classical poet portrayed before the composition of his poetry, a preinfluential Ovid. This fictionalized persona proves a peculiar, composite character, at once the classical lover and the early modern Neoplatonist, reckless in his actions but paralytically deliberative in his thought, capable of shaping his poetry to his desire, but driven by desire to the distortion of his poetry. Prioritizing Ovid’s <italic>error</italic> over his <italic>carmen</italic>—trying the erratic poet where others had summarily condemned his erotic art—Chapman implicitly indicts not licentious texts but the fallen natures of the poets who produce them, not the written corpora of his contemporaries but their fleshly bodies.</p>
         <p>On its face, it seems frivolous to differentiate in this way between Ovid’s summary “disappearance” from the <italic>Shadow</italic> and the textual habeas corpus of the <italic>Banquet</italic>, for even in the latter poem there is finally no question of Ovid’s culpability and, by extension, that of the Ovidians descended from him. Indeed, one might claim that the <italic>Banquet</italic>’s recapitulation of the Roman poet’s <italic>error</italic> is rather meant to justify Chapman’s prior animus toward Ovidians than to temper it, for while the Elizabethan poet now permits Ovid an unprecedented license to speak and act anew, the unscrupulous libertine only damns himself once more, betrayed by his own turpitude. Upon encountering the nude Corinna bathing in Caesar’s private garden, wooing her, feasting each of his senses in turn, and approaching (though never achieving) sexual consummation, Chapman’s Ovid declares, “For thy sake will I write the Art of loue” (<italic>OBS</italic> 113.5). Deliberate in the <italic>Banquet</italic> where he had been peremptory before, Chapman depicts the genesis of the very poem Gosson had dismissed out of hand: the <italic>Ars amatoria</italic>, the archetype for early modern erotic elegy.</p>
         <p>Chapman thus ironizes the characteristic aetiological aspect of the Ovidian mythographic mode, identifying Ovid at the site of poetry’s original sin, for in the <italic>Banquet</italic>, Caesar’s Garden is an Edenic space, Corinna an enciphered Eve, and Ovid superimposed over Adam. In this secular recapitulation of the Fall, Ovid willfully chooses his role of <italic>praeceptor amoris</italic>, elects to instruct his descendents in his “Art,” and is fittingly cast out of the Garden in the <italic>Banquet</italic>’s penultimate stanza: <disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Heere <italic>Ouid</italic> interrupted with the view</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Of other Dames, who then the Garden painted,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Shrowded himselfe, and did as death eschew</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>All note by which his loues fame might be tainted:</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>And as when mighty <italic>Macedon</italic> had wun</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>The Monarchie of Earth, yet when hee fainted,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Grieu’d that no greater action could be doone,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>And that there were no more worlds to subdue,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>So loues defects, loues Conqueror did rue.</verse-line>
                  <attrib>(116)</attrib>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>Like the villain of a Chaucerian fabliau, Ovid dives into the bushes to conceal his illicit dalliance, yet he cannot escape the tragic implications of “shrowd[ing] himselfe…as death.” Though compared to Alexander the Great in his moment of global triumph, Chapman’s Ovid simultaneously evokes the quintessential conqueror’s ironically limited worldly vision, mortal weakness (“when hee fainted”), and premature death—the “Monarchie of Earth” merges with the grave. The stanza’s final word, from the Latin <italic>ruere</italic> (to fall) likewise puns on Ovid’s status as a secular Adam.</p>
         <p>This fictional, Adamic Ovid seems oddly dissociated from the real Ovid’s textual corpus. Whenever the Roman poet’s erotic or mythological verse would naturally seem most relevant to his long monologues, Chapman’s resuscitated corpus/corpse of Ovid speaks paradoxically only with other voices, of generally anachronistic provenance—Petrarchan conceits, Neoplatonic commonplaces from Ficino, snapshots from Spenser’s Bower of Bliss. This allusive cacophony accompanies a malfunctioning rhetoric, as the unwitting antihero punningly foredooms himself whenever he opens his mouth. Declaring his ears “sette on fire / With an immortall ardor” (17.1–2), the hapless poet pronounces himself hellbound in a threefold sense: paranomastically (“sette” can also mean “bound”), etymologically (“ardor” derives from the Latin <italic>ardere</italic>, [to burn]), and metaleptically (insofar as “immortall” can evoke the flames of hell as readily as the music of heaven, more so as the adjective modifies “ardor”). His ears burning, and desiring “that every tuch may make such Musick” (19.9), Ovid moreover confounds himself through synesthesia—the trope of sensory unity familiar in the poetry of Chapman’s professional rivals—and in the process forecasts his precipitous descent down the ladder of the senses, even as he presumes to climb it.<sup>45</sup>
         </p>
         <p>There is more to the <italic>Banquet</italic>, however, than Ovid’s self-incriminating speeches, and we should not imagine that Chapman reserves his poem’s rhetorical fireworks only for his faulty protagonist. On the contrary, the synaesthetic tropes characterizing Ovid’s hypersensitive and self-involved monologues equally inform the poem’s purely narrative sections, and indeed precede Ovid himself into Corinna’s garden. The puns that so bedevil Ovid’s speeches spread to every corner of the poem and render Chapman’s most sententious pronouncements ironic, as in the case of a pivotal stanza often read unironically as legitimizing the poet’s Neoplatonic credentials: <disp-quote>
               <verse-group>

            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>For Jerald Jahn, this passage demonstrates that Chapman’s “Ovid lacks…the knowledge with which to moderate his ascent at its natural zenith,” and resolves the poem as a “tragedy of natural aspiration.”<sup>46</sup> But the pun on “fayre”—suggesting that feminine “beauty” is constantly for sale as an artificial commodity, however “natural” its “witchcraft”—seems rather to affect “men” in general than Ovid in particular. Nor are these “men” identified in any way as vulgur sensualists like those castigated in the <italic>Shadow</italic>; on the contrary, the repetition of the unspecified indirect object lends a new universality to Chapman’s social critique.</p>
         <p>The most fully individuated presence in this central stanza, in any case, is not Ovid—momentarily stunned into uncharacteristic silence by his first glimpse of Corinna—but Chapman, who puns unmistakably on his own name, referring to the “chapmen” who buy and sell “beauties fayre” at “beauty’s fair.” Hence, while the stanza seems to turn via Ficino’s account of platonic love—“her owne, / Seene in another”—toward heavenly ascent (with or without Ovid in tow), the poet undermines any claim to philosophical seriousness by depicting himself as a huckster of “all eternitie,” as someone who would sell that “heaven” to any customer. The noun “chapmen” moreover can refer as readily to those who buy as to those who sell, and the personal pun thus implicates Chapman on both sides of an unsavory commercial transaction.<sup>47</sup> 
            <italic>Ovids Banquet</italic> itself is “beauties fayre”: the poet promises “heauen” to those who will buy its “endles showes,” and is himself promised eternity—presumably in the form of fame or wealth—by its sale.</p>
         <p>Chapman’s ironic intervention at this pivotal moment is only the most pointed instance of the poem’s narratological complexity, more often mediated through a narrator-persona so well defined as to constitute a third ghostly presence in Corinna’s garden. Sympathetic to Ovid and clearly in love with Corinna, this narrator—rather than the character Ovid himself—vocalizes Chapman’s ambivalence; as Gerald Snare argues, “If the narrator is providing a guide for us…he does so in a profoundly ambiguous way. His rhetoric, of course, is as elaborate as Ovid’s, as extended, as if possessed by a poetic frenzy analogous to those which continually possess Ovid. Moreover, his epic warnings are as erotically charged as Ovid’s self-descriptions.”<sup>48</sup> This narrator—the repository of Chapman’s ironic self-awareness as an anti-Ovidian resuscitating Ovid—provides the interface between the poet, his subject, and his reader.</p>

         </title>
         <p>At the center of Corinna’s garden, Chapman presents an ekphrasis of the myth of Niobe, whose fourteen children were massacred by Apollo and Diana after the hapless mother had boasted of her own fertility, while foolishly mocking the divine Latona for having borne only one set of twins. Chapman’s figure is as much a portent as a tomb:<sup>49</sup>

                  <attrib>(<italic>OBS</italic> 3)</attrib>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>This is no mere effigy but the petrified Niobe herself, encircled by the contorted forms of her fourteen dying children—carved, in a sense, out of Ovid’s <italic>Metamorphoses</italic> and imported to imperial Rome (and by extension into Elizabethan culture). As the ekphrasis spills into the following stanza, we discover that the gloomy emperor has even devised a mechanism by which the execution of the children may be reproduced on a daily basis, erecting twin prismatic obelisks representing Apollo and Diana, through which blood-colored sunbeams are shot in fusillade at the dying statues (6.1–7). Any sunny day fit for bathing finds the luxuriant Corinna washing herself in proud Niobe’s tears, surrounded by the concentric punishment of the guiltless children; like the statues all around her, Corinna too is transfixed by the gods’ punitive, prismatic arrows, in a sense becoming the latest Niobid. Corinna’s garden is thus an allusive graveyard, a memento mori.</p>
         <p>But it is also an Edenic playground, custom built for a sexual encounter. Chapman emphasizes the anamorphic nature of Niobe’s statue: indeed, the more we stare, the less the fountain resolves itself into a monitory allusion, until it no longer appears to weep at all.<sup>50</sup> Fifty lines before Ovid enters his own <italic>Banquet</italic>, Chapman’s narrator treats the reader to a sneak preview of Corinna’s bath in this very fountain: <disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>In a loose robe of Tynsell foorth she came,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Nothing but it betwixt her nakednes</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>And enuious light. The downward-burning flame,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Of her rich hayre did threaten new accesse,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Of ventrous <italic>Phaeton</italic> to scorch the fields:</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>And thus to bathing came our Poets Goddesse,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Her handmaides bearing all things pleasure yeelds</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>To such a seruice; Odors most delighted,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>And purest linnen which her lookes had whited.</verse-line>
                  <attrib>(7)</attrib>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>There is plenty here to uphold negative readings of the <italic>Banquet</italic>. The “threat” of Phaethon’s catastrophic descent, for example, overcompensates for the titillation of the stanza’s opening image, as if the narrator is hoping to forestall or correct the reader’s arousal, or his own. The allusion assigns Corinna a moral vector askew from her straightforward progress into the garden. As Darryl Gless notes, “She is associated…with Phaeton, whose Niobe-like presumption destroyed his own life and scorched large expanses of the world beside. The fine image of her hair, a ‘downward-burning flame,’ not only adumbrates Ovid’s descent from higher to lower senses; it also extends the admonitory symbolism of the setting, for such flames conventionally symbolize death—and in Roman funerary symbolism, Amor himself often leans against the inverted torch.”<sup>51</sup> Seemingly in league with Augustus, then, the narrator’s allusion “extends the admonitory symbolism of the setting,” but the intended beneficiaries of these extensive warnings remain unclear. Whom, exactly, does Corinna’s hair threaten: Ovid, who has yet to be introduced; Corinna, whose bath was meant to be private; or the narrator, who just now gawked at her nearly naked body? That “such flames conventionally symbolize death” may be less instrumental to the interpretation of these lines than our recognition that the narrator has arrived prematurely at his allusive image for global mortality—that the “funerary symbolism” could easily have waited until after our peep into the princess’s boudoir. Phaethon aside, the narrator seems to be enjoying himself—the reader too, perhaps—as he anticipates those tantalizing “Odors most delighted,” and indulges in the conceit of the “purest linnen…whited” by Corinna’s superlative beauty.</p>
         <p>We lose sight of that linen in the following stanza, however, as Corinna disrobes: <disp-quote>
               <verse-group>
                  <verse-line>Then cast she off her robe, and stood vpright,</verse-line>

                  <verse-line>Or as that heauen cast off it selfe, and showde</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Heauens vpper light, to which the brightest day</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Is but a black and melancholy shroude:</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Or as when <italic>Venus</italic> striu’d for soueraine sway</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>Of charmfull beautie, in yong Troyes desire,</verse-line>
                  <verse-line>So stood <italic>Corynna</italic> vanishing her tire.</verse-line>
                  <attrib>(8)</attrib>
               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote> Chapman’s manic narrator patterns forth with repeated similes the meteoric ascent of the Neoplatonic lover, only to allusively diagram his precipitous fall to an earth subjugated by sensuality. The first line is literal narration, and immediately provocative, but the next sublimates the image to the clouds; the lightning that felled Phaethon no longer punishes presumption but now figures more-than-earthly beauty. The next line climbs even higher—not to the beauty of the terrestrial atmosphere but to the beauty of light itself, first creation of heaven. Yet the following line takes us past our sensual eye to the prime heaven beyond the light we perceive every day, at which point a disastrous enjambment—“to which the brightest day / Is but a black and melancholy shroude”—plunges us into the negative side of the simile, swats us out of the sky like Phaethon. The brooding narrator finally relates Corinna to the Venus of Paris’s Judgment, the origin of Troy’s fall. From the flight to heaven’s heaven we are thrown down to an earth as desolate as Phaethon left it. But the final line—“So stood <italic>Corynna</italic> vanishing her tire”—bounces us right back into the poem’s <italic>locus amœnus</italic>, reverting from epic simile to high-brow pornography, capturing Corinna once again in dishabille, evoking both the body and the ghost, the “purest linnen” and the “vanishing tire.”</p>
         <p>Neither stanza, then, traces any simple rising/falling motion of sensual indulgence ending in remorse. On the contrary, both stanzas begin with sensual indulgence, interrupted in each case by a transitory reservation—delivered via mythological (indeed Ovidian) allusions—but both then emblematize a return to the original sensuality. In other words, the <italic>Banquet</italic> is erotic not because it features Ovid’s individual progression up or down the ladder of the senses but because the reader may shoot up and down the same ladder repeatedly, guided and encouraged by a narrator attuned to the rhythms of desire—even before Ovid appears. Hence, as the following stanzas introduce the familiar pastoral catalog of flowers,<sup>52</sup> which “cling about this Natures naked Iem [gem, i.e., Corinna], / To taste her sweetes, as Bees doe swarme on them” (10.8–9), an entire community of voyeuristic readers is figured metaleptically at one remove from Corinna herself—we are like the bees swarming on the flowers, which cling to her body to “taste her sweets.” As if to correct for this unauthorized foretaste—after all, this is to be Ovid’s banquet—the narrator returns his gaze to Caesar’s stone Niobe and her massacred children, but by now Corinna’s erotic presence has rendered the sensual inextricable from the monitory: <disp-quote>

               </verse-group>
            </disp-quote>Bathing her breasts in Niobe’s tears, Corinna completes her necrophiliac striptease, yet the <italic>Banquet</italic> has only just begun; her bath produces, literally and immediately, a poem within a poem promising the regeneration of the garden around her—the inset “Song of <sc>Corynna</sc>,” which will also invite and ignite Ovid, sense by sense.<sup>53</sup> Corinna’s conceit—that her own voice’s “vitall sounde” might reinstill life and joy to the petrified and lachrymose Niobe—expresses in microcosm the central conceit of <italic>Ovids Banquet of Sence</italic>: that “dead” forms may be reanimated, and “lost soules” rehabilitated through an allusive poetry at once monitory and sensual.</p>
         <p>Corinna’s song, of course, cannot “cheer” Niobe, however much it charms Ovid, and insofar as “her voyces vitall sounde” falls on stony ears, the <italic>Banquet</italic>’s opening sequence once again presupposes the failure of any quixotic effort on Chapman’s part to reform or redeem the <italic>praeceptor amoris</italic> and his petrified myths. Yet the poet has been performing just such a revitalization throughout this intricately allusive passage, employing an intertextual technique far more sophisticated than his surreptitious consultation of Conti for the previous year’s <italic>Shadow of Night</italic>. Hence, much as Corinna’s unlikely agnomen of “Romaine <italic>Phoebe</italic>” momentarily transforms history’s lascivious Julia Augusta into the petrarchan equivalent of chaste Diana/Cynthia, so Chapman’s introduction of the flower catalog as “A soft enflowered banck…/Of <italic>Chloris</italic> ensignes” (9.1–2) rejuvenates the Roman goddess Flora by referring us to her innocent, vernal manifestation. The name Chloris, after all, unequivocally evokes the virginal nymph, whose apotheosis into the goddess of flowers occurred only after her rape by Zephyrus, the west wind.<sup>54</sup> Best known from Botticelli’s allegorical depiction in the <italic>Primavera</italic>, Chloris’s story is recounted most evocatively by Ovid in the <italic>Fasti</italic>, where Flora, recalling her original identity, declares, “Chloris eram, quae Flora vocor…/ Chloris eram, nymphe campi felicis” (I who now am called Flora was formerly Chloris…Chloris I was, a nymph of the happy fields).<sup>55</sup> Ovid literally underwrites Chapman’s reassuring, retroactive transition from the ruins of Troy to a virginal springtime, for the otherwise dependable Conti nowhere discusses Flora’s Greek alter ego.<sup>56</sup>
         </p>
         <p>Conti does, however, refer to another Chloris: one of only three children of Niobe to survive the massacre, according to the Greek geographer Pausanias’s alternative version of the myth.<sup>57</sup> To some extent, Chapman can here be observed reproducing the illusory learning of the <italic>Shadow</italic>’s annotations and slighting Ovid, as he plucks the name of the obscure survivor from a passage of the <italic>Mythologiae</italic> otherwise deeply indebted to Ovid’s more famous and less merciful account of the Niobids’ demise. But Augustus’s tableau presents an allusive paradox: namely, that it only serves its monitory purpose insofar as it refers exclusively to Ovid’s version of the massacre. As Conti notes, “Ovid insists that fourteen children were killed”—while the more recondite Greek source here offers the only escape route to be found. That Chapman’s draconic emperor should thus invoke an Ovidian myth even as he castigates the moral errancy it signifies again recalls the earlier poem’s convolutions—specifically, the invocation of excluded myths in the “Hymnus in Cynthiam.” The key distinction, however, lies in the unprecedented intertextual options now left to the <italic>Banquet</italic>’s readers: condemn the lovers by authorizing Ovid’s own myth, or call Conti’s Pausanias to witness and permit Corinna at least an appeal. And this conundrum cannot be blamed on Chapman’s reconstituted Ovid, who has yet to enter the poem’s allusively overpopulated garden.</p>
         <p>Such local allusive gestures as Flora’s nominal rejuvenation into Chloris can hardly redeem the ghosts of the <italic>Banquet</italic> fully or permanently any more than Chapman (or his readers) can be exempted from voyeuristic complicity in this erotic vision by appealing to the narrator’s prudent or sententious pronouncements.<sup>58</sup> Yet precisely because Chapman neglects or refuses to specify the provenance of the vast majority of the <italic>Banquet</italic>’s allusions—in stark contrast to his pointed annotations to the <italic>Shadow of Night</italic>—he allows for the critical accumulation of mediating intertexts. As he departs from the illusory encyclopedic range of the <italic>Shadow</italic>, and subtly imbricates his sources in the <italic>Banquet</italic>, Chapman liberates his readers from the earlier poem’s reductively anti-Ovidian stance.</p>
         <p>By incorporating Ovid without fully embracing the Roman poet’s elegiac or mythographic personae, Chapman signals his own maturation, aligning himself with the established, authoritative figures of Elizabethan literary culture. He emulates Sidney—who had allowed Ovid an audience while reserving judgment in <italic>The Defence</italic>—and Spenser, who had attempted a meticulous balance between Christian, Virgilian, and Ovidian intertexts in the 1590 <italic>Faerie Queene</italic>. At the same time, Chapman implies a corresponding distance between his own verse and that of rival upstarts like Marlowe or Shakespeare, who would rebrand Ovidian <italic>imitatio</italic> unscrupulously.</p>
         <p>However successfully the <italic>Shadow of Night</italic> and <italic>Ovids Banquet of Sence</italic>, taken together, had confined such “Artizans of thunder” to “errors hell,”<sup>59</sup> and however deftly Chapman had both reformed and reinvigorated Ovid—as Davies’s complementary sonnets bore witness—Chapman was not yet finished engaging the Ovidian vogue. He returned to the issue three years later in his continuation of Marlowe’s <italic>Hero and Leander</italic>, in a sense executing on the corpus of Marlowe the suspended sentence meted out to the <italic>Banquet</italic>’s ghost of Ovid. With regard to Chapman’s career, then, the <italic>Banquet</italic> proved a work in progress—neither a condemnation nor an exoneration of Ovid but rather a deferral of judgment. In the larger literary-historical context of early modern Ovidianism, however, <italic>Ovids Banquet of Sence</italic>—as a corrective revision of the <italic>Shadow of Night</italic>—presents us with the opportunity to observe the evolution of Ovid’s cultural status beyond the immediate influence of his textual corpus, and equally beyond the flat, satirical rejection of his erotic and mythographic styles. Half-disgusted, half-enraptured by Ovid, Chapman in his early poems held a mirror to his contemporary literary culture in all its complexity.</p>
