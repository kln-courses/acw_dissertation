Bio Science ANTHROPOMORPHISM In the analysis of animal behavior we have been strongly conditioned to avoid anthropomorphism as a cardinal sin against scientific standards. This avoidance conditioning implies that some behavioral capabilities we might be tempted to identify in animals are, in a nontrivial sense, uniquely human. But as more has been learned about animal behavior the task of confidently designating which human attributes cannot possibly exist in other species has become more and more challenging. Conceptual thinking seemed at one time to be absent in any species other than ourselves, but this view is increasingly difficult to maintain. For example, Rohles and Devine (1967) have taught the concept of middleness to chimpanzees and rhesus monkeys. Tool use, and later the construction of tools, were once thought to be impossible for animals, but both have now been demonstrated (Beck 1975). Self-awareness is widely believed to be a unique human attribute, although sensory input from the animal's own body is abundantly available. Self-awareness must thus be taken to involve the concept of "selfness" rather than simply an abundance of sensory input from one's own body. Gallup (1970, 1975), however, found that a chimpanzee familiar with plane mirrors will immediately reach to the right spot on its forehead as though trying to remove a smudge of dye placed there under anesthesia when, after recovery, it is first given an opportunity to view itself in a mirror. Since the mirror image seems to be recognized as a representation of the animal's own body, Gallup interpreted this kind of behavior as an operational definition of self-awareness. Language and symbolic thought have remained until quite recently as apparently "safe" strongholds of human uniqueness. But honeybees communicate by symbolic dances the desirability and location of several different kinds of objects that are remote from the immediate stimulus situation (Frisch 1967, Gould 1975). In the case of swarming bees, the same individual may act alternately as sender and receiver, and the swarm reaches a consensus through the competitive exchange of such imperative messages before flying off together to a new location (Lindauer 1971). Captive chimpanzees, beginning with the famous pioneer Washoe, have learned to use vocabularies of more than 100 signals, either gestures adapted from the sign language used by the human deaf or arbitrary mechanical symbols. These gestures or symbols are used for all intents and purposes as words, and have been combined in a modestly creative fashion into new and meaningful combinations (Gardner and Gardner 1975, Premack 1976, Rumbaugh 1977). Although there is no evidence that animal communication or conceptual thinking remotely approaches the level of complexity and versatility characteristic of our species, it is becoming more difficult to establish clearly defined qualitative criteria of human uniqueness with respect to language. Human thinking and language have been widely held to be so closely linked that neither can occur without the other. To the extent that this argument is valid, I believe that flexible communication behavior by other species becomes correspond- ingly persuasive evidence that they too experience at least simple thoughts (Griffin 1976). This leads us back to anthropomorphism. Some have argued that it is foolishly anthropomorphic to suppose that even Great Apes might know what they are doing or have conscious intentions. But this view depends implicitly on a prior assumption that these attributes are in fact unique to our species. To the extent that this kind of absolute judgment is questionable, so is the taboo against anything that might sound July 1977 445</page><page sequence="2">like anthropomorphism. Strictly speaking anthropomorphism is necessarily erroneous only when applied to attributes that are unquestionably unique to Homo sapiens. These considerations do not automatically eliminate the possibility of error in interpreting animal behavior. They simply suggest that the rigid exclusion of all hypotheses that involve awareness, intention, or consciousness in animals may be unjustified. As theories are developed and tested to account for the behavior of animals, it may turn out to be more parsimonious and considerably more fruitful to consider the possibility that evolutionary continuity applies not only to structure and function but also to cognition.
