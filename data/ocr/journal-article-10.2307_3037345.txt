This book is a vivid and important sequel to Good- all's earlier popular story of the Gombe chimpan- zees, In the Shadow of Man (Houghton Mifflin, Bos- ton, 1971). It can and should be read on several levels. As a historical sequel, it brings us up to date on the sagas of the individual chimpanzees we met earlier, how they have lived their lives and the many ways in which they died. Goodall's own life during these years is also portrayed. I suspect most readers' interest will be captured by these aspects, as it would by any good tale of friends and families. In the light of current interest in lifetime reproductive success in long-lived animals, how- ever, this history holds much for the evolutionists and ecologists among the readership. Despite a relatively low number of chimpanzees, dramatic differences in survival and reproductive success among families are obvious, and the degree to which social, not "environmental" forces are behind the many deaths is striking. The part that social bonds (and their loss) play both in the survival of pre- adults and in the success of aspiring status seekers is vividly portrayed. This latest book also reflects Goodall's changed interpretation of events in the chimpanzee com- munity, such as the strong community-level ag- gression and killing of the Kasakela males by Ka- lande males, former community members. Earlier it seemed hard to accept the idea that the chimpan- zees were capable of such acts, but these are re- ported as calculated aggression. Our picture of chim- panzee life is now more rounded. Goodall nods to current sociobiological theory in the form of brief allusions to kin selection and familial bonds, al- though she neglects to present any formal discus- sion of the weakness of this explanation for the many social bonds between unrelated individuals, both male alliances and female "friendships." Finally, the book clearly speaks to the issues of animal cognition and animal rights. The contribu- tion of chimpanzee studies to the science of animal behavior is nowhere clearer than in the area of animal cognition. Cognitive ethologists are cur- rently trying to define their field as well as develop a rigorous methodology. In this climate, Goodall's book could be subject to sharp criticism for its un- apologetic anthropomorphism in attributing emo- tional content and motivation to the lives of the chimps. On the other hand, I found myself asking how one could indeed study the behavior of these animals without empathy as a tool or guide. Their overt behaviors are simply not to be explained by immediate events before or after an interaction. The explanation and the complexity of their be- havior lies in the connection of that interaction to a history of events, long past and in the future. This raises the problem of knowing what data from the past to review and what to look for in the future. Empathy-putting ourselves in a chimpanzee's nest, so to speak-may be our most efficient tool, how- ever dangerous it may seem to "objectivity." Not surprisingly, therefore, chimp cognition and its relation to their potential for suffering and misuse by humans is developed as a strong theme through- out this book. Against the backdrop of this very personal account of individual chimpanzees, the author's plea for their humane treatment and re- strictions on their use in laboratories is particularly effective. In summary, I recommend this book to anyone interested in animal behavior in the laboratory or field. It is worth a careful and thoughtful reading, and as narrative it is hard to put down. ANNE B.
