Special mention should be made of the "new serials list" and the "cited serials list" which include OCLC numbers, facilitating subscription to a new title or interlibrary loan (ILL staff may be kept in perpetual motion thanks to this bibliography!), as well as the section on methodology, "Theory and Practice of African Art Studies," a category often lack- ing in subject bibliographies.

Although the gutters are fairly generous, which should allow library binding when the volume has become worn from heavy use, the option of a cloth binding for future volumes would be wel- come, given that the bibliography is of perma- nent research value. Li L'ART AFRICAIN CONTEMPORAIN/CONTEMPO- RARY AFRICAN ART: GUIDE Second Edition Nicole Guez Association Afrique en Creation, Paris, 1996. Text in French and English. 421 pp. $50 softcover. Reviewed by Olu Oguibe When Nicole Guez traveled around in 1991 with the idea of compiling a directory of con- temporary African artists and art institutions, it was not certain what the result would be, nor was it clear how indispensable it would become to many around the world who have followed the example set by a handful several decades ago to open up to Africa's contempo- rary art and artists. The first edition of the directory, issued in 1992 by the Association Dialogue entre les Cultures, quickly became an invaluable little companion-never mind that it could not avoid the curse of itinerant artists and ever changing addresses that con- signed some of the information to the bin even before the publication ever appeared. Modest as the effort was, it went a long way toward invalidating that chronic excuse with which the lazy and the unwilling have justified their reluctance to embrace the breadth of contemporary African art: the plea that we know little or nothing at all about it. The Guide also provided information on artists living abroad, and in doing so remind- ed those who instinctively look only to the continent for African artists that we live in a moment in history when identity is not deter- mined by location; just as artists from other regions of the world do not lose their identi- ties through expatriation, African artists do not become any less African by living in France or the United States. Critics, collectors, curators all had something they could refer to with ease in their search for more information on artists and useful contacts. In the years that followed, Guez's Guide, together with the image-oriented Revue Noire and eventually the journal Nka, has changed much of what we know and how we ap- proach a subject that remains an embarrassing Achilles' heel for many in the field of African art. Not only have we seen more work, thanks to our improved ability to connect with artists, we have also begun to reconcile our- selves to the reality of artists that no longer fit long-standing expectations. With time, also, more of the information in the first edition of the Guide became obsolete, and the need for an update grew. The long- awaited second edition has finally appeared. It is larger than the first, with information on many more artists, galleries, cultural founda- tions and institutions, and leading names in contemporary African-art scholarship. In addition to its larger size, the second edition also has a detailed index, a most valuable improvement on the first. The user-friendly design and arrangement are retained, too. The second edition is not all improve- ment, however. Plowing through the wealth of artists' addresses and other information, one quickly discovers significant potholes and omissions. A good deal of the data is useless, comprising "artists" without prac- tice, galleries long shut down, and inaccurate institutional addresses. The reason for this, which is the singular, unforgivable short- coming of the compilation, is that very little of the information was cross-checked and verified. One embarrassing example: under museums and institutions interested in con- temporary African art in the United States, the Museum of African Art in New York is listed twice, first under its present name and address, and then under its previous name, the Center for African Arts. While one cannot deny the difficulty of keeping up with african arts winter 1997 changes or following up on every bit of information, this is one revealing instance of rather sloppy work that could confuse users, and cost a lot in inaccurately directed contact attempts. Surely such slips could be avoided, and one hopes that in the future more time will be taken to make subsequent editions of the Guide more reliable. OL SMASHING POTS Works of Clay from Africa Nigel Barley Smithsonian Institution Press, Washington D.C., 1994. 176 pp., 50 b/w &amp; 75 color illustrations, notes, bibliography, index. $29.95 softcover. Reviewed by Marla C. Berns My copy of this book, published for the Trustees of the British Museum by the British Museum Press, is identical in every way to the American version published by the Smithsonian except for the subtitle, which substitutes "Feats of Clay" for "Works of Clay." This alteration suggests that the pub- lisher believed that the intended market for this lavishly illustrated volume-the average American reader-is unlikely to get Nigel Barley's clever punning. Ironically, it is the double meaning of "smashing" that would be more elusive to Americans, who, unaware of the English expression, might wonder about the destructive impulses of Africans toward their pots. Then again, perhaps mar- keting strategists considered that produc- tively provocative. Smashing Pots was published to coincide with a major exhibition at the Museum of Mankind (the Ethnography Department of the British Museum) organized by its Assistant Keeper, Barley. The book is based on the museum's pottery collections, and as the author notes, its contents chronicle that insti- tution's long-term commitment to collecting and exhibiting ceramics. The geographic dis- tribution of the holdings also parallels Britain's historical relationship with Africa, in both the colonial and postcolonial eras. As a successor to W. Fagg and J. Picton's The Potter's Art in Africa (1970), a much briefer study still cited as a primary resource on the subject, Smashing Pots shows how far we have come in understanding the role of pots in African life and thought. It clearly demon- strates, too, what we've come to expect in a catalogue/book accompanying a major exhi- bition of African art. Smashing Pots presents three concurrent narratives about "works of clay from Africa." First, in ten chapters Barley provides a sweep- ing story of the production, use, and meanings of largely nonfigurative ceramics. His exam- ples encompass domestic and some ritual wares, produced from the north to the south and the west to the east. Despite choosing to approach the subject so globally, Barley warns, in the book's introduction: "No single book 91</page><page sequence="2">can comprehensively survey pottery over such a vast and ethnographically diverse area as Africa." But he has done so anyway, drawing heavily on the published literature as well as on his own fieldwork, particularly among the Dowayo of Cameroon. Although his discus- sion addresses many of the peoples and pot- tery types represented in the collections of the Museum of Mankind, the majority of exam- ples cited in the text are held elsewhere. A second narrative evolves out of a suc- cession of black-and-white reproductions (of both objects and field photographs) that run continuously with the text, illustrating points raised in the discussion and serving as a way to represent vessel types not included in the collection. Lengthy captions explain specific vessel types or the field photographs that con- textualize them. Unfortunately, none of the latter are dated to provide historical reference; the acquisition dates in the Museum's object identification numbers provide us only with a terminus ad quem. I find the absence of dates for field photos not only frustrating but sur- prising, given the concern expressed in Barley's own admission that writing on such a vast subject makes it difficult to avoid "an almost nineteenth-century disregard for time and place" (p. 17). A third narrative can be followed in the sequence of color plates-beautiful and plen- tiful, full or even double page-reproducing vessels in the collection. They, too, are ac- companied by informative captions detailing distinctive features, such as methods of deco- ration or contexts of use. However, it is impossible to discern a consistent strategy in their placement and progression relative to the text. The plates are not numbered and hence the images are not referenced in the text, so even when Barley discusses a particu- lar pot type illustrated, the book's structure does not help the reader make the connection. While one might argue that such a strategy offers a postmodern experience, if the intend- ed readership is a general rather than a spe- cialist one, the book falls short of its potential as a resource on the subject. A noteworthy feature of Smashing Pots is its inclusion of North Africa within its sweep: this is the first book on African ceramics to include examples from the entire continent. Common generalizations about sub-Saharan African pottery (typically made by women, hand-built, unglazed, fired in open pits at low temperatures) do not hold true in the north (where pottery tends to be wheel-built by men, glazed, and kiln-fired). Moreover, the latter region's elegant calligraphic decoration and certain favored color schemes-like a white clay body with black decoration-are rarely seen south of the Sahara. Nevertheless, there are certain features of shape, finish, and decoration that do cross traditional bound- aries and suggest the kinds of historical inter- action or movement of ideas and objects across the desert in both directions. Not to be forgotten are the clear correlations between certain wares made by North African peoples, like the Berber of Algeria, and traditions asso- ciated with the Mediterranean Basin. 92 While the potential certainly exists to do so, Barley does not provide much compara- tive analysis of pottery traditions, either with- in the continent or beyond. No matter how progressive and worthwhile it may be to treat Africa as a "continent," I would maintain that there is also an obligation, especially in such a broad survey, to at least suggest why regional differences or correspondences exist due to, for example, religious systems, gender prohi- bitions, or economic factors. More back- ground on the historical, cultural, and social realities underlying the practice of making and using pottery would have established a better basis for situating and understanding the many culture-specific examples Barley presents throughout the volume. If, however, one looks at the book's totali- ty-its text and its pictures-Smashing Pots provides one of the most comprehensive and analytically ambitious views of pottery in Africa to date. Too many publications on the subject have dealt slavishly only with issues of technology and/or typology. This volume addresses in some depth the fascinating subject of pots as instruments of social thought-as "models for thinking about the human body, the seasons of the year, processes of procre- ation and reincarnation." Barley thus fleshes out the arguments he presented in his oft-cited 1984 article, "Placing the West African Potter." There he proposed that the pottery-making process, with its ritual implications, provides an essential model of transformation and development in the human sphere. Barley elaborates on this argument in Smashing Pots, beginning with a chapter on "Potters and the Earth," which addresses the intriguing meta- phoric parallels between potting and procre- ation. This chapter leads directly to another on the roles of men and women in making pottery, which is too brief and restricted in its examples to do justice to its subject. Barley chooses to emphasize the closed caste system operative in certain regions-like northern Cameroon, the home of the Dowayo-where men are smiths and women are potters. As was the case in his 1984 article, he concludes here that it may be the potter who is more important a "source of rites that change human beings than [is] her husband" (p. 63), challenging the prevailing positions taken on the subject. It is too bad this book went to press before the publication of Eugenia Herbert's Iron, Gender, and Power (1993), which takes issue with some of Barley's conclusions and provides a much fuller dis- cussion of the subjects of gender and smithing versus potting. In my view, the two most interesting chapters are "The Role of Pots" and "Vessels of Spirit." The first emphasizes that pottery functions in more than one way, whether its main purpose is domestic (such as cooking, storing, carrying) or ritual (containing spirits). Its roles are often multiple, sometimes even moving fluidly between the domestic and the ritual spheres. Barley writes about pots made by the Sirak, Senufo, and Bini (for the deity Olokun), among others; the black-and-white reproductions show a clay drum by the Fon, love charms by the Twa, and a Hausa inkwell; african arts winter 1997 and the color plates extend the discussion to include such objects as a Northern Nigerian pot-stand, a Moroccan tagine dish, and a ves- sel by Ladi Kwali (wheel-thrown, glazed, and kiln-fired in Abuja, Northern Nigeria). The chapter on "Vessels of Spirit" address- es why it is that pots function so well as con- tainers for spirits. Barley begins by showing how the names for parts of the vessel are iden- tical to those for parts of the human body: mouth, neck, body, foot. If spirits are con- ceived in human terms, then pots, which are also anthropomorphic, serve as appropriate repositories for these forces. Barley returns here to his "model of transformation," where the very way in which clay "becomes" ceram- ic through firing provides a metaphor for change, and the process of change is often facilitated by appeals to spirits. Pots and women are frequently equated, and Barley provides a number of instances in which the state of a pot becomes an indicator of what may happen to a person, especially a woman. For example, an unused, perfect Shona pot signals that a Shona bride arrives at her hus- band's home "untouched." The ways people handle or interact with ceramic vessels be- come symbolic equivalents of actual behavior. It is the potential for vessels to operate at this symbolic level and to become such potent sig- nifiers of change or transformation that makes them "vessels of spirit." Barley states in the introduction that he will only deal incidentally with figurative ceramics, as the subject "raises questions that place it outside the concerns of this book" (p. 17). In fact, figurative ceramics-at least the way I understand this designation-are men- tioned or illustrated as a part of the Museum of Mankind collection rather frequently. An entire chapter, "New Pots for Old," is dedicat- ed to the figurative vessels of Zaire, focusing on the famed Mangbetu wares and the Woyo pieces made by Voanya of Muba. It is unclear to me what questions "figura- tive ceramics" raise that are not germane to the arguments in this book, since such mater- ial also signifies how people think about their social and cultural worlds. If Barley is using the term to refer only to non-vessel forms- like sculpture from Nok, Ife, or the Chad basin-then he is the one making distinctions that seem arbitrary and problematic. It is not just that such ceramic heads or figures cannot "contain." The exclusion of these works from the discussion may have more to do with the art/craft divide, which Barley attempts else- where in the book to bridge. In his chapter on "Decoration and Innovation" he presents data to support his claim that pottery is more than just "craft," since its production is not ruled exclusively by the limitations of following "tradition." On the other hand, he writes that African potters also rarely indulge in "free- wheeling artistic inspiration" (p. 121). Barley's conclusions do not derive from interpreting the remarkable variations and creativity exhibited by the vessels themselves. Instead, his arguments come from reiterating the fact that pots function as "vessels of spir- it" or in ways that allow them to serve recog-</page><page sequence="3">nizably in the ritual sphere. Although ritual codes and traditions may dictate the degree of innovation any artist may demonstrate in working with clay, these arguments do not tap the rich sources and motivations for the visual systems that have evolved across the continent. It is likely that the figurative ceram- ic sculpture we know from Africa has evolved out of the same body of meanings and moti- vations that inspired the transformation of clay into its many shapes, sizes, and surfaces. Barley's voice is clearly that of the anthro- pologist, as there is far greater discussion in this volume about the role of pots-symbolic and otherwise-than there is about their qual- ities of form. Those looking for detailed dis- cussions about aesthetics or about the artistic impact of and visual surprise in ceramic art will be disappointed. Even in the postscript, "Pots as Feats of Clay," the focus is on pot- tery's symbolic value, going so far as to sug- gest that the non-material forces vessels can "contain" are more significant than their very materiality. Although Barley gives pottery (domestic as well as ritual) the place it deserves as a product of ideological expres- sion and intention, it is disturbing that he bestows minimal attention on the majority of vessels illustrated in the book-those that clearly reflect aesthetic intention and innova- tion. Just browsing among the color plates provides ample evidence of artistic achieve- ment. Why pots are, after all, so "smashing" must be about something other than looking past their physicality to use or symbolism. Barley reiterates the straightforward claim many of us have heard: making pots better to look at makes them better to use or even bet- ter to "think." Nevertheless, little is offered here to enlighten us as to how the specific ways they look also makes this true. This weakness or bias in the text is evident even in those chapters seemingly devoted to aspects of form and decoration, like one on "Motifs, Motivation and Motives." As the title might suggest, it is less about programs of decoration themselves than it is about the rationales or intentions behind them. I whole- heartedly agree that it is often impossible to decode or understand the way one category of object is decorated without looking at oth- ers that constitute a group's visual system- and Barley provides several compelling examples of how the ornamentation on pot- tery is closely related to that of the body. Yet, there is little to explain, in the final analysis, why pots are made and decorated in such an astonishing variety of ways. The impulse to embellish is not always about providing some visual equivalent of the way social relations are understood; the rationales must be more wide-ranging and complex. The search for beauty, for grace, for things satisfying to the eye or even the heart is certainly part of the urge to create, whether one is making a cook- ing pot or a vessel for a shrine. Moreover, to say that long-established codes and vocabu- laries largely direct and restrict the women and men of particular societies to create is insufficient. There have always been those leading the way in developing vocabularies and qualities of form, achieving the means to exploit the expressive possibilities of clay. These reservations aside, Barley has brought together a vast array of ethnographic examples to indicate the remarkable power of pots in African life and thought. In chapter after chap- ter he demonstrates how pottery works to underscore the basic transitions in human life, from birth to adulthood to death. It is not sim- ply the presence of the ceramic object that sig- nals such transformations but also the process of its production that provides the crucial metaphor for change. What the disjunction between images and written text underscores is how little we know about many of the pieces collected for the Museum of Mankind. Much more has been written about the contexts in notes KASFIR: Notes, from page 9 1. There are no plans for "Miscast" to travel abroad. The ac- companying book of essays is available from Clarke's Bookshop, 211 Long Street, Cape Town ($53 plus shipping). 2. Identity politics often centers on names and naming. At present, most of the scholarly community (including muse- ums) continue to use the term "San," while several groups of the San-speaking people themselves, as well as about half the writers in the Miscast collection of essays, have begun to use the older, "unscientific" term "Bushman" to replace "San," either for political reasons (the San speakers) or to distance themselves from aspects of "San" anthropological or linguistic discourse (the scholars). In his speech (part of the South African National Gallery's handout for "Miscast"), /aiqab Kruiper refers to his people as the "/homeni Bush- men," thereby appropriating and naturalizing the colonial label, while his statement is titled (by the Gallery ) "on behalf of the /homeni San of the Southern Kalahari." The following quotation appears on page 338 of the book Miscast: "The Ju/'hoan Peoples' Organisation has rejected the word 'San' and seeks to ennoble the previously pejorative term 'Bushman.' " On the other hand, the National Gallery cura- torial staff have sought to distance themselves from what they consider the term's "racist and gendered overtones" (Emma Bedford, pers. com., Oct. 29, 1996). Thus, while the subtitle of the book is "Negotiating the Presence of the Bushmen," the subtitle of the exhibition is "Negotiating Khoisan History and Culture." I have tried to bridge this semantic problem and neutralize the rhetorical impact of "Bushman" and "San" by using the two terms interchangeably here. 3. The book is much wider ranging, with essays covering the entire span of Boer-Bushman history from the eighteenth cen- tury up to the present. 4.

Several of the pictures have since been purchased by the National Gallery for its permanent collection (Emma Bedford, pers. com., Oct. 29,1996). 7. Actual San trophy heads do exist, such as those in the Anatomy Department at Edinburgh University, Cambridge University, and the British Museum of Natural History (see Alan G. Morris, "Trophy Skulls, Museums and the San" in Miscast: Negotiating the Presence of the Bushmen, ed. Pippa Skotnes, 1996, p. 73), but the Board of Trustees of the National Gallery ruled against the display of any human remains (Emma Bedford, pers. com., July 26 and Oct. 29, 1996). 8. These have now been widely shown outside South Africa, including the Dusable Museum in Chicago (1995) and Iwalewa Haus in Bayreuth (1994) as well as London, Finland, Poland, and, at home, the Johannesburg Biennale. 9. This is an oversimplification in that the !Xu and Khwe groups are quite different from each other. Incidentally, none of these people have followed a hunter-gatherer life style. Many !Xu came originally from central Angola, where they had lived as cultivators and stock farmers; Khwe came from southeastern Angola, living also as cultivators and as cattle- keepers. Both had in different ways been caught up in the wars of liberation in the region, fighting first for the Portuguese and later being recruited for the South African Defense Forces. Among other things this has made them unpopular with ANC politicians in the Schmidtsdrift area, further eroding the possibilities of their future economic well- being.

Smashing Pots teaches us about the power of clay and about what Barley calls the "pot- ting image" in African thought, the ways fired clay containers help people conceptualize the nature and terms of their existence. At the same time, this beautiful publication is also a visual feast of ceramic works made by peo- ples across the continent. This ambitious com- pilation has something for everyone and is to be commended for all it offers us through its three concurrent narratives; nevertheless, more certainly remains to be said about "feats of clay from Africa."

MACMILLAN: Notes, from page 31 [This article was accepted for publication in September 1996.] 1. Most of the information on Stephen Kappata's life comes from an extensive interview with him conducted on April 26, 1991, in Lusaka. This has been supplemented by numerous other conversations. I am very grateful to the artist for his cooperation. He read through a draft of this article, but his comments were confined to points of factual detail. While always willing to talk about his life, he is reluctant to talk about his art, clearly believing that it speaks for itself. I am also grateful to Ruth Bush, formerly director of the Mpapa Gallery, Lusaka, for help and encouragement in my early work on this topic. Sadly, the Mpapa Gallery closed in 1996. 2. The Nyasas were from what is now Malawi and was then part of the Federation of Rhodesia and Nyasaland. 3. The artist himself is a compulsive decorator. The walls of his house are painted with pictures-to make it impossible for visitors to cajole him into selling them. 4. Interview with Anna-Lise Clausen, Lusaka, November 26, 1986. 5. It was shown in London in 1990 at both the "Focus on Zambia" exhibition at the Commonwealth Institute and at the "Frontline Africa" exhibition, as well as at the Glasgow "Mayfest" exhibition in the same year. Further recognition came with a one-man exhibition at the Riverside Gallery at the Royal Festival Hall, London, in May 1991, which was very well received. Since then Kappata's work has been shown in Gaborone, Beijing, Nairobi, Paris and, most recent- ly, Helsinki. 6. Although Kappata seems to have been unaware of these Zairean artists who also emerged in the 1970s, it is possible that the Zairean styles have a longer ancestry than Jewsiewicki sug- gests, and that Kappata may have picked up some of these ideas (such as the theme "Why was I born in this miserable world?") from his Zairean teacher in 1969. 7. The title of this painting was suggested by African Prole- tarians and Colonialism (1986), a book by the late Henry Meebelo, historian and UNIP cabinet minister, 8. The UNIP government banned recruitment from Barotse- land to the South African mines in 1966. That action led to its rejection by the people of the province in the elections of 1968, and it remains a grievance. References cited Gluckman, Max. 1971.
