Introduction This lavishly published book is the proceedings of the conference on "Archaeology in West Africa and the Maghreb" that took place at the Convention center of Quai Branly in Paris, on May 13-14, 2002. The con- ference was organized by the French Ministry of For- eign Affairs through its archaeology and scientific re- search division. Archaeologists from 15 countries met for two days of intensive and rich debates bracketed by official speeches of the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs Michel Barnier at the opening ceremony and Mrs. Elisabeth Beton Delegue and Mr. Yves Saint- Geours at the closing. The explicit aim of the confer- ence was to assess the current state of French and Francophone archaeological research in North and West Africa and to level the ground for future, hope- fully better, Franco-African collaborations. As far as Franco- African relations are concerned, and from the archaeological research perspective, this volume rep- resents an interesting evolution with a non-French as co-editor of the volume, a timid out-reach to West Af- rican Anglophone archaeologists. Summary The volume is organized in sections with varying number of contributions, excluding the preface and the conclusion that are parts of the "official wrappings" with the usual friendly words and expressions of great hopes. All the papers will be reviewed one way or the other but at this stage, it is important to summarize the book in big strokes. The book is made of 41 more or less extensive contributions. Section 2 (pp. 17-16), a round-table contains four papers that assess the some- time tense relationship between French and African researchers, from the Colonial period to the present. Section 3 (pp. 27-65) "historiographie approaches", with three papers presents the historical background of French/Francophone archaeological research. Sec- tion 4, "The First Humans"(p&gt;/?. 67-135 ), a misleading misnomer, is comprised of five articles. Section 5 , "Peo- ples and Societies" (pp. 137-213) is made of six con- tributions; Section 6, "Atlantic Littorals" (pp. 215- 245) has three articles, with the remaining section 6 (pp. 247-293) "The city and its hinterland", 7 (pp. 296-347) "The techniques", and 8 (pp. 349-399) "Sur- vey, rescue, and Management of Cultural Heritage", consisting each of five to six papers. A relatively im- portant bibliography (pp. 413-443) closes the volume. Thematic The conference on French and Francophone ar- chaeology in North and West Africa organized in 2002 by the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs took place within a specific juncture of French governmental policy. In its structure and theme the May 2002 con- ference is the continuation of an ancient tradition, that of periodic evaluation of French/Francophone ar- chaeological research, that was initiated by the French Ministry of Cooperation with the conference on "Ar- chaeology in Sub-Saharan Africa and Madagascar" that took place at Valbonne, in French Riviera on May 25-26, 1978. A number of recommendations were adopted as is generally the case in these kinds of meet- ings; for instance, to create sub-regional research projects in order to optimize resources and avoid re- Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 4 (1), 2006, pp. 171-182 171</page><page sequence="2">A.F.C. Holl dundancy; to conduct systematic survey and gener- ate archaeological atlases; to develop graduate and post-graduate archaeological training in Africa; to pub- lish a newsletter, " Nouvelles Archéologiques Africaines ", to initiate and strengthen researchers mobility; etc. ,etc.... Everyone was happy with the at- mosphere and seriousness of the debate and as should be expected, everything was forgotten once the last light of the conference auditorium was switched off. A few years later, a special issue of the journal Recherche, Pedagogie et Culture (September- December 1981) funded by the Ministry of Coopera- tion featured "L'Archeologie en Afrique" under the editorship of Professor Jean Devisse. It contained 16 contributions, an interview of a leading Africanist an- thropologist, and books reviews, all focused on Sub- Saharan Africa and Madagascar, a special issue re- viewed by the writer in 1982 (Holl 1982). Another evaluation took place in 1995-1996, initiated by the Science and Research Division of the Ministry of Co- operation with a number Africanist archaeologists [in- cluding the writer] appointed to craft new ideas and suggestions. The year long work of the commission contained in the report ended up in a drawer. After a number of failed attempts, the Ministry of Cooperation - formerly known as Ministry of Colo- nies - was wiped out of the record and its personnel transferred to the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, with the hope that Franco- African relationship will move away from the uneasy colonizer-colonized syndrome. That is the novelty represented by this volume; North Africa is for the first time dealt with within the same intellec- tual context as Sub-Saharan Africa. The book is di- vided into thematic parts instead of being a list of country-specific reports in an attempt to create intel- lectual bridge. A number of Anglophone archaeolo- gists from Ghana and Nigeria are among the contribu- tors, and an African scholar is co-editor of the volume. Is it effective or simply cosmetic? Time-discordances, multiple- voices dialogue ? Multiple voices dialogue is clearly an oxymoron; It is metaphorical and beside the playful turn of irony, the idea refers subliminally to France on one hand and Africa on the other. Bruno Delaye, the director of the International Cooperation and Development Division of the Ministry of Foreign affairs, opened the confer- ence with a generous speech, singling out the involve- ment of his service in support of archaeological re- search in Africa: "We, thus support 7 missions in Morroco, 8 in Tunisia, 1 in Libya, 1 in Chad, 1 in Burkina Faso, 1 in Mali, 1 in Mauritania, and 1 in Sen- egal", with a budget amounting to "approximately 215,000 Euros" in 2002." H. Bocoum, A. Bazzana, A. Ennabli, and J. Polet launched the debate by review- ing the changing relationships between France and Africa, North Africa and West Africa, calling for re- newed and more dynamic research ventures. H. Bocoum presents a paper on the difficult shift from colonial paternalism to research partnership. He referred to the "Colonial library" " that invented Africa and sets itself as a mandatory reference" (p. 19) and advocates the construction of mutually advantageous relationships that will serve but the truth. A. Bazzana looks at discordances and concordances in Moslem spaces from Andalusian and Maghrebian Mediterranean to the Niger Bend. He advocates a "renovated Africanism" and argued that past Europe/African difficult commu- nications do not have to hamper new convergences. He further suggests the development of a French ar- chaeology that develop strong collaborative ties with local researchers in countries they are involved in. A. Ennabli focuses on the relationships between North and West Africa in Antiquity. He claims that both zones remained inaccessible and unknown one to the other during the Carthaginian and Roman domination of North Africa. Finally, J. Polet develops a longitudi- nal perspective on Europe/Africa relationships as seen from Sub-Saharan Africa. He argues that "Colo- nized Africa was perceived, up to very recently, by lay persons and researchers alike, as receiver of the actual "world order", a continent at the receiving end that had not invented anything" (p. 25). The exchange of point of views is interesting but it takes some artistic license to call it dialogue. Historiographie aspects The historiographie section addresses three dis- tinct aspects of the development of French and Francophone archaeology in Africa. H. Bocoum deals with the institutional development of French archaeol- ogy in West Africa. It all started with the creation of a journal, the " Bulletin du Comité d'Etudes Historiques et Scientifiques de l'Afrique Occidentale Française " that was the official outlet for scholarly and other scientific queries in former French West Af- rican colonies. The lobbying for the creation of local research institutions culminated in 1936 with the offi- cial creation of the Institut Français d'Afrique Noire 172 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 4 (1), 2006</page><page sequence="3">Book Review Article: The Difficult Path of France / Africa Scientific Cooperation (IFAN) based on the 19th century model of museums of natural history. It was organized into a number of natu- ral and social science departments based at Dakar the capital of French West Africa, with the Museum of Af- rican Arts as the public outreach window. Smaller an- nexes were created in each of the colonies and sup- plied the head-quarter with scientific collections and annual reports. The department of protohistory and prehistory was responsible for archaeological research over a huge territory, amassing and "curating" collec- tions. It was systemically under-staffed and the ar- chaeologists in charge were most of the time over- whelmed. It was clearly a French institution for French researchers up to the 1960s. Bocoum refers to the con- stant attempt of French scholars to "monopolize" the field but they did not really develop a "style" or a school" (p. 35). M. Lenoir presents a short review of major recent French research and publications on An- tiquity of the Carthaginian world. Three aspects appear to have caught his attention; the archaeology of pub- lic baths that were essential parts of any Roman town; the archaeology of mansions, houses and their deco- ration, generally expressive and colorful mosaics made of tiles; and finally, the archaeology of Christian and Byzantine monuments. In the third article of the sec- tion, A. Bazzana builds a sort of link between the north and south of the Sahara and reviews the research themes that mark the scholarship on the Western part of the Dar al Islam - Land of Islam -. The evolution- ary dynamics of the Umma - the community of Believ- ers - is investigated through the lenses of five main topics: "Power and Urbanism, Territoriality, Houses and living contexts, daily life objects, and finally, craft and domestic techniques. A few sites are mentioned to make his points: the excavation of Lixus (Roman) and Byrsa (Byzantine) as windows to the preislamic peri- ods; Dia in Mali, dated from BC 800 to 1500 AD, as a case in the investigation of the "Longue duree"; the Qal'a of the Banu Hammad and Sabra Mansuriya (Tu- nisia) and Belyounech (Morroco) as illustration of the archaeology of palaces, castles, and houses. The pa- per ends with a number of suggestions for new re- search themes as well as a polite assessment of re- search funding and methods. Stone Age archaeology The book's third section title "The Early Humans" is ambiguous and partly misleading. The editors in- tended to avoid the use of some current archaeologi- cal constructs - like Stone Age, Palaeolithic, etc. - that are some time disputed by a number of writers. Unfor- tunately the solution is worse than the problem as the time range of the section's papers range on ... seven million years. The series of papers by M. Brunet et al should have been put in a section of its own. Indeed very exciting and ground breaking paleontological dis- coveries are reported and described. There is however no archaeologically relevant issue linked to these dis- coveries, if the focus of archaeological research is ho- minid/human made objects. This having been said, "Tournai, the Human Ancestor" is a fantastic paleontological discovery. The material, found at Site TM 266 out of 300 surveyed sites with vertebrates bones, consists of one skull, two jaw fragments, and three teeth, comes from the Upper Miocene deposit of Toros-Menalla, (Djourab, Northern Chad). It is dated biochronologically to 7 million years, named Sahelanthropus tchadensis , and called "Tournai" - hope - in Goran language. Brunet paper is comple- mented by three excerpts from Nature (vol. 418, July 11, 2002): the first outlining the paleontological system- atics of a new hominid from the Upper Miocene of Chad, in Central Africa, the second describing the ge- ology and paleontology of Toros-Menalla site 266, and the third, a brief communication with the dissent of M. Wolpoff, B. Senut, M. Pickford, and J. Hawkes followed by M. Brunet's vigorous rebuttal. Stone Age archaeology is reviewed through four papers focusing on the Sahara, part of the Sahel, Al- geria, and Morroco. The Saharan piece is authored by R. Vernet. He explicitly does not intend to write an ex- tensive review of the last 50 years of Saharan archaeo- logical research. He instead focuses on the "periods and themes that have witnessed significant changes" (p. 91). With a series of maps he spells out the distri- bution of key characteristics of successive chrono- logical periods starting with prehistoric human remains older than 10,000 years. An unfortunate shift in figure 1 places the Bahr el Gazzal which is in the Chad Re- public in northern Tenere in Niger. Oldowayan/Pre- Acheulean, Acheulean sites are featured in figures 2 and 3. Figure 4 was intended to be a map of Aterían sites but a glitch in the system resulted in a map of "Hand-axe making cultures". The rendering of re- search on the Middle Palaeolithic is difficult to com- prehend. It is a combination of typological and termi- nological considerations, Mousterian, Mousteroid, Aterían, Sangoan..eřc. that moved, mixed, overlapped or avoid "contact". The issue of a Sangoan presence in West Africa has been dropped long time ago and is part of the history of African archaeology. The Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 4 (1), 2006 173</page><page sequence="4">A.F.C. Holl chronology of the Aterían has changed radically re- cently (Di Lernia 1999; Mikdad et al. 2004; Holl 2005; Eiwanger, per s. comm. 2006) ranging from 100/80,000 to 30/25,000 BP in Morocco and the Tadrart Acacus in Central Sahara. The late Pleistocene and early Holocene settlements and those with early pottery that resulted from a population bottleneck for the former and new wave pf resettlement for the latter are fea- tured in figure 5 and 7, with in-between a chrono-cul- tural chart. The relative early date for the presence of pottery is one of the major advances of Saharan ar- chaeological research. The site of Oujoungou, in the Bandiagara cliff (Mali) with pottery deposits dated to 9500 BP is the westernmost instance of early manufac- ture of clay vessels. Most of these early pottery sites are concentrated in the central Sahara with some cases in the western desert and Sudan. Livestock hus- bandry emerged during the Early Holocene and spread later with the addition of sheep/goats to the initial cat- tle stocks. Agriculture took hold later with different cultivars, wheat and barley in Egypt, Sorghum, bulrush millet, and rice elsewhere, yams, colocasia sp. taros, and bananas/plantain in the more humid sub-equato- rial zone. The rendering of the state of research in rock art is surprisingly totally off the marks (p. 98 and 100); Saharan and other areas rock art research are moving in different directions with an increasing inter- est on the social, symbolic and cognitive aspects of past societies (Lequellec 1993; Smith 1993; Holl 2004; etc.). This summary of archaeological research in the Sahara is extraordinary selective and does a dis- service to the field as a whole. Fantastic research con- ducted by scores of scientists in Central Sahara - pub- lished in the monograph series "Mémoires du CRAPE" - palaeoclimatology - N. Petit-Maire and her team, in Western Sahara, Libya (Lake Shati), Mali (Erg-In-Sakane), etc. on the prehistory of the Borku - T. Tillet - , not to mention many others, are simply ig- nored, a distressing but expanding scholarly practice. The paper ends with a series of suggestions for fur- ther research organized into three rubrics: an extensive and systematic mapping campaign of Saharan and West African archaeological sites; an extension of ra- diocarbon dating tailored toward the construction of an inclusive chronology of past cultural develop- ments; and finally, a more vigorous investigation of palaeoclimatological changes and their concomitant palaeoenvironmental consequences. Y. Chaid-Saoudi, N. Ferhat and G. Aumassip re- view 50 years of archaeological research in Algeria in the light of the second major conference of the Panafrican Congress of Prehistory and Related Stud- ies that took place in Algiers in September-October 1952. The article outlines some current important ar- chaeological projects in progress at Ain Hánech, a "Oldowayan" chopper/chopping tools complex; Ternifine, a Middle Acheulean site, Er-Rayeh and other Mousterian and Aterían sites. Research has also re- sumed at some important Late Pleistocene and Early Holocene Iberomaurusian sites, at Columnata, Tamar Hat, and Afalou Bhou Rhummel. The rise and expan- sion of pastortal traditions is well researched and has brought important discoveries, like the systematic burial of cattle bones at Mankhor, in southern Tadrart Acacus. Rock art research as well as the transition to Historic Period are briefly alluded to, with suggestions for future research. The authors make interesting ref- erences to the dynamics of Aterían populations and suggest that it was linked to the Mousterian but not the result of an invasion. In their view, "the identifica- tion of a human branch springing from Homo erectus mauritanicus, that developed in North Africa into Mechta el Arbi Homo sapiens sapiens " (p. 102) backs their suggestion of local roots of the Aterían popula- tion. The suggested scenario belongs to the model of Regional Continuity in which the emergence of mod- ern humans took place in different parts of the world and was not the product of population replacement advocated by the "African Eve" or "Out of Africa II" model. F. Z. Sbihi-Alaoui, J.P. Raynal, and J.P. Daugas deal with two join Moroccan-French research projects developed during the last 25 years, one focused on the Early stone age site complex of Casablanca and the other on the Neolithic period of Northern Morocco. The Casablanca Early Stone Age complex is part of an exceptional geological formation with paleontological sites like Lissasfa and Ahl al-Oughtau dated respec- tively to 5.5 and 2.5 myrs and archaeological sites dat- ing from the Early to the Midlle Acheulean period ( 1 myrs to 600,000 years). A number of archaeological sites have been tested at Sidi Abderrahmane, Sidi Al Khadir-Helaoui, Oulad Hamida, Carriere Thomas and Grotte des Rhinoceros. The Casablanca research team has developed a project of "Archaeological -Prehis- toric - Parc", a recreational structure for educational and economic purposes. The experience is interesting and deserves to be watched carefully. The second project focusing on the Neolithic period of Northern Morocco has probed three sites, the cemetery of Skhirat, the monolith circle of M'Zora, and the habita- tion site of Kaf That el Ghar. A chronology of the 174 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 4 (1), 2006</page><page sequence="5">Book Review Article: The Difficult Path of France / Africa Scientific Cooperation Neolithic development is worked out and the abun- dant pottery used to devise typo-cultural groupings that developed from an initial early VII millennium BC Maghrebian Cardial Neolithic. The last paper of the section by M. Oluwaseyi Hambolu examines the patterns of Late Stone Age colonization of the southwestern part of the Chad ba- sin. A series of probes measuring 2 by 1 to 4 by 1 m and 1.1 to 3.6 m deep, were sunk in eight mound sites, Alagarno, Bukarkurari, Dumge, Labe, Tuba Ajuz I and III, Tuba Lawanti, and Walasa. A combination of radio- carbon dates, sites stratigraphies, and potsherds analyses allowed the author to devise a chronological outline. The early phase I dates from 1800 to 1400 BC and attests for semi-mobile pastoralists groups with cattle and sheep/goats herds. Phase II divided in three sub-phases A, AB, and C, lasted from 1500 to 400 BC and witnessed the development of agropastoral economies. All the settlements tested and the whole 1800-years archaeological sequence are lumped under the label of "Gajiganna Culture", an unfortunate sim- plification of a complex cultural and settlement evolu- tion. Peoples and societies The section on "Peoples and societies" contains six papers that range from the Early Holocene to the 1st millennium AD. The reason for regrouping these pa- pers as a section is far from obvious as the issues dealt with range from a sophisticated iconographie analysis of a bas-relief to the mapping of north Saharan early Neolithic sites. The first articles of the section by J.P. Roset and M. Riahi, entitled "Launching a synthesis program on the 'neolithization' and the beginning of the Neolithic across the Sahara" is a fusion of two dis- tinct papers. The senior author delineates the aims of the project, "to understand the palaeoclimatic, envi- ronmental, and cultural contexts of the emergence of the Neolithic across a trans-Saharan transect that in- cludes the Chotts - [depressions below sea level] - area from Tunisia, the Tadrart Acacus in Libya, Ti-n- Hanakaten in the Tassili-n-Ajjer in Algeria, and finally, the eastern Air - Tenere in Niger. He reviews the sites with early ceramic assemblages ( ca 9550 to 9100 BP) with the assumption that they belong to the Neolithic period despite the well documented absence of any evidence of food production. The use of the Neolithic concept in this context is misleading. The portion of the junior author (pp. 147-148) deals with different projects on palaeoenvironmental changes and human settlement in Gafsa, Gabes , and Chotts regions from the Late Pleistocene to the Holocene. She outlines the research conducted by the Tunusian National insti- tute of Archaeology, and the University of Tunis, as well as the archaeological atlas project supported by French cooperation. The paper ends with a reassess- ment of a set of new radiocarbon dates for Ibero- maurusian and Capsian sites that range from 17,470 to 7450 BP. A seven lines conclusion reasserts the aim of the project and expresses the hope that comparative analyses of all the collected data may bring to light early indicators of the emergence of Neolithic econo- mies. It is as if two originally distinct papers were as- sembled without an editorial attempt at more coher- ence. Azougui, an important cultural locality in the Mauritanian Adrar is the topic of the paper by N. B. Ould Mohamed. The article opens with a review of the Arabic sources that mention the name of Azougui which is claimed to have been the Ribat - Fortified Locality - from where the Almoravid Revivalist move- ment was launched in the 11th century AD. This first portion is followed by another review of the oral tra- ditions relative to the town. The archaeological com- ponent is the longest. It summarizes some of the ear- lier research, with the author referring to his three field expeditions in 1997, 1998, and 2000. The newly col- lected material is being analyzed and is not even al- luded to in the article. Previous studies by B. Saison (1981 : 74) have shown the complexity of the history of the settlement which is clearly not an Almoravid foun- dation. The oasis was settled some one or two centu- ries (9- 10th century AD) before the irruption of the Almoravid movement and was inhabited continuously up to 17th century. Moreover, the fortification generally ascribed to the Almoravid was built much later, after the demise of the movement. It is not clear what the writer has found during his excavation at Azougui; one has to wait for the publication of the new data to as- sess the impact of this new research on our under- standing of the archaeology of Azougui. The author nonetheless made an interesting suggestion, that of creating an archaeology field school that will be run by rotating international research teams. The third paper of the section by Boube Gado is practically an extensive overview of archaeological and even paleontological field research in Niger Re- public. The main focus is however on the cemetery sites with terracotta and stone effigies located in the Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 4 (1), 2006 175</page><page sequence="6">A.F.C. Holl Middle Niger Valley between the rivers Goruwol and Mekrou. He starts with a long list of all the archaeo- logical and paleontological expeditions conducted in Niger during the last twenty years, described the his- torical and ethnohistorical contexts of the cemeteries with terracotta and stone effigies. The latter are organ- ized into a number of distinct entities based on the re- gional distribution of certain categories of cultural re- mains: (1) the sites cluster of Bura with funerary clay sculptures on the right bank of the river Niger from Goruwol to Sirba dating form the 3rd to the middle of the 1 1th century AD; (2) the cluster of Kareygooru with votive terracotta, also on the right bank between the river Sirba and Gorubi as well as some islands in the Niger at Niamey, dated from AD 410 to 1280. The re- maining six groups are based on other material charac- teristics, carinated vessel at Gabu, clay beads at Yatakala, tumuli at Kareygooru, etc., point to an intri- cate mosaic that is not easy to comprehend. The exca- vation of Bura is reported in addition to surveys in an area threatened by mining plants at Komabangou, Windigalo, Samira, and Libri. The paper shows Niger archaeological research to be exclusively funded by foreign donors, a situation that usually generates un- ethical behaviors. Nacera Bencedik paper focuses on the origins of the "Healer-cults" in the Maghreb through an icono- graphie analysis of the Beja bas-relief. The latter was found near the Roman town of Vaga [today's Beja] in Tunisia in 1947. The context of find is unfortunately not known but it may have been part of a building, "a small sanctuary in the countryside" (p. 186) in the 3rd century AD. The characters represented in the bas-re- lief are all identified by their names written below, Macurtam, Macurgum, Vihinam, Bonchor, Varisissima, Matilam, Iunam, Marcus, Aemilius, Ianuarius, and Quintus Aelius Felix. Macurgum the equivalent of Aesculape [greek], the Greeko-Roman God of Medical practices and Vihinam the Goddess of childbirth, fe- cundity, and Immortality, are staged side by side. For the author, the Beja bas-relief represents a "religious graft" triggered by early contacts with the Roman civi- lization spread by traders after the Punnic Wars. The paper is particularly appealing; the reliance on shifts in etymologies make it difficult for a non-expert to assess. K. Sanogo discusses the shifting trends in the ar- chaeology of mortuary practices in the Niger bend (Mali) from the early 1900s' to the present. Desplagnes excavated the burial mound of El-Oualadji in 1904. It had a burial chamber, an impressive and rich array of grave goods, and two skeletons. The historical impli- cations of this finds were immediate and looked at from the perspective of the description of Ghana's kings burial by El-Bakri. Desplagnes was convinced to have found the burial of a Ghana high ranked official. R. Mauny expecting to uncover additional evidence de- cided to probe the mound from Kouga in 1954-1955 but was unsuccessful. A survey program was launched in the 1980 with a French-Malian team, followed by text- excavation of some selected mound-sites like Mouyssam H ( AD 300 - 680) and Toubel (AD 340 - 1430). This pro- gram also allowed for the dating of some of the key sites of the Mali archaeological landscape, like Tondidarou (AD 670-790) and El-Oualadji (AD 1030- 1 120). The range of variation of burial modes in the Niger bend has been increased very significantly. A. Person et al. paper outlines a bioarchaeological approach to address the issue of subsistence changes in the Dhar Nema, southeastern Mauritania. They con- ducted two survey and excavation field seasons in 2001 and 2002, mapped 29 sites along a 250 km north- south transect, and selected a few for further investi- gations. The chronology and patterns of settlement corroborate the finds from the Dhar Tichitt-Walata fur- ther north. Bou Khzama (DN 4) at 16° 44' 20" N and 7° 17' 24" W, located on the sandy flat at the cliff foot and measuring several hectares was selected for exca- vation. An excavation grid 70 x 20 m was set and a range of archaeological features were exposed. The recorded material, which includes pottery, lithics, bone tools, and animal bones, is described. The site presents an occupation sequence with two main components: a Late Stone age occupation that started around ca 2000 BC ending during the second half of the 1st mil- lennium BC when it was abandoned for a number of centuries. It was resettled by iron-using communities during a period that coincides with the heyday of the Ghana kingdom, i.e. 9th - 1 1th century AD. A number of burials were sampled to provide the material for trace analysis and diet assessment of the Late Stone Age agro-pastoralist of the Dhar Nema (DN); 1 1 skeletons were excavated from DN 4 and seven from DN 10. The rationale for trace analysis is well explained as well as its potentials and limits. The biochemical signals ob- tained on 13 skeletons and one cattle bone, precisely trace elements of Barium (Ba) and Strontium (Sr), show that the Dhar Nema inhabitants were "grain-eaters" as was the case for those of Dia Shoma in Mali. A. Per- son et al. contribution is a remarkable achievement. One can hardly wait for the final report of their pro- gram to be released. 176 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 4 (1), 2006</page><page sequence="7">Book Review Article: The Difficult Path of France / Africa Scientific Cooperation This section contains sophisticated and well crafted papers. The first two however, that on a trans- saharan transect of Late Pleistocene - Early Holocene sites and Azougui are poorly organized and provide no novel information. The Atlantic littoral The intentions of the editors are quite obvious in this section of three papers on the Atlantic littoral and the archaeology of seafaring. One paper deals with a topic from the southernmost locality of West Africa; another focuses on a site from the northernmost part of North Africa, and the third one wisely put in the middle position connects these two localities. J. Boache- Ansah presents a report on the excavation program he has conducted at Wodoku, next to Accra Airport in Ghana and accesses its bearing on sociocul- tural interaction in the Accra Plains. The excavated site, understood to be the earliest settlement of the Ga, was explored with two test-pits of 2 by 4 and 2 by 2 m on a 1.9 m high, 9 m long, and 2.7 m wide mound. The tested mound was shown to be a midden with dumped refuse. Pottery is the most abundant component of the collected cultural remains, with a number of metal ar- tifacts, glass fragments and faunai remains. The re- corded pottery is partitioned into a three step ware sequence termed Wodoku I, II, and III. A stone ware fragment manufactured in Northern France was col- lected in level 4 of Test I. For experts it is Type II Martinkamp-type flask dated to the sixteen century AD. The flask might have been carried by a British ship to West Africa. The Wodoku area might have been settled continuously from the 16th on even if post- IT01 artifacts have not yet been recorded (p. 227). Cul- tural interaction appears to have operate both ways, with an Akan influence on Wodoku pottery making tra- ditions, and Ga influence on local Akan settlers of the Accra Plains. C. Picard paper on Moslem and Christians seafar- ing along the Atlantic coast of Saharan Africa is above all programmatic as far as its archaeological facet is concerned. The history of European seafaring along the African coast is quite well known. The Por- tuguese daring open sea adventure of the 15th- 16th century was built on Arab sailors and Moslem mariners precedent. Based on medieval sources and Arab geog- raphers' treatises, C. Picard argues that there were regular if seasonal maritime traffic along the Maghreb Atlantic coast from Tangiers in the north to Nul Lamta in the south (p. 231). Arabs traders and sea crafts did not sail south of Cape Bojador. However, besides the numerous maps, instruments, and suggestive ribats - fortress- and buildings that could have been part of naval and harbors installations, there is no mention of any medieval shipwreck along the Atlantic coast of Morocco. This requires the development of underwa- ter archaeology that is not yet part of the research agenda. The Portuguese built on Arab sea routes and carried on with their systematic south, east, south, east, and northeast explorations with Vasco da Gama reaching India in 1498. Number of fortresses and trade entrepots were built along the Atlantic coast, at Saint Louis in the West to the Cape of Good Hope in the South. C. DeCorse and his team have explored a ship- wreck along the Ghana coast in the vicinity of El Mina. Underwater archaeology is a feasible research under- taking to take advantage of in the future. Unfortu- nately, despite its appealing title, C. Picard paper does not address the issue of sea-faring beyond Goree and the Senegal coast. Y. Benhima paper on the consequences of Portu- guese occupation of the northern Morrocan region of Safi in the 16th century spells out the demographic ef- fects of the Portuguese rise to the status of unchal- lenged naval power. The spill over of Iberians in Mo- rocco that started in the 15th AD was the direct conse- quence of the expulsion of Arabo-Moslem from the Iberian Peninsula. The military conquest and occupa- tion of the Safi region started in 1506. Relying on accu- mulated city maps, Y. Benhima outlines the pattern of remodeling of the town landscape, and the tight con- trol over resources and peoples exerted by Portuguese troops and elite. The Portuguese organized raids to cap- ture slaves to be sold in Portugal. Arab tribes were pit- ted against Berbers in a Machiavellian divide-and rule strategy. The colonial architecture that re-shaped the "townscape" was enacted with dramatic effects within less than five years. A Sea-castle with direct access to the harbor was completed 1508. A new fortified wall with square and semi-circular tower, resistant to cannon balls, was built around 1/3 of the Almohad town. Mos- lem religious spaces and monuments were sacked and the main city mosque was transformed into a church. The string of abandoned sites widespread in rural ar- eas was the outcome of the general unrest that sprung from the Portuguese take-over of the Safi region. This paper is very interesting with an important potential for the archaeology of the Safi region from 1500 to 1700. But at this stage it is essentially a skilled analysis of historical sources with no input from archaeology. Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 4 (1), 2006 177</page><page sequence="8">A.F.C. Holl Towns and their Hinterlands The section focusing on the development of cities and towns consists of five papers, one deal- ing with Sub-Saharan Africa, and the other four pre- senting case studies from the Maghreb. J. Polet at- tempts to discuss the emergence of cities in West Af- rica. His introduction which tries to castigate what he terms "archeologie/anthropologie anglo-saxonne" as essentially narrow uni-lineal evolutionist conception of the emergence of towns is ridicule to say the least, and poor scholarship, not backed by supporting bib- liographic references (p. 250). Instead of dealing with the multiplicity of factors that may have triggered the emergence of West African towns as one may have ex- pected from the title, he focuses on a short history of research on West African towns. This is done through the selection of three case studies: Kumbi-Saleh, Tegdaoust/Awdaghost, and Jenne-jeno. Bonnel de Mezieres, R. Mauny, J.Devisse, S. Robert, and Sylvie Berthier have contributed to our knowledge on Kumbi- Saleh. Through limited excavations, they all focused on the stone town and neglected the other part of the huge site complex. The history of research on Koumbi- Saleh is nowhere to be seen beside the ironic refer- ences to Bonnel de Mezieres, R. Mauny and the IFAN (p. 251). There is relatively more information about Tegdaoust/Awdaghost where the author conducted his doctorate fieldwork (Polet 1985). J. Devisse and R. Mauny launched an ambitious archaeological project at Awdaghost in the 1960s' but J. Devisse did not "discover" [invente (p. 251)] the site as claimed by the author. This was done much earlier by Lieuten- ant Boery (1923) who found the accurate and precise location of the medieval Awdaghost and described it in his monograph " Le Rkiss ( Mauritanie ): Essai de Monographie Locale " published in 1923. With the appointment of R. Mauny as director of the archaeo- logical section of the Institut Français d'Afrique Noire (IFAN), archaeological research entered the scene. Mauny visited the ruins of Awdaghost and Togba in January 1949 and was immediately convinced of the imperative need for an important archaeological project (Mauny 1950, 1961: 71). This correction made, even the history of Awdaghost research is vague and su- perficial. The case of Jenne-jeno follows the same fate. It is interesting that J. Polet is a new "convert" to the archaeological reconstruction based on absence of evidence which is, as is well known, not evidence of absence. Hopefully the new research the author is in- volved in at Dia - Mali - will bring with it more inter- esting data. The second article of the section by A. Ennabli present an update on recent archaeological research on the Carthage site-complex., after the end of the UNESCO International Campaign that lasted from 1972 to 1994. The urban complex that emerged at the end of the 9th century BC and lasted up to 146 BC, when it was leveled by Roman Legions, was divided into four international concessions: A British team directed by Hurst was granted the circular harbor, the Amirauté is- let and the north coast. An American team led by L. Stager excavated in the Tophet. A German team di- rected by F. Rakob and H. Niemeyer work on the on the littoral plain. And finally, a French team with S. Lancei, J.P. Thuillier and J.P. Morel with unspecified assignment, and a small mobile Tunisian team created to deal with unforeseen problems. Beside the summary of historical narrative about Carthage, the new update is essentially chronological, outlining the evolution of the town through three main phases: Archaic: IX- VI century BC, Classic: V - IV century BC; and Late Clas- sic: III-II century BC. The reader would have expected more than that. M. Lenoir focuses on the joined French-Morrocan research project launched in 1977 and devoted to the study of Dchar Jdid-Zilil in Northern Morroco. The site measures some 32 hectares. Known as Lulia Constancia Zilil in Roman times, it was a colony founded by Octavius, the future Emperor August, at the end of the 1st century BC. The previous and earlier city measured some 5.5 hectares in surface extent and had trade links with Italy and Spain. It was destroyed at the very end of the 1st century BC, between 33 and 27 BC when Octavius decided to create the colony of Lulia Constancia Zilil, with a central temple, a public bath and a fortified wall. The Town went through a short cycle of decline in the 3rd - 4th century AD and was re- built in 355-360 AD with an early Christian church. It was finally destroyed in the 5th century by fire. A very precise and interesting report that gives a sense of the evolution of urban life in Roman North Africa. Tamdult was the gate to the Sahara and Lands of the Sudan. P. Cressier presents the results of a French - Morrocan project on the "Origins of Islamic Cities in Morroco: Nakur, Aghmat, Tamdult". The issues they intend to address revolve around one main question: "What were the necessary and sufficient conditions for the kick off of urbanization processes in the Dar al-Is- lam? Three cities were selected for further investiga- tion, Nakur in the Rif; Aghmat in the Dir, and Tamdult on the Saharan fringe. The latter is referred to in writ- 178 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 4 (1), 2006</page><page sequence="9">Book Review Article: The Difficult Path of France / Africa Scientific Cooperation ten sources for the exploitation of precious metals and minting, the trans-Saharan trade, and agricultural pro- duction. Archaeological testing reveals a slightly dif- ferent picture across three documented occupations levels, even if traces of metallurgical activities are yet to be discovered. Three excavation probes were sunk within the walled town complex and its immediate pe- riphery; a geophysical survey was carried out in the area with a high concentration of iron slag; a guided survey of features suggested by remote-sensing that happened to belong to the irrigation channels network was implemented. The whole complemented by an ar- chitectural analysis of the main city wall and the Sidi Shanawil Mausoleum. In fact archaeological research reveals a pattern of evolution of Tamdult richer and much more complex than suggested by written sources. L. Arbati compares two cities, the Casbah of the Oudayas and Aghmat, both dated to the 9th -11th cen- tury AD. The former, found within the modern cemetery of Rabat was an Almoravid Ribat [stronghold] built in the 1 1th century; and the latter, located in the Haouz of Marrakech was founded in the 9th century AD. The Ribat was built along the Atlantic coast at the mouth of the Bou Regreg River in 1 150 to protect the coast- line. It is a fortress 60 m long and 30 m wide, with 2.80 to 3.00 m thick fortification walls. A monumental gate leading to the imperial quarter and part of the main wall were exposed. Aghmat on the other hand was explored with a series of three trenches and appears to have been inhabited from the 1 1th to the 15th century AD. It was the central town of a small Berber state, sur- rounded by a fortified wall with a public bath - hammam - 16.50 m long and 14.50 m wide at its center. In this section on urbanism, there is an obvious imbalance between North and West Africa. The whole history of West African cities is dealt with in one poorly crafted article. North African cities on the other hand are dealt with as specific case studies, as is the case for Carthage in Tunisia, Dchar Jdid-Zilil, Tamdult, Aghmat and the Casbah of Oudayas in Morroco. Re- search partnership is clearly more frequent between French and North African teams. Archaeology of techniques Pottery-making, weaving, iron metallurgy, and hydraulic machines are the main "technologies" de- bated in this section of four articles. M. Picon inves- tigates pottery making traditions in Morocco with the ultimate aim of determining the provenience of North African vessels found at Awdaghost, a 700-1500 AD West African town located in Mauretanian Sahara. Af- ter a short discussion of the regional ethnoarchaeological approach developed for this study, he describes the pottery making traditions of the Rif and the Upper At- las. The former is exclusively a female small-scale pro- duction geared toward the manufacture of domestic vessels they need in their daily routine. The latter is exclusively male, with potters villages, workshop, the use of wheel, and oven-firing. Picon disagrees with the current gendered intensification theory and searches for alternative explanations. He found two comple- mentary determining factors, the social structure of production and the differences in the exploited clay sources. The Rif clay, which is mandatory for the fe- male potters who can but collect this raw material from their own tribal land, includes a relatively high propor- tion of lime that makes it shrink and crack at high tem- peratures. In addition the production is strictly sea- sonal with relatively low output. The Upper Atlas on the other hand has better clay deposits that can with- stand high temperatures, and as such, have attracted potters that operate in workshops and generate highly specialized potters settlements. Having dismissed the proximity of large population concentrations in the nearby Marrakech area fuelling a constant demand as the main reason for the pattern of intensification ob- served in the Upper Atlas (p. 302), M. Picon is left with an unconvincing alternative, as if the streamlin- ing and intensification of pottery production is self- motivated and takes place in a vacuum. The gender differences in both pottery-making traditions are rooted in the social systems; men are free to move away from their homes in search for economic oppor- tunities. The degree of freedom of women is unfortu- nately very limited. Shifting to the past, the vessels from Awdaghost seem to have their origins in the Tafilalet, around Sidjilmassa, one the most active com- mercial nodes of the trans-saharan trade. D. Cardon examines the archaeology of textiles in West Africa and the Maghreb with a special focus on tools and pigments. He reviews the handful of in- stances of textile finds in archaeological contexts, in the burial caves of the Bandiagara cliff in Mali and Iwelen in Niger Sahara. He also presents some infor- mation of the production of pigments in North Africa, from Libya in the east to Mogador island in the West. The remaining part of the paper is above all program- matic with suggestions for the study of weaving instal- lations, production tools, pigment producing plants, as Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 4 (1), 2006 179</page><page sequence="10">A.F.C. Holl well as dying techniques. It is however surprising that the more or less ubiquitous spindle-whorls, a crucial element of the weaving process, generally present in virtually all the major archaeological sites excavated in West Africa and described in numerous reports, are not mentioned in the whole paper. J.B. Kiethega discussed the program he has de- veloped on the archaeology of metallurgy in Burkina Faso, on gold and iron from 1974 onwards. He provides a detailed list of works produced by the students he has trained. His own research culminated with his Doctorat d'etat thesis presented in 1997 and entitled "Metallurgie Lourde du Fer au Burkina Faso " [Heavy Iron Metallurgy in Burkina Faso]. All this re- search was funded by French cooperation and J.B. Kiethega is the only one who dared describe what is generally nerve raking for Africans dealing with French embassies personnel: obstruction tactics, bu- reaucratic arrogance, funds forwarded too late and re- turned to the French treasury as unclaimed, etc.. He narrates a sad and humiliating story of the confisca- tion by the French Ambassy officials of three cameras - [Canon] - he had purchased without approval with the allocated research funds, simply because they are not French-made. But the withheld cameras were given as a present to a French "coopérant". He is more force- ful when he refers to the ill-conceived "Centre Re- gional inter- African d'Archeologie de Nouakchott" [CRHA] in contrast to the program run by the Univer- sity of Ouagadougou on "Histoire et Archeologie Africaines" supported by the West African Associa- tion of Archaeologists. For Kiethega (p. 323), French cooperation has to refrain from any initiative that runs against the projects and intentions of West African archaeologists. He goes further to state that the Nouakchott center was created explicitly by French Cooperation to curtail any attempt at intellectual au- tonomy of African archaeologists and preempt any "independent" prospective on the future of the ar- chaeology of the continent. Clearly the path of French/Africans scientific collaboration is bumpy to say the least. J.B. Kiethega final remarks precisely hit the mark when he writes: "From now on, could sincer- ity shapes the relationships between partners in the scientific archaeological cooperation with France. French colleagues can help decolonize African archae- ology" (p. 323). P. Benoit, E. Coulibaly, and P. Fluzin article presents a sample of what structural metallography can achieve in the determination of technological know- how. The tested objects range from a bloom fragment from a 19th century Nay erena blacksmith workshop to a recent lighter, through a 12th century arrow from Biron, a 12- 13th century sickle blade from Gnamankui, and a 19th century anvil from Nandjela. In all these cases, it has been possible through the use of metallographic microscope to probe the kind of metal used, the techniques of manufacture of the artifacts, as well as traces of use. The crucial issue of access to these specialized research facilities and high technol- ogy equipment is addressed nowhere. It is nonethe- less noteworthy to specify that P. Benoit and P. Fluzin are among the small number of French scholars who have frequently co-authored scientific papers with their African colleagues. The fifth and last article of the section is an ethnoarchaeological study of medieval hydraulic tech- nology, focused on the norias of Fez region and pre- sented by A. Bazzana and Y. Montmessin. The Arabs introduced a number of hydraulic machines in the Maghreb, and this resulted in a sort of agricultural "revolution" in the 10 - 12th century AD. The present study examines the machines set along the Oued Sebou, west of the town of Mikkes in Morroco. Fif- teen such norias, all part of agricultural technology were visited and analyzed. Taking advantage of the river kinetic energy, these water-wheels scoop water from the river and pour it in a shallow tank or cistern that feeds a network of irrigation canals. There are some variations in size, shape, and capacity from case to case but the "blue-print" and construction tech- niques are more or less similar. They include a number of pillars supporting the wheel and the water-collect- ing component, the water-wheel itself, and the rotating axis. These are simple and robust machines requiring constant maintenance. Surveys, emergency archaeology, and cultural resource management The section on cultural resource management and related issues is made of six papers from different countries. M. N. Lame paper deals with the legal and political hurdles to a sound archaeological heritage management in Senegal. Most of the needed laws and governmental regulations inherited from French Colo- nial rule and improved through time are in place; it is their implementation that causes problems. There is a chronic lack of trained personnel, an absence of infra- structure, and of course no funds. Despite all these 180 Journal of African Archaeology Vol. 4 (1), 2006</page><page sequence="11">Book Review Article: The Difficult Path of France / Africa Scientific Cooperation problems, M. Lame surveyed a long 248 kilometers and 200 m wide transect from the Lac de Guiers in the north to Dakar in the southwest where the Cayor canal is planned to be dug. He evaluated the archaeological impact of the project and brought interesting information on the sites to be more or less directly affected. His survey recorded 18 Stone Age and 172 proto-historic sites, including 139 tumuli. 1 1 8 of these sites will be impacted and from this set he singled out eight to be considered as a priority. The survey was conducted some ten years ago, in 1995- 1996; nothing has changed since then. Was it a false alert? The contribution of D.A. Kuevi summarizes the preliminary results of a survey in the hills of south- western Togo, known during the Colonial period as the "Massif des Fetiches". Remains of different kinds of constructions were recorded; stone founda- tions of round houses at Kpeveta and Ahlon Denu, terrace walls and standing stones in the Ahlon canton, with an enigmatic 24 m in diameter circular feature, a subterranean stone built room, and an earthen- wall 4 kilometers in perimeter near the village of Tinipe. A charcoal sample collected from the AHL 1 stone circle provide a radiocarbon pointing to 3155 +/- 250 BP. Any correlation with present-day or histori- cally known populations is however highly specula- tive. A. Akerraz writes about the extensive project of the publication of an archaeological atlas of Morroco in Antiquity. He focuses specifically on the surveys conducted in the wadi Sebou drainage basin, in the Gharb plain and Volubilis and its hinterland. The gen- eral tone of the article is however above all program- matic. M. Fakroune presents the survey work conducted in Syrtica, in north central Libya. The research program jointly funded by UNESCO and the Libyan Antiquity Department focused on the northern fringe of the Sa- hara. The work in Syrtica that lasted from 1990 to 1999 was done in collaboration with French researchers. The surveyed area measures some 80 kilometers east- west and stretches from the coastal plain to the plateau and upper reach of the wadi system, it contains some 350 archaeological sites. The coastal plain is shown to have very few sites beside numerous caravansérails. The intermediate zone, along the middle valleys of wadi Amra, w. Harawa, and w. Ahmed, presents evi- dence of fields and water control devices. The lower slopes of the plateau further inland have the highest density of settlement along the Wadi Harawa and the western tributaries of Wadi Amar. The plateau and the upper reach of the waddi system is mostly a dry land with very few sites. In general, increased sedentari- ness is documented to have taken place between the 1st century BC and the 5th century AD. Fanfala and Gohitafla are endangered archaeo- logical sites located in the center and north of Cote d'Ivoire. The former contains 13 stone tumuli measur- ing 2.5 to 7 m in diameter and the latter has numerous anthropomorphic and zoomorphic statuettes. Both sites are unprotected with the predictable result of complete destruction of that part of Cote-ď Ivoire cul- tural heritage. This is precisely the topic B. Kouao- Biot decided to focus on in her article. She describes the classic and endemic problem faced by sub-Saha- ran African countries regarding the management of cultural resources: lack of sustained policies; lack of trained personnel, but above all widespread poverty that triggers site plundering as means to survive. She proposes a three pronged strategy to manage Cote d- Ivoire cultural heritage: (1) An intensive communica- tion campaign that will involve local populations; (2) an international collaborative research program at the sub-regional level with direct neighbors; and finally, (3) a training and research program. The suggestions are certainly well felt and one can but wish her good luck. Terracottas statuettes from the Inland Niger Delta are a hot commodity in the international art market. Because of the high demand, groups of looters oper- ate in the area, destroying archaeological sites. After their passage some portions of the "visited" mounds look like battle fields. It is the topic D. Kouyate ad- dresses in his article which reads like an official speech to a captive audience. He traces the beginning of site looting to legitimate archaeological research. For him, "archaeological research conducted in the 1980s (par- ticularly the excavation of Djenne-jeno whose results went through a media frenzy) have the unforeseen and devastating consequence of increasing the pressure of looters on that zone" (p. 395). He then outlines a number of suggestions to counter site looting while promoting Mali cultural heritage and suggests a gran- diose research project on Mali cultural heritage that was submitted to French cooperation for funding, but not supported.

Holl Conclusion The last few pages of the book are devoted to of- ficial speeches and as such are part of politics and di- plomacy. As far as the substance of the book is con- cerned, this is a very positive move in the right direc- tion. The relationship between a former Colonial power and former colonized countries is particularly difficult. The road from dominant/dominated to equal partner- ship is difficult and bumpy. It is very unlikely that such an equal partnership advocated by virtually every par- ticipant, can emerge when one of the partners has to- tal control of the funding. A resource book, without any doubt, that conveys the multiple facets of human experience. Augustin F.C. Holl The University of Michigan, Ann Arbor, USA References Boery, Lt. 1923.
