Cooper, Jeffrey J. Croteau, Chantal Parenteau, and Angelo Toglia Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. Copyright 1997 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT In rollovers, belted occupants sustain a lower fatality rate compared to unbelted occupants primarily due to lower risk of partial or full ejection. However, seat belt and occupant compartment designs found in most current vehicles do not prevent head contact with the vehicle interior during a rollover because of occupant torso and head excursion that result from the rollover dynamics. An experimental study was conducted to simulate the airborne phase of a rollover. The goals of this study were to: 1) quantify the effect of restraint anchor locations and belt component designs in reducing head excursion, and 2) to better correlate the response between humans and an Anthropomorphic Test Device (ATD) during the high angular roll rate of the airborne phase of a rollover. A Head Excursion Test Device was designed to rotate a restrained occupant about an axis to approximate the inertial loading experienced during the airborne phase of a rollover. Overall occupant kinematics were recorded with onboard video cameras and analyzed to determine vertical and lateral head displacements. Static tests were carried out using human volunteers, and both static and dynamic tests were conducted with a Hybrid III ATD and a human cadaver. In addition to the test subject, webbing length and angle, latch plate design and restraint pretensioning were used as control variables for evaluation of head excursion. A total of 80 excursion tests were conducted: 51 tests with a Hybrid III 50th percentile male ATD (20 static and 31 dynamic), 18 tests with a cadaver (7 static and 1 1 dynamic) and 1 1 static tests with two male volunteers. In tests using a two-point lap belt, belt angle was more significant than overall belt length in reducing head excursion. Results indicated that vertical head excursion was minimized with a steep lap belt angle and short webbing length. Tests utilizing a three-point lap and torso restraint demonstrated that the torso belt reduced vertical head excursion primarily by restricting forward torso rotation. Furthermore, increasing the belt webbing pretension load reduced vertical and lateral head excursion. Comparison of results from human volunteers, cadaveric and Hybrid III ATD subjects in static tests indicated that the Hybrid III ATD had the least vertical excursion. Dynamically, the Hybrid III ATD had less vertical and lateral excursion than the cadaver. Results from this study may be useful in future seat belt design. Results also suggest that while the currently available Hybrid III ATD is a useful tool in testing the effectiveness of restraint system parameters, it may not fully simulate vertical and lateral head excursion of humans in rollover conditions. INTRODUCTION Road accidents kill approximately 40,000 people per year in the United States (NHTSA, 1993). Of these, 9,000 to 10,000 involved vehicle rollovers (Cohen and Digges, 1989). Given that a rollover occurs, head and neck injuries yield the highest measure of HARM for both belted and unbelted occupants (Digges et al., 1991). Seat belts are about 69 percent effective in reducing fatalities in rollovers, primarily due to the prevention of ejection (Evans, 1990). However, seat belts typically 4024</page><page sequence="2">cannot prevent head contact with the adjacent roof or window area during a rollover due to head excursion within the limited occupant space (Bahling et al., 1990). PREVIOUSLY REPORTED HEAD EXCURSION STUDIES: Shoemaker (1959) used a rollover simulator to study the kinematics of restrained and unrestrained dummies. He reported aircraft-type lap belts to be of great value . . . (but) "in some tests the head struck the car roof. Stone (1974) reported the kinematics of lap/torso belted dummies in rollover crash tests. He found that the belted dummies could have considerable lateral motion of the head and upper torso which "... can result in severe head and shoulder impacts with the roof side rails and upper B pillars." Johnson et al. (1984) observed occupant kinematics in car-to-guardrail rollover crash films and noted that, "Dummies restrained by seat belts were subjected to partial ejection at about the same frequency as unrestrained dummies." Obergefell et al. (1986) used the simulated belted occupant kinematics from six guardrail crash tests that resulted in rollovers. They noted that, "The vehicle's rotation keeps the mannequin high in the seat and against the door . . .", but that in all the simulations, "The occupant fell to the side, sliding out of the shoulder belt." Bahling et al. (1990) reported the inverted hang test of three approximately 50th percentile males and a Hybrid III ATD in a lap/torso belt with a locking latch plate. In eight belted rollover crash tests, they noted that rollovers of one revolution per second were consistently observed and that "... as a result of this rotational velocity, dummies moved upward and outward to the extent which the lap belt and vehicle side interior would allow. They tended to remain with their heads adjacent to the outboard roof siderail . . . (until ground impacts)." Arndt et al. (1995) conducted static vertical hang tests of volunteers and a 95th percentile Hybrid III ATD at 45 deg and 90 deg lap belt angles. The more vertically angled lap belts consistently allowed less head excursion. Drop tests from 0.91 m with a 5 g deceleration of the fixture resulted in about 250 mm of Hybrid III ATD head displacement using a 45 deg lap belt angle. Pretensioning the webbing reduced the excursion. Herbst et al. (1996) reported static and 100 deg/s inversions of human subjects with a rollover fixture whose roll center was at the approximate center of gravity of the seated occupant. An "improved belt geometry" of unstated angle and tension was said to reduce excursion by as much as 75 percent. Herbst later reported with Friedman et al. (1996) more results using the same test fixture. Arndt et al. (1997) performed vertical pull tests on a belted rigid Hybrid III ATD pelvis and torso to measure the vertical excursion of the pelvis with a 890 N load. They found about 9 cm of vertical motion of the pelvis which they attributed to seat belt characteristics such as anchor locations, routing, retractor and stretch. James et al. (1997) performed static hang tests on an 80th percentile male and 5th percentile female by inverting them in fourteen different vehicles. They observed that each volunteer had "approximately 12.7 cm" of vertical head excursion and that "neither occupant size nor the type of restraint had any significant effect on the measured static excursion values." FOCUS OF THE CURRENT STUDY. Occupant kinematics during a typical lateral rollover are defined by airborne phases, where the vehicle is off the ground and rotating about its center of gravity, and impact phases when the vehicle is in contact with the ground and changing its roll rate. A typical roll velocity during the airborne phase is one revolution per second, which corresponds to a 3 to 4 g centripetal acceleration at the roof side rail (Or≈Çowski et al., 1985). This rotation typically causes the head of the belted occupant to move upward and outward to either contact the underside of the roof or possibly extend out the window opening. This study investigates how to limit this airborne head excursion through changes in seat belt design. To simulate a portion of the airborne roll, a Head Excursion Test Device has been developed to reproduce different roll velocities representative of rollover accidents. The device is used to evaluate head excursion during these rollover simulations, and to quantify the effect of various restraint system parameters. These parameters include lap and torso belt length and angle, pretensioning and different latch plate designs. Tests have been conducted using a Hybrid III ATD and a human cadaver to determine the effect of various seat belt configurations on head position during dynamic tests that encompassed approximately 240 degrees of roll. Static tests were carried out with a Hybrid III ATD, human volunteers and human cadaver. In addition, the influence of the Hybrid III pelvis was evaluated by testing both a seated and a pedestrian pelvis. The test data was used to develop a correlation between the cadaver, human volunteer and Hybrid III ATD head excursion responses so that the Hybrid III ATD results can be extrapolated to human occupants. TEST FIXTURE DESCRIPTION HEAD EXCURSION TEST DEVICE. A test device, developed for and utilized in this study, is depicted in Figure 1 . The fixture consists of two steel support stands fixed to a concrete base, atop which sit bearing supports for an aluminum square tube that serves as the longitudinal axis of rotation. Two transverse aluminum I- beams are mounted on the underside of the square tube and support the seat and two hoop-like steel structures. 4025</page><page sequence="3">These hoops provide locations for attaching the restraint system anchors, side panel, reference plane lines and photographic equipment. The occupant environment is, thus, free to rotate about the axis. A counterweight provides ease of control in rotating the seated occupant in static tests. The fixture may be held in any position by the application of a manually controlled hydraulic disk brake assembly located atop one of the support stands at one end of the aluminum square tube. The brake is also used to decelerate the fixture after the completion of a dynamic roll. The fixture is capable of simulating driver- or passenger-side-leading rolls for either the driver or passenger seating positions at a maximum roll rate of 280 deg/s about an approximate center of gravity of a vehicle. For the purposes of this research, a driver-side- leading roll was simulated for the driver seating position. The seat incorporated into the fixture represents the front bucket seat geometry of a generic vehicle determined from a survey of twelve vehicles whose model years ranged from 1981 to 1992. The vehicles included eight small to mid-size cars and four sport utility vehicles. In the survey, length dimensions and angle of seat back and seat bottom cushions were recorded, as well as the height of the front edge of the seat bottom cushion above the floorpan. The average dimensions of these surveyed vehicles were used to fabricate a non- compliant seat constructed of 19-mm plywood. The seat back and seat bottom widths are 508 mm, the seat back height is 762 mm, the seat bottom length is 493 mm. The seat bottom and seat back angles are adjustable, but were fixed at 14 deg and 1 15 deg, respectively, for all tests in this study. A flat 19-mm plywood side panel was positioned 0.36 m to the left of the seat midline and extending 0.57 m above the seat bight to limit the lateral displacement of the test subject during the roll phase. The lateral location of the side panel relative to the seat was representative of the seat-to-door panel distance in several of the surveyed vehicles. This flat panel allowed repeatable comparisons without the confounding effects of occupant interaction with interior door trim components such as the armrest or design contours of an actual vehicle door. Figure 1. Head Excursion Test Device shown in the 0 deg (upright) orientation 4026</page><page sequence="4">A generic restraint system comprised of production vehicle parts was utilized in this study. Anchorage locations were designed to be adjustable in the x-z (vertical) plane, so that various belt angles and lengths could be evaluated. The lap and torso belt anchors are continuously adjustable in this plane through the use of an arrangement of slide tubes. The inboard and outboard (both lap and torso) belt anchors were laterally spaced 0.52 m apart, based on data obtained in the vehicle survey, and the seat was centered between the anchors. Lateral positions of the restraint anchors and the seat remained constant for all tests. Except for tests 20 and 21 (Appendices 1 and 2), the inboard and outboard lap belt configurations were always matched. The belt anchor fittings were allowed to rotate about the mounting bolts that secured them to the test fixture. The outboard end of the torso belt webbing was clamped at the simulated retractor location. No retractors were used in any tests because webbing extension out of the retractor is not significant in most rollovers. Typically, the pre-roll maneuvers of a vehicle result in accelerations adequate to lock any retractor which complies with FMVSS 209. Once locked, the belt loads in rollovers are low compared to other collisions. Bahling et al. (1990) recorded lap belt webbing loads on the order of 1500 N in eight rollover crash tests. Consequently, little webbing stretch or tightening of webbing wraps within the retractor is expected. PROCEDURES A matrix of tests was devised to systematically explore the effects of various restraint system parameters on head excursion. Each test was conducted with a driver occupant, and with the roll direction as driver-side-leading, or counterclockwise as viewed from the driver's seat. The effects of lap belt length and angle, torso belt length and angle, pretensioners, latch plate design and Hybrid III ATD pelvis type were investigated. Static tests were run with Hybrid III ATD, cadaveric and volunteer subjects. Human volunteer subjects were excluded from the dynamic tests. Details of the test parameters used in each test are listed in Appendix 1 for static tests and Appendix 2 for dynamic tests. Procedures for establishing restraint system geometries, subject selection and preparation, general static and dynamic test execution, and obtaining head excursion measurements are presented below. RESTRAINT SYSTEM MEASUREMENTS: The lap belt length was defined as the distance from the Hybrid III ATD H-point axis to the lap belt restraint anchor location as projected in the x-z plane. Lengths of 152, 330 and 508 mm were used. The lap belt angle was defined as the angle above horizontal as projected in the x-z plane. Lap belt angles of 30, 53 and 75 deg were selected as representative of the limits and the mid- point of the anchor locations allowed by FMVSS 210 (Fig. 2). The torso belt length was defined as the distance between the Hybrid III ATD shoulder reference point and the torso anchor location as projected in the x-z plane. The torso belt lengths used in the tests were 102, 254 and 406 mm. The torso belt angle is the angle above horizontal as projected in the x-z plane. Once the anchor locations for a given combination of belt lengths and angles were established for the Hybrid III ATD, they remained unchanged for the volunteer and cadaver testing. 4027</page><page sequence="5">Figure 2. Definitions of lap belt length and angle SUBJECT SELECTION AND PREPARATION: Three types of subjects were tested: a Hybrid III 50th percentile male ATD, two human male volunteers and a human cadaver. The Hybrid III ATD was used in both static and dynamic tests; in some of the tests a pedestrian pelvis was used instead of the standard seated pelvis. The Hybrid III ATD was uninstrumented except in tests 26, 27, 28 and 29 identified in Appendix 2. In these four tests, the Hybrid III ATD head was instrumented with a triaxial accelerometer set, and the fixture was instrumented to measure roll angle as a function of time. The two volunteers were used in static inversion tests to correlate the Hybrid III ATD and human characteristics. Selected from the Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. (FaAA) staff, the volunteers had no medical history of degenerative disease or trauma. A fresh, 73-year-old male cadaver obtained from the Anatomic Gift Foundation was used in static and dynamic tests to further correlate the Hybrid III ATD and human characteristics. The subject's medical records were evaluated to ensure that there was no preexisting orthopedic disease or trauma; the cause of death was congestive heart failure. The subject was also screened for HIV and Hepatitis A, B and C. The subject was 1.73 m and 88.1 kg with a relaxed seated height of 0.78 m. The research content and procedures governing the procurement, treatment and disposition of the cadaver were based on OSHA guidelines. A protocol was written and has been accepted by an Institutional Review Board consisting of biomechanical and mechanical engineers and a clergy member. For two days prior to testing, the subject was stored at 4¬∞ C. The subject was dressed in fluid barrier plastic clothing covered with fabric. Rigor mortis was not present on the test day. As the head excursion test procedure did not involve impact testing, 4028</page><page sequence="6">eighteen non-intrusive tests (eleven dynamic and seven static) were carried out with the single subject. Ali of the cadaver tests were carried out in one day. The extent of changes in cadaver flexibility during the test program were not quantified, and no attempt was made to examine systematic changes in cadaver head excursion resulting from repeated testing. Analysis of the data, however, showed good consistency in three identical tests (tests 66, 67, and 68). GENERAL TEST PROCEDURES: For each test, the subject was centered in the driver-side seating position, with feet placed in ankle restraints and hands resting on the thighs. The back of the pelvis was positioned against the seat back with no clearance. An effort was made to position the subject in the same manner for each test. Hybrid III ATD arm, hip and leg joint torques were initially set to 1 g but were not readjusted between tests. A lightweight aluminum linear scale with 2.54 cm gradations was attached to the head of each subject to facilitate head clearance measurement. Specified belt angles, lengths and simulated retractor tension (if using a three-point belt) were established and verified prior to each test. All three-point belt tests were conducted with a 9 N simulated retractor tension. For the pretensioning tests, a 222, 445 or 667 N load was applied to the inboard lap belt buckle webbing. The pretensioning load was oriented in the same direction as the lap belt angle and applied after the subject had been positioned. In the static tests, the fixture was rotated 180 deg at a rate less than 50 deg/s. The occupant was then lightly repositioned to a vertical orientation and the head position was measured. For the dynamic tests, the fixture was rotated upward to a starting position 28 deg clockwise from the horizontal plane before being allowed to rotate freely, under gravitational acceleration, in the counterclockwise direction. Preliminary dynamic tests conducted with a rotary potentiometer mounted on the fixture indicated typical peak angular velocities of 280 deg/s in these tests. This corresponds to a 5 g acceleration at the top of the side panel, directed radially inward from the axis of rotation. After the fixture was slowly decelerated to a stop, it was rotated to the inverted (180 deg) position. The head position was then measured as in the static tests; this inverted measurement is referred to as the post-dynamic-test clearance. VERTICAL HEAD EXCURSION MEASUREMENT: Vertical head excursion is defined as the difference between the head clearance at the initial upright position I and the head clearance at the position of interest. Two onboard video cameras (frontal and lateral views) were used to document occupant kinematics while a single offboard video camera recorded the entire fixture rotation. One of the onboard cameras was positioned with its lens aligned with the horizontal plane established by a pair of string lines that served as the reference for the head clearance measurement. In static tests, head clearances relative to the horizontal reference plane were measured at the initial upright and inverted positions by recording the location at which the reference plane intersected the linear scale mounted on the subject's head. The same methodology was used to determine initial and post-test inverted head clearances in dynamic tests. The resolution of these measurements was ¬± 3 mm. The minimum dynamic head clearance resulting from each test was obtained from post-test video analysis of the head during the period of free rotation. The head clearance perpendicular to the plane was measured on the video screen by recording the shortest distance between the reference line and any point on the head. The head-mounted linear scale graduations were used to determine the true dynamic head clearance values. To compensate for out-of-plane effects, the pitch angle of the head and scale was determined from the lateral camera view. However, in some tests, the pitch angle could not be measured due to camera positioning. In the upright position, the average pitch angle was 22 deg for the Hybrid III ATD, 12 deg for the volunteers and 0 deg for the cadaver. In the inverted position, the pitch angles were 22 deg for the Hybrid III ATD, 21 deg for the volunteers and 0 deg for the cadaver. RESULTS Specific head excursion results for each test are presented in the appendices. In this section, the results are grouped and plotted according to restraint system classification. Unless specified otherwise, results of the Hybrid III ATD are with the seated pelvis. TWO-POINT RESTRAINT (LAP BELT ONLY): To determine the effects of lap belt geometry on vertical excursion of the head, a range of lap belt angles and lengths were tested with the Hybrid III ATD and the cadaver. Hybrid III ATP with Two-Point-Restraint - Figure 3 shows the maximum Hybrid III ATD head excursion for three lap belt lengths and angles. Head excursion was highest with the 30 deg/508 mm lap belt. The combination of a shallow 30 deg angle and long 508 mm length allows the lap belt to pivot upwards relative to the seat. At steeper belt angles, increased lap belt length had little effect on maximum head excursion, due to limited rotation of the belt. 4029</page><page sequence="7">Figure 3. Hybrid III ATD head excursion in static, dynamic and post-dynamic-test inversion for different lap belt angles and lengths Figure 4 illustrates the superimposed outlines of the Hybrid III ATD positions from two frames of the side view camera during a dynamic lap belt test. Increasing the initial lap belt angle reduced head excursion because the shallow-angled belt rotates to a more vertical position before offering vertical restraint as compared to the steeper-angled belt. As also shown in Figure 4 (left), the 30 deg lap belt rotated approximately 13 deg upward, whereas the 75 deg belt rotated 9 deg upward (right). Changing the lap belt angle from 30 deg to 53 deg reduced excursion more than changing it from 53 deg to 75 deg. 4030</page><page sequence="8">Figure 4. Rotation of 30 deg and 75 deg (508 mm) lap belts (Unshaded: initial upright position; shaded: post-dynamic-test inverted position) The Hybrid III ATD was tested with both pelvis types. Lap-belt-only tests with the seated pelvis averaged about 20 mm more static vertical head excursion than tests with the pedestrian pelvis, and averaged about 35 mm more when measured under the dynamic and post- dynamic-test conditions. Comparison between Hybrid III ATP and Cadaver Responses with Two-Point Restraint - Figure 5 shows the Hybrid III ATD and cadaver peak vertical excursion for shallow, middle and steep lap belt angles. The vertical head excursion was, on average, about 135 mm greater for the cadaver than for the Hybrid III ATD for all belt geometries and roll types. Figure 5.

Tests with the cadaver resulted in more vertical excursion than tests with the Hybrid III ATD. This higher excursion is due in part to more lap compliance and lumbar flexibility in the cadaver than in the Hybrid III ATD. The cadaver torso also pivoted forward, away from the seat back, while the Hybrid III ATD did not (Fig. 6). Figure 6. Hybrid III ATD and cadaver responses when restrained with a two-point 53 deg/330 mm lap belt. (Unshaded: initial upright position; shaded: post-dynamic-test inverted position) THREE-POINT RESTRAINT (COMBINED LAP AND TORSO BELT): To determine the effects of torso belt geometry on vertical head excursion, the lap belt was fixed at the 53 deg/330 mm position, and a range of torso belt angles and lengths were tested with the Hybrid III ATD. Hybrid III ATP with Three-Point-Restraint - Tests using the Hybrid III ATD with a seated pelvis were conducted to evaluate the effect of three different torso belt angles and lengths on vertical head excursion (Table 1). These tests were run with the 53 deg/330 mm lap belt and with a sliding latch plate. Head excursion was reduced when the torso belt anchor was in closer proximity to the shoulder. Increasing the torso belt angle from -10 deg to -80 deg added 30 mm of excursion in the post-dynamic-test inverted position, while increasing the torso belt length from 102 to 406 mm produced an additional 20 mm of excursion. The primary benefits of the torso belt in these tests seems to be preventing forward rotation of the torso and providing vertical restraint on the shoulder. All of the torso belt geometries were effective in reducing forward rotation, but only the shallow-angled torso belts provided vertical restraint to the shoulder. 4032</page><page sequence="10">Table 1.

Sliding vs. Cinching Latch Plates - The dynamic vertical excursions were compared using two latch plate designs: 1) the sliding latch plate which allows torso webbing to transfer to the lap loop, and 2) the cinching latch plate which prevents transfer of the torso belt webbing into the lap segment under dynamic occupant loading. Tests were carried out with the Hybrid III ATD for the middle configuration lap belt (53 deg/330 mm) and the three torso belt angles. With the Hybrid III ATD hanging inverted after each test, the amount of webbing that had passed through the latch plate was recorded. There was no webbing transfer for the cinching latch plate, while there was an average transfer of about 50 mm (from the torso to the lap segment of the belt) in the three tests using a sliding latch plate. However, latch plate design had little effect on vertical head excursion. One additional test was run using the cinching latch plate with about 51 mm of slack intentionally introduced to the lap belt. This change resulted in about 35 mm increase in post-dynamic-test head excursion over the "no slack/no tension" condition. Comparison between Hybrid III ATP. Cadaver and Volunteer Responses with Three-Point Restraint - In static tests, the head excursion of the cadaver, In static tests, the head excursion of the cadaver, Hybrid III ATD and human volunteers were compared (Table 2). Please note the mass differences between the subjects. Compared to the Hybrid III ATD, the cadaver had 12% more mass and the volunteers had 22% and 8% more mass. The results are not normalized for mass differences, because mass is only one of many factors unaccounted for, such as posture, muscle tone and anthropometric differences, which can affect the results. The Hybrid III ATD had significantly less static vertical excursion than the cadaver and volunteers. Table 2.

Figure 7 shows the lateral and vertical excursions for the subjects when wearing a -45 deg/254 mm torso belt and 53 deg/ 330 mm lap belt for three positions: initial upright (1), maximum dynamic lateral (2), and post- dynamic-test inverted (3). The head positions were traced from a video screen, the relative positions were scaled off the image, and the head-mounted scale in the view was used as a reference. The cadaver's head had 4033</page><page sequence="11">about 80 mm more vertical and 120 mm more lateral excursion than the Hybrid III ATD's head, and had more lateral bending of the neck. The lateral position of the cadaver resulted in less vertical excursion during the dynamic phase of the test, because it was not aligned vertically. The Hybrid III lateral movement was clearly limited by shoulder contact with the plywood side panel, resulting in a slight lateral bending of the neck. The appearance of the torso belt during contact with the side panel suggests that there was little lateral load in the torso belt. In tests with the cadaver, however, the lateral movement did not stop until there was significant compression of the lower left portion of the neck by the torso belt. Figure 7. Vertical and lateral head excursion of cadaver and Hybrid III ATD with lap belt (53 deg/330 mm) and torso belt (-45 deg/254 mm) (Unshaded: cadaver; shaded: Hybrid III ATD) Pretensioner - The potential benefit of seat belt pretensioning was evaluated by applying pre-test static tension to the buckle anchor and measuring its effect on both lateral and vertical head excursions. All pretension tests were run with the lap and torso belt anchors in their middle positions (torso belt: -45 deg/254 mm; lap belt: 53 deg/ 330 mm) using a continuous loop three-point belt and a sliding latch plate. For pretension tests, the inboard lap belt anchor was replaced with a clamp through which webbing could be pulled. Pretension loads of 222, 445 and 667 N were applied to the inboard belt webbing in line with the lap belt angle. The amount of webbing pulled through the clamp was measured. The volunteers and cadaver had significantly more compliance in the pelvic region than the Hybrid III ATD. The 667 N pretension tightened the webbing 67 mm for Volunteer 1 , 76 mm for Volunteer 2, an average of 85 mm for the cadaver, 42 mm for the Hybrid III ATD with a pedestrian pelvis, and 43 mm for the seated pelvis (Table 3). Tests on the volunteers were carried out statically, while tests on the cadaver were both static and dynamic. No pretension tests were performed with the Hybrid III ATD. The volunteers noted that the various pretension loads induced a noticeable increase in their adherence to the seat during the inversion. For each test subject, the 667 N pretensioning typically reduced vertical head excursion by about 100 mm (Fig. 8). 4034</page><page sequence="12">Table 3 : Lap/torso force deflection data for Hybrid III ATD, cadaver and human volunteers for pretensioning loads Pretensioner Length of Webbing Pulled Through the Inboard Lap Belt Anchor Due to Pretensioning Load Hybrid III ATD | I I (N) Pedestrian Pelvis Seated Pelvis Cadaver Volunteer 1 Volunteer 2 (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) (mm) 223 23 I 23 38 25 41 445 36 32 60 48 54 667 42 43 il 67 76 86 Volunteer and Cadaver Head Excursions at Different Belt Pretensions 180 i 1 1 1 1 1 1 r g 160 - - * - Volunteer 1 - Static - ^ --A" Volunteer 2 - Static ‚ñ†2 140 2^. ¬ª ~h - Cadaver - Static √® a. n. * -¬Æ - Cadaver - Dynamic 0 120 a. 1 ,0¬∞- I 6o- 40 I I I I I I I I 0 100 200 300 400 500 600 700 Pretension (N) Figure 8.

Vertical and lateral head excursion of cadaver with and without pretension loads (Unshaded: 9 N load; shaded: 667 N load) Effects of Restraining Leas- To determine the effect of restraining the legs on head excursion, one cadaver test was conducted using the middle three-point belt configuration and with unrestrained legs. Figure 10 shows the cadaver with maximum vertical leg displacement in the post-dynamic-test inverted position. The head excursion was about 25 mm greater for the restrained than for the unrestrained legs. Figure 10. Differences in cadaver leg displacement at post-dynamic-test inverted position for restrained and unrestrained legs 4036</page><page sequence="14">REPEATABILITY: The repeatability of the overall test method was assessed by analyzing results of duplicate tests carried out on the Hybrid III ATD, cadaver and volunteers. Tests were shown to be repeatable within 10 percent. However, the two tests of the Hybrid III ATD with the pedestrian pelvis were not as repeatable. DISCUSSION The use of the cadaver and human volunteers allows evaluation of the biofidelity of the Hybrid III ATD in rollover testing. The lateral excursion of the Hybrid III ATD torso when impacting the side panel in dynamic tests is greatly restricted by its rigid shoulder girdle as compared to the cadaver. Likewise, the lateral bending stiffness of the Hybrid III ATD neck is significantly greater than that of the cadaver at these low loads and slow loading rates because the Hybrid III ATD neck was designed to replicate the viscoelastic response of the human neck under impact conditions. As a result, the Hybrid III ATD head lateral motion is significantly less than the cadaver. The pelvic/thigh flesh compliance of the Hybrid III ATD is also significantly stiffer than the static response of the human volunteers or the viscoelastic response in the dynamic cadaver tests. The combination of the rigidity of the thoracic spine, pelvic stiffness and lumbar and cervical spine stiffness for the Hybrid III ATD at these low loads resulted in reduced vertical and lateral excursion in the Hybrid III ATD relative to what would be expected for humans in rollover crashes. The cadaver had 80 mm more vertical excursion and 120 mm more lateral excursion than the Hybrid III ATD (Fig. 7). The 667 N pretensioning of the inboard buckle webbing reduced the head excursion by 100 to 125 mm for the cadaver and volunteers. This pretensioning was applied prior to each test by pulling webbing through the inboard anchor clamp with the subject seated statically upright. In an actual rollover crash it is unlikely that the pretension would be reacting against a statically seated occupant. However, the tests in this study were carried out using a noncompliant plywood seat. The benefit of pretensioning may be higher with a compliant seat than a plywood seat if the subject could be pulled more deeply into the seat with early pretensioning. This data suggests that early pretensioning in rollover crashes offers significant reduction in head excursion. The goal of improved lap/torso belt geometry and pretensioners is to reduce the likelihood of head impact with the roof and partial ejection through the adjacent window. This likelihood, however, is dictated in part by the proximity of those areas to the head in the vehicle. Obviously, if a belted occupant is limited to 75 mm of head excursion but starts with a head-to-roof clearance of only 50 mm, he will still contact the roof even if there is no roof crush. The objective of this paper is to answer the question, "What is the benefit of improved belt design to limit head excursion in rollovers?" For the average adult occupant who is seated adjacent to a significant roof-to-ground impact, unfortunately, there is probably no benefit. This situation is similar to side impacts where the seat belt provides little protection to the occupant who is seated near the point of impact. However, there are other situations where a reduction of head excursion clearly would be beneficial. Short stature adults and children, who sit with significantly more head room, might be prevented from hitting their heads on roof structures with appropriately configured restraint systems. Also, as noted by Or≈Çowski et al. (1985), rollover roof deformation spreads as a "contact patch" as the roof panel flattens to conform to the ground. The likelihood of significant head impact is greatly increased if the belted occupant strikes his head on the inside of the contact patch because he is in reality striking the ground with a layer of roof in between. Limiting head excursion through improved belt performance would benefit the occupant whose head is consequently prevented from reaching the inside of the contact patch. Various factors must be considered when optimizing the design of a restraint system. Tradeoffs are always necessary. For example, a belt designed with a steep lap belt angle can minimize vertical head excursion in a rollover, but may increase occupant injury risk in a frontal collision. The data obtained in this study provides information to improve the rollover protection offered by future restraint systems, but no effort has been made here to address all the other crash configurations that must be considered. CONCLUSIONS 1. The Hybrid III ATD is stiffer in rollover conditions than the human volunteer (in static test only) and cadaver subjects (in static and dynamic tests). Statically, the Hybrid III ATD averaged about 65 mm less vertical head excursion than the volunteers and cadaver when restrained in a three-point belt with a sliding latch plate. Combining the dynamic and post- dynamic-test results, the Hybrid III ATD averaged about 70 mm less vertical head excursion than the cadaver. 2. Vertically-angled lap belts reduce vertical excursion most effectively. Shallow angle and long lap belts pivot upward and provide the least vertical restraint. 3. Torso belts reduce vertical head excursion primarily by restricting forward rotation of the torso. All torso belt geometries did this equally well. A torso belt whose D-ring is close to the shoulder provides an additional benefit from vertical restraint to the shoulder. 4. Early application of pretensioner loads can significantly reduce head excursion. 4037</page><page sequence="15">ACKNOWLEDGMENTS This research was sponsored by Failure Analysis Associates, Inc. and Biomech, Inc.
