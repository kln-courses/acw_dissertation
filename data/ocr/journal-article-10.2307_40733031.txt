<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paideuma35, 1989 SOUTH OF NORTH: SHAMANISM IN AFRICA A Neglected Theme I.M.LEWIS I "We have omitted Africa", so Mircea Eliade concludes his regional survey of shamanism in his classic work, Shamanism: Archaic Techniques of Ecstasy (1951, 1972: 374), in a pre- gnant footnote. It is rather ironical that Eliade should make this statement. For he is largely responsible for thrusting into general currency a conception of shamanism - which he re- presents as that of the classical Tungus institution - which has led subsequent authorities, such as Luc de Heusch (1971 : 273), to claim that shamanism is in fact rare in Africa. Others, for instance Michel Leiris (1968, 1980: 37), have asserted the opposite, stating that the phenomenon is "widely distributed in Africa". I share Leiris's view that shamanism is com- mon in Africa and, in what follows, will attempt to substantiate this assessment (not, of course, exhaustively). I shall also suggest reasons, including Eliade's influence on terminolo- gy, for this, as I see it, mis-reading of the evidence from Africa. II A cursory glance at the anthropological literature on African religious phenomena would certainly suggest that, in contrast to other areas (especially America), shamanism is indeed rare here. References to 'spirit -possession' occur frequently in relation to most parts of Africa, both in the context of indigenous religion and following the introduction (and ac- ceptance) of Islam and Christianity. But explicit reports of 'shamanism' are remarkably rare. Since I have not had the time or resources to make a systematic search of all the African literature, I would hesitate to claim that references to African 'shamans' and 'shamanism' could be counted on one hand. But this is almost the position or was so until recently. Cer- tainly the exceptions stand out. Notable amongst these are: S.F. Nadel (1946) writing about the Nuba peoples of the Sudan; R.E.S. Tanner on the Sukuma of Tanzania (1955); Jan Van- sina on the Kuba of Central Africa (1958); Michel Leiris on Ethiopian Zar (1958) and Eike Haberland (1960, 1963) on the same subject in southern Ethiopia. For the moment I arbi- trarily take the end of the 1960s as a cut-off point since 'shaman' seems to become some- what more prominent in Africanist circles in the 1970s partly, I flatter myself, following the publication of two comparative studies of my own (Lewis, 1966 and 1971). What, we must at once ask, do these anthropologists mean by the term 'shaman'? Let us take them in chronological order. Nadel uses 'shaman' to translate the Nyima term kujur which is applied to spirit-inspired priests who divine the future and diagnose and treat illness at seances while in trance states. The spirits involved here are anthropomorphic. They come to the shaman 'from outside' and when he is in trance gain hold of his body. In trance, the spirit 'mounts' the shaman as a rider does a horse and 'enters his head'. While actively pos-</page><page sequence="2">182 I.M.Lewis sessing the shaman in the seance trance, at other times the spirit is passively incarnated and only normally leaves the shaman on his death when it may return to the limbo where spirits dwell, or seek reincarnation in another shaman. The shamanic vocation, which may be announced in dreams, by some dramatic misfortune or in other ways, represents a public 'ideal', a position of considerable status and a source of wealth. This religious cult, Nadel specifically contends, "corresponds in all essentials to the classical shamanism of Central Asia and N. West America ... it rests on the belief that spirits may possess human beings, and on the practice of establishing communication with the supernatural through human beings so possessed. The person possessed - the shaman - is more than merely a temporary and passive medium through which others place themselves en rapport with the spirit world . . . through his ability to induce possession he is also a master of these supernatural powers." Tanner applies the term shaman to priests, inspired by ancestor spirits, who play similar divinatory and therapeutic roles among the Sukuma. They control their own supernatural power and, with the aid of swishing rattles, are able to induce possession in themselves and others in healing seances. Speaking in tongues is a characteristic feature of shamanic trance. Vansina similarly refers to the ecstatic priests of the Kuba, who are possessed by nature spirits, and conduct trance seances, as 'shamans'. As in the Nuba Hills, here the shamanic career is typically assumed in the form of an annunciation, and shamans are referred to as 'divine healers', curing with the help of their spirit guides or familiars! Leiris in his analysis of the Zar cult at Gondar, Ethiopia, makes specific and systematic comparisons between its cardinal features and those of Siberian shamanism. (The more re- cent study by American anthropologist, Allan Young [1975], also employs the term shaman in analysing Zar roles.) We are concerned here with a cult which exists peripherally in am- biguous tension with Christianity and Islam and the majority of whose followers are women or men of low status. Recruitment takes the form of an initiatory illness, or affliction (as often also in Siberian shamanism) and the most committed adepts are likely to graduate to become shamanic cult- group leaders, conducting diagnostic and therapeutic seances with the aid of their helping spirits. The spirits involved include the children of early Ethiopian emperors as well as numerous Islamic saints. These and other powers regularly 'mount' their human vehicles or 'horses', particularly in the dramatic seances in which devotees honour them with dance, ritual and sacrificial offerings. Each spirit speaks (through its mount) in speech indicating its provenance and has its own signature tune, dance gestures and style. Chronically pos- sessed women - regular adepts - are in effect 'married' to their (male) spirit familiars. As well as exacting expensive gifts of clothes, jewellry etc. for their spirits, female adepts parti- cipate in what is in effect a mystery religion, where trance is cultivated as a religious ex- perience. Variously elaborated, all these features of the Zar cult, which fetishises illness and affliction, are found widely diffused throughout much of northeast Africa, the Sudan, Egypt, the Maghreb and, outside Africa, in the Persian Gulf to which the Zar cult seems to have spread in the 19th century.1 In these four cases it is apparent that the term 'shaman' is being applied to a person of either sex who has mastery over spirits, who incarnates spirits and becomes actively pos- 1 For a fuller discussion of zar, see Haberland, 1960: 142-150 and 1963: 505 ff.; Lewis, 1971: 75-9, 97-102 and 1986: 100-105; Natvig, 1987.</page><page sequence="3">South of North: Shamanism in Africa 183 sessed in trance in the controlled context of the seance. This usage is in complete harmony with that of the Tungus from which the term shaman derives.2 As our main authority here, S.M. Shirokogoroff (1935: 269), records: "In all the Tungus languages the term (shaman) refers to persons of both sexes who have mastered spirits, who at their will can introduce these spirits into themselves and use their power over their spirits in their own interest, parti- cularly helping other people who suffer from the spirits." The shaman's body is a temple or tabernacle for the spirits, a vehicle or receptacle, which Shirokogoroff himself calls a 'placing' and distinguishes from an icon. Shamans and Shamanism (meaning the associated cult phenomena) are far more general in Africa than these isolated references suggest. Although usually described in terms of spirit- possession and spirit-mediumship, parallel phenomena can be found in virtually every part of the continent. Although their social contexts vary, this for instance applies I think to the various spirit-cults in west, central, southern and east Africa described and discussed under the cautious title of Spirit Mediumship and Society in Africa by Beattie and Middleton (1969). In this volume M. J. Field and R. Horton discuss male and female spirit incarnating priests (i.e. shamans) in Ghana and Nigeria and P. Verger describes Nago-Yoruba and Fon shamans in Dahomey who are the wives of the gods (prishas and voduns). This cult, of course, is of particular interest since it is partly the source of Haitian voodoo (as well as other Latin American ecstatic syncretic religions). The Tonga and Shona mediums examined by Colson and Garbett have the same shamanic features, as do those of the Zulu, Banyoro, the Segeju, Somali, Lugbara, Alur, Sukuma - reported on respectively by Lee, Beattie, Gray, Lewis, Middleton, Southall, Tanner and Welbourn. As I have indicated elsewhere (Lewis 1971), many other shamanic cults, however unre- cognised, can be found in this Africanist literature. Prominent examples are: the famous Hausa bori cult,3 the west African analogue of the east African Zar cult with which it inter- sects in North Africa and the Sudan, the rab cult among the Lebou and Wolof (Zempleni, 1966) and, moving back to east Africa, the waka cult among the Oromo (Haberland, 1963; Knutsson, 1967) and the jok cult among the Dinka (and other Nilotes) (Lienhardt, 1961). In contrast to these examples, where shamanism has generally passed unacknowledged, there are now a number of recent reports of other shamanistic African (or peri-African) cults. These include those of the Islamised Zaramo of Tanzania (Swantz, 1970), the Zinza bacwe- ri cult (also in Tanzania) (Bjerke, 1981) and, off the coast, similar cults on the islands of Mafia (Caplan, 1975) and Mayotte (Lambek, 1981). Ill Part of the responsibility for not recognising the importance of shamanism in Africa earlier (and indeed for still failing to recognise it when it occurs) can, I think, be attributed to the misleading conception of the phenomenon developed by Mircea Eliade. Purporting to take 2 It has also been proposed that the term may ultimately be of Indian origin - from the Vedic sram : see Lewis, 1986: 114. ó writing at tne turn oi me century, Leo rro Dennis canea tne tsoniLar complex, tne Airican variety oi Shamanism', Frobenius, 1913: 561.

Lewis his readers back to the original Siberian Tungus sources, Eliade presents the shaman as an inspired priest who in ecstatic trance states ascends - in spirit or soul - to the heavens on mystical flights. There he meets and communes with the celestial powers in the interests of his fellow men. Spirit possession is not directly involved here. "The specific element of shamanism", according to Eliade (1972: 434), "is not the incorporation of spirits by the shamans but the ecstasy provoked by the ascension to the sky or by the descent to hell: the incorporation of spirits and possession by them are universally distributed phenomena, but they do not belong necessarily to shamanism in the strict sense". For Eliade these two ele- ments belong to different historical periods. "The celestial ascent of the shaman is a survival, profoundly modified and sometimes degenerated, of the archaic religious ideology - centred on faith in a Celestial Supreme Being ... the descent to Hell, the fight against evil spirits, and ... the increasingly familiar relationships with spirits which aim at their incorporation or at the possession of the shaman by them, are all innovations . . ." So, according to Eliade, there are two historical strata, or evolutionary stages: the authentic shamanistic celestial ascent, and the subsidiary and diluting possession by spirits. The former - 'pure shamanism' (sometimes called 'white shamanism') in company with other writers, Eliade tends to associate with pre-historic Siberian hunter-gatherers and paleolithic cave art. Without accepting these evolutionary assumptions, the Belgian structuralist anthropologist, Luc de Heusch (1962) has developed this dichotomy between celestial ascent and spirit pos- session into an intriguing and very ambitious theory of contrasting religious phenomena. Shamanism is considered an 'ascensual metaphysic' (a depossession) and opposed to pos- session which is treated as an incarnation. Like Eliade, de Heusch treats these as characteri- stic of different cosmologies and religions. He draws a distinction between involuntary pos- session by evil spirits which are exorcised, and voluntary possession by good spirits which are incorporated. The first process de Heusch identifies as 'inauthentic' possession, the second as 'authentic'. By applying the same distinctions to shamanism, the following four-fold matrix is generated: Insertion of soul/spirit Expulsion of soul/spirit Adoricism Exorcism Shamanism A (Shaman restores soul to Shamanism B (Shaman extracts patient - i.e. cures soul loss) cause of sickness from patient) Extraction of foreign entity Possession A Possession B ('authentic') ('inauthentic') More recently, partly in response to criticism, de Heusch (1971: 245-285) has modified his rather rigid original prototype, seeking to trace 'transformations' between the four ca- tegories of religious phenomena distinguished - which he tends to see as various types of trance. This has led him to conclude that 'authentic shamanism' scarcely exists in Africa. Specifically rejecting those earlier African examples, described as shamanism, by Nadel, Tan- ner and Vansina (but neglecting Leiris's work) with which we began, de Heusch can find only one African example of the genuine article: the Venda 'mad doctor' who is 'clairvoyant', endowed with 'the extraordinary facility of seeing the spirits, of discovering them, of know-</page><page sequence="5">South of North: Shamanism in Africa 185 ing their secrets and with the power of exorcising them'.4 Thus the disciple of Eliade, elaborating his basic conceptions about shamanism, reaches, in effect, the ironical conclusion that if Eliade neglected Africa he was right to do so! Although they do not necessarily accept his negative conclusion about African shamanism, others - such as Erika Bourguignon (1976) - have followed much the same path, taking as a point of departure the distinction between 'authentic' and 'inauthentic' possession. Less subtly than de Heusch, Bourguignon - as I have pointed out elsewhere (Lewis, 1986) seeks to divide the cultures (and societies) of the world into those where possession occurs without trance (P) and those where possession and trance (PT) are coterminous. The problem with all these formulations, however ingenious, is that they suppose that specific religions or qualities of religious experience are characteristic of particular cultures and societies. In reality the spectrum of mystical experience within a single culture is likely to embrace all those states so far distinguished. We can easily establish this, and verify how aptly our African data fit this pattern, by referring to the classic Tungus ethnography. The Tungus distinguish between possession (P) and possession-trance (PT) and between 'desired' and 'undesired' possession by benign and evil forces. All these are integral parts of the composite shamanistic complex. Within this context, the distinction stressed by de Heusch and Bourguignon between 'inauthentic' (negative) and 'authentic' (positive) possession experiences corresponds to sequential phases or stages in the stereotypical model for the assumption of the shamanic career. Although not all inauthentic/ negative possession experiences necessarily have this outcome - the response to some may be exorcism - they regularly constitute a typical stage in the process of shamanic initiation. More fundamentally still, de Heusch and Eliade are mistaken in seeing possession and shama- nism as intrinsically opposed or mutually exclusive phenomena. As we have seen, the Tungus shaman is literally a master of spirits. Frequently the shaman permanently incarnates spirits in his own body which may manifest themselves when he is shamanising in trance in a public seance. The spirits involved here cannot, Shirokogoroff (1935: 121-122) insists, be simply categorised as 'good' or 'bad' and treated accordingly, for the Tungus do not classify spirits in this simple, unambiguous way. According to the Tungus, any spirit can be malevolent, benevolent or neutral, depending on the context in which it manifests itself and whether or not it is 'mastered' by a shaman. Eliade's representation of Tungus shamanism (attributed to Shirokogoroff) emphasizes the theme of mystical flight to the 'upper world' (further elaborated in de Heusch's notion of 'ascensual metaphysic'), but Shirokogoroff actually reports that the Tungus shaman's mystical voyages more frequently take him to the 'lower world'. In many instances shamanism is not concerned with either of these realms, but with mastering spirits in this world. In all circumstances, the essence of the Tungus shaman's role, Shirokogoroff insists, lies in his ability to incorporate potentially dangerous spirits in his own body, so neutralising or 'mastering' them. No one is considered a shaman unless he can control spirits and introduce them or expel them at will. The onset of the shaman's vocation is typically announced by a traumatic experience associated with hysteroid behaviour interpreted by the Tungus as un- controlled possession. It is the mastering of these spirits and the control of the ecstasy as- 4 A more recent contributor (Mary, 1983) to the debate expands on de Heusch's argument here, propos- ing a clear dichotomy between visionary shamanism on the one hand and possession on the other. I find the distinction unconvincing.</page><page sequence="6">186 I.M.Lewis sociated with them that marks the shaman's role. Such controlled ecstasy in the shamanic seance is stimulated by various techniques including: staring fixedly into a brass mirror (it- self a spirit 'placing'); drumming and singing ; inhaling resinous smoke; drinking large cups of Vodka, or smoking pipes of tobacco. Finally, we should note that among the Tungus, the power to control spirits which is the essence of the shaman's role can diminish with age and in competition with rival shamans seeking to demonstrate their superior spirit mastery. Thus, for the Tungus as for the African possession cults to which I have referred, we can now construct an ideal model of shamanic initiation. Here an initial traumatic experience or illness, interpreted as possession, is typically the introduction to a progressive involvement with spirits leading to the assumption of the roles of spirit medium and the more active, managerial role of shaman - master or mistress of spirits. Of course, the ambiguity of the initial possession experience permits two contrasting responses - either the accommodation and domestication or taming, implying increasing mastery by the human host, invoked in our model of shamanic initiation; or, the contrary response of exorcism and rejection of the shamanic career. As Anna-Leena Siikala (1978) has recently acutely pointed out, these ap- parently contradictory interpretations are, paradoxically, likely to be mutually reinforcing. Actually, the unsolicited, uncontrolled and essentially traumatic nature of the initial spiritual encounter, heralding the shamanic vocation, demonstrates beyond all doubt the bona fides of the new recruit as one pressed, against his will, into the service of the spirits. This is the hall-mark of the authentic mystical calling. As our diagram illustrates there are three major phases in the assumption of the shamanic vocation: Episodic model of the ecstatic I shamanistic career Phase I Phasell Phase III 'involuntary accommodated uncontrolled unsolicited' domesticated controlled, voluntary solicited trance possession (or other seizure e.g. illness or other trauma) Patient Healer INITIATION RITE (cliché: agony and ecstasy) TRAUMATIC ANNUNCIATION OF DIVINE CALLING Having learnt to master spirits and to control ecstasy the shaman can, of course, in a single seance readily move through the roles or states distinguished by the terms 'possession' (and/or soul-loss), spirit medium, and mastery of spirits (shaman proper).</page><page sequence="7">South of North: Shamanism in Africa 187 IV Having now, I hope, recaptured the authentic spirit of the Tungus shaman which has been so misconstrued by Eliade, de Heusch and others, we can venture to define the wider con- cept of shamanism. In my opinion, this is best specified along the lines proposed by the So- viet specialist V.N. Basilov (1981) as a 'cult whose central idea is the belief in the ability of some individuals chosen by some spirits to communicate with them while in a state of ecsta- sy and perform the functions of an intermediary between the world of spirits and the given human collective.' The specific cultural content in which this is couched is highly variable. It does not matter how the balance between possession and soul-flight is pitched, whether a tripartite cosmology is present, or whether the theme of the 'cosmic world tree' (delineated by Vivianne Paques, 1964) is stressed. These and many other symbolic motifs, in various combinations and proportions, are widely, if not universally, associated with shamanism. Similarly, as with other religious phenomena whether in its classical Tungus setting or else- where, shamanism is typically dynamic and syncretic reflecting changes in its ambient so- cioeconomic and political circumstances. Both Shirokogoroff (1935: 150, 260) in relation to the Tungus and Nadel (1946: 32) in relation to the Sudanese Nuba, rightly emphasise the innovatory role of shamans in inventing and introducing new ideas as well as in canalising novel experiences which are common to their communities. This may result in syncretic new religions, embodying elements from such World Religions as Buddhism, Hinduism, Christianity or Islam. It may also reflect and register the marginalisation of a traditional local religion, displaced by one of the World Religions. In such circumstances, a cult which was formerly of central social and political significance may become a monopoly of subordinate sections of the population - including women in male dominated societies (Lewis, 1971: 96). This is typically the situation with the widely ramifying African zar and borì cults mentioned earlier. Where such ecstatic re- ligions are unambiguously the central morality -cults of a society, shamans appear usually to be men. It is interesting that in Shirokogoroff s classic account of Tungus shamanism he re- ports that shamans are of either sex. Interpreting this in the light of his assessment that by 1920 the Tungus had generally become 'nominal' Christians (with various shamanic syncretic transformations, including that of St. Nicholas to a shaman ancestor), this might indicate the marginalisation of traditional Tungus shamanism and its increasing appropriation by women. However this may be, these remarks may perhaps serve to reinforce my view that the cultural elements of shamanism are of less significance than its socio-political role in parti- cular historical contexts. Whether in Africa or elsewhere, shamanism may play a peripheral or central role and, sometimes it would appear (possibly in transitional circumstances), both roles. I suspect that the idea that to be properly designated 'shamanism' cults should play a central rather than a peripheral role may also have contributed, together with the misap- prehensions of Eliade and de Heusch, to a serious misreading of the evidence on African shamanism. These are not the only factors involved however. The term 'shaman' diffused na- turally from Siberia across the Bering straits into North American anthropology in the wake of Franz Boas and other diffusionists. The disinclination of British structural-functionalist anthropologists to use this term, not only in Africa, but generally outside its original pro- venance is consistent with their hostility to diffusion and their preference for cross-cultural- ly neutral e tic (rather than ernie) analytical categories (cf. Lewis, 1986).</page><page sequence="8">188 I. M.
