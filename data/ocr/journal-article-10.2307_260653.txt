<plain_text><page sequence="1">Martin van Creveld The Clausewitzian Universe and the Law of War The Clausewitzian Universe, in which we live, is named after the Prussian officer and writer Carl von Clausewitz.' As a youth he took part in the campaign of 1793 and later studied at the Berlin War Academy. He went through the disastrous Jena Campaign of 1806, was captured, and upon his release entered the General Staff. In 1812 he joined the so-called German Legion, a body of anti-French officers, and stayed with it throughout the Russian campaign. Re-entering the Prussian service in 1813, he served in the Wars of Liberation. After Waterloo he became director of the Kriegsakademie and devoted his leisure to writing. In 1831, he was appointed Chief of Staff to the Prussian army which was deployed in Silesia to observe the Polish rebellion against Russia. Following the death of his superior, General August von Gneisenau, Clausewitz took over. He had only occupied his new position for a few days, however, when there arrived from Berlin another general sent to replace him. Thereupon he too fell ill and died, whether of cholera or heartbreak is not clear. Clausewitz's writings span a period of almost thirty years. His magnum opus, Vom Kriege (On War), in which he invested some twelve years, was left incomplete and was published posthumously. The book's fame spread slowly at first. However, by the 1860s it had already established itself as a classic and its pre-eminent position was confirmed when Helmut von Moltke called it 'the military work which most influenced my mind'. The work was praised by Engels ('a strange way to philosophize, but, on the matter itself, very good') and read by Marx. During his stay in Zurich, Lenin provided it with perceptive footnotes. Hitler is said to have been able to quote it 'by the yard', and Eisenhower grappled with it during his days at the US Army War College. To this day, it is regarded as the greatest work on war and strategy ever written within Western civilization.2 Journal of Contemporary History (SAGE, London, Newbury Park and New Delhi), Vol. 26 (1991), 403-429.</page><page sequence="2">Journal of Contemporary History While rivers of ink have been spilt in attempts to interpret and understand On War, the work's philosophical essence - as distinct from the numerous operational lessons that it contains - may be summed up very briefly. First, Clausewitz considered war as the continuation of politics - this being perhaps the most famous single sentence of all, familiar even to those who have never read him.3 Second, as a bold-lettered headline in the first chapter of the first book informs us, it is 'an act of violence carried to its utmost bounds'.4 Never one to mince his words, Clausewitz used some of the book's most forceful passages to serve emphatic warning against introducing 'moderation' into the 'principle' of war; to him, armed force was subject to no rules except those of its own nature and those of the political purpose for which it was waged. He had no patience with the 'philanthropist' belief that war could (or should) be restrained and waged with a minimum of violence. 'In dangerous things such as war, errors made out of kindness are the worst.'5 'Let us hear no more about generals who conquer without bloodshed.' Consistent with this view, Clausewitz held that the law of war consisted of 'self-imposed restraints, hardly worth mentioning'.6 If civilized nations no longer exterminated each other in the manner of savages (those were the days before Auschwitz), this was not because of any change in the nature of war but because they had found more effective means of fighting.7 Thus, Vom Kriege dismisses the entire body of international law and custom in a single irreverent sentence. In this it set an example which has been followed by subsequent 'strategic' literature down to the present day, even to the point where works on the law of war are usually stored in some separate, slightly out of the way, library. The purpose of the present essay is to argue that such an exclusively 'instrumental' view is not correct. War, far from being the province of pure unbridled force, is a cultural activity and has always been subject to limitations pertaining to prisoners, non-combatants, and weapons, inter alia. The following first three sections will review some of these limitations, whereas the fourth and final one will discuss the reasons they are needed and the light that they shed on the nature of war. To understand how wrong Clausewitz's dismissal of international law and custom really is, consider his own fate when captured.8 Together with Prince August of Prussia, whom he was serving as ADC, he was taken to Berlin where the Prince was interviewed by 404</page><page sequence="3">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe Napoleon. The meeting over, the two young noblemen gave their word of honour to abstain from further participation in the war and were sent home. A month later they were ordered to proceed to internment in France. Their journey was leisurely enough for Clausewitz to visit Goethe in Weimar. In France they spent time first in Nancy, then in Soissons, and finally in Paris. Though the authorities kept an eye on them, they moved about freely and frequented the best social circles. The sojourn ended after ten months when, following the Treaty of Tilsit, they were allowed to go home. Clausewitz, at that time, was a captain. Had he been captured in some modern conflict - say, in Italy or France during the second world war- his fate would have been quite different. He would have been taken to an interrogation centre, possibly after being deliber- ately starved and roughly handled for a day or two. International law would have required him to disclose his name, rank, serial number and blood type, no more. Nevertheless, had he impressed the interrogators as one in possession of important information they would have tried to wrest it out of him. This phase over, he would have been sent away and locked behind barbed wire in a prisoner of war camp. He would not have been asked to give his word that he would not try to escape: on the contrary, as an officer and a gentleman it would have been his duty to try. So long as he did not take up weapons or kill a guard, even repeated attempts to escape would not have constituted an offence and would not have been supposed to be punished.9 In practice, German prisoners in Allied camps were reasonably, though by no means luxuriously, looked after. Allied prisoners in German hands generally received similar treatment. In Russia, however, the Germans shot Red Army Commissars out of hand. Other prisoners who survived the subsequent death-marches were herded into the usual camps where hundreds of thousands were deliberately starved and frozen to death.'? The Soviets also ill-treated German prisoners, but not as much as the Germans had mistreated them; normally it was only captured SS who were killed. Allied personnel in Japanese hands suffered atrociously. Apparently their treatment did not result from systematic brutality ordered by the top, but merely reflected the normal way in which Japanese commanders slapped and kicked their own subordinates. Finally, Japanese servicemen were told that the Allies took no prisoners and often preferred suicide to captivity; Japanese troops who were taken prisoner, however, generally received decent treatment." 405</page><page sequence="4">Journal of Contemporary History Had Clausewitz been captured four decades earlier, i.e. during the Seven Years War, his fate would also have been different. Very likely he would still have been well treated, even invited to wine and dine with his opposite numbers.12 Having promised not to escape, a captive officer would have been free to move about, even contact his friends and relatives on the other side. However, his final release would have had to wait until after the payment of a ransom. The sum involved depended on rank. In Clausewitz's case it might have amounted to a few thousand French livres, say up to three years' income for one of his station in life. It was a sign of the growing professionalization of armies that, towards 1789, the question of ransom ceased to concern individuals. Instead it was taken over by governments which negotiated with the enemy, fixed prices, and settled accounts.'3 Had Clausewitz been captured during the War of the Spanish Succession (1701-14), however, the ransom would have had to come out of his own pocket. Nor would he have been reimbursed except, perhaps, by throwing himself on the King's mercy and pleading 'difficult circumstances'.'4 Looking further back to the early modern period and the late Middle Ages, armies qua armies did not take prisoners at all; this was done only by individual soldiers who might or might not grant quarter when asked. Once their surrender had been accepted, the prisoners' persons and property belonged to their captors. A prisoner considered sufficiently important (and rich) might find himself well housed and well looked after; he might be invited to wine and dine at his captor's table where an exchange of elaborate compliments would also take place.'5 At the other end of the scale, captives might be harshly treated, both as a punishment for transgressions committed and in order to make them pay up quickly. Regarded as private property, it was not rare for the 'catch' to become the subject of disputes among different would-be captors. The natural authority to settle such disputes was the commander who, in this way, was able to demand and receive one-third of all ransoms.'6 Medieval Livres de chevalerie and early modern treatises on international law agreed that noble prisoners - the only kind considered worth bothering with - should not be mistreated without cause. Some thought captors were within their rights to apply pressure to captives in order to force them to pay, others not. Scholars debated whether a prisoner might be, to quote Honore Bonet, 'held in a high tower', put in chains, or otherwise constrained.17 Prisoners caught trying to escape were regarded as having broken their word, 406</page><page sequence="5">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe though there was no unanimity on the kind of penalty involved. Until about 1450, prisoners who made good their escape might have their arms displayed in reverse, a grievous insult. The act of asking and granting quarter was supposed to establish a treaty akin to an ordinary IOU. Regarded as an investment, prisoners could be sold, bartered or otherwise transferred by one captor to another without their respective rights and duties being affected. Just as today we have the white flag, so the medieval chivalric code had certain widely recognized verbal formulae and signals by which intent to surrender could be conveyed.'8 The ideas of previous ages concerning prisoners other than officers also differed from our own. Whereas modern international law makes few distinctions between the two categories, pre-democratic societies treated them as if they belonged to two different races. The eighteenth century took the view that uncommissioned personnel had no honour and, accordingly, could not be put on parole. They would be held in the cellars of a fortress and rented out as hired labour if the opportunity presented itself. Thus they were in no position to make arrangements for paying their own ransom; nor was it possible to extract very much from men who were, in the Duke of Wellington's famous phrase, 'the scum of the earth, enlisted for drink'. During the War of the Austrian Succession, a common soldier's ransom was fixed at 4 livres as opposed to 250,000 for a marechal de France.19 Apparently even that sum was paid not by the soldier but, following the general settling of accounts, by the state. In a period when sieges were more numerous than battles, a soldier's fate might depend on the circumstances under which the surrender had taken place. Particularly during the early eighteenth century, sieges rarely had to be pushed to a bloody conclusion. Vauban, Coehorn, and their colleagues had so perfected siege- warfare that it became a question of scientifically applying cannon to walls. Granted sound logistics, this left little doubt about the outcome, attackers and defenders alike being able to forecast the length of time an operation would last with considerable precision. It became normal practice for the two sides to agree that, if no 'succour' arrived within a given time, the garrison would surrender. The surrender-instrument took the form of a legal document. While terms varied, very often the defending commander undertook to deliver fortress, equipment and stores intact. In return, he and his army were allowed to evacuate the fortress and proceed where they wished. Sometimes they gave their word not to fight again, sometimes not.20 407</page><page sequence="6">Journal of Contemporary History The agreement having been signed, a belle capitulation was arranged. A mixed party of officers was sent to verify the contents of the fortress's storerooms. The two sides might join forces to enlarge the breach in the wall so as to enable the ceremony to take place in some splendour;21 often an artist was commissioned to paint the occasion. As the garrison came marching out, drums beating and banners flying, the victors formed a guard of honour. To sweeten the pill, officers were usually allowed to retain their personal effects such as arms, horses, carriages, servants and mistresses. Such arrangements saved the besieged force for fighting another day, or at any rate obviated the need for paying ransom; hence they normally received the blessing of governments. There is even a case on record when Louis XIV threatened to cashier an officer because, alone in his garrison, he 'presumptuously' refused to surrender.22 Another factor which shaped attitudes to prisoners was the cosmopolitan character of warfare. Early modern governments down to the eighteenth century gladly employed foreigners in their armed services. Many armies contained entire units consisting of non- nationals. Some were volunteers, but troops might also be sold or rented out en bloc by their princes, as happened to the Hessians who did much of Britain's fighting during the War of the American Revolution. When such soldiers and such formations were taken prisoner they were sometimes made to change sides. In 1756, Frederick II impressed an entire Saxon army, promising a bounty to those who joined more or less voluntarily, and making liberal use of the knout to persuade those who did not.23 This particular case owes its fame to the fact that it was among the last. However, between about 1500 and 1650 it had been standard practice, exciting scant comment. Still, even during this period there were exceptions. If the war was considered a rebellion, or if religious ideas were at stake, the treatment that prisoners could expect was very different. The Thirty Years War in Germany became notorious for the number of massacres. Often, as in the case of Magdeburg in 1631, they were the handiwork of a blood-crazed soldiery acting in defiance of the commander's wishes. No such explanation can be found for that famous Spanish commander, Fernando Alvarez de Toledo. Cam- paigning in the Netherlands between 1567 and 1574, he developed the nasty habit of tying the members of defeated garrisons back to back and throwing them into the fortress moat. At the battle of Agincourt (1415), Henry V of England ordered his followers to massacre their 408</page><page sequence="7">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe prisoners, which order was obeyed with some reluctance because it meant that ransom would be forfeit. The incident caused much bad publicity, and had to be justified by the claim that the French were putting their captors in danger by trying to escape en masse.24 Whatever the outcome in individual cases, the outstanding fact was that, contrary to the situation today, there was no universal rule obliging the victors to grant quarter if that was asked. Certainly the medieval chivalric code frowned on knights who did not accept an opponent's surrender. However, even in this case the defeated did not have an absolute right to be spared. Then as later, he who killed an opponent under such circumstances acquired a sinister reputation. Such a reputation might have its uses in battle, but it also exposed him to similar treatment if his fortune deserted him. Unless the dead opponent happened to be some particularly great baron and thus liable to pay a large ransom, the killer had no fear of being formally reprimanded, let alone brought to justice. As late as the early seventeenth century, wrote Hugo Grotius, it was all that the ordinary members of a defeated force could do to appeal to Christian mercy. We shall soon see that the same applied to people who did not form part of an armed force, but were nevertheless so unfortunate as to be captured. Sometimes the appeal worked, sometimes not. Very often whether it did work depended on whether the side asking for quarter looked as if he was able to pay. The fate of POWs before 1350 will not be discussed here. This is not because war in those periods was not subject to rules, nor does it mean that those rules were more - or less - important than our own. The point is that the rules exist. To understand their importance, one only needs to watch them change. Today, most people would be outraged by a system that discriminated between individual prisoners of war on the basis of their ability to respond to blackmail. Conversely, our ancestors from about 1650 to 1800 would resent and ridicule the modern system which, unwilling to recognize honour, causes captives to be housed, clothed and fed at their captors' expense. None of this is to deny that the rules of war, those concerning prisoners as well as others, are frequently violated. But they do exist, and once we give up a narrow, contemporary point of view, their role in defining what war is all about turns out to be very great. What is more, the further back into history we go, the greater the problems of terminology and classification. Our present-day legal distinctions between officers and non-commissioned personnel, soldiers and civilians, combatants and non-combatants, break down. 409</page><page sequence="8">Journal of Contemporary History Not even the category of 'wounded' holds up; though people were always injured in battle, 'the wounded' as a distinct legal category dates back no further than the eighteenth century. Before about 1350, so different were historical circumstances that the modern term 'prisoner' itself does more harm than good. It is therefore proposed to break off the discussion at this point, and devote the next section to the treatment of non-combatants. Except when war is waged in a desert, non-combatants, also known as civilians or 'the people', constitute the great majority of those affected. Today, the distinction between them and combatants is considered vital; even to the point that we reserve the appellation 'war' for those in which it is observed, whereas the rest are called by other names such as 'insurgency', 'low intensity conflict', 'guerrilla warfare', or 'terrorism'. Therefore, it is all the more remarkable that during much if not most of history such distinctions did not exist. Take the case of tribal societies of the hunting-gathering and gardening types. Most such societies are organized by sex and age. The fundamental distinction is between males and females. Females do not play an active part in war; their role is to encourage the warriors, participate in the celebration of victory, or be victimized in the case of defeat. Typically the males are divided into children, adolescents, warriors and old men. The name, warriors, speaks for itself. While most tribes include a handful of males, such as the shaman, who do not actually fight, by and large to be a warrior, in other words an adult male, is synonymous with membership. Tribal warfare usually took one of two forms, the ambush or the raid.25 Of these the latter was the more lethal and sometimes led to the destruction of entire villages. Whatever the exact tactics used, the role of enemy males was to be killed, either on the spot or later on as part of some cannibalistic rite. Women and young children were normally captured. In the absence of 'government' in our sense of the word, let alone an organized state, captives belonged to individual warriors. Their normal fate was to be adopted into the victorious tribe which treated children as children and women as women. Since institution- alized slavery was unknown, troublemakers aside, after a generation or two captors and captives could no longer be distinguished.26 A transitional phase between tribal and 'civilized' society is found in the Book of Deuteronomy. It was ordained that the sons of Israel might come unto captured women and take them for their wives. 410</page><page sequence="9">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe They were, however, required to allow the fair captives one month of mourning for their dead relatives. Women who failed to please were to be freed; it was expressly forbidden to sell them or to treat them harshly.27 The fate of the Trojan women was similar, except that this time there was no Pentateuch to prescribe either the time that sex had to wait or the treatment they should receive after it had taken place. The men of Troy were killed, their children either killed or enslaved. The captives were taken back to Achaea. There such of them as were found suitable performed menial tasks in their master's household as well as sharing his bed when required.28 However, Achaean society differed from the Biblical one in that it was already monogamous. Hence there was usually no question of marrying captive women. Those heroes who did so - Agamemnon and Achilles' son, Neoptolemus - paid the penalty and were murdered by their original wives. Modern scholarship regards the time when the Biblical injunctions were composed as roughly contemporary with the Trojan War, placing both in the last third of the second millenium BC. For 3,000 years after that, armed conflict continued to fall naturally into field warfare on the one hand and siege-operations on the other. The division, one of the most persistent in all military history, even survived the gunpowder revolution by several centuries: it held true regardless of whether the heaviest weapons in use were spears, catapults, or cannons. Seen from our special point of view, the outstanding fact about field warfare was that it consisted of tournaments between armies, whatever their organization or the tactics that they used. The rule was that, when a battle took place in the 'open' field, non-combatants were nowhere to be found. An army around 1200 BC, like its successor in AD 1648, would encounter non-combatants principally in the course of marches or else during foraging operations. Their treatment varied from case to case and also depended on the prevailing social institutions. Oper- ating in friendly or neutral territory, the troops might be ordered to pay for what they took. Sometimes this also applied in enemy territory, but such cases were very rare until the second half of the seventeenth century. Most armies on campaign acted like swarms of locusts, eating all that could be eaten and setting fire to the rest. Members of the population who looked as if they were able to pay were put to ransom or else tortured to reveal their treasure's whereabouts. Where slavery existed, they would be rounded up and sold. Thus, throughout the period, the least that the inhabitants could 411</page><page sequence="10">Journal of Contemporary History expect was to be relieved of their possessions. If they tried to resist, and frequently even if they did not, they would be enslaved or killed. To escape the fate just described, people threatened by invasion took refuge in fortified cities or castles. Hence, when a fortress was captured, large numbers of non-combatants of both sexes and all ages were usually found within its walls. From the days of Greece right down to the Thirty Years War, Xenophon's dictum that 'the losers' life and their property belong to the victors' held good. True, the attackers often entered into negotiations with the defenders, agreeing to spare their lives and (sometimes) their property in return for a speedy capitulation. Even Tamerlane, whose march of conquest was marked by pyramids built out of human skulls, preferred to offer a city terms before engaging in the tedious business of a formal siege. The longer and the more difficult the siege, however, the more likely it was that the troops would wreak vengeance in an orgy of murder, plunder and rape. Faced by an imminent sack, the position of commanders was ambiguous. A sack might damage their reputation in the face of history, particularly if the place in question was sacred or otherwise famous. Also, it meant that control over the army would be temporarily lost and that much valuable property would be destroy- ed. Hence many commanders tried to prevent it from taking place, sometimes successfully and sometimes not. In AD 69, Titus did his best to prevent Jerusalem from being sacked, or so Josephus claims.29 In early modern Europe commanders sometimes paid their troops 'storm money' instead of letting them run amok, the idea being both to prevent disorder and permit organized spoliation. But there were also many cases when commanders made deliberate use of the sack, either to terrorize other cities which might refuse to surrender or else as a reward to their own troops. For example, in 146 BC the Romans sacked and utterly destroyed the city of Corinth. The Crusaders sacked Jerusalem in 1099. Charles V sacked Rome in 1527, the Duke of Alba Naarden in 1571; and so on until the end of the Thirty Years War. Thus, our modern ideas concerning the difference between com- batants and non-combatants only date back to the second half of the seventeenth century. It was in this period that war began to be looked on as the business of states acting through their chosen instruments, i.e. armies. Armies were increasingly defined as separate legal entities which, alone among all the organs of the state, were entitled to wage war. Under modern international law, first codified by Vattel around 412</page><page sequence="11">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe 1750, people who are not members of armed forces or accountable to an established authority are not supposed to take up arms, fight, or resist in any way. In return, their persons are not supposed to be violated by an invading army. Now this is not to say that today's international law does not permit civilian property to be destroyed or taken away. However, such things are supposed to take place only so long as active operations last, and then only to the extent that 'military necessity' demands. It is also in keeping with eighteenth-century ideas that the end of hostilities no longer signifies the onset of unlimited license. On the contrary, modern international law treats the inhabitants of occupied territories almost as if they were children temporarily deprived of their political rights and, therefore, all the more in need of care. Public property, but not that of private individuals, may be occupied by the occupiers. Existing law is supposed to remain in force, subject only to such modifications as are needed to ensure public security, read that of the invaders. The latter are supposed to allow the population to lead 'normal' lives. They must institute a government, either military or civilian, whose task is to look after its welfare until peace comes. They are permitted to levy taxes for covering the expenses of the occupation; but they may not forcibly appropriate economic re- sources, deport manpower, strip away artistic treasures, etc. The international conventions which embody these ideas mostly date back to the age of 'civilized' warfare between 1859 and 1937. Though both the Franco-Prussian War and the first world war saw them violated on some scale, at least the principles behind them were widely recognized. However, the second world war caused the distinction between combatants and non-combatants to break down in two principal ways. First, 'strategic' bombing destroyed men, women and children - to say nothing of religious and artistic treasures of every sort -indiscriminately. Second, and historically perhaps more important, there was the tendency of occupied peoples in many countries to take up arms again after their governments had surrendered. The Germans, to their credit, usually treated de Gaulle's Free French as if they were bona fide soldiers serving a legitimate government. The same line was not followed when it came to the resistance movements in various countries, whose members were tracked down, imprisoned, tortured and executed. The nazis regarded 'unlicensed' attacks on their soldiers by civilians who did not wear a distinguishing mark and did not carry arms openly as murder. From the standpoint of international law as it 413</page><page sequence="12">Journal of Contemporary History then stood, they were right. Partly because the absurdity of such a position came to be widely recognized after the war, partly because of the sheer number of 'national liberation' struggles since 1945, international law is slowly being amended. In 1977, a meeting assembled in Geneva decided that 'freedom fighters' would also be granted combatants' rights.30 Seen from the point of view of humanity at large, this may not have been as positive a development as appears on first sight. First, the new order is easy to evade since each government insists that, whatever the situation elsewhere, their homegrown variety are not freedom fighters but bandits, assassins, terrorists or whatever. Second and possibly more important, if terrorists are entitled to be treated as combatants then combatants may also be treated as terrorists. All in all, it is difficult to see who has benefited from the change, except of course the terrorists themselves. The rules of war as they exist today are far from perfect, nor can one deny that they are being violated every day. Still, at least they no longer grant the victors automatic access to the losers' persons and property, let alone to their womenfolk. In the second world war, more American servicemen were executed for rape than for any other crime, particularly if they were black and particularly if the victim ended up dead as well as violated.3' By contrast, the Israelis in the occupied territories may have killed large numbers of Palestinians, but to this day not even Jordan TV has reported a single case of rape. Had these facts been reported to our ancestors, surely they would have wondered why Americans, Germans and Israelis were fighting at all, given that they were not even permitted to indulge their lusts. Thus, it is crystal clear that the distinction between combatants and non-combatants, far from being negligible and irrelevant to the practical business of conducting modern war, defines what that war is all about. This becomes even more evident when we discuss the limitations surrounding another field, namely that of weapons. In the field of weapons, too, war has always been limited by rules. Had Clausewitz's view of armed conflict as a question of employing whatever force is necessary in order to achieve one's ends been right, then there should have been no such limitations; in fact, however, they exist in every civilization that has known war, including our own.32 The list of weapons which have been declared 'unfair' starts in the ancient world. An early example is associated with Paris, the man 414</page><page sequence="13">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe who abducted Queen Helen. A better lover than a warrior, Paris's preferred weapon was the bow, and he is consequently called names such as 'coward', 'weakling' and 'woman'.33 Similarly among the two sons of Telamon, Ajax and Teukros, the former fights with the spear and counts as a great hero. The latter is an archer who, though quite effective on the battlefield, shelters behind his larger comrade's shield 'like a child in his mother's dress'. Nor was contempt for the bow limited to the epics. According to Plutarch, Lycurgus forbade the Spartans from using the bow to make them brave.34 Greek religion being anthropomorphic, similar distinctions pre- vailed on Olympus. Eurypides in Heracles Lost accuses the hero of cowardice, saying that he prefers shooting from afar to fighting, man to man, in the front row and exposing himself to the gash of the spear.35 The sea-god Poseidon, whose characteristic weapon was the trident, was much stronger and more manly a figure than Apollo of the silver bow. Goddesses, too, were classified by their weapons. The strongest was Pallas Athene who wore armour and whose weapon was the spear. Her father's favourite, she was much stronger than her sisters, the hunting-goddess Artemis and the love-goddess Aphrodite, both of whom used the bow.36 Since missile weapons enabled the weak to wound and kill the strong, they did not constitute a proper test of manhood; whereas the Persians expressed their ideal of virility by saying that a man should ride a horse, shoot the bow and speak the truth, the Western military tradition regarded the bow as sneaky. Though suited for sport and hunting, in war its use could be justified only by the force of circumstances. How persistent such traditions could be is evident from the fact that, throughout antiquity, long-range devices such as bow and sling were considered the poor man's weapons.37 No self- respecting hoplite or legionary would use them. Units of bowmen and slingers, often even javelin-men, typically consisted of men drawn either from the lowest social classes or from foreign, semi-civilized peoples. In the Roman army such units and such men never even attained proper military status. Though tactically quite important, they were called auxilia and made to serve for a longer period, and for less pay, than legionaries.38 During the Middle Ages, the bow's fortunes became dependent on geography. The Byzantines, many of whose forces consisted of mercenaries originating in the Russian steppes, adopted the latter's method of fighting on horseback and using long-distance weapons. In the West, the Franks preferred to fight hand to hand using spears, 415</page><page sequence="14">Journal of Contemporary History swords and axes. Later, when they took to horse and became knights, they still fought hand to hand. The bow remained a second-class weapon. The Chanson de Roland derides the Moslems for refusing to fight at close quarters and relying on missiles instead.39 The Second Lateran Council in 1139 sought to impose a ban on the crossbow, which was considered too cruel - read, too effective- a weapon for use against Christians.40 The best way to understand the ban is, however, to examine the social position of the bow. Edward I, Edward III and Henry V- to say nothing of William the Conqueror - owed their victories largely to it. Nevertheless, these monarchs themselves did not use it, nor did other noblemen train with it for any but sporting purposes.41 Another indication of the bow's inferior position is its role in games and amusements. Already in the Iliad shooting with the bow is the last, and least, among the contests organized by Achilles in honour of the dead Patroclus.42 Similarly in the tournament, that showpiece par excellence of medieval chivalry, the bow's position was ambiguous. Its use in combat of knight against knight was prohibited.43 True, the days set aside for a tournament often also witnessed competitions in archery. Just as the pause in modern soccer games is sometimes filled by dancing girls, so the function of the bow in the tournament was to fill gaps in the programme or else bring it to an end. Those who competed with the bow were not knights, nor does the record tell us that noble ladies awarded the prizes. Ladies did, however, sometimes use the crossbow for target-practice or hunting; another indication of its problematic nature as a first-class weapon of war. The story of the early firearms which, by enabling a commoner to kill a knight from afar, threatened the continued existence of the medieval world, is well known. Originating in the fourteenth century, firearms took two centuries to become really respectable. In Mamluk Egypt and Samurai Japan they were regarded as incompatible with the social status of the ruling groups and banned.44 In Europe, too, they were resisted: Ariosto,45 Cervantes,46 Shakespeare47 and Milton are but four out of a long list of famous names who described them as Satan's special creation. Like the bow, firearms were originally considered low-status weapons, although in this case those who specialized in them were perhaps more akin to technicians or magicians than to mere peasants. These factors explain why those who used firearms in war were sometimes punished. The fifteenth- century Italian condottiere Gian Paolo Vitelli blinded and cut off the hands of captured arquebusiers; whereas his near-contemporary 416</page><page sequence="15">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe Bayard - the chevalier sans peur et sans reproche - had them executed.48 The ease with which firearms killed from a distance was not the only reason for disliking them. Early firearms were almost impossible to use on horseback. In Europe, as well as among the Egyptian Mamluks, they threatened to bring to an end an entire social order which for centuries had divided humanity into those who did and did not ride. Firearms were also messy, dirty and dangerous. Firing a weapon was a complicated operation which always fouled the firer and sometimes ended with an explosion in front of his face. Whatever the reason, the prejudice against firearms persisted, in some respects, into the nineteenth century and beyond. Even during the last years before 1914, the European nobility typically preferred the cavalry to any other arm, one reason being that its principal weapon continued to be cold steel. One very important reason for disliking a weapon was, of course, because it was new. The greater its effectiveness, the more it threatened to upset traditional ideas as to how war should be waged and, indeed, what it was all about. This explains why 'unfair' weapons often appear during periods of rapid technological progress; in modern times, one such period opened around 1850 and ended in 1914. Breechloaders were followed by rifles, repeating guns, and machine-guns firing smokeless powder and spitting out death at 600 rounds a minute. Artillery, too, was revolutionized. Muzzle-loaders with a range of perhaps a mile, scarcely changed for three centuries, turned into breechloading rifled steel monsters weighing up to a hundred tons. By 1914 the largest guns, mounted aboard ship or else on rails, could put one shell a minute, each close to a ton in weight, on a target over fifteen miles away. Their introduction was accompanied by that of ancillary devices, such as the railway and the telegraph, whose origin was not military but whose impact on war was soon felt. The steamship, the submarine, the balloon, dynamite and barbed wire conclude the list, even if we only include the most important devices.49 As the new devices multiplied, it was feared lest they would transform war into something new, monstrous and unprecedented. Hence many attempts were made to regulate the new weapons, starting in St Petersburg in 1868 and ending in the Hague in 1907.50 The key problem was to define what did, and did not, constitute war; for which purpose 'fair' means had to be separated from 'dastardly' ones and measures constituting 'military necessity' from those which 417</page><page sequence="16">Journal of Contemporary History would merely cause 'unnecessary suffering'.51 Since each delegation had its own ideas on these subjects the results were, seen in retrospect, meagre enough. It was agreed to ban explosive projectiles weighing less than 400 grams. It was further agreed that explosives should not be dropped from balloons. Finally, it was agreed that submarines would not use their torpedoes to sink unarmed merchantmen without first warning the crew and allowing them to take to their boats. All three prohibitions were later violated. Nevertheless, the debates which brought them into existence, as well as the rules themselves, provide one very good insight into the contemporary understanding of war.52 Another weapon banned at St Petersburg, destined to become more controversial than any other, was gas. Now asphyxiating agents - i.e. smoke - had been used in war since time immemorial without being considered in any way special. Since effectiveness depended on concentration, their use was usually associated with the constricted spaces characteristic of siege warfare, particularly mining and countermining operations. As the nineteenth century witnessed the rise of the modern chemical industry, the nature of the problem changed. Poison gas, which previously could be synthesized only in the laboratory, could now be manufactured in whatever quantity needed to turn it into an effective weapon.53 Just as today there is sometimes talk of unleashing 'weather warfare' and artificial earth- quakes, so a century ago the looming possibilities of chemical warfare frightened the military almost out of their wits. It was therefore agreed that it should be banned, and for close to fifty years the ban was observed. Those who formulated the conventions were thinking in terms of open warfare of the Napoleonic kind. In 1915, faced with the unprecedented situation of stationary trench warfare, the prevailing ideas changed. The Germans were the first to move, but the fact that they were vehemently denounced on all sides did not prevent others from resorting to gas as well. The war was not yet a year old when both sides raced each other to produce more poisonous chemicals and better protective masks. Even the suspected presence of gas forced men to put on protective gear, immobilizing them and turning them into half-soldiers (conversely, the fact that it did not allow them free play as soldiers was one reason why men disliked gas). It was very effective, particularly when used in combination with high explosive. Though a man going blind or drowning in his own fluids even as he coughed his lungs out constituted an appalling sight, paradoxically 418</page><page sequence="17">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe gas was a relatively humane weapon. This was because, compared to others, a much lower proportion of those who became casualties died.54 The interwar period saw gas employed by the Italians in Abyssinia, and possibly also by the British putting down the rebellions of remote Indian villages. In 1937, with the second world war already looming over the horizon, the ban against its employment was formally reaffirmed. During the war itself both sides produced and stored gas on a massive scale. Their arsenals included not just the former, comparatively primitive, asphyxiating and blistering agents but novel, far more lethal compounds aimed at paralysing the central nervous system. The pros and cons of gas were debated in every country. In the end, perhaps the decisive factor why chemical weapons were not employed was that they are ill-adapted to motorized, mobile warfare. To use gas against a well-defined line of fortified positions is one thing; to drench entire provinces and even countries with it, another. Today many countries produce and store chemical weapons.55 Partly because their employment is difficult to verify, however, reliable reports of their use have been comparatively few and far between. During the 1960s, the Egyptians used gas in Yemen. Two decades later their example was followed by the Iraqis who used the weapon first against the Iranians and then against their own Kurdish fellow- citizens. The Americans in Vietnam resorted to defoliating agents to deprive the Viet Cong of cover and also employed chemicals to destroy rice-crops in areas considered to be 'infested' by the enemy; whether this amounted to chemical warfare properly speaking is debatable. The CIA has accused the Chinese and Soviets of using gas in Cambodia and Afghanistan respectively. A few cases may have gone unreported, yet, considering the number of conflicts which have taken place since 1945, the total number is small. A logical reason for this reluctance is hard to find. Already in the first world war, fear of retaliation did not deter the belligerents from resorting to gas -the Germans in particular ought to have been worried, given that the winds blew mostly from west to east. Nor did developed countries waging Low Intensity Conflicts in faraway colonies have to fear retaliation, given that most guerrillas could not produce chemical weapons even if they had wanted to. Perhaps the best explanation is cultural. While tearing people to pieces by artillery or burning them by napalm is regarded as acceptable, we generally do not like to watch them choking to death. As often happens when 419</page><page sequence="18">Journal of Contemporary History imagination has to substitute for reality, dislike may become self- reinforcing. Considered horrible, a weapon is not used. Left unused for any length of time, the horror with which it is regarded tends to grow. Unfortunately, time can make people forget as well as remember, with the result that the cycle may not last. As the twentieth century comes to an end, apparently the horror with which chemical weapons are regarded in much of the modern world is not unmixed with curiosity. Thus, the distinction between chemical and other weapons exists solely in our minds. It is a convention like any other, neither more logical nor less. Like other such conventions, whether those that pertain to weapons or to any other factor, it is a historical phenomenon with a clear beginning and, most probably, a clear end. It remains, however, to ask what all this teaches us about the nature of war, the things it is all about. The preceding sections have provided an outline, however brief, on international law and custom associated with prisoners, non- combatants and weapons. Vast as these problems are, they represent only a fraction of a much larger body of conventions and usages. Since the dawn of history, men, far from discarding all restraint when they went to war, have sought to regulate it and subject it to limitations. Even the earliest historical societies surrounded armed conflict by rules which defined the way it should be declared and terminated.56 The same societies sought to establish procedures by which the two sides could communicate even as they fought (parleys), ways in which the fighting could be temporarily halted (truces), places that would be exempt from it (sanctuaries), and so on ad infinitum. Modern international law originates in the late Middle Ages, which in turn built on Roman and Canon Law. Like some long-lived reef of coral, it is still growing daily, adding layer to layer even as older ones degenerate and are forgotten. Besides covering the above-mentioned problems, it also rules over numerous other issues. The status of enemy diplomats, of enemy citizens, of enemy property, have been subjected to an enormous body of scholarship as well as numerous international agreements. Other laws cover the rights and duties of neutrals, particularly as regards assistance to belligerents, asylum, internment, right of passage and so on. Some rules attempt to prevent the destruction of churches, libraries, cultural monuments, even entire cities. There are rules protecting the wounded, the medical 420</page><page sequence="19">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe personnel attending them, and the facilities for treating or trans- porting them. Others forbid shooting at members of the armed forces who are temporarily defenceless, e.g. pilots parachuting to safety and ships' crews taking to their boats. There are also problems such as the right to carry arms and ruse de guerre. Merely to catalogue the rules would require several volumes. Like any law, that which pertains to war is occasionally, perhaps frequently, broken. The mere fact that the law in question pertains to war, however, does not prove that this happens more often than elsewhere, let alone that the law does not exist or does not matter. To select but a single extreme example, the second world war was as 'total' a conflict as has been fought at any time and place. Still, social mores change. Not even Hitler, fighting Stalin, followed the example of the Ottoman Sultan who, declaring war against the Habsburg Empire in 1683, threatened to 'bare the breasts' of any German woman coming his way.57 Though both Hitler and Stalin could be ruthless to their subordinates, apparently neither tried to assassinate the other. Neither used chemical weapons, though both had plenty in store. Neither was considerate in his treatment of enemy non- combatants, yet no Soviet or German city was sacked in the manner that Wellington sacked Badajoz or the Japanese Nanking. Both sides treated prisoners harshly. Still, the great majority were not executed, as would have been their fate if they had been, for example, Dacian tribesmen falling into the hands of that paradigm of civilization, the Roman Emperor Trajan. Furthermore, and whatever the atrocities committed on the Eastern Front, in the West the struggle, in so far as it pertained to the regular forces, was tolerably clean. Between shipwrecked sailors, shot-down pilots, prisoners, wounded, hospital ships, medical personnel and so on, the number of those who owed their lives to the fact that the law of war was observed probably ran into several millions. Nor is this the end of the story. If today we can enjoy the splendours of Paris, this is partly because in 1940 the French declared it an open city, a declaration which was understood, accepted and respected by the Germans. Again, when in 1944 Hitler ordered the city burnt down, the local Wehrmacht commander hesitated. In the end he refused, declaring Paris an open city and thus saving one of mankind's great cultural monuments.58 The 'strategic' view of war sees law as applying largely to marginal groups of people who are weak or hors de combat and therefore deserve protection; or else to 'exceptional' weapons such as gas. 421</page><page sequence="20">Journal of Contemporary History However, nothing could be further from the truth. The law of war does not just appease the conscience of a few tender-hearted people. Its real function is to protect the armed forces themselves. This is because war is the domain of uncertainty and agony. Nothing is more likely than combat to cause rationality to go by the board, nor is anything more conducive to make even the most even-minded behave strangely. The paradox is that war, the most confused and confusing of all human activities, is also one of the most organized. If armed conflict is to be successfully waged, then many trained individuals must co-operate. People cannot co-operate, nor organizations exist, unless they obey a common code of behaviour. This code should match the prevailing cultural climate, be clear to all, and capable of being enforced. As Plato puts it in the Laws,59 obedience has always held and will always hold pride of place among the military virtues. From ancient Rome on, the best armies have been the best disciplined. Nor is it by accident that military law has always sought to be more strict, and military parlance more terse and precise, than its civilian equivalents. War is only possible if participants are given to understand just whom they are (and are not) allowed to kill, for what ends, under what circumstances, and by what means. A body of men which is not clear in its own mind about these things is not an army but a mob. Though there have always been mobs, usually in front of an effective fighting organization they scattered like chaff before the wind. The need for the law of war, however, goes even further than this. War consists of killing, deliberately shedding the blood of one's fellow-creatures. Now no society can tolerate the shedding of blood and killing unless they are carefully circumscribed by rules which define what is, and is not, allowed. Always and everywhere, only killing done by certain authorized persons, under certain specified circumstances, and in accordance with certain prescribed rules is saved from blame and is regarded as praiseworthy. Conversely, bloodshed which ignores the rules or transgresses them will attract punishment or, in some societies both past and present, atonement. Different societies at different times and places have differed greatly as to where they draw the line between war and murder; however, the line itself is indispensable. Some deserve to be decorated, others hung. Where the distinction is obliterated, society falls to pieces and war, as opposed to indiscriminate violence, becomes impossible. The last function of the war convention is to influence the outcome by telling the vanquished when to surrender. If the vast majority of 422</page><page sequence="21">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe conflicts are not fought to the end - if not every enemy person has to be slaughtered - this is because the rules define what does, and does not, constitute 'victory'. For example, ancient Greek armies could 'lose' a battle in one of two ways. Either one side ran, or else it asked the other for a truce to gather up its dead. Since there were occasions when one side escaped and the other asked for a truce, disputes sometimes arose as to who had 'won' an engagement. In so far as medieval encounters were simple tournaments taking place in the open field, the armies of the day faced similar problems. To remove any doubt, chivalrous custom demanded that the victor occupy the battlefield for three consecutive days, as the Swiss did at Sempach in 1315 and Granson in 1476.60 Finally, early modern commanders used to celebrate victory by having the troops sing Te Deum. As Voltaire says, each did so in his own camp.61 Today the war convention is alive and well, continuing to rule over the life and death of tens, possibly hundreds, of thousands. True, physical possession of the battlefield is less important than it used to be. Since Napoleon invented 'strategy' in the sense of using battles to win a campaign, war is no longer simply a question of one wrestler throwing the other out of the ring. From Moltke to Liddell Hart, the goal of strategy has been just the opposite: namely, to outflank the enemy, encircle him, cut him off, deprive him of supplies and make him surrender without actually having to fight for the ground on which he stood.62 From the Austrians at Ulm in 1805 to the Egyptian Third Army at Suez in 1973, the story of modern strategy is always the same. Large formations counted as defeated - and regarded themselves as defeated - as soon as they were surrounded and their lines of communication severed. Under modern rules, fights to the death usually ensue only when the sides find it impossible to cut each other off and thus score 'victory points'. For example, the first world war on the Western Front was, as contemporary wisdom put it, 'not war'. Conditions were such that one side was unable to outflank - let alone encircle - the other, with the result that for four years they engaged in a battle of attrition and wore each other down half to death. Attacking the USSR in 1941, the Germans operated according to standard Blitzkrieg doctrine, pene- trating into the enemy's rear and creating vast pockets; however, they soon found that the Russians, unlike the French the previous year, refused to surrender when surrounded and had to be rooted out one by one, thus delaying the campaign and causing it to fail.63 Finally, one reason why today's armies often fail when fighting guerrillas and 423</page><page sequence="22">Journal of Contemporary History terrorists is precisely that such opponents have no bases or lines of communication and cannot be 'cut off. Either they run, in which case nothing is achieved, or they make a stand - with the result that the ensuing fight is apt to be unusually tough and bloody. All this leads to the conclusion that, in any particular kind of war, the meaning of 'victory' is decided as much by convention- tacit or explicit- as by physical results. Like any other kind of law, the war convention consists partly of explicit rules and regulations and partly of norms which are rooted in the culture. Like any other kind of law, it represents a more or less porous, more or less flimsy, barrier built upon the shifting sands of reality. As circumstances cause one type of conflict to be replaced by another, the existing convention becomes inadequate and new definitions have to be found. Nor is it difficult to see what will happen to a force which, for one reason or another, violates the rules. One possible outcome is for the army to turn into a deaf and blind mob, running amok in all directions while inflicting tremendous destruction on the environ- ment and itself. So far removed is such uncontrolled violence from war proper that Greek mythology had two different deities to represent the two. The patroness of orderly, regular war was the virgin goddess Athene. Springing directly from Zeus's brain, she was a powerful warrior. The patron of unrestrained violence was Ares, 'mad, fulminating Ares', to quote Homer, an outcast among gods and men. Athene was a great goddess in whose honour the Parthenon was erected. Ares, a minor deity, had few worshippers and fewer temples. The Iliad tells how Ares met Athene in battle and was trounced. Bleeding, he ran from the field, ascended to Olympus and complained to Zeus; from whom, however, he received little sympathy.64 While armies which become raging, uncontrollable mobs are not rare, in the long run the more likely outcome is somewhat different. In a situation like Vietnam, where regular forces fight guerrillas and terrorists, the distinction between combatants and non-combatants will probably break down. Unable to go by the ordinary war convention as expressed in the 'rules of engagement', all but the most disciplined troops will find themselves violating those rules. Having killed, by the force of circumstances, non-combatants and tortured prisoners, they will go in fear of the consequences if caught. If caught, they are certain to blame their commanders for putting them into a situation where they are damned if they do and damned if they do not. The commanders, in turn, will wash their hands of the whole affair. There will be atrocities, as at My Lai, and attempts to cover them up. 424</page><page sequence="23">van Creveld: The Clausewitzian Universe Where the cover-up fails, a few low-ranking members of the military establishment may be turned into scapegoats, enabling their super- iors to deny responsibility. As the men cease to trust each other, their commanders and their subordinates, disintegration sets in until, as in Vietnam, tens of thousands went AWOL and an estimated 30 per cent of the forces were on hard drugs. Soon they will cease to fight, each man seeking only to save his conscience and his ass.65 Without a law to define what is and is not permitted, there can be no war. Though written international law is comparatively recent, previous ages were no less dependent on the war convention for their ability to fight. Nor does the absence of a formal written code necessarily mean that our ancestors were more (or less) ruthless in their conduct of war than we ourselves. Before there was inter- national law, there were often bilateral treaties between kings. These were preceded by the law of nature, the code of chivalry, the ius gentium, Greek religion and custom and, earlier still, by tribal customs and usage. While not all of these codes were laid down in writing, they were supposed to represent reason, God, tradition, even - in the case of primitive tribes - 'reality' itself. In all, they were probably as effective as today's international agreements which, made by man, are also capable of being abrogated by him. Though the rules of previous ages differed from our own, then as today those who broke them were sometimes brought to justice. Nor was fate necessarily more kind to those, probably the majority, who never stood trial. Western literature as represented by the Iliad begins at the point where king Agamemnon was punished by Apollo for violating the law and rejecting the ransom of a young woman whom he had captured.66 In later Greek mythology, warriors who dese- crated temples or committed other excesses were overtaken by nemesis and persecuted by the Erinyes, the monstrous goddesses of revenge. During the Christian Middle Ages, knights who did not respect the rights of monks, nuns and 'innocent people' in general were destined to be hounded by the devil while they lived and carried off to hell after they died.67 The fate which the modern world reserves for those who cross the border between war and crime is, in some ways, worse still. Gone are the days when, as in ancient Persia, armies were ceremonially purged of bloodshed by being marched between the two halves of a sacrificial dog. God may still exist, but judging by the frequency of His appearances in the strategic literature He has turned His face away. The breakdown of belief and the absence of religiously sanctioned 425</page><page sequence="24">Journal of Contemporary History rites for expiation have made it very difficult for people to come to terms with their transgressions. Visit the Vietnam memorial in Washington DC on any average day and watch the crowd for the effects of repentance and guilt on both combatants and non- combatants who, even after fifteen years, have yet to come to terms with that war.
