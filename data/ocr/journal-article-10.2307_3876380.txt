<plain_text><page sequence="1">Jerome Gellman WELLHAUSEN AND THE HASIDIM Hasidism would seem to be a most unlikely place to find a hook on which to hang a contemporary Jewish theology that takes into account biblical criticism. Yet that is exactly where I am going to go in what fol- lows, to present what I take to be a position that preserves the holiness of the Torah in the face of the historical-critical approach as to its authorship and composition. The use of Hasidism for this purpose has been tried before. I refer especially to Benjamin Sommer's use of a novel interpretation of the giving of the Decalogue, by Rabbi Naftali Tzvi Horowitz of Ropshitz (d. 1815), in the name of his teacher, Rabbi Menachem Mendel of Rymanov (d. 1815), as a source for Sommer's own theology of biblical criticism, a view he calls "Torah as Midrash."' I believe, however, that the comment of the "Ropshitzer" on the Sinai revelation does not do the trick. Nonetheless, we do get from the Ropshitzer a trajectory, which if only followed uncompromisingly to the end would hit gold. I find gold-or more precisely a golden hook- in an aspect of the teachings of Reb Nachman of Breslov (1772-1810). First, I must issue a caveat. The view I will be presenting relies on an austere sense of God's utter unknowableness, albeit a known unknowableness. This is, however, only one of various contemporary philosophical understandings of God. To mention a few examples, there is the Neo-Thomistic "analogical view," in which God's attributes are not univocal with human ones, only because they are held in a different, infinite "mode" than human attributes are. So there is an analogy between God and humans.2 There is also the con- temporary theology of William Alston, who recognizes only a "func- tional" identity between God and humans.3 In functionalism, mental predicates refer to states-whatever they are-apt for bringing about specified results. What these states are in any given medium is not part of the predicate's meaning. So, to say, for example, that God wills X is to say, roughly, that God is in a state apt for bringing about X. This state need not be anything like the states that exist in humans that are apt for humans to bring about X. There are also various degrees of anthropomorphic understandings of God, including ver- sions of feminist theology and an influential Jewish contemporary theology of anthropopathism, by R. Abraham Joshua Heschel.4 The doi: 10.1093/mj/kjij010 ? The Author 2006. Published by Oxford University Press. All rights reserved.

It will perhaps appeal to the more mystical minded and to those who have despaired of a God who engages with the world. But it will not appeal to others. I am not even sure to what degree it appeals to me. So here is my plan in what follows. First I will be presenting Sommer's "Torah as Midrash" view with his claim to have discovered a source for it in R. Naftali Tzvi of Ropshitz. Then I will explain why I think Sommer does not succeed in pinning his own view onto the Ropshitzer. Next I will turn to Reb Nachman, to what I take to be a possible resource for a contemporary Jewish theology of biblical criti- cism, suggesting how Reb Nachman goes farther down the Ropshitzer's path than the latter seems to have gone. I The story about the Rabbi of Ropshitz begins with Gershom Scholem, who writes that in the view of Rabbi Mendel of Rymanov, the teacher whom the Ropshitzer credits for his interpretation, when the Ten Commandments were given at Sinai all that Israel heard was the aleph with which in the Hebrew text the first Commandment begins. This strikes me as a highly remarkable statement, providing much food for thought. For in Hebrew the consonant aleph repre- sents nothing more than the position taken by the larynx when a word begins with a vowel.... Thus, with his daring statement that the actual revelation to Israel consisted only of the aleph, Rabbi Mendel transformed the revelation on Mount Sinai into a mystical revelation, pregnant with infinite meaning, but without specific meaning. In order to become a foundation of religious author- ity, it had to be translated into human language, and that is what Moses did. In this light every statement on which authority is grounded would become a human interpretation, however valid and exalted, of something that tran- scends it.5 The Israelite nation at Sinai did not hear anything of specific content, according to Scholem, according to Rabbi Mendel. Everything specific that followed was mere human interpretation. Sommer picks up on this teaching-"daring" in Scholem's words-and says the following about the idea that the Israelites heard only the aleph of the first word of the Decalogue: This statement has gained fame for its paradox: the consonant aleph is silent. It represents a glottal stop-a constriction of the back of the throat that is itself noiseless but that permits the sound of a vowel to follow. An aleph cre- ates the verbal space for discourse, but it is not itself an utterance. In other words, at Sinai, Israel heard nothing, but it did experience a revelation, a wordless, inarticulate signification of God's commanding presence.</page><page sequence="3">Wellhausen and the Hasidim 195 For Menachem Mendel and Naftali Tzvi, the Siniatic aleph constituted a genuine breakthrough of the divine into the human consciousness. Their understanding of God's silent disclosure is not identical to the suggestion that the people did not experience revelation at all.... The people did hear some- thing, though what they "heard" was a sound that was silent.... However dif- ferent Naftali Tzvi's interpretive norms are from our own, it is clear that for him the revelation through silence at Sinai was a genuine disclosure of God's being, of God's "face" or "presence," to Israel; more-over it was a perception of divine command.... Menachem Mendel goes beyond the rabbinic notion that the nation received only part of the Ten Commandments; he proposes a final, radical variation of the minimalist position.6 Sommer thinks he finds in the Ropshitzer a source for his own view that the Siniatic revelation "did not entail distinct words or even sounds" and "was no more and no less than a signification of divine communication, an intimation of something beyond words or shapes, a trace that discloses a real and commanding presence."' At Sinai, that is, God's revelation had the force of a "commanding presence," a pres- ence that puts a person or nation under God's command, as a cate- gory of relationship to God, the details of "command" to be worked out by the receivers of the revelation. This is "open command," which does not specify details, where the receivers of the revelation are to provide the details in response to their revelatory experience. Sommer's position, then, is this: The Torah is not something dic- tated by God. The Torah, rather, records Israel's response to God's revelation to the nation, in which they experienced themselves as being under command, as the general nature of their relationship with God. Subsequently, "all of Jewish tradition is a response to the act of revelation, which had no content."8 Hence, the Pentateuch is "Midrash," an elaboration upon the revelational experience of the Jewish people of "open command." So biblical criticism is in, for it is consistent with God not having dictated the Torah and because the various voices in "the divine symphony" of biblical sources are each to be thought of as a midrash.' And the sacredness of the Torah is in too, for "the Bible remains holy as a response to God's self-manifestation," though its wording is human.'0 The first thing to note here is that Sommer's, and by implication Scholem's, attribution of silence to God at Sinai, according to the Ropshitzer, is not quite accurate. In his work, the Ropshitzer writes that the "face" of God consisted in the shape of the aleph, imaginatively thought of as graphically representing two eyes and a nose, together with the vowel kamatz, shaped like a "T" with a shorter stem and being the "beard" that rounds out the face." Hence, for the Ropshitzer there was a sound coming from God, namely, the sound of the vowel kamatz, and the revelation was not entirely silent. Nonetheless, even though not quite silent, the revelation does remain nonverbal.</page><page sequence="4">196 Jerome Gellman Does the Ropshitzer then mean to say that the revelation at Sinai was without content? So far, we have no evidence for that conclusion, Sommer's and Scholem's contention to the contrary. That is because it appears that both Sommer and Scholem make an illicit move from (a) "The Sinai revelation was nonverbal" to (b) "The Sinai revelation was without specific content." However, (b) does not follow from (a). Com- munication of specific content need not be verbal. In principle, a person could communicate specific content to another in a nonverbal way. For example, a previously set code could empower one person to communicate to another a specific instruc- tion, such as "steal home" or "swing on the next pitch," without using words. Our great-grandchildren might see the day when one person might communicate specific content to another by stimulating succes- sively specific places in the brain. Though it is controversial whether this really exists, we can at least conceptualize the possibility that one person may communicate with another via nonverbal telepathic com- munication. So, the fact that a revelation was nonverbal does not con- ceptually entail it having been without specific content. For the Ropshitzer, especially, who believed that the God of Sinai is an omnip- otent being, he would have believed that God could have delivered a precise message without having to resort to words. So, from the fact that the Ropshitzer endorses (a) we cannot infer that he meant to endorse (b) as well. Nevertheless, did the Ropshitzer mean to endorse (b), whether or not (b) follows from (a)? It seems doubtful that this was the case. Here is why. The Ropshitzer states more than once, and Sommer notes this, that when the Israelites heard the aleph they "cognized" or "grasped" the Ten Commandments: "It could be that we heard from God only the letter aleph [the first letter of anochi (the first word of the Deca- logue)] from which we grasped all ten of the commandments. And this is how we explained, 'Face to Face God spoke to you (Deuteronomy 5:4).' For a face is in the shape of an aleph with the vowel kamatz."'2 He then goes further to say that the Israelites grasped all 613 of the com- mandments that Jewish tradition recognizes: "From that we grasped the 248 positive commandments and the 365 prohibitions."'3 Now on Sommer's account, we would have to interpret the Ropshitzer's reference to the Israelites' "grasping" of the command- ments as referring to a midrashic enterprise based on the contentless revelation. However, the Hebrew term the Rabbi uses here for "cog- nized" or "grasped" is hisagnu, from the infinitive l'hasig, a standard term in Jewish writing for objective intellectual apprehension. Thus, there is good indication in the text that the Ropshitzer did not have in mind a midrashic enterprise, rather than cognition of a transmitted content. So, unless we have reason to think otherwise, we should</page><page sequence="5">Wellhausen and the Hasidim 197 interpret the Ropshitzer to have held that while the revelation was wordless, it had plenty of specific content, which was communicated in a nonverbal way. The only reason I can see for holding otherwise is the mistaken notion that (b) above follows from (a), that "nonverbal" entails "no content," which it does not. A further problem for Sommer is this. What could explain why this Hasidic master or his teacher, Rabbi Mendel of Rymanov, sud- denly expounded this radical minimalist view of the revelation at Sinai? After all, previous Hasidic literature does not so much as hint at the idea of a contentless revelation. What might explain this innova- tion? If Sommer's account is to be plausible, we need an explanation, either historical or from within the Ropshitzer's or his teacher's writ- ings themselves, for this radical innovation. So far we have no such explanation. On the other hand, I can think of two, related reasons, deeply embedded within the historical ethos of Hasidism, for why the Ropshitzer would want the specific laws to be imparted in the nonver- bal way he endorses. The first reason has to do with the Hasidic determination to locate the telos of the laws in devekut, an experiential, conscious "cleaving" or "attachment" of the Hasid to God.'4 In the first Hasidic book ever to be printed, Toldot Yaakov Yoseph, its author, R. Yaakov Yoseph of Polnoyye, states emphatically that "'And cleave to Him" (Deuteronomy 10:20) is the telos of the entire Torah and the commandments."'15 Israel Baal Shem Tov, the founder of Hasidism, is reputed to have characterized devekut or attachment to God as follows: "One must be so attached to God that he sees mainly God, not that he should see mainly the world, and God thereby. No. Mainly he should see God."'" The supreme interest of Hasidism, therefore, is to bring about a unity of religious behavior with an enduring consciousness of the presence of God. The enemy of Hasidism is a religious behaviorism, in ritual and study of the law, alienated from the consciousness of God's imme- diate presence in the world." The Hasidim strove always to turn the study of Torah and the performance of the Law to its root in the expe- rience of God, from whom the Law emanated. On this background, we can understand quite easily the desire of the Ropshitzer to locate all of the commandments within the aleph, the opening letter of the Decalogue. His purpose was to condense all of the commandments into the first letter of the word anokhi, "I," spoken by the God who appeared then to the Israelites. By condensing the laws into this letter, the Hasidic master expresses the motif of the insepara- bility of the laws from the experiential awareness of God's presence. The laws, the Ropshitzer is saying, cannot be separated from the immediate experience of God and must find their telos in a return into devekut. This devekut, however, is an experience of an ineffable</page><page sequence="6">198 Jerome Geilman God, hence the compacting of the experience into the aleph/kamatz sound that has no cognitive content. I propose that, rather than a con- tentless theophany, it was important for the Ropshitzer that the specific commandments be thought of as having been communicated (nonver- bally) by God at Sinai, so as to stress the ontological ground of these very commandments that the Hasid is fulfilling in the original, Sinai devekut experience. A second, related Hasidic reason the Ropshitzer would have had for the idea of the laws being condensed into the letter aleph alone comes from sayings attributed to the Baal Shem Tov, of which the fol- lowing is an example: "You should know the secret of God's unity: that wherever I hold on to an edge or part of the unity I am holding on to all of it. Now since the torah and the commandments emanated from the essence of God, which is a true unity, then when one fulfills one commandment properly and with love, which is devekut in him, and thus holds on via this mitzvah to part of the unity, then all [of the unity] is in his hand. It is as though he had fulfilled all of the command- ments.""8 The Baal Shem is saying that when the Hasid fulfills any commandment with devekut, he returns to the unitive essence of God from which that commandment emanated, and thus it is as though he fulfilled all of the commandments. This is because all of the command- ments are unified in God's essence and because devekut is the purpose of all the commandments. So achieving devekut through one command- ment is to have fulfilled the purpose of them all. This is the basis of the standard Hasidic practice of saying a special prayer before the perfor- mance of any commandment. In this prayer, the Hasid expresses his desire that his fulfillment of the single commandment at hand be con- sidered as though he had fulfilled all of God's commandments. So we should see the Ropshitzer as expounding on the above Hasidic teaching: The unknowable essence of God is represented by the letter aleph that begins but does not express the divine "I." And the condensation of all commandments into the aleph expresses the unity of all commandments in the essence of God and in our experience of devekut. For this reason, the performance of any commandment trans- ports us back to the source, where all commandments unify into one. Given the above two Hasidic teachings right in the Ropshitzer's Hasidic neighborhood, I suggest that it is more plausible to suppose that the Ropshitzer was motivated by a desire to expand and deepen these teachings than by a radical departure from Hasidic traditional- ism into the world of contentless revelation. In sum, we find in the Ropshitzer a conception of revelation in which specific content pours out of the ineffable point of the aleph with the vowel kamatz. Since that is so, contrary to Sommer, we must look elsewhere if we are to find a Hasidic hook to hang onto.</page><page sequence="7">Wellhausen and the Hasidim 199 II Reb Nachman of Breslov (1772-1810) is one of the most fascinating figures in the history of Hasidism. The great-grandson of the Baal Shem Tov, who was the founder of the Hasidic movement, Reb Nachman was born in Medzeboz, in Ukraine, and from 1802 until 1810 lived in Breslov, Ukraine. Afterward, he lived for a very short while in Uman, where he passed away from tuberculosis at the age of thirty-eight. He left behind many teachings, stories, and aphorisms, which constitute a rich treasure of religious passion and ingenuity. Reb Nachman told many stories to his followers, several recorded by his chief disciple, Reb Nathan of Nemirov (1780-1844). Spoken originally in Yiddish, they have been translated into many languages and have furnished material for learned discourses as well as academic studies. These stories are rich in biblical, Rabbinic, and Kabbalistic allusions and are central to the religious devotion of Braslov Hasidim to this day. My focus will be on one of Reb Nachman's stories, "The Story of the Humble King and the Wise Man," which goes like this: Once there was a king who had a wise man. The king said to the wise man: "There is a certain king who designates himself 'a mighty hero,' 'a man of truth,' and 'a humble person.' As to his might, I know that he is mighty, since the sea surrounds his country, and on the sea stands a fleet of ships with can- non, and they do not let anyone approach. And inland there is a big swamp surrounding the country. Through the swamp there is only one narrow path and on the path only one man can walk at a time, and there, too, there are cannon. When someone comes to fight them, they shoot the cannon, and it is impossible to approach. But why he designates himself 'a man of truth' and 'a humble person,' this I do not know. And I want you to fetch me the portrait of that king." That king (who spoke to his wise man) had all the portraits of all the kings, but no portrait of the king who had designated himself (with these titles) was available because he is hidden from men, since he sits under a canopy and is far from his subjects. The wise man went to that country. The wise man made up his mind that he had to know the essence of the country. And how could he know the essence of the county? By the country's jokes. Because when one has to know something, one should know the jokes related to it. There are several kinds of jokes. Sometimes one really intends to harm his friend with his words, and when the friend becomes angry, he says to him: "I am joking as is written: 'As a madman who casts firebrands, arrows and death."' (It is like one who shoots arrows into his friend's heart and says, "I am only joking.") And sometimes one does not intend it as ajoke, but even so his friend is harmed by his words. Thus there are all kinds ofjokes. Among all countries there is one country which includes all countries (in that it serves as the rule for all countries). In that country there is one city which includes all cities of the whole country which includes all countries. In that city there is a house which includes all the houses of the city which includes all the cities of the country which includes all countries. And there is</page><page sequence="8">200 Jerome Geilman a man who includes everybody from that house, etc. And there is someone there who performs all the jests and jokes (of the country). The wise man took with him much money and went there. He saw that they were performing all kinds of jests and jokes, and he understood through the jokes that the country was full of lies from beginning to end because he saw how they were making fun, how they deceived and misled people in com- merce, and how, when he turned for justice to the magistrate, everyone there lied and accepted bribery. He went to the higher court, and there, too, every- thing was a lie and in jest they faked all those things. The wise man understood through that laughter that the whole country was full of lies and deceit, and there was no truth in it. He went and traded in the country and he let himself be cheated in commerce. He went to trial in court, and he saw that they were all full of lies and bribery. On this day he bribed them, and on the next they did not recognize him. He went to the higher court. And there, too, everything was a lie, until he reached the senate and they, too, were full of lies and bribery. Finally he came to the king himself. When he came to the king he stated: "Over whom are you king? For the country is full of lies, all of it, from beginning to end, and there is no truth in it!" He started telling all the lies of the country. The king bent his ears toward the curtain to hear his words, because he was amazed that there was a man who knew all the lies of the country. The ministers of the kingdom who heard his words were very angry with him, but he continued to tell about all the lies of the country. The wise man concluded: "And one could say that the king, too is like them, that he loves deceit like the country. But from this I see how you are 'a man of truth.' You are far from them, since you cannot stand the lies of the country." He started praising the king very much. The king was very humble, and his greatness lay in his humility. And this is the way of the humble person: the more one praises and exalts him, the smaller and hum- bler he becomes. Because of the greatness of the praise with which the wise man praised and exalted the king, the king became very humble and small, till he became nothing at all. And the king could not restrain himself, but cast away the curtain, to see the wise man: "Who is it who knows and understands all this?" And his face was revealed. The wise man saw him and painted his portrait and he brought it to the king.'" I am greatly indebted to Zvi Mark for my understanding of this story and its implications.20 Mark observes that is generally accepted that a "king" in the stories of Reb Nachman is God. So I will follow Zvi in supposing that the king in our story whose portrait the wise man seeks is God. The "portrait" of the king may be taken to represent, therefore, the wise man's representation of God's self-revelation to him. Then, too, the king who sends the wise man to fetch the portrait of the king is also God. So God sends the wise man to learn the truth about God. The king says to the wise man: "There is a certain king who desig- nates himself 'a mighty hero,' 'a man of truth,' and 'a humble per- son.'" The first designation, we may assume, refers to the Jewish tradition's way of referring to God as "mighty" (gibor), as in Isaiah's declaration, "God will go forth as a mighty one, as a man of wars" (Isaiah</page><page sequence="9">Wellhausen and the Hasidim 201 42:13). The second designation reminds one of Rabbi Hanina's saying in the Talmud that God's seal is "truth" (Babylonian Talmud, Yomah, 69b). Finally, regarding "a humble person," Rabbi Yochanan, for example, declares, "Wherever you find God's greatness, there you find God's humility" (Babylonian Talmud, Megilah, 31a).21 So, Reb Nachman's king, when addressing Reb Nachman's wise man, wishes the latter to verify God's truth and humility, since God's might is already evident. Subsequently, the "truth" of the king becomes appar- ent to the wise man from the king's distance from the corrupt society that he rules, while the king's humility becomes manifest when he shrinks-rather than getting puffed up-from the praise the wise man gives to him. Since the king shrinks away to "nothing" before the wise man sees the king, we must conclude that the king's portrait that the wise man brings back to the king is, paradoxically, an empty picture. Nonethe- less, the wise man now knows something he did not know before about the king who hides behind the curtain. He knows of God as ayin, or "nothingness." The king revealing his empty face to the wise man may be taken as the wise man's experience of God's utter other- ness. To others, God is simply hidden, unknown, "behind a curtain," not because they know God as Other but because they have no way of knowing God. The wise man, on the other hand, comes to know that God's otherness does not depend on the curtain hiding God. When God peeks from behind the curtain, the wise man knows God as unknowable. Zvi Mark has presented a striking interpretation of the comedy motif of this story, essential to my purposes. Recall that when the wise man wants to understand the country, he tries to learn of the jokes made about it, because from the jokes one can learn the true nature of a thing. This is an indirect learning. Quite so, the wise man learns of the nature of the king by contrast to the corrupt country and the king's distance from it. The king is contrasted with the distorted face of the country: "Among all countries there is one country that includes all countries (in that it serves as the rule for all countries). In that country there is one city which includes all cities of the whole country which includes all countries. In that city there is a house which includes all the houses of the city which includes all the cities of the country which includes all countries. And there is a man who includes everybody from that house, etc. And there is someone there who performs all the jests and jokes (of the country)." What is the country that contains all countries, the city that contains all cities, and the house that contains all houses? In an addendum to the story sup- posedly heard from Reb Nachman himself, we are told that "Zion" is the place where all countries "meet," suggesting that Jerusalem is the</page><page sequence="10">202 Jerome Geilman city "containing" all cities. This is supported by a comment Mark cites by a Hassid of the Breslov movement, Nachman of Cherin, who writes that "perhaps this is what is meant in the story that there is a country containing all countries, this is the encompassing holiness of the Land of Israel. And in that country there is a city that contains all cities in that country, and that is Zion and Jerusalem. And in that city there is a house that contains all houses in the city, and that is the Holy Temple. And in it there is a person, etc. This should be understood without mention, since one cannot explain so much in such matters."22 If the country is the Land of Israel, the city is Jerusalem, and the house is the Holy Temple, then the person who makes the jokes in this place would be no other than the High Priest of the Holy Temple. Here is where the wise man goes to hear the jocular! The Temple becomes the place where all of the comedy is to be found in its most concen- trated form. What can we make of the idea that the Holy Temple is filled with jokes? Can there be any comedy in the solemn service of sacrificing and burning animals on the altar of the Lord? Mark interprets the comedy at the Holy Temple as follows: "In the Temple, people give presents to the sublime Infinite God, atone before Him with a meal offering of fine flour, see in the smell of the incense the smell of His being pleased, and the Levites sing to Him to make his time pass pleasantly. Is there a greater comedy than that? ... The divine com- edy describes God, the 'Infinite,' as changing his mind because of the bribe of a calf."23 People come with their mangy goats and rams and with their squealing little birds, go through a melodramatic sacrificial ritual, and think they have thereby done something to effect reconcili- ation between them and the infinite One who abides forever beyond human understanding! Can there be a comedy greater than this? Just so, the comic theme in the story about the king's empty por- trait points to the comic nature of all service of God, for Reb Nachman. Indeed, elsewhere Reb Nachman says exactly that: I do not know who can say that he serves God, because of God's greatness. Someone who knows even a little of His greatness I don't know how he can say that he serves God. However, the important thing is the will, that one's will be strong and unrelenting always to come close to God. . . . The main thing is the will and yearning, that he shall always yearn for Him. And in this way to pray, study, and perform the commandments. (And in truth, accord- ing to His greatness all of these services are nothing, but everything is "as though," for it is all just a joke, compared to His greatness.)24 Just so, Reb Nachman's pupil, Reb Nathan, writes about his mas- ter: "Our teacher said that the main thing is the will, to yearn always with a craving and a strong desire to fulfill His commandments. And thereby we study [Torah] as though we were studying, and pray as</page><page sequence="11">Wellhausen and the Hasidim 203 though we were praying, and perform the commandments as though we were performing the commandments."25 The comedy played out in the Holy Temple signifies the comic nature of all of religious practice. God is known only as being on the "far side" from us. God is not approachable. We can neither placate God nor come close to God. We can only yearn for God. When we engage in ritual and worship of God with full cognizance of the comic nature of our acts, with no self-deception, we thereby express our desire for God while acknowledging God's infinite unapproachability. To know that our desire to effect contact with God is doomed from the start, and to take up a comic approach to our best efforts, is the height of recognizing God's absolute transcendence of human reality. It is the height of homage to the Infinite One. Here I must point out that recognizing the comic status of a reli- gious act does not imply a lack of seriousness in its performance. On the contrary, the more seriously one performs the ritual knowing it is comic, the more one attests to the greatness of God. This is because one proclaims, as it were, that no matter what one does, no matter how seriously and meticulously one performs all of the minute details of the ritual, it is still a comedy! Reb Nachman wished to raise the consciousness of his followers to realize the comic nature of serving God. If people think they have really accomplished something when doing a ritual, they are dimin- ishing the Infinite One and causing profanation of God's Name. It is of utmost importance that one does the commandments with this understanding. For the love of God, one must be willing to make of oneself a comic fool. III I now turn to the hook upon which to hang a contemporary view of revelation. God is so far from humanity that there can be no contact between God and us. God, if known, is known as a nothingness, beyond all. This nothingness, however, is not the same as "being noth- ing." It is a nothingness that is present and an experience of which grants one knowledge-knowledge of God's absolute Otherness. It is also an experience that creates a profound longing to come close to God, with an equally profound understanding of the absurdity of that desire. Although Reb Nachman's view of God shares with "negative the- ology" the conception of God's utter Otherness, Reb Nachman does not endorse a translational scheme that would extricate our God talk from its imaginative character. No translating for him to "negative</page><page sequence="12">204 Jerome Gel/man attributes" or "attributes of action," as for Maimonides. They remain irreducibly in the realm of the imagination: "All praises and descrip- tions of God are imagination. Therefore, when the imagination is refined and perfected then one can properly order one's praises and descriptions of God. . . . For all praises and descriptions are imagina- tions."'26 Mark observes that the task Reb Nachman sets before the reli- gious believer is to refine and strengthen one's imaginative capacities so that the imagination can fulfill its central task in the religious life, that of expressing our yearning for God. For Maimonides, on the other hand, the height of religious understanding requires a transla- tion away from the realm of the imagination. At this point I wish to go beyond any claim Zvi Mark himself makes for Reb Nachman's views about God and inquire further into the con- trast between Maimonides and Reb Nachman. Maimonides never went to the end with his conception of God as beyond all positive under- standing. He left over "attributes of action." Thus, Maimonides can say, for example, "God gave the Israelites the Torah," which translates into saying that the Torah came from an action of God. We cannot, how- ever, say what God did to make that happen, since God's being is unfathomable for us. Still we have said something irreducibly positive about God: namely, about God's actions. The same seems to be the case for the Ropshitzer, as well. For he too recognizes the ineffable nature of God, as marked by the cleaving or devekut to God in the unintelligible lone letter of aleph, the first let- ter ofanochi, "I," referring to God. We can never get beyond that first letter. Yet the Ropshitzer does write of the Israelites "grasping" or "cognizing" the Decalogue or all of the commandments, implying, as I argued above, that God did impart to them specific content that comes from God. So, like Maimonides, the Ropshitzer does not endorse the Otherness of God to the bitter end. It would appear that this would not be so for Reb Nachman. "God gave the Israelites the Torah" remains for him forever an imaginative declaration. And as an imaginative saying, it goes against the dictum that there can be no contact, no bridging of the infinite gap, between a person and God. If we take this dictum to its end, beyond the Ropshitzer, then we can say not only that we study Torah as though we study Torah, pray as though we were praying, and perform God's com- mandments as though we were doing so but also that "God gave the Torah as though God gave the Torah." Our saying that God gave the Torah expresses our wish, our desire, for God to make contact with us, for God to make it possible to come close to God. We know that this is absurd, yet we persist in this saying, fully aware of its comic nature. If God is so thoroughly Other to the point of inaccessibility-not by choice but by definition-then God can no more convey God's will</page><page sequence="13">Wellhausen and the Hasidim 205 to humans than can a human convey anything to God. If we cannot make contact with God because God is infinitely far from us, then in a corresponding way neither can God make contact with us. The infi- nite distance between God and us makes a revelation (beyond His self- "revelation" as nothingness) impossible. What we call the revelation of Torah, therefore, represents our deepest desire to have God communicate with us, to tell us His will, so that we can come close to Him. If we believe God has really communi- cated with us, however, we transgress the proper understanding of God's picture as an empty portrait. We are to appreciate the comic aspect of thinking that God has really revealed God's will to us and relate to revelation with the same comic seriousness that we do to rit- ual. We are to relate to the idea of revelation with utter seriousness. Anything less would betray our desire to have heard from God. At the same time, we must be fully aware of the comedy involved in the very notion of God's revelation to us. The comic awareness keeps our faith in revelation from being idolatrous. I append to this exposition of Reb Nachman the following tanta- lizing teaching of his: The zaddikim (saintly) are "Mighty of strength who make his word" (Psalms, 103), for they make and build the word of the Holy One Blessed be He, that is, the holy language with which the world was created, as it says, "God coun- seled with the souls of the zaddikim and created the world" (Genesis Rabbah, Chapter 8) .... For the zaddikim are those who make God's word, for they make the speech of the Holy One Blessed be He, that He speak and create the world. All of this was prior to creation. Now as well, when zaddikim wish to hear the word of God, they first make the word and build it, that is by their good deeds they merit to hear speech from God.... When [zaddikim] want to hear speech from God first they make the speech, and afterward they hear it from the holy One blessed be He." Here Reb Nachman makes a play on words on the Hebrew osei devaro, normally translated as "do his word." The saintly do God's word. It can also mean "make his word," and this is the meaning Reb Nachman gives to it here. The saintly make God's word. Then they hear it. Now I am not about to claim that Reb Nachman reveals in this passage black on white what I have attributed to him. But it is allur- ingly close to what I think is implicit in his stance regarding the utter chasm between God and us. (Remember, I seek a hook, not a ground.) God speaks to us after we create God's speech. To conclude my story, if we accept what has been written here, we should maintain that the findings of biblical criticism are ineffable within Jewish religious life and spiritual devotion. That is, they cannot be expressed. A Jew cannot speak them. To do so would violate the imaginative expression of one's deepest need that God should have</page><page sequence="14">206 Jerome GeUman appeared to the Israelites in the desert and made known his will to them-and via them to all Jews for all time. To speak biblical criticism breaks the utter comic seriousness required for the religious life. It would be like suspending ritual performance because, after all, it does not reach God anyway. The yearning for God does not allow for a break in that yearning. In our religious passion, which knows no boundaries, we can never utter the thought: "God did not give the Torah, it is only as though God gave the Torah." When saying so, the religious yearning is disrupted, and the soul is damaged. If I am right about Reb Nachman, then this teaching of his, and this very article I am writing, cancel themselves out and must disappear from religious discourse. BEN-GURION UNIVERSITY NOTES 1.
