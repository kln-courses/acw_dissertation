<plain_text><page sequence="1">Number i Whole Volume XLIX January, I940 Number 289 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, I938-I939 fD URING the period from June I938 to June I939 French philosophy has not been less productive of interesting works than in previous years, and neither does it show greater unity of inspiration nor closer convergence of results. Three leading tendencies may, however, be discerned. First, we have the idealistic rationalism of which Leon Brunschvicg is the chief representative; secondly, and directly opposed to this, the more or less anti-rational and mystical tendency that places more emphasis on feeling and intuition, and is traceable, directly or indirectly, to Bergsonian in- fluence; lastly, the positivist and scientific tendency. All these trends we shall find exemplified in each of the great disciplines that we are going to review, namely, general philosophy; logic and philosophy of the sciences; psychology; ethics; aesthetics; and lastly, history of philosophy. Among the important books of the year first place must without doubt be accorded to the work in which Brunschvicg undertakes to complete the exposition of his doctrine. This work, La Raison et la Religion,' deals in a direct way with a problem that he has hitherto treated only by allusion in various connections. The title of Kant's work, Religion within the Limits of Mere Reason, would have been entirely suitable for Brunschvicg's book. In dealing with religion, as with other problems, he thinks it essential to know whether anthropomorphic imagination or, on the contrary, the pure spirituality of the reason alone is to have the last word. Three antitheses that he judges to be fundamental are defined in the first part of his book. First, there is the opposition between the living and physical self, and the self as an entirely spiritual prin- 1 Paris, Felix, Alcan, I939.

XLIX. ciple of intellectual activity and love; next, that between the imaginary world, which is geocentric and hence centered about the human individual, and the real and limitless world of science; and lastly, that between a God made in the image of man, and a God truly divine and rationally conceived. In former times nature "led to super-nature; hence it pointed the way to mind". The true God cannot be conceived as a private being with whom we might have social relations, so to speak; God is not loving or loved like men, "but He is what loves in us.... We can no longer accept the idea that we are extraneous to Him, and He ceases to be foreign to us; for He is not the superior being toward whom the temporal creature turns and prays in order to escape the burden of tem- poral laws, but is the eternal truth in whom a thinking soul gains the feeling and intimate experience of the eternity of thought" (74). In the second part of the work Brunschvicg displays this con- ception of an entirely disinterested religion, and of the unity and strict immanence in us of the spirit or the divine, as a conception seeking to reveal itself to us ever since the dawn of Occidental philosophy, and as one which has always been envisioned by the greatest minds and the noblest souls, but only to be again and again overshadowed by the aggressive opposition of fable-creating imag- ination and egotistical preoccupations. This is what the author calls "the disgraces of eclecticism", the analysis of which he pur- sues through three periods that he distinguishes in the history of European thought, namely, the Platonic, the Augustinian, and the Leibnizian. And following the method pursued in all his other works, he makes of them so many pictorial representations, con- tinually taking in new points of view, of the whole evolution of human thought. To each great doctrine he devotes a brief chapter, compact and precise, which often makes it appear in an unexpected and fresh light; and in each case he reiterates that the effort of pure spirituality is compromised by a renascence of the God of the imagination. "Thus, with all these philosophers, however diverse their points of departure, there is the same disavowal of their initial position, the same current that draws them back toward the beliefs which they had denounced at the outset of their careers as dreams and chimeras." "Has not this fact been</page><page sequence="3">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, I938-i939 3 shown to be sufficiently constant to be made into a law? If philoso- phy can, literally speaking, destroy religion, will it be in a position to take the place of religion ?" That is the objection to which we are exposed. For his part, Brunschvicg believes in a possible triumph of pure reason, free of anthropomorphic contamination; man will gradually renounce his old desire to escape from his mortal condition; he will learn how to "reascend to the source of that which, in our own estimation, makes us persons". And this will not mean, he maintains, "destroying the impetus given to religious life by the various faiths which have nourished Occidental thought, nor contradicting the example of their heroes and saints" (264). By this lofty and noble conclusion, which is firm and uncom- promising, he claims to remain faithful to the whole religious tradition of humanity in the West, and at the same time to elimi- nate all that may subsist in it of the commonplace, self-centered clinging to individuality, every hope for reward and personal happiness, all of man's interests that cannot be identified sincerely with those of God, that is, with those of pure thought, the univer- sal, and the one. Can one imagine, however, that the believers of the various faiths, like those in the diverse philosophies, will be more satisfied about such a conception in the future than they have been in the past? At any rate Brunschvicg's influence clearly dominates the very recent thesis of Georges Bastide, who, writing on La Condition humaine,2 describes at length and not without force what he calls "the conditions of access to spiritual life", the stages of thought in the conquest of its autonomy. Setting out with the idea that there is no absolutely simple consciousness and that, on the other hand, "the complex is always a construction, just as the simple is an abstraction", he gives us as the first state of conciousness what he calls "the protoplasmic [i.e., undifferentiated and confused] consciousness", a vital center of adaptation, comprising at once both habit and innovation, which is not yet self-conscious thought. A second phase is that of the separate representational idea, in con- nection with which the author presents a debatable but original theory. According to this theory the representation arises from the inception of a prepared activity, that the unexpected collabora- 2 Paris, Felix Alcan.</page><page sequence="4">4 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIX. tion of others renders useless, and consequently leaves in a state of simple, detached intention in consciousness. This phase of awareness is that of primitive thought, of the "world of spirits and intentions". Next comes the world of things and qualities, of the realism of common sense. But one cannot find rest in this world, for this phase of knowledge cannot complete itself in a coherent synthesis; it finds itself entangled in the blind alleys of rationalism and in the contradictions of empiricism. Being able neither to understand the brute fact as such, nor to derive it from an idea, it finds itself confronted with the two equally unthinkable notions, "the Becoming that nothing exhausts and the Eternal that nothing moves" (244). Hence this phase of knowledge termi- nates in doubt and anguish. So we are led to the idealism of the pure judgment, to the cogito understood in the Brunschvicgian sense. There must be a recognition of the immanence of judgment or thought in all knowledge and in all that exists in so far as it is known or knowable. But this turning inward does not consist in knowledge of a spiritual substance, denominated soul or mind. "Mind could not be an object of thought in the realistic sense of the word. To want to confront itself is to externalize itself to itself; but the mind does not know itself from the outside . . . for it is not what is affirmed, but that which affirms" (305). At this point Brunschvicg's position is opposed to Bergson's. "While the Bergsonian philosophy calls for a participation in being, that of Brunschvicg calls for participation in the one" (3i6). Thus the proper function of mind is constructive; true idealism is not a system of Being, but a theory of value, which consists in bestow- ing upon things the value of truth, beauty or morality. "It is not a matter of constructing the world . . . but of endowing it, from within, with logical, aesthetic, and moral reasons for existence." Here is a book full of enthusiasm, youth, and talent-which how- ever leaves unsolved the difficulty inherent in the doctrine from which it draws its inspiration. For if mind has the function of giving values to the world, if it is activity transparent to itself that renders the world rational and thinkable, how is it possible to ask what essential relation mind holds with this nature to which it applies itself and in the midst of which it arises? Must not nature be already pliable in some measure to the laws which mind im-</page><page sequence="5">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, I938-i939 5 poses on it, to some extent homogeneous with the form that is acceptable to it? Delvolve courageously faces this same problem. In a very ab- stract, concentrated, and difficult way of writing he indicates, in his consideration of the idea of matter,3 the chief features of a general philosophy, which seems to be a comprehensive spirit- ualism. Starting with the ancient conception of matter as that of which a work of art is made, he envisages this as one of the terms of a double idea, of which the necessary correlate is the notion of an organizing agent. From this point of view there are three forms and three main degrees of matter; namely, physical, biological, and noetical. By means of reference to the most recent theories in physics, Delvolve first seeks to establish this correlation of matter and organizing agency in the constitution of the atom, and to show that, besides a representation of its inner structure, energy must also be ascribed to it; for energy is its attractive center and the principle of all its changes. "We are thus led to distinguish be- tween representation and being, and to recognize being in the energy which is neither represented nor capable of representation" (40). All the changes of which the atom is the theatre are con- ceivable only as modes of participation in an irreversible and directed action that we may call "the organizing power of all mat- ter" and whose creative efficacy we experience in ourselves. The same conclusions emerge from an analysis of the notion of biological matter, with the additional new feature that biological matter is constituted not by a simple composition, such as the multi- plication of identical elements, but by development and evolution, and by the integration of a mass of exterior physical constructions (organs, tissues), appropriated and preadapted for the purposes of the organism or fashioned by it, which may be called para- biological. By noetic matter, lastly, is meant the given sensory data that the mind or reason organizes by means of the successive discovery of signs, concepts, and sensori-mathematical relations. Here again noetic matter is exteriorized in paranoetic matter, al- ways of a more or less social character-books, institutions, works of art-that are made, and constantly utilized, by mind. The 'De la matiere en general et plus particulierement de la matiere noetique, Paris, J. Vrin, I939.</page><page sequence="6">6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIX. classical dualism of two substances, matter and mind, is hence- forth replaced by the opposition of the two inseparable aspects of all reality, the material and the spiritual, always present together, always in interaction; every act of mind always finding some measure of material expression in a finished piece of work or in a created habit. In this way Delvolve, using new terminology, takes up and pursues through the different degrees of human evolution a contrast analogous to that of mystical and political in Peguy's works or to that between "constituting reason" and "constituted reason" made by Lalande. Delvolve's book is compact and inter- esting, but it is to be regretted that by its abstruse form it rather conceals this fact than renders effective its wealth of serious ideas and the lofty and noble quality of its author's inspiration. These works display more or less clearly an idealistic tendency; and it is this tendency which Gilson combats with remarkable firmness in a book he entitles Realisme thomiste et Critique de la Connaissance.4 In this book Gilson is interested, primarily, in in- ducing us to enter a secluded quarter, the realm of Thomist philo- sophers, busy with their own discussions, quarrels, and problems. It seems, however, that a considerable group of these thinkers is inclined today to seek a reconciliation between Scholastic philoso- phy and the modern way of thinking which is traceable to Des- cartes and Kant. This group is striving to work out a "critical realism", such as would definitely result in an affirmation of the reality of external matter, but based on the Cartesian cogito and "soul-more-certain-than-the-body" doctrine. "I have been obliged to bear witness", writes Gilson, "to how deeply the classical meta- physics is today contaminated by Kant's critique." This fact arouses his indignation; and to these attempts by Mgr. Noel, Rol- land Gosselin, and Fathers Picard, Marechal, and Gredt, he is keenly hostile. With weighty and lucid argumentation he shows that the full implications of idealism are not realized for what they are by these thinkers, and that once the principles of either Des- cartes or Kant are admitted, the gates are closed on us at the start and there is no longer a legitimate means of escaping from the realm of thought. If it once be granted that the existence of ' Paris, J. Vrin, I939.</page><page sequence="7">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1938-1939 7 things, and of the world apart from mind, needs to be demon- strated, we are no longer in a position to give such a demonstra- tion. "Cartesian or Kantian Thomism" seems to him to constitute a "teratological metaphysics". It is therefore necessary to hold fast from the very beginning to the position of Aristotle and St. Thomas, for whom the existence of the body is a primitive "evi- dence" on a par with the evidence of mind in the cogito. We must not for a single instant admit the need for an initial critique of knowledge. Like all the Scholastics, we must start out from being, not from knowledge. For St. Thomas knowledge is the act, not of the mind alone, but of the whole man, of the conjunctum, soul and body, inseparably. To the question as to how one knows that a thing exists, realism answers only that it is by perceiv- ing it. This attitude is simple; and also very simple is the solution given of the problem; really there is no solution, because for Gilson there is no problem. Hence the contented facility with which he goes about meeting the difficulties arising from false evidence, hallucination, and errors of the senses; and hence, on the other hand, the subtlety he displays in the critical part of the book, and when the question arises of ascertaining by what operation perceptive evidence is produced. At any rate recognition must be given to the frankness, the desire for clarity, and the hatred of equivocations and compromises, to which this book bears witness. Thomist thought, however, is only one of the currents in con- temporary Catholic philosophy; another is less intellectual and more mystical and somewhat influenced by Bergsonian doctrine. The most sympathetic and original representative of this tendency was Father Laberthonniere, who has already been dead for some years, but whose disciples have just published a volume of iEuvres Comnpletes,5 almost entirely devoted to studies of Descartes. The same tendency is manifest in Paliard's work on Le Theoreme de la Connaissance.6 For this author, "knowledge is a reflection of life on itself". But how could life reflect on itself if it were really nothing but life; if, in other words, there were not already intro- 'Paris, J. Vrin, 1938. 8 Paris, Auber.</page><page sequence="8">8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIX. duced into the conception of life something akin to consciousness and thought? And that means a return forthwith to the idealistic point of view. It is still, it seems, to general philosophy rather than to methodo- logy that we must refer L'Instauration philosophique7 by Etienne Souriau. This is a distinguished and original piece of work, both in respect of its subject-matter and in its method of treatment, learned throughout and often stimulating, but obscure. Despite its high literary quality, its painstaking and even complicated form, not to speak of the author's abuse of neologisms, doubtless in- creases our difficulty in understanding the thought. Souriau's aim is to present "the philosophy of philosophy", meaning by this a search for the conditions that must be met by what he calls "the in- stauration of philosophy", that is to say, the construction of any doctrine, or, as he likes to say, of any "philosopheme". But our keenest interest in this work is not so much in the establishment or discovery of these aims as in the penetrating insight that the author brings to bear on the history of philosophy and the various doctrines that he uses as illustrative material, particularly in con- nection with his interpretation of Cartesianism and Kantian thought. One of his chief tendencies, moreover, is to bring philoso- phy into close association with art; and the conditions of the instauration that he thinks he discovers as being necessary are "architectonic" and aesthetic rather than logical and dialectically obligatory. These conditions may all be expressed in one single law, namely, "that in order for anything to realize itself it must take on form" (I7). From this law derives the importance of the idea of work (ceuvre) in philosophy in so far as that work must be coherent and solid in structural quality-although these characteristics do not deprive the conceptions of their character as representations of the given. Prior even to the whole art of reason- ing, therefore, the notion of work presupposes the art of ideation, of positing essences, a thetic art. Thence follows an irreducible difference between philosophies, and that each philosophy appears to have its own ethos, coloration, and "atmosphere". "Atmosphere" -which clings less to the content of philosophy than to "dif- ferences of proportions, rank, accentuation, fruitfulness, shadow 7Paris, Felix Alcan.</page><page sequence="9">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1938-1939 9 and light variously disposed" (i49). Inversely, the point of de- parture of each doctrine vindicates itself only in and by the same doctrine in which it realizes itself. Thus everything fits together; "the architect will fashion his edifice in accordance with the ma- terials that he wishes to utilize, and because of architectural neces- sities he is led to reject certain materials and to search for certain others" (200). It is therefore necessary at the outset to admit the "plurality of philosophies", and to hold that "the cosmos vir- tually admits of a great number of equivalent solutions to the problem of gaining information concerning it" (2I4). What are, accordingly, the general laws immanent in all philo- sophical "instauration"? First there is the law of the point of view, the choice of a certain principle of unified representation of the world, which involves the renunciation of other principles in- compatible with it; and this point of departure is correlative with the point of termination, and takes for granted from the begin- ning "the adoption of the whole philosopheme" (296); that is, the pure initial necessity of taking form (264). The second law is that "within the philosopheme two factors support each other and stand out clearly as the two poles in relation to which the whole organism gains its value and significance"-"the same" and "the other" in Plato's work, potentiality and act according to Aristotle, etc. The third law is that of mediation, "a filling of the empty place" such as Platonic participation, or Cudworth's plastic mat- ter. Other laws are those of the need for dynamic scope: the ef- fort to escape through dissonance the excess of symmetry which the preceding laws would lead to; the analogical reduplications in the constructions of the doctrine; and the trenchant negation of those aspects of reality that are incompatible with the chosen ones-the negation of sensory reality in the Platonic philosophy, of substantial forms by Descartes, or of the discontinuous by Leibniz. There is also a general tendency toward indulgence in "twilight visions" and a prepossession to leave certain questions unsolved and not to approach them directly-questions such as that of accounting for appearances which confronted Parmenides and that of the union of substances in Descartes' thought. Lastly, there is the effort to mark the completion of the work by forcing into it such concrete detail as serves to confirm it. A concluding</page><page sequence="10">IO THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIX. chapter on progress in philosophy shows us doctrines adding themselves together, and thus enlarging "the plerome of the philo- sophies" which diversify the world in as many different modes. This leads us to speak of the role of imagination, which is as essential as that of reason in philosophy, and of the artistic char- acter of philosophy. "It [philosophy] is a great art; and it is Pure Art that endows philosophy with wisdom and guidance in its in- stauration" (409).-These are obviously debatable conclusions; but it must also be recognized that they represent an effort of thought that is truly personal and full of promise. II This year has been much less productive than preceding years of original works on the philosophy of the sciences. Those works that have appeared are of an almost exclusively historical nature. We may mention first two works occupying the two extremi- ties, so to speak, of the process of scientific evolution. Abel Rey's new book in the "Evolution of Humanity" series depicts La Maturite de la pensee scientifique en Grece.8 The other extremity of the evolutionary process is referred to in Helene Konczewska's book, which recounts the history and present status of the prob- lem of L' Unite de la matiere et le problem des transforma- tions.9 Rey's well-documented book is written in a rich, lively style, but it is regrettable that the author is to some extent merely re- producing his lectures or reading notes, just as they stand; but the usefulness of the work is none the less incontestable. Rey first retraces in the thought of Anaxagoras and Empedocles the ad- vance of a strictly mechanical conception of the world, and the formation of mathematical rationalism among the neo-Pythago- reans. He then turns to the Socratic science of qualities and concepts. Under this heading also comes his study of Plato, de- spite that philosopher's regard for mathematics; then comes the Atomists' science of quantity and experience on the one hand, and the school of medical men on the other. The author concludes his work with the broad outline of the grandly constructed Aris- totelian cosmology. 'Paris, Albin Michel. ' Paris, Felix Alcan.</page><page sequence="11">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, I938-1939 II Madame Konczewska has very conscientiously, intelligently, and informatively summarized ideas on the unity of matter and the possibilities of transmutation resulting from it, and she takes up first the ancient and mediaeval periods. This purely historical part of her book is by no means the least interesting; she insists upon the differences in point of view between the Greek philoso- phers who thought they observed spontaneous transmutations in nature, and the mediaeval alchemists who sought to bring trans- mutations about in the laboratory. Then, with the foundation of modern chemistry in the eighteenth century and its doctrine of simple bodies, the reaction is sharp, and the idea of the unity of matter seems to have been abandoned. But it had already re- appeared, at least as a theoretical idea, in the nineteenth century, with the discovery that atomic weights of different ultimate bodies are connected by simple relations. Finally comes the study, in the twentieth century, of the complex structure of the atom, and the bewildering wealth of contemporary discoveries in this field. Madame Konczewska's book is extremely interesting to read and very useful., Gaston Bachelard pursues his very particular studies on the bor- derland of the history of the sciences in a Psychanalyse du feu.10 By taking the term 'psychoanalysis' in its broadest possible sense, he goes about examining all the extra-scientific influences, senti- mental, social, imaginative, and sexual, which have vitiated the ideas of the older generation on nature and its most striking phe- nomena; "it is a question of discovering the active part played by unconscious values at the very foundation of empirical and scien- tific knowledge" (26). In this connection, the phenomenon of fire, which in itself is but of slight interest to modern science, has held in the traditional ideas of mankind a place of first im- portance, due evidently to its practical utility and to all the memories and impressions of a personal kind that it evokes-the home, the cooking of meals, the wine vat, burnings, comfort and intimacy, and wondering fright. With his customary verve and stylistic gifts, tending more and more toward lyricism, Bachelard has in this book brilliant pages about fire and the complexes en- couraged by it. As to the exact thesis that the author seems to want "Paris, Gallimard.</page><page sequence="12">I2 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIX. to establish at the very beginning, which would ascribe a sexual origin to the discovery that fire can be produced by friction, it is permissible to think that such an assumption trespasses a little on the borders of fantasy. III The field of psychology has been enriched this year by several important works. First of all, the recently published eighth volume of the French Encyclopedia, devoted to the Vie Mentale, displays the same regard as earlier volumes for modern trends, the same desire to rid itself of outworn, traditional approaches. Dr. Henri Wallon organized and directed the composition of this work, writing the principal chapters himself. After a general introduc- tion devoted to methods, the treatise next follows the stages, first of organic, then of psychic development: elaboration of the ner- vous system, its pathological interruptions or insufficiencies, or- ganization and behavior in animal life, parasitism, the beginnings of sociability, reactions to the external world, representation and knowledge, sexual activity. A second part investigates the cir- cumstances and objects of psychic activity: the family, school, and profession; daily and public life. The third part is concerned with the levels of mental life: the periods of rise, decline, old age, and death. An appendix deals with "sciences in formation": a study of the hand, of writing, of the human face. This simple outline shows how interesting the volume is. The large space allotted to pathology should be noted, for this is in accordance with the tradi- tion of French psychology, as also is the alliance, seemingly con- firmed by this work, between positive psychology and sociology. The rather dogmatic tone of the work and the choice of a too narrow point of view is perhaps regrettable. With so much emphasis on experimental and medical psychology the properly philosophical aspect of the matter is often but little or weakly indicated. Is it suitable for those writing an encyclopedia to fail to recognize the discussions and divergent interpretations bearing on psychological phenomena? Is it evident, for instance, that introspection is closely connected in psychology with the doctrine of substance? Is there not in this work a failure to do justice to</page><page sequence="13">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1938-1939 13 the contributions of the Bergsonians in psychology, which are brushed aside by rather too facile objections? As if to recompense for these shortcomings, Volume VI of the great Traite de Psychologie" of Georges Dumas, appearing also this year, treats of higher psychological functions under the title Les Fonctions systematisees de la vie affective et de la vie active. This work is inspired by a broader outlook and is free from the predominantly medical and physiological point of view of some of the preceding volumes. In a detailed and searching manner Dumas here investigates the logic of feelings and passions; Challaye deals with the evolution of tendencies; Lagache takes up love and hate; and Davy writes on social and moral sentiments. Perhaps the most important chapters are the work of three recently de- ceased philosophers, namely, Gustave Belot, who with all his in- genuous originality analyzed the varieties of religious feeling; Charles Blondel, who dealt with volition, and Henri Delacroix, who, in full possession of his masterly powers, has produced some writing of the highest order on aesthetic feelings, genius, and invention. Among original works, we should first mention Burloud's Principes d'une psychologie des tendences.12 This title, although slightly ambiguous, nevertheless plainly indicates the scope and aim of the work. It is an outline of a whole psychology based on the idea of tendency, rather than a treatment of various tenden- cies. This psychology aspires to being positive and scientific; but, unlike the works mentioned previously in this article, its aim is to retain an essentially introspective method, and it invokes, above all, the name of Maine de Biran. And whatever of essential im- portance might be revealed to us by intimate personal experience, beyond the Birannian "effort", would consist of a tendency, or rather a multiplicity of tendencies, of oriented and active mental attitudes, of internal forces, that may moreover be conceived as derivatives of one primal force. According to their degree of complexity these forces appear, in turn, as intention, tendency in the proper sense, schema, dynamic schemas, and idees forces. Habit consists of a constitution of dynamic forms of this kind " Paris, Fe'lix Alcan. 'Paris, Felix Alcan.</page><page sequence="14">I4 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIX. which coordinate and arrange themselves in hierarchies. "Methods of reasoning, of calculation, of literary composition, of experi- mentation, and various techniques thus comprise a comprehensive schema, itself implying incomplete operations, each of which is dependent on a distinct partial schema." From this point of view Burloud reviews the various psycho- logical and mental operations, and discovers in all of them the above-mentioned active element. Conceptual thought itself has its own schemas, the categories, capable, like all other schemas, of functioning automatically. "Intelligence awakens in the prolonga- tion of instinct, which itself is a continuation of organization; but it constructs schemas of action, whereas instinct utilizes ready- made schemas" (413). So, according to Burloud, psychology ought to search for causes rather than to concentrate on estab- lishing laws, for it would in this respect possess "an immense superiority" over the other sciences. "It [psychology] knows real causes and real actions, and it knows them immediately and ade- quately through an original intuition" (427). Thus conceived, psychology tends to develop into a general philosophy. "The forces which are active on the plane of mind", writes Burloud, "are not heterogeneous to those active on the corporeal level: both sets of forces are tendencies" (4II). But the author stops short of entangling himself in this line of thought, and it must be recognized that when he finds himself confront- ed with the metaphysical problem of consciousness, of the tran- sition from physiological processes into sentient intuitions, his thought becomes somewhat equivocal and obscure. "Sensation is at one with organic impression" (270), he declares; but such a formula should be explained! At any rate, this book is undeniably interesting and even important. The influence of Maine de Biran and Bergson is again at work in Konczewski's book on the Pense'e preconsciente13 published with a preface by Pierre Janet. The author desires to show that, behind the logical set-up which is adapted only to thought already formulated and fixed, there is the true spiritual life with its spon- taneity and creative originality, which is rather of the order of intuition. 1 Paris, Felix Alcan.</page><page sequence="15">No. I.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1938-1939 I5 IV In a work long meditated, a little abstract and difficult, but rich in thought and carefully designed to give due recognition to all the elements of the problem, entitled Esquisse d'une doctrine de la moralite',14 Rene Hubert has sought to construct a theory of morality dialectically, according to the principles of the synthetic idealism of Octave Hamelin. The latter had shown mind, with its categories, to be immanent in and necessary for the construction of every representation; but representation can be oriented toward the past or the future, and it is speculative or practical; and when practical it supposes a special assurance, for which no empiricism, either pragmatic or sociological, is able to account. Such assurance is faith in the mind itself and its constitutive exigencies; a sort of meeting-point of demonstration and intuition. The problem of mor- ality in its doctrinal aspect is, then, that of determining the a priori conditions of the possibility for consciousness of proposing to itself a practical object and of giving itself such an assurance, and its method will be dialectical. Starting from this first fact that consciousness is relation, dialectic will show these relations en- gendering and enriching each other in accord with the three-fold rhythm of thesis, antithesis and synthesis, and tending to rejoin concrete experience without ever being completely successful in doing so. Since we are concerned here with a practical representation which, so to speak, has in view the transformation of a merely possible object into a real object, it appears from the first as subject to a law. But to the law, a principle of the continuity of action and consciousness, is opposed an element of discontinuity, i.e., liberty, and possibility that the law be or not be obeyed; and the first synthesis here will be duty. But in its turn duty appears as the thesis of a new triad, and opposes itself to value, which is no longer an imposed constraint but an attraction exercised by the action to come; and the synthesis of duty and value is personality. Then comes a new triad: to personality is opposed the plurality of persons, and the result of this opposition, or its synthesis, is the moral community. But the community of persons will not func- tion without their diversity, each being obliged to keep his own 14 Paris, J. Vrin, 1939.</page><page sequence="16">i6 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIX. characteristics; and justice will come to the community to concili- ate this new opposition. Lastly, Hubert makes organization an antithesis to justice, and regards solidarity as their synthesis. He believes he is here bringing together again the realm of social, juridical, and political experience with the problems of concrete morality. The general plan and high philosophical ambition of the work are very plain to see, as are also its difficulties. The main feature is the somewhat arbitrary nature of the triads thus constituted; and there is the fear that some ideas on this level of abstraction may be used in a double sense. For instance, one starts from law, which is opposed to liberty, in order to reach duty as the synthesis; but what is law if it is not already duty? The attempt is no less interesting, for all that, to remain on a strictly critical plane and not to admit, in order to account a priori for morality, any extra- rational intuition such as that of religion. It is not in an essentially different spirit that the present writer has undertaken the completion of an earlier book, En quete d'une philosophies which was the outline of a general philosophy, and of which Lalande has already given an account in these pages, by a study on La Conduite huumaine et les valeurs ideales.'5 The earlier work had led us to conceive of a living and thinking ac- tivity as the basis of all reality, of nature as well as of humanity. On this view the conditions and directive categories of practical life would not be essentially different from the conditions and categories of knowledge; and accordingly the ideal values which orient human action must find their common basis in life and in reason itself. Analyzing these values into their traditional triple form, the true, the beautiful, and the good, we undertake to show that neither from the pragmatic nor from the sociological point of view, but only from that of an idealistic rationalism, can a satis- factory idea of them be given. It appears to us that values all gravitate closely around the notions of intelligibility and finality, and that they all reflect the demands of intelligibility and finality. At the same time, in their mutual relations values seem to consti- tute a dialectical triad. The true, constituting purely and simply a positing of existence, is the thesis, always imperfect since we 1 By D. Parodi.

But the beautiful cannot content us either, because it is only fiction, and aspires to full being; whence arises the good as the synthesis. The good is the striving to reconcile the ideal and the real, to modify the given reality according to the demands of reason and order. A final chapter attempts to show the diverse forms under which these ideal values intervene in the concrete behavior of men and reveal themselves at work throughout history. Moreover they, like reason itself, appear to belong to the world of essences, implicated in the pure act by means of which thought reflects on itself-that is to say, in this sense they appear as divine essences. L'Erreur de Narcisse'6 by Louis Lavelle and Avoir une Ame17 by Etienne Sauriau are two brilliant essays to be ascribed equally to the domains of ethics and psychology, and are valuable on account of their literary quality as much as for their penetrating and skillful analysis. Lavelle's book, whose form is reminiscent of the seventeenth century moralists' works, is dominated throughout by a deep feel- ing for spiritual activity, for all that is living and spontaneous, antecedent to and rebellious toward pure analysis. Spiritual ac- tivity should remain concrete, directed toward the world and action. To pretend to be able to grasp and define himself as an object for himself is the error of Narcissus, infatuated with his own image and incapable of attaining it. Hence the difficulty and equivocation of a complete sincerity; "how is one to talk about a being that is never finished and whose every word and action adds more to what it is?" Starting with this central idea, Lavelle sur- veys human virtues, saying of the vanity of egoism: "I can never be the goal of my action, precisely because I am the author of it." Of the necessity of collaboration with others, he says, "beings can only communicate from the moment that they recognize and accept the differences that distinguish them"; and he concludes with a theory of wisdom, of the tranquillity of soul in an ever- renewed present in which eternity itself flowers forth. The possibilities of a personality never fully defined so long as 18 Paris, Bernard de Grasset. 1 Paris, Les Belles-Lettres.</page><page sequence="18">i8 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIX. it is living are evoked in the same fashion by Souriau when he defines what it means to "have a soul". "For to have a soul means possessing riches that one does not have, living in a positive man- ner certain unreal lives, being greater than one's self, finer and richer." Therefore man should form himself according to his own intimations, but with knowledge also of how to answer to the de- mands of the occasion; for "the virtual is always conditioned by certain properties of the actual". "The greater part of the things we wish are not to be discovered in a place where they may be hidden . . . but are to be established." Thus we encounter again the aim and inspiration of Souriau's other book, analyzed earlier in this article. The auto-biographical journal the pastor Wilfred Monod pub- lishes under the melancholy title: Apres la journee18 is a docu- ment of inestimable moral value. Monod is one of the noblest fig- ures of French Protestantism, and at the same time a thinker and original theologian who is the author of a fine book on the prob- lem of the good. His journal draws us within the very life of French Protestantism with its crises and internal debates. Full of recollections and colorful notes in the first pages, the book ends in the midst of the sad conflict of two generations of believers who no longer understand each other. Another emphasis and a very different spirit appear in Gurvitch's Essais de Sociologie.19 Under this title the author as- sembles four critical studies devoted to the works of Emile Durk- heim and his school, dealing respectively with "the forms of sociability; the problem of collective consciousness; magic and the law; and Durkheim's moral philosophy". Gurvitch denounces once more the over-dogmatic aspects of Durkheim's thought and seeks to substitute for them a broader, more complex (if also an infinitely less clear) conception of sociology. Passing now to works bearing on applied moral philosophy, we shall have to cite many interesting works which are as closely connected with other disciplines as with philosophy proper. Pro- fessor Pirou of the Law School of the University of Paris is the author of a judicious Introduction a l'e5tude de 'Economie poli- tique20 in which he discusses in a lucid, impartial, and also cautious '1 Paris, Bernard de Grasset. 19 Paris, Librairie Sevey. 20 Paris, Recueils Siroy, i939.</page><page sequence="19">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1938-1939 I9 way the problems of science in general, of sociology, of the defi- nition and method of political economy, and its divisions. There has just been published a book called Inventaires III,21 a third series of inquiries and discussions carried on in the presence of the students of the Ecole Normale Superieure, and organized by the director of the school, C. Bougle. They bear on the place and state of the mind of the middle classes throughout various coun- tries of the world; but it is unnecessary to demonstrate how in- teresting such studies are in the light of the present international situation.-Under the guidance again of Bougle certain students of the Ecole Normtale Superieure have gone to study on the spot the systems of education in various countries of Europe and America. On education in Russia, Italy, and Germany they have brought back well documented and very valuable memoirs; and the study of American education made by P. Uri merits special mention here.22 -And finally, Bougle once more has been in charge of the fine volume on Education and Instruction which has just appeared for the French Encyclopedia. In its breadth, clearness of plan, lucidity, and precision of underlying ideas, and moderation, as also in the frankness of the opinions expressed with regard to the diverse tendencies of modern pedagogy and the arguments to which they give rise, particularly in France, and lastly because of its elegant material form, this volume is certainly one of the most successful achievements of the great encyclopedia undertaken under de Monzie's general direction. Two other publications of a pedagogical nature also deserve to be mentioned here. The first of these is the voluminous history of public-school teaching that Falcucci has just brought out under the title: L'Humanismne dans l'enseignement secondaire en France au XIXe si'cleY3 The second of these works is even more note- worthy, for it is the result of the course previously offered at the Sorbonne by Emile Durkheim on L'Evolution pedagogique en France.24 This well-planned work is full of ideas and suggestions, and covers the period from the Renaissance to the present day. The international political situation has caused the well-known Catholic philosopher, Maurice Blondel, to descend from the meta- 21 Paris, Felix Alcan, I939. 22 Le mouvement pedagogique a l'etranzger, 4 vols., Paris, Hermann et Cie.

XLIX. physical heights to tell us, with a grand elevation of thought and a fine impartiality of judgment, what must be thought of the struggle for civilization and peace which before the war was going on in Europe and the world.25 We may also mention here several studies on history and politi- cal philosophy by that great mind and heart that was Elie Halevy, which have been brought together under the title of 1'Ere des tyrannies,26 which was the title of the last and henceforth famous paper that the author gave before the Societe' fran aise de philosophie. Historian, philosopher, moralist, Halevy was, beneath his outwardly cold and rigorously scientific impartiality, an ardent soul; and none has characterized more firmly and courageously our troubled contemporary situation. The book contains three series of studies: the first on the history of French socialism, and on Saint Simon and Sismondi in particular; the next on the his- tory of the working class and social legislation in England since the beginning of the century; and the last on the World War (that of 194), its causes and its consequences such as we are still ex- periencing. V Among the works on aesthetics first mention must be accorded to the posthumous work of a young philosopher of highest promise suddenly struck down by illness, Louis Esteve. Under the title Etudes philosophiques sur l'expression litteraire27 this book, a collection of his articles, is devoted to precise and detailed analysis of certain difficult modern poetical writings. Here he tries (in so far as it is possible to grasp the unattainable!) to determine the conditions of that harmony peculiar to verse which constitutes its poetic charm. He deals especially with sonority and the musical properties of certain combinations of words. His studies of Mal- larme are among the most enlightening that have been written on this obscure poet. Lalo devotes his last volume, L'Art loin de le vie,28 to showing that art, instead of always being the expression of reality or of the artist's personality, as has been maintained, is also often "far from life", and masks or contradicts it. This occurs in three forms: first when art is chiefly preoccupied with technique alone, and is 2 Lutte pour la civilisation et philosophic de la paix. Paris, Flammarion, I939.

Lalo's book is enter- taining reading and valuable because of the great collection of notes on widely different writers and artists. The author, in ac- cordance with customary methods, presents such material to the reader without concerning himself very much about drawing a general conclusion from it. Lalo indeed is an enemy of all dogma- tism and even of all doctrine, championing a complete relativism as regards aesthetics. We have yet to mention the very intelligent selection and well- executed translation of excerpts from the great English essayist, the late Vernon Lee, presented to the French public by Madame B. Nouffard and entitled Etudes et reflexions sur l'art.29 VI The harvest of French books on the history of philosophy has been particularly rich this year. Several works of considerable importance are found among them. Outstanding for its originality, clearness, and vigor of thought, for extent and novelty of information, and for the vast perspec- tives that it opens up, first place must be given to Rene Berthelot's book on La pensde de l'Asie et l'astrobiologie.30 The main part of the work was first published in the Revue de Mitaphysique et de Morale during the years I932 to I937. The author himself ex- presses in a precise way the purpose of this great work. "Between the view of the world . . . held by savage peoples . . . and that of modern science and western Europe, an intermediate concep- tion long prevailed in Asia and the Mediterranean territory. It is what may be called astrobiology. In astrobiology there is an inter- linking of the idea of astronomical law and that of vegetable or animal life. On the one hand everything is alive, even the heavens and stars; in its other aspect, everything is regarded as subject to numerical and periodic laws which are both laws of necessity and of harmony and stability" (7). This conception, first formulated 'Paris, Librairie Correa. 'Paris, Payot, i938.</page><page sequence="22">22 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. XLIX. in Chaldea, the author rediscovers in China and follows from there into India, and there studies its relations with Mohammedan and Jewish monotheism and later with the formation of Christi- anity. And this same conception seems to Berthelot to be still dominant in Mexico. It is impossible to exaggerate the interest and significance of this work and the new insights that it affords even in the interpretation of classical doctrines whose formative elements we thought were well known. In addition to Abel Rey's book discussed above, the history of Greek philosophy has been enriched by Joseph Moreau's excel- lent study on the Construction de F'ide'alisme platonicien.31 And this work is completed by a second book on l'Ame du monde de Platon aux Stoiciens.32 Here we have a complete internal recon- stitution of Plato's doctrine. Moreau proceeds in a straightfor- ward way, by analyzing the dialogues very closely and arranging them in relation to each other. He shows us Plato starting out with the problem of education as stated in the Protagoras, pro- ceeding thence to questions concerning the relation of technique and pure knowledge, and next to the problem of ends and of the hierarchy of diverse aims and sciences, then going on once more to problems of morality and love, and finally approaching higher essences, the Idea, the Soul, and the Good. It is difficult, I do not say to know, but to live more intimately in an author's thought and to identify one's self more completely with his spirit than Moreau has done. He never writes of Plato from an external point of view, never orders his thought in the name of some systematic principle. From one end of this five-hundred-page book to the other, Plato himself speaks and is followed from dialogue to dialogue; we observe his ideas organizing and clarifying them- selves, and rising to the highest speculations. This is a book of the highest order of merit. To the study of Aristotle Abbe Le Blond has contributed a serious and unusual book entitled Logique et Me'thode chez Aris- tote, etude sur la recherche des principes dans la physique aris- totelicienne.33 The author seeks to distinguish Aristotle the logician and theorist of the syllogism from Aristotle the observer and savant in the proper sense of the word. Contrary to tradition, " Paris, Boivin et Cie 1939. 32 Paris, "Les Belles Lettres", I939. ' Paris, J. Vrin, 1939.</page><page sequence="23">No. i.] PHILOSOPHY IN FRANCE, 1938-I939 23 Le Blond apparently abandons the first Aristotle for the view that the really solid, original part of the master's work consists in the procedures of observation, classification, and induction, which are the only means of passing from facts to laws and of formulating the premises of the syllogism. These procedures Aristotle carried out without theorizing about them, while those for which he did offer theories are really secondary in his work. As for the history of modem philosophy and the seventeenth century, we must cite Falcucci's study on Le Probleme de la verite' chez Pascal;34 a work of high erudition by Mademoiselle Frances on Spinoza dans les pays neerlandais;35 Gueroult's fine study en- titled Etendue et psychologie chez Malebranche;36 and the great bibliography of Leibniz by Ravier.37 To a period nearer us be- longs the book with a debatable plan but of great interest, which Beguin devotes to l'Ame romantique et le reve.38 Beguin examines the dream as treated principally by the German philosophers, poets, and novelists, then also, though in a more rapid and less profound manner, the dream as viewed by French poets of the second half of the nineteenth century. It is proper, furthermore, to take notice of publications which are practical aids rather than original works, but are sometimes only the more valuable on this account, such as the collection Les Philosophes published by Felix Alcan, and arranged for a large public. This series takes from each of the classical philosophers extended and significant extracts, introducing them with short but excellent articles generally written by Andre Cresson. The Librairie Hermann is publishing some very careful and ample bibliographical reviews such as Emile Brehier's La philosophic antique; le Moyen-age by P. Chenu; and le Psychanalyse by Baudouin. Lastly there is the great enterprise of the Bibliographie philosophique which was started as a result of the International Congress of Philosophy in I937, and directed by Robin and Bayer, of which the third volume has just appeared39-a more satisfac- tory piece of work than the first two volumes as regards both material form and contents.-In addition there are two transla- tions of particular interest that merit attention; first, la Naissance 4 Paris, Privat et Didier, I939. 3 Paris, Felix Alcan, I937. a Paris, "Les Belles Lettres", I939.

He deals with the pre-Socratic philosophers in a poetic spirit, and it is quite often himself that he calls to mind in the portrayal of Par- menides or Empedocles. And Hyppolite has just rendered the first French translation of Hegel's Phenomenologie;41 he did not recoil before the extreme difficulty of the task, and the result is a very happy one. The deficiency that he has at last made good was astonishing and somewhat scandalous; he deserves our thanks on this account. We may add also that a second congress of the French associa- tions of philosophy met at Lyons in March I939. The two sub- jects of discussion were the notion of the universe, and Kant. The success attained was great-so great that the assemblage adjourned in a transformed spirit, and the congress was developed in an entirely new manner through the decision that the next meeting should take place at Brussels. This decision enlarged the scope of the organization so far as to make it a congress of all French- language philosophical societies.42 VII This year French philosophy has lost two of its most noted representatives, Dr. Charles Blondel and Lucien Levy-Bruhl. Blondel's books on la Conscience morbide on collective psychology and Marcel Proust and his collaboration with Georges Dumas in the Traite de Psychologie are well known; he contributed to the alliance of psychology and sociology, which is one of the most salient features of the positive tendency today, at least in France. In his writings the double influence of Durkheim and Bergson was mingled in the most unusual way. As for Lucien Levy-Bruhl, there is no need to recall and de- scribe his work here; it is known to all and its influence is world- wide. D. PARODI THE SORBONNE, PARIS 4 Paris, Gallimard.
