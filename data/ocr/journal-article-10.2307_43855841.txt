ISERLIS Abstract: High-resolution excavation at Tel Bet Yerah of contexts associated with large quantities ofKhirbet Kerak Ware (KKW), as well as contexts associated with local-tradition pottery both preceding and contemporary with the KKW contexts , have allowed us to extend the definition of the KKW cultural complex. Wattle and daub, polished and fired clay furnishings, a distinct lithic technology, clay andirons, symbolic objects and ground- stone artefacts can all be attributed to the KKW contexts. They differ markedly from the local tradition and find ample precedents in the ETC/ Kura- Araxes world of Eastern Anatolia and the Upper Euphrates region. These finds lend greater credence to the approach that sees the introduction of KKW in the Levant ca 2800 BCE as evidence of kin-based group migration. Résumé: A Tel Bet Yerah, la fouille intensive de contextes associés à de grandes quantités de céramique Khirbet-Kerak (KKW), ainsi que de contextes associés à la poterie de tradition locale, qu'ils soient antérieurs aux contextes KKW ou contemporains, nous a permis d'élargir la définition du complexe culturel KKW. L'usage du torchis, le mobilier en terre cuite polie, une technologie lithique particulière, les supports de foyers en argile, des objets symboliques et des éléments de mobilier lourd en pierre, peuvent tous être attribués aux contextes KKW. Ils diffèrent nettement de la tradition locale et trouvent de nombreux précédents dans le monde ETC / Kura-Araxe en Anatolie orientale et dans le Haut Euphrate. Ces découvertes donnent plus de crédibilité à l'approche qui voit l'introduction vers 2800 av. J.-C. de la KKW au Levant comme un témoignage de la migration d'un groupe familial.

One of the central quests of the past decade and a half of research and excavation at Tel Bet Yerah (Khirbet Kerak) in the Jordan Valley (fig. 1) has been to establish markers for the presence of distinct migrant communities from the Kura-Araxes/Early Transcausian Culture (ETC), and more specifically - from South-Eastern Anatolia, in the Southern Levant (Greenberg 2007; Iserlis 2009; Paz 2009; Greenberg et al. 2012).1 As early as 1951, Red-Black burnished ceramics (Khirbet Kerak Ware, henceforth KKW) and anthropomorphic 1. The Tel Bet Yerah Research and Excavation Project at Tel Aviv University has, since 2000, been engaged in the publication of excavations at the site portable andirons found in the Levant were construed as evi- dence for such a migration (Hood 1951; Amiran 1952), yet the absence of any other material testimony undermined the argu- ment, allowing scholars to suggest that other forms of cultural diffusion or transfer might be responsible for the spread of the Khirbet Kerak style {e.g., Todd 1973; Philip 1999). Pottery as such, it was suggested, could not stand in for an entire migrat- ing community (de Miroschedji 2000). Moreover, the adoption of a limited suite of cultural preferences could be effected by conducted between 1933 and 1986; excavations were renewed in 2003, with six seasons of excavations conducted to date (2014).

ISERLIS Fig. 1 - Location map of Tel Bet Yerah and main excavation areas (D. Porotsky). elements within Levantine society without necessitating any physical dislocation. Clearly, the quality of the additional evi- dence - if it existed - was such that it was either not identified in the extant assemblages, or would not be recovered using the standard excavation procedures of the latter half of the 20th c. Faced with this impasse, we chose to intensify our search by increasing the resolution of our excavation in order to cover as wide a range as possible of cultural behaviors, and by can- vassing previously excavated assemblages (Greenberg et al. 2006) for inconspicuous evidence that may have escaped us the first time around. There were two important factors that made us confident in the possibility of success: the first was our ability to isolate, in the area of renewed excavation in the northern part of the mound, a space of almost exclusive KKW-related activity that could be contrasted with a nearby contemporaneous domestic compound with almost exclusive local-tradition (i.e., non-KKW) activity. The second was our increasing collaboration with colleagues working on various aspects of the Kura-Araxes expansion, which allowed us to become better acquainted with some lesser-known aspects of the 4th-3rd millennia BCE cultural phenomenon described by Philip Kohl (2007: 86) as a 'cultural-historical community' (i obshchnost ), i.e., an array of settlements sharing a repertoire of similar behavioral and technological practices (expressed principally through pottery), that extends in a broad arc from the Iranian plateau to the Western Levant.2 Khirbet Kerak Ware, usually examined as a stand-alone set of formal and technological characteristics, implies - when studied as a complete domestic assemblage - a veritable uni- verse of cultural behaviors: certain kinds of food would have been prepared in specific ways in order to be consumed in specific spatial settings, using particular vessels made in a particular technological style, and culminating in particular patterns of discard. These are all amenable to archaeological study and significantly expand the notion of the 'KKW' cul- 2.

Thus, we have identified the KKW 'cooking ensemble', which consists of a local-tradition cooking vessel placed on an ETC-style horseshoe-shaped hob (andiron) and capped with a stylized KKW lid (Paz 2009; Greenberg et al. 2012). Our work on ceramic technology has focused on the core disposi- tions of Kura-Araxes potters that can be shown to have been maintained throughout the areas of their expansion (Iserlis et al. 2010; Greenberg and Iserlis 2012).3 Preliminary work on KKW diet4 has begun to reveal significant differences in food preparation and cuisine, which we intend to expand in order to interpret differential exploitation of the environment and deployment of economic resources. In this paper, however, we focus on matters beyond the functional use of ceramics, namely, the identification of KKW- related lithic technologies, semi- or non-permanent construc- tion, and symbolic behavior, as revealed by fine-grained archaeological investigation. The present study therefore includes the following components: - The study of the physical spaces and patterning of domestic activity and discard, contrasting KKW and non-KKW contexts over several excavation seasons; - The study of lithic technology, usage and distribution; - The study of additional ceramic and stone artefacts that betray newly introduced bodily techniques or symbolic concepts. All of these studies are conducted within an interpretive approach that considers where tradition - a connection with the past - resides within culture, and how ideology and iden- tity are maintained through embodied behavior (Werbner 2005). Rather than seeking any kind of essential ethnicity, we intend to reveal elements that served to define differences between two communities of practice that co-resided at Bet Yerah. While evidence for mutual contact, or 'cultural assimi- lation' (Boyer 2001), is abundant - both communities lived, after all, in the same site and in the same environment and most likely interacted directly with each other - we are pri- marily interested in showing where their material solutions to similar needs differed and where non-discursive expressions of difference might occur in the context of everyday activ- ity. These differences can be chalked up to different cultural traditions and values, but also to unequal access to resources stemming from economic or social disparities. This is work in progress; we hope to show here that it holds much promise for the future. THE EXCAVATION SETTING AND SPATIAL PATTERNS OF ACTIVITY Excavations since 2007 have focused on two fields within Area SA, bordering the Bet Yerah Circles Building (known as 'the Granary') excavated in 1946, Area SA-M to the north and Area SA-S to the west (figs. 1, 2 and table 1). The building is a massive stone structure, about 1000 m2 in size, built ca 2850 BC. It is composed of three broad platforms surround- ing a paved court and a pillared hall; seven shallow circles are set into the platforms. Its original function remains a mys- tery, but it seems that it was abandoned by the original builders shortly after its construction, perhaps in an unfinished state (Greenberg et al. 2012: 96-101). Soundings excavated beneath its flagstone floors have shown that the building's founda- tions were completed in early Period D of Early Bronze (EB) III; local-tradition pottery of this period was found directly beneath the pavement. Its latest use, attested by quantities of finds on its floors, was by KKW-using squatters, who modified it in several ways; these included the construction of a two- storied oven in its courtyard and several plastered bins on and adjacent to the platforms, the construction of mud brick walls in the courtyard and in one of the circles, the dismantling of 3. See M. Iserlis et al ., forthcoming in Paléorient 41,1. 4. The botanical finds from two seasons of excavation (2009-10) have been studied by A. Berger and presented in an unpublished MA Dissertation in 2013: 'Plant Economy and Ecology in Early Bronze Age Tel Bet Yerah'. Further work is being conducted by C. Longford.

The square tower at center dates to the Early Islamic period ( photo R. Greenberg). some stones from the platform and the use of those stones to build stairs between the courtyard and the platform. The field to the north of the building (Area SA-M) con- sisted of a large open plaza with an extended period of use paralleling the squatter phase within the massive structure. In 2013, soundings excavated about 20 m north of the structure identified what appears to be the northern limit of the plaza. It may therefore have been about 500 m2 in extent, of which about 120 m2 have been excavated (figs. 3-4). At the time of its construction, the plaza communicated with the public build- ing by means of a ramp leading to the east (open) side of the U-shaped structure and was itself approached from the west by a well-built stairway leading down from the paved street that flanked the building's western side. With time, in the squat- ter phase, the plaza was used for various open-air activities connected with the re-use of the Circles Building. Makeshift stairs were added along the northern façade, directly linking the platform and interior of the building with the plaza. At the base of the stairs, a large mud-paved surface extended along the entire northern façade of the building (fig. 4). It is on this plaza that a long sequence of occupation, in at least five dis- crete phases, has been carefully excavated. This occupation consists of several different activity areas, sometimes set apart by flimsy evidence for light construction: these include some very fragmentary masonry and bits of dried-mud construction. The activities included butchering, cooking, refuse disposal and flint-knapping, all accompanied by KKW ceramics and andirons, with very limited evidence for local-tradition wares (figs. 3 and 5). As presently understood, the mud-paved plaza was con- structed at the same time as the Circles Building, at the start of Period D. Probes beneath the plaza revealed only a few Period C sherds and the top of the earlier Period B (EB IB) occupation, suggesting that Period C structures were razed by the build- ers of the plaza (alternately, the plaza could have been built in Period C; the stratigraphie relation of the original plaza to the Circles Building remains uncertain). The earliest accumulation on the plaza (1) consisted of a very shallow deposit containing well-trodden material assigned to the local tradition of Periods C-D (see fig. 5, SA 1692). Directly above this thin accumula- tion we begin to find dense yellow sediment accumulated in an uneven manner, with pockets and piles of variously sorted deposits containing KKW sherds in quantity. This was capped with a hard-packed surface (2), which in some areas could be discerned as a deliberately plastered floor (fig. 5, SA 1751). Upon this surface there were renewed accumulations (3) which formed discrete patterns of spatial use in the plaza (see fig. 5, SA 1696): these included, from west to east, soft ashy deposits with parts of animal carcasses, a pile of grayish sandy soil and gravel, a broad passage extending northwards from the building, characterized by well-trodden potsherds and bone fragments in a gravelly matrix, more piles of organic waste with large mam- mal bones (including skulls) and, finally, ashy patches contain- ing hearth and andiron fragments suggesting a cooking area. The use of the plaza for various activities and middens (includ- ing a pile of flint-knapping debitage) continued into the last two phases of use (4 and 5). The final phase (5) yielded evidence for flimsy construction consisting of a wall base constructed partly of small stones and partly of recycled andiron fragments and packed clay. Most of the 37 andiron fragments recovered in the plaza come from the south-eastern sector, and the major- ity of these belong to Phases 4 and 5. These phases are the last Early Bronze Age (EBA) occupation phases in the area; they were topped by a thick mantle of nearly sterile decayed mud brick material, into which structures of Period H (3rd century BC) were introduced more than two millennia later.

Porotsky). ents a multi-roomed compound that gradually evolves over several phases beginning in Period C (EB II) and ending in Period D (mid-EB III). In each of these phases, mud brick walls with stone foundations divide the space into rectangu- lar rooms and courtyards that show evidence of prolonged use, with clear divisions between walled spaces used for food preparation, consumption and discard (the latter either in ash- pits or in the street that borders the compound on the south). Although there were some cases of changing function (an open courtyard in one phase becomes a pillared, roofed hall in the next), the basic layout of the compound changed very little over the centuries, with wall stubs serving as foundations for later renovations. With the exception of the final phase of use, the rich ceramic repertoire of Area SA-S is comprised entirely of local-tradition pots. Although there is no direct physical connection between the domestic compound and the plaza (later intrusive struc- tures intervene), the stratigraphie sequence suggests that the final Period C phase and first Period D phase in SA-S would be coeval with the construction of the public building, whereas Paléorient, vol. 40.2, p. 183-201 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="6">188 R.

Excavations of 1945-46 (IAA Archives). at the next two phases would be contemporary with the KKW- related activity in the building and on the plaza. The latest EBA activity in the area, which includes pitting and possible re-use of some spaces, introduces KKW into Area SA-S alongside local tradition pottery. This chronological relation - which is replicated elsewhere on the mound (Greenberg 2007) - has so far been supported by 14C dates that place both sequences (SA-S and SA-M) within the 2800-2700 BC range (see Regev et al. 2012: 533; the nature of the calibration curve in this part of the 3rd millennium BC impedes more precise dating). While Fig. 5 - North-South section drawing showing phases of KKW - related deposits in the plaza (D. Porotsky). the possibility that the two fields were not occupied simultane- ously, but perhaps in alternating episodes, may be entertained, it should be kept in mind that at Bet Yerah as a whole the KKW phenomenon is embedded within an uninterrupted local EB III sequence. This is attested both in stratigraphy (e.g., in Area EY, where KKW and local components co-occur in Local Strata 6A-B, 5, 4 and 3: Greenberg et al. 2006: 339-468) and in the continuity of local-tradition technology and material culture throughout EB III (Greenberg 2014). The immediate import of the stratigraphie evidence from the Circles Building and the two adjacent excavation fields is that there were two adjacent, apparently coeval, yet completely disjunctive patterns of occupation: within the building and to its north, a squatter occupation with expedient construction and extensive open-air activity, including butchering and cooking on traditional KKW hobs (andirons); to its west, a continuous occupation of a large built complex composed of several rooms and enclosed spaces showing evidence for food preparation (including pit-roasting in the early phases) and consumption. Middens representing waste products of a wide range of activi- ties accumulated in the plaza whereas discard in the domestic compound was confined to pits and to the adjacent street. An important complement to the way space was used by the 'KKW' and 'local-tradition' groups is the evidence for the use of a variety of clay installations in the Circles Building and in the Area SA-M plaza, these being completely absent on the SA-S house-floors. Within the Circles Building, a large, two-storied horseshoe-shaped clay oven was built in the courtyard; a ridged KKW stand served as its central pil- lar (fig. 6). Plastered bins were built on the stone floor of one of the circles and on the fine cobbled floor of the courtyard nearby. In the plaza itself, about 250 fragments of various clay installations have been recovered. These fall into six cat- egories (fig. 7): a.

The same as e, but burnished. The presence of these finds in the middens deposited on the SA-M plaza suggests that there were, nearby, temporary struc- tures and clay-lined installations associated with KKW pro- ducers/consumers. None of these artifacts have been found in non-KKW contexts at Bet Yerah. Instead, installations in the SA-S compound were either stone-built or consisted of buried ceramic containers: those, in turn, are absent in the KKW-rich contexts. Plastered bins are present in other KKW-related contexts at Bet Yerah (Greenberg et al. 2006: Fig. 7.16) and at Hazor, where basins with a hard clay lining were found in associa- Paléorient, vol. 40.2, p. 183-201 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="8">190 R. GREENBERG, R. SHIMELMITZ and M. ISERLIS tion with large quantities of KKW in both the old and the new excavations (Greenberg 1997: 184-186; Zuckerman 2013). The R-ll-R-8 stratigraphie sequence at Tel Bet Shean (Mazar et al. 2012: 91-102), comprising for the most part a series of partly plastered courtyard floors rich in KKW, shows many compara- ble details to the SA-M plaza, including hearths (Mazar et al. 2012: Photo 3.8) and built installations {Ibid.: Photo 3.16).5 By way of contrast, no mud-plaster or burnished clay installations are recorded at local-tradition sites of the Southern Levant, such as Arad (Amiran 1978; Amiran and Ilan 1996), Yarmuth (de Miroschedji 1988), Bab edh-Dhra' (Rast and Schaub 2003) or Khirbet el-Batrawi (Nigro 2012). Looking further afield, the use of plaster and clay can be shown to have a long pedigree in ETC settlements of the Northern Levant and South-East Anatolia. In the Amuq, plas- tered bins are introduced in Phase H, together with the major influx of RBBW: Braidwood devotes nearly the whole of his architectural description of this phase, as well as numerous illustrations, to the 'elaborate accessories' lined with fired marl clay that are its hallmark. They include bins, basins and possible rectangular and horseshoe-shaped ovens (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: 346-350, Figs. 259-268). In the Upper Euphrates region in South-Eastern Anatolia, all sites associated with the introduction of the RBBW tra- dition are marked by the extensive manipulation of clay in house furnishings. At Degirmentepe, R. Duru (1979: 69-78) discovered mud-plaster floors, benches and walls (PL 16.2), as well as stepped, clay-lined 'ash-pit ovens' and circular hearths (PL 12.1-2; Pis. 20-21). He notes the similarity of these installations to those at other Upper Euphrates sites such as Norçuntepe, Tepecik and Taskun Mevkii (Hauptmann 1982; Esin 1982; Helms 1973). G. Palumbi (personal comm.) reports the presence of fired burnished-clay linings, identified as trays, at Arslantepe, Phase VIB.3 - a phase characterized by wat- tle-and-daub structures. Also at Degirmentepe, Duru (1979: 69-70; PL 10.2) describes the piling-up of sediments in open areas, reminiscent of the use of space in the Area SA-M plaza. A significant difference between the south Levantine sites, including Bet Yerah, and the northern regions is the absence, so far, of round hearths. If this is not an artifact of chance (some fragments from Bet Yerah might be attributed to such an installation), it can be understood as evidence for the gradual attenuation of the ETC 'package' in the final leg of its expan- sion, after 2850 BC. Nonetheless, the diverse use of clay at Bet 5. Terracotta floors' associated with apparent post-holes are reported from the important KKW site of Tel Yaqush, in an unpublished dissertation by G.V. Novaček (2007): 573-575. Yerah can be reasonably attributed an origin in the south-east Anatolian expression of ETC technology and practices. LITHIC TECHNOLOGY Lithic finds may be characterized as the quintessential 'sleepers' of the archaeological record. Extremely abundant in Early Bronze Age assemblages in general (Rosen 1997), and at Bet Yerah in particular, they have the potential - rarely ful- filled - to reveal subtle cultural differences that affect the most quotidian and expedient technologies of knapping and retouch. The lithic assemblages retrieved from the new excavations at Bet Yerah consist of ca 35,000 items, recovered to a large extent by sieving (table 2). Due to the relatively large volume of excavated soil typical of Bronze Age excavations, not all sedi- ments were sieved. The sediments of loci identified as floors were sieved in full, while those of other loci were sampled. Although this causes some bias among the samples, it mainly affected the smallest fraction {i.e., chips) since an emphasis on collecting lithics was placed in all loci. The following descrip- tion of the assemblages and the frequencies provided refer to the sum of debitage and tools, leaving aside the chips, which were most likely to be affected by the method of collection. The division of the assemblages is based on chronological and cultural attributions (Periods B, C and D, i.e. EB I-III) pro- vided by the ceramic assemblage. Period D loci were further divided into three categories: (a) the 'local-tradition' group (primarily in Area SA-S), (b) the 'KKW' group (primarily Area SA-M), and (c) undetermined (not included in this dis- cussion). No distinction between the 'local tradition' group and the 'KKW' group was attempted in earlier reports on Bet Yerah lithics (Bankirer 2006). 6 Chips (&lt;1.5 cm) constitute the majority of the assemblages (92.4% of the total), indicating that flint knapping occurred in all excavated areas. Within the assemblages (tables 2-3) sev- eral chaînes opératoires are represented, of which one domi- nates the assemblages: simple flake production, which is often referred to in the lithic studies of the Levant as ad hoc pro- duction (Rosen 1997) or expedient technology {e.g., Nishiaki 2010; Parry and Kelly 1987; Shimelmitz and Zuckerman 2014). Simple blade and bladelet production, either through one reduction sequence or two, has a limited presence. Two additional chaînes opératoires are represented by end-prod- 6.

These are the tabular scrapers/flakes (Quintero et al. 2002; Rosen 1983) and the Canaanean blades (e.g., Rosen 1997: 44-55; Shimelmitz 2009). RAW MATERIAL Different types of flint were used, showing a correlation to the various chaînes opératoires. The raw materials of the Canaanean blades (Shimelmitz and Rosen 2014) are not dis- cussed here since they have little weight in the comparison between the EB III assemblages. Our focus is on the raw mate- rial of the simple flake production: 1. Flint pebbles (shoreline flint group): This type is char- acterized by small dimensions (ca 5 cm in length) and a rolled outer surface that is either cortical or patinated. It probably originated from the shore of the Sea of Galilee, where such pebbles are found in abundance. They are usually homogenous in structure and of a fine to medium grain size, and occur in a variety of colors including light gray, yellowish brown and dark brown with all three grading into each other. As the shoreline is a secondary geological context the outcrops of this flint group are unknown. 2. White flint: Highly siliceous homogenous flint. This type is not part of the variation seen in the shoreline flint group. 3. Pink flint: Highly siliceous homogenous flint. This type too is not part of the variation seen in the shoreline flint group. 4. Other: All types of raw materials not attribute to any of the above. Raw material types 2 and 3, which are not part of the spec- trum of variation characterizing the flint of the local shore-line, are rare in all assemblages, but especially in the KKW-related assemblage (table 4). Their infrequency in KKW contexts is statistically significant when compared to 'local-tradition' con- texts of both Period D (x2=9.034, df=l, p=0.0027) and Period C (x2= 14.556, df=l, p=0.0001). Since division of lithic raw materials by the naked eye demands caution, we used another criterion, referring to the type of cortex: 1) pristine calcareous cortex; 2) rolled and packed surfaces; 3) old patinated surfaces (patination covering whole or parts of the dorsal face) (table 5). It was found that rolled and packed surfaces characterized the majority of the cortical flints in all layers. This type of cortex indicates a secondary geological context, probably originating from the local sea- shore, whereas the pristine calcareous cortical cover indicates the exploitation of flint from a primary geological context.

The striking platforms of the primary element flakes and flakes are diverse; about half are linear, a quarter natural and the rest include thick plain, dihe- dral and faceted butts. The scar pattern on the primary element flakes and flakes is presented in Table 6. Unidirectional scar pat- tern is especially common in the local tradition in Periods B-D.

Among the various assemblages they are well-represented only in the 'KKW' assemblage, where they comprise 2 core tablets, 3 crested blades, 13 overshots (fig. 8: 3), 15 débordants (fig. 8: 2), 6 lateral overshots (flat flakes that removed a part of the core lateral edge that includes a crest), 27 varia-CTE and 7 unidentified CTE fragments. Notably, débor- dants and lateral overshots, typical of radial core technology (e.g., Peresani 2003 with references), are well represented only in the KKW assemblage. CORES Cores are rare in the studied assemblages (table 7). Nonetheless we identified two types of cores that are not com- monly reported in the Levantine Early Bronze Age assem- blages: cores with radial removals and 'cores-on-flakes' (fig. 8: 4), a feature more common in Paleolithic assemblages (e.g., Dibble and McPherron 2006). These were found in the KKW- related assemblage, but not in local tradition assemblages of the Period D or earlier. Due to the small number of cores in the Period C-B assemblages we could not verify this statisti- cally. Although single representations of these are known from the Chalcolithic (Shimelmitz 2007) and even the Late Bronze (Shimelmitz and Zuckerman 2014), in general they do not seem to represent a substantial strategy of core technology in the late flint industries of the Levant. In contrast, both of these types are better represented in ETC industries of Eastern Anatolia, as exemplified by Nor§untepe and Sos Höyük (Schmidt 1996; Sagona et al. 1998). TOOLS AND IMPORTED ARTIFACTS The variety of tool types is presented in Table 2. The Period D assemblages are characterized by a lower frequency of sickle blades (or glossed items; Anderson et al. 2004) in comparison to the Period B-C assemblages. Within Period D, KKW-related assemblages have a higher frequency of borers. With regard to imported finished products, we found sig- nificant patterns among Canaanean blades and tabular scrap- ers. The Canaanean blade, which typifies the Levantine EB lithic assemblage (Rosen 1997), was manufactured in several specialized workshops across the Levant (Shimelmitz 2009 and reference therein). Comparing the presence of Canaanean blades in the Bet Yerah assemblages (including tools and unshaped blades) reveals a lower frequency in the KKW-related assemblage when compared with local-tradition assemblages of Periods D (x2=11.119, df=l, p=0.0009), C (x2=29.914, df=l, pcO.OOOl) or B (x2=44.801, df=l, p=0.0001). In addition, the Canaanean blades in the KKW assemblage are more frag- mented (fig. 8: 5-6, 8-9), suggesting that a significant number Paléorient, vol. 40.2, p. 183-201 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="12">194 R.

Tabular scraper blanks were also a specialized craft prod- uct manufactured at several localities well south of Bet Yerah (Quintero et al. 2002; Rosen 1983). At Bet Yerah, tabular scrapers are generally rare (fig. 8: 7), but particularly so in the KKW assemblage. In addition, we have identified items that we refer to as 'tabular scraper spalls': flakes removed while retouching and re-sharpening tabular scrapers. Tabular scrap- ers are characterized by a dark brown highly siliceous flint and by cortical surfaces that were ground to a smooth, uniform face (Rosen 1983 and 1997). The flakes removed from the tab- ular scrapers are characterized by traces of the scaled retouch that is rare on other items and they also bear a segment of the ground façade of cortex at their distal end. These items appear less frequently in KKW assemblages, differing significantly from local-tradition assemblages of Period D (x2=12.461, df-1, p=0.0004) and Period C (x2=7.610, df=l, p=0.0058).

PATTERNS WITHIN THE LITHIC ASSEMBLAGES The comparison of flint assemblages shows several signifi- cant patterns within and between the newly introduced KKW and indigenous local-tradition assemblages: - While both groups usually used local raw material for onsite production, the local tradition had greater access to superior raw material of non-local origins. - Flake production shows two chaînes opératoires. The first is primarily characterized by unidirectional reduc- tion, which begins with single striking platform cores that are often transformed during reduction into multi- platform cores in a process where, after abandoning the first striking platform, a second one and even a third one are occasionally made (e.g., Shimelmitz and Zuckerman 2014). While this reduction strategy appears in both the local-tradition and KKW-related Period D assemblages it is more typical of the local tradition and of the Early Bronze Age of the Levant in general. The second chaîne opératoire is a radial flake production. This chaîne opé- ratoire is characterized by the radial cores, CTEs (the débordants and the lateral flake overshots), and the multi-scar patterns on the flakes (fig. 8:1). Elements of the second chaîne opératoire are primarily found in the KKW assemblage and are rare in the local tradition. - The KKW contexts show far fewer imported finished products (Canaanean blades and tabular scrapers) than those of the local tradition. These observations point to significant differences in status and/or integration in local economic networks (access to high quality raw materials and finished products) between KKW and local contexts and to no less significant differences in techno- logical behavior. The chief technological difference lies in the use by KKW consumers of radial flake production, a technique that is rare in the Levantine EB but common in South-Eastern Anatolia (Schmidt 1996). This difference in technology rep- resents a non-discursive practice or habitual behavior that offers an excellent indicator of cultural identity, since motor habits and bodily techniques are far less likely to have been emulated than mere elements of form (e.g., Lemonnier 1993). And while the KKW-related assemblage is different in many respects from the local-tradition assemblage of Period D, the latter closely resembles those of Periods C and B, which in turn exhibit characteristics that are well-represented in many of the EBA assemblages of the Levant (e.g., Friedmann 1996; McConaughy 1980; Rosen 1997; Rosen and Grinblat 1997), highlighting the unity of the indigenous lithic tradition. Also important is the rarity of imported finished products in the KKW-related assemblage. Whether this is a matter of choice or constraint, it implies a limited degree of integration of the 'KKW people' within the wider economic system, very much in tune with the other elements of the material culture 'package'. Their limited use of non-local raw material might be a reflection of this as well. Also worth noting is the absence of obsidian and of arrowheads - two features that are common in ETC assemblages in the Anatolian and south Caucasian sites (e.g., Sagona et al. 1998; Schmidt 1996; Shimelmitz 2011). While the absence of obsidian is not surprising, given the dis- tance and dearth of inter-regional trade in the EBA (Rosen et al. 2005), the absence of arrowheads may be more significant to our understanding of KKW lifeways. ADDITIONAL CERAMIC AND STONE ARTIFACTS A number of terracotta and ground-stone finds comprise a further category of objects from KKW rich contexts that expand the KKW 'package', and to which we assign, with varying degrees of confidence, an extraneous origin. We begin with objects found in our excavations in the Area SA-M plaza, adding to them some previously overlooked finds from the old previous excavations.

GREENBERG, R. SHIMELMITZ and M. ISERLIS ANDIRONS The small, portable horseshoe-shaped hobs have long served as a link between KKW and the Kura-Araxes world (de Miroschedji 1986; Shimelmitz 2003). While usually presented in the context of the KKW ceramics, their simple technique, rough finish and coarse clay put them in a category of their own, as both functional and symbolic artifacts. Scores of and- iron fragments have been found in KKW contexts at Bet Yerah in the past (see, e.g., Greenberg et al. 2006: Figs. 2.35: 9; 3.27: 10-12; 4.4: 4; 5.86: 11-15; 5.91: 20, 23; 5.92: 11; 5.95: 8; 6.31: 17; 8.95: 14; 8.97: 8-11; 8.98: 11; 8.100: 9; 8.101: 10 and 8.105: 10), to which we here add 37 fragments, representing at least thirty separate artifacts, found in the SA-M plaza. All but a handful of the fragments are sooty, indicating that both large and small andirons were functioning hobs, presumably sup- porting pots of various sizes. The andirons come in a variety of sizes, ranging from 6.2 to 11 cm in height, and 1.1 to 3.7 cm in thickness. A relatively well-preserved andiron (fig. 9), near the smaller end of the size spectrum, stands 8.5 cm high, about 16 cm deep (front to back) and would have been about 12 cm across (between the uprights). Three of ten uprights were dec- orated: one with incisions and a possible indication of a mouth (the upper end is broken), one with a nose, and one with a nose, four (?) eyes, and crossed incisions below them (fig. 9). The decorated andirons most closely resemble those of the Amuq (Braidwood and Braidwood 1960: Fig. 290). More importantly, the evidence for their everyday use in cooking transforms them from exotica to indexes of habitual activity. FIGURINES Several animal figurine fragments have been found on the SA-M plaza, of which two exhibit notable features. Figure 10: 2 shows the fore-part of a horned animal with stumpy legs, whereas Figure 10: 1 the rear of an animal with pointy legs and a raised tail revealing a deeply incised anus. This latter feature is, as far as we know, unique in the Southern Levant, but alongside both the stumpy and the pointy legs, it finds sev- eral very persuasive parallels at Norçuntepe (Schmidt 2002: Pis. 80-81). The KKW figurative style is also exhibited in a burnished applique that was apparently attached to a KKW krater (fig. 10: 4); on this item is a head with deeply incised nostrils and a thicket of horns or antlers above it. Another unique piece from Bet Yerah is a small, lumpy pawn-like figurine with a concave base and a pinched beak (fig. 10: 3). Unparalleled in the Levant, it appears to belong Fig. 9 -At the left , a partial andiron with evidence of use ( SA 6201. 1 ); at the right , detail of an andiron upright with incised anthropomor- phic decoration (GB 2115.01) (R.

SYMBOLIC CERAMIC VESSELS Two fine miniature renditions of typical KKW vessels are shown in Figure 11. One is a burnished bi-conical stand from the uppermost phase in Area SA-S. The other is a red- slipped and burnished s-profile bowl with an omphalos base from Area SA-M. The two artifacts reproduce two of the most characteristic products of the KKW potter, not to be found in the local tradition. Their significance to our discussion lies in the translation of technical practices into the symbolic sphere. Such objects were miniaturized, partial representations of the culture itself, very likely used for the transmission of values within the group, perhaps between generations (e.g., as toys). A penchant for miniature vessels can be seen in the ETC occu- pation at Degirmentepe (Duru 1979: Pl. 51, 2).

Pestles are generally rare in the EBA ground-stone assemblage of the Southern Levant, appearing to have largely fallen out of use by Chalcolithic times (Rowan 2006: 214-215). However, a number of rather hefty artifacts that answer to the description of pestles or hammer-stones have been found in KKW contexts at Bet Yerah. The basalt pestle from the north- ern part of the Circles Building plaza, about 15 cm long and weighing 940 gr, has a slight concavity that allows the base to be defined (fig. 12). Two pestle fragments (fig. 12) from the open area, similar to our plaza, excavated at the south of the mound in 1951 and found to contain evidence of KKW-related occupation (BS 039; Greenberg et al. 2006: 134, Fig. 5.85), have a round or oval-sectioned upper part and a pronounced shoulder indicating a broad rectangular base. The same con- text provided an elongated hammer-stone with a concave mid- riff; two similar artifacts come from KKW contexts excavated in 1985-86 (fig. 13), and a fourth one from a KKW context excavated west of the Circles Building by the Oriental Institute in 1963.7 Weighing about 220-300 gr and showing signs of 7.

Pestles with pronounced shoul- ders and concave hammer-stones are common in ETC settings in South-Eastern Anatolia (Duru 1979: Pis. 49, 2 and 50, 1; van Loon 1978: Fig. 138B) and beyond (Hamon 2008: 104, fig. 19d-g; Kakhiani et al. 2013: Fig. 57, 5). But their presence in the EB III Levant must be seen as no less than anachronistic, reviving a long-forgotten mode of manual processing. DISCUSSION Following a prolonged impasse created by the absence of high-resolution excavations in Levantine contexts of the red- black burnished tradition, we can safely state that the Tel Bet Yerah excavations bring new evidence bearing upon the ques- tion of early 3rd millennium migrations from Anatolia to the Levant. In this presentation we have focused on aspects of spa- tial organization and on objects clearly associated with Khirbet Kerak Ware excavation contexts. They represent technological traditions (plaster and lithics), motor habits (tools, cooking practices), and symbolic concepts (figurines, miniature ves- sels) bound together by a shared tradition. All may be said to represent objects of little prominence and of limited visibility. That is, they are unlikely to have been the product of emu- lation or intentional borrowing. On the contrary, techniques of plastering, flint knapping, cooking and processing (pound- ing) are among the most likely to have been acquired through domestic habituation and intergenerational instruction; from parents to children and from older to younger siblings. Since each of these categories shows affinities with elements found in the nearest concentrations of ETC-derived communities, in the Amuq and in the Upper Euphrates region of South-Eastern Anatolia, the most likely explanation for their presence at Bet Yerah is that they arrived with a migrant population. Our preoccupation with the less-prominent elements in Paléorient, vol. 40.2, p. 183-201 © CNRS ÉDITIONS 2014</page><page sequence="17">New evidence for the Anatolian origins of 'Khirbet Kerak Ware people' at Tel Bet Yerah (Israel), ca 2800 BC 199 the cultural repertoire (as compared, for example, to ceram- ics, metallurgy or economic activity) highlights what might be considered the most fundamental differences between the migrating and host communities. The newcomers not only used space differently and maintained their own ceramic tra- dition: they had an intimate interest in clay, adapting it to far more uses than the indigenous inhabitants; they had a strong lithic tradition and their own approach to flint reduction; they prepared their food differently and they clearly were not fully integrated into the urban economy. G. Philip (1999) has char- acterized this difference as 'opting out' of urban society, but he does not go far enough. It seems that the 'KKW people' were 'opting in' - or hanging on - to a tradition with a strong conservative streak (pointedly expressed in their manipula- tion of clay and plaster, their undermining of urban spatial rules and their resistance to ceramic specialization) that reaches back to Neolithic life-ways. While there is no doubt that interaction with Levantine cultural values occurred in every stage of the migration, it is surprising to see how tena- ciously difference appears to have been maintained, at least during the period represented by the Area SA finds; there are more extended sequences on the site, showing a change in KKW technology and a greater dispersal within local-tradi- tion contexts in later EB III (Greenberg 2007; Iserlis 2009). In conclusion, evidence is surely mounting that Khirbet Kerak tradition and practice shares several significant traits with Kura-Araxes/ETC communities in South-Eastern Ana- tolia, significantly expanding the range of shared cultural attri- butes beyond ceramic technology and giving more substance to the hypothesized migration from this region to the Levant shortly after 2900 BC.
