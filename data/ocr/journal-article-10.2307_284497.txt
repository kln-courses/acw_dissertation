He noticed, too, that inspiration seemed characteristically to strike them initially in adolescence, when they were 'first shaken by the tempestuous passion of love'. He goes on to com- ment, though, their sensuousness and irregularity notwithstanding, that poets were not 'founders of families'%1 I gratefully acknowledge the co-operation of Oliver Fulton and Bernadine Jacot in the preparation of this article, which is based in part on data gathered by the National Surveys of Higher Education, sponsored by the Carnegie Commission on Higher Educa- tion and supported in part as a co-operative research project by funds from the United States Office of Education. The interpretations put forward here do not necessarily reflect the position of the Office of Education, and no official endorsement by the Office should be inferred. All three tendencies-to be sensuous and erotic, to lead a wayward life, and to have few children-may well have complex biological, psychological and cultural determinants. It follows that speculation about intellectual commitment should not be couched in terms that are too reductive or simple. Galton's conclusions, nonetheless, are in keeping with evidence suggesting that the choice of humane as opposed to scientific subject-matter is linked to freedom from convention ;2 to ease of access to non-rational 'primary process' thought ;3 and to qualities of life style that can be measured in surprisingly down-to-earth, demographic terms. It was found, for example from an analysis of the I969 edition of Who's Who, that eminent British scholars in the arts were notably infertile.4 Over 40% of the eminent classicists mentioned in that volume, both married and single, had no children. The equivalent figure for eminent arts specialists as a whole- that is to say, specialists in classics, history, philosophy, and English literature-was 31%. The figure for eminent physical scientists was by comparison low (15%), and for eminent biologists lower still (8%). The sample of creative writers drawn from Who's Who was, unfortunately, less than satisfactory. Somewhat in line I F. Galton, Hereditary Genius (London: Macmillan, I869). 2 L.

From the Who's Who data, in other words, it seems that while scholarly as opposed to creative involvement in the arts is associated with different rates of divorce, scholars and creative writers are alike in that they quite often have no children. The next step has been to compare the British Who's Who evidence with that from a sample collected in an entirely different manner-a postal survey of American university teachers, undertaken in May I969 for the Carnegie Commission on Higher Education. The survey was conducted by question- naires, sent to six out of every seven of the faculty members in some 300 American colleges and universities, institutions themselves broadly repre- sentative of the spectrum of American higher education. Over 6o,ooo com- pleted questionnaires were returned, and there was a response rate of just over 6o%. For the purpose of the present data, the analysis has been restricted to respondents who are male, white, and who are working at universities of high professional status-I i,657 respondents in all.5 The Carnegie and Who's Who samples are by no means comparable, the Carnegie sample covering a wider range of academic specialities, a wider range of academic accomplishment, and being based on a sample of men who are not only younger than those drawn from Who's Who (most of whom were in their late fifties), but who differ too in the cultural and educational systems within which they work. Further, in the British sample, the arts specialists had differed from their scientific colleagues in terms of their social class of origin, approximately twice as many of the former coming from private schools. In the Carnegie sample, there was no such class difference between the arts and science. All the more striking, therefore, the similarities in the rates of infertility the two samples display: as Figure I shows, high in the arts, lower in science. In the Who's Who sample the frequencies of childless marriage were higher in the arts than in the sciences (i6% and 9% respectively). In the Carnegie sample, this was not so. On the other hand, the difference in the proportions remaining single seems to be approximately constant on both sides of the Atlantic-not only between the arts and sciences, but also within science, between biologists and physical scientists (see Figure 2). It is also worth noting, parenthetically, that in Figure 2 the biologists do not fall midway between the arts specialists and the physical scientists, but appear to constitute a group in their own right. Another recent study confirms this,6 and in addition points to sharp differences in social origin and life style within biology, between the more traditional natural historians and the experimental 5 For a detailed description of the sample of institutions, the samples of teachers, the definition of institutional quality, etc., see M.

The evidence, in other words, seems to suggest that differences between groups of academic specialists may demand a descriptive scheme more complex than that which a simple arts-science spectrum could provide. The parallels in rates of marriage and fertility described above, drawn from different samples, and cutting across different academic and cultural tradi- tions, lend support to a view of intellectual development both compatible with Galton's remarks, and implicit in certain aspects of psychoanalytic thought.7 This view may be summarized in the form of two propositions. (i) That the drive to think intensively in any sphere involves the trans- formation or 'sublimation'-of energies that might otherwise find expression in more direct and physical terms. ('Sublimation' refers here to the expression in symbolic form of what would otherwise be an impulse towards physical action). (2) That the energy underlying all human action expresses itself in terms of two psychological modes or principles: the 'aggressive' and the 'sexual'. These may act together, and their effects may overlay one another in complex ways. But where the action of the 'aggressive' principle predomin- ates, the individual will primarily concern himself with issues of law-making and control. He will also tend to deal with inanimate nature, or with people as though they were inanimate. Whereas if the 'sexual' principle predomin- ates, the individual's approach will be more exploratory and evocative. He will tend to work with people, to concern himself with human emotions and human relationships, and to approach inanimate nature in anthropomorphic terms. To these two main propositions may be attached three subsidiary ones. (i) That predominance of the 'sexual' principle is associated with a greater degree of access than is the 'aggressive' principle to 'primary process' thought-that is to say, to the intuitive, non-rational and metaphorical, as opposed to the explicit, rational and matter of fact. (ii) That the 'sexual' principle is associated with weak boundaries between one sphere of thought, or life, and another. In contrast, the action of the 'aggressive' principle permits sharper compartment- alisation. (iii) That the 'sexual' principle will be associated to a greater degree than the 'aggressive' principle with lack of adherence to socially defined conventions. The professional thought of the scientist can be envisaged, in the light of these propositions, as largely encapsulated from his thinking about other matters. Outside his work, he is seen as following a conventional pattern. In contrast, the specialist in the arts is envisaged as thinking-both professionally and more personally-in a diffusely 'eroticised' way. In the case of poets, there is biographical evidence to suggest what the consequences of such diffuse sublimation are. Lou Andreas Salome, for example, has described with some 7 See e.g., D. C. McClelland, 'On the psychodynamics of creative physical scientists', H. E. Gruber, et al., (eds.), Contemporary Approaches to Creative Thinking (New York: Atherton, I962); N. 0. Brown, Life Against Death (London: Routledge and Kegan Paul, 1959). 7*-SS * *</page><page sequence="4">308 Liamn Hudsonz candour both the personal confusions of the poet Rilke, and his 'noxious hostility to the body.8 Such consequences, however, are not all harmful. Indeed, in Rilke's case, there are grounds for believing that his personal confusion may well have been a condition of his creativeness. For his work leaves little doubt that, although his private life was halting, Rilke possessed preternatural sensitivity to the symbolic implications of images and metaphors that are at root sexual.9 Informal models of the kind advanced here may help to focus and co- ordinate factual enquiry in a field where research methods are notable for their failure to meet the demands of their subject-matter. Such models, none the less, should not be interpreted in too reductively biological a fashion. If a scientist marries, while a contemporary in the arts remains unmarried, they may follow these different paths, not for a single reason, but for several reasons that are related. Although such individuals are seen as differing because it is, respectively, their aggressive and sexual energies that have been trans- formed in the establishment of their styles of thought, and styles of life, such quasi-biological differences between them are held to influence their behaviour only through the mediation of processes that are more purely psychological. As the three subsidiary propositions suggest, the transformation of aggressive and sexual energies is seen as leading to differing degrees of access to the non- rational; to different attitudes towards apparently arbitrary boundaries and conventions; and, in particular, to different attitudes towards the transgression of those conventional boundaries that define the masculine sex-role. These habits of mind are viewed as mutually supportive in their influence on the actions of the individual concerned; and, once established, as largely autonomous. It is these habits of mind which directly concern us-the quasi-biological energies having in contrast, as Freud himself acknowledged, more the status of inter- pretative fictions. 8L.
