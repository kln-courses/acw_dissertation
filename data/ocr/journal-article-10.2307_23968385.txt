<plain_text><page sequence="1">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 Within ancient Near Eastern thought the moment of creation was deemed to connect immediately to the existing order. The primeval ordering of the world, however it was conceived, was therefore of unique philosophical and theological significance. It conferred upon contemporary norms a legitimacy and perman ence, beyond their true validity, which guaranteed them absolute status. The priestly account of creation in Genesis 1:1-2:4a in a similar way confers upon Israel and her cultic institutions a legitimacy and validity within the given orders of creation. In so doing it reveals one of the most distinctive Hebrew epic traditions as seamless with the prevailing cultural norms of the ancient world. It is evident that Genesis 1:r-2:4a draws upon the analogy of two different modes of creation in presenting its account. There is the effortless word of God which orders the world into being in an instant. This is then duplicated by a further account which speaks of the divine activity in a more earthy and basic way; that is, in terms of craftsmanship and manual labour seemingly more in keeping with the creation account of the Yahwist (J) in Genesis 2-3. The verbs used for this activity are 'to separate' (הבליל; 1:4, 1:4, 7) and 'to make' (16 ,1:7 ;עשה). This latter also occurs in the opening line of the J narrative (Genesis 2:4b) and again with reference to the garments Yahweh made for his erring crea tures (3:21). Another verb which seems to correspond in meaning with the simple word 'make', yet is restricted in priestly tradition (P) to the divine activity and is usually translated as 'create', is 1.ברא It is worth noting that not only does the divine word have 1 The outstanding features of ברא are that it is only used with God as subject, and never has the accusative of the material from which things are constructed. It is obviously significant in the places where it is used in the Genesis 1 narrative. That is in 1:1 at the very beginning, in the formation of the great sea monsters (v. 21), in the making of humankind (v. 27) and again at the end (2:3). Yet בלא corresponds in many ways with the 'work' account of creation. J. Morgenstern, 'The Sources of the Creation Story—Genesis 1:1-2:4a', AJfSL. Vol. XXXVI no. 3 (1920), pp. 169-212, placed it in his 'sabbath' tradition. Clearly in Genesis 2:3 it is complementary to and not in opposition to the idea of making (עשה).Whereas in 2 Isaiah ברא is applied to God's actions in the present, for P its use is restricted to describing God's creative action at the beginning. It has a deliberate and considered significance when it occurs in P, but this falls short of creatio ex nihilo.nihilo. It is best understood in the context of the alternative verbs 'separate' and 'make'. ) Oxford University Press 2000 [Journal of Theological Studies, NS, Vol. 51, Pt. 2, October 2000]</page><page sequence="2">442 JAMES E. ATWELL a foundational significance for the whole of priestly theology,2 but so also does the concept of separation.3 Both traditions of creation by word and by work are therefore integral to the whole priestly scheme. The question arises: do we have here two distinct traditions about creation with their own 'tradition history' which have been combined? F. Schwally4 in 1906 argued that the two types of creation in Genesis 1 are contradictory and therefore must have separate tradition histories. This suggestion was taken up and thoroughly examined by J. Morgenstern.5 He gave priority to what he called the 'divine fiat' version of the creation narrative, over against the manufacturing version which he called the 'sab bath' version. The 'divine fiat' narrative he took to consist of eight divine commands which form the basis of the Genesis nar rative. These, he envisaged, were cast in a pure form with text book evenness. This material, he thought, had been supplemented by rather rugged secondary material which, unlike Schwally, he did not reckon had ever been a tradition of its own. The intention was to popularize the rather scholastic text. This secondary mater ial he labelled 'sabbath' as he supposed the divine rest to relate to the exhausting procedure of the more physical labours. The scheme of a week he connected with this supplementary material, 2 The priestly creation account represents a charter that stands over all sub sequent sacred history. That account is not simply an isolated few verses that happens to preface the priestly narrative. Rather it is securely bonded to all that follows. The picture of the creator in the opening chapter of Genesis is summarized by the psalmist: By the word of the Lord were the heavens made; And all the host of them by the breath of his mouth. (Ps. 33:6) But that same picture holds good for subsequent history also. God speaks and it comes to pass. Whether it is the instruction to Abraham to circumcise him 'that is born in thy house' (Genesis 17:13) which is deliberately and carefully fulfilled a few verses later (v. 23), or whether it is the instruction to Moses in the detail of the setting up of the tabernacle (Exodus 40:1 ff.) which concludes: 'Thus did Moses: according to all that the Lord commanded him, so did he' (Exodus 40:16), the word of God, as a matter of central priestly theology, never returns to him unfulfilled. 3 Things need to be regulated, ordered, put in their place. Not least is this true of the cult which distinguishes Israel from the nations. Within the cult Israel must be separated from her uncleanness (Leviticus 15:31 ff.). Aaron and his sons must be set apart from the children of Israel (Leviticus 22:2) and the Levites must be separated (הבדיל) from among the children of Israel (Numbers 8:14). The reader is face to face in the subsequent narrative with the selfsame concept of separation that permeates the first chapter of Genesis. It is part of the 'overture' effect of Genesis 1:1—2:4a in relation to the whole priestly work noted by C. Westermann. 4 Schwally, 'Die biblisehen Schöpfungsberichte', ARW 9 (1906), pp. 159-75. 5 J. Morgenstern, op. cit.</page><page sequence="3">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 443 and also the motif of God declaring his work good as it envisages the possibility of failure. M. Lambert6 reversed Morgenstern's assumptions as to which of the two accounts should be considered the prior, and which supplementary. The matter was taken up again by G. von Rad in his attempt to identify two literary strands throughout the P narrative.7 He related his two strands to the two separate creation accounts, 'action account' A and 'command account' B. Von Rad's attempt marks the end of any real hope that literary criticism might yield up a solution to the problem of sources in Genesis 1. In his commentary von Rad himself makes only passing reference to this endeavour. W. H. Schmidt8 has turned to 'tradition history' for a way out of the impasse. He believes the failure of literary criticism makes it clear that there are not two distinct traditions about creation with their own prehistory. There is one single line of development. However he does conclude that the account of creation by action must be primary, and that one can identify what seem to be the oldest elements in the tradition. But he would still stress that the 'priestly mind' is evident not simply in the command account with the oldest elements, as it were, surgically removed. It is also there in the way the priestly tradents have over the genera tions selected, developed and shaped the old material. Let us take as our starting point for investigation those elements which Schmidt identifies as at the source of a long period of priestly transmission: [1:2] And the earth was waste and void, and there was darkness over the great deep. And the spirit of God hovered over the waters. [4] And God separated the light from the darkness. [7] God made the firmament and separated the waters beneath the firma ment from the waters above the firmament. [9] (according to the Greek translation): And the waters under heaven gathered themselves into one meeting-place, and the mainland became visible. [12] The earth brought forth green herbs, which yielded seed ... and trees which yielded fruit with seeds. [16] God made the two great lights, the greater to rule by day, and the lesser to rule by night, and the stars; and God placed them in the firma ment of heaven. M.

Where did the original cosmology come from? and 2. How does the patterning of seven imposed upon the acts of creation relate to the tradition history of Genesis 1?

A Comparison of the Priestly Creation Narrative with the Cosmology Cosmology of Ancient Mesopotamia The template which is normally held up against the priestly cosmology for comparison is that of ancient Mesopotamian reli gion, and here particularly the work known as Enuma Elish.

Gunkel.11 Less emphasis has been accorded to comparison with Egyptian cosmology. It is the conviction of this study that investigation there provides significant contours for comparison. Let us first investigate the more usual comparison. What exactly are the resemblances between the priestly creation account and Mesopotamian parallels, particularly Enuma Elish} A. Heidel has discussed those elements of the priestly creation tradition that, in his judgement, show possible parallels with Enuma Elish. He concludes: In fact, the divergences are much more far-reaching and significant than are the resemblances, most of which are not any closer than we would expect to find in any two more or less complete creation versions ... But the identical sequence of events as far as the points of contact are concerned is indeed remarkable. This can hardly be accidental.12 The points of contact and their order are presented by Heidel in table-form as follows (the numbering is our own):13 Enuma Enuma Elish Genesis [1] Divine spirit and cosmic Divine spirit creates cosmic matter are coexistent and matter and exists indepen coeternal. dently of it (1:2).

Gunkel, Schöpfung und Chaos in Urzeit und Endzeit (Göttingen, 1895), asserts the Babylonian origin of the priestly creation narrative. He allowed for dependence upon an intermediate Hebrew poetic recension of the Marduk myth which used the divine name Yah weh. 12 A. Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis (Chicago, 19512), p. 130. E. A. Speiser, Genesis,Genesis, Anchor Bible (New York, 1964), p. 9 accepts Heidel's conclusions as proven. 13 A. Heidel, op. cit., p. 129.</page><page sequence="6">446 JAMES E. AT WE L L The correspondence between the items designated [1] is general rather than specific. The idea that the gods developed from within the raw material of creation is indeed standard in the ancient Near East. Where the pre-creation condition was pictured as a watery abyss it was deemed to contain the origin of the gods as well as the origin of the natural world. The two were reckoned as coexistent. If Genesis 1:2 should be taken as a description of the primeval condition prior to creation then it may also be contrasted with EnumaEnuma Elish. In the Enuma Elish tradition the hallmark of the primeval ocean is its torpor; the sleep of the primeval deities is eventually disturbed by the noise of the younger gods. There is no real parallel to the dynamic 'Spirit of God' as one element of the primeval condition distinct from its other qualities. In the same way [2] is also a general point relating to ancient Near Eastern myth in general rather than Enuma Elish in particu lar. It is hard to think of any other way an account of creation in the ancient Near East could begin if it were not to commence with a description of the pre-existent formless condition. This is hardly remarkable. W. G. Lambert, who has reassessed the implica tions of correspondence between Genesis 1 and Enuma Elish, observes that a watery beginning is to be found elsewhere in cosmogonies of other peoples. He further dismisses the linguis tic correspondence between the Hebrew תהום tehöm (masculine) without the article in Genesis 1:2 and the personified Tiamat (feminine) in the Akkadian epic as not significant: 'The etymolo gical equivalence is of no consequence, since poetic allusions to cosmic battles in the O.T. use Yam and tehöm indiscriminately.'14 Although 'darkness' is an explicit feature of Genesis 1:2, it is not so in Enuma Elish. It has to be surmised by Heidel from the account of Berossus. There is, therefore, little of real identity upon which to construct a specific relationship in item [2], As regards [3], the claim to find a correspondence between light emanating from the gods, which is at most an incidental item to be deduced from the Babylonian narrative, and the crea tion of light in Genesis 1 which is definitive for the whole narra tive, is not convincing. There is no real linkage of common purpose and direction. Heidel points to the creation of the firmament [4] and the crea tion of dry land [5] for the next two items of correspondence. The narrative resemblance is due to the nature of ancient Near Eastern creation mythology. The division of heaven and earth, a 14 W. G. Lambert, 'A New Look at the Babylonian Background of Genesis', jfTS NS, r6 (1965), p. 293.</page><page sequence="7">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 447 single act with a double consequence, is the primary motif of almost every cosmology of the ancient Near East. The identical sequence is therefore no indication of any relationship between the two different accounts beyond their common provenance within the ancient Near East. Any justification of a specific corre spondence between Enuma Elish and the priestly creation account will need to go beyond this general observation. W. G. Lambert does draw attention to what he recognizes as a significant resemblance between the two accounts. He maintains that the act of dividing cosmic waters does yield up a valid com parison with Enuma Elish, and that there are no other examples in the ancient Near East at that period. Against that we might press the significance of 'division' for priestly theological reflec tion. It does seem that a precedent for the application of the con cept of division to the primeval waters may have been closer at hand than Mesopotamia. The verb translated by the RV as 'broken up' (בקע) in the P flood narrative (Genesis 7:11) seems to be part of an ancient poetic tradition of Canaanite origin. It wit nesses to a local vocabulary which speaks of 'cleaving' or 'divid ing' waters. The same verb occurs with those associations in Psalm 74:15: 'Thou didst cleave fountain and flood'. By extension it comes to be used in the 'mythicization' of the rescue at the Red (Reed) Sea.15 In Enuma Elish the particular application of the given creation pattern is the division of Tiamat's watery carcass into two pieces which creates heaven and earth, although some 'fixing' by the deity in both areas is then necessary. In fact the priestly creation account is less straightforward. The creation of heaven and earth remains an important and primary twin concept, as the opening verse (1:1) reminds us, but the management of the waters is more complex. In addition to the account of the 'dividing' of the waters (v. 6) which creates the heavens, and has its parallel in Enuma Elish, it contains a separate stage of the 'gathering' of waters (v. 9) which reveals dry land. This is a point of dissimilar ity with Enuma Elish. W. G. Lambert connects this latter tradition to the myth of the Sumero-Babylonian god Ninurta who holds back the 'mighty waters'.16 Perhaps we need look no further than Psalm 10q:7ff for a parallel. The provenance of that psalm must concern us later in this discussion. Certainly the manage ment of the waters in the Priestly creation account does not simply replicate that of Enuma Elish. Exodus 14:16, 21; Isaiah 63:12. 16 Lambert, op. cit., p. 296.</page><page sequence="8">448 JAMES E. ATWELL Once again, the resemblance with Enuma Elish identified under points [4] and [5] proves on investigation to be more about a shared ancient Near Eastern context than any real identity. There is a significant divergence in detail as regards the manage ment of the waters which W. G. Lambert connects to Meso potamian tradition more generally, although local Canaanite parallels can be adduced. The parallel with Psalm 104 will have to be considered later. The creation of the luminaries [6] is not specific to Enuma Elish, indeed again we can compare Psalm 104:19. However Babylonian influence does appear evident in the commission they are given to 'rule the day' and 'rule the night'. This does seem to reflect a pre vious stage in the tradition history when it was conceived that the heavenly bodies controlled the fates which in turn govern human existence. Heidel remarks in particular about the coincidence of the order in Genesis and Enuma Elish in that neither places the heavenly bodies 'immediately after the formation of the sky'.17 Certainly we shall have cause to remark on the odd placing of the creation of the luminaries in Genesis 1, but there seem to be good reasons of internal structure in the priestly narrative for their occurrence at the particular point at which they are narrated. The explanation does not lie in an external influence whether from Enuma Enuma Elish or elsewhere. The interest of [6] therefore is that we can detect an influence from Babylonian ideas as a whole, but not necessarily Enuma Elish specifically. The episode of the creation of human beings [7] is hardly evidence for any close parallel. This act is likely to come last in any creation account. The only similarities between Enuma Elish and Genesis would be that the one sees human beings created from the blood of a guilty god, and the other in the divine image. But the similarities are not very close. Moreover, the pur poses for which they are created are quite different: in the one account for slavery and in the other to exercise dominion. The two accounts do not appear to come from the same stable. For the final correspondence [8], namely rest, we turn again to W. G. Lambert. He declares: 'Here Mesopotamia does not fail us'.18 He points out that the rest of the gods after the creation of humanity is a consistent theme of ancient Mesopotamian myth, of which the Enuma Elish is one witness. Our conclusion is evident. The correspondences in order between the priestly creation narrative and Enuma Elish, as 17 A. Heidel, op. cit., p. 130. 18 W. G. Lambert, op. cit., p. 297.</page><page sequence="9">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 449 defined by Heidel, are not striking. There are some potential resonances of Babylonian ideas as a whole, most convincingly in the reference to the luminaries. The correspondence in order is as follows: the starting point is the watery primeval deep, heaven and earth are established consequent upon an act of divi sion, further acts of creation include the luminaries and human kind, divine rest is announced. That order of events does no more than witness to a general ancient Near Eastern background to both accounts. 2.2. A comparison of the Priestly Creation Narrative with the Cosmology Cosmology of Ancient Egypt We may now turn to ancient Egyptian cosmology. It is neces sary to enquire whether the specific comparison of the priestly creation account with Egyptian sources yields any interesting resemblances or fruitful insights. In order to do this the initial task must be to establish the broad outline of Egyptian creation traditions. These may then be held up for more detailed com parison with the oldest elements of the priestly creation text as identified by Schmidt. In ancient Egypt, throughout the historical period, there were three main centres where particular claims about the creation, or the 'First Time' as the Egyptians preferred to call it, were made. These were Heliopolis, Memphis and Hermopolis. Funda mental to all three were certain basic assumptions about the watery abyss, known as the 'Nun', and the 'Primeval hill'. The analogy of the watery deep was provided by the Nile; its annual inundation flooded the Nile valley which seemed to be overtaken again by watery formlessness. As the waters subsided the hillocks began to appear, their slimy mud glistening in the sunshine, rich with fertile potential. The most influential creation tradition was that devised by the theologians of the sun-god Re at Heliopolis. They identified Re with the local god Atum. Atum was 'the great he-she';19 the source of creation, he took his stand on the primeval hillock. He was identified with the majestic sun-god Re who rose every morning over an ordered world as a sort of re-enactment of the First Time. The Egyptian mind from the establishment of the Heliopolitan religion onwards never failed to be fascinated by the way the rising sun coaxed the order of the natural world into life. The petals of the lotus flower opened, the birds flew, the fish Coffin Texts 136.</page><page sequence="10">450 JAMES E. ATWELL darted in the river, humans went to their work and darkness was driven out. Memphis was the ancient capital of a united upper and lower Egypt. Its local god was named Ptah; throughout Egyptian history he remained one of the few candidates for the office of high god. Originally a chthonic deity, in one of his aspects he is actually equated with the primeval hill. Numerous inscriptions in the Theban temples of the Greek period record him as a craftsman or smith who works in metal. The Shebaka Stone famously records unequivocally the claim for Ptah of creation by the word. At Hermopolis the qualities of the primeval ocean seem to have been personified in terms of four pairs of gods—the Ogdoad or the Eight. The antiquity of this tradition is witnessed by the ancient name of the place which was 'Eight Town' (Shmun in Coptic) given in heiroglyphics as _ ©. These primeval deities were male and female forms of four different features of the watery abyss.These primeval deities were imagined to have forms that were appropriate to creatures of mud and slime; the males were credited with frogs' heads and the females with heads like serpents. Their achievement came to be understood as the creation of light, from which the known world could emerge. These three traditions, although distinct, did not develop with out mutual interaction as their shared characteristics indicate. Certainly by the time of the New Kingdom when it was fashion able to equate the major deities, Amun, Re and Ptah, in a sort of trinity,20 the great creation traditions were harmonized also. Inevitably there remained conspicuous seams and incongruities. Let us return again to the starting point of our investigation in the text as identified by Schmidt. His omission of the very first verse of Genesis 1 from the primary material has a signific ant interpretative effect. It leaves verse 2 unqualified, and con sequently presents it as in toto a description of the pre-creation condition. Only subsequent to verse 2 does the initiative of crea tion commence. If this is indeed the true nature of verse 2 in the full biblical text it is a very important point to establish if one is to understand and interpret the verse and its significance correctly. Such an interpretation would make it impossible to understand the final description of the primeval state 'and the spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters' as in some way adversative 20 The Hymn of a Thousand Strophes, IV, 21 and 22, Pap.

Cassuto argues: 'Although the earth was without form or life, and all was steeped in darkness, yet above the unformed matter hovered the !TH (rüah) of God, the source of light and life'.21 It seems impossible to establish the relationship of Genesis 1:1 with the following verse on grounds of syntax alone. For instance E. A. Speiser states: 'The first word of Genesis, and hence the first word in the Hebrew Bible is vocalized as b're'sit. Grammatically, this is evidently in the construct state'.22 But W. Eichrodt reaches the opposite conclusion: 'If we understand bere'sit in Genesis 1:1 as absolute, this is not an arbitrary judgement'.23 Von Rad makes his decision that v. 1 is a main clause on theological grounds.24 P. Humbert assumes the construct state, but still leaves the description of the pre-creation condition in toto as primary: 'Le seul traduction correcte est done: "Lorsque Dieu commenca de creer l'univers, le monde etait alors en etat chaotique" '.25 The valid point is made by C. Westermann that comparison with Enuma Elish and other creation narratives clearly identifies a traditional pattern that commences 'When there was not yet ...' and describes in negative terms the situation before the creation.26 On grounds of comparison with ancient material he therefore separates off Genesis 1:1 as a sort of prelude. This argu ment seems decisive. Genesis 1:2 is correctly understood as in toto a description of the pre-creation condition. Any real parallel will need to throw some light on how the spirit of God can be included within that category. Genesis 1, Enuma Elish and Egyptian tradition have this in common. They describe the origin of the world as watery, and the pre-creation state in negative terms. It is helpful to hold up for comparison from ancient Egypt the creation tradition from Hermopolis. At Hermopolis, we have noted, the qualities of the 21 U. Cassuto, A Commentary on the Book of Genesis, Part I, ET (Jerusalem 1961), p. 24. [Hebrew (1944)]. 22 E. A. Speiser, Genesis, p. 12. 23 W.

ATWELL primeval deep were personified by four pairs known as 'the Eight'. Its watery state was expressed in the pair known as Nun and his partner Naunet.27 The deep was further described in negative terms through the divine partners Huh and Hauhet who represent the 'boundlessness' of the great deep. תהו ובהו ('without form and void') in Genesis 1:2 is part of that general witness; this interpretation has been challenged by D. T. Tsumura.28 He denies that these words should be under stood as a sort of technical description of the chaotic state. He refers them simply to the earth (ארץ v. 2) which is as yet infertile and uninhabited. In his linguistic analysis he underestimates the significance of the context of Genesis 1:2. He does not allow that the 'not yet' pre-creation condition of earth defies description and in some sense redefines any vocabulary brought to it. It is true that תהו occurs on its own a number of times in the Hebrew Scriptures and describes the desert waste. However the addition of ובהו forms a sort of hendiadys,29 which is perhaps a specific description for ideas associated with the primeval deep (cf. Jeremiah 4:23). It is identified by both Gunkel and Cassuto as possibly an ancient poetic expression describing the primeval deep. Its concept is basically of formlessness. Genesis 1:2 further identifies darkness as of the essence of the pre-creation condition. This holds true throughout the ancient Near East. A. Heidel argues: 'In Enuma Elish this conception is not expressly stated, but we can deduce it from the fact that Ti'ämat, according to Berossus ... was shrouded in darkness'.30 27 For knowledge of the tradition of Hermopolis with its four pairs of primeval deities we are indebted to the priestly theologians of the Greek and Roman period who left inscriptions on the temple walls at Dendera, Edfu, Philae and particularly Thebes. The most telling piece of evidence for the antiquity of the tradition is the name of Hermopolis itself, in Coptic Shmun (Eight Town). From the time of the Old Kingdom when the deity Thoth is referred to as lord of his town, it is of 'the (town of) Eight'. The Eight are twice invoked in Coffin Text Spell 76 surviving from the Middle Kingdom. 28 D. T. Tsumura, The Earth and the Waters in Genesis 1 and 2, JSOT Supplement 83 (Sheffield, 1989). He takes the mention of 'earth' in Genesis 1:2 as definitive for the significance of the creation account (p. 162). The desolate and empty earth (1:2) becomes a place of vegetation (1:11) and habitation (animals 1:24, and humans 1:26). However, rather than earth as described in v. 2, it is the firmament (v. 6) and the earth (v. 9) which as the totality of heaven and earth (cf. 1:1) is definitive for the whole account. The vision of the priestly creation account is more than utilitarian, and is not comprehended in simply creating an environment around human beings. 29 E. A. Speiser, Genesis, p. 5. 30 A. Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis, p 101.</page><page sequence="13">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 453 John Day points out that this was true of Canaanite concepts as well. He states: That the connection between Leviathan and darkness goes back to Canaanite mythology may be surmised from the Ugaritic texts, where in CTA6.v1.44IT. (=KTU 1.6.VI.45 ff.) we read that Kothar-and-Hasis, who it is hoped will defeat the dragon Leviathan), was also the friend of the sun-goddess Shapash, who is apparently threatened by the dragon.31 However, it is in Egypt that we find explicit witnesses to darkness as a feature of the primeval deep. In the tradition of Hermopolis the third of the four divine pairs that personify the chaotic state, known as Kuk and Kauket, represent precisely thick darkness. The real problem of interpretation that we face in trying to understand Genesis 1:2 lies in the description of the final element of the verse. How can the 'spirit of God' be understood as a description of the original, unformed primeval state? A way out of this dilemma could be to translate רוח אלהים as 'wind of God',32 but B. S. Childs33 denies this possibility on the grounds that such a meaning occurs nowhere else in the Hebrew Scrip tures. Against this may be argued that Genesis 1:2 is a special case, and so perhaps parallels do not hold. John Day appeals to the presumed Canaanite background to Genesis 1. He argues that we meet here in muted form the wind with which Ba'al equipped himself for the battle with the sea monster, and con sequently already have an intrusion of the power of creation. He draws a parallel with the turning point in the P flood narrative where the wind of God blows over the earth and the waters sub side (Genesis 8:1). But decisive for our investigation must be that all indications seem to make it unacceptable to break off this phrase from the total description of 'When there was not yet', and give it an adversative sense. Any acceptable interpretation must be able to explain it in the context of a series of representa tions of the primeval abyss. Another suggestion is that of E. A. Speiser who interprets the whole phrase as an 'awesome wind', taking אלהים in a superlative sense.34 This interpretation is adopted in some modern transla tions including the NEB: 'and a mighty wind swept over the 31 J.

He notes in particular the significance of the four winds, created by Anu, in enabling Marduk to triumph in the Enuma Elish. He also draws attention to the use of ר1ח in J's primeval history (Gen. 3:8). 33 B. S. Childs, Myth and Reality in the Old Testament, Studies in Biblical Theology, 27 (London, i960), p. 35. 34 E. A.

But that solution strains the text and leaves אלהים unrelated to its other occurrences in the adjoining verses. H. Gunkel looked to the verb רחף, to which he gave the sense of 'brood', for a solu tion. He traced the original significance to a Phoenician myth of the cosmic egg.35 Neither suggestion seems to resolve our dilemma. We still have to look elsewhere. We have noted how three of the pairs from the creation tradi tion of Hermopolis correspond with the description in Genesis 1:2. 1:2. Can the fourth pair throw any light on our present enigma? Here K. Sethe has boldly maintained that the witness from the Greek period to Amun and Amaunet as the fourth pair of the Eight is to be regarded as a late witness to ancient tradition. He seizes on the creative combination of Amun, the 'hidden one', as primeval deity and Amun the mysterious high god of the New Kingdom represented in the unseen but dynamic power of the wind. According to Sethe's picture, therefore, Amun and his partner represent the dynamic quality of the primeval abyss. Amun is that quality which overcomes the torpor, languidness and stagnation of the primeval waters: At first calm and motionless, hovering over the sluggish primeval ocean Nun, invisible as a nullity, it (the air) could at a given moment be set in motion, apparently of itself, could churn up the Nun to its depths, so so that the mud lying there could condense into solid land and emerge from the flood waters, first as a 'high hillock' or as an 'Isle of Flames' near Hermopolis.36 If this case put by K. Sethe can be maintained, then, at a stroke, the final element in Genesis 1:2 makes complete sense as a description of the pre-creation condition. Here only in the ancient Near East do we find a precedent that might enable us to make sense of the dynamic spirit of God as actually a feature of the primeval abyss. There is, however, a problem in connection with the witness to the fourth pair of the Ogdoad of Hermopolis. Although the Pyramid Texts do present an early witness to Amun and Amaunet as primeval deities, there is no early explicit witness to them as members of the Ogdoad. Further, that they may have been inserted 35 This solution of Gunkel seems to be adopted by J. Skinner, Genesis, p. 18. However it is generally agreed now that the word involves movement (cf. Deut. 32:11, 'hover' or 'flutter'). The Ugaritic cognate 'describes a form of motion as opposed to a state of suspension or rest', E. A. Speiser, Genesis, p. 5. 36 K.

Morenz, Egyptian Religion, p. 176.</page><page sequence="15">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 455 into the Eight during the long development of the Hermopolitan tradition seems likely. They represent one variant pair amongst other candidates for completing the cosmology;37 a pair that has come to predominate in the late witness of the temple texts of the Greek period. However, it is known that Amun in his form as Amun-Re was associated with Hermopolis from the 18th Dynasty.38 The evidence leads us to conclude that any judgement about the position of Amun and Amaunet within the Hermopoli tan system in the Old Kingdom or the Middle Kingdom cannot be made with certainty. The case remains open. But it does seem a reasonable assumption that by the time of the New Kingdom the creative connections which Sethe identifies are likely to have been made at Hermopolis. That is, the combination of Amun as primeval deity, representing hiddenness in the sense of nullity or negligibility, with the Theban characteristics of hiddenness, as the invisible power of the wind, would have taken place. In that case we may say that the cosmology of Hermopolis enabled Amun to be identified not only as the dynamic principle of exist ence, as breath or wind, but also the dynamic quality of the prim eval abyss. In all likelihood it is Amun who is the source of the imagery of רוח אלהים in Genesis 1:2.39 We may note a further significant parallel between the cosmo logy of Hermopolis and that of Genesis 1 which leads us on to the 37 See H. Altenmuller, 'Achtheit' in W. Helck and E. Otto (eds.), Lexikon der Ägyptologie Ägyptologie I (Weisbaden, 1975), column 56. The alternative candidates for the fourth pair of the Hermopolitan cosmology throw further light on the speculation about the primeval abyss. The couples in this fourth personification of the primeval deep, like a quantum zero, hover between existence and non-existence. Tenemu and his consort represent a quality of disappearance. Niau expresses a negative quality in the sense of void or empty. Gereh describes lack or deficiency. In as much as Amun and his consort Amaunet were a personification of this fourth pair of the Ogdoad the quality of 'hiddenness' should also be understood in a negative sense such as invisibility, perhaps almost negligibility. 38 G. Roeder, 'Zwei Hieroglyphische Inschriften Aus Hermopolis', ASAE 52 (1954), PP• 315-18. This conclusion is shared by R. Kilian, 'Genesis 1:2 und die Urgötter von Hermopolis', VT 16 (1966), pp. 420-38. Gustav Jequier, 'Les Quatre Cynocephales', in Samuel A. B. Mercer (ed.), Egyptian Religion, vol. 2, no. 3 (New York, 1934) pp. 78-86, denies that Sethe has proved Amun to have been originally numbered among the Eight of Hermopolis. However he is convinced by the correspondence of Genesis 1:2 with the four personifications of the primeval deep at Hermopolis and regards as proven the dependence of Genesis 1:2 on the theology of Hermopolis. Creation takes place, according to Jequier's inter pretation, from the inert primordial material under the influence of 'une force etrangere' (to be distiguished from the four pairs of primeval deities) who is the god Thoth. According to this interpretation, his is the hidden presence behind the opening of the Genesis creation narrative.</page><page sequence="16">456 JAMES E. AT WE L L next stage in Schmidt's oldest material (v. 4). The achievement of the Eight certainly came to be understood as the creation of light. They were 'the fathers and mothers who created light'.40 It is reflected in the name of the primeval hill at Hermopolis, 'Isle of Flames'. The first act of creation was the emergence of light from the primeval gloom. It is a further confirmatory indicator of the relevance of the tradition of Hermopolis in understanding the priestly creation narrative. The separating of the waters (v. 7) was a feature which W. G. Lambert found to unite Genesis and Enuma Elish. In as much as it points to the original creation as an act of division or separation, then this general notion of the ancient Near East occurs in Egypt too. Geb and Nut, the earth god and the heaven goddess, are separated by their father Shu. The separation of waters is involved in this imagery of the raising up of the sky. Shu represents the atmosphere between heaven and earth which exists, according to one popular universal concept, as a sort of bubble in the universal primeval ocean. The separation of earth and heaven drives back the waters and creates the atmospheric space. When the primeval waters are referred to as a pair, Nun and Naunet, this identifies the separated waters of the deep above and below the ordered world. In this context J. P. Allen draws specific attention to the correspondence between the priestly cosmology and that of ancient Egypt in the key signific ance of the firmament or vault in both schemes. He refers to the linguistic differentiation between the waters above and below the created world: Both terms for the universe of waters that exist outside this world have in common the hieroglyph representing the vault of the sky. This vault is what keeps the waters from the world. The Pyramid Texts and the Coffin Texts speak of 'keeping the sky clear of the earth and the waters'. The same image appears in the Hebrew account of creation (Gen. i :6-7).41 Schmidt's next element of primary tradition continues with v. 9. He adopts as the basis of his rendering the LXX in which the waters themselves take the initiative and 'gather themselves into one meeting place'. That nuance would well express the fertility of the Egyptian Nun which actually gives birth to the primeval hill. The picture is in complete accord with Egyptian concepts where the emergence of the first piece of dry land as the waters 40 Theb T. 95c [Theban temple texts of the Greek and Roman period; see K.

It may be that one should understand v. 16, the creation of the luminaries, as the next step in the original development of cosmic order. In that case there would need to be some good reason in priestly logic for the present form of the narrative which we shall have to consider later. It makes more sense for the sun to precede nature. In Enuma Elish the creation of the heavenly bodies follows directly from the establishment of heaven and earth. In ancient Egypt the sun precedes everything else at the first dawn. How ever, just as there is a certain tension in the Genesis 1 narrative between the creation of light initially and the heavenly bodies only subsequently, so in ancient Egypt there is a tension between Re identified with Atum the origin of all order, and Re born daily of Nut, the sky goddess, as a subsequent if principal part of that order. The sun and moon are referred to in Genesis 1:16 as 'greater' and 'lesser' lights. Many commentators have noted that these circumlocutions seem like a priestly device to avoid the mention of names that had associations with deities of considerable influ ence in the Mesopotamian world, and who were actually con ceived of as exercising rule and dispensing the fates. The divinity of the sun in ancient Egypt, perhaps still reflected in Psalm 104,43 where in v. 19 it is the subject of the verb 'to know' (ידע), would hardly have accorded with priestly theology either. This latter fact may have made this area of the tradition vulner able, and open to alternative influences. In that case the Mesopo tamian influence was most likely to have acted upon the Hebrew phase of the tradition. This section certainly reminds us that developments of thought in the ancient Near East are complex and influences from different major civilizations often inter relate as cosmological patterns develop. In particular Canaan and Syria were well placed for absorbing influences from both Mesopotamia and the Nile valley. Genesis 1:12, 21, 25 draws on a tradition that observes, articu lates, classifies and values the mysterious order of the natural world. The world of living things is not created one by one, or two 42 In ancient Egypt, too, the earth had a power of its own; it could 'sprout forth'. The earth god Geb was often painted green to signify this. Osiris, too, represented the fertility of the good earth as could Ptah. 43 For the relevance of Psalm 104 for the interpretation of the priestly creation account see below.</page><page sequence="18">458 JAMES E. AT WE L L by two as they leave the ark, but rather in whole colonies as they swarm (v. 21 שרץ). There is a scientific interest in classification. A distinction is drawn between herbs and fruit trees: the one dis persing seed, the other with the seed in it. Creatures of water, land and air are differentiated. Those of land are placed in three sub groups. These are cattle, creepers, and beasts; that is, domestic animals, reptiles, and wild animals. From the sun's rise on the first morning of creation, according to the Heliopolitan tradition of ancient Egypt, there issued forth the great complex order of nature, both vegetable and animal. Egypt rejoiced in a vision of the rich variety of species, of activities appropriate to day and night, of animals adapted to particular environments of land, sea, or air, and the mysterious powers of procreation hidden in seed or egg or womb. The temple walls of the Old Kingdom, the Onomastica of the Middle Kingdom and the hymns of the New Kingdom present a united witness to this vision of order and relationship in the natural world expressed in the significant concept Ma'at. Ma'atMa'at stood for order in every area of existence. A goddess, she was regarded as the daughter of Re; her symbol was a feather. Nun and Ma'at in a sense define each other as opposites. Nun represents watery formlessness, and Ma'at the gleaming order of creation on the first morning as dawn breaks. Order was thought to embrace society as well as nature and the physical world; politics and botany were related sciences. Judges were priests of Ma'at and wore her emblem. When order referred to that moral order of the world that rewards virtuous behaviour, then Ma'at came close to signifying harmony or even providence. In the context of nature's order Ma'at approximates to the modern concept of the ecological balance of nature. It is this lat ter interpretation which is relevant in any comparison with the way nature is observed and categorized in the priestly creation narrative. In the sun temple of Nyuserre at Abu Sir the sun-god is hailed as 'Lord of Ma'at'. The significance of that is revealed in the Chamber of the Seasons in which the seasons of 'inundation' and 'deficiency'(i.e. harvest) are represented by figures in human form, respectively female and male. Behind these figures the mural is divided horizontally by watercourses and here the activities of each season are reproduced. The impression is of a great catalogue identifying and recording the orderly and inter related arrangement of natural phenomena; that is, things human, animal, and vegetable within their common environment.

A glimpse is given by this excerpt from the description of von Bissing: Sous une etendue d'eau on voit un grand ärbre auquel un homme a suspendu une gazelle qu'il est en train de decouper pour le repas des personnes qui sont assises derriere lui, l'une de ces personnes porte ä ses levres une large coupe.

XVIII est plus complexe: ä droite, sur trois registres, trois pelicans sont en train de couver: il semble y avoir dans chaque nid trois oeufs qui The insistence that the divine civil service organized the natural world into a proper sequence and hierarchy on the model of the pharaoh's kingdom is typical of Egyptian thinking throughout its long history. This sense of order permeating all existence and manifest quite marvellously in the natural world enabled the Egyptians to observe and articulate nature's harmoniousness and interrelatedness. All things exist in a sort of communion which is broken only at great risk. It is clearly that selfsame inspiration that encounters us in Genesis 1: 12, 21, 25.46 The priestly comment which is not, one must assume, part of the original tradition, continually refers to the world in God's judgement as 'good' (טוב). Here 'good' has certainly developed beyond the primitive and experimental meaning of 'successful' as opposed to 'unsuccessful' which still lurks behind Genesis 2:18. However, there is still a certain innocent joy behind the 44 F. W.

Von Rad's understanding of the significance of this word accords well with the basic tradition and identifies its true nature: The word contains less an aesthetic judgement than the designation of purpose and correspondence. (It corresponds, therefore, though with much more restraint to the content of Ps. 104:31; Ps. 104 tells not so much of the beauty as of the marvellous purpose and order of creation.)47 This correspondence between the original material and priestly judgement should remind us that in the choice of their raw mater ial these circles had already acquired a vision able to be adapted to their own. The balance, symmetry and detail of the Egyptian concept of the created order, which was understood as seamless with the civil order of the kingdom under the pharaoh, was sympathetic to the priestly desire to separate and classify. We must note that the comparison made by von Rad with Psalm 104 is not a casual one. There are a number of specific comparisons that have been drawn between Genesis 1 and Psalm 104. Light is a primary feature of the Almighty (v. 2a). The world comes about through the securing of the heavenly waters and the waters under the earth. The heavenly firmament of Genesis 1:7 has its equivalence in a heavenly tent (v. 2b). The foundations of the earth are laid in the waters (v. 5), and the earth appears when the waters recede. In the case of Psalm 104 they are driven back (vv. 6-8). Creation is firmly achieved without any lurking threat to the creator (v. 9). Here we leave the specific order that we find in Genesis 1, but all of its subsequent features may be identified in the psalm. There are the heavenly bodies marking the seasons (v. 19). There is the world of vegetation including trees (v. 16), and the aquatic world (v. 25). Fowls of the air find a mention in v. 12. Various provision is made for food, including different cat egories for cattle and people (v. 14). Human labour and the alloca tion of wine and bread for human welfare are also reflected upon. Specific verbal similarities between Genesis 1 and Psalm 104 are also recognizable. J. Day notes: With regard to verbal similarities, it may be noted that a considerable amount of common vocabulary is shared between Gen. 1 and Ps. 104. Particularly striking are the expression lemö'adtm, found in the Old Testament only in Ps. 104:19 and Gen. 1:14 (both in connection with Von Rad, Genesis, p. 52. For additional emphasis on the divine pronounce ment see W. F. Albright, 'The Refrain "And God saw Ki Tob" in Genesis', Melanges Melanges Bibliques Rediges en l'honneur de Andre Robert, Travaux de 1'Institut Catholique de Paris 4 (1955), pp. 22-6. He translated the phrase in question: 'And God saw how good it was'.</page><page sequence="21">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 461 the luminaries), and the form hayeto, found in Ps. 104:11, 20 and Gen. 1:24, and apart from the latter passage attested only in poetry in the Old Testament.48 Psalm 104, which could equally appropriately be classified within the biblical Wisdom corpus, provides us with a tool for reflection on Genesis 1:1-2:4. Indeed, as we discuss below, P. Humbert argues that it is a sort of hymnic response to that text. J. Day49 argues in the reverse direction, that Genesis 1 is based on Psalm 104. He rests his case on the supposedly more primitive nature of Psalm 104, and in particular the fact that it still explicitly carries allusion to the divine conflict with chaos which has vanished from Genesis 1. He does allow, but does not favour the possibility, that it is conceivable that both Genesis 1 and Psalm 104 could be dependent upon a single common tradition. We have argued for an Egyptian background to Genesis 1, and such a background for Psalm 104 is not in dispute. The psalm is similar in form to the Egyptian hymns of the New Kingdom. In particular it bears a distinct resemblance to Akenhaten's Hymn Hymn to to Aten. The muted Canaanite-inspired divine conflict with the waters we would see as no more than a cosmetic enhancement of Psalm 104 to bring it into line with prevailing local cultic con ventions of the way creation is recounted. The Wisdom tradition was international, but in its local manifestations used the name for God from local tradition and adapted to local colour as regards the way that deity created. What remained a constant feature was that creation for the Wisdom tradition, in contrast to cultic celebration, was always a completed event.50 We would therefore see Psalm 104 and Genesis 1 as witnesses to a single common Egyptian-inspired tradition, but the absence of conflict in Genesis 1 actually makes it the purer witness. The attested closeness of Psalm 104 both to the Wisdom tradition and in particular to the Egyptian hymns of the New Kingdom can be used as a sort of commentary on the Genesis creation narrative. The psalm helps us to understand the inspiration and motivation behind the Genesis narrative. 48 J. Day, God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea, p. 51. 49 J. Day, God's Conflict with the Dragon and the Sea, pp. 51 ff., and Psalms (Sheffield, 1990), pp. 41 f. More generally on Psalm 104, Day summarises sue cinctly: *Psalm 104 is remarkable not only for the length of its concentration on the subject of creation and its striking parallels with the Egyptian hymn to Aton by Pharaoh Akhenaten, but also for the way that the order in [which] topics are treated agrees with the order of creation in Genesis 1\ Psalms, p. 41. 50 See Hans-Jürgen Hermisson, 'Observations on the Creation Theology in Wisdom', in B. W. Anderson (ed.), Creation in the Old Testament, pp. 118-34.</page><page sequence="22">462 JAMES E. ATWELL We may end our look at Psalm 104 by noting that it also includes the progression of night and day (vv. 19-23), which is at least a point of contact with the P scheme. As creation was achieved in a day in Egypt, this time period was most important, and conceived to be, in some sense, repeated each morning. In fact v. 19 begins with the evening. If the sun rises on a gleaming order of creation then the actual regenerative process while the sun bathes in the Nun is from dusk until dawn. This may be reflected in P's cycle 'and evening and morning were the nth day'.51 Next in the primary material we come to the creation of human beings (vv. 26-7). Schmidt sees this as a unit with a different prehistory.52 The opening: 'Let us make man ...' may well reflect this, and in the original circumstance announce the decision of the divine council to make human beings. It is reminiscent of the divine reflection included by J in his narrative: 'Behold, the man is become as one of us, to know good and evil' (Gen. 3:22a). Both retain evidence of a similar archaic stage in their history of transmission. However P is perhaps reflecting the plurality of the Ennead of ancient Egypt, rather than the creating deities of ancient Mesopotamia. P may have retained the plural form as a 'deliberative' or perhaps because it has a less anthropomorphic ring. Two specific things are said of human beings. Firstly that they are in the 'image' (צלם) and 'likeness' (דמות) of God, and sec ondly that they are given dominion.53 Of the first ascription like ness is the weaker concept; it occurs in Ezekiel's vision when he sees 'the likeness of four living creatures' (Ezekiel 1:5). It indicates analogy. Image has a greater sense of identity. It can mean a copy (1 Samuel 6:5) or occasionally an idol (Numbers 33:52 and 2 Kings 11:18) 11:18) or even a painting (Ezekiel 23:14). As regards dominion, this is quite strongly expressed. Humanity is to 'subdue' the earth. This is taken from the language of the treading of the wine press (Joel 4:13), and also the battlefield (Numbers 32:22, 29; Joshua 18:1). This latter imagery even leads Brueggemann34 to extend the concept of 'human dominion' to the Israelite domin ion of Palestine. If that is the case then P's more domestic and nationalistic concerns are concealed within the creation narrative. 51 For a discussion on the commencement of a day see H. R. Stores, 'Does the Day Begin in the Evening or the Morning?', VT 16 (1966), pp. 460-75. 52 W. H. Schmidt, Die Schöpfungsgeschichte der Priester schrift, p. 128. 53 Psalm 8 likewise witnesses to an identical tradition. Humanity is made (v. 5) a 'little lower than אלהים■ and given dominion over the rest of creation. 'Thou hast put all things under his feet' (v. 6) is a strong concept also. 54 W. Brueggemann, The Vitality of Old Testament Traditions (Atlanta, 19822), p. 109.</page><page sequence="23">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 463 The dominion theme is repeated with more vehemence in Genesis 9:2, with the associated 'fear' and 'dread' the animal world will have of humanity in the new age of violence. We may note in that context that human beings after the flood have not lost the divine image. It is the ground for forbidding human bloodshed (Genesis 9:6). Much ink has been spent on the nature of the divine image in human beings, and whether the emphasis is on a physical or spiri tual resemblance. The linking of the divine image and dominion seems to point us in the direction of ancient Near Eastern concepts of kingship. The person of the king often provided in the 'human being writ large' the means whereby the Wisdom tradition could bring human behaviour and human destiny under close scrutiny. H. Wildberger draws attention to the form salmu (image) occurring in Babylonian civilization and its application to the king.53 However he notes that Egypt is richer in such texts.56 Indeed the king in Mesopotamia was never considered divine in the way he was in ancient Egypt. The king, like his sub jects, groped his way through life seeking guidance and direction from augury and sacrificial entrails for an understanding of the divine will. In ancient Canaan, too, the king was more likely to be accorded the wisdom of the 'primal man' than of a god in the full sense. We may note also that the Mesopotamian assess ment of human destiny was hardly compatible with any sense of an indwelling divine image. Egypt, however, is a different matter. There we discover that the pharaoh was acclaimed as divine: 'Thou art the living likeness of thy father Atum of Heliopolis for authoritative utterance (hu) is in thy mouth, understanding (sia') is in thy heart, thy speech is the shrine of truth (Ma'at)'.57 Such descriptions were regularly used of the god-king, who like his divine father at the first time, ruled with the companions of god at creation—Hu Sia' and Ma'atMa'at—always beside his throne. When the king appeared on his throne he was spoken of as the divine sun rising from the east. When the pharaoh died, like the evening sun, he descended to the horizon. This image was no hyperbole, but a literal under standing of the god-king. H. Wildberger, *Das Abbild Gottes, Gen. 1:26-30', TZ 21 (1965), pp. 245-59. 56 H. Wildberger, TZ 21 (1965), pp. 481-501. 57 Kuban Stela II, 17-18. (Translation: H. Frankfort, Kingship and the Gods, p. 149). W. H. Schmidt, Die Schöpfungsgeschichte der Priesterschrift, pp. 137 ff. refers the origin of the idea of the divine image to Egyptian court style when referring to the pharaoh, often linked to the concept of creation, and particularly prevalent in the New Kingdom period.</page><page sequence="24">464 JAMES E. ATWELL It is possible to trace a democratization of the funeral rites of the pharaoh, which extended the identification of the king with Osiris to his nobles during the First Intermediate Period. It would not therefore be surprising to find a democratization in some circles of other royal qualities including the divine image. Indeed we find in the Instructions for King Merikare evidence that this connection had been made for human beings in general: 'They are his images, who came forth from his body'.58 This was never the official Egyptian 'doctrine of humanity', but sometimes the humanistic tradition of the Instructions might dream of humanity's royal destiny. The centrality of the Instructions within the Wisdom tradition of Egypt gave to humans and their behaviour an increasingly central emphasis. Indeed the implica tion of the Wisdom-influenced narrative of Genesis 3 that the misdemeanour of human beings can have a calamitous effect on the whole creation itself approaches hubris. Human beings are there given a position of enormous and pivotal significance, not unlike the position of the pharaoh in ancient Egypt, which certainly corresponds to the royal dignity of Genesis 1:26-7. If the divine image in human beings is taken from the Egyptian pharaoh, we certainly have a way into its meaning. No doubt the monarch would have been accorded physical beauty, as was the case for the royal house even in Israel.59 But wisdom would have been the primary quality; that for which Solomon prayed in such an exemplary way.6 It would have embraced know ledge, discrimination and the potential for a righteous life. The divine image in Genesis 1 is not far from the enticement pre sented to Adam when Eve stretched out her hand for the fruit: '... and you will be as God ( אלהים), knowing good and evil' (Genesis 3:5). Once again we detect the guiding hand of wisdom in presenting and reflecting upon the nature of human beings as they are before God. The final element in Schmidt's basic material is the rest of God (Genesis 2:2). This also finds a resonance in ancient Egypt. There it is not a release from toil for the gods brought about by the crea tion of human beings as it is in Mesopotamia. Rather it is satisfac tion at the conclusion of a job well done. It was said of Ptah of Memphis: 'So Ptah rested after he had made all things and all the 58 Instructions for King Merikare, verse 132. See W.

The rest of God in the Egyptian context relates well to the priestly insistence that the world in God's judgement was 'good' (טוב). That is, it was har monious, ordered, complete, and satisfying. It seems much more in sympathy with the priestly creation narrative as a whole to look to the Egyptian nuance for an understanding of the divine rest, than to look to the Mesopotamian notion of the rest of the gods following the burdening of human beings with their work. The rest is not so much relief from toil as satisfactory completion of the job. It bears the hallmark of what may be identified as a specifically Wisdom understanding of creation as something complete in the past rather than emergent in the present. Egypt has rewarded us richly as a source for comparison with the oldest elements of the priestly creation narrative as Schmidt has identified them. A question remains. Can Egypt help us at all significantly with the command account, the framework which has come to regulate the action account? The rest of Ptah reminds us also of the claim made for him of creation by his word. Creation by the divine word was a common concept throughout the ancient Near East. It was not a late and refined expression of the divine activity in creation, but was already a live concept in ancient Sumer. Its origin seems to penetrate deeply into the primitive belief in the power of a name and the magic associated with words. Just as an image might partake of the essence of the thing it represented, so the spoken word had the potential of the thing it signified. It is closely allied to the mentality that believed a a ritual act could actually evoke the reality that it portrayed. Doubtless this way of thinking was decisively reinforced by the experience of kingship in the ancient Near East. After all the king had only to conceive a command and utter it, and the deed was done. The effective word of the despot provided an analogy for the divine word. The Enuma Elish opens by setting the scene before the creation by talking of a time when things had not been 'named'. Indeed Marduk displays his power in what is as much a stunt as an act of creation when he proves his word can 'wreck or create'; that 61 Extract from the Shabaka Stone, see W.

ATWELL is, at his utterance images appear and disappear.62 But it is in ancient Egypt that creation by the word became part of the official dogma claimed by the priests of both Heliopolis and Memphis for their respective deities. It may be that the 'tradition history' of the Genesis 1 creation account is much more of a unity than is normally supposed. The two strands of action and command, which to earlier comment ators seemed so mutually exclusive, have existed together in Egypt since high antiquity. As early as the Pyramid Texts, Hu (utterance) and Sia' (perception), which provide the conceptual tools whereby the theologians of Heliopolis articulate creation by the word for Atum, appear as a pair. In the Coffin Texts this pair is identified with elements of a more physical presentation of the work of creation. In the New Kingdom the witness is unequivocal in claiming for Amon-Re and Ptah creation by the word, but the claims made for both have deeply rooted associations with more earthy and physical concepts of creation. For instance, the Shabaka stone (the inscription reflecting an original dated by J. P. Allen63 to the New Kingdom) witnesses to the Memphite theology. That theology represents an exceptional thrust of insight which in the period of the New Kingdom has already articulated a 'logos theology'. Yet the supposed contradictions between an action and a command account of creation cannot be more nakedly exposed than within this text. There the theology of Memphis, by this time mixing its sources, equates the 'teeth and lips' of Ptah with the 'semen and hands of Atum'. The ancient tradition which emphasized Atum's self-sufficiency in creation by using the image of masturbation sits side by side with the witness to the divine word which actually articulates the self-same theo logical principle. Both witness to the sole initiative of the creator acting entirely alone. Indeed Ptah, who formed by his word, is both a chthonic deity as Ta-tenen, and a smith. In this latter capa city he would certainly have been capable of hammering out the firmament (רקיע) of Genesis 1:6 in his workshop. When the template of ancient Egyptian creation traditions is held up against the Genesis 1 creation account there is a quite remarkable correspondence.The conclusion is stark and compel ling: ancient Egypt provided the foundation tradition which was shaped and handed on by successive priestly generations. When 62 Enuma Elish Tablet IV, lines 25-6. 63 J. P. Allen, Genesis in Egypt, pp. 43 f.</page><page sequence="27">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 467 Westermann commends W. H. Schmidt's study Die Schöpfungs geschickte geschickte der Priesterschrift he states: He has established definitively that the first chapter of Genesis had its origin in the course of a history of tradition of which the written text of P is the last stage, and which stretches back beyond and outside Israel in a long and many-branched oral pre-history.64 This study confirms that the origin of the first chapter of Genesis may be traced through a long prehistory to a source that is indeed outside Israel. However that source may not be as many-branched as Westermann supposed. Ancient Egypt proves to be the single, coherent and rich source of the priestly creation traditions. The Nile civilization provides not simply a possible context for odd verses, but again and again accounts for the detail of the Genesis i creation narrative and is the key to its common thread. The order of the pharaoh's kingdom was compatible with and resourced the vision of priestly cosmic symmetry. This research has presented a serious challenge to any attempt to isolate creation by the word in the priestly creation account from the supposedly more basic material. It is likely that the source tradition consisted not only of those elements identified by Schmidt, but also included in some embryonic way a witness to creation by the divine word. The hallmark of Wisdom has been detected on a number of occasions. It seems a fair assumption that the wealth of scribal and intellectual contact in the period of the early monarchy would have given ample occasion for this deposit of tradition, already venerable, to have travelled to the Hebrew kingdom of David and Solomon and been absorbed into sacred tradition. It seems as certain as these things can be that the New Kingdom phase of ancient Egypt's development, through the medium of the wisdom tradition, provided our priestly tradents with a single tradition of creation by word and action which they nurtured, refined and tooled into the composition which we now enjoy. II.II. THE PATTERNING OF SEVEN We turn now to our second question: How does the patterning of seven imposed upon the acts of creation relate to the tradition history of Genesis 1? C. Westermann, Genesis i-n, p. 83.</page><page sequence="28">468 JAMES E. ATWELL Something of a puzzle relating to the text of Genesis 1 is readily discernible. As it stands the narrative unfolds over a seven day period. The final day is the day of divine rest. Creation is there fore recounted in six daily episodes. This pattern seems to have been imposed secondarily on the material as there are eight crea tive acts. The eight acts have been compacted into six days result ing in two acts on both the third and sixth days. How has this come about? P. Humbert65 has argued for a cultic setting for Genesis 1:1-2:4a. He maintains that Genesis 1 is a dramatic narrative which in its construction reflects how the events of creation were celebrated over a festival of seven days' duration. This, he believes, was Israel's celebration of the New Year, and took place at the Jerusalem temple at the Feast of Tabernacles. By analogy with the reading of the Enuma Elish at the Babylonian New Year Festival which concludes with the recitation of the fifty names of Marduk, he sees Psalm 104, prefaced by the concluding verses (vv.19-22) of Psalm 103, which relate to enthronement, as the hymnic response to the creator sung at the festival. He mentions also the mystery plays of ancient Egypt similarly concluding with solar hymns. In support of this thesis, he points to the priestly nature of the tradition of Genesis 1, indications that it was intended for public recitation and liturgical use, and the unnatural organization of the creation material into seven episodes. Further he maintains that the blessings within the narrative and the provision of food for animals and human beings relates naturally to a cultic setting in which each autumn there is a renewal of fertility. The hallowing of the sabbath indicates for Humbert a cultic usage, and he compares the rites of consecration in 2 Chronicles 29:17. He sum marises his conclusion: 'Le schema des sept jours serait, en ce cas, la projection sur le mythe createur lui-meme du calendrier de cette fete automnale et primitivement agraire qui commemorait et operait le renouveau de l'annee au cours de la premiere semaine de Pan'.66 If Humbert is correct then we have a plausible explanation for the seven days of creation. A similar observation is made by L. R. Fisher when he draws a comparison between the scheme of Genesis 1 and both the building of Ba'al's temple in the Ugaritic texts in seven days and Solomon's temple in seven years (1 Kings 6:38). He concludes: 'If these temples were constructed 65 P. Humbert, 'La relation de Genese 1 et du Psaume 104 avec la liturgie du Nouvel-An israelite', RHPR 15 (193s), pp. 1-27. 66 Ibid., p. 14.</page><page sequence="29">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 469 in terms of "seven" it is really no wonder that the creation poem of Genesis 1 is inserted in a seven-day framework'.67 The problem is that there is no direct evidence, as we have for Babylon in the first millennium for Enuma Elish, for the association of the Genesis 1 narrative with the cult. We must take seriously the judgement of W. H. Schmidt when he can find no evidence that the priestly creation narrative was used as a liturgical text: '... aber die biblische Schöpfungsgeschichte bietet keine Anzei chen dafür, daß sie einmal die Legende eines Festes war und irgendwie "begangen", szenischdramatisch dargestellt wurde'.68 The fact that Genesis 1 was not itself a liturgical text, if Schmidt is correct, does not mean that it has not been stamped and fashioned by cultic considerations. A learned priestly apo logia about creation, as Genesis 1 undoubtedly is, would still reflect and give expression to the way in which creation, stability and fertility were celebrated, and perhaps in some way lived through in worship. It is unlikely that a priestly narrative account of creation would be totally divorced from the thought-forms and patterns familiar from the cult. Indeed it is highly likely that these would provide the framework for learned reflection. Indica tions that this was indeed the case are forthcoming from the priestly primeval history. The observation of L. M. Barre is relevant here: P'sP's dating the end of the flood narrative on 1.1.601 (rather than on 2.27.601) places the establishment of God's covenant with Noah on New Year's Day. This parallels P's creation account, in which the creation of the world was concluded on another day of ritual importance—the sabbath. In this way the Priestly writer connected both the creation and the re-creation of the world with Israelite liturgy.69 We can go this far with P. Humbert with some confidence. It seems most likely that the period of seven days for creation in the priestly narrative presented itself by analogy with liturgical observation. However this is not to say that the text as it now stands was ever used as a liturgical piece. The priestly creation text did not appear in its present form 'at a stroke'. It has developed through generations of handling, and so has the significance of the seven days and in particular the 67 L. R. Fisher, 'The Temple Quarter', jfSS 8 (1963), p. 40. We may note in this context the interesting, but not provable, suggestion of P. C. Craigie, 'The Comparison of Hebrew poetry: Psalm 104 in the light of Egyptian and Ugaritic Poetry', Semitics 4 (1974), pp. 10-21, that Psalm 104 was originally composed for the very feast of Tabernacles which saw Solomon's temple dedicated. 68 W. H. Schmidt, Die Schöpfungsgeschichte der Priesterschrift, p. 73. 69 L. M. Barre, 'The Riddle of the Flood Chronology', JSOT 41 (1988), p. 17.</page><page sequence="30">470 JAMES E. ATWELL seventh. The first of the days to contain two acts of creation is day three. On that day both the earth and plant life appear. On the previous day the way had been prepared for the creation of land by the dividing of the waters, which is made permanent by the fabrication of the firmament. There is an enigma connected with the second day. Why is it that the act of division has only one consequence, that is, the crea tion of the firmament? It is of the essence of ancient Near Eastern creation accounts that a single act of division results in a double consequence. Heaven and earth are created at a single stroke. For instance, in ancient Sumer An (male heaven) and Ki (female earth) are separated, according to the story of Enlil and the Pick axe,axe, by the god Enlil. We have already noted how in ancient Egypt Geb (the earth god) and Nut (the sky goddess) are separ ated by their father Shu (the air). One valid way of describing the pre-creation state in ancient Egypt is: 'before two things had developed in this world'.70 W. G. Lambert has argued that the two episodes recounted on two different days that bring into existence heaven and earth should be regarded as separate and distinct traditions assembled by the priestly tradition. 1 However, there are indications within the priestly narrative itself that it is built around the dual concept of the creation of heaven and earth. Priestly circles would cer tainly have been familiar with 'the heavens and the earth' har nessed as a united concept in blessing formulae. The phrase forms a common word-pair which is taken up in the summary statement which opens the creation account (1:1). Heaven and earth stand over the whole priestly creation account as a single archetype. Together they provide the basis from which the detail of the subsequent acts can be fitted together. Once those two areas are established the remaining narrative is totally taken up with how one or other of them is filled. A further observation confirms the impression given by the narrative. The refrain 'And God saw that it was good' does not occur at the end of the second day in the MT, but is misplaced into the middle of the third day, precisely after the creation of earth. As a result the third day is declared good twice. The LXX noticed this problem and tidied it up by moving the favourable judgement of God to where it would seem to belong, in the present 70 Coffin Texts 261, line 6. 71 W. G. Lambert, 'A New Look at the Babylonian Background of Genesis', jfTS,jfTS, NS, 16 (1965), p. 269: 'My opinion is that the second and third days contain originally unrelated traditions, put in this sequence by the Hebrew author'.</page><page sequence="31">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 471 setting before the refrain about 'evening and morning' in v. 8. However, this is without a doubt the easier reading and is there fore not to be preferred.7" The reading of the MT seems to bear witness to the fact that it was indeed the understanding of P's inherited material that the two stages of the creation of heaven (vv. 6—8) and the creation of earth (vv. 9-10) relate to a single 'phase' of creation. If the creation of heaven and earth was indeed originally consid ered one episode and the work of a single day, the fact still remains that there are two separate stages relating to the management of the waters. One speaks of the 'division' of the waters (v. 6) result ing in the creation of the firmament, and the other the 'gathering' of the waters (v. 9) resulting in the appearance of dry land. In what sense could these be understood to have any fundamental bond or connection? Are they not arbitrary traditions juxtaposed? The division of the waters and the gathering of the waters could both appropriately find a place in Egyptian cosmology. J. P. Allen's summary of creation in Egypt has potentially inter esting consequences if it is read with the priestly narrative in mind: The creation itself is described in a series of discrete yet interdependent events. Within the Monad appears a space devoid (Shu) of the Primeval Waters, separating earth (Geb) from the surface of the Waters (Nut). As the Waters receded, the first mound of land became distinct (Ta-tenen), and the sun rose over it to begin the ever-recurring cycle of life.73 According to this analysis, the separating of the waters and the receding of the waters are related but distinct stages in Egyptian cosmology. The separating of the waters by the atmosphere creates a void with a distinction between top and bottom,7 that is the heavenly firmament and the watery earth; but the latter still has to drain for the dry land to emerge and the sea to form. It is itself probably an ancient composite tradition combining ori ginally distinct elements. Such a picture transferred to the priestly creation account makes complete sense of the concept of division 72 This indication of a disturbance in the present state of the text was noted by J. Wellhausen, Die Composition des Hexateuchs und der historischen Bücher des Alten Testament Testament (Berlin, 18892), pp. 187 ff. 73 J. P. Allen, Genesis in Egypt, p. 58. 74 Ibid., p. 25 : 'The creation of the void produced simultaneously a distinction between Top and Bottom—sky and earth—within the void, and preceded the development of all the other elements of nature: "the eldest that Atum made with his efficacy, when he gave birth to Shu and Tefnut in Heliopolis , when he parted Geb from Nut, before the first Corps [of gods] was born, before the two original Enneads developed" (Coffin Text 80, lines 74-79)'.</page><page sequence="32">472 JAMES E. ATWELL with its double consequence, but also does justice to the gathering of the waters. The two stages could be prized apart because they had a separate identity, but only once the carriers of the tradition had lost any awareness of the significance of the relationship between them. If the creation of heaven and earth is taken as originally a single episode in the priestly inherited material, then the number of phases or acts of creation to be identified within the limits of Schmidt's primitive material would be seven. In that case it is quite conceivable that the priestly tradents received the tradition already in that form. This involves the assumption that the fish and birds created together (on the fifth day according to the present text) is a feature of the primary material. Westermann states: 'We can say with certainty that at one stage the creation of the water animals was a separate story and that the creation of the birds was grafted on to it. This took place at an early stage, because they were together in the tradition that came to P'.75 It could be an indication that Schmidt's earliest form of the tradition already had a prehistory during the course of which the number seven had been imposed upon it. It is likely that it did not simply emerge, but was a deliberate and considered devel opment at an early stage. W. H. Schmidt76 adduces a passage from a hymn to Amun-Re where fish and fowl are considered together. That may be confirmation that we are here dealing with the pre-Hebrew Egyptian phase of the text's history. The number seven was a significant number, as Cassuto reminds us.77 It is well established in the Ugaritic myths, in par ticular with the seven-yearly drama of Mot's (Death's) bid for power as well as with the seven days of construction of Ba'al's temple. It is integral to the 'fat' and 'lean' years of the narrative of Joseph in Egypt. There is some evidence for the significance of the number seven in ancient Egypt, although it was by no means exclusively important. For instance Triads were a distinc tive feature of the New Kingdom. However Professor J. Gwyn Griffiths affords the following quotation: Sethe sees the prominence of four in Egypt gradually yielding to that of seven. Certainly there are plenty of irrational sevens. Sethe cites the seven cows of the underworld; the seven gods and serpents with which the dead 75 C. Westermann, Genesis 1—11, pp. 135-6. 76 W. H. Schmidt, Die Schöpfungsgeschichte der Priester sehr ift, p. 124, draws attention to a passage in a Hymn to Amon-Re where birds and fish are referred to together. For the lines of the hymn in question see ANET p. 366 (vi) Lines 5-6. 7 U. Cassuto, Genesis /,pp. 12 ff.</page><page sequence="33">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 473 must associate; the seven scorpions which accompany Isis in the Delta in the Metternich Stela; the seven Hathors who help with childbirth, and the several medical groups of seven. Many examples apply to ritual procedures.78 It would not be surprising to find the significant figure seven shaping a tradition of the number of the works of the creator. If so, it is interesting to note that it is likely that these seven acts would have been associated with the work of a single day. In ancient Egypt the significance of the first sunrise in calling all things into being associated the creation of the cosmos with the cycle of a single day. If early tradition had already moulded the acts of the creator into a mystical seven associated with a single day, then those acts were simply waiting to be distributed over a period of seven days reflected in the celebration of a festival. That festival was in all likelihood the autumn Feast of Tabernacles in Jerusalem. The distribution of the seven acts of creation over seven days is clearly a development in the Hebrew phase of the tradition. The Hebrews used a lunar calendar and measured the week in seven days. By contrast, the Egyptians were conversant with the solar calendar and measured the week in ten days. That the number seven became associated with the days of a week before the present specifically sabbath arrangement, with a , day of rest, was imposed on the text is suggested by the text of Genesis 2:2. As it stands, the text suggests that God actually finished his work on the seventh day. The LXX, aware of this prob lern, has substituted the number six for seven. Again it is so much the simpler reading that it cannot be accepted. But it witnesses to an early awareness that the text does not read naturally. Scholars have tried various ways of getting around this difficulty. Skinner states: 'To take the vb. as plup. (Calv. al) is grammatically impossible. The only remaining course is to give a purely negative sense to the vb. finish, i.e. 'desisted from', 'did not continue' The last view may be accepted, in spite of the absence of convincing parallels'.79 A. Heidel takes as decisive the context of the preceding two verses that envisage God's work as complete and maintains we have here a 'declarative pi'el'. He therefore translates: 'And on the seventh day God declared His work finished'.80 Cassuto tries comparisons with 78 J. Gwyn Griffiths, Triads and Trinity (Cardiff, 1996), p. 21. The reference is to K. Sethe, Von Zahlen und Zahlworten bei den alten Ägyptern (Strassburg, 1916). 79 J. Skinner, Genesis, p. 37. 80 A. Heidel, The Babylonian Genesis, p. 127.</page><page sequence="34">474 JAMES E. ATWELL usage elsewhere in P, and adduces in particular Exodus 40:33 where the erection of the tent of meeting is completed, and P reports 'so Moses finished his work'.81 Westermann agrees that this was a fixed form of speech at hand to P.82 But the problem still remains as to why the narrative does not leave this 'point final' under the previous day, but carries it over into the seventh. The simplest and most straightforward solution remains that of Wellhausen. In the layer of tradition behind the immediate text the acts of God were distributed over seven days, 'And on the seventh day God finished his work which he had made; and he rested ...' (Genesis 2:2). In other words humankind was formed on the seventh day as the Maker's crowning achievement. For the final stage of the text we may look for some light once more to W. G. Lambert.83 He makes the point that the tradents of P were not original thinkers in the sense of making up new ideas. They could not simply have 'invented' the sabbath rest of God. Their creativity was evident rather through the novel arrangement and juxtaposition of old and prized traditions. Lambert further makes the point that the sabbath in Israel has at least two justifi cations for its institution (Exodus 20:11 and Deuteronomy 5:15). This suggests that as an institution it is older than both, and that the rest of creation is therefore an interpretation imposed upon it. .The implications are that P had two traditions to hand. One recounted the creation of the world in seven days, and told that on the seventh day, after the completion of human beings, God 'desisted from', 'ceased from', 'brought to a conclusion' (שבת) his works. The other preserved the ancient institution of the sab bath (שבת), and the religious duty of a day of rest on the seventh day.84 Once these traditions were brought together the potential for priestly theology was fascinating. The sabbath rest became exalted to an order of creation. The new combination of traditions forced the creation of human beings from the seventh day, and therefore necessitated a reallocation of the 'creation week' to six U. Cassuto, Genesis /, pp. 61 ff. 82 C. Westermann, Genesis 1-11, p. 170. 83 W. G. Lambert, 'A New Look at the Babylonian Background of Genesis', JTSJTS NS, 16 (1965), pp. 296 ff. 84 The Hebrew provides the pun, which would not have been present in the Egyptian, for the priestly theological innovation. Whether the etymology is to be connected is another question. C. Westermann, Genesis /-//, p. 173, states: 'It can remain an open question whether the verb שבת is to be linked with the noun שבת; they already occur in the same context in J in Ex. 16:29 f• (cf• M. Noth, Exodus, 1962, p. 136.)'.</page><page sequence="35">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 475 days. This accounts for the congestion of two acts of creation on the sixth day. At a subsequent, but somewhat similar, stage in the tradition history of our text we perceive a further patterning at work which extended the order and symmetry of the material.85 The six days of activity are divided neatly into two halves, with the corres ponding days of each half mirroring the other. We may usefully reproduce this correspondence in chart form as follows: Preparation Preparation of Environment. Filling of Environment. Day i Day 4 Let there be light. Let there be lights. Day 2 Day 5 The creation of the firmament Fishes and fowl fill the sea restricts the sea and creates the and the heaven, atmospheric space (heaven). Day 3 Day 6 (i) Dry land appears. (i) Terrestrial animals and human beings are created. (ii) Green things; seeding (ii) Allocation of food for plants and fruit trees sprout animals &amp; human beings, forth. Day ל The Sabbath rest of God. It is this stage which accounts for the shifting of the point at which the heavenly bodies were made. Their present position, which we have previously noted is somewhat illogical, is quite consistent with the internal symmetry of the narrative. It is likely that this stage also accounts for the fracture of day 2 and the prizing apart of the traditions relating to the creation of heaven and earth. The emergence of dry land is now appropriate to day 3. The dry land and its greening need to occur on the same day, to correspond with the creatures with which it is filled and the allocation of food on day 6. With this final patterning the priestly signature is complete, and the creation account embodies the order and balance which P associates with the divine activity. It concludes with the sabbath rest, and firmly anchors the cultic life of Israel in the Creator's purpose in establishing world order. 85 See U. Cassuto, Genesis I, p. 17, and J. Skinner, Genesis, pp. 8-9.</page><page sequence="36">476 JAMES E. ATWELL III.III. THE THEOLOGICAL THRUST OF THE NARRATIVE We turn now to our final question: what is the theological thrust of the narrative as it now stands? Within the movement of the primary material, as Schmidt has identified it, the thrust of the narrative moves towards the creation of human beings as the climax of the Creator's achievement. The Creator has certainly embarked upon a cosmos which includes all things in 'heaven and earth', and covers the stars as well as the minutiae of the biology of living creatures. Yet within this vast cosmos the humanistic motivation of the wisdom tradition has imposed a 'human centredness' upon it. We can draw a parallel with Genesis 2, where the small world of garden-orchard and domestic animals is created around Adam. In the primary mater ial of Genesis 1 the whole cosmos is, if not created around human beings, at least moving towards their appearance as the crowning glory of the Creator's work. This assessment of human destiny would have been totally foreign to Mesopotamian thinking. But it would have been at home in ancient Egyptian thought at those moments in its development when the humanistic influences of the wisdom tradition were strong; we may think particularly of the evidence afforded by the Instruction for King Merikare in the First Intermediate Period. The final stage of the tradition as we have it in Genesis 1:1—2:4a is different. The sabbath has interposed. As a result the fashioning of human beings 'in the image of God' is still very significant, but no longer the goal of the narrative. The thrust of the narrative now leads on through the days of creation to the rest of God on the seventh day. That is now the climax of the story. The effect of the sabbath has been to restore a God-centredness to the account of the creation of the cosmos. We say 'to restore' advisedly. We have constantly had cause to note that the tradition, even before the spring bubbled up to be the source of the flowing rivers of its priestly phase, had a history. That history was grounded in the Egyptian concept of the order of creation dominated by Ma'at. In that order human beings had a dignity and a responsibility, but only as part of the Creator's total order. The world did not receive its purpose from serving the needs of humanity, nor by being a sort of backdrop or theatre for the convenience of the human drama alone. The world received its purpose because that was the way the Creator had made it. The fact that it was God's initiative and God's achievement was all the justification its existence required. Human beings and the</page><page sequence="37">AN EGYPTIAN SOURCE FOR GENESIS 1 477 gods were simply servants of this God-given order. The chick in the egg, the gnat and the worm had in God a justification of their own. The priestly narrative of creation six times declares the world in its individual parts to be 'good', and once in its entirety 'very good'. In an omission which should not be regarded as significant human beings actually miss out, and are not included under one of the 'goods'. However they are part of the total order which is declared 'very good'. It is an indication that they are not quite the preoccupation of the final form of the narrative that they were of an earlier stage. The priestly tradition witnesses to the ordering of the cosmos by the Creator. It is a witness to a God-centred world. Human beings have rights, duties, responsibilities, a significant place in the Creator's scheme. But over against that the physical and mater ial order, as well as the natural world of plants and animals, have a justification other than that of serving the welfare of humanity. The only justification they need for their existence is that God enjoys them: 'and God saw that it was good'. They have been called into being by him. The Bible in its opening verses tells of a a wonderful and ordered cosmos which receives both its origin and its continuing significance from God alone. T . . James E. Atwell</page></plain_text>
