<plain_text><page sequence="1">SUMMER 1982 Volume 34, Number 3 HANS-ROBERT JAUSS Job's Questions and their Distant Reply: Goethe, Nietzsche, Heidegger Q UESTION and answer are more dominant in the Book of Job than in any other text. Their mythical and theological functions enter into a conflict that runs through the history of the reception of the text and calls into play philosophy as well. Since both a highly poetic text and a theological problem with aesthetic implications are involved, literary hermeneutics also has a word-although certainly not the last word-to say on the subject. The traditional text handed down to us poses the problem of the obvious "literarization" it has undergone. The original prose folktale modeled on legends of the "suffering upright man" was modified by the later addition of the Satan scenes to include the prologue and the highly literary motif of the wager-later adopted by Goethe in the "Prolog im Himmel" of Faust-which makes God a spectator, as it were, of the cruel game He allows Satan to play with Job. The dialogue between Job and his friends, which is elevated to poetic speech by the verse form, comprises Chapters 3-37 and is inserted between the seven days' and seven nights' commiseration and the restitutio ad in- tegrum with the intercession, the twofold restitution and the blessed death. It consists of three cycles of speeches and counterspeeches, all leading to an insoluble aporia. The highly dramatic tension of the dialogue has its origin in the fact that it is only through his dispute with his friends that Job is able to rise above his personal complaints to question the reason for suffering and injustice in the world and to find the courage to sue for justice before an unanswering God. Jehovah, after his long and obstinate silence, responds to the growing vehemence of the questioning (which Job, however, continually modulates with a 193</page><page sequence="2">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE moving plea for an answer)1 not with an answer but with an enormous catalogue of more than seventy counterquestions. This most remarkable speech of God with its enigmatic descriptions and hymns to Behemoth and Leviathan goes so far beyond its function of reprimanding by means of the annihilating question "Are you the creator ?" that another god, mythical and comparable to the nature god Baal, unmistakably appears behind Jehovah, God of history and the just Lord of Israel. The ending finally resolves Job's difficulty with a last, theologically controversial, poetic (and therefore all the more powerful) ambiguity: although Job submits to his God and Lord with the formula "therefore have I uttered that I understood not" (42.3), Jehovah seems to prefer Job's unorthodox questions to the orthodox answers of Job's friends whom He reprimands after He has distinguished Job, his servant, with a face-to-face appearance. The ambiguity of this ending poses the question whether the Book of Job can justifiably be considered an early theodicy. Blumenberg suggested in an earlier discussion, which I should like to take up again here, that a distinction be made between theodicy and theology with respect to the canonizing or decanonizing function of question and answer. In the face of the misfortune and human suffering in the world, a theodicy attempts to reveal the higher justice of God within an im- penetrable order which is merely masked by a seemingly painful reality; a theology, on the other hand, rejects the justification of God by man- kind, dismisses the canon of just compensation as anthropomorphic, and asserts that God's will is rationally incomprehensible. With regard to the interaction of religion and literature, "a theodicy narrows the scope of aesthetic phenomena by its tendency to canonize the permis- sible, whereas a theology frees these phenomena and grants license for the expansion of what is relevant and representable."2 If we consider Job's questioning protest, the Book of Job-customarily interpreted as a theodicy in the sense that it is a justification of God's actions answer- ing the question of the meaning of suffering-is, rather, a "theology" that ventures to broach in literary form a reality hitherto excluded by the dogma and canon of the representable. J. Taubes, however, has presented an opposing thesis: 1 See Job 9.34-35, 13.3-22, 19.7, 20, 23.5, 31.35, 43.4. While I have used the Ziircher Bibel (1942; rpt. Stuttgart, 1980), English quotations from Job are from the King James Version (1611; rpt. New York, 1974) unless noted otherwise. I have also made use of Hans-Dieter Bastian, Theologie der Frage (Munich, 1970), pp. 272 ff., and C. Kuhl and W. Werbeck, "Hiobbuch," in Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart, ed.

Satan appears in person not in the theology of the Pentateuch ... but rather in the theodicy of the Book of Job. Within the boundaries of its conciliating enclosure, a theodicy allows for an inten- sified expression of the suffering and ugliness in the world that is not character- istic of the theology of Genesis. The theology of Genesis receives its answers before its questions; the dark ground is covered with the order of the creating God. (Poetik, p. 545) In his reply to this objection, Blumenberg insisted that the Old Testa- ment Book of Job does not merit-as Leibniz' work does-the title of a theodicy, above all because of its aesthetic motivations: "Is this game between the 'lofty Lords' with humanity at stake really fully justified by its results? I still maintain that this is an example of dualism trans- lated into a voluntaristic idiom in which only those questions may be asked which have already been answered. God as a spectator of the theater of the world, for whom all creatures are, in Luther's formula- tion, masks [Larven] and mummery-that is not a theodicy but its provocation" (Poetik, p. 547). It would be an all too facile solution to gloss over the conflict between philosophical and theological hermeneutics by presuming that Taubes has redefined theodicy to include the decanonizing function and that therefore theodicy ultimately means for him the same thing that the- ology does for Blumenberg. Blumenberg's definition of theodicy cer- tainly challenges us to trace historically its aesthetic permutations. From a historical viewpoint we see that a theodicy progressively re- moves the limits of the canon of the permissible and in so doing aban- dons the idea of theological legitimization. In the final stage of this process, represented by Goethe and Nietzsche, God is so completely exonerated of the misfortune of the world that art assumes the functions of final justice and redemption, and the world appears as already justified as an aesthetic phenomenon-and as that alone.3 One might object that it would probably be difficult for Taubes to identify the "conciliating enclosure" of the Book of Job (Poetik, p. 545). The famous verse 19.25 could support Taubes' thesis only with the help of Luther's harmonizing translation, "Aber ich weiBY, daB mein Erl6ser lebet" ("For I know that my Redeemer liveth"), or, in terms of the history of reception, with the help of a hermeneutic inversion of the intention of the text, "Ich aber weir3: mein Anwalt lebt" ("For I know my vindicator lives").4 And it seems to me that we are still faced with a I have shown elsewhere that the chivalric novel can be seen as a theodicy in Leibniz' sense.

The theophany is certainly not a specific answer to all Job's questions, nor does it establish a new and theologically viable norm. These premises suggest the value and interest of a further interpre- tation of the Book of Job centered on the function of question and answer. In conformity with the rights of the Lord, God poses the first questions to Satan, one of the sons of God: "Whence comest thou ? ... Hast thou considered my servant Job, that there is none like him in the earth ?" (1.7-8). With his second question, Jehovah himself pro- vokes the wager into which Satan entices him, interestingly enough, with the first counterquestion of the text: "Does Job fear God for nought? ... But put forth thine hand now, and touch all he hath, and he will curse thee to thy face" (1.9, 11). Compositionally, Satan's counterquestion suggests the outcome of the encounter: Job will submit to his Lord when he is finally allowed to see him face to face. In the dialogue with Jehovah, Satan's counterquestion also announces the wager and the sporting nature of the challenge, both of which Jehovah later confirms when, before submitting Job to his second test, he says: "And still he holdeth fast his integrity, although thou movedst me against him, to destroy him without cause" (2.3). Even if one is to assume from this statement that God is sure of His case, the admission that He has bargained against His will makes the previously latent dualism clearly evident. Is Satan perhaps not mentioned at the end of the book so that these premises may be forgotten? The exchange of questions and answers between Job and his friends -a dialogue in which God, though silent, is continually present as a third authority-allows the game to go on in bitter earnest. It is already apparent in the outward form of the dialogue, in the abruptness with which the interlocutors begin to speak ("No doubt but ye are the people, and wisdom shall die with you," 12.2) and in the constant disputing of others' competence ("What ye know, the same do I know also: I am not inferior unto you," 13.2; "Let me alone, that I may speak, and let come on me what will," 13.13), that here it is not a question of a mutual search for truth in the Socratic manner, but rather of making good one's position over against the other party as in a does the Oxford Annotated Bible, ed. Herbert G. May and Bruce M. Metzger (New York, 1962), but the editors of the Oxford Bible suggest that "vindicator" would be more accurate. The German Anwalt further stresses the need for an advocate or mediator-S. L. 196</page><page sequence="5">JOB, GOETHE, NIETZSCHE, HEIDEGGER court case. The lament of the suffering Job, culminating in the question "Why died I not from the womb ?" (3.11), is recast into the basic question of a theodicy, "Wherefore is light given to him that is in misery?" (3.20). The dogmatic reply turns the responsibility back upon the questioner by concluding that he who suffers must be guilty. "Remember, I pray thee, who ever perished, being innocent? or where were the righteous cut off ?" (4.7). The pious advice attached to this conclusion ("Behold, happy is the man whom God correcteth: therefore despise not thou the chastening of the Almighty," 5.17) does not ap- pease Job, who counters by reproaching his friends for their insincerity and self-righteousness, since his guilt has yet to be proved (6.24-30). Then, in order to ward off the monstrous inference from his suffering to a secret guilt, unknown even to him, he resorts to images of awesome natural powers which exceed human powers of comprehension: "Am I a sea, or a whale, that thou settest a watch over me?" (7.12) ; "What is man, that thou shouldest magnify him ? ... and that thou shouldest visit him every morning?" (7.17-18). In a calculated literary inversion, these same images reappear in God's speech as counterquestions to Job: the sea ("Who shut up the sea with doors ?" 38.8), the whale in the form of a behemoth ("Behold now behemoth, which I made with thee," 40.15) with the ironic comparison "He is the chief of the ways of God" (40.19), and in the form of a leviathan ("He maketh the deep to boil like a pot... of ointment," 41.31). Since Job has mentioned the sea and the sea monster expressly to demonstrate the tiny proportions of his own case in comparison with the enormity of nature as created by God, it is a grotesque and at the same time a malicious inversion of the conversation when Jehovah demands that Job know precisely what he has already recognized as divine mysteries. The images which in Job's speech revealed his doubt and lamentations and, further, his wish for powerlessness ("I have sinned; what shall I do unto thee, O thou preserver of men? why hast thou set me as a mark against thee ?" 7.20) become in Jehovah's speech ex negativo the cynical literal-mindedness of a treacherous God. Thus Blumenberg's thesis proves to be true: the Book of Job is not a theodicy but its provocation, in the dual sense that the prevailing theology's framework of answers is shaken less by Job's insubordinate questions than by God's behavior which mocks all justice. The dual provocation of Job's questions and Jehovah's counter- questions, both in the primary context and in its later reception, has been taken up and answered in the theodicies of other theologians and poets; we cannot pursue its later history here. I should like to stress only that the answer Job gives in the beginning to his doubting wife, "Shall we receive good at the hand of God, and shall we not receive evil?" (2.10), reveals the frontier which Job's questions do not cross. 197</page><page sequence="6">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Job's answer leaves open whether God's evil is only to be accepted or also desired, and indeed whether it can be desired at all. This theodicean question, which was later to become so famous, is not formulated by Job himself when he must acknowledge that man has no rights before God, regardless of whether he knows himself to be guilty or innocent (9.2-22), and this leads to the bitterest conclusion: "If I be wicked, why then labor I in vain ?" (9.29). Here Job confronts the absolute and unquestionable will of God, and thus the question of His justice becomes essentially meaningless. From a human point of view, this voluntaristic God can, of course, be caught in a self-contradiction, but He cannot be asked to justify His actions. Nevertheless, Job ventures the daring question, "Is it good unto thee that thou shouldest oppress, that thou shouldest despise the work of thine hands, and shine upon the counsel of the wicked ?" (10.3). This question answers concurrently the previ- ously raised theological reproof, "Shall mortal man be more just than God? shall a man be more pure than his Maker?" (4.17), with the reversed conclusion, How can you condemn what you yourself made in your own image? But the high point of Job's defense as an equal against his divine adversary occurs in the verses where the profound misery of Job's lamentations is transformed into an appeal to God his friend, parent, and avenger to protect him against God his enemy and merciless persecutor: "Mine eye poureth out tears unto God. Oh that one might plead for a man with God, as a man pleadeth for his neigh- bor !" (16.20-21). Here the enigmatic, voluntaristic God is called into question in the name of the God who loves His creation, in a gesture which recalls the appeal to the gods of Goethe's Iphigenia: "Rettet mich / Und rettet euer Bild in meiner Seele!" (lines 1716-17).5 Ger- hard von Rad's theological interpretation ("In the enormous tension of Job's struggle, God's image threatens to tear [Job] apart") endeavors to see in this splitting of God a first, comforting, blessed experience of a "redeeming God."6 This seems to me to come no nearer the ancient power of this scene than literary interpretations on the model of Goethe's Greek drama which make Job himself call on the friendly God to help him against the enemy God, if not in the idealistic sense of perfecting God's image in man's soul then certainly in the ancient sense contained in the dictum, likewise evoked by Goethe, Nemo contra deum nisi deus ipse.7 In the primary context of both passages (16.19 ff. and 5 Johann Wolfgang von Goethe, Iphigenie auf Tauris, in Goethes Werke, V, ed. Josef Kunz (1952; rpt. Hamburg, 1958). 6 Theologie des Alten Testaments (Munich, 1962), I, 413. See also Ernst Bloch's treatment of this subject in Atheismus im Christentum: Zur Religion des Exodus und des Reichs (Frankfurt, 1973), p. 127; hereafter cited in the text. 7 The fact that H. Blumenberg attributes this dictum to Goethe himself with very convincing arguments does not detract from my interpretation which, rather, 198</page><page sequence="7">JOB, GOETHE, NIETZSCHE, HEIDEGGER 19.23 ff.) Job is seeking his right before, and, if need be, also against, God; he is not seeking an act of mercy, still less redemption. His evoca- tion of the guarantor-God appeals to a higher authority summoned when the silent God appears to be an interested party. Therefore, Job's closing statements end with a demand that he be judged ("Let me be weighed in an even balance that God may know mine integrity," 31.6), and he acts boldly, like one sure of his own innocence, listing in a series of questions the transgressions he knows he has not committed, docu- menting his innocence, swearing and setting his signature to it. This is followed by a final demand that God provide him with a written indict- ment, a metaphor of indestructible self-confidence that could not be more Kleist-like and seeks its equivalent in the image field of question and answer: "Oh that one would hear me! behold, my desire is, that the Almighty would answer me, and that mine adversary had written a book. Surely I would take it upon my shoulder, and bind it as a crown to me" (31.35-36). The speech with which Jehovah finally emerges from his silence ("Then the Lord answered Job out of the whirlwind," 38.1) strictly denies Job an answer, replying only with counterquestions, and yet in the end does indeed give him an answer, the surrogate answer of the theophany. The denial of dialogic parity is made clear in the opening sentence by the lack of the vocative with which Jehovah usually ad- dresses His interlocutor: "Who is this that darkeneth counsel by words without knowledge ?" (38.2). Thus the dialogue partner is degraded from thou to an anonymous who, and God's absolute distance from man is reaffirmed. The asymmetry of the dialogue is maintained even after Jehovah has introduced thou with the imperative, "Gird up now thy loins like a man, for I will demand of thee, and answer thou me" (38.3), because the eristic inaugural formula can only be meant ironically when the All-knowing mocks the unknowing by inquiring about something that the Creator alone could know and that for Job is not the matter in question. "Jehovah answers moral questions with physical ones, with a blow out of the immeasurably dark and wise cosmos against the limited understanding of subordinate man" (Bloch, p. 123). Perhaps Bloch has grasped most clearly the strangeness of this theophany in which the power and sublimity of primitive poetry enter into an unholy alliance with the violence of mythical catechizing and makes this "other God," who has nothing in common with the Jehovah of Genesis and the Exodus from Egypt, part of the same family as a demonic Isis, a nature investigates more deeply, through an analysis of Job, the monstrosity of the split. ting of the concept of God. 199</page><page sequence="8">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE god Baal, or a Krishna. Bloch's interpretation of the ending as an orthodox scene serving to "cover up the heresies" (p. 124) does not, however, seem convincing to me. A philosophical interpretation of the Book of Job as an "exodus from Jehovah Himself" with the messianic hope for a new earth and a new heaven goes as far beyond the limits of the primary context as does a theological interpretation which sees Job's reaction to the theophany as an acceptance of questioning and uncer- tainty which is ultimately "the mode of the creature's existence before his Creator which God demands of Job."s This interpretation, which also betrays its modernity in its meta- phorical short circuit ("Job himself must be able to live with a question which he conceives in human terms"), depends erroneously on line 42.4 of Job's final speech: "I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me." This line is a word-for-word quotation of God's first speech (38.3). It cannot, therefore, be Job's answer to the theophany, espe- cially since from now on Job has no questions at all to direct to God, but rather is allowed to end his life in unquestioning happiness with God's blessing ("So Job died, being old and full of days," 42.17). Job's answer to the theophany completes the compositional shape of the dialogue with God. Job takes up the beginning of God's speech again and after his general concession, "I know that thou canst do all things," answers first Jehovah's question and then His demand, "And declare thou unto me." The quoted question "Who is he that hideth counsel without knowledge ?" is followed by Job's admission that "therefore have I uttered that I understood not" (42.3). However, God's "I will demand of thee, and declare thou unto me," which Job also quotes, is not followed by further questions, but rather by Job's recognition of what Jehovah, instead of any answer to his questions and despite the sarcastic rebuff of the counterquestions, has allotted him: the face-to- face encounter: "I have heard of thee by the hearing of the ear; but now mine eye seeth thee: Wherefore I abhor myslf, and repent in dust and ashes" (42.4-6). The recantation formula alludes to the theophany alone and opposes "having seen" explicitly to "only having heard" and implicitly to the reply Job has only heard. Could it therefore be said that Job submits to God because he is able to recognize and therefore ac- knowledge his Lord face to face, and not because the divine reply has enlightened him with answers which completely resolve his questions? This conjecture is supported by Jehovah's rebuff-certainly unexpected -to the three friends: "My wrath is kindled against thee [Eliphaz the Temanite] and against thy two friends: for ye have not spoken of me the thing that is right, as my servant Job hath" (42.7). If the friends' 8 Bastian, p. 274. 200</page><page sequence="9">JOB, GOETHE, NIETZSCHE, HEIDEGGER orthodox answers are rejected by God, the highest authority in the dialogue, does it not necessarily follow that Job's heterodox questions which " [speak] of me the thing that is right" will-once they are estab- lished as legitimate-continue to exist and to demand an answer even when Job himself no longer asks them ? Job's questions are such that they must constantly be re-asked be- cause they can never be conclusively answered; and when at the end of the Enlightenment Job's God was relieved of the burden of justifying His creation, these questions challenged philosophy and literature. I know of no better witness than Ernst Bloch, who interpreted Job's rebellion as an "exodus from Jehovah," a step toward freeing human- ity, but who also in his history Atheismus im Christentum joins in the questioning: "Does not materialistic dialectic itself, that is, the fact that it requires such a protracted, such a terrible process, also need to be justified?" (Bloch, p. 133). The simplest resolution of theodicy, promised in the French Enlightenment's phrase que dieu n'existe pas, could not make Job's question simply superfluous; henceforth, the phi- losophy of history has assumed the burden of questioning while litera- ture has continued to attempt to transfer theodicy into its own realm and to justify the world as an aesthetic phenomenon.9 Goethe's and Valery's Fausts, which I have discussed in an earlier article,1' present the poetic history of theodicy at a crucial point in its later development. Goethe renewed the Faust myth in such a way that it refers back to Job and brings theodicy into play by transforming the pact with the devil into a wager introduced in the "Prolog im Himmel" before the beginning of the play. Goethe's human drama answers the newly posed Mephistophelean question whether this world was indeed created for human happiness with his modern interpretation of Faust's fate, in which Faust serves God "auf besondere Weise" and can find an answer only by virtue of his endless striving. For Valery, the ques- tion of the meaning of evil has lost its metaphysical justification in the modern world where knowledge and abilities constantly surpass their own limits. Mon Faust brings this obsolete theodicy to an end by placing Mephistopheles in a comic role as a bypassed seducer who can only boast of his mythological grandeur. Valery calls upon the oldest Christian myth, the eating of the apple in Genesis 3, in order to revise the myth of the Fall and to answer the persistent question left behind 9 On this subject see Odo Marquard, "Idealismus und Theodizee," PJGG, 73 (1965), 33-47. 10 See "Goethes und Valrys Faust: Zur Hermeneutik von Frage und Ant- wort," CL, 28 (1976), 201-32. 201</page><page sequence="10">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE by Goethe: can man discover the immanent fulfillment of his existence after renouncing all Faustian striving, including the illusion of technical control over the world, and without "redemption from above"? In my interpretation, Valhry's answer arises from the victory over the Car- tesian idol of his moi pur at the point where poetry's promise of happi- ness seems to be realized in the communication of the "I" and the "you," in what he called a mystical communion of body and soul, the union of Faust and Lust in an ecstasy which is, to be sure, very fragile. From a hermeneutic point of view this double example is also an application of question and answer in their literary function. It shows that although the question which a myth originally addressed may have been answered in a historical sense, the myth can still persist if its struc- ture of meaning as an answer to an old question can be reactivated, later on, by a new one, that is, if its structure of meaning can be under- stood differently by virtue of poetic appropriation. The original ques- tion of Johann Spies's Historia of 1587-why intellectual curiosity is sinful and leads to ruin if man, through magic, ventures out beyond the established boundaries of natural knowledge-had in the course of the Enlightenment been made unnecessary by the ennobling of theoretical curiosity. Lessing's Fragmente, in which Faust was to find redemption at the end of his journey, are symptoms of this change. If his new Faust were to deal with more than just the past, Goethe had to find a new question in order to make his subject accessible to current interests. This question was whether man, now come of age, could or must in his free striving for knowledge also find happiness-a question which could not be so easily answered in the affirmative after the turning point of the Premier Discours and Rousseau's insight into the inevitable discrep- ancy between advanced knowledge and lagging morality. But it is only after the old scholar is "vom Wissensdrang geheilt""' that Goethe raises the new question of his Faust: Could the whole of nature and humanity, no longer obtainable through knowledge (Wissen), be won again in the future by aesthetic understanding (genief/endes Erkennen)? Of course this question presupposes the answer to a previous question which Mephistopheles' doubt brings into play: "Glaub unsereinem: dieses Ganze / Ist nur ffir einen Gott gemacht !" (lines 1780-81). This is the theodicean question of the prologue which in this context not only sounds like an ironic summation of the explanation in the Book of Job but in fact also subsumes all of Job's questions under one weighty and, for God, highly embarrassing counterquestion, a question which post festum justifies Job, who was as yet unable to ask it. Thus Job's fall 11 Faust, in Goethes Werke, III, ed. Erich Trunz (1949; rpt. Hamburg, 1959), line 1768; all quotations from Faust are from this edition. 202</page><page sequence="11">JOB, GOETHE, NIETZSCHE, HEIDEGGER was appropriated by Goethe in the form of his Faust and the wager joined to the ancient pact with the devil, but now it was a matter of showing by means of Faust's fate the possibility of human self-fulfill- ment and thus the hidden ideality of the God-created world. My inter- pretation brings out the ambiguity of the poetic theodicy proposed by German idealism, which no longer requires the hope that the Redeemer live, but does indeed still require guilt and redemption from above. Nietzsche's "The Madman" in The Gay Science (Sec. 125) is a notable, although up to this point apparently unacknowledged, witness for the thesis that Job's questions continued to provoke reactions after the theodicean answer had, historically speaking, ceased to function. It was precisely with reference to this text that Heidegger explained Nietzsche's dictum "God is dead" as the event that caused Western metaphysics to turn aside into its own disarray.12 Nietzsche's modern parable confirms Heidegger's maxim that while a correct interpretation "never understands the text better than its author understood it, it does surely understand it differently" (Heidegger, p. 58). The hermeneutics of question and answer allows this text, too, to be understood differ- ently. The madman.-Have you not heard of that madman who lit a lantern in the bright morning hours, ran to the market place, and cried incessantly: "I seek God! I seek God !"-As many of those who did not believe in God were standing around just then, he provoked much laughter. Has he got lost? asked one. Did he lose his way like a child? asked another. Or is he hiding? Is he afraid of us ? Has he gone on a voyage? emigrated ?-Thus they yelled and laughed. The madman jumped into their midst and pierced them with his eyes. "Whither is God ?" he cried; "I will tell you. We have killed him-you and I. All of us are his murderers. But how did we do this? How could we drink up the sea? Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon? What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun? Whither is it moving now? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually? Backward, sideward, forward, in all directions? Is there still any up or down? Are we not straying as through an infinite nothing ? Do we not feel the breath of empty space ? Has it not become colder? Is not night continually closing in on us? Do we not need to light lanterns in the morning? Do we hear nothing as yet of the noise of the gravediggers who are burying God? Do we smell nothing as yet of the divine decomposition? Gods, too, decompose. God is dead. God remains dead. And we have killed him. "How shall we comfort ourselves, the murderers of all murderers? What was holiest and mightiest of all that the world has yet owned has bled to death under 12 Martin Heidegger, "The Word of Nietzsche: 'God is Dead,' " in The Ques- tion Concerning Technology and Other Essays, trans. William Lovitt (New York, 1977), pp. 53-112; hereafter cited in the text. 203</page><page sequence="12">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE our knives: who will wipe this blood off us? What water is there for us to clean ourselves? What festivals of atonement, what sacred games shall we have to in- vent? Is not the greatness of this deed too great for us? Must we ourselves not become gods simply to appear worthy of it? There has never been a greater deed: and whoever is born after us-for the sake of this deed he will belong to a higher history than all history hitherto." Here the madman fell silent and looked again at his listeners; and they, too, were silent and stared at him in astonishment. At last he threw his lantern on the ground, and it broke into pieces and went out. "I have come too early," he said then; "my time is not yet. This tremendous event is still on its way, still wander- ing; it has not yet reached the ears of men. Lightning and thunder require time; the light of the stars requires time; deeds, though done, still require time to be seen and heard. This deed is still more distant from them than the most distant stars-and yet they have done it themselves." It has been related further that on the same day the madman forced his way into several churches and there struck up his requiem aeternam deo. Led out and called to account, he is said always to have replied nothing but: "What after all are these churches now if they are not the tombs and sepulchers of God ?"13 The effect of this text is triggered by explicit questions with diverse rhetorical functions; they refer back to an implied question which the reader-in accord with the appellative structure of a parable-must discover and recognize as concerning himself. A dialogue which has God as its third, but absent, authority arises between the stock char- acter-the madman who from antiquity has illuminated truth by means of inversion (lanterns on a bright midday)-and the people in the market place, who have fallen under the spell of the idola fori. The great laughter awakened by the madman's cry "I seek God !" is transformed into a series of questions which deride one who seeks God by taking his statement literally. However, the mocking questions turn out to be profoundly ironic and in the end they backfire as the mockers' naivete is revealed by the madman's game. Taken literally, "to seek God" is to assume that He could get lost like any other thing which could be found again, or like a strayed child; since God can be neither the former nor the latter, the people in the market place consider anyone who seeks Him a fool. For the reader, who is to consider the issue further, the direction of the questioning becomes reversed in the face of this appar- ent absurdity. The series of mocking questions implies a series of counterquestions: How can one search unless there is something to search for which prompts the search in the first place? How can one lose something one has never possessed? Must not something like God exist if one still seeks Him? If He cannot get lost like a thing or a person, must He not exist in another form? Have the people in the marketplace ceased to believe in God simply because they no longer S13Friedrich Nietzsche, The Gay Science, trans. Walter Kaufmann (New York, 1974), pp. 181-82. 204</page><page sequence="13">JOB, GOETHE, NIETZSCHE, HEIDEGGER seek Him ? And if one cannot lose God, as one loses something in every- day life, how can He have disappeared ? It is precisely this implied question that the madman now articulates with his cry "Whither is God ?" and then immediately answers himself with the provocative avowal, "I will tell you. We have killed him-you and I." This monstrous accusation is completely in keeping with a mythical answer: apodictic, since it rejects all proof; conclusive, since it extinguishes the previous question; and at the same time unreal, since the idea that He could be killed by man contradicts the essence of God. Nevertheless, the madman's answer does not preclude further question- ing. On the contrary, it seems to have been asked in order to provoke the counterquestion "But how did we do this ?" and to explain what the question is by means of a long series of counterquestions. These ques- tions are the central issue of my interpretation not only because they are of the same type as those in the question-catalogue with which Jehovah reprimands Job, i.e., unanswerable, but also because in terms of content they are astoundingly analogous to the Old Testament text. The first question "How could we drink up the sea ?" corresponds to Job 38.8: "Or who shut up the sea with doors, when it brake forth, as if it had issued out of the womb ?" The second question "Who gave us the sponge to wipe away the entire horizon?" recalls Job 38.12-13: "Hast thou commanded the morning since thy days; and caused the dayspring to know his place; That it might take hold of the ends of the earth ?" The third question "What were we doing when we un- chained this earth from its sun ?" could presuppose Job 38.33: "Know- est thou the ordinances of heaven ? canst thou set the dominion thereof in the earth ?" Sea, horizon, sun, and earth constitute the center of the cosmic images in both texts. In both cases questions about these things are asked in order to demonstrate what man cannot make or do given only his own capabilities. The different metaphors of the image fields can easily be traced back to a poetics of the creation on the one hand and to a poetics of the end of the world on the other: the unanswerable nature of the counterquestions shows in one case man's inability to understand the work of the divine poet, and in the other how inconceivable it is to kill God: inconceivable, though paradoxically it has actually occurred as a deed whose greatness is "too great for us." This paradoxical statement "God is dead" hides a final, implied question which subsumes all the further questions, speeches, and actions of the madman (der tolle Mensch). It continues to exist as a provocation like Job's questions which Jehovah (one could almost say der tolle Gott) justifies with his theophany and upholds against any cleverness in answering and which no later theodicy could resolve. How can the thoughts provoked by 205</page><page sequence="14">COMPARATIVE LITERATURE Nietzsche's statement that "God is dead" be taken up by post-Nietz- schean philosophers ? How can the question "But how did we do this ?" be answered? Would not a theodicy have to make such an effort under extremely aggravated conditions, since it would have to justify the world and the history of mankind without being allowed to resolve Nietzsche's paradox either in the Christian way-in terms of Christ's death on the cross and His resurrection-or in the atheistic one-"que dieu n'existe pas" ? For "the greatest recent event-that 'God is dead' " (see Heidegger, quoting Nietzsche's Aphorism 343, p. 60)--necessarily implies that He could not have been dead before: an ex contrario proof of God's existence which moves Nietzsche's nihilism into a strange twilight. With the reconstruction of the implied question posed by Nietzsche's text, this literary interpretation has already reached the horizon of questioning of Heidegger's philosophical explanation. In the latter the counterquestions of the madman which in the primary context para- phrase the unthinkable (that God could be killed by man) are made applicable to the secondary context of the history of modern times. The question "What were we doing when we unchained this earth from its sun?" could call to mind the Copernican revolution as well as Plato's allegory of the cave (Heidegger, p. 106). For the resulting questions, "Whither is it moving now ? Whither are we moving? Away from all suns? Are we not plunging continually?" etc., exemplify the horror vacui and lend themselves to the cosmic images of sea, horizon, sun, and earth in the human insurrection of subjectivity, of the ego cogito, which displaces the suprasensible world as the truly existing one and makes the existent world as such into an object, and nature into simply an object of technology. Heidegger begins to resolve the paradox that God, who certainly cannot be killed or lost like any other person, was sup- posedly killed, by interpreting the act of killing as an event which men performed "even though today they have still heard nothing about it" (p. 105). Hereafter, the monstrous event from which the "autonomous" history of modern times with its metaphysics of the "will to power" chiefly proceeds will antedate the beginning of Western metaphysics: "The history of being begins, and indeed necessarily, with the forget- ting of Being" (p. 109). Here philosophical interpretation has slipped unnoticed into alle- gory: by substituting "forgetting of Being" for the "killing" of God, Heidegger brings the ambivalence of subjective and objective genitive to bear on the "forgetting of Being" and thus can solve Nietzsche's paradox! Insofar as the statement "we have killed God" is itself under- 206</page><page sequence="15">JOB, GOETHE, NIETZSCHE, HEIDEGGER stood as a symptom of the forgetting of Being, the killed one, as a for- gotten God in the destiny of Being, which withdraws into its own truth (p. 110) and therefore can also step into the light of its essence again, can, for a mind amenable to inversion, arise from the dead. If, as Hei- degger believes, the history of Western metaphysics is an as yet un- examined epoch in the history of Being, it is a history of the forgetting of Being and thus a theodicy. Understood as a late, if not belated, the- odicy, Heidegger's interpretation answers the direct provocation of Nietzsche's statement "God is dead" as well as the distant one of the Book of Job. The counterquestions to Heidegger's answer fall within the purview of philosophy. From my point of view, Heidegger's the- odicy as an answer to Job leaves behind the question whether the ontological solution even touches on the moral problem of the meaning of suffering. Does not Being in Heidegger's philosophy, which with- draws into its own truth, have one thing in common with the God of the Old Testament, who denies Job His truth: that neither of them needs or seems to reciprocate man's love?
