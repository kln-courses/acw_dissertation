Two meetings of the Council were held, with President Hrdlikka in the chair. COUNCIL MEETING, DEC. 28, 9:15 4.M. The following reports were read and accepted: REPORT OF THE SECRETARY The proceedings of the last annual meeting of the Association were published in the AMERICAN ANTHROrOLOGIST for January-March, 1926.

The duties of the office are not onerous, and result in most pleasant contacts with a wide circle of co-workers. It does not seem desirable, however, that tenure of the Secretaryship by any one individual should be unduly prolonged. Respectfully submitted, A. V.

In order to put the Association on a sounder financial basis the Treasurer would suggest the following measures of economy: (1) To reduce the number of free separates allowed each author to 25. The present allowance is 50. This reduction would represent a saving of about $135 per annum and would work no hardship upon the average author. There is ample precedent among other journals for the supplying of only twenty-five free separates to authors. (2) Increase the charge for the Association's publications to $6.00 per annum in the case of the thirty-three German libraries now receiving the Association's publications at $1.00 per year. The</page><page sequence="5">306 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 29, 1927 actual cost of producing and delivering the ANTHROPOLOGIST to these libraries was about $112 during 1926. The present financial status of the Association warrants the addition of a thousand dollars ($1000) to the Association's permanent fund. This would leave a thousand dollars in hand to begin the new year, which, coupled with the income for 1927 should be ample for operating expenses. On the basis of operations for 1926 the publica- tion of the AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST for 1927 will require about $2800. The salary of the editor's assistant will total $540, the salary of the treasurer's assistant, if increased to $35 per month, as ad- vocated elsewhere, would total $420, and the joint expenses of the editor's, treasurer's, and secretary's offices, apart from salaries, will be about $500. This makes a total operating expense of something over $4200. The income from members' dues, from sale of publica- tions, and from interest for 1927 should total at least $4800. In closing I should like to concur with the Editor in his suggestion as seeking outside support for the publication of the Memoirs. A subsidy, such as that bestowed by the Maori Research Board upon the Journal of the Polynesian Society, would be highly desirable and would permit the publication of valuable papers too lengthy for the AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST. The Association closes the year 1926 better off financially by $300 than at the close of 1925. Respectfully submitted, E. W. GIFFORD, Treasurer The accounts of the Treasurer, E. W. Gifford, have been examined and found correct. (Signed) R. H. LOWIE, A. L. KROEBER,, Auditing Committee REPORT OF THE EDITOR During 1926, thanks mainly to Mr. Gifford's efforts, the AMERI- CAN ANTHROPOLOGIST appeared approximately on schedule time, the October-December issue being distributed early in November. It has not been possible to give equal attention to the expeditious printing of the two memoirs, received a year ago. One of them, however, Dr. Elsie Clews Parsons' "A Pueblo Indian Journal, 1920- 1921" (Memoir 32), has appeared, while Mrs. E. S. Goldfrank's paper</page><page sequence="6">PHILADELPHIA MEETING AND PROCEEDINGS 307 on "The Social and Ceremonial Organization of Cochiti" is being paged at the time of writing.1 The Editor regrets to report that, owing to an abundance of contributions little to be expected when he took office two years ago, many papers have been unduly delayed in publication. There is no immediate remedy in sight unless additional funds be secured from outside sources. Papers, often valuable ones, continue to pour in, and naturally the Editor does not like to discourage their presenta- tion. Three considerations play a part in deciding what is to be used in a particular issue,-priority, news value, and length. The Editor strongly urges the Council to advise him (a) as to the desirability of applying for substantial annual grants to outside agencies, (b) as to supplementary or alternative means of coping with the situation. The greatest desideratum is undoubtedly the re-establishment of a regularly appearing Memoirs series to take care of long articles. The Editor was committed to the publication of several such during the last year, but seriously questions the propriety of continuing to run them under present conditions unless, as happened in one case, at the author's expense. Long papers should certainly be issued by the Association, but in appropriate memoir form. The Editor's difficulties all go back to a single ultimate source,- inadequate funds. It is impossible for the Editors to devote more than a limited portion of their time to the publications of the Associa- tion. The Editor has one half-time assistant who is generally a graduate student. Obviously the salary is insufficient to keep any one incumbent permanently nor can one reasonably expect to get one who, combines knowledge of anthropology with that of typing and proofreading at $45 a month. Moreover, students have other duties and interests which from personal and professional points of view may be more important than routine office work. The Editor earnestly requests the members to take these circumstances into account and to pardon delays in the acknowledgment of letters or articles, the preparation of contributions, omissions in the list of new publications, the forwarding of separates, etc. Each of these jobs requires time. As soon as the Association is ready to equip an editorial office on the Saturday Evening Post pattern, the service rendered will be made correspondingly more efficient. In the meantime the Editor penitently, but not too penitently, admits shortcomings in 1 It has since been issued.</page><page sequence="7">308 AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST [N. S., 29, 1927 the management of routine business and inquires whether, since the Association is unable to pay for a second half-time assistant, the members will take active measures to secure support for such addi- tional aid from outside sources. The Editor has no illusions as to the excellence of the ANTHRO- POLOGIST. He does not consider it on a par with L'Anthropologie, the Zeitschriftfiir Ethnologie, and Anthropos. So long as some of the most eminent members rarely or never contribute even reviews, the quality of the journal cannot come up to the highest standard achievable. From the Editor's point of view, two kinds of articles are most welcome,-authoritative summaries of real contributions to knowl- edge, whether due to the writer or others, and brief discussions of theory. There are several such in the editorial drawers, but far too few. A great desideratum would be the renewal of the annotated bibliography of Periodical Literature, which in former years was the peculiar service rendered to the Association by the late Professor Chamberlain. This would again require additional funds and co- operative effort on the part of the membership, but would be one of the greatest improvements in the magazine conceivable. A glance at Dr. HrdliEka's Journal of Physical Anthropology or Prof. Boule's L'Anthropologie indicates the advisability of resuming this section of the ANTHROPOLOGIST. However, it is a question whether the need of such summaries will be met by the new Ethnologischer Anzeiger. Duplication of effort is unprofitable; on the other hand, it remains to be seen how competently the Anzeiger will serve Americanist interest and to what extent it is likely to be accessible to our member- ship. Respectfully submitted, ROBERT H. LOWIE, Editor It was moved and passed: That the recommendation of the Treasurer that free separates to authors be reduced from fifty to twenty-five in number, be referred to the Committee on Publication with power to act. That the matter of increasing the price of the AMERICAN ANTHRO- POLOGIST to certain German libraries be referred to the Editor and Treasurer with power to act. That the Treasurer be instructed to submit at the next annual meeting a list of the securities in the Permanent Fund.</page><page sequence="8">PHILADELPHIA MEETING AND PROCEEDINGS 309 That the Treasurer be authorized to increase the salary of a part-time assistant from $25.00 to $35.00 per month. That the question of reinaugurating a section in the ANTHRO- POLOGIST devoted to abstracts of periodical literature be referred to the Committee on Publication. There were presented and accepted reports from the Committee on Relations between the Association and the National Research Council, the International Institute of African Languages and Cultures, and the Chairman of the Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences.

COUNCIL MEETING, DEC. 28, 5:30 P.M. 113 new members were elected; their names have been incorpor- ated in the list on p. 159 ff. January-March issue. It was moved and passed: That the present committees of Finance, Publication and Program be continued. That the next annual meeting be held at Andover, Massachusetts. That the Committee on Program be instructed to arrange the program for the Andover meeting in such a way as to realize the wish of the Council that this meeting be devoted largely to symposia and discussions of Policy. That the Council approves the project for the preparation by the Division of Anthropology and Psychology of the National Research Council of an index of the AMERICAN ANTHROPOLOGIST. That the Secretary be instructed to send telegrams conveying the greetings of the Association to Francis La Flesche, M. H. Saville and W. H. Holmes.
