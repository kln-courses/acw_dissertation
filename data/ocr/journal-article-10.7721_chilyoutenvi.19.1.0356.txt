<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Children, Youth and Environments  Vol. 19 No. 1 (Spring 2009)  ISSN: 1546-2250  Where Things Are, From Near To Far  Halbur, Tim and Steins, Chris and Ryan, David (2009).  Los Angeles: Planetizen Press; ISBN 0978932927.    I have sometimes attributed my career in planning to the  hours I spent as a young boy pouring over Richard Scarry’s  book What Do People Do All Day? I would lose myself  exploring every illustration, fascinated by the anthropomorphic  rabbit and pig families that inhabited the town squares, market  places, dentist offices and bus stations of “Busy Town.” It was  only after a fellow master’s student confessed that his path to  planning ran down Disneyland’s “Main Street, USA” that I felt  comfortable admitting this to anyone (including myself).  So hat’s off to Tim Halbur, Chris Steins, and David Ryan for  their recent contribution to children’s planning-related  literature. Told in verse and animated by drawings, the book is  a walk through “the urban to rural transect” with a son and his  mother as she reveals the disturbing truth of her day job:  she’s an urban planner.    All joking aside, it’s a noble effort at explaining planning to the  hard-to-reach 3-year-old market. The book uses simple  language, bold text, rhyme, and detailed illustrations to walk  us through the various built and natural environments of the  city and to introduce the central idea that cities don’t just  happen, they are built. Indeed, they are even planned.  My daughter enjoyed exploring each page, pointing out the  squirrels, the dog riding in the bike basket, and the Waldo- esque frog that jumps along with the main characters through  the book. But being the ripe age of seven, she haughtily  declared that the book was boring and “too easy.” She  allowed, however, that younger kids might enjoy it; a fact  </page> <page sequence="2">      357     confirmed by her 4-year-old friend Phineas, who deemed the  book “very nice” (even though his older brother Thaddeus  wouldn’t go beyond the cover). My 12-year-old son Kieran was  more insightful: “It’s a bit simplistic, but hey, it’s for 3-year- olds.”  Explaining planning to young children is no easy task. I  remember my experience at parent career day when my son  was in first grade. The dad before me was a fireman, and the  mother after me was a nurse. My brief talk on being a planner  drew many blank stares, and the thank-you note I received  later from one of my son’s friends read: “Thank you for your  talk. I didn’t know people did that.”  Where Things Are will not only help explain that indeed there  are people who do that, but will also introduce some important  realities of urban development: that we’ve constructed a  Euclidean system of separated uses where density is  concentrated at the core and tapers off into car-dominated  suburbs and a distant rural hinterland. Well, that’s the  traditional concept anyway, and it was one of the ideas I found  myself taking issue with as I enjoyed the book with my  daughter and her friends.  I certainly understand the usefulness of the transect, but  worry that it perpetuates the idea that “good planning” has to  provide for auto-dominated uses in sprawling suburban fringe  areas. Does it? And if it does, can’t we at least shelter our 3- year-olds from that reality until they are, say, five? Or do I  need to come clean with my kids and let them know that it is  the planner’s job to make “the suburbs wide”? Perhaps I’m  being naïve, but with climate change staring us in the face, I  think it’s time to polarize our rose-colored glasses and  question some of our current conceptions.  I detected that at least the book’s illustrator shares my  sympathies. I could swear that the little boy in Where Things  Are was walking with a bit less spring in his step as he passed  the suburban strip mall. Even his mother is pointing off the  page, into the promise of the less monotonous, more child- </page> <page sequence="3">      358     friendly environment of the transect’s rural segment. Both  mother and child seemed much happier during their walk  through the more compact, pedestrian-oriented neighborhoods  of the urban core. I pointed out these critical details to my  kids, but they were uninterested. They wanted to find the frog  on the page.  Maybe it’s that I yearn for a sequel, something titled,  perhaps, Where Things Should Be, For You and Me, in which a  child and his advocacy planning mother attend workshops to  engage in discussions with their neighbors on the virtues of  infill development, the joys of “complete streets,” and the  beauty of urban-to-the-edge development policies. This would  be a nice lead-in to a more complicated but enticing third  volume: Where the Wild Things Really Are: Mommy and I Go  to a Public Hearing. This would have to be heavily edited to  remove inappropriate language, and the frog might not want  to stay for the whole meeting. But it could provide a more  comprehensive and accurate view of his mother’s daily work  challenges.  But I digress, as cranky old planners do. It’s a nice book, and  its 3-year-old audience may reflect back on it fondly as they  prepare their applications to planning school in the years to  come. In fact, planner-parents who want to start early in  preparing their children for the AICP exam could start  withWhere Things Are, and then pass on their old Richard  Scarry books, and maybe throw in Dr. Seuss’s The Lorax for  good measure. Now that’s the makings of a respectable library  for every 3-year-old planner.
