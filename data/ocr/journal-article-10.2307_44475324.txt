<plain_text><page sequence="1">Paul Manning. Strangers in a Strange Land : Occidentalist Publics and Orientalist Geographies in Nineteenth-Century Georgian Imaginaries. Boston, MA: Academic Studies Press, 2012. 346 pp. Maps. Illustrations. References. Index. Cloth. The title of this challenging work tells much. Manning, a linguist by training and a cultural an- thropologist with much field work in Georgia, embeds a roman à clef seeking the identity of a "nobody" writing under a pseudonym in the Georgian newspaper Droeba [Times] in the late 1870s in a heady mixture of linguistic, anthropological, historical, and literary treatments that Stephen F. Jones (writing on the back cover) calls "a complex challenge to the familiar Western tropes of the imagined community" and "a novel theoretical contribution to our ideas about the role of intellectuals in national identity formation." For those primarily interested in learning more about Georgia or the Caucasus, the book may prove daunting, as readers must make their way through a thick jungle of historical and anthropological theory, on one hand, and unfamil- iar, "strange" geography and linguistic territory with ever-shifiing boundaries on the other. In a sense, the familiar crossing of the Russian traveler through the dangerous mountains and past the fierce mountaineers of the Caucasus into welcoming, Orthodox Georgia is indicative here of the journey ahead. And yet the book brings to the English-reading public much new informa- tion about the Georgian aristocracy and budding intelligentsia during the Russian Imperial Pe- riod. While the Georgians' "to the people" campaign of the 1870s is familiar to Slāvists, the</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 351 Georgians' particular challenge of reaching out to and embracing Oriental or Ottoman regions of Georgia newly conquered by the Russians may present some difficulty to the reader less fa- miliar with the various ethnic regions and histories of Georgia. For Georgian patriots, "Ottoman Georgia," or Ajaría (including Batumi), Ardahan, and Kars, was part of ancient Georgia, the home of Shota Rustaveli and Queen Tamar, and the Ottomans residing in those areas were at heart "true Georgians." The hope of reuniting ancient Georgian lands into a new nation inspired by the imagined community of an Occidental reading public and an expanded circulation of texts was soon to be shattered. Manning frames his discussion of relevant Georgian travel and ethnographic writings using two core texts: Ilia Chavchavadze's Letters of a Traveler (1861-1871) and Solomon Aslanishvili- Bavreli's Correspondence from Ottoman Georgia. Both authors devote themselves to ethno- graphic descriptions of "the people" written for their imagined readership, or "Occidentalized reading public," but the outcomes of their attempts to embrace an as-yet "Oriental geography" are very different for these Georgian patriots. While the gradual inscription and incorporation of Georgian mountaineers into the Georgian national imaginary will continue after Chavchavadze's initial work, the perhaps naïve excitement of welcoming their "Ottoman Geor- gian brothers with common ancestors" back into the Georgian fold after the Russian victory against the Ottomans in 1878 fails to halt a muxajirat (muhajirat) or mass migration (over 200,000 souls, according to Manning) from the "newly conquered Georgian lands," now inside Russia, to Ottoman-controlled areas. Although many Georgian contemporaries and historians blame Georgian aristocratic naïveté for privileging "ancient ethnic and linguistic affinities" over the religious identity of the previ- ous two centuries for this mass exit, there was certainly another "elephant in the room" in this case: the Russian Empire. At a formal banquet (supra) organized to welcome their "long-lost brothers" back into the fold, Georgian aristocrats devoted the first three of five toasts to the tsar, the Russian viceroy, and the people of Russia, postponing tributes to "our long-lost brothers" and "our common ancestors" to the last two toasts. Given that the first toast at a Georgian supra is addressed to the occasion at hand, it is telling that the Georgian aristocrats opened with an acknowledgement of their gratitude toward Russian Imperial Power, a gratitude that many of the Georgian Ottomans did not share. The book would benefit from some editing. One notes numerous omissions and repetitions. A number of discussions could be compressed. There are some over-simplifications (usually ac- knowledged in the footnotes) of factual data employed in order to match a binary, such as urban vs. rural, or Eastern vs. Western Georgia. There is a tendency throughout to use a single very specific text or event as the basis for generalization. Some assumptions about intertextuality are based on supposition (who had read what, for example). Concrete illustrations are often post- poned, leaving the reader anxious for an example or phenomenological proof. Nevertheless, the book promises to play a key role in the further development of Caucasian and Georgian studies, and it opens new territories for exploration and investigation by a hope- fully expanded reading public or "imagined community of scholars." Particularly relevant here, Manning makes a major contribution by demonstrating how Georgians themselves put to ques- tion many familiar tropes about the Caucasus stemming from the Russian "geopoetic and geopolitics" of Romantic poetry and literature, including the "imperial sublime" and the femi- nization of Orthodox Georgia as the "oriental beauty." The book offers some delightful passages for the philologist and perhaps a new relationship with the anthropologist, as in the description of the various moods of rivers (Terek for Chavchavadze, Chorokhi for Bavreli): phusiomorphic, zoomorphic, theriomorphic, or anthropomorphic (57). The eventual discovery of the identity of "the hero," Bavreli, with Manning's clever conclusion, "This book was not written to be a de- tective story, but it seems appropriate to end it as one" (287), is a delightful touch. Bavreli 's notes, observations, glosses, and vocabulary lists emerge as the work of a kind-hearted, gener- ous teacher, a "nobody in particular" yet a truly noble soul. The discussion of the feuilleton, a</page><page sequence="3">352 Slavic and East European Journal rich genre for both Russian and Georgian letters, opens doors to further study. The entrance of cryptologists, pseudonyms, cryptographs and cryptograms, and tricks of language to mask one's identity or class, to stump the censor or create a community of cognoscenti , with a complex se- ries of signs and Aesopian language (core features of the Georgian style in literature and film throughout the Soviet period) is great fun, while the sad tale of the supra of 1878 and the mux- ajirat haunts the Georgian national imaginary to this day.
