<plain_text><page sequence="1">"AT ONCE THE COPY,?AND THE ORIGINAL": RICHARD LEWIS'S "A JOURNEY FROM PATAPSCO TO ANNAPOLIS" PIERRE MARAMBAUD University of Nice Classifying writers, particularly from the influences that show through their works, can be a dangerous game. It may be an easy way to characterize them in a few words, but as soon as we get more familiar with them, the first impression thus created will often appear superficial. Sometimes it will even prove quite mis leading for a good understanding and evaluation of literary achievement. This commonplace is still worth repeating when we deal with American colonial literature. For many readers, Richard Lewis is "the American Thomson" just as William Byrd is "the American Pepys." To some people characterizing poetry thus may seem a good means to raise a writer to the level of his "model," but it is just as likely to carry some derogatory connotation, in spite of the amount of truth it may convey. George Sherburn saw in "A Journey from Patapsco to Annap olis, April 4, 1730" a surprisingly early imitation of James Thom son's The Seasons, and called it "one of the best poems of its day in America" (601). J. A. Leo Lemay, endorsing this judgment, added that Lewis echoes Addison, Gay, "and doubtless owes something to Pope, Milton, and perhaps even to Chaucer. But his language and subject matter are closest to Thomson" (148). This, of course, is so evident as to hide perhaps other characteristics which may prove just as interesting for a final judgment. After all, even the most original mind cannot be free from a host of influ ences, however unsuspected. Our aim here, then, will be neither to stress nor to deny any imitation, but to show how Lewis departed from his models to make the achievement his own. As Pope had said in An Essay on Criticism a few years before, 138</page><page sequence="2">Richard Lewis's "Journey 139 In every work regard the writer's End, Since none can compass more than they intend. (Lines 255? 56) Perhaps it would help, at the start, to classify the various types of influences that can be detected in Lewis's poem. The first kind usually thought of?that is, the personal influence of individual writers?is shown by direct imitation. There is no doubt that the name of Thomson is the first to come to mind. And yet, that impression may well be partly due to the particular genre that he represented, and that is the second kind of influence. For Thom son was in his time the best exponent of natural description, or the poetry of nature. But this was the continuation of the pastoral, the neoclassic counterpart of the georgic in ancient times; and here Virgil is certainly as much in evidence as Thomson (Chalker pas sim). Besides that of writers and genres, a third kind of influence would cover the realm of literary technique, and its two major aspects were then poetic diction, or the elevated style whose exem plars in fact are far more numerous in Milton's or Dryden's works than in Thomson's (Arthos 356-92), and the heroic couplet of Dryden or Pope, whom Thomson did not follow in this respect. The last kind might be found in contemporary themes, in the favorite themes of the Augustans, which, besides demonstrating a new interest in nature, included an interest in science and a belief in progress, as well as a still strongly religious turn of mind (al though by this time it was sometimes tinged with deism or at least with what came to be termed natural religion). While thus trying to recapture something of the spirit of the times, it might be wise to recall a theory that Richard Lewis knew very well, since he alluded to it in his own preface to his transla tion of Holdsworth's Latin poem Muscipula: Dryden's statement on the three grades of translation. After "metaphrase, or turning an author word by word and line by line," and "paraphrase, or translation with latitude," Dryden, following earlier writers, con siders a third way: "that of imitation, where the translator (if now he has not lost that name) assumes the liberty, not only to vary from the words and sense, but to forsake them both as he sees occasion; and taking only some general hints from the original, to run division on the groundwork, as he pleases" (1:237). This is indeed the kind of imitation that Richard Lewis had in mind, feeling free either to remember or to forget his models at any time. Thomson's natural description is but a starting point for the narrative of Lewis's short journey. Virgil furnishes Lewis</page><page sequence="3">140 Early American Literature, Volume XIX, 1984 first with an epigraph, and then with constant memories of lines known by heart in Latin by all educated contemporaries. Poetic diction and the heroic couplet are an essential part of Augustan poetry; and the subject, in Lewis's own way, reconciles nature and religious feeling, and, unlike with Thomson, gives only passing hints at science and progress. The epigraph from Virgil's second G?orgie is a very apt quota tion, a clear indication of Lewis's aim. It prepares us for a poem in which a view of the countryside will show the poet the pathways of the sky and the stars, and make him the priest of the Muses (and so of God). The first few lines create the atmosphere of an "imitation" of Thomson, in Dryden's sense: the allusion to "win try horrors" borrowed from the beginning of the 1726 version of "Winter" is followed by five lines with a most Thomsonian vo cabulary from the beginning of "Spring," where no precise quota tion could be pinpointed but where everything suggests that we are reading some passage from The Seasons. The setting is clearly an English georgic, Thomsonian nature poetry, a "pastoral" that becomes more of a "landscape." But if, on a second reading of "A Journey from Patapsco to Annapolis," we try to analyze the structure of the poem, differ ences begin to show. Thomson's The Seasons may have some kind of unity, but it evinces no definite plan: it is made up of rambling, desultory poems, offering variety and contrast, in a loose pattern, with natural description and moral or religious musing fused all along. Not so with Lewis: even the simplest analysis makes it clear that two-thirds of the poem are devoted to nature, and the last third to the ensuing prayer. A closer study is still more convincing. Within the pattern of a one-day journey, the first two parts present in contrast the pleasant aspects of nature, culminating in the de scription of the hummingbird (1-134), and its darker aspects, cli maxing in the thunderstorm (135-250). The third part (251-390) is nothing but another diptych, a smaller one, devoted to the rela tionship between man and God. Nature, with the coming of night and a view of "the vaulted sky" (242), appears as an occasion for the poet's musings on his own kind, on himself, on his past and future life, and the poet's concluding in a prayer to God after a brief interlude of a few lines (329-35) that glimpse the journey's end. This no longer looks like anything from The Seasons, and the comment that prefaced "A Journey" when it was first published in the Pennsylvania Gazette, besides calling it "an agreeable Descrip</page><page sequence="4">Richard Lewis's "Journey" 141 tion of the Spring in these Parts of America,9" rightfully insists on "the religious Turn given the whole."1 There is no return to natu ral description in the third and longest part of the poem, and the last four lines offer a clear picture of what Lewis had in mind: Whatever State thou shalt for me ordain, Whether my Lot in Life be Joy or Pain; Patient let me sustain thy wise Decree, And learn to know myself, and honour Thee. (387-90) "Joy," "Pain," "myself," and "Thee" (that is, man and God) are the key words: joy and pain, which govern nature as they do man's life, must teach the man to worship God. Unlike Thomson, Richard Lewis wrote a very carefully built poem, in which natural description leads to religious musing in a regular ascent of the mind, a movement that is clearly marked in the text: From earthly Objects I remove mine Eye, And view with Look erect the vaulted Sky. (241-42) But in good poetry, Pope said in An Essay on Criticism, "All comes united to th' admiring eyes" (250), and this is a lesson that Lewis has learned. He uses poetic technique as well as structure toward the same end, which takes him away from Thomson. In stead of using the blank verse of The Seasons, the Marylander prefers the heroic couplet, although he does not follow some of Pope's advice. Pope in his 1706 letter to William Walsh criticized the frequent use of the triplet or the alexandrine among couplets (Correspondence, 1:22?25). On the other hand, Dryden had often used both for special purposes, particularly to make the verse more ample and majestic, or to emphasize some important idea. This was the example that Lewis followed, using not the alexan drine but the triplet, as aptly and skillfully as Dryden did, and even more frequently than his great English predecessor.2 The thirteen examples in "A Journey," although in decreasing fre quency from beginning to end, are all used in justifiable places. The first (3-5) comes immediately after the initial couplet and sets the "vernal" theme with suitable majesty, while the second (38-40) draws attention in advance to the poet's aim in the last part to write in praise of his Creator. The third (51-53) empha sizes the presence of man, "the monarch-swain," in nature, and the next three underscore the essential ideas in this first part of</page><page sequence="5">142 Early American Literature, Volume XIX, 1984 fruitfulness (60?62), beauty symbolized by the hummingbird (93? 95), and the freshness of the new leaves in spring (126?28). In all cases except the first, Lewis aims at insistence rather than majesty. The use of this poetic device in the second part is similar, though less frequent (only four times). One opens the passage and announces the impending change (135-37), while the next marks the climax of the thunderstorm (160-62). The third indicates a new turn of events, both in the traveler's feelings and in his jour ney (199-201), with new "delights" and the ascent of a mount, already directing the mind toward the sky, the hawk that towers there, which is an impression confirmed by the fourth (232?34), which marks the end of day, the end of terrestrial sights as evening leaves the world to darkness. Both majesty and insistence come into play here. The last part contains only three triplets, but again they do not occur at random. The first two come almost in succession, just in the middle, between the poet's musings on man and his final prayer (331-33 and 338-40). They bracket the brief allusion to the final boat trip to Annapolis. Each ends with words to be set off, "my Journey's End" and "struck with amaze I cry"; but taken together they form a strong transition to, and almost detach, the address to God, giving it an importance and a solemnity that Lewis certainly meant to stress. This was so much so that we may wonder about the symbolic value that could be ascribed to the boat trip: it may well be meant as a parallel to the crossing of the Acheron in ancient mythology, but could not, without a breach of taste, be insisted upon in a Christian context. As for the last triplet (384?86), it punctuates the solemn conclusion of Lewis's invoca tion to God just before the last two couplets that sum up the poem. In "A Journey" then, Lewis used the triplet most consciously and effectively as a device meant to set off at once the structure, the main ideas, and the whole movement of the poem, confirming the previous structural study at the same time that it shows the personal use made of a poetic implement borrowed from Dryden more than anyone else. On the other hand, the vocabulary of "A Journey" not unnatu rally evokes Thomson, since Lewis's subject, at least in the first two-thirds, was the same as his great English contemporary's. But was the handling of the words typically Thomsonian, or more generally Augustan?</page><page sequence="6">Richard Lewis's "Journey 143 What in the first lines was undoubtedly imitative of Thomson soon seems to become vaguer and vaguer, and to be due to the vocabulary of spring common to both poets, a vocabulary ex pressing joy, light, growth, and abundance. Lewis does not handle it less skillfully, and it could not be called parody. A repeated word will appear in various contexts, each use reinforced by the next, building a careful gradation; for instance, "shine" is first applied to the "pale" rays of the moon (16), then to the sun (23), then to that nearer source of growth in nature, dew (46), and finally to the health of man (56); meanwhile "bright," "glow," "lustre," "ray," "beam," or words to the same effect strengthen the general im pression. Everything is "grateful" (3), "chearful" (29, 50, 75), or "joyful" (30); and of course there is "smiling Plenty" (55), as in Thomson's "Spring" there is "smiling Nature" (6, line 84). But then, as Geoffrey Tillotson noted, "smiling" is not necessarily a Thomsonian term: "A common word in eighteenth-century pas toral, [it] may be considered the equivalent of laetus (joyous, abundant, etc.) which Virgil constantly applied to crops" (37). Lewis is not averse to using close repetition for insistence, as he does with "toil/toils" (59-60) and "fruits/fruitful" (63-64), one being the result of the other. He will even add to repetition the effect of the rhyme and alliteration to mark the importance of dew as a sort of symbol of spring life: The Trees, emerging, rear their dewy Heads; Their dewy Heads the Sun with Pleasure views, And brightens into Pearls the pendent Dews. (25?27) The difference, even in the use of vocabulary, increases between the two poets when we come to Lewis's description of singing birds: The Birds delighted to the Grove repair: On every Tree behold a tuneful Throng, The vocal Vallies echo to their Song. (70?72) There is no need here to quote the whole passage; it is enough to mention its swarm of near synonyms: song, music, quire (choir), warbling, songsters, chirping, sing, strain, cooes, musician, song notes (70-90). Their number in proportion is still greater than in Thomson's parallel (and longer) section of "Spring" (25-27, lines 576-630), because the English poet sees that singing is "the soul of love," while the Marylander means to contrast a feast for the ear with one for the eye, which he represents by the humming</page><page sequence="7">144 Early American Literature, Volume XIX, 1984 bird. And here it seems rather unfair to Lewis to compare his sensuous description of "a living Rainbow" (113) with Thomson's four lines on the hornet (228, lines 23-26) or with Robert Bever ley's very short and factual picture of the hummingbird in a Vir ginian garden: "Your eyes will be saluted with the charming col ours of the Humming Bird, which revels among the Flowers, and licks off the Dew and Honey from their tender Leaves, on which it only feeds. It's size is not half so large as an English Wren, and its colour is a glorious shining mixture of Scarlet, Greenland Gold" (298-99). Lewis's lines are immeasurably superior, with their dis play of colors, swift changing on the swift-moving bird: My Ear thus charm'd, mine Eye with Pleasure sees, Hov'ring about the Flow'rs the industrious Bees: Like them in Size, the Humming-Bird I view, Like them He sucks his Food, the Honey Dew, \ With nimble Tongue, and Beak of jetty Hue. He takes with rapid Whirl his noisy Flight, His gemmy Plumage strikes the Gazer's Sight; And as he moves his ever-flutt'ring Wings, Ten thousand Colours he around him flings. Now I behold the Em'rald's vivid Green, Now scarlet, now a purple Die is seen; In brightest Blue, his Breast He now arrays, Then strait his Plumes emit a golden Blaze. Thus whirring round he flies, and varying still He mocks the Poefs and the Painter's Skill; Who may forever strive with fruitless Pains, To catch and fix those beauteous changeful Stains; While Scarlet now, and now the Purple shines; And Gold, to Blue its transient Gloss resigns. Each quits, and quickly each resumes its Place, And ever-varying Dies each other chase. Smallest of Birds, what Beauties shine in thee! A living Rainbow on thy Breast I see. (91-113) Rivaling the phoenix of ancient times, this is a new king of "the feath'ry kind." Richard Lewis uses poetic diction as carefully as any early Augustan poet did before it became the mechanical or nament instinctively used by later imitators of Milton, Dryden, and Thomson. Lewis knows when to use the ordinary word "bird" (70, 78), and when to prefer the anthropomorphic periph rasis which stresses one characteristic of special interest in the</page><page sequence="8">Richard Lewis's "Journey" 145 description: the "tuneful throng" (71)3 to introduce the singing birds assembled in a choir, "the feath'ry kind" (88) before turning to the hummingbird and the beauty of his "gemmy plumage," or again later "the plumy people" (237) wrapped in their protective cover when they retire to their nests at night.4 Here color and movement are emphasized and fused in one single impression summed up in the symbolic rainbow with its suggestive echoes of the new science, which interested educated colonists no less than their English counterparts. Lewis can use poetic devices as skillfully as the best among his English neoclassic models. Lemay pointed out a good example of his use of metrical effects when describing Patapsco River (139), the heavy, slowed-down rhythm produced by an extra stress and emphasized by alliteration in "r" following an accumulation of fast-flowing sibilant sounds and an "incipient" or "silent" stress in the preceding line (on a normally unstressed word): From whence he rushes with resistless Force, Tho' huge rough Rocks retard his rapid Course. (10?11) Lewis knew the lesson that Pope reminded poets of in his Essay on Criticism, that "The sound must seem an echo to the sense," and he will, for instance, use the alliteration of a plosive "b" to suggest the sudden awakening of animals: Sleep seals their Eyes, Till Hunger breaks the Bond and bids them rise. (32-33) But as well as the picture of the hummingbird, another purple passage of the poem can illustrate Lewis's use of most rhythmical effects: his description of the thunderstorm, which for our pur pose might be restricted to its climactic part: Hark how the Thunder rolls with solemn Sound! And see the forceful Lightning darts a Wound On yon tall Oak!?behold its Top laid bare! Its Body rent, and scatter'd thro' the air, The Splinters fly!?now?now the Winds arise, From different Quarters of the lowring Skies; Forth issuing fierce, the West and South engage, The waving Forest bends beneath their Rage: But where the winding Valley checks their Course, They roar and ravage with redoubled Force; With circling Sweep in dreadful Whirlwinds move,</page><page sequence="9">146 Early American Literature, Volume XIX, 1984 And from its Roots tear up the gloomy Grove; Down-rushing fall the Trees, and beat the Ground,} In Fragments fly the shatter'd Limbs around, &gt; Tremble the Underwoods, the Vales resound. ) (148-62) It will be noticed how Lewis most naturally introduces in the first line the bursting effect of the initial stress to draw attention to the dramatic change, and follows it with the solemn regularity of two lines and the lengthening of an enjambment all the more striking because it comes at the end of a couplet, thus making it an open one. This is amplified by the heaviness of added beats twice in line 150, and then in lines 152 and 154, the roughness of the rhythm intensifying the impression of chaos, with lightning and hail, whirlwinds and destruction. The climax of the storm, an nounced by the "r" alliteration in line 157 prolonged by assonan tic effect in the next line, comes with the triplet echoing the long slow crash of trees. Not only is "down-rushing" a typical Augus tan compound adjective: to the heaviness of initial supplementary stress is soon added the lengthening of the triplet and the balanc ing of chiasmus.5 But already the flowing effect of the "f" alliteration (161) an nounces the impending decline of the storm into rain. The rhythm becomes more regular again (168, 169, 174). The suddenness of the sun's return is marked at once by initial stress and a "b" alliteration: Bursts the broad Sun, triumphant in a Blaze Too keen for Sight?Yon Cloud refracts his Rays. (175?76) Then come more regular lines, with only one initial stress to avoid monotony (177-80). There is nothing here in the harmony of sense and sound that could not have been signed by any of the best Augustan poets, or by Dryden before fhem. The concluding philosophical remark about short-lived beauty is a typical sententia, as Lemay observes, "a common device in Augustan poetry" (143). But here it also comes as a reminder that everything fades, joy or pain, and as a harbinger of the "musing" to follow in the third part of the poem. Similar examples might be found even in what would now be judged more didactic and conventional, therefore less valuable. There Lewis weaves together the poet's journey and the journey of life, on a backdrop of contemporary science and religion which was always present in Augustan poetry, whether in Pope's Essay</page><page sequence="10">Richard Lewis's "Journey" 147 on Man or Thomson's The Seasons. But already enough has been given to claim for "A Journey from Patapsco to Annapolis" the quality of good neoclassic poetry, far above mere imitation. Lew is's contemporaries did not judge otherwise, since the poem soon appeared in the best English magazines, five times in two years (1732-33). Some readers or critics might object that the didacticism so common in eighteenth-century poetry is responsible for much dead wood in Lewis's poem. Even Thomson's didactic portions at all times have been diversely judged. Nearly a century ago, Wil liam Bayne felt that they were not the best part of his art, and that their main quality was to create "an appropriate sequence of pauses in the general narrative" (114). On the other hand, Patricia Spacks recently observed that in Thomson nature is subordinated to human values and "description occupies a place subsidiary to that of the moralizing which it introduces" (114). And yet, she acknowledged in another occasion, "all too often ... reflection on Shaftesbury's themes seems to lead Thomson into using nature merely as a minor pretext for digression, or even into neglecting it altogether" (147). No such criticism can be addressed to Lewis, insofar as nature is here openly used as a source of further moral and religious reflection. But the question is: did the poet keep the necessary balance and harmony between his two themes even to the end? and, if so, how? When night turns the traveler's attention from the visible world around him to other bright but mysterious ones in the sky, Lewis evokes the usual speculations of the new science: Are these bright Luminaries hung on high Only to please with twinkling Rays our Eye? Or may we rather count each Star a Sun, Round which full peopled Worlds their Courses run? Orb above Orb harmoniously they steer Their various Voyages thro' Seas of Air. (251-56) The following lines, referring to those high Abodes, The Seats perhaps of Saints and Demi-gods (257-58) where after their deaths are found patriots, priests, poets, and philosophers, may well be the most conventional catalogue in the poem, as Lemay says (145), but they still poetically conciliate the Christian heaven and the belief of contemporary science that per</page><page sequence="11">148 Early American Literature, Volume XIX, 1984 haps "these Orbs" may not be as empty as they look to man's eyes. This wide universe, "turning inward" the poet's "reflective View" (282), leads his thoughts toward the far more traditional development on the ages of man. But here again the subject is treated in a particular way: it is the personal view (although gen eralized as in pre-Romantic times) of the thirty-year-old man that Lewis was then, in which life from infancy to maturity is likened to nature, showing childhood going "In Life's fair Morning thro' a flowry Way" (290), and, later, youth, in "Learning's mazy Wood" whose trees "Are often bare of Fruit, and only fill'd with Leaves" (294). Clearly, nature here has become a mere ornament for thought, but in the parallel carefully maintained it keeps the value of an image and a symbol in the midst of man's destiny. The parallel is pursued in the evocation of future life, "Oh! may its coming Stage from Storms be free!" (312). At the same time the poem expresses the wishes usual in the eighteenth-century pas toral under the influence of Virgil and Horace: Freed from Necessity, and blest with Health, Give me Content, let others toil for Wealth: In busy scenes of Life let me exert A careful Hand, and wear an honest Heart; And suffer me my leisure Hours to spend, With chosen Books, or a well-natur'd Friend, Thus journeying on, as I advance in Age, May I look back with Pleasure on my Stage. (317-24) With the theme of the journey thus reintroduced, and after a men tion of "th' Approach of Death" (328), comes the significant tran sition already alluded to, whose least use is to evoke the journey's end, and whose main one is to set off the concluding prayer. Founded on all that has come before, this invocation to God unfolds in several movements: at first, doubts about immortality because the contemplation of the immensity of nature has in creased consciousness of man's insignificance in a universe that the new science no longer centers in his planet; but soon, strength ened by the thought that the Creator's work cannot be useless and that the capacity to think "Could never be bestow'd on Man in vain" (377), faith brings the poet both to an awareness of the distance between man and his Creator and to a humble accep tance of his fate decreed by God. The use of the major currents of contemporary thought, in fact, seems to have contributed to making Lewis's poem something</page><page sequence="12">Richard Lewis's "Journey 149 more than pure natural description, and something different from The Seasons both in scope and in the development of accompany ing thought. Yet another claim to originality, of course, lies in the American treatment of the theme of nature in the poem. Lewis's extended description of native flowers and his native birds have often been mentioned as the first of the sort in American poetry. This is perhaps where a comparison between Thomson and Lewis may be most fruitful, with a standpoint emphasizing differences. For instance, what of the parallel between Thomson's (lines 576-630) and Lewis's (lines 70-119) pictures of birds in spring? These sections of about fifty lines each are more than passing allusions, and it is interesting to see how the two poets dealt with their subject. Outwardly, both pictures are idyllic pastoral scenes based on the description of singing birds. But once this has been said it must be noted that the reflective mood of the hearer is different. For Thomson, "the symphony of Spring" is an expres sion of "the soul of love," whether coming from the lark, the thrush, the linnet, or the bullfinch. Spring is the season of love. Mentioning "the glossy kind" is as far as Thomson goes in show ing the importance of glossy plumage for mating. Lewis also be gins with the presentation of "a tuneful Throng" (71), but his favorite is the American mockingbird, And he, alone, is equal to the Quire Of warbling Songsters who around him play. (78?79) And soon the Marylander turns from the pleasure of the ear to the pleasure of the eye?to the many-hued plumage of the humming bird, taken as the most beautiful among so many other American representatives of "the feath'ry Kind." The variety of their bright colors struck the early colonists most, and for Lewis beauty in song and plumage betokens the perfection of God's works (314, 358). The ends are similar, although not identical: Thomson's is more moral, Lewis's is more religious. The means are different: love for one, beauty for the other. Besides, Lewis is fascinated by American aspects of nature. Another parallel, a shorter one, might be found in the evocation of Thomson's eagle (31-32, lines 755-65) and Lewis's hawk (lines 206?13). There a difference between the personalities of the two poets shows. Thomson's sentimentality, already obvious in the passage denouncing the cruelty of people who imprison singing</page><page sequence="13">150 Early American Literature, Volume XIX, 1984 birds in cages (29-30, lines 702-05), appears just as clearly here: spring is the season when "the royal eagle" flies away from the Hebrides to "Indian worlds" and "preys in distant isles." Any kind of violence is conveniently blurred by remoteness. Lewis's hawk is openly, and by nature, a preying bird, appearing in that quality when "Down dropping from on high, / He strikes the Fish, and bears him thro' the Sky" (210-11). It is quite fit that the hawk should come, not as part of the pleasures of spring, but in the second half of the natural description, just after the storm, among the darker sights of spring, those that are not pure "pain" but show, as William Blake was to say later in "Augeries of Inno cence," that Joy and woe are woven fine, A clothing for the soul divine. (172) And when Lewis pictures the Hawk, who with acute Survey, Tow'ring in Air predestinates his Prey Amid the Floods,... (208?10), the keyword indeed, as Lemay observes (143), is "predestinates," which foreshadows the ulterior reflections on life and death and immortality, the insignificance of man and beast subject to the "wise Decree" of an "omniscient God." But again, at the same time, it appears as a more localized scene set on the shores of the Chesapeake. This American coloring of Lewis's poem is just as noticeable in the description of the thunderstorm (lines 148?80) as compared with Thomson's (92?95, lines 1103?68).6 It is not just that the kind of storm set by the English poet in the northern mountains of Britain in summer will in the warmer climates of the Chesapeake occur in early spring. There is a difference in kind. Thomson's storm comes slowly: Behold, slow-settling o'er the lurid grove Unusual darkness broods, and, growing, gains The full possession of the sky... And it is interrupted at its climax, when the poet turns to the "inward storm" of Celadon and Amelia's sad pastoral tale. Lewis, on the other hand, carefully describes the successive moods of the swift-coming, violent, and short storm, soon followed by "a new Scene of Pleasures," exemplifying the brevity of all things, the</page><page sequence="14">Richard Lewis's "Journey" 151 incessant mixture of joy and pain, but also contrasting British and American natural scenes. Of course, part of the difference between the two poets' achievement originates in the length and scope of their respective works. Thomson, dealing with the four seasons, naturally finds a winter's evening the most favorable time for meditation,7 whereas Lewis, in the frame of a one-day journey in early spring, finds nightfall to be the best time. But the American, while writing the same sort of nature poetry as Thomson, does not mix his views of nature all along with morality and religious feeling, but instead uses descriptive poetry to announce and lead to philosophical re flections. This is done in a far more purposefully and clearly struc tured poem, one less given to rambling imagination. It certainly shows the influence of Thomson, and of others such as Milton or Dryden, but it also betrays the personality of the author. Beyond all influences, it is good Augustan poetry, with an unmistakably American overtone, both in the choice of subjects for description and in the strongly religious purpose of the whole. Like the mock ingbird among other birds, it is indeed, in Lewis's own words, "At once the Copy,?and the Original" (90). NOTES i. May 20, 1731.
