<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE ROCK ART OF NORTH AMERICA-SOME IMPRESSIONS AND COMPARISONS A. R. WILLCOX This paper results from a 32 000 km lecture and study tour of North America during which many rock-art sites were visited from Nova Scotia to southern California, and the opportunity taken for discussions with authorities and to survey the relevant literature. Distribution (see map, fig. 1) Prehistoric rock art is found in the Americas from Alaska to southern Patagonia. In North America a very large percentage is located west of the Rocky Mountains with the density falling off markedly towards the east. There are approximately 15 000 rock-art sites in the western United States and, in contrast, only about 200 east of the Mississippi. This distribution apparently reflects, not the density of population or of peoples with art traditions, but simply the extent of exposure of rock surfaces which are found in abundance west of the Rockies and are comparatively infrequent eastwards. Only in small areas is the rock-art limited to paintings or petroglyphs only; in the larger art areas both techniques are found but always with one or the other greatly predominating. In the latter areas the kinds of rock apparently determined which technique would be employed, paintings being usually on granite or sandstone, and the petroglyphs on rr \~~ 17X MORE THAN SO AINTING6S DITTO PETRIOLYPHS El Fig. 1. highly patinated igneous rocks especially basalt. This parallels the situation in southern Africa where almost all the paintings are on sandstone and granite and almost all the petroglyphs on diabase and dolerite. But the geographical segregation of the two basic art techniques found in South Africa does not occur in North America, except in some areas where only the 'paintable' or the 'carvable' rock is found. Description and Classification Unfortunately the authorities on the different rock- art areas of North America do not use the same descriptive terms, so it is difficult to make comparisons between the various areas and to make quantitative estimates. It is however quite certain that petroglyphs out- number rock-paintings (called pictographs in America) probably by more than 10 to 1. There are very few painted petroglyphs. Although the propor- tions vary greatly in the different art regions, in North America as a whole non-representational glyphs or paintings, which must include many representations not identified, greatly preponderate over representa- tional art. Rough estimates in this respect are as follows: Area Percentage Percentage Representational Non-representational 1 50 50 2 70 30 3 50 50 4 90 10 5,6 30 70 7 20 80 8 50 50 9 90 10 10 90 10 At first sight the above table may seem to show a greater proportion of representational art, but as probably over 90% of all prehistoric art in North America is in areas 5 and 6 where the non-representa- tional greatly predominates it is estimated that the incidence of non-representational art is at least double that of representational. This is in marked contrast to the situation in South Africa where the proportions of representational to non-representational are esti- mated to be about 90% to 10% in the case of petro- glyphs, and about 95% to 5% for rock-paintings, giving a proportion of about 94% to 6 % for the art as a whole. All the above figures are rough approxi- mations. Representational art is on the whole commoner in the paintings than among the petroglyphs, the most striking exception being the intricate circle motifs of the Chumash. The reason for the anomaly might lie in the suggestion by Campbell Grant that the Chu- 27 S. Afr. archaeol. Bull. 28: 27-31</page><page sequence="2">mash work was done under the influence of hallucino- genic drugs such as Jimson weed (Datura inoxia). There is supporting experimental evidence that, if the visual cortex is stimulated by migraine attacks (Richards 1971), or by means of electrodes attached to the scalp (Kellogg, Knoll &amp; Kugler 1965), forms somewhat similar to the Chumash motifs are 'seen' by the subjects. It would be interesting to have some experiments to compare drawings made under the influence of Jimson weed with Chumash work. Newcomb has speculated regarding the possible use of another drug contained in the Texas mountain laurel or mescal bean (Sophora secundiflora) by the Pecos River Indians of area 8 and its effects on their art. As subjects in the representational art, or at least among that which is recognizably so, human and anthropomorphic figures, animals and hands-which must be included among the representational-form the larger part. Plant forms are rare as in South Africa. Of the animal representations only a very small pro- portion are 'naturalistic' as we would use the term to describe animals in Palaeolithic European or Bushman art; by far the larger part being conventionalized or schematic in varying degrees. For example there are only about six 'naturalistic' paintings of animals in area 2 and according to Selwyn Dewdney, the leading authority, 'Out of 35 drawings of cervids barely half show sufficient interest in the subject to reveal whether they are deer, moose, elk or caribou'. In the U.S.A. the proportion of 'naturalistic' repre- sentations of animals is even lower. In areas 5 and 6 the mountain or Bighorn sheep is the animal most frequently depicted, indeed there must be many thou- sands of them, but it is doubtful if any should be described as 'naturalistic'. All show some degree of conventionalization and a large proportion of them show the body as rectangular or boat-shaped. There are a few 'naturalistic' animal paintings in areas 8 and 9. Again considering North America as a whole the most widespread motif is probably the hand repre- sentation, but the most numerous elements undoubtedly are the geometrical forms, e.g. circles, single or grouped, or subdivided in various ways, which are especially common among the petroglyphs of the Great Basin. Also widespread are pictures of the 'thunderbird', which are found from the Canadian Great Lakes down to southern California; paintings and petroglyphs of bear tracks, and representations of the plumed or horned snake which of course appears commonly as Quetzal-coatl, Kukulcan, and under other names in the art of the Toltecs, Aztecs and Maya. The Artists In only a few cases can the authorship of rock art be pinned down on specific tribes, for example the art of area 1 to the Micmac Indians, that of the interior of British Colombia to the Salish and the paintings of area 7 to the Chumash, Luiseho and Yakuts. Some art in area 6 was the work of Navaho. There seems to be no doubt that the art of area 2 can be ascribed to a group of tribes called Algonquians and that of areas 5 and 6 to another group the Sho- shonians. All these peoples, except latterly the Navaho who farmed, were hunters and food gatherers and the artists of area 3 mainly fishermen, dependent on salmon runs, so only a very small proportion of the art, i.e. that of the south-western area adjoining Mexico, is attributable to agriculturists. This being so, it is all the stranger that the animal paintings and petroglyphs are so very seldom anything like naturalis- tic; are in fact very poor representations, at least by Bushman standards. Dating Dating rock art has presented the same difficulties in North America as it has in Africa. I can find in the literature no cases where C14 dated material can be securely linked with rock art. In some cases objects which can be dated within limits indicate the maxi- mum or minimum age of their appearance in rock art. Most useful among these has been the spear-thrower, the atlatl, which is common in the petroglyphs of the Great Basin, especially in the Coso Range. This weapon was gradually supplanted by the bow from about 500 B.C. in this region. Its appearance in paint- ings of the Pecos River (area 8) also affords dating evidence as the bow was introduced there some time between A.D. 600 and 1000. Dating the beginning of rock art in this area can only be guesswork at present. None of the extinct fauna, e.g. Bison antiquus which disappeared about 5000 B.C. and the mammoth, appears to be represented, so the Palaeo-Indians can probably be ruled out. Newcomb sums up that the beginning might date from 'perhaps several millennia before the birth of Christ' and that the development of the art had run its course by A.D. 1000. By comparative patination and correlation with datable occupation levels in caves Heizer and Baum- hoff place the first rock art, the Pit-and-Groove petroglyphs, as from about 5000 B.C. continuing until about 3000 B.C. Regarding area 3 Mr Kenneth Kidd, after con- sideration of the extreme conditions of exposure to which the paintings (not in caves) have been subjected, thinks it improbable that any of the surviving art can be older than Late Woodland Culture (say A.D. 1200). It continued into historical times. Depiction of objects introduced by Europeans have been useful in dating late art and, as in South Africa, pictures of horses have enabled fairly precise datings to be made. The animals were reintroduced (there had been a Pleistocene horse which lasted until 5000 B.C.) from A.D. 1519 in Mexico, 1541 on the Great Plains, 1647 in Quebec, and 1775 in California. Some petroglyphs, especially in Canada, are par- tially covered with lichens and attempts are being made at dating based on the rate of growth of these organisms, which can be as much as 700 years old and grow as little as a fraction of a millimetre in 28</page><page sequence="3">diameter in a year. The growth rate, however, depends on many variables -species, type of rock, amount of light, annual temperature, rainfall, etc., and a great deal of work remains to be done before this method can be of much use. South African field workers also could usefully look out for large lichens covering paintings or petroglyphs. Steinbring &amp; Elias (1968) have used an ingenious method to determine the probable age of a rock- painting in Manitoba, which must have been painted from a canoe, by relating it to the water-level from which it would have been made and to the level of water which subsequently covered it partially: the date of the water-levels being arrived at by other means involving dendrochronology. The date arrived at was between A.D. 1000 and 1300. Meade has noted evidence that some of the petro- glyphs of area 3 made on rocks partly submerged in the sea were probably executed when sea-level at low tide was lower than now. He suggests about 2 000 years ago as the last time when this occurred. Petro- glyphs in this area continued to be made late enough to include sailing ships as subjects. Motives In North America as in southern Africa to arrive at the motives of the artists is very largely a matter of inference. There, as here, no one seems to have questioned the artists themselves while they were still around to be interrogated. The various authorities suggest different purposes but all agree that no single motive can account for all the art. Agreement is general also that much of it was executed there as part of shamanistic ritual to aid in obtaining desired things such as rain, fertility and good hunting. Opinions differ as to the importance of hunting magic in the motivation of the art, although it is certain that rituals generally preceded hunting and the hunts were even directed by hunt shamans. Dewdney sees no reason to believe that hunting magic played any part in the production of the art of area 2. The leading exponents of the hunting magic theory are Dr Robert Heizer and Dr Martin Baum- hoff, who have given much consideration to the ques- tion. They point out that the areas (my areas 5 and 6) where the rock art is most abundant are poor in food reserves, and therefore much of the inhabitants' time must have been devoted to food getting, and since the execution of such vast numbers of petroglyphs also required much time and effort, they argue that this activity also must have been part of the food-getting process. They point out also that the petroglyphs are much commoner on game migration routes, and the approaches to watering places where hunting would mostly be practised, than they are elsewhere in the region. I have some reservations in accepting this view. The relative frequency of the art where the game was likely to be concentrated might merely mean that the hunters also needed to live near water, and preferably also near game trails. Another objection is that, although the Bighorn sheep is very commonly depicted, glyphs of deer and antelope, which were undoubtedly also hunted, are extremely rare. More- over, one would expect the hunting magic motive to produce a greater proportion of representations of animals, whereas in this region non-representational work, largely geometrical, curvilinear and Pit-and- Groove, greatly predominates. And if magic, or at least sympathetic magic, was behind the production of the animal glyphs one would think that the effect would have been greater if the representations were more naturalistic. In other words the better the like- ness the better the spell. It has been pointed out by Campbell Grant that in southern Alberta, where enormous herds of buffalo roamed, depictions of this animal are almost non- existent, and along the Colombia River where the Indians depended on salmon as their main food supply, this fish was seldom represented. This seems true also of area 3 where salmon was also a chief protein source, although there are a few glyphs of fish. To account for this absence, or great rarity of animals and fish in the rock art of areas in which they were economically important, it has been suggested that they were so easy to hunt that the employment of magic was not necessary, and that this was only used where hunting was difficult, for example with the Bighorn sheep. It seems to me, nevertheless, that bearing in mind universal human nature, however easy their task was, the hunters and fishermen would have used any means they knew, or believed in, to make the hunting and fishing still easier. Speaking of the Pecos River style pictographs of area 8 Newcomb expresses little doubt that these 'were painted for magico-religious reasons and were probably part of ceremonial or cult activities'. It is well established that rock-paintings were made by the Salish of British Colombia and the Luiseiio Indians of southern California as part of elaborate puberty ceremonies. Other purposes suggested for some of the art are that it was made to record dreams and hallucinations, as tallies and time records, as records of events and as clan symbols. So many motives and purposes have been suggested as the raisons d'etre of rock art that I wonder whether scholars of Western cultures are not looking for too much rationality in the art of primitive people: for complex motives where the simple pleasure of the artist in creating or reproducing form, and in receiving the plaudits of his small community for his skill, are perhaps quite sufficient explanation. This, I think, is probably especially true of the simpler types of petroglyphs, occurring in their hundreds of thousands in areas 5 and 6 and less commonly elsewhere, for which no other explanation than 'doodling' seems to me adequate. Indigenous or imported Do the beginnings of rock art in America owe anything to the Old World? On the present evidence this seems unlikely. There 29</page><page sequence="4">is rock art of possibly Palaeolithic and of Mesolithic and later age near Lake Baikal in Central Siberia (Okladnikov 1969) but between this area and the nearest rock art in North America, on Kodiak Island, Alaska, there is, by the shortest land route and cross- ing the Bering Straits, a distance of well over 4 800 kilometres in which, so far, no prehistoric rock art has been found. Moreover the oldest rock art in America is at present believed to be not in the north- west but far to the south in the Great Basin of Nevada and California; and this is 'Pit-and-Groove' and 'Curvilinear Abstract', quite unlike the Siberian rock art. Nor do the Kodiak Island petroglyphs resemble those of Central Siberia. There is, however, some fairly persuasive evidence of a later connection between a group of Neolithic petroglyph sites on the Amur River of south-eastern Siberia, and the southern Alaskan, and British Columbian petroglyphs of area 3. In both regions very similar deeply carved mask-like conventionalized human faces, seldom showing the body, are common. Some of the faces, both on the Amur River and in area 3, have rays going from them sunburst fashion. The Kodiak Island petroglyphs are also of highly conventionalized faces with eyes, nose and mouth without a surrounding line. Such a connection is quite feasible. The Indians of the north-west coast, when first seen by Europeans, practised a Neolithic culture, and made with their stone tools canoes as large as 25 metres long, and 2,5 metres broad, which were thoroughly seaworthy craft, and by following the coasts and the Aleutian Island chain could have made the long journey almost never out of sight of land. It is tempting also to infer a connection between various sites in Canada and one of the Lake Baikal sites at which there are markedly similar glyphs of an obviously mythical animal (see fig. 2), but the links are too tenuous to be taken very seriously. It is possible, however, that these are independent depictions of the subject of a widespread myth. Some impressions and conclusions Anything like a thorough study of North American rock art would require a lifetime. My too brief study leaves me with two impressions especially, (1) its vast quantity and (2) its poor quality, both technically and artistically, when judged by the same standards which we apply to the prehistoric rock art of Europe and Africa. Nowhere do we find the sensitive line, delicate shading, perspective, foreshortening, accuracy of representation (especially of animals) and skill in depicting movement which is found in the best Bush- man art (Willcox 1963). The idea that the general family likeness to be seen in much of the rock art of Europe and Africa is simply because people in the same stage of culture automatically evolve the same kind of rock art receives, I think, its death blow. Nearly all the North American rock art was also the work of hunters and gatherers and differs in almost every respect, but most Fig. 2. notably in the virtual absence of naturalistic repre- sentations. This strengthens my belief that the resem- blances between the Palaeolithic and Mesolithic art of Europe and that of various parts of Africa resulted from diffusion of culture and cannot be explained by assuming independent invention in the several regions of the Old World (Willcox 1969). On the other hand the beginnings of art in the New World seem to have been autochthonous. There is, however, one kind of rock art which is found in North America as well as South Africa, north Italy, Hawaii and elsewhere (Willcox 1964; Willcox &amp; Pager 1967) and that is the non-representational art, mainly petroglyphs, consisting of simple geometrical forms such as circles, divided and combined, often with 'rays', and grids, and of amorphous outlines, wavy and zigzag lines, parallel lines, dashes, etc. I have pointed out in a previous paper (Willcox 1964) that all these elements occur in young children's art as analysed by Kellogg (Kellogg 1969) and others, before they grasp the idea of representation, and I suggested that the geometrical rock art was also the work, not of course of children, but of people in the 'young child' stage of artistic development. This receives confirmation from the sequence of styles in Nevada and eastern California as demonstrated by Heizer &amp; Baumhoff. There the progressive stages of children's art, dots, dashes, random curves and 30</page><page sequence="5">scribbles, geometrical shapes (especially circles) leading to pictorial art, is paralleled by the sequence Pit-and-Groove, Great Basin Curvilinear Abstract, Great Basin Rectilinear Abstract and Great Basin Representational, although the two latter stages are thought to be coeval. In making this brief survey I am heavily indebted to the publications listed hereunder and to some of the authors, especially Campbell Grant, Selwyn Dewdney, David Gebhard and Robert Heizer, who took my wife and me to various sites or arranged for guides and transport. Gerald Smith, Director of the San Bernadino County Museum, most kindly took us personally to sites in his district. From him and the enthusiasts mentioned above we received most gene- rous and congenial hospitality. But above all we are indebted to H. B. S. Cooke of Dalhousie University, an old friend, who took on his shoulders the great amount of preliminary work which made the tour possible. Principal Sources GRANT, C. Rock Art of the American Indian.
