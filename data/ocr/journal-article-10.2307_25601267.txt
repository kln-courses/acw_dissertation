<plain_text><page sequence="1">WILLIAM KEACH Cythna's Subtler Language THIS PAPER DERIVES FROM A LARGER PROJECT ON WOMEN, LANGUAGE, AND political agency in British romanticism. My focus here is on questions of language and political agency as they emerge not in women writers themselves, but in representations of women's access to?or exclusion from?verbal and political power in texts by male writers. The questions I am pursuing concern the contradictions and limits of what we might provisionally call "male feminism" as it was historically constituted (at least incipiently) during the romantic period?and the related but distinct issue of male writers' imagining themselves as, or in the condition of, women. The key text for the questions I want to explore is that remarkable scene of writing/reading in Canto 7 of Percy Shelley's The Revolt of Islam: Cythna's account of her discovering, in the midst of her isolated impris onment in a cave surrounded by the sea, a distinctive access to power or agency that is simultaneously verbal and political. Shelley's image of a woman transforming the conditions of confinement into possibilities of liberation raises difficult critical questions. What does it mean when Cythna says "'I resumed my ancient powers at length'" (7.28, 3075)?1 What is implied in the shift from her effort to communicate with the sea-eagle who brings her food " 'By intercourse of mutual imagery / Of objects' " (7.29, 3087?88), to that aggressively reflexive exploration in which her own mind takes the place of?explicitly displaces?the cave where she is confined: 'My mind became the book through which I grew Wise in all human wisdom, and its cave, Which like a mine I rifled through and through, To me the keeping of its secrets gave?' (7.31, 3100-3103) What does it mean for Cythna to extend her self-generated knowledge through an act of writing that registers liberating transformations worked from within, rather than from outside or on the borders of, existing i.

(7.32, 3109-12) And perhaps most important of all, why are the stanzas representing Cythna's account set off in quotation marks, unlike the stanzas belonging to Laon's self-narration? That these questions are profoundly linked to past and current debates about aesthetics and ideology in romantic writing may be suggested by recalling the title of Earl Wasserman's influential 1959 book, The Subtler Language. By substituting the definite article?at once restrictive and uni versalizing?for Cythna's multiple and open-ended indefinite "A"?" 'A subtler language' "?and especially by eliminating the phrase that situates Cythna's discovery of linguistic power within a larger sphere of discursive potentiality?" 'A subtler language within language' "?Wasserman appro priated Cythna's words on behalf of an ideology and an aesthetic for which he was a formidable advocate. There is, clearly, more to say about that appropriation. What I want to do here, however, is situate Shelley's and Cythna's scene of writing/reading in critical relation to two very different interpretive contexts, both of which throw into relief what is ideologically and aesthetically at stake in contending with this moment in a poem that Shelley originally subtitled "A Vision of the Nineteenth Century." The first of these contexts is historical and overtly political; it may be indicated by recalling Mary Wollstonecraft's challenge to the restrictive ideology of the French Revolution's Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen, and of the Constitution of 1791: ". . . if women are to be excluded, without having a voice, from a participation of the natural rights of mankind, prove first, that they want reason?else this flaw in your new constitution will ever show that man must, in some shape, act like a tyrant" (dedicatory letter to Talleyrand, Vindication of the Rights of Woman).3 The second context is theoretical and, because postmodern, more charac teristic of our own critical moment and more covertly and deflectedly political. It is the body of recent work that has explored the bearing of Lacanian and Lacan-influenced feminist accounts of language acquisition 2. See Spenser's Amoretti 75: 1-4: "One day I wrote her name upon the strand, / but came the waves and washed it away: / agayne I wrote it with a second hand, / but came the tyde, and made my paynes his pray" (Spenser: Poetical Works, ed.

What the first context?the historical and political one?enables us to see is that the figure of Cythna was in part produced out of Shelley's reading of Robert Southey's foan of Arc, and that Shelley's representation of Cythna's access to discursive and political power can be usefully under stood as a rethinking of Joan of Arc's relation to the voices of visionary prophecy in Southey's epic. That Shelley cared about this poem, written between 1793 and 1795 during Southey's hot pro-revolutionary youth? and with the substantial collaboration of Coleridge in the first edition dated 1796?should come as no surprise, given what Stuart Curran and more recently Marilyn Butler have shown about the influence on Shelley of later Southey works such as Thalaba the Destroyer (1801) and The Curse ofKehama (1811).4 Despite his political differences with Southey, which deepened into revulsion (for reasons analyzed years ago by Kenneth Cameron) during the very months of 1817 when Laon and Cythna was being written, Shelley continued to take Southey seriously as a poet.5 There are good reasons for thinking that Shelley's conversations with Southey at Keswick during December 1811 and January 1812 would have come back to him as he was writing a poem which, as he says in the Preface, aimed to counter the moral ruin and "infectious gloom" that had settled over most of the early supporters of the French Revolution. It was on 25 July 1811, five months before his visit to Southey, that Shelley ardently recommended foan of Arc to Elizabeth Hitchener.6 It is unclear whether Shelley had read Southey's epic in the first edition of 1796, the only one containing Coleridge's substantial contribution to the second book, or in the revised editions of 1798 or 1806. It is also unclear when Shelley would have read Coleridge's "The Destiny of Nations," which contains the lines he contributed to Southey's foan of Arc plus 148 additional lines on the subject that he published separately in the Morning Post on 26 December 1797: Shelley asked Oilier to send him a copy of Sybilline Leaves, where "The Destiny of Nations" first appeared, on 13 July 1817.7 What is clear is that Joan of Arc, one of the most ambitious attempts of the 1790s to address the French 4- See Stuart Curran, Poetic Form and British Romanticism (New York and Oxford: Oxford UP, 1986) 133-35; Marilyn Butler, "Revising the Canon," TLS (December 4-10, 1987): !349&gt; 1350-51, and "Repossessing the Past: the Case for an Open Literary History," Rethinking Historicism, intro.

Curran puts us in touch with the force of the nineteen-year-old Southey's ambitious enterprise, begun six months after the execution of Louis xvi and seven months after England declared war on the French Republic. "Everything about the poem projects an image of the enfant terrible . . . Southey went out of his way to ensure it," he writes: "In a climate of growing repression of Jacobin sympathizers, accompanied by a concerted attempt to muzzle the press, [Southey] audaciously celebrates a French campaign for liberation from British rule. His central figure ... is not a man but a woman of courage . . . vision?and also, as one might expect in the 1790s, of sensibility" (Curran 167). Looking back at Southey's epic two years after Waterloo, Shelley would have found an even fuller pattern than Curran indicates from which to develop his own revolutionary woman warrior: a passionately inspired militant who leads her nation to victory over its oppressors only to be sold out by her male rulers, tried as a witch and a heretic, and burned at the stake. The contradictory mythic accretions around Joan of Arc since the time of her political intervention and death, indicated by the chapter titles in Marina Warner's 1981 study, would have fascinated Shelley: "Prophet," "Harlot of the Armagnacs," "Heretic," "Ideal Androgyne," "Knight," "Amazon," "Personification of Virtue," "Child of Nature."8 In the last of the chapters I have just cited, Warner places Southey's poem in the context of appropriations of Joan of Arc as peasant nationalist martyr by both left and right during and after the French Revolution. That by 1814 Coleridge had become disgusted with his and Southey's "transmogrification of the fanatic Virago into a modern novel-pawing Proselyte of the age of Reason, a Tom Paine in Petticoats,"9 indicates precisely the grounds for assuming Shelley's interest in what they had done. And that Shelley saw the point of returning to Southey's early revolutionary allegory in 1817 is confirmed by his initially having tried to get Laon and Cythna co-published by the Olliers and by Sherwood, Neely, and Jones: the latter were responsible for the sensationally embarrassing publication of Southey's Wat Tyler in February of 1817.10 Southey?and in a different way Coleridge, both as Southey's collabo rator and as a poet writing about Joan of Arc on his own?are crucially concerned with the source of the voices that speak to and through their 8.

This issue was a traditional part of the legend: Joan had claimed that St. Catherine, St. Margaret, and St. Michael had told her to go to the Dauphin and lead his forces to victory, and this claim, variously recorded and interpreted, figured critically in her trial and execution. Southey and Coleridge approach the matter with a divided agenda. As Southey makes clear in the Preface to later editions o? Joan of Arc, the mystery surrounding the source of Joan's authority makes her story "pe culiarly fit for poetry. The aid of angels and devils is not necessary to raise her above mankind; she has no gods to lackey her, and inspire her with courage, and heal her wounds; the Maid of Orleans acts wholly from the workings of her own mind."11 This makes it sound as if we have already arrived at Cythna's condition of self-generated prophetic wisdom. But in the poem itself Joan listens to voices other than her own all the time? never directly to the voice of God, but recurrently to voices in the phenomena of nature, as Marina Warner emphasizes. And in the section o? Joan of Arc contributed by Coleridge to Book 2 of the first edition, she listens to a male "tutelary spirit," a "guardian Power" that may be said to represent, argues Robert Sternbach, "the will to French national self determination?and ultimately democratic freedom?working itself through Joan."12 The problem for Southey and Coleridge was a version of one we are now familiar with: how to represent an authority higher than or beyond?yet not ultimately other than?"the workings of [Joan's] mind" (how to show her mind "Working but in alliance with the works / Which it beholds," to adapt the language of Book 2 of The Prelude in which authority explicitly gets absorbed into Wordsworthian agency). Trac ing the various configurations of this problem is an extremely complicated matter, given Southey's revisions from edition to edition and Coleridge's initial collaboration and then separate elaboration of the Joan of Arc material. What we can say for certain, though, is that this very problem about how and where to locate Joan's voice of authority would have been apparent from any version o? Joan of Arc that Shelley might have read. Shelley's rewriting of this earlier romantic representation of a woman's access to discursive and political authority is in one sense an overtly feminist version of his rewriting of Wordsworth, Coleridge, and Southey in Alastor, Mont Blanc, and other earlier poems: he radically intensifies the reflexive or autogenous impulse, locates it principally in the self-realizations of a powerful female figure, and extends it through a dynamic of specular projective reciprocity. Jerrold Hogle reads this dynamic in The Revolt of il. The Poetical Works of Robert Southey, Collected by Himself, 10 vols. (London: Longman, Orme, Brown, Green, and Longmans, 1937?38) 1: xxii. 12.

The guiding principle of Hogle's analysis is Shelley's own in "On Love": "there is something within us which from the instant that we live and move thirsts after its likeness."13 "Primary narcissism" in the Shelley-cum-Freud-cum-Lacan sense elaborated by Ho gle is fundamental to the formation of subjectivity on something other than naively solipsistic grounds: the Shelley an subject constitutes itself by finding this "thirst after its own likeness" mirrored back to it from "a specific counterpart (a person or environment or symbolic order)."14 By extending Shelley's own reading of anthropomorphic projection in Hume's Four Dissertations, Hogle shows how Cythna and Laon enact this double narcis sistic transference on a political as well as a personal level. Cythna's role in articulating the political implications of the dynamic Hogle emphasizes is crucial: it is she who reveals, in her speeches to the sailors who bear her away from the sea-cave of confinement and self-realization in Canto 8, that "The most oppressive and hierarchical transfer of 'selfhood' outside the supposed 'self [to a God or King] is . . . the same as the one in the most loving and equal of interchanges . . . the foundations of tyrannical ideology lie in what can happen to the movement of desire that also serves to promote love" (96?97). Hogle's reading of The Revolt of Islam helps us see the difference between Shelley's Cythna and Southey's Joan of Arc as women warriors imagined as acting "wholly from the workings of [their] own mind." It also helps us understand aspects of the problem of authority I have been trying to define that are left unresolved in Shelley's text. Hogle wants us to value Shelley's vision of how "the most loving and equal of interchanges" can overcome political oppression by recognizing its own deep relation to the potential for such oppression?but he sees that this idealized reflexive egalitarianism gives way to a relentlessly persistent tendency towards hier archy. At one striking moment in his reading he indicates that the hierarchy is less a matter of gaze than of voice?the inescapable privileging of one voice over another. Cythna "can complete the process" of reciprocating self-projection "to the point of really comprehending it," he writes, "only by telling all" that she has learned through her subtler language within language "to Laon" (98). We are now in a position, I think, to say 13- Shelley's Poetry and Prose, ed. Donald H. Reiman and Sharon B. Powers (New York: Norton, 1977) 473. 14.

She, not Laon, is Shelley's hero of projected reflexivity: but in the rhetorical structure of The Revolt of Islam it is only through Laon's voice that she speaks. Though the poet-narrator is guided into the presence of the two departed spirits in Canto i by the figure of a woman who speaks with a fierce authority ("Speak not to me, but hear!" she says in stanza 25), this woman's words too are set off in quotation marks?differentiated from the unmarked discourse that joins the poet-nar rator to Laon as the poem's primary narrator.15 At this point the question needs to be posed pretty starkly: maybe Shelley is not a male feminist at all but rather, in Alan Richardson's terms, just one in a line of romantic "colonizers of the feminine."16 Or is that what a male feminist inevitably is: a man whose identification with women's struggle against oppression is really his disguised or furtive effort to control, domi nate, appropriate the power of that struggle? Reading The Revolt of Islam in relation to Southey's foan of Arc suggests a way of taking seriously the force of Richardson's point while making some indispensable political and historical discriminations. Shelley imagines a degree of autonomy for Cythna that is quite distinct from the ambitious yet compromised depic tions of Joan of Arc by Southey and Coleridge in their pantisocratic days. That Shelley's representation of Cythna's oppression and self-liberation is in part a self-portrait?that he wants to be Cythna, not just to possess her as her fantasized masculine counterpart?makes a difference. It is a valuable ramification of Hogle's argument that the reversion to hierarchical configu rations in The Revolt of Islam signals an awareness on Shelley's part that the idealized mutual self-constitution he celebrates cannot be sustained. The rhetorical locating and marking off of Cythna's voice may be read in similar terms?as a sign of difference even within levels of specular projection, as a denial of any claim of unmediated access to the feminine even in a text in which the feminine is so evidently a projection of the male writer's desire. The Victorian feminist Mathilde Blind told the readers of the Westminster Review in 1870 that while previously "all poets creating ideals of woman . . . had depicted her invariably in her relation as either wife or mistress, mother or daughter?that is, as a supplement to man's nature," Shelley had imagined in Cythna "a new female type."17 Some readers today 15- William A.

The patterns I have been following from Southey's Joan of Arc to Shelley's The Revolt of Islam are brought into yet sharper focus from a vantage point established in Kenneth Johnston's essay on Wordsworth's last effort to continue The Recluse, the 1826 lines "Composed when a prob ability existed of our being obliged to quit Rydal Mount as a Residence." If you are unfamiliar with this poem, it will come as a shock of more than mild surprise to move from the stuffy occasional title of Wordsworth's lines to the provocative interrogative title of Johnston's essay: "Narcissus and Joan: Wordsworth's Feminist Recluse?" The shock is revealing, for at the center of Wordsworth's elegiac anticipation of having to leave Rydal Mount and its "pellucid Spring" (called the Nab Well) are astonishingly paired extended references to "the fair Narcissus" (79 ff.) and to "the Maid of Arc" (165 ff.). Both, Johnston shows through an attentive reading of the lines in their variant versions, "are veiled versions of Wordsworth himself. ... In the poem's obscure progression from Narcissus to Joan of Arc, we can sense Wordsworth's complicated efforts to work out, through metaphor, a formula for the socio-political effect of artistic creativity in the ordinary world."18 Johnston goes on to draw out a late Wordsworthian analogue to the politically divergent representations in Southey, Coleridge, and Shelley. If Wordsworth's "progression from Narcissus to Joan of Arc" seems more "obscure" than theirs (203), it may be because for once we are not listening closely enough to the mediations of Miltonic self-projec tion in the description of the waving ferns reflected in the Nab Well: The Other, glass'd in thy unruffled breast, Partook of every motion, met, retired, And met again . . . (72-74)19 This is Eve at the pool in Book 4 of Paradise Lost, as well as Wordsworth himself looking over the side of a slow-moving boat at his own reflection in Book 4 of The Prelude, and Coleridge dreaming his way into the reflecting play of his favorite landscape in "This Lime-tree Bower My Prison." When earlier in the poem Wordsworth asks his beloved "trans lucent Spring," "What witchcraft, meek Enchantress, equals thine?" (29), 18. Johnston, SiR 29 (1990): 197?223; quotation from 203. 19.

" Wordsworth's "Maid of Arc" stands over her "Fountain of the Fairies" as a redeemed female Narcissus, as a redeemed Eve who listens not to the working of her own mind but to an echo of Milton's warning voice? a Voice Reached her with supernatural mandates charged More awful than the chambers of dark earth Have virtue to send forth. (174-77) This is the conservative countertype to Shelley's Cythna weaving within her chamber of dark earth a "subtler language within language" from reflections on her own imaginative power. At the end of Wordsworth's portrait, when The chosen Rustic urged a warlike Steed Tow'rd the beleaguer'd city, in the might Of prophecy, accoutred to fulfill, At the sword's point, visions conceived in love (188-91) we seem to have an aggressively armed version of Cythna rushing in (as she often does) on her great black tartary steed. But it is Southey, not Shelley, whom Wordsworth most directly recalls here?this time the Southey who tries to placate Mary Wollstonecraft in the dedicatory lines to his Poems o? 1797 by reminding her that in past ages women were degraded because No Maid of Arc had snatch'd from coward man The heaven-blest sword of Liberty . . . No Corde's angel and avenging arm Had sanctified again the Murderer's name.20 Twinned with Charlotte Corday, Southey's Joan of Arc in 1797 is on her way to becoming a figure for that defeated and defeatist revolutionary violence mystified as the will and word of God that Cythna's mind, as a differentiated projection of Shelley's own, aspires to take us beyond. I conclude by venturing a few more generalized comments on what Shelley's rewriting of Southey and Coleridge tells us about ideology and aesthetics. Southey and Coleridge had made the figure of Joan of Arc the subject of verse narrative at a moment during the 1790s when the contra 20. Southey, Poems (London: Joseph Cottle and G. G. &amp; J. Robinson, 1797).</page><page sequence="10">16 WILLIAM KEACH dictory status of women in the French Revolution had exposed a gap in the revolutionary ideology of universal human rights.21 The formal mani festation of this contradiction in the 1796 Joan of Arc is most dramatically a matter of voice?the voices Joan hears, the voice with which she speaks, the voice(s) of the male poet-narrator. Shelley returns, via Cythna, to this moment from his vantage point within Regency culture by giving fresh figurative and narrative form to Wollstonecraft's claim that women be given a real voice and entitlement to full subjectivity, a claim that at once challenged and remained circumscribed by the ideology of rationalist uni versalism. Shelley elaborates this fresh figurative and narrative form of women's agency in terms of a romantic reflexivity or specularity which, though already there in the Southey-Coleridge Joan, is characteristically pushed to extremes in The Revolt of Islam. If incest is initially the explicit and subsequently the elided thematic shape of this specularity, its most conspicuous formal shape is the marked enfolding of Cythna's voice within the voices of Laon and the narrator. The marking off of her voice and her access to a "subtler language within language" is a sign both of the poem's ideological and political limits, and of its aesthetic honesty. Brown University 21.
