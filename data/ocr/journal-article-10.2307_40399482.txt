<plain_text><page sequence="1">278 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY AESCHYLUS AND ATHENS: A REPLY It seems to me that, whereas at the beginning and end of his review, Professor Winspear praises my book too highly, in the central and con- crete part of it he misrepresents my views and reveals a misunderstanding of the principles of Marxism. The fundamental importance of the development of property in de- termining the evolution of Greek society is an elementary fact on which I insisted repeatedly throughout the book: see especially p. 37-43, 85-91, 205-8, 306 and 350-51. It is therefore idle to suggest that I have "over- looked" it. I also maintained that the democratic revolution marked a reversion to primitive tribal democracy on a higher plane (p. 43, 199 and 207-08)- an aspect of the matter which was important for my argument, because that is how it was regarded by Aeschylus (p. 289). There is no inconsistency here. It is a matter of dialectics. In contending that I have antedated the "historical qualitative leap which finally put an end to gentile social organization," Winspear has overlooked my explicit statement that the gentile social organization was finally destroyed by the democratic revolution in the sixth century b. c; and in appealing to the authority of Engels for the earlier stages of this progress he forgets that there is a whole epoch of Greek society- the Mycenean epoch- of which Engels knew nothing. I cannot pretend to have unravelled all the complications arising out of this period, but Winspear seems to be unaware of them. "After all," he reflects, "the kings of Homeric society were only chieftains of the tribe." Does he really suppose that Agamemnon of Mycenae, Priam of Troy, and Minos of Knossos belonged to this category? My "formalism," he continues, "becomes quite apparent" in my analysis of Greek religion. "He makes the anthropomorphic deities Zeus and Apollo into state gods whose growing power eclipses the tribal Moirai." What I did on page 54 was to point out that in Homer, "the authority of the Moirai is already fading before the growing power of the gods"- which corresponded to the growing power of the kings (p. 53) -and that "their eventual subordination is revealed at a later period in the cult title Leader of the Moirai borne by Zeus at Olympia and by Apollo at Delphi. The new gods have conquered. The tribe has been superseded by the state." It is Winspear who has done the antedating. Winspear apparently believes that Anaximander and Heraclitus were progressives, Pythagoras a reactionary. The problem of dike is too tech- nical to discuss here, but the crucial question is, why did Anaximander regard the encroachment of one substance on another as unjust? I have given my answer to that question: what is Winspear's? He ridicules- the</page><page sequence="2">COMMUNICATIONS 279 idea that Heraclitus, "the primitive dialectician, the philosopher oÂ£ change and the clash of opposi tes/' could have been a reactionary in politics, but forgets that Pythagoras, who lived a generation earlier, was also a dialectician. His theory of a conflict of opposites resolved by their fusion in a new unity does not formally preclude the possibility of further development, and is therefore in the strict sense progressive; but his opponent Heraclitus, by postulating a cycle of change eternally re- peated, closed the circle, and so pointed the way for Parmenides to deny change altogether. "In antiquity," we are told, "what harmony meant is quite suffi- ciently apparent in Plato." In antiquity! The very notion that an idea so vital could have remained stationary in antiquity or any other period is contrary to Marxism. For the early Pythagoreans, including Aeschylus, the idea of harmony was a positive attitude to the conflict resolved in their democratic concordia; for the later Pythagoreans, as for instance Plato, it was a negative reaction to the new forces making for the de- struction of that concordia. To the early Pythagoreans I devoted ten pages of concrete argument (p. 210-19); yet Winspear blandly assures your readers that "there is no evidence whatsoever" in favor of my view, while in support of his own he refers them, if you please, to "the abun- dant evidence" enshrined in an unpublished dissertation! Let me, in reply, refer him to Kurt von Fritz, Pythagorean Politics in Southern Italy (New York, 1940), where after the most exhaustive analysis of the sources that has yet been published (including the numismatic evidence, which I did not deal with) the author concludes that after the initial period there was a marked change in Pythagorean politics- a change from pro- gressive to conservative. And this, as I explained, is "the usual fate of moderate progressives after the class struggle has progressed beyond the point at which it serves their interests" (p. 291). There is nothing "mysterious" about that. It is a matter of elementary dialectics. I cannot here follow my critic into all his confused remarks about fifth-century politics, but will deal summarily with the main points to show how he has treated my argument. The assumption which (without giving any reference) he attributes to me, that "the Pythagorean notion of the moira is the same thing as the old tribal lot," is one I did not make, and his whole argument on this point leaves me at a loss to understand against whom or what it is directed. My view of the Pythagorean notion of moira is not given in this book at all; and, if Winspear will consult my edition of the Oresteia (vol. 1, p. 57, n, p. 321), he will see that it is not what he imagines it to be. "Thomson is obliged to show that any individuals or factions who</page><page sequence="3">280 SCIENCE AND SOCIETY worked with Persia were anti-democratic." What I did show was that, down to 479 b.c., when Persia was the main enemy, the policy of Themis- tocles, leader of the radical democrats, was to oppose Persia with Spartan aid, but after that date, when the main enemy was Sparta, his policy, still democratic, was to oppose Sparta with Persian aid (p. 221-2, 229-30). Before reconstructing my mental processes, Winspear should have studied their results. He might also have taken a lesson from Themistocles in the dialectics of party politics. "Any arguments which make Aeschylus into a democrat would apply as well to Cimon, the aristocratic leader and contemporary of Aeschylus!" After this reductio ad absurdum of my position, your readers may be interested to learn what my position is: Aeschylus "supported the policy of Cimon" (p. 309). In this period the cleavage was not between aristo- crats and democrats but between moderate democrats and radical demo- crats; and Cimon, like Aeschylus, was a moderate. Winspear has over- looked the changes that had taken place in Athenian politics, the result of the democratic revolution. No wonder he finds the period "baffling." After questioning my view (without stating what it is) of Aeschylus' attitude to the Court of the Areopagus on the ground that "the evidence is unconvincing," Winspear offers, as an alternative to mine, the view that "Aeschylus was strongly affirming his faith in the Court and depre- cating any further diminution in its powers." This is my view (p. 286). Why is my critic so confused? In his Genesis of Plato's Thought, as- suming without question that the political position of the Pythagoreans remained fixed throughout the most eventful period of Greek history, and disregarding their cardinal doctrine of the fusion of opposites in the mean, he said nothing at all about Aeschylus- the only Pythagorean known to us in more than fragmentary remains- who consciously applied that doctrine to the evolution of democracy; and so, rather than revise his estimate of the Pythagoreans, he is now trying to make out that Aeschylus was not a democrat. He is of course at liberty to refute my interpretation of Aeschylus, if he can; but he should not confuse the issue by criticizing as mine opinions which I did not express and do not hold.
