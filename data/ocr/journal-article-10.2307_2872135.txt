<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE EXPERIENCE OF THE SACRED IN THOREAU'S WEEK BY JONATHAN BISHOP Discussions of Thoreau often begin with a review of the various identities his life and work offer a reader: naturalist, social phi- losopher, artist. The history of Thoreau criticism includes the rise and fall of Thoreau the naturalist; more recently, the critic of society has enjoyed a briefer vogue. But the Thoreau who seems to have become most prominent within the present critical genera- tion is a figure quite different from either. This is Thoreau the hero of the self, or athlete of subjectivity, and therefore-the connection seems intrinsic-Thoreau the artist. Such a double definition is argued, for instance, in Sherman Paul's massive The Shores of America, the book which has de- servedly made the strongest of recent impressions. For Paul it is pre-eminently the subjective idealist in Thoreau whose pains and joys count. The emergence, toils, triumphs, and decline of this egotistical sublime constitute the major plot of a life moving from the glad narcissism of youth to the stoic egotism of middle age. The works that life produced appear accordingly as more or less complex " conceits " of this development. And Thoreau's experience of nature is correspondingly seen as fuel for the fires of self-transcendence. "Thoreau's relation to nature . . . was . self-reflexive; he never studied nature apart from the self."' This conclusion can stand as typical of a climate of opinion which Paul's book helps us bring into focus. The other most influential of recent voices would presumably be Perry Miller's; and the introduction to the latter's edition of the lost journal is a curiously exasperated and self-involved attack on the depth of Thoreau's self-involvement. Miller depicts a perilously diseased Thoreau, as giddily absorbed in the intricacies of his own con- sciousness as any Stephen Dedalus.2 And Alfred Kazin, reviewing 'Sherman Paul, The Shores of America (Urbana, 1958), p. 59. 2Perry Miller, Consciousness in Concord (Boston, 1958), p. 30. 66 Experience of the Sacred in Thoreat's " Week"</page><page sequence="2">Miller's work as man of letters at large, adds his representative note of agreement: Thoreau " really had no subject but himself." 8 Such judgments, elaborate or occasional, triangulate a preference no one writer can be said to have originated, though learning and sensitivity will now sanction it among students eager to respect their author in an approved idiom.4 To be sure this subjectivistic Thoreau is not entirely new- fashioned. Thoreau has always attracted readers with a bias toward aggressive individualism, political and philosophical, who not unnaturally end by exaggerating the value for Thoreau himself or for his work of the self they find. This has proved true for those who dislike him as well: the obverse of a sympathetic elaboration of the convolutions of consciousness would be the brisk judgment, "he is an impossible egotist." ' After such a repudiation, it is even more necessary to fall back on the triumphs of the art. For the currency of the subjectivistic Thoreau has oddly coin- cided with the growth in modern respect for Thoreau the artist. From Mattheissen's discovery of an organic structure in Walden to the latest explication of rebirth rituals, the implicit argument has snowballed: Thoreau escapes from solipsism as a man of letters, a creator of complex metaphor and multiple irony. Such logic may reflect our concerns better than it describes Thoreau. It is a peculiarly modern tendency to divide the world into a lonely self on the one hand and on the other a barren chaos within which only works of art have value. We can positively enjoy seeing the artist as a damned and privileged soul exploiting other- wise worthless experience for material out of which to build images. The historical evidence will not support the literary side of this contemporary tendency-the Transcendentalists were not New 'Alfred Kazin, "Thoreau's Lost Journal," Contemporaries (Boston, 1963), pp. 47 and 49. 'Even Joseph Wood Krutch, whose own sympathies must be assumed to lie with Thoreau the naturalist, can be found to have affirmed that Thoreau's " principal achievement was . . . the creation of himself, and his principal literary work was, therefore, the presentation of that self. . . ." See his Henry David Thoreau (New York, 1948), p. 11. Similar summary remarks may be found in Canby and Van Doren as well. ' Theodore Baird, " Corn Grows in the Night," The Massachusetts Review, IV (Autumn, 1962), 96. No doubt this succinct judgment has been more often thought than addressed to a class or written down. Jonathan Bishop 67</page><page sequence="3">Critics-but it can apparently substantiate the charge of solipism. Is it not a truism to say of Transcendentalism that it " made the self the center of existence and all beyond it its horizon? The self was called into the world to realize itself."6 This is Sherman Paul again, making what must seem a fair rendering of the lesson Thoreau learned from Emerson. The rhetoric of that age, ab- stracted from the experience which once underlay it, does indeed seem to define self-culture in terms of liberation from society and tradition to enjoy the heights of possibility in communion with an accomplice nature. The Thoreau who responded to and repeats such impulses and affirmations would be coincident with at least the surface intention of much which we know influenced him. At the same time there is, even in Emerson, much to suggest that this kind of self-expansiveness could be a disease as well as a triumph. The self was the Soul-but it was also the conse- cretions of the failed ego, and to affirm one's ordinary identity obtusely was to betray one's potential life. In any case there remains an obvious element within the standard Transcendentalist creed which can relieve us from any need to eddy long among the ambiguities of the Emersonian self. Freedom and autonomy was one half of the message-the other half, more crucial to the experi- encers themselves, was Nature. Even in Emerson's most vatic and (to hostile eyes) solipsistic moments, Nature is never left out of the equation. If Emerson requires some explanation on this point, Thoreau should not. Words aside, his way of life is inexplicable except on the supposition that Nature was not merely real for him, but more real than the self his present readers are alternately attracted to and repelled by. Why else would he have spent a lifetime of afternoons looking for whatever it was he was looking for? If he were merely the literary consciousness we are to identify, he might have gone up garret immediately and never come down- stairs, much less outdoors. Nature must be counted in; and the minute we do this, the figure he presents profoundly alters; he becomes a man seeking to understand and to formulate, to be sure, but first of all to encounter, a reality above him on the scale of being and antecedent to all words about it. To recollect, though, that Nature must have been a genuine object for Thoreau, and that the Self and its language are better 6Paul, p. vii. 68 Experience of the Sacred in Thoreau's " Week"</page><page sequence="4">considered starting point and result respectively than final cause of his characteristic activity, will not orient us completely. The term " nature " is too ambiguous. Thoreau's devotion to the par- ticulars of Concord ecology-nature in lower case-is so plentifully exemplified in the words we admire that the sympathetic fellow- naturalist easily concludes the goal of his desire to be simply a more living knowledge of the actual world. On this level Thoreau would represent the " effort of the human spirit to make itself at home in our universe." ' His art would then become a way of rendering that which is distinctly there to the senses back to the imagination. Such a Thoreau can be reasonably linked with Jef- fries and Burroughs, as has been done. There has been something autumnal, not to say cozy, about much of the criticism which has appreciated Thoreau and Tho- reau 's nature after this empiricist fashion, and subjectivistic and aesthetic criticism has patronized the results. Yet even the most relaxed commentator of the naturalist school has somewhere regis- tered an awareness that nature, for Thoreau if not for his critic, is also Nature: that the particulars are interesting not only for the sake of the pleasures they offer the senses and the mind, but because they mediate a reality still more objective than the ob- jects which present it. What brought Thoreau out, says Norman Foerster, already repeating a conclusion that goes back in one form or another to Channing and Emerson, was the " mystic's hope of detecting" reality; Thoreau's excursions were a repeated "quest."8 And this formulation recurs more recently in Ethel Seybold's insufficiently influential book on Thoreau's debt to the classics. " The truth, the quite incredible truth about Thoreau, the truth that we resist in spite of his own repeated witness, is that he spent a quarter of a century in a quest for transcendental reality, in an attempt to discover the secret of the universe." 9 7 Reginald L. Cook, Passage to Walden (Boston, 1949), p. 181. 8 Norman Foerster, Nature in American Literature (New York, 1923), p. 101. ' Ethel Seybold, Thoreau: the Quest and the Classics (New Haven, 1951), p. 7. One reason why modern criticism has been imperceptive about or uneasy with that side of Thoreau which was oriented toward nature, and through nature to Nature, may lie in an inability to suspend a deep seated if unconscious disbelief in his object. If we are not willing to credit Nature with a mode of being which permits, indeed obliges, us to encounter it-or her-rather than simply to " sense," " define," or " explain " inert phenomena, obviously we will not be in any position to appreciate the ways in which one man did. To save our respect for that man and his art, we will then fall back on the self and its words; for these, after our fashion, we do believe in and can prove to exist, as we say, " on the page." Jonathan Bishop 69</page><page sequence="5">If Thoreau is an objectivist, then, as well as a subjectivist, and if the object in which he believed was a Nature that included more than the " natural" alone, we should find ourselves more- comfortable in our character as literary historians, if not as close critics or existentialists. For it is a matter of the most conven- tional literary history that the Romantics did believe in the exist- ence of Nature, and were prepared to affirm that the encounter with Nature could become, for certain souls at certain moments, an encounter with God. We are familiar with this "Natural Supernaturalism," in Carlyle's phrase, and would even be able to put the notion into place in a rough history of the relevant ideas.1" Our apprehension of the cultural evolution of the idea, though, too rarely descends into our response to individual cases. Yet a Natural Supernaturalist would by definition be someone whose experience of the sacred was mediated by the most local kind of natural particulars; and whose testimony to the possibility of such experience was in turn mediated to us through equally concrete details of language. The " other" world would reveal itself not as such, or in so many words, but through some idiosyncratic perception of this world. The elements that functioned as in- stances of " nature " and those which functioned as " super- nature" could differ considerably from writer to writer. For it is of the essence of the Romantic predicament that there can be no general rules distinguishing the two realms in advance of the experience which incorporates them. Each case of Natural Super- naturalism would therefore be unique, and its vocabulary local, not to say eccentric.1' 10 Such a history might begin from the scholastic distinction between the realms of Nature and Grace, and come (for the purposes of criticism) rapidly down to the Enlightenment. For if one interprets the Enlightenment as an unconscious cultural decision to end the cold war of the traditional categories by assigning to Nature the whole of the real, instead of, as before, "one half " of it, then we should not be surprised to find that the Nature of the scholastics would gradually expand to take in aspects of reality hitherto segregated under a separate name. The several affirma- tions of the Romantic phase in this metaphysical dialectic can be understood as intimations that such an expansion of reference had in fact begun to take place. For Romanticism in all its developments, Nature includes at least some " supernatural" elements as well as " natural " ones. " Recent studies of the " sacred " and " profane " in primitive and civilized experi- ence presume that in both these contexts the distinctions will be more or less disguised; the ignorance of the participant is the opportunity of the savant. The dichotomy itself has been made familiar to students of literature by the continental tradition in anthropology and sociology, especially by the works of Mircea Eliade, though Roger Caillois and J. Huizinga are also relevant names. 70 Experience of the Sacred in Thoreau's " Week"</page><page sequence="6">Next to Blake and Wordsworth, Thoreau is probably the most interesting such case we have; certainly the most important Ameri- can example. The obvious place to go for demonstrative evidence of how he could find the supernatural in the natural would be Walden, or more justly, all the writings together. And there is a book to be written on Thoreau's total experience of the sacred. But I should like to concentrate here on A Week on the Concord and Merrimack Rivers. Criticism has too often condescended to this book. The opinion is only now beginning to go out that it is merely a young man's compendium of essays and poems strung on the thread of a voyage narrative not itself of the first interest. Yet though simple in comparison with Walden, or even the Jour- nal, the Week is not without independent subtleties which may be taken with some seriousness. It has the advantage of present- ing in simple outline a sequence of confrontations between the self and the natural universe, many of which are sufficiently developed to interest a reader looking for a common structure. Here then one might expect to find at least the early Thoreauvian doctrine respecting the possibilities of natural experience. The Week is a convenient arena in which to test the suspicion that Thoreau is more than a solipsist, and his art more than imaginative play. When one sets oneself to become attentive to the kinds of ex- perience of Nature which are given in this book, marking off separate encounters, and staying open to such parallels of situation and language as offer themselves, a common structure and a common direction do seem to emerge. The encounters vary much in detail and degree of expansion, but they are alike. What they share can be read as Thoreau's special version of the Romantic quest. When Thoreau faces Nature, he does indeed seem to find within it special relationships which for him appear to represent the " natural" and the " supernatural." The most inclusive of these structural relationships has at- tracted some critical notice. John C. Broderick has pointed out that the typical physical and spiritual action in a Thoreauvian excursion or paragraph is a movement " from the mundane known to the transcendent knowable and back again," a rhythm of ad- venture and return.'2 The movement may be imagined, another 12 John C. Broderick, "The Movement of Thoreau's Prose," AL, XXXIII (May, 1961), 136. Jonathan Bishop 71</page><page sequence="7">writer argued, as a practical version of the Emersonian " circle." 13 This circular motion would then be a general frame for all lesser contrasts between the profane and the sacred. We need, though, to appreciate the detail of these, since they constitute what is idiosyncratic in Thoreau's approach to reality, and determine the specifics of his experience and language. It will be convenient to summarize the principal polarities before we look at passages. The first manifestation of the way in which Thoreau distin- guishes the " mundane " from the " transcendent " is literally spa- tial. For him the near is associated with the profane; the remote with the sacred. Within any specific experience of the natural scene entities at a distance from the eye-whatever they may be- are for the Thoreauvian protagonist always symbols of divinity; while objects physically close correspondingly represent that as- pect of nature which addresses the secular intelligence alone. This contrast of far and near is sufficiently prevalent and determinative to establish the " style " of a Thoreauvian confrontation; someone who wished to parody him, for instance, would have to imitate it. There are other polarities with essentially the same meaning. The temporal complement of the spatial difference between the near and the remote is a contrast between the present and the past. What Thoreau sees in the present is always banal; what he can recall from the past always sacred. The past of the individual is recovered from his memory; the past of the race from old books or tradition. Thoreau is fascinated by both modes of recovery, which for him work together: the life of each individual recapitu- lates that of the race, and vice versa. Thoreau shares the Emer- sonian prejudice against the near past, which includes everything which inhibits the original relation to the universe; but unlike Emerson, does not confound this with the remote past, from which we derive, he thought, the most valuable hints respecting the reality with which we seek to have that original relation. Besides space and time, other contexts involving significant polarities are the day and the season. Noon is secular; dawn (and to some degree sunset) is sacred; though occasionally the ratios are reversed, and mid-day is paradoxically associated with the divine. Surface is profane, depth sacred. Ordinary noises, includ- ing human speech, are secular; silence is sacred, and so is music, IS J. S. Bois, " Circular Imagery in Thoreau's 'Week,'" College English, XXVI (February, 1965), 350. 72 Experience of the Sacred in' Thoreau's " Weekl"</page><page sequence="8">or any sound which can be heard as music, especially if heard from a distance. The same meaning holds for the generic differ- ences between prose and poetry, science and mythology, history and fable; and therefore the difference between the literal and the imaginative generally. Throughout such large polarities as the cultivated and the wild, the social and the solitary, labor and leisure, have the same import, pervading experiences where they need not be mobilized explicitly, since the intention of the book presupposes them. Several of these polarities have separately received attention in articles or books. As autonomous images, though for the most part only as such, they are all familiar. One general reminder is perhaps worth making before proceeding to specifics: not every description of an encounter with Nature in the Week involves all the possible polarities. The striking instances, though, invariably incorporate more than two or three, and once one is alerted to the full range of possibilities, to the grammar as it were of the Thoreauvian imagination, it is easy to detect vestigial references to contrasts not overtly in use, and so make sense of brief turns of phrase that would otherwise appear accidental. We are now finally free to examine cases. And for the first let me choose, not a category like near and far, but an episode. All readers of the Week will remember the interpolated tale of the excursion to the top of Mt. Greylock. The independence of this story in its context and the unusual elaboration of detail alike qualify this encounter for special attention. To climb a mountain is of itself a most concrete and traditional way in which to dramatize the journey from the profane to the sacred. The literal action is already ritualistic, whether or not the person who performs it is conscious of the fact. Thoreau may therefore take for granted that his reader will understand his general intention. His opening paragraphs stay close to the pro- fane details of the climb and the circumstances of the night in the open spent at the top of the mountain. Some of these details are interesting in themselves, but the structure of the anecdote invites the reader to pass on directly to the climax. This occurs when he wakes in the morning to find the whole earth covered with mist. He climbs on the roof of an observatory above the surface of the fog and gazes out upon the new world into which I had risen in the night, the new terra firma Jcmathan Bishop 73</page><page sequence="9">perchance of my future life. There was not a crevice left through which the trivial places we name Massachusetts or Vermont or New York could be seen.... All around beneath me was spread for a hundred miles on every side, as far as the eye could reach, an undulating country of clouds, answering in the varying swell of its surface to the terrestrial world it veiled. It was such a country as we might see in dreams, with all the delights of paradise.'4 The long climb and the night in the open have been an ascesi' preparing him for the vision of the sacred to which he wakes. To call this new "country " a "paradise" is not merely rhetorical, though the reader is as usual left free to suppose that Thoreau is only using metaphors. Literally the view is of a portion of this world, for a mist is as much a natural fact as the land it conceals. But in the context of the experience a portion of nature is as it were set apart to represent that which is beyond nature; the clouds exemplify the invisible. Thoreau sees what in ordinary life one "dreams" of;- dreaming and waking experience constituting another polarity frequent in the book. It is typical of the Thoreauvian encounter that " Massachusetts, Vermont, and New York" should disappear, for the giving of dis- tinct names to separate objects is a function of experience within the profane world. It is also worth noticing that the clouds " answer " proportionately to the contours of the landscape below. The sacred, though separate from the profane, is related to it by analogy. What is here a relationship in space is elsewhere repeated in intellectual terms in the form of the familiar " correspondence " between fact and truth, vehicle and tenor, literal and imaginative so characteristic of Transcendental epistemology. So far the idiom of the experience is chiefly spatial, but other elements of the Thoreauvian matrix are present. The confronta- tion takes place at dawn, the most sacred time of day. The experi- ence as a whole is remembered; which engages the contrast of present and past. And finally, the climactic paragraph brings the adventurer to the verge of an encounter not merely with the sacred realm but with the God who we might expect to inhabit it. Con- sider the language with which he proceeds; Thoreau finds himself, he says, " in the dazzling halls of Aurora" (199) to which his eyes had so often been raised from the earth below, " in the very path of the Sun's chariot," which presently rose, so that " I saw '4 The Writings of Henry David Thoreau (Boston, 1906), I, 197-198. All quotations are from this edition. 74 Experience of the Sacred in Thoreau,'s " Week"'</page><page sequence="10">the gracious god. . . ." Such impersonating language makes the rising sun an obvious analogue for God; though the idiom is so poetical that at first one hardly takes the implication seriously. Or is that idiom itself a disguise? Before one can decide, the experience as a whole lapses away-" owing, as I think, to some unworthiness in myself." The mist rises up above the level of his perch, and " I sank down again into that ' forlorn world,' from which the celestial sun had hid his visage." When Thoreau descends the mountain once more he finds on questioning the people he meets that it had been a " cloudy and drizzling day wholly" (9200). He has returned once more to the profane world. One can use this Greylock experience as a full type against which to match less fully developed experiences employing the same grammar. A comparatively pure though minor example of the latter would be the description, late in the book, of the pleasure he used to take watching ships sail out from New York harbor while staying on Staten Island. In the evening he would count the sails still in sight: But as the setting sun continually brought more and more to light, still farther in the horizon, the last count always had the advantage, till, by the time the last rays streamed over the sea, I had doubled and trebled my first number; though I could no longer class them all under the several heads of ships, barks, brigs, schooners, and sloops, but most were faint generic vessels only. And then the temperate twilight, perchance, revealed the floating home of some sailor whose thoughts were already alienated from this American coast, and directed towards the Europe of our dreams. (254) Here that " other world " which on Greylock Thoreau saw as a landscape of mist has become " the Europe of our dreams." In such a manifestation, it cannot literally be seen, though it may be longed for by an imagined protagonist, the anonymous " sailor " whose thoughts are already " alienated " from the banalities of the nearby " American coast." Thoreau himself is still on the coast, and the time is sunset rather than dawn. Nor is this " Europe" inhabited by any figure that could correspond to the role of the sun in the Greylock memory. The idler on the shore had not undergone such a purgative discipline as would fit him for a fuller vision. But even so, what he does see is not wholly of this world. There is a kind of anticipation of the invisible " Europe " in the gradual illumination by the setting sun of more and more distant ships, which increasingly lose their profane dis- Jonathan Bishop 75</page><page sequence="11">tinctness as "ships, barks, brigs, schooner, and sloops." The evaporation of names and numbers is parallel to the disappearance of Massachusetts, Vermont, and New York; ineffability is one sign of the sacred. In the Greylock experience Thoreau actually travels to the remote place; on Staten Island he dreams of it, and the point of observation remains well within the boundaries of the profane. This second situation is the more typical; the characteristic Thoreauvian excursion leads the eye or the body in the direction of sacred without quite arriving there. Very occasionally the other world will reveal itself suddenly without the labor of a literal voyage, even of the eye: Thoreau is fascinated by reflections in quiet water, for instance, because they image a reality otherwise too distant for approach. "Wherever the trees and skies are reflected, there is more than Atlantic depth, and no danger of fancy running aground ' (47). With a "separate intention of the eye" is it possible to see the sacred "trees and sky "-sacred because reflected-in place of the profane " river bottom." And it is not only by the reflections it occasionally offers that the river gives Thoreau glimpses of another world. A voyage on it, like a walk or a mountain climb, is ritually expressive of the belief that value lies at a distance. There are always vistas ahead and astern; the very position of a rower might well make him appreciate the ambiguous satisfactions of actually penetrating into the region of mystery; the hidden and remote, as the boat moves, turning of itself into the obvious and near, and that in turn be- coming remote again. A voyager is perpetually " eager to double some distant cape, to make some great bend as in the life of man, and see what new perspective would open," thus " looking far into a new country, broad and- serene. . . ." (245) And a river allows, as a path, even self-made, does not, for an indispensable passivity of the will: " we seemed to be embarked on the placid current of our dreams, floating from past to future as silently as one awakes to fresh morning or evening thoughts " (17). A river is a natural symbol of travel in time as well as space; its waters, like memory, bringing the past into the present. The first extended description of the voyage develops this latent com- bination of spatial and temporal import. Thoreau describes in close knowledgable details the late summer flowers the boat passes on the river banks. The point of view is literal and quasi-scientific, 76 Experience of the Sacred in Thoreau's "I Week"</page><page sequence="12">to correspond with the closeness of the boat to the objects ob- served. The description comes to a climax, though, with the men- tion of a flower which is not present, which must be remembered; and that flower is important less for its visible attributes than as the final goal of a recollected excursion: We missed the white water-lily, which is the queen of river flowers, its reign being over for this season. He makes his voyage too late, perhaps, by a true water clock who delays so long. Many of this species inhabit our Concord water. I have passed down the river before sunrise on a summer morning, between fields of lilies still shut in sleep; and when, at length, the flakes of sundight from over the bank fell on the surface of the water, whole fields of white blossoms seemed to flash open before me, as I floated along. . . . (19) The immediate qualities of this recollected experience are all char- acteristic of the sacred: dawn, the rarity of the sight, the prepara- tory removal from the social world. The power of these signals is reinforced by the contrast already established between the lily and the other flowers, the past and the present, the remembered and the observed, the mysterious and the well-known. It is clear that such contrastings of sacred and profane do not depend upon the particular features of nature subsumed; water lilies are not in themselves more sacred to Thoreau than poly- gonum. or arrowhead. It is possible to imagine other circumstances which would establish these flowers too as instances of the extra- ordinary, though here they represent the ordinary. Indeed, some- thing like such a shift occurs in the paragraph just following this description, which notes how the brothers saw on the bank the hibiscus in bloom. They desired to tell one of their friends back in the village, that he might pick this " somewhat rare and inac- cessible flower " in time. They speak to a farmer in a nearby field, so that he may convey the news at church the next day, and thus ensure that " while we should be floating on the Merrimack, our friend would be reaching to pluck this blossom on the bank of the Concord'" (19). The interposition of distance in space and time, together with the creation of a protagonist not the speaker, gives a sacral character in advance to a flower which, though "rare," remains on the whole a profane fact for the brothers at the time. The discussion on the fish of the Concord that immediately follows is structured in the same fashion as the description of the flowers. Some pages are devoted to a thorough survey of the Jonathan Bishop 77</page><page sequence="13">different species as Thoreau the naturalist knows them. Each kind of fish is beautiful; each may be known in detail close to, and named. Yet there are limits to such knowledge. What the naturalist can learn of fish by abstracting them from their proper environ- ment is profane. Their true life is hidden beneath the surface of the water; from the dark depths of which they occasionally emerge, thereby becoming authentic representatives of Nature. Because fish are symbols of what we cannot know about them, the pursuit of them by the fisherman is a " solemn sacrament" whether he knows it or not. " The cork goes dancing down the swift-rushing stream, amid the weeds and sands, when suddenly, by a coin- cidence never to be remembered, emerges this fabulous inhabitant of another element, a thing heard of but not seen, as if it were the instant creation of an eddy, a true product of the running stream " (28). The tone here is almost teasing, but the metaphor makes the fish virtually personal, almost the God of the depths. Subhumanity is, half seriously, an emblem of superhumanity. " Fabulous " is a key word for such beings, however perfunctory its connotations in this context; the relation between fable and history is elsewhere a serious vehicle for the essential contrast of sacred and profane. In fact the fish rises from the depth of the water as the sun rose above the clouds on Greylock; as the shad, in the climatic meditation of the sequence on fish, do not rise past the new dams to their old spawning ground. Structurally all these images are equivalent. All are presented in elaborately fanciful language; from all we derive a hint that the complete experience of the sacred would develop through the various polarities toward some half-recognition of a sacred presence inhabiting the sacred realm. All these episodes are chiefly visual, as one would expect of experiences where the major polarities are spatial. The role of the searching eye is so prominent in these experiences of Nature that it is easy to ask what that eye is searching for-would it not be some sort of answering glance?-and therefore to take notice of a series of ocular encounters extending through the book. On Sunday, for instance, the two brothers pass some idle young men who taunt the travellers from a bridge. Thoreau reports that he discomforted the most forward with a glance of his eye. This meeting is followed by a " just and equal encounter of the eyes, 78 Experience of the Sacred in' Thoreau's " Week"</page><page sequence="14">as between two honest men" (80), enjoyed with a particularly " serene and liberal-minded lockkeeper at Middlesex. A later anecdote of a recollected excursion into a Berkshire valley cul- minates in the " gleam of true hospitality and ancient civility, a beam of pure and even gentle humanity" (218), that Thoreau managed to cozen from a truculent old farmer. The look they finally exchanged was " more intimate with me, and more explana- tory, than any words of his could have been if he had tried to his dying day." And on Tuesday the voyagers meet a boy at Bedford, who wishes to go on with them; " as he looked up the river, many a distant cape and wooded shore was reflected in his eye.. . ." (248) There is a kind of climax for this sequence of ocular imagery (I have not quoted all the instances), in a meditation upon a bittern in " Wednesday ": As we shoved away from this rocky coast, before sunrise, the smaller bittern, the genius of the shore, was moping along its edge, or stood probing the mud for its food, with ever an eye on us, though so demurely at work, or else he ran along over the wet stones like a wrecker in his storm-coat, looking out for wrecks of snails and cockles. Now away he goes, with a limping flight, uncertain where he will alight, until a rod of clear sand amid the alders invites his feet; and now our steady approach comples him to seek a new retreat. (249) Up to this point the description is still largely of mere fact, as the condescension in the tone attests. It is the smaller bittern only. Yet there are hints already that it is more; the time of day is propitious, the bird is also " the genius of the shore " for all its absurdity, and though the brothers have shoved off, they follow the bittern, forcing it to fly further and further away. The narra- tive voice rises a degree: It is a bird of the oldest Thalesian school, and no doubt believes in the priority of water to the other elements; the relic of a twilight antediluvian age which yet inhabits these bright American rivers with us Yankees. There is something venerable in this melancholy and contemplative race of birds, which may have trodden the earth while it was yet in a slimy and imperfect state. Perchance their tracks, too, are still visible on the stones. (249-250) The tone is humorous still, but awed as well. The individual bird dissolves into its species, and that in turn into a consciousness as profound as it is ancient: Jonathan Bishop 79</page><page sequence="15">It still lingers into our glaring summers, bravely supporting its fate without sympathy from man, as if he looked forward to some second advent of which he has no assurance. One wonders if, by its patient study of rocks and sandy capes, it has wrested the whole of her secret from Nature yet. What a rich experience it must have gained, standing on one leg and looking out from its dull eye so long on sunshine and rain, moon and stars! What could it tell of stagnant pools and reeds and dank night fogs! It would be worth the while to look closely into the eye which has been open and seeing at such hours, and in such solitudes, its dull, yellowish, greenish eye. Methinks my own soul must be a bright invisible green. (250) The bird ends by becoming a Presence worth encountering, whose eye conveys a true answering glance, more than fulfilling the promise implicitly made by all the slighter human encounters. But this transcendent identity, given with one hand, is taken away with the other. The bittern represents the mysterious past of Greece, geology, and the two testaments as well, and to look into its eye would be to learn the secret of Nature and of one's own soul. At the same time its God-like eye is " dull, yellowish, green- ish"; the knowledge it transmits is only of stagnant pools and dank night fogs. This ambivalence is not resolved; the paragraph ends on a deliberately banal note which returns us to the profane bittern: I have seen these birds stand by the half dozen together in the shallower water along the shore, with their bills thrust into the mud at the bottom, probing for food, the whole head being concealed, while the neck and body formed an arch above the water. (250) There is no symbolic overtone to these facts. The narrator seems to dismiss his own half discovery of a sacred meaning with contempt. Why, we are bound to ask, need the experience of the sacred abort in this curious fashion? If the sun or a fish or a bird is fit to suggest the presence of God, why may they not equally reveal Him? We may be inclined at first to think a partial answer lies in the limits of visual experience as such: the eye, gazing upon nature, necessarily converts the objects of its regard into entities subservient to itself, and there might well be a degree of em- barrassment in attributing more than a fanciful and self-con- sciously anthropomorphic life to phenomena which are merely observed. But Thoreau's knowledge of the sacred is transmitted to him through other senses beside the eye. Indeed, like most 80 Experience' of the Sacred in Thoreau's " Week"</page><page sequence="16">Romantics, he believed sound a more trustworthy vehicle for the truth of Nature than sight. An answer to the general question can be postponed until we have noticed one or two of the aural experiences. For if flowers, fish, and bitterns are mute, the depths and dis- tances of Nature can sometimes speak to the listening ear. Late on the first evening of the voyage the brothers saw a light on the horizon from a fire in Lowell, and they heard the distant alarm-bells, as it were a faint tinkling music borne to these woods. But the most constant and memorable sound of a summer's night, which we did not fail to hear every night afterwards, though at no time so incessantly and so favorably as now, was the barking of the house-dogs, from the loudest and hoarsest bark to the faintest aerial palpitation under the eaves of heaven. . . . (39-40) Typically the most distant sounds are the least dog-like; a profane " bark " close to is a sacred " aerial palpitation " far off. It is an advantage of sound over sight that no Voyage is required to experi- ence this music; awisely passive ear suffices, which indeed hears best in absolute dark, when the ordinary world is shut out. " Even in a retired and uninhabited district like this, it was a sufficiency of sound for the ear of night, and more impressive than any music." Of course; the sound of the dogs was music. Such sounds are " the evidence of nature's health or sound state," a language beyond language, or Voice of truth, and the contrast between what they convey and the profane words of men, even the most imaginative, can elsewhere become explicit: " After sitting in my chamber many days, reading the poets, I have been out early on a foggy morning and heard the cry of an owl in a neighboring wood as from a nature beyond the common, unexplored by science or by literature " (56) . The dogs were heard most distinctly on the first night, Satur- day; "Monday" affords another nocturnal meditation on the supernatural meaning of natural sound which arises out of hearing " some tyro beating a drum incessantly, in preparation for a country muster" (181). This first description is in day light terms, and the tone is contemptuous, as befits the critic of military folly. From a distance, though, and in darkness, the profane identity of the drummer disappears. A social noise becomes true music. " And still he drummed on in the silence and the dark. This stray sound from a far-off sphere came to our ears from time Jonathan Bishop 81</page><page sequence="17">to time, far, sweet, and significant, and we listened with such an unprejudiced sense as if for the first time we heard at all." So far the sound, like that of the dog barking, is sacred without being personal; but the hint embodied in the word " significant" is picked up and continued in the movements of mind which follow, arriving at an abrupt climax: I stop my habitual thinking, as if the plow had suddenly run deeper in its furrow through the crust of the world. How can I go on, who have just stepped over such a bottomless skylight in the bog of my life? Suddenly old Time winked at me,-Ah, you know me, you rogue, -and news had come that IT was well. That ancient universe is in such capital health, I think undoubtedly it will never die. Heal your- selves, doctors; by God I live. . . . I see, smell, taste, hear, and feel, that everlasting Something to which we are allied, at once our maker, our abode, our destiny, our very Selves . . . the actual glory of the universe: the only fact which a human being cannot avoid recognizing, or in some way forget or dispense with (181-182). This is a high moment indeed. The language is almost as con- fessional as it is cryptic. The sound of the drum was already music; it very nearly becomes a Voice. Indeed, it does become a voice; which says, though, no more than " ah, you know me, you rogue." A Presence appears to exchange the very answering glance for which Thoreau has apparently been looking, and which he fails to find adequately embodied in old farmers or bitterns; but that glance is only a " wink " of " old Time," a fictional gaffer to whom Thoreau mockingly condescends. The " Something" with which he is in touch is still, however capitalized, our " abode " rather than our " maker," an environment rather than a person. Once again Thoreau inhibits himself, checking the drift of his own experience. As on Greylock the end of the ecstatic moment is therefore sad. When we hear such music, he says, " we feel a sad cheer . . . perchance because we that hear are not one with that which is heard " (183). The comment diagnoses his own situation. Aural experience of the sacred has apparently the same limits as visual. " Music," he says in summary, " is the sound of the universal laws promulgated. It is the only assured tone" (184). But the voice of the " gods," audible through drum or bark or hum of telegraph wire, can also be overheard in human language. The " assured tone" speaks through the myths which we inherit from the remote past. Books as well as unmediated Nature can thereby 892 Experience of the Sacred in Thoreau's " Week"</page><page sequence="18">bring us to the verge of the sacred. " When we read [mythology] * . . we are not concerned about the historical truth , . . but rather a higher poetical truth. We seem to hear the music of a thought. . . ." (58) Through the varying tones of ancient stories-which for Thoreau include the histories of the colonists as well as the poems of the Greeks and the scriptures of the East-we " approach to that universal language which men have sought in vain " (59). In them a Voice speaks on the level of culture in the same accents as the casual sounds of Nature; and like Nature, in riddles to the superficial. Thoreau's affirmation of the vocal content of myth is still firmer than his recognition of voice in sacred sounds. " To some extent, mythology is only the most ancient history and biography. So far from being false or fabulous in the common sense, it contains only enduring and essential truths, the I and you, the here and there, the now and then, being omitted " (60). To be sure the generalization sometime stops a little short of his true belief; " to some extent," for instance, functions in this sentence like " per- chance " before a poetical flight to create a protective mock-iden- tity. The student of curious lore can parallel the fanciful poet as a tonal disguise for Thoreau. And the inhibition that interrupts the progress of his natural experiences appear in the context of myth too. Myth contains a Voice announcing " universal laws "; but the moment it is necessary to imagine a Presence to own that voice, resistance begins. The principal locus for the conflict within the dimension of myth appears in the discussion of Christianity. The paragraphs devoted to Christianity in " Sunday " proved offensive enough to contemporary readers to ensure the book's failure, and Thoreau's constricted tone shows that this response was not wholly unanticipated. In general he rejects the religion of New England on the ground that it is not sacred at all. " It seems to me that the god that is commonly worshipped in civil- ized countries is not at all divine, though he bears a divine name, but is the overwhelming authority and respectability of mankind combined" (65-66). This makes Jehovah profane, a nickname for secular facts only. The surface reason why the God of the Christians cannot be a cultural analogue to the presence half- discovered in Nature is clear enough. For a fact to be social was enough to make it imaginatively impenetrable for Thoreau; on this side he was as limited to surfaces as the village philistine of Jonathan Bishop 83</page><page sequence="19">his abhorrence was in the woods. As far as he is concerned the sacred is available only to solitary individuals. Groups know only the profane; and Christianity is thoroughly gregarious. By the definition the polarities enforce, then, it is entirely banal. One would not have the difficulties his respectable contempor- aries had with this judgment if it were made simply and con- sistently. But Thoreau is ambivalent, as other elements of his response besides the muffled tone reveal. The Calvinist God is firmly rejected; but Jesus remains obscurely acceptable as a " fable " poeticized by time. The specifics of the Christian story are a "dream" Thoreau half-permits himself. The Gospels, in- deed, pass a major test for the sacred; they are full of vocal sentences which have power to leave no meeting-house stone upon another. But bad faith is obvious in the imagery as well as in the mixture of opinions. A last paragraph briskly repudiates the religion of the Church as only " pagoda worship. It is like the beating of gongs in a Hindoo subteranean temple" (78), in unhealthy contrast to the " broad daylight " of American freedom and sanity. The sound of Sunday bells is a " twanging." But if in the rest of the Week music, remoteness in time, depth, and darkness are always signs of the sacred, Thoreau is not free to use the same images as terms of abuse; especially on behalf of the " able-souled man," a figure who in every other context is clearly the profane figure Thoreau refuses to recognize here. The presence of such self-contradictory imagery betrays an under- ground attraction to a " mythology " otherwise too nearby to seem valid. It seems fair to associate Thoreau's uneasiness about Chris- tianity with the inhibition that prevents him from acknowledging the full presence of God in Nature. For Christianity raises im- mediately in terms of " mythology " the same question which the encounters with the sun or drum music end by raising on the level of sense experience. Thoreau's resistance is more anxious in pro- portion to the traditional explicitness of the challenge and to the significance of the cultural generally as opposed to the physical; alone in Nature, it is possible to indulge a fanciful anthropo- morphism which must be severely restrained in the village, where people take you literally. In the light of this connection and the conflict it reveals it can be ironic beyond Thoreau's intended irony to read his scornful references to those other writers who " feel 84 Experience of the Sacred in Thoreau's " Week"</page><page sequence="20">it to be incumbent on them, sooner or later, to prove or to acknowledge the personality of God" (79). In any case it is possible for Thoreau to dismiss Christianity as only a white man's importation; America has no valid myth- ology of its own, except the lost life of the Indians and the tales of the first settlers, and it is clearly a relief for Thoreau to fall back from the claims of myth altogether, and return to Nature and sensation alone. In this mood he will affirm that pot holes in old river beds " must be our antiquities, for lack of human vestiges " (264); such signs can suit the sensitive imagination all the better because in Nature the present is the past. " Here is the gray dawn for antiquity. . . . There are the red maple and birchen leaves, old runes which are not yet deciphered; catkins, pine cones, vines, oak leaves, and scorns; the very things them- selves, and not their forms in stone so much the more ancient and venerable" (266). In the woods meditations can be allowed to lead toward a hint of a creative Presence without loss of ease. " And even to the current summer that has come down tradition of a hoary-headed master of all art, who once filled every field and grove with statues and godlike architecture, of every design which Greece has lately copied. . . . Carnac! Carnac! Here is Carnac for me" (267). Such an apprehension of the past in the present converts the human past of myth, remote as it is, into something comparatively profane, a mere vehicle for a Natural tenor.'5 But though Nature is frequently affirmed as more mythical than myth, Thoreau does not abandon human vestiges when he can find them. The need to find a variant of the sacred within cultural as well as natural experience, frustrated on the side of Christianity, is satisfied in his classical studies, his readings in Eastern religion, and above all in his effort to recover the lost Indian and colonial past of his own country. The best version of a valid and accept- able myth Thoreau finds develops from the contrast between the white man, whose entire two hundred years in America constitutes a kind of extended present, and the Indian whose much longer '" The Thoreauvian distinction between the present and near-past, which together are profane, and the remote natural or mythological past which is sacred, may be found again in contemporary abstractions in Roger Caillois, Man and the Sacred, trans. Meyer Barash (Glencoe, Illinois, 1959), pp. 103-107. Caillois observes that the " festival " re-enacts the events of sacred time in terms of ordinary time; a phenomenon of all religious traditions which has a parallel in the Thoreauvian " excursion." Jonathan Bishop 85</page><page sequence="21">history runs back into that of Nature herself. The white man, "knowing well what he knows, not guessing but calculating; strong in community, yielding obedience to authority; of experi- enced race; of wonderful, wonderful, common sense " (53) is an obvious type of the profane, with attributes explicitly opposite to those of the Indian and implicitly in as strong a contrast with Thoreau's own rebellious, solitary, imaginative way of life. The essence of the white man's activity is a large scale alteration of Nature; of the Indian's, such an unconscious but absolute piety as has left scarcely a trace behind. Yet even the banal New England countryside of farms and villages can become transparent to reveal another world inhabited by another race, whose arrowheads and pestles, though sunk in the mud of the rivers, are still visible to the poet. What the profane eye sees is civility; what the instructed mem- ory recalls is savagery; and savagery is Thoreau's chief cultural metaphor for spirituality, as fish and flowers and sounds in the dark are principal physical metaphors. The " wary independence and aloofness " of the Indian stands for Thoreau's own ambition to be " admitted from time to time to a rare and peculiar society with Nature " (55), to have " glances of starry recognition to which our saloons are strangers." As the Indian is conventionally below civilization, so the solitary searcher is above it; from their mutual point of view the labor of the farmer is " something vulgar and foul" (56), to be used if at all only as a source of tropes. It is subversive in the strictest sense to make " wildness " emble- matic of holiness, the brutal a more accurate image of the sacred than the humanly worthy and normally respectable, and the apparent contradiction can trouble Thoreau too, as the chapter on " Higher Laws " in Walden shows; but for all the risks, rhetori- cal and spiritual, this version of pastoral succeeds. The medita- tions on Indian facts are a convincing part of Thoreau's total experience of the sacred, filling a space in the spiritual spectrum that would otherwise, Christianity being refused, remain vacant. The theme of Indian life is necessarily connected with the more general theme of time, and the climactic episode involving Indian material is also a prime instance of the present as a scene for the re-enactment of the past. This is the tale of Hannah Dustan, the one extended story on the level of myth which is developed as fully as one of the major excursions into Nature. In this tale we 86 Experience of the Sacred in Thoreau'3 " Week"</page><page sequence="22">have an opportunity to see what happens to the question of the Presence in the context of a myth which Thoreau fully accepts. The episode begins as the brothers are on their way down the Merrimack once more, returning home to Concord. As they go Thoreau recalls another and less peaceful descent of the same river, " one hundred and forty-two years before this, probably about this time in the afternoon" (341). It was then that " Uannah Dustan, and her nurse, Mary Neff, both of Haverhill, eighteen miles from the mouth of this river, and an English boy, named Samuel Lennardson " (342) paddled hastily down with the scalps of their erstwhile captors in the bottom of the stolen canoe. The specifics attest to actuality with an emphasis that obliges the mind to go beyond it. The fabulous event was as real, the meditation continues, as the stumps on the bank, once trees which " perchance " shaded the fugitives. A shift to the present tense transports the mind into the past: " early this morning the deed was performed, and now, perchance, these tired women and this boy, their clothes stained with blood, and their minds racked with alternate resolution and fear, are making a hasty meal of parched corn and moose-meat. . . ." (343) In structure this experience of the sacred is like many others, but the content is more enigmatic than usual. " Wildness " is in this instance no paradox. Here are human beings-heroic, as befits a myth, but still plain English people--behaving like Indians indeed. The implications are impressive, and we might as well make use of them, since no other story in the Week deals in mythological material so specifically. This episode includes no Voice to an- nounce " universal law," but something better. The exceptional contact from which these people in actuality and Thoreau in imagination are withdrawing is more than the usual glimmerings of a Presence; it is a " deed," an act of war against concrete enemies, a murder. "They are thinking," Thoreau continues, extending the composition of place on which he is embarked as he identifies with his imagined protagonists, " of the dead whom they have left behind on that solitary isle far up the stream, and of the relentless living warriors who are in pursuit." We are invited to conclude that a fully articulated encounter with the Presence in the heart of the sacred wood involves destruction as well as life. To meet Him or his multiplied avatars is not only Jonathan Bishop 87</page><page sequence="23">to see or hear but to kill-or die. If this hint is acceptable, some- thing new is added to our knowledge of the sacred. The close of this tale is not all dark, but it continues a riddle. "The family of Hannah Dustan all assembled alive once more " (345) to live the civil life of white men again, whatever their memories of that other life in which they had briefly participated; all except " the infant whose brains were dashed out against the apple tree " at the beginning of the adventure; " and there have been many in later times have lived to say that they have eaten of the fruit of that apple tree "; among them, after a fashion, Thoreau himself. This can be read as a partial restoration of the balance which the distrustful references to Christianity and the scornful talk about graveyards upset. When the lines of thematic interest coincide, myth can indeed tell more of the truth than bare nature, and Thoreau can find himself after all " compe- tent to write the poetry of the grave " (179). What then is the significance of death as a part of the experience of the sacred, a part so largely omitted from the other episodes, so inescapable in this? Death is to be feared as a threat to the self. Would acknowledgment of the Presence of God involve a threat, then, to the ego of the searcher? It is universal testimony that the life of God is offered only on condition that the self of the inquirer first die. But this is of course precisely the part of the tradition which Transcendentalism most expressly rejected. Be- sides, it is everywhere obvious that Thoreau had exceptional pride of self to reinforce the strictures of the ideology he inherited. The figure with whom contemporary criticism has identified the whole of Thoreau is very real-though as an obstacle as much as an achievement. A solitary pleased with his independence and de- lighting in an environment which made no immediate resistance to movements of his mind might well interpret a personal God as a threat to his integrity. And a tenacious attachment to self would account for the refusal to carry out the logic of experiences which lead in the direction of that recognition; even if this meant that he was forced to repeat the initial stages of what is essentially the same experience over and over. Attachment to self occurs on other levels besides the explicitly religious. The recoil of feeling with which Thoreau backs away from the dangers of discovering a personal God can remind us of the prickly attitude he showed his fellow men. There are many 88 Experience of the Sacred in Thoreaul's " Week"</page><page sequence="24">anecdotes showing his fear of people who threatened his time and freedom. Mixed with that rigor was evidently a longing for a special intimacy which never found entire satisfaction. This con- flict between rejection and frustration appears in the Week throughout the essay on Friendship to which so many pages of "Wednesday " are devoted. The ideal Friend would be one more manifestation of the Pres- ence, all the more satisfying because entirely human, and no risk to his integrity. But an actual friend is hard to find. " The Friend is some fair floating isle of palm eluding the mariner in Pacific seas.... Who would not sail through mutiny and storm, even over Atlantic waves, to reach the fabulous retreating shores of some continent man? " (278). Such language assimilates the ideal Friend to all the other instances of the impossibly remote. Real acquaintances are by contrast frustratingly profane; we discover what was most valuable in our friend only after we have lost him. " After years of vain familiarity, some distant gesture or uncon- scious behavior, which we remember, speaks to us with more em- phasis than the wisest or kindest words " (275). Such references are as melancholy as they are abstract. " There goes a rumor that the earth is inhabited, but the shipwrecked mariner has not seen a footprint on the shore" (280) . Thoreau is then perfectly justified when in this superficially separable essay he calls Friendship the " secret of the universe-" and simultaneously observes that its history is- always a " trag- edy " (281). For in this context too death appears, as well as the teasing absence of a Presence. The particular " history " he would have had most in mind as he wrote was certainly tragic. For the concealed point of the disquisition, the secret concrete that gives the generalizations their silent meaning, is surely John Thoreau. His brother was one Other who was real; who had not to be searched for and evaded, since he was present all the time.'6 But John had died in agony from lockjaw between the time of the voyage and time of writing. Thoreau was left alone, to mourn and celebrate a past made sacred by loss. It is wholly typical of the essay, and of the strategy of the book generally, that John should never appear directly in the text. He disappears into the " we " who together constitute the anonymous sensibility of the :" John is surely more exemplary for the Week than Emerson-or Lidian, who has also been suggested as the figure behind the disquisition on Friendship. Jonathan Bishop 89</page><page sequence="25">narrator. This inexpressiveness seems in inverse proportion to the strength of the feelings involved. " My Friend, . . . is my real brotherl" (302)). The remark might well be reversed. The only place where Thoreau speaks in so many words of his brother is in the brief poetical epigraphs at the beginning. There John is identified with that "only permanent shore, / The cape never rounded, nor wandered o'er " which the prose goes on to supply so many metamorphoses. John is the " muse " who precedes the poet to " loftier " hills and " fairer " rivers; who died, as it were, in his stead, to become identified with the Presence he himself half desired, half feared. But these references are placed so as to be virtually meaningless at first reading. The instinct toward concealment is nowhere more perversely satisfied. The concluding pages of the Week do not significantly alter our sense of the meaning of these several themes and episodes. We hear again, now in valedictory generality, of that " OTHER WORLD which the instinct of mankind has so long predicted'" (412) and again learn how difficult it is to actually discover that realm, "to go within one fold of this which we appear to know so well" (409). To be sure " there is only necessary a moment's sanity and sound senses" to assure us that our hopes are legiti- mate, that " we live on the outskirts of that region," though " carved wood," and floating boughs, and sunset skies are all that we know of it."' Thoreau liked to end all his books affirmatively. What is unsatisfying about these concluding pages is not so much the literal falsity of these statements as our memory of the in- completeness of the experiences they interpret. His summations are a little more positive than the implication of his experiments will support; they might better serve as hypotheses for some new explorer to test than as conclusions from the man of experience himself. Occasionally the discrepancy will jar attention. The question, " is not Nature, rightly read, that of which she is com- monly taken to be the symbol merely" (408) anticipates, de- servedly, a positive answer. The other questions which precede this, though, " may we not see God? Are we to be put off and amused in this life, as if it were with a mere allegory?'" are, as we have seen, susceptible to a negative or at least ambiguous reply. But to the writer at the moment they must have all seemed rhetorical in the same degree. We are left, then, with an expression of faith; a faith which the 90 Experience of the Sacred in Thoreau's " Week "</page><page sequence="26">encounters described have " to some extent " justified. To pursue the changes of faith and inhibition alike one would have to con- tinue beyond the Week to Walden and beyond; indeed the prin- cipal story is there, and not, as any critic must agree, in Thoreau's first book. But the Week is enough to give us an outline of Thoreau's endeavor, and to fill it up too, somewhat better than literary custom has always allowed us to suppose.
