<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTES The forty-fifth regular meeting of the Creighton Club was held at Hobart College, May I-2, I943. Professors Boswell and Dimmick of Hobart College presented papers on "The Psychology of Knowledge", Professor Marvin Farber of the University of Buffalo presented a paper on "Phenomenology and Its Critics", and Professor Raymond Piper of Syracuse University a paper on "Aesthetics". Frank C. Sharp, Professor Emeritus of Philosophy at the University of Wisconsin, died on May 4 at Madison at the age of 76. He had been a member of the university faculty for forty years and was chairman of the Department of Philosophy at the time of his retirement in I936. The following memorial resolution for Heinrich Gomperz was prepared by Professor R. T. Flewelling and H. Reichenbach in behalf of the Pacific Division of the American Philosophical Association: The members of the Pacific Division of the American Philosophical Asso- ciation note with extreme regret the passing of their esteemed colleague Professor Heinrich Gomperz on December 29, i942 at Los Angeles. Professor Gomperz was a man of sound learning and of great expository ability. He was a worthy successor of his father, the late Theodore Gom- perz, and like him moved familiarly in the range of Greek philosophical scholarship. To this he added a meticulous knowledge of general philosophy both European and Oriental and a prodigious and exact memory. His own philosophical views represented an empiricism inclined to skepticism. He surpassed in a capacity for clarifying ideas and in the ability to impart understanding to others. He spent a long term of service as Professor at the University of Vienna. While he was spending a year (0937) as Visiting Professor in the School of Philosophy of the University of Southern California, his homeland Austria was annexed by Nazi Germany. He refused to conform with the Nazi regime and remained in his position at Southern California until his death, with the exception of a semester at the University of Illinois, and summer sessions at the University of Oregon. We, the members of the Pacific Division, feel keenly the great loss that has befallen the University, the American Philosophical Association, and Philosophy in general. We extend to the bereaved wife and family our most heartfelt sympathy. AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL ASSOCIATION WESTERN DIVISION REPORT ON COMMITTEE ON THE ROLE OF PHILOSOPHY IN HIGHER EDUCATION, APRIL I943 The death, last summer, of its organizer and chairman, Charles Perry, has been a major loss to this committee. The war has also played havoc with its membership. The essential sub-committee on the teaching of 427</page><page sequence="2">428 THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW [VOL. LII. philosophy lost its chairman, D. S. Robinson, to the Navy, and of its regular members only Walker Hill, its secretary, continues. It has been reconstituted, however, and has not only carried on but has expanded its work. And there is reason to expect that in the coming year the work for which the Com- mittee on the Role of Philosophy was established can be developed on a larger scale and under more favorable auspices than in the recent past. The sub-committee continues its placement service, under war-time diffi- culties, and one more appointment has been made from the lists it supplies. its study of the place of philosophy in the junior colleges, undertaken in collaboration with the American Association of Junior Colleges, is under way. It has also instituted an inquiry, among leaders in education, as to the way in which philosophy can most effectively serve in post-war educa- tion. It proposes to prepare a bibliography of literature on the teaching of philosophy, which should be of considerable use in the further study of this subject. It asks a continuance for another year of the appropriation by the Division of $I25 to carry on its work. The committee has endorsed this program and request. It believes that the work of the sub-committee has been of notable value and that its continuance at this time is- imperative. It has become increasingly apparent that the whole problem of the func- tion of philosophy in post-war education requires study and planning now, if we are to be at all prepared to meet the demands and difficulties with which we shall presently be confronted. The chairman of the committee instituted inquiries in January as to the manner in which such a study might best be undertaken and the possibility of securing a subsidy to support it. It was found that suggestions of a similar nature were being made in the Eastern Division and that a Commission was to be set up by the Associa- tion's National Board of Officers for just this purpose, with good prospects of substantial financial support. It has seemed best, therefore, to hold our own plans in abeyance until this Commission is constituted, and its relation to our Committee defined. As soon as these matters are settled, it will be the task of the committee to determine how best, in collaboration in the National Commission, it can contribute to this imperative work of post-war planning.
