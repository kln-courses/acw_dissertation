ORIENTATION TANGUAGE has been copiously and compre- hensively studied by the philosophers, the linguists and philologists, the semanticists, and the literary critics. Some of these have made occasional or incidental reference to it in its social context. Among the social scientists the chief investigators of language have been the eth- nologists and social psychologists. In recent decades some of the sociologists have become aware of its significance in human society, though in the main they have merely skirted the edges of a sociology of language. (2; 3; 4; 7; 11; 12; 21; 23; 25; 28; 40; 52; 64; 68; 70; 86; 102; 103)' These various analyses differ widely in approach, objective, and content, and are largely confined to certain limited or special aspects of the reciprocal relationship between language and society. They do not envisage the "dimensions" of a sociology of language possible with our present knowledge. Of the two major American works dealing with the special "sociologies," Barnes, Becker, and Becker alone, in 1940, anticipated a sociology of language by appending a bibliography on the subject. They introduced the bibliography with a statement which is still prophetic: Out of many diverse sources and interests, sociology of language is emerging as a specialty with a high potential of generalizability. Because of its many angles and because it seems to be involved in all human actions, it promises to become a center of fructifying observation and analysis. Its frontiers are uneven and wide and largely unexplored.2 One of the most distinctive characteristics of man is the fact that he is the language-inventing and language-using animal. Many of his most inimitable forms of expression, all of his objective thinking, most of his daily communication, most of his storage of culture and its transmission in space and time, almost all of his environmental adjustment, socialization, societal organization and social action, rest upon language. It is his primary instrument of enlightenment and, es- pecially as manipulated in the mass media of communication, also a means of confusion and exploitation. During the last half-century sociologists have been developing an array of special disciplines, the "sociologies" of striking and pertinent orders of human experience and endeavor, such as in- vention, knowledge, law, religion, values, the professions, art, science, and industry. The "sociology" of any sociocultural phenomenon has two aspects which are in continual and inseparable interplay and interdependence with each other: (a) the place and functions of the order of phe- nomena, the influences exerted and the effects created by it, and the human uses of it, in the structures, operation, and relations of human society; and, conversely, (b) the human and sociocultural situational factors, textures, and contexts which reflect and determine the nature and operation of the order of phenomena in human society-especially in particular societies * This is a revision of a paper presented at a general session of the Midwest Sociological Society, March 21, 1952. The introduction and the treatment of the com- ponent conceptual elements of a sociology of language have been greatly abridged. Primary emphasis here is on possible studies.

The remainder of this paper will consist of an attempt to present a sort of aerial reconnaissance of a sociology of language in terms of its hypothetical features.3 II. THE CONCEPTUAL COMPONENTS OF A SOCIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE The conceptual elements essential in establishing a "working" theoretical structure for a sociology of language can be most economically presented in the form of an analytical model. Such a device provides a means of (a) systematically stating and developing the minimal fundamental concepts involved; (b) indicating their logical sequence; and (c) revealing their reciprocal relationships.4 1. Experience. Men have a "registering of consciousness" regarding the attributes and con- sequences (to them) of things and events, and of the relationships of the constituent elements of their various environments. These conscious registerings are the certainty and being for human beings, the source of all their knowledge. They interplay continually with all action and reaction. (26, pp. 143-4; 37, pp. 13-21; 47, pp. 466-9; 98, pp. 77-99) 2. Meaning. Experiences arouse interest. Men have recall, imaginings, and reflections about experiences; they estimate and evaluate them. They compare the distinctive properties and qualities (for them) of contrasting classes of things, events, and relations. In brief, they "give" or "attach" meanings to their experiences. These meanings or "abstractions," at various levels of complexity, become man's working realities. Knowledge is experience that has specific "mean- ing" or "significance." (5, pp. 139-57; 8; 9, pp. 249-60; 10, pp. 73-116; 51, pp. 73, 75-82, 122; 58; 86, pp. 31-4; 90; 91) 3. Communication and Action. While experienc- ing is a personal phenomenon, men in their interactions with each other produce within the experience of others a specific experiential complex. They reveal experiences to others, share them with others, and intentionally and purposively exchange and convey informative, expressive, and directive means. Each social system has its "communica- tion net." This the members must have to adjust themselves to each other and to their various environments. But communication is not an end in itself; it is a technique to produce action for self, and action with and against others. (4, pp. 611-30; 9, pp. 240-8; 12; 36; 49; 57, pp. 249-53; 59; 64; 74) 4. Conceptualization. To convey experiences and meanings so that they may be understood, referred to, and acted upon requires that the experiences be conceptualized. The discrete fragments of things, of qualities, of events, of relations between things and of actions, obtained through perception, in order to be "knowable," must be intentionally integrated in conformity with a plan or "rule" into an empirical concept. This is, in effect, an ordered "mental image," an "imaginative syn- thesis." To be communicable between senders and receivers these "imaginative syntheses" must be impersonalized, generalized, and standardized; they must be "collective representations." Thus the concepts of a body of communicants are the products of cooperative and critical abstraction, logical construction, and generalization whereby a "working consensus" of meanings is achieved. (10, pp. 117-81; 19, pp. 26-35; 98, pp. 99-107, 462-4, 516-8) 5. The Symbol-System: Language. The com- munication of men occurs in a very limited degree by means of signs, which they share with other animals; mainly it is through symbols, the dis- tinctively human vehicles. Man, due to his special physiological, psychological, and cultural aptitudes, has invented a category of artifacts in the form of a system of symbois. This consists of conventional- ized gestures, conventionalized articulate sounds, and, very recently in his long career, of word symbols translated into conventionalized marks or writing. Men also have substitutions, combina- tions, and mechanical extensions for conveying these. These symbols are the common, standardized means of signifying and intentionally referring to the classes of everything that man perceives, surmises, imagines, and knows. They make possible, within the groups using them, a "uni- verse of discourse." Their significance and sole raison d'etre depends upon their use as media of exchange. They are the instrumentalities whereby 3 It is rather surprising to note that sociologists have hardly seemed to realize that the rather well-cultivated "sociologies" of knowledge, science, art, and values must be firmly bottomed on a sociology of language- language, the basic instrument of cognition, expres- sion, notation, evaluation, and declaration. 4Cf. Robert K. Merton, Social Theory and Social Structure (Glencoe, Illinois: The Free Press, 1949), pp. 12-16, 55.</page><page sequence="3">TOWARD A SOCIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE III men create a "map" of the territory of experience. Men, the creators of interpretations, meanings, and values, bestow these upon symbols and by means of symbols they convey these. Without symbols men could not recall or record their knowledge, or communicate in space and time. Symbols are the means of orienting person to person, thus functioning as the "directing pivots" of social action. This body of symbols, broadly conceived, constitutes the language-system. In a sense such a system may be thought of as an institu- tionalized structuring of symbols. Every language- system, as an operational social phenomenon, con- sists fundamentally and pre-eminently of speech activity by means of articulate sounds or words. All other symbolic devices relate to words, imply words, are translations, substitutes, or supplements of words-simply media for extending the range and potency of words in space and time. (4, pp. 611-30; 23; 48; 55, pp. 13-18, 46-90, 117-25; 58; 62, pp. 9-109; 65, pp. 160-2; 75, pp. 10-16; 78; 90, pp. 13-30; 94, pp. 30, 77-9, 83, 105; 98, pp. 108-15; 99) 6. The Language-Community. The people who interact, communicate, and to some extent cohere by means of a given language-system compose a community of lesser or greater extent and com- pactness, and of some degree of cultural uni- formity. "Communication" and "community" have a common root; this reflects the indispensable reciprocal relationship of the two; each is counter- part of the other. The people of a community have a common experiential and conceptual life, and hence must have common language behavior. The language is also one of the major connective tissues of the group or related groups. A given language community may vary in extent from a small, localized tribe of several hundred members, through larger regional areas, to the language "empires" involving groups in several continents. There may be a considerable range of ethnicity of the people involved, and in the institutions of a large language-community. It may or may not be a political entity; it may include all or parts of several political entities. It has a center (or centers) which influences, even dominates, the words and speech-forms used. The radiated speech-forms have influence and are accepted because they have great utility, great prestige, marked vogue or "cultural correctness." Within the larger language-community with its "standard" language, there are usually local or regional sub-languages (e.g., dialects), "special" languages (e.g., argots, technical terminologies, and so on) used by special groups for their own special purposes, and sometimes "marginal" or "mixed" languages (e.g., "Pennsylvania Dutch,'" "Brooklynese"). These dialects and special lan- guages, however, while not necessarily reciprocally comprehensible in their entirety, are all ety- mologically related to the standard language, and consist merely of special variations, special addi- tions, or the bestowing of special refinements of meaning upon terms. They are special features of the community "universe of discourse." (5, pp. 42-56, 444-95; 32, pp. 38-140; 45, pp. 112-23, 173-98; 92, pp. 260-79) 7. The Context of the Physical, Cultural, and Social Situation. Languages are both socially determined and socially determinative. Every language-community is part or all of a given group, or even contiguous with part or all of a society. Every society has its own special char- acteristics, and its language has a pragmatic character and fundamental utilitarian functions. The content, form, and uses of the language of each community mirror its physical setting, its historical events and contacts, its cultural level and mental climate, its cultural history and texture. The language carries the definitions of all situations, is the dissecting agent by which the structures, functions, processes, relations, and factors of the general and particular world are laid bare. By means of it all of the environ- ments are objectified, and all of the actions of the group or society are conducted. Thus it also reflects the situational imperatives and happenings, and every feature of its societal organization and operation. The language of the group or community is an index of most of its characteristics. Conversely, the very form, extent, and com- plexity of the cultural and social structures, and the functions these perform vary with and are affected by the language system. The defects, distortions, and inadequacies of language, or the inadequate command of language, retard cultural development and culture acquisition, and impair societal organization and operation. Furthermore, language and society must change in parallel fashion. New societal needs and new cultural experiences make it necessary to enlarge the resources of the language by the borrowing or actual invention of new vocabulary, formulae and</page><page sequence="4">112 SOCIAL FORCES phrases, the extension of meaning of some terms, and the rendering of greater specificity of meaning to others. Some terms and forms become obsolete and are lost or deleted. Thus the language-system and the sociocultural texture and context of a society or even a group cannot be separated. Each reflects the other; each is operationally related to the other; each is both cause and effect of the other. (26, pp. 1-17; 29; 31, pp. 55-8, 429-31; 45, pp. 8-11, 45-6; 49; 68; 75, pp. 211-35; 82; 99, pp. 87-108; 96) III. THE DIMENSIONS OF A SOCIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE AS INDICATED BY AREAS OF EXAMINATION A fairly comprehensive overview of the sociology of language can be obtained at this stage of its development by presenting a series of statements of a hypothetical character. These are based on what seem to be rather well-established though unsystematized facts and principles, and point to important areas of study.5 Merely presenting the statements provides "windows" for obtaining an insight into the possible substance and dimensions of the sociology of language. The examination will be in accord with the two major facets of the "sociology" of an order of phenomena, indicated above. Unavoidably some of the propositions will overlap. A. Studies in the Societal Functions, Uses, and Effects of Language 1. The use of words in the communication- system examined in terms of its ideal-typical components: source of information, transmitting vehicles, channels, receivers, and destination of information. (26, pp. 1-68; 57, pp. v, 1-10; 59; 63; 73) 2. "Standard" language as the basis of common societal organization: economic, political, religious, educational, and including all participation, co- operation, and planning. (12, pp. 80-90; 15, pp. 52-3; 25; 26, pp. 69-81, 105-10; 28; 40; 44, pp. 94-172; 57, pp. 223-75; 60, pp. 204-10, 214-6, 242-4; 64, pp. 763-6; 71; 74; 82; 86; 92, pp. 260-79) 3. Common language as a symbol, welding instrument, and maintenance agent of group consciousness, rapport, solidarity, and integration. (28; 45, 71-3, 173-98; 68; 74; 86; 92, pp. 240-1) 4. The "attention categories" of language, especially the "names" used, which function as the "pointers out" or indicators of what is known and significant in the environments of a people, what they are sensitive to, the reflectors of their "psyche," culture level, and "world view." (29; 31, pp. 55-7; 75, pp. 221-35) 5. Language as the agent for instrumentalizing the "action (or behavior) categories" of a people: the language forms by which emotions are ex- pressed, knowledge is conveyed, evaluative processes occur, questioning (calling out reciprocal response) takes place; the ways promotive or incitive behavior is brought about by declaration, proclamation, exhortation, provocation (e.g., "fighting words") and command; the linguistic means by which work is done. (15, pp. 311-57; 17; 26, pp. 82-136; 45, pp. 45-6; 60, pp. 95-128; 68; 91, pp. 134-68) 6. Language, both oral and written, as a means of cultural accumulation and cultural transmis- sion: as an economizer of effort, as a space-binding and time-binding agent; the differences between oral and written forms with respect to types and levels of cultural materials that can be accumu- lated and transmitted (e.g., proverbs vs. abstract essays and scientific formulae). (74; 75, pp. 160-1; 86) 7. Common or "standard" language as a pri- mary factor in cultural and social assimilation. (3, pp. 151-3; 31, pp. 201-2; 32, pp. 38-83; 82; 86) 8. Language as a factor in ecological organiza- tion: influence of centers of language dominance, correlation of speech and areal geocultural diver- sities, linguistic enclaves (or "pockets"), and so on. (5, pp. 321-45; 40; 86) 9. The patois, argot, or cant of underworld groups, the language of the courts and of various industries, the technical terminologies of profes- sional and technological groups (doctors, soldiers, engineers), the colorful language of crafts and trades (actors, longshoremen, railroaders, de- tectives, etc.), the speech forms of ruralites and urbanites, of illiterates and highly educated, and of different ideological groups (Communists, trade-unionists, religious sectarians), the termi- 5 The statements which follow, in large part, have been presented or implied by linguists, philosophers, semanticists, anthropologists, social psychologists, students of communication and mass information, and sociologists. All of their contributions have been strained through the sociological sieve. The propositions require further scientific investigation. The references in each case are offered mainly as starting materials for further study.</page><page sequence="5">TOWARD A SOCIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 113 nologies of scientists and artists, the sub-languages of sex and age (teen-agers slang), groups, and so on, (a) as special utilitarian and monopolistic means of communication, and (b) as agents of unity and special identification for these particular groups. (32, pp. 149-65; 40; 53; 69;: 74; 89; 92, pp. 240-59) 10. Language, especially the above "special" and "secret" languages, as a means of societal differentiation and stratification: between castes, estates and socioeconomic classes, between racial and nationality groups, occupational-professional groups, age groups, sex groups, urban and rural populations, and educational levels, and with respect to dialects between sections and regions. (17; 32, pp. 141-8; 40; 68; 82) 11. The degree of universality of standard language and dialects at different stratification levels: the hypothesis that upper social strata (cultural, administrative, etc.), within and be- tween societies, are likely to speak the same or mutually understandable languages, while the lower levels are split apart into dialects. (88, p. 165) 12. "Taboo words," "linguistic geography," and "linguistic ethnocentrism" as limitations upon, even barriers to communication, coopera- tion, organization, and planning. (5, pp. 321-44; 26, pp. 251-3; 31, pp. 239-41; 32, pp. 149-65; 74; 88, pp. 124-5; 90, pp. 76-8) 13. Language as a means of "locating" persons among social, "cultural," and political coordinates; based upon functioning vocabulary, accent ("Oxford," "Cockney"), style, dialect, argot, "technical" language, nuances of meaning and value, education evidenced, and so on. (17; 58; 68; 100, pp. 206-40) 14. Language, by epithets and derogatory descriptive phrases ("scare words," "smear words," Schimpfworte such as nigger-lover, socialist, bolshevik, bureaucracy) as a means of "branding" or adversely labelling or stereotyping persons and things, acts and incidents, and thus directing and canalizing the feelings and sentiments of the community, fostering prejudices, maintaining (for users) conventions, statuses, and roles. (17; 45, pp. 207-15; 68) 15. Language as a dissociative agent: (a) the use of language for deliberate and non-deliberate discrimination, isolation, and exclusion, by in- groups against out-groups, by internal majorities against minorities (to create and maintain both horizontal and vertical social distance), and by minorities in self-defense; (b) language as an agent of dissociation between societies, nations, and cultures, due to differences in phonetic systems and grammatical and semantic categories. (21; 28, pp. 120-4; 40; 45, pp. 199-220; 60, pp. 210-2; 68; 86; 87) 16. The effect of the "givens" of the vocabulary, grammar and syntax of a given language-system in determining what is admitted to consciousness, and in stereotyping, confining, "blinding," groov- ing, and channeling thought and social action; related to this, the social effects of persistently used but outmoded words, forms, and meanings ("word fetishism," "tyranny of words," "schiz- ophrenia of expression," tendency toward a "closed system"). (3, pp. 155-6; 10, pp. 18-29, 244-349; 21; 35, pp. 112-27; 82) 17. Language as an agent of disorganization: as deliberately manipulated in disagreement, competition, conflict, and exploitation in the way of artfully managing word connotations and in the distortion of meanings. (45, pp. 199-220.) 18. Language as a vehicle for social influence and social control: the "spell-creating" effect of the "magic of words" among primitives and those not so primitive; the intensifying of traditional attitudes and prejudices, the creation of new attitudes and beliefs, the suppression of truth or partial use of truth, the spread of false doctrine, through the modification or creation and repetition of words, phrases, and meanings, by advertisers, televisers, patroiteers, dictators, propagandists, etc., in mass communication; the general sig- nificance of symbols in social control. (15, pp. 41-2; 17; 26, pp. 100-16; 48, pp. 77-91; 57, pp. 263-9; 60, pp. 210-2; 86) 19. The use of language in social movements: the elimination of derogatory terms (nigger in civil rights movements), the development of special terms or meanings (citizen of the French Revolu- tion, comrade of socialism and communism); switching to a common language (administrative German by Luther, Hebrew by the Zionists). (17) 20. Language as the key agent in social learning and the development of a socialized personality. (7; 11, pp. 56-9; 12; 20; 21; 25; 35, pp. 243-67; 57, pp. 159-73; 68; 71; 72; 74) 21. Language as a "vehicle" of personality: the nature and range of the verbal behavior of individuals as a reflection or disclosure of the unique facets of personality, e.g., quantity and</page><page sequence="6">114 SOCIAL FORCES quality of vocabulary, directness or indirectness of speech, facility or halting nature, degree of con- sistency and coordination, "slips of the tongue," lisping, stuttering and other speech disorders as reflectors of mental disorders, puns used, in- flections, intonations, and pronunciations, omis- sions, substitutes used, reflections of status and role frustrations and satisfactions, vulgarisms, imaginative uses of terms and phrases, suitability to situations, and so on. (7; 27; 35, pp. 243-67; 72; 77) 22. The social and cultural uses and effects of the increasing spread and utilization of certain "standard" languages (e.g., English): political, religious, commercial, educational, literary, ideological, and so on. 23. The significance of language differences in international communication, organization, and peace. (6, pp. 409-47) B. Studies in the Sociocultural (and Geocultural) Influencing and Determination of the Linguistic Content of Language-Communities6 1. The determinative influence of the Weltan- schauung, i.e., the kinds, limitations, and levels of comprehension and analysis of the world about us upon linguistic structures and categories; language as a product or reflector of man's "cul- tural capacity," his "structure of knowledge," and of the "cultural situation context." In terms of: a) Conceptions of mystical happenstance or ani- mistic transformation of reality (things, events, and actions) and the subjective and anthropomorphic perspectives of primitives on the one hand vs. the objective, scientific cause-and-effect analysis with its requirements of logical schemata involving a high degree of abstraction, adequacy and precision of ter- minology, conceptualization and definition, specificity of taxonomy, and clarity of generalization, appropri- ately facilitated by adequate symbols (words, mathe- matical symbols, etc.), and essential refinements of grammar, syntax, and semantics. b) The reflection of interests, predilections, values, usages, and utilities of a given people in their language. For example, Arabic has over 6,000 words referring to camel and his equipment-color, bodily structure, sex, age, movement, condition, etc.; but tomobile covers all makes and models of cars, trucks, buses, and tractors. c) Linguistic means of space and time reference, the differences in time and space categories and distinc- tions, and the fixation of space and time relations, due to range of spatial and temporal awareness. For ex- ample, many primitives have limited spatial awareness (no need to refer to objects 282 million light-years away), and little or no conception of time as a flow and unity (but conceived only in its individual and mo- mentary phases). d) "Number systems" involving a comprehension of amounts and degrees of "plurality" in conforming with needs and desires with respect to "countable" objects and developed schemes of numbering. For example, Central Australian tribes were unable to count beyond four or five and did not need to; the Chuckchee counted by hand and foot digits and in terms of these (ten means two hands, twenty means one man) while we must keep account of a national debt and other "astronomies" and "geometries." (10, pp. 58-67; 25; 36; 41; 42; 43; 49; 68; 74; 76; 79; 93; 96; 98, pp. 117-39) 2. The determinative influence of the history of a language-community in terms of its contacts and the external influences upon it due to such factors as migration, invasion, immigration, the extension of means of communication and trans- portation, industrialization and urbanization, business and trade relations, colonization and political extension, the spread of literature and religion, and so on, in the "hybridization" of its language. In terms of: a) "Loan words" and "loan transaltions"-new linguistic nomenclatures (economic, political, religious, scientific, technological) and new linguistic categories, always selectively developed. b) Some phonetic, grammatical, analogical, and semantic modifications, with replacements and addi- tions of new overtones. c) New "strata" of words and phrases reflecting new social and cultural relations. The linguistic modifications are affected by types of contact conditions: a) Whether the invaders are a comparatively small body (in which case they usually take on the language of the country), or a large body coming en masse (in which case the natives seem to succumb to the language of the foreign majority, and the indigenous speech is regarded as servile), or the immigrants come in scattered bands at different times (in which case, they are absorbed in the native speech, though exer- cising minor influence in the way of selected contribu- tions). b) The relative cultural and social-economic- political levels of the contacting peoples. 6 Due to the fact that this aspect of the sociology of language has been less developed than the preceding, certain suggested studies are presented in greater detail.</page><page sequence="7">TOWARD A SOCIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 115 c) The temporary or permanent nature of the con- tact. d) Whether the contact is through military-political conquest (with forceful imposition of a language), on the humdrum plane of business and trade relations, or in the form of a tranquil interchange of spiritual goods such as science, art, and religion. c) The density and intensity of the intercommunica- tion generally.7 (5, pp. 444-60; 7, pp. 216-20; 30; 31, pp. 205-20; 40; 56; 74; 88, pp. 142-4; 92, pp. 280-96) 3. The determinative influence of geocultural factors: localism, regional determinism, and the influence of physical barriers in the creation and maintenance of "linguistic areas." (The Indian proverb: Speech changes every few miles.) (1; 5, pp. 321-45; 16; 17; 33; 38; 39) 4. The determinative effect of internal social structure and relations upon language. a) Social differentiation resulting in and perpetuated by fostered linguistic differences: the jargons and "special languages" mentioned above. In the terms of Webster, the cartoonist, different groups do not speak each other's "langwidge." b) Social stratification producing, even necessi- tating, special language forms: terms for status in- cumbents and status roles (e.g., sire, lord, peasant) and other "respect-variations"; distinctive languages among different strata (e.g., in Java, Noko is the language of the nobles, while the commoners speak Kromo; in medieval Europe the ruling estates spoke "courtly" Latin and French, the commoners conversed by means of local patois); language "style," as culti- vated by upper classes as a badge of superiority. c) Language differences reflecting separation and drifting apart because of political, ethnic, racial, religious, and other barriers: the dialects of socially discriminated against and voluntarily isolated groups. d) The attempts of minority groups, under condi- tions of social-political-cultural dominance, to erect their traditional language ("linguistic revival") into a fully credited medium of cultural and political dis- course (e.g., Gaelic in Ireland, French in French Canada, Hebrew by the Zionists). (24, pp. 121-66; 32, pp. 141- 64; 40; 68; 75, pp. 161-2; 86; 88, pp. 126-35; 90, pp. 57-76; 92, pp. 245-59) 5. The effects of internal social and cultural change upon the language of a people. In a static ("sacred") society the impetus to linguistic innovation is slight; there tends to be only Sapir's "drift." In a dynamic ("secular") society language seems to change vis-a-vis social changes (though with a "lag"). A free and a developing people produce much new language required for ever- changing situations, and also produce wide-spread uniformities. a) Democratization and individualization bring an erosion of status-relations and a parallel lessening of "snobbery of speech," with the devaluation and vul- garization of titles and forms of address. For example, sire becomes sir, master becomes mister (terms ap- plicable to any decent male), and Ma Dame becomes ma'am. b) Facilitation of transportation and communica- tion, industrialization and urbanization, the increasing size of political and economic units, the disappearance of political obstacles, universal education, the growing interdependence of organizations and areas, breaks down and makes obsolete much folk and primary group language and tends toward the blending and uniforma- tion of language. Involved also is the requirement of a "standard" language with "correctness" of usage over wider areas. c) The obsolescence of social situations (things, events, relations, etc.) or the change of fashion in various fields involves a linguistic law of diminishing returns, and brings about the disappearance of related denotive words and meanings. For example, fief and candle-mold appear only in history books. d) The continuous effects of the assimilation of diverse ethnic, political, and cultural elements in a country like ours in the way of incorporation of words and the blending of speech forms. e) The effects of a new political-ideological epoch. For example, St. Petersburg to Petrograd to Leningrad, Christiana to Oslo. f) The effects of the rise of new cults of all sorts and the development of social movements in producing new language. g) The influence of individuals: Shakespeare in- troducing many new words and phrases into English; new metaphor by Ring Lardner and sportswriters in general-the "linguistic whimsicality" of one man. h) New needs, new discoveries and inventions, and new knowledge find the folk language inadequate and necessitate the modification of old terms and meanings, and the devising of much new language. The need, for example, of language for the atomic, supersonic speed, and radar age; global war; language for interpenetrating international relations. There is especially scientific and technological development in a society dominated by scientific thoughtways and techniques and cor- I The classic "model" for such historical studies is that by Otto Jespersen, the Dane, in the Growth and Structure of the English Language, which, in its ob- jectivity and comprehensiveness, is similar to that of American race relations by Gunnar Myrdal of Sweden.</page><page sequence="8">116 SOCIAL FORCES responding development of vocabulary, phrases, formu- lae, and so on, to symbolize and express these.8 i) The general tendency in a language-community which is also a "going," developing society, in obedience to the human predilection for economy of effort, of modifying or eliminating its language instruments which are clumsy, insufficient, intricate, capricious and difficult, and of moving in the direction of greater simplicity, clarity, regularity, ease, and pliancy of expression and of preciseness of meanings; for example, horseless carriage to automobile to car. (5, pp. 476-85; 17; 24, pp. 250-74; 46; 50; 68; 74; 84; 88, pp. 123-4; 90, pp. 65-85; 101, pp. 31-2; 102) 6. The influence of the size, structure, degree and complexity of organization, functions, and channels and directions of communication of groups and associations: the language of small groups vs. that of large-scale formal organizations. (40: 57, pp. 254-63) 7. The interplay of sociocultural context and language, evidenced in: a) The difficulty of translating between unrelated languages due to the diversity both of the experiential and semantic worlds and the symbolic worlds with their terminologies, and grammatical and syntactical structures ("Every translator is in part a traitor"). b) The necessity of acquiring new language terms, forms, and meanings when moving to a different region or society. c) The new cultural and social world that opens up for one when learning a new language. (90, pp. 87-108; 98, pp. 108-10) 8. Language as a reflection of the mysticism and the moral and conventional attitudes of a people. Notably: a) The "taboo words" relating to taboos in the fields of religion, sex, excretion, dress, eating, and social status. Some grow out of verbal superstition and belief in "word magic" and are related to areas of life which are mystically untouchable; e.g., names of deities. Others involve avoidance of "moral obscenities"; e.g., our famous "four-letter words" for the elimination of excreta and sex intercourse which, incidentally, are not to be found in the Oxford English Dictionary or Webster's Unabridged. b) The euphemisms-the polite substitutes, the circumlocutions, and the veiling and toning down, such as go to the bathroom or restroom or Heifer's corral, go to bed with, the Almighty; the disguising of the sinister implications of death by kick the bucket, check in, pushing up daisies, pass away; limb for legs; bosom for breast; intestinal fortitude for guts, and so on. (25; 31, pp. 239-41; 88, pp. 124-5; 90, pp. 76-8) 9. Language as an expression of the novelty psyche of a people, as evidenced in the desire to break away from the commonplace, drab, and trite by producing specialities and superiorities of speech. a) Slang ("linguistic sport and luxury") introducing words to suit particular occasions (sometimes substi- tutes for tabooed words); terms with more flavor and raciness than standard ones (nut for head, broad for woman); slang as "jesting language" with humorous elements (old soak), facetious elements (gink or bird for man), or a derogatory element (haun, frog, gook). b) Words introduced by wits (G. B. Shaw, Ring Lardner). c) "Snob-language" continuously produced as a badge of distinction and superiority (my de-ah). (24, pp. 363-8; 32, pp. 149-64; 88, pp. 124-5) 10. The social origin of speech in the child: the social conditioning process as it relates to taking on tones in reflex cries, pleasure and play in babbling, acquisition of vocabulary and sentence construction, acquisition of ability to discriminate between meanings, speech correction, especially pronunciation at the hands of parents, siblings, playmates, teachers, and so on. (10, pp. 49-57; 8 An illumination and positively not a defense of symbol making in science is in order at this point. Scientists are responsible for devising consistent terminologies and special skeleton languages in order to communicate useful and verifiable formulations suitable for purposes of organized, cooperative work- manship (e.g., the rich and articulate nomenclature of botany). As a science advances in its conquest of its phenomenal field, its statements become more purely designative, better confirmed, and better systematized. Hence it must give specific and refined meanings to the current terms of ordinary language in order to divest them of their ambiguities and in- consistencies of meaning (e.g., the special standard meanings in physics attached to mass, velocity, force). Equally essential is the invention of new symbols to refer to new products of observation and experimenta- tion, since adequate and specific symbolism is as es- sential an instrument as microscopes and telescopes and cyclotrons. A science must have sharp and suitable tools. Doing this is not the reckless proliferation of terminology. It is "jargon," "gobbledegook," "cabal- ism," and "esoteric symbolism" only to the uninitiated whose vocabularies and understandings do not go beyond the newspapers and "best sellers." At the same time, highly personalized, so-called "scientific" ver- balization must be avoided since this creates all of the hazards and problems of translation.</page><page sequence="9">TOWARD A SOCIOLOGY OF LANGUAGE 117 12, pp. 45-50, 52-4, 61-9, 80-6; 44; 51; 54; 55, pp. 49-50, 122-3, 135-226; 57, pp. 140-73; 66; 67; 68; 72; 75, pp. 7-9; 102) 11. The lack of human participation and the failure to develop language facility as in the case of "feral" or otherwise isolated children. (13: 14: 22; 23; 28; 83; 85; 87; 103) 12. The effects of the political, economic, literary, religious, philosophical and/or technical influence, or even supremacy, of a people, a place, or an institutionalized organization, in making their dialect or language the chief language for various purposes of a far-flung communicating area (the development of "language-empires"). For example, the ascendency of the vulgarized Attic dialect, the Koing, throughout the East Mediterranean area from the Hellinistic period to the end of the ninth century A. D.; Latin, the vernacular of the early city-state Rome, as the language of the Roman Empire and for centuries the common language of the Western World; Chinese flooding the vocabularies of the Koreans, Japanese, and Annamites for centuries; the Arabic of the Koran among the ethnically and regionally diverse peoples of the Mohammedan "belt" of the world; in the present century, English or Anglo-American as the native language of 260,000,000 persons, the government language of nearly 700,000,000 persons, and its increasing sway as the chief commercial, diplomatic, and scientific language of the world. (6, pp. 187-447; 25; 32, pp. 46-73; 61; 81; 92, pp. 260-79) 13. Due to increasing international contact, the development of world-wide needs and coopera- tion, the increasing interdependence, and, at the same time the existence of highly diverse language- families emphasizing the "Curse of Babel" and causing all manner of "world confusion," the proposal of "language planning" and the con- struction by "language engineering" of a simpli- fied and readily learned neutral "interlanguage" or "international language" in the form of a second or "auxiliary" language as an instrument of universal communication for the peoples of the world.
