<plain_text><page sequence="1">HORACE'S CRIME PASSIONNEL by W. Victor Wortley in Corneille's Horace the hero, Horace, kills his sister, Camille. With this precipitate action he falls from the stature of a hero to the level of a criminal. The play itself furnishes the reader with an abun- dance of reasons - and of reasoning - for Horace's killing of Camille. Indeed, we appear to have quite a comprehensive picture of the crime mainly due to the courtroom-type atmosphere Corneille creates in the last act. Valére is the plaintiff, Vieil Horace finds himself defending Horace, while Tulle, the king, arbitrates. During the proceedings the "accused" hardly bothers to defend himself, being preoccupied with matters other than his own life. The air of this pseudo-courtroom fairly drips with emotional reasoning (used for and against Horace by Vieil Horace and Valére), and with pragmatic political considerations. But when all these are examined, something still remains unexplained. Despite the superficially neat resolution of the play, a feeling that some important considerations remain untouched by any of the characters persists. Would it be possible to distill the political and emotional reasons for the crime and discover what really motivates Horace? A closer look at the circum- stances uncovers some nuances suggesting that Horace's crime is a crime passionnel . After the murder of Camille Horace finds himself with only one defender, his father, Vieil Horace, whose dedication seems limitless. Vieil Horace has, of course, many readily visible reasons for wishing to save his son's life. A strong familial tie binds them since, of all his children, only Horace remains. From a politically expedient point of view one can make a good case for his (Horace's) usefulness to the state. Vieil Horace addresses everyone in an emotional plea for 319</page><page sequence="2">320 ROMANCE NOTES his son's life. One ought to note, however, that when father addresses son directly he says: "Ne hais donc plus la vie, ou du moins vis pour moi" (1727). Live for me ? One might wonder why - apart from the reasons already stated. Again, although unstated explicitly, another reason forces itself on the reader s attention. The old man now lives vicariously through the son. If the son dies, the father will cease to exist, for all intents and purposes. Only through his son has he any identity at all. So Vieil Horace's sometimes emotional, sometimes pragmatic, plea for his son's life has more in it than immediately meets the eye. The first few lines of Vieil Horace's address to the king, Tulle, indicate the tone of his defense, a defense based mainly on attack: Un premier mouvement ne fut jamais un crime; Et la louange est due, au lieu du châtiment, Quand la vertu produit ce premier mouvement. Aimer nos ennemis avec idolâtrie, De rage en leur trépas maudire la patrie, Souhaiter à l'Etat un malheur infini, C'est ce qu'on nomme crime, et ce qu'il a puni. Le seul amour de Rome a sa main animée: Il serait innocent s'il l'avait moins aimée. (1648-56) But the very opening line will merit particular attention, as we shall see. However, despite Vieil Horace's lengthy and impassioned plea Tulle summarily rejects his syllogistic argument, making particular reference to the father's initial point: Un premier mouvement qui produit un tel crime Ne saurait lui servir d'excuse légitime. (1735-36) Tulle fails to acknowledge the particular sort of crime involved here. However, when Vieil Horace talks about un premier mouvement , consciously or unconsciously he puts his son's crime into a very special category, a category generally reserved for crimes of passion. Such a crime presupposes that someone has been offended - a wife, a husband, a mistress, a lover. A crime of passion also suggests the temporary absence of logic, the dominance (however temporary) of the heart over the head and is not at all typical of Corneille's early tragedies. Horace's anger does not erupt on behalf of a person, but</page><page sequence="3">Horace's "crime passionnel" 321 on behalf of an abstraction, Rome. This should in no way invalidate the supposition that his crime remains a crime of passion even if he himself is not fully aware of it. When Vieil Horace talks of a premier mouvement , he uses the expression without realizing that his very choice of words suggests a clearly defined attitude with regard to his sons act. This attitude, however, lies beneath many layers of more immediately evident attitudes. The play offers many instances of Horace's fanatical dedication to the state. When he says: Mourir pour le pays est un si digne sort Qu'on briguerait en foule une si belle mort. (441-42) the reader finds it not at all unusual in Corneille's early tragedies. But Curiace constantly counterpoints Horace's particular brand of patriotism with less fanatical lines such as: Je rends graces aux Dieux de n'être pas Romain, Pour conserver encor quelque chose d'humain. (481-82) Parallel and cross tensions thus set up between Curiace/ Camille and Horace/ Sabine demand comparison. What Curiace feels for Ca- mille, Horace feels for the state - and not his wife, Sabine. Horace's first "mistress" becomes (in a subtle way) Rome, Sabine being relegated to an inferior position in his particular hierarchy of values. His dedication to his "mistress" - Rome - is hammered home in a series of terse, uncompromising lines, a selection of which gives a good idea of his unquestioning dedication. When he learns that Rome has chosen him he says: J'accepte aveuglément cette gloire avec joie (492) and Rome a choisi mon bras, je n'examine rien. (498) Just as in affairs of love, no reasoning appears here. We are con- scious only of absolutely blind dedication. Any links that may have existed between him and Curiace abruptly dissolve: Albe vous a nommé, je ne vous connais plus. (502)</page><page sequence="4">322 ROMANCE NOTES From this point in the play Horace severs - or else prepares the ground for severing - all ties with all other humans around him. The ties with Curiace are, therefore, of little account compared with his ties to his "mistress," Rome. The marital links with Sabine are scarcely more important when she tries to put herself between her husband and Rome. He dismisses her coldly and unceremoniously: Va-ťen, et ne rends plus la victoire douteuse; La dispute déjà m'en est assez honteuse: (675-76) The other humans with whom he has contact are his father and his sister. Let us look at the case of the father first, just after Camille's death. Valere, whose attraction to Camille manifests itself early in the play, demands that Horace pay for his crime with his life. Tulle thereupon calls on Horace to defend himself, but Horace makes little effort to do so. In a long speech (1535-94) Horace speaks like a man who has already accepted death, who has already renounced all ideas of living. He holds nothing against Valere, who has so urgently demanded his death. In fact, he agrees with Valere, save for the one detail that becomes the raison d'etre for the whole speech that terminates with a couplet addressed to the king, which forms, in- cidentally, Horace's last lines in the play: Permettez, ô grand Roi, que de ce bras vainqueur Je m'immole à ma gloire, et non pas à ma sœur. (1593-94) The reason for his dying becomes much more important than death itself. To die for his gloire - that is, for the defense of Rome - represents something very important to him. To die for having killed his sister would be an ignominious way to leave this life. He com- pletely neglects any consideration for his old father. One can feel sympathy for the father who may lose his last child, but one cannot overlook some of the not-too-altruistic reasons behind the fathers arguments. Yet Horace, young and vigorous, can accept his death as though he were the only one to whom it meant anything. That leaves Camille, the sharpest thorn in Horace's side, and the person to whom he reacts most strongly because she resembles him</page><page sequence="5">HORACES "CRIME PASSIONNEL." 323 in so many ways. Perhaps foreseeing her reaction to his possible victory, he takes pains, before the battle, to instruct her in her conduct regardless of the battle's outcome (517-30). The speech in itself is not ungenerous, although the polished Cornellian rhetoric - all the time vaunting virtue and honor - encloses a somber warn- ing to Camille. But the warning has no effect, since Camille indeed proves to be as intransigent as her brother (a trait he surely recog- nized, since he found it necessary to give her the warning). After the battle, she heaps invective on him, calling him barbate (1278), and tigre altéré de sang, accusing him of lâcheté (1293), and brutalité (1294). But only when she attacks his "mistress," Rome, in an outburst beginning: Rome, Tunique object de mon ressentiment! Rome, à qui vient ton bras d'immoler mon amant! Rome qui ťa vu naître, et que ton cœur adore! Rome enfin que je hais parce qu'elle ťhonore! (1301-04) does Horace draw his sword, claims that patience must give way to reason, and kills her. It is Camille, and only Camille, who refers to Horace's attraction to Rome in anthropomorphic terms (1303) - the personified Rome that witnessed his birth and "que ton cœur adore." Similarities between the members of the Horace family are too obvious to dwell upon. Each person acts precipitously, and each shows a marked inability to compromise. Where love and dedication do appear, they exist as absolutes. With calculated premeditation Camille deliberately provokes Horace after the battle. She knows that she is attacking where it will hurt him most (see 1247 ff.), and must have known well what the outcome would be. Both of them play for the ultimate stakes. Vieil Horace is willing to call his daughters provocation criminal in order to save his son's life. Yet he, too, finds the shame of having killed a sister damages a warrior's reputation gratuitously. Je ne plains point Camille: elle était criminelle; Je me tiens plus à plaindre, et je te plains plus qu'elle: Moi, d'avoir mis au jour un cœur si peu romain; Toi, d'avoir par sa mort déshonoré ta main.</page><page sequence="6">324 ROMANCE NOTES Je ne la trouve point injuste ni trop prompte; Mais tu pouvais, mon fils, ťen épargner la honte: Son crime, quoique énorme et digne du trépas, Etait mieux impuni que puni par ton bras. (1411-18) But with Horace there is no temporizing. He steps beyond the bounds envisaged by any other character in the play. For him there is neither rationalization nor convoluted justification. Camille's actions merit death, and he has no hesitation about being the executioner. Corneille was very familiar with Spanish drama of the sixteenth and early seventeenth centuries, and was well acquainted with the concept of honor being used as a trigger for dramatic action. Killing, in order to protect what one considered to be one's honor was, by and large, an acceptable procedure in Mediterranean lands. The crime passionnel appears with greater frequency (or, at least, one seems to hear more about it) in these lands and also appears to be treated with more tolerance and understanding than in northern countries. Keeping this in mind, one cannot overlook the fact that, at the end of the play, Horace is allowed to live. The king outlines the mainly political reasons for sparing his life. At the same time he rejects the emotional and generally specious reasons pleaded by Vieil Horace. So on the surface it would appear that Horace lives "pour servir l'état." Yet, behind what seem to be the most obvious pragmatic considerations, Horace's crime takes on the overtones of a crime passionnel because he conducts, in a sense, an affair with Rome. Horace, the dedicated warrior turned criminal, lives because he has protected the honor of his "mistress," Rome. And should there be any reservations about accepting Rome in the role of Horace's mistress, one ought to remember that in Corneille's two earliest tragedies (Le Cid and Horace) the old fathers allude to the folly of 'wasting time with women,' while secluding themselves in the male domain and manifesting great apprehension about the power of women's tears - e.g., Vieil Horace when he finds Horace and Curiace with their women before the battle: "Et perdez- vous encor le temps avec des femmes?" (680). Feelings that would otherwise be directed towards woman are sublimated and, in the case of Horace, resurface with his abstract mistress, Rome. So, while not rejecting all the most obvious political reasons for the crime, one must move them to one</page><page sequence="7">HORACES "CRIME PASSIONNEL" 325 side and consider one simple explanation. Vieil Horace's language makes the initial suggestion. The sequence of Horace's acts confirms the original suspicion. The crime, instead of being a crime committed in the name of political expediency, is a crime passionnel consum- mated in the heat of the moment. Horace's sister, Camille, has insulted his mistress, Rome, and Horace kills her to avenge Rome's sullied name. For a man who can conduct himself with such sang- froid on most occasions, the killing of a sister poses questions that cannot all be answered with cold, pragmatic reasoning. Horace's crime passionnel is the logical by-product of the environment that has produced and nurtured him. University of Washington</page></plain_text>
