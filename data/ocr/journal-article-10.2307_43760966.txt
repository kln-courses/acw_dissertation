<plain_text><page sequence="1">Social Work Models By B. W. Pashley Lecturer in the Department of Social Administration, University of Hull THE question of the scientific and theoretical integrity of social work (or more accurately, of social casework) remains open. How far scientific method should, need, can be (let alone is) employed, how far there is a sound theoretical foundation, how far there is agreement about the nature of that founda- tion - such issues are by now old hat. Even so, they have prompted social workers to defend their genius against rebuke, though it would seem that, like Hamlet's mother, they have protested too much. It is, for example, almost ten years since Barbara Wootton observed that " modern definitions of ' social casework,' if taken at their face value, involve claims to powers which verge upon omniscience and omnipotence." 1 More recently Paul Haimos has issued a deflationary, albeit sympathetic, demonstration that social workers lean con- siderably more on faith than on theory, such that whereas " in the technologies there is no doubt that what we apply is science . . . in counselling there is a great deal of doubt." 2 Writers having a more " inside " position, on the other hand, have of late been adopting a more " realistic " stance and trying to get the whole business into better perspective. Thus in a standard text-book Noel Timms has stressed that scientific tools and theoreti- cal knowledge, although not sufficient, are none the less necessary conditions for effec- tive service.3 Peter Leonard has within the last year argued strongly for the teaching of scientific method to social work students to assist their " coming to grips . . . with the nature of scientific explanation," to under- line the vital importance of " evidence," and to provide a framework whereby students might better structure their perceptions. It is noticeable, however, that he feels bound also to advocate leaps in the dark. The social 12 worker, drawing strength from that faith which Haimos identified, is thus enjoined at least occasionally to suspend belief and to act upon intuition and hunches.4 Else- where, Leonard has been moved to assert that social workers face the danger of be- coming imprisoned in the theoretical models they employ. " The professional futility of regarding any sociological or psychological theory as something in which one must believe is self-evident, but the need for cer- tainty and professional security often drives us into this false position." r' In other words, theory and scientific method are important, but there can be so much reliance on the former that practice can become rigid, and so much reliance on the latter that necessary action may be frustrated. This article makes no claim to achieve a synthesis of theory and intuition, scientific method and involvement. Neither is there any claim that it says anything particularly new. The aim is simply to shift the area df debate on the grounds that attention might more profitably be paid to the nature of social work models which might actually be deployed rather than to the general question of science and social work. For it would seem to follow that one's opinion about how scientific the social work process ought to be, how much scientific rigour should or can be expected, will depend on the nature of the conceptual model of the social work task one adopts. Problem-Solving To illustrate what is meant by this, social work will be treated as a problem solving activity, be it concerned with helping an individual to identify and solve his own problems or simply providing him with the means to solve problems he has himself pre-</page><page sequence="2">viously identified. " Problem," however, is not a term which is uniformly used. It is in fact capable of fundamentally different inter- pretations which in turn reflect or are reflected in the qualitatively different social work models available for deployment. " Problem solving," then, is something of a loaded phrase. It implies at once that a situation can be presented schematically such that some factor or factors can be identified as the cause of discord, and that something can be done to rectify the situation either by removing the cause of discord or by mini- mising the effects of the discord. In addition there is the logical requirement that some rules must be known to indicate that there is discord; that for " fact " we can read " problem." In its starkest form this process is akin to ' puzzle solving, but so far as social work models are concerned it is essential that a distinction be made. For puzzles would seem to have certain peculiar hallmarks. They are, for example, man-made problem situa- tions; situations, what is more, which do not occur accidentally but which are consciously fabricated. Again, they have demonstrably correct solutions which in turn implies that there are demonstrably correct methods of arriving at those solutions. The point here is that social work conceived as a problem solving task could assume the model of puzzle solving.6 Certain empirical situations - man-made or no - present themselves, and are observed " problematically." Regarded in this way it may seem that they have " correct " solu- tions. But they have not been consciously fabricated - unless, that is, one believes in some anthropomorphic God who likes set- ting his creatures puzzles. What is fabricated, though, is the theoretical model used to schematise and structure those situations so as to facilitate observation of them. It is possible, in other words, so to translate the situations that it looks as if they are puzzles having correct solutions. Thus the social worker, using this model, regards the situa- tion problematically, translates it into puzzle form and then seeks a solution to the empirical problem along the lines indicated by the method of solving the puzzle. Now if the social worker is intent on finding " correct " solutions in this manner he will be working in the context of puzzles. His social work model will be a puzzle solving model, for instead of analysing his theoreti- cal models in terms of the empirical world he will be analysing people in terms of models. He will be taking his theoretical models for concrete things and in conse- quence his theoretical framework could easily become rigid. From being useful tools to assist him in the interpretation of his observations they could become the agents of hard and fast prescription.7 Involvement in Difficulties A different social work model is implied, however, by envisaging the process not as the search for right answers to a series of schematiseable problems, but as involvement in a succession of difficulties. Here the task will not be to come up with some demon- strably correct solution. Rather will it be to help clients to overcome, avoid, or otherwise cope with their various difficulties. In so far as no two people are alike, so too will their perceptions of what constitute difficulties be different. If the apparently same difficulty presents itself to two people, their personal uniqueness will imply that any one method of dealing with it will not produce equal satisfaction. Any theoretical model which might be used to facilitate understanding will be considered fundamentally in- adequate : " Man is not a mechanical being who will some day be known in all his depth and breadth and height. He is a living soul," asserts Alan Keith-Lucas.8 In extreme form, however, the stress on indi- viduality, on uniqueness, could very nearly preclude the use of any generalisation or schématisation. " Method " could become more of a mystique, theory a kind of theology, and with rationale based not on scientifically established principles but on the logic of faith. Thus although the danger of imposing a rigid puzzle and solution pattern may have been avoided the actual procedure adopted could be unsystematic, save in the nature of the assumption that the moral-cum- technical principles of Acceptance, Empathy, and Support " lie in a very positive way at the very core of help." 9 But if the notion of uniqueness precludes the formulation and 13</page><page sequence="3">testing of even empirical generalisations, successful service which it is the specific function of the agency to perform will be open to chance. Even if psychoanalytic tech- niques are used, involving long interview sessions, the establishment of relationships, and with the social worker making appraisals based upon insight and intuition as well as upon intimate knowledge of himself and his client, verification may well be shunned. Such a model is thus inviolate. " Not depend- ing for its justification on its results, no failure can therefore discredit it." 10 The justification of this model, then, does not seem to belong to the realm of scientific dis- course but to that of morality, brotherly love and respect for the unique " living soul " incapable of scientific interpretation. Two Models as Extremes These two models are extremes, of course, and it could be justifiably argued that neither is in fact deployed. The contention here, however, is that although this may be true the social work models which are actually deployed will tend to lean towards one or the other. Indeed each has merits as well as demerits. So the task is to construct a model of problem solving which contains those characteristics of the models so far outlined which seem to be essential, and to ascertain its nature. To avoid over-use of the phrase "problem solving," the term " strategy " will be used to describe this model.11 This is appropriate be- cause " strategy " seems to imply working towards some goal in a systematic manner and within a context of rules, whilst at the same time being prepared for unexpected contingencies which might cause a change of tactics or even a reassessment of the accessibility or suitability of the original goal. The goal will be some manifestation of the service which it is the function of the agency to perform. The given context of rules will be supplied by the laws, rules and value systems of the society and of the agency, the norms of the various groups in that society, the theoretical framework adopted by the social worker, and rationality. The planned manner will be the selection of decisions within those rules which the social worker judges most likely to achieve the 14 goal. Thus however the client is categorised, be he one with emotional or material prob- lems of which he is aware or unaware, the social worker will adopt a strategy in his dealings with the client, together with tactics he considers appropriate to the par- ticular case, aiming at tackling those prob- lems. A Strategy Model The exercise now, therefore, is to attempt to construct a model of strategy which retains the utility and avoids the pitfalls of the other two social work models. On the one hand it should have a theoretical framework within which the social worker's perceptions may be coherently structured, while on the other hand those perceptions should not be inexorably channelled to some rigid, de- ductively necessitated conclusion. In other words it should allow the theoretical frame- work, applied to the empirical situation, to be so modified as to cater for possible ex- ceptions to the theoretical rules. The model would thus be at once schematic and flexible. The essential point to bear in mind is that the caseworker's dealings with his client are not strictly speaking analogous to his doing a puzzle. For the former constitutes a situation of social interaction whereas the latter does not. Further, in so far as it is a characteristic of social interaction that one party cannot realise his intentions without taking the othér party into account, so too in the casework situation the social worker will not be able to render effective service unless he has some idea of how the client will behave. He must, therefore, have some theories, insights or intuitions which will enable him to predict how the client is likely to react or respond to his actions. The issue is more complicated than this, though, because the social worker must also be aware that the client, as the other party to the relationship, will be doing the same in regard to him - albeit in a less formalised manner. Nevertheless the strategy model has to be adjusted accordingly and however complex such a notion of interac- tion might be it is of fundamental import- ance for predictive purposes. This, of course, is a major contrast to the analogy of caseworker as puzzle solver. Puzzle solving is a non-interactional model.</page><page sequence="4">Someone doing a puzzle is not always pre- pared for the contingency that the puzzle might change its nature, become obstinate, aggressive or mischievous. A puzzle is not a dynamic organism which can take it upon itself even unconsciously to make the solver's task more difficult. It is not a party to a relationship. Thus although the puzzle analogy may be tempting in that it might indicate clear-cut solutions which are theoretically obvious, the absence from it of the essential social interaction of the case- work situation emasculates and thus invalid- ates it. Goals and Values The model we now have is one of rule- governed social interaction - rule-governed in both descriptive and prescriptive senses of the term. And this latter distinction in- volves the model's having two systems of perspective which though related are still quite different from each other. One is purely formal or technical, comprising a range of possible goals which in turn are related to the various courses of action apparently necessary for their achievement. The other is a system of values which is applied to those goals. So by adopting this model the social worker is in a situation where he is faced with four questions : What possible courses of action are in fact open to him? How is the client likely to react to the new situation(s) created by such action? What value does he, the caseworker, place on the consequences of the action? What value will the client place on them? 12 The actual de- cisions made by the caseworker will depend on whether and how he answers these questions, as, to some extent, will the scientific nature of those decisions. In so far as the social worker looks towards psychological and sociological theory to assist him in his quest for answers, he is at the same time seeking a guarantee that his answers will be objectively and scientifically based. He is attempting to minimise the in- fluence on his decisions of prescriptive rules implied by his own value assumptions in favour of particular goals and technical imperatives for their achievement, rather than others which still lie within the com- petence of his agency. For although the technical imperatives might be discovered through rational deduction from objective theory, the actual goals aimed at could derive from the social worker's own values. But if the quest for objectivity can lessen the impact of his own values, the question arises as to whether it can do so without also neglecting the crucial subjective character of the client's values and motives. In short, it has to be decided whether behavourism is the only form of objectivity available to the social worker, for to some extent it could be considered a contradiction that a theoreti- cal model can incorporate the subjective point of view and yet remain scientific. Before these points are discussed, however, it should be stressed that one is dealing with conceptual models, still; models which are not themselves the real world but which are simply used as crutches to assist our under- standing of it. Observable Behaviour and Motivation The issue, then, is whether the rules of scientific method limit the social worker to a concern with observable fact which he can then organise to allow the formulation of empirical generalisations. If so, the only scientific explanation or understanding of social phenomena and human behaviour will be provided by certain other observable facts which because of their apparent relevance are assumed to have causal significance. The contention here is that, apart from the pos- sible fallacies involved in such a scheme, it is of very limited utility. If human behaviour is to be understood and predic- tions facilitated more is required. And here one almost inevitably enters the subjective realm of motive. Obviously the caseworker cannot grasp all the ramifications of his client's motives, his experiences and aspirational horizons. Such a comprehension would require complete identity of personality, inconceivable even after life-long contact. But it does make scientific sense - without incurring the charge of Occam's Razor - to relate the client's behaviour to hypothetically typical motives, situations and aspirations, which at the same time can be kept flexible enough to allow un- typical correlations to exist. Indeed it might be considered essential that the caseworker 15</page><page sequence="5">should be so armed. Because he is not a detached observer but is engaged in a rela- tionship with his client he must have some notion of the client's motives in order to interpret his behaviour more fully and to be more certain that the client will interpret the caseworker's acts in the manner intended. The caseworker would certainly be on dangerous ground if he formulated his hypotheses purely from his own experiences. Despite certain uses this might have in the absence of other evidence it would involve generalising from very limited particulars. It is possible, however, for him to build a con- ceptual scheme within which to place not only his own experiences but those of his colleagues, together with the findings of the growing army of detached social scientists as well as those resulting from repeated research as a method of social work investigation. In this way can he build into his framework the notion of the ideal type, an abstraction com- prising typical acts, conditions and 'motives, with a consciousness limited to those elements necessary for the performance of the hypothetically " typical " acts under consideration. As a conceptual term the ideal type can be tested against the empirical situation and, if need be, modified. It is, of course, still a tool but one which incor- porates the subjective element and yet at the same time can be discussed objectively.13 Observation and Action It should now be apparent that within the strategy model the social worker, in seeking to make appropriate decisions, is informed by sociological and psychological theories, is assisted by a variety of theoretical tools, but his actions are not thereby completely circumscribed. His decisions can in the last resort be modified by the peculiar nature of the individual client with whom he is in a social-interaction relationship. So long as his perceptions are as free from bias as possible, there is no cause to think that his observations and conclusions cannot be scientific. But, again unlike the scientific observer, the caseworker has to act on as well as record his conclusions. There thus remains the question of how much evidence he must have before he acts and yet still retains his scientific integrity. Put crudely 16 this question becomes " How far is he scienti- fically justified in acting on hunches? " Basically this is not simply a question about whether or how far such actions are scienti- fically based, but whether they are rational. One assumes that the question whether or not to act on a hunch will arise when there is not only ground for uncertainty about the outcome of a particular action but also no clear reason behind the prognosis. If the action is to be undertaken all the same, the decision will be rational only if the case- worker has taken account of the risks on the one hand and the legitimate expectations on the other.14 Should it appear from all the available evidence that nothing will be lost as a result of the particular action to which he is inclined, so will he be satisfied with less conclusive evidence to indicate that gain will ensue. Furthermore, the greater the gain that would ensue from his being right, still less will be the evidence he demands be- fore committing himself. However, should the gain from success seem to be relatively small and the loss from failure relatively great, so will more solid evidence be demanded to establish a clearer connection between the proposed action and the intended result. In such terms must the social worker's acting on hunches be judged in order to ascertain the rationality, and hence the scientific integrity, of those actions. But given the complicated situation of social interaction, with one party committed to rendering a service, departures from scientifically based rationality are so much the more probable. And in so far as the caseworker insists upon working on hunches, his strategy becomes more suspect from the scientific point of view, and his decisions become moral rather than technical. Intuition and Insight It might finally be asked " If hunches tend to lower the scientific integrity of the social worker's action, what about intuition and in- sight? " Certainly it should be granted that even hunches can be tested against the out- comes of actions deriving from them. So too can intuitions and insights be verified. The point is that this procedure merely provides corroborative evidence. Supporting evidence indicating the efficacy of the particular</page><page sequence="6">action will have been gained only after it has taken place. Yet this too can be useful scientifically. For unless successful outcomes are purely coincidental, hunches, insights, intuitions or whatever the flashes of inspira- tion are called, would seem to relate to some schematiseable knowledge or experience of the caseworker, however unconsciously it is developed.15 In the initial situation, though, whether one applies the term hunch, intui- tion or insight will depend not only upon how unconscious the schématisation is and how much evidence underlies it, but also on how strong a connotation of professional respectability the social worker desires should derive from his actions in a situa- tion of uncertainty. As indicated earlier, this article claims to say nothing particularly new. All it purports to r indicate is that it is possible to conceptualise a model of social work which is at once theoretical and flexible, and within which the caseworker is observer, participator and initiator, and the client is patient and yet at the same time himself an agent. More par- ticularly, the notion of strategy facilitates an assessment of how far and in what areas social work practice is or is not conducted in accordance with scientific principles.
