<plain_text><page sequence="1">AMERICAN ANTIQUITY of development of these positions, or the advantages and limitations of each. A second shortcoming-which follows from the lack of editorial commentary but could have been partially rectified by instructions to contributors-is the absence of a clearly manifest theme or point of view. Since the title of the volume is Production and Distribution: A Ceramic Viewpoint, I expected to find some statement of what is production and what is distribution. More important, I expected to encounter some assessment of the special viewpoint that ceramic data can bring to these issues. Unfortunate- ly, these thornier questions of "middle range theory" concerning definition and operationalization of economic processes as they relate to ceramics were largely ignored by the contributors as well as by the editors. Consequently, many of the papers vacillated, unanchored, in an uneasy liminal state between detailed particularism and broad generalism. What I did emerge with, after reading these papers, is a sense of epistemological anomie in ceramic analysis (reflected, perhaps, in the lack of unity in the volume itself). I am concerned by the unwill- ingness on the part of ceramic archaeologists to recognize and confront the broader economic issues involved in the processes that place pottery in the ar- chaeological record. These processes are, after all, the ones we are trying to understand by means of our varied analytical approaches. For example, the bulk of the papers in this volume did address the activities of forming pots and the recovery locations of pottery outside their original region of manufacture. But these endeavors are simply the preliminaries to a more thorough treatment of the complex economic issues of production and distribution, and their social context. Furthermore, there is occasionally a disturb- ing tendency to confuse the process of "distribution" with that of "consumption" by means of an inexplicit recourse to "function." Function, of course, has im- portant components relating to vessel "use" (storage, cooking, etc.); it also has a significant social and semiotic aspect (typically manifest in decoration) relating to status or symbolic roles, identifiers, and patterns of access to the commodity. These symbolic functions are no less "real," in an emic sense than are the more technologically objective and verifiable "use" functions. Thus, although the differential spatial occurrence of pottery at a site or an area reflects patterns of "consumption" (both use and symbolic functions) of pottery, it does not at the same time constitute an operational identity with the economic process or system of distribution that got the pots there in the first place. Finally, without heed to Hodder's advice to con- sider pottery in its full cultural context, there is often a disturbing reductionist inclination on the part of ceramic technologists to interpret variability mech- anistically in terms of proximity to clay sources and kind and quantity of temper constituents. These tech- no-environmental variables have an undeniable ap- peal and utility because of their ease of measurement and constraints on the nature of the final product. Yet the "cultural" variables cannot be dismissed as "merely" cultural. Clearly there is no single "ceram- ic viewpoint." But without a more holistic or contex- tual perspective, ceramic analysis is in danger of breaking down into a thing of "sherds and patches." BOOK ABSTRACTS Falsifications and Misreconstructions of Pre- columbian Art: A Conference at Dumbarton Oaks, October 14th and 15th, 1978. ELIZABETH HILL BOONE, editor, Dumbarton Oaks, Trustees for Harvard University, Washington, D.C. 1982. x + 142 pp., illus., biblio. $16.00 (cloth). Abstracted by Clemency Coggins This volume includes eight papers on fakes and dubious restorations. Five of these describe Andean antiquities: Robert Sonin illustrates stone, shell, metal, and ceramic falsifications, with their probable authentic models, as does Alan Sawyer for polychrome ceramics, Christopher Donnan for a com- plexly decorated Moche vessel, Raphael Reichert for a Moche-Recuay vessel, and S. Henry Wassen for silver head jars. Esther Pasztory casts doubt on the authenticity of several objects heretofore considered prime specimens of Aztec sculpture. Dicey Taylor reveals the extent of repainting present on many Maya polychrome vessels and notes how this may lead to faulty interpretation. Finally Augusto Molina-Montes offers theoretical insight into the reconstruction of ancient buildings. He quotes the Charter of Venice of 1964, "The process of restoration. . . must stop at the point where conjecture begins . . .. Only the reassembling of existing dismembered parts can be permitted" (pp. 127, 128), and documents several Mesoamerican restorations in which this principle was overlooked. Excavations at Two Mississippian Hamlets in the Cairo Lowland of Southeast Missouri. R. BARRY LEWIS. Special Publication Number 2, Illinois Ar- chaeological Survey, Department of Anthropology, University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign, 1982. xii + 104 pp., illus., biblio. $4.00 (paper). Abstracted by Kenneth Carstens The focus of Lewis's study is a detailed discussion of the excavations at the Hess and Callahan- Thompson sites; it is an excellent complement to his more environmentally oriented 1974 study of the same area. The work is more than just another descriptive site report. Lewis convincingly tackles the elusive ceramic complexes and typological issues of the Cairo Lowland region. The study offers insight into a region which, despite considerable investiga- tion, is still poorly understood. The work is another example of the importance of examining small non- fortified Mississippian sites (individual house units and hamlets) to achieve a more comprehensive 874 [Vol. 48, No. 4, 1983]</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS AND ABSTRACTS understanding of Middle Mississippi and Lower Ohio Valley prehistory. Las "Figurillas" de Esmeraldas: Tipologia y Funci6n. EMMA SANCHEZ MONTANES. Memorias de la Misi6n Arqueolo6gica Espafiola en el Ecuador 7. Ministerio de Asuntos Exteriores, Direcci6n General de Relaciones Culturales, Madrid, 1981. 120 pp., illus., biblio. Paper. Abstracted by Peter Stahl Anthropomorphic ceramic figurines from Late For- mative and Regional Developmental period context of the northern Ecuadorian and southern Colombian coasts are described and analyzed. Their cultural significance and function are clarified through the rigorous classification of approximately 2,000 specimens presently housed in diverse collections, or obtained through limited excavation. The figurines, which are found in the Tachina, Tumaco-Tolita, Tiaone, and Atacames cultures, reveal information through analyses of "correspondences" of attributes, temporal, spatial and interareal relationships, and the function of the figurines within their cultural realm. Previous classificatory schemes are reviewed and criticized. A revised classification based upon stylistic and typological analysis is presented, yielding data on material culture, physical type, life cycle, economy, society, and religious beliefs. These data are used to discuss the use, significance, and function of Tumaco-Tolita figurines. Previous hypotheses of function are examined and rejected, and Sanchez Montaneis supplants them with the sug- gestion that these figurines represented individuals' rites of passage. Early European Settlement and Exploitation in Atlan- tic Canada: Selected Papers. G. M. STORY, editor. International Symposium on Early European Set- tlement and Exploitation in Atlantic Canada, Memorial University of Newfoundland. St. John's. Newfoundland, 1982. 161 pp., biblio. $10.00 (paper). Abstracted by Dan R. Irwin The selected papers of this 1979 symposium collec- tively shed light on the historical and archaeological background of Atlantic Canada, especially New- foundland. The opening paper offers a sense of pur- pose and meaning to the conference. It aptly sets the scene for the following eight papers by focusing on the processes of colonization, economic penetration, and proselytism which brought Western European nations to this part of North America. Several of the papers deal with recent archaeolog- ical findings at specific sites, namely Red Bay, Labrador, along the Strait of Belle Isle, as well as Cupid's Cove and the Avalon peninsula in Newfound- land. All of these early attempts at settlement were efforts to take advantage of the whale and cod fish- ing nearby. Except for the introduction of the cod fish into European diets, little was known about New- foundland until about 1630. This was due to a lack of interest, ignorance, and misunderstanding of its geography. One paper develops the theme that colonization was unlike that of the New England or Virginia ex- periments, because Newfoundland's exploitation re- quired neither typical settlement patterns, new labor force, nor the production of a crop. A final contributed paper urges ethnologists, his- torians, archaeologists, and anthropologists to make better use of each others' research findings so as to achieve their scientific objectives. All have a role to play in the study of cultural change. The Southeastern Check Stamped Pottery Tradition: A View from Louisiana. IAN W. BROWN. M.C.J.A. Special Paper No. 4, Kent State University Press, Kent, Ohio, 1982. 100 pp., illus., biblio. $6.25 (paper). Abstracted by Carol A. Morrow This monograph presents detailed information about a single pottery type, Pontchartrain Check Stamped, from the Louisiana Gulf Coast area. Al- though Brown's focus is on the Petit Anse region, the fact that 50% of the sites in his study area yielded less than 10 sherds each does not seem to support his claim of a regional perspective. The major source of information for this study is obtained from the Morgan site (34-G-2) on Pecan Island, and Brown does a commendable job of presenting information on the Pontchartrain Check Stamped pottery recovered from the site. Twenty-seven tables and 38 figures are used to summarize a massive amount of primary data on this specific Coles Creek period pottery type. The varieties of this type are defined and illustrated, and the photographic quality of the illustrations overall is quite good. Of particular interest is the excellent review of the southeastern check stamped pottery tradition, discussed in detail by period and region. A bit more integration between this general overview of the check stamping tradition and the analysis of a specific type would have been preferable; however, Brown's paper does represent a major source of in- formation about check stamped ceramics in the Southeast, particularly during the Late Woodland period.
