IPROPOSE TO RETURN the pathos of Derrida's De l'esprit to its logos; to expose the logos lurking in its elegeia: to argue that the simultaneous disavowal and displacement of the predicament of diremption results in the "ontologizing"2 of violence as revelation, as what is "laid bare." I shall argue in opposition to Derrida's intention and aim that Heidegger's thinking does not bear the lapsus and new beginning that Derrida reconstructs in it, but that, on the contrary, it is quite consistent from the Rectoral Address (1933) to the "final reply" (1953) in the Gesprdch with Trakl.3 If De l'esprit contains Derrida's apologia for Heidegger, it has also come to provide the Urtext (the originary text) for Derrida's con- tinuing expiation of the singular which emerges from his recent ex- plorations of what he calls "the Judeo-German psyche" in com- mentaries on texts by Hermann Cohen and Walter Benjamin, and from his recent definition of "deconstruction" as justice.4 In an extended footnote to my discussion of De l'esprit I shall show the continuity between Derrida's defence of Heidegger and his own approach to modernity, Nazism, and the Holocaust as it has been developed in these later commentaries. I shall speak of ghost [revenant], of flame, and of ashes. (OS 11; DE 1) I shall speak of this opening announcement and of four footnotes; of a passage in chapter 5 on this revenant-of what it is that is said to return, to haunt; and of the imaginary discourse with which the final chapter concludes between Heidegger and the theologians- of the flame and the ashes. First, "the ghost" (le revenant) at the threshold, also called "the * This paper was first prepared for a conference on Jacques Derrida's De l'esprit, held at the University of Warwick, 1990.

Geist, however, bears another set of meanings which, prima facie, are nowhere evident in this work, yet which have been displaced from the main text to the footnotes. I speak of "modern" spirit-of spirit in the sense which accom- panies the strivings of modernity at its inception, and which has been developed analytically to expound the institutional inversion of meaning inherent to modernity: in the former case, Montesquieu, De l'esprit des lois (Of the Spirit of the Laws) (1748); in the latter case, Weber, Die protestantische Ethik und der Geist des Kapitalismus (The Protestant Ethic and the Spirit of Capitalism) (1905).5 The "spirit" of the laws covers the customs and manners of a people associated with its written, legislated, or codified law-its "ethos" in the inclusive sense; or, as sociology would conceive it, all the different kinds of norms in a society which are general and sanctioned, and taken to be universal and imperative. The "spirit" of capitalism captures the extraordinary inversion of incipient mo- dernity: that the development of the Protestant soteriology of in- wardness resulted in the methodical and instrumental organization of everyday life; so that, to Weber, modern "rationality," subsequently broken into "formal" and "substantive," means that combination of inner anxiety and outer ruthlessness originally displayed by the Protestant individual which made capitalism possible. This is a combination which Durkheim implicitly acknowledged and analyzed further in Suicide, when he hypothesized that the highest rate of suicide and the lowest degree of social cohesion is found in Protestant communities: the erstwhile courageous, entrepreneurial Protestant spirit becomes most vulnerable to anomie and self-destruction. Both Weber and Durkheim link their analysis of this central social paradox to the political paralysis of modern societies as they conceive it. According to Weber, the fate of the modern spirit has decreed that the light coat of the Protestant this-worldly saint should have become an "iron-cage."6 It is in this context of exploring the original development of modern capitalist society that I raise "spirit" in Hegel, which (to shoot from a pistol) means, phenomenologically, the struggle for recognition in its changing configurations of misrecognition. Between two self-consciousnesses, recognition is presented as the struggle between lord and bondsman, which is subsequently internalized in the duplicated "unhappy consciousness"; while in the historical world, it is presented as "legal status": the misrecognitions attendant on</page><page sequence="3">OF DERRIDA'S SPIRIT 449 abstract legal personality, private property, and the decay of public and political life. Hegel also expounds this as "the spiritual-animal kingdom" (das geistige Tierreich) which results when abstract, universal consciousness, unimpeded by others, appears to treat others as ends in themselves, universally, but in effect treats others and itself as means.7 This exposition of the spiritual-animal kingdom corresponds to the exposition of the separation of civil society from the state in the Philosophy of Right. In both places the exposition delimits the freedom and unfreedom accompanying "individual rights." It may be seen to elaborate Rousseau's account in A Discourse on the Origin of Inequality of the interest which dominates people in a society based legally on protecting private property and self-consciously on guarding their social status in appearing to be what they really are not, in scheming and deceiving." "Spirit" in this sense of "spiritual-animal kingdom" pervades He- gel's phenomenology, his exposition of modernity and the paradoxes of subjectivity. Kant's inner, moral autonomy is seen to be quite compatible with its purported contrary-outer, legal heteronomy. Viewed dynamically, an increase in subjective freedom and autonomy may mean a decrease in objective freedom, that is to say, an increase in heteronomy. It is this dynamic and predicament of modernity according to which social actuality tends to undermine and to invert overt moral and political intentions that post-Kantian philosophy and social theory have sought to expound-without trying to over- come these meanings and their inversions, whether metaphysically or postmetaphysically, as long as they continue to be generated by their legal and political and productive preconditions. "Spirit" also means the attempt to reconstruct and present these inversions of subject and substance without allowing dominant au- thorial authority to intensify the inversions expounded: hence the Phenomenology of Spirit is a drama of discursiveness which ironizes its passages and its aporiae so as to leave its reader exposed to the recognition of being already engaged in the struggle for recognition. In this light, any hypostatizing of "Spirit" in Hegel is, a fortiori, implicated in the drama of misrecognition, the pathos of the concept; while to attribute the discourse of spirit to "the metaphysics of subjectity" is to universalize the historically specific paradoxes of modern subjectivity and to exalt them as "a continuous tradition"- when they arise out of the discontinuity between modern substance and its inverted subjects. There are four significant references to Hegel in De l'esprit which are elaborated in the attached footnotes. Three of these footnotes refer back to the passage from Hegel that is cited in the first9:</page><page sequence="4">450 NEW LITERARY HISTORY "Introduction" to The Philosophy of Spirit, in the Encyclopedia, ?378. In the same introduction, Hegel defines the essence of spirit as liberty and as the capacity, in its formal determination, to support infinite suffering. I think I must quote this paragraph to anticipate what will be said later about spirit, liberty, and evil for Heidegger: "This is why the essence of spirit is formally liberty, the absolute negativity of the concept as self-identity. According to this formal determination, it can abstract all that is exterior and its own exteriority, its own presence: it can support the negation of its individual immediacy, infinite suffering: that is, conserve itself affirmative in this negation and be identical for itself. This possibility is in itself the abstract universality of spirit, universality which-is-for-itself (?382). (OS 188, n. 1 to ch. 3; DE 33) Not commented on, this passage is conjured as a warning about the dangers of pneumatology, but also about the danger that liberty of spirit risks "a merely formal liberty and ... an abstract universality" (OS 119, n. 3 to ch. 5; DE 65). The fourth reference in text and note by contrast implicates Hegel in holy fire: "And one of the most obsessing ghosts among the philosophers of this alchemy would again be Hegel who, as I have tried to show elsewhere, situated the passage from the philosophy of nature to the philosophy of spirit in the combustion from which, like the sublime effluvia of a fermentation, Geist-the gas-rises up or rises up again above the decomposing dead, to interiorize itself in the Aufhebung" (OS 99; DE 161-62). In the footnote, Hegel is cited from the Lectures on the History of Philosophy to appear as the collective guardian of the "sacred fire" which the World-Spirit passes from nation to nation (OS 136, n. 1 to ch. 10; DE 162), while one of the listed passages from Glas also attributes procession and synthesis to spirit, "one ... must proceed from spirit as the synthesis of the singular and the universal."'0 Without respecting the difference between phenomenological witness and philosophical reconstruction between and within Hegel's texts, and hence without commentary on struggle and misrecognition, such citation can only serve as precession and thematics: "Given that we are trying to mark the continuity of a tradition in those places where the thematics of fire, hearth, guard, and nation cross, it is appropriate to quote Hegel once again" (OS 136; DE 161). Comparison of the two Hegel passages in the text with the passage from Hegel called up thrice in the notes gives us two representations of "Spirit" in Hegel: the one, an exposition of the abstract, one- sided, negative effect of formal self-identity; the other, conflagra- tion-sacred fire and noxious effluvia (OS 118, 99; DE 33, 161). I discern here (and passim) three truncated thoughts. First, "Spirit"</page><page sequence="5">OF DERRIDA'S SPIRIT 451 is cited as "abstract universality" without any reference to what it has been abstracted from and to what it returns--without, that is, any reference to the substance of modern ethical life. Abstract legal right in turn gives rise to the culture of the "spiritual-animal king- dom." Secondly, "Spirit" as abstract universality is cited "to anticipate what will be said later about spirit, liberty, and evil for Heidegger" (OS 118; DE 33). An anticipation never to be fulfilled. For when it later emerges that Heidegger takes a metaphysics of evil and origin from Schelling's Of Human Freedom, the confrontation between He- gel's and Schelling's radically incompatible commitments never oc- curs. Third and finally, "the continuity of a tradition" evoked to justify citing Hegel on "the nations," and which is meant to imply continuity with Heidegger's nationalism, fails to distinguish between and hence to relate "a people" in Rousseau's sense, where bounded sovereignty and universal citizenship defines the nation (Hegel), and a notion of inherited "ethnicity" which serves as an exclusive criterion for political membership (Heidegger) -between a people (the polity) defining the nation, and "the nation" defining a people (the polity). Hannah Arendt has linked the change from the "nation-state" to the "so-called totalitarian state" to the twin contradictions of universal rights dependent on national sovereignties, and universal equality dependent on systematic class inequality." Instead of following through the history of the abstract form of dirempted "Spirit" and its violent overcomings, Derrida offers- "thematics." The second of these textual references to Hegel that I wish to discuss occurs in the second passage in chapter 5 of De l'esprit. It sets out the third and most inclusive "protocol of interpretation" for reading Heidegger's "Rectoral Address": The force to which Heidegger appeals, and again in conclusion when he speaks of the destiny of the West, is thus a "spiritual force" (geistige Kraft). And we will find this theme of spirit and of the West again, though displaced, in the text on Trakl. What is the price of this strategy? Why does it fatally turn back against its "subject"--if one can use this word, as one must, in fact? Because one cannot demarcate oneself from biologism, from naturalism, from racism in its genetic form, one cannot be opposed to them except by reinscribing spirit in an oppositional determination, by once again making it a unilaterality of subjectity [subjectite], even if in its voluntarist form. The constraint of this program remains very strong, it reigns over the majority of discourses which, today and for a long time to come, state their opposition to racism, to totalitarianism, to nazism, to fascism, etc., and do this in the name of spirit, and even of the freedom of (the) spirit3 [Derrida's note], in the name of an axiomatic-for example, that of democracy or "human rights"-which,</page><page sequence="6">452 NEW LITERARY HISTORY directly or not, comes back to this metaphysics of subjectity. All the pitfalls of the strategy of establishing demarcations belong to this program, whatever place one occupies in it. The only choice is the choice between the terrifying contaminations it assigns. Even if all forms of complicity are not equivalent, they are irreducible. ... In the Rectorship Address, this risk is not just a risk run. If its program seems diabolical, it is because, without there being anything fortuitous in this, it capitalizes on the worst, that is on both evils at once: the sanctioning of nazism, and the gesture that is still metaphysical. (OS 39-40; DE 65-66) Later, in chapters 9 and 10, Derrida argues that, in his writing on Trakl, Heidegger fails toward an alternative notion of spirit: one which is not oppositional but originary (or "heterogeneous-originary"). Given the source of this notion of spirit in Schelling, the issue becomes whether it overcomes or reinvents and replays Christian- metaphysical pneumato-spirituality. However, what is most disturbing in the long passage cited here is the structuring elision presented, nevertheless, in the name of the irreducible. For, it is claimed, whether one speaks for Nazism or strives to oppose it, both positions are equally "terrifying contaminations." This stipulation would deflect investigation from Heidegger's defence of Nazism as a "spiritual force" by attributing any conceivable basis for such investigation to a "metaphysics of subjectity," and then by indicting any and all conceivable opposition to Nazism for being ineluctably cast in the same "metaphysics of subjectity," which is extended to cover "all the pitfalls of the strategy of establishing demarcations," "for ex- ample, democracy or 'human rights."' Derrida diagnoses this par- alyzing dilemma by arguing that if metaphysics always returns, it returns doubly in the discourse of Geist which becomes in effect ghost to the notion of ghost (Geist) (see OS 40; DE 66). Furthermore, if metaphysics is redeployed to sanction Nazism, this is said to occur "without there being anything fortuitous" about it. Compressed in this accentuation is the idea of the continuity of the tradition construed as the metaphysics and politics of "voluntarist" "unilaterality of subjectity." Since to establish demarcations is coterminous with conceiving as such, this reasoning disqualifies all thinking, including its own. It prohibits any and all political discrimination between inclusive and exclusive political ideals, and forecloses any perception or judgment that inclusive political promises may presuppose and perpetuate exclusivity: in short, it destroys the possibility of critique and leaves only "thematics," which amounts to listings. However, the passage from Hegel cited for the second time in the note to this passage (note 3) concerns discontinuity, abstract</page><page sequence="7">OF DERRIDA'S SPIRIT 453 subjectivity broken off from its substance, its political community. Far from being posited as a unilateral or subjective voluntas or nisus, abstract subjectivity is exposited as the response of infinite suffering to the gain and loss of formal freedom. If "Spirit" haunts those who would overcome it, this is not because they are still bound within the "metaphysics of subjectity," which is to limit the problem (while disowning limits) to some cerebrality of positing and de- marcation. It is because spirit is still dirempted by the dual character of modern legality-the simultaneous autonomy and heteronomy of the legal person separated from the law of the state-and would mend such diremption with pseudoholistic phantasms of "race," "ethnicity," "community." These can begin to be "opposed," for the political history of diremption and of the violent attempts to over- come it are reconstructable. To do so requires commitment to comprehension and critique of the formal legality of subjective agency and the "infinite suffering" it conjures. But this modern culture of political fate becomes invisible and unspeakable beside the elevation and generalization of the "metaphysics of subjectity." If the elision of "contaminations" may thus indeed be challenged, and forbidding irreducibility "reduced," then it becomes possible to distinguish between Heidegger's defence of Nazism as a "spiritual force" and opposition to that defence which draws on some notion of rights-because the latter may itself be comprehended and crit- icized. On the other hand, in this light, the change in Heidegger's use of Geist from "spiritual force" to "originary Spirit" has a con- sistency from which Derrida labors to detach it. In chapters 9 and 10, Derrida stages the argument that Heidegger moved form cautioning against Geist to defending Nazism in terms of Geist, to overcoming this succumbing by a defence of Geistlich, either as a metaphysics of evil or as an archi-original alternative to any metaphysics. Derrida concedes that the distinction between Geist, which is implicated in metaphysical opposition, and Geistlichkeit, which is the prehistorical Event of Being (OS 101; DE 166-67), may be, in effect, a distinction without a difference (sic). For "spirit-in-flames," the verbal and visual icon for this "original" spirit, which is both gentleness and destruction, and in which evil has its provenance, reintroduces in its very distancing fundamental motifs of Platonized Christianity (OS 102, 97; DE 167, 157). This equivocality is argued out in a concluding imaginary dialogue between Heidegger and the Christian theologians, to whom is given the final, unresolved judg- ment of convergence, as the curtain falls on chapter and book-to whom is granted, beyond judgment, the integrity of failing toward what would be "the entirely other, inevitably" (OS 113; DE 184).</page><page sequence="8">454 NEW LITERARY HISTORY Lack of integrity, "irreducible contamination," is reserved for us. All our "inherited" thinking remains incapable of this return "to- wards the most originary" (OS 108; DE 177). The "scene" between Heidegger and the theologians is announced and then briefly held up so that, once more, the irreducibility of contamination may be hammered home: And as, since the beginning of this lecture, we have been speaking of nothing but the "translation" of these thoughts and discourses into what are commonly called the "events" of "history" and of "politics" (I place quotation marks around all these obscure words), it would also be necessary to "translate" what such an exchange of places can imply in its most radical possibility. This "translation" appears to be both indispensable and for the moment impossible. It therefore calls for quite other protocols, those in view of which I have proposed this reading. What I am aiming at here is, obviously enough, anything but abstract. We are talking about past, present, and future "events," a composition of forces and discourses which seem to have been waging merciless war on each other (for example from 1933 to our time). We have here a program and a combinatory whose power remains abyssal. In all rigor it exculpates none of the discourses which can thus exchange their power. It leaves no place open for any arbitrating authority. Nazism was not born in the desert. We all know this, but it has to be constantly recalled. And even if, far from any desert, it had grown like a mushroom in the silence of a European forest, it would have done so in the shadow of big trees, in the shelter of their silence or their indifference but in the same soil. I will not list these trees which in Europe people an immense black forest, I will not count the species. For essential reasons, the presentation of them defies tabular layout. In their bushy taxonomy, they would bear the names of religions, philosophies, political regimes, economic structures, religious or academic institutions. In short, what is just as confusedly called culture, or the world of spirit. (OS 109-10; DE 178-79) No sooner has the "impossibility" of "translating" thoughts and discourses into the "events" of "politics" and "history" been pro- claimed than, "like a mushroom," they are uninhibitedly translated into the nourishing matrix of sylvan silence, and then imbedded as archi-original prehistory. The inarticulate trees defy taxonomy; in- stead, in terror of contamination, they are set out as a haphazard list, as thematics, thereby skirting the issue of any tertium quid, which might introduce some logic, some order, some comprehension. With evasive haste, this untheorized and casual list of institutions of the middle (religions, philosophies, political regimes, economic structures, religious or academic institutions) is set aside in order to return to the dialogue between Heidegger and the theologians</page><page sequence="9">OF DERRIDA'S SPIRIT 455 over the "archi-origin." Yet the contrast between the "contamination" of any beginning in the middle, of any demarcation, and "the promise [of] the origin-heterogeneous to all the testaments, all the promises, all the events, all the laws and assignments which are our very memory" (OS 107; DE 176-77), casts the issue of Geist as a question of meta-metaphysics (even if the latter turns out to converge again with Christian revelation, reborn-but only aesthetically- precisely as repetition of "this entirely other" [OS 113; DE 184], but not as "the scandal," to suggest Kierkegaardian terms). Moreover, the promise of promises, archi-promise, becomes the emphatic and no longer casual form of any middle, distinguished from all promises, all events, all laws and assignments. In addition, to speak "of" Heidegger, "of" spirit, "of" the question, requires highly structured form, including a "narrative" of Heidegger's development, a "dia- logue" between Heidegger and imaginary theologians, and an "ele- gaic" use of Heidegger's relation to Trakl's poetry as the search for a primeval matutinality. Yet form, which is the middle qua social institutions and qua their principle of cohesion, is merely offered as thematics, as the two lists cited above, without even minimal taxonomic distinction (OS 136; DE 161).12 All Derrida's poiesis draws attention away from Heidegger's phro- nesis or evident lack of it. For if Heidegger's employment of Geist and its cognates is set in the more general context of his systematic disqualification of any consideration of diremption of spirit, of subjectivity as abstract civil law separated from the modern state, then the consistency of Heidegger's concerns in spite of his changing conceptuality can be reconstructed. In his 1936 commentary on Schelling's Of Human Freedom, which is considered in De l'esprit to be the source of the putative "meta- physics of evil" and which pervades the 1953 Trakl discussion, Heidegger explicitly distinguishes Schelling's notion of freedom as the sixth meaning, which "shatters" the fifth inclusive one,'" that of Hegel, the "formal concept of freedom" (ST 88; SA 106): Schelling raises the question of human freedom anew, in a direction to which Idealism especially obscures the way at first. Idealism understood freedom as the determination of the pure ego, as self-determination for the law, as self-legislation in good will. Only this will is good. On the contrary, freedom is understood by Schelling as the capability of good and evil (sixth concept of freedom). Evil is not an addition and a complement; rather, freedom changes through it in its very nature. The question of freedom must be asked as a question. (ST 99; SA 120)</page><page sequence="10">456 NEW LITERARY HISTORY The original unity, indissoluble in God but dissoluble in man, "constitutes the possibility of good and evil," and man's inner ne- cessity as freedom, man's being as "essentially his own deed.""14 Schelling's historicizing of "the original unruly element" according to the different ages of the world is quickly passed over15 with the following nonchalant remark: "What corresponds to the essential historical meaning of evil in Schelling, but is not merely identical with it, is in Hegel what he calls the diremption of unhappy con- sciousness" (ST 150; SA 181). In this vague but loaded comparison is suppressed the difference between metaphysics and phenome- nology-between Schelling's revelation of essential evil in historical stages, and Hegel's exposition of the inversions of self-consciousness which result from the denial of otherness, desire, and work, from the duplication of lord and bondsman within one self-consciousness, and which correspond to the world of legal status and to its spiritual- animal sociality--ancient and modern.'16 This notion of "archi-original" evil in Heidegger's Schelling com- mentary emerges in the archi-original language of revelation and violence in two other texts, the "Rectoral Address" (1933) and An Introduction to Metaphysics (1935), where it is deployed equally to discuss the origin of the Greek polis by commentary on the chorus of The Antigone, and to inspire the German people in their Nazi aubade. In An Introduction to Metaphysics the commentary on the Antigone chorus reads "Man is the violent one [Gewalttdtig]. He gathers the power [against the overpowering: gegen das Jberwdlti- gende] and brings it to manifestness [ldsst es in eine Offenbarkeit ein]":'7 in the "Rectoral Address" may be found the controlled apostrophe: "This people shapes its fate by placing its history into the openness of the overwhelming power [in die Offenbarkeit der Obermacht]."'s Heidegger's thinking is quite consistent in its deployment of archi- original reduction. "Power," "violence," like "spirit-in-flames," "evil," each preoriginal Event of Being, laid bare, manifest, or revealed, are all notions of prelegitimate or nonlegitimate, anthropomorphic participation in cosmic force; they void by predating all the equiv- ocalities of legal constitution and its fate. They make it possible to evade the predicament of finding ourselves always in the middle not "of things," according to Heidegger himself (and in any case, "things" are always litigious), but of the reflexivity arising from the tension of the freedom and unfreedom, of the legitimacy and nonlegitimacy, of the form of modern law. Heidegger is consistent in refusing the conceptuality and conflicts of modern political theory. His oeuvre is haunted not by Geist, metaphysics of subjectity redivivus, but by the unacknowledged but evident diremption which he refused from start to finish, from origin to origin, to think.</page><page sequence="11">OF DERRIDA'S SPIRIT 457 Derrida's De l'esprit has a special dishonesty: a text in quotation marks, it offers a drama or playing out, throughout, and openly at the end. His actors have an author who, in his refusal of any delimitation-- for all "demarcation" is "contamination" - replays the whole tradition "in its continuity" and with overweening authority. His auditors are locked in the disgrace that Heidegger and his "Christian" interlocutors struggle to overcome: with originary and abyssal flames and ashes, "Is ash the Good or the Evil of flame?" (OS 97; DE 158);'9 with repetition in thought toward "the entirely other." Yet this sublimity of originary equivocation bars any investigation "of" abstract universality, "of" political history. The modern fate of Geist-the law of civil society and state producing its diremption and violent overcomings thereof-will erupt again and again as long as this structure persists. Fear of "contamination" is just the con- tamination itself--collusion by not comprehending what can be re- constructed. In the place and time of diremption and logos, we are given sublime origin and its pathos: systematic violence is bathed in this serein of originary violence. In fine, the gauntlet here taken up disputes "the continuity of the tradition": since the eighteenth century, "spirit" and "subjectivity" have been exposed and expounded as the form of the law and its inversions, and not as presupposing the irreducible "metaphysics of subjectity." Furthermore, Heidegger is utterly consistent in avoiding any acknowledgement of this modern predicament in the works from 1933 to 1953 under discussion and in general. May this consistency not begin to explain the attraction of Nazism--that it seemed to offer a way out of the unbearable modern diremption between subject and substance, between the forms of legal equality and the actuality of systematic inequality, out of that combination of insecurity and authoritarianism in economic, political, and social institutions which is quite contrary to liberal and democratic concepts of freedom and which generates the fantastical desire for the security of imaginary origins? Heidegger's concentration on the translation of Western techn6 back into its essence left him without phronesis but with great unironized authority. In this light his subsequent turn from Geist to Geistlich marks a further "retreat" from an unbearable political and social actuality that he still would and could not think- and which Derrida, after him, will not and cannot reconstruct. 6"NOTE" In addition to attempting an apologia for Heidegger's thinking in the face of his Nazism, De l'esprit provides the philosophical</page><page sequence="12">458 NEW LITERARY HISTORY foundation for Derrida's subsequent attribution of an ethical mean- ing to "deconstruction."20 Given his commitment to the ineluctable and irreducible contamination of all thinking, this attribution and its justification has taken the form of commentaries on individual texts by Cohen and by Benjamin in which their "contamination" by German nationalism is explored. In the course of these commentaries Derrida's own Heideggerian- ism has deepened. Like Heidegger, the process of whose thinking changed from ontological difference to das Ereignis, the Event of Being, Derrida's thinking seems to have changed from diffirance to originary event. Between the text and the now famous long footnote in De l'esprit, "originary evil" and "pre-originary pledge" or promise, prior to language and responsibility, are separately discerned by Derrida to pertain to a layer of Heidegger's thinking which lies deeper than "the question"-that residue of Enlightenment (OS 129- 36, 130, 131; DE 147-54, 148-49, 150). It is only in Derrida's later commentaries that this originary afterthought is systematically con- nected with originary violence, which in Heidegger's Introduction to Metaphysics (and echoed in the "Rectoral Address") founds the polis while remaining hypsipolis--without the city and its law.21 In the Benjamin commentary, "beyond Benjamin's explicit purpose" and under the title "Force of Law," Derrida defends the inseparability of the violence which founds law from the violence which conserves it by defining both as the promise of iterability (FL 997). Since even the origin is now contamination, universal contamination acquires a "diffrrantielle representivity" which consigns the originary violence to oblivion (FL 997, 1015). This Heideggerian reading, which Derrida consistently applies in what he concedes in relation to his Cohen commentary is "a strategically motivated attention" (IW 48), itself one of a number of examinations of "the Judeo-German psyche" (FL 977, n. 1), must be challenged. It must be challenged on a number of scores: first, as "close" readings of Cohen and of Benjamin which are not close at all, for they rest on the opposition between archeo-teleological and originary-eschatological metaphysics; second, as a style of argument: the perspective of universal "contamination" seems to legitimize universal elision so that affinities between fun- damentally different political philosophies may be insinuated in ways which effectively prevent issues of complicity or collusion being raised; third, because Derrida is presenting "deconstruction" as justice. This 'justice" is the mirror image of justice discredited as Hegelian- Marxist "grand narrative": deconstruction offers violence before the law, where grand narrative is said to have offered peace after law; and if, it may be protested, the "before" is not temporal but foun-</page><page sequence="13">OF DERRIDA'S SPIRIT 459 dational, then the "after" was never simply temporal but potential. Deconstructive 'justice" leaves us with a universal but general piety: primal violence may erupt through any legitimation. The perspective of originary iterability of law-founding and law-con- serving violence confirms the "mystical foundation of authority" to be the force of law, instead of demystifying it by showing how precarious legitimations always appear in historically specific con- figuration-form which relates universal, particular, and singular- and by showing how any justice, including deconstruction as justice, can only re/form universal, particular, and singular, however much it proclaims its "full negotiation" in the singularity-because-iterability of founding violence figured as conserving violence. "Deconstruction at work" is founding violence: "It inscribes iterability in originarity, in unicity and singularity" (FL 1003).22 Here I can only give some indications of how such a challenge might proceed: (1) To Cohen's argument in his essay "Deutschtum und Judentum" are imputed affinities with national socialism (IW 79, 84); to Ben- jamin's argument in his essay "Zur Kritik der Gewalt" (Critique of Violence) are imputed affinities with other thinkers hostile to par- liamentary democracy (FL 977, n. 3). These "contaminations" are not treated in the same way. Clearly distanced from Cohen's logism, Derrida betrays a special affinity with Benjamin's insight into the force of law, into law-founding and law-conserving violence, and with the perspective of language and representation as a fall from an originary language. These affinities lead in their turn to serious doubt about their structuring contraries when Derrida judges by extrapolation, in an appended conclusion, that Benjamin's opposing of divine, annihilating, undecidable violence to mythic, deciding violence of right would have led him to sacralize the Holocaust by thinking it to be a manifestation of divine, bloodless, expiatory violence (FL 975, 1040-45). However, the affinity of Benjamin's Ursprung with Cohen's logic of Ursprung and with the latter's messianic ethics, and the grounding of origin and messianism in both cases in a socialist politics is absent from either discussion. Yet in the thought of both Cohen and Benjamin it is the socialism which defines the messianism and the logic of origin, and, a fortiori, any "nationalism" or divine violence. For the Nazis it was racist transnationalism which determined the meaning of their "socialism." (2) Derrida's description of Cohen's essay as "hypernationalist" (IW 47, 50) repeats the elision between Heidegger and Hegel on nations discussed above (see p. 451). It overlooks the distinction</page><page sequence="14">460 NEW LITERARY HISTORY which Cohen makes between "nations" and "nationalities" -that is, between a universal polity and an "ethnic" or racist exclusive entity. Cohen condemns the latter, here and elsewhere, and argues that each nation will contain many nationalities.23 (3) Derrida attributes a "delirious" syllogism to Cohen: the middle term of Philo's Hellenistic logos justifies the kinship between the German-Lutheran and the German-Jewish "psyche" or spirit (IW 50-53). However, in Cohen's argument this "middle" serves to subordinate logic to ethics. Here and elsewhere, the middle is urged to Jews (all Jews, not just American Jews): to argue against Zionism and for the mission of the Jews to spread a universal ethical life by commitment to the states in which they find themselves and not by nationalist exclusivism. But Derrida does not begin to attempt to do justice to Cohen's address to the predicament of universalism and particularism in the idea and mission of Judaism.24 (4) It was Cohen's scarcely veiled definition of Deutschtum in terms of Judentum and not the other way round (of Judentum in terms of Deutschtum, as Derrida would have us believe) that led to the nu- merous critical reviews of the essay, and to his writing a second essay of the same title which he published the following year (1916) in order to try to correct the impression he had conveyed that everything good in German life was owed to the spirit of Judaism.25 Derrida does not mention this second essay or its rationale. (5) Contrary to several of Derrida's other claims, Cohen's idea of the universal mission of Judaism means that he did recognize other national Jewries, such as Spanish-Arabic; he did provide specific historical arguments for the importance of the German-Jewish com- munities-for example, their strategic position, after the expulsion from Spain, between the Western and Eastern communities; and elsewhere he frequently discusses Spinoza in these historical and political contexts. Reference to Spinoza is not necessarily to be expected in an essay devoted to the relation between German and German-Jewish history; while the extended discussion of Mendels- sohn's contribution to German and Jewish enlightenment shows Cohen's acknowledgement of the complex issues raised by the Spi- nozist inheritance (IW 54, 66).26 Overall, Derrida mystifies Cohen's relation to Spinoza by not discussing Cohen's thought as a system of freedom. (6) Of the relation between Cohen's exposition of Judaism and, after all, not Kant but the neo-Kantianism of his own three-part System, where Kantianism is itself transformed into productive origin and a messianic ethic of time and counterposed to a historical</page><page sequence="15">OF DERRIDA'S SPIRIT 461 exposition of capitalist exploitation of labor-power, Derrida shows no knowledge whatsoever.27 (7) Similarly any attempt to predict the shape of Benjamin's response to the Holocaust would have to locate his essay on language and his messianism in the scope of his socialism. How can the judgment that Benjamin would have sacralized the Holocaust be sustained in the light of his "Theses on the Philosophy of History," where the Angelus Novus, caught in the storm from Paradise propelling him backward to the future, saw even what was called progress as "one single catastrophe," and where a messianic history would proclaim that "even the dead will not be safe from the enemy if he wins. And this enemy has not ceased to be victorious."28 These "Theses" were written in 1939-40, and they too were strategic: they were designed to induce an intellectual break with the quietist triumphalism of the Marxisms prevalent at that time. (8) Even if one remains within the confines of Benjamin's essay "Zur Kritik der Gewalt," Derrida misrepresents its operation. For the contrast between divine, bloodless violence and mythic violence of right is only introduced at the end. It is not correlative to the distinction between law-founding and law-conserving violence as Derrida implies by setting out these sets of oppositions at the beginning of his commentary. In spite of the caution against trans- lating Gewalt as violence (FL 927, 981)-for Gewalt carries tones of power and governance, albeit not legitimate-the impression con- veyed by the use of "violence" is libertarian and anarchic. On the other hand, the translation of Recht as "law" instead of "right" confers a legitimacy on what is founded or conserved that was not intended by Benjamin but which Derrida seeks to foreground as formal law per se. As a result of these translation decisions, it becomes easier for Derrida to develop an eschatological and originary reading of Benjamin's essay by projecting onto it his own Heideg- gerian ontology. However, the essay presupposes Max Weber's definition of the modern state as claiming "(successfully) . .. the monopoly of the legitimate use of physical force within a given territory.""2 Challenges to that monopoly are explained by a functionalist argument on the uses of force, not by an eschatological reflection on originary violence. The concession of some of that force by the state, such as the guaranteed right to strike, serves paradoxically to preserve its own monopoly of legitimate force. Furthermore, far from equating non- violence with pure, divine violence, Benjamin discusses several forms of nonviolent resolution of conflict--between private persons and</page><page sequence="16">462 NEW LITERARY HISTORY by diplomats between states (FL 979, 991; CV 147, 143).30 (9) As a result of Derrida's originary approach to law-founding and law-conserving violence, Benjamin's account of modernity can only appear reactionary: cast solely in political terms, the hidden yet overblown law-founding violence of the police in modern de- mocracies is beyond the control of parliaments. Derrida insists that this position is reactionary, even if it is also revolutionary, for it implies a degeneracy from, and return to, a purer origin. However, Benjamin's political reflections presuppose a social theory of capitalist institutions, and amount to the search for a theory of revolutionary practice which will be neither reformist nor justify force as a means of right-making. The evocation of divine force, which can never be a means, is returned to the modern context so that the educative "philosophy of history of violence" may demonstrate that as long as force is used "mythically," as right-making means, it will prevent the abolition of state power (CV 151, 153-54). Here as elsewhere, and comparable to Rosa Luxemburg, Benjamin is exploring the relation of theory and practice for a truly democratic revolution which will inaugurate radical democracy at every moment and not postpone it to a post-revolutionary future when force, the "means," will have achieved its "ends." (10) Derrida's misconstrual of Benjamin's essay leads him, however, to a series of paradoxical formulations of deconstruction which culminate in a crisis for deconstruction itself. Deconstruction par- ticipates in what Derrida nominates "two violences": the divine which is "the decision without decidable certainty" and the state which is "the certainty of the undecidable but without decision" (FL 1035). In the "Post-scriptum," the consequence that the opposition between these two laws (which is also the opposition between divine violence and the order of representation, parliamentary democracy, and fallen language) would result in thinking the Holocaust in the biblical sense as indeed a holocaust, a divine manifestation and sacrifice, leads Derrida implicitly to refute the whole eschatological originary and "contamination" employed to define deconstruction as justice, when he insists that "we must think, know, represent for ourselves, for- malize, judge the possible complicity between all these discourses and the worst (here the final solution)" (FL 1045). This is precisely what deconstruction can never do because it has been defined as justice (divine?): "Justice in itself, if such a thing exists, outside or beyond law, is not deconstructible" (FL 945). "Deconstruction is also the idea of-and the idea adopted by necessity of-this diffirantielle contamination" (FL 997). Such claims are dec- larations: they leave their authority and legitimacy a mystery-and</page><page sequence="17">OF DERRIDA'S SPIRIT 463 leave it open for a false messiah to proclaim a tyranny. They leave us with the dilemma of mysterious, primeval violence versus mythical, formal law, between incomprehensible end and bloody means- when what needs investigation is the fate of modern law: the di- remption and discrepancy between its formal promises and the social actuality they presuppose and reproduce. Then the violent acting out of the nationalist or racist fantasies engendered by these dis- crepancies may be comprehended instead of being exalted to a pure originary violence or degraded to the violence of pure formal law as such. This would be to demystify law without compensatory myth and without hallowing history as holocaust. Only if we resist the temptation of the ontology of "originary contamination" can we begin to discern the complicities of our political history. To do that we need to be able to represent, to formalize, to think, to know, to judge-all the activities from which messianic deconstruction would disqualify us.
