<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Ideology of The Text BY FREDRIC JAMESON All the straws in the wind seem to confirm the wide-spread feeling that, as Roman Guarini used to put it, "modern times are now over," and that some fundamental divide, some basic coupure or qualitative leap, now separates us decisively from what used to be the new world of the early or mid-twentieth century, of triumphant modernism and the revolt against positivism and Victorian or Third Republic bourgeois culture. MacLuhanism, theories of the société de consommation and of post-industrial society, post-modernism in literature and art, the shift from physics to biology as the prototype of the hard sciences, the influence of the computer and information theory, the end of the Cold War and the ratification of a Soviet-American world system of "peaceful coexistence," the New Left and the countercultural instinctual politics, the primacy of the linguistic model with its ideological expression in Structuralism as a new movement - all of these phenomena testify to some irrevocable distance from the immediate past (itself reconfirmed by the surge of Thirties and Forties nostalgia everywhere in the advanced countries) at the same time that each offers something like an apologetics for its own version of the transformation: so the awareness that a change has taken place is subtly converted into a prophetic affirmation that the change is good, or, in the terminology we will follow in the present essay, the theory of the change becomes at length, through a process of inner momentum, the latter's ideology. It will be our contention that this apparently unavoidable slippage from what are essentially historical perceptions into the ideologizing of those perceptions is a function of an incomplete historical view and of the failure to make connections and on-going concrete modifications of the social order as a whole, the failure,- indeed, the unwillingness, to put all of these observations together and see them in terms of the long-range</page><page sequence="2">The Ideology of The Text 205 destiny of our particular socio-economic system, or in other words, monopoly capitalism. Even in the local regions enumerated above, however, this particular "great transformation"- grasped idealistically in terms of transformations in our modes of thinking rather than in those of more concrete structures or situations- has rarely been the object of a systematic anatomy. Rather, the new conceptuality has been enthusiastically developed and applied, in the absence of a measured and diagnostic investigation of what Collingwood would have called its "absolute presuppositions" or what more recent historians of ideas have called its basic paradigms (Kuhn) or its underlying epistémè (Foucault). The latter is an operation which seems best realized in individual probes rather than by way of some inconceivable global system; such is at any rate the strategy of the following pages, in which a few recent critical works have provided the occasion for more general reflexions on one of the more fundamental of the new conceptual categories, namely the idea of textuality. Textuality may rapidly be described as a methodological hypothesis whereby the objects of study of the human sciences (but not only of the human ones: witness the genetic "code" of DNA!) are considered to constitute so many texts which we decipher and interpret, as distinguished from the older views of those objects as realities or existants or substances which we in one way or another attempt to know. The advantages of such a model are perhaps most clearly visible in the non-literary disciplines, where it seems to afford a more adequate "solution" to the dilemmas of positivism than the more provisory one of phenomenological bracketting. The latter merely suspends the ontological problem and postpones the ultimate epistemological decisions, while in some ways actually reinforcing the old subject / object dichotomy which was at the root of the contradictions of classical epistemology. The notion of textuality, whatever fundamental objections may be made to it, has at least the advantage as a strategy, of cutting across both epistemology and the subject/ object antithesis in such a way as to neutralize both, and of focussing the attention of the analyst on his own position as a reader and on his own mental operations as interpretation. At once, then, he finds himself obliged to give an account of the nature of his object of study qua text: he is thus no longer tempted to view it as some kind of empirically existing reality in its own right (think, for instance, of the false problems to which the optical illusion of Society, or even of the various social "institutions," has given rise), necessarily reconstituting it in such a way as to resolve his</page><page sequence="3">206 FREDRIC JAMESON "facts" back into semantic or syntactic components of the text he is about to decipher. In fields like anthropology or sociology, in the lingering atmosphere of an older referential or "realistic" positivism, this requirement to "textualize" data serves the function of restoring the concrete contexts in which the so-called data was gathered, at the same time that it extends the interpretive situation to the totality of social life itself: this is the spirit in which the ethnomethodologists replace the events of social life with our accounts and interpretations of those events, and in which the newer anthropology seeks to dissolve the practices, habits and rituals which used to be thought of as so many "institutions" and to grasp them, in a new transparency, as so many types of discourse a social group holds about itself.1 Meanwhile, in linguistics itself, the concept of the text provides the means of breaking out of the artificial confinement of smaller and more abstract units of study like the sentence and evolving in the direction of pragmatics and text grammars which try to reincorporate the concrete context and positions of the participants back into what is otherwise a hypostasis of language - into purely verbal phenomena. It is possible, of course, to see the new textual model as a reflex of the changes wrought by the media, and the information explosion, in our experience of society and of the world: it is tempting, indeed, to associate the illusions of a traditional Aristotelian realism (reality existing calmly "out there," truth nothing but the adequation of the ideas in our head with the things themselves of which they are the pictures) with a world poor in messages, in which the shimmering heat waves of a swarm of signs and codes are not present to blur our limpid gaze across the distance that separates us from the realm of things. And it is certain that the sensitivity of recent times for problems of language, models, communication and the like, is closely linked with the emergence of these phenomena as relatively autonomous and opaque objects in their own right in the new distribution mechanisms of industrial capitalism. Still, such a picture of history, such a periodization, is in many ways what we will seek to criticize in the 1 "The central recommendation [of ethnomethodological study] is that the activities whereby members [of a given social group] produce and manage settings of organized everyday affairs are identical with members' procedures for making those settings 'account-able'. . .1 mean observable-and-reportable, i.e., available to members as situated practices of looking-and-telling."

At any rate, it would seem that the relevance of the concept of textuality is most problematic there, paradoxically, where it would seem the least metaphorical, namely in the realm of literary study itself. The paradox indeed is simply this: why and how the analysis of literary works can be transformed by a reminder of what it must have known all along, namely that its objects of study are "nothing but" verbal texts. A full-dress treatment of the issue would obviously involve a history of the term itself, which is traditional in the French educational system and thus somewhat less redolent of jargon than in English; and it would want to take note of the most elaborate theories of textuality, the massively architectonic one of Yurii Lotman, in his Structure of the Artistic Text (1970), as well as the more modish version of the Tel Quel group, developed primarily by Julia Kristeva, and insisting on the Text as a process of production in which some deep underlying genotext (its operations ultimately grounded either in the structure of language itself, or in that of the epistéme or dominant thought-form, if indeed one can distinguish between these two instances) generates a surface phenotext in the form of the individual work itself with its unique sentences. For the moment, suffice it to underscore the profound antagonism between the view of the literary object as text, or in other words as a perpetual production of sentences, and the more traditional one which valorizes the formal completeness of the literary masterwork, in which everything contributes to some organic whole. It is precisely because its very mode of presentation dramatizes this opposition that Roland Barthes' S/Z2 - a lengthy line-by-line commentary on a little known and romantically melodramatic novella of Balzac, "Sarrasine" - seems preeminently symptomatic for our present purposes, which involve the assessment of the results of textuality as a framework for literary analysis just as much as an account of the ideological service into which it may be pressed. I. S/Z is also symptomatic of the intellectual itinerary of Roland Barthes himself, of all the/axes of modern criticism (Lukács may be said in retrospect to have been the latter' s most stubborn hedgehog) surely the most exemplary. Like Lukács, indeed, had he never existed in the first place, someone like Barthes would have had to have been invented, 2 Page references throughout to the English translation by Richard Miller (New York, 1974), with frequent modifications: this sometimes elegant version is unfortunately not very trustworthy, to the point of occasionally inverting an already complex terminology, as when, e.g., p. 17, the word "signifie" is translated signifier.</page><page sequence="5">208 FREDRIC JAMESON for his virtuoso practice of critical methods was contemporaneous with a methodological explosion in the human sciences, and what is generalizable about his work is precisely his solution to the dilemma of methodological proliferation, which may be characterized, following Adorno's terminology in the Philosophy of New Music, as the valorization of pastiche. For the crisis in modern criticism is surely closely linked to that more fundamental crisis in modern literature and art which is the proliferation of styles and private languages; and Adorno had argued, in the Stravinsky section of his book, that the Russian composer's composition of music about other music was a characteristic and virtually text-book illustration of one of the two basic strategies of modern artists, faced with a crushing accumulation of dead styles in a situation in which it seems unjustifiable to invent still newer ones. (The hedgehog panel of Adorno's diptych was then represented by Arnold Schoenberg, who eschewed pastiche in favor of a relentless and sometimes forbiddingly inhuman totalization - a strategy which no doubt has its equivalent in modern literary criticism as well.) Of the first, eclectic, parody-or pastiche-oriented strategy (of which he himself offered the defense in his pamphlet, Critique et vérité), Barthes' work is the monument, constituting a veritable fever-chart of all the significant intellectual and critical tendencies since World War II: Bachelardian phenomenology (in his book on Michelet), Sartrean Marxism (in Writing Degree Zero), Hjelmslevian linguistics, but also Brechtean Verfremdung (in Mythologies), orthodox Freudianism (in On Racine), hard-core semiotics (in Systeme de la mode), Tel Quel textual productivity, as well as Lacanian psychoanalysis (in S/Z itself), post-Structuralism (in Le Plaisir du texte), and finally, a return, in that ultimate squaring of the circle which is his recent commentary on himself {Roland Barthes par lui-même), to origins, this most recent production, as he himself observes, reminding one of nothing quite so much as the subject of his own first published essay, namely the Journals of Andre Gide. Such a trajectory suggests that it is less productive to read Barthes as a theorist than as the intuitive and idiosyncratic practitioner of a host of different methods, whose perspicacity, shot through with sudden fits of boredom, makes the ultimate yield of such methods clearer than any theoretical disquisition. What happened to Barthes was, I think, that he became too conscious of what he himself calls the pre-critical or pre-systematic nature of his own observations, too lucid about the process of formation of his own sentences: this is the ultimate implication of his notion of the scriptible - sentences whose gestus arouses the desire to emulate it, sentences which make you want</page><page sequence="6">The Ideology of The Text 209 to write sentences of your own. (Meanwhile, the emphasis on the expressive and gestural capacities of the individual sentence tends with time to result in a virtual canonization of the fragment, although Barthes' increasing predilection for brief notes and glosses is perhaps evident in S/Z, where it is motivated and "covered" by the traditional requirements of the exegesis or line-by-line commentary.) Still, it is evidently only a self-conscious sentence which can provoke such emulation, and this accounts for Barthes' need, in S/Z, to devise another category, namely the lisible or legible, to designate the dull and rusty lack of finish of the* so-called realistic or representational kind. For S/Z is also, ¡as we shall see, something like a replay of the realism/ modernism controversy, although its force certainly springs in part from Barthes' own ambivalence in the matter: "Things I Like: lettuce, cinnamon, cheese, spices, frangipan, newly mown hay (I'd like some 'taster' to make a scent out of it), roses, peonies, lavender, champagne, political désinvolture, Glenn Gould, ice-cold beer, flat pillows, toast, Havana cigars, Handel, measured walks, pears, white peaches, cherries, colors, pocket watches, ball-point pens, quill pens, main courses, coarse salt, realistic novels, the piano, coffee, Pollock, Twombly, romantic music," etc.3 It should be added, however, that the view of "realism" which emerges from S/Z is generally implied rather than directly stated, in a study whose object, an early work of Balzac and a throwback, like so much high-Romantic storytelling, to the older Renaissance-type novella, is distant enough from Balzacian realism, let alone the triumphant realistic discourse of the nineteenth century novel at its apogee. The essentials of Barthes' conception of realism are more succinctly exposed in a short essay, "L'Effet de réel," in which, as the title suggests, realistic narrative is defined less as a structure of discourse in its own right than as a kind of optical illusion, the production of a so-called "reality-effect" by means of a certain number of key details which function as signals. So it is with Michelet's observation that, when Charlotte Corday's final portrait was being painted in her death cell, "after an hour and a half, someone tapped softly at a little door behind her": the detail is without any genuine function, in the sense that it might easily have been omitted without damage to the narrative. What is more important is that in the strict sense it has no meaning - in contrast, let us say, to the expressivity of a "timorous" knock on a door or a "feeble" rapping on a wall, which would have converted this "sign" into a genuine symbol. Thus we can say that for Barthes the vehicle of a reality-effect is relatively indifferent; 3 Barthes par lui-meme (Paris, 1975), p. 120.</page><page sequence="7">210 FREDRIC JAMESON any number of other, analogous details would have done just as well; or in other words, unlike the canonical theorists of realism, Barthes' analysis suggests that the latter's content is what is least important in it, serving merely as a kind of pro forma credentials for the accreditation of the "referential illusion" on which such discourse depends. "The truth of this illusion is as follows: suppressed from realistic enunciation qua denotative signified, the 'real' returns to inhabit it as a signified of connotation; for in the very moment in which these details are supposed to denote reality directly, they do little else - without saying so - than to signify it: Flaubert's barometer, Michelet's little rear door finally have nothing to say but this: we are the real; it is the category of the 'real' itself (and not its contingent content) which is thereby signified; in other words, it is the very deficiency of signified as opposed to referent which becomes itself the signified of realism: a 'reality-effect' is produced, the basis of that unspoken category of verisimilitude which makes up the aesthetic of all of the standard works of modern times."4 It would be wrong, however, to conclude that this analysis, which so radically devalues the importance of content in realistic discourse, is for all that an example of some incorrigibly formalistic practice either: for the "reality-effect" would appear to be something more closely resembling a by-product of realistic discourse than a mark of its fundamental linguistic structure. And while Barthes does not go so far as to say that any type of discourse can on occasion, and as it were laterally, in passing, generate the "effet de réel," it would seem implicit in his description that what has hitherto passed under the name of "realistic narrative" is at least a mirage to the degree that it has nothing structurally to distinguish it from narrative discourse in general. A key term in the passage quoted above suggests the specificity of Barthes' approach here and explains how it can do the seemingly impossible and avoid categorization in either the formalistic camp or that of content-oriented analyses: this is the word "connotation," which may be said to designate the fundamental method of the early Barthes, one which persists on into more recent books like S/Z, where, as we shall see, it coexists uneasily with the later methodology of semiotics proper. The connotative method, indeed - derived from the work of the Danish linguist Hjelmslev and most fully codified by Barthes himself in the long theoretical conclusion to his Mythologies - differs from current semiotic practice in that, where the latter takes as its object of study the mechanisms by which signs function, the former is resolutely semioclastic (Barthes' own term) and finds its vocation in a 4 "L'Effet de reel", Communications 11 (1968), p. 88.</page><page sequence="8">The Ideology of The Text 21 1 denunciation of the ideological uses of signs which is irreconcilable with the "scientific" character of semiotics itself. Thus the analysis of the "reality-effect" outlined above is precisely an ideological one in its exposure of the illusion the realistic detail is designed to produce (the ideological purpose of such an illusion - the propagation of a belief in the "referent" or in nature - we will deal with later on in the present essay). The transcendence of form and content both can meanwhile be explained by a brief account of what Hjelmslev meant by connotation in the first place: to follow Barthes' helpful simplification, it is a kind of second-degree construction in which a complete previous sign (the combination signifier/ signified) is pressed into service in the edification of a new and more complex sign of which it becomes itself the signifier. Thus the words of an individual sentence bear their own intrinsic meaning within the "frame" which is proper to them (denotation), while at the same time the sentence as a complete sign in its own right (the words plus the meaning, or the signifier plus the signified) may be used to convey a supplementary meaning of a more stylistic type, such as elegance or social distinction, in a dialogue for instance, or a value of some kind, as when the sentences of a Flaubert or a Joyce proclaim, above and beyond their own denotative content, "I am Literature". The dissatisfaction of orthodox semiotics with this conception of a supplementary meaning or message which is the idea of connotation may be accounted for by the global character of the designation, which does not seem to allow much room for the more minute work of syntactic or semantic dissection: in effect, the connotative method seizes on the entire sentence or the entire sign as the vehicle for a supplementary meaning, thus virtually cutting itself off from the possibility of further analysis. The semiotic abandonment of the concept however has the signal disadvantage (it is of course a positive benefit for a discipline which wishes to flee the political into an untroubled realm of scientific research) of shutting down one of the few powerful instruments available to register the ideological. I would argue that there is a profound incompatibility between a "scientific" method, which seeks to restrict its work to pure positivities, and a dialectical one, which, thrusting its hands into the strange and paradoxical element of the negative, is alone capable of doing justice to "mixed" phenomena such as ideology, false consciousness, repression, and in all likelihood, connotation itself: one of the secondary interests of 5/Z, indeed, will be precisely this tension between the two approaches which runs throughout the work. In the present instance, however, the relatively spatial character of Barthes' objects of study in Mythologies (images,</page><page sequence="9">212 FREDRIC JAMESON photographs, relatively visual oppositions, faces and so forth) suggests a means of correcting the imbalance noted above, which would involve the temporalization of the concept of connotation and the reintroduction into it of process and of reading time. Such an approach would entitle us to speak now of a connotation-effect, which is produced at a particular moment in the reception of a sign, and which can be described as a kind of ninety-degree rotation in which form is momentarily transformed into a new type of content in its own right, without losing its older properties; so, not the detail itself, not the little rear door, but rather the very form of the narrative sentence itself at that point suddenly begins to emit a secondary message about historiographie discourse in general: and such a view, linking autoreferentiality and connotation, by making of the latter a textual event in its own right, would then permit this method to be reabsorbed into a more complex, yet still ideology-oriented, investigation of the text in question. At any rate, the tension between semiotic and semioclastic aims in S/Z reappears in a somewhat different register as a tension between text and form, or more precisely, between modernism and realism, in Barthes' view of the Balzacian novella itself. Such a coexistence between the two modes is of course itself a feature of the theory: "Thus the theory of the text tends to favor modernistic texts (from Lautréamont to Philippe Sollers) for a two-fold reason: such texts are exemplary because they manifest (to a degree hitherto unattained) 'the operation of semiosis in language and with the subject,' and because they constitute a de facto protest against the constraints of the traditional ideology of meaning. . . Yet, by virtue of the very fact that texts are massive (rather than cumulative), and that they do not necessarily coincide with the works themselves, it is possible to discover textuality [du texte], although to a lesser degree, even in older productions; a classical work (Flaubert, Proust, why not even Bossuet?) may well include layers or fragments of écriture . . ."5 Therewith the fundamental purpose of S/Z is set: to track and uncover "du texte" in Balzac, to expose layers and traces of textuality in what seems otherwise a traditional or even relatively conventional 5 "Texte", article on the theory of, in Encyclopaedia universalis, vol. XV (1973), p. 1016. (The word semiosis, derived from Peirce, designates that process of the interpretation of signs whereby, in a properly infinite series, a new sign is proffered as an explanation, interpretation, or translation, of the older one. For an approach to semiotics based on this notion, one which successfully surmounts the strictures made on classical semiotics in the present essay, see Umberto Eco's Introduction to Semiotics [Bloomington, Indiana, 1975].) And see, for an earlier statement of Barthes on the nature of textuality, "De l'oeuvre au texte", Revue d'esthétique, XXIV, 3 (1971), pp. 225-232.</page><page sequence="10">The Ideology of The Text 2 1 3 narrative. This is why it would be unwise to expect the kind of systematic attention to the plot of "Sarrasine" which we have learned from other types of narrative analysis, such as those of Lévi-Strauss, Propp and Greimas, whose effort is directed towards the reading of the events of the plot as a complete message of some kind; or traditional Anglo- American studies of fiction, which remain stubbornly committed to the principle that all of the elements of a masterowrk - style, images, episodes, etc. - cohere in some harmonoius ethical or thematic statement which it is the business of the critic to recover. The latter is indeed generally stigmatized by the theorists of the text as interpretation in the bad sense, while even the relatively "value-free" decipherment of the former remains holistic and demands a kind of distance, a kind of speculative leap in the grasping and positing of narrative holes, which the minute and microscopic focus of Barthes' commentary can scarcely accommodate. This also results, it should be observed in passing, in the repression of one whole area of historical reality, namely that of the evolution of narrative form itself: for, ironically, the Barthes of S/ Zis in no position to convey the purely formal connotations which result from Balzac's adaptation of older storytelling conventions to the newer reified and quantified narrative and social materials of his own time, a perspective to which we will return at the end of this essay. Still, it would be a mistake to think such considerations have been completely eliminated from Barthes' commentary: in fact, S/Z, like the novella of which it is a study, may be said to be very much a mixed or hybrid object, and just as "Sarrasine" will include elements of textuality within an older "classical" or traditional form, so we may suggest that S/Z itself combines both realistic and modernistic features. For within the "modernistic" text-oriented structure of the commentary form, we may also from time to time detect elements of some older "realistic" or "representational" critical essay on Balzac, to which an earlier Barthes, one less addicted to the fragment, might well have lent the lapidary and elliptical form familiar to readers of Writing Degree Zero or of his Collected Essays. This more conventional study might then have been resumed as a thesis about the relationship between castration and artistic production in Balzac's tale (which involves the passion of a sculptor for a castrato), an anecdote then transformed by the "frame" of the novella into an exchangeable commodity in such a way as to make a statement about the relationship between classical storytelling and capitalism. Having dealt with this "realistic kernel" of S/Z elsewhere,6 6 "Balzac's novella speaks to us at once of itself and of its subject-matter, of art and of desire, both of which are present, with reversed emphasis, in the frame and in the actual tale alike. In the frame, the narrator tells a tale in order to seduce his listener; while</page><page sequence="11">214 FREDRIC JAMESON however, I will here limit myself to the in any case far more central "modernistic" focus of its "textualization" of Balzac. It is, of course, Barthes' disentanglement of the codes of Sarrasine which is trie most dramatic embodiment of the new textual methods, rewriting the structure of narrativity in terms which will not be unfamiliar to the reader of Pound: "The text, in its mass, is comparable to a sky at once flat and smooth, deep, without edges and without landmarks; like the soothsayer drawing on it with the tip of his staff an imaginary rectangle wherein to consult, according to certain principles, the flight of birds, the commentator traces through the text certain zones of reading, in order to observe therein the migration of meanings, the outcroppings of codes, the passage of citations." (14) The notion of the musical score, which will not be long in following this one, introduces, however, as we shall see, the phenomenon of temporal succession into this splendidly spatial image, whose counterpart may be found in the very etymology of text itself, literally a tissue woven together by those fundamental molecular components of narrativity which are for Barthes the codes: "In their interweaving, these voices (whose origin is 'lost' in the vast perspective of the already-written) de-originate the utterance: the convergence of the voices (of the codes) becomes writing, a stereographic space where the five codes, the five voices, intersect: the Voice of Empirical Realities (the proairetisms), the Voice of the Person (the semes), the Voice of Knowledge (the cultural codes), the Voice of Truth (the hermeneutic codes), the Voice of the Symbol." (21) What is tempting for that part of our minds which is still under the spell of an optical illusion of scientific rigor, what may be termed a kind of Cartesian idol in its own right, is the notion that the text may thereby be broken up into its minimal unities and the latter carefully and in business-like scientific fashion analyzed one by one: from this point of view, of course, all interpretation of the other type described above is inadmissible precisely because it is holistic and speculative, and seems to grasp intuitively at wholes which are nothing but imaginary objects within the tale itself an artist is destroyed by his desire, leaving only its representation - a statue and a portrait of Zambinella - behind in the catastrophe. This passion is narcissism and castration: the infatuated artist in reality sees his own image in the castrato with whom he falls in love, so that the gesture of symbolic castration or sexual renunciation is here given to be the very source of artistic productivity, just as it turns elsewhere in the story to be the very source of the Lanty family's mysterious fortune (Zambinella as prima donna). The fable thus has something to say about the origins of classical art and the origins of capitalism and their relationship to each other; yet it does not leave the frame within which it is told intact. Rather, it contaminates teller and listener alike, who separate at its close, in the desexualized and desexualizing atmosphere, without having consummated their desire." F. Jameson, The Prison- House of Language (Princeton, 1972), p. 148.</page><page sequence="12">The Ideology of The Text 2 1 5 from the point of view of the patient and minute dissection of the text by its painstakingly scientific analyst. Unfortunately, perception does not work in this additive fashion, neither in storytelling nor in the visual arts, where the Gestalt refutations of the notion of some atomistic combination of small sensations into unified perceptions is the most striking reply to the Cartesian procedure. Hence the very real dangers of the commentary form as practiced here, which encourages a laborious enumeration of detail through which the essentials tend to slip (Barthes himself, in another context, mentioned that game described in a novel of Agatha Christie in which the more experienced player chooses a place name that marches so boldly across the map - e.g., E U R O P E - the other participants do not even notice it). Barthes' five codes fall into two groups, and the distinction is not without its symptomatic value. The first group - those of the semes (Code of the Person), of cultural commonplaces (Knowledge), and of the Symbol, - are essentially batches of what he elsewhere calls indices, that is, short-hand supplementary or parametrical messages which are drawn from some more basic pool of shared cultural attitudes which permit us to decipher them (so, in a well-known example, Barthes reads the four telephones on James Bond's desk as an index of "advanced bureaucratic technology": here the index might be seen as something like a non-ideological connotation). This is perhaps the moment to remind the reader that the term "code," drawn from information theory, has little more than metaphorical value when applied, not to first-degree communications, but rather to those "secondary modeling systems" which are verbal representations. There are, it would seem, two relatively distinct uses of the term which are useful in articulating or underscoring linguistic realities that might otherwise pass unnoticed. In the first use the word code, in the singular, is coupled with the notion of a message, so that the term forces the analyst to work more diligently at defining the structural affinities between the type of message emitted and the sign system or code through which it is conveyed. The other use is however rather different from this, inasmuch as it stresses the multiplicity of different codes, or sub-codes, at work in a given communicational act: thus, I convey a verbal statement, but accompany it by facial expressions which derive from an organized expressive system of their own, as well as gestures of the hand and shoulder which stem possibly from a different sign system (as when I imitate the gestural sign system of European speakers). In this usage, the emphasis has shifted to the contradictions, or at least imbalances, of the various codes among each other; and it is in this sense that, characterizing the cultural</page><page sequence="13">216 FREDRIC JAMESON situation of the modern Gesellschaft, we speak of the proliferation or the explosion of codes as a symptom of the breakdown of the older social groups which were relatively unified linguistically as well as institutionally. In this sense, our own use of the term "code," drawn from a relatively technical and specialized discipline and applied to the quite unrelated one of literary study, is itself an example of code- switching. Still, one would think that these two approaches require of the analyst either, for the first, that he show the unity of the sign system or code utilized in the transmission of a given message, or, for the second, that he reveal the contradictions and inconsistencies between the multiple codes in such a way as to make those contradictions and that multiplicity available to us as a phenomenon for analysis in its own right.7 But essentially Barthes does neither of these things, and it is for this reason that one so often has the feeling that the commentary form, or the fragmented discourse, of S/Z tends to suggest that problems have been solved at the very moment in which they are becoming interesting. Thus, to take up Barthes' "semes" or Code of the Person, one can certainly, as he does, make an inventory of the various indices which a writer marshals as a kind of characterological shorthand (thus, the description of Sarrasine's peremptory entry into Bouchardon's studio, besides conveying a fact which accounts for his subsequent development as a painter, functions as a manifestation of that underlying character trait which is "Obstinacy"). Yet such an inventory would seem to have a merely lexical interest, even when certain "semes" are isolated which are culturally idiosyncratic (only a 19th century Frenchman would take this gesture as a sign of this attribute), or personally and stylistically determined (only Balzac would have tried to convey this particular nature through this kind of action). The larger issue at stake here is raised only incidentally when, in one of those splendid asides which are, of course, the whole reason for being of S/Z, Barthes passes from the semes or indices of the individual character to that which holds the entire character together as a substantive unity, namely the proper name itself: "To call characters, as Furetière does, Javotte, Nicodème, Belastre is (without keeping completely aloof from a certain half- bourgeois, half-classicist code) to emphasize the structural function of the Name, to state its arbitrary nature, to depersonalize it, to accept the currency of the Name as pure convention. To say Sarrasine, Rochefide, Lanty, Zambinella (not to mention Bouchardon, who really existed) is to maintain that the patronymic substitute infilled with a person (civic, 7 See my "Ideology of Form: Partial Systems in La Vieille Fille", Sub-stance, Winter, 1975.</page><page sequence="14">The Ideology of The Text 217 national, social), it is to insist that appellative currency be in gold (and not left to be decided arbitrarily). All subversion, or all novelistic submission, thus begins with the Proper Name." (95) With such an observation (echoing the classic chapter on naming systems in Lévi- Strauss; Savage Mind), we are on the threshold of one of the fundamental problems of narrative analysis, namely the relationship between the category of a "character" and the cognitive content (traits, ideas, symbolism) which makes a given character up. The structural analysis of narrative has developed out of a refusal of the surface phenomena of narrative itself, substituting for them its own terminology in much the same way that chemistry or physics substitutes the language and categories of atomic particles for the common-sense experiential data of physical substances like mud, rust, stones, wood or the like. Yet the concept of character alone has proved recalcitrant to this kind of analytic translation, and it is hard to see how the structural analysis of narrative can make any further theoretical progress without attacking this particular problem, which may be described as that of the stubbornly anthropomorphic nature of our present categories of character. At this point, clearly, the problem intersects with the vaster philosophic one of the historical nature of the Subject itself: but characteristically, Barthes takes his own observation as a vehicle for sounding his own fundamental theme of naturalisation (e.g., the proper name gives a natural appearance to what is essentially a historical determination of the person) to which we will return later. The cultural code is something like a storehouse of proverbial wisdom or commonplace knowledge about acts, events, and life in general, and will be articulated whenever a given detail needs motivation: in a sense, therefore, this code is the locus of ideology, albeit of a relatively inactive, non-functional type: one is tempted, indeed, to see it, not so much as a system in its own right, as any living ideology might be supposed to be, but rather as a kind of storehouse of older ideological fragments which can be appealed to now and then for a digression or an acceptable justification for some necessary move in narrative strategy. The basic object of study here would therefore be the various forms of what the Russian Formalists called "motiviation," that is to say, what has to be pressed into service to make a given detail pass unquestioned by the reader, or, to use what will presently become an ideologically charged term, to seem natural to him. Indeed, in an interesting article, Gerard Genette has suggested that verisimilitude - "le vraisemblable" - is</page><page sequence="15">218 FREDRIC JAMESON itself nothing but the degree zero of just such motivation, something like a cultural code which is able to dispense with its content.8 These considerations, of course, lead directly back to literary history insofar as a text of Balzac is a good deal more self-indulgent in this respect than would be any post-Flaubertian narrative: indeed, one of the new and self-imposed constraints of the latter is precisely to reinvent something like Genette' s notion of the "vraisemblable" by eliminating all recourse to such cultural codes and motivations which are so common to Balzac. At the same time, it should be observed that Barthes' Cartesian method, his pursuit of nothing but the minimal unities, obscures another fundamental role played by just such cultural codes, namely the overall organization of narrative ironies, as when, in the cumulative disasters of some naturalist novel, we sense the active in- forming presence of a commonplace of the proverbial type (e.g., waste not want not, or pride goeth before a fall, etc.). The relationship between the global structure of a long narrative and such ideational or conceptual elements has never been adequately studied, and this is all the more surprising in view of the fact that one of the deepest vocations of the twentieth century novel has been its attempt to expunge just such elements which are rightly felt to be vestiges of older and more superstitious thought-ways: we shall return to this problem shortly in connection with another of Barthes' codes. The enigmatically designated Code of the Symbol proves to designate bodily and sexual realities in a fashion preeminently characteristic of Barthes, who has always insisted on the body as the locus of a particular kind of non-uni versalizable private dimension of language. And as in his own work, the materials of this code range from the Bachelardian psychoanalysis of the elements to the Lacanian motifs of castration and phallic signifiers. Paradoxically, it is in this private and relatively ahistorical realm more than elsewhere that the lack of genuine historical reference proves limiting: for one would want to find these observations grounded in some sense of the incomparably poor physiological reality of Balzac's style when compared to the later instrumental registers of Flaubert or of Zola. On the whole, however, it would seem clear that the purpose of these three ("reversible") codes is to probe for the roots of the intelligible detail (the "seme") on the one hand in the socially conventional or ideological (the Code of Knowledge) and on the other in psychoanalytic (that of the Symbol). Here, then, concealed beneath a scheme of code 8 See "Vraisemblance et motivation," Communications 11 (1968), pp. 5-21.</page><page sequence="16">The Ideology of The Text 219 classifications, we once again touch on that fundamental option of contemporary criticism (sociology versus psychoanalysis), which is itself a prime symptom of the fundamental split in modern life between the public and the private, the political and the sexual, between the untotalizably collective and the alienated experience of the individual. We may wonder, however, whether the procedure of assigning each of these dimensions to a different code really helps to clarify this dilemma (in fact, it would seem to presuppose that each dimension of being had found adequate expression in a full code or sign-system of its own), or whether the concept of various codes here merely forestalls the problem and prevents it from being adequately explored. Certainly, in the case of the ideological materials, it is clear that Barthes is concerned, in his later, semiotic period, to defuse this material and to reduce it to data as inert and malleable as possible (and we have seen how the conceptualization of ideology as mere cultural and proverbial knowledge achieves precisely this aim). The other two codes are clearly, and by Barthes' own admission, of a quite different structure, inasmuch as, in his term "irreversible," they are forms in time, and thus, passing now into musical figures, far more akin to melodic structures than to the harmonies of the previous "reversible" types: "The readerly text is a tonal text (for which habit creates a reading process just as conditioned as our hearing: one might say there is a reading eye just as there is a tonal ear, so that to unlearn the readerly would be the same as to unlearn the tonal), and its tonal unity is basically dependent on two sequential codes: the revelation of truth [hermeneutic code] and the coordination of the actions represented [proairetic code]: there is the same constraint in the gradual order of melody and in the equally gradual order of the narrative sequence . . . The five codes mentioned, frequently heard simultaneously, in fact endow the text with a kind of plural quality (the text is actually polyphonic), but of the five codes, only three establish permutable, reversible connections, outside the constraint of time (the semic, cultural and symbolic codes); the other two impose their terms according to an irreversible order (the hermeneutic and proairetic codes)." (30) It should be observed, however, that to name a thing does not always suffice to explain it: in particular, in the structural analysis of narrative from Propp's on, Morphology of the Folktale, an unjustifiable use has been made of the term "irreversibility", as though it did any more than to designate the basic problem to be accounted for, namely that of the diachrony or sequentiality of narrative discourse. In many ways, it is the proairetic code - that of empirical realities, or</page><page sequence="17">220 FREDRIC JAMESON of the ordinary gestural and circumstantial unities of everyday life - which raises the most interesting issues for future study. What Barthes describes here is something like a dialectic of names, and of the realities - he calls them the "folds" - designated by those names: "What is a series of actions: the unfolding of a name. To enter! I can unfold it into 'to appear' and 'to come inside.' To leave! I can unfold it into 'to want to,' 'to break off,' 'to go on my way.' To give!: 'to present the opportunity,' 'to hand over,' 'to accept.' Inversely, to establish the sequence is to find the name: the sequence is the currency, the exchange value of the name. By what divisions is this exchange established? What is there in 'Farewell," 'Door,' 'Gift'? What subsequent, constitutive actions? Along what folds can we close the fan of the sequence? . . . The proairetic sequence is indeed a series, i.e., 'a multiplicity possessing a rule of order' (Leibnitz), but the rule of order here is cultural (habit, in short), and linguistic (the possiblity of the word, the word pregnant with its possibilities). . . Thus to read ... is to proceed from name to name, from fold to fold; it is to fold the text according to one name and then to unfold it along the new folds of this name. This is proairetism: an artifice (or art) of reading that seeks out names, that tends towards them: an act of lexical transcendence, a labor of classificaiton carried out on the basis of the classification of language." (82-83) At this point, indeed, we may glimpse an exploration of the "proairetic" code which leads in a different direction than that explored by Barthes, and which would be comparable to his observations here only as a kind of x-ray of the molecular structure of the textual substance might be juxtaposed with something on the order of a psychology of perception in which the activity of reading, like that of visual perception, is seen as the construction of meaningful wholes or Gestalts out of the initial raw material of verbal stimuli. Here the most suggestive methodological discussion is furnished by Gombrich's classic Art and Illusion (1960), which, drawing independently on Roman Jakobson's views of language, has proto-structuralist credentials of its own, and whose more orthodox account of the nature and function of an artistic code has interesting and quite different implications for the whole realism /modernism controversy than those implied by Barthes himself. Gombrich is of course arguing/or representationality just as strongly as Barthes is arguing against it: yet his apologia of the realistic mode does not take the path of the more traditional valorization of the object - of "reality," historical, social or natural - against mere artistic formalisms. It is not an apologia based on mimesis, but rather seeks to</page><page sequence="18">The Ideology of The Text 221 insert between subject and object that third and more properly structuralist realm of artistic and perceptual codes which are the painter's essential medium: thus the latter does not paint images which look like things, but rather works out and sharpens a set of relationships (the classic binary oppositions, in this instance between figure and ground, light and shade, and the like( which may then be perceived to be analogous to the relationships which make up our perception of the object. It is the binary pairs which are matched, not the objects themselves; the parole of the various visual styles, of the languages of painting itself, which is then - sometimes naively and unconsciously - read as being an artistic equivalent for a complex of non-linguistic perceptions.9 It is not, however, this aspect of Gombrich's account of the psychology of artistic perception which is comparable to Barthes' codes, for the latter is not really interested in the binary oppositions which organize narrative perception, and we would have to go to Levi-Strauss' studies of myth for something analogous in the literary realm. It is at a somewhat later step in his reasoning that Gombrich will have something suggestive to tell us about the problems raised by S/Z. The art historian is indeed involved in a battle on two fronts: on the one hand, through his assertion of an intermediary realm - that of the artistic code - between the subject and his object in the real world, he seeks to dispel the illusions of a naive realism, and in particular what might be called the Whorfian hypothesis about the relationship between artistic sytle and actual perception. Whorf s name is of course associated with the idea that the structure and inner limits of a given language may be at once translated into propositions about the structure and inner limits of its speaker's thinking: applied to the languages of art, this suggests that readers whose minds have been enlarged by the complex perspectives of narrative realism as Auerbach showed the latter to have been developed over a number of centuries will necessarily have a more adequate instrument at their disposal for deciphering external reality than would have been the case for earlier generations. We will return to this hypothesis later; suffice it to say that Gombrich's attempt radically to dissociate style and perception - based on the reductio ad absurdam of a view which would finally suggest that only post-Renaissance Europeans have ever seen a three-dimensional world! - is not altogether satisfying either. But his other conceptual adversary is something like the reverse of this one, and is constituted by the very psychologists whose work Gombrich 9 See Art and Illusion (Princeton, 1960), Chapter I, pp. 33-62.</page><page sequence="19">222 FREDRIC JAMESON had seemed to draw in making his first point: here the target is what he considers to be the imaginary entity of those atomistic "sensations" on which, according to the psychologists, perception is itself constructed: the meaningless data of the various visual stimuli which are then ultimately, through some mysterious process of transformation, metamorphosed into the recognizable objects of a familiar external world. For Gombriach, indeed, the existential reality of such a fictive entity as the visual sensation is simply the painted canvas itself, as, particularly since impressionism, it has seemed to offer the evidence of a host of unrelated and fragmented colors and brush strokes which magically, as we step away from it, reorganize themselves into, say, the Mont Sainte Victoire. Still, the existence of phenomena like caricature - a few bare lines which cannot be read in any other way than as some well-known face - suggests what will be Gombrich's basic hypothesis in this area, namely that the visual raw materials are reordered into a meaningful parole or artistic perception through the intervening agency of what he calls schemata - a storehouse of ideas of things which trigger our recognition of them in the language of art - or in other words very precisely what Barthes means by proairetisms or the code of "empirical realities" ("la Voix de l'Empirie"). The Gombrich version of this concept strikes me as more suggestive than that of Barthes, however, precisely because it seems to open up a whole realm of conceptual categories to our exploration, a realm in principle extending all the way from the isolated individual gesture to that of some overall generic comprehension itself. To be sure, for both writers, the immediate examples tend to be relatively local ones: thus, for Gombrich, the various recognizable natural phenomena which make up a Constable landscape, and, for Barthes, the various acts (coming and going), the various emotions (anger or sadness), the various gestures (a curious glance, a sudden look of bewilderment), whose conventional names provide our means of organizing the necessarily sketchy indications furnished by the narrative sentences themselves. And to be sure, the proof a contrario - the various examples of a pre-Brechtian estrangement-effect of which, for instance, we find so many in Tristram Shandy, those lengthy anatomies of a given physical gesture which force us to search for the identifying name which has been withheld - has also tended to find its privileged objects in the smaller unities of gesture and individual act. Yet I would suggest that such schemata have a much vaster functional role, particularly in more traditional narratives, one customarily assimilated to an illicit didacticism and moralism and which the present view for the first time puts us in a position to explore</page><page sequence="20">The Ideology of The Text 223 properly. This is the whole area of a kind of conventionalized identification of human experience itself, one which finds linguistic codification not so much in names - the experiences are a little too complex for that - as m proverbs and conventionalized poetic "ironies" of all kinds. The proverbial wisdom, however - "pride goeth before a fall" - is not so much a lesson to be taught by the events of a given narrative as it is rather the name of a recognizable destiny and of a single overall meaningful unity of human experience, and the reader uses it as a schema in precisely Gombrich's sense, a way of organizing the various, still fragmented events furnished by the narrative into a Gestalt whose form is its meaning. This is the way in which something like a psychology of perception might be developed for narrative analysis itself: yet it is conceivable only at the price of breaking with the kind of Cartesian attachment to visible analytic minimal unities which is reinforced by Barthes' commentary method in S/Z: for the most interesting narrative schemata lie on the most distant circumference of the hermeneutic circle, and, like the distance which alone permits us to identify the object in a landscape of Cezanne, are never present as positivities at any moment of the text itself, their existence deducible only by inference, from the forms into which its events slowly arrange themselves. Such an approach would then allow something like an inventory of the various conventional concepts of human experience operative at a given historical moment, in a given social formation and in the narratives which find currency within it. What is more interesting in the present context is that it is precisely as a break with such narrative schemata that literary modernism can be understood, and here again, the analogy with the history of painting is a revealing one. For surely nothing has been felt as quite so illicit and unjustifiable by modernist aesthetics than the operation of just such tacit and subterranean, even ideological, messages of the type described above: modern literature's break with plot is in reality far better understood as a break with the older narrative schemata, which are felt - rightly - to be indefensible conventional presuppositions about the nature of life and experience. The dilemma of the plotless novel then only emerges when it becomes clear to what degree plot is itself structurally inseparable from just such conventionalized schemata, which alone permit the reader to grasp a long series of events and pages in the unity of some larger form. What happened in painting may serve as a dramatic object lesson in such a process, where description fatally overturns into prescription, and the new "scientific" descriptions of the process of perception are themselves transformed into a program for the production of a</page><page sequence="21">224 FREDRIC JAMESON perceptual art of a wholly new type. This is of course what happened in impressionism when the psychological accounts of the organization of atomistic sensations into larger perceptual wholes were enlisted in an attempt to make painting reflect this psychology "more truthfully" than did the older classical type: clearly, contemporaries of such a scientific "truth" were unable to persevere calmly in the conviction that their world of appearance - that of the ordinary recognizable perceptions of everyday life - was stubbornly accompanied by some ghostly realm of reality - or in other words, the stimuli and sensations supposedly at work in the retina of the eye, "objectively," and before any transformation into the merely subjective impressions of perception. They therefore itched to turn their own appearances back into realities; and much the same may be said for Barthes' revelation of the "textuality" at work within Balzacian narrative, that it cannot but be seen, no matter what the formal disclaimers, as a kind of manifesto which urges the substitution, henceforth, in the literature of the future, of the most uncompromising textuality for all such older pre-textual narrative forms: so difficult is it to identify something like this so-called proairetic code without at one and the same time calling for its abolition. When we turn, finally, to the last of Barthes' five codes, the hermeneutic one, it does not seem superfluous to object to the confusion which is bound to arise when, for what might more properly be called the Code of Enigma, Barthes revives the ancient term for the very science of interpretation itself. He no doubt wishes thereby to stigmatize this concept of critical activity in the process; yet it seems worthwhile observing that following Hans-Georg Gadamer a whole group of critics have chosen this term as a slogan for their practice - in contradistinction to the text-oriented or structural type of work here under study - of an analysis of literature in terms of reader response.10 What Barthes has in mind, however, is the emphasis of the classical storyteller on sensational disclosures and his consequent misuse of all the rhetorical mannerisms which hold the reader in suspense and whet his appetite for melodramatic satisfactions. And it is clear that in its overall plan just as much as in its sentence-by-sentence detail Balzac's tale of the horrible secret behind the Lanty fortune is profoundly ideological in its projection of a whole series of tacit presuppositions 10 See, for instance, Wolfgang Iser, The Implied Reader (Baltimore, 1974), and two important program articles of the so-called School of Konstanz, Iser's "Indeterminacy and the Reader's Response in Prose Fiction" (in Aspects of Narrative, ed. J. Hillis Miller [New York, 1971]), and Hans Robert Jauss, "Literary History as a Challenge to Literary Theory" (in New Directions in Literary History, ed. Ralph Cohen [Baltimore, 1974]). And see, for an analogous approach, Stanley Fish, Self- Consuming Artifacts (Berkeley, 1973).</page><page sequence="22">The Ideology of The Text 225 about the nature of time and events, the role of origins, the relationship of past to present, and so forth. It has become conventional to associate these presuppositions with the so-called "closed form" of the traditional novella or storytelling plot, and Sartre is no doubt perfectly justified in suggesting, in What is Literature!, that the frame novella, with its comfortable afterdinner audience taking in an anecdote along with their cigars and brandy, projects human action as "a brief disorder which is suppressed . . . told from the point of view of order. Order triumphs, order is everywhere, and contemplates an ancient abolished disorder as though the motionless water of a summer day preserved the ripples that once crossed it." What is new in Barthes' denunciation of such classical plots (besides the relationship he established in this particular one between castration, storytelling, and the commodity) is the assimilation of the classical reader's desire for plot resolution to that more fundamental commitment of bourgeois ideology to a conception of objectivity and absolute truth which had already been the object of the critique of the Tel Quel group. The solution to the enigmas of plot, indeed, the kind of reading which attaches itself to finding out how everything turns out in the end, thus become profoundly ideological activities in their own right, and something like the aesthetic equivalent of the quasi-theological need for certainty of bourgeois thinking in general. Here also, one would like to distinguish between the practice of something like an empty form - those "irreversible" sequences opened and closed by the so-called hermeneutic code (the mysterious wizened figure of the opening pages, whose identity is revealed in the concluding ones) - and the supplementary ideological message for which this particular form is then used: and it is clear that here, once again, we find ourselves in the presence of that peculiar operatory overdetermination for which early Barthes reserved the term connotation. Still, the issue is a good deal broader than that of melodrama and of the code with which Barthes associates it: in its more general form, it concerns a literary phenomenon - irony (now understood in a more local and stylistic sense than we used the term above) - in which Balzac's text is relatively poor; before evaluating the ultimate premises of S/Z, it therefore seems worthwhile to turn to another recent work in this tradition, namely Jonathan Culler's study of Flaubert (Ithaca, 1974), whose title, The Uses of Uncertainty, suggests its affinity with the French positions, the need for "certainty" in this context designating something very much like that mirage of absolute truth denounced by Tel Quel and tracked by Barthes into the most minute folds and articulations of the "hermeneutic" code.</page><page sequence="23">226 FREDRIC JAMESON II. Flaubert is in any case the historical f ountainhead of an aesthetics of textuality, and, unlike the Balzac of Barthes, may be said for Culler to represent the first genuinely ¡scrip tibie novelist in terms of which the older "legible" and traditional ones are explicitly or implicitly comdemned. But Culler's book is not only a study of Flaubert, it is a study of Flaubert's interpreters as well, and where Barthes, faced with the apparent formal unity of the older novella, set out to pulverize the text and to shatter it into its multiple codes, Culler's "metacommentary" makes its point by a series of snapshots gleefully arresting the various Flaubertians in the act of desperately trying to put their master back together again. So Culler has a field day detecting the nostalgia for meaning in a host of Flaubert commentaries, beginning with Charles Bovary's hideous cap and all of the attempts uncomfortable critics have made to transform it into a symbol of one kind or another, that is to say, into a fully meaningful literary or verbal object. Yet the cap solicits interpretation: "its mute ugliness has the depths of expressiveness of an imbecile's face"; the critics have done no more than to rise to the occasion, and the resultant readings, which range from the psychological (Charles' personality) to the social and historical (the layers on the cap representing the strata of French society), become, in the present context, and like anyone's comments in front of the paintings in a museum, so many candidates for an enlarged sottisier. This is no doubt appropriate for those with temerity enough to pronounce themselves in public about a writer whose fondest hope, in collecting his file of clichés, was to make people afraid to open their mouths in the first place for fear of uttering one of them. The point is, of course, that Flaubert's terrorism aims not only at stupid remarks but also, and above all, at intelligent ones and at the secretly imbecilic face of all sentences which aim at finality, or, as Mr. Culler would put it, at certainty ("There are a whole crowd of such topics," Flaubert confided in a letter, "which annoy me just as much whatever way they are approached . . . Whether one speak good or ill of them I am equally irritated. Most of the time conclusions seem to me acts of stupidity.") So the critic of Flaubert's critics plays fair and chooses as his targets not the worst of the latter but the best: still, it remains an open question whether they could have done otherwise, faced with a text which demands interpretation at the same time that it undermines it: "It is as if the exuberant narrator, still characterized as a youth engaged in mocking the new boy, had set out to reveal 'depths of</page><page sequence="24">The Ideology of The Text 227 expressiveness' and been defeated by his run-away prose, and the critic who seeks the comfort of a world in which everything signifies must avert his eyes from this defeat and treat the object as a sign whose signifie is Charles." (93) But is not this simply to say that Flaubert - or his putative narrator in this passage - writes badlyi We have of course long seen Flaubert's revolution in terms of a destruction of rhetoric in the name of style (see Barthes, Writing Degree Zero)', what can this mean but that the systematic machinery of the rhetorical conventions, variously pressed into the service of oratorical ends or of such late effects as that of the "sublime", are here thoroughly subverted? For Culler, however, the resultant "style" is only incidentally, in Barthes' sense, a vehicle for private physiological expression; the principal function of such "bad writing" is rather the discrediting of the previous reading norms, and a stray description of Yonville, in Madame Bovary, allows us to witness the remarkable process whereby description of the older rhetorical type (ekphrasis in the terminology of the ancients) undergoes a sea-change into what can henceforth only be known as a "text": "It is not simply that each sentence appears to fritter itself away, as it runs down towards the minute and trivial; that is almost a by-product of the spectacle mounted by a prose style determined to show how grammatical devices enable it to link together a set of disparate and trivial facts . . . The particularity suggests a single scene, but the mode is one of generalization; and the result is simply that we do not know who speaks or from where. The narrator is depersonalized, in that we cannot give him a character which would explain and hold together the moments of his discourse. We have, in short, a written text, which stands before us cut off from a speaker." (76-77) Thus the text is organized neither objectively (according to the proportions of its object, which its various clauses and sub-clauses might imitate in some harmonious way), nor subjectively (through the consecutive experiences of a viewer which it might "render"), but is rather simply held together by "grammatical devices." The materials themselves are inert and fragmented, but it is as though the writer had discovered some new principle of order in the process by which the sentences are made to succeed each other across the page, the object of the game now being to marshal all the resources of syntax to prevent the reader from noticing how illogical is such a succession on the level of the content. (Mallarmé will then not long after this erect Syntax itself into the very narrative substance of his poems.) The kind of coherent meaning thereby discredited on the level of the</page><page sequence="25">228 FREDRIC JAMESON sentences is now shown by Culler to be analogous to that sought by critics on the level of the plot itself: here the principal exhibit is that climatic final meeting between Frederic and Mme. Arnoux, in L'Éducation sentimentale, whose "irony" is for him as self- contradictory as the clauses in those humble descriptive sentences in Madame Bovary to which we have already alluded: "Flaubert must be either deflating, with consummate irony, the illusions of the characters and revealing their supposed love as false posturing or he must be defending, in a deeply touching scene, the ideal nature of this transcending love." (152) The fact that neither of these mutually exclusive alternatives works may be taken as a symptom of the beginning crisis in the relationship between narrative and those proairetisms or schemata of which we spoke in the previous section: the latter are beginning to become unstuck, to wobble, they no longer function unequivocally as means of organizing narrative perception, yet the reader still gropes blindly for them, now applying the lens of the one, now the other, with imperfect and unsatisfactory results. Under those conditions, it is the characters themselves who must attempt to reorder their pasts: "since Flaubert will not oblige they must attempt for themselves to organize their lives as a nineteenth-century novel told from the point of view of order"; but their own, preeminently romantic reading is patently unsatisfactory: If we accept this reading of the penultimate scene [in other words, that devised by Frederic and Madame Arnoux themselves] we find we have made nonsense of our earlier perceptions and indeed of the explicit contrasts in terms of which the rest of the book appears to be constructed . . . This penultimate scene, which overcomes oppositions and produces a fragile romantic triumph, seems to step outside the line of development adumbrated by earlier scenes. It is not, that is to say, the logical culmination of an experience, which enables us to see what Frederic learned about love; it is rather an affirmation that while life must be lived and while this will entail disappointment and failure, nevertheless one can, if one proceeds with care, create a purified fiction which remains disconnected from one's experience. Instead of conferring meaning on earlier episodes and pointing to their lesson, it seems to empty the sentimental education, which is the ostensible subject, of the book, of the content which it appeared to have." (155) Such a reading, or an anti-reading, suggests that Mr. Culler's principal theoretical adversary - although he is nowhere mentioned here - is Wayne Booth, whose own work has been concerned to denounce precisely such "irresponsible ironies" as are here offered as</page><page sequence="26">The Ideology of The Text 229 textual models. A careful rereading of the Rhetoric of Fiction shows that the "immorality" and lack of narrative perspective of a Celine merely provides Booth with a particularly striking scapegoat; the real villain, as it should be, although identified with only the greatest of tact, is evidently Flaubert himself: "Henry James talks of Flaubert's 'two refuges' from the need to look at humanity squarely. One was the exotic, as in Salammbô and The Temptation of Saint Anthony, the 'getting away from the human' altogether.11 The other was irony, which enabled him to deal with the human without having to commit himself about it directly. But, James asks, 'when all was said and done was he absolutely and exclusively condemned to irony? Might he 'not after all have fought out his case a little more on the spot? Coming from James, this is a powerful question. One cannot help feeling, as one reads many of the 'objective' yet corrosive portraits that have been given us since James, that the author is using irony to protect himself rather than to reveal his subject. If the author's characters reveal themselves as fools and knaves when we cast a cold eye upon them, how about the author himself? How would he look if his true opinions were served up cold? Or does he have no opinions?" In reality, Booth and Culler have surprisingly similar views on the "meaninglessness" of Flaubertian narrative; only what the one rejoices in, the other repudiates; and it is useful, in drawing the consequences of an "ideology of the text," to juxtapose a critic whose attachment to the formal completeness of the individual work and the coherent message which masterwork will convey has led him to draw the final logical conclusions of his own postion, whether these be of an unpopular or old- fashioned moralizing kind, or, as in his new book, A Rhetoric of Irony, a plea for a restriction of the play of literary meanings to what he calls "stable ironies," that is, those which permit coherent interpretations, or in other words, what Mr. Culler would call "certainties": "The serious loss comes when readers, barraged with critical talk hailing the discovery of ambiguities as a major achievement, learn to live with blurred senses and dulled attention, and deprive themselves of the delights of precise and subtle communication that skillful stable ironists provide".12 And it is certain that what Booth calls 'irresponsible irony," that is, an irony which takes its own ironies ironically, engages me in a process of infinite regression to which I must ultimately put an end by confessing that I no longer know what is meant by the term irony in the first place. Clearly, then, it is for readers like myself that Booth's new 11 The Rhetoric of Fiction (Chicago, 1961), p. 85; and see, for further strictures on Flaubert, note 27, p. 373. 12 A Rhetoric of Irony (Chicago, 1974), p. 172.</page><page sequence="27">230 FREDRIC JAMESON book is intended, suggesting as it does that the term can only recover its function when restricted to its narrowest and most manageable sense: unfortunately, I do not really know what to do with this recommenda- tion either, since the texts in question already exist in history and cannot be wished out of being again. So it would seem that Culler has the last word, inasmuch as the climactic interview between Frederic and Madame Arnoux exists in writing, as a text, in spite of its "theoretical impossibility" (152) and against all attempts to assign it a coherent meaning. Nothing is indeed more irresponsible, from Booth's point of view, than a scene like this, which cannot be made to tell us something unambiguous about life; and Culler's examination of such self-unravelling mechanisms goes a long way towards explaining why this novel is one of the most fascinating|and exasperating of world literature, at one and the same time the richest and the emptiest of books, one immense failure and at one and the same time - perhaps precisely because we are never able to make final sense of it - one of the rare novels to which one can return endlessly without exhausting it, a veritable summa of sentences, an encyclopedia of everything it is interesting to see narrative language do. Still, we must take into account the possibility that Mr. Culler's victory may be a Pyrrhic one: for we cannot accept the implication that Flaubert is a kind of proto-existentialist, inventing diabolically meaningless objects which, like Donald Barthelme's immense balloon which one day sags down upon Manhattan, or the indecipherable sentient ocean of Stanislaw Lem's Solaris, have as their ultimate purpose the therapeutic humiliation of the pretensions of the human mind to understanding. Clearly, Charles' cap is not yet an object of this kind, and indeed, Culler distances himself from such an extreme position, testily characterizing as "arrant nonsense" the description by Nathalie Sarraute of Flaubert's works as "books about nothing, almost devoid of subject, rid of characters, plots and all the old,accessories." (134) Yet to say so puts his denunciation of Flaubertian "interpretation" in a somewhat different light: so it does not seem quite right to dismiss, as he does, Victor Brombert's reading of the landscape in Fontainebleau, through which Frede'ric and Rosanette wander during the June massacre of 1848 ("There is irony in those trees which, on the one hand, join each other high up in the air like immense triumphal arches, and on the other seem to be 'falling columns' . . . The political revolution is measured against the geological 'revolutions'. The 'immobilized Titans' remind us, in their angry pose, of the revolutionary fervour," etc.</page><page sequence="28">The Ideology of The Text 23 1 [quoted, Culler, p. 101]). To be sure, once the drive to interpret gets out of hand, and we transform all of these natural objects into symbols of history or nature or whatever, then all of Culler's strictures become applicable: yet Culler's own observations would themselves be impossible were we not precisely tempted by just such a longing for complete meaning. So, quoting other remarks by Brombert on the "feeling of numbness and torpor" aroused by this scene in L'Éducation sentimentale, Culler goes on to say: "It is as if he had responded to the scene in ways which seem wholly appropriate but had no other critical procedures for dealing with the text except those of symbolic interpretation. But it is not difficult to show that it is precisely through its resistance to the critical operations Brombert applies that the text produces the effects which he discerns." Resistance, yet invitation as well: for if, persuaded by Culler's reasoning, we decide to read Flaubert without any interpretive efforts whatsoever, the stuffing goes out of the novel in a different, but equally irremediable way. It seems more adequate to say that such passages are haunted by a symbolic meaning which never completely coheres with them; and that our practice of Flaubert's text - which can be neither interpretation itself nor some outright indifference to the interpretive process - is very much a matter of transgression in the self-contradictory sense in which Bataille applied that term to a certain kind of sexual gratification, which must reaffirm the norm in whose infraction it finds its own pleasure. To put it this way, however, is to wish to reexamine the unique structure of the Flaubertian text, and indeed the more general theory of the Text which emerges from it, in terms of their contradictions and within a framework which Culler does not really supply, namely that of history itself; yet it is appropriate, before doing so, to glance at the twist- ending with which he transforms his formal observations into considerations about the deeper content of these works. The mechanism is indeed that of Russian Formalism, in which content is at length seen as the projection of sheer technique; and Culler's account of the two major themes of Flaubert, his rage before the bourgeois "stupidity" of the present and his nostalgia for a Sacred for the most part projected into the distant past (the exception is Felicite's parrot in Un coeur simple), ingeniously converts both into thematisations of the peculiar type of reading demanded by the text. Thus, stupidity becomes "the operation which reduces [the world] to a surface and makes it a series of signs without meaning [thereby leaving] the subject free before it." (179) And if stupidity thereby stands as the condition of possiblity of the text as such, the sacred is then seen as the hypostasis of some ultimate, yet</page><page sequence="29">232 FREDRIC JAMESON impossible "parole pleine" or full interpretive certainty: "The Zaimph [the enigmatic sacred veil of Tanit in Salammbô] remains a symbol for a possible narrative integration which the text denies us"13. It is to designate this process of autoreferentiality that Culler then usefully revives the term allegory, now used in a hermeneutic rather than a pejorative sense. For to say that such symbolic or meaning-^projective elements of a text are to be grasped as allegories of the reading process itself, or in other words figures for the very attempt to interpret and to assign textual meanings, is, it seems to me, quite a different type of hypothesis from the rather static and now somewhat conventionalized allegorical interpretations of the Derrida school, which, e.g., by seeing Charles' cap as a figure of écriture and textual productivity, result in "certainties" no less unjustifiable and peremptory than the other kinds of interpretations Culler denounces.14 The advantage of his own approach is not only to make visible a whole range of autoreferential phenomena of this kind in traditional literature (one might, for instance, wish to see the preoccupation of a Proust or a Thackeray with memory as just such a disguised commentary on the sheer duration of the reader's reception of their own pages), but also to make possible a dialogue with that quite different, phenomenologically oriented, "hermeneutic" school of criticism referred to above, whose methods have not hitherto seemed compatible with those of the French or structuralizing tendency. And it is certain that we need a more adequate account of autoreferentiality in literary history than any which has previously been given: yet as Culler's demonstration of it in Flaubert alone suggests, without some more adequate historical framework, this particular phenomenon - with its suggestion of a kind of self-consciousness of the text about itself - is only too easily pressed back into the service of the old modernism/realism antinomy, to which we therefore return in our conclusion. III. So it is that we turn our attention to the kind of history projected by the ideology of the text, and the oppositions flexed and articulated by the critical works we have mentioned - legible vs. scriptible, certain vs. uncertain - all ultimately fall into place in terms of the old modernism/ realism dispute, of which the "ideology of the text" now 13 Veronica Forrest-Thomson, "The Ritual of Reading Salammbô", Modern Language Review LXVII, 4 (1972), quoted by Culler, p. 223. And see, for a related study, her "Levels in Poetic Convention", Journal of European Studies, II, 1971. 14 See Prison- House, pp. 177-183.</page><page sequence="30">The Ideology of The Text 233 becomes a contemporary replay. Indeed, the new terminology may be understood as the result of a French situation in which - paradoxically enough for the place in which it originated - modernism has borne no particular name as such (the word modernité, traditionally used in the sense of "modern times" in general, is only now coming to take on this meaning). I want to suggest that this opposition is an unsatisfactory one, from a historical point of view, and that the premature ideological but also ethical judgements which are made in its name must be seen as compensations for its structural incapacity to do justice to diachronic phenomena. But of course, from another point of view, the realism/ modernism oppostion is useful precisely in the kind of covert diachronic or genetic thinking it enables without declaring itself as such. Thus, we may observe that the division of literature into these two starkly antithetical tendencies (form-oriented vs. content-oriented, artistic play vs. imitation of the real, etc.) is dictated by the attempt to deal adequately with modernism, rather than the other way round (in this sense, even Lukacs' accounts of realism are defensive, and reflect his own "conversion" to the earlier artistic style). The concept of realism which thereby emerges is always that with which modernism has had to break, that norm from which modernism is the deviation, and so forth. It is as though, in spite of everything, only a historical and genetic approach to modernism, which leans fully as much on the story of the emergence of the new phenomenon, as on some ahistorical or synchronie description of its structure, could provide the proper account, for which, therefore, the straw man of "realism" was formally necessary. The proof of this assertion may be found in the peculiar fact that whenever you search for "realism" somewhere it vanishes, for it was nothing but punctuation, a mere marker or a "before" which permitted the phenomenon of modernism to come into focus properly. So, as long as the latter holds the center of the field of vision, and the so-called traditional novel or classical novel or realistic novel or whatever constitutes a "ground" or blurred periphery, the illusion of adequate literary history may be maintained. But as soon as our critical interest itself shifts to these last, we become astonished to discover that, as though by magic, they also have every one of them been transformed if not all into modernists, at least into precursors of the modern - symbolists, stylists, psychopathologists, and formalists to a man! That this should happen, in Culler's hands, to Flaubert is hardly surprising, for the historical peculiarity of Flaubert is that he can be read either way, as old-fashioned realism (now perfected !) or as sheer text. But it is more</page><page sequence="31">234 FREDRIC JAMESON surprising to find Genette, in the article referred to above, fall victim to this optical illusion: "Thus the predominance of the storytelling function itself proves to be, if not challenged, at least menaced, in a work which however passes for the very epitome of the 'traditional novel'. Another step, and the dramatic action will pass into the background, and the storyline lose its signifying primacy to the discourse itself: in a prelude to the dissolution of the novelistic form and the emergence of literature in the modern sense of the word. From Balzac to Proust for instance, it is not so far as one might think", etc. 15 Barthes cannot himself go quite this far, since he picked Balzac as an example of the "traditional" in the first place; yet his anatomy makes it clear just how much of the modern "text" is already flesh and bone of the older novella, and on the point of separating itself from it. It is with the modernists, indeed, a little like Goering and the Jews: they are the ones who decide what is modern and what is not, and the privative term of realism is reserved for books they do not happen to be interested in at that moment (the minute they become interested, the modernity of the writer in question will not be long in disclosing itself). The reason for this is not hard to determine: like so many oppositions of this kind, to the negative or straw term has been attributed everything which is error, illusion, and the like. The "realists" in other words are supposed to believe in representationality and the like, it being understood that such a belief is itself a superstition; thus, it can be attributed to them only if, like the primitives of participation mystique, one does not really believe in their existence, and as long as they are held to be, simply, the Other. When they begin to affirm themselves as our equals, then categories of otherness are no longer adequate. It is therefore essential to remove the ethical content from this opposition, and insofar as the human mind seems particularly inclined - in spite of itself - to invest binary oppositions with a moral evaluation, this can often best be done, and the binary opposition historicized, by adding a third term, and restoring the apparently exclusive alternative of realism vs. modernism to a whole series of historical terms and forms. Everything changes, indeed, the moment we envisage a "before" to realism itself: indeed, we have already suggested that "Sarrasine" cannot be fully evaluated formally without some feeling for its value as a kind of pastiche or revival of the older Florentine or Renaissance novella-form (a practice of the "art-novella" which will then be extensively developed through the nineteenth century up to Chekhov's decisive break with it). If to this we add a perspective in 15 "Vraisemblance et motivation, " p. 13.</page><page sequence="32">The Ideology of The Text 235 which the storytelling forms of the feudal age come into view, not to speak of those of primitive or tribal societies, then it becomes difficult to think of nineteenth century realism as anything but a uniquely historical product, one unthinkable at any other moment in human history; but by the same token, this particular expression of a historical bourgeoisie forfeits its apparent claim to some permanent fulfillment of the categories of bourgeois thinking. I would want, however, to distinguish this view from the traditional antiquarian type of literary history: for a Marxist historicism, indeed, the presupposition is that none of these forms of the past are of antiquarian interest alone, and that their actuality for us may be demonstrated - indeed, can only be demonstrated - by an analysis which juxtaposes the limits and the potentialities of our own socioeconomic moment with those realized or imposed by the systems of the past. Each moment of the past (or of other cultures) has a very special sentence or judgment to pass on the uniquely reified world in which we ourselves live: and the privilege of artistic experience is to furnish something like an immediate channel through which we may experience such implicit judgments, and attain a fleeting glimpse of other modes of life. What would such a new historical perspective now do to the ideological judgments the theorists of the text felt able to pass on the older type of "realistic" narrative? For one thing, it allows us to observe such judgments a little more clearly at work in the light of day, and to distinguish between genuine analysis and a kind of kneejerk application of ready-made categories. One of the most frequent of the latter is indeed the notion of the open work, to which corresponds a similarly moralizing valorization of critical pluralism ["Let us first posit the image of a triumphant plural, unimpoverished by any constraint of representation (of imitation). In this ideal text, the networks are many and interact, without any one of them being able to surpass the rest; this text is a galaxy of signifiers, not a structure of signifieds; it has no beginning; it is reversible; we gain access to it by several entrances, none of which can be authoritatively declared to be the main one", etc., Barthes, p. 5]. Such pluralism is at best a refusal to go about the principal critical business of our time, which is to forge a kind of methodological synthesis from the multiplicity of critical codes; at worst, it is just one more veiled assault on the non-pluralistic (read, totalitarian) critical systems, e.g., Marxism. As far as the work itself is concerned, it should be observed that Umberto Eco's classic study of the subject16 explored open form as a 16 L'Oeuvre ouverte (Paris, 1965).</page><page sequence="33">236 FREDRIC JAMESON tendency towards indeterminacy in the arts as a whole in modern times, without attaching any particular ethical or ideological superiority to its appearance. We need now to reassess such a trend in terms of the social situation of which it is the symptom: an atomized society, whose fragmented sub-groups and the resultant multiplicity of "codes" inflect its art gradually in the direction of just such multipurpose objects, which may be translated into a whole series of different private languages in succession. Seen in this way, there no longer seems to be any particular motive for ideological praise or blame: rather, this particular formal tendency of modern art amounts to something like its biological adaptation to that new and particularly unfavorable environment which is contemporary society (this is not, however, to say that the concept of the "open form" could not become an ideological motif in its own right: indeed, it is one of the purposes of the present essay to suggest the context in which it has become just that). The principal ideological judgments passed by the "ideology of the text" on its counterpart the "ideology of realism" are, however, elsewhere, and prove once again to reflect two separate themes and preoccupations of Barthes' own work, older and newer motifs which coexist in S/Z. The first of these, which finds its fullest expression in the Brechtean estrangement-effects of Mythologies, is what in a characteristic neologism Barthes will denounce as naturality, associating it with one of the most characteristic strategies of the bourgeois thought process and of the whole bourgeois way of rewriting the world after its own social and political victory. Hjelmslev's connotative method proves an apt instrument to detect the tendency everywhere in bourgeois society, from its ads to its works of art, to transform culture into nature, to naturalize history and social phenomena: "The (ideological) goal of this technique is to naturalize meaning and thus to give credence to the reality of the story: for (in the West) meaning (system), we are told, is antipathetic to nature and reality. This naturalization is possible only because the significant data released - or summoned - in a homeopathic rhythm, are carried, borne along, by a purportedly 'natural' medium, language: paradoxically, language, the integral system of meaning, is employed to systematize the secondary meanings, to naturalize their production and to authenticate the story." (23) We have already seen, above, how the naming system of language functions precisely as just such an illusion that social realities are "natural" ones (proper names being in this respect as "natural" a taxonomic system as the words for the various species). Where Barthes goes much further in his démystification,</page><page sequence="34">The Ideology of The Text 237 furnishing us thereby with an object of study which we have not yet seen in quite this light before, is in his account of the sentence itself as the primary vehicle for just such a profoundly ideological process of naturalization: "there is a force in the sentence (linguistic entity) that domesticates the artifice of the narrative, a meaning that denies the meaning. We might call this diacritical element (since it overhangs the articulation of the narrative units): sentencing. To put it still another way: the sentence is a nature whose function - or scope - is to justify the culture of the narrative. Superimposed on the narrative structure, forming it, guiding it, regulating its rhythm, imposing on it morphemes of a purely grammatical logic, the sentence serves as evidence for the narrative. For language (in this case, French), by the way it is learned (by children), by its historical weight, by the apparent universality of its conventions, in short, by its anteriority, seems to have every right over a contingent anecdote, one which has begun only some twenty pages back - whereas language has lasted forever," (127-128) In many ways, however, this mission to track down and to destroy the traces of naturality in our culture is very much part of the private thematics of Barthes himself ("the will to burden signification with all the justification of nature itself provokes a kind of nausea," he tells us in Mythologies11), and it is the other feature of the ideology of representation - the status of the subject - which has been perhaps more widely explored in recent French theory. The most graphic dramatization of the intimate relationship between representation and the concept of the subject has indeed been made by Michel Foucault, in the opening chapter of The Order of Things, or rather by his object of study in that chapter, Velasquez himself, in his painting Las Meninas. This work, by common agreement one of the summits in the mastery of the techniques of representation, is thus profoundly exemplary of such representational discourse at the very moment when, transcending itself, it begins to offer its own diagnosis: the viewer is indeed astonished to find himself standing in the place of the royal subject - Philip IV and his queen - whose reflections gaze back at us from a mirror on the distant rear wall of the painted room. Las Meninas thus betrays a double and constitutive absence: "that of the painter and the spectator when they are looking at or composing the picture. It may be said that in this picture, as in all the representations of which it may be said to reveal the fundamental essence, the profound invisibility of what one sees is inseparable from the invisibility of the person seeing . . . And indeed, [in 17 Mythologies (Paris, 1957), n. 7, p. 212; and compare his triumphant description of an ideological analysis capable of "despatching codes, one by one, along the strand of the text, their betlies in the air." (100)</page><page sequence="35">238 FREDRIC JAMESON Las Meninas] representation undertakes to represent itself in all its elements, with its images, the eyes to which it is offered, the faces it makes visible, the gestures that call it into being. But there, in the midst of this dispersion which it is simultaneously grouping together and spreading out before us, indicated compellingly from every side, is an essential void: the necessary disappearance of that which is its foundation - of the person it resembles and the person in whose eyes it is only a resemblance. This very subject - the two are the same - has been elided. And representation, freed finally from the relation that was impeding it, can offer itself as representation in its pure form."18 Such an account, by insisting on the self-consciousness of representation in Las Meninas, would seem in the present context on the point of transforming this "realistic" work into a "modernistic" one. Yet the constitutive link demonstrated here between representation and the repression of the subject will then become the principal feature of structuralist, particularly Tel-Quel diagnosis, and the mediation whereby ideologies (bourgeois vs. revolutionary) and artistic discourse (realistic vs. modernistic) are linked to psychopathology (neurotic vs. psychotic, as in Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus). The paradox of this position is that the structuralist critics of representation are led to denounce the active and in-forming presence of the subject precisely in those texts in which it is repressed; on the one hand, they denounce its forgetfulness of itself, and on the other, they call for its suppression. So the following diagnosis of Barthes takes on unexpected overtones in a situation in which, as we shall see, schizophrenia has become a slogan and a whole ethical and political program: "We may say, that, in a sense, 'objective' discourse (as in positivist history) [or the realistic novel] resembles schizophrenic discourse; in both cases there is a radical censorship of the utterance, in which negativity cannot be expressed (though it can be felt), and there is a massive reversion of discourse away from any form of sui-reference, or even (in the case of the historian) a reversion towards the level of pure referent - the utterance for which no one is responsible." 19 18 Michel Foucault, The Order of Things (New York, 1973), p. 16. 19 "Historical Discourse," in Introduction to Structuralism, ed. Michael Lane (New York, 1 970), p. 151. The strongest literary statement of such a diagnosis has been made by Françoise Gaillard, who explicitly assimilates the structure of representationality to that of voyeurisme (See 'La representation comme mise en scène du voyeurisme", in Revue des Sciences Humaines, Vol. 154, No. 2 (1974), pp. 267-282). Her argument is however weakened by the choice of an example, Les Diaboliques of Barbey d'Aurevilly, which, like the "Sarrasine" of Barthes, may scarcely be considered an example of nineteenth century realism at all, but rather a pastiche of older storytelling forms.</page><page sequence="36">The Ideology of The Text 239 And one would be only too inclined to agree that one of the fundamental preconditions of some representational or "realistic" narrative discourse is to be found in the deliberate effacement of the traces of producer and consumer, and that the viewing eye, faced with representational discourse, has a vested interest in ignoring its own presence; yet in the polemic appropriation of this insight by the realism/ modernism debate, a curious reversal takes place in which it is henceforth precisely just such a subversion of the subject which is recommended. Here is Barthes on what is exemplary, in this respect, in Flaubert: "Flaubert, however . . . , working with an irony impregnated with uncertainty, achieves a salutary discomfort in writing: he does not stop the play of codes (or stops it only partially), so that (and this is indubitably the manner oí proof oí his writing) one never knows if he is responsible for what he writes (if there is a subject behindhis language); for the very being of writing (the meaning of the labor that constitutes it ) is to keep the question Who is speaking? from ever being answered." (S/Z, 140) Again, the contradictions which arise from the structuralist attack on the subject seem to me resolvable if they are projected onto a more complicated scheme of periodization and articulated in a more properly historical, rather than an ethical, perspective. The trouble is that the attack on the old bourgeois subject can take two forms: that of the attempt to dissolve the subject altogether, and that is, as we shall see in the case of Deleuze, either an anarchist or a countercultural solution, depending on whether "time's livid final flame" is conceived of in terms of a political apocalypse or a private drug-like fantasmagoria; or the other quite different solution which would consist of renewing the primacy of the group and of collective life over the bourgeois optical illusion of individual existence, and returning to a view of the individual subject as a function of the collective structure, a condition of which, perhaps, the ethnographic descriptions of tribal existence give us the most adequate glimpse. The same adjustment must be made in the earlier motif of naturality: what is ahistorical about Barthes' attack on this particular feature of the bourgeois Weltanschauung is the implication that the concept of nature is at all times and everywhere in and of itself reactionary. But clearly, there have been moments - the preparation of the bourgeois revolution itself and the attack on the "artificiality" of the feudal order - in which the concept of nature has been a profoundly subversive and contestatory weapon; and clearly, the only dialectical way of evaluating such a motif is through analysis of its function in a given historical situation. Nothing</page><page sequence="37">240 FREDRIC JAMESON is, indeed, more idealistic than the notion that a given thought-form (representationality, for instance, or the belief in the subject or in the referent) is always and under all circumstances "bourgeois" and ideological, for such a position - which seems to me that of the Tel Quel group, among others - tends precisely to isolate the form of thought (or its equivalent, the form of discourse) from that practical context in which alone its results can be measured. Ideologies can therefore never be evaluated independently of their function in a given historical situation: witness, for a dramatic example of this assertion, Koyre's demonstration of the progressive character of Galileo's Platonism, as opposed to the apparently far more realistic and even materialistic Aristotelianism of his contemporaries and immediate predecessors.20 A Marxist framework, to be sure, substitutes, for the structuralist opposition between nature and culture, the more dialectical and diachronic one of an opposition between nature and history, yet even here the ideological character of "nature" is by no means unequivocal, as may be observed in the works of the very writer from whom Barthes himself first drew his suspicion of naturality, as well as the literary instruments by which to denounce it, namely Brecht himself. For even in the Brechtian canon, there is a decided alternation between plays which, like Mann ist Mann or The Good Woman of Sezuan, unmask the historical and constructed origins of seemingly natural attributes like aggressivity or acquisitiveness, and the emphasis, in Mother Courage, of the unnatural character of the seemingly only-too-natural drive to make a profit (this un-Brechtian reversal would then go a long ways towards explaining the peculiar and ambiguous status of the latter play in the writer's work). There is indeed a powerful tradition of what I will call the naturistic strategy in Marxism itself, one going back as far as the Economic and Philosophical Manuscripts of 1844, which with their emphasis on a species being, argue, if not for a fixed and immutable human nature in the right-wing sense, then certainly for judgments based on a notion of human potential; of which they demonstrate the contemporary alienation; while a communist literature no less powerful than that of Brecht - I'm thinking of the novels of Paul Nizan, particularly Antoine Bloye - draws its force from just such a rhetoric of the natural and the unnatural. Meanwhile, there are signs, particularly in the work of Herbert Marcuse, that in our own peculiarly anti-natural society, the concept of nature may once again recover some of its negative and critical virulence as an offensive weapon and a Utopian standard. 20 See "Galileo and Plato," in A. Koyre, Metaphysics and Measurement, (Cambridge, 1968).</page><page sequence="38">The Ideology of The Text 241 But if the diagnoses which text-oriented critics have made of the ideology of realism as a discourse are thus open to criticism of a more genuinely historical kind, the same must be said of their apologia for the other term of the antithesis, or for that textuality which is only the current post-modernist form of modernism itself. Mr. Culler's version of the latter's emergence is less apocalyptic than that of Barthes, for whom the essence of the scriptible (or fully modernistic) text is precisely that one can no longer say anything about it at all, but merely produce one's own text in emulation, for whom therefore the critical act, not to speak of the interpretive one, becomes superfluous, and with it, one would think, any possibility of literary history itself. Culler, however, offers a historical paradigm based on the increasing doubt throughout the nineteenth century which is cast on that "basic enabling convention of the novel as genre" which is the "confidence in the transparency and representative power of language." (80) When a writer like Baudelaire or Flaubert becomes "self-conscious", or in other words, "aware of his images as interpretations, of his words not as the furniture of the world but as devices which, at least for the moment of this particular perspective, are being used to communicate ends", then the older literary discourse enters a crisis of which modernism can only be the end result; and Culler's transgressive Flaubert, undermining interpretation even as he solicits it, may be seen as a strategic half-way house on such a path. What troubles me about this particular view of the history and development of modernism - a view which in one form or another is very widely shared - is that, by associating modernism and self- consciousness (albeit of a dialectical and Hegelian type), it tends to suggest that the new development is merely the function of long duration, of some excess of literature, some extreme dead weight of literary texts and disabused sophistication of literary practice, which ultimately result in the reversal of a kind of coming to awareness by literature of itself. It seems to me, for example, symptomatic that Mr. Culler systematically avoids any perspective which would force him into a discussion of the relationship between the new raw material of Flaubert's idees reçues and the beginning saturation of a commodity society with commercial writing and messages of all kinds: to help him avoid such an overt sociological perspective is indeed the other and less admirable function of his allegorical reading of the theme of stupidity (see above). Even more striking is his characterization of something like a nascent sociological perception by Flaubert himself as "Madame Bovary? s greatest flaw. If there is anything that justifies our finding the</page><page sequence="39">242 FREDRIC JAMESON novel limited and tendentious it is the seriousness with which Emma's corruption is attributed to novels and romances. If this is an attempt to diagnose Emma's condition, to characterize her alienation, and to explain her fate, it is a singularly feeble one." (146) Culler thereby cuts himself off from what would seem the most promising area in which to link what the Russian Formalists called the "literary system" with the other, most proximate semi-autonomous "systems" of daily life, such as those - still verbal ones - of what we would today call popular culture or the media.21 Realism and modernism must finally each be seen as specific and determinate historical expressions of the type of socio-economic structures to which they correspond, namely classical capitalism and consumer capitalism respectively. This is not the place to give a full solution to the problem, from a point of view both Marxist and historicist; yet it is certainly the moment to square accounts with the ideology of modernism which has given its title to the present essay. That consumer capitalism should secrete modernism as its by-product is in other words a perfectly comprehensible historical phenomenon of which an analysis can be made in its own right; what demands correction are the claims made by the apologists of modernism in behalf of their product, and these may be said to operate as a peculiar reversal of what above we called the Whorf hypothesis, namely the idea that stylistic or linguistic traits reflect epistemological or ideological ones. For modernism - radical in its rejection of realistic discourse and of the bourgeois world to which the latter corresponds - imagines that if you alter the structure of artistic discourse in a decisive way, the realities to which it corresponds will find themselves thereby similarly modified. Thus, if seeing the world through the old "bourgeois" categories is bad, a change in style will help us to see the world in a new way and thus achieve a kind of cultural or countercultural revolution of its own. And to be sure, if consumer capitalism were a new and qualitatively distinct socioeconomic form in its own right, as many have maintained, something like this would presumably be conceivable, and we would expect the new social form in time to generate its own distinctive kinds of artistic discourse, and to leave the realistic ones behind it like so many dead husks, as antiquated and archaic as the chanson de geste, primitive rituals, or Greek tragedy. But what is peculiar about consumer capitalism is that it is merely a second-degree construction upon classical capitalism itself, the latter continuing in a paradoxical coexistence with it, the fundamental laws of classical capitialism 21 See Prison- House, pp. 93-95.</page><page sequence="40">The Ideology of The Text 243 (codified by Marx) operative from a global perspective while seemingly invalidated and outmoded if one looks at them within the limits of the national experience of a single advanced country. So it is that we continue to walk the older world of everyday life of classical capitalism while our heads move about in the apparently quite different hallucinogenic atmosphere of the media and the supermarket/ suburb; the first of these realities, not unlike the Lacanian signified, is repressed as far as possible under the second, driven under the crossbar of the semiotic fraction, into something which is not altogether an unconscious. This is why our art, that of modernism, is not a new thing in itself, but rather something like a cancelled realism, a realism denied and negated and aufgehoben in genuinely Hegelian fashion; and what we do with the works that show the functioning of all of those realities of capitalism which - wage slavery, money, exploitation, the profit motive - have not changed substantially since the time of the great naturalists is - since they cannot be said to be untrue - to decree that they are boring and old-fashioned. But here boredom is the sign of what is to be repressed, and this automatic and indeed visceral reaction to the older art forms betrays the origin of modernism itself in an aestheticizing reaction against the sordid realities of a business civilization, about which we would prefer not even to have our art remind us. So the death of the referent has been greatly exaggerated; at best, it has only gone underground. Under these circumstances, there are few enough versions of the modernist apologia consequent enough to stand the test. Let us recall Gombrich's lesson, as a way of radicalizing the literary version of this particular dilemma: in the visual arts, a kind of absolute or Zenonic formulation of the problem was reached by asking whether the destruction of perspective by modern painters, and their return to two- dimensionality, could be imagined as affecting in any way the three- dimensional experience of everyday life of their contemporaries. The appeal to lived perspective, like the appeal to the hard sciences, is to be sure an apparently decisive argument, comparable to Dr. Johnson's appeal to the stone; and in literature, the equivalent argument may seem less binding. For the literary equivalent of the phenomenon of perspective - we have implied as much throughout these pages without as yet saying so outright - is surely narrative itself. Gombrich indeed sees an intimate link between the development of naturalistic techniques in painting and the requirements of storytelling; while the modernist attack on realism in literature was at one with its repudiation of plot, and Barthes' fluoroscopy of the text has been useful in implying some</page><page sequence="41">244 FREDRIC JAMESON of the reasons (operation of the proairetic schemata, organization of plot around enigmas and discoveries, naturality of the narrative sentence, dependence of narrative discourse on some type of effacement of the subject) why this should have been so. A fundamental work of the newer philology, indeed, confirms the analogy between narrative and perspective by suggesting that the very structure of language itself shows a deep functional vocation for storytelling, which must then be seen, not as some secondary pastime, to be pursued around the fireside when praxis is over, but rather as a basic and constitutive element of human life. Harold Weinrich's Tempus (Stuttgart, 1964) proposes a comprehensive resolution of the vexed problem of verb tenses through which they are systematically sorted out into narrative and what he calls "discussive" {besprechend) tenses, those of storytelling (where events have become closed off and may be contemplated at a distance, in themselves) and those of an active relationship to the world in which we must ourselves be drawn into the context along with our listeners and our referents. If such a picture of language wins conviction, it can only intensify the peculiarity of a spectacle in which modernist writers seek to amputate language of a good half of its essential organs, to suppress one whole dimension of linguistic and literary experience. Weinrich, like Gombrich, is resolutely anti-Whorfian, and repudiates the idea that a change in language, any more than a change in style, results from - let alone causes - a change in our phenomenological experience of the external world. This skepticism tends to force both of them back into a relativley conservative view of literature, involving the defense of convention (of the schemata, of the structure of narrative tenses) in and for itself, a road down which we will not follow them. We are however fortunate in having at our disposition a counter-exhibit, a rather astonishing document which pushes to its ultimate limits the modernistic or textual position which has been outlined above. This is the glorification of schizophrenia (and of the schizophrenic as the "true hero of desire") to be found in Deleuze and Guattari's Anti-Oedipus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia (Paris, 1972, English translation forthcoming Winter, 1976), where the final step is taken and it is asked of life itself and of lived experience that it conform to the account we have given of the text. For Deleuze and Guattari essentially follow Lacan' s description of schizophrenia as a disease of language in which connections have broken down: continuity in speech, for Lacan, is a function of what he calls the slippage of signifieds ("le glissement des signifies"), or in other words, that relative semantic flux which allows us</page><page sequence="42">The Ideology of The Text 245 to disconnect a meaning from one word or signifier and attach it to its synonym. For Lacan, indeed, the world of the schizophrenic is quite the opposite of meaningless: if anything, it is too meaningful; each instant, like each signifier, is a closed and full meaning in itself, from which it becomes increasingly difficult to lay a bridge to the subsequent moment of time. So the schizophrenic's reality gradually comes to approximate the Flaubertian text as Mr. Culler describes it, a formal or syntactical succession through time which does not correspond to any real progression or perspective at the level of its meanings or signifieds. Here also the ultimate implications of Barthes' critique of the proairetic code are fulfilled: there are no longer any names! and the old conventional words and unities have been swept away in a flux of experience in which everything is by definition always new. And no doubt, there is a sense in which it can only be a relief to find one's self liberated from the all-too- familiar continuities of ordinary representational or "realistic", referential living: the analogous effect of drugs is in no small measure also linked to just this abolition of the logic of time which releases each instant, and the object in it, to glow and radiate a kind of undifferentiated and autonomous energy. We should also mention the historical context in which Deleuze and Guattari's book became, in France, a kind of manifesto: that widespread disillusionment with the Communist Party among students and intellectuals after the failure of May '68, which predictably drove so many of them across the still political positions of gauchisme or anarchism into what in this country we would call a depoliticized counterculture, of which the Anti-Oedipus is one of the basic texts. Still, as the Surrealists discovered in a situation which bore some similarities to this one, it is probably easier to praise madness than to practice it; and one does not become a schizophrenic, no matter how heroic an act that would be, simply by the taking of thought. Deleuze and Guattari's position, indeed, may be seen as the most extreme working out of that Cartesian maxim from which all bourgeois subjectivism may be said to spring: "always to seek to conquer myself rather than fortune, to change my desires rather than the established order, and generally to believe that nothing except our thoughts is wholly under our control . . ."22 The illusion of freedom and creativity enjoyed by the early modernists was a function of their transitional moment in socioeconomic history, a moment in which features of the new consumer economy, the so-called second industrial revolution, had begun to supercede those of older classical or Balzacian capitalism. 22 Descartes, Discourse on Method, Part III (New York, 1960), p. 20.</page><page sequence="43">246 FREDRIC JAMESON Today, however, when modernism no longer represents this conquest of new material, but has rather integrated itself into an economy functionally dependent on it for its indispensable fashion changes and for the perpetual resupplying of a media culture, artists and writers who want to change their styles may well once again come to the conclusion that they must first change the world.</page></plain_text>
