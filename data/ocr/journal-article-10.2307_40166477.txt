<plain_text><page sequence="1">Dante's Bear: A Note on "Cos! nel mio parlar" RONALD L. MARTINEZ second pes to the last stanza of Dante's "Cos! nel mio parlar voglio esser aspro" includes a remarkable comparison between the speaker-lover of the canzone and a bear at play: S'io avessi le belle trecce prese, che fatte son per me scudiscio e ferza, pigliandole anzi terza, con esse passerei vespero e squille e non sarei pietoso ne cortese anzi farei com'orso quando scherza; e se Amor me ne sferza, io mi vendicherei di piu di mille. Ancor ne li occhi, ond'escon le faville che m'infiammano il cor, ch'io porto anciso, guarderei presso e fiso, per vendicar lo fuggir che mi face; e poi le renderei con amor pace. (w. 66-78) Commentators have had little to say about Dante's bold comparison.1 The following remarks are intended to supply this lacuna in commentary and add to the account given of this passage by Robert Durling and myself in our recent study of the rime petrose.2 The involvement of the bear in the complete action of the canzone is complex. The immediate logic of w. 70-71 is that the bear-lover's playing is a negation of courtly behavior and of human pity Yet, the situation of the image close to mid-stanza, and the logical linking of "72-73 (vengeance 213</page><page sequence="2">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 for the lashes received at Love's hands) with the beginning of the stanza (the lady's tresses described as whips) strongly suggest the relevance of the bear-image both to the fantasy of gripping the lady's braids and to the lover's subsequent satisfaction, as suggested in 77-78, of his "vengeance," with its inevitable erotic implications. Inspection of the bear-lore available to Dante in encyclopedias, natural histories, and bestiaries, as well as in the vernacular poetic traditions, confirms this assessment of a broader bearish relevance - indeed, suggests its close relevance to the whole canzone. The bearish lover has a definite if minor place in the French and Provencal vernacular traditions that Dante studied on the way to master- ing his art. In a poem Dante almost certainly did not know, the Provencal romance Flamenca, Archambaut's jealousy of his wife Flamenca makes him behave like several kinds of wild animal, including a bear.3 His obses- sion drives him to melancholic distraction with symptoms resembling those ofamorhereos, the lovesickness of medieval romantic lovers.4 In the patristic tradition and in the bestiaries the bear is most frequent- ly associated with the lustfulness of the male and with violence,5 traits that also characterize the speaker in "Cos! nel mio parlar."6 The speaker's self- comparison to a bear thus follows from the erotic extremity established in the poem (and in the sequence of petrose) and to some extent reflects the distortion wrought in the lover's psyche by the effects of frustrated desire.7 In the case of "Cosi nel mio parlar," however, the import of the bear- reference seems stood on its head: it forms part of the lover's reassertion of control, showing how, despite the change wrought in him by Amor, he can finally assuage his desire and prevail over the threatening petra, if only through a fantasy. This (from the lover's point of view) recuperative or ameliorative aspect of the simile may possibly derive from what is perhaps the most influential instance of a bear-simile for the lover, as found in Rigaut de Berbezilh's bestiary-poem "Atressi con l'orifanz." Rigaut men- tions the bear, along with other beasts, in parallels to or contrasts with the condition of the lover. In Rigaut's poem (itself based on bestiary and ency- clopedia lore) the bear is presented as a model that the speaker cannot emulate, in that repeated maltreatment renders it fat and prosperous.8 Rigaut's poem was well-disseminated in Italy: substantial parts of it were translated, along with its razo, into sometimes approximate Tuscan and appeared in the Libro di novelle e di bel parlar gentile (or 'Novellino'), whose redaction is contemporary with Dante. Rigaut's figure of the bear is also several times referred to in the works of the "Siculo-Tuscan" poet Chiaro 214</page><page sequence="3">Dante's Bear: A Note on "Cost net mio parlar", ronald l. Martinez Davanzati, whose work Dante was in a position to know well.9 Rigaut's account is as follows:10 qu'eu non sui ges de la mainera d'ors, que qui be.l bat ni.l te vil ses merce el engrassa e meillur'e reve. (w. 20-22) [For I am not at all like the bear, / which though beaten and treated badly, with- out mercy, / fattens and improves and revives.] Dante's lover-as-bear, denied merze ("Cos! nel mio parlar," 39), danger- ously attacked by a personified Amor in the middle stanzas of the canzone (35-52), and presented as having known whippings (72), corresponds well to Rigaut's model: in fact the image of the lady's braids as "scudiscio e ferza" (67) may have triggered the image of a scourged bear in Dante's imagination. But Dante's mention of the bear as a figure of the vengeful lover suggests that, like the bear of Rigaut's poem, he has endured his tor- ment. Given the lover's imagined domination in this part of the poem, and the poem's pattern of turning tables on the lady and on Love himself, the lover's sufferings appear to have tempered and strengthened him. In fact, Dante's postulation of a finally thriving lover-as-bear precisely inverts Rigaut's negative use of a figure itself based on paradox (that of prospering through maltreatment). This is exactly the use of the figure by Chiaro:11 Che la mia vita e di natura d'orso; quando om lo batte e tenelo in paura Alora ingrassa e divene piu forte. Rigaut's bear, and Chiaro's, are also models for Dante's bear in that they are offered by the speaker as a self-description (even if negated in Rigaut's case), rather than imposed on the lover's persona by a narrator or a mor- alizing bestiary author. This fact, and the presentation of the bear itself as a victim of previous beating and mistreatment, permit an identification with the lover as suffering subject that is a key ingredient in the presenta- tion of the erotic ascesis of "Cos! nel mio parlar," as we shall see shortly. What then of the activity specifically claimed for Dante's bear, its play? Albertus Magnus recognizes in the De animalibus that bears are easily trained and domesticated, which can make them seem playful: "fiunt 215</page><page sequence="4">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 valde lusivi" (they become very playful). But although susceptible to training, bears can revert to savage ways when overstimulated: "sed facile concitantur et tune saeviunt et occidunt homines..." (for they are easily excited, and then they run wild and kill men).12 Thus, the dangerous and menacing quality of a bear "playing," so strongly suggested in Dante's verses, may be found in the lore of the encyclopedias as well as in the lit- erary tradition more generally.13 In the case of Dante's poem, however, the particular nature of the playing requires further investigation. For the "playing" engaged in by Dante's bear is of a specifically sexual nature. As several readers have seen, both the taking of the lady's braids and the "giv- ing back" of peace to the lady are circumlocutions for the act of love.14 This sexual context to the bear's play is particularly striking in light of the widespread report in the encyclopedias that bears are, with the apes, unique among quadrupeds in performing the sexual embrace not more jet- arum but more hominum. Thus Albertus:15 Hoc animal non ut alia quadrupedia, sed ut homo coit sicut et symia. [This ani- mal, unlike other quadrupeds, copulates in the same way men and monkeys do.] That the lover's action at verse 65 should take the form of seizing the lady's braids with his hands ("metterei mano") is suggestive in view of the bear's observed dexterity with its paws, which it can wield nearly as well as a human his hands. Bears, Albertus tells us, though weak in the head and neck, are strong in the arms and loins, and can use their paws to throw sticks at dogs and explore beehives.16 In light of the lover's handling of the lady's braids, Albertus's report that bears fight horned animals by seizing their horns and wrestling them to the ground (leading him to refer to the bear's paws as hands) is also suggestive for Dante's description of the lover's physical domination of the petra:*7 Pugnans autem ursum animalibus insilit et si cornuta sunt cornua eorum manibus apprehendit et ea prosternit. [Fighting, the bear leaps on animals and if they are horned takes them by the horns with its hands and throws them down.] Thus, the details associated with the bear's "playing" underscore the bear's anthropomorphism. Indeed, in the encyclopedic tradition the anthropomorphism of the bear is most in evidence when copulating or when fighting: in the case of Dante's "Cos! nel mio parlar," the bearish lover is doing both at once. 216</page><page sequence="5">Dante's Bear: A Note on "Cost nel mioparlar", RONALD L. MARTINEZ Lovemaking as striving or "wrestling" (the Veneris luctamen of the Latin anthology) is of course a topos both ancient and modern, with instances in authors from Lucretius to Ariosto and no doubt beyond.18 The topos has a peculiar relevance for Dante's bear-simile in light of Isidore's report that human wrestling was imitated from the grappling of bears, precisely because they only, among the beasts, stand up, try each other with their hands and come together in clasps and embraces as they wrestle, moving as if they were human beings:19 ... Quidam opinantur artem luctandi ursorum contentione monstratam. Namque inter caeteras feras eos solos, et erigi congressos, et subsidere celeriter, ac reverti, et modo manibus tentare invicem, modo complexu abigere sese more luctantium. [Some think that the art of wrestling was demonstrated by the fighting of bears. For among the other beasts they alone are seen to come together when erect, and quickly crouch down, and return, and now test each other with their hands, now clasp and drive each other off, all in the manner of wrestlers.] In Ovid's Metamorphoses, the bear's resemblance to human beings is the basis of the powerful episode of Callisto transformed into a she-bear, an episode Dante knew (Purg. xxv, 131; Par. xxxii, 32) and one that illuminates the "psychological" dimension of bearish behavior in "Cosi nel mio parlar." By way of comparison with the speaker's fantasized attack on the petra in Dante's canzone, as well as Love's prior attack on the speaker-lover, Ovid's description of the nymph Callisto thrown and transformed into a bear by the wrath of Juno emphasizes the humanlikeness of her gestures and limbs even as they are changed to ursine form:20 Dixit, et adversam prensis a fronte capillis stravit humi pronam; tendebat bracchia supplex; bracchia coeperunt nigris horrescere villis, curvarique manus et aduncos crescere in ungues officioque pedum fungi ... mens antiqua manet - facta quoque mansit in ursa - , adsiduoque suos gemitu testata dolores qualescumque manus ad caelum et sidera tollit.... [So she (Juno) spoke, and taking her rival by the hair threw her flat on the ground; she (Callisto) stretched out her arms begging for mercy; her arms began to darken and bristle with hairs, her hands to curve and grow into hooked nails and do the work of feet.... Her mind remained as before - even when she became a bear - and witnessing her pains with insistent cries she raised her hands, what- ever hands they were, to the heaven and stars...] 217</page><page sequence="6">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 Unlike the "objective" accounts of the encyclopedias, in Ovid the experi- ence of being changed to a beast is rendered almost as if from within, while presented as a violent imposition from without. Callisto-as-bear is a figure of pathos, the victim of Juno's all-too-human jealousy. And much of the pathos of Ovid's account derives directly from the fact that bears, because of their capacity for erect posture, uncannily recall the humanity still lurking beneath the heavy pelt of the animal: the observation "mens antiqua manet" is more mimetically plausible here than in the transfor- mations of Daphne or Philomela. The prostration of Callisto is thus the more poignant in that it occurs even as she turns to supplicate the gods with distinctively human gestures. The distinctive traits of her humanity are sharpened even as she loses them. From a perspective like that of Dante, nourished on scholasticism, the anthropomorphic attributes of the bear would appear technically correct: the purposeful use of the "hands," the limb that Albert frequently describes as especially coapt to the work of the intellect, makes them the most specifical- ly "human" of the members.21 The bear's habit of copulation more hominum obliterates another customary distinction of man from beast, while - most powerful of all - the bear's ability to occasionally assume the erect posture, reserved in the Platonic and pseudo-Hermetic traditions for the human being as anthropos (meaning "erect," literally "upward-turning"), makes of the bear a logically complete simulacrum of a human being.22 Although the intermittent upright posture of the bears is part of encyclopedia tradition, Albertus's mention of it suggests his reluctance to accept it, as if the anthro- pomorphisms exhibited by the bear were troubling to him:23 extrema similia habens homini et aliquando erigitur sicut homo, sed non diu. [its extremities are similar to those of men, and sometimes it stands erect as man does, but not often.] Thus, for the late Middle Ages, naked human beings - and we can assume that the speaker-lover in the imagined lovemaking scene of "Cos! nel mio parlar" is unclothed - were not so much naked apes as they were naked bears. Vincent of Beauvais notes as much in a striking passage of his Speculum naturale (col. 1445):24 ursus excoriatus expresse videtur hominem nudum repraesentare. [in the flayed bear is expressly seen the naked man.] Three centuries before Montaigne, Dante presents naked man, captured 218</page><page sequence="7">Dante's Bear: A Note on "Cost nel mio parlar", RONALD L. MARTINEZ at a moment of exasperated sexual crisis, as a flogged bear.25 As in the case of Ovid's Callisto, Dante's use of Rigaut's figure of the beaten bear as an image for the lover seems designed to evoke not so much the bear's propensity for lust and violence but rather a vein of empathy for the suffering subject, for the bear as a victim of harsh treat- ment. Like the lover's suffering that prepares his vendetta, the bear's vio- lence derives from its abuse at the hand of those who restrain it. Thus, as so frequently of the lover's situation in "Cosi nel mio parlar," the lover- as-bear, when seen against the background of the full tradition, is ambigu- ous: a figure of both fear and compassion, repulsion and sympathy, of dis- semblance from and resemblance to the upright human being. The lover- as-bear occupies a status where what is bestial in man and what is anthro- pomorphic in beasts meet at a problematic threshold. By casting the poem's speaker, as he takes his erotic revenge, as a beast that is yet con- vincingly anthropomorphic in posture and movement, Dante not only suggests a situation of mingled eros and danger, a hallucinated blend of brutishness and delicacy, but also returns, in concluding his canzone, to a principal theme of the petrose: the attempt to both represent and somehow reclaim the insistent, even violent sexuality that is part of the human ani- mal in a manner that is neither unreflectively condemnatory nor compla- cently apologetic. In our study Robert Durling and I have argued that this dilemma was central to Dante's conceptions of the petrose. It seems likely, then, that Dante, in selecting the image of the bear for the exasperated but deliberate lover of the last stanza of "Cosi nel mio par- lar," was carefully applying the bear-lore available to him,26 as well as rely- ing on his own observation, for captive bears were common at celebra- tions, carnivals, and festivals.27 Bear-lore is surely relevant to the emphasis on the speaker's lust and violence, but also to his status as a battered figure struggling with powerful impulses, one that paradoxically grows stronger for the experience of suffering; it is relevant to the presentation of the sex- ual embrace as a struggle; it is relevant to the speaker's ability to blend dex- terity and force; it is relevant, finally, to the ambiguous status of the speak- er-lover, both angelic and bestial, poised between forgiveness and vengeance, somehow finally managing both. Dante's playful bear offers an indispensable facet of Dante's conception of the full range of the human.28 University of Minnesota Minneapolis, Minnesota 219</page><page sequence="8">Dante Studies, CXI, 1993 NOTES 1. Gianfranco Contini (Dante Alighieri, Rime [Torino: Einaudi 1970], 170) and Kenelm Foster and Patrick Boyde (Dante's Lyric Poetry [Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1967], n:280) refer to Sacchetti's novella CL and the proverbial "Non ischerzare con Torso, se non vuogli esser morse" Although linguistically promising, the thought is not very close, unless we take the indi- rect reference to the lover's kiss (79) as his "bite." Foster and Boyde postulate a common, unknown, source-proverb; but see the "Aesopic" fable Simia et ursus from the Codex Bernensis 679, where a monkey, playing next to a chained bear, is caught and eaten by it (cf. Aesopica, ed. Ben Edwin Perry [Urbana: University of Illinois Press], 1:705). Sacchetti's rhyming jingle does alert us to Dante's close weaving of orso into the verbal texture of the canzone, e.g., the prepara- tion for orso in "piefcwo ne cortese" and the subsequent echoing of the consonant cluster (orso) in -erea (and sferara); Amor, Ancor, cor mdporto continue to echo the tonic syllable of orso down into the syrma. 2.

The pairing of bear and leopard is formulaic; see the Chanson de Roland, 30. Elsewhere Archambaut is compared to a dog (1068, 1331). 4. See especially 1326-1343. As zgilos, a jealous husband, Archambaut's display of the symp- toms of amor hereos is perhaps intended ironically.

Liselotte Stauch (s.v. Bar, in the Reallexikon zur deutsche Kunstgeschichte, ed. Otto Schmitt; Stuttgart, 1937, I, col. 1442-1449) furnishes citations of the relevant patristic texts: for the bear as lust, cf. Bonaventura, Sermones de tempore: "In urso caro significatur. Sequitur enim mel sicut caro voluptatem" [The flesh is signified by the bear. Therefore it follows honey, as the flesh follows pleasure]. In Allegpriae in sacram scripturam (PL cxii:1086) Rabanus Maurus refers to the bear's immunditia and luxuria. For the bear and violence, cf. Rabanus Maurus De universo, ch. 1 (PL cxi:223): "Ursus ... autem duces saevos et crudeles ... significat" [The bear ... signifies cruel and wicked leaders]. Rabanus claims that Elisha's bears, referred to here, represent Titus and Vespasian. Hildegard von Bingen, in Physica vii.4 (PL cxcvii:1316), gives an explanation, in terms of her humoral biol- ogy, of why bears are alternately violent and lustful: "Ursus calorem fere habet ut homo, ita quod interdum frigidus. Etiam cum calidus est, altam vocem habet et blandus est. Sed cum frigidus est, suppressam vocem tenet, et iracundus est, quia in libidine blandos mores habet nee faciliter irascitur; qui autem a libidine continentes existunt, iracundi sunt." [The bear has heat almost like man, although in such a way that it is intermit- tently cold. When it is hot, it has a high voice and is mild; but when it is cold, it has a low voice, and is wrathful: for when in its lustfulness it is mild of manner, nor is it easily enraged; but those who are continent and avoid lustfulness are wrathful.] 6.

Brunetto Latini (Li livres dou tresor, ed. Francis J. Carmody [Berkeley and Los Angeles: University of California Press, 1948], p. 170; I, ch. 198) also says of the bear that Mele amende et engrasse par bateures" [it improves and fattens through beatings]. Tobler-Lommatzsch (Alfred Tobler and Ernst Lommatzsch, Altfranzosisches Wortebuch, Berlin 1925-Weisbaden 1976) record, under the entry ors, numerous instances in Old French (e.g., idiomatic beter Vors, "bait the bear") that reflect the regular baiting and beating of captive bears. 9. On the diffusion of Rigaut's uida, razo and canso in Italy, see the edition of the Novellino in La prosa delDuecento, ed. Cesare Segre and Mario Marti (Milano-Napoli: Ricciardi, 1959), 796, 850-854, with bibliography. For Chiaro's borrowings from Rigaut, see A. de Lollis, "Sul Canzoniere di Chiaro Davanzati," Giomale storico delta letteratura italiana, suppl. 1 (1898) 82-117, esp. 90-91; for Dante's con- tacts with Chiaro's circle, see Contini's edition of Dante's Rime (3, 219-220). 10. I cite here the edition of Alberto Varvaro, as given in Martin de Riquer, Los Trovadores (Barcelona: Planeta, 1975), 11:290. 11. Text in Gianfranco Contini, ed., Poeti del Duecento (Milano-Napoli: Ricciardi, 1960), 1:423. Chiaro's sonnet has a number of other elements that might connect it with the petrose and with "Cosi nel mio parlar" in particular: the aspra rhyme -erra of the octave (guerra, terra, serra, end) sug- gests the guerra/serra rhyme (61-62) in "Io son venuto" (and note also terra, not in rhyme, twice [54-59] in the same stanza, and twice also in "Cos!" itself [35, 43]). Chiaro's phrase "guerrian- do aquistar terra" (3) seems echoed by Dante's "... belPonor s'acquista in far vendetta" (83); Chiaro's "... de l'anor mi rendera ragione" (6) by Dante's "e poi le renderei con amor pace" (78); Chiaro's "cosi aggio in guerriar socorso" (12) by Dante's "... Io vi soccorro" (61). As regards sub- ject, both poems propose a course of reprisal as a way to avenge past wrongs. For Chiaro, a noted cultivator of Provencal genres and topics, to be in the background of the Arnaut-influenced pe- trose would not be implausible. 12.

Stadler (Minister, 1916-1921; Beitrage zur Geschichte der Philosophic des Mittelalters, vols. xv-xvi), lib. xxii. tract. 2, cap. 1. para. 107 (p. 1427). 13.

[yet, when desiring mutual embraces, they are joined as in human couplings]; and Brunetto Latini 169 (i, ch. 198): "gisent ensemble come li home font avuec les fames" [They lie together as men do with women]. The "scientific" observation regarding the copulation of bears is presumably one rea- son why bears are appropriate as symbols of lustfulness in the moralizing bestiary tradition (see Clark and McMunn, 113). The association of the "lustful" bear with the ape also depends on the resemblance of these animals to humans (see Janson, 262-266, Clark and McMunn, 115). 16. Albertus, 1426. Tobler-Lommatszch records several passages mentioning the bear's agile maynz. 17. Albertus, 1427.

The other encyclopedic writers also concede to bears the intermittent abil- ity to walk upright, e.g. Isidore (PL lxxxii:437): "vis maxima in brachiis, et in lumbis; unde inter- dum erecti insistunt" [their greatest strength is in their arms and loins, because of which they intermittently stand erect]; Brunetto Latini, 169, quoting the same reason, notes: "vait il souvent tout droit en estant" [frequently it walks while fully standing] . For the reasons behind Albertus's strict qualification of anthropomorphic features in animals, see Janson, 84-90. 24. In the tradition of medical and anatomical writings, it is the bear (along with the ape) that offers the best simulacrum of the outward physical configuration of human beings; see Anthony Hewson, Giles of Rome and the Medieval Theory of Conception (London: Athlone Press, 1975), 97. 25. For the covert metaphor of flaying in "Cosi nel mio parlar, " see Time and the Crystal, 406 n. 64. 26. Other "subconscious" effects of bear-lore in the canzone might include reference to the blood fleeing to the speaker's heart in 46-47 (Albertus notes of the bear that "sanguinem autem habet ... paucissimum nisi circa cor" [it has very little blood, except around the heart]). And does the fact that bears are renowned for their thick, hairy pelts ("spissae et villosae pellis," says Albertus) connect with the poem's dependence on words that are "hairy" or hyrsuta? 27. The resemblance of bears to human beings is of course behind Boccaccio's account of persons disguised as bears or wild men in the tale of Frate Alberto exposed by his faithless host in Decameron w (2:49; ed. Vittore Branca; Milano: Mondadori, 1976): "chi mena uno uomo vesti- to a modo d'orso e chi a guisa d'uom selvatico." Frate Alberto's changes of garb during the novel- la comprise a systematic descent in metaphysical status, from a simulated angel in his approach to Madonna Lisetta, to a "real" man in bed, to a feathered "uom selvatico" led on a chain once he is taken (and Boccaccio's tale, like some others in the Decameron [v.8, viii.7] may well include ref- erence to Dante's "Cosi nel mio parlar." 28. As a signature of the poet's interest in the bear that one of his namesakes in the Commedia, the prophet Elisha (for Dante as descendant of the Elisei, see Par. XV, 136) was avenged by bears for the taunting inflicted on him by a group of children: "Eliseo, che si vengio con li orsi."
