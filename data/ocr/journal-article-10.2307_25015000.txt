<plain_text><page sequence="1">BRIEF NOTICES Acton-Dalberg, Lord John Emerich Edward. Essays on Freedom and Power. Selected and with an introduction by Gertrude Himmelfarb. Preface by Herman Finer. (Boston: Beacon Press. 1948. Pp. lxvi, 452. $5.00.) This collection reprints some of the essays which have built up Lord Acton's reputation since his death in 1902. The well-chosen selection of essays is given unity by the theme of freedom and power, the central problem in Acton's thought. In addition, two letters in the Acton-Creighton correspondence are printed from the manuscripts in the Cambridge University Library. It is regret table that in the note introducing this correspondence no reference is made to the fuller discussion of these manuscripts which Friedrich Engel-Janosi made in 1940. [Cf. "The Correspondence between Lord Acton and Bishop Creighton," Cambridge Historical Journal, VI (1940), 307-321.] In the introduction to the essays, Acton's life and intellectual growth is out lined carefully and not uncritically. Acton's "liberalism" earns for him a sympa thetic and even generous analysis. The editor emphasises that it made him an uncomfortable member of the Church, but she adds little, really, to our under standing of the ultimate source of his discomfort. The more delicate problem of the relationship between Acton's religious faith and his political convictions is often blurred by the ambiguous use of the words "piety" (pp. xvi, xvii), "pious" (pp. xxvi, lvi), and "dogmatic" (p. xxxvi). If Acton's "piety" was the source of his agony, then the core of his thought will remain untouched until that "piety" is explained. The actual difficulty may be that, in all instances, Acton's thought was cramped by his overwhelming fear of the State, a fear which both the introduction and the essays reveal. Lord Acton has been most praised for his professed allegiance to the canons of objective historical method. Two of his essays in this collection suggest some of the limitations of his critical method. In the "Inaugural Lecture on the Study of History," fatiguing truisms on the value of the study of history are supported by a string of references to the most negligible historians. On the other hand, in his essay on "The Vatican Council," Acton took so much pleasure in reporting the gossip which so frequently misleads the visitor to Rome that he did not hesitate to give an account of the "private" expressions of the inten tions of Pius IX (Cf. pp. 303-304). Apparently, the reader is expected to accept the veracity of these stories only on the word of Acton. Contemporary historians are much interested in the study of political and social power. If they consult Acton they may catch some of his passion for freedom, and they will most certainly be presented with sufficient illustrations of his severe ethical standards. If they do not gain the expected understanding of the structure and development of power in the western world from this volume, then they should turn to the work of Max Weber and to Bertrand de Jouvenel's Du pouvoir (Geneva, 1947).

This handsome volume with more than 1300 illustrations makes the latter half of the nineteenth century a vivid panorama. No man is here denied the right to be his own historian, for the individual's appreciation of the pictures is the obvious purpose of the editor. He who runs may read. The text is kept to a minimum that serves to identify each plate rather than to provide a con nected account of the period. Had the publishers really desired to serve the ends of scholarship they might have used paper and picture materials to enlarge and adorn their Dictionary of American History, where an equivalent amount of photographic additions could have been distributed to make a unique contribution to American historiography. Perhaps the resulting work would not have been economically feasible. On the other hand, a large sale for this sort of book presents no problem to those who have found that an arresting photograph will induce many to buy the equivalent of yesterday's newspapers. Noteworthy sources used in the preparation of this volume include Harper's Weekly, Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper, and Lossing's Pictorial Field Book of the Civil War, besides photographic collections of local libraries, historical societies, and business houses. (John T. Farrell) Adhemar, Jean. Fr?re Andr? Thevet. [Profils Franciscains.] (Paris: ?ditions Franciscaines. 1947. Pp. 94.) M. Adhemar is the author of the latest biography of Andr? Thevet (1504 1592), the collector of curiosit?s and cosmographer to four kings of France, who spent long years of his life on travels which took him to lands on both sides of the Atlantic. In America, Thevet is remembered chiefly for his Les singularit?z de la France antarctique (Paris, 1557), the first book published on Brazil. He came to Rio with Villegaignon in 1555 to help found a French colony in Guanabara Bay and upon his return to Europe he wrote his book which landlubbers read with unusual interest. Actually, Thevet did not see much during his short stay in Brazil, for he was unwell most of the time, but he kept his alert ears open, and later wrote not only about the things he saw, but also, and more especially, about the things he heard. His book con tains little that will interest the historian, but it is an important source for the study of the Indians of Brazil. M. Adhemar has done an excellent job of piecing together the snippets of information that we have on the Franciscan. Thevet, for all the books he wrote and all the lands he saw, does not fill a big niche in history or in litera ture, but he is worth remembering. He had the unusual fortune of coming to the new world in the springtime of its years, and he represents in a dramatic way what happened to the spirit of the Middle Ages in its first contacts with the Renaissance. In giving us the biography of the ubiquitous friar Adhemar has made it easy for students of the age of exploration to become familiar with one of its "v?n?rables et scientiques personnes." Dr. Pedro Calmon, the Brazilian historian, reviewed and corrected the chapter on Les singularitez.

The place of publication of the first edition of Jean de L?ry should be corrected to read La Rochelle (p. 90). (Manoel S. Cardozo) Allan, Herbert S. John Hancock: Patriot in Purple. (New York: Macmillan Co. 1948. Pp. xvi, 422. $6.00.) Mr. Allan has, after more than four years of careful research, rescued from virtual obscurity the hitherto neglected President of the Second Continental Congress. His incisive narrative provides a fresh approach to the American Revolution and its immediate aftermath. In view of the fact that the only two biographies of Hancock published thus far this century are both extremely sketchy, Allan's definitive work is of real significance. Adopted at the age of seven by his wealthy merchant uncle, Hancock was educated to take his place among the patricians of Boston's Beacon Hill. At twenty-seven he inherited the family business, worth the present equivalent of one million dollars; and it was this fortune which he risked in the patriotic cause during the turbulent 1770's. Allan maintains that "Hancock did more than any other person to surround the Revolutionary movement with an aura of respectability." His decision to cast his lot with the revolutionists had an incalculably inspirational effect upon gentry and commonality alike in the colonies. The author also holds (but hardly proves conclusively) that Hancock by his support kept the revolutionary enterprise from collapse, and that Americans must thank his efforts in the Massachusetts ratifying convention for the prac ticality of the federal Constitution of 1789. In his study of the enigmatic Han cock's character, Allan is eminently objective?so much so, in fact, that he seems unable to decide, from chapter to chapter, just what sort of person his protagonist really was. It is difficult, e.g., to see how the merchant prince was "vain, arrogant, egotistical, hypersensitive, petulant, exhibitionistic, capricious, somewhat of a demagogue and much of a faker . . ." and at the same time a man "of essentially strong and admirable character." There is also a dispro portionate amount of matter in the opening chapters on the life and times of Hancock's ancestors, and regrettably little on the organization of the patriotic movement in the colonies in the years preceding Lexington and Concord. Altogether, however, the work is a valuable one, and the style is particularly attractive. Hancock's career has been placed in its broad historical setting, and the reader is given a new insight into the social and commercial life of New England during the latter half of the eighteenth century. Mr. Allan has used a gratifying amount of original source matter, including many unpublished manu scripts, journals, letters, and commentaries of Hancock's contemporaries. The newspapers and periodicals of the time are well represented. Both annotation and index are adequate. It is unfortunate that the footnote entries were not dis tributed through the text rather than placed togeher in a single appendix. (Robert E. Carson)</page><page sequence="4">BRIEF NOTICES 75 ?ngelus Gabriel, Brother. The Christian Brothers in the United States, 1848-1948: A Century of Catholic Education. (New York: Dec?an X. Mc Mullen Co., Inc. 1948. Pp. xviii, 700. $8.50.) The centenary of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in the United States has been the occasion for a number of events to mark their accomplishment. The publication of the present volume is one recognition of the century of school work. In his note of acknowledgments the author gives full credit to the late Brother Albeus Jerome who worked for more than twenty-five years collecting material for a history of the brothers' educational activities in this country and who left a manuscript, "Annals of the Brothers of the Christian Schools in the United States." The facts for the present work are taken, for the most part, from this manuscript but the arrangement was made by the new writer. The chapters cover the origins in Europe and the United States, the work in elemen tary schools, secondary schools, higher education, and boy welfare. There is also an account of the novitiates and houses of study of the institute. There are several pages of photographs of brothers and schools, and there is an index containing mainly proper names. The history of education is a difficult field to define, but it surely should be more generously viewed than it is in this record. It is a full, perhaps too full, record of the individual brothers, their dates, locations, and the schools where they were stationed. As such it is of interest to members of the institute and others who have some personal connection with the brothers. But even they, and certainly the student of educational history, would like to be informed on the internal life of the schools, their programs of study, their methods, their dis cipline, their objectives, and their accomplishments. The author disappoints the reader who looks for such information, for he finds no well-developed ex position of these subjects. Admittedly such data are difficult to locate but some of them are available and if they had been included would have added greatly to the value of this volume. (Bernard J. Kohlbrenner) Bergin, Thomas G. and Max A. Fisch (Translators). The New Science of Giambattista Vico. Translated from the third edition (1744) (Ithaca: Cornell University Press. 1948. Pp. xv, 398. $5.00.) Messrs. Bergin and Fisch, continuing their labor of love, have added a trans lation of Vico's Scienza nuova to their translation of his Autobiography pub lished in 1944. The importance of the undertaking is beyond doubt. The work of Vico is recognized today as the magnificent beginning of a modern philos ophy of history and politics; and historians and political scientists, as well as the educated public generally, will be grateful to have this classic accessible. The translation is based on the edition of the Scienza nuova by Nicolini in the Scrittori d'Italia. This had the advantage that the translators could avail them selves of Nicolini's excellent editorial work in modernizing and simplifying Vico's punctuation and in breaking down the text into manageable, numbered paragraphs. And the scholar will be especially grateful for this procedure because, as a consequence, the text of the translation can be easily checked against the edition of Nicolini which is now in general use. The translators</page><page sequence="5">76 BRIEF NOTICES have done a first-rate piece of work. The English text is lucid and readable. Moreover, a checking of numerous passages against the original reveals that the translation is impeccable in rendering Vico's meaning as well as the inflec tions of his sentence structure ; especially the translators should be congratulated on their careful rendering of the important Elementi and Principi. Occasionally an insuperable difficulty occurs, such as the rendering of volgare by vulgar; since any other rendering would ruin the meaning even more, on such occasions an explanatory footnote would have helped. One may also may take exception to an occasional rendering of autore as founder; the translation is correct, but the word pattern of Vico is affected. Setting aside such minor points, the trans lation (wherever I checked it) is a model achievement. The present translation renders the third edition of the Sciensa nuova. As a consequence of Vico's medi tative mode of writing, the Terza scienza nuova is, in fact, not a third edition of the Prima at all, but a new work. It does not supersede the Prima; and the ideas contained in the Prima, but omitted in the Tersa, are essential to a com plete understanding of Vico's philosophy of history. We should like to hope that the translators will continue their work and complete it through a translation of the first Sciensa nuova. (Eric Voegelin) Berman, Eleanor D. Thomas Jefferson among the Arts. (New York: Philosophical Library. 1948. Pp. xviii, 305. $3.75.) Miss Berman's work is an obvious labor of love and a glowing eulogy of one's beloved. With great detail the story of Jefferson and the several arts is laboriously told at the price of some monotonous repetition. Jefferson is shown as a firm believer in the utilitarian and social function of the arts. "Always the tool is viewed in relation to its purpose: art must not only further freedom and happiness but also inculcate virtue" (p. 10). The sources from which he drew his inspiration as well as the peculiarly personal and individual direction which he gave to his own artistic thoughts are equally recognized. "Jefferson . . . was an eclectic who drew whatever suited his needs from a variety of sources, recombining them, however, into something subtly distinctive and individual?a whole in a great sense quite different if not greater than the sum of its parts" (p. 35). After discussing the sources of Jefferson's philosophy of art and the influence of Hogarth in particular, Miss Berman shows Jefferson among the arts of painting, sculpture, architecture, gardening, music, speaking, and writing. In painting and sculpture Jefferson was a man of appreciation, though not always in agreement with the best authority; in architecture and gardening, "a work man, an innovator and an expert instead of an interested bystander" (p. 261) ; in music, a performer and something of an authority on instruments and tech niques though not outspoken on composers and compositions; in the art of words, "a 'wordman' par excellence" (p. 263). A devoted eulogy may well be expected to end with an encomium like the following: "There have been many Americans whose interest in the arts and sciences matched Jefferson's; there have been those whose political eminence</page><page sequence="6">BRIEF NOTICES 77 matched his. But I know of no other President of the United States who has been the recognized initiator and center of so many cultural and educational activities" (p. 266). (Edward A. Doehler) Berry, Virginia Gingerick (Ed. and trans.) O do of Deuil. De profectione Ludovici VII in orientem. [Columbia Records of Civilization, XLII.] (New York: Columbia University Press. 1948. Pp. xliv, 154. $3.25.) A new edition with explanatory notes and English translation of the only work devoted to the second crusade is a genuine contribution to the history of the Middle Ages, and especially to that of the crusading era. As chaplain of King Louis VII, the monk, Odo of Saint Denis, had first-hand information on the origin, inception, and progress of this mass pilgrimage of Frenchmen to the Holy Sepulcher. Unfortunately, his account ends with the arrival of the French army at Antioch, but in recounting the crusaders' experiences with the Greeks and encounters with the Turks he indicates clearly the tragic circumstances which made the expedition of Louis VII an effort of supreme cost and little gain. Odo composed the De profectione as a % source of information for his abbot, Suger, who he hoped would write a biography of Louis VII, and as a guide for future crusaders that they might avoid the disasters which he and his companions had suffered. The present text was edited from the single extant manuscript which was written at Clairvaux and is now in the College of Medicine at Montpellier. The original edition made by Chifflet in 1660, as well as the selections edited by Waitz in the Monumenta Germaniae Hist?rica, were collated with the new edition. On the whole the text appears quite satisfactory. An unfortunate typo graphical error mars ?vt lines on page 72. The same cause can probably be assigned for the use of labore instead of labor on page 94, but is the editor or the author responsible for sciebantur instead of sciebant on page 122? The translation, although generally reliable and very readable, suffers from a few inaccurate renditions. On page 10 the Latin text does not seem to justify the interpretation "enrolled"; on page 40 castro seems to signify a town rather than a castle; on page 44 confessione obviously means faith rather than confes sion; on page 74 there is an incorrect rendering of the tot . . . quot clause. The translator's attempt to put Latin puns into English is a clever but not always accurate device. In some instances the results are far from pleasing. In a few cases the statements made in the notes and introduction are mislead ing. The Greek "heresy," explained as the reception of the holy Eucharist under the species of bread and wine, is undoubtedly a reference to the custom prevalent in the eastern Church of using leavened rather than unleavened bread. The statement that Odo composed his work to incite French revenge on the Greeks is a denial of his avowed purpose of furnishing Suger with material for a biography of Louis VII, a fact which is supported by his continuous praise of the king. To say that God appears as an active protagonist on the side of the crusaders is to give an anthropomorphic interpretation to the mediaeval confi dence in an all-sustaining Providence.</page><page sequence="7">78 BRIEF NOTICES Aside from these blemishes, the work furnishes a valuable contribution to mediaeval studies and provides readers with some valuable source material in an important period of European history. (Sister Patrick Jerome Mullins) Bishop, Morris. Champlain: The Life of Fortitude. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. 1948. Pp. 364. $4.00.) This is biography at its very best?and as it should be. Morris Bishop has written professionally of Samuel de Champlain with a pen that has here tofore scored successes in the field of writing. Champlain is the father of Canada and as such Canada was his child, the only true love of this genuinely good man, an idealist at heart with the faults of an idealist. It is precisely this settled purpose in Champlain's life that pushed Mr. Bishop to know more about the father of Canada, what he concealed, if anything, as well as what he told. There is absolutely nothing that Champlain (or his biographers for that matter) could hide from Bishop, for he must have traversed much of the territory Champlain did and in the last resort, when the abundant documentary evidence at the writer's disposal was somewhat discrepant, he used common sense. This is very much in evidence in the numerous parenthetical annota tions which have their raison d'?tre in such a work of scholarship. Champlain's was, indeed, a life of fortitude, which gave a sustained breath to a policy of action and activity which he was to pursue during his entire life : "Alliance with the trading Indians, and military aid if necessary ; explora tion, in the hope of finding a Western sea and passage to the Orient; coloniza tion, with the establishment of permanent posts in the far interior ; and religious instruction, leading to Christianization" (p. 179). The father of Canada did not assume the role of "leading man" in this book? or, as a matter of fact, in his own life?until after the erection of the inhabitation at Quebec City in 1608. Prior to this date Champlain was a cartographer and a geographer, leaving the headlines to such men as Pontgrav?, Lescarbot, and Poutrincourt. Nonetheless, the dominant note in Champlain's entire life, which was the "desire to know, the westward urge of the explorer" (p. 120), became manifest destiny. Canada lived because Champlain lived. Champlain died as he lived. His life was the strength to endure for a purpose, which is a noble thing to contemplate. The reviewer cannot resist the urge to inform Mr. Bishop that it is his wish that his pen will continue to score successes in such a field of writing, because this book is, as we said at the outset, biography at its best. (Gilbert F. Leduc) Brearley, Mary, Hugo Gurgeny, Prisoner of the Lisbon Inquisition. (New Haven: Yale University Press. 1948. Pp. 176. $3.50.) This little volume is an excellent study of Inquisition procedure and inde pendence of action as exemplified in the detention of Hugo Gurgeny, an adherent of the Church of England, who, having gone to Lisbon in 1605 on business, was in the hands of the Holy Office from August 22, 1606, to May 30, 1609. Four months before his arrest?the result of several denunciations of his slight respect for the religion of the Portuguese?the tribunal had decreed his deporta</page><page sequence="8">BRIEF NOTICES 79 tion, but an influential Jesuit, Father Henry Floyd, prevailed upon the Inquisi tion to arrest him in the hope of effecting his conversion and, it seems, of sending him back to England as a missionary. Gurgeny's straightforward defense arouses the reader's sympathy and one is constantly expecting the judges to become convinced of his innocence. The prisoner steadfastly refused to be forced until sentence of burning was pronounced, whereupon he embraced Catholicism. This study holds the interest to the end. The author successfully aims at strict impartiality and her dislike of Floyd is counter-balanced by her sympathetic portrayal of another Jesuit, Aloysius of San Roque. Though she abhors the Inquisition's cruel system of mental torture, she demonstrates that it was conversion, not punishment, that was sought; Gurgeny himself bore witness to the kindness of one of his judges. The author maintains that the sentence of death was only a successful bluff and casts doubts upon the sincerity of Gurgeny's conversion, despite the testimony of several Jesuits of San Roque, including Floyd. The book lacks an index but it provided with interesting notes in an appendix. On page 76 the date 1607 should be read for 1606. (Anselm Biggs. ) Brown, Louise Fargo and George Barr Carson, Jr. Men and Centuries of European Civilisation. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. 1948. Pp. xxiii, 628, xvi. Trade $6.25; text $475.) A textbook labors under some of the handicaps of an anthology: it is almost impossible to please anyone but the compilers. A critic will usually find some basis for dissent: too much emphasis here; too little attention paid to a phase or a personality ; an arrangement that does not meet approval. In this particular text the objection is more fundamental. The authors have made an ambitious departure from standard procedure, and in the opinion of this reviewer, have not succeeded in their announced intention. The plan is attractive. The authors believe that in an introductory college course in European history a student should acquire a definite body of informa tion, an acquaintance with the great historical sources, and a critical methodology for evaluating future readings. At the same time his interest should be aroused, and his text should provide him with a guide for further exploration. Since the student will be more attracted to the human aspect of history than to abstract forces, the authors propose to build their study of the past fifteen centuries of European history around the lives of the most prominent figures in each epoch. Accordingly they divide their material on the basis of the century, selecting two personalities in each as typical of the period, and then attempt to describe the century in terms of these individuals. They have tried too much. Aside from the doubtful validity of the division by centuries, their description of the political, economic, and social conditions is far too summary for any true understanding. The emphasis on the great men is interesting, but it is an obvious over-simplification to treat the eighteenth as the century of Franklin and Bonaparte, and the nineteenth as that of Darwin and Jaur?s. The authors seem conscious of the problem, for the actual development of the chapters, while high-lighting the characters selected, quickly descends</page><page sequence="9">80 BRIEF NOTICES into a standard narrative, crowded with other material. The readings are well chosen, but too brief to compensate for the skimpy text. Thus the book falls between two stools by attempting to combine, in a one-volume survey of fifteen centuries, the advantages of a reliable text and an adequate source-book. The failure does not stem from any incompetence of the authors. They reveal themselves as objective, fair in their approach, and clear in their pres entation. If the above criticisms are valid, the difficulty is inherent in the method they have adopted. (Joseph N. Moody) Brown, Ralph H. Historical Geography of the United States. (New York: Harcourt, Brace and Co. 1948. Pp. viii, 569. $7.50 ; text edition $5.50.) This book, the culmination of twenty-five years of scholarly endeavor by one of the most competent men in the field, is an excellent exemplification of the author's conception of historical geography as simply "the geography of the past." Due to the limitations of a single volume, Dr. Brown confines himself to the formative period of early occupancy for each major region of the United States and eastern Canada. The natural setting of each region is portrayed "_not as we know it today but as it was known or understood during the period under consideration," for Mr. Brown places great importance on "weighing the effectiveness," of beliefs as distinct from actual knowledge in the occupancy and settlement of regions?a far cry from the environmental determinism that has sometimes passed for historical geography. From contemporary records, maps, and eyewitness accounts he skillfully reconstructs a factual record of past landscapes. His vivid descriptions are illustrated by forty-two pictures and 105 maps, the former mostly reproductions of contemporary originals, but some are the author's simplifications of early maps. Some of the originals are paired with modern maps of the same area on the same scale. Part I deals with the period of colonization including Spanish efforts in the Southwest. The development of the eastern seaboard up to 1810 is discussed in Part II. Part III covers the Ohio Valley and the lower Great Lakes region to 1830. In the three remaining parts the upper Great Lakes, the Great Plains, the Rockies, and the Far West are each carried through to 1870. A bibliography of generally available materials is supplemented with extensive documentary notes and comments on the nature of other source materials. (Kenneth Bertrand) Bruwaene, Martin van den. La Soci?t? et les institutions de l'antiquit? classique. Tome I : Le Miracle grec. L'Orient pr?classique et la Gr?ce jusqu'? l'?poque de Demosth?ne. (Bruxelles: L'?dition Universelle, S.A. 1946. Pp. 394.) The author tells us in his preface that the present work is based on a course which he has given for some years at the Institut Saint-Louis in Brussels. It is intended to introduce students at the college level to Greek institutions and life, and it should be evaluated, therefore, with its primary purpose in mind. Chapters I and II give a survey of Egyptian and Mesopotamian civilization as a necessary background for an understanding of Aegean civilization and of</page><page sequence="10">BRIEF NOTICES 81 Greek civilization proper. The bulk of the volume, Chapters II-XIX, is de voted to a systematic exposition of the political, social, economic, and re ligious institutions and life of the Greek world to the establishment of the Macedonian hegemony. The book is furnished with 100 excellent illustrations, many being full-page plates. The accompanying descriptions greatly increase the value of such illustrations for students. There is a very useful table of technical Greek terms and a good index. The author does not claim to be a specialist in the history of the Near East, but he should be commended for stressing the importance of the Oriental background in the development of Greek civilization. This background is an essential factor in "Le miracle grec." His exposition of Greek institutions is, in general, accurate and abreast of the latest scholarship in the field. The style is lively and reflects the enthusiasm of one who is obviously an intense admirer of Greek civilization and its achieve ments. A few criticisms, however, should be made. Page 13: it is wrong to speak of a totemic organization in early Egypt in such unqualified terms. Page 48: the date of 2050 B.C. for Hammurabi should be reduced by 400 years. Page 57 ff. : the chapter entitled "La Civilisation eg?enne" is much too broad in its scope, as it includes early Greek history proper through the Dorian invasion and conquest. Page 277 ff. : the title of Chapter XI, "La Constitution de l'empire grec," is an unfortunate one to say the least. Finally, volumes appearing in the Loeb Classical Library should be so listed, and not as "Edition Heine mann." College teachers and students will find Le miracle grec a useful and stimulating book, and especially valuable because of its copious illustrations. (Martin R. P. McGuire) Calla way, James Etheridge. The Early Settlement of Georgia. (Athens : University of Georgia Press. 1948. Pp. vii, 138. $2,50.) This volume is almost exclusively an account of the English colonizing effort in an area which subsequently became the largest state east of the Mississippi River. Its history opens four months after the birth of George Washington, and the narrative is carried into the time when hungry English mills made Cotton King. The slim volume represents the research of a young Georgian, while he was a student at Princeton University. His untimely death in 1935 occurred thirteen years before the results of his investigations were published. The research betrays a certain inexperience best illustrated by the rather uneven and disconnected narrative of the settlements stretching through the various geo graphical divisions of Georgia. The reader, unless he is thoroughly conversant with Georgian geography, is disappointed with the lack of maps which could have outlined the mush rooming development of the varied agricultural areas of Georgia. The author presents in the 122 pages of text a clear purpose. Besides showing the factors which conditioned the colonization of Georgia, Callaway also points out its development into a definite type of agricultural kingdom. The growth of its population and the settlement of its land area were affected by the original</page><page sequence="11">82 BRIEF NOTICES purpose of its colonization, a military outpost against the Spaniards. A second factor in Georgia's development was the nature of its climate and soil, since this state is a land offering strange contrasts, from the swampy tropical areas in the south, through the barren pine-covered central zone, to the mountainous clay top-soil of the north. These contrasts led to a condition which becomes the central theme of Callaway's monograph, a sharp struggle between small farmer and planter. The extension of slavery to Georgia and the success of cotton in this clay soil determined the manner of its gradual development. The notes (pp. 123-129) introduce bibliographical material carefully paginated, and the bibliography (pp. 130-138) is ample for the limited scope of the study. (Thomas Daniel O'Donnell) Carter, Clarence Edwin (Ed.) The Territorial Papers of the United States; Volume XIII : The Territory of Louisiana-Missouri, 1803-1806. (Wash ington: U. S. Government Printing Office. 1948. Pp. xi, 641. $3.50.) The appearance of Volume XIII of the Territorial Papers, containing relevant documents pertaining to the territory of Louisiana-Missouri, marks the re sumption of a State Department project which was brought to a standstill by World War II. Dr. Carter, of the Division of Historical Policy Research in the Department of State, is the editor of the series. This series of official records of some thirty states of the Union during their territorial periods began in 1934, and will consist of about thirty volumes when completed. Mr. Carter has assigned three volumes in the series to embody the selections of relevant documents pertaining to the territory of Louisiana-Missouri for the years 1803 through 1821. This present volume consists of the following documents: papers relating to the foundations of the territory of Louisiana-Missouri, 1803 1804; papers relating to the District of Louisiana, 1804-1805; and papers relating to the administration of Governor Wilkinson, 1805-1806. Volumes XIV and XV, to be published in the near future, will bring the coverage of docu ments through the year 1821. The importance of this work and its companion volumes, lies in the fact that it presents for the first time a comprehensive documentation of the begin ning of American administration of a region out of which a dozen of our present United States were created. Problems resulting from the transition of the territory from an old world colony to a United States territory are depicted by a wide range of correspondence between departments of the federal govern ment and the various territorial officials, as well as by letters passing between numerous subordinate officers within the territory. The papers selected for in clusion in these three volumes are found, with a few exceptions, in depositories in Washington, D. C. Headnotes supplied at the top of each letter identify the sources from which the documents have been taken. (James W. Dyson) Chaplin, Ralph. Wobbly. The Rough and Tumble Story of an American Radical.

Its rights and wrongs are the rights and wrongs of our American society. Organized labor in the United States has rarely, if ever, borrowed the aims and methods of European labor movements. The one exception was the Indus trial Workers of the World (I.W.W.). Born among the miners of the West, the Wobblies, as they were called, were everything that the Knights of Labor, the A.F. of L., and the C.I.O., were and are not. They were radicals in the European sense; they were anarchists; they left behind them a trail of blood and violence. Their birth may be attributed to two important factors: the horrible condi tions under which the miners, the agricultural, and intinerant workers were employed; and the inability or unwillingness of the A.F. of L. to forego craft unionism in favor of one big union. The I.W.W. attempted to form one big union. It was never successful and died a sudden death in the 1917 trials which sent its leaders, Bill Hay wood and Ralph Chaplin, to jail for openly resisting our participation in World War I. Judge Landis of baseball fame sentenced these men to twenty years in Leavenworth. Wobbly is the story of the beginnings, the growth, and the decline of the I.W.W. It is written by the man who had much to do with its history, and from this point of view it is an important book. It is also the story of the conversion of a radical, for the modern Chaplin is a far cry from the anarchist of thirty years ago. He is now a religious man, convinced only of the need for "a revitalized American ideology, one that would enable the Sermon on the Mount and the Bill of Rights to do more than hold their own in competition with Das Kapital and the Communist Manifesto." The book is rambling, its chronology is uncertain, and at times it is dull, verbose, and repetitious. But for all its defects it tells a good story. (George A. Kelly.) Conkling, Roscoe P., and Margaret B. Conkling, The Butter field Overland Mail, 1857-1869. Two volumes and atlas. (Glendale, California: Arthur Clark Co. 1947. Pp. 412; 446. $25.00.) The Overland Mail, although shortlived (1857-1869), played an important role in the history of the West. The southern route (1857-1861), contracted for and organized by the New Yorker John Butterfield, extended from Memphis and St. Louis to San Francisco by way of Texas and the Southwest. The central route (1861-1869), under contract to Wells Fargo, the Butterfield Company, and others proceeded, until the coming of the railroad, from the Missouri to California by way of the South Pass, the Great Salt Desert, and the Sierras. Prior to 1857, mail reached the Golden Gate via Panama (thirty days) or the Straits of Magellan (four months) at a sizeable cost both to the govern ment and to correspondents. A great organizer, the indefatigable Butterfield, much to the surprise of the incredulous, reduced both cost and time (twenty three days). The importance of his venture, however, is measured not merely in time and money saved. Together with the telegraph and the steamship the Overland helped to unite East and West. It encouraged migration and the</page><page sequence="13">84 BRIEF NOTICES settlement of the West, with many of the stations along the trail developing later into present-day towns and cities. It prepared the way for the railroad, pointing out in many places the more feasible route, and making the people conscious of the possibility, the advantages, and the necessity of spanning the continent. This neglected phase of western history has apparently absorbed the interest of the Conklings for some time. There is indication that Mr. Conkling was seeking information on mail contracts as long ago as 1902 (I, 98). Both college graduates, and one a geographer and topographer, they have traversed some 50,000 miles of old trails, and every mile of the old Butterfield. They have con sulted freely written materials, both published and manuscript, and have inter viewed a number of eyewitnesses. The present work is the fruit of this in terest and labor. It gives a detailed account of the Butterfield Trail itself, the stations along the way with their personnel, the experiences of some of the passengers, and interesting sidelights on the history of the land through which the trail passed. Accompanying the two volumes is an excellent atlas with helpful and instructive maps and illustrations. The work, however, is not beyond criticism. The style is good but the geographical order followed by the authors, one station after another from East to West, makes for a monotony which is aggravated at times by the inclusion of irrelevant details on the grandparents of the stationkeeper. The footnoting is poor both from the point of view of what is and what is not footnoted. The references cited are not always the most authoritative (1,49), and there is present at times a tendency to exaggerate (1,40,51,104,130). There are a number of historical inaccuracies, particularly in the introductory chapter on western territorial expansion. Much of this criticism, however, is readily over looked in view of the valuable contribution the authors have made to our knowledge of the West in the 1850's and 1860's. (Timothy J. Casey) Cotter, Maire. Westward by Command. (Cork, Eire: Mercier Press, Ltd. 1947. Pp. 159. $2.50.) At this time when the Church is promoting devotion to the Sacred Heart in its various forms with such great urgency, the biography of an outstanding devotee of this devotion, Mother Cabrini, seems particularly appropriate. The author does not explicitly seek to foster devotion to the Sacred Heart. Rather the motive of confidence and trust in the divine Heart is woven into the entire life of this remarkable woman as the very cornerstone of her great success. On the opening day of the Columbus Hospital in Chicago in March, 1904, in answering Dr. Murphy's speech, Mother Cabrini, in her typical manner, said: "I am not even an instrument but only a spectator of God's work" (p. 120). Her faith and hope in the Sacred Heart made her see clearly the needs of the poor and unfortunate throughout the world. We cannot but feel blessed that because of Leo XIII's explicit command "not to the East but to the West," Mother Cabrini became a citizen of this country and made its poor and for gotten children the specific object of her zeal. Her absolute surrender to the Sacred Heart kept the resources of the 'Bank of Providence' flowing into any</page><page sequence="14">BRIEF NOTICES 85 project conceived as an aid in her work. The perfect and heroic union of her own will with the Divine Will made real what seemed mere fantasy to others. So often during her life she remarked to her sisters: "I am afraid only of want of confidence in God, my protector" (p. 74). No doubt the first part of the book describing Mother Cabrini's background and training makes the more interesting and better reading. The author gives a vivid background of local Italian conditions affecting the Cabrini family, its ideals and ambitions. The gay 1890's of the young United States find a sad contrast in the well traced drab social conditions of the Italian immigrants on New York's East Side. The latter part of the volume necessarily falls into a rather routine enumera tion of foundations, albeit with an agreeable fluency and ease. A world wandered so far from the Sacred Heart is in need of Mother Cabrini's great spirit. As suredly Miss Cotter's book is a singular contribution in filling this need. (Peter J. Hill) Cramer, John H. Lincoln Under Fire. (Baton Rouge: Louisiana State Uni versity Press. 1948. Pp. xv, 138. $2.50.) This book brings together the stories of Lincoln under fire in July, 1864. It will be of value to those interested in either the Civil War or the great emancipator. It should also interest anyone of a legal turn of mind, and the attempt to piece together the story of what really happened should be required of all devoted readers of detective fiction. In 1864 Grant was striving to win Richmond; Lee as a counterblow sent Jubal Early northward. The famed leader swept down the Shenandoah Valley and then eastward. At Frederick the man who had begun the trip barefooted eventually found shoes and on they came. Lew Wallace and his few men were swept aside at the Monocacy and the way to the capital was open. Perhaps Washington could have been taken by a desperate effort, but Early's men were exhausted and footsore. Time was on the side of the defenders, for help from the veteran Sixth Corps was on the way. Some firing took place at Fort Stevens on July 11 and 12. Lincoln came out to see the action and was exposed to enemy fire. What actually occurred in these moments when for the only time in our history the President was under fire? General Wright, or a young colonel, or some other soldier, or "Aunt Betty" Thomas, or Captain Oliver W. Holmes or Mrs. Lincoln ordered the President down after at least one person had been shot near him. Mr. Cramer leans toward the story of General Wright and gives some credence to Holmes' version. Perhaps the truth will never be known. In the words of the author, "No one of the tales of Lincoln under fire need be accepted completely ; no one of them need be discarded fully." The book is well indexed. (Basil L. Lee) Dawes, Elizabeth and Norman H. Baynes (Translators). Three Byzantine Saints. Contemporary Biographies translated from the Greek. (Oxford : Basil Blackwell; New York: William Salloch. 1948. Pp. xiv, 275. $5.00.)</page><page sequence="15">86 BRIEF NOTICES In this interesting work Miss Dawes presents a translation of the lives of St. Daniel the Stylite (409-93) and St. Theodore of Sykeon (d. 613), both written by disciples and eye-witnesses, and of St. John the Almsgiver (d. c. 620), by Leontius, Bishop of Neapolis in Cyprus, a compatriot and admirer. Professor Baynes prefaces each with a summary account of the historical background and the author, and supplies notes and bibliography. He also contributes a short general introduction on the ideals and the religious and social influence of the Byzantine ascetic. There is an index of proper names. An extraordinary feature of the narratives is the superhuman mortification of a St. Daniel or a St. Theodore, the former, for instance, standing on his pillar while his feet were eaten up by maggots. St. John, the Patriarch of Alexandria, presents a striking contrast; he practices no such astounding penances but attains sanctity by his unbounded generosity, his pleasant and tactful manner, his unsparing devotion to his flock. Again, until we read these lives, we scarcely realize how exclusively the Byzantine historiographer was taken up with the court and aristocracy. We come into a different world, where we mingle with the everyday people of Constantinople that flocked to St. Daniel's pillar, where we share the sorrows and curious superstitions of the farmer or artisan in Galatia with St. Theodore, or the bad luck of the sea captain at Alexandria with St. John. Here we meet Byzantium's man on the street. Often, too, in the hagiographical literature we find valuable facts; for instance, the life of St. Daniel informs us how Zeno came to the attention of Leo I. The student will never catch the atmosphere of Byzantium better than in these biographies written for the common folk. Miss Dawes and Professor Baynes have done good work. The translation is fluent and unlabored, the explanatory prefaces and notes accurate and pertinent. Particularly valuable is the introduction by Professor Baynes whose insight helps the reader greatly toward a sympathetic understanding of the genre. (Martin J. Higgins) Dennett, Raymond and Robert K. Turner (Eds.) Documents on American Foreign Relations. Vol. VIII, July 1,1945-December 31,1946. (Princeton: Pub lished for the World Peace Foundation by Princeton University Press, 1948. Pp. xxxvii, 962. $6.00.) For the eighteen months within the limits set for this volume the editors faced a tremendous task of compression. In spite of the decision to make a separate publication of the material relating to the "role of the United States in the negotiation of the peace treaties with Bulgaria, Hungary, Italy, Rumania, and Finland," it was nevertheless a formidable amount that remained to be squeezed into approximately 1000 pages. The grouping of material again begins with "Principles and Policy," followed by "Conduct of Foreign Rela tions;" but then Chapter III becomes "The Termination of the War," and the other chapters reflect a departure from the conventional pattern of the former volumes because of "the transitional nature of the period dealt with." The appendices include the Yalta and Potsdam decisions as revealed in belated press releases of the Department of State of March 24, 1947. (John T. Farrell)</page><page sequence="16">BRIEF NOTICES 87 Denomy, Alexander J., C.S.B. The Heresy of Courtly Love. (New York: Dec?an X. McMullen Co. 1948. Pp. 91. $1.50.) The ideal of courtly love is one of the id?es ma?tresses of western literary tra dition. It was introduced by the troubadours of the south of France in the early decades of the twelfth century. It consists essentially of three elements: the conception of love as increasing an unsatiated desire, the ennobling force of this love as the source of all virtue, and the cult of the amata as a superior being. This love, which is usually illicit and adulterous at least in aspiration, cannot be reconciled with the moral law or supernatural virtue. The origin of this ideal is to be found in the mystical philosophy of Avicenna. That this ideal was proposed by Christians was due to the doctrine of the so-called "double truth," whereby an opposition is erected between nature and grace, between reason and faith, between philosophy and theology. This doctrine of the "double-truth" the troubadours received not from Averroes, but from the predecessors of Averroes who had professed much the same veneration for Aristotle and the same attitude toward philosophy as the highest truth. Father Denomy, an authority on the origin and development of the ideal of courtly love, possesses a peculiarly happy gift for clear presentation. The book is well annotated. When he quotes the troubadours in the text he trans lates them in the notes; he should also have translated the troubadours when quoting them in the notes. The publishers are to be commended for an at tractively printed book. The Candlemas Lectures on Christian Literature have had a brilliant introduction. (Robert Wilde) Dowd, David Lloyd. Jacques-Louis David and the French Revolution, Pageant-Master of the Republic. (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Studies. June, 1948. New Series No. 3. Pp. xiv, 205. $2.50 cloth; $1.50 paper.) This book brings us for the first time an impartial account of Jacques Louis David and his important contributions to furthering the cause of the French Revolution. The amount of research as indicated in the preface of the volume, in addition to the fine documentation, would alone recommend the work as a wealth of information on the early history of the republic and David who is represented as the prime mover of the plastic art propaganda move ment. This scholarly volume on the propaganda aspects of the French Revolu tion has been a revelation in the sense of the importance of the arts in guiding the masses to an easy understanding of their role in this form of government. Mr. Dowd presents David in an unbiased manner (cf. the essay on sources and the quotations from David's many enemies which in many instances were claims and accusations that generally misrepresented the facts). The last chapter sets forth the author's analysis of the festivals, and it is about the most interest ing part of the book. He shows how David in his masterly handling of the festival with its many sections such as music, theatrical products, pageantry, and dancing added a very important segment to the picture with his element of mass participation, the importance and significance of which has been emphasized many times in preceding chapters. David's success as a propagandist was due to many reasons, one of the most</page><page sequence="17">88 BRIEF NOTICES important being his appeal to the "common man" in his paintings. In the "peasant episode" the author shows the manner in which David makes a simple peasant picture himself as a heroic Roman who sees himself on Federa tion Day taking the oath to be faithful to the nation. The question is asked: "Why did David accept the Revolution or rally to the new order?" It is clearly shown that not only was the reason for this found in his personality but also that there must have been professional and class interests as well. , After a reading of the book and of the realization of the effectiveness of David's work upon the scene, one may readily place him in the French Revolu tion by this descriptive quote, viz., that the revolution was "a lyrical drama, verse by Chenier, music by Gossec, setting by David." (Francis Joseph Manno) Edge, Walter Evans. A Jerseyman's Journal. (Princeton: Princeton Uni versity Press. 1948. Pp. xi, 349. $5.00.) Former Governor Walter E. Edge of New Jersey gives us here the interest ing record of a busy lifetime devoted to business and politics. The early chapters tell a typical American "success story," for Edge began his career as a printer's devil in Atlantic City, working himself up rapidly to the ownership of a news paper and a world-wide advertising agency. He played a significant role in the development and publicizing of Atlantic City as a first-ranking seashore resort. Paralleling this highly successful business career was Edge's constant interest and participation in local and state politics. As the security of his own financial position became progressively more assured, Edge devoted more and more of his time to the political field. By 1917, when he became Governor of New Jersey for the first time, he placed his business interests definitely in the background to devote himself wholeheartedly to the concerns of public life. Edge's political career was a full and varied one. He served the state twice in the position of governor during each of the two World Wars. In between these terms he was United States Senator under Wilson, Harding, and Coolidge. In 1929 President Hoover sent him as ambassador to France. Following ten years of retirement from active life, Edge returned to the political scene in 1944 when he once more became governor. His second term holds special interest because of his unsuccessful effort to obtain popular approbation of a new state constitution, which was in large measure defeated by the Catholic opposition. The general reader should appreciate A Jerseyman's lournal, as it is written in an easy, flowing style and records a long and interesting life. The historian will value it even more for the picture it gives of political life and activity on the state, national, and international levels. (William Keller) Felder, William, O.F.M.Cap. The Knight-Errant of Assisi. Translated by Berchmans Bittle, O.F.M.Cap. (Milwaukee: Bruce Publishing Co. 1948. Pp. xii, 152. $2.50.) This book purports to portray "the knightly element which gives to the per sonality of the Little Poor Man its wholly peculiar, yes, its wholly unique character." Bishop Felder does not set out to write the Poverello's life. He</page><page sequence="18">BRIEF NOTICES 89 paints St. Francis here in striking interpretation; one, however, conceived by Francis' earliest biographers. Francis' whole life is inspired and exalted by the great impact of chivalry with all its facets from liege loyalty to knightly love. The evidence advanced for this view can leave no one in doubt. The facts are taken from the lives of Francis by Thomas of Celano, the Three Companions, and St. Bonaventure, but these are checked against the latest research, and many interesting details are added by A. Fortini's Nova vita di San Francesco dAssisi published in 1926 after Bishop Felder's great work on St. Francis, a result of his findings in the archives of Assisi. Eminent authorities are cited in all cases dealing with the aspects of knightly mediaeval life. This reviewer felt that at times the efforts to demonstrate the impact of chivalry were somewhat overdone, or, at least, shaded by a romantic element as in the cases of the crusaders before Jerusalem, or concerning the military orders. Francis was surely aware of the darker side to knighthood, and had a more realistic approach been taken, his personality as influenced by chivalry would have been even more compelling. However, one cannot doubt knighthood's force on the saint after reading this enlightening and charming book. The translation has captured in good measure the spirit of the original. (Richard H. Trame) Ferm, Vergilius (Ed.). Religion in the Twentieth Century. (New York: Philosophical Library. 1948. Pp. xv, 470. $5.00.) This volume suffers from all the defects and shortcomings characteristic of the several recent attempts to treat of twenty and more religions within the compass of a few hundred pages. In addition to the usual Oriental, Jewish, and Christian forms, this compilation includes several unique religions?Ethical Culture, the Ramakrishna Movement, Naturalistic Humanism, and Reconstructionism. The Catholic must necessarily take exception to much that is stated by the editor in his lengthy preface. The usual latitudinarian, common-denominator, and re ligion-without-dogma ideas prevail. The editor appears to live in expectant anticipation of what religion will emerge from the present milieu ! He foresees a coming religion "that will cut across the streams of religious tradition and merge the values of all the faiths: each contributing its full share to the total view of life in the light of the greater prophets or the voice of God in all of them." The exposition of the various religions by men competent in their respective faiths is well done. Proselytizing and unfavorable comparisons are usually avoided. No attempt is made to portray the numerous ramifications of Protestantism. They are all more or less amalgamated into two disappointing chapters entitled "Conservative Protestantism" and "Liberal Protestantism." Several other religions, which we regard as Protestant derivatives, receive spe cial attention, e.g., Quakers, Swedenborgians, Anglo-Catholics, Mormons, Sal vation Army, Christian Science, and Jehovah's Witnesses. The treatment of Catholicism is quite satisfactory under the strictures such a volume necessarily imposes. To the reviewer's mind, however, the Catholic Church suffers woe</page><page sequence="19">90 BRIEF NOTICES fully by insertion into a volume of this nature. The few pages devoted to it, no matter how well done, can never adequately portray its full stature and im portance. It is lost in the maze of dissimilar and conflicting religious opinions. (Paul J. Knapke) Fischer, Eric. The Passing of the European Age: A Study of the Transfer of Western Civilisation and Its Renewal in Other Continents. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 1948. Pp. xv, 228. $3.50.) That in general the age of European western civilization is gone, but that a transformed western civilization may survive in new centers outside Europe, is the burden of this compact little volume by a visiting associate professor at the University of Virginia, the revised edition of a work which originally made its appearance in 1943. It is a burden which the book bears gracefully and convincingly. However, those who have read the first edition need not examine this present one. There have been some changes in emphasis, but the essential thesis is the same. The chapter which examines the causation of the passing of civilizations, an excellent exercise of analysis, has been expanded and is well worth a second perusal. The author's technique is simple. After an introduction which explains his general theme, he proceeds to demonstrate how the various rival centers of European civilization?since Europe can be called one center only by gross simplification?have shifted to other continents, undergoing a transformation in the process. He discusses, e.g., Latin America, the British Commonwealth of Nations, the Russian shift toward Asia, and the transfer from Europe of the cultural influence of smaller nations, such as the Dutch and the Scandinavians. Throughout these chapters one is impressed with Professor Fischer's easy familiarity with nearly every aspect of human achievement?with painting, music, science, and industry. Finally, the factors which operate to make civiliza tion pass are considered, and an interesting comparison is drawn between the status of Greek civilization in the second century B.C. and European civiliza tion in the twentieth century of our era. Fischer's thesis is not original but it is, of course, enormously significant for everyone today, and he gives it a clear presentation which the lay reader will especially appreciate. Also those scholars who have been depressed by Spenglerian pessimism will find this book a welcome antidote, for the author points out that transfer and transformation are not synonymous with death. (James H. Bailey, II) Gade, John Allyne. The Life and Times of Tycho Brake. (Princeton: Princeton University Press for the American-Scandinavian Foundation. 1947. Pp. xii, 209. $4.50.) Tycho Brahe was a provoking and jarring amalgam of scientific scholar, alchemist, astrologer, and irresponsible nobleman. His fame rests upon his painstakingly recorded observations of the heavens which provided the material for Kepler's formulation of the laws of planetary motion. The substance of his thought and achievements receives only brief mention in this work, which,</page><page sequence="20">BRIEF NOTICES 91 however, provides an interesting description of Brahe's observatory at Hveen. Mr. Gade is full of an antiquarian's enthusiasm for D?nica, an enthusiasm which he does not make infectious. Brahe's search for harmony in the heavens is sub ordinated to stories of his search for patronage and his subsequent extravagance and tribulations. He was not the peer of any great genius of the Renaissance, as the author rashly suggests, although his arrogance and self-confidence were more than ample to sustain his considerable accomplishments. The present study is written without any deep sense of intellectual and scientific background. It is further weakened by the author's attempt to make Brahe a pioneer of the scientific method. He is credited with scepticism and unconcern about astrology. But the author himself provides sufficient material to reveal Brahe as a believer in and panderer to the very widespread astrological beliefs of his time. In a number of places the author's imprecise language is responsible for other con tradictions. He is bewilderingly ready to demonstrate that Brahe's horoscopes were not wide of the mark. In one case he does this by putting the massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day in 1573 rather than in 1572 (p. 41). Brahe's prediction had been made ten weeks after the event. (M. A. Fitzsimons) Gidden, Paul H. Early Days of Oil. (Princeton: Princeton University Press. 1948. Pp. viii, 150. $6.00.) In this third publication on the development of the oil industry, Dr. Giddens presents 365 original illustrations judiciously selected from over 3000 negatives preserved in the Drake Museum at Titusville, Pennsylvania. These originals, taken by John A. Mather along Oil Creek and Environs, cover a period of forty years beginning in 1859. Mather by boat or wagon followed the oil men, taking pictures of the early wells and their operators, their equipment and refineries; the means of transportation as it progressed from the teamster on plank roads, to the pond freshet, the railroad, the steamboat and towboat; the boom towns with their places of business, hotels, and amusements. That an investment of $68 could yield $75,000, or that an individual could earn $45,000 per day is of interest to the student of economics ; the ghost town of Pithole, the career of "Coal Oil Johnny," the Columbia Coronet Band, or the view of Corinthian Hall contribute a chapter to social history. Though local in scope, such names as Edwin L. Drake, Benjamin Silliman, Ida M. Tarbell, and John D. Rockefeller which appear in the volume indicate its bearing upon national life. There is no reference to any interest in political affairs except associations to oppose impending tax on crude oil by the state legislature. The illustrations presented here give no evidence of any Catholicity among the pioneers; yet other accounts cite Methodist, Presbyterian, and Catholic churches in even the forgotten town of Petroleum Center. Despite the fact that pictoral history has little challenge for the intellect, this study has merit, for the pictures are from original sources and are pre sented in chronological order with sufficient caption and explanatory note to be instructive. A documented list of photographs by chapter is appended. (Sister Theophane Geary)</page><page sequence="21">92 BRIEF NOTICES Goodman, Abram Vossen. American Overture: Jewish Rights in Colonial Times. (Philadelphia: Jewish Publication Society of America. 1947. Pp. xiv, 265. $3.00.) The present work is offered as a study of the development of civic equality and religious liberty for the American Jew during the pre-revolutionary period. This is by no means a complete study nor was it intended as such. Rather does the author attempt to point out "the interaction of Jewish forces with the early American scene as manifested in the expanding rights" of a minority group of about a thousand among a population of almost three million. To accomplish this end he has treated the plight of the Jew in each of the original thirteen colonies, contrasting the legal and religious handicaps and prejudices encountered abroad and in America during the early colonial period with conditions as they existed on the eve of the Revolution. Thus the work is not only a narration of the progress of the Jews toward citizenship status, but a segment of the story of the development of the American doctrine con cerning man's religious beliefs and civil rights and the Jewish role in that development. That struggle was, to be sure, a difficult one, save in the instance of South Carolina which was more liberal than the other colonies. The per sistence of the group, however, met with success as is manifestly clear in the election of one of its number to the first Provincial Congress, and, although later, the election of another as Governor of Georgia in 1801. The account is rather well documented throughout and wide use is made of diaries, colonial laws, and travel accounts. The presentation is made without prejudice and the style is attractive. (Francis J. Zimoch) Grierson, Francis (Ed.) The Valley of Shadows. (Boston: Houghton Mifflin Co. 1948. Pp. xiii, 278. $3.50.) At the age of fifty-two the author of this volume, Benjamin Henry Jesse Francis Shepard, began his ten years of labor in recalling his childhood mem ories of Sangamon County, Illinois, which resulted in a good, literary account of the homely people of Abraham Lincoln's area of the 1850's. His parents had emigrated from England and, after several years of wandering, settled successively at Sangamon County and Alton, Illinois, St. Louis, Missouri, and Niagara Falls. The opening chapter presents the main thread of the book, when the preacher at the long-unused meeting house took as his text the quotation from Isaias: "'For they should cry unto the Lord bekase of the oppressors, en he shall send them a saviour, en a great one, en he shall deliver them,' " and after beginning his talk with a great amount of hesitancy and confusion he finished the sermon in a blaze of glory by the following application of the quotation: "En who shall deliver them? Do any o' ye know? Brethering, thar ain't but one human creatur ekil to it, en thet air Abraham Lincoln. The Lord hez called him !" This is the beginning of the mysticism evident through out the whole book. From here on there is a sharp conflict over the question of slavery, of the underground railway, of the Lincoln-Douglas debates, and of the outbreak of the Civil War. Most of the chapters are relevant to this</page><page sequence="22">BRIEF NOTICES 93 theme, while others give a good account of the mentality of the common people of this period, their system of logic, and their living conditions. Several chapters are particularly striking. His description of the Lincoln-Douglas debate at Alton, which he witnessed, Fremont's attempt to locate a new and better passage to California m 1848, and Grant's preparation for, and attack upon, Vicksburg are very good. His account of a revival meeting gives an idea of Protestantism among the early inhabitants and the part that religion played in their lives. In one chapter, Shephard also tells of the favorable impression that Catholicism made upon him while attending Mass at St. Xavier Church in St. Louis. In general, the book gives a good idea of the people and their problems of Lincoln's Illinois. In the introduction there is a good biographical sketch of the author and a summary of his varied works. (Theodore Fuertges) Gwynn, Denis. Father Dominic Barberi. (Buffalo, New York: Desmond and Stapleton. 1948. Pp. ix, 254. $3.00.) Among the books written to commemorate the Newman centenary is this short account of the life of the priest who brought the great cardinal into the Church. It is a useful work since it fills a gap in historical literature, caused by the fact that Father Urban Young's works on Barberi, which were based on his letters and other documents bearing on his life, have gone out of print. Gwynn draws on the material contained in these scarce volumes and presents his story in a simplified narrative form, the conciseness of which is an indication of his immense knowledge of the field. Pertinent material from standard works on Newman, Wiseman, and Barberi's other friends, is used for historical back ground. Father Dominic Barberi is not only a timely presentation, it is also full of edi fication, aptly describing the virtues of a saintly man, who, as a lay-brother novice in Italy, with no knowledge of England, received a divine intimation that the tri umphant work of his life would be his service as a priest in England, and who never stopped hoping that the vocation would be realized, even when it seemed impossible for a despairingly long time. A selection of the Catholic Book Club and of Spiritual Book Associates, Gwynn's work is for the general public. However, he has packed away in an appendix a choice morsel of historical research in the form of direct evidence bearing on the authorship of a letter to the Paris Univers in 1841, setting forth the position of the Oxford group. This letter was the occasion of Father Bar beri's beginning a literary correspondence with Dalgairns, making him the only Catholic priest in England on intimate terms with the community at Littlemore ; and it led ultimately to the conversions of Dalgairns and Newman. Wilfred Ward says that the Univers letter was written by his father, W. G. Ward, and was translated for publication in France by Dalgairns. Gwynn points out that Jules Gondon, in his work, De la r?union de l'?glise d'Angleterre Protestante ? l'?glise Catholique, states that in 1867 it was no longer necessary to conceal the fact that Dalgairns was the author of the letter, and he cites an interesting proof that Gondon met Dalgairns in Oxford in 1842 and discussed the matter with him. (Martin J. McCabe)</page><page sequence="23">94 BRIEF NOTICES Hart, James. The American Presidency in Action: 1789. (New York: Mac millan Co. 1948. Pp. xv, 256. $4.00.) Professor Hart has sub-titled this work : "A Study in Constitutional History." To him the term "constitution" has two distinct meanings: 1) a single, written instrument, the source of all formal legal authority; 2) the sum-total of rules whether written or unwritten which define the basic features of a government. Using this second definition as the broad basis for his study, he finds that the constitutional roles of the President are: 1) his ceremonial role as chief of state; 2) his legal role as chief magistrate; 3) his political role as party leader. By a careful selection of primary source materials he illustrates how these three aspects of the American presidency developed during the single year 1789. In the preparation of this work Mr. Hart claims that he followed Sir John Seeley's dictum that "political science without history has no root." After reading the book, however, one cannot help feeling that he acted much more on the view he expressed about ten years ago when he commended his colleague, W. W. Willoughby, for playing ". . . a major part in proclaiming the declara tion of independence of political science from history and economics. . . ." Perhaps, this is merely the subjective criticism of a student of history who thinks it is the most inclusive of the social sciences. At any rate, Professor Hart's scholarly work could be improved by at least an introductory chapter outlining the historical background of the American presidency. After all, it did not swing suddenly into action in 1789 out of nowhere. It was born with antecedents, some of which go back not only to our own colonial history but deep into the European past, e.g., the constitutional limitations on the executive may be traced to mediaeval theories of kingship. Besides an introductory chapter on the historical background, Mr. Hart should add a few pages summarizing the conclusions of his study. In this way he will enhance the value of his book to the political scientist and to the historian. (Thomas A. Dunlea) Jenkins, Elmer (Ed.) Guide to America. (Washington: Public Affairs Press. 1947. Pp. 705. $5.00.) Elmer Jenkins, national travel director of the American Automobile Associa tion, and his competent staff of assistants have compiled a valuable addition to the Travelers' Library. The work is a handbook of pertinent information rela tive to each of the forty-eight states and the District of Columbia. It covers the history, geography, economy, and the recreation and intellectual life of each state. The volume describes museums, shrines, libraries, sports and social events?in fact, every characteristic phase of local and state life. It is, indeed, a travelers' encyclopedia. There is, however, a disproportionate amount of space given to the accounts of certain states, e.g., the descriptions of California, Florida, and Virginia receive detailed accounts many pages longer than that given to New York. A note of caution should be directed at the "history" of each state. Undoubtedly the historical description was written primarily for the layman and not the scholar, but any "history" of the State of Oregon which describes in detail the early explorations and the dispute with Great Britain and neglects any mention of the treaty settlement of June 15, 1846, is certainly superficial.</page><page sequence="24">BRIEF NOTICES 95 Again, Spain did not "sell" Florida to the United States in "1820." The Adams Onis Treaty whereby Florida was ceded, not sold, to the United States was signed on February 22, 1819, and approved two years later. Despite the sketchy and sometimes erroneous historical treatment, the handbook satisfies a definite need for which the American Automobile Association and its travel director are to be commended. (Finbarr Bohan) Johnson, Humphrey, J. T. The Bible and Early Man. (New York: Dec?an X. McMullen Co. 1948. Pp. ix, 159. $2.25.) The author of this borderline study in the domains of religion and science has come to grips with questions that have of late received much attention from authoritative sources in the Church. During the year in which this revised edition appeared, we have had a letter from the secretary of the Pontifical Biblical Commission to Cardinal Suhard of Paris dealing with the early chapters of Genesis; the Rector of the Biblical Institute in Rome and numerous other Catholic scripturists have written in the wake of that letter on the same general topic. Cardinal Lienart of Lille addressed a pastoral letter to his people on similar questions. Timely this discussion is, indeed; and based on wide information. It gives an impression of intending to demonstrate the truth that those whose under standing of human origins is derived in the first instance from the Bible need not be ignorant of, or neglect, what the scientist can learn or infer from experi mental probing into the vestiges of bygone ages. In the letter to Cardinal Suhard, referred to above, the point was justly made that students of the Scriptures have still much work to do before any apodictic pronouncements can be made as to the full implications intended by the inspired author himself, in the narratives at the beginning of Genesis. Nor are the scientists at one, by any means, in assessing the results of their investigations of early man, in which the hypotheses continually outrun the facts. In these circumstances it is easy to affirm that Father Johnson's study contains things which will not be accepted by the scientists as scientific, nor by the exegetes as valid exposition of the Scriptures. The accumulation of folklore accounts of the origin of woman (p. 72) is quaint and entertaining, but not serviceable. The treatment of the flood story (pp. 153-54) is almost violently "concordist." Not Tiamat, but Leviathan, is the ancient mythological counterpart of the dragon in the Apocalypse, and the type of Satan (pp. 103-105). Not early, but the late Hebrew tradition (cf. Acts 13-21) made Saul reign forty years (p. 140) ; and so probably for the figures in the Book of Judges. Thus this study is a survey; it is not yet a synthesis. (Patrick W. Skehan) The Journals and Indian Paintings of George Winter, 1837-1839. (India napolis: Indiana Historical Society. 1948. Pp. xix, 208. $12.50.) Meager, indeed, were the portraits and scenes of Indian life when George Winter (1809-1876), an English art student, arrived in New York in 1830. In fected with the romanticism of his age, he was lured by 1835 to the "land of the Wabash" where he purposed to see and learn something about the natives since</page><page sequence="25">96 BRIEF NOTICES he was desirous of "exercising his pencil in that direction." His "exercise" re sulted in seventy water color paintings and several pen and pencil sketches of the Potawatomi and Miami Indians. The Indiana Historical Society has reproduced and included in this volume twenty-four of Winter's water colors and six of his pen and ink sketches each with an accompanying brief commentary. It has also edited and annotated his two journals, accounts of visits to the same tribes. Besides the paintings and journals the volume contains an introduction by the secretary of the society, an appraisal of Winter as an artist by the director of the John Herron Art Museum, and a biographical sketch of Winter based upon an unfinished auto biography and his "voluminous correspondence and writings." Commenting on Winter's sketches the Lafayette (Indiana) Courier (1870) said they comprised more history of early times in Indiana than could be extracted from the state archives. Non-artist readers interested in Indian history will probably appreciate more the journals where Winter with the artist's keenness of perception has noted and described in vivid word pictures the physical and intellectual traits of the Potawatomi and Miami as well as their dress, customs, and villages. The fact that he portrayed those tribes first-hand in their native setting just before they were removed from Indiana and sent west of the Mississippi where they lost their identity by intermarriage with other tribes, is of added historical importance. Those interested in the American natives will be grateful to Winter for preserving from oblivion two picturesque tribes of the central United States and to the Indiana Historical Society for making his works available. (Sister M. Antonio Johnston) Journals of the House of Representatives of Massachusetts. Volume XXIII. 1746-1747. (Boston: Massachusetts Historical Society. 1948. Pp. xi, 419. $3.00.) The House of Representatives of the Province of Massachusetts, in the years 1746-1747 was involved in the prosecution of two wars: King George's War and its own private affair with Governor William Shirley. The most important business recorded in the Journal for the session concerned one or the other. Friction points between the house and the governor were many: relations with the Six Nations, the garrison at Annapolis, impressment of men out of the militia, settlement of soldiers' claims, and the patrol of the frontier. Governor Shirley, despite his liberal use of all the arts of persuasion, could not prevail upon the representatives to vote funds for a second invasion of Canada, as long as Great Britain failed to reimburse the Americans for the expenditures on the siege of Louisburg. Even the threat that a recapture of Nova Scotia, settled with about 30,000 inhabitants, "all French Roman Catho licks," would be directed against the counties in Maine and the province of New Hampshire, did not deter the house from saddling appropriations with restric tive clauses. Although the house preserved the proper show of deference in dealing with the king's agent, the independent spirit that was to be shown in succeeding decades was already in posse. This volume, the twenty-third in the series started in 1919, is the type of work that the Massachusetts Historical Society does exceedingly well. The quaint</page><page sequence="26">BRIEF NOTICES 97 legislative forms and terminology have been scrupulously preserved and the volume is singularly free from error. The index is thorough and the typography is a fine piece of craftsmanship. Any question as to the value of republishing such source material as these Journals would seem to be answered by the fact that the present session of the Massachusetts legislature has entertained a petition seeking the appointment of a commission to prepare a history of that body. (Allan J. Doherty) Labaree, Leonard Woods. Conservatism in Early American History. (New York: New York University Press; London: Geoffrey Cumberlege, Oxford University Press, 1948. Pp. xiii, 289. $3.75.) This volume contains the Phelps Lectures on early American history given by Professor Labaree at New York University in the spring of 1947. The author's purpose was to examine the part played by conservative men in the colonies during the hundred years that preceded the Revolution. Changes of tremendous importance took place during this period. Indeed, the forces causing them were so powerful that the question arises as to why the transformation did not go on at a faster rate or produce even more radical effects. The answer is to be found in the conservatism of many of the colonists. In almost every colony a closely allied ruling class consisting of landed pro prietors or wealthy merchants dominated politics. They sustained religious, social, political, and economic conservatism. In fact, they were the most powerful forces behind conservatism. Many of the clergy of the established churches opposed a change that threatened their entrenched positions. The Great Awakening was particularly obnoxious to them, and the Anglican Church was especially conservative because of its ties with the mother country. Conservatism prevailed in education, and especially in the colleges were scholasticism and the scholastic method were living forces. Stratification definitely existed in society, although a man of ability could advance himself by the use of proper opportunities. Amongst the political theorists, Locke predominated. Both conservatives and radicals used his principle to justify their positions, although a few of the extreme conservatives completely repudiated Locke. In the concluding chapter the author points out that the American Revolu tion was in part, "a civil conflict between fellow Americans who disagreed in the solution of their current problems" (p. 144). Some colonists decided to stand with the British. Why? Many were opposed to change. Others found loyalism advantageous. But material motives were not the only explanation, for loyal ism existed not only among those who were high in social circles but among the lowly. Further explanation must be sought in the psychology of the loyalists. They were temperamentally conservative. Many believed resistance to established authority was morally wrong. For others, loyalism was a slow development. Very few colonists approved British policy after the Stamp Act. Many would have preferred to maintain a middle course in the dispute but were forced into the British camp by the uncompromising attitude of the radicals. Others recog nized that independence was bound to come sooner or later, but they felt that the opportune time had not yet arrived. They wanted to find out to what they were committing themselves before they acted.</page><page sequence="27">98 BRIEF NOTICES Conservatism in Early American History is a well-balanced book. Professor Labaree is always objective and impartial. He has done a real service by gathering together from many scattered sources material relating to the con servative element in the colonies. Using this material impartially, he discusses both the faults of the conservatives and the reasons why they preferred to oppose the colonial liberals and radicals. (Edward T. Harrington) Lacour-Gayet, Robert. Les grandes crises de l'histoire de France. (Mont r?al: Les ?ditions Vari?t?s. 1945. Pp. 278.) In his first sentence the author disavows any pretense at writing a history of France and professes to use the record of the past as a source of illustration and inspiration in his study of selected critical periods in the national existence of Frenchmen. After a consideration of the various types of crises he concludes that the main criterion for his selections was "external threats and interior dangers" to national unity? Since the author aspired to furnish motives of con fidence and an understanding of threatening upheavals, he shows that France, like other nations, has existed between alternating periods of confidence and fear due to geographic location, climatic conditions, natural resources, and espe cially to the struggle between the innate forces of dissolution and cohesion. For his purpose Mr. Lacour-Gayet has chosen these eight movements as the most critical in French history: viz., the disappearance of the Roman Empire, the Capetian Accession, the Hundred Years' War, the Wars of Religion, the Revolution of 1789, the Restoration, the Revolution of 1848, and the establish ment of the Third Republic. For the detailed accounts of these events there is not a single reference to either a primary or secondary source; however, most of the material can be found in any textbook of European history. In the study of these upheavels the author's eye seems to be searching for all traces and con nections of legitimacy and heredity of the recognized rulers. His final deduction is that national unity emerged as the result of innate French moderation and rationality. According to him France has the "essential touch" of reconciling new ideologies with her traditional centuries, thereby obtaining "unity in the continued serenity of her grandeur." Since the author in his first chapter ap proved as "profound" Michelet's La France est une personne, he can more strongly conclude with P?guy's verse-appeal to the hope of France?the youth? "as from the voice of God." In all these crises the Church naturally had a prominent role. With the ex ception of the Third Republic, the author recognizes these activities ; and in his earlier chapters he gives some impressive descriptions of the part of the Church in the fights and the effects of her contributions to the stabilization of the civil authority. In the sentence, "We will find that at this moment 4,400 villages and more than a tenth of the communes bear the names of saints," he indicates that to the present day there remains evidence of France's debt. He calls the latter "not only messengers of God but also architects of the nations" (pp. 44-45). This mixture of nationalism and religion may throw some light on the dis concerting words attributed to Maurice Barres and echoed by so many French men : "Je suis ath?e, mais naturellement je suis Catholique." (Leo L. Rummel)</page><page sequence="28">BRIEF NOTICES 99 Madison, Charles A. Critics and Crusaders: A Century of American Protest. (New York: Henry Holt and Co. 1947. Pp. xii, 572. $3.50.) Herein are found studies of a varied group of eighteen men and two women (Margaret Fuller and Emma Goldman), who labored for liberty in America, not quietly, but some by criticizing and others by crusading. Not all of them did both. Edward Bellamy, for example, is considered not "fanatic enough to initiate a crusade." The author has drawn his material from the books and articles listed in his fifteen-page bibliography. Unhappily, and somewhat un expectedly from one who is a book editor, his quotations are not identified. The non-comformists have been grouped by threes into six general categories, each of which is introduced by a background chapter. These are the abolitionists, Utopians, anarchists, dissident economists, militant liberals, and socialists. Some of the sketches, as in the case of Thorstein Veblen, are for the most part synopses of the man's works. William Lloyd Garrison and John Brown, despite the latest researches, remain unchanged, the former the solitary aboli tionist, the latter an heroic figure. With more success than in showing their contributions the biographical treatments point up the factors of youth and environment which influenced these at times libertine libertarians. It is readily noted how in the United States Christian ideals became less influential in radical lives as the nineteenth century progressed. The personalities chosen and so favorably presented by a left-leaning author are worthy of such inclusion, although some will find that his crusaders may be their cranks. (Henry J. Browne) Marianite Centennial in Louisiana, 1848-1948. No Author (New Orleans: Marianites of Holy Cross. 1948. Pp. 330. $3.50.) In his foreword to this volume, Archbishop Rummel of New Orleans outlines the invitation of Bishop Anthony Blanc in 1847 to the Sisters Marianites of the Holy Cross, founded in Le Mans, France, a few years earlier, to work in his missionary diocese. The growth and development of the sisterhood has paralleled that of the archdiocese during the past century. Today the community, number ing about 250 sisters, operates eighteen elementary and ten high schools in the Archdiocese of New Orleans and in the Dioceses of Lafayette and Natchez. The Very Reverend Basil Anthony Mary Moreau is acknowledged as founded of the fathers and brothers of the Holy Cross (1839) and of the sisters (1841). The first establishments were made in the United States in Indiana (1841) and Louisiana (1848). The Indiana group severed affiliation with Le Mans in 1869 under the direction of Father Edward Sorin who for many years was recognized as founder. The Canadian branch of the sister hood became autonomous from French connections in 1882. Within recent years, through the efforts of Father Albert F. Cousineau, C.S.C., and with the co-operation of the various branches of the sisterhood, a movement has been initiated for the canonization of the common founder, Anthony Moreau. The Louisiana province, still affiliated with the motherhouse at Precigne, Sarthe, France, is now predominantly Irish, having received recruits from Ireland almost from its inception. The name of Haggerty figures in large letters in administrative positions.</page><page sequence="29">100 BRIEF NOTICES The general format of the book is disappointing. There are many illustrations, some inappropriate for this type of work. There is no author, no critical bibliography of source materials, no index, poor proof-reading, and an unsatis factory table of contents. Sentiment overshadows historical writing throughout the work, e.g., "As God feeds Louisiana rivers with His rain showers, so has He constantly fed the stream of Marianite labors . . ." or ". . . this Centennial Record . . . goes afloat upon the streams of time, of which the rivers and bayous are also fitting symbols." No history of a diocese or religious community can be written in a vacuum without interweaving the religious with the political, the social, and the cultural life of the environment in which the scene is laid. The contribution of the Marianites to the history of the Church in the South merits a treatment which the present volume fails to give. (Sister M. Evangeline Thomas) Mazza, Maria Serafina, S. C. Not for Arfs Sake: The Story of II Frontespisio. (New York: King's Crown Press. Columbia University. 1948. Pp. ix, 219. $3.00.) This "story" is the history of a literary movement centered in Florence, in the years between the two World Wars. The leading members of this rich move ment are studied by means of their contributions to the monthly journal // Frontespisio. Among the "major"?according to Sister Serafina's classi fication?collaborators of II Frontespisio, during its publication from 1929 to 1940, were Piero Bargellini, executive editor after 1931, Domenico Giuliotti, the fierce apologist whose L'Ora di Barabba, first published in 1920, still burns in Italy, and Giovanni Papini. The "minor" collaborators included the poet Carlo Bo, the drama critic Augusto Hermet, and the artist and art historian Ardengo Soffici. Indeed, the record of the full work of the men who contributed to ?7 Frontespisio touches the intellectual history of Italy since the turn of the century. It should not be forgotten that the incompatibility of the ideas of these men and the ideology of the fascist state resulted in the death of II Frontespisio in 1940. Those who wrote for 17 Frontespisio, which is used as a point from which to discuss their spiritual and artistic development, strove to be both consciously Catholic and consciously artists. They did not arrive at any formal single aesthetic doctrine, but were content to spread their conviction of the necessary union between faith and art. The persistent influence of France's Catholic writers of the past and present centuries on these men is indicated, but not suf ficiently stressed. The author's analysis of these contributors to the journal, charmingly presented, is searching. The possible implications of their work within the intellectual history of Italy is, however, by no means exhausted. Anyone who studies the Europe between the two wars should neglect neither the effort of // Frontespisio, a thin bright thread in the black fabric of Italy's his tory in these years, nor this first study in English of the movement it repre sented. (Edward Gargan)</page><page sequence="30">BRIEF NOTICES 101 McInnis, Edgar. Canada: A Political and Social History. (New York: Rinehart &amp; Co. 1947. Pp. xv, 574. $5.00.) The good neighborliness which dates itself back to the Rush-Bagot Convention of 1817 is too often overlooked. It seems only a second war-time alliance and uranium deposits have succeeded in bringing Canada forcefully to the attention of citizens of the United States. Such a book as this should help, especially as an auxiliary college text, to deepen that awareness and to bolster an all inclusive notion of Pan-Americanism. The need of doing something in this regard was shown recently by the report of a joint Canadian-American com mittee on education which lamented the paucity and inaccuracy of treatment of each other's history on both sides of the border, and this particularly at the high school level. The author begins with the physiographic features of the Dominion and throughout the work the note of conquest of these natural obstacles is joined with that of progress through compromise in politics and government. This general history is recited in twenty chapters, each with several divisions which only seem to enhance their easy flow. The appendix contains the British North America Act of 1867 and there is a select bibliography as well as eleven maps and ninety-eight illustrations, all of which contribute to the making of a handsome volume. Those accustomed to American history without continental overtones will be interested to see another viewpoint on such matters as the War of 1812 and the boundary disputes of the 1840's. The Catholic reader, however, will not be long in recognizing the Toronto attitude which finds Jesuit missioners "fanatic" and priests in general exciting Indians against heretics. If the contribution of Quebec seems thin or slanted in its presentation in the later periods it should be remembered that French Canadian historians have themselves neglected practically all but the colonial era. As a matter of fact, although studies have been written on the activities of prelates like Plessis of Quebec, Blanchet of Oregon City, and Lynch of Toronto, whom American and Canadian Catholics share somewhat in common, yet the religious aspects of the commingling of the peoples of the two nations have not yet been studied. (Henry J. Browne) McKeow, Charles King. A Study of the Summa philosophiae of the Pseudo Grosseteste. (New York: Columbia University Press. 1948. Pp. xi, 226. $3.25.) The author declares that "the essential character and aim of this study ... is to interpret the Summa philosophiae as exemplifying principles of 'Christian Platonism'." The work runs through six chapters and four appendices. A com plete index is given. The bibliography presents an imposing list of splendid historical sources, secondary as well as primary. The edition of the Pseudo Grosseteste upon which the author bases his critical analysis is that by Ludwig Baur. In the introductory chapter we find an examination of the obscure problem connected with assigning authorship of the Summa. The conclusion proposed, viz., that the author was probably not Grosseteste, is nicely substantiated by circumstantial evidence. The suggestion that Robert Kilwardby may possibly</page><page sequence="31">102 BRIEF NOTICES have written it is not without plausibility. The remaining chapters deal consecu tively with the theory of knowledge, metaphysics, and the philosophy of nature. In the concluding one we are given a "list of basic statements which together determine the development of the doctrine." This list is remarkably easy to read and it provides us with a satisfactory resume of the doctrines contained in the Summa. Read in conjunction with the first appendix, which schematizes the "Structure of the Summa," it furnishes us with a key to the problems heavily concentrated in the middle chapters. The particular merit of this work is not so much its searching analysis of the Summa; it is rather the examination of the Pseudo-Grosseteste in the light of its antecedents and contemporaries. Beginners no less than specialists will be amply repaid for the labor involved in studying this book. They will gain new insight into a very old problem. (Thomas M. Cain) Mercier, Louis A. J. American Humanism and the New Age. (Milwaukee: Bruce Publishing Co., 1948. Pp. xi, 227. $4.00.) The "humanistic reaction" which began with Irving Babbit has had, Professor Mercier believes, a truly educative effect within American society, for its development has presented all the fundamental alternatives of thought. As here defined, it embraces "the efforts made in the United States to restore the conception that man is unique in nature, that he is both spirit and matter, so that he cannot be the product of a purely material evolution" (pp. v-vi). What Professor Mercier attempts to do is to trace the internal logical pro gression of the humanist discussion through the "comparative criticism" of the thought of several participants. After an introductory chapter which provides definitions and historical perspective, there is an analysis of the legacy of Babbitt, who became a humanist through contact with the earlier comparable French movement, and who found in Buddhism a distinction between the higher and lower activities of man which he considered empirically verifiable, and through which he hoped to recall his compatriots to a dualistic position with out provoking an eruption of their deeper metaphysical and theological differ ences. Robert Hutchins, seeking his education after having gone to school, recovered the need for metaphysics, denied by naturalists, and Walter Lippmann, coming to a belief in an immortal soul and a personal God which he had not found at Harvard, recovered the need of theism. The next step would lead to what Mercier calls theistic integral humanism, based not only upon a belief in God but also upon a recognition of the need for His constant help, even within the natural order. So Lynn Harold Hough, working out the promise of dualistic humanism, presents it in its Christian form. In Hough and in Babbitt's disciple, Paul Elmer More, may be seen the transition to a full Christocentric supernaturalized humanism, which can be known only through divine revelation as taught by the Church. Three final chapters deal with the educational ap plications of dualistic humanism in the reform at St. John's College, in the critique of Norman Foerster, and with the relevance of the concept for interfaith co-operation. The merit of this book lies in its clear presentation of the premises of dualistic</page><page sequence="32">BRIEF NOTICES 103 humanism; in its framing of the status questionis for further humanistic de velopment in this country; and, not least, in its character as a document for the study of the movement, insofar as the author himself has been identified with humanist circles and is able at several points to supply interpretations based upon his own association with Babbitt or his intimate knowledge of the French literature. Unfortunately, the compelling logic of the position presented in this account is not yet embodied in more than a nascent intellectual movement, and on the plane of social action the humanitarian naturalists still dominate the scene. (C. Joseph Nuesse) Milhollen, Hirst D. and Milton Kaplan. Presidents on Parade. With a Foreword by Luther H. Evans, Librarian of Congress. (New York: Macmillan Co. 1948. Pp. 425. $7.50.) The authors of this book have endeavoured to tell the story of our chief executives by using the relatively untouched mass of pictorial material relating to the Presidents. Hirst D. Milhollen, Curator of the Photographic Collection in the Library of Congress, and Milton Kaplan, Cataloguer of Historical Prints there, have assembled an album of prints and photographs. It is a timely publi cation which supplements the usual method of teaching United States' history by linking national issues and events with the men in the White House. It appeals to the pride Americans justly take in the almost fabulous account of their Presidents. Obviously the task before the authors was one of selection. A number of pages is devoted to every President with the usual arrangement showing his place of birth, his wife, his cabinet, some indication of his term in office, his death and burial. The legend beneath the pictures is purposely an "unbiased factual presentation" of the record. The wisdom of this may be questioned. Although as a nation we have a great esteem for the highest office in the land we have not thereby precluded an evaluation of the men who held it. How ever, this is not the serious defect of the book. In choosing the pictures the authors have not given us the history they claim. Strangely enough this is especially true of the later periods of national life. It is true that as the material became more abundant the job was more difficult. But developing photography certainly captured something of the role of the President in the problem of the vital issues of the day, a feat which the reproduced wood-cuts and early lithographs undoubtedly accomplish. How can one devote twenty pages to the second Roosevelt and never include a picture related to a single domestic issue of his more than twelve years in the presidency? A glance at the photographs of Herbert Hoover gives the distorted conclusion that after his inauguration he formed a cabinet and went to a baseball game! This heralded history unfortunately serves only to demonstrate pictorially that a chief executive was born, became President, and later died. But Americans know that their Presidents are also the heads of their political parties, and when they elect a man to the presidency they do not remove him from national life. The book has some merits. It is attractively arranged and printed. Some lovely old lithographs and engravings are collected, and a few cherished bits of</page><page sequence="33">104 BRIEF NOTICES manuscript are reproduced (pp. 42, 208). It is an indication of what might be done with a rich historical source. (Joseph L. Powers) Miller, Raymond J., C.SS.R. Forty Years After. Pius XI and the Social Order. A Commentory. (St. Paul: Radio Replies Press. 1948. Pp. xvi, 328. $2.75.) Quadragesimo Anno is probably the most widely known papal encyclical of modern times. It has become the bible of Catholic social scientists and as such the object of a great deal of study and research among Catholics and non Catholics alike. Father Miller now adds fifteen years of his own labors to the efforts of other students who have tried to make this papal letter intelligi ble to an American audience. The first purpose of the book is to explain some of the background of the encyclical itself. The author points out by name the men who influenced the Holy Father in the writing of the encyclical. He discloses the reasons why Pope Pius XI centered his attention on certain matters rather than others. The most important contribution of the volume, however, is the attempt of Father Miller to apply the papal principles to American conditions and institu tions. He discusses modern industrial conditions in the light of the 1931 state ments of the Pontiff, and on the whole he does a good job of it. His commentary is interlinear. He takes up each section of the encyclical paragraph by paragraph and beneath each papal statement he inserts his own commentary. This method is peculiarly adapted to teaching the encyclicals by word of mouth, although it is not without its disadvantages in book-writing. The great danger is that the over-all story of the encyclical will be lost in a mass of minute detail. However, the index is rather complete and enables the student to ferret out corollory subjects. Every student of the social teaching of the Church should possess a copy of the book. It will not satisfy him in all respects. What book could? His treatment of the closed and union shop leaves something to be desired, and he completely neglects the finer ethical aspects of picketing and boycotting. Nonetheless, Father Miller has made a real contribution to encyclical literature. (George A. Kelly) Millington, Herbert. American Diplomacy and the War of the Pacific. (New York: Columbia University Press. 1948. Pp. 172. $2.50.) In 1831 the Pacific litoral of Bolivia?hitherto a vast desert without boundary demarcation and held as Chilean in its southern section?suddenly captured the imagination of European importers. The valuable guano had been discovered in large and easily worked deposits, and its nitrate content proved a boon to agri culture and to the manufacture of gunpowder. Both Bolivia and Chile ex ploited the find, the former by granting concessions, the latter by a large mi gration of workers who soon gave their native character to the new settlements, and thus built an extension of Chilean territory. In no time at all the inter national rivalry thus begotten led to war, the so-called War of the Pacific (1879-1883) between Chile and the allies, Bolivia and Peru. Lima was oc</page><page sequence="34">BRIEF NOTICES 105 cupied in January, 1881, the Peruvian government put to flight and overwhelmed by internal revolution, and the regime at Sucre unable to fight against a unified and inspired enemy. The Treaty of Ancon, signed in Lima on October 20, 1883, yielded Tarapaca to Chile and gave her occupation of Tacna-Arica for ten years until a plebescite would settle the right of possession. This episode offers a splendid subject for the historian and political scientist. How did it affect the growth of the Monroe Doctrine? How did the prevalent Latin American notion of "absolute sovereignty," as against acquired national rights, influence the decision to take up arms? What part had European powers in the venture? Lastly, and this is the asserted topic of the study, what part did the American people think it just to play in the settlement? (By "American" the author refers to the United States.) The book is all trees and no woods, and the trees somewhat bare. The skeleton of the story is there, in the reported words and actions of our rather inept representatives on the spot. Background knowledge of Latin American life gets meager attention. United States back ground appears a vacuum from its total neglect in the composition. Scholarly apparatus and editorial care fail to meet ordinary standards. Gibbs, our 1879 minister in Bolivia, is cited as authority for the view that the "feeling of ill will goes back for generations, the Peruvians looking upon the Chileans with contempt during colonial times." The translations of documents, a necessary adjunct of the presentation, are taken avowedly from secondary sources, (cf. p. 147.) Dashes replace dots for omissions in quotation, particularly in the chapter on "Pugilistic Diplomacy." For the topic sentence of the book one has to read to the bottom of page 38. On page 131, note 19 cites a letter of Novem ber 13, 1882, as published on January 4, 1882/ Other confusions betray a hurry in revision and proof-reading that spoils what might have become a first-rate essay in our inter-American relations. The utility of the work will be limited to reference. (W. Eugene Shiels) Moreau, E. de, S.J., J. Deharveng, and A. de Ghellinck, S.J. Circonscrip tions eccl?siastique. Chapitres, abbayes, couvents en Belgique avant 1559. [Histoire de l'?glise en Belgique, Tome Compl?mentaire I, Texte; Cartes.] (Bruxelles : L'?dition Universelle. 1948. Pp. vi, 520.) P?re de Moreau is writing a six-volume history of the Church in Belgium. The first two volumes were reviewed here in the issue of July, 1948. Two more have appeared bringing the work to 1555. This is a rich side-dish to the four volumes. Religious foundations before 1559 are identified and localized. Canon Deharveng gives the geographical limits of dioceses, archdeaconries, deaneries, and the 3,500 parishes and chapels. De Moreau does the same for chapters, abbeys, priories, and convents. Pertinent bibliography is present and there is a valuable listing of documents, both unedited and published, the life-hobby of Canon Deharveng. Four large detached maps leave one in admiration. They are the drawings of A. de Ghellinck and were executed by the Institut G?ogra phique Militaire. De Moreau continues to find, even to the pressmen, precision fired collaborators. La Fondation Universitaire did well to subsidize them. (Charles H. Lynch)</page><page sequence="35">106 BRIEF NOTICES Murray, Paul. The Whig Party in Georgia, 1825-1853. [James Sprunt Studies in History and Political Science. Volume XXIX.] (Chapel Hill : Uni versity of North Carolina Press. 1948. Pp. vii, 219. $1.25.) In this doctoral dissertation from the University of North Carolina Mr. Murray offers us "the historical development of the Troup-States Rights-Whig party in Georgia along parallel lines of personnel, organization, and principle" (p. 177). No one can deny that the author fulfills his aim in a scholarly and painstaking way. Murray has done his work well, tracing the formative years of the party under the guidance of Governor George M. Troup, its early successes and defeats, its espousal of the states rights policy, the alliance with the National Whig Party, its dominance in the 1840's, and its collapse in 1853. In a meticu lous fashion the Whig Party's influence and activities are delineated in every Georgia election of the period. But if it is not a dull story, it is at best very restricted in its appeal. In this book a thirty years' collection of fiery political battlers has been embalmed with their battles, all in the name of political science. The result is that Georgia's ante-bellum ballot-box heroes are just so many names in election tabulations and mid-term maneuverings. The last chapter is definitely the best, for interest perks up when the author deviates from his routine to assay the correlation of Georgia's economic and geographic elements with the political issues, making full use of several maps of the counties. Dr. Murray deserves high praise for the fine documentation of his material and his extensive use of contemporary newspapers. The bibliog raphy lists, though not very extensive (pp. 207-213), are well classified. It struck this reviewer that Murray's preface was faulty, for it is really nothing more than a list of acknowledgments. On the other hand, the functions of a preface are despatched by the very brief first chapter of three pages which is entitled "By Way of Definition." Fearing, perhaps, that the preface might be overlooked, the author may have incorporated the important introductory notions into the body of the dissertation for safety's sake. A few printing mistakes were noticeable, but they were inconsequential. This competent dissertation should prove of value to those interested in specialized research about Georgia's politics of a century ago. Otherwise its appeal is limited by the aim set forth in its title. (Andrew H. Skeabeck) Northrop, F. S, C. The Logic of the Sciences and the Humanities. (New York: Macmillan Co. 1947. Pp. xiv, 402. $4.50.) Scientific inquiry, according to Northrop, involves three states. The first is the analysis of the problem. This is exceedingly important, for it is a mark of genius to be able to strip away non-essentials and grasp the precise point at issue. The natural history stage of inquiry follows in which data are observed, described, and classified. "The important thing to note is that the second stage of inquiry begins with immediately apprehended fact and ends with described fact." Finally, there comes the stage of deductively formulated theory. It is a question of a deductive theory, i.e., a theory which begins with undefined terms and unproved postulates from which further propositions, called "theorems," are deduced. Such a theory, in itself, adds nothing to empirical science;</page><page sequence="36">BRIEF NOTICES 107 but it may be possible to establish one-to-one correspondences?Northrop calls them "epistemic correlations"?between the terms and propositions of the deductively formulated theory and the terms and propositions formulated in ductively during the natural history stage of inquiry. In this case the deductive theory takes on meaning. It binds the empirically discovered facts into a logical whole. However, not all the terms of the deductive theory need have their empirical correlates. Physical theory talks of electrons, but no one has ever seen an electron. These, in Northrop's terminology, are "concepts by postu lation." They are entities which must be postulated in order to give a logically consistent account of reality. Concepts by postulation play an enormous role in science. The scientist, who is popularly supposed to concentrate on cold, observable facts is actually more interested in entities which he never has observed and never will. About two-thirds of the book is given over to the application of this doc trine to problems in the various physical, biological, and social sciences. In some of these applications Northrop is not convincing. He is least convincing when he discusses the normative problems of the science and the problem of body and mind. All in all, however, his contribution to the growing literature on the logic of science is fruitful and interesting. (Paul Hanly F?rfey) Palmer, Robert R., Bell I. Wiley, and William R. Keast: The Procure ment and Training of Ground Combat Troops. United States Army in World War II: The Army Ground Forces. (Washington: Historical Division, De partment of the Army. 1948. Pp. xi, 696. $4.50.) It should now be well known to the historical profession that various "history offices" in the Army, the Navy, and the Marine Corps have been at work on "official war histories." Only a small proportion of the Navy's historical record is expected to be published while that of the Army may eventually reach ninety odd volumes. The second of these to appear deals with the manpower problems and training activities of troops that fought on the ground. Historians will be interested in it for several reasons : to discover whether it is "true history" or "official history," and to use it in scaling down the dimensions of the war ad ministration to a size which a single mind can grasp. All potential readers may quickly be assured that this is indeed "true history." Our armed forces are not repeating the mistake of the Prussian general staff in preparing its patriotic history of the Franco-Prussian War. There is, per haps, a less critical viewpoint than one might wish for, and though the his torians' own conclusions are presented, they are often brief. Yet mistakes of judgment are not glossed over nor are the chief figures in the training of the ground forces glorified. The narrative is much less like a history than what is generally known in Washington as a "report." Except for the chapters in which Professor Palmer has had a hand the framework of the source material and the cumbersome jargon of officialdom stands out much too sharply. Some subtle hand should have gone over the whole text suppressing such crudities as "quantitative crisis" and "effective volume of the replacement stream." And by pinpointing every vagary</page><page sequence="37">108 BRIEF NOTICES of administrative policy the historians may have raised a monument to their industry but they have certainly taxed their reader's endurance. Notwithstanding these shortcomings the diligent reader will emerge with a good idea of the major problems of getting and training the manpower for a ground army. These sober warriors now have a fitting testament to their girding for battle. (William O. Shanahan) Perkins, Dexter. The United States and the Caribbean. (Cambridge: Harvard University Press. 1947. Pp. xii, 253. $3.00.) The distinguished author of four books on the Monroe Doctrine climaxes his research on affairs in the Western Hemisphere with a penetrating and compre hensive analysis of the neglected yet strategically important Caribbean republics of the Americas. The contribution is especially valuable in view of the growing importance of hemispheric solidarity to the current vital policies of the United States as a world power. An evaluation of the people in the areas first settled by Europeans in contrast to the rapid advancement of other Latin-American states and of our own country was long overdue. After studying this easy-to read, authoritative, and well-proportioned interpretation both the casual reader and the scholar will appreciate better the progress made by what educators and journalists have taught and thought were economically backward, politically fallow, and socially decadent areas of the Western Hemisphere. The initial in fluences of Spanish, French, and Dutch colonization do not appear to have been liabilities to be tolerated now as unredeemable slums of the world. While the Caribbean republics pose many complex and seemingly insolvable problems they are not the greatest threat to hemispheric solidarity, nor yet to world progress. The nine chapters of the book present a balanced study of each republic and at the same time leave a soundly integrated picture of them as a group on one of the most strategic highways of the world. No effort is spared to depict realistically the social implications in the life pattern of people whose existence is made precarious by over-population, mal-distribution of wealth, and the lack of proper means of education. A re-orientation of American attitudes through a practical and dynamic good neighbor policy is one of the highlights of the book. Nor is the all important psychological factor in the relations of people in domestic and foreign affairs overlooked. The problems of the Catholic Church are frankly propounded. Catholics will be dismayed by the facts regarding the dearth of priests to minister to the spirit ual needs of the people in completely Catholic states, but they will be heartened by the author's steadfast assertion that Catholicism is a bulwark against com munism and the sole reason why the suggested remedy of birth-control, advocated as a means to solve the over-population problem, has made such little progress. The book is not weighed down by a plethora of footnoted references and addenda. Evidently it was designed for popular consumption as part of the Foreign Library. The reputation of the author for singular objectivity and thor oughness as a scholar and the presence of a comprehensive bibliography make it an authoritative study for the student as well. (Edward J. Eggl)</page><page sequence="38">BRIEF NOTICES 109 Pingel, Martha M. An American Utilitarian: Richard Hildreth as a Philosopher. (New York: Columbia University Press. 1948. Pp. xi, 214. $3.00.) A reviewer would like to say something pleasant about a book, but the utilitarian has "two strikes" against him to start with. Richard Hildreth was truly a utilitarian in whose favor two things can be granted : his style was much more readable than the laborious prose of his prototype, Bentham, and it was to his credit that he was a contemporary of some of the greatest minds of this country, with whom he tangled in view of their divergent philosophies. He deserves credit for pointing out the error of "English economists" of grouping "under the single term Labor" the "six elements of production" and then "declaring Labor to be the sole element of production," as they did (p. 54). In the theory of taste there is hardly a page on which some question does not arise which one would like to ask Hildreth. Certainly, I cannot accept his definition of religion given to Andrews Norton: "Religion in its true and vital sense, is a matter of feeling, which feeling leads to knowledge" (p. 135). There are too many other things to mention which cannot be accepted. On the other hand, his toleration is to be commended. Though he was fearful of Popery, he saw Orestes Brownson's conversion as much more logical than the action of the Unitarians and his defense of the Catholics in answer to the Native Americans surely was tolerant. The enthusiasm of Miss Pingel, the editor of the original works in this volume, is natural. One can hardly study a man's work thoroughly without developing a modicum of enthusiasm for the subject. While we cannot share that enthusiasm we heartily commend her for having made available to students of the most interesting period of America's social culture the more obscure works of a man who represented a definite element in this social growth. (Cletus Dirksen) Quigley, Martin Jr. Magic Shadows, The Story of the Origin of Motion Pictures. (Washington : Georgetown University Press. 1948. Pp.191. $3.50.) Magic Shadows records the story of the progress which made possible enter tainment and educational motion pictures. It is essentially the pre-history of the motion picture. It puts an end to the widely accepted belief that Thomas Edison and his contemporaries in the second half of the nineteenth century in vented the motion picture. This study shows that the instinctive urge to create pictures in living reality dates all the way back to Adam. After vague beginnings in ancient Babylonia, Egypt, and the Far East, the study of light and shadow started in a more thor ough way with Aristotle and Archimedes in Greece and with Alhazen, an Arab. Thereafter the scene of progress centered almost entirely in England and con tinental Europe. Roger Bacon, the English monk of the thirteenth century, studied magic shadows and devices to create them. In Renaissance Italy, Leonardo da Vinci wrote the first accurate description of the "camera oscura" or the "pin-hole" camera, while the inventions of other Italians advanced the magic shadow art still further. Just after the middle of the sixteenth century, Porta, a young Neapolitan, produced light and shadow plays with true enter</page><page sequence="39">110 BRIEF NOTICES tainment values. Even the great astronomer, Kepler, applied magic shadows to the stars of the heavens. But it was left for Father Athanasius Kircher, a Ger man Jesuit, actually to project the first still pictures in Rome in 1646, although some of his contemporaries suspected that he dabbled in the "black arts." After reviewing a distinguished group of men?Schott, Milliet de Chales, Zahn, Molyneux?each of whom added something to still picture showings, Magic Shadows describes the gradual solution of the challenging problem of introducing the element of motion into the projected picture. In 1736 Musschen broek, a Dutch natural philosopher and mathematician, was the first to achieve success in handling this problem. Still later the inventions of John Ayrton Paris, John Antoine Plateau, Simon Ritter von Stampfer, and Franz von Uchatius all helped the projection of pictures in motion. Finally, the work of Edison, Muy bridge, Armat, the Lathams, and many others in the last half of the nineteenth century carried the story to its essential completion. By 1896 screen projection of motion pictures had become a commercial reality, and the magic shadow art was destined to become the greatest entertainment medium ever known. The writing of such a volume required, on the part of the author, a great enthusiasm for a difficult subject and an extraordinary background knowledge in the field of motion pictures. His critical acumen, lucid style, and lively sense of humor enabled an objective, clear, and attractive presentation of the results of his extensive research which was carried on intermittently for several years in the archives in Europe and America. Mr. Quigley is especially qualified to undertake the production of a work of this kind. He has been associated with the motion picture ever since he joined the editorial staff of the Motion Picture Herald in 1939. At present he is associate editor of the Motion Picture Herald and the Motion Picture Daily. Particular attention is called to the two valuable appendices. The first ap pendix contains a descriptive chronology of the significant developments in the pre-history of the motion picture from Adam to Edison. The second consists mainly of a bibliography of some of the primary sources and secondary works used by the author, arranged according to the chapters of the book. This bibliography proves very useful since the volume is not annotated. Teachers of the social sciences will find Magic Shadows a source of not only much scholarly information but also of considerable enjoyment. (Helen F. Toohey) Rambaud, Louis, O.P., Dollfuss, 1892-1934. (Paris: Emmanuel Vitte, Edi teur. 1948. Pp. 258.) Engelbert Dollfuss, late Chancelier of Austria, has found a distinguished and eloquent biographer in France. Father Louis Rambaud betook himself to Austria in 1946 to gather data about his hero and to hear the judgments of those who had known the chancellor as friends or adversaries. The result is this story of a poor peasant's son who fought his way up to become the political leader and first minister of his country. In this position he averted the economic collapse of the nation, replaced a self-dissolving parliamentary regime by a "Christian, corporate state," conquered a Marxist revolt and died as a "martyr of patriotism" for the independent Austria he defended against Hitler's</page><page sequence="40">BRIEF NOTICES 111 assaults. The nazi conspirators hit the Austrian leader, not his work, at that time. The author rightly stresses two basic features of Dollfuss' character: his deep Catholic faith and his close connection with the soil and the people from which he sprang. This was the secret of his influence on the masses, particularly on the rural population. Rambaud refutes the often heard fiction that Dollfuss had directed artillery against unprotected workers' dwellings, whereas those giant buildings constructed by the socialist city administration of Vienna were disguised fortresses, well-prepared for civil war. Dollfuss' authori tarian, but never totalitarian, rule appears justified by the emergency of the Austrian state. The Austrian constitution of 1934 was not fascist, for it was founded on Christian principles. (Peter Berger) Riker, Thad W. A History of Modern Europe. (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. 1948. Pp. xiii, 835. $6.75.) As stated in the author's preface, this work is a revision and elaboration of an earlier work, A Short History of Modern Europe, published in 1935. The author concerns himself in the present work with the growth of institutions and trends that characterize modern Europe. This major portion of the work is introduced by a chapter titled, "The Coming of the Modern Age," in which, for purposes of orientation, he makes what he terms "an excursion far back into the Middle Ages." Instead of a strictly chronological treatment of the matter directly pertinent to the history of modern Europe from the Religious Revolt to the present day, the divisions are based on three major eras: that of National Consolidation, of Revolution, and the Dynamic Era. The reader is prepared for a purely secularistic presentation of the subject matter by the author's admission of giving "little attention to arts and letters, . . . the place of tastes, habits, and religion in modern life." In the treatment of the Middle Ages, such statements as "Those who possessed learning held the individual in bondage to a spiritual conception" (p. 4) ; "Intellect and conscience seemed to be equally in harness" (p. 5) ; and others in the same vein indicate an outmoded interpretation of the period, and are certainly not representative of the best scholarship. The Religious Revolt is described in the traditional Protestant version as a movement to reform the religious life of Christendom. Here and there are misleading statements such as : "The papacy publicly applauded the incident" as a conclusion to an explana tion of the Massacre of St. Bartholomew's Day. (p. 52, n. 36) The Church, on the whole, seems to be treated as merely another political institution, with no understanding much less appreciation of its divine mission. Approximately half the book is devoted to the period since 1870; the reader is inclined to apply here an observation of Toynbee referring to contemporary history, that it is difficult to see the general aspect "because it is encumbered and obscured by a surfeit of information." Since the work is designed chiefly for college students, one appreciates the technical aids the author has provided, such as maps carefully correlated to the text, a brief outline of content at the beginning of each chapter, with appro priate paragraph captions, discussion of the definition of such terms as national ism, fascism, communism, etc., readings classified as to chapter subject matter,</page><page sequence="41">112 BRIEF NOTICES and a satisfactory index. A thoughtful reading of Professor Sorokin's The Crisis of Our Age would, perhaps, prove to be an effective antidote for the note of pessimism on which the author concludes his work. (Sister M. Perpetua Hayes) Roche, Aloysius. A Bedside Book of English Saints after 1066. (London: Burns, Oates and Washbourne; New York: Macmillan Co. 1948. Pp. vii, 127. $2.00.) Father Roche's little book has the distinctive quality of being just what it purports to be, an introduction to the lives of the saints of England after the Norman conquest. It is not complete, but gives a stimulating synopsis in very readable form of the saints and near-saints of England, principally during the reigns of the Norman and Angevin kings. It glances briefly at the martyrs of the Religious Revolt period in England, and comes down to the latest possible cause, that of Bishop Richard Challoner. Few have as easy a style of writing hagiographical literature as that of Father Roche. His unique method of grouping off a number of saints into various categories, and then showing the similarities and dissimilarities of their lives gives one a sense of the richness of the workings of God's grace in these men and women. To best appreciate the latest volume of the Bedside Books it would be a help to have read the first volume on the pre-Norman saints in England, for the author's first chapter deals with the transition in the type of saintliness in England. It picks out the characteristic of orderliness and discipline in the Norman-French character, and shows how it influenced the spirituality of these saints, particularly the bishops. However, the Anglo-Saxon and Celtic traditions of seclusion, individualism, and fierce penance were not lost. The book is hard to describe as it is a mosiac of little snatches of lives inter spersed with comments of shrewd insight into what makes "star differ from star" in the firmament of His servants. There are undoubtedly saintly lives that might have been stressed as possible canonization causes in post-Reformation times, but he has already given more than demanded by his inclusion of notes on such saintly people as Richard Rolle, Juliana of Norwich, and Henry VI (for whose French kingdom, St. Joan of Arc paid with her life). Those who read this little work will not be disappointed with what they find, and will certainly be stimulated to read more complete lives of those often little-known saints of "Mary's Dowry." (Vincent M. McDonald) Rossiter, Clinton L. Constitutional Dictatorship: Crisis Government in the Modern Democracies. (Princeton: Princeton University Press. 1948. Pp. ix, 322. $5.00.) Can constitutional government, guardian of human liberties, concentrate its powers to cope with grave crises without, in the final outcome, being transformed into lasting dictatorship? That is a momentous question for contemporary democracies, confronted as they are with economic emergency, threat of sub versive upheaval, and the menace of international conflict. This valuable his</page><page sequence="42">BRIEF NOTICES 113 torical analysis of crisis governments in democratic countries by Professor Rossiter of Cornell, may indicate an answer. The author scrutinizes the classic Roman dictatorship and, in modern times, article 48 of Germany's Weimar constitution, decree powers in France's Third Republic, Britain's cabinet dictatorship, and the emergency authority of the American presidency in historic situations of war, rebellion, and economic crisis. His optimistic conclusion is that the British, the Americans, and probably the French, have successfully preserved democracy despite interludes of "consti tutional dictatorship." Yet he fully recognizes the danger of emergency powers : "No constitutional government ever passed through a period in which emergency powers were used without undergoing some degree of permanent alteration, always in the direction of an aggrandizement of the power of the state." Added to this is the sobering thought that in this atomic age the use of crisis powers may be come the rule rather than the exception. For the future he offers eleven criteria by which to judge the propriety of resort to emergency government, and eight suggestions for the better institutionalization of American "constitutional dictatorship." The vistas here opened by Professor Rossiter should be scanned in detail by all men desirous of preserving the fruits of constitutional liberty, for it is possible that modern democracy may soon undergo its most stringent trials. In preparing to meet them it is vitally necessary to emphasize, probably more than the author has done, that the preservation of democracy through times of stress rests not so much on institutional forms but on a continuing appreciation of the essential nature of man, his dignity and destiny. (Charles R. Gellner) Rowe, William Hutchinson. The Maritime History of Maine. (New York: W. W. Norton and Co., Inc. 1948. Pp. 333. $6.00.) Contrawise to the impression given by the title, this book, as the prefatory statement reveals, is the "recounting of the rise and the decline of the wooden ship" in Maine. To this self-admitted "task," Mr. Rowe has brought a lifetime love and interest in the subject, his research experience as secretary of the Maine Historical Society for the past fifteen years, and the prior authorship of two volumes dealing with shipbuilding within his local shoreline. As the publisher's expert blending of color and design in its jacket and end papers spells promise of interesting reading, so does Mr. Rowe's introductory chapter, "Maine Coast." Easily and effectively one is acquainted with the multi-harbored, serrated coastal area which launched Maine's maritime fame. In the succeeding chapters, the yesterday life of the Maine sailing vessel is depicted. Notwithstanding a sustained and, at times, almost shipping register emphasis upon ships and their building such chapters as deal with "The King's Broad Arrow," "The War Years," "West India Trade," "The State of Maine Clippers," and "The Confederate Commerce Raiders" divulge something of the teeter board balance between shipping prosperity and depression. Moreover, the</page><page sequence="43">114 BRIEF NOTICES men who built and sailed the ships, their people, community life and thought are revealed throughout this volume. The general reader will be well rewarded in enjoyment and increased knowl edge of Maine's maritime history hitherto not covered with such comprehensive thoroughness. However, the specialist may note justifiably: a manifest in difference to the twentieth-century shipbuilding, not only of steel vessels con tributed to both World Wars, but also of those of wood launched for commercial and wartime use; an index, approximately eight-ninths of which is devoted to names of ships and persons, inadequate for detailed reference; and minor defects contained in the chapter identification of subject in the bibliography. (William G. Earles) Royer, Fanch?n. The Mexico We Found. (Milwaukee: Bruce Publishing Co. Pp. viii, 210. $2.50.) In 1945 Fanch?n Royer went to Mexico, took a house in the capital with her three young daughters, and proceeded to film three sequences in 16 mm. koda chrome as a contribution to inter-American understanding. One of these pictures dealt with the activities of Brother Pedro de Gante, early educator of the Indians after the conquest of Mexico. Another portrayed the work of Bartolom? de las Casas, O.P., in the actual, difficult terrain in which he worked. The third recreated the life of a mendicant third order Franciscan, Brother Pedro de Betancourt, who distinguished himself as a type of Cur? d'Ars in Guatemala shortly after the middle of the seventeenth century. For the latter film, which is available under the title "The Bell Ringer of Antiqua," the author took herself and company to the locale of Guatemala for an authentic background to the story. This volume details the story of her adventures, running into two years, with a number of rugged experiences en route, as well as the incidental observa tions of "one North American," in the words of the author, "who has lived and worked in these countries for protracted periods within the past eighteen years." The result is entertaining and, as the expression of an intelligent Catholic who has given herself sufficient time to savor the spirit and customs of the country, may be regarded as a helpful introduction to a country where religious faith and various institutions have been distorted in many respects for readers north of the border. The familiar descriptions of the markets, the neighbors, the problems of religious education, of the servant situation, and "spoiled" young men, are definitely authentic, as are the comments on certain aspects of Mexican official dom. Her chapter on "Anthropology Serves Evangelism" will strike a sympa thetic cord in the hearts of most Mexicans as well as of many Americans who have witnessed the strange companionships and methods of operation often in dulged by Protestant and communist missionaries south of the Rio Grande. On the other hand, this book cannot, in all fairness, be regarded as making an outstanding contribution or as filling a void in inter-American understanding. Most of its observations have been made before and are here presented without particular depth or extension which would have justified the ambitious anticipa</page><page sequence="44">BRIEF NOTICES 115 tions of the author and the publisher. The many pages devoted to little more than a description of the primitive conditions and bad luck encountered by a rather impromptu movie crew become irrelevant to a reader who has anticipated a more penetrating interpretation of Mexico. Highly personal references of the author to her estranged husband likewise offer little and may be regarded as of questionable taste in a work of this character. The book stands on its merits as a friendly, Catholic narrative and as such will appeal to the general reading public. (James A. Magner) Ryan, John K. The Reputation of St. Thomas Aquinas among English Protestant Thinkers of the Seventeenth Century. (Washington: Catholic Uni versity of America Press. 1948. Pp. ix, 126. $2.50.) In these reprints from New Scholasticism, Monsignor Ryan ably presents one phase of Catholic intellectual culture, the survival of scholasticism, and more particularly of St. Thomas, in the England of the period following the Religious Revolt. His treatment is confined to independent thinkers, preachers, controversialists, poets and philosophers, from John Donne to Milton. The place of scholasticism in the universities is not considered, although enough is said to show the need of some future research. The conclusion reached by the author is that the complete break with Catholic thought was gradual and not abrupt; England's intellectual heritage was not lost at a single stroke. Undoubtedly, many controversialists returned to the scholastics only for polemical material, yet on the other hand not a few divines actually drew doctrine and devotion from the schoolmen, especially from St. Thomas. The era was not as anti-scholastic as some histories of philosophy and culture would portray it. While it is apparent from the work that "no man could successfully take part in seventeenth-century controvery without being widely read," I am inclined to think that some knew St. Thomas more by hearsay or general reading than directly in his own works. This, and the kindred point of the accuracy of their quotations, the author might well have clarified; it is a weak point in the book. (Ignatius Brady) Sickel, Theodor von. R?mische Erinnerungen.

(Vienna: Universum Ver lagsgesellschaft M.B.H. 1947. Pp. 512.) This publication of Sickel's Roman memoirs, supplemented by a large number of letters addressed to him and of documents concerning the Austrian Historical Institute in Rome and the Vatican Library and Archives, is an important con tribution to the history of historical scholarship in the second half of the nineteenth century. Sickel (1826-1908), one of the "founding-fathers" of modern palaeography and, especially of diplomatics, pupil of the ?cole des Chartes, co-founder of the Institut f?r Oesterreichische Geschichtsforschung in Vienna (1854-1856), was a leading figure among the historians who from all European countries converged upon Rome after the opening of the Vatican Archives by</page><page sequence="45">116 BRIEF NOTICES Pope Leo XIII in 1879. The establishment in 1881 of the Austrian Historical Institute in Rome, whose founder and first director Sickel was, and the scholarly work carried on there, are the central themes of his memoirs. The story of his negotiations with Vatican and Austrian authorities and of his coping with various incidents, amusing and otherwise, which accompanied the new venture, affords interesting and at times surprising insights into the cultural conditions of Leonine Rome and the Austria of Francis Joseph. In contemplating this mirror of some noteworthy aspirations and achievements in the European "republic of scholars" of a period only two generations removed from us, one is struck by the genuine interest shown by the highest governmental authorities in truly "technical" studies which had no immediate bearing on the problems and requirements of the day. One feels with some nostalgia the cultured tone of a then still influential educated society in which even the specialist scholar in the humanities was generally recognized as more than an eccentric. On the other hand it is interesting to see how Sickel, Protestant and liberal, in spite of his repeated personal contacts with Leo XIII, Cardinal Hergenr?ther, Father Ehrle and other great ecclesiastical figures of the time? all of whom he obviously greatly respected?remained quite detached from the properly religious ends and concerns of the Catholic Church. Professor Santifaller has introduced his richly annotated edition of the memoirs and supplementary documents by a short account of Sickel's life and works. Special mention must be made of the editor's sketch (pp. 169-180) on the history and significance of the Liber diurnus which was edited by Sickel after the Vatican manuscript (cf. also Traditio, V, 386 ff.). Finally, attention is drawn to the detailed memoir on the Consultation Library of the Bibliotheca Vaticana by Father Ehrle, who as prefect and later as cardinal librarian played such an important role in its reorganization.
