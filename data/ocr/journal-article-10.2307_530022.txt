<plain_text><page sequence="1">263 Rock Art and Hunter-gatherer Archaeology: A Case Study from sw Texas and Northern Mexico Solveig A. Turpin The University of Texas at Austin Austin, Texas The pictographic sequence in the Lower Pecos River region of Texas illustrates the contribu- tion that rock art can make to the reconstruction ofprehistoric cultural systems. The indige- nous development and later introduction of mature art forms contrast markedly with the current static model of hunting and gathering adaptation to this now-arid region. Four prehistoric rock art styles and the historical pictographs are described in chronological order and in the context of archaeological remains. The difference between the perceptions ofpre- historic lifeways afforded by studies of art forms and those that concentrate on material cul- ture are attributed to the degree of constraint exerted on each subsystem by physical factors. Environmental conditions, such as the limited availability of water, the desert biotic com- munity, and the geologic distribution of rock shelters, place limits on the strategies ofsubsis- tence, technology, and settlement, the data classes most important in ecological models. Be- havioral subsystems, such as those manifested in the rock art, are more pliant, reflecting social and ideological influences that are more difficult to detect in the analysis of material culture. Introduction Hunter-gatherer parietal art is a neglected source of information on technology, subsistence, settlement pat- terns, procurement strategies, ritual, and ideology and one that is equal or superior to other classes of archaeological remains. The contribution that rock art can make to an understanding of hunting and gathering societies is best illustrated by comparing and contrasting a relative rock art sequence with a model of prehistoric adaptation de- rived from material culture. This case study draws upon a series of pictograph styles found in the Lower Pecos River region of sw Texas and northern Mexico, a defined cul- tural area surrounding the confluences of the Pecos and Devils rivers with the Rio Grande (FIG. 1). In this area, 50 years of parallel studies, one emphasizing the material culture preserved in dry rock shelters and the other a long rock art sequence, produced two quite different impres- sions of Lower Pecos prehistory. Discussion of the Problem Rock art studies have perhaps failed to gain full accep- tance for a number of reasons. A common misconception is that only the decipherable literal art, those panels that depict items recognizable to modern viewers, are archae- ologically useful. Fantastic or abstract forms are, by this line of reasoning, so beyond comprehension that their potential contribution is negated. Another common com- plaint is that rock art is undatable. Thus, even if specific elements can be interpreted, their context is imprecise. A third factor is uncollectability. Rock art forms can be pho- tographed, drawn, and described, but only imperfectly, and the motifs cannot be returned to the laboratory for detailed analysis. Fourth, rock art is often widely distrib- uted across difficult terrain, so a major investment in time and labor is required to gain an intimate familiarity with the range of variability and patterning in any single region. A fifth, and undue, criticism is more subliminal: a disdain for what is considered frivolous compared to the more serious study of material culture. Finally, what might be called the "Von Daniken" factor-the attraction rock art holds for the excessively imaginative-detracts from its serious consideration. Whatever their reason, field archaeologists, especially those working in North America, often relegate rock art studies to social anthropologists, art historians, and to a splinter group of their own discipline whom they consider specialists. The last more often apply ethnography and archaeology to their central concern, explanation of the</page><page sequence="2">264 Rock Art from Texas and Mexico/Turpin 0 40 Miles O 40 Kms , 0 3 Ozona ---- TEXAS E \ map TEXAS area (nSMEXICO LOWER PECOS LangtryE .

Over the past decade, the growing importance of rock art research is witnessed by the global forum afforded to methodological, theoret- ical, and interdisciplinary issues by respected anthropolog- ical journals and books. All but a small fraction of the world's parietal art is prehistoric or produced by nonliter- ate hunting and gathering people, placing it securely within the domain of archaeology. Thus, rock art studies could become yet another window through which hunter- gatherer archaeology contributes to general anthropolog- ical discussion (Wobst 1983: 221). Two closely-related points of contention that are often resurrected in the polemics of rock art research must be resolved in a commonsense manner before archaeological inquiry can proceed without criticism. First, there must be heuristic application of two principles of uniformitar- ianism: the belief that there are constants or universals in human behavior; and that the past can be explained by processes observable in the present (Bailey 1983: 3; Con- key 1984: 258). In the last decade, the majority of the discussions of theoretical issues in rock art research have been directed toward two geographically and chronolog- ically distinct extremes: the distant past of the European Paleolithic (e.g., Conkey 1980, 1982, 1983, 1984, 1985; Halvorson 1987; Jochim 1982; Lewis-Williams and Dow- son 1988) and the ethnographic present of Southern Af- rica (Biesele 1983; Lewis-Williams 1980, 1981, 1982, 1983, 1984a, 1984b, 1985, 1986; Wilcox 1984). Much of the world's rock art, however, is temporally somewhere between and spatially somewhere other than these two research domains. Thus, most of the analyses must be</page><page sequence="3">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 17, 1990 265 framed within a context derived largely from archaeolog- ical and physical sciences. The assumption that there are regularities and continuities in human thought and be- havior provides the link with living people, through time and across space, the reference points that permit an ex- trapolation from the known to the unknown. Secondly, the acceptance of some uniformitarian prin- ciples prepares the way for the judicious use of ethno- graphic analogy, which is essential to the analysis of rock art produced by people whose beliefs and practices must be reconstructed from the archaeological record. The key, as Lewis-Williams (1986: 235) points out, is demonstrat- ing the principle of relevance, and then perhaps only as a matter of degree. More precisely, hunters and gatherers, by definition, share a set of general characteristics beyond their mode of production, providing "multiply connected" analogs and "determining structures" that ensure to some degree that "the association between compared and im- puted characteristics is not purely accidental" (Wylie 1988: 231). Although there may be no analogues to Paleolithic cul- ture left on earth (Conkey 1983: 223; Halverson 1987: 64), all the hunting and gathering peoples of the Americas presumably descended from common stock, bringing Old World practices and ideas to the New World. Not all these traits would survive unchanged nor would they be evidenced in any one place at any one time, but radical discontinuities are equally unlikely (Wylie 1982: 42). Shamanism, for example, is pervasively asso- ciated with hunting and gathering cultures (Lewis-Wil- liams and Dowson 1988: 213) and, through the medium of ritual, is likely to be manifested in the art (Conkey 1985). The close relationship between felines and shamans noted by Lewis-Williams (1985) in San rock art and eth- nography is also apparent in modern and prehistoric South and Mesoamerica (cf. Cordy-Collins 1977; Furst 1967; Kelley 1974; Reichel-Dolmatoff 1975). The latter are more directly relevant analogues, both temporally and spatially, to the feline-shaman motifs in the Archaic rock art of the Texas-Mexico border (Turpin in press b) than is the African example where the similarity is more uni- formitarian. Alternatively, shamanism, a widely held, com- plex, and diverse set of beliefs, cannot be expected to explain all art any more than ritual is confined to the creation of rock paintings. The concerns about the validity of rock art research can best be allayed by recognizing the distinction between "learning about" and "learning from" first noted by Ins- keep (1971: 101) and reiterated by Lewis-Williams (1986: 171): "before we can learn from the art, we must first learn about it." In the past 10 years of fieldwork, much of what has been learned about and from Lower Pecos rock art is relevant to the reconstruction of its ar- chaeological and social context. Introduction to the Region The Lower Pecos River region is now an arid rangeland of rolling hills, dissected by entrenched tributaries to three major rivers: the Pecos, the Devils, and the Rio Grande (FIG. i), their flow now impounded by Lake Amistad, a reservoir owned jointly by the United States and Mexico. Some 10,000 to 12,000 years ago, Paleoindians hunted now-extinct elephant, camel, and horse, megafauna sup- ported by a savannah parkland quite different from the near-desert of today (Bement 1986; Bryant 1969; Dibble and Lorrain 1968). The onset of a trend toward aridity about 9000 years ago forced a shift to a more eclectic gathering economy, reliant on desert vegetation and small game. Rock shelters were the nucleus of an Archaic oc- cupation that endured from the end of the Pleistocene, ca. 9000 years ago, until approximately A.C. 1000. The pre- servation afforded by dry rock shelters and the arid climate has provided a massive database for the study of Archaic- age hunter-gatherer subsistence, technology, mortuary be- havior, and-in the form of elaborate pictographs-ritual, mythology, and ideology. The stratified rock shelter deposits permitted the for- mulation of a cultural chronology that was later supported by abundant radiocarbon assays. Traditionally, the prehis- toric sequence in this area has been divided into five time periods: Paleoindian (pre-9000 B.C.); Early Archaic (9000 to 6000 B.C.); Middle Archaic (6000 to 3000 B.C.); Late Archaic (3000 B.C. to A.C. 600); and Late Prehistoric (A.C. 600 to 1600). A more refined local chronology, composed of 11 periods and subperiods, has been proposed (Turpin 1988) but it is almost too specific for the vagaries of dating rock art. The more general periodization allows consid- erable leeway and can accommodate the margin of error in estimates of rock art ages. The majority of the materials recovered from rock shel- ter excavations are well suited to the ecological/environ- mental functionalist analyses fostered by the New Arche- ology (Hodder 1982). Subsistence-related classes of material culture include well-preserved plant parts; faunal remains; coprolites; tool kits; and human teeth, bones, and naturally mummified tissue. Lithic assemblages are dominated by chipped stone implements of many styles and uses, locally procured and manufactured from abun- dant natural chert sources. Bedrock and ground stone mortars and grinding stones retain materials related to technological, subsistence, and artistic strategies. Wooden implements such as digging sticks, fire drills, atlatls, throw-</page><page sequence="4">266 Rock Art from Texas and Mexico/Turpin ing sticks, and snares are often preserved. The fiber in- dustry is well represented by sandals, matting, cordage, and baskets, manufactured from desert succulents such as lecheguilla, sotol, and yucca (Andrews and Adovasio 1980). At different times, mortuary practices ranged from disposal of corpses in natural subterranean caverns and sinkholes to bundled primary interments in rock shelter deposits or cairn burials on high promontories (Turpin 1988). Portable art consists of a few unfired pinched clay fig- urines (Shafer 1975; Shafter and Speck 1974); painted geometric designs on mats and baskets; an occasional painted bone or shell; incised stone, bone or wood items; shell and bone beads and pendants; and a number of smooth river pebbles painted with enigmatic geometric and anthropomorphic designs (Parsons 1986). The tool kit used in the production of parietal and portable art includes mortars, pestles, shell palettes, brushes, crayons, pencils, and needles for tatooing. All the pigments iden- tified to date are easily obtained, naturally occurring min- erals such as hematite, limonite, and manganese dioxide, but the binders, if any, are unknown. The dominant interpretation of the Lower Pecos cul- ture, which I call the static Archaic continuum model' (Turpin 1986c), is derived largely from the analysis of artifact classes recovered from rock shelter deposits. In this model, rigorous environmental conditions, the lack of attractive resources, isolation from major routes of dif- fusion and trade, and the early achievement of a primary desert efficiency (cf. Caldwell 1958) conjoined to sustain a monotonic adaptation that endured from the end of the Pleistocene until Spanish contact, ca. A.C. 1600 (Johnson 1967). In a sense, this model is a historical artifact, en- gendered by the course of the first four decades of ar- chaeological research in this region. Lower Pecos Archaeology: The First 40 Years Not surprisingly, the course of research in the Lower Pecos region paralleled general trends in North American archaeology, beginning with antiquarianism and culmi- nating in ecological functionalism (Hodder 1982). The acquisition of specimens for museum collections first brought several large institutions to the Lower Pecos in the 1930s. Drawn to the abundance of normally perisha- ble items of material culture, the Smithsonian Institution, the University of Texas, and the Witte Museum of San Antonio sponsored extensive excavations at several sites, discarding poorly preserved or mundane items but amass- ing thousands of specimens that have subsequently been inventoried or reanalyzed. After a wartime hiatus, large-scale archaeological studies resumed in the late 1950s. The impending construction of Amistad Reservoir (originally "Diablo Reservoir") prompted survey of the inundation basin to select sites for testing, excavation, or, in the case of pictographs, intensive recording (Graham and Davis 1958). By defi- nition, this survey was oriented toward the riverine envi- ronment, recording rock shelters, rock art panels, and a very few open campsites. The last are largely burned rock middens on the floodplain and immediately adjacent trib- utaries. The limited range of site types in this inventory contributed to the construction of the static model (Mar- maduke 1978). The subsequent excavations sponsored by the Amistad salvage program were, with the exception of two Paleoindian kill sites, again Archaic-age rock shelters or terrace sites with deep, stratified deposits-the accu- mulated domestic refuse of millennia. Climatic reconstructions, based on pollen, macroflora, and faunal remains recovered from rock shelters, propose a gradual yet steady desiccation of the region, broken only by one mesic interlude about 2600 years ago (Bryant 1969; Bryant and Shafer 1977; Story and Bryant 1966). Increased grass and pine pollen levels (Bryant 1969), more frequent but lower level flooding of the Pecos River (Pat- ton and Dibble 1982), and the resumption of mass bison kills at Bonfire Shelter after a 7500-year hiatus (Dibble and Lorrain 1968) indicate that the grasslands of the Great Plains expanded into the Lower Pecos during the Late Archaic period, ca. 3000 to 2500 years ago. Based on changes in projectile point styles, Dibble (Dibble and Lor- rain 1968) hypothesized that Plains or Central Texas- based people occupied the region during this period, but proponents of the static model view this interlude as a minor fluctuation in the continuum of Archaic adaptation. Thin veneers of cultural material in some rock shelters were considered the sole evidence for Late Prehistoric period populations who differed from their predecessors only technologically, through the acquisition of the bow after A.C. 600. Two seminal publications on North American archae- ology markedly affected the interpretations of the salvage program excavations. Jennings' (1957) initial explication of the Desert Archaic seemed most appropriate to the Lower Pecos, both environmentally and culturally. The perception of the Lower Pecos near-desert as barren and 1. The static Archaic continuum is shorthand for a number of de- scriptive terms, including static (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967: 40), continuum (Shafer 1976: 5; Shafer and Holloway 1977: 103), unchang- ing lifeways, and persistent adaptation (Shafer 1980: 109; Shafer and Bryant 1977: 10).</page><page sequence="5">Journal of Field Archaeologyl/Vol. 17, 1990 267 devoid of bountiful resources found justification in the statement that "the Desert Archaic will be found wherever life is hard, and full exploitation of the environment is required for survival" (Jennings 1957: 284). Little atten- tion was paid to the corollary: '"The lack of artistic devel- opment [in the Great Basin] and of leisure time for elab- orate games seems to re-inforce an earlier interpretation that there was little leisure and a relatively bleak emotional life" (Jennings 1957: 284). Shortly thereafter, Taylor (1964) attempted to account for cultural conservatism in prehistoric and early historical Coahuiltecan settlement patterns, setting forth his thesis of tethered nomadism. In Taylor's model, the dispersed and isolated water sources of the northern Mexican desert caused proprietary control to be exerted to ensure that nomadic groups had access to water. A balance had to be maintained between the two determinants of settlement: the water of the valley floor and the vegetal resources of the slopes or monte. Taylor extended the settlement pattern of the historical people to the culturally and biologically unrelated prehistoric populations, and postulated a con- tinuity of cultural adaptation to environment. This, then, was the intellectual climate when, in 1967, Johnson summarized the Lower Pecos Archaic, establish- ing the precedent for the static Archaic continuum model. Johnson (1967) hypothesized that a paucity of attractive resources, distance from major routes of diffusion and trade, and adaptive efficiency could account for the lack of variability in lithic assemblages. The concept of ho- meostasis permeated subsequent research in this region, culminating in the quest for stability as the basic tenet of NSF-funded excavations of Hinds Cave by Texas A&amp;M University in the 1970s (Andrews and Adovasio 1980; Dering 1979; Lord 1984; Shafer and Bryant 1977; Shafer et al. 1975; Stock 1983; Williams-Dean 1978). In the 20 years following Johnson's initial explication, the concept of stability was applied, usually on a site- specific basis, to several classes of material culture.2 A time span of eight or nine millennia of stability was reported for such diverse traits as both the vegetal and faunal com- ponents of the diet (Alexander 1974; Dering 1979; Lord 1984; Stock 1983; Williams-Dean 1978), the fiber indus- try (Andrews and Adovasio 1980), the lithic industry (Shafer 1981; Collins 1974), settlement patterns (Mar- maduke 1978), and painted pebble designs (Parson 1986). All these authors noted what they considered to be insignificant fluctuations through time, attributing this variability to minor aspects of stylistic change (Shafer 1976: 5, 1980: 109, 1986: 71; Andrews and Adovasio 1980: 361), and underscoring the amazing persistence of adaptations (Shafer 1980: 109, 1986: xiv; Shafer and Bryant 1977: 10; Shafer and Holloway 1977: 103). This emphasis on successful ecological adaptation over the 8000- or 9000-year span of the Lower Pecos Archaic produces a perspective similar to the pseudo-utopian view of Paleolithic societies rejected by Conkey (1983: 223). Meanwhile, rock art studies, following a parallel course, were producing quite different findings. In the 1930s, two pioneers began the difficult task of recording and classi- fying Texas rock art. Forest Kirkland, a commercial drafts- man, copied 91 pictograph and petroglyph sites, 43 of them from the Lower Pecos region, before his untimely death in 1942 at the age of 49 (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967). In his notes and discussions, Kirkland (1938) rec- ognized stylistic and locational differences that he attri- buted to different ethnic groups, naming them the Val Verde Dry Shelter and Val Verde Flooded Shelter cul- tures. Simultaneously, A. T. Jackson was compiling photo- graphs, sketches, and descriptions of 195 rock art sites, 35 of them in the Lower Pecos region, publishing his compendium The Picture Writing of Texas Indians in 1938. Although Jackson's work was more of an attribute analy- sis, he occasionally noted affinities between regions in Texas and the Plains or Greater Southwest. After World War II, Herbert Taylor (1949) attempted to produce a chronology for the area surrounding the mouth of the Pecos, borrowing from the sequence originally defined for the Big Bend region of Texas. His was the first venture into Coahuila, where he recorded five pictograph sites near the Rio Grande (Taylor 1948). The resurgence of rock art studies was prompted by the planned impoundment of Amistad Reservoir. Of the 181 sites recorded on the Texas side of the Rio Grande during the Amistad survey (Graham and Davis 1958), 49 were rock art panels, many previously documented by Kirkland or Jackson. Gonzalez Rul and Walter Taylor (Taylor 1958; Taylor and Gonzalez Rul 1961) located 68 prehistoric sites on the Mexican side, but only one contained picto- graphs. Subsequently, art historical studies of major canyon sys- tems were carried out by Grieder (1965, 1966a, 1966b) and Gebhard (1960, 1965). The pictographs were pho- tographically and artistically documented, and relative se- quences were proposed. Gebhard's study area, Seminole Canyon, with its wide variety of pictograph styles, pro- vided the basis for a detailed relative chronology. Gebhard defined six categories that he called types, four of them 2. Alexander (1974: 12) did discriminate between stability of certain cultural phenomena rather than of the whole cultural system.</page><page sequence="6">268 Rock Art from Texas and Mexico/Turpin with subphases. He then ordered them chronologically, based on stylistic criteria and superimposition. He noted affinities between his Red Linear style and Kokopelli, the hunch-backed flute player of the Greater Southwest. Less precisely, he saw similarities between his Late Red Figure (now Red Monochrome) style and methods of depicting humans in western American art, postulating contact or intrusion by unknown western people, late in prehistory. Sponsored by the Texas Memorial Museum and Texas Historical Commission, Parsons continued the search for Lower Pecos pictographs through the 1960s, relocating many of Kirkland's and Jackson's sites and adding dozens more to the inventory (Texas Archeological Research Lab- oratory n.d.). In 1967, 35 years of rock art research culminated in the publication of Kirkland's complete works and accompany- ing text by W. W. Newcomb, Jr. (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967). Newcomb finalized the terminology, distinguish- ing between the Pecos River, Red Linear, and Red Mono- chrome styles, and suggested an internal development of the Pecos River style based on the evolution and increas- ing conventionalization of the dominant theme, which he named the shaman figure. Unfettered by criticisms of eth- nographic analogy, Newcomb was able to develop an idea first presented by Campbell (1958), attributing the Pecos River style to medicine or mescal bean societies and its origins to a shamanic religious system. Newcomb sum- marized the prevailing interpretation of Lower Pecos pre- history at the close of almost four decades of archaeolog- ical study: However described terminologically, it was a self-contained, inward-looking tradition, anciently adapted and committed to a relatively static existence in an unchanging world. Introduc- tion of the bow and arrow, sometime between A.D. 600 and 1000, presaged a quickening of cultural change, possibly pop- ulation movements and the end of the old tradition as such. But many of the essentials of this way of life persisted into historic times among Coahuiltecan and related groups, dis- appearing only with the subjugation and extermination of these tribes in the eighteenth and nineteenth century (Kirkland and Newcombe 1967: 40). When construction of Amistad Dam was completed in 1968, the last sites were still under excavation as the water rose, inundating several remarkable pictograph sites. Rock art research entered a period of dormancy, although rock shelter excavations proceeded through the 1970s, with Texas A&amp;M University working at Hinds Cave and The University of Texas at San Antonio at Baker Cave. The Last Decade: A Change in Emphasis A most significant finding of the last decade was Dib- ble's recognition of stone circles, commonly called tipi rings, at one large site. The accompanying artifacts dif- fered from all indigenous tool kits, resembling late pre- historic Plains bison-hunting assemblages. Dibble was also the first to note clusters of burial cairns on high prom- ontories, features more common north and west of the Lower Pecos. Based on this evidence, he defined the In- fierno Phase (Dibble 1978; see Turpin 1982 for a pub- lished account), a late prehistoric or protohistoric cultural complex intrusive from the Plains. When, in 1980, the Texas Parks and Wildlife Depart- ment began developing Seminole Canyon as a state ar- chaeological preserve, survey moved onto the canyon rims and upland areas. Many more diverse features, such as additional tipi rings, cairn burials, minor pictograph sites, burials in vertical-shaft sinkholes, and possible signal-fire locations, were recorded, confirming variability in the site inventory (Turpin 1982). The survey for additional rock art sites accelerated in the early 1980s under the sponsorship of private and Federal agencies. When the Seminole Project began, 107 pictograph and petroglyph sites were known in Val Verde County alone. Targeted survey has brought that total to over 200, a number that increases with each additional field venture. Based on this much larger sample, the Red Linear and Red Monochrome styles have been reassessed (Turpin 1984, 1986b); a new style, the Bold Line Geo- metric, defined (Turpin 1986a); and the postcontact pe- riod pictographs summarized (Turpin 1989). Lower Pecos Rock Art and Its Context The relative sequence of regional rock art styles is con- densed in Figure 2. The contribution of each defined rock art style to the understanding of Lower Pecos prehistory is outlined below. The Pecos River Style The Pecos River style, the most ancient of Lower Pecos art, is a monumental polychrome style usually considered to be religious or mythological in theme (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Newcomb 1976; Greco 1984). The cen- tral characters, the shaman figures (Kirkland and New- comb 1967), are towering, faceless anthropomorphic fig- ures, dressed in multicolored garments, and equipped with a uniform range of accessories (FIG. 3A). An atlatl and darts are often held in one hand, a fuzzy object sometimes interpreted as a prickly-pear pad pouch dangles from the other or hangs from the elbow. The figure may be headless or crowned with antlers, feline ears, radiant hair, or horns. The body is rectangular, often tapering to stubby legs on a line with the torso. Although usually posed frontally,</page><page sequence="7">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 17, 1990 269 1950 1850 - 1700 - 1200 SvAV,0A, 1000 B.C./A.D. 700 1000 1500 - i/ 2000 / 2500 Figure 2.

Scales shown in all captions are approximate. several shaman figures in profile have been identified (FIG. 3B). The shaman can be surrounded by miniature replicas of itself, sometimes inverted as if falling from the sky, or herds of deer, often pierced by spears. Undulating geo- metrics, interpreted as serpents (Kirkland 1938) or water symbols (Greco 1984), may enclose or emanate from the shaman figure. The most common animal depicted is the deer, although fish, turtles, rabbits, insects, birds, and snakes contribute to the bestiary. Only the panther, the central theme at many sites (FIG. 4), is equivalent to the shaman figure in size and majesty (Turpin in press a). Campbell (1958) suggested that the Pecos River style might have had its origins in visions induced by ingesting mescal beans, the seed of the mountain laurel (Sophora secundiflora), a flowering tree common in the deserts of sw Texas. Newcomb (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Newcomb 1976) elaborated the shamanic hypothesis, pro- posing that medicine societies ritually engaged in wall painting, making their multicolored visions permanent on the limestone "canvas" of the rock shelter walls. Mescal bean consumption produces various physiological symp- toms, such as nausea, cramps, muscle paralysis, stupor, and intoxication, but not hallucinogenic visions (Merrill 1977: 4). The dreamlike state, however, may have pre- pared the seeker for reception of culturally informed vi- sions. The thematic consistency found in sites separated by many miles of difficult terrain suggests that the paint- ings, and any inspirational visions, must have conformed to specific cultural expectations. Kelley (1974) suggested that specific attributes of the Pecos River style, such as frontally posed warriors and an emphasis on felines, were derived from Mesoamerican high cultures. Contact between the emerging civilizations of Mexico and the Archaic population of the Lower Pecos region has yet to be demonstrated by trade goods or</page><page sequence="9">Journal of Field Archaeology/Vol. 17, 1990 271 Figure 4. Leaping panthers flanking a "panther" shaman (largest feline is about 5.5 ft [1.7 m] from base of tail to tip of nose (redrawn by David G. Robinson from photographs). shared items of material culture. A more conservative view is that both areas manifested beliefs inherent in a shamanic religious tradition, generated from a common root but developed independently (Turpin in press a). This unifor- mitarian hypothesis also would explain similarities be- tween the Pecos River style and distant pictographs in Baja California and Barrier Canyon, Utah (Gebhard 1965; Schaafsma 1971). The most common of Lower Pecos styles, Pecos River pictographs are found at the majority of recorded sites, although many of the panels are reduced to remnants. Some sites contain only a few simple figures; in others, extensive overpainting testifies to repeated, possibly ritual activity by aggregating groups. Based largely on super- impositions and stylistic relationships detected in the larger panels, Gebhard (1965) divided his Pecos Style into three phases: early, middle, and late. Newcomb's (Kirk- land and Newcomb 1967) four evolutionary phases within the Pecos River style were derived from increasing styli- zation of the shaman figure. These typologies rely upon different criteria to sequence the pictographs, and the two are therefore not exactly equivalent. The consistent depiction of the atlatl and the absence of the bow and arrow imply that the Pecos River style originated and flourished during the long Archaic period, from 7000 B.c. to A.C. 600 in this region. Relative se- quencing of the different pictograph styles narrows that span from 7000 to 1000 B.C. (FIG. 2; see also Turpin in press b). Most recently, I suggested that an age of 4000 to 3000 years would be consistent with the functionalist interpretation of the Pecos River style as a response to scalar stress (Turpin in press b). Scalar stress, as defined by Johnson (1982), is information overload created by an increase in the number of participants in the decision- making process, a phenomenon usually related to popu- lation density. Ritual, a stable pathway for information flow (Cohen 1985: 108), is one means of alleviating scalar stress (Conkey 1985). Ritual art, such as the Pecos River style, is a likely correlate of aggregation. The period of highest population density, and presumably related scalar stress, within the estimated range of the Pecos River style is roughly between 2000 and 1000 B.c. Although admit- tedly speculative, this estimate provides a heuristic device for future archaeological research into Lower Pecos pop- ulation dynamics. The Pecos River style contributes to a reconstruction of prehistoric lifeways, by, I believe, demonstrating that a unified belief system, rooted in a shamanic tradition, was an organizing principle in Archaic society. Representa- tions of myth and ideology were standardized and under- stood across a large area. This standardized iconographic vocabulary, once intelligible to practitioners and viewers alike, is indicative of a level of interaction not often attri- buted to the Lower Pecos inhabitants. The impetus for the rise, florescence, and abandonment of this monumen- tal art form cannot be explained in the context of the static model. The Red Linear Style The second defined pictograph style, the Red Linear, is relatively rare. Panels in 11 sites are composed of a variety of miniature stick figures engaged in highly mobile group activities (Turpin 1984). Vignettes depicting hunting, warfare, ritual, and procession exude a vivacious energy foreign to other Lower Pecos art forms (FIG. 5). The underlying themes are, however, more solemn, reflecting concerns for basic survival in the form of conquest, hunt- ing success, and human reproduction. Based on the attributes of the one Red Linear panel copied by Kirkland, Newcomb assigned the Red Linear style to the Archaic Period, coeval with the Pecos River style. Gebhard (1965) recognized Red Linear scenes at two additional sites during his survey of Seminole Can- yon. Based on superimposition, stylistic similarities, and his identification of two hand-held objects as bows, Geb- hard related the Red Linear style to Kokopelli, the myth- ical hunch-backed flute player of the Greater Southwest, a motif dated to the period from A.C. 900 to 1400. The archers identified by Gebhard have since been destroyed by exfoliation, and none of the other 200 documented human figures hold bows. Two salient characteristics of Kokopelli, the hunched back and the flute playing, have yet to be confirmed in the Red Linear style. The Red Linear artists often incorporated extant Pecos River style figures into their compositions, a circumstance that indicates the more recent date of the Red Linear figures (FIG. 5A). Unfortunately, in the current sample, the still later styles never overlap Red Linear panels, elim- inating the possibility of bracketing its purported time</page><page sequence="10">272 Rock Art from Texas and Mexico/Turpin 0 5 cm 41VV612 C 0 5 cm 41VV324 Figure 5.

(A-C redrawn from photographic enlargements, D drawn in the field, all by David G. Robinson.) span. The archaeological record, however, does permit some speculation on the possible age of the Red Linear style. Two scenes depicting bison drives suggest that the Red Linear style may have been painted during the Late Archaic period, ca. 600 B.C. (FIG. 5B), the mesic interlude that permitted the expansion of the herds and their atten- dant hunters into the region. The relative rarity and in- ternal cohesion of Red Linear scenes are consistent with a short time span for their execution. Red Linear is the one style that treats sexuality and gender. Males are decidedly ithyphallic and females are indicated by a circle drawn in the pubic zone, by breasts, or by pregnancy (FIG. 5C). Gravid females are more com- mon in rock shelters containing occupational debris while male activities dominate the more isolated panels (FIG. 5D). This distribution and the emphasis on pregnancy and erect phalli in this style may reflect both a concern for fertility and strongly defined sex roles, appropriate in a hunting-oriented society. Despite the crudity of the stick figure drawings, the Red Linear style is the most representative of everyday activities in the life of Lower Pecos people, thus contrib- uting to our understanding of hunting strategies, social structure, ritual performances, and world view. One scene shows 17 bison running towards a crack in the shelter wall that could represent a canyon. In another, a single</page><page sequence="11">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 17, 1990 273 bison is being chased toward a geometric design by hunt- ers wielding clubs or throwing sticks (FIG. SB). Swirling masses of hunters and deer appear to represent drives into nets while in other scenes, single animals are speared. The leaders of processions, adult males wearing elabo- rate headdresses, are larger than their followers (FIG. SA). Their relative size and position at the head of a group seem to imply rank or specialized roles, but gradients in size also give a sense of direction to the march. Warfare is depicted by ithyphallic warriors brandishing spears at opponents (FIG. SA). One possible curing scene shows a seated male and recumbent patient, with a rabbit scam- pering above them. Pregnant women appear to be dancing in three different scenes found in two shelters. In one, they cavort in front of an insect-like figure reminiscent of Kokopelli's alter ego; in another, they prance at the head of a procession. In addition to the graphic illustration of everyday activ- ities in the life of Red Linear people, this miniature en- ergetic art style stands in marked contrast to the monu- mental static polychromes of the earlier Pecos River style. Environmental change is not in itself likely to effect ideo- logical change (Lewis-Williams 1984b: 246). These dif- ferences might well reflect alterations in the social order and world view far more profound than the slight shift in hunting emphasis usually ascribed to the intrusion of the bison hunters during this mesic interlude. The Red Monochrome Style Panels in the Red Monochrome style are composed of frontally posed, crude but realistic human figures, ar- ranged in horizontal bands, armed with bows and arrows, and accompanied by naturalistic animals of many species (FIG. 6). The humans stand with spread legs and upraised arms. Their fingers and toes are clearly detailed. Male genitalia are sometimes shown. When clothed, the figures wear long skirts or tunics. Although monochromatic hu- man figures are common in many rock art styles across North America, a few distinguishing traits identify the Red Monochrome style. A single line, drawn perpendic- ular to the head, is presumed to be a feather ornament. Rounded protuberances on the side of the head (FIG. 6) are so characteristic of this style that they must be a group identifier, or real attribute of the people (Turpin 1986b). An apparent preoccupation with hands and feet results in disproportionately large fingers and toes, with each digit clearly drawn. This emphasis extends to handprints, which are the most common minor motif. The natural world portrayed by the Red Monochrome artists is dominated by animal life such as deer, fish, turtles, turkeys, rabbits, cougars, and dogs. Terrestrial animals and birds are shown in profile; aquatic species are drawn in plan view as they would be seen in nature. One large deer apparently is executed in an X-ray style, a technique attri- buted to Athapaskan influence derived from the Plains (Kirkland and Newcomb 1967). Red Monochrome art is usually considered naturalistic and representational, an attempt to depict humans and animals as they appear to the artist. It is, however, static, the figures frozen as though posing for a group portrait. The compositions do permit an evaluation of aspects of the natural world that the artist considered important to portray. Despite the probable dependence on plant foods, no vegetation is shown. Although many animals are de- picted, only humans are impaled by projectiles. In the two instances where a hunter might conceivably be aiming at Figure 6.

Nos. 2261-20, 2261-50). an animal, the target is a rabbit, not a large or fierce beast. The distribution of Red Monochrome sites is instruc- tive. The first two sites copied by Kirkland are large panels, composed of 50 to 60 figures. They lie under massive overhangs, just above the canyon floor where they encircle permanent water holes. This setting prompted Kirkland to name their authors the Val Verde Flooded Shelter Culture. The majority of the scenes are, however, re- stricted to a few figures, painted under shallow overhangs with sloping and barren floors, high on canyon walls overlooking major rivers. This distribution suggests the Red Monochrome artists avoided the long-inhabited rock shelters, perhaps too recently occupied for their comfort. In the few sites where Pecos River and Red Monochrome figures coexist the latter are always superimposed, but no such evidence of the Red Monochrome style's relationship to the Red Linear style has yet been recorded. The Red Monochrome style has long been considered intrusive, brought into the Lower Pecos by nomads of the southern Plains sometime after the introduction of the bow and arrow, ca. A.C. 600 (Gebhard 1965; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Turpin 1986b). The absence of horse, bison, and other common themes in historical art, however, suggests a prehistoric age for the pictographs. The changes in art and technology, which define the Late Prehistoric period in the local chronology, are augmented by a shift to upland, open camp settlement and from shelter interments to cairn burials. The chief contribution of the Red Monochrome style, and related intrusive traits, is in demonstrating that the Lower Pecos was not completely isolated throughout pre- history. As in the preceding Late Archaic period, new ideas and practices mark a disjunction in the static Archaic con- tinuum, one that was to continue until final removal of the area's Amerinds in the 19th century. The Bold Line Geometrics The Bold Line Geometrics are, as the name implies, abstract, their literal meaning known only to the people who painted them (Turpin 1986a). The basic icono- graphic element in this style is the straight line, intersect- ing to form V, X, Y, and Z designs (FIG. 7A, B). An unusual feature is the incorporation of blank space as a design element, resulting in a pattern usually called a blan- ket design (FIG. 7A). The sole representational motif is a quadrupedal figure that bears some resemblance to an insect (FIG. 7B). This style has been identified at 17 sites where it is often commingled with the Pecos River style. Based on super- imposition and clarity, the geometric designs are later than the Pecos River style, and perhaps coeval with the Late Prehistoric Red Monochromes. Gebhard (1965), who in- cluded many of the designs now assigned to the Bold Line Geometrics in his Late Red Figure, Red Line style, con- sidered these abstracts to be late introductions to the re- gion rather than indigenous developments. Their strong similarity to abstract pictographs in northern Mexico sug- gests a southern origin for the style. Although little con- crete information is conveyed by the Bold Line style, its probable intrusive nature illustrates yet another disjunc- tion in the static Archaic continuum, perhaps caused by influences emanating from Mexico in late prehistoric times. The Historical Pictographs Traditionally, history begins in the Lower Pecos River region in 1590 when Gaspar Castafio de Sosa led his ill- fated expedition from Monclova north to the Pecos Pueb- los (Hammond and Ray 1966; Schroeder and Matson 1965). The end of the static Archaic continuum is gen- erally cited as A.c. 1600 but to date only 16 rock art sites and 1 rock shelter occupancy can securely be attributed to postcontact Native Americans (Turpin 1989). In the ab- sence of an archaeological context, the rock art is best</page><page sequence="13">Journal of FieldArchaeology/Vol. 17, 1990 275 viewed in concert with extremely limited ethnohistoric references and more general Spanish and Texan history. Painted by different artists for different reasons, the historical rock art cannot be considered a style. Postcon- tact pictographs and petroglyphs are found in the Big Bend, the Panhandle, the Lower Pecos, and northern Mexico (Cairdenas 1978; Jackson 1938; Kirkland and Newcomb 1967; Lowrance 1982, 1986; Parsons 1987; Smith 1942, 1946; Turpin 1989). Despite considerable variability in technique and style, the common thread run- ning through all the historical art is the subject matter. Favored topics include mission architecture, domestic live- stock, bison hunts, and warfare. In the few historical pictographs copied by Kirkland, Newcomb recognized an internal chronology that can be extended to the now larger sample (Turpin 1989). The earliest panels benignly treat churches, domestic animals, priests, and other Christian-related symbols (FIG. 8A). Kirkland, Newcomb, and Gebhard agreed that these sites reflect contact with an alien world, the introduction to permanent architecture, horses, cattle, and European clothing. Similarities to the Red Monochrome style sug- gest the artists were painting new experiences within a traditional medium (FIG. 8B). These sites then belong to the era of Spanish influence, from the late 16th century through the 17th century. The advent of the Plains Indians in the Lower Pecos Region is witnessed by pictographs attributable to the Ceremonial and Early Biographic styles (FIG. 8C), the latter common to the northern Plains between 1700 and 1775 (Keyser 1987). Ethnographic sources first refer to the Apache dominance of the Rio Grande after the Great Pueblo wars of the 1680s. Although it cannot be said with certainty which of the later warrior tribes to sweep down from the Plains were responsible for individual picto- graphs, their imprint is seen in mounted bison hunts, tipis with grazing horses, horses in battle armor, an increasing emphasis on firearms, and actual warfare with other In- dians, soldiers, and cowboys alike (FIG. 8C). Shields, not- ably absent from prehistoric art in this region, appear in several historical panels. The uniformed U.S. trooper in his blue coat replaces the Spanish grandee and habited missionary as the representative of white power, presum- ably after pacification began in earnest in 1849 (Turpin 1989). The distribution of historical pictographs reflects the mobile lifestyle of the mounted horse nomads. Only one is in an entrenched canyon, and it can be attributed to the early Spanish era. All the other examples are on more exposed surfaces adjacent to permanent water holes fringed by flat, grassy areas suitable for grazing horses. This change in transportation and site selection may ex- plain why substantial remains of the transients are so rarely found in rock shelter deposits. In a less tangible way, the historical pictographs cor- roborate ethnohistorical references to an environment quite different from that reconstructed for most of pre- history and in effect today (Turpin 1987). The postcontact artists painted bison hunts much like those of the Red Linear painters, but with the added technology of horse and rifle. That no archaeological evidence corroborates any dependence on bison during this time period serves as a caution to assumptions that, throughout prehistory, the Lower Pecos region maintained the near-desert con- ditions essential to the static Archaic continuum model. Learning from Rock Art This review of Lower Pecos rock art, set within its hunger-gatherer context, has shown its formal and con- textual diversity. This complexity demonstrates that learn- ing about and learning from rock art requires a dual per- spective that recognizes both literal and figurative information sets. For example, Wilcox (1984) emphasizes the aesthetic and narrative qualities in southern African rock art while Lewis-Williams (1986: 172) argues that the paintings combine real objects and events with metaphors, symbols, and hallucinations derived from the trance ex- perience. In Lewis-Williams' view, it is therefore impos- sible to distinguish between the two unless their reality is confirmed by ethnography or, for prehistoric societies, archaeology (Lewis-Williams 1984a, 1984b). The dichot- omy between the real and imaginary is even more likely to go undetected in styles, such as the Lower Pecos Red Linear, Red Monochrome, and historical period art, that do not superficially reflect as strong a relationship with shamanism as do the San and Pecos River pictographs. In addition, it is possible for any one design'to be index, sign, symbol, and icon simultaneously. The literalist perspective in the Lower Pecos is, how- ever, often supported by archaeology and remote yet rel- evant ethnography. The age of the various pictograph styles is generally assumed from the literal interpretation of the material culture shown in the art. The most obvious example is the historical art, defined by the appearance of items of European import. In addition, through the ju- dicious use of ethnography, ethnohistory, and archaeol- ogy, Keyser (1987) devised a lexicon for the interpretation of historic Plains Indian art that permits "translation" of many of their almost hieroglyphic signs and symbols, wherever painted over a broad expanse of North America from Canada to Mexico. The prehistoric Pecos River, Red Linear, and Red Monochrome styles have been roughly</page><page sequence="14">276 Rock Art from Texas and Mexico/Turpin 0' -0 4, q" C a i~ f Y1 o, O! 17J Figure 8.

Deer and bison drives commonly shown in the Red Linear style are not unrealistic within the context of the archaeological record and ethnohistorical descriptions of similar activities in Texas, northern Mexico, and the Great Plains, even if separated in time by three millennia. Ex- tending the same assumption of verisimilitude to include</page><page sequence="15">Journal ofField Archaeology/Vol. 17, 1990 277 the Red Linear dances, processions, and combat scenes does not imply that they are strictly narrative. The liter- alists may, however, be disappointed if they expect to find the elaborate multicolored garments of the Pecos River style shamans hanging on a rack in an archaeological re- pository. More valuable than the literal information conveyed by representational art are the inferences that can be derived from the figurative, symbolic, or metaphorical perspec- tives: a research strategy that Davis (1985: 8) called an- thropological materialism or the archaeology of thought. Many Lower Pecos pictographs reflect a basis in a sha- manic tradition, relying upon iconographic vocabularies far more ancient than the art (Turpin in press b). The identification of shamans, and to a lesser degree, secular leaders, has implications for social structure and organi- zation. The wide distribution of a shared iconographic vocabulary reflects the extent of a unified belief system maintained by communication on a larger scale than is normally attributed to elemental hunters and gatherers. The execution of complex, yet repetitive designs, by an aggregate in a ritual context, hints that the art may have served as an organizing principle, ratiying the social order during periods of increased complexity (Conkey 1985). Finally, the complex ideology reflected in some of the styles stands in marked contrast to the simplicity often credited to their technology, economy and, by extension, social structure. More importantly for the static Archaic continuum model, the marked changes in world view ex- pressed in theme and style imply alterations in the cultural trajectory ranging from indigenous development of a monumental art form to the advent of intrusive popula- tions. The introduction of mature styles, such as the Red Linear, Red Monochrome, Bold Line Geometrics, and Plains Biographic art, are corroborated in the archaeolog- ical or historical record and their origins must be sought outside the region. The impetus for the initiation, flores- cence, and demise of the Pecos River style can only be found if Lower Pecos prehistory is viewed as a dynamic process, not as a static Archaic continuum. I began with the premise that historically parallel studies produced two quite different perceptions of Lower Pecos prehistory. These opposing views can be reconciled by viewing them as systemic components that operated under varying degrees of constraint. The static Archaic contin- uum model was derived from aspects of material culture that are largely constrained by the environment: subsis- tence, technology, and to a lesser degree, settlement pat- terns. In addition to the limiting factor of water avail- ability, arid lands such as the Lower Pecos present a range of desert succulents and small game that mandate a broad- spectrum resource procurement pattern. This pattern is clearly reflected in the materials excavated from dry rock shelters, especially the floral, faunal, and coprolite remains. Technology adapted to the exploitation of this basic sub- sistence array will remain relatively constant as long as it is adequate to the tasks at hand. If rock shelter habitation was a cultural preference, settlement patterns will also reflect geological constraints, a factor that led to incidental preservation of the material culture of the shelter dwellers. The evidence for variability is found in the more pliant subsystems, those where behavioral diversity is influenced rather than constrained by physical factors. The most ob- vious of these is the parietal art, but variability is apparent in changes in mortuary practices, architecture, settlement patterns, and, to a lesser degree, technology. Many of the alterations in behavioral patterns, such as the fully devel- oped art styles of the Late Archaic, Late Prehistoric, and Historic periods, appear to be cultural baggage, brought into the region by intrusive populations. The Pecos River style, however, must be credited to indigenous develop- ment, and the stimulus for it sought in the archaeological record. In this case, rock art research mandates the study of social change within what is usually considered to be a traditional or conservative hunter-gatherer cultural trajec- tory, an exercise that must rely heavily on the intrinsic value of the study of style. Integrating the diverse views of Lower Pecos prehistory, however, requires reevaluation of the "intellectual heritage that ranks prehistoric economy and ecology as more ac- cessible, if not also more deterministic, than social or ideological phenomena" (Conkey 1984: 256). Recogniz- ing that elaborate ideological and ritual considerations operated to maintain prehistoric social systems is the first step toward adding interpretive dimensions that transcend the potential of material and environmental explanations of human behavior.
