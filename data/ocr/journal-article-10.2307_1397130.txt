Pp. xv + 285. 21s. This book is a translation and a commentary on two works in Sanskrit known as Jivanmukta Gita and Avadhfta Giti. These two treatises belong to the period when the minor Upanisads were developing in the history of Hinduism. These minor Upanisads are not very well known even among scholars. Consequently, this work is a significant contribution to the literature on Hinduism. Hinduism is a philosophical religion and a religious philosophy. Not being a founded religion, it does not owe allegiance to any particular set of teachers and teachings. But within its broad-based definition it includes conviction of every persuasion from purely anthropomorphic personalism to highly logical monism. Although this might be puzzling to non-Hindus, it is symbolic of the Hindu belief that reality is both immanent and transcendent. Hence, no view can be totally wrong or totally correct. It is this basic attitude that is reflected throughout Dattitreya. The two Sanskrit works that have been translated show very close affinity between the worship of a personal God and the philosophical principle of non-dual identity, which is the content of Advaita Vedanta. In any philosophy, the question of the rela- tion between God and man is a very difficult matter. The Advaita philosophy gives a solution to this problem by postulating degrees of truth and reality. Though reality is ultimately one without a second, the world of plurality cannot be ignored as illu- sion. Experience, the sole guide in these matters, cannot be ignored. So, the Advaitins maintain that the plurality of the universe is due to the limitations of the understand- ing of the human mind. Since bare identity cannot be grasped by the discursive mental faculties, the one reality is perceived as many. However, the groping toward unity and perfection, implying non-contradiction, is a constant companion of human thought. This is the reason man longs for a personal God. Such a God must be perfect, kind, merciful, and good, so as to act as a pole star for man's motivations. Thus man limits reality anthropomorphically and symbolically to a personal God. This view of Advaita is brought out forcibly by the work under review. By an analysis of the form and description of Dattitreya as given in the two works, the author shows clearly how such symbolism indicates the Advaitic identity. The author draws a very fine distinction between faith and knowledge. These two are the bones of contention between theologians and philosophers. Usually, faith is considered unquestionable, while knowledge is considered the questioning attitude of the mind. The author points out how belief or faith can be considered only as a negation of knowledge because it goes where knowledge by its very nature cannot go. Their opposition is only apparent, for faith consummates and fulfills knowledge. He points out how the word "tfraddha" (devotion) means devotion to knowledge. Such knowledge is not ordinary discursive knowledge but knowledge that leads to the realization of the nature of reality. Hence, it is pointed out that true religion must be based on such devotion. It is on these lines that the traditional Hindu religious con- cepts are explained in this book. The one great difficulty in Advaita philosophy is that it provides very little emo- tional statisfaction for the non-intellectual. So, following tradition, great Advaitins, such as Sarhikara, have conceived the non-dual reality as a limited God--I-vara. The author says that such an explanation can be misleading. In the two Gitis translated, a</page><page sequence="2">68 BOOK REVIEWS different version of the same idea is presented. It is called here samarasa (equipoised view). When man confronts the deity in everything, he is struck with wonder and the thirst to know more about this deity. This wonder leads him to investigate all the experiences of mankind. This is when man starts to philosophize. He finds that in- tellectual efforts are inadequate to provide an answer to his questions. It is at this stage that religious experience takes over. This does not deny the previous experience. On the other hand, this is the experience of samnarasa, in which truth is seen, not only as identity, but also as expressed in the world of plurality. In the chapter on the philosophy of Dattitreya, the author very succinctly explains this with reference to the two translated works and brings out their basic ideas as supporting Advaitic identity. It is regrettable, though, that a man of such high scholarship as His Highness should support the idea that the circumstances applicable to modern thought cannot apply to classic Indian thought. He also believes that Indian thought must be interpreted only by using Indian methods. This is a highly debatable point. Granting that his view is correct, we would be faced with the more fundamental problem of intercultural corm- munication. No doubt, religious experience anywhere in the world is based on supra- rational validation. As such, there is no method involved here. As soon as we begin to talk of method, we have come a long way away from any genuine religious experience. In terms of philosophy we can talk of methods. Indian philosophy is of many types. Starting with the pluralistic realism of the Nyiya, it goes all the way to the absolute nihilism of the Buddha and the uncompromising non-dualism of arihkara. All these systems make use of rational and logical methods to dispute with one another, while claiming intuitional validity for their own system. In every case, such claims have to stand the test of reason. Thus, if by modern methods His Highness means rational methods, they are abundant in Indian philosophy. The religious quest is satisfied when each man finds the supreme truth for himself in his experience. But the function of the philosopher is to make use of reason and logic to support his theories and thus make it available to everyone, including the empiricist. It is only then that it deserves the name "dars'ana" (perceived path). The author has done a commendable job in giving to the world of scholars these two little-known works of philosophy and religion. As Dr. S. Radhakrishnan said in his introduction to the book, "Those who read this book will have a rewarding ex- perience."--SARASVATI CHENNAKESAVAN, Pachaiyappa's College, Madras.</page></plain_text>
