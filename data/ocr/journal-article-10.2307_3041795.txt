You take up the pen when you are told, and write what is commanded. -Dust Tracks (212-13) The recent renaissance in critical literature on autobiography has largely focused on traditions of the genre which have been excluded from earlier canonical studies. These studies, it is ar- gued, have constructed their categories and definitions on the basis of white Western male exemplars, thereby marginalizing autobiographies, memoirs, and diaries by women and minorities. Estelle Jelinek's "Women's Autobiography and Male Tradition" represents one of the first attempts in this critical movement at defining a tradition of autobiography by women. Jelinek sees this tradition as one in which autobiographers have tended to avoid the "self-aggrandizing" strategies which may be found in the works of their male counterparts, and have often used "discon- tinuous forms" which have reflected the "fragmented, inter- rupted, and formless nature of their lives" (19). More recently, Susan Stanford Friedman counterposes to the white, Western male autobiographical tradition one of autobiographies by women and minorities in which "interpersonal relationships and community" as well as "identification of the daughter with her mother" are central to self-definition. While new definitions of autobiography from historical and the- oretical perspectives can prove useful, they cannot replace close readings as the basis for our recovery and reassessment of the contribution of minorities and women to the genre.

Elizabeth Fox-Genovese makes the important point that some African-American women authors problematize their relationship to the forces which most shape their discourse: their readers and their traditions. She argues that for authors like Zora Neale Hurston ". . . the identity of the self remains hostage to the his- tory of the collectivity. . ." ("My Statue" 70). While Susan Stan- ford Friedman posits the "collective consciousness" of marginalized autobiographers as a source of emotional and intel- lectual strength, Fox-Genovese demonstrates that collective iden- tity can also be a debilitating force. Hurston, for example, seeks to authenticate "a statue of herself," or "a public self," which is "beyond the horizon of everyday life, beyond the boundaries of her immediate community, beyond the confines of her gender" ("My Statue" 64). According to Fox-Genovese, the starting point for understand- ing the ways in which black women construct their autobio- graphical selves should be the relationship between author and reader. The tension at the heart of black women's autobiography derives in large part from the chasm between an autobiographer's Intuitive sense of herself and her attitude toward her probable readers. Imagined read- ers shape the ways in which an autobiographer constructs the narrative of her life." ("My Statue" 74)2 My analysis takes this position as a point of departure. In this paper I will focus on the way the author-reader relation- ship is constructed in Hurston's autobiography Dust Tracks on a Road. My analysis will attempt to demonstrate that the text, whose deficiencies are often pointed out, is best read as a record of the writing process as a particularized event, involving an author who is both black and female, engaged in writing for a largely white audience. This paper will attempt to show that the shifts in generic modes within the autobiography-from myth in the chapters on childhood, to the picaresque travel chapters, to the final "essay" chapters-dramatize the author's struggle to evade categoriza-</page><page sequence="3">Generic Strategies in Hurston's Dust Tracks 669 tion and reification by her constructed reader and to erect an independent, authoritative self. Each of these underlying genres -myth, the picaresque, and the essay-presents its own conception of the I and her relation to the world she inhabits. The overall progression in the narra- tive traces the protagonist's expulsion from the intimate world of childhood myth (where the self is an integral part of the all-black community into which she is born), her entry into the out- side/white world as a picaro, and her emergence as the persona of "the author" addressing her (white) audience in the final essay chapters.3 These genre shifts, I will argue, take place in response to a problem which cannot be examined in isolation from the author's relation to her readership-that of how to depict the self. The introduction of each new genre represents an attempt in the narrative to rewrite or reinscribe the self into a version of the world that empowers the subject. Each generic shift occurs at a point in the narrative at which the I of the text has been decentered in relation to her world; her attempts to resist the white authority figures who compromise her identity (by impos- ing their axiological categories on her) mirror the author's re- sponse to her readers' generic expectations. As we shall see, the patrons depicted in Dust Tracks serve as metaphors for Hurston's readers, who impose their own literary and social terms on the writer and thus necessarily interfere with her au- tonomy as a speaking subject.4 The moments in which the I of the text is driven into a new genre or mode of being create an allegory of the author's turning to different genres as a means of constructing a self independent of the categories and expecta- tions her reader brings to the reading act. The author's narrative strategies unfold on two levels. The first is that of genres-of the written self, experiencing life as alter- nately a child-goddess, a homeless picaro, and a black woman author. The second, submerged level is the metatextual narrative about "the author's" encounters with "her readers"-white pa- trons whose presence compels her either to reinscribe herself in myth or to seek empowerment in a new genre or mask. The appearance of a white character in the text is a recurrent event which brings these two levels into contact. The fictional analogues of Hurston's readers are presented in the text as white patrons such as "Godfather," "Godmother Mason," the "white ladies" who visit Zora's school, and the writer Fannie Hurst. The character Zora's strategy for survival (i.e., taking advice from and</page><page sequence="4">670 Judith Robey performing for white patrons) serves as a metaphor for the author's strategy in writing for a white audience. Ultimately, the text dramatizes the impossibility of writing an autonomous self, public or private, under the conditions that prevailed for Hurston. As we shall see, the implied author who, in writing the text, herself adopts her protagonist's picaresque survival strategy remains ensnared in this role. In the final anal- ysis, her narrative strategy (role-changing, or shifting genres) is unsuccessful at undermining the debilitating hegemony of her white readership, since her I never transcends the role of the dependent picaro. Each generic mode in the text presents its own version of the written I and her world. The early chapters inscribe the written self into a world of myth. Each of the five initial chapters-"My Birthplace," "My Folks," "I Get Born," "The Inside Search," and "Figure and Fancy"-is set in the all-black town of Eatonville, a self-contained, self-governing, legendary world displaced, by vir- tue of its unusual history and demography, from all that is "non-self' or "other" (i.e., the outside/white world). Zora's home- town is a distinct sphere in which black people take for granted their freedom of creative expression, harmoniously coexist with the natural world, and define themselves independently of the white population. Eatonville is therefore a world of mythic whole- ness-a place that is only "self and which recognizes nothing that is alien to itself. Like her entire hometown, Zora's immediate surroundings are presented in mythic terms. Her yard is depicted as a place of mythic communion where nature takes on a symbolic role in relation to the human sphere and often serves as a projection of characters' thoughts, wishes, or feelings. Trees, for example, serve as Zora's childhood companions and are also associated with her mother. In springtime "I hid out in the tall wild oats that waved like a glinty veil. I nibbled sweet oat stalks and listened to the wind soughing and sighing through the crowns of the lofty pines. I made particular friendship with one huge tree and always played about its roots" (56). In chapter 6 ("Wander- ing"), which recounts her mother's death, Zora refers to the loss of her mother metaphorically by expressing her yearning for "the loving pine" she must leave behind (95). Hurston conceives of myth as a "feminine genre" by virtue of its connection to the protagonists mother. In contrast, the picaresque is depicted as a "masculine genre": It is associated with Zora's</page><page sequence="5">Generic Strategies in Hurston's Dust Tracks 671 father (from whom she inherited her wandering bent) and with the male fictional characters with whom she identifies.5 Leaving myth for the picaresque is thus connected to a suppression of sexual identity as a means of self-empowerment. Myth places its subjects in the center of creation, and Zora's childhood is accordingly characterized by a sense of fulfillment and centeredness in existence. An abundance of food serves as a metaphor for the protagonist's emotional well-being in this child- hood idyll: "It was a common thing for us smaller children to fill the iron tea-kettle full of eggs and boil them, and lay around in the yard and eat them until we were full. Any left-over boiled eggs could always be used for missiles" (19). Zora's sense of occupying the center of the universe is indicated by such mega- lomaniac statements as these: "Our house then, was in the cen- ter of the world" (36); "Naturally, the world and the firmaments careened to one side a little so as not to inconvenience me. In fact, the universe went further than that-it was happy to break a few rules just to show me preferences" (34). Not only Zora's placement in the center of the cosmos and her intimacy with the natural order, but also the sense of time in the early chapters, suggest the world of myth. In the primordial realm of her imagination, where Zora is courted by the moon, events are presented in terms of a mythic "present" with no precise temporal location.6 Constructions such as I used to cre- ate the atmosphere of undifferentiated, non-linear time. Her birth at a time of ritual-hog-killing season-marks Zora's en- trance into the world of nature's cyclical temporality. Signifi- cantly, the death of Zora's mother and hence the "travel chapters" usher in a new sense of the flow of events: "That hour began my wanderings. Not so much in geography, but in time. Then not so much in time as in spirit" (89, emphasis added). The way the I conceives of both time and her role in a given fictional world is a function of the chronotope, or conception of time/space presented in the genre.7 A change in genre is a chronotopic change, or a shift in the depicted self's world view and self-perception. The mythic world of the early chapters in Dust Tracks presents an I in harmony with and integrated into her surroundings. The moment at which the character Zora perceives herself from the point of view of an outsider, however, marks her expulsion from myth. Thus, Zora's new perception of herself as a black girl rather than as a mythic goddess in love with anthropomorphic celestial bodies indicates that she has begun to perceive the world through the eyes of the outside/white world. (In a later</page><page sequence="6">672 Judith Robey chapter the narrative voice announces, "Jacksonville made me know I was a little colored girl" [941.) In the absence of an insider's eye to narrate that world, the black, mythic microcosm dissolves. "The road" emerges and supplants "the garden" as the prevailing narrative trope. One important aspect of the transition from myth to the picaresque in the narrative is the I's perception of herself through the eyes of white people. A visit to her school by a delegation of white women in chapter 4, "The Inside Search," compels Zora to perceive the world through the eyes of Others and therefore to reify herself in their terms. Zora realizes the benefits of fooling white people when she reads aloud for the delegation and, in response to their queries, lies that she "Loves" school. In exchange for her performance, she receives remuneration in the form of stuffed dates and preserved gin- ger, and later books and a dollar in pennies.8 This encounter in effect teaches Zora to play the picaro, or to exploit the white world that holds "the lever of power." The scrutiny of white gazes also teaches Zora to feel shame, an emotion carrying associations with the expulsion of Adam and Eve from The Garden. Zora's sudden attention to her own dusty legs, bare feet, and uncombed hair as she stands before her future benefactors marks a change in her status in the text. Realizing that these white women will perceive her as an un- kempt, rural black girl with sandspurs in her hair, she receives her initiation into the previously alien, white middle-class Welt- anschauung. In terms of the narrative and the generic modes appropriated in the text, this nascent self-consciousness marks the transformation of the written I into a generically different self- one no longer at home in the space of mythic innocence.9 In response to this perceived change in status, the increasingly decentered I attempts to reinstate herself in myth by consciously rewriting her existence. We learn about these attempts in the two final myth chapters, "The Inside Search" and "Figure and Fancy." In the former Zora embarks on her travels vicariously through bookslO and begins to write herself into myth. For example, her reading of Persephone's abduction from her mother's garden is in effect a retelling of her own "abduction" from childhood and abandonment of her mother. Also, at the end of the chapter, when her "visions" appear as a mythic explanation for the end of childhood, she casts herself as a Biblical martyr/prophet. These mythologized or valorized versions of her own biography are both empowering and tragic, as we can see from the following reflec- tions on her dismal destiny:</page><page sequence="7">Generic Strategies in Hurston's Dust Tracks 673 I was weighed down with a power I did not want. I had knowledge before its time. I knew my fate. (57) Oh, how I cried out to be just as everybody else! But the voice said No. I must go where I was sent. The weight of the commandment laid heavy and made me moody at times. (59) But even as I hoped I knew that the cup meant for my lips would not pass. (59) I stood in a world of vanished communion with my kind, which is worse than if it had never been. (59) In the final mythic chapter, "Figure and Fancy," Zora indicates once more that her foothold in myth is slipping when she be- moans the fact that nature no longer plays with her, and then asserts, "My phantasies were still fighting against the facts" (83). In an attempt to recenter her existence, she places herself in the role of creator. By organizing her own private theater underneath the house, secretly fashioning characters out of soap, string, and spools of thread, inventing scenarios, and performing every role, Zora recreates the world through her imagination and in effect casts herself as a playwright, puppet maker, and puppeteer for a series of unwitnessed performances."I The story she invents - the continuing saga of Miss Corn-Shuck, Mr. Sweet Smell, and the hussy Miss Corn-Cob-mirrors the drama being narrated on the town's open, central stage: the porch of Joe Clarke's store. Like the stories of desire, frustration of desire, and infidelity which constitute Eatonville lore, Zora's scenarios revolve around black people who function together as a community, publicly sanctioning or punishing behavior, loving, dying, and telling sto- ries as if the surrounding white world has no bearing on their lives. By imitating in her private theater the activities of this legitimized, creative, all-black community, Zora stands in for the autobiography's author, who seeks to validate and reinstate her life by couching it in empowering genres. In contrast to descriptions of the static world of myth and Zora's place in it which constitute much of the early chapters, what follows becomes episodic and focuses on the uprooted protagonist's travel adventures (a theme suggested by the chap- ter titles "Wandering," "Backstage and Railroad," and "School Again"). The reader's attention shifts from Zora's thoughts to her surroundings and the adventures in which she becomes embroiled. The narrative grows increasingly abstracted from the protagonist's inner world as she becomes correspondingly two- dimensional and inaccessible to the reader. We have entered the world of the picaresque, in which an opaque central character whose nature is fixed or static is involved in a series of episodes</page><page sequence="8">674 Judith Robey which seem to elapse in zero time, or what Mikhail Bakhtin has termed "adventure time" ("Bildungsroman" 1 1). 12 In his study of the picaresque, Robert Alter outlines the fea- tures of the novel of roguery which began in Spain. He calls the picaresque 'a literature of learning, a literature of experience" (3), and defines the picaro as a homeless outcast, but not a rebel, who, flung into an indifferent world, nevertheless never questions the larger order of things. The picaro is an opportunist who employs his/her wit, acting skills, and low social position (and, we might add here, skin color) as a means of manipulating and gaining satirical distance from the powerful. Alter specifies that the rogue, whose psychology is fixed, does not develop psy- chically (5); the episodic nature of the narrative replaces charac- ter development as the principle of movement in the novel. The picaresque novel is a form of narrative which is concerned with action and the external world. The tension or 'conflict" that keeps this narrative taut is the individual's incessant and ingenious struggle to take a livelihood from a grudging world.... The events and motions of this struggle are the principal interest; not the personality of the strug- gler, which is never even highly particularized ... he-his inner life, his psychological complexity his moral growth or decline-is not allowed to come between us and the large world. (31) Particularly in chapters 7 through 10 of Dust Tracks we en- counter a homeless Zora of unspecified age, wandering from one menial job to another, seizing whatever opportunities present themselves to her. Like the picaresque novel, these central chap- ters reflect little of the protagonist's internalization of events or inner development, but present a distinctly satirical version of the world she traverses. In the course of her adventures (e.g., working as a manicurist on Capitol Hill and becoming the confi- dante of men behind the political machinery in Washington), we glean little of her thoughts and cannot fail to detect the satiric edge to the depictions of the personalities Zora encounters. "Miz Cally," the stereotypic "black mammy" who views Zora as an interloper in her domain (a white household), her childlike mis- tress in the Gilbert and Sullivan troupe, and indeed all of her white benefactors are portrayed as exaggerated, almost gro- tesque figures. 13 Two important scenarios in the text depict Zora's initiation into the life of a picaro. The first one I have already mentioned- Zora's reading for the white delegation visiting her school. The second such event centers around Zora's relations with the oper- etta troupe that employs her in the picaresque chapter "Back- stage and Railroad." Here Zora learns to play the fool for white patrons in exchange for their rewards (mostly in the form of</page><page sequence="9">Generic Strategies in Hurston's Dust Tracks 675 sweets): "They teased me all the time just to hear me talk. But there was no malice in it. If I got mad and spoke my piece, they liked it even better. I was stuffed with ice-cream sodas and Coca-colaw (136). Among actors, Zora learns to play roles suc- cessfully: casting herself first as a naive Southern girl, then as a confidante mediating in intercompany love affairs, she learns to entertain and "take a livelihood from" her employers. Finally, Zora becomes a writer as she records her comments on the company's daily goings-on on a call-board. Clearly, learning to play roles successfully is connected with the activity of writing, storytelling, or "lying." Storytelling itself is, in fact, set up in the text as an act of defiance directed against powerful white personages. Reading for the delegation of white women in school is presented as Zora's means of deceiving them by playing upon their racially based misconceptions of her. Zora appears to share her community's conception of art as a subversive yet regenerative activity. (This is reflected linguistically in the term the community uses for storytelling, lying, and in the way folktales arise as a means of criticizing individuals and/or laughing at individual or collective foibles.) Zora's "lies" defy the orders of her white mentors, such as her white godfather, who admonishes her to tell only the truth (41), and Godmother (Charlotte Osgood) Mason, who insists that art without "sincerity" and "directness" of expression is invalid. We see that, on the one hand, the picaresque promises to empower the protagonist, because it is a genre in which "lying" or writing is sanctioned and is used to manipulate the hege- monic class. As the recorder of events for the operetta troupe in "Backstage and the Railroad," for example, Zora's position is comparatively influential. Not only the fact that she gains the confidence of the entire troupe of actors, but also the way she is referred to linguistically on the call-board, reflects the authorita- tive role she takes on. Entries run, for example, as follows: " 'Zora says . . .' " or " The observant reporter of the Call-board asserts . . .'" (139). However, as the chief gossip columnist Zora is, after all, only a mock authority; the ironic contrast between the imaginary, em- powering role she is given and the actual subservient place she occupies is a source of amusement for the cast-a joke made, in fact, at her expense. Other instances in the text of patrons plac- ing Zora in authoritative roles for their own amusement suggest the problematic nature of acquiring authority as a picaro. 14 The appearances of white patrons in chapters which mark a transition between the picaresque and essay modes (such as</page><page sequence="10">676 Judith Robey "Research" and "Two Women in Particular") dramatize the author's difficulty in writing an independent self as a picaro. For example, in "Research" Godmother Mason issues pronounce- ments such as the following: "'You have broken the law.... You are dissipating your powers in things that have no real meaning.... Keep silent. Does a child in the womb speak?'" (176). Godmother Mason's stifling orders to "keep silent" and produce "sincere" art also echo the earlier words of Zora's godfa- ther: " 'Snidlets, don't be a nigger .... Niggers lie and lie!'" (41). This coercive relationship between patron and charge implicitly contrasts with Zora's relations with her natural mother.15 'Two Women in Particular" is a more problematic chapter, be- cause it is an edited version of a chapter included in the appen- dix, "The Inside Light-Being a Salute to Friendship," which paints a less than flattering portrait of the writer Fannie Hurst (for whom Hurston worked as a secretary). In the original, ap- pended chapter, statements such as "Fannie Hurst has picked on me to my profit" or "I would be the press agent for her dress" (310) indicate a thinly veiled antagonism towards the childlike woman Hurston chauffeured around. This chapter also includes a resentful account of how Katharane Edson Mershon dragged her, despite her obvious lack of enthusiasm, up and down the California coast. The edited version of this chapter includes two portraits: one of Fannie Hurst and one of Ethel Waters. It may be more accurate, however, to say that the two portraits are of Hurston as a depen- dent and as a patron herself. In what appears to be a reversal of the role she plays with white friends, she says of Ethel Waters, "I am her friend, and her tongue is in my mouth. I can speak her sentiments, although Ethel Waters can do very well indeed in speaking for herself (245). The edited chapter thus seems to argue that patronage comes in all colors, but one wonders whether the changes resulting in a less confrontational, seem- ingly colorblind "tribute to friendship" are not simply a continua- tion of the picaresque strategy of accommodation. The perception that her picaresque persona is ineffectual be- comes acute in the transitional travel chapters "Research" and "Two Women in Particular," where the portrayal of white patrons seems to say more about the protagonist's reliance upon power- ful mentors ("friends") than about her ironic distance to them. "Make the attempt if you want to, but you will find that trying to go through life without friendship is like milking a bear to get cream for your morning coffee. It is a whole lot of trouble, and then not worth much after you get it" (321). This quote is easily</page><page sequence="11">Generic Strategies in Hurston's Dust Tracks 677 read as a statement on the impossibility of surviving without patronage rather than as a tribute to friendship. Beginning with chapter 12-"My People! My People!"-the nar- rative more fully takes on the character of an essay. Chapters 12 through 16 (although 13, discussed above, is a transitional chapter) and the unpublished chapters included in the appendix of the second edition (which number among them a more com- plete version of "My People! My People!" as well as the projected final chapter) constitute essays in terms of their method of argu- mentation, their treatment of topical issues, and the inclusion of actual material from the essays Hurston wrote earlier. In an essayistic manner, the speaker explicates in "My People! My People!" terms such as Race Consciousness and Race Man (217). What follows is a series of arguments illustrated with folkloric material: She uses a number of "monkey stories," for example, to illustrate the argument that black people are "schiz- ophrenic" (i.e., they praise black achievements with one breath and express shame over their race's "common" or non-white behavior with the next). The speaker in the essay chapters serves as a persona of the author, addressing her contemporaries in the fictional "now" she shares with the reader and touching upon "questions of the day." The issues she deals with, such as American imperialism in the edited chapter "Seeing the World as It Is," or religion in the chapter of that name, are all related to a contemporary issue: the "Race Question." Finally, Hurston uses specific arguments and examples in the essay chapters which can be found in some of her published essays, such as "How it Feels to Be Colored Me."16 As we shall see, the method of calling into question the set of expectations and presuppositions her readers bring to the reading act is a strategy Hurston uses both in essays published in white journals and in the final chapters of Dust Tracks. In "Looking Things Over," for example, she gives an elaborate, ambiguous answer to a question she places in the mouths of posited readers: "What do I want, then?" (284). Her circuitous response to the question, which ends with the perhaps less than sincere conclusion, "I want a busy life, a just mind and a timely death" (285), is typical of Hurston's technique of setting up "hot" questions and frustrat- ing the reader with innocuous or ambiguous answers. 17 On the one hand, the shift to the essay beginning with "My People! My People!" signals the author's attempt to recreate a self whose fate is not determined by patrons. The protagonist be- comes the fictional "author herself," and the discourse takes on</page><page sequence="12">678 Judith Robey an authoritative, confrontational edge. Here she begins to challenge the reader by running circles around "the questions on everyone's mind" which she (as a successful black writer) feels compelled to answer. In "My People! My People!" the authorial voice responds with conflicting statements to the expectation that she comment on her race. Rejecting such concepts as "race solidarity," she nevertheless illustrates by means of an anecdote the need for unity among blacks (228-30). She addresses the "race issue" by claiming that race is not an issue. Instead of elaborating on her views, the authorial I calls into question the reader's generic and sociological expectations. For example, she calls attention to the expectation that she "tell all" ("Ladies do not kiss and tell any more than gentlemen do" [2491) and de- clines to engage in the expected complaints over the racism she has endured. On the other hand, other arguments made in the essay chapters seem calculated to appease a white audience. Statements such as "I have no race prejudice of any kind" (285) or "Let us all be kissing-friends" (286) paint a picture of a colorblind Zora, un- embittered by race prejudice and willing to overlook centuries of white hegemony. But no less so than the socially conscious critic of American foreign policy during World War II who emerges in the edited chapter "Seeing the World as It Is," the image of a colorblind, accommodating author is merely another mask that appears in response to her readers' desire that she expose herself to them. Repudiating the need for "'the same chance as the rest'" (284) in "Looking Things Over" not only creates a version of the author intended for white consumption (i.e., one who accepts the status quo), but also is consistent with the picaresque strategy in the narrative. This method of outsmarting without offending her white audience is not, however, one that empowers the speaker, since it necessarily allows the author's readership to shape the discursive space her utterance enters. As I have argued, not only shifting positions but also shifting genres is in itself a picaresque activity. In shedding her prophet's robes for a dress and one pair of shoes (i.e., shifting from the mythic to the picaresque mode) and then exchanging her identity as a trickster for that of the figure of "the author," the implied author employs throughout the text the same method of role- playing a picaro uses. The role of the picaro is therefore one that is not discarded in the essay chapters, despite the concomitant creation of an em- powered authorial persona who challenges the preconceptions of her readership. Moreover, playing the picaro proves an inade-</page><page sequence="13">Generic Strategies in Hurston's Dust Tracks 679 quate strategy for combatting the reader's hegemony over the writing act. Picaros accept patronage, and the text clearly por- trays patrons as those who silence and impose alien values upon the artist. Such are the contemporary readers of Hurston's text, who are placed in a category with characters such as Zora's "godparents- in demanding "truthful" responses from the artist to certain issues or questions. As I have sought to show, the movement of the I of the text from one existential mode to another has a correlate in the generic movement from myth to the picaresque, to the essay; this progression in the narrative makes a metatextual statement about the way the posited author copes with the problem of audience. The transitional points between these genres under- score the need for generic and existential shifts in response to pressures white reader-patrons place upon the writer. However, the authorial strategy of recreating the world of the text (and, it follows, rewriting the I who inhabits it) ultimately proves unsuccessful as a method for empowering the authorial I. Despite the powerful images of the self posited with each new genre (the tragic, mythic wanderer; the child-dramaturg; the pi- caro as writer, satirizing her patrons; the authorial persona call- ing into question the reader's expectations and presuppositions), the strategies of the picaro persist even in the final chapters and underscore the author's inability to disengage herself from the influence of the reader qua patron. Dust Tracks fails as an expose of the author's life and views, or as the erection of a public "statue" of the self, but succeeds as a dramatization of the agon between white reader and black writer that for Hurston precedes and threatens literary production. The autobiography's value lies in the statement it makes about the debilitating influence her white readership has on the act of writing an autonomous self. Dust Tracks testifies to the fact that racial difference and the implicit expectations of her readership presented Hurston with obstacles sufficiently formidable to render virtually impossible the emergence of a self unobscured by masks, ruses, or self-imposed censorship. Notes 'For example, Friedman illustrates her thesis using Charlotte Perkins Gilman's short story The Yellow Wallpaper" and Ntozake Shange's play for colored girls who have considered suicide/when the rainbow is enuf. Like some critics, she generalizes about a genre that is in no way clearly defined.</page><page sequence="14">680 Judith Robey Moreover, her countermodel to the white Western male autobiography erases what may be important differences among marginalized groups. 2For another discussion of black women's autobiography which takes into account the role of the reader, compare Fox-Genovese, "To Write My Self." "The progression from private to public genres in the autobiography is on the surface an appropriation of the white male tradition of the genre, in which the self emerges as a public figure in the final chapters. However, the predominance of the picaresque mode throughout most of the text also places It within the tradition of black male autobiography. Charles H. Nich- ols argues that both black (male) autobiography and its forerunner the slave narrative, represent an independent picaresque tradition that grew out of social conditions in the antebellum South reminiscent of sixteenth-century Spain. Hurston appears to place her autobiography between these two tradi- tions. 4I do not mean to suggest that Hurston conceived of her audience as being composed of only white readers. Rather, I would argue that two sets of oppositions are set up in the text: those of Self/Black/Writer, and Other/White/Reader. It can be argued that white patrons who appear in the narrative are metaphors for both black (mostly male, well-educated) and white readers. 5The fact that the black tradition of "picaresque" autobiography was al- most exclusively male makes Hurston's relation to the genre an intriguing one. Moreover, the question of the degree to which Hurston's appropriation of the picaresque creates a dialogue with the black (versus European) tradi- tion of the genre and the issue of Hurston's response to a dearth of literary models by black women are also important, although they unfortunately lie beyond the scope of this paper. 6See Dardel, who describes the conception of time and the individual presented in myth. 'Myth-time is a discontinuous time, a repeated 'now,' not a duration, but an actualisation which proceeds by leaps from 'now' to another 'now' " (231). About the relationship between nature and the human sphere, Dardel notes that myth 'traces and avows the existential bond of man with his environment" (235). 7See Bakhtin's discussion of the chronotope. 8Receiving sweets and money from white patrons is a recurrent event in the text: For example, 'Godfather" hands her a peanut bar along with a goodly dose of advice, and members of the theatrical company with which she travels stuff her with sweets. The dollar in pennies Zora receives for reading aloud for the ladies is, in effect, her first literary prize. This scene anticipates the chapter 'Books and Things," where the acceptance of Zora's first book and offer of $200 raise the question of whether the protagonist is being 'bought" by white people. This is an aspect of Hurston's life and work which has not gone unobserved. Langston Hughes made the famous obser- vation that '. . . she was always getting scholarships and things from wealthy white people, some of whom simply paid her just to sit around and represent the Negro race for them. . ." (239). Also, Barbara Johnson points out that Hurston, in her essays, takes a Joyful and lucrative gatepost stance between black and white cultures" (279). 9We should note that shame or guilt is also connected for Zora with the death of her mother, an event which heralds the end of childhood. Unable to carry out her mother's final request that she prevent the community's usual superstitious practices, Zora watches her relatives remove the pillow from underneath her mother's head and cover the clock at the moment of death. 10In addition to Gulliver's Travels and Grtnmm's Fairy Tales, Zora avidly reads Greek and Norse myths as well as the Old Testament. The heroes with</page><page sequence="15">Generic Strategies in Hurston's Dust Tracks 681 whom she most identifies include powerful male figures such as Hercules; Thor, swinging 'his mighty short-handled hammer as he sped across the sky in rumbling thunder, lightning flashing from the tread of his steeds and the wheels of his chariot" (53); and David of the Old Testament, who did 'some mighty smiting" (54). 1 At this moment, I would suggest, the protagonist Is playing out the author's fantasy: engaging in a creative act which is free of the audience's role in shaping performance. l2See Bakhtin's "The Btldungsroman." Of the adventure novel (which in- cludes the picaresque) Bakhtin writes, 'The only time developed . . . is adventure time, which consists of the most immediate units-moments, hours, days-snatched at random from the temporal process" (1 1). 13Her mistress Miss M-, for example, is described as being alternately moody and "as playful as a kitten," romping about 'like a puppy" and inventing games for Zora to play with her (139). We should note that another employer, Fannie Hurst, is depicted as a subadult, employing Zora as some- thing of a playmate rather than a companion. 14For example, Godmother Mason expects Zora to personify 'the Negro soul"; the writer Fannie Hurst decks her charge out in African robes as "Princess Zora" and parades her before stunned waiters in swanky restau- rants. 151n her childhood Zora's mother encourages her to " jump at dat sun,'" whereas Godmother Mason insists that her fledgling regress to the state of "'a child in the womb.' " The Imperative from her white godfather contrasts with her mother's defense of her fanciful lies in the face of her grandmother's wrath. l6An example of the overlap is a statement made in this essay and in "My People! My People!" In both texts the narrator ironically claims to be the only black American without Native American ancestry. The remark implicitly criticizes those who, instead of fully embracing their race, claim to have "exotic," non-black ancestors and therefore "mixed blood." 17As Barbara Johnson points out in an article on several essays and Mules and Men, Hurston's writing sometimes presupposes a question by the reader and then problematizes the structures of address used to pose that ques- tion.
