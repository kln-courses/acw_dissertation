<plain_text><page sequence="1">FREUD AND SOCIOBIOLOGY: REFLECTIONS ON THE NATURE OF GENIUS Robert Langbaum I T is a sign of Freud's greatness that, as we enter the decade which will mark the 100th anniversary of his first psychological publica- tions, we still can't get over him. We are still quarreling with him, still revising our understanding of his life and theory in order to reconcile Freud with our other preoccupations. There has been the attempt by the postwar German school of Adorno and Marcuse to reconcile Freud with Marx. There has been the attempt by the French psychoanalyst Lacan to reconcile Freudian psychoanalysis with the latest linguistic theory, and the attempt by the contemporary French philosopher Ricoeur to turn upon psychoanalysis the latest hermeneuti- cal or interpretive methods. There have been attempts, in books like Henri Ellenberger's The Discovery of the Unconscious (1970), to question Freud's originality by recalling the scientific and intellectual milieu from which he drew his ideas. The most recent revisionist book is Frank J Sulloway's Freud, Biologist of the Mind: Beyond the Psychoanalytic Legend (NY: Basic Books, 1979). Sulloway continues Ellenberger's work of deflating the so-called "myth of the hero," but he does it for a polemical purpose-to justify the controversial new discipline, sociobiology, by showing Freud as the link between Darwin and the sociobiologists' aim to synthesize biology with sociology and psychology. A Harvard-trained historian of science now at the University of California, Berkeley, Sulloway supports Harvard's Edward 0 Wilson, whose Sociobiology: The New Svnthesis has stirred up much discussion since its publication in 1975. Subloway's claim to have written an intellectual biography of Freud makes his book a critique of the monumental three-volume Life and Work of Sigmund Freud written by Freud's disciple, the British psychoanalyst Ernest Jones (NY: Basic Books, 1953-57). Yet Subo- way's book cannot compete with Jones's, because it is not really a 105</page><page sequence="2">106 THE KENYON REVIEW biography but an informative, polemical account of Freud's strictly scientific development inasmuch as it bears upon his debt to Darwinian evolutionary biology. The book that can compete with Jones's, in that it is a comprehensive biography, is Ronald W Clark's Freud: The Man and His Cause (NY: Random House, 1980). Although Jones had the advantage of knowing Freud and participating in the events described, Clark has the advantage of impartiality. Jones is suspect in places just because he was still fighting Freud's battles. Clark has had access to documents unavailable to Jones, and is like Sulloway able to invoke the latest scientific opinion and draw upon the recent research of Ellen- berger and others. Unlike Sulloway, however, Clark is critical without being revisionist-without challenging the portrait of Freud and the assessment of his genius and originality that emerge from Jones's pages. Sulloway's is therefore the controversial book that has to be coped with. Sulloway's book seems more polemical than biographical be- cause Sulloway lacks the literary skill to project a portrait of Freud that can embrace the many contradictions in Freud's life and character-the contradiction, for example, between Freud's generosity and vindictive- ness. As a result Sulloway oscillates between deflation and reconstitu- tion of Freud's image; whereas Jones and Clark absorb Freud's inconsistencies into a vitally unified portrait of the many-sided, self- contradictory nature of genius. Sulloway lacks an adequate understand- ing of genius, because he lacks the imagination to understand imagination-genius's distinguishing quality. As polemic, however, Sul- loway's book is illuminating-deepening our understanding of Freud's Darwinian side-and at least partly convincing. Sulloway argues convincingly against the tendency of Freud studies to trace a fortunate evolution in Freud from biologist to psychologist. This myth of Freud as pure psychologist relates, Sulloway argues less convincingly, to the myth of Freud as a hero who, after standing bravely alone against anti-Semitic, prudish, and scientifically reactionary enemies, singlehandedly brought forth psychoanalysis out of his own head. Freud and his disciples have, in other words, exaggerated the opposition to Freud and deliberately concealed his debt to biology in order to promote the myth of his heroism and absolute originality. This notion of a conspiracy cannot, as I shall show, stand up against the evidence that Clark's biography adds to Jones's. Nor is the conspiracy theory necessary to the valuable part of Sulloway's argu- ment. Sulloway is valuable when he shows through a description of Freud's scientific milieu how much he owes to the medical, biological, and psychological research of his time and to the Darwinism implicit in the late nineteenth-century atmosphere. The big change in Freud,</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT LANGBAUM 107 Sulloway argues convincingly, is not from biology to psychology but from his early mechanistic physiology to a Darwinism that combined biology with psychology. Why, we may well ask, should Sulloway think it important to launch such an argument just now-especially since Freud and his disciples have never denied his intellectual debts, even if their emphasis differs in places from Sulloway's? Ernest Jones, in his "'Biology" chapter, discusses at length Freud's connection with biology-citing Freud's insistence "on the genetic nature of his work, which was in line with the developmental studies in biology," and Freud's hint that Haeckel's law " 'Ontogeny [the development of a single organism] is a repetition of phylogeny [the evolutionary development of the species]' might well prove to be true of mental process also." Jones says that Freud completed Darwin's work by showing how man's highest attributes, including even the religious instinct, could be accounted for in strictly evolutionary terms without invoking supernatural interven- tion. "By so doing," says Jones, Freud "closed the still remaining gap in the doctrine of human evolution," and "it was for this reason that I bestowed on Freud the title of the Darwin of the Mind." In other words, Freud achieved that synthesis of biology, psychology, and sociology which has come to be called sociobiology-the difference being that Freud wrote mainly about humans on whom he did all his clinical work, while the sociobiologists write, or ought to write, mainly about animals on whom they do all their experimental work: the sociobiologists wander beyond their proper depth when they attempt to write directly, rather than inferentially, about humans. Sulloway merely elaborates Jones's description of Freud as "Darwin of the Mind," giving less attention than Jones to Freud's Lamarckism-the nowadays discredited theory partly adhered to by Darwin himself, which claims that an animal's needs and acquired habits can produce variations in its heredity. Darwin believed only in the hereditability of acquired habits, but Freud insisted that Lamarck's "'concept of 'need,' which creates and modifies organs, is nothing else than the power unconscious ideas have over the body of which we see the remains in hysteria-in short, the 'omnipotence of thoughts.' " The difference between Sulloway's book and Jones's "Biology" chapter is that Jones emphasizes Freud's contribution, while Sulloway em- phasizes Freud's debt, to biology. Sulloway makes an issue of Freud's debt to biology because he wants to argue that "Freud stands squarely within an intellectual lineage where he is, at once, a principal scientific heir of Charles Darwin and other evolutionary thinkers in the nineteenth century and a major</page><page sequence="4">108 THE KENYON REVIEW forerunner of the ethologists and sociobiologists of the twentieth century." Sulloway is arguing for sociobiology; and the result is that the attacks on his book, which have already begun, form part of the controversy that swirls around sociobiology, especially around Wilson's Sociobiology: The New Synthesis. N i ' ro ONE objects to the fruitful way in which Wilson studies animal behavior by relating the animals' biological equipment to their social organizations, systems of communication, mating rituals, care of young, and even expressions of emotion. The thing that disturbs social scientists, leftists, and to a lesser degree humanists is Wilson's final chapter on man, and even more important the implied parallel throughout, in which Wilson tries to apply to man the principles evolved from his study of animals-especially the principle that social and psychological characteristics are mainly determined by the organism's need to win out in the Darwinian process of natural selection through "maximizing" its "gene flow" or reproductive success. They all see a threat of encroachment in Wilson's imperialist statement-an im- perialism like that of psychoanalysis-that "'Sociology and the other social sciences, as well as the humanities, are the last branches of biology waiting to be included in the Modern Synthesis." The sociologists and anthropologists who feel particularly threatened are the followers of Durkheim, who are committed to the principle that culture is discontinuous with nature-that man is human just to the extent that he has liberated himself through culture from biological laws. The case is argued most succinctly by Marshall Sahlins in The Use and Abuse of Biology: An Anthropological Critique of Sociobiology (Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, 1976). Sahlins insists that "there is no necessary relation between the phenomenal form of a human social institution and the individual [or biological] motivations that may be realized or satisfied therein"- that soldiers are not satisfying their aggressive or territorial instincts, that the reasons animals or individual humans fight "are not the reasons wars take place." Such an abstract view is open to question, and it is certainly reasonable to test it against the evidence of equally abstract wars between biologically determined ant colonies; or against the contrary evidence of Nazi Germany, where Hitler and a lot of Germans derived more emotional satisfaction from the nationally organized slaughter of Jews than was good for the abstract interests of the German state. Sahlins criticizes Wilson's use of anthropomorphizing terms like '"'polygyny," "castes," " 6slaves," to prove that animal "societies" are</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT LANGBAUM 109 comparable to ours. Yet we can hardly think about nonhuman phenom- ena except through such metaphorical comparisons. Sahlins's most convincing argument against the comparison of animal and human societies is that variation in animal societies always accompanies biological differences; whereas the single human species exhibits a rich variety of cultures and social organizations-even within the same race. It must be said in Wilson's defense that his mainly implied comparisons of animal and human psychological and social characteristics reveal differences even more vividly than similarities, and that in his final chapter on man he grants the incalculable range of man's evolutionary leap. His final chapter is the least interesting just because he repeats what has been better said by social scientists and humanists. Leftists object to sociobiology because they see in it a revival of the Victorian social Darwinism that used Darwin's biological concepts of "natural selection," "struggle for existence," and "'survival of the fittest" to justify the brutal competitiveness of free-market capitalism. Sahlins, who writes from a leftist point of view, sees sociobiology as even more capitalistic than social Darwinism, because the sociobiolo- gists emphasize individual over group selection and conceive the individual organism as using natural selection to "maximize"' its gene flow-rather than, as Darwin puts it, being used by natural selection. Sahlins, however, is quarreling over metaphors. Darwin admits that the necessities of language force him to speak metaphorically, as though natural selection had a will. It is unfortunate that the sociobiologists have chosen to use the jargon of economics to describe an unconscious process. But their choice of metaphor, in addressing citizens of a free-market economy, doesn't necessarily indicate a capitalist bias in what they are actually saying. Although Wilson uses "profitability" to describe an animal's weighing of the "'cost" of altruism against its own genetic advantage, he gives as many examples of inherited '"altruism" as of inherited "'selfishness"' (also anthropomorphic metaphors). Sahlins could find a model for communism in Wilson's admiration for the perfect coopera- tiveness of ant and wasp societies and in his statement that of the mammals only man approaches-as far as he can, given his individuality and free will-that much cooperativeness. Wilson makes it clear that man's victory in the struggle for existence comes of his ability to cooperate-an ability maximized by language. But in speaking of the individual organism as though it had a will which could affect evolution, Wilson is being more Lamarckian and therefore more Freudian than Darwin; and this brings us back to Sulloway's interposition of Freud between Darwin and the sociobiologists. It is because Sahlins ignores</page><page sequence="6">110 THE KENYON REVIEW the way in which the Freudian unconscious infuses animal life with mind, that he overlooks the humanist element in sociobiology. Humanists are or should be less disturbed by sociobiology to the extent that they understand Freud and understand what modern literature has been saying since the early nineteenth-century appearance of romanticism. For romanticism teaches that a work of art is not diminished but is enriched through its lowly origin in the artist's sexual desire or desire for power. Romanticism dissolves the distinction between high and low. Coleridge taught that the imagination is richest when it embraces the widest possible contradictions. The Coleridgean or romantic theory of imagination prepares us for evolutionary biology, because it describes the movement from sensation to thought back to sensation-the movement of the poetic image. The poet, said Words- worth in the early nineteenth century, remembers his childhood more vividly than other people and can combine those memories with his highest thoughts. The poet, said T S Eliot in the early twentieth century, is at once more primitive and more civilized than other people. Freud said much the same thing in Three Essays on the Theory of Sexuality (1905), where he wrote that the importance for psychoanalysis of childhood memory and childhood sexuality "increases in proportion to the degree of individual culture"-in proportion, in other words, to the degree of repression, of uneasy combination with civilization. Freud confirmed the romanticists' intuitions through what he taught about the origins of art in the artist's unconscious. He is biological in his theory that the sex drive or libido is the force behind all human endeavor. But in his idea of sublimation, of the way in which frustrated libido is rechanneled into cultural achievement, Freud is sociobiological and humanistic. He teaches us to value the highest manifestations of libido all the more because of the price paid in sexual privation. The ultimate implication of Freud and of romantic literary theory is that the work of art ought to contain the evolutionary history of the artist, the race, and the species. In his essay "Freud and Literature," Lionel Trilling tells us that Freud's contribution to literature lies not in his direct remarks on it; for Freud finally speaks of literature with contempt, as mere wish-fulfilling illusion, with the artist in the same category as the neurotic. Freud's contribution rather lies in this-that "of all mental systems, the Freudian psychology is the one which makes poetry indigenous to the very constitution of the mind," in that it shows the mind as operating naturally through the images and symbols that are the stuff of poetry. I would add Freud's other major contribution to literature. He confirmed and elaborated through analysis the romantic intuition and</page><page sequence="7">ROBERT LANGBAUM 111 Darwin's suggestion that there is no clear line between thinking and non-thinking. Once we possess the notion of unconscious thought, we can understand that we are thinking even when we suppose we are not thinking-when we dream, feel an emotion, or receive sensations-and that some mode of thought goes on even in the lowest organisms, even in single cells which seem to "know" what to do. Darwin demonstrates how tenuous is the line between what we call "instinct" and what we call "thought." Freud therefore justifies literature's way of com- municating through emotion and sensation. He also justifies the respect shown in romantic and modern literature and in modern culture generally for the mental life of children, primitives, and even animals. All this partly accounts for our current worry over endangered species and our interest in the songs of whales and the intelligence of porpoises and chimpanzees. The striking thing about Wilson's book is not, as his opponents think, that he downgrades man but that he upgrades animals-showing the liveliness and variety of their mental and emo- tional life, systems of communication, and social interaction. Freud, inasmuch as he supplements Darwin, is responsible for this. But Wilson makes his contribution too. For Wilson extends Freud's notion of unconscious memory to include the memory locked up in our genes. Freud is at least partly responsible for that reversal of the Victorian reaction to Darwin which manifests itself in the enthusiasm for sociobiology and for the upgrading of animals. The Victorians were distressed by the news of our animal descent. We instead are proud of our animal descent, because Freud has taught us that the deeper the unconscious roots of a cultural flowering, the more substantial and precious is that flowering. We are proud of our descent from animals who are understood to be unconsciously thoughtful-not, as the Pavlovian behaviorists would have it, mechanically conditioned. We positively seek evidence of our animal descent because it saves us from that other, more threatening model of man as a machine. All this is congenial to the literary mind. In "The New Nature Poetry" in my book The Modern Spirit (NY: Oxford University Press, 1970), 1 discuss the new importance of animals in twentieth-century nature poetry as symbolizing the vitality of our unconscious life. The issue is between rationalistic dualists who see abrupt discontinuity between man and nature (for the seventeenth-century dualist Descartes-only man thinks, therefore animals are machines), and the romanticists who see continuity. We favor the romantic view because we have seen that rationalistic dualism can, when divorced from religion, turn man too into a machine. Both Utopian leftists and Marxists oppose any theory, whether</page><page sequence="8">112 THE KENYON REVIEW it be the theory of original sin or of our ineradicable animal heritage, which limits man's perfectability and malleability. The literary mind, instead, has been prepared by the greatest literature for the more complex tragic view of man as torn between his aspirations and the limiting conditions of society, heredity, circumstance-as torn, in the Greek tragic view, between free will and fate. That is why Freud is so appealing to literary people. He has reconfirmed the old tragic view that man is mainly not governed by reason; and he has, at the same time, increased man's stature-after science's reduction of it-by enlarging the dimensions of his psychic life and by showing that his psychic conflicts are objectified in myth. Paradoxically, Freud enriches our humanity by showing that we are capable of the most degrading desires and actions; the degradation can be enriching if reconciled to our capacity for the highest thoughts. Freud traces our highest achieve- ments back to the primeval ooze, showing that our thoughts like our bodies recapitulate the history of the species, and this imaginative appropriation of evolutionary biology awakens in us a sense of awe before the miracle of culture-as a flower growing out of the mud. It is out of this imaginative synthesis of man's biological, psychological, and social history that Freud has created in books like Totem and Taboo (1913) and Civilization and Its Discontents (1930) two great epic poems in prose. Epic poems have always dramatized the legendary origins of the tribe or nation. Freud has used the Darwinian "legend" to dramatize the origin of our species, and he has imbued his accounts with the resonances of Greek tragedy. In Civilization and Its Discontents, Freud suggests that man first committed the tragic sin of hybris or pride when he dared to stand erect and consequently repressed his sense of smell, especially as a sexual stimulus. Out of repression- disgust over "bad" smells and shame over his newly exposed genitals-came the diverted libido that produced civilization. But man pays a tragic price for civilization in the repression that causes mental illness. In its last chapter, Totem and Taboo takes off from Darwin's hypothesis that primal human groups must have resembled ape hordes in which one old male dominates the females and drives out the sons, who then form an all-male group. Freud imagines a phylogenetic human drama, which would have occurred repeatedly, in which the expelled sons combine to kill and eat the father and possess the females. Smitten by guilt (or fear of the dead father's avenging spirit), the victorious sons deny themselves the females. They regularly recall-at a feast where they consume the totem animal, which as Freud proves symbolizes the father-their parricide and their vow never to repeat it and never to</page><page sequence="9">ROBERT LANGBAUM 113 commit incest. The totem feast is the origin of religious ritual. Freud's Darwinian "plot -what he called his "Just-So-Story' explains the connection between totemism, with its ban on marriage within the totem clan, and the incest taboo fundamental to all human societies. His "plot" arouses the pity and terror of the great epic and tragic plots, and also the sense of their psychic, if not historical, truth-for Freud's primal drama objectifies a psychic pattern, the Oedipus complex. Freud is Darwinian as well in his treatment of our individual sexuality as an evolution toward the capacity for heterosexual genital intercourse-with the perversions, like homosexuality and sadism, explained as fixations at earlier stages when the erotic zones are distributed throughout the body; so that infantile sexuality is polymorphous, recapitulating the sexual experiences of our animal ancestors. Freud accounts for culture by three biological phenomena in addition to man's erect posture. The first is permanent libido which keeps male and female together. The second is the long period of human childhood, which gives time for education and which produces through involvement with the parents the Oedipus complex, entailing guilt and idealism. The third is the interrupted sexual development distinctive of human beings. The period of uninhibited polymorphous infantile sexual- ity is followed, after the age of five, by the latency period-a period of repression during which infancy is blotted from memory and the restraints of civilization are acquired; there follows puberty with its development of genitality and retention of the latency period's guilt and amnesia. Freud remained so Darwinian that he went on to speculate, in Moses and Monotheism (1939), that "the human race is descended from a species of animal which reached sexual maturity in five years," and that this "postponement of sexual life and its diphasic [two waves] onset" is connected with the process of becoming human. Sulloway makes clear a biological point in Freudian theory that even attentive readers of Freud may have missed-that the repression of the latency period need not be culturally acquired, that it is an inherited recapitula- tion of the instinctual renunciations necessary for human psychosexual evolution. I N ARGUING that Freud did not singlehandedly give birth to psychoanalysis, Sulloway shows how many of Freud's fundamental ideas were already in the air of the 1890s. There was, for example, the work of the sexologists-Krafft-Ebing's famous catalogue of per- versions, Psychopathia Sexualis (1886); Havelock Ellis's Man and Woman (1894); Albert Moll's 1891 book on homosexuality and his</page><page sequence="10">114 THE KENYON REVIEW Libido Sexualis (1897), which according to Sulloway influenced Freud's abandonment in a September 1897 letter to Fliess of his theory that neuroses are caused by seductions in childhood. A Vienna that was reading Krafft-Ebing, Sulloway argues, would not have been shocked by Freud's revelations. Sulloway forgets, however, that Freud's sexual revelations raised and continue to raise more opposition than those of sexologists for at least two reasons. First, Freud uses abnormal cases to throw light on normal sexuality, thus involving us all. Second, his literary talent makes scientists suspicious of his methods and insures that his ideas will reach laymen and reach them at a depth to stir up their defenses. It is because Freud's intellect and imagination enable him to connect sexuality with every other aspect of life that people, quite justifiably, feel threatened. Freud's system-building genius makes him the begetter of the current sexual revolution, though he would hate its promotion of promiscuity and its mechanization of sex. Freud was ready enough to acknowledge a debt for his early biophysics to Helmholtz and Brucke. He also repeatedly acknowledged a debt to Josef Breuer, his friend and collaborator on Studies in Hysteria (1895). Breuer discovered that hysterical symptoms can arise from unconscious ideas, and can be made to disappear through the " cathartic" method of allowing the patient to bring these ideas into consciousness by talking out his problems. Freud broke with Breuer when Breuer refused to support publicly Freud's conclusion that all cases of hysteria and, indeed, all psychoneuroses have a sexual cause. Contrary to the usual view that Breuer refused to accept the sexual cause of neurosis, Sulloway demonstrates convincingly through quota- tions that Breuer accepted sexual causation but thought Freud went too far in universalizing the principle. The real issue, argues Sulloway in trying to right the balance in favor of Breuer, was "Breuer's relative caution in matters scientific." The real issue, it seems to me, is the difference between mediocrity and genius. It is in the nature of genius to search for the single law-one thinks of Newton, Darwin, Marx, Einstein. Sulloway paraphrases Freud to this effect: "To marry an idea, as Freud liked to say, was quite a different matter from recognizing it in passing." "They regard me," Freud complained, "rather as a monomaniac" on sexuality. Einstein, as I recall, suggested that only monomaniacs accomplish anything impor- tant. We have to fit into such understanding of genius Freud's unattractive vindictiveness against Breuer and other erstwhile friends after a break over principles. Men of genius are often great haters, principles being more important to them than mere agreeableness. Sulloway only half recognizes the issue between mediocrity and</page><page sequence="11">ROBERT LANGBAUM 115 genius. Or why is he at such pains to justify Breuer? He vacillates curiously by speaking of Freud's "fanaticism"' about sexual causation, while admitting that the sexual principle gives mental illness the biological determinism he (Sulloway) approves of. Although Sulloway sets out to deflate the myth of the hero, he actually reconstitutes it by portraying Freud as heroic in temperament and achievement. He tells us that Freud's birth with a caul gave him the sense that he was singled out for a special destiny. And as a contrast to Breuer's caution, he quotes Freud's description of himself: I was always the bold oppositionist, always on hand when an extreme had to be defended.... I have often felt as though I had inherited all the defiance and all the passions with which our ancestors defended their Temple and could gladly sacrifice my life for one great moment of history. Even while insisting on Freud's scientific debts, Sulloway repeats that Freud's "conceptual transformations" of what he borrowed show his originality; and if we recall that Shakespeare borrowed almost all his plots, we realize that it is not only ''revolutionary advances in science" that consist of such "transformations." In the end Sulloway surpris- ingly admits that "after all, Freud really was a hero. The myths are merely his historical due." Before arriving at this conclusion, Sulloway tries to minimize the amount of Freud's persecution in order to minimize the amount of his heroic resistance. He insists that the reviews of The Interpretation of Dreams were more numerous and favorable than is generally believed, and that anti-Semitism was not a serious problem for Freud. He argues unconvincingly that it was not anti-Semitism but a reduction in the number of positions that accounts for the protracted blocking of Freud's promotion at the University-this though men of lesser achievement were passed over him for those fewer positions. Anti-Semitism was in fact so widespread in the Vienna of the 1890s that a notorious anti-Semite was elected mayor. Freud begins his Autobiographical Study (1925) by alluding to the anti-Semitism he encountered as a University student, saying that it prepared him for "the fate of being in the Opposition and of being put under the ban of the 'compact majority' "-for the role, in other words, by which he defined his heroic stance. As for reviews containing mixed judgments, they always seem unfavorable to the author. Although Clark, too, says that the hostility and anti-Semitism were not quite so implacable as Freud thought, he shows us a Freud so continuously embattled until 1914 that the qualification seems a quibble that reduces to absurdity Sulloway's theory of a conspiracy to exagger-</page><page sequence="12">116 THE KENYON REVIEW ate the opposition to Freud. Here is how Clark explains the Ministry's steady rejections of the University' s nominations of Freud for a professorship: "'while a Jew" or "a man who saw sex at the root of most things" might have been approved, "the combination of both was too much for the authorities." Even when a well-connected patient finally in 1902 pulled strings and got Freud the appointment, it was only-a detail Sulloway slides over-that of professor extraordinarius, which gave him neither the rights nor duties of a faculty member; and when more than twenty years later the University "shamefacedly made him professor ordinarius," it still "failed to give him a seat on the faculty."1 It is a sign of Freud's continuing obsession with anti-Semitism that he later fought to get Jung elected President of the International Psychoanalytical Association, because he thought he needed Jung and the Swiss to provide "Aryan" cover for what would otherwise seem a Jewish movement, and that he subsequently complained of Jung's "'anti-Semitic condescension toward me." As for opposition on profes- sional grounds, Clark tells us that in turn-of-the-century Vienna Freud's name raised a laugh like a dirty joke and that medical circles dismissed him "'as someone who could not be taken seriously." The letters to Fliess (1887-1902) record Freud's chagrin over the reception of his early psychoanalytic writings. HE issue of Freud's debt to biology hangs largely on our assessment of the influence on him of the Berlin nose specialist A-and biologist Wilhelm Fliess, who replaced Breuer as Freud's confidante during the crucial years when Freud was laying the founda- tions of psychoanalysis. Fliess belonged to the same Jewish professional middle class as Freud and Breuer; he was introduced to Freud by Breuer. They exchanged letters and manuscripts and met at intervals for intense conversational sessions which Freud called "congresses." A selection of Freud's side of the correspondence (Freud apparently destroyed Fliess's letters) has been published under the title The Origins of Psychoanalysis (NY: Basic Books, 1954), a fascinating and revealing book despite the editors' censorship of the original documents. Since Freud's break with Fliess was even more bitter than the break with Breuer, involving an ugly dispute over who thought of what first, Freud and his disciples have, according to Sulloway, minimized the importance of Fliess's influence on Freud. Jones, Ernst Kris in his introduction to Origins, and even Clark insist that during Freud's most creative and neurotic years Fliess fulfilled a psychological need that caused Freud to overrate him intellectually-especially since Freud</page><page sequence="13">ROBERT LANGBAUM 117 required from Fliess biological confirmation of his emerging psychoana- lytic theories. But Sulloway proves through quotations that Fliess combined biology and psychology in just Freud's way; so that far from being, as Jones puts it, "a drag on Freud's painful progress from physiology to psychology," Fliess helped Freud forge those links between the two disciplines that were to emerge as psychoanalysis. Fliess drew a connection between nose and genitals which was psychoanalytic, since smell is the primary sexual stimulant among mammals and since Fliess successfully analyzed certain nasal disturbances-including Freud's-as neurotic. Fliess is responsible for the importance Freud gave smell as the most repressed sense. Also psychoanalytic are Fliess's theory that we are all constitutionally bisexual and his theory of periodicity-that males are governed by a twenty-three day cycle equivalent to the female twenty-eight day menstrual cycle, that our lives are governed by cycles accordant with the tides and moon. Both Fliess and Freud took seriously Darwin's tantalizing suggestion that human beings are descended from a bisexual, tide-dwelling marine animal whose feeding and reproductive habits depended on changes of tides and moon. (What a great poem on life's rhythms might be made out of that suggestion!) Fliess was as Darwinian in his thinking and as imaginatively speculative as Freud; Freud called him "'an even greater visionary than I." They began to differ when Fliess suggested that the appearance and disappearance of neuroses might have more to do with periods than with pathology and therapy, and when Fliess began juggling numbers to create a system by which he thought he could predict crucial events in people's lives, including their death dates. Freud withdrew from Fliess when Fliess turned into a crackpot. If the difference between Freud and Breuer was the difference between genius and mediocrity, the differ- ence between Freud and Fliess was the difference between genius and pseudo-genius-a difference more easily distinguishable by final results than by the free-wheeling, speculative quality common to both types of mind. Freud himself barely evaded crackpottery throughout his career; and he always liked to have a speculative friend (later it was Ferenczi) on whom he could try out his wilder surmises. The genius, whether artist or scientist, must, if he is to stay alive intellectually, keep himself open to nonsense; for the innovations and discoveries of genius often look at first like nonsense. The fact that Fliess's ideas later rigidified into actual nonsense does not invalidate their earlier speculative phase. The friendship with Fliess was fruitful for Freud because of the concepts which Jones admits he got from Fliess-bisexuality, latency period, sublimation-and because Fliess encouraged Freud's imagina-</page><page sequence="14">118 THE KENYON REVIEW tive powers. The letters to Fliess contain passages that might have been written by a romantic poet-this one, for example, of December 3, 1897: Every now and then ideas whirl through my head which promise to explain everything, and to connect the normal and the pathological, the sexual and psychological, and then they disappear again, and I make no effort to retain them, because I know that both their appearance in consciousness and their disappearance are not the real indication of their fate. On stagnant days such as yesterday and today everything inside me is stagnant and terribly lonely. I cannot talk about it to anyone, and I cannot force myself to work, as other workers can. I have to wait until things move inside me and I experience them. And so I often dream whole days away. It was because the friendship ran so deep and may have contained, as Freud suspected, "some piece of unruly homosexual feeling," that Fliess was involved in the famous self-analysis during which Freud discovered his hostility to his father and thus the Oedipus complex. The emotional involvement explains why the break between them was so ugly that Freud evolved his theory of paranoia from Fliess's behavior. But Freud's own behavior in their priority dispute was not attractive. Sulloway charges that Freud and his disciples have concealed Fliess's priority in the discovery of infantile sexuality, that Fliess was writing about infantile polymorphous sexuality at a time when Freud still believed in the seduction theory and therefore in childhood asexuality, since it was only after puberty that the memory of childhood seductions supposedly became meaningful and caused neurosis. When Freud came to realize that many of his patients' stories of childhood seduction by parents were fantasies that revealed their infantile sexual desire for a parent, he was on the way to discovering the Oedipus complex. Sulloway quotes a passage Fliess published in 1897-just before Freud's abandonment of the seduction theory-which, with its interest in infantile sexuality and etymologies, might have been written by Freud. Fliess suggests that the word "sweet" is in many languages formed by the motion the lips make in sucking: The sucking movements that small children make with their lips and tongue ... as well as thumb-sucking, must be considered as an equivalent of masturbation. . . . The role which the word "'sweet" [suss ] later plays in the language of love has its initial physiological root here. With lips and tongue the child first tastes lactose [Milchzucker] at his mother's breast, and they provide him with his earliest experience of satisfaction. "Sweet" [suss] is related to the French sucer (to suck) and to Zucker, suggar, sugere. The discussion of Fliess's influence on Freud is Sulloway's most interesting and persuasive section. But Freud's debt to Fliess as well as</page><page sequence="15">ROBERT LANGBAUM 119 to Breuer, the sexologists, and Darwin does not-as Sulloway argues- disprove, it rather proves Freud's genius and originality. For supreme genius is never eccentric; it rides the main stream of its age, combining and transforming the age's truths in such a way as to make them accessible to the future. Shakespeare, for example, made standard Elizabethan ideas and theater conventions accessible to the future as the other Elizabethan dramatists could not. Darwin's case is analogous to Freud's. For Darwin drew on a rich store of evolutionary theory; and his contribution, the idea of natural selection, was conceived independently by Alfred Russel Wallace. Yet Wallace, as he himself admitted, had not the genius to give the idea the world-shaking impact that Darwin gave it by working out all its ramifications. For one thing it was Darwin who coined the term "natural selection," and the ability to coin illuminating terms is a sign of genius. The difference between the two men appears in the papers by which they announced at the same scientific meeting their coincidental discovery. Wallace writes about natural selection without using the term; and he did not see, as did Darwin, that its principles could be derived from the breeding of domestic plants and animals for desirable qualities (the term "'natural selection" derived from analogy with artificial selection). Instead, Wallace writes: "what applies to the one [domestic animals] is almost sure not to apply to the other [wild animals]." The ability to see ever wider connections is another sign of genius. Since Sulloway gives so much attention to Freud's breaks with Breuer and Fliess, it is surprising that he says so little about the main rupture in Freud's life-the break with Carl Jung, the brilliant Swiss psychiatrist whom he had chosen as his successor. Sulloway's neglect is all the more surprising since Jung's objection to Freud's emphasis on sexuality parallels the current attacks on sociobiology as destructive of all that distinguishes humans from animals. At their first meeting in 1907, Jung-Clark tells us in his detailed account of Freud's relations with Jung-already had reservations: "I could not swallow his so-called science positivism, his merely rational view of the psyche and his materialistic point of view." Later Jung complained that "wherever, in a person or in a work of art, an expression of spirituality (in the intellectual, not the supernatural sense) came to light, he suspected it, and insinuated that it was repressed sexuality." This Jung argued-as do the opponents of sociobiology-devaluated culture as no more than a pathological consequence of repressed sexuality. Sulloway does, however, quote, at greater length than Clark,</page><page sequence="16">120 THE KENYON REVIEW Jung's account of a conversation with Freud from which one can infer why Freud insisted on the sexual cause of neurosis. I can still recall vividly how Freud said to me, "My dear Jung, promise me never to abandon the sexual theory. That is the most essential thing of all. You see, we must make a dogma of it, an unshakable bulwark." He said that to me with great emotion. . . . In some astonishment I asked him, "A bulwark- against what?" To which he replied, "Against the black tide of mud"-and here he hesitated for a moment, then added-"of occultism." Jung suggests that the sexual theory derived from some peculiar emotional need of Freud's. But Freud's admonition is from his point of view logically sound. For Freud the sexual theory was a guarantee that the "'unconscious" would not turn into another word for soul, that it would not be divorced from body. Early in his career, in the unpub- lished "Project for a Scientific Psychology," he tried to construct a psychology entirely derived from physiological functions. He failed. But he never ceased to feel that psychology was but a name for what we still do not know about biology. "'The deficiencies in our description [of mind]," he wrote as late as 1920, in Beyond the Pleasure Principle, would probably vanish if we were already in a position to replace the psychological term by physiological or chemical ones.... Biology is truly a land of unlimited possibilities. We may expect it to give us the most surprising information and we cannot guess what answers it will return in a few dozen years to the questions we have put to it. The Jungian system did in fact turn the unconscious into soul, and did in fact retreat beyond Cartesian to Christian dualism and to a renewed support for religion, mysticism, occultism. By deriving neuroses from sexuality merged with memory, Freud was doing what Wordsworth did in deriving imaginative experiences from physical sensation merged with memory. Freud was reaffirming a monism that is both scientific and romantic ("Man has no Body distinct from his Soul," Blake declared)-a monism that makes Freud, with his new way of connecting body to mind through the unconscious, the link between the romanticism and Darwinian biology that precede him and the sociobi- ology that follows.</page></plain_text>
