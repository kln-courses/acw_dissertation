<plain_text><page sequence="1">SU FIDTLER COWLING SOLDIERS AND SAILORS A reasonable person does not accost a newly minted lawyer with a pair of scissors and hold his $800 suit hostage for a bagel, not on Public Square, not in broad daylight. And K.B. was known to be a reasonable person, had taken classes on how to be a reasonable person. Yet these things happen. It was during the August 7 rally for remembering the Holocaust-that is, the World War II Holocaust, the Great one-which was, coincidentally, the day the baby peregrines flew. You could say, though, if you were so inclined, that it started well before that. You could say it start- ed the day K.B. first stepped down off the bus in Cleveland in- tending to stay, to belong, to eat bagels, about which she had been reading her entire life in novels but had never actually laid eyes on, never mind baklava, never mind pierogies. Or maybe, rather on that same day but 600 miles to the south, when she stepped up on to the bus and left home forever ("I ain't coming back, Granny." Granny just shrugged, said, "Meb- be you won't have to.") (Or if you wanted, you could say it started the year she was fifteen and, after noticing instructions in the Sunday paper for changing one's name, it came to her-the sudden onset of a lin- gering fever-that if you could change your name, maybe you could change your past, or your future. You could say it started the year she was five and the teacher Rocky Jarvis tried to drown her in the creek behind the school for no reason except that he had tried to drown two of her older sisters when they started first grade and also tried the following year with her lit- tle brother and still managed to teach them all to read, recite, name the constellations. You might as well say it started the day she was born in Granny's bed, the same bed every baby in the family, indeed, every baby in the deep, dark, old valley had Feminist Studies 22, no. 2 (summer 1996). ? 1996 by Feminist Studies, Inc. 387</page><page sequence="2">Su Fidler Cowling been born in. You might as well mention the rain crow, the ghost train, deep and natural sorrow. But why get into it? She was long gone now. She'd quit telling that story a long time ago. She'd read a book on how to quit telling that story.) At five minutes before noon, she locked her beeper and ID inside her office, notified her secretary, Mr. Alvarez, that she would be unreachable for the full lunch hour, and rode the ele- vator down to the seldom-used public restroom on the four- teenth floor, where she took off her jacket, blouse, and skirt, and stuffed them into her backpack. She put on her jeans, huaraches, her grey t-shirt with no message. She unpinned and shook out her hair, which used to be very dark but now was graying, which always looked tangled when she let it loose even after all these years. She looked in the glaringly clean mirror just long enough to confirm that she was fully clothed, but not long enough to see ghosts; she meant the change nei- ther as a disguise nor as a deconstruction, she was just trying to get comfortable. She rode the elevator on down to the lobby and walked out the front doors directly on to Public Square with its summer weekday buzz and a damp, grey chill hanging in the air which had not been there this morning. She paused on the top step to survey the Hiroshima Day crowd, locate her group. She saw horses; she heard creek water flowing over rocks. Sort it out. Some of the horses were alive, and these were the police mounts standing at the periphery of the gathering; the others were bronze, the nearly life-size statues of the Sol- diers and Sailors Monument at the center of the Square. She saw a cloud of scruffy sparrows rise with a whiff at the sound of a squeal from a PA speaker and drop down atop a bronze, larger-even-than-life bald eagle. She let her eye run past the Monument, skip over traffic, over the wide, crowded, hard, and chilly sidewalk, and climb up the side of the Terminal Tower to the ledge outside the insurance office on the fourteenth floor to see whether the nesting box was still here where the Wildlife people had planted it. It was. She could see the box, although not the peregrines who lived there. Back down on the side- walk, she saw the old sax man, and she saw five lawyers sta- tioned outside the Tower's elegant brass doors-five black suits, five pairs of black sunglasses, lean and inanimate men, smok- 388</page><page sequence="3">Su Fidler Cowling ing, one at each of the five old stone ashtrays. Finally she saw Mr. Willard waving at her over beside the fountain. (Her current theory about this phenomenon, her difficulty in discerning humans in a landscape, involved studies on the na- ture of seeing which concluded that there was more to seeing than what met the eye, that there was also expectation, ethos, early experience; apparently if a cat is kept from seeing forms during its first four months of life, then it will be blind to forms forever, good light and good vision notwithstanding. Actual award-winning, professional scientists say this is so.) Mr. Willard, who had reserved a bench for their group by de- ploying his boxes of leaflets on one end and the Chief on the other, winked at K.B. as she approached. He tweaked her arm and whispered into her ear, "The misses thinks I'm over at the saloon, you know." He said this same thing at every event and did not require a response. He selected a poster board for her on which "Never Again" had been printed in bold strokes by the new committee member who apparently had a flair. K.B. hung it around her neck by its string and said, "What's with this weather, Mr. Willard? August, and it feels like November, doesn't it? You cold?" The joke was, Mr. Willard wore the same canvas coat and hunting cap with earflaps all year round. In winter he added a scarf and rubber boots and complained mischievously of the heat. His glassy eyes ran, he disregarded random patches when he shaved, he was missing significant teeth. K.B. imag- ined him young and sassy, tall and wiry, a flirty boy her Aunt Pink would have called, suspiciously, "one long drink of water." Now he was an old paper straw, chewed and bent and smelling a tad sour. The PA system screeched as the microphone changed hands on the platform which had been erected between the fountain plaza and the Soldiers and Sailors Monument. The sound caused the crowd to ebb momentarily backwards, which star- tled the Chief, prompting him to sigh and rise to his feet. Mr. Willard sat him back down, patting his shoulder, saying, "Looky here, Chief. Looky here." The Chief was bald with pasty skin on a flattened face, clumsy with placards, had not spoken a word since his first day at Grant Elementary twenty-some years ago, except of 389</page><page sequence="4">Su Fidler Cowling course for the one phrase to be mentioned later. Mr. Willard rummaged in his leaflet box for a baseball score sheet, which he handed to the Chief along with a freshly sharpened pencil. The score sheet was blank except for where Mr. Willard had penciled in "Cleveland Indians versus Minnesota Twins, July 3, 1968." The Chief frowned at it a moment, then licked the pencil lead, got down to business. Mr. Willard winked at K.B. again, saying, "I got him this time. Most forgettable game I ever saw. Half the lineup was just up from the farm to fill in during the flu epidemic and nev- er played again." Then, peeking over the Chiefs hunched shoulder, he added, "Judas be durned." The Chief, humming a little, had already started filling in names on the roster. K.B. fetched a roll of black grosgrain and the scissors from the box. She cut a few lengths and tied one around Mr. Wil- lard's sleeve and one around her own arm. She stepped up on to the top of the low granite wall which surrounded the plaza fountain-the fountain being an arrangement of granite steps with clean clear water flowing down them into a pool where lit- ter accumulated and pigeons drank-and tied one around the sleeve, with a smile, of the new member, who was standing up there for the view over the heads of the crowd. The woman's clear suburban eyes were sparkling; her cheeks were unnatu- rally smooth. She whispered, nodding toward the tiny man now speaking on the platform, "It's thrilling to see him in per- son, isn't it?" K.B. smiled, by way of reply, then walked along the top of the wall to stand next to Helene, who already had a ribbon on her sleeve, who was the Chiefs mother and called him Louis. Helene greeted her as usual with the headcount, "I estimate six hundred people so far, maybe seven." "Really?" K.B. took another look and began to see them. Women in suits, men in ceremonial beards and yarmulkes, the small cadre of opposition with their distorted faces, glowering, angry, and their placards reading "6 Million Lies!" A group of schoolgirls wearing blue kilts, a band of big men from the con- struction on Superior Avenue swaggering in their brown cover- alls and cocksure, good-natured disdain and carrying gyros. ACT UP was here, the flower vender, the blind man who came to everything and stood very still in the middle of the sound 390</page><page sequence="5">Su Fidler Cowling with his brown dog. K.B.'s gaze scaled the side of the Tower to the peregrine nest again. Now she could see the two babies up there on the ledge peeping down at the rally. These baby birds had been serenaded while still in the egg by no less than the Cleveland Orchestra which, as part of its traditional Fourth of July concert on the Square, had played the Brahms Lullaby in their honor. When the eggs hatched the following day, the babies were christened Stars and Stripes, heralded as full-fledged, first-generation citizens of Public Square, and the Plain Dealer ran the birth announcement on its front page. Naturally, a video camera had been installed on the ledge. On monitors just inside the Tower doors, next to the muffin cart, one could observe, in both taped and real time, the adult peregrines feeding the chicks pieces of the recently living flesh of rats, pigeons, doves. (Mourning doves. Six hundred miles to the south, Granny called them rain crows.) When K.B. had first heard from Mr. Alvarez that this was go- ing to happen-that a male peregrine was living on the Tower ledges and that the Wildlife people had come up with a scheme to bring him a bride equipped with nesting box, expecting to then see nature take its course among the Tower's gargoyles and office windows-she'd laughed; she'd assumed Mr. Alvarez was joking again. Later, the first ten or fifteen times she peered up there or checked the monitor on her way through the Tower, she couldn't help thinking of home, of crows. Crows-sleek and black in the tops of the trees, calling, swooping, chasing low and fast through the dark levels of the woods; cocky, impatient, birds who existed with such aplomb that their passing shad- ows could cause fallen leaves to rustle. She couldn't help think- ing that the crows-which as a rule she would not demean with anthropomorphism-would regard the peregrines as Darwinian wimps and ignore them. People, though, relished the drama, or so the local media believed. A couple times a week, there would be some TV person earnestly interviewing some Nana or Opa who had brought kids for a glimpse of nature which was more real, somehow, for being downtown and on video. The muffin cart, incidentally, was doing record business. (Granny said, "You tell that little brother of yours I said to quit shooting at them rain birds or something bad will happen 391</page><page sequence="6">Su Fidler Cowling to him." "Like what?" '"You tell him I said his great uncle Jay Harry killed a rain bird and ate it one time. Pretty soon every time he opened his mouth, only thing to come out would be that moaning noise them birds make." "Is that true, Granny?" "True ain't what matters, mebbe. Now you go wake up your Uncle Jack; his supper's ready.") When her gaze fell back down to the sidewalk in front of the Terminal Tower, she saw the lawyer-named Jacobs, Jacobi, something like that-come striding out the wide front doors, then pause to redistribute his load: two leather cases, a stack of note pads, and a cardboard take-out tray full of cups and bagels. Finally he was able to get his lips to the straw in the chocolate milk carton which was also on the tray and take a sip. Mr. Alvarez had been trying unsuccessfully since Monday to reach this young man to get a simple, straight-forward yes or no on a few points. That is, he had been trying to reach this actual young man, not his shiny new E-mail, voice mail, fax, etc. "These up-and-comers these days, their white teeth and machines," Mr. Alvarez seethed. "They get their electronic stand-ins; pretty soon they won't have to be anywhere at all." "I'll be right back," she said to Helene, who nodded, handed her some leaflets to pass out, and said, '"You look chilly. There's my jacket." K.B. picked up the jacket-Helene's FRANKIES FRUIT AND FRIES uniform-and put it on as she hurried around the edge of the crowd, shoving leaflets into open hands as she passed by. She crossed the street against a surge of tattooed waifs with placards reading "Free Sharon Roth," dug into her jeans pocket for a dollar bill to drop into the sax man's case since she was going to have to pass by him to get to Jacobi who was now peering at headlines in the sidewalk vending box while still sipping at his chocolate milk and occasionally glancing around first at the traffic light and then at the clock on the Tower as if waiting for someone, and she remembered she hadn't brought any cash. She rummaged in the pockets of the jacket but found only a wrapper, a movie stub, her own scissors, and grosgrain. The sax man wouldn't mind if she had to skip him this time, probably. But she would mind. She always dropped a dollar in, coming and going, always. He was always there and had been there forever, according to everybody she knew, plus the re- 392</page><page sequence="7">Su Fidler Cowling porter who wrote the Plain Dealer's annual investigation of Public Square vendors, beggars, and musicians. The sax man had been leaning against the monolithic black cornerstone of the Tower since before it turned black, playing the blues, never mind tornadoes and fires and deadly freezes and holocausts, both real and political, playing the blues through youth to prime and beyond, from war to war, inhaling the fumes and grime and blowing it back out as blues, taking in enough quar- ters and bills to raise a family. Now that he was old, he seemed to play for other reasons, if not for free. Now that his emphyse- ma was bad, he blew only the first few measures of a tune, just enough to get it started, then he'd lower his sax and listen, eyes closed and head bowed, while the traffic and wind played the rest of it. ("There's the train," Jarvis would say and spit into the dark, and Uncle Bill would glance at his watch. You'd hear it once or twice a month, always at dusk, the long lonesome whistle of the Gauley train. The thing was, there hadn't been a train on the Gauley for fifty years or more, not since the loggers moved on and left the tracks to rust, buckle, grow vines. But never mind. Everybody knew it wasn't there, and everybody heard it anyway. In all her years of hearing the train and of listening to talk in the kitchen, in the next room, in the cold evening shad- ows in the yard, K.B. had never heard anybody try to explain it or even remark that it was strange.) She gave the sax man a nod and hurried on past him to- ward the lawyer, who spotted her and glanced away. He didn't recognize her. Seeing only the tangled grey hair and orange FRANKIES uniform when he looked at her, he looked else- where, glanced at the traffic light, at the sudden shouting on the fountain plaza. K.B. also glanced over there-the red geraniums in concrete planters, a scuffle and squeal, the cops' orange slickers-and glanced back at this lawyer. And it came to her suddenly and clearly what needed to be done about him. Right here, right now, or lose the chance perhaps forever. She stepped abruptly into his space, taking care not to jostle or cause him to drop his burden of cases and cups, grabbed his sleeve and laid her cold glinting scissors against the material of his lapel. She said, in the whispery, dank, old river accent 393</page><page sequence="8">Su Fidler Cowling she'd worked so hard to lose, "I'm watching you, boy. I want to see you go offer that old man with the saxophone a bagel, you hear me? You understand me? I'm watching you, I mean it." Before he could react, she turned and ran back across the street, zig-zagged through a clutch of perfumed women carry- ing handfuls of origami doves, on around to the north side of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument which she entered. The damp, dark innards of the Monument amounted to a black granite cell lined with bronze plaques showing the names of lo- cal boys who died, quaintly but nobly, in the Civil War. It was empty as always except for a pale volunteer on a wooden chair who nodded at K.B. as she strode on through, gathering back her hair as she went, braiding and tying it with a black ribbon, taking off the jacket and tucking it under her arm, and exited the south door, which put her behind the speakers' platform. She wound through the crowd and stepped back up on to the top of the fountain wall beside Helene. Making a quick check, she found that, yes, her heart was racing, yes, she must have been out of her mind, yes, bad things would happen if the young lawyer recognized her in hindsight and told certain peo- ple. But never mind. People were pointing up at the peregrine nest. The two ba- bies, still peering down from their ledge, had begun hopping from toe to toe. One was lifting and lowering his wings, shak- ing them out, up and down, up down. Hop hop, up down. The PA system squealed, and fifty people or more shushed it. Someone on the platform directed the attention of the speaker, a political preacherwoman, to the ledge. The preacherwoman herself then pointed up there in a grand sweeping gesture, which caused the PA to squeal again. Two hundred people said, "Shush!" The first baby peregrine hopped off the ledge. It flitted its wings at first without effect, tipping over twice, but then it flew. It flew over the crowd to the roof of the Soldiers and Sailors Monument where it landed unsteadily, stumbled, but seemed to be OK, Everybody turned back toward the Tower. The second baby hopped off the ledge and sank like a rock. It fell two, three, four stories, and finally it shuddered, skidded in mid-air, began flapping toward the Monument. Then it tipped wing over wing and stopped, in the air. Like a caught 394</page><page sequence="9">Su Fidler Cowling breath, it stopped still for the smallest moment. Then it found the breeze-or the breeze found it-and it began to soar, circling over the heads of the crowd, sweeping over the Square. The other baby joined it up there. And so it was that almost every eye was directed skyward when the usually mute Chief lunged to his feet, waved his just- completed score sheet in the air and crowed, "Indians win! In- dians win! Indians win!" Mr. Willard caught K.B.'s eye and winked. The shouting re- leased the crowd from its churchy hush, and someone whooped, and finally they all gave the babies a hand, 2,000 hands clap- ping, hot dog vendors and blind guys and cops and incidentals, everyone all clapping and grinning together. K.B. caught sight of the young lawyer, who had now been joined on the corner by two very expensive ensembles, his em- ployers, who had placed their food and cases atop the newspa- per vending box in order to free their hands for clapping. K.B. watched as young Jacobi realized that there was no longer enough room atop the box for his own things. With a glance at the Monument, he reached out and placed his bagel and milk tray inside the sax man's case, then stacked his cases and note pads at his own feet, and straightened himself back up, clap- ping, with a vague smile at the boss. K.B. thought she heard the Gauley train but decided to ig- nore it. Helene was staring, not at the birds, but at the Monu- ment. This was what Helene sometimes did, stared into a dis- tance too dark and far to follow, sometimes at the thin, brave, bronze Soldiers and Sailors with their tattered bronze flag, as if trying to see with their eyes, which did not exist and never had. The sculptor had indicated sight by leaving the eye sock- ets empty, even in the horses. K.B. pulled the black ribbon off her braid and tied it around Helene's arm on top of the ribbon that was already there. She said, "I was mugged, sort of, a couple months after I first moved here. I told you that story, right?" Helene nodded and quit staring at the Monument. K.B. went on, "I was stand- ing in line at the money machine when this old woman with wild grey hair and a black cape comes riding up on a bicycle and runs right into me. I fall down, she snatches up my sack of groceries, and rides off with it. After the horror wore off, I was 395</page><page sequence="10">396 Su Fidler Cowling thrilled. I felt like I was finally part of the local ecosystem. I didn't feel quite so lonely after that. I felt, I don't know-." "Visible. You felt visible. You've told me that story ten times. Is it true?" "Visible. Thanks. I felt visible." She grinned, shrugged, glanced over the Square once again, seeing sparrows and Nazis and perfume counter clerks eating tacos, thought she saw a crow on a gargoyle on the sixteenth floor, but never mind. She traded Helene the FRANKIES jacket for another stack of leaflets, and she smiled again. "It gets truer every time I tell it. You see me, don't you? You do see me, don't you?"</page></plain_text>
