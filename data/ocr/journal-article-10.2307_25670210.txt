<plain_text><page sequence="1">HERMANN DEUSER Translated by Cathrine Lincoln and Ulrich Lincoln Is There a Metaphysics of Community? A Continental Perspective on American Philosophy I. INTRODUCTION 1. When in the sense of this theme, metaphysics is under discussion, I under stand, following Charles Peirce an experiential science (RSII. 13, pp. 249ff.; cf. CP 6.Iff.; CP 6.2Hff.).1 It differs from other sciences only insofar as it gains insight from daily phenomena, our accessibility to which has become much more difficult since we are no longer accustomed to perceiving such phenomena in a primordial manner. This naturally scientific, phenomeno logical, in short, realistic interpretation of metaphysics should not consciously differentiate "neo-classical" or "neo-metaphysical" from the tradition of the ancient or medieval meaning. These older concepts are to be understood as historical forerunners of the experiential-scientific concept of metaphysics, and from this perspective are to be interpreted critically. When Peirce wrote in 1898, "The things that any science discovers are beyond the reach of direct observation_It is only the premises of science, not its conclusions, which are directly observed" (CP 6.2, p. 2; cf. RS 250), the following statements regarding this metaphysical concept were implied: (1) Distinctions are not made as if there were, on the one hand, science? which refers to verifiable empirical data and which in theory formulates potentially useful hypotheses?and, on the other hand, (traditional) meta physics, "in a deplorably backward condition" (CP 6.2, p. 1; cf. RS p. 249), relating to objects beyond human experience. (2) Metaphysics as a realistic experiential science supersedes the two fold approach to knowledge, which, especially in European theology, is di vided into a rational-natural and a superrational or supernatural knowledge (cf. Aquinas, Summa contra gentiles 1.3; Ratschow 1966, ? 15/16). (3) In this respect, it is not necessary to assume a specific supernatural objectivity. Dualism between an empirical and a nonempirical "metaphysi cal" world does not gain us any knowledge. THE JOURNAL OF SPECULATIVE PHILOSOPHY, Vol. XI, No. 2, 1997.

Determining the reality of concepts such as time, space, possibility, and truth is the task of metaphysics (CP 6.6). (5) Within the System of Science, metaphysics is therefore the third main discipline (MS 693, ? 11 [1904]; cf. 55 190), after phenomenology and the three normative sciences (aesthetics, ethics, and logic); that is to say, meta physics is preceded by a theory of categories and by semiotics. This rough orientation explains why we can ask at all if the concept of community involves a metaphysical meaning. For, if generally speaking it can be said, "Metaphysics has to account for the whole universe of being" (CP 6.214; cf. RS 255), this statement may also apply, in a specific sense, to the concept of community. This is especially so when experience shows that human beings are not limited by their own "narrow personalities," but are fully destined to "a life rooted in the very truth of being" when life is based upon and refers "to a definite and public experience" (CP 6.451 ["Religion and Politics" (1895)]; cf. RS 11.12, p. 248). 2. Concerning the theme's subtitle, both philosophical regions shall in turn be addressed. In an outline of the concept of community, it will be shown how the earlier European development of that notion has led to a new under standing and conceptualization in American philosophy. The general theme of this essay is that the concept of community in American philosophy? represented here by Charles Peirce and Josiah Royce?not only presupposes four preceding steps or aspects in the development of that concept, but inte grates them into a new notion that is in accordance with modern science. The four outlined steps or aspects awaiting development include the logical metaphysical concept of community (koivcovigc) of Plato, the ethical-social concept (&lt;piA(cc) of Aristotle, the metaphysical-cosmological concept ("ci vi tas") of Augustine, and the transcendental-ontological concept ("Organism") of Schleiermacher. n. THE LOGICAL-METAPHYSICAL CONCEPT In responding to the question in which way rest and movement, though oppos ing each other, still refer to the same entity (toov ), the discussion in Plato's Sophist (250b) stumbles over both the compelling differences and the com mon attributes or association of concepts. Obviously, rest and movement both share in being; they are to be observed, however, in light of their "com mon association with reality" (irpos tt\v t ouoiocs koivcov(ccv),2 although they remain distinguishable opposites (cf. 251 d-252d). The meaning of com mon association leads here to generic divisions (cf. 254b-c: koivcovigc tcov</page><page sequence="3">METAPHYSICS OF COMMUNITY 81 yevcbv), through which a comprehensible association is then able to evolve. The true logical task, then, must entail a precise documentation of respec tive associative possibilities while the metaphysical analysis aims to ex plore potential ontological implications, based on common conceptual asso ciations. In this regard, answers lead in two opposite directions. First, the metaphysical determination of Platonic ideas could, in the extreme, be to tally contested and reduced to its logical analysis; that is to say, an idea would be nothing other than a logical-operator, inevitably reducing to assumedly ideal basic concepts some pure theoretically assumed "objects," such as geometry's ideal circle or triangle (cf. MittelstraB 1985,46f.). In the other extreme, the highest idea must also have the highest degree of reality and the appropriateness of all concepts would, according to their (ranked) community, only be correctly determined in light of this supreme meaning. The question of how Plato's doctrine of ideas is finally to be understood does not have to be decided here. In the Sophist, however, the heart of the argument leads toward three explanations that can be shown: (1) "Granted that kinds are of a nature to admit combination with one another" (257a: exei KOivcoviav dXXr|Xoi9 &lt; tcov yevcbv &lt;puai$), genus classification then becomes possible, enabling effective differentiation be tween being at rest, in motion, sameness, and difference (cf. 254e-256b). (2) Under this condition of community of concepts, it can be shown that the idea of non-being by no means provokes a paradox with regard to the notion of being, as if non-being had to be comprehended as something, an entity that was at the same time negated. The negation of being is a differ ence in being, so to speak, a relative negation, not an absolute (cf. 257b 258e). That is, the community of concepts makes it possible to comprehend the participation of the 'what is not' in being (259a). (3) If it were otherwise, it would mean "to attempt to separate every thing from every other thing" (259d-e), creating the absurd picture of a world in which things would no longer relate, and even worse, such a principal sepa ration would be the end of speech (A6yo$) and with it the end of philosophy (259e-260a). At this stage I should point out that Peirce, through an analogous line of reasoning, will defend his philosophy of synechism. The question of an on tological range of ideas is accordingly neither, in the extreme, a nominalistic reduction to theoretical objects nor, in another extreme, an established su preme reality of being, existing for its own sake. Instead, the question is placed in the experientially and metaphysically accessible interspace of meanings of general concepts as effective in reality?semiotically speaking, in the actual meaning of interpretants (i.e., habits, rules, and laws).</page><page sequence="4">82 HERMANN DEUSER m. THE ETHICAL-SOCIAL CONCEPT Aristotle's theory of friendship (cpiAia) adheres to two conditions of his eth ics (Ethica Nicomachea):3 First, to the descriptive, cogent principle that all action in the end leads to a solitary goal, an end (t?Aos), namely, the Good (dyccBov), sought after "for its own sake" (cf. 1094a, 19:6 5f ccuto; 1097a, 31: 6 kcc0' auTo)?and ethically perceived as happiness (cf. 1097a, 34: euScciiiovia), as the life well-led. Second, there is the precondition of the polis as a community of residence, action, and law, as a natural association, only in which other persons, in the appropriate manner, are able to appeal to each other "since man is by nature a social being."4 Therefore, ethics does not determine the Good per se; rather, it searches for optimal realizations of these supreme goals within the framework of the (political) community: the abstract reveals itself in the place of the particu lar (cf. 1097a, 13: Ka0' ekcxgtov)?just as the physician's art of healing is directed toward the individual patient, so shall the Good successfully realize life's happiness for the individual. Friendship (cf. Ethica Nicomachea bk. VIII, IX; cf. Theunissen 1965, 492f.), then, is an outstanding example of an ethic derived from concern for both the individual and society, and as with friendship, that special relation ship based on love (as affection and benevolence), it has to be clearly shown, in pursuit of the ethical realization, why it is necessary to partake of a social life. According to the second condition of the polis, an analysis of friendship encompasses all natural and legal bonds of social and political life, for ex ample, the parent-child bond and the interdependence of business partners. But the specific nature of friendship can be determined only when, from the three reasons for every behavioral orientation?toward the good, toward the useful, and toward the pleasurable (cf. 1155b, 19f.: dyccSov, xPHaiUov, &lt;8ovr|)?the once-again-dominating function of the good for its own sake elects to subordinate the useful and the pleasurable. This can be demon strated in the following steps: (1) There are friendships based on pleasure; there are friendships based on mutual utility; but the true and highest form?which does not exclude pleasure and utility, but instead includes them?is friendship of the good people for their own sake;5 that is, the ethical telos is no longer outside them. Only when goodness and happiness are capable of expressing both a relationship's mutuality and its desired goal does friendship exist as friend ship in the highest sense of its meaning. (2) But why is this ethical good and happiness to be found only in rela tionships? To Aristotle, this sociability, due to conditions of the polis, is really just a matter of course, and therefore in the beginning he defends his position just by addressing actual social life; above all, this highest rung in</page><page sequence="5">METAPHYSICS OF COMMUNITY 83 the realization of goodness and happiness ought not be allowed to fade away (cf. 1157b, 19ff.). However, the main reason for sociability lies with the mutual standards of sociality and friendship;6 that is, sociality evolves from the polis.7 From the ethical conditions of sociability follows that special re alization in friendship (cf. 1161b, 11). (3) Because of the good's supreme destiny, however, friendship is surely not just a natural diversion of the social; it is, rather, the direct embodiment of it. It is the 91X10 that is, as the ultimate and deciding integrator of life's goals and ends in friendship, the human for the sake of the human (cf. 1166a, 2: TTpos egcutov). Only with these goal-oriented requirements can the ac tual human, the dianoetic capacity for judgment be capable of self-knowl edge and active presentation (cf. 1166a, 15ff; 1178a, 6ff.). (4) At this juncture, the conclusion is really compelling: this highest form of community, namely, friendship, would have no realization at all if the individual remained alone with his/her happiness. Just as the nature of the polis is the enabling of social forms (to which they owe their existence), the nature of friendship is the capacity for expressing the supreme human good and happiness, not in solitude, but in concrete common living (au?*v).8 Again, I want to point out in regard to this model that the function of love as an ethical-social mediation portrayed here can, to a certain extent, be found in Peirce's concept of agapism. Descriptive ethics according to Aristotle is, at first sight, certainly in no need of metaphysical generalization, and he consistently and emphatically criticizes the Platonic concept of the idea of the good (cf. 1096a, 17-1097a, 14). The essence of the realized good life in friendship, understood as community, is, however, a great deal more than the mere description of an existing society. Not only the binding force of love for the community, but also its developmental capacity for the continu ing realization of objectives must be scrutinized if community as a principle of reality in general is to be understood. IV. THE METAPHYSICAL-COSMOLOGICAL CONCEPT Augustine's latest major work, De civitate dei (413-426 a.d.),9 appears at a time when the Roman empire is near collapse (cf. Duchrow 1983, 247ff.) after the conquest of Rome by the Goths (410 a.d.). Thus, neither the ancient polis nor the Roman state, self-represented as city and as divine emperor, is able to go unquestioned, symbolizing legal, social, and governmental condi tions of morality and sociability. This loss of confidence is a major motif in Augustine's historical portrayal of both civitates. His apology of Christian ity in the face of accusations that it decidedly contributed to Rome's decline is a second motif; and a third motif is, of course, the late Doctrine of Grace10</page><page sequence="6">84 HERMANN DEUSER according to which condemnation and redemption, hopelessness and the meaning of life, guilt and forgiveness, make all men dependent on an eternal decree of the biblical God in his ecclesiastical representation. Augustine's perception of history, with its demythologized sobriety in which he has to diagnose human history in its decay, stands at the beginning, not only of the European Middle Ages, but of the European Spirit. Human history and community is a trial from which philosophical or theological self-transcendence no longer yields redemption.11 In the historical and so cial present, both civitates (the civitas terrena and the civitas dei)12 are inter woven, and it becomes impossible to assess on the grounds of extrinsic data by way of human understanding, to which community the individual sub jects belong, or of which they count themselves as members. The decision about social affiliation (civitas) and the truth about one's own life recedes, as something divine, into the farthest distance; yet, human beings now be come more and more conscious of the fact that they have to be, and must decide to be, members of one of the two communities. This decision process bears with it responsibility, which in turn is the universal horizon of both civitates, both civitates being, in turn, mutually exclusive. This decisional horizon is cosmological and at the same time metaphysical (in the new Platonic/Christian sense): (1) Seen mythologically, that is, by consistently adopting the biblical cre ation narratives, and along with them a conscious correction of the ancient philosophical and Manichaean-religious traditions, Augustine sees both civi tates based on the difference between the Angels of Light and the Angels of Darkness; and this difference in turn is traced to the creational differentia tion between light and darkness (Gen. 3,4; cf. De civitate XI, 7, and 9; XI, 32 and 33). God's good creation (Gen. 1, 31) is marked by a contradiction that as such cannot be a direct product of that goodness. To that extent, there is no causa efficiens given for the origin of evil, and the "place" where this can be conceivably and empirically demonstrated is the will.13 Turning one's back on the original union with God and embracing (the ontologically lower) self-empowerment,14 is an act of volition that determines the orientation of the affections15 and seals the collective affiliation with the sancta societas, or, with a defection from it.16 (2) Now there is a difference between angels and humans, and, after the fall, all men, at first, will be assumed to have been under the subjugation of an evil will. Through God's mercy, however, the chosen ones will end their time counted with the Angels of Light (cf. XII, 22, 23). Until then, there is a state of mixture and trial in the created world where, from a human perspec tive, the civitas dei, within the civitas terrena, appears obscured and am biguous. From God's perspective, the truth of the civitas dei?since the ere</page><page sequence="7">METAPHYSICS OF COMMUNITY 85 ation of man and the subsequent fall?has given itself to the history of hu mankind in such a way that this actual history, in principle, reads universally and consistently as the struggle between truth and falsehood, good and evil, true happiness and pseudo-happiness. The model of the two civitates con ceived by Augustine is a theory of truth insofar as a view into the duality of both opposing civitates can, in turn, originate only from the truth of the civitates dei; that is, Augustine's Christian philosophy needs the cosmologi cal metaphysics of both civitates for the sake of the knowledge of truth. (3) Concerning this possible knowledge of truth of mankind, there is the difference that, unlike the creation of animals according to species, man at first appears in history as a solitary creature, yet as one who, from the begin ning on, was predisposed to community, sociability, and harmony.17 This is why?from the perspective of the civitas dei?essentially a destination in, and a tendency toward union under conditions of plurality (unitas in pluribus) belongs to man.There exists a dual-purposed form of community19 in which the individual person is not thought of as over against the community?or vice versa; rather, the conditio humana, typologically assembled in Adam, is essentially twofold in regard to the Pauline opposition of secundum carnem and secundum spiritum. That is to say, in spite of all human-social diversity, only these two societies prevail.20 This doubling is exclusive as with truth and falsehood and corresponds to the volitional decisions secundum hom inem and secundum Deum,21 or to that between amor sui and amor Dei re spectively.22 The constitutive principle of community is accordingly the re lationship to truth, or to falsehood, and only in this connection does the question about the individual arise: whether he or she within her structure of determining relations, within her emotional life, and within her intentional determinations is either self-engrossed or continually open in the face of the humanly noncontrollable truth. (4) Certainly Augustine himself, apologetically and during his time of life, was burdened with this contradiction, often with dual tendencies: between the (bad) world and the hereafter's (good) world, between the devil and God, and so on. It is crucial, however, that Augustine arrives at a biblical-cosmo logical, as well as a neoplatonic-metaphysical, distinction that can neither debase the natural world as such (biblically unacceptable23) nor identify fac tual history with the civitas dei (cf. Duchrow 1983,264ff.), not even the his tory of the church. Consequently, the earthly human life is analyzed without any illusions (cf. XIX, 4). The vita socialis and humana societas (cf. XIX, 5 [669, 1-9]) are not capable of essential happiness and peace on their own,24 but the bad and the false is recognizable at the place of the good and the true.25 This is why man-made social forms26 move, thanks to the cosmologi cal-metaphysically conceived doubling of both civitates, in a perspective of</page><page sequence="8">86 HERMANN DEUSER truth that, from the point of view of the civitas dei toward man on earth, holds that the realistic measure of worldly and human relationships ought no longer allow for overestimation?if this perspective of good and peace were only observed. The mark of a correct perspective, of the true community is the clear distinction between uti and frui. In human forms of community (within the household, in society, in the state), all things are to be used prag matically (uti), not valued for their own sake. But enjoyment (frui) exists only for the sake of truth and belongs to the civitas dei (cf. XIX, 17; cf. Kreuzer 1995,127f.). Just as Aristotle could define friendship as a good for its own sake, so Augustine feels about the civitas dei?and it alone.27 Knowl edge of truth of this community is in every way soaked in experience and yet this truth is not so easily extrapolated from empirical-historical circumstances. When we question this cosmological-metaphysical conception in transi tion from ancient to Christian philosophy up to the current day, and ask about the strongest impressions and indispensable insights, everything re volves around a single point: the double perspective of community as founded in Augustine's discovery of history between the creational beginning and the divine end. Whereas the ancient cyclical doctrines (of the cosmos and its history) wanted to ensure divine sovereignty directly by arguing that be tween God and creation, between beginning and end, no differences due to actual development could be thinkable,28 Augustine counters this cyclical cosmology with the argument that God alone can be and must be so concep tualized that to him everything?including the unlimited and the new?is comprehensible and at the same time the order of things remains preserved.29 The creation in the beginning becomes the embodiment of actual possibili ties, which include nature and the material world, actual history and its de velopment, and the spiritual world.30 If the historically new cannot be kept from God, but rather belongs to the concept of God, then only at the end of history is the full truth revealed. In this sense the civitas dei represents the true community of the cosmological-metaphysical perspective of God that, in the process of the civitas terrena, experiences its conflict-filled present. The hereafter and the end of time in the true community is the unmythologized view of the suffering of the present time and of its deficit of goodness and truth.31 Is there such a sociality of eschatological truth without cosmology? This crucial question is taken up again in Peirce's evolutionary metaphysics in which the modern concept of process can be combined with the categorical ly reasoned three-step model of beginning, end, and present time?an idea whose semiotic, trinitarian structure32 does not have to draw on mythical worlds for its justification; neither does it need to rationalize away mythical common sense or its anthropomorphic power forcibly.</page><page sequence="9">METAPHYSICS OF COMMUNITY 87 V. THE TRANSCENDENTAL-ONTOLOGICAL CONCEPT Schleiermacher's Ethics (1812/13)33 is based on the difference between the two basic sciences, ethics and physics?and sees both once again, based on their undifferentiation, in "absolute knowledge."34 This latter origin of unity and distinction in the sciences from Schleiermacher's Dialektik shall be de scribed as a transcendental condition. The division of reality with regard to the two basic sciences is the ontological meaning of Schleiermacher's eth ics: What really is?in both the problematical as well as the given relation of reason (aspect: ethics) and nature (aspect: physics)?can always be looked upon either as having been or as an expectant will be, a process of organic wholeness?5 There is an ambivalent concept of community lying at the heart of this ethical theory that proceeds explicitly, not in a deontological, but rather in a descriptive way, and it must, in conjunction with the basic conclu sions of this model, be more precisely elaborated. (1) Schleiermacher makes use of the logical-metaphysical meaning of the concept of community (see section 2, above) when he sees the actual anti thesis of reason and nature as "mediated in community with the absolute" {Ethics 13, nr. 63).36 Between the transcendental requirement for uniformity and the factual opposition in the actualization of such differentiated unifor mity there stands the common order of origin and representation, of inner impulse and manifestation, of continuity during change, of one in many.37 (2) However, the genuine continuum of ethics is the actual "bond of rea son with nature" within history (cf. Ethics 11, nr. 50). Here the process of fairly describing active, ethical relationships requires an inside view of com munity formation. Schleiermacher centers his descriptive ethics around the concept of the organism: the intertwining of nature and reason is the defini tion of the organic whole {Ethics 15, nr. 80; cf. 13, nr. 65).38 That is to say, the vital and active forms of community39 (friendships, sociability, family, nation, state, church) are the ones for which natural conditions are purposely arranged?an arrangement that in turn evokes marked changes in those very conditions. This growth is to be understood as organic, its foundation em bedded in the meaning of community in Schleiermacher's Aristotelian tradi tion (cf. Moxter 1992, 174ff.). (3) Indeed, the organic forms of community so described implicate to gether more than what is just given within themselves. The purpose of the respective organization {Ethics 7, nr. 17) is the attainment of wholeness, not just a collection or an aggregate but rather a totality {Ethics 8, nr. 23; cf. Moxter 1992,106). In this way the concept of community displays its quasi objective, institutional, preordained side. The realizations of communal forms present purposes as ends in themselves, and, for this reason, their tendency is toward unity and totality, not mere aggregation.</page><page sequence="10">88 HERMANN DEUSER (4) Thus, it is significant when the concept of personality is used not as an independent concept, but as one relative to an affinity for the community (Ethicsl,m. 17;21,nr. 18; 25, ? I69passim). The general purpose of commun ities does not lie with personality. Should community be generalized once again, only the "human race," as the higher form, would be considered (Eth ics 33, ? 73).40 (5) However, the interplay of personality and community can be under stood in two basic forms: organizing and symbolizing (Ethics 14, nr. 74; 15, nr. 78; 23, ? If.).41 Organizing embodies the shaping growth of the organic whereas symbolizing contains that constantly accompanying spur toward per formance, toward representation through signs (Moxter 1992, 59f, follow ing Peirce). Here, the full complexity of this concept of community is felt: the natural aspect of the organic growth of reason within history is marked not only by outward actions and their connections (organizing), but, in the same course of action, by presentational functions (e.g., knowledge, percep tion, self-understanding) that effect organic development. Conversely, presen tations originate from and with the organizing act, representing its very ideas and purposes. Schleiermacher is able to state in his conclusion: "Every or gan is conjointly a symbol" (Ethics 19, nr. 6). In this way, the process of form ing a community is here analyzable, appropriately and completely: in "rela tive being-set-for-itself, and being-set-within-community" (Ethics 19, nr. 5). Schleiermacher's community ethics show, in the discussion with compet ing systems of German Idealism, direct connections to ancient philosophy. The cosmological-metaphysical connection in the tradition of Augustine was, however, interrupted by the Reformation and by the new, theoretical scien tific situation following Kant's critique of metaphysical cosmologies. Their function is carried out indirectly through the transcendental foundation and the union of ethics and physics; nevertheless, except in the practice of reli gion, the community of feeling dominates far more than all cosmological con texts (Schleiermacher, Der christliche Glaube ? 6,2). However, even in the practice of religion, it can be shown that an inherent "consciousness of race" presses all men to take up the "data of other personalities in one's own." "Feeling" is describable in the changeover from inner to outer, that is, as presentation.*2 It is this discovery of semiotic structural elements of commu nity that allows Schleiermacher's ethics to appear in a new light and submits to proof its essential achievement at the beginning of the nineteenth century. VI. AMERICAN PHILOSOPHY AND METAPHYSICS OF COMMUNITY (PEIRCE AND ROYCE) From the perspective of Continental, and especially of the German develop ment of philosophy in the nineteenth century, it is quite astonishing, that,</page><page sequence="11">METAPHYSICS OF COMMUNITY 89 through Josiah Royce around the turn of the century, metaphysics in the tradition of the Enlightenment and German Idealism is still being proposed at all. There are two important reasons why this may not be seen as simply an anachronism. First, Royce is part of a cultural context essentially marked by American Protestantism, whose academic public isn't determined?as was typical in Europe at the end of the nineteenth century?by an assumedly excluding antithesis of methodic (positivistic and antimetaphysical) spirit of science and state-church traditionalism.43 Second, it is exactly the intentional advancement of Christianity, as well as that of the metaphysical tradition in the concept of community of interpretation (cf. Royce [1913] 1968, 315), which, in Royce's Idealism, presents itself in a special light, and in this way nothing in the Continental philosophy of its time can run parallel.44 The at tempt to understand, within a systematic model, the philosophy of the abso lute?mediated by mathematical models of infinity and by Peirce's categorial and semiotic thirdness?to understand anew, as metaphysics of the commu nity, is an essential characteristic of American philosophy at the beginning of the twentieth century. Without now being able to discuss in detail the philosophical systematics of Peirce and Royce, we can, on the basis of the four proposed classic mod els of the concept of community, deepen our understanding of this unique American philosophy. At the same time, this new, yet-to-be-formulated task of metaphysics will be made more explicit in the concluding reflections. (1) Community, purely as a social or sociological phenomenon might well be an occasion, but is not a sufficient reason, for a metaphysics of commu nity. Plato's and Aristotle's promotion and proof of friendship,45 mutual love, and benevolence will move beyond the status of description only when the conceptual consistency itself calls for those forms of sociability. That is to say, a logical-metaphysical meaning of the concept of community (as in that Platonic use of speech in the first model [see section 2, above]) must be able to bond with the social phenomenon of love (as in the Aristotelian model of friendship [see section 3, above]) in order to gain metaphysical significance. That is exactly what Peirce undertakes when, with the concept of synechism (1892)?not denying the natural philosophical tradition of "Concord Tran scendentalism," but integrating mathematics with knowledge from the hard sciences?he tries to understand the continuity of ideas in their infinitesimal correlations (with regard to space and time) as in "The Law of Mind" (EP 312-33,313; cf. CP 6.103; NZ180; cf. CP 7.565; RS 203). This regularity of the spirit does not render individuality absolute; rather, in the evolutionary concept of love,46 its social tendencies must be assumed to be a principle of relative discontinuity?understanding that is already an implication of synechism.</page><page sequence="12">90 HERMANN DEUSER (2) The fact that Aristotle doesn't have to justify the agapism in his doc trine of friendship directly in terms of47 metaphysics is built on the premise of the sociability of the polis preceding the sociability of love. However, Aristotelian metaphysics, with its crucial aspect, "for its own sake" (see sec tion 3, above), defining true friendship, still does play a part in this concep tion of community. It remains however problematic to want to establish a specific (so-called metaphysical) reality out of this beyond-purpose-and-plea sure ideality. Royce was certainly aware of this traditional path being barred by modern criticism and finally by Kant's transcendental philosophy. Here lies the first reason why Royce's philosophy of community has to reach back into Peirce's formal (categorial and semiotic) structural concept of ihirdness, that is, the triad (Royce 1968, chap. 11,14). Royce's deduction of the third category of interpretation, seen as the intellectual foundation of all other perceptions, insights, and actions, establishes the independence of a basic metaphysical concept with which "a being insofar as it is being"48 will be determined, or in the words of Peirce himself: "Metaphysics has to ac count for the whole universe of being" (CP 6.214; cf. RS 255). (3) For Royce, the specific justification of the community of interpreta tion appears in itself inconsistent49 mainly because this "spiritual unity of our community" ([1913] 1968,317), which Royce himself had conceived as an independent reality, has to be understood as a nonempirical, foundational reality in the sense of idealism or the theory of self-consciousness. It is true that the plurality of individual intentions shall be justified not as a mere aggregate, but as a new, ideal reality. But as long as this reality is developed only from a social perspective, the situation will be similar to Aristotle's metaphysical independence as a condition of the polis (which then does not need any foundation in the social phenomenon of friendship)?or, as with Royce, there is the threat of a circular argument. That is, what is to be proven in examples of social behavior has already to be presupposed in the sociality of human experience.50 To put it a little differently, Royce's return to Peirce's theory of categories and semiotics is problematic because he interprets both of them metaphysically without paying attention to the status of metaphys ics in Peirce's classification of sciences?after mathematics, phenomenol ogy, and semiotics.51 (4) By understanding his concept of metaphysics as an interpretation of Christian tradition, that is, as an intentional advancement of the "teaching of the early Christian community" ([1913] 1968,76), Royce saw from the out set that the metaphysical status of community cannot be presented simply sociologically. With his conceptualization of Loyalty and the Beloved Com munity (318), a quasi-cosmological horizon is erected under which, just as in Augustine's view, a decision between true and false society shall finally</page><page sequence="13">METAPHYSICS OF COMMUNITY 91 be reached. But at this point, too, the difference from Peirce becomes obvi ous. Whereas Royce, within the framework of an eschatological beloved community (civitas dei),53 wants to lay ground for both a metaphysical and a scientific concept of reality, Peirce first makes use of cosmological dimen sions for his concept of the "community of inquirers," combined with the process idea, "in the long run" (cf. Raposa 1989, 12f., 98f., 103f.; DeMarco 1971). With this scientific justification of cosmology, religious metaphysics can be reclassified as an analogous phenomenon valued for itself. Peirce does not deal with traditional Christian metaphysics and cosmology by way of a new interpretational concept of community; rather, he shows how the triadic structure of categorical semiotics is as valid for the spirit of research as it is for religious belief rightly understood. Peirce's specific defense of the Religion of Science (CP 6.433; cf. RS 211, 478f., n. 3) deduces neither science from religion nor religion from science. He makes the point that the religion of love is as firmly anchored in "direct perception" as are the con clusions of science (CP 6.437f.; CP 6.442f.; cf. RS 213,215). Seen from the standpoint of that unity of perception, the Christian practical formula for making decisions between "the Way of Life and the Way of Death" (cf. CP 6.440; cf. RS 214) is in no way offensive; it is, rather, a demythologized echo of Augustine's two civitates. The true community, which is more than a person's "narrow personality," is in no need of a supernatural, dualistic mar keted message of "fears of hell or hopes of paradise." However, as a guide to the conduct of life, there most certainly is a need for a binding behavioral orientation with monitoring through "public experience" (CP 6.451; cf. RS 248; see section 1[3]). (5) The transition from traditional cosmology, via an evolutionary thought process, to critical science provides the crucial criterion. If the critical proof of truth in the sense of both civitates is lost during the transfer, there is no longer any chance of justifying a metaphysics of community. This view, however, remains insufficiently answered in the direct transformation of a Christian community in Royce's Community of Interpretation as long as the special meaning of reality in the case of thirdness (i.e., interpretation in relation to perception and intellect) is not deemed independent of concrete social examples. Schleiermacher's concept of community, at this juncture, aims at a modern justification: decoding the ontological difference between reason and nature as a dynamic, tendentious component in the evolving pro cess of history with its forms of social realization. Without doubt, this model comes closest to American pragmatism; however, here, too, the findings are the same as with nineteenth- and early twentieth-century German philoso phy. Schleiermacher, as a philosopher and an ethicist, could not have ex erted any influence on the development of social philosophy.54 Yet through</page><page sequence="14">92 HERMANN DEUSER his ethics of community?namely, that community relationships, due to their organic wholeness, are to be understood as both organizing and symboliz ing?an epochal step toward the semiotic analysis of representation has been achieved. Community forms are symbols?just as person or personality is understood symbolically.55 This is, however, worthwhile only when the real ity of thirdness is adopted with Peirce's semiotics, when the triadic-struc tured semiosis?comprised of actual potentiality, empirical reality, and a symbolic adherence to regularity (or habit taking)?determines the analyti cal and constructive outcome of this model. For both the concept of commu nity and the concept of metaphysics are in such a way determinable and mutually correlatable, that, on the one hand, nothing from experience out side of explored realms of reality needs to be disclosed and, on the other hand, experience now can be understood in a way that neither creative po tentialities nor perspectives of the final truth need be curtailed. (6) Two examples at the close show how such a concept of community can be critically employed, and how its justification can once again be re inforced. If the concept of community loses out to the cosmological proof of truth and the metaphysical foundation bows to purely social descriptive models, there will be the danger of an uncritical self-affirmation of given forms of community. The many instances portraying typical social, national istic ideology in Germany during the first half of the twentieth century are the most frightening examples in the Continental philosophical sphere: the feasibility of critical metaphysics was nullified (see n. 44). On the American scene, civil religion (Pierhard and Linder 1988) would seem to be an exam ple of how an idea of community could loosen itself from its specific roots and foundations, becoming generalized, without being able to pay constant homage to the critical potentiality of certain theologies, cosmologies, or phi losophies. However such potential criticism is exactly the definition of sci ence, and, indeed, one that includes the (categorical and semiotical) concept of community: "Truth is the fruit of free inquiry and of such docility toward facts as shall make us always willing to acknowledge that we are wrong, and anxious to discover that we have been so" (CP 6.450; cf. RS 248). Justus-Liebig- Universitat Giessen NOTES 1. Religionsphilosophische Schriften will be designated as RS.

Kap.), Flasch (1980), and Kreuzer (1995). Augustine's text quotes Sancti Aurelii Augustini De Civitate Dei Libri I-X and Libri XI-XXII (1955), respectively according to the edition Corpus Augustinianum Gissense a Cornelio Mayer editum (1994), German transla tion: A. Augustinus (1991). 10. Exemplary for philosophical interpretation is Kreuzer (1995,42-54, 139). 11. Cf. Kreuzer (1995, 44): Augustine goes missing, "in the thirst for knowledge, the ancient ideal of the wise man who, in ascending towards the intelligible, becomes for himself a 'work of art' for unpretentious happiness, just like the Plotin's Trancendental Optimism." 12. Cf. Kreuzer (1995,133f.; 121): "DieAporie des Geschichdichen besteht in der Verwo benheit beider in dieser 'Weltzeit'(saeculum). Geschichte istder Text der Geschichten beiderT 13. Cf. XI, 33; XII, 7 (CCSL 48, 362, 1-4): "nemo igitur quaerat efficientem causam malae uoluntatis; non enim est efficiens sed deficiens, quia nec ilia effectio sed defectio. Deficere namque ab eo, quod summe est, ad id, quod minus est; hoc est incipere habere uoluntatem malam" 14. Cf. XII, 1; XII, 3; XII, 6 (361, 53-56): "Quo modo, inquam, bonum est causa mali? cum enim se uoluntas relicto superiore ad inferiora conuertit, efficitur mala, non quia malum est, quo se conuertit, sed quia persuersa est ipsa conuersio" 15. Cf. XIV, 6 (421, 5-15): "Nam quid est cupiditas et laetitia nisi uoluntas in eorum consensione quae uolumus? Et quid est metus atque tristitia nisi uoluntas in dissensione ab his quae nolumus? . . . Et omnino pro uarietate rerum, quae appeetuntur atque fugiuntur, sicut allicitur uel offenditur uoluntas hominis, ita in hos uel illos affectus mutatur et uertitur." 16. Cf. XII, 9 (364,58-60): "Hoc bonum quibus commune est, habent et cum illo cui adhaerent et iner se sanctam societatem et sunt una ciuitas dei-" 17. Cf. XIV, 1; XII, 22 (380, 20-27): "unum ac singulum creauit, non utique solum sine humana societate deserendum, sed ut eo modo uehementius ei commendaretur ipsius soci etatis unitas uinculumque concordiae, si non tantum inter se naturae similitudine, uerum etiam cognationis affectu homines necterentur; quando ne ipsam quidem feminam copulandam uiro sicut ipsum creare illiplacuit, sed ex ipso, ut omnino ex homine uno diffunderetur genus humanum." 18. Cf. XII, 23 (380,12-381,15): "cuipopulo [sc. civitate dei] essethuius rei consideratio profutura, quod ex uno homine deus ad commendandum hominibus, quam ei grata sit etiam in pluribus unitas, genus instituisset humanum." 19. Cf. XII, 28 (384, 6f.): "hoc genus tarn discordiosum uitio, tarn sociale natural 20. Cf. XIV, 1 (414, 16-20): "non tamen amplius quam duo quaedam genera humanae societatis existerent, quas ciuitates duas secundum scripturas nostras merito appellare possemus. una quippe est hominum secundum carnem, altera secundum spiritum uiuere_" 21. Cf. XIV, 4 (418, 29f.): "potest etiam is to modo dici quod alii secundum hominem, alii secundum deum uiuant." 22. Cf. XIV, 28 (451, 1-3): "Fecerunt itaque ciuitates duas amores duo, terrenam scilicet amor sui usque ad contemptum dei, caelestem uero amor dei usque ad contemptum sui." 23. The defectiveness of the natural is caused solely by the will (cf. XII, 1, and XII, 3); also the emotions are not per se to be condemned (cf. XIV, 9); and despite the repudiation of sexual desire, so clearly visible in his late writings, Augustine insists on the resurrection of the flesh?even for the women (cf. XXII, 17). For a critical reading of Augustine, see Kreuzer (1995, 134ff.) and Bloch (1967, 589): "Augustin degegen setzt wieder etwas wie neue Erde. Dadurch eben kann seine Transzendenz utopisch sein, denn sie verflicht sich mit der produk</page><page sequence="16">94 HERMANN DEUSER tiven Hoffnung menschlicher Geschichte, hatdarin Umgang, Gefahr und Triumph, nicht, wie die pure Transzendenz, bereits Entschiedenheit, also Fixum.

Cf. for "beatitudo finalis" XIX, 10; for "pax" and "aeterna vita" XIX, 11. 25. Cf. XIX, 13 (679,33-37): "Quapropter est natura, in qua nullum malum est uel etiam in qua nullum esse malum potest; esse autem natura, in qua nullum bonum sit, non potest. Proinde nec ipsius diaboli natura, in quantum natura est, malum est; sed peruersitas earn malamfacit." 26. Cf. the discussion of these forms in Duchrow (1983, 275ff.). 27. Cf. XIX, 17 (685,68-70): "cum ad Mam pacem adipiscendam refert quidquid bonarum actionum gerit erga deum et proximum, quoniam uita ciuitatis utique socialis est." 28. Cf. XII, 18 (374,26-33): "Porro si Mi circuitus admittantur, inquiunt, quibus uel manente mundo uel ipso quoque reuolubiles onus suos et occasus eisdem circuitibus inserente eadem temporalia repetuntur, nec ignauum otium, praesertim tarn longae sine initio diuturnitatis, deo tribuitur, nec inprouida temeritas operum suorum; quoniam si non eadem repetantur, no possum infinita diuersitate uariata ulla eius scientia uel praescientia conprehendi." Regard ing Augustine's critical theory of history, see Flasch (1980,395ff.) and Kreuzer (1995,120ff). 29. Cf. XII, 19 (375,28-30): "profecto et omnis infinitas quodam ineffabili modo deo fini ta est, quia scientiae ipsius inconprehensibilis non est." XII, 21 (378,88-379,91): "Si autem et haec nouitas ab ordinatione prouidentiae non excluditur. .. : possunt fieri noua, quae neque antea facta sint nec tamen a rerum ordine aliena sint." 30. Cf. XII, 37 (384, 28-33): "Et si deus, quod adsidue Plato commemorat, sicut mundi uniuersi, ita omnium animalium species aeterna intellegentia continebat: quo modo non ipse cuncta condebat? an aliquorum esse artifex no lie t, quorum efficiendorum artem ineffabilis eius et ineffabiliter laudabilis mens haberet?" 31. With regard to Augustine potentially separating (despite the biblical theology of cre ation!) God's eternity from the world's mere temporality, see Duchrow (1983, 304ff.) and Kreuzer (1995, 123, 127, 142ff.). 32. Cf. Augustine's references to the epistemological and agapistical concept of the Trin ity in XI, 26, and XI, 28. Cf. my Einleitung in RS (xl-xliii). 33. With regard to Schleiermacher's ethics, see Welker (1983) and Moxter (1992). 34. Cf. Ethics (1812/13,7f., nr. 20f. and nr. 24-30). Quotations will be marked according to this edition, with the page number and the corresponding number of section or paragraph. 35. Cf. Ethics 9f., nr. 39: "Die Vernunft wird in der Natur gefunden und die Ethik stellt kein Handeln dar, wodurch sie urspriinglich hineinkdme. Die Ethik stellt also nur dar ein potenzirtes Hineinbilden und ein extensives Verbreiten der Einigung der Vernunft mit der Natur, beginnenend von dem menschlichen Organismus als einem Theil der allgemeinen Natur, in welchem aber eine Einigung mit der Vernunft schon gegeben ist." Ethics 10, nr. 41: "Was sie darzustellen hat, ist also eine Reihe, davon jedes Glied besteht aus gewordener und nicht gewordener Einigung_" Cf. Moxter (1992, 198ff.). 36. Regarding the question of the difference between a (precritical) metaphysics and a transcendental theory of action-mode or thinking in Schleiermacher, see Moxter (1992, 79, 86ff., 196). 37. Cf. Moxter's comments on Schleiermacher's terminology, "Kraft und Erscheinung" according to Leibniz (1992, 80ff., 86). 38. This concept functions in opposition to all mechanical/external being (cf.

Cf. the concept in Peirce (EP 1, 362; German in NZ 249). 48. That is the medieval definition of metaphysics following the Scotistic tradition (cf. Kobusch 1980,1226). For the defense of this basic conception of metaphysics regarding the "Verfafitheit des Seienden blofi als solchen" especially in modernity and with respect to Royce, see Herms (1974, 422f., n. 60). 49.
