Johnson as the thirty-sixth President of the United States, and the death of Britain's elder statesman, Winston Leonard Spencer Churchill. The former event had a special import for all educators, for Mr. Johnson in his inaugural mes- sage to the nation emphasized the extension of educational opportunity at all levels of Ameri- can society as preeminent among the goals re- quiring the attention and support of the Federal Government. Mr. Churchill's death arrested the attention of the whole world, for it removed from the human scene a mighty voice which had fashioned for Britain, the British Common- wealth, and free men everywhere the unyield- ing determination to challenge attack and to reverse defeat at the hands of the authoritarian powers. What lends additional importance to Mr. Johnson's pronouncement is that it rises above political posturing assumed for the time and the place. What emerges from a review of Mr. Churchill's career is a striking example of the role of the human voice as an instrument of power. It is not a question of what our partisan opinion of Mr. Johnson may be as we weigh his plans to rest the "Great Society" squarely on educational foundations. What is noteworthy is that he is the first of our Presidents to put edu- cation ahead of all other measures for securing the welfare of our country. Similarly, we can give or withhold our approval of the bold tactics employed by Mr. Churchill during his long and stormy political life. What is essential to our final estimate of the man are not his successes and failures but rather his superlative command of the English language as the weapon with which he sought to decimate the opposition and to renew the loyalty of his supporters. This is the reason why, on the great stage of the world, the void occasioned by his death is acutely felt by all intelligent hearts and minds that recall with profound respect "the sound of a voice that is still." As long as records endure, Mr. Churchill's speeches and writings will remain as towering monuments of the masterful coordination of all the resources of the English language. In this respect, they already have a prominence com- parable to that achieved by the rare company of ancient Greek and Roman orators whose extant writings sparkle with diamond brilliance in the belles lettres of world literature. We recog- nize, of course, that the best oratorical literature is the final product of a process in which the orator first commits his speech to writing before delivering it, and then edits the speech after he has delivered it. It is, therefore, my immediate purpose to examine the foundations upon- which the classical genius, both Greek and Roman, for oratory was erected, a genius which was revived after the Dark Ages and which later was transmitted to Northern Europe by the forces of the Renais- sance. I shall, however, concentrate my review *Address at the Initiation Banquet of The Penn- sylvania State University Chapter (Lambda of Pennsylvania) of Phi Beta Kappa, June 11, 1965.

The parallels between the underlying cultural motivation of some one modern nation and that of some one ancient civilization are often strik- ing, although never quite identical. On this basis, not a few historians have noted a remarkable similarity between the standards which we Americans use for assessing "personal success" and "national progress" and those that were paramount in the esteem of the ancient Romans during their formative period. The Romans would have understood and approved our definition of the "useful" as that which is of immediate, practical value in the business of "getting ahead." And they would have subscribed also to our interpretation of the "practical" as that which contributes most directly to one's financial and social status within the community. Yet, the Romans in the course of their expansion learned by degrees the futility of success supported by no more than the high-speed treadmill of opera- tional efficiency and the strangling collar of bureaucratic supervision. To the superficial and hasty student of West- ern civilization, the very word Rome connotes political and economic domination won by deli- berate military conquest throughout the Med- iterranean World. The actual fact is that more than a thousand years passed between the time when the ancestors of the Romans settled in the Latin plain and the time when Rome, by origin a frontier fort town of the primitive Latins, emerged as the strongest city state in Central Italy, sent Pyrrhus packing home to Epirus, after he had won painful victories in Southern Italy, and girded herself and her half- hearted Italic allies for the inevitable showdown with Carthage, the thriving Semitic maritime power on the north coast of Africa. During these thousand years the Latins, the Umbrians, and the Samnites, though ethnologi- cally of the same Indo-European origin, were in conflict as they exploited on a widening scale the land resources of the peninsula. This con- flict was both confused and stimulated by the invasion of the Asiatic Etruscans who settled north of the Tiber River, and by the Greek colonists who settled the coasts of Southern Italy as relief from the severe economic restric- tions of the homeland that were imposed by the growth of the population beyond the capacity of the land to support it in reasonable, even though on the whole primitive, comfort. It was the Etruscans who first conquered North Central Italy by utilizing Umbrian man- power, who overran Latium and controlled it for more than a century, and who swept down the peninsula as far as the Bay of Naples where the resistance of the Greek colonists stemmed their further advance. It was they who introduc- ed a version of the Greek alphabet to the un- lettered Italic herdsmen and farmers, and who gave them their first lessons in political organi- zation. and military strategy, in commerce, in- dustry, and seafaring, in art and architecture, and in speciously elaborated religious rites and The Classical World, formerly The Classical Weekly, is published monthly from September to May.

Thus taught and stimulated, the Italic tribes were able to assimilate more readily the yet more advanced and refined instruction which they received from the Greek colonists to the south. The most notable impact of the Greek upon the Italic world was, however, in an area which the superstitious and ceremony-bound Etruscans had themselves not yet developed. On the one hand, this reflected the conscious attempt of the Greeks to arrive at a rational understanding of the natural forces that com- prise the universe; and, on the other hand, a conscious effort to determine how this knowledge could best be utilized for the benefit of the individual and of society. These interrelated in- quiries are, indeed, the most characteristic as- pects of the Greek mind, the two transparent faces of Greek thought, each merging into the other from whichever side they are viewed. Here is the matrix of the arts and the sciences. This is the cast of thought from which are born the humanities in the fullest sense of the term. The inventive Greeks, moreover, had already created literature as the technique for mirroring the elusive features of thought for the instruction of the less intuitive. This instruction became a lively educative process in every field of inquiry, whether in the form of poetical imagery or of prosaic definition. "The Glory that was Greece"' was nothing more or less than the glorious fruition of this process. It was thus that Greece became the schoolmaster to the world. It would, none the less, be wholly absurd to suppose that all the Greeks and all the peoples that were indebted to them for cultural inspira- tion were educated, man for man, to appreciate the monuments of the Greek mind and spirit. If this was not true of the Greek rustics who lived their whole lives far removed from the intellectual excitement of Athens and the other major Greek cities, certainly it also was not true that the spread of Greek culture to the city states of the Italic tribes affected to any appreci- able degree many individuals, except those living in or close to these cities. In fact, after the first impact of Greek culture in Central Italy, centuries passed before the Italic cities became notably Hellenic in the more refined aspects of their daily life and institutions. Yet more cen- turies passed before the fusion of Italic culture with the Hellenic resulted in the synthesis which we properly call Hellenistic, a synthesis which spread throughout the Roman Empire and en- dured, until it was overshadowed and finally absorbed in the Eastern Mediterranean by quasi- Asiatic Byzantism. The Italic pagani, the backwoodsmen of an- cient Italy, resisted with characteristic "pagan" determination the frills of Hellenism which af- fronted their ancestral respect for the plain, the simple, and the practical, as later their descendants were to hold out the longest against, in their estimation, the enthusiastic nonsense of the early Christians whose rantings against the old and tried gods and goddesses of the Italic pantheon were being accepted with shameful alacrity by the characterless and rootless urban mob of Rome. Throughout the course of Roman history, Latin authors continued to point with genuine pride to the Sabines, the "plain folk" who had resided from time immemorial in the Apennine foothills some few miles to the north- east of Rome, and who had, in spite of this proximity, maintained as their cardinal virtue pietas, the trinity of ethical conduct which their ancestors had made basic to their mores: rev- erence for the gods, respect for the State, and responsibility for the welfare of the family. An excellent, as well as amusing, example of the characteristic backwoods emphasis on the duality of the immediate and the practical is told about the ultra-sophisticated Latin elegiac In Forthcoming Issues December E.

Here we have a country boy, born into a prosperous family at Sulmo in the rugged mountain terrain some ninety miles east of Rome. His father, with an eye to improving the family fortune through professional channels, packed him and his elder brother off to the City to study for the bar. Ovid himself tells us that he soon abandoned this effort, for which he had no disposition, and resumed indulging his genius for writing poetry. How much his defec- tion must have incensed his father can be con- jectured from the story which relates how his pater attempted to dissuade him, when he was a mere stripling, from wasting his time by writ- ing poetry. When his father first discovered him dashing off line upon line of poetry with little effort, he probably was proud of the boy's pre- cocity, but he pointed out that poetry was not the road to economic affluence, as the life of even the incomparable poet of poets, Homer, forcefully attested. When later he again surprised the boy absorbed in the composition of poetry, he denounced the art as being utterly "inutili8," that is, "there's absolutely no money in it," and proceeded to give his son a sound thrashing. He should then have recognized that the punish- ment delivered on the seat of the boy did not touch the seat of the boy's inspiration, for in tearfully appealing to his father to let him off on the assurance that he would never again write another line of poetry, the boy (perhaps un- wittingly) actually couched his entreaty in a perfect dactylic pentameter verse composed on the spot: "Parce mihi, numquam versificabo, pater." Ovid could not have succeeded, even if he had sincerely tried to fulfill his father's wish that he should become a lawyer and thereby a professional credit to the family. Instead, he wisely listened to the murmurings of his genius which ultimately found its fullest and richest expression in the Metamorphoses, the grandest collection and the most dramatic expression in any language of the ageless Mediterranean myths by which primitive man tried to explain to him- self the origin of the world, the genesis of life, and his own emergence as a child of nature in an effortless age of golden ease, fanned by the zephyrs of eternal spring. Like Ovid, Vergil, too, was a farmer's son. He spent his youth in the rich plain country of northern Italy. After completing his education there, he, unlike Ovid, voluntarily migrated to Rome for the express purpose of preparing for the bar. Yet, he plead only one case during which he was so struck with embarrassment that he spoke with the hesitation of an uneducated man. This experience was enough to convince him that the Muse of poetry who had whispered in his ear, when he was yet a boy, would effectively direct him to the more productive use of his talent. His literary creativity ultimately gave birth to the Georgics, books of practical instruc- tion for the farmer-herdsman, yet expressed in poetical language unmatched in all classical di- dactic literature for descriptive power and love of field and fold. And in the Aeneid, the crown- ing achievement of his genius, he evolved in line and movement an emperor symphony in which he developed the theme of a world state, free of the madness of war, prospering under law, unmotivated by sectional avarice, and con- fidently striving to fulfill its destiny under the aegis of a divine, universal Intelligence. As the epic par excellence envisioning the integration of national interest with international purposive- ness, it is without a parallel in all world litera- ture. If the psychological disposition of Vergil and of Ovid had been such as to whet their Ego for the aggressive interplay of wits that char- acterizes forensic debate, they would, undoubt- edly, have been in the forefront of Roman barristers and would have been ranked with the Greek Demosthenes and the Latin Cicero as peer- less masters of the spoken word. Peerless masters of the music of words which is poetry they certainly were. It is more a twist of the mind that turns one word-inspired genius to oratory, and a twist of the heart that turns another to poetry. The rationale of thought attracts the one, the mystique of sensation distracts the other. The one assembles an argument designed to withstand contradiction; the other soothes, disquiets, and dazzles the imagination with visions of the world that lie beyond the gates of reason. With respect to this comparison, it is noteworthy that Quintilian, the author of the Institutio Oratoria, The Education of the Orator, was of the opinion that the orator stands to gain far more from a detailed study of the best poetry than the poet can acquire from a prolonged study of the most stirring oratory. Oratory and poetry, however, have this in common that their primary aim is to achieve persuasion: oratory by logical conviction, poetry by imaginative suggestion. Both also follow es- sentially the same pattern of composition which is simple in outline but difficult to execute. As it was conceived by the ancients, so it re-</page><page sequence="5">NOVEMBER 1966 THE CLASSICAL WORLD 91 mains, unaltered and unsurpassed, to this day, for it is the very essence of the technique of composition which involves the use of words for the topical presentation of thought. The first step of this technique is inventio: the search for and the selection of the materials best suited to the definition and treatment of the topic. This initial step is likely to confuse the novice, be- cause it requires a degree of judgment with regard to taste, utility, and suitability that ex- ceeds his as yet undisciplined conceit. But the next step, dispositio, is no less difficult for him to take, for it requires him to decide by what arrangement of the materials he can most ef- fectively develop the themes of the topic. The final step, elocutio, makes the greatest demand upon his talent, judgment, and patience, for it requires him to adduce, select, and properly combine the words and phrases that will the most exactly convey the intent of his sentiments. With diligent practice, supported by expert criticism, the novice may learn by degrees how to coordinate all three steps with more than passing skill. But, if it is his ambition to excel, that is, eventually to achieve a uniform excel- lence of performance below which his efforts will seldom fall, he may discover either that he lacks the talent for reaching such perfection, or that he lacks the driving power for disciplin- ing himself to cut his own steps to the lonely summit of such creative heights. For masterful artistic creativity that is expressed through the medium of words is, first and last, the human voice speaking directly to the human mind in tones that the spirit recognizes to be uniquely appropriate for sounding the depths of thought. The thesis, "What We Live By" is, therefore, central to the life of every educated man in every age, and it is fundamental to the motivation of the scholar in particular. For it is the scholar who perpetuates and adds to what we call know- ledge. The majority of mankind, educated as well as uneducated, perform functions that re- quire varying degrees of preparation and skill, either at the professional or vocational level. However useful, however convenient, however valuable their services may be, the majority remain "drawers of water" and "hewers of wood," to the extent to which they accept the limitations of the routine performance of their activities. This acceptance accounts, I dare say, for the ennui that creeps over many persons early in life and prompts them to seek release in the mere acquisition of material and social gains. The Age of Industrialism in which we as a country are the most advanced is the age of world-wide social discontent. By its very nature it demands access to almost unlimited raw ma- terials, and it engenders furious competition in the manufacture and distribution of finished pro- ducts. Willy-nilly, hundreds of millions of per- sons, skilled and unskilled, are caught up in this economic trap and are subjugated to a life on the treadmill of operational efficiency and are held in the strangling collar of bureaucratic supervision, local, state and national. Their dis- content with the "system" is a protest, as yet feeble, fumbling, and ill formulated, against the dehumanization of their lives, individually and collectively, and the loss of their personality in the machinery of IBM computers. What is most striking in countries that as yet are not undergoing the pains of industrialization is that the individual stands out as an individual in his own right, irrespective of his economic role in the community, and that he is evaluated for what he is as a person and not by what services he performs. The ills of economic expansion are, of course, not peculiar to the Age of Industrialism. Soc- rates, the gadfly of ancient Athens, was at- tempting to call men to their senses at the very time when Pericles was beautifying Athens with a profusion of public buildings with funds gain- ed mostly at the expense of allied city-states, and when he was laying plans for the subjuga- tion of the major rival of the Greek cities, Sparta. Similarly, Tacitus, the historian, and Juvenal, the satirist, writing in the first century A.D., when Rome was confidently accepting her self-appointed role of ruler of a Mediterranean empire, already deplored the urbanization of society with the concomitant submergence of the individual beneath the impersonal supervision of bureaucracy. Our situation today is further worsened by the heavy, short-sighted emphasis which is being given to applied science in school and college curricula. This is creating a serious im- balance in the student's preparation for a mean- ingful, as well as useful, life, because it is push- ing out the humanities on the grounds that, whereas they are interesting, they are not es- sential to the education of the masses. This same argument was advanced, until recently, against the inclusion of foreign language studies in the curriculum. The humanities are the written repository of the total experience of Western man as stated and interpreted by writers of superlative literary</page><page sequence="6">92 THE CLASSICAL WORLD NOVEMBER 1966 skill. They are uniquely what they are and, therefore, cannot be duplicated in any other area of study. To dismiss them as interesting but unessential in contemporary education is to turn one's back completely and indifferently on the explanation of who we are and what we are, as well as on the contemplation of who and what we might become. The multiplication of ingeni- ous machines and of mechanical techniques may improve man's physical condition and surround- ings, but the humanities are indispensable to the maintenance of active, moral motivation in all phases of civilized society. This conviction is what we live by. FRANKLIN B. KRAuss PENNSYLVANIA STATE UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
