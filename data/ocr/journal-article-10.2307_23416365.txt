<plain_text><page sequence="1">Julian Cha "There Is No Spoon": Transnationalism and the Coding of Race/Ethnic ity in the Science-Fiction/Fantasy Cinema of Keanu Reeves Keanu Reeves has secured a position as a hybrid and trans national entity in the cultural imaginary and has had the preternatural power to have mass appeal and to navigate along and across racial/ ethnic borders.' Because of his transnationality, it has been impossible to categorize him throughout his career: "For all the attempts to cat egorize Keanu, his identity remains difficult to pin down, evading at tempts at defining him" (Rutsky 191). The figure of Keanu Reeves as a hybridized and transnational identity has the unique capability of tran scending and negotiating various boundaries, as evidenced in several of his major works to date in the science-fiction/fantasy genre: Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992), The Matrix (1999), Constantine (2005), and The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008).2 In U.S. society today, where the cult of personality rules and tabloid news dominates the front page, it is often difficult, if not im possible, to differentiate between actor and character. The line that separates actor from character frequently becomes obscured and, in many cases, virtually erased, and the two become intertwined as ". . . stars signify in films by virtue of being an already-signifying image and by being given a character partly constructed by script" and the realization onscreen through performance interweaves the relation ship between image, character, and performance (Dyer and McDonald 88). With these complexities in mind, I am providing readings of texts based upon the perspective of a viewer whose knowledge of extra textual elements is being utilized to enrich the interpretation of these texts. In this article, I am purposefully focusing on the interplay be tween actor and character and blurring the boundaries between the performative aspects of Keanu Reeves as an actor/personality and the narrative aspects of the characters he plays in his films. Similar to Richard Dyer in his groundbreaking work Stars, 47</page><page sequence="2">Julian Cha I am basing this article on the assumption that we are dealing with Reeves in terms of signification, not with him as a "real" person. While he is a "real" individual, and this is an essential aspect of how he signi fies, we never truly know him directly as a "real" person (unless we know him on a personal level), but only as he is represented in vari ous media texts (Dyer and McDonald 2). Reeves' embodiment fore grounds the continuities of his media image, which can supersede the differences of character in his films, but they ultimately tend to echo one another. In relation to stars, Dyer discusses the "terms" through which the production/consumption dialectic is articulated: With stars, the "terms" involved are essentially images. By "im age" here I do not understand an exclusively visual sign, but rather a complex configuration of visual, verbal and aural signs. This con figuration may constitute the general image of stardom or of a par ticular star. It is manifest not only in films but in all kinds of media text. (Dyer and McDonald 34) The methods through which he performs in his films represent and embody not only a viewer's knowledge of his identity/image but also the ways in which a viewer will conceptualize how his identity/image influences his performances and characters in his work. Reeves embodies a multiplicity of meanings, and any attempt to structure these meanings automatically foregrounds certain mean ings and displaces others, but the crux of this paper is the exploration of just precisely what it is that the image of Keanu Reeves signifies. At the point of convergence are the threads of character similarity that ap pear in many of the roles Reeves has chosen and how his appearance affects his impact and effectiveness in said roles. For Dyer: As has already been mentioned, a star will have a particular perfor mance style that through its familiarity will inform the performance s/he gives in any particular film. The specific repertoire of gestures, intonations, etc. that a star establishes over a number of films carries the meaning of her/his image just as much as the "inert" element of appearance, the particular sound of her/his voice or dress style. (Dyer and McDonald 142) The primary focus of this paper is to delve into the similarities in per formance style and traits as seen in the characters Reeves portrays that are comparable from film to film and the ways his appearance and variable ethnicity allow him, as an actor, more fully to inhabit and inflect these roles. Reeves exists as a transnational in the cultural imaginary be cause he has created interconnections across nations, races, ethnici ties, and cultures both within himself as a "real" person and in his 48 Studies in Popular Culture 35.1 Fall 2012</page><page sequence="3">Transnationalism, Ethnicity, and Keanu Reeves choices of roles. In general, "transnationalism" may be defined as the "process by which immigrants forge and sustain multi-stranded social relations that link together their societies of origin and settlement. . . [and] whose social fields . . . cross geographic, cultural, and political borders" (Hu-DeHart 9). In his place as a cultural icon on a global scale, Reeves crosses and transcends boundaries of race and culture, ties together multiple societies, and, to use Aihwa Ong's term, carries "flexible citizenship." Born in Beirut, Lebanon, Reeves has lived in Australia, New York, and Toronto before deciding to move to Hol lywood to pursue an acting career. His father is of Chinese and Ha waiian descent, and his mother is Caucasian; he carries citizenship in the U.S., Canada, and England. In any role he plays, he embodies this history that is mapped across his body. According to R.L. Rutsky, Reeves's films of the 1990s exhibit an elasticity of identity and a lack of rigidity of boundaries of "self': If Keanu is emblematic of anything about 1990's cinema and cul ture, and I believe that he is, it has much less to do with vague no tions of stupidity or banality than with important cultural changes in how identity is portrayed and perceived. Indeed, over the course of the last decade, Keanu's films—from the Bill &amp; Ted movies (1989, 1991 ) to Point Break ( 1991 ) to Speed ( 1994) to The Matrix ( 1999) -have exhibited a consistent concern with issues of identity and its instability, with a lack of fixity that is often figured in these films' emphasis on movement. (185) Throughout his career, Reeves has been able to "pass" as white, in spite of his ethnic heritage. It is a topic he has largely avoid ed and failed to acknowledge on any significant level: "He never de nies his ethnicity yet it is continually forgotten and ignored except by the audience that goes looking for race" (Nishime 283). While many Asian-Americans "claim" him as one of their own, he has never recip rocated by discussing his Asian background. But his hybrid identity endows him with the ability to transcend lines of demarcation that separate race/ethnicity. He has circumvented and deflected the impe rialist gaze and uncannily been able to dodge having his body marked by "otherness" and its subsequent stereotypes: "As the son of a Ha waiian-Chinese father, however, Keanu could easily be described as a person of color—although he rarely is. One might view this perception of Keanu's identity as yet another example in Hollywood's long his tory of effacing the ethnicity of its stars while retaining some measure of their 'exoticism'" (Rutsky 191-92). For myself, a young Asian-American youth growing up during the late 1980s and 1990s, Reeves provided a sense of visibility as he 49</page><page sequence="4">Julian Cha embodied a vague "Asianness" and a definite "Otherness" onscreen. During this period, he was the only Asian-American leading man in Hollywood who defied a politics of invisibility, a defiance which was essential, as invisibility inevitably leads to a sense of insignificance within society. In this early period of my life, I never had factual in formation or concrete evidence of his heritage; instead, I assumed his inexplicit Asianness but certain Otherness. While I presently read him as "Asian-American," what I find fascinating is his unique ability to pass as white with his heritage underlying his performances. The title of this article is a reference to a famous line from the film The Matrix at a point when Neo is waiting in a roomful of other "potentials" before his life-altering meeting with The Oracle. Neo no tices a young potential bending spoons with nothing but his mind and is intrigued by this ability. After the boy offers the spoon to Neo, Neo inquisitively befriends him and the boy offers this advice: Young Potential: Do not try and bend the spoon. That's impossible. Instead, only try to realize the truth. Neo: What truth? Young Potential: There is no spoon. In the film, "truth" or "reality" is that the spoon, along with every thing else that exists within the Matrix, is an illusion. Similarly, for the purposes of this article, the "truth" is that the lines that separate race/ethnicity and nationality are imaginary and socially, culturally, politically constructed to have importance/meaning but are ultimately illusory and have false, empty meaning as markers. Don John in Much Ado About Nothing While it is decidedly not ensconced within the science-fiction or fantasy genre, the film version of Shakespeare's Much Ado About Nothing (1993), directed by Kenneth Branagh, provides an instance which set the standard for Reeves's career as an entity who has the predilection and ability to negotiate boundaries of race/ethnicity and who is racially and ethnically ambiguous. In the film, Reeves portrays Don John, who serves as the primary antagonist and is the illegitimate brother to Don Pedro, Prince of Aragon, played by prominent African American actor Denzel Washington. If almost any other Caucasian or Asian actor were cast in the role of Don John, it might have had a nearly comical effect, and the entire relationship could be deemed unbelievable and utterly implausible. However, Reeves's capacity to transcend borders of race/ethnicity allows him to portray the character with fewer eyebrows being raised and less incredulity, and he is per 50 Studies in Popular Culture 35.1 Fall 2012</page><page sequence="5">Transnationalism, Ethnicity, and Keanu Reeves haps the only "A-list" actor who indeed possesses this inherent knack for crossing these lines of race and ethnicity. His performance in this early film of his oeuvre (within a year of Bram Stoker s Dracula) helped lay the groundwork and established his penchant and ability to perform as a racially and ethnically ambiguous subject. With scant screen time as the "plain-dealing villain" Don John, Reeves appears to be the only character who is capable of cross ing over between spaces in Messina: the viewer sees him plotting in shadowy, dark cellars and rooms with Borachio (Gerard Horan) and Conrade (Richard Clifford) where none of the other characters are seen, but he is also able to inhabit the sun-drenched fields of Le onato's (Richard Briers) villa. Don John also interacts almost entirely homosocially with his companions Borachio and Conrade and has no love interest in the film. Alienated by the nucleus of the men and by all of the women of the estate, Don John/Reeves is the outsider and the ethnic Other who is excluded from the group of close-knit brothers-in arms, Benedick (Branagh), Claudio (Robert Sean Leonard), and Don Pedro. As a result, for those aware of his Asian heritage, the stereotype of the asexual, sexless Asian-American male may also be invoked through his estrangement from the women and his lack of a love inter est. Oft-criticized for his wooden or stilted acting, Reeves's in expressive delivery in the film is actually effective and highly appro priate as it separates and demarcates him from the other actors and their characters within the narrative. As the sullen, dour Don John, his presence contradicts the light-hearted tone of the piece, and he appears incongruous in the sunny courtyards of Leonato's villa when juxta posed with the other merry and upbeat characters who engage in witty repartee—which serves only to further distance Reeves within the filmic narrative. As the central evil-doer in the film, he is the source of all the ill-intentioned deception and creates the major conflict as he brings Hero's (Kate Beckinsale) chastity and fidelity into question for Claudio, thereby altering the mood and tone of the piece. His stiff and affected acting abilities as the sulking presence known as Don John work in the film simultaneously to distance him from the others and to highlight the general joviality of the other characters, of their relation ships with one another, and of the piece itself. Jonathan Harker in Bram Stoker's Dracula Released one year prior to Much Ado About Nothing, Fran cis Ford Coppola's film Bram Stoker's Dracula (1992) is one of the 51</page><page sequence="6">Julian Cha early pieces in Reeves's body of fantasy/science fiction work that ef fectively exhibits his transnationalism. Reeves's passing in the film can be attributed to two different readings of the character of Jonathan Harker. First, his ability to move without any deterrent across borders is precisely because of his white privilege inherent in the nature of the character. The narrative itself has the same structure during this section as traditional colonial adventure narratives (e.g., She [1887], L'Atlantide [1919], Heart of Darkness [1899], etc.) in which the white male protagonist moves from the metropolis/core into the wilderness/ periphery or semi-periphery (Stoker's 1897 novel Dracula also fol lows this path). In this instance, the film presents an Orientalized East ern Europe on the frontier with the Ottoman Empire, which has a long history of dangerous racial encounters. The frontier-crossing is typi cally also cast as moving from civilization to barbarism and moving from a future-facing present into a primitive, bestial past, only to have to resist (or embrace) seduction by the Other. Second, speaking meta-theatrically, the slipperiness and elu siveness of a fluidity of identity that enables Reeves to move across these spaces points to the contradictory position of him as Harker, which turns his performance into passing. There is much work on vampires themselves as emblematic of transnational fluidity, normally in relation to epidemics and global capitalism (see Mutch), and Reeves only further complicates and deepens the discussion through his por trayal of Harker. It is also worth noting here that for an English viewer, his transnational identity is already indicated by his notoriously poor efforts at an English accent. Near the beginning of the film, a deranged R.M. Renfield (Tom Waits) is in his cell in a London insane asylum during 1897. As Renfield is no longer able to perform his duties as a result of his men tal instability, Jonathan Harker (Reeves) must take over for a foreign client, Count Dracula, who is buying property around London. Harker is immediately dispatched to Transylvania, and his journal entry in the film begins in Budapest on the 25th of May in 1897. While leaving the West for the East, Harker is in a district entering the extreme east of the country on the border of three states: Transylvania, Moldavia, and Bukovina in the middle of the Carpathian Mountains. In his journal, Harker describes the place as "one of the wildest, least known parts of Europe." Harker exhibits an Orientalist view of the East as a dark, dangerous, and exotic locale and imposes his Eurocentric perspec tive upon the "others" of the East. During this scene, Harker's face is in silhouette and half of his face is covered in shadow as he enters 52 Studies in Popular Culture 35.1 Fall 2012</page><page sequence="7">Transnationalism, Ethnicity, and Keanu Reeves the "East," a shadow which is symbolic of a sense of the impending doom on his travels. On his journey, Harker takes various modes of transportation and travels by train and later transfers horse-drawn car riages while crossing these borders of nations. In the novel, Jonathan Harker is presumably a white male from England; however, as played by Keanu Reeves, the character is given the ability to cross these bor ders with relative ease and without question or suspicion of nefarious or imperialist intentions. Upon entering the castle of Count Dracula, Harker becomes separated from the rest of society, both human and non-human alike. Due to Reeves's Asian heritage, with the character being isolated and cordoned off from both the natural and supernatural worlds, the his tory of Japanese internment during World War II might be brought to mind for some viewers, along with the concept of Asian-Americans being perpetual foreigners in the U.S. The notion of Reeves as a loner who is alienated and cut off from the rest of society is a common theme in his work and will be highlighted further in this article.3 In one scene, Dracula walks in on Harker as he shaves by candlelight. Here, the viewer sees half of Harker's face in shadow, similar to the image when he was on the train traveling to Count Drac ula's castle in Transylvania, as he becomes further ensconced in the castle and under the spell of Dracula. The lighting is indicative of his liminal status between light and dark, and the viewer sees the struggle between good and evil play out upon his face. This dynamic is also seen toward the end of the film when Harker returns to London after escaping from the castle and sees Dracula as a young man from his (Harker's) carriage, where his face is again cast in shadows. Bram Stoker s Dracula also deals with issues regarding tech nological advancement, which ties the Asian body through Reeves to technology and will be examined further in the discussion of The Day the Earth Stood Still. For instance, there is a scene shot in the style of the cinematograph and involving Dracula's visit to England and first meeting with Mina (Winona Ryder) in human form and their expe rience with the new invention of the cinematograph. Also, advance ments in medical technology are an aspect in the film, such as blood transfusions, which Van Heising (Anthony Hopkins) demonstrates for a crowd of physicians. At one point in the film, Harker is drained of his blood by three female vampires in order to keep him in a weakened state so he is unable to leave Dracula's castle. However, he later escapes by climb ing out on a ledge and falling into the river below, and he engages in 53</page><page sequence="8">Julian Cha further border crossing by ending up in a convent in Romania. Mina and Jonathan subsequently marry in Romania as they test the boundar ies of marital laws. After returning to London on September 17,1897, Jonathan is still ill and does not quite fit right back into society, which mirrors the Asian-American and hapa experience of never quite fitting into or feeling a sense of belonging in U.S. society.4 At dinner with Van Heising, Jonathan tells Van Heising that he never tasted the blood of the demonic women that seduced him and kept him drained of his blood. Van Heising then reveals that since Harker did not drink of their blood, he is not infected by them. Within the filmic narrative, Jonathan is unmarked by "otherness," but this status carries over with Reeves, who is also unmarked by race/ethnicity or the status of the "other" in society. The conclusion of the film features a frenetic chase sequence as Harker, Van Heising, et al., hunt Dracula on the 28th of October. As Harker writes in his journal about their pursuit of Dracula, a map de picting their travels is shown, which literalizes Harker's transnation ality. Harker crosses borders at a rapid pace via various methods of transport as he and the others leave London by train, cross the English channel, go through Paris to the Alps in Budapest, then go to a Roma nian port in Varna in order to burn the Count's ship. The film ends with a chase on horseback as the Count hurries to his castle to avoid the men hunting him. Reeves's inherent transnationality and capability of crossing boundaries is demonstrated during this sequence that features rapid movement across borders of nation. Neo in The Matrix Reeves's increasingly distinctive position in the industry as a hybrid identity who can "pass" as white is put on particularly effective display in the groundbreaking, seminal film The Matrix (1999), which is a visionary tale in the science-fiction genre that stands as an ideal model for the concept of hybridity. In the film, "the Matrix" is repre sentative of hegemony and oppressive ideology that keeps the masses at bay. Its mechanisms are invisible to the populace who unwittingly obey and adhere to the stipulations laid out by the dominant modes of thinking and belief systems in the form of the Matrix. Part of the brilliance of the film comes in the casting of the main characters: Mor pheus is played by an African American (Laurence Fishburne) and is the leader of the resistance against the Matrix (read: oppression). Agent Smith (Hugo Weaving), who is the leader of the state apparatus of the Matrix, is played by a white male in the film, along with all of 54 Studies in Popular Culture 35.1 Fall 2012</page><page sequence="9">Transnationalism, Ethnicity, and Keanu Reeves the other agents of the Matrix. Neo, who is "The One" and the savior of the oppressed, is played by Reeves, who is the embodiment of hy bridity and transnationalism. As such an extensive amount of literature exists on The Ma trix, there is little hope of writing anything very innovative on the film. Writings on the film extend to various fields, from philosophy to religion to science, but Hernân Vera and Andrew M. Gordon provide an analysis from a postcolonial perspective in Screen Saviors: Hol lywood Fictions of Whiteness. However, I would like to offer a few insights, including one intriguing mode in which to view the film as a colonial adventure narrative in the same vein as Bram Stoker s Drac ula. Neo, the "white" male protagonist, travels from the Matrix/core into "reality'Vperiphery, seduced by the Other from the false reality of the Matrix to the "truth" of the present. Neo leads a solitary life as a computer hacker who lives alone in a run-down apartment, and, again, we see the recurrent theme of Reeves as a loner who lives apart from society. He is asleep at his computer when Trinity speaks to him through his computer, before a group of street toughs arrive at his door. As Neo retrieves a rogue program hidden in a book, the viewer discovers that the program is concealed, cleverly in tune with the themes of the film, in Simulacra and Simulation by Baudrillard. A pivotal scene as Neo is later undergoing Morpheus' training process opens with a crosswalk signal blinking a red figure, indicating that pedestrians should not cross the intersection, which is symbolic of the Matrix controlling the movements and actions of the populace. As the light turns green, Morpheus leads Neo down the street past a mass of pedestrians while explaining what the Matrix is. While Morpheus effortlessly glides past the other pedestrians, Neo has trouble maneu vering by them and bumps into several of them. This sequence is rep resentative of Neo's not yet comprehending what the Matrix is and how it operates, and of Morpheus' being fully cognizant and aware of its machinations. As Morpheus walks down the street, the viewer sees Mor pheus in silhouette with the right side of his face in darkness. Accord ing to Richard Dyer, lighting in film is discriminatory on the basis of race and privileges individuality, so movie lighting "discriminates against non-white people because it is used in a cinema and a culture that finds it hard to recognize them as appropriate subjects for such lighting, that is, as individuals" (Dyer 102). We see Dyer's notion of the discriminatory nature of film lighting in this scene in The Matrix. 55</page><page sequence="10">Julian Cha Toward the end of the scene, with the dialogue that begins with Mor pheus stating, "We have survived by hiding from them, by running from them. But they are the gatekeepers, they are guarding all the doors, they are holding all the keys, which means that sooner or later someone is going to have to fight them," Morpheus is framed from the neck up with Neo's reflection in his sunglasses, and Morpheus appears as a shadowy bust, which stands in stark contrast to the bright "white" images of Neo in his lenses. Even though Morpheus is arguably more important in this scene in terms of narrative as he is the guide and mentor with all the information, he is nonetheless shrouded in dark ness. During this scene in the film, the Woman in Red (Fiona John son) makes her appearance as she walks by Neo and catches his eye. She represents a standard of beauty and the "norm" that non-whites should strive toward. In effect, she glows, and for Richard Dyer, "Ide alised white women are bathed in and permeated by light. It streams through them and falls on to them from above. In short, they glow" (102). With her white skin, blonde hair, light eyes, and bright red dress, she contrasts with everyone else in the scene, including the dark-skinned African American, Morpheus, and the mixed-race hero, Neo. Shown in this scene glowing and confidently striding down the street past Neo and Morpheus, she is the epitome of purity, virgin ity, and chastity and framed as being morally superior. Although a woman in red traditionally represents sexual allure, in the film she rep resents sexual allure without the promise of fulfillment or consumma tion, since Neo is learning about the nature of reality during the scene and contemplating exactly who and what is "real" and/or "unreal." Since she is "unreal," she is somehow off-limits and untouchable as she is part of the false reality of the Matrix, which makes her chaste and virginal in the sense that she is unattainable as a mere image with in the Matrix. An angelic, glowing white woman is a rather excessive representation, since it is an idealization, but the white woman as an gel was "both the symbol of white virtuousness and the last word in the claim that what made whites special as a race was their non-phys ical, spiritual, indeed ethereal qualities" (Dyer 127). In this scene, the Woman in Red reinforces this idyllic view of the white woman who has historically been privileged over minority figures. In a scene near the conclusion of the film, after a frantic chase sequence that ends up in an apartment building, Agent Smith catches up with Neo just before he can make his escape from the Matrix and 56 Studies in Popular Culture 35.1 Fall 2012</page><page sequence="11">Transnationalism, Ethnicity, and Keanu Reeves Smith seemingly kills Neo. However, Neo is soon resurrected from the dead through the love of Trinity, and it becomes evident that he, in fact, is "The One." After Neo realizes this and believes in himself, the next scene shifts to his point of view, where he now sees the "world" in streaming code because he now possesses the ability to "see" the Matrix. As the Matrix becomes visible to him, Neo is able to see how it operates and how it controls the multitudes. At this moment in the film, Neo becomes an "intellectual" in Edward Said's sense of the word, since he has the ability to exist outside the system and view it from an alternate perspective. By disas sociating and distancing himself from the Matrix, Neo is no longer a prisoner or slave to it. For Said in Representations of the Intellectual, an "intellectual" exists as an exile in a metaphorical sense as he or she must remain in a liminal state marked by an abject status: The pattern that sets the course for the intellectual as outsider is best exemplified by the condition of exile, the state of never being fully adjusted, always feeling outside the chatty, familiar world inhabited by natives, so to speak, tending to avoid and even dislike the trap pings of accommodation and national well-being. (53) Exile status for the intellectual "in this metaphysical sense is restless ness, movement, constantly being unsettled, and unsettling others" (Said 53). Now that Neo has reached this status and can see the code of the Matrix, he has the ability to control and direct the code and disrupt the system. For Said, an intellectual has the privilege of not following a predetermined course in life, and Neo exemplifies this tenet as he es capes the mundane life laid out for him by the Matrix. A significant advantage for the exile viewpoint for an intellectual is that one tends "to see things not simply as they are, but as they have come to be that way" (Said 60) and, at this juncture in the film, Neo no longer sees only what the Matrix allows him to see, but is now able to see what is underlying that illusion and can view the Matrix itself. Neo becomes representative of progress and a disturbance of the status quo; the "ex ilic intellectual does not respond to the logic of the conventional but to the audacity of daring, and to representing change, to moving on, not standing still" (Said 64). He then faces off against Agent Smith and two other agents for one final battle in the hallway of the building. No longer needing to dodge bullets, Neo simply slows them down to a halt before they harmlessly drop to the floor after Smith and two other agents unload their guns at him. Soon after, Smith rushes at Neo and attacks him, but Neo effortlessly parries Smith's punches before 57</page><page sequence="12">Julian Cha landing a single kick that sends Smith flying down the hallway. After Smith gathers himself up off the ground, Neo charges at him and flies directly into Smith. Neo engages in a form of ethnic trafficking as he literally in corporates himself into Smith and embodies him. While embodying Smith, he begins to fracture and then explodes apart into fragments—a literal form of one of the effects of trafficking in ethnicity, fracturing the Eurocentric view of ethnic groups as one monolithic entity. As the face of "whiteness" fragments and ruptures into numerous pieces, the face that remains is the face of hybridity and the melding of races and ethnicities in the form of Reeves. Later, a lone cursor blinks onscreen as a phone rings and is answered by the Matrix, connecting Neo to it. The screen then reads, "carrier anomaly," since Neo is now an anomaly within the system as he now has the ability to "see" the Matrix. During the following monologue, the streaming code of the Matrix abruptly stops and the screen reads "system failure" as Neo's existence as an entity that can see through and beyond the Matrix causes the system to crash: I know you're out there. I can feel you now. I know that you're afraid. You're afraid of us. You're afraid of change. I don't know the future. I didn't come here to tell you how this is going to end. I came here to tell you how it's going to begin. I'm going to hang up this phone and then I'm going to show these people what you don't want them to see. I'm going to show them a world without you. A world without rules and controls, without borders or boundaries. A world where anything is possible. Where we go from there is a choice I leave to you. Neo is speaking to racial/ethnic/cultural hegemony, the status quo, "whiteness," the ruling class, etc., and is informing "the Matrix" that he now understands it and can "see" it. He knows that the Matrix is afraid of a multicultural, polycultural, interethnic society of hybrid identities and minorities. He is going to show oppressed peoples a world without the "Matrix" and the rules and regulations of oppres sive regimes, without "borders or boundaries" of race/ethnicity, a world of new "cross-ethnic" possibilities where the coalescence of races/ethnicities is the ideal by-product and ultimate goal. After he emerges from the telephone booth, Neo ushers in a new era of "post ethnicity" where ethnicities are hybridized and interrelated. With his ability to visualize the code of the Matrix, he then has the capacity to manipulate it, a capacity which becomes evident with his newfound capability to fly at the end of the film. 58 Studies in Popular Culture 35.1 Fall 2012</page><page sequence="13">Transnationalism, Ethnicity, and Keanu Reeves John Constantine in Constantine Returning to cross spatial and temporal borders in the film Constantine (2005), Reeves plays John Constantine, who has the abil ity to see beyond the "real" world into the realm of angels, demons, and evil spirits. He has the capability of traveling back and forth be tween hell and earth and can perceive the dead and undead. As a child, he had the aptitude to see demons and committed suicide as a result, which has relegated him to eternal damnation. Due to his sentence of an eternity in hell, Constantine performs exorcisms in an attempt to earn his way into heaven/salvation, but his deeds are futile as they are not entirely altruistic and are performed out of selfish motivations. This aspect of the character and Reeves's portrayal reflects the Asian American desire to reach racial, social, and political equality in soci ety. When the viewer is first introduced to Constantine, he arrives at an apartment building where he has been called to the scene to per form an exorcism on a teenage girl who has been possessed by a de mon. The building is of a largely Filipino populace, implied by the Filipino flag seen in the kitchen as the mother of the possessed girl is making tea and also during the exorcism when the possessed girl whispers, "We will kill them all" in Tagalog to Constantine. The girl is further abjected in this scene by not only being a minority, but also being possessed and viewed as infected and impure. In this scenario, the stereotype of Asian-Americans living in their own ethnic cliques and remaining in isolation away from the rest of mainstream soci ety in their private ethnic enclaves is put on display and reinforced. Reeves has the ability successfully to enter this restricted and closed off "world" due to his heritage and masked "Asianness." Father Hen nessy (Pruitt Taylor Vince), who called Constantine, is a white male and seems out-of-place and had been unable to exorcise the demon, while Constantine's apprentice, Chas (Shia Labeouf), is also a white male who must wait in the car and cannot enter this exclusive space of Filipinoness. Early in the film, Constantine is shown alone and isolated in his apartment and the theme of Reeves as pariah in his films develops further. He is unable to relate to society at large because of his ability to see evil spirits inhabiting the earth, and this inability to fit in can be seen as reflecting Asian-Americans' historically being excluded from society and perpetually abjected from the mainstream. Having the su pernatural ability to traverse boundaries that separate the otherworldly regions of hell, earth, and eventually heaven, Constantine crosses over 59</page><page sequence="14">Julian Cha into the realm inhabited by Lucifer and his minions in the film. He is not bound by natural laws that relegate him to worldly dealings of the living; he operates on a supernatural level while negotiating paranor mal states of being. During the course of the narrative, Constantine travels to hell in order to find Angela Dodson's sister, Isabel, who seemingly committed suicide, and he later returns from hell with the aid of holy water. Reeves's portrayal of Constantine lives up to the stereotype of the asexual Asian-American male, as he depicts him as sexually timid and apprehensive. Historically, representations of Asian men have ranged from the "egghead/wimp" to the "kung fu master/ninja/ samurai," and, regardless of the category to which they are assigned, Asian men are "sometimes dangerous, sometimes friendly, but al most always characterized by a desexualized Zen asceticism" (Fung 148). Essentially, they are viewed in the collective dominant cultural imaginary as asexual beings who lack any kind of masculinity and do not pose any sexual threat to society. On three different occasions throughout the film, Constantine fails to kiss Angela despite her obvi ous willingness and attraction to him. The first time occurs in the car when he gives her a necklace with a charm that wards off evil, then towards the end of the film after he saves her from the archangel Ga briel (Tilda Swinton), and finally at the conclusion after he gives her the spear of destiny in order for her to hide it someplace safe where no one will ever find it. When the spear of destiny first appears at the beginning of the film, it is discovered wrapped in a Nazi flag complete with its promi nent swastika, which has become the symbol of white supremacy and evil. Symbolically, through the character of Constantine, Reeves usurps the power wielded by the Nazi regime by reclaiming the spear in an Asian-American body: he achieves a transference of power and undergoes a process of empowerment. In the end, he understands that this power is too great for any one person to control, which is the reasoning behind giving it to Angela to hide. Constantine achieves salvation at the end of the film when he sacrifices his soul and trades for (Angela's sister) Isabel's with the Devil so she may leave hell and enter heaven. Constantine is then able to cross the border into heaven and step into the final frontier, thereby completing the heaven/earth/ hell triad, which he can now negotiate and traverse. Klaatu in The Day the Earth Stood Still In the sci-fi remake The Day the Earth Stood Still (2008), 60 Studies in Popular Culture 35.1 Fall 2012</page><page sequence="15">Transnationalism, Ethnicity, and Keanu Reeves Reeves plays Klaatu, an interplanetary traveler from the borderless regions of outer space; he is an alien life-form that is a representative of a phalanx of civilizations, which is a seemingly integrated and har monious collective, sent to Earth to judge the human race as worthy of salvation or extinction. This version of the film has been interpreted as a film about conservation and the preservation of the environment, whereas the original version has been commonly viewed as dealing with Cold War issues and the threat of nuclear war. While the original film is often seen as an antinuclear piece, Mark Jancovich's reading of it in Rational Fears positions it instead in relation to an imperial assertion of the right to police the natives. In a post-9/11 context of hyper-vigilance, increased fear of the other, wariness of those who do not belong, and the threat of violence against those who wrong us, Reeves's embodiment of Klaatu is self-contra dictory, as he is an exotic other who represents a totalizing order to which others must submit. For Jancovich, the original film "calls for the repression of individual feelings, interests and desires, all of which are simply defined as both irrational and destructive"; violence, or the threat of it, is necessary for the operation of the rational state and "vio lence may be denied to individuals or nations, but only because it is given over to the rule of technology and science embodied in the robot police force of which Gort is a member" (41). Gort represents this hyper-vigilant police state with his panoptic gaze and seeming inde structibility and omnipotence, while Klaatu is symbolic of the powers that-be that control and wield the police force. Klaatu advocates conformity to authoritarian regimes and universalism; however, Reeves's casting in the role seems to defy this conceptualization as he embodies transnationalism and otherness. Ac cording to Jancovich, the 1951 film neither respects nor celebrates diversity: "Instead of respecting difference, the film demands rigid conformity to the universal order, an order from which there can be no valid dissent" (46). Due to his exotic nature, Reeves does not appear to adhere to any universal order and his hybridity inherently stands in opposition to uniformity. His casting as Klaatu complicates Jan covich's reading of the original film, since Reeves the actor is on the outside/periphery, while Klaatu the character promulgates adherence to the inside/core. From a different perspective, Reeves's presence in the film might also imply that such entities have become part of the inside/core of society. The remake begins in 1926 in the Karakoram Mountains in India with Reeves as a mountain climber who comes across a translu 61</page><page sequence="16">Julian Cha cent orb. After chipping away at it, he sees a blinding light emitted that renders him unconscious. When he awakens, he notices a mysterious mark on his hand, which the viewer eventually learns had been left after the extraction of DNA from the climber. Reeves plays a dual role and crosses borders of time and character as a climber in India in 1926 and as an alien in human form in New York in 2008. As the film progresses, an object is discovered to be heading directly toward earth and has an impact location at Central Park in Manhattan. This object turns out to be a giant luminescent globe from which a faceless alien emerges. Shot by authorities almost upon the moment of first contact, the alien is taken to a government facility established at the Fort Linwood Military Academy in New Jersey and operated on for the gunshot wound. Reeves's "exotic" look and hybridity is put on effective dis play in the film as the visitor's flesh is pale and akin to whale blub ber and he is surrounded by an outer layer described as "exotic" and 'strange," which is gray flesh that falls away to reveal a life form ges tating underneath in a nascent state. The being is made up of different life forms including human body tissue and the gray flesh appears to be a bio-engineered space suit with placental tissue. The alien life form is growing exponentially, using the human DNA sample it had obtained from the 1926 visit to earth. He has been encoded with human DNA because his true man ifestation would "frighten" humans. As he morphs into human form, he begins to take on a racially ambiguous shape in the form of Reeves. In the body of Reeves, he becomes an empty vessel and a blank canvas for viewers to project themselves onto him regardless of race/ethnicity. In comparison, the original version of the film featured a white male, Michael Rennie, as Klaatu, who also appears as an exotic yet white figure, due to his studiedly precise, English-accented voice; Reeves's stiff, alien performance provides a parallel distancing. As a Christ fig ure, he is also passing as white since Europeans and Americans tend to envision Christ as white, despite his being born in Palestine. After Klaatu takes on human form, he informs the govern ment officials that he wishes to speak to members of the United Na tions. However, the Secretary of Defense (Kathy Bates) fears an alien invasion and wishes to administer a truth serum so they can question Klaatu. Instead, Dr. Helen Benson (Jennifer Connelly) gives him an innocuous injection of water before he is taken away to be interro gated. During this scene, Klaatu is hooked up to a lie detector, and he is able to manipulate and control the machine, and reverses roles with 62 Studies in Popular Culture 35.1 Fall 2012</page><page sequence="17">Transnationalism, Ethnicity, and Keanu Reeves the interrogator. Klaatu becomes connected to the wiring in the facil ity through the lie detector. In this scene, technology becomes closely aligned with Asianness through the figure of Keanu Reeves and ex hibits what Jane Chi Hyun Park refers to as oriental style: "Imprinted in the national consciousness and exported to the rest of the world through media, this fantasy is based on and sustained through imag ery, iconography, and modes of performance that conflate East Asia with technology in a global, multicultural context, constituting what I call oriental style" (Park viii; emphasis in original). This is another re current theme in Reeves's body of work from Bram Stoker s Dracula to Johnny Mnemonic (1995) to The Matrix, where technology is in tertwined with the (Asian-American) body creating anthropomorphic consciousnesses/entities. Veteran actor James Hong appears in the film as an alien who has been living amongst humans on Earth for over seventy years and meets with Klaatu at a McDonald's, home of the golden arches that serve as a recognizable symbol of corporate America. He serves as Klaatu's contact on the planet who has been observing and analyz ing the human race during his stay. He calls humans "destructive" and deems them suitable for eradication. Adding a complex layer of depth to this role of an alien outsider living in the U.S. is the fact that James Hong is an Asian-American who embodies an entire history of exclusion and carries the status of being a perpetual foreigner in the U.S. His screen presence relays a history of Asian-American perfor mance, as he has been an actor since 1957 and a performer in over one hundred films, appearing in such classics as Chinatown (1974), Blade Runner (1982), and Big Trouble in Little China (1986). Meta-theatri cally, he is speaking for Asian-Americans against a society that has subjugated and attempted to bar them from the body politic through immigration laws. As a visitor in the most extreme sense, Klaatu attempts to un derstand society and see if the human race is worth saving. After his treatment by the U.S. government, he tries to comprehend their fear of the Other and the unknown. Due to Reeves's presence in the film, this fear transforms into a fear of a racial/ethnic Other. Klaatu is kept iso lated and quarantined by the government, and with Reeves playing the part, this quarantine can be seen as reminiscent of Japanese internment during World War II along with the exclusion of Asian-Americans in society in general, similar to other films already discussed. Klaatu is unable to be a part of society even though he fits in physically in hu man form; he is inherently incapable of becoming enmeshed in soci 63</page><page sequence="18">Julian Cha ety, which acts as a metaphor for the Asian-American experience and its feelings of being perpetual foreigners and outsiders. He also serves as a representative of Asian-America because he is excluded from the dominant society due to his extreme "foreignness." As he is here to judge society objectively and to decide on the survival or eradication of humanity, Klaatu is similar to Neo in The Matrix since he is an "in tellectual" in Edward Said's sense of the word: an outsider who carries the ability to see the inner workings of a society. Embodying ethnic and cultural difference, Reeves introduces new spaces of resistance and offers new possibilities in cultural and postcolonial studies. He is constituted by otherness and projects an abject, othered position while reconfiguring Orientalist thought that subjugates the minority figure: The aim of cultural difference is to rearticulate the sum of knowl edge from the perspective of the signifying position of the minor ity that resists totalization - the repetition that will not return as the same, the minus-in-origin that results in political and discursive strategies where adding to does not add up but serves to disturb the calculation of power and knowledge, producing other spaces of sub altem signification. (Bhabha 232-233) His presence onscreen and off provides new modes of thought con cerning the category of "Asian-American" and how transnationalism has altered this categorization, and his hybridity restructures outmod ed ways of thinking and conceiving of race/ethnicity/culture and blurs the boundaries which separate these classifications. Hybridity exposes the porous borders which separate nations/ races/ethnicities and erodes seemingly impenetrable boundaries of separation and categorization. Hybrid figures maneuver along and ne gotiate these lines of demarcation and break down barriers between us/them and center/periphery. When dealing with hybrid entities, it becomes even more challenging to read a performance, since "cul ture" becomes multiplied and complex: "Much more significantly, we are faced with the challenge of reading, into the present of a specific cultural performance, the traces of all those diverse disciplinary dis courses and institutions of knowledge that constitute the condition and contexts of culture" (Bhabha 233). The notion of "traces" becomes magnified and more complicated by hybridity. In particular, with Reeves it is difficult to distinguish his ethnic and cultural origins and the "traces" of the discourses that underlie culture due to his racial ambiguity. For Haiping Yan, "human mobility" has the power to produce 64 Studies in Popular Culture 35.1 Fall 2012</page><page sequence="19">Transnationalism, Ethnicity, and Keanu Reeves and incite change on a global scale, and the movement across bound aries is perhaps the true impetus behind globalization: . . one may be tempted to say, and indeed may well argue, that the human vitality and energy engendered by boundary-crossing mobility are perhaps the real engines or fuels of global change and productivity, rather than capital and the supremacy of capital that seem to monopolize the pro cesses and definitions of globalization" (233). Embodying mobility across borders, Reeves represents this maneuverability: he is emblem atic of progress and this notion of diasporic bodies engendering social change. Symbolic of what drives globalization, Reeves personifies a melding and coalescence of races, ethnicities, and cultures. Written on his transnational body is a striving for resettlement, not only physical but also conceptual: a resettling of ideas and atti tudes toward race/ethnicity and the survival of a progressive attitude concerning inter-ethnic coalitions and relations. The diasporic body signifies both resettlement and the impulse for survival: "Lest such acumen about 'impossibility' divest the diasporic body of her living strength, however, one may see in the bodily rhythms of the diasporic not only signs of strivings for resettlement but also desires for survival in transit that are potentially or effectively transformative" (Yan 237). Inherent within the diasporic figure is the aptitude to transform human experience. In terms of hybridity and transnationalism, Walter Benjamin is perhaps one of the first theorists to write in the field, albeit in an indirect way. In his seminal and well-known essay, "Theses on the Philosophy of History" in Illuminations, Walter Benjamin uses Klee's painting Angelus Novus as a template to envision his "angel of his tory": His face is turned toward the past. Where we perceive a chain of events, he sees one single catastrophe which keeps piling wreckage upon wreckage and hurls it in front of his feet. The angel would like to stay, awaken the dead, and make whole what has been smashed. But a storm is blowing from Paradise; it has got caught in his wings with such violence that the angel can no longer close them. This storm irresistibly propels him into the future to which his back is turned, while the pile of debris before him grows skyward. This storm is what we call progress. (257-258) Benjamin's angel of history is a witness to the unfolding of events in history, but is powerless due to the interminable "piling wreckage" of the past and the inevitable, relentless future. History is seen as non linear and simultaneous where events coincide, run into, and influence each other. The angel of history longs to intervene, but is unable due 65</page><page sequence="20">Julian Cha to the march of time called "progress." In this oft-quoted passage from Benjamin, many scholars em phasize the view of history and the past as a single, concurrent unit. However, for the purposes of this article, I choose to focus on what is behind the angel of history: the wide expanse of space to which he is blind. Lurking behind the angel is an unknown future of possibilities where an infinite number of outcomes and options exist. It is a future of "post-ethnicity," beyond racial and ethnic stereotypes and precon ceived notions: "A world where anything is possible." In all of the roles Reeves undertakes, he has this hybridity mapped across his body and he carries this ability to "pass" along racial/ethnic lines as either white or Asian. In all of his past and future films he embodies racial/ethnic ambiguity and this notion of "post ethnicity." It is this ambiguity that allows him to appeal to different demographics and act as a blank canvas where the viewer can project her or his own identifications onto him. To note one clear instance, Reeves is scheduled to star in the upcoming live-action film version of the Japanese anime series Cowboy Bebop. It is a unique blend of science fiction, westerns, and anime, which follows the adventure of Spike Spiegel, who is a former member of the Red Dragon Crime Syn dicate, and a group of bounty hunters (cowboys) aboard their space ship (Bebop) in the year 2071. The series was directed by Shinichirö Watanabe and written by Keiko Nobumoto and first aired in Japan in 1998 and later in the U.S. in 2001. Reeves's ability to "pass" finds him passing in anime linked to Japan, where his transnational body is transplanted into the anime series. In essence, he is passing as Japanese as fans of the series are cognizant of it as being a Japanese product. Those with stereotypical perceptions of Asians all being the same and as a monolithic cat egory will fail to see the complexity of a hybrid, transnational figure who passes as both white and Asian embodying a Japanese anime character. It will potentially be a multilayered performance because Reeves brings life to a "Japaneseness" or a Japanese national iden tity in a hybrid/transnational body in the borderless reaches of outer space. Hybridity signifies various notions surrounding identity poli tics and has certain significant implications. Standard and convention al racial categories, such as African American and Asian-American, become de-essentialized and their definitions become more complex. While perceiving the crossing of racial boundaries through embodi ment, viewers can feel a sense of solidarity with the implied equality 66 Studies in Popular Culture 35.1 Fall 2012</page><page sequence="21">Transnationalism, Ethnicity, and Keanu Reeves and understanding among the different races. This performance style questions racial difference and situates difference between races and ethnicities as largely superficial and as a stumbling block which must be negotiated in order to reach solidarity and political and social al liance. Reeves embodies hybridity and is split within himself, a split which articulates his heterogeneity. He serves as a locus of cultural/ racial/ethnic difference and exists in liminal spaces that are sites of resistance, and he will continue to display his abilities as an Asian American hybrid martial artist, protagonist, and hero in a future "with out borders or boundaries."
