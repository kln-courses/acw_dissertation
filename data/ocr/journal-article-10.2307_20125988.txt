<plain_text><page sequence="1">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS * AMERICAN PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. VIII, No. 3: July, 1971 Varieties of Privileged Access, WILLIAM ALSTON This paper is an attempt to explicitly distinguish and interrelate a number of respects in which persons have been thought to be in a specially favored epistemic position vis-?-vis their own mental states (though one or more of these positions might conceivably be enjoyed with respect to other subject matters). The most important distinction is a six-fold one between what I call Infallibility, Omniscience, Indubitability, Incorrigibility, Truth Sufficiency, and Self-warrant. These are different respects in which a person may be in a specially favorable position to get knowledge in some domain. Each of these varieties can then be sub-divided as to the kind of modality, if any, involved. In addition to setting out and interrelating the varieties, it is argued that the discussion of the subject has been hampered in various ways by a lack of cognizance of these distinctions. Theories, Analogies, and Criteria, WILLIAM HASKER The thesis that an inner process stands in need of outward criteria is explicated and defended. It is shown that the connection between psycho logical predicates and behavior predicates is in a precisely definable sense both logical and necessary, even though the occurrence of the behavior is logically neither a necessary nor a sufficient condition for the occurrence of the mental process. Objections against this view (by Putnam, Plantinga, and Ayer) are answered. It has been suggested (by Chinara and Fodor) as an alternative that psychological predicates are governed by implicit, com mon-sense level psychological theories. It is shown that this view, while possibly correct, supplements rather than replaces the doctrine of criteria. For such theories, like the explicit theories of psychology, must satisfy the twin logical requirements that theoretical predicates must be tied logically to observation predicates, and psychological predicates must be tied to behavioral criteria. * Abstracts of articles from leading philosophical journals are published as a regular feature of The Review.

WEISS and HOWARD KAINZ Part I, "A Critical Survey of Hegel Scholarship in English, 1962-1969," by Frederick G. Weiss. This paper notes the positive impetus given to Hegel studies in the English-speaking world by the manifold efforts of Profes sor Findlay, and briefly assesses the variety of approaches to and inter pretations of Hegel in the years roughly between the appearance of Findlay's Hegel: A Re-examination and Hegel's 200th birthday. Special attention is given to the work of Kaufmann, Mure, Loewenberg, Fackenheim and Muel ler, while that of Kaminsky, Paolucci, Pelczynski/Knox, Wiedmann, Soil, Walsh and Weiss is also noted. Part II, "The Future of Hegel Scholarship," by Howard P. Kainz. Although the usual function of a bibliographical survey is to attend to what work has already been done, it would not seem inappropriate now and then for such a survey to call attention to work which still needs to be done in a certain area, i.e., to point out the existence of "gaps." The author, in attending to this admittedly subjective task, notes that in the area of Hegel research a) the translation of some selected works by and about Hegel will contribute especially important instruments for the understanding of Hegel, and should have some priority; b) efforts at the formalization of Hegel's dialectical logic should be furthered; c) further inquisition into the Hegel ian roots of Marxian and Kierkegaardian positions is warranted; and d) the presentation of paradoxical Hegelian content in the explicit form of paradox would be a useful complement to other prevalent modes of exposition. Act-Utilitarianism: Account of Right-Making Characteristics or Decision-Making Procedure?, EUGENE BALES Causes, Reasons, and Aesthetic Objectivity, DONALD W. CRAWFORD Aesthetic Subjectivism is characterized, and three well-known argu ments against it (the Argument from the Fallacy of Definition, the Argument from Critical Development, and the Argument from the Admission of Irre levancies) are examined, criticized and found to contain a common assump tion: that aesthetic subjectivism cannot distinguish between causes and reasons, or between explanatory and justificatory reasons. A fourth argu ment (the Argument from the Distinction between Causes and Reasons), which argues against aesthetic subjectivism directly on the basis of this assumption, is criticized and rejected. Finally, some suggestions are made as to how the issue between subjectivism and objectivism in aesthetics can be resolved. Probability, Credibility, and Acceptability, RICHARD SWINBURNE The paper begins by examining what is meant by "evidence" when it is said that a theory is probable on certain evidence. It then considers what is the relation between a theory being probable on certain evidence, and a theory being believed, and a theory being credible. It then distinguishes</page><page sequence="3">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 151 various senses of "accept" in which scientists are said to accept theories, one and only one of which is the sense of "accept" in which it is equated with "believe." It then analyses the logical relations between a theory being probable on the evidence, and a theory being accepted, and a theory being acceptable, on the different senses of "accept." Has It Been Proved that All Real Existence is Contingent?, ROBERT M. ADAMS It is widely believed (1) that the real existence of anything cannot be logically necessary, and (2) that this has been established so conclusively that arguments for the logically necessary existence of any real thing can be rejected out of hand, without further consideration. This essay is an attack on the second of these beliefs. Three leading arguments against logically necessary real existence which are analyzed and criticized in the article are: (1) that whatever we can conceive, we can conceive its nonexistence; (2) that affirmative existential propositions cannot be logically necessary because they do not just tell us what the requirements are for satisfying a certain concept, but tell us that a certain concept is satisfied by something; and (3) that acceptance of logically necessary real existence would com promise the conviction that what reality is, is independent of human thought, choice, and activity. Is Ultimate Epistemic Authority a Distinguishing Characteristic of the Psychological?, HAROLD MORICK Plato on the Correctness of Names, NORMAN KRETZMANN * In Plato's view there are two questions of correctness for names: (1) Should a name having the force this name has be in use at all? (2) Is this an appropriate name for the things to which it is applied? (1) is raised without regard to differences among languages, but (2) yields different results when applied to different languages. Plato's general theory of the correctness of names provides a basis for answering (1); his special theory bears the same relation to (2). The general theory is presented as a definite achievement; the special theory is shown to be devoid of philosophical value except perhaps as a design for an ideal language. Convention is the only operative and in certain respects the only possible criterion of correct ness, but there is a translinguistic correctness of names, the linguistic mani festation of a correct conceptual schema, which serves as a criterion for the acceptability of any language. * This article appeared in Vol. VIII, No. 2: April, 1971.</page><page sequence="4">152 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Proper Names, Truth-Value Gaps, and Paraphrastic Programs, JOSEPH MARGOLIS * The argument offered demonstrates that Quine's program for reparsing proper names as general terms fails, on formal grounds, for it is impossible to provide a common formal principle for replacing proper names in singular statements that are true and in statements that are false because the proper names employed fail to refer. Hence, too, presuppositions regarding the truth and falsity of singular statements cannot be eliminated in pursuing such paraphrastic programs. AUSTRALASIAN JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. IL, No. 1: May, 1971 Conclusive Reasons, F. DRETSKE Knowing that P on the basis (simply) of R requires that R be a con clusive reason for believing P. R is a conclusive reason for P if and only if R would not be the case unless P were the case. When a subject has conclusive reasons for believing something, it is false to say that he might be wrong (about that which he believes), and it is false whether or not one knows that it is false. Hence, conclusive reasons eliminate the possibility (in one relevant sense) of mistake. It is also argued that having conclusive reasons is sufficient for knowledge. Such an analysis avoids the Gettier-like counter examples to justified true belief accounts of knowledge since, unlike being fully justified in believing P, one cannot have conclusive reasons for believing P when it is false (a feature of justification which the Gettier examples exploit). Quine on the Logic and Ontology of Time, HUGH M. LACEY Some logical problems posed by tense are examined and it is shown how Quine's paraphrases resolve them. At the same time Quine's solution is contrasted with that of Prior. The ontology implicit in Quine's para phrases is made explicit, systematized, and defended from criticisms regard ing its coherence and adequacy. In particular, his four dimensional ontol ogy is defended against criticisms regarding its capacity to account for change. The Inexplicability of Identity, STEWART CANDLISH The author gives formal expression to the principles of Indiscernibility of Identicals and Identity of Indiscernibles and considers four accounts of * This article appeared in Vol. VIII, No. 2: April, 1971.</page><page sequence="5">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 153 these formulae. Two of the three significant accounts essentially regard the principles as schemes for analysis of identity statements while the third regards them as statements of necessary and sufficient conditions for their truth. The author argues that numerical identity claims can never be ana lyzed away; that no non-circular sufficient condition can be formulated; and that the attempt to frame a necessary condition results either in inco herence or in the imposing of impossibly strong demands. The conclusion is that we do not fully understand these intuitively convincing accounts of identity. Some Problems Concerning Projection, JOHN MORRIS The concepts of projection and entrenchment, as they appear in Nel son Goodman's Fact, Fiction and Forecast, raise serious questions concern ing the nominalist and empiricist views there developed. The term "project ible" is itself ambiguous, since it is used in both a normative and a descriptive sense, and the term "entrenchment" is defined in such a way as to exclude predicates which are essential to the scientist. Finally, the descrip tion of a predicate as "well-entrenched" is subject to the same difficulties that Goodman raises concerning such predicates as "grue." INTERNATIONAL PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. XI, No. 2: June, 1971 Gestures as Self-Expression and Communication, HAIG KHATCHADOURIAN Two main types of gesture, "meaningful/' (possessing signification) and "non-meaningful/', may be distinguished. Both may (1) dramatize or reinforce, or (2) serve as a substitute for verbal communication. Drama and film illustrate these clearly. Some meaningful gestures have (3) symbolic uses, as in religious rituals. Likewise certain bodily postures. Some meaningful gestures function as (a) signs or (b) signals: some conventionally in some sense. (4) Some gestures have a "performative" function, form part, or part of the "context" of, a speech act." Gestures, whether meaningful or no, may have a second sort of meaning: significance (meaningo). This may be of different sorts?aesthetic, "existential," reli gious, etc.?and is relative to time and place. Gestures may also have a "good" or "bad" meaning (meaning3), hence emotive uses and coloring, and dynamic (persuasive) force. This relates to their possible evaluative func tion. In this and in their precision or vagueness, but not in their "non translatability," they resemble words.</page><page sequence="6">154 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS A Pluralistic Account of Space, PETER MILLER Space, I propose, following Whitehead and Weiss, is best understood as one aspect of the way in which a plurality of individual actual beings impinge upon one another. Rather than take extension as a primitive characteristic of individuals and their relations, I interpret it in terms of the intrusions and resistances of individuals. Space, I argue, is a con tinuum of the mutual resistance between individuals, a domain of their external relations. This general conception of space proves fruitful in ad judicating the classical dispute over whether space is a plenum or a void and in resolving Eddington's two-tables paradox. It also yields an interpreta tion of such diverse phenomena as absolute and relative locations, indeterm inate positions, origins, limits, geodesies, a variety of types of boundaries, mapping, perception, and idealization yielding mathematical concepts. Mysticism and the Paradox of Survival, J. J. CLARKE Aspects of Classical Chinese Logic, CHUNG-YING CHENG In this article I have discussed, first, the relation of the Chinese gram matical structure to logic and thought in Chinese philosophy, second, the logical modes of reasoning as contained in classical Chinese philosophical writings, and finally, the explicit Chinese logical consciousness and inquiries into forms reasoning and problems of language in relation to reality and truth. I have shown many aspects of the relationship of Chinese language to Chinese logic and Chinese thought. A most important aspect among these is that both Chinese logic and Chinese thought have their universal characteristics which are not contingent on Chinese language, whereas Chinese language, in so far as its grammar is concerned, seems to exhibit the basic points of Chinese philosophy, and indeed can be taken as a con crete illustration of important Chinese philosophical principles such as that the whole is relevant for, and contributes to, the determination of the part in the whole. My discussion also suffices to indicate the scope, sources, and significant potential values of the study of logic and language in Chinese thought and their interdependent relationships. It is hoped that this study will not only shed light on the philosophical nature of Chinese thought, the Chinese language, and Chinese logic, but will also conduce to a better understanding of the fundamental and universal problems of logical structure of language and human thought at large. Reflections on Methodology in Chinese Philosophy, ANTHONY S. CUA This essay argues for the importance of philosophical reconstruction of concepts in Chinese thought. Attention is drawn to the normative com mitments that underlie the doctrine of "rectification of names." An illustra tive case is Hsun-tzu's discussion of the criteria for sage-kings or paradigmatic individuals. Methodological observations on conceptual</page><page sequence="7">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 155 analysis are also discussed in relation to the Analects of Confucius. The essay ends with contrasting the use of Western philosophy for elucidation of Chinese thought and the explication of concepts that raise philosophically interesting problems. From Hermeneutics to Metaphysics, EMERICH CORETH JOURNAL OF THE HISTORY OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. IX, No. 2 The Just and Happy Man of the Republic: Fact or Fallacy?, ROBERT W. HALL Descartes' Notion of the Union of Mind and Body, DAISIE RADNER Descartes introduces the notion of the union of mind and body in order to explain the possibility of causal interaction between two substances which are totally different in nature. He claims that we clearly sense that the mind and the body are united. He also claims that their union is a substantial union. He attempts to clarify the notion of the substantial union of mind and body, by saying that the mind may be considered as the substantial form of the body, and that the mind and the body, though complete in themselves, are incomplete in relation to the unity they form. It is argued that Descartes is unsuccessful in reconciling the substantial union of mind and body with the radical dualism which is fundamental to his philosophy. Recent claims that the union of mind and body poses no problem for Descartes are shown to be based upon a misconception. How to Understand De Intellects Emendatione, PAUL D. FISENBERG This paper (which should be regarded as a prolegomenon to the study of Spinoza's Tractatus de Intellectus Emendatione) argues, first, that the dif ficulty of making intelligible Spinoza's talk about an intellectus emendatic or "improvement of the understanding" is not primarily due to the fact that Spinoza's phrase has a technical meaning, but rather to the fact that Spi noza's doctrine is philosophically confused: only by forgetting (temporarily) his own distinction between the understanding, as one "part" of the mind, and the mind (anima or mens) itself, can Spinoza speak of an improvement of the understanding, a "part" of the mind which, he frequently claims, is incapable of improvement. The paper attempts, secondly, to explain exactly how the various sorts of things which, according to Spinoza, can be under stood differ from one another, and in accordance with what principle (s) Spinoza ranks them as more or less understandable.</page><page sequence="8">156 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS Eschatology, Sacred and Profane, PHILIP MERLAN A Hegelian Key to Hegel's Method, ABIGAIL L. ROSENTHAL Hegel is miconstrued as a dogmatist when his method is separated from the total system of its applications, reified as an unjustified "content" and treated as if its author had presented it as a revelation. Hegel not only does not proceed this way himself, but his procedure is such as to render untenable any philosophy which detaches content or doctrine from method. Hegel teaches no given doctrine but a method, understandable only in the context of the whole Hegelian corpus which is supposed systematically to demonstrate the method's usefulness. The article goes on to state, in a general way, the nature of this Hegelian method, the matters it is applicable to, the restric tions on its application, why Hegel's method is neither to be understood from the "right" nor from the "left" and, generally speaking, what future philosophic work is suggested by further applications of Hegel's method. James and Moore: Two Perspectives on Truth, RICHARD HERTZ G. E. Moore's criticisms of William James' theory of truth are asses sed. It is argued that Moore overlooked fundamental qualifications that James made to his theory of truth, in particular his qualifications concerning merely possibe verification and usefulness. More fundamentally, each viewed truth from a completely different perspective, that of a God and that of man, and this difference of perspective prevented them from agreeing on the specific details. It is suggested that this difference of perspective can be seen partly to be the result of a different interest in the problem of truth. Late Scholastic Logics: Another Look, LARRY HICKMAN Logic flourished as a creative science among the scholastics of the Neuzeit (1450-1750). Even so, the period, its personalities and its issues were almost totally ignored by historians of logic until the mid nineteen sixties. A survey of contributions since that time includes the work of I. Angelelli. V. Mu?oz Delgado, and a monumental bibliography of some eight thousand entries by W. Risse (Bibliographia L?gica. Hildesheim: Georg Olms, 1965). As a contribution to the textual "recontruction" of the period, eighty-three additions to Risse 's work are offered, all the result of prospect ing the largely uncatalogued riches of four Mexican libraries during the summer of 1969.</page><page sequence="9">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 157 Vol. IX, No. 3: July, 1971 Imagery and Philosophy in Plato's Phaedrus, KENNETH DORTER An exploration of the relationship between the "poetic" and "philo sophical" elements of the Platonic dialogue, with a view toward determining whether the poetic element is an essential component of, or merely a pleasant adjunct to the serious philosophy. To this end, the imagery of the first third of the Phaedrus (preceding the palinode) is analyzed, and is seen to be com posed with a care and design that suggests a central function, and to reveal significant philosophical content that would otherwise be inconspicuous. In particular, this first section of the dialogue, understood in this way, seems indispensible for a full understanding of the central palinode. In the light of this discussion, some reasons are suggested for Plato's choice of this poetic form of exposition. Ramus and Bacon on Method, CRAIG WALTON Although he scorned Ramus' logic in 1602, Bacon seems to praise it by 1623. Though Farrington and Anderson dismissed this apparent change of mind, the present study argues that Bacon adopted two of Ramus' chief views: the new characterization of "invention" and "judgment," and the shift of emphasis from form as apodictic definition to operative principle as interdependent variable. After offering evidence for comparison, the study concludes that clarification of their common ground in some aspects of the new logic sets into sharper focus their differences as to "levelling men's wits" and the applicability of humanist dialectic to polity and theology. In epitome this study of Ramus and Bacon opens the larger questions of the time as to whether theory of judgment and the search for wisdom could be replaceable by the new science. The Philosophy of Bishop Stilling fleet, RICHARD H. POPKIN Edward Stillingfleet, 1635-1699 is only known as Locke's opponent. This paper attempts to present Stillingfleet's general philosophical view that he had developed throughout his writings in his struggles against Bible criticism, Catholicism, Deism, Skepticism and reasonableness of Christianity in the new scientific age, and presented a common sense theory, based on Stoic and Aristotelian elements. Just before his controversy with Locke, Stil lingfleet was analyzing the dangers of the views of Descartes, Hobbes and Spinoza and was also showing the compatibility of the views of Newton and Boyle with religion. Then, when Stillingfleet saw how Locke's empiricism could be used as a weapon against Christianity, he turned his energies against Locke's views. In so doing he diagnosed what the course of British empiricism was going to be, and presented an alternative, much like that which was later set forth by Thomas Reid.</page><page sequence="10">158 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Berkeley on Abstract General Ideas, ROBERT A. IMLAY The main purpose of this paper is to show that Berkeley's solution to a problem for which other philosophers had introduced abstract general ideas leaves his ontology open to serious attack. A subsidiary purpose is to show how he might have accepted abstract general ideas as a solution to the problem. His own solution commits him to the possibility of the perceiver's being mistaken about his own ideas. This in turn engenders a skepticism about spirits that Berkeley sought to avoid. It also re-introduces the pos sibility of representationalism which Berkeley tried to exclude. As a result, he would have been better advised to accept abstract general ideas and trust in the eventual solution of the problems to which they give rise. Religious Concepts and Moral Theory: Luther and Kant, BERNARD WAND An attempt to show that in his explanations of moral beliefs and actions Kant uses concepts in ways which are more appropriate to a religious context, primarily as expressed by Luther, than to a moral one and that consequently his moral theory fails to understand properly the moral life. It is maintained that Kant's use of these concepts leads him to confuse the source of our duties with the test of the morality of our acts, to charac terize our moral struggles in such a way as to preclude responsibility, to undercut the intelligibility of moral effort, to identify freedom with con straint, to deny the relevance of certain desires and of character formation to the performance of morally good actions and, finally, to express an attitude to the moral law which might well induce idolatry towards specific moral rules. The Development of Royce s Later Philosophy, BRUCE KUKLICK The study of the evolution of Royce's thought from The World and the Individual to The Problem of Christianity has proceeded independently from an analysis of his work in the foundations of mathematics. This is unfortunate since Royce repeatedly stated his belief that the ground of his practical philosophy was his technical philosophy, and after 1900 his "technical" concerns were those of symbolic logic. In this essay I interpret Royce's doctrines in light of the changes evidenced in his work in mathemat ical logic. In so doing I hope to detail, for this period, the relationship among pragmatism, idealism, and logic which has been important in American philosophy from Peirce to Goodman and Quine. Different Kinds of Equivocation in Aristotle, JAAKKO HINTIKKA Against G. E. L. Owen, it is argued that there is a definite distinction in Aristotle between pollakhos legetai (difference in use) and homonymy (ambiguity). A comparison between Aristotle's remarks on amphiboly</page><page sequence="11">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 159 (equivocation of a phrase rather than of a single word) in Topics II, 3 and what he says of focal meaning (pros hen equivocation) in Metaphysics IV, 1 suggests that a preoccupation with one easily leads Aristotle into con sidering the other, and into de-emphasizing the very contrast between pol lakhos legetai and amphiboly. In general, the consideration of longer explanatory phrases on a par with single words seems to go hand in hand in Aristotle with the distinction between pollakhos legetai and homonymy and with the later eclipse of the notion of paronymy. JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Vol. LXVII, No. 7: April 8, 1971 Essential Attribution, RUTH BARCAN MARCUS A minimal characterization of an essential property is given. Necessary properties are a broader classification under which essential properties fall. Further conditions lead to different modes of essentialism. Some of these are considered; in particular those conditions which might characterize individuating essences are distinguished from those which might charac terize Aristotelian essences. For such modes, especially the latter, the modalities are taken on a physical or causal interpretation. That yields a definition of a causal conditional and illuminates the role of essential attribu tion in reasoning about causes. Natural kinds are seen as Aristotelian essences which play a special role in causal reasoning, a role which can be made quite explicit with the framework of a modal structure. Within that structure, there do not emerge those paradoxes about causal reasoning which emerge in the standard logical framework. Counterparts of Persons and their Bodies, DAVID LEWIS It can be argued that persons and their bodies are not identical because something is true of a person that is not true of his body: namely, that he could have been (or occupied, as the case may be) some other body. On the treatment of quantified modal logic proposed in my "Counterpart Theory and Quantified Modal Logic" (Journal of Philosophy, 1968) this argument is valid. But if the method of counterparts is modified to allow for a multi plicity of counterpart relations between things in different possible worlds, the argument fails. Vol. LXVIII, No. 8: April 22, 197? The Iterative Conception of Set, GEORGE BOOLOS</page><page sequence="12">160 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS A Plea for Substitutional Quantification, CHARLES PARSONS I argue that, contrary to statements by Quine, substitutional quantifica tion expresses in some cases a genuine concept of existence that is appropriate to certain conceptions about abstract entities. I raise an objection to the suggestion that, short of set theory, all quantification over abstract entities is substitutional. Vol. LXVIII, No. 9: May 6, 1971 The Whole Sense of the Tractatus, W. D. HART On page 3 of the Author's Preface to the Tractatus Logico-Philos ophicus, Wittgenstein writes, "The whole sense of the book might be sum med up in the following words: what can be said at all can be said clearly, and what we cannot talk about we must consign to silence." This remark raises four scholarly questions: (1) What can be said? (2) What cannot be said? (3) What distinctions are there between what can and what can not be said? (4) Of what can be said, what counts as saying it clearly? Answers to all four questions are offered and defended. With some minor exceptions, the paper is exegetical, not critical. Vol. LXVII, No. 10: May 20, 1971 Consistency of Belief, HOWARD DARMSTADTER It is argued that the set of beliefs of a rational man is neither logically closed nor logically consistent, and that this situation is not one we can, or should wish to, improve upon. The argument proceeds from an analysis of the way beliefs function in seemingly deductive-nomological explanations and predictions. The adjective "seemingly" is necessary here, for it follows from the argument that there are no pure deductive-nomological explana tions or predictions. In the last part of the paper a constructive, though sketchy account is offered of the place of logic in the ordering of our beliefs. This account partially explains our strong disinclinations to abandon the principle of consistency of belief. The paper concludes with a short general discussion of certain desirable conditions for any theory of belief. THE MONIST Vol. LV, No. 3: July, 1971 Darwin's Metaphor: Does Nature Select?, ROBERT M. YOUNG An attempt is made to suggest common interests among historians of science, intellectual historians and historians of philosophy by means of a</page><page sequence="13">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 161 close analysis of the central concept in Charles Darwin's evolutionary theory: natural selection. The author provides an account of the crucial role which the anthropomorphic analogy between "artificial" and "natural" selection played in the development, exposition, and reception of evolutionism. It is argued that the theological, philosophical, and scientific issues raised in the debate, along with the ways in which Darwin's theory was ambiguous, misunderstood, and partially abandoned can help us to reach a clearer appreciation of its role in the wider debate on (1) man's place in nature; (2) the relationships between man, God, and nature; and (3) the philosophies of science and of nature. Locke's Reputation in Nineteenth-Century England, HANS AARSLEFF During the nineteenth century Locke's reputation was dominated by the hostility of the Germano-Coleridgian school, which held Locke respon sible for everything it disliked. He was said to have made the mind a puny, passive, mechanical thing, and he was called a sensualist, a materialist, a skeptic, and an atheist. As the intellectual ancestor of Condillac, Locke was held responsible for the materialism which the id?ologues wrongly derived from Condillac. In the reaction against Utilitarian thought, Locke was made the whipping-post. He had some knowledgeable defenders and critics (for instance Dugald Steward and John Stuart Mill), but the influential con servative critics (for instance Carlyle, Victor Cousin, William Whewell, and Adam Sedgwick) relied on opinion and misinterpretation rather than on reading and knowledge of Locke. Through Fraser 's edition of the Essay (1894), with its poor text and worse.notes, this evaluation of Locke is still widely and uncritically accepted today. It is the aim of this essay both to throw light on a characteristic expression of nineteenth-century thought and to show how ill-founded is the common opinion of Locke's philosophy that is current even today. Inductivist Versus Deductivist Approaches in the Philosophy of Science as Illustrated by Some Controversies Between Whewell and Mill. GERD BUCHDAHL The following components of appraisal of hypotheses are distinguished: i) formulation; ii) explication; iii) probation; iv) consolidation: v) valida tion. Inductivist and deductivist approaches are then compared in terms of this classification. In Whewell, probation and consolidation means fitting of hypotheses and their integration within theories. In Mill, probation involves an explicit inductive inference. To this there corresponds also a validational notion: inductive inference, though fallible, is a "valid" step. In Mill, the latter boils down to something like "nomic necessity." Whewell's validational doctrine likewise employs a necessarian notion via his theory of "fundamental ideas." The dispute between Whewell and Mill on how to characterize induction is then discussed in terms of the ambiguous notion of "description," a) as correspondence with reality; b) as model of reality. In conclusion, it is shown that neither Mill nor Whewell are clear on the rela tion between probation and validation.</page><page sequence="14">162 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Reid and Hamilton on Perception, B. A. BRODY In this paper, I am concerned with several major modifications made by Sir William Hamilton in Reid's common-sense argument against skepticism about the senses. In particular, Hamilton claimed that light-rays, and not physical objects, are the objects of our acts of perception and that there was only a rebuttable presumption, and not an absolute argument, for trusting a common-sense belief. I argue that these modifications, which severely weaken Reid's argument, have no real justification. William Whewell on the Consilience of Inductions, LARRY LAUDAN Whewell's Consilience of Inductions and Predictions, MARY HESSE In reply to an article by L. Laudan in the same issue, this note con siders two types of problem of consilience: (1) How much is confidence in a theory increased by observing the truth of its entailments other than those it was suggested to explain? (2) If a theory entails new predictions, how much is our confidence in their truth increased by the theory before they are observed ? It is suggested that a probabilistic theory of confirmation can be used very simply to represent the answer to (1), but that full explica tion of Whewell's intentions requires also an answer to (2). The resources of a probability theory with regard to (2) are discussed. Autonomy and the Social Order: The Moral Philosophy of F. D. Maurice. ROBERT HALL F. D. Maurice (1805-1872) was enough of a follower of David Hume to reject the forms of ethical naturalism (attributed to Bentham, Butler? interpreted as a natural law theorist,?and Alexander Bain) current in the 19th century. He held that the human moral reason, which he called the conscience, is autonomous; but that it acts in response to the social order in which it finds itself. Thus while nothing outside of the individual's self awareness can be said to govern man's moral decisions, the social order in which men live plays an essential part in moral thinking. Maurice's view is therefore one in which might be found seeds of a possible mediation of the naturalist-nonnaturalist dispute which has developed in moral philosophy since his day. World Interpretations and Lived Experience, LEE B. BROWN * The author examines certain extensions and applications of the concept of the Lebenswelt in contemporary phenomenological literature. Con temporary discussions fasten onto theconcept of lived experience as a means * This article appeared in Vol. LV, No. 2: April, 1971.</page><page sequence="15">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 163 of guaranteeing the world to be "open" to interpretation in contrast with "abstract" systems which attempt to close or "fix" the world conceptually. A number of ambiguities in the employment of this concept of lived experi ence are described, and it is suggested that the return to lived experience appears to be a return to everyday facts of the "world of the street," but in fact is presentation of another interpretation of things, but one which is pre sented as if not on all fours with others because of a presumed appeal to the "given." It is suggested that a sounder elucidation of the "openness" of the world would dispense with any presumption of acquaintance with the "given." Can Man Transcend his Animality? CHARLES HARTSHORNE * Man alone of the animals on earth knows that all his thinking expres ses his special kind of animality. In knowing this limitation man partly escapes from it. Man does this in two ways. (1) As an animal, he perceives the cosmos from a locality within it; however, by his linguistic capacity for generalization he can stretch his perceptual knowledge to cover wide reaches of space-time, though with two incurable restrictions: it is but a fraction, how small he cannot know, of the space-time whole that he knows even in quantitative outlines; and the concrete particulars are not adequately known even of events close at hand. (2) Yet man can have abstract nonquanti tative metaphysical knowledge applicable to all things, actual or possible. Thus he can know that all events are influenced, yet none concretely determined, by antecedent conditions. On the Limitation of Transcendental Reflection or Is Inter subjectivity Transcendental?, JOHN SALLIS * This essay is an attempt to pose in rigorous fashion the question of the determination of the limitation of reflection. The problem of intersubjec tivity is taken as an appropriate locus for the posing of this question. The posing of the question is then executed by way of a reflection which, directed specifically upon the other, simultaneously engages in continual sef-inter rogation in function of the content which it seeks to reflect?a reflection which, under the requirement that effective reflection terminate in a syn thesis of identification, takes the form of a back-and-forth movement between constitutive origins and that which is originated. The outcome of the reflection is to pose the question of the sociality of reflection and hence to bring the problem of reflection back to the question of the origin of philo sophical thought. * This article appeared in Vol. LV, No. 2: April, 1971.</page><page sequence="16">164 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS THE NEW SCHOLASTICISM Vol. XLV, No. 3: Summer, 1971 Approaches to Supposition Theory, ALAN R. PERREIAH The past 25 years have seen an increasing interest in later medieval logic and in the theory of supposition. A review of literature reveals, however, wide differences of interpretation of supposition-theory. Taking the theory in the widest sense as a contribution to semiotics or the theory of signs, this study shows how supposition has been variously treated as a syntactical, semantical, and even pragmatical theory. The main views of P. Boehner, E. Moody, P. Geach, D. P. Henry, W. C. Kneale, and L. M. De Rijk are examined, compared, and appraised with respect to overall progress in the elucidation of supposition-theory. The Status of Intentional Objects, RICHARD AQUILA Though Roderick Chisholm's formulation of Brentano 's views on intentionality has often been a linguistic one, a point of some metaphysical significance is intended: certain mental phenomena possess a property which is importantly different from that possessed by any obviously physical phe nomenon. The ontological issues which are at stake here center around the apparently relational structure of intentional contexts. If intentional con texts are relational, then it follows that intentionality is a relation and that we are committed to intentional objects. Yet both Brentano and Chisholm deny that their views carry at least the latter of these implications. Chisholm defends this move by claiming that intentionality is not a "descriptive rela tion." This parallels, as Chisholm himself indicates, Brentano's distinction between etwas Relatives and etwas Relativliches, intentionality being, accord ing to Brentano, an instance of the latter. An examination of the proposed distinction shows, however, that either Chisholm's and Brentano's view fails to have the metaphysical significance intended for it, or else etwas Relativliches is also a genuine relation and not, as Brentano claims, merely similar to a relation. But in that case the commitment to intentional objects is once more unavoidable. Peirce's Argument for Thirdness, JOHN J. FITZGERALD This essay is a study of Peirce's experimental proof of realism in the "Lectures on Pragmatism." It tries to show that Peirce's experiment with the dropping of a stone is an instance of the methodology which Peirce had been developing from his reflections on scientific method. Given his method ology, the proof is neither circular nor a mere rhetorical device, but rather offers an empirical approach to philosophy which is a distinct alternative to Hume's approach.</page><page sequence="17">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 165 Plato's Methodological Device at 8Jfal, J. E. THOMAS An interesting shift from arithmetic to geometry occurs at Meno 84a 1 The late Professor James Adam's remarks about the use of arc? at Meno 85b5 reveals a lack of sensitivity to the context of geometrical construction in the slave-boy interview. This leads to the assimilation of the geometrical to the arithmetical sense of ano with the further consequence that the method ological significance of the break at 84al is obscured. A recent article by Professor M. S. Brown overemphasizes the break to the point where the unity of the slave-boy interview is imperiled. Furthermore his faulty view of the respective roles played by arithmetic and geometry in Plato's philos ophy prevents him from correctly assessing Plato's methodological device at 84a 1. An alternative account of the Plato's stratagem is attempted which avoids the difficulties inherent in these views. A Note on Essence and Existence, RALPH MASIELLO Due to a mistranslation of ignorare in the De Ente et Essentia, St. Thomas' argument that existence is other than essence has been miscon strued. The validity of the argument has been questioned by certain con temporary Thomists, and this brought into question the problem of the intelligibility of existence itself. These two problems are necessarily related. In the course of presenting Gil son's views on the intelligibility of existence, which had the effect of nullifying Maritain 's teachings on the metaphysical intuition of being, a further clarification of St. Thomas' theory on the knowledge of individuals was in order. (This latter part has been delib erately shortened so as not to detract from the main thesis established in the beginning.) A Re-examination of Hume's Essay on Miracles, KYLE WALLACE Critics of Hume often claim that Part I of Section X of his Enquiry Con cerning Human Understanding, the famous essay on miracles, is incon sistent with his thorough-going empiricism. The purpose of this paper is to refute such claims. If one considers Hume's criterion for a reasonable man, one will discover that he in fact argues that the evidence against a mira cle is as strong as can possibly be adduced. Hume does not claim that mira cles are logically impossible, but rather that a reasonable man, after being confronted by a tumultuous set of events, will simply refuse to accept as miraculous the events he has witnessed. For if they deserved to be labeled as miracles, they would be dismissed by a man who is reasonable, i.e., one who proportions his belief to the evidence. Humpty Dumpty and the "Sneaky 0" Proposition, THEODORE JAMES F. F. Centore has made some challenging statements about the "true" interpretation of propositions of the type of "Not Every X is Y" and "All X's are not Y." An historical survey of the logical analysis of such propositions</page><page sequence="18">166 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS shows that it is somewhat Humpty Dumpty-ish to eliminate as incorrect all interpretations except the one he concludes must be true, viz., that these propositions are equivalent to a conjunction of I and 0 propositions. It is suggested that in colloquial usage such statements are used to negate an A proposition and that some people are not sure how such a negation should be phrased and what different types of negations imply. It is further suggested that an attempt be made to reach some agreement about the logical analysis of such statements so that in courses in Logic we may advise our students to use statements that will be useful for definite meaningful communication. NOUS Vol. V, No. 1: February, 1971 Verificationism and Transcendental Arguments, RICHARD RORTY Transcendental Arguments, MOLTKE S. GRAM Essentially Arising Questions and the Ontology of a Natural Language, CHARLES E. CATON Given a simple sentence, there is a small set of questions that "es sentially arise" in the sense of necessarily having affirmative answers. The paper urges that the questioned constituents in these questions can be regard ed as especially important in fixing the ontological categories inherent in the language. These "essential constituents" universally negativized form nega tions of sentences and indefinitely pronominalized form entailed existential sentences. Without using any assumptions as to the form of an empirical semantical description, attention is thus directed to a part of it that would reveal (perhaps not all) the basic ontological categories of a language. Has the Present Any Duration?, RICHARD M. GALE The Cosmological Argument, WILLIAM L.

Specifying a set of basic democratic principles, and granting their truth, I present several kinds of cases in which I yet have not the right</page><page sequence="19">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 167 to a voice in decisions that affect my life. Holding that democracy is one form of community government, I argue that the right to participation in decision-making in any community depends essentially upon the fact of one's membership (and the kind one's membership) in the community in question. Mechanism and Phenomenology, HUBERT L. DREYFUS Vol. V, No. 2: May, 1971 Concern and Topic, MITCHELL GINSBERG Very basically, this article is concerned with the notion of aboutness as it applies to statements. Two basic notions of aboutness which are differentiated in the paper are those of concern and topic. Although the under lying interest here, especially in.introducing the notion of topic, is in transla tion theory, implications along these lines are kept secondary. The discus sion leads to distinguishing between statements and propositions (and more basically, between these and sentences), as well as to discussion both of intentionality and intentional objects (as topics, for example, under at least some explications of intentionality), and also of indirect discourse. On the Ontological Priority of Physical Objects, B. A. BRODY This paper begins with a critical analysis of Strawson's arguments for the claim that physical objects are ontologically prior to all other individuals. It is shown that his arguments employ several major assumptions whose justification is very unclear. I then suggest that more progress could be made by thinking about these issues in terms of the problem of identity rather than, as he does, in terms of the problem of individuation. Finally, I offer a new argument, based upon the theory of identity for particulars, for the ontological priority of enduring entities. Counter)actual Hypotheses, Laws, and Dispositions, NICHOLAS RESCHER States of Affairs Again, RODERICK M. CHISHOLM Toward A Theory of Recurrence, STEPHEN E. BRAUDE Using a minimal and in some respects novel tense-logical apparatus, this paper offers an alternative to R. M. Chisholm's recent attempt (in Nous, Feb. 1970) to reduce talk about particular occurrences of events to talk just about events. But whereas Chisholm's version required postulating an ontology including such suspicious entities as conjunctive and negative</page><page sequence="20">168 PHI LOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS events, my analogue reduction requires only an ontology of events simpliciter. Substitutional Quantification and Quotation, GILBERT HARMAN Suppose a cumulative hierarchy of metalanguages and suppose that the quotation of an expression in L is not an expression in L but only in higher languages in the hierarchy. Quotation marks carry subscripts indicating the language to which the quoted expression belongs. Using substitutional quantification define "trueL" and "denotesL" as follows. x is trueL = df ( 3 s) (x ? "ls"l &amp; s) x denotesLy = df ( 3 z) (x = "lz"l &amp; z = y).

What George Could Not Have Been, ALVIN PLANTINGA THE PHILOSOPHICAL QUARTERLY Vol. XXI, No. 83: April, 1971 Arguing from Ignorance, RICHARD ROBINSON Arguing from ignorance is recommending a proposition on the ground that its contradictory is not known to be true, or not proved to be true, or without reason, or without explanation. It is often disguised as a question, as in "May it not be that?." It is a bad form of argument; for the absence of a proof of a statement is not the presence of a proof of any other statement. Cases where we seem to have a good argument from ignorance are often not really arguments but practical decisions. In natural science, however, the argument for our laws of nature seems to be that we do not know of any evidence that they are false. This is a sort of argument from ignorance; but it is rendered respectable by the implicit it premisses that we have tried hard to find evidence against these laws, and should have found some if it existed.</page><page sequence="21">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 169 Are Mechanistic and Teleological Explanations of Behavior Incompatible? N. J. BLOCK Taylor and Malcolm have claimed that mechanistic and teleological explanations of behavior are incompatible. Taylor uses the terms "mechan istic explanation" and "teleological explanation" descriptively, while Malcolm uses them referentially. Thus while Taylor thinks finding a mechanistic explanation would show everyday teleological explanations to be non teleological, Malcolm holds that since some teleological explanations are true, no general mechanistic account of behavior could be correct. Both Taylor and Malcolm assume that a mechanistic account "must be one according to which changing the intention, other things being equal, would have no effect on the behavior." I argue that reducing a teleological psychological theory to e.g., a physico-chemical theory is possible, and that such a reduction would be compatible with the facts about the effect of intention on action. Taylor and Malcolm also argue that laws relating intention and action are non-contingent, and therefore cannot be derived from contingent mechan istic laws. Their argument falls on such points as that whether distinct things are contingently related depends on the descriptions used to refer to them. The Objectivity of Value Judgments, HUGO MEYNELL This article sets out to prove that the "fact-value" dichotomy, at least as generally understood, is based on a series of mistakes. It is argued that there is a relation of "loose entailment" between value-judgments and certain kinds of factual judgment, such that, though the negation of no one factual judgment so ?ntailed can reduce a given value-judgment to nonsense, the more such factual judgments are negated, the more these negations will tend so to reduce it. The argument is applied to a detailed rebuttal of influential claims by Moore, Hare, and Hume. The Moral Gradation of Punishment, MICHAEL CLARK The stimulus for writing this paper was the difficulty which Hart's approach to the morality of punishment (utilitarianism tempered by retributive provisos) faces in answering the question: how severely may a legal authority punish an offender? It may reasonably be urged that punish ment should neither exceed what the offender deserves in respect of his moral guilt nor exceed what is imposed for equally or less serious offences. If we take into account the utilitarian demand that punishment should be sufficient to achieve certain ends, we find it is impossible always to satisfy all these principles fully. But that this is so should not be held to discredit some of the principles involved, as recent writers like M. Goldinger and the crim inologist Nigel Walker seem to contend.</page><page sequence="22">170 PH ILOSOPHI CAL ABSTRACTS Two Justifications of Punishment, MICHAEL LESSNOFF The proper place of the two competing traditional theories of punish ment, the utilitarian and the retributive, is illuminated by considering punishment as one of a class of institutions and actions that impose suffering (to a greater or lesser degree) on individuals. Such institutions and actions require dual justification: first, by showing that they bring about a valuable state of affairs (teleological justification); second, by showing why one is entitled to do so by means involving suffering (entitling justification). If punishment is justified, its teleological justification is utilitarian, its entitl ing justification retributive. A similar duality of justifications is applicable to other institutions imposed on people by the state, such as taxation, military conscription, compulsory purchase of property, and quarantine regulations. The Dilemma of the Grundlegung, DOROTHY WALSH The source of the unresolved dilemma is that wrong actions are wrong because they are cases of kinds of action, but that right actions are right because they are individual actions motivated by a sense of duty. The judgment that an action is the kind of action that is not not-wrong does not warrant the judgment that it is or would be right. Rightness is a matter of individual motivation and so of individual action. I can perform a right action by resisting temptation to do what is wrong because it is wrong and for no other reason, but I cannot perform a right action by doing what is right because it is right and for no other reason. The moral knowledge said to be available to all rational beings is confined to the knowledge of the morally wrong. Vol. XXI, No. 84: July, 1971 Willing and Acting, W. F. R. HARDIE It is argued that much of the criticism directed, in recent philosophy against "volitions" "acts of will" and "willing" fails to damage the doctrines which this terminology was used to express. Volitions, conceived as causes of actions, are said to be fictions which generate logical absurdities. But users of the terminology, e.g., Locke, Austin, James, and Prichard, treated willing as a constituent rather than an antecedent of actions. While these terms can be used misleadingly, they usefully direct attention to questions about what James called "mental cues" and hence to the distinction between the things we do by doing something else and the things we just do. In the second half of the article the writer examines Hart's account of Austin's treatment of volition in Lectures in Jurisprudence, Anscombe's objections in Intentions to "willing," Melden's criticisms of Prichard and Vesey's rejection of "the ideo-motor theory."</page><page sequence="23">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 171 The Problem of Universals, A. C. EWING The article insists that the problem cannot be dismissed as linguistic and not metaphysical, or "universals" all analyzed merely in terms of resemblances without admitting different kinds of resemblances and so introducing ostensible entities as odd as the universals of quality. It is pointed out however that, if from one point of view it seems as if universals have to be explained away, from another it seems that we can find nothing particular in a thing beyond universals. This suggests that the contrast is not one between different elements of content, but it is maintained that it is as essential to distinguish between classes of universals and specific qualities as it is between classes of things and individuals. Blanshard's theory which reduces particulars to groups of specific universals and Stout's which carries out the opposite process are both discussed critically. Must a Materialist Pretend He's Anaesthetized?, DON LOCKE An examination of the argument that Central State Materialism com mits us to denying conscious experience of the sort that every conscious per son is familiar with. This argument depends on a conflation of what is experienced with the experience itself, but is rendered more plausible by the tendency of Materialists 1) to speak in terms appropriate to a causal theory of perception when materialism commits us to a realist theory; 2) to speak of the theory as "The Identity Theory," which obscures the crucial distinc tion between the Double Aspect theory and Materialism, the latter asserting an identification rather than an identity; and 3) to deny the existence of phenomenal properties in the form that we actually perceive them. Never theless there is an unresolved difficulty for Materialism in just those cases where what is perceived does not have objective, physical existence. Master Speech Acts, N. FOTION Master speech acts have the power to control other speech acts. When a speaker says, "Let me describe what happened," the speech acts which follow are, in effect, labelled in advance. The string of descriptive speech acts can be broken by a master speech act stopper (e.g., "Let's change the subject," "Let's go get a beer.") Another master speech act can now be invoked (e.g., "Once upon a time") to give a new setting to the next string of speech acts. By invoking master speech acts of one kind or another, a speaker can vary the setting of the language to follow in a variety of other ways (e.g., for purposes of praying, theorizing, prescribing, declaring beliefs.) Depending then on the master speech act invoked, ordinary language can be made more or less precise (more or less regimented, etc.). These powers which ordinary language possesses suggest certain interesting questions. Is the fact-value distinction supposed to hold for all of ordinary language or is it more appropriate to say that this distinction holds (or fails to hold) only under the jurisdiction of certain master speech acts? Also how about the ethics-meta-ethics distinction? However these questions are answered, it is clear that until the notion of master speech act is taken into</page><page sequence="24">172 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS account, no account of the validity or invalidity of such basic distinctions can be taken seriously. THE PHILOSOPHICAL REVIEW Vol. LXXX, No. 1: January, 1971 Personal Identity, DEREK PARFIT Some people believe that the identity of a person over time is, in its nature, all-or-nothing. This belief makes them assume that, in the so called "problem cases," the question "Would it still be me?" must have, both a definite answer, and great importance. I deny these assumptions. I suggest that the identity of a person over time is only, in its logic, all-or nothing. In its nature, it is a matter of degree. I then propose a way of thinking in which this would be recognized. The Logical Structure of Anselm's Arguments, ROBERT M. ADAMS The argument of ch. 2 of Anselm's Proslogion is formalized as a valid argument in modern logical symbolism. It is seen to depend on certain assumptions about the relation of existence and predication. Gaunilo's "lost island" counterexample shows that these assumptions must be mod ified, if not rejected. Formalizations are also offered for the argument of Proslogion 3 and an argument from Anselm's reply to Gaulino. It is argued that the latter, a modal argument, is at least a better argument than the Proslogion 2 argument and shows that the crucial question about logically necessary divine existence is whether it is possible. The Proslogion 3 argument can be treated as an argument that it could not be a logically con tingent truth that God exists; but it cannot consistently be used in this way by someone who believes logically necessary existence is impossible. Aristotle on Demarcating the Five Senses, RICHARD SORABJI Aristotle emphasizes the sense-objects in his account of four of the senses, though he does not forget other factors. So far his policy is a good one. He is right too in treating touch differently. But he goes wrong in defining it as the sense that operates by contact. Instead he should have appealed, like Plato and other predecessors, to the absence of any obvious localized organ.</page><page sequence="25">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 173 Vol. LXXX, No. 2: April, 1971 Ontology and Mathematics, CHARLES PARSONS The paper discusses the ontological commitment of elementary and constructive theories in mathematics. In contrast to Quine's position, in dealing with finitary arithmetic it is necessary to consider alternative con ceptions of ontology from that based on classical quantificational logic. An account of the existence of numbers is developed which might be taken to claim the existence only of inscriptions, but it works only because it uses a different conception of existence, involving modality. For this reason it does not qualify as "nominalist." I argue that contrary to what is suggested by some writers, stronger "abstract" conceptions in constructive mathematics require not a richer ontology (with intensional entities) but additional predicates, e.g., truth predicates. It is explained how to interpret predicative set theory in the same way. Aristotle on Sameness and Oneness, NICHOLAS P. WHITE This article discusses features of Aristotle's notions of "sameness" and "oneness" in the Topics and other works, with the notable exception of the middle?chronologically late?books of the Metaphysics. It is argued that whereas the Topics shows concern with the notion of identity as that notion figures in what is often called "Leibniz' Law," this concern flags in other works. Instead, Aristotle is there more concerned?not with what it is for X and Y to be identical, but?with what it is for two distinct things to be (spatial or temporal) parts of a single, unitary object. It is argued that this deflection of Aristotle's interest is caused by his preoccupation with certain problems raised by Plato. The same factor is also used to explain a confusion which he often makes between identity and certain kinds of similarity. A suggestion is made about the bearing of these results on his contrast between kinesis and energeia. A Defense of Skepticism, PETER UNGER The skepticism which the author defends is the view that every human being knows, at most, hardly anything to be so. It is argued that "know ing," like "cube," is a defined absolute term; just as being a cube requires having surfaces which are flat, knowing something requires one to be certain of the thing. It is argued that "flat" and "certain," unlike "bumpy" and "doubtful," have special features which make their application to reality somewhat doubtful. This doubtfulness is passed along to the defined terms.</page><page sequence="26">174 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS PHILOSOPHY Vol. XLVI, No. 176: April, 1971 Kierkegaard and the Truth of Christianity, PAUL EDWARDS Kierkegaard's theory identifying truth with subjectivity has been hailed by contemporary existentialists as a "major turning point in European philosophy." It has been claimed that Kierkegaard discovered a kind of truth different from the only kind, "objective" truth, recognized by scientists and metaphysicians like Plato and Hegel. It has also been maintained that Kierkegaard's doctrine provides believers with a justification for their belief, even in the absence of any evidence. This article attempts to show that all such claims are totally baseless. It is argued that Kierkegaard has in fact two positions, one of which involves a new and fallacious argument for Christianity, while the other is a moral recommendation that is consistent with a thorough-going atheism. Breadth and Depth of Understanding, DAVID POLE Understanding in much recent philosophy is explained in terms of verbal or other behavior; "inner" events, such as flashes of understanding, being discounted or treated as inessential. Deeper understanding will there fore show itself in a subtler or surer performance. But first arguments purporting to establish the logical priority of behavior over experience prove to have no force. Understanding, fully actualized, must be episodic and experiential. Nor, secondly, does attention admit of any behavioral analysis; and fuller attention involves a changed experience simply qua experience. Thought is essentially directional, and attention is intrinsic to the process. It must be possible to notice difficulties, and hence focus atten tion on relevant features; hence again new aspects or relations tend to emerge. That they do lies in the nature of the case; for otherwise any deliberate attempt at problem-solving would be futile. Kant or Cantor?: That the Universe, if Real, Must be Finite in both Space and Time, PAMELA M. HUBY The first part indicates some weaknesses in Russell's arguments that Kant, in his first Antinomy, has misunderstood the concept of infinity. The second part argues that an actual infinity of real individuals existing together in space is impossible. Arguments for the infinity of the universe have, with one unconvincing exception, been arguments for the infinity of space, which is not itself fully real but parasitic on matter. They cannot be extended to cover the infinity of matter. It is a type-mistake to suppose that there can be an infinite number of real individuals in the universe. Russell's theory of numbers as classes of classes is partly intensional (Peano), and partly extensional (Frege). Numbers used in counting real individuals must be extensional and finite, for infinite numbers are only extensional. Similar arguments can be used about past time.</page><page sequence="27">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 175 Tarski, Frege and the Liar Paradox, AARON SLOMAN Tarski and others argued that the liar paradoxes prove that ordinary language is inconsistent, and that in a consistent language using normal logic the paradox sentences must be syntactically ill-formed. How then can ordinary language work so well? An answer is offered by using Frege's generalization of the sense/reference distinction from names to sentences, and examining various ways in which well-formed names and sentences may have a sense yet contingently or necessarily lack a reference. E.g., some meaningful sentences necessarily lack a truth-value. Tarski did not allow for this. This semantic analysis of paradoxes, based on the distinction between an identification procedure (sense) and its outcome (reference), involves a new theory of 'true' and other metalinguistic predicates. Vol. XLVIII, No. 177: July, 1971 Ought and Ought Not, RICHARD ROBINSON Ought is used in (1) moral, (2) prudential, (3) ideal, and (4) prob ability, judgments. Often it is used in more than one of these ways at once, with bad results. Derivations of ought from is, even if never formally valid, are often good inferences. Ought and ought not are not contradictories but contraries. But we often assume that they are contradictories; and this has bad consequences. It may lead to 'moral imperialism', the notion that every act either ought to be done or ought not to be done, so that there is nothing which we are free to do or omit as we please. There is a tendency to this in Hare's books. The Concept of Hierarchy, AUREL KOLNAI Plato and His Liberal Opponents, LASZLO G. VERSENYI This article in directed against those of Plato's critics who argue that the Republic's basic premiss that there can be such a thing as a moral or political knowledge is false and that the acceptance of his premiss leads to dangerous moral and political conclusions. The argument of the article is that Plato's opponents are wrong on both counts; that it is their rather than Plato's premiss that leads to undesirable moral and political con sequences, and that Plato's political theory in fact provides a better philo sophical foundation for the establishment of liberal political institutions than that of his liberal opponents. Plato's Analogy of State and Individual, JEROME NEU The bases, uses, and implications of Plato's analogy between state and individual in terms of virtues and (tripartite) structure are examined.</page><page sequence="28">176 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Various uses of "justice" and theses involving them are distinguished. It is denied that Plato is committed to (in some insidious sense) "personifying" the state, either by his "order of argument" or some "organic step" from reification to deification. He does not wish to subordinate the individual to the state; where he nonetheless does it is not because of an analogy which makes the state a monster individual with interests superior to and independ ent of those of ordinary citizens. The paternalism, exploitation, and worse derive rather from a doctrine of objective interests discernible by those with special training and ability, interests which later thinkers (and perhaps Plato) have taken to be the object of a "real will." Doubts About Prima Facie Duties, HENRY JACK * In this reply to a recent article in Philosophy by Peter Jones the author agrees with Jones that Ross's distinction between prima facie and actual duties is unsatisfactory, but challenges on textual grounds Jones' other two main criticisms: that Ross committed himself, first, to a self-evident knowledge of general principles of actual as well as prima facie duties, and, second, to the view that the application of action description terms (e.g., lying) in moral judgments about particular actions cannot be mistaken. PHILOSOPHY AND PHENOMENOLOGICAL RESEARCH Vol. XXXI, No. 4: June, 1971 Imagination: Imagining and the Image, EDWARD S. CASEY Imagination is examined in two of its essential aspects through a phenomenological analysis. Imagining is defined as the conscious projec tion and contemplation of objects posited as pure (vs. hypothetical) pos sibilities. The image is then seen as the indeterminate presentation of an imagined object to consciousness. An image is not itself an object but a special type of field in which imagined objects appear. Such objects can be real or unreal, but neither kind of object can be considered a species of perceptual objects. As synthetic and not merely composite, imagined objects are essentially independent from perception; unreal imagined objects in particular possess only the most tenuous theoretical perceivability. The non-perceivable aspect of mental images is distinguished from their material support in an external image or work of art. The conclusion is drawn that images and imagined objects together form the total intentional correlate of the act of imagining. * This article appeared in Volume XLVI, No. 175: January, 1971.</page><page sequence="29">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 177 Ontological Simplicity and the Identity Hypothesis, FREDERICK STOUTLAND The hypothesis that sensations are identical with brain processes is not ontologically simpler than dualistic alternatives. On the one hand, it does not entail that the subject of sensations is identical with the subject of brain processes. On the other hand, it entails that brain processes have sensations properties, properties which are unique to sentient beings and which cannot be merely intentional. But whether we accept or reject the hypothesis makes little difference to our conception of human nature, and philosophers would do well to turn their attention to other matters. Variety of Meaning in the Concept of Decadence, HENRY WINTHROP The author reviews briefly some of the meanings that have been attach ed to the term, "decadence." He then elects to discuss the meaning attached to this term in the work of four major thinkers: Marcuse, Joad, Ortega y Gasset and Sorokin. For Marcuse, decadence is the expression of social thinking that is without vision and has outlived its usefulness. For Joad, decadence is "the dropping of the object," that is, the quest for experience valued for its own sake and the pleasure it provides, without asking to what ends the experiences sought are to be put. For Ortega y Gasset decadence is the insistence on living in the here and now with no constant pursuit of moral, aesthetic or social meaning. For Sorokin, decadence occurs when a culture becomes sensate, that is, when its main themes become the pursuit of the commonplace. The Limits of Decision, JOHN M. HEMS The failure to distinguish between obligation and duty has led to wide spread and fundamental error among philosophers, and yet ordinary lan guage implies the distinction: obligations are things we fulfill whereas duties are things we do. We do not do obligations. Confusion of obligation with duty has led to the commonly accepted notion that obligation is a matter for decision, but a little reflection suffices to reveal the absurdity of this. You cannot decide that you ought to do anything. In Kantian terms this means that autonomy of the will is incompatible with a categorical imperative, and that the area of decision is limited in scope to a degree that should worry Existentialists. B. F. Skinner's Skepticism about Choices and Future Consequences, JOHN COPELAND Skinner explicitly insists that choices, if they occur, are irrelevant to the explanation, prediction, and control of behavior. But this thesis has grave difficulties with suicide and deliberate starvation. In addition, Skin ner is not consistent with his skepticism, for several of his own claims</page><page sequence="30">178 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS explicitly use the language of choice. Skinners radical behaviorism and physicalism automatically rule out the philosophical claim that the present idea of, and present desire for, specific future consequences may be causal factors in human actions. It has not been shown that reliable predictions and explanations of human behavior can be achieved without reference to the human organism's present anticipations of the future. Furthermore, Skinner himself inconsistently refers to the Marshall Plan (as originally con ceived), Point Four, etc. as "proposals to make certain changes in the environments of men for the sake of consequences. ..." Once again he uses the very notions which his skeptical doctrines explicitly deny. Cartesian Privilege and the Strictly Mental, HAROLD MORICK In Defense of the Brain Process Theory, JERROLD TANNENBAUM Part II. Meinong's Analysis of Relations, KENNETH BARBER Meinong's second Hume Study is devoted to the problem of relations. The British Empiricists, especially Hume, are discussed at length on this point and, in addition, Meinong provides his own analysis of relations. The relations of similarity and equality are examined in detail since these rela tions allegedly provide the ground for the application of general words in Meinong's nominalistic system of the Hume Studies. It is argued in the paper that Meinong has an ingenious though ultimately unsuccessful solution to the problem of ordering qualities in a continuum. RATIO Vol. XIII, No. 1: June, 1971 Kant, Incongruous Counterparts and the Nature of Space and Space-Time, JOHN EARMAN This paper presents a critical examination of some rather curious arguments of Kant's which purport to show that some alleged properties of space can be derived from some alleged facts about incongruous counter parts. It also seeks to provide some preliminary answers to some important questions about the nature of space-time which are raised by Kant's ar guments.</page><page sequence="31">CURRENT PERIODICAL ARTICLES 179 Animadversions on Plantinga's Kant, R. C. COBURN In a recent paper, Alvin Plantinga presents three "interpretations" of "the heart of Kant's objection" to "the Ontological Argument." He argues that when Kant's objection is construed in accordance with the first of these interpretations, it is subject to an obvious difficulty; and when it is con strued in accordance with the other two interpretations, it is irrelevant to the version of the Ontological Argument presented by Anselm in Proslogion II. In concluding he argues that what Kant in fact showed in the section of the Critique under consideration is also nothing to which Anselm need have objected. I argue that neither of the first two interpretations Plantinga offers is at all plausible, and that he is wrong in thinking that the third interpretation he offers makes Kant's objection irrelevant to "the Ontological Argument." I also indicate what Kant was saying in the passages in question and why he fails to establish the theses he presents. About Criteria, J. L. THOMPSON If the proposition "A's are B" is empirical, then, it would seem, there must be some way of identifying an A which does not depend on any empirical discovery or theory about A's. Indeed there do seem to be con cepts, the criteria and definitions of which rest on conventions?conventions which in turn depend on the interests and attitudes of the people using the concepts. Artifacts, for instance are identified by function. On the other hand, the criteria and definitions of concepts in scientific theories do seem to be empirically vulnerable. One of the problems in the philosophy of mind is to determine to which group terms like 'dreaming', 'having a pain', 'being angry', belong. Brentano's Necessitarianism, N. M. L. NATHAN Paternalism and Morality, C. L. TEN It has sometimes been argued, particularly by Lord Devlin in The Enforcement of Morals, that paternalism is ultimately indistinguishable from the legal enforcement of a society's shared morality. There are, however, two aspects of paternalism: a decision-aspect and a consequence-aspect. The former refers to the different ways in which the agent's decision to act in a particular manner is vitiated or impaired, while the latter refers to the undesirable consequences of the act. These two aspects of paternalism are used to explain how the confusion between paternalism and the legal enforce ment of morality arises. It is argued that it is quite consistent to accept a degree of paternalism while rejecting the legal enforcement of morality, and the article also considers the extent to which a paternalistic policy may be pursued.</page><page sequence="32">180 PHILOSOPHICAL ABSTRACTS Motives and Virtues in the Platonic Ethics, EDITH WATSON SCHIPPER This paper interprets Plato's mature ethics as both teleological and an ethics of motives. Just (and other virtuous) acts, rather than being merely "right," must be motivated by a wish for and knowledge of a good which is wider than the personal happiness they entail. All men have this wish for what is good, though it is indefinite until accompanied by knowledge of what it is. When the wish is not accompanied by knowledge, it gives rise to the mistaken choices of "involuntary" acts. The Republic shows that the universally desired good is a common good, not the merely personal hap piness accruing to just acts, even when that happiness is viewed as involved in that of others. Hence, truly just acts cannot be motivated by a desire for it. Acts which are so motivated could be only conventionally just. The really just man, who has dialectically attained to knowledge that the good he desires is a social good, is motivated not only by its consequences but by its intrinsic attraction. A Reconstruction of Berkeley: Minds and Physical Objects as Theoretical Entities, JAMES W. CORNMAN J. 0. Nelson on Logical Notation, G. ENGLEBRETSEN I argue here that the paradoxical nature of the confirmations of "All ravens are black" and its contra positive is not due to their logical identity. The paradox results from the belief that we begin confirming a universal categorical by picking-out those items which satisfy its subject term. But, since "nonblacks" is not a genuine "sortal" predicate, it is impossible to pick-out those things which satisfy it. Thus, whatever must be picked-out for the confirmation of "All nonblacks are nonravens" cannot be what satisfies the subject term. It would seem that what a sentence is about (what it would be necessary to pick-out in order to confirm it) need not be what satisfies its subject term. If indeed the two sentences of the paradox share a common semantic character (are about the same things), then the paradox cannot be a logical one. A Non-logician's Reply, J. 0.
