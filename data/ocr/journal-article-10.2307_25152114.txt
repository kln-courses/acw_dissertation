Several other vessels from this series previously acquired by the Museum have been discussed in an earlier Bulletin.2 The silver objects from these recent finds conform generally to the Sasanian silver already known from earlier chance discoveries, mainly in Russia, and to a lesser degree, in Iran itself. The objects from these earlier Russian and Iranian finds have consisted of plates, bowls of various forms, ewers, jugs, vases or bottles and, exceptionally, a pair of rhyta in the form of antelope, or saiga, heads.3 In general, the Dailaman material has added considerably to the variety of these objects both in shape and decoration, but it has added nothing which is startlingly new.

They are with out precedent among the previously known metal work of the Sasanian period and add an entirely new dimension to our knowledge of the silversmith's art of the time. The most striking feature of the magnificent rhyton (Cover) in which we believe it may be pos sible to see the personification of the Avestan angel, Drvaspa, is the obviously Indian character of the beautiful human head. This is particularly evident in the full, sensuous mouth, the slightly slanting, almond-shaped eyes, and the fine straight nose which continues the line of the brows. The lobes of the ears are extended in the Indian fashion to take the great disk-shaped earrings, but the soft waves of the hair seem to go back to a classical-or Hellenistic-pro totype. At her throat is a necklace composed of a cabuchon in a rectangular bezel and on either side a single pearl; the jewels are carried by a ribbon which is knotted in back and terminates in charac teristically Sasanian "fluttering" ribbons (cf. Fig. 22). The head of the bull is modeled with unusual strength and vigor. There is a feeling of naturalism, perhaps influenced by Hellenistic traditions, but this is over powered by a dominant Iranian stylization which is expressed in the simplification of the planes and the emphasis on lines and musculature which assume a decorative role. The main body of the vessel was worked in re pousse in two sections which are joined by a collar of silver inside the necks of the two parts and to which they are soldered. (This collar can just be seen at the edge of the break in Figure 20b, which shows the head part of the rhyton before restoration.) The elaborate earrings and the extended part of the earlobes were made separately and soldered in place. The horns and ears of the bull were each hammered to shape from flat pieces of metal. The horns consist of two pieces: the upper element, curved downward as an inverted U, is closed on the underside by the second 289</page><page sequence="3">piece. The ends of the horns, the ears, and the little tube which forms the spout issuing from the animal's mouth were inserted in openings left for them and secured with solder. In the crown of the woman's head is a small opening, three-quarters of an inch in diameter, by which the vessel could be filled; it is reinforced by a narrow collar of silver inserted in the opening and soldered. Just inside the opening are still preserved a loop and a link of chain which evidently once held a cover which fitted over the protruding edge of the collar. The loop is fastened by a rivet, the head of which is visible on the exterior of the vessel. The modeling has been entirely achieved by repousse with only a minimum of chasing. On the woman's face the chasing has been limited to the pupils of the eyes and the little locks of hair which hang in front of her ears. The details of the hair are chased over waves modeled in repousse. The jewels of the necklace are raised in high relief, but the rib bon, which is only slightly raised on the front of the neck, becomes flatter as it continues around, and is indicated in back only by chased lines. On the bull only the details of the hair between the horns and around the mouth and on the underside of the muzzle are chased. As can be seen in the color illustration, there is a limited use of gilding which was applied by the mercury process. On the woman's head, the gild ing occurs only on the earrings, the bezel of the cen tral jewel, and the three ornamental spots on the face-a rather large, flame-like device on the fore head and two tiny round dots on the cheeks. The horns, the crown of the hair between the horns, the eyebrows, and the muzzle on the bull are gilded. The petals which ornament the earrings were inlaid with green glass, of which a few elements remain. The eyes of the bull are deeply and sharply recessed and were almost certainly inlaid with colored glass like the earrings, or with some other material which, like the glass of the earrings, was held in place by an adhesive material-apparently bitumen-of which traces remain. On the back of the neck (Fig. 22) is an engraved inscription in Sasanian-Pahlavi which gives the weight of the object.4 The crudeness of the engraving and the fact that it arbitrarily cuts across the designs of the ribbons shows that it was done by another-less trained-hand than that which pro duced the rhyton and by one not concerned with it as a work of art. It was almost certainly added long after the rhyton was made. The superb horse which constitutes the second rhyton corresponds exactly to the breed which is represented as the mounts of the Sasanian kings on the series of great rock reliefs, such as the "Investi ture of Bahram I" at Bishapur (Fig. 9). In its form, and particularly in the details of its trappings, it also closely resembles those on many of the Sasanian silver plates with royal hunting scenes. These are the great horses of Iran and Central Asia which were so coveted by the other peoples of Asia all during an tiquity. It was in quest of these famous horses that the Assyrians first invaded Media in the ninth cen tury B.C., and, several hundred years later, the Han emperor of China sent an expeditionary force of sixty thousand men across Asia to acquire these same great "blood-sweating horses." This fine Iranian breed was esteemed because of its superior strength and speed. Physically, this is evidenced by the heavy massive form, with its relatively small head and short, thick neck and heavy shoulders. These are the features which the Sasanian artists-sculptors and silversmiths-have captured so successfully. Our silver horse is shown fully caparisoned with the same trappings that are worn by horses on other Sasanian monuments-with the one difference that instead of having bit and reins, which are not needed as there is no rider, it wears a muzzle over the mouth. Dr. Roman Ghirshman5 reports having found similar muzzles in bronze and iron in the Sasanian level at Susa. On the head there is a richly ornamented head stall with little ribbons fluttering from the points where the straps meet on the cheeks. Over the back there is a wide saddlecloth with little tassels hanging from the four corners. It is decorated with the same pattern of rosettes which were usually employed by the Sasanian silversmiths for this purpose. On either side of the saddlecloth, just about at the withers, are two protuberances which appear to represent hard bosses-presumably wood or metal-held in place by leather or metal bands fastened by rivets to the saddlecloth. These protuberances obviously represent a sort of rudimentary saddle. This is important be cause it is the first evidence that we have of the use of the saddle in Sasanian times. Normally the horses are accompanied by mounted riders whose clothing 290</page><page sequence="4">conceals these saddle bosses which apparently we may now assume were generally in use in the Sasanian period. The saddlecloth is held in place by the usual breast collar, girth, breaching, and crupper which are still used in modern saddlery. Here the straps are wide and ornamented with hatching; at the center of the strap across the chest are two little ornamental medallions. The mane is hogged, but with three long strands left hanging on either side, in the ancient nomadic tradition, for the rider to grasp as an aid in mounting. The foretop is tied into a large tuft which stands high on the forehead, and the tail is cropped short and bound with a ribbon from which the two ends hang freely beneath the tail. That this is no ordinary horse is indicated by the two medallions containing human figures which are represented like huge phalerae on its shoulders. In each of the medallions is the bust of a mature, bearded and mustached man with long hair. The figures are represented in high relief in such a way that they appear to emerge from the horse's body. The figure on the right shoulder holds a ring in his outstretched right hand; in his left hand is a small cup-like object. The second man stretches out his right hand to receive the ring and holds his left hand concealed in his sleeve in the traditional Near Eastern expression of humility. We will return later to the possible significance of these figures and the meaning which they are evidently intended to impart to the horse. Like the Drvaspa rhyton, the horse rhyton was fashioned in two parts, each worked separately in repousse and fitted together. An opening in the chest forms the spout, and there are openings into which the foretop and tail are fitted like corks. The latter were each fashioned separately from flat strips of metal and rolled up into the desired shape. The ele ment comprising the foretop is now hollow, but the tail is filled with a lead core; the ribbon ends are formed of separate pieces of wire, inserted in holes and soldered in place. A length of chain is held by rings soldered to the back of the horse, and another is similarly fastened across the chest. When found, the vessel was badly crushed (cf. Fig. 23), but the two halves were already in precisely the same form as today. It is difficult to reconcile the rough and uneven manner in which the two edges are cut with the finesse of the rest of the work, and it is possible that the vessel was damaged in antiquity and the original edges of the join were modified. However, from the diameters of the two sections, there seems little doubt that they must originally have fitted into one another as at present. This is substantiated by the fact that only in this position is the girth correctly located in accordance with other representations of Sasanian horses. Precisely how the vessel can have held liquid is no longer clear; there is no evidence that the two halves were ever soldered together or that they fitted more tightly than at present. We can only assume that they were held by an adhesive which has perished and that it must have contained an inner lining, also of a perishable material-perhaps leather-which has left no trace. It is possible that the lining may have been of glass which had broken and was removed before the vessel was hidden in burial. Thick pools of solder inside on the bottom of the two sections suggest that they may have served to sta bilize or hold such a liner. When full, the vessel could have been carried or hung in an upright posi tion by the chain provided for this purpose across the chest, and when empty, it could have been car ried by the chain on the back. All of the modeling and most of the decoration have been achieved by repousse with only limited reinforcement by chasing. Certain details, such as the hair of the mane and tail and the ornament of the saddlecloth and straps, are chased and engraved. Originally, a considerable amount of the decoration was gilded. But here, as tonishingly, and quite unique among known Sasanian silver, the gold has not been applied by the usual mercury process but rather in the form of thin foil which has been hammered over the chased and en graved ornament and held in place by the relatively rough surface of the engraved lines. It is because of this technique, by which the gold has not been se curely held, that most of the gilding has been lost. Only the leather straps of the harness which are closely hatched, the muzzle and the long strands of the mane have held the gilding well. For the rest, there are just scant traces-sometimes only visible under magnification-which show that originally all of the saddlecloth, or at least the rosettes which ornament it, were gilded. There are traces of gilding on the frames of the phalerae on the shoulders, and 291</page><page sequence="5">the costumes of the two men were originally entirely gold, as are the ring and "cup" which one holds. It is probable that the forms of the Museum's two rhyta are ultimately derived from the two most primitive vessels of nomadic peoples-the animal skin and the horn. Like their primitive prototypes, these rhyta served as drinking vessels which were held above the head so that the liquid flowed directly into the mouth of the drinker (cf. Fig. 14). Modern art historians have come to use the term "rhyton" for any vessel which is fashioned wholly or in part in the form of an animal. To the Greeks, however, who adopted this vessel form only after their en counter with the Iranians during the Persian Wars and to whom we owe the term, from Greek rhytos, "to flow"-it evidently applied only to a horn-shaped vessel, commonly ornamented with an animal pro tome, which had an opening at the end so that the liquid could flow from the bottom, as in Figure 13, thus distinguishing it from various other pouring or drinking vessels such as cups, jugs, ewers, etc., from which the liquid was poured from the top.6 If we are to trust the archaeological evidence, it is to the Iranians that this peculiar and typical vessel form of antiquity owes its orgin. It is first known among the theriomorphic clay vessels which recent archaeological discoveries in northwestern Iran have Figure 2. Two early Iranian horn rhyta: A. (Below) From Amlash, ca. 1000 B.C. (New York market) B. Achaemenid period, 5th century B.C. (Louvre AO 3115). _ ~~~~~~ shown to be the most outstanding and characteristic objects from the "early gray-ware" sites which are believed to have belonged to the first Iranian settlers in this area and to date from around the beginning of the first millenium B.C.7 Among the potteries of Amlash, there already occur fully developed ex amples of the rhyta types represented by the Mu seum's two silver vessels. Among the Amlash pottery rhyta, the animal form is by far the most common; of these, the elegant little horse in the Foroughi col lection (Fig. 7a) provides a fitting prototype for our later silver version. The horn rhyton (Fig. 2a) oc curs with much less frequency and is far less elegant in form than it becomes later (cf. Fig. 2b). There is at least one extremely interesting variant of this rhyton type in which the horn is replaced by a vase shaped vessel (Fig. 4a). Perhaps it would be more accurate to say that the animal head spout of a horn rhyton has, in this case, been grafted onto the vase. It is probable, as we shall see, that the Drvaspa rhyton was directly derived from such a vessel. Although it may be a mere coincidence that the Museum's silver rhyta and their ancient prototypes have been recovered in precisely the same area in northwestern Iran, there is ample evidence of the un broken continuity of the use of this typically Iranian vessel right up to the time of the Islamic conquest. l o ? :d:,, _: *. , *:. ----~.: 292</page><page sequence="6">Figure 3.

Among the objects which can be assigned to the Median period (7th-6th centuries B.C.), there are several examples of the animal-shaped rhyton (Fig. 7b).8 Although so far the horn-shaped rhyton has not appeared among the objects known from this period, the very closely related horn-shaped cup with the base in the form of an animal protome commonly also called a rhyton-occurs both in ce ramic and in silver among the objects from Ziweye and other related finds.9 From the Achaemenid period (520-331 B.C.), there are both horn-shaped cups like the Median ones and true rhyta, with animal protomes having the spout in the chest (Fig. 2b). The importance of this latter form in the Achaemenid period is indicated by the fact that it was this vessel rather than its cup-shaped counter part which the Greeks adopted after Plataea.10 Under the Parthians, representing a new wave of Iranian nomads who swept out of the Central Asian plains soon after the passage of Alexander, the horn shaped rhyton seems to have been especially favored, and several examples from this period have been found at Parthian sites stretching across their far flung empire, from their original capital at Nysa, in Central Asia, to Babylon."1 Until the appearance of the group of silver rhyta among the recent Dailaman finds, the only evidence for the continued existence of the rhyton in the Sasanian period-aside from the curious pair of saiga head vessels mentioned above-had come from "outer" Iran. On a silver plate (Fig. 14a) found in the Punjab in 1892 and now in the British Museum, a semi-nude male figure wearing a Dionysiac crown of vine leaves and grapes, is shown drinking from a horn rhyton which terminates in the head of an animal with long horns; under his left arm he holds a wine skin. Although there is no clear evidence for the date of this plate, it has generally been assumed on stylistic grounds to be a local product roughly contemporary with the Sasanian period.12 A very similar scene occurs in the medallions which orna ment a large clay amphora from Khotan, in Central Asia, which apparently dates from about the sixth century (Fig. 14b).13 The most important evidence for the widespread use of this vessel during the Sasanian period is provided by a relief from a tomb of Northern Ch'i date (late sixth century A.D.) from Honan province in Northern China. On a slab from this tomb in the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is a scene (Fig. 14c) in which a group of Central Asians -almost certainly Soghdians-are shown seated under a grape arbor participating in a ritual feast.14 The chieftain, or leader, drinks from a horn rhyton of exactly the same form as the two illustrated on the monuments of Central Asia. That vessels of this form did actually reach China is proven by numer ous copies made by the T'ang potters.15 A detail (Fig. 12) of the ornament on a fluted silver bowl of char acteristic Sasanian type which has recently entered the Museum's collection provides a Sasanian model 294</page><page sequence="8"> for the motif of drinker with rhyton and wine skin in the Central Asian monuments. We now have positive proof that horn rhyta of exactly this type were, in deed, in use in Sasanian Iran. The beautiful silver rhyton in the Farhadi and Anavian collection termi nating in the head of a young doe (Fig. 11 ) provides an actual model for this entire series of representa tions.16 Note that the band of large pearls around the top of this horn has been faithfully copied by the sculptor of the Honan tomb relief. The Museum's newly acquired rhyton which com bines the head of a woman with that of an ox or bull (Cover; Figs. 1, 3) is clearly a variant of the more usual horn rhyton. It stems, perhaps, more directly from another form in which a jug or vase-shaped vessel is furnished with a spout, modeled as an ani mal head, in its base. As has been mentioned above, examples of this jug-rhyton already occur beside the horn and animal rhyta among the ceramics of Am lash (Fig. 4a). Although intermediate examples are so far lacking, there are a number of jug rhyta which attest to its continued use into Parthian and Sasanian times. Like the horn rhyton, there is evidence of the distribution of the jug rhyton all across Asia, from Mesopotamia to Central India. Vessels, or frag ments, of this type in coarse unglazed ceramic were recovered by the University of Pennsylvania exca vations in the Parthian levels at Nippur in Mesopo tamia and at Raiy in Iran (Figs. 4b, 4c).17 Dr. Ro man Ghirshman'8 discovered another (Fig. 4d) in the necropolis of Seqt-Abad in Afghanistan which can be dated, by coins found with it, to the end of the fifth or the beginning of the sixth century. Also from Afghanistan is a beautiful variant in the form of an ostrich egg with a bronze animal-head spout; it was discovered at Begram and may date from as early as the second century.19 In the Deccan in India, a painting of the seventh century at Ajanta shows a woman holding such a jug-shaped rhyton with which she is about to fill the cup held by a man dressed in an Iranian costume with "Sasanian" ribbons flying from his cap.20 In the Museum's Drvaspa rhyton, the jug-shaped body of the vessel has been replaced by the woman's head. Although otherwise unknown in precious metal, this form is not without precedent. A glazed ceramic rhyton in the British Museum (Fig. 5a), of late Parthian or early Sasanian date, which combines the head of a woman with that of a doe, has long been known.21 A fragment, only the woman's head, of a very similar vessel was also found in the Par thian level at Nippur by the University of Pennsyl vania expedition.22 Two other examples of the human-animal head rhyton, in unglazed ceramic, have come from finds in Central Asia. One (Fig. 5b) which can only be dated loosely between the second and seventh centuries A.D.-i.e., contemporary with late Parthian and Sasanian periods-was discovered in the ruins of Afrasiyab, ancient Samarkand.23 The other (Fig. 5c) has only recently been discovered in 295</page><page sequence="9">Afghanistan by the French Delegation. It was un covered in 1963 at Khonja Masdjid near Surkh Khotal in ancient Bactria, a site which the French archaeologists apparently believe to be a Sasanian fortress dating from about the sixth century.24 It is possible that we can trace this unusual form back to Hellenistic influence which came into Iran and Central Asia in the wake of the conquest of Alexander the Great. The concept of a vessel in the form of a human head had an ancient tradition in the Eastern Mediterranean, and is best exemplified by the head-shapel aryballoi of Cyprus and Rhodes. A magnificent series of such vessels in gold, dating from the very beginning of the Hellenistic period, was recently discovered near Panagyurisht6 in an cient Thrace.25 These vessels already anticipate our rhyton in that they have been converted into true rhyta by the addition of a small spout in the form of a lion's head in the base. A typical head-shaped aryballos from the Caucasus was, perhaps, derived more directly from contemporary or near-contem porary Byzantine vessels of this type.26 The presence of similar cups in the form of human heads among the ceramics of Khotan suggests that this vessel shape had been disseminated by the Greeks, not only among their neighbors to the north, but also among those to the east.27 We can suppose that it was car ried by Alexander and his followers into Iran and - I -~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~?. . Central Asia, and that somewhere here, in the hands of an imaginative Iranian artist, the wedding of the two forms-the Iranian horn rhyton and the Greek head vase-took place. Why this combination of forms should have had to wait for an Iranian artist, when the two types of vessels had existed side by side in the classical world at least since the fifth century B.C. and had been closely anticipated in the gold vessels of Panagyu rishte at the end of the fourth century, is perhaps to be explained by the meaning it may be possible to see in this new form, particularly as it is manifested in the Museum's beautiful head rhyton. Among the deities of the early Iranians, there was a goddess of animal fertility. It was she who was re sponsible for the well-being of the flocks and, above all, of the horses-the most valuable of the nomads' possessions. In the sacred Zoroastrian texts, she is an angel who is variously called by the name Drvaspa, "she who keeps horses," or Gosurun (also Gos Gosurvan), "the soul of the Bull." In the Avesta, we read: We sacrifice unto the soul of the bounteous Cow; we sacrifice unto the powerful Drvaspa, made by Mazda and holy.28 We sacrifice unto the powerful Drvaspa, made by Mazda and holy, who keeps the flocks in health, the herds in health, the grown-up (cattle) in health, the young ones in health; who watches Figure 7.

Whether we are entitled to see this meaning in the other head rhyta which have come down to us is probably a moot question. One would not wish to insist that the artist of each of these more simple vessels had such an esoteric meaning in mind when he fashioned his rhyton. It may well be that the pot ters simply adapted an established form which hap pened to suit their purposes and that they did so without understanding or considering a deeper sig nificance. In the case of the British Museum and the Afrasiyab rhyta, however, the fact that the female head is combined with that of another animal does not necessarily detract from this theory. It should not be surprising that the form should have been modified, and other animals which the goddess pro tected-perhaps those for which the worshipper espe cially sought her aid-should have been substituted for the bull. The substitution of a man's head for that of the goddess in the Khonja Masdjid rhyton is equally understandable when we recall that in this part of outer Iran, Drvaspa-there Droaspa-had assumed a male form. It is precisely this deity, Droaspa, of the Kushans, on the eastern borders of Iran, who may provide the clue to the iconography of the horse rhyton. On the reverse of coins of King Kanishka, second century A.D. (Fig. 10a), Droaspa is represented as a bearded man; he stands beside the horse which is his avatar and holds forth a ring-the traditional Iranian sym bol of divine authority-which he presumably offers to Kanishka, who is represented on the face of the coin.31 This is obviously a close parallel to the group represented by the horse and the two busts which constitute our rhyton. It seems more than probable that the iconography of the rhyton is to be inter preted as having a similar meaning and that, perhaps, through a labyrinth of changing mythological con cepts, we have been led back to the same deity, Drvaspa - Droaspa, the protectress- protector of horses! That the same deity should have been repre sented in two such apparently unrelated forms may seem startling at first. However, in this connection it is important to recall that two other Zoroastrian deities, Tishtrya and Verethraghna, are both de scribed in the sacred texts as assuming the forms of a "white, beautiful horse with golden ears and golden caparison" and as "a beautiful bull with yellow ears Figure 9. (Right) Investiture of Bahram I (272-3) at Bishapur. (Photo, Courtesy of the Herzfeld Archives, Freer Gallery of Art, Washington.) Figure 10.

In view of the common association of the horse with many Iranian deities, it is impossible to insist on the symbolism of our rhyton as representing the angel Drvaspa, although the parallel with the Kushan coins strongly suggests that it is. In any case, it seems beyond reasonable doubt that the iconography of the vessel as a whole is concerned with the concept of divine investiture, and that the horse is the symbol of the deity who is represented in anthropomorphic form in the phalerae on the shoulder. That god and king are not shown wearing crowns, as is usual in the investiture scenes of the Sasanian kings on the rock reliefs (cf. Fig. 9), is perhaps to be explained by the fact that here the figures are purely symbolic, where as, the reliefs were thought of as recording actual historic events.33 On the rock reliefs, the rulers are shown receiving the ring of divine authority from different gods-Ahura Mazda, Anahita or Mithra. Thus, it is clear that the bestowal of divine authority was not the prerogative of any one deity, but that each ruler conceived of it as being bestowed on him by the deity of his choice. Thus, Ardashir I and Shapur I, full of orthodox Zoroastrian zeal, had Figure 13. Detail from an Apulian krater showing the Greek rhyton in use. (Kunsthistorisches Museum, Vienna; Photo after Tuchelt.) . . .. 'M:'\z 3... 4C.' 300</page><page sequence="14">themselves represented as receiving the divine in vestiture from Ahura Mazda himself, whereas, Ar dashir II, while still receiving the investiture from Ahura Mazda, includes Mithra as a participant in the ceremony. Khusrau Parviz is shown at Taq-i Bustan receiving the divine rings simultaneously from Ahura Mazda and Anahita, but Narseh, on the other hand, apparently regarded Anahita as the su preme power who authorized and protected his reign. In Bactria, Kanishka, as we can judge from his coins, chose to bolster his divine authority by receiving his investiture from a whole pantheon of deities-among whom was Droaspa/Drvaspa. The logical assumption would seem to be that our rhyton was made to be used in a ritual connected with the rites of investiture, or a ritual feast cele brating such an event. At Taq-i-Bustan, Anahita, who shares with Ahura Mazda the investiture of Khusrau Parviz, holds a ewer from which she pours a libation on the ground. Although we have no di rect evidence of the use of the rhyton in this con nection, it would seem safe to assume that it may well have been. There is ample evidence to indicate that the rhyton was essentially a ritual vessel. In each of the several illustrations of the rhyton in use, which have been discussed above (cf. Fig. 14), the scene is of a ritual character. It may not be apparent, at first glance, that the gleeful little tippler on the Mu seum's silver bowl (Figs. 12 and 15) is performing a ritual act, but there can be little doubt that he is. If we turn to the Bundahis, we read: ... the white Horn, the healing and undefiled, has grown at the source of the water of Aredvivsur (Anahita); everyone who eats it becomes im mortal, and they call it the Gokard tree, as it is said that Hor is expelling death; also, in the renovation of the universe they prepare its im mortality therefrom; and it is the chief of the plants.34 In the last analysis, the grapevine growing out of the mountain on the two ends of the bowl, or out of the chalice on the two sides, is none other than the tree of life-the sacred Hor tree, the tree of immor tality. Our little tippler is not drinking wine but Haoma, the liquor of immortality. In attempting interpretations of this sort, we are extremely handicapped by our almost total lack of information concerning the actual religious rites practiced in Iran in pre-Islamic times. From the evi dence of the monuments, on the one hand, and the literary sources on the other, it would seem that a vast gulf existed between the official Zoroastrian religion of the state and the popular cults of the people in general. Judging by the many silver ves sels, which constitute our main body of Sasanian monuments, the emphasis in myth and ritual was still on the ancient fertility cult centered on the Figure 14.

It was this role which the Zoroastrian goddess of water and vegetation was chosen to fill. That, already in late Achaemenid times, the cult of Anahita had regained considerable importance can be judged by the fact that Artaxerxes Mnemon erected statues to her in his capital cities and spread her worship across his entire empire.35 Her presence in the investiture scenes of several of the Sasanian kings proves that even after the Zoroas trian revival instituted by Ardashir I, she continued to hold an especially important place among the pantheon of Zoroastrian deities. She was closely allied with Mithra, and all of the important fire temples were dedicated to her.36 The frequently re curring theme of this goddess in the decoration of the Sasanian silver vessels strongly suggests that they served in the celebration of the rites of her cult-or in banquets which celebrated fetes in connection with it. The emphasis of the grapevine in association with this goddess, or alone standing for her, undoubtedly reflects the long centuries of Hellenistic influence following Alexander's conquest, which evidently re sulted in the syncretism of the local Anahita cult with that of Dionysos which the Greeks brought with them. It was, perhaps, under the influence of this latter cult that to Anahita were attached many of the attributes and symbols of other deities of the Avestan pantheon which were concerned with fertility and regeneration. It was thus, that, in actual prac tice, the worship of this deity far transcended that which is indicated by her role in the Avesta and the other Zoroastrian texts. Like Dionysos, she became the embodiment of all the concepts of fertility, re generation, rebirth and immortality. Her symbolic plant became the Hom, the tree of immortality, and its juice, the sacred Haoma, which "keeps death far away." On the silver vessels the Hom takes the form of the grapevine which, for the Greeks, had served in precisely the same fashion as the symbol and em bodiment of Dionysos, their god of vegetation and Figure 15.

Severance Fund. 63.4 302</page><page sequence="16">immortality. Thus, on the Museum's fluted bowl (Figs. 12 and 15), the grapevine growing from the mountain on the two ends of the vessel is the sacred Hom. But it serves at the same time as a symbol of Anahita-or it stands for the goddess herself-and, just as the Hom is the goddess, so the juice is her blood. It is in effect the blood of the deity which is the liquor of immortality.37 This fact recalls another passage in the Bundahis: "... It says in the revelations, that, when the primeval ox passed away ... from the blood (arose) the grape vine from which they make wine ... on this account wine abounds with blood..."38 We are, thus, brought back to the primeval ox which we believe to be rep resented on our Drvaspa rhyton. It seems more than probable that through syncretism with Dionysos, Anahita, too, may have taken on the fertility at tributes of the primeval bull. If this is true, then, by analogy with Dionysiac symbolism, the vine grow ing from the chalice on the two sides of the Mu seum's bowl (Fig. 15) is the vine growing from the blood of the ox who is Anahita. She is accompanied by musicians as she frequently is when represented anthropomorphically. Hence, the vine on the sides of the bowl, like those on the two ends, is the Hom, the tree of immortality. The little figure drinking from the rhyton among the branches of the vine is drink ing the juice of this plant, the wine, the Haoma-the blood of the deity.39 He is performing a eucharistic rite. It is precisely this same eucharistic rite-the drinking of the sacred Haoma, the Soma of the Vedas -which is represented by the other drinking scenes with rhyta which have been preserved from Central Asia and China (Fig. 14.). The rhyton, then, in each of these scenes is a sacramental cup. The unusual and elaborate forms of the Museum's two rhyta inveigh against the possibility of their having served as ordinary tableware-even for a king -and support the contention that they were intended for ritual purposes. These, like the silver vessels with figures and symbols of Anahita, must have served as recipients for the sacred Haoma-evidently in the form of wine-which was drunk during certain rites and festivals. The sacrifice of the Haoma was the principal rite of the Mazdean liturgy and, on the evidence of the silver vessels, we may assume that, under the 'influence of the less orthodox cult of Anahita which followed ancient Near Eastern tra ditions reinforced by the cult of Dionysos, the eu charistic aspect of the rite was greatly emphasized. We can recognize in the great Iranian New Year's festival, Nawruz, which takes place at the spring equinox, the ancient Near Eastern festival celebrat ing the return to life of the world of vegetation-the resurrection of the vegetation deity-in which the celebrant by participating of the holy sacrament sought to assure his own immortality. The sacra mental rites concerned with the concept of regener ation and immortality were quite naturally extended to the rites of the dead.40 The eucharist meal is an ancient motif on funerary stelae in the Near East, and the fact that the Sasanian silver vessels from the Dailaman have evidently all come from tombs like their earlier predecessors, the ceramics of the "gray ware period," would suggest that many of these precious objects had served for sacraments attending the last rites of the deceased. It is obvious that our rhyton representing the fer tility concepts of the primeval ox and Drvaspa, as it seems, should have been appropriate to such a rite. The horse rhyton, also Drvaspa, or, perhaps, the "swift horsed" Sun, or the "white horse with golden ears and golden caparison," the avatar of the angel Tishtrya, bringer of rain, would equally have had special symbolic significance as a sacramental vessel in this connection. The added symbolism of the in vestiture in the latter case might indicate that it was designed for special use in a rite of investiture-per haps one that took place during the Nawruz festival, the period when it was, in fact, customary in Sasanian times to install new governors and officials.41 It is possible that in the foregoing discussion the apparent ritual character of the Sasanian silver ves sels has been overstressed. It must be admitted that we have no direct evidence to support these theories and that others have seen in these motifs on the ves sels and in the vessels themselves only secular ban quet scenes and the instruments thereof.42 It is, of course, possible that the meaning of these vessels had been lost-or ceased to have significance to the users and that they only survived as symbols ap propriate to certain feasts, much as the Easter egg and the Christmas tree survive among modern Chris tians. This seems highly improbable. One is reminded 303</page><page sequence="17">of the statement by W. B. Henning,43 that "... everyday occasions were encompassed by religious ceremony in pious Zoroastrian society; any meal began with the vaj (the saying of grace, as it were), sacrificial bread (dron) and wine, or at least beer, formed necessarily part of it." There can be little doubt that these vessels do at least carry on themes and traditions which originally had deep religious meaning and ritual purpose. Having discovered, it seems, the meaning of our two vessels, there still remains the difficult task of determining their date and provenance. Both vessels were acquired on the market and we have only sec ond-hand information from the dealers concerning the locale of their discovery. There is, however, no reason to doubt that they form part of the large series of silver vessels which have been recovered by the local peasantry from tombs in the Dailaman area. The great variety of styles and techniques represented by this material, so far as it has become known, sug gests that these burials had taken place over a long period and that they presumably come from necrop olises of several Sasanian centers. According to the finders, these graves are often found superimposed over the earlier ones of the first Iranian settlers, the people of the "gray-ware culture." It is to this culture that we have traced the origins of the forms (cf. Figs. 2a and 7a) represented by the later Sasanian silver vessels. Because of lack of archaeological explora tion in this area, we have no information about the ruins of cities or fortresses to which such cemeteries may have been attached. However, from historical sources, we know that this was a well-populated and prosperous area in Sasanian times and that it con tinued to be so after the Arab conquest. The power ful rulers of this area, protected in their mountain fastnesses and supplied by the agriculture of the rich tropical littoral, maintained considerable independ ence of the Sasanian emperors, and they were the last to submit to the Arab conquerors. We need not doubt that there were princes and nobles important enough and sufficiently wealthy to have owned the costly silver and glass vessels which have been re covered from their tombs. The fact that these vessels have been recovered from tombs at all-if we dare accept the unverified reports to this effect-presents its own problems. Ac cording to Zoroastrian practice, the dead were never buried but the bodies of the deceased were exposed to dogs and vultures, like those of their modern suc cessors, the Parsies, in India. The bones, after having been thus cleaned, were placed in astodans, or ossu aries, and consigned to crypts cut in the natural rock of the mountains or in chambers especially con structed for them. The silver, then, cannot have come from the graves of orthodox Zoroastrians. Does it mean just that? Were the people of these cemeteries Zoroastrians, who, as indicated by the emphasis of the ancient fertility cult discussed above, were not orthodox and also clung to more ancient burial customs? Or can it be that these objects rep resent heirlooms that had been kept in the families and only much later, in Islamic times, were placed in the tombs? The only information it has been pos sible to get on this point is that coins have, report edly, been found with these objects which date from the Sasanian period. This is a riddle that cannot be solved unless scientific excavations are carried out. Lacking any clue of an archaeological nature that would help to establish the date and provenance, we are forced to rely entirely on stylistic considerations. The problems which the Museum's two rhyta pre sent in this connection are quite different and must be considered separately. It is perhaps best to begin with the horse rhyton, as the problems here are less complex than in the case of the Drvaspa rhyton. On the basis of style, there can be no doubt that the horse belongs to the best of what we may term the "classical" Sasanian style. It is an important and rare example of early Sasanian sculptural art. Un fortunately, aside from silver vessels, a few stone and bronze busts of kings, and the great stone figure of Shapur I at Bishapur, there is almost nothing in the way of sculpture in the round with which it can be compared.44 However, a comparison of the style of the silver horse with the great equestrian reliefs which the early Sasanian kings had carved for themselves, such as that of Bahram I at Bishapur (Fig. 9), leaves no doubt that they are contemporary. The date of the rhyton can hardly be later than the reliefs of Bahram II (276-293) and Hormizd II (A.D. 302-309) at Naqsh-i-Rustam. It is probable, however, that it belongs well within the third century. If one were confronted only with the two male busts in the 304</page><page sequence="18">phalerae, one would unhesitatingly assign them to the Parthian period. The style and the treatment of the faces and hair are characteristically Parthian. One can compare them readily with a marble sculp ture and the engraved mother-of-pearl plaques from Shami,45 and with representations of Parthian kings on their coins. The closest parallel is provided by the coins of Vologases I of the first century A.D.46 One can compare the subject of investiture with ring and hand concealed in the sleeve with that on a group of Parthian bone plaques from Olbia.47 But, in spite of the apparent Parthian style of the busts, there is one small detail, scarcely visible in the illustrations, which denies a Parthian date even to them. This is the presence of circular ornaments, apparently repre senting embroidery, on the shoulders of their tunics. This is a characteristic feature of Sasanian costume but does not ever occur on those of the Parthian period. We must assume that the busts represent a survival of Parthian style, a fact which leads us to place the date of the rhyton in the first decades after the Sasanian overthrow of the Parthian rulers which took place in A.D. 226-i.e., probably about the mid dle of the third century. If we are correct in the belief that the iconog raphy of the horse rhyton represents the deity Drvaspa in a male form, as on the coins of King Kanishka, there remains the problem of explaining this apparent "Eastern" iconography since the very definite Sasanian style does not admit the possibility of considering the rhyton to be the work of a Kushan artist. We have so desperately little to go on that one can only guess that Drvaspa in this form may also have preserved in Iran, as among the Kushans, an other tradition of the nature of this deity-one that is not reflected in the Zoroastrian texts but that had lived on in popular myths. We have no evidence, either archaeological or his torical, that provides clues to the specific area in Iran where such an object could have been made. We can assume that, as in Islamic times, there were a limited number of centers where major works of art of this nature were produced, but in our present state of knowledge, we cannot even hazard a guess as to where these centers may have been. So far, the horse rhyton is unique among known Sasanian silver in the use of hammered gold foil instead of mercury gilding. This fact would seem to indicate that it comes from a center not represented by the other objects, but until, and unless, other comparative material comes to light, one cannot even judge the significance of this fact. The problems surrounding the date and prove nance of the Drvaspa rhyton are infinitely more complex than those concerning the horse rhyton. The only clues to its date are provided by the char acteristic Sasanian "flying ribbons" on the back of the neck and by the inscription. The "flying ribbons" were not known in the Parthian period, but almost from the beginning became a hallmark of Sasanian art. (Compare the ribbons in the rhyton, Figure 22, with those on the relief of Bahram I, Figure 9.) The terminus ante quem is provided by the Pahlavi in scription. According to the scholars who have stud ied it, it is probably seventh century, possibly some what earlier, but certainly not later.48 That the en graver of the inscription was not the artist who made the rhyton is clearly indicated by the crudeness of its form and technique, by its proportions and the ruthless way it cuts across the design. This inscrip tion which records the weight and presumably the value of the silver was obviously executed by an "accountant" or tax collector who was not concerned with the beauty of the object but only with its value as silver. It can have been put on at any time-years, or perhaps centuries, after the piece was made. It only helps the dating by providing a terminus. Thus, on the basis of the intrinsic evidence of the object itself, the dating can be narrowed down to a period contemporary with the Sasanian empire, i.e., third to seventh centuries A.D. It will be necessary to have recourse to other factors in order to limit the date more closely. As stated above, there seems no reason to doubt that this rhyton came from the Dailaman area in northwest Iran. That it cannot have been made there would seem to be guaranteed by the strong Indian feeling in the female face. The obvious answer is that it found its way to Dailaman as tribute or booty, or through trade, from some more easterly region where such Indian influence is more feasible. That this country cannot have been India itself is borne out by the Zoroastrian iconography of the composi tion and by the characteristic Sasanian ribbons on 305</page><page sequence="19">OWN MOW01 is Figure 16. Detail of a stucco sculpture from Hadda, Afghanistan, 4th-5th century. (Photo after Barthoux.) the neck. This is evidenced even more strongly by the fact that, in spite of the apparent Indian quality of the face, when compared to actual Indian models it appears to have very little in common with them. By comparison, the Drvaspa of the rhyton seems not to be Indian at all. Similarly, although there is a cer tain reminiscence of the Buddhist sculpture of Gand hara, especially that from Hadda in Afghanistan, the more one compares and examines them the less con vincing these comparisons become.49 Neither in de tail nor in its over-all character does the head of our rhyton correspond to the Buddhist sculpture of Gandhara. Drvaspa is more refined, more sophisti cated; her cheeks are less round, the lips less volup tuous than the Indian and Gandharan sculptures. The treatment of her hair goes back, it would seem, to Hellenistic prototypes. One can compare it, for example, to that on the gold rhyta of Panagyurishte even to the little engraved locks on the cheeks.50 The lobes of her ears are extended, after the Indian fash ion, but the earrings in the form of large disks worn as ear plugs are not found on either Indian or Gand haran figures. There the lobes of the ears have been stretched much farther and the women, like the Boddhisattvas, wear great dangling ornaments that only loop through gaping holes which have been pulled in the extended lobes. The necks of the Bud dhist figures are laden with rich jewelry in the form of wide collars and elaborate necklaces. The discreet little necklace composed of the three jewels on a rib bon, tied with Sasanian fluttering ends, cannot be found in India and can only be matched once or twice in the Buddhist art of Gandhara and Central Asia. Almost an exact duplicate, although we cannot judge whether there were ribbon ends, is worn by the wife of Buddha in a sculpture, Buddha's Prepara tion for the Great Departure, from Hadda now in the Musee Guimet (Fig. 16).51 Another very similar necklace is worn by a Boddhisattva in one of the paintings of the niche of the great Buddha at Bami yan.52 But these are such isolated instances that they can only be taken as representing Iranian influence in Central Asia rather than vice versa. The extent of Iranian influence in the art of Bamiyan, particularly in matters of costume, textile patterns, and above all the crown and the ever-present flying ribbons, is well documented. A detail of particular interest are the three gilt spots which ornament the face of Drvaspa. These constitute two tiny round beauty marks on the cheeks and a large flame-like device on the forehead. Ex amination has failed to reveal a more specific form of the latter motif. A fingerprint imbedded in the gilding has led Joseph Ternbach, who restored the object and is himself a practiced goldsmith, to be lieve that the artist had intended only a smooth round spot, like those on the cheeks, but that the mercury amalgam ran and the artist in attempting to hold it in place smeared it with his finger. It is im possible, of course, to confirm this theory but the evidence that such spots on the forehead were defi nitely a part of feminine cosmetics in Sasanian times in Iran and Central Asia, as well as in India, would seem to support this explanation of the enigmatic form of the motif on the brow. Whether our artist intended a simple dot or a more elaborate motif-as sometimes actually was the case-there can be no doubt that his intention was the bindi-to give it its modern Indian name. One is normally inclined to connect a spot on the brow with the urna of the Buddha, but the urna and 306</page><page sequence="20">the history of the Bindi in Iran (left to right): A.

The cosmetic spot on women's foreheads, as we shall see, evidently long antedated the Buddha. In India, at Barhut, more than two centuries before the first Buddha image was made, the women are shown with elaborate bindi in the center of their foreheads.53 But this ornament, al though still worn by Indian women today, is not ex clusively an Indian feature as one normally thinks. There is evidence that it is actually an ancient Irani an custom that had a very long tradition in Iran and occurred wherever Iranian peoples or their culture penetrated. It is probable that the Indian custom is also to be traced to this origin. This mark occurs on the forehead of the Anahita figures on several Sasan ian silver vessels, as for example, on the beautiful vase-shaped rhyton in Cleveland (Fig. 17a). That this is not to be explained as Indian influence is proven by the fact that this motif can be traced back to the time of the very beginnings of Iranian art in Iran. On a bronze pin from Luristan, a figure of the mother goddess has such an ornamental device on her brow (Fig. 17b). The appearance of this motif again in the Achaemenid period, on the forehead of a little female bust in a gold earring in Teheran, pro vides evidence of its continuity in Iran and would seem to indicate that its occurrence in Luristan was not just a coincidence.54 This cosmetic device can be traced in the art of Iran to at least the beginning of the fifteenth century A.D. It occurs frequently on figures ornamenting early Persian pottery, as for ex ample, a superb tenth- or eleventh-century bowl from Zendjan in the British Museum (Fig. 17c). Here we have not only the bindi on the forehead but also the two spots on the cheeks. There are many examples of the bindi alone, or together with the spots on the cheeks on ceramics from Raiy and Kashan.55 In paint ings of the Tabriz school dating from the early fif teenth century, this tradition still persists (Fig. 17d).56 The bindi occurs in many examples of Central Asian sculpture; it is particularly common on the many crude little figures of Anahita from Afrasiyab and 307</page><page sequence="21">Figure 18. -, . The Bindi in Central Asia A. "Worshipper" fresco painting from Balawast, ? , (Berlin, : .Indische. Kunstabteilung; Photoe, De Courtesy of the -l Indische Kunstabteilung). is represented on the head rhyton from that site (Fig. 5b).57 It occurs in painting right across Central Asia, as for example, on the beautiful little donor from Khotan in Delhi (Fig. 18a), or on a group of donors from Sorcuq, not far from the Chinese bor der (Fig. 18b). It would seem clear that the presence of the bindi on the forehead of Drvaspa on the Mu seum's rhyton need not be considered as evidence of Indian, or even Central Asian, influence, but rather that it represents another Iranian element. The superbly sculptured bull, or ox, head which forms the spout of the rhyton belongs to the animal art of the Iranians. There is nothing in the art of Gandhara or India to compare with it. If we detect traces of Hellenistic influence, we need not seek its source in the art of Gandhara, but can trace it more directly through the Sasanian art of Iran which owed a heavy debt to Greece. Although much more refined, it is obviously related to the style of the animal head on the Farhadi and Anavian rhyton (Fig. 11). It is clear that neither in its iconography nor its style is the Drvaspa rhyton Indian. It is essentially Iranian with a strong element of Indian influence. It can only have been made on the eastern borders of Iran, where the cultures of Iran and India met and merged but where the Iranian elements remained dominant. Nowhere was this more true than in the region of Soghdia, which lay between the Oxus and Jaxartes. This region first entered history when it was conquered by Darius and incorporated into one of the eastern satrapies of the Achaemenid empire. After Alexander, it passed to the Seleucids and then to their heirs, the Greco-Bactrian rulers. About the middle of the second century B.C., Soghdia was set tled by Iranian tribes, the Yueh-chi, who soon es tablished the great Kushan empire with its capital in Bactria. Soghdia remained under the control of the Kushans until about A.D. 400, when a second wave of Iranian peoples, the Hephtalites, arrived and seized control. Soghdia then became part of the Hephtalite empire, which ruled all of outer Iran and a large part of northern India as well. The power of the Hephtalites came to an end in 566, when they were defeated by the combined forces of the Western Turks and the Persians. Soghdia fell to the lot of the Turks and remained in their hands until the Arab conquest at the beginning of the eighth century. The history of Soghdia itself is not well known, but it seems clear that all during this long period, Soghdia remained a more or less independent feudal state whose kings, in varying degrees, acknowledged vassalage and paid tribute to the more powerful rulers of the neighboring kingdoms of Bactria and Iran. The population seems to have been at all times predominantly Iranian, and the language was an Iranian dialect similar to that spoken in Iran proper. Their religion, derived from that of the ancient Iranians, was evidently closely related to but not identical with that of the Zoroastrians of Iran. Bud dhism, which was firmly entrenched across the border in Bactria by the first century A.D., seems never to have made more than very limited headway in this territory beyond the Oxus. Hsiian-tsang, who visited Samarkand in A.D. 629, reported that the people 308</page><page sequence="22">there worshipped fire and that the two Buddhist monasteries were abandoned. He claimed, however, to have made many converts and to have reopened the monasteries.58 According to the later T'ang-shu,59 the people of Soghdia "honored the Buddha and sacrificed to the sky god." Recent archaeological excavations of ancient Soghdian sites-particularly Pyandzhikent and Var aksha-have provided important documents which illustrate the culture of this region in the last cen turies before the Islamic conquest.60 These monu ments corroborate the meager historical information and confirm the essentially Iranian character of the people and their culture. They reveal also the degree of Buddhist, or Indian, influence and how it had been absorbed into the local culture. At Pyandzhikent the temple architecture with its columns, its great, open iwans, and the chamber for the fire altar is clearly related to that of Iran. But in one of the rooms of Temple II, the walls are decorated with a dado of stucco in high relief recalling the Buddhist architec ture of Gandhara.61 Around three walls, a fantastic riverscape unfolds; the river issues from a rocky gorge, and on its waves are portrayed a series of fan tastic creatures. The subject is obviously related to the Iranian worship of the water goddess, Ardvi Sura Anahita, the heavenly spring, from which flows all the water on earth.62 Here, however, perhaps as Belenitski has suggested, the scene may be an alle gorical representation of the local river, the Zaraf shan. Amid the various creatures in the water are two which are typically Indian, the makara, genie of water and symbol of fertility, and its frequent com panion, borrowed from classical sources, the triton.63 The most important source for the art of Soghdia is provided by the many paintings which decorate the interior walls of almost all the buildings which have been excavated. In one of the temples, the walls are painted with scenes of a ritual banquet.64 Iranian nobles, dressed in rich costumes of Sasanian style and fabrics, are seated around a fire altar which is attended by a priest. With one hand they drink from precious vessels of exactly the same forms which are known among the Sasanian silver vessels from Iran; in the other hand they hold wands which are obvi ously related to the thyrsos of Dionysos. It is not difficult to imagine that the banquet is a eucharistic meal similar to that which was celebrated in Iran on the feast of Nawruz. In another temple, there is a scene representing the death of a great hero who lies upon a bier surrounded by mourners.65 Perhaps, as it has been suggested, the hero symbolizes the "Dy ing Year." He may be Siyavush, Mithra, Dionysos the name does not matter; it is the same deity whose death and rebirth form a central theme of Iranian mythology. In one of the residences, a series of paint ings depicts the story of the great Iranian hero, Rustam, who was later to be immortalized in the Shah-namah by the Persian poet, Firdausi.66 But among these essentially Iranian paintings, there are many elements of Indian origin. In the scene of Chess Players in one of the residences, the prin cipal figures seem to be modeled on Indian ascetic types, but one of them wears a crown with Sasanian wings, and tongues of fire rise from his shoulders.67 In another room, there is a great painting of a four armed goddess. She, too, has flames from her shoul ders and in two of her hands she holds symbols of the sun and the moon.68 She is obviously the same goddess who appears on several silver bowls with Khwarazmian inscriptions and who occurs again, in company with a male counterpart, on paintings from Dandan Oiluq in Khotan.69 This goddess is a local, i.e., Central Asian, astral deity, ultimately of Iranian derivation, but whose iconographic form must have been influenced by that of the Indian god, Siva.70 A motif of tongues of fire from the shoulders also oc curs in Buddhist paintings from Qizil71 and on the beautiful little figure called a "worshipper" from Balawast in Khotan. (Fig. 18a). This motif seems to have occurred first on figures of Buddha from Gandhara and on representations of early Kushan kings on their coins, where it undoubtedly is to be credited to the influence of the Iranian cult of the sun god.72 It seems to have become a particular iconographic feature of Central Asian art, and was adopted as part of the emblemata on the coins of the Sasanian princes who ruled at Balkh as "kings of the Kushans" in the middle of the fourth century.73 It is clear that, in the religion of Soghdia and in its iconographic representation, Indian elements had been grafted onto those of ancient Iranian origin, and that out of this had emerged a new, local religious expression. 309</page><page sequence="23">Figure 19. A. (left) Fresco painting, The Harpist, from Pyandzhikent, 7th century A.D. (Photo after Belenitski). B. Wooden sculpture of Yakshi from Pyandzhikent (Belenitski). In matters of style the same is true. The beautiful figure of the harpist at Pyandzhikent (Fig. 19a) re calls somewhat the figures of Indian paintings. This is particularly evident in the movement of the body, the rich jewels and the floating scarves. But, in the figure of the harpist, there is an elegance of the elongated body, a certain restraint and sophistication not present in the Indian paintings. There is very much the same feeling which we have sensed in the beautiful Drvaspa head of the silver rhyton. The painting of the harpist is not an imitation of distant models; it was painted by an artist to whose culture it fully belonged. Much the same style is represented in a group of carved wooden sculptures of Yakshis (Fig. 19b). Bussagli74 has seen in the art of Pyandz hikent a source of influence for the paintings of Qoco and Qizil, in Turfan in Central Asia, and for the sculptures of Fundukistan, in Afghanistan. There can be little doubt that there was a powerful Soghdian school born of the wedding of Iranian and Indian cultural and artistic elements and that it had a very deep influence on the whole development of the art of Central Asia and was probably primarily respon sible for the diffusion of the Iranian elements which made their appearance in the art of Central Asia and beyond, within the borders of China in the Northern Ch'i caves of Hsiang-t'ang ssu.75 It would seem that only in Soghdia was there to be found the complete absorption of the two cultures that would have been necessary to produce an object such as the silver Drvaspa rhyton. The Soghdian paintings themselves give ample evidence of the ex tent to which such precious vessels of gold and silver were in use, and, although a rhyton does not happen to be depicted among them, there is the terra-cotta rhyton from Afrasiyab (Fig. 5b) as proof that the form was known and used in the region. The Honan relief (Fig. 14c) provides evidence that this vessel form was, indeed, used for ritual purposes by the Soghdians. The wealth and importance of Soghdia was de rived from its strategic location astride the great caravan route which linked China and the West. The Soghdians played a dominant role in the commerce of the silk route, and it seems to have been they who primarily traversed the routes between China and Iran. Judging from the many Sasanian textiles rep resented in the paintings, they must have traded Chi nese silk in Iran for finished fabrics, but we know that they, too, developed an important silkweaving industry.76 If some of the precious metalwork in the paintings may also have been imported from Iran, we need only recall the statement of Hsiian-Ts'ang,77 that the people of Soghdia were "skilled in the arts and trades beyond those of other countries" to find assurance that the majority undoubtedly represent local work. Among the many so-called Sasanian sil ver vessels which have been recovered from the soil of Russia, whither they had wandered in trade, and from Iran itself there are many which are clearly not Sasanian. It is only as a result of the archaeological discoveries in ancient Soghdia, that it begins to be possible to sort out this material and to isolate some of the vessels which it now seems can properly be assigned to Soghdian workshops. There is, for exam ple, the well-known plate in the Hermitage78 with a scene of warriors in combat who, when compared with some of the figures in the Pyandzhikent paint ings,79 are clearly revealed as Soghdians. We need not doubt the existence of a Soghdian school of silversmiths and, judging from the paintings, of goldsmiths, too. 310</page><page sequence="24">For lack of closely comparable material, it is difficult to suggest a precise date when we can as sume the rhyton to have been made. A review of the little evidence we have, however, seems to point to a date within the latter part of the broad limits indi cated by the Sasanian ribbons and the inscription. This would be contemporary with the later part of the Sasanian empire in Iran and would roughly co incide with that of the Hephtalite, and later Turkish, domination of Soghdia in the fifth through seventh centuries. But we need not rely on political history to find a clue for the dating. As has been pointed out above, the historical and cultural development of Soghdia seems not to have been greatly affected by the changing political fortunes of the various outside rulers to whom its feudal princes evidently willingly paid tribute in order to retain their independence. The cultural development of Soghdia was tied much more directly with its important commercial role which seems to have carried on without serious in terruption regardless of the major political events in Iran and Central Asia. It is true that for a time in the early sixth century all of outer Iran, from Soghdia to Northern India, were brought together within the empire of the Hephtalites. However, it is clear from the completeness of its absorption into the culture of the Soghdians, as documented at Pyandzhikent, that the Indian influence which made its way across the Oxus cannot date from this period. It had been car ried there long before, largely through peaceful Buddhist missionaries and, in no small degree, by means of trade and commerce. The paintings of Pyandzhikent belong to the sev enth century; those of Balalyk Tepe and Varaksha have been assigned to the fifth and sixth centuries. Although we have very little evidence concerning the earlier developments in this area, it does seem that these centuries represent the apogee of the cultural and artistic development of Soghdia. It is within this period, then, that it would seem the rhyton must be assigned. If we compare the head of Drvaspa with the beautiful little head of the worshipper at Bala wast (Fig. 18a) on the one hand, and with the figure of the harpist at Pyandzhikent (Fig. 19a) on the other, we are inclined to place it squarely between the two-i.e., in the sixth century. The evidence pro vided by the necklaces suggest that it must be very closely contemporary to the Hadda sculpture (Fig. 16). It is important to note, too, that of all the sculp tures of Gandhara, perhaps the closest analogy in style is represented by the head of the wife of Buddha in this very sculpture. Unfortunately the Hadda sculptures are not precisely dated. They are gener ally accepted as belonging to the fourth or fifth cen tury, a date which is supported in this case by the obvious Sasanian influence. Hadda was evidently at the height of its prosperity at the beginning of the fifth century but was destroyed by Mihirakula, the Hephtalite ruler of Zabulistan, about 530. It lay in ruins when Hsiian-Ts'ang passed there in 644. A fifth or early sixth-century date for this sculpture is quite probable. The similar necklace in the painting at Bamiyan dates from the sixth, perhaps the seventh century. As mentioned above, there is obviously a certain stylistic analogy between the bull's head of the Drvaspa rhyton and that of the animal of the Farhadi and Anavian rhyton. The date indicated for this ob ject, on the basis of the style of the frieze of animals, would seem to be fifth or sixth century; its relation ship to the rhyton on the Honan frieze may provide a further claim for the sixth century. Thus, it would seem that on the basis of the mea ger evidence which can be brought to bear in our present state of knowledge, the Drvaspa rhyton should date from the fifth or sixth century and that it was made in Soghdia. It is impossible, of course, to consider this attribution definitive and it well may be that, as a result of the discovery of new material and further archaeological work by Soviet scholars in the region, this attribution will have to be modi fied.80 We are reasonably confident, however, that this modification should not be more than a hundred years, one way or the other, and not many hundred miles. Regardless of precise date and provenance, the Drvaspa rhyton is unquestionably the finest work of art of "Greater Iran," from the standpoint of sculptural quality, craftsmanship and sheer aesthetic appeal, which has come down to us from the long period between the conquests of Alexander the Great and the Arabs. It reveals a level of artistic achieve ment in medieval Iran which has not hitherto been suspected. DOROTHY G.

Its condition when entrusted to me was most dis couraging and worrisome. It consisted of four main fragments, (Figs. 20a through 20d): a most beauti fully modeled head with elongated neck, approxi mately ten inches long, of thin silver; a bull's head badly broken; the two horns and the two ears of the bull. In addition, there were numerous large and small fragments of silver. The total weight was 705 grams or 22 silver ounces, 15 pennyweight. When organically laid out (Fig. 20a), the beauty of these fragments was an enchanting vision. The head down to the neck had been hammered from one sheet of silver which is generally between five and seven tenths of a millimeter in thickness, but in many places is even thinner. The head was spat tered with corrosion on an oxidized brilliant surface. The frontal view of the classical features, oval in shape, sensitive, with lovely expression and detail, along with attached large disk earrings, seemed whole and intact. Two striking breakages with large open gaps and missing sections existed: one on the right cranial view extending from behind the ear to the top of the head, and a second on the left in the tem poral area. There was, in addition, a serious crack on the right side starting from under the chin towards the mouth, marking a line towards the eye. The damage on the right side, with a small interruption near the ear, included the horizontal break to the back of the neck extending down as far as the end of the hairline, and on the left side to the end of the neck. The hole on the left side also included a crack running towards and behind the ear. Thus the back of the neck was virtually a loose fragment, held only at the bottom, with loose additional fragments (Fig. 20c). As seen in Figure 20b, the right cheek with ear was caved in, deep below the joining lines of the head. The greatest problem was whether, in view of the several precarious circumstances of the material -its corrosion, its thinness, its inflexibility and the Figure 21. In progress of restoration: right side of face has been raised (cf. Fig. 20b) and hole partially filled, in jigsaw fashion, from small fragments. Figure 22.

T~he horse rhyton before restoration. crack in the chin-it would be possible without split ting the face further to align the indented portion of the face with the ear and with the back of the skull. The risk was clear and very great. The face might split into two or more parts. Such an eventual split would mean that the as-yet-complete face would carry additional (that is, current and so-to-say "man-made") damages, with the evidence of the subsequent mend ing process. For the first time in my professional ex perience, I had to enlist the responsibility of the museum authorities to determine whether such jeop ardy should be risked. The Museum felt, as I did, that the attempt at restoration should proceed. After thorough study in approaching the prob lems, I made various devices and wedges of different sizes and weights which I hoped would enable me to stabilize the head, neutralize the front crack and slowly permit me to raise the caved-in cheek, wedg ing the rims until I could bring both edges together -but after many trials, all had to be discarded. The slightest pressure by these "tools" produced warning cracking sounds in the metal and threatened actual cracking and fresh damages to other parts. I finally had to rely completely on the sensitivity of my fingers to press out the indented part with slow mo tion-gradually, proceeding imperceptibly to lift the cheek area to the height of the original contour. When the two levels were aligned, I soldered the two parts on the inside with soft solder. The "scar" about an inch away from the earring, and running down the neck, is seen in Figure 1. With the main problem happily solved, I aligned the breakages of the neck and soldered them as well. Then I proceeded to re place the fragments so that the holes in the head were closed (Fig. 21). The assemblage of the dis membered bull's head (Fig. 20d) with horns and ears separated (and an eye from among the frag ments), was an exacting job of fitting the parts until they fell into place. Then I attached the repaired bull's head to the goddess' head. I removed the corrosion by lifting it very care fully, small pieces at a time, in order not to damage the original polished surface and not to tear the brittle skin or separate the material which was de composed on the inside. I left untouched a section of corroded surface on the back of the hair and the 314</page><page sequence="28">right earring for documentary purposes (Fig. 22). On the forehead and cheeks, the signs in gilding emerged. Earrings, necklace, bull's horns, mane, and mouth were also mercury gilded. The head and neck were hammered from one piece; the earrings were separately hammered onto the earlobes; settings in the form of a rosette on the earrings were soldered on for glass inserts and, per haps, set in bitumen. The head was beautifully fin ished in repousse, partially gilded and highly bur nished. The bull's head was hammered out, the horns hammered and the edges folded over in the back, set into the head, and soldered. The ears, too, were made separately, set into the head with dowels and soldered. The eyes of the bull had sockets, most probably originally filled with shells, bone or semi precious stones, or glass paste. The spout in the mouth was soldered in, and on the top of the head there is an opening with a rim soldered in where the liquid was poured in. A ring with one movable silver link soldered on the inner surface near the opening is preserved. This chain may be a clue to how a cover was attached. These details of the construction of this haunt ingly beautiful sculpture provoke awesome respect for the conception and skills of the creator. The re covery of this very important object of antiquity fulfills the vision it promised in its damaged state. The restoration of the horse rhyton, which had been entrusted to me several years earlier by its owner, before it was acquired by the Museum, was a similar if not quite so delicate problem (cf. Fig. 23). The restoration of this object was carried out in essentially the same manner as outlined above.

XLIII; Ghirshman, "Le Rhyton en Iran," fig. 28. 4 The inscription has been examined by both Prof. R. N. Frye'(Harvard University) and Prof. W. B. Henning (University of California, Berkeley). A conclusive reading of the first line has eluded both, but lines 2 and 3 clearly read: "50 ZWZN 3" which is to be inter preted as "50 tetradrachmae and 3 drachmae," i.e., 203 drachmae. Because of losses and repairs, the present weight of the object, 702 grams, does not exactly equal the original silver weight. However, according to Prof. Henning, it corresponds roughly to the Sasanian standard, current until about A.D. 700, and thus corre sponds with the dating indicated by the inscription on paleographic grounds. Sincere appreciation is herewith expressed to both Professors Frye and Henning for their valuable assistance in this connection. 5 Ghirshman, Parthians and Sasanians, p.220. 6 Cf. "Rhyton" in George Wissowa Paulys Real-encyclo pddie der classischen Altertumswissenschaft, Suppl. 6 (1935), pp. 643-645. The Greeks, however, evidently did not understand or appreciate the Iranian custom of letting the stream flow directly into the mouth and used the rhyton for filling another vessel, usually the phiale, as illustrated in the figure. 7 These vessel forms have been discussed by L. Van den Berghe, "Quelques vases theriomorphes iraniens," Ar tibus Asiae, xv (1952), 233-240, and Ghirshman, "Le rhyton en Iran." 8 The Maku rhyton was an accidental find, but another similar one was excavated in an early seventh-century B.C.
