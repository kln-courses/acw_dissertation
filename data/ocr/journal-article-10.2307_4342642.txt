XLIII, No. 5 DECEMBER 19, 1949 WHOLE No. 1107 THE POSITIVE BELIEFS OF THE SKEPTIC CARNEADES* What is the effect of skepticism? Is it a stimulus to constructive thought, or, as some think, a corrosive in- fluence producing an obscurantism or quietism which cannot from any practical point of view be considered progressive? The purpose of this paper is to consider the positive beliefs of Carneades, and try to see what kind of man and thinker his skepticism produced. There will be little or nothing new in what I say, but simply an attempt to emphasize the positive element in his thought. Carneades was a member of the New Academy, which in the Hellenistic period diverged in a skeptical direc- tion from the Platonic tradition. He was active in the middle years of the second century B.c., and is consid- ered by some to have been the greatest philosopher be- tween Aristotle and Plotinus. Skepticism means, fundamentally, doubt of the possi- bility of attaining certain knowledge. Carneades, fol- lowing earlier skeptics in this universal -doubt, takes as his point of departure the Stoic theory that truth means the correspondence between a presentation to the min(d and what exists in the external world. Certainty will be attained, then, through the possession of a criterion in the form of a presentation to the mind of such a character as to guarantee both itself and other presenta- tions. There is no such criterion, Carneades maintained, for the senses are notoriously unreliable, while reason, which might be thought more reliable, operates only upon material furnished by the senses. The sole con- clusion possible is suspension of judgment, and the refusal to give complete assent to any proposition what- ever. But, again like his predecessors, Carneades realized that in a practical emergency, or in any situation re- quiring action, extreme skepticism does not provide any guidance. Hence he developed his celebrated doctrine of probability. Sense-data, he thought, can be classified in two ways: first, into those which give true knowledge (quae percipi possunt) and those which do not; second, into those which are probable or persuasive (probabilia, mOavac) and those which are not.' While there is none to which we ought to give unqualified assent as be- longing in the first category, there are many which we will recognize as probable, and we are justified in fol- lowing them in decisions of everyday life. There is present here the implication that, for the most part at least, the presentations which seem to us probable will correspond to those which are really true, and that the non-dogmatist who follows carefully tested probability will act not far differently from the dogmatist-if any could exist-who had infallible knowledge of the truth in all things. The fundamental difference between him and the actual dogmatist, who is deluded by a false as- surance of certainty, is twofold: first, freedom from in- tolerance; second, freedom from the errors to which uncritical acceptance of dogma would lead him. Carneades' doctrine of probability was considerably more comprehensive and complicated than that of his predecessor in the New Academy, Arcesilaus. It seems that in Arcesilaus' view the impact of a probable per- ception itself, with the physiological reaction of the in- dividual, is sufficient to produce action leading to hap- * Read at the annual meeting of the Classical Association of New England, Amherst College, April 2, 19489. 1 Cic. Acad. ii. 31. 99. 67</page><page sequence="2">68 THE CLASSICAL WEEKLY piness, without any movement of the will; but Carneades was not content to react to the world just as it hap- pened to present itself to him; he demanded the right to a principle of selection. Therefore Carneades dis- tinguished three grades of probability, according to whether (1) the presentation involved is merely per- suasive, or (2) also uncontradicted by the attendant circumstances, or (3) both of these, persuasive and un- contradicted, and in addition "tested." It is apparent that in the latter two grades the mind of the subject is not only passively accepting impressions, but actively working on them; and here is underlined the intel- lectualist and voluntarist aspect of his theory of knowl- edge, which Carneades shares with the Stoics. In the second grade of probability the mind is comparing and observing phenomena, and in the last it is actively ex- amining hypotheses. Here Carneades will seem to many to come very close to the ideal of many modern scien- tists and philosophers, who avoid dogmatic statements and subject that which they regard as probable to rigorous tests. Nor is the probabilism of Carneades merely a practical expedient, as was the case with that of Arcesilaus; it has also a theoretical significance. He used it, as Cicero says, et in agenda vita et in quaerendo ac disserendo :2 it can form a basis for the investigation of questions in physics, morals, or theology. Since this is so, it ought to be possible to discuss Carneades' views on such subjects as those just named- in the sense, that is, of the views which seemed to him most highlv probable. The greatest difficulty lies in the fact that for the most part those who report on Carneades' doctrines are more interested in the negative than in the positive side of his philosophy, and his own views can only be seen in the way in which he argues against those of someone else. Hence any conclusions we reach must themselves be regarded as merely probable and falling far short of absolute certainty. The arguments of Carneades on theological questions can be constructed with some comr)leteness, especially from several works of Cicero, but it would be impos- sible to attempt even a summary treatment of all his theological arguments here. Carneades takes up one by one the principal points of Epicurean and Stoic theories, those about the existence of the gods, their nature, their government of the world, and their care for man, and demolishes them with a flood of arguments of everv kind. The Epicurean gods are ridiculed for their anthropomorphism and their atomic structure, and the Stoics are pilloried for their attempt to reconcile a pantheistic Zeus with the practices and beliefs of tradi- tional Greek religion. We are assured by Cicero that "Carneades advanced these arguments not in order to destroy belief in the gods (for what could be less fitting for a philosopher?) but that he might show that the Stoic account of the gods was not adequate."3 Many of his arguments carry only the implication that if the gods exist, still nothing definite can be known about their nature. And in other places he seems to be saying that if we are to have religion, it should be a worthy one. "Let there be driven from philosophy all error of such a kind that when we speak of the immortal gods we say things unworthy of them."4 Nevertheless, if we consider the whole range of Car- neades' theological argumentation, it is hard to escape the feeling that most is based on an unspoken belief that gods do not exist. One might imagine him, even as an extreme skeptic, saying, "If the gods were as the Stoics and Epicureans say, these consequences would follow, and therefore the gods would not exist; but gods could be imagined with the following different characteris- tics," and going on to develop a positive, though tenta- tive, theology. But there seems to be no indication of such an attitude on Carneades' part. And since, in dealing with the question of the gods' relation to men, he rejects both the Epicurean idea of gods who have no concern for men, and the Stoic doctrine of an all- pervading providence, it is difficult to see what func- tion gods could have in his view. Again, in the case of other individuals and groups who argue against re- ligious notions, we are often reassured of their essen- tial piety. Pyrrho was made a high priest by his fellow- citizens,5 and Epicurus, despite his materialism, was known to be sincerely pious. Cicero himself and Cotta, his Academic spokesman in the De natura deorum, are careful to specify many times that they are not irre- ligious.6 Sextus Empiricus,7 speaking for the orthodox Pyrrhonian skeptics, says, "following the ordinary view, we affirm, undogmatically, that gods exist, and we reverence gods and ascribe to them foreknowledge." So far as I know, there is no statement of this kind applied to Carneades. If, then, he thought the existence of gods improbable, what did Carneades put in their place? I think he ad- hered, in his own mind, to a thorough-going materialism, believing that whatever the specific details might be, natutre can be explained on her own terms without the importation of divine agencies. He very definitely re- jects the notion of providence. A fragment from Cicero shows this clearly. Since it would be unjustifiable to suppose that a creator god had created the material 2 Ibid., ii. 10. 32; cf. ii. 32. 104. Cf. also Sext. Emp. Math. vii. 175, and other references collected bv A.

In the course of his long argument against the Stoic prow dence, he says that our knowledge of the arts and our command of the faculties of reason are the re- sult of natural forces, not the gifts of any god. "These faculties . . . are the gifts of nature . . . by its own motions and mutations imparting motion and activity to all things. . . . The system's coherence and per- sistence are due to nature's forces and not to divine power."9 These statements bear an obvious likeness to Epicureanism, and it is perhaps significant that, though he mercilessly cut to pieces the Epicurean theology, Carneades apparently directed less argumentation against their materialistic, naturalistic analysis of the world. Perhaps he considered it less pernicious than the Stoic materialistic pantheism. Carneades also dealt at length with the claims of divination. In the light of the preceding discussion, it would be surprising indeed to find that he thought it possible to foretell the future by the flight of birds, or by the observation of the position of the stars. I think we can say with complete confidence that he re- jected such notions, and it is significant that here too his refutation reveals the disposition to approach problems in a completely naturalistic fashion. Future events, he said, are either already foreshadowed in the present state of things, in which case they are subject to in- vestigation by the sciences, or they are completely for- tuitous, in which case neither divination nor anything else can foresee them.10 And in matters which seem to fall out sometimes according to nature, and sometimes according to chance, it is a great stupidity simply to make the gods responsible, rather than to investigate the causes." Belief in divination involves a belief in fatalism, and this doctrine too was the target of Carneades' criticism. His central purpose here seems to have been to vindicate human freedom of will and make possible meaningful moral judgments. If fatalism were the true belief, he said, the individual could not be counted responsible for his actions; virtue and vice, praise and blame would have no meaning, and effort would be useless.12 Here too he was closer to the Epicureans than to the Stoics. He sympathized with Epicurus' desire to defend freedom of will, but disapproved of the uncaused swerve of the atom by which he accounted for it. Therefore he pointed out that Epicurus could have maintained his conclusion by distinguishing between an event forniing a link in an external chain of causation, and one pro- ceeding from the will of the individual. The individual's voluntary act is not "uncaused," because he is himself a part of nature; yet it is free.13 It becomes apparent that Carneades' arguments for free will are based on his assumption that his opponent, or the person whom he is trying to convince, will not want to abandon the possibility of a meaningful prac- tical morality. Let us now consider some of his own pronouncements on ethical problems. First of all, he discussed at length the central problem of ancient ethics, that of the highest good (summum bonum). We should be rash indeed to pretend to know what solution be preferred, since we are explicitly told that his pupil Clitomachus was not sure of Carneades' real opinion; but we may perhaps be able to tell something of the direction of his thoughts. Cicero describes a careful and exhaustive analysis of all possible solutions to the problem.14 It is based on the three fundamental urges, (1) to achieve pleasure, (2) to avoid pain, and (3) to attain the primary natural goods. There are three ends consisting of activity directed toward these, three con- sisting of their attainment, and three more consisting of their attainment attended with a moral life. These nine ends may be arranged schematically in three groups of three, as follows: 1. Activity directed toward attainment of pleasure (advocated by no one). 2. Activity directed toward avoidance of pain (ad- vocated by no one). 3. Activity directed toward attainment of natural goods (Stoics). 4. Attainment of pleasure (Epicurus). 5. Avoidance of pain (Hieronymus).15 6. Attainment of natural goods (championed by Car- neades in opposition to Stoics). 7. Attainment of pleasure, attended with moral life (Callipho). 8. Avoidance of pain, attended with moral life (Diodorus). 9. Attainment of natural goods, attended with moral life (Old Academy, Peripatetics). To act so as to attain pleasure or to avoid pain with- out achieving one's end is proposed as the highest good by no one. To the Stoics the summum bonum is action leading toward the primary natural goods, whether they are attained or not. Against this, Carneades argued for 8 Cic. ND fr. 2 (apud Lact.

However, we are also informed that Carneades defended, so zealously that he seemed to approve it, the opinion of Callipho, which is seventh on our list: the attainment of pleasure along with a moral life (voluptas cum honestate, iyaovj- along with apeT'I).'7 Callipho's ideal is of course very close to that of Epicurus-the attainment of pleasure-except that Callipho's makes explicit the acceptance of social morality, which was present in Epicurus', but only sec- ondary to the pleasure of the individual. It is significant too that this is a double end, which separates happiness from virtue.18 Happiness is important to man, but he does not receive it automatically as a result of following an ostensibly different goal. Thus generally, in Cer- neades' discussion of the summunt bonum., we see him rejecting most definitely those ends which mean activity of some sort without assurance of attainment, and which therefore make a merit of an attitude. He is most attracted by the views which mean satisfaction of natural aspirations along with a recognition of ob- ligation to one's fellows. Another important source of information on Car- neades' moral theory is in the account of his two famous speeches on Justice in 156/55 B.C., when he came to Rome on an embassy in behalf of Athens, along with Critolaus the Peripatetic and Diogenes the Stoic. On this occasion Carneades delivered two lectures. In the first of these he marshalled all the well-known argu- ments in favor of the conventional concept of Justice, while in the second he attacked it just as effectively. These lectures attracted such wide attention in Rome that Cato and other old-fashioned moralists were seri- ously alarmed and hastened the departure of the Athenian philosophers from the city. What was Carneades' purpose in delivering these speeches? In view of the moral earnestness which we have already seen in his work, and in spite of his occa- sional use of sophistical arguments, I think we can dis- miss the notion, sometimes held, that he wished merely to make a sensation by displaying his virtuosity, or that he intended to undermine the morality of the Roman youth. He was using a time-honored Academic method, developed by Arcesilaus after Socrates and Plato, that of setting one side against another to show their equiva- lence (toooOi'evta), and of allowing the hearer to decide the question on its merits, or to suspend judgment. But I think we can see a good deal of what Carneades himself regarded as most probable, and the direction in which he hoped that his hearers would be influenced. He expresses ironic admiration for the concept of ab- stract justice, a universal law or principle which would apply equally to all men: For Justice-assuming that it exists-is the only vir- tue which is preeminently unselfish and generous, and which prefers the interests of all others to her own and is born to serve others rather than herself.19 But alas! this Justice does not exist. The weakness of their case defeated the zeal and genius of Plato and Aristotle in their efforts to set Justice on a pedestal beside Wisdom. There is no single principle or code definable: For the Justice which forms the object of our in- vestigation pertains to society, but not at all to nature. If it were a part of nature, then justice and injustice, like heat and cold or bitterness and sweetness, would be the same for all men.20 Carneades next proved at some length the diversity of custom and law in different parts of the world, and in the same part at different times. This diversity he held to show that there is no natural law or justice, but that men and other living beings are led by nature toward their own utilitarian good. Thus codes of law and justice are based on the advantage of a group or nation or individual, and are in origin the product of weakness. "Each people has enacted for itself such provisions as it thought to be useful in its conditions of life."21 In particular, he pointed out that Rome herself had gained possession of the whole world through declarations of war made in the approved sacramental fashion and through "legally doing injustice" (legitime iniurias faciendo).22 By this use of the word iniuria, Carneades designates that which common feeling shows to be wrong, as distinguished from that which is illegal or contrary to the accepted code. The "common feel- ing" is that of the sensitive man of goodwill, for people generally follow conventional beliefs, and-more im- portant-even philosophers encourage them in this: This is a mistake not only of the common people and the ignorant, but of philosophers as well, for the latter also supply lessons in injustice, that folly and wrong- doing may not lack the authority that comes from educa- tion.23 Carneades thus seems to take what some would call a realistic approach to the problems of ethics. Like Epicurus, he believes in the fundamental egoism of man-a view which to some seems pessimistic. He be- lieves that living "according to nature"-the Stoic for- 16 Cic.

Law, morality, and justice, he be- lieves, are social in origin, products of the need for an accommodation among men which will best serve the individual requirements of each. In summary, we have seen in Carneades the "proba- bilist," a thinker devoted to the solution of problems by reason rather than by dogma, where possible usin1g the methods of testing and verification; a thinker who is always inclined to attack practical and theoretical questions in a naturalistic spirit. Perhaps the most important thing in life is the action that we take, our response to the problems which face us as individuals and as groups. If this is so, it might be said that the really serious problem begins where the epistemological problem ends, that all the philosophy of Carneades is merely preliminary to the development of a serious program of action. Yet is it not apparent, if we compare the positive views of Carneades with those of his dogmatic opponents, that his skeptical foundation has affected deeply the probable conclusions at which he arrived? He shows by his example that it is possible to think intelligently about important humatn problems without absolute certainty as a founda- tion, and to formulate a workable program of action. Unfortunately we know little of his attitudes on the political and social problems of his day. What we do know seems to show that, in comparison with his op- ponents, in some respects he achieved, through his re- fusal to dogmatize, what would generally be regarded as more advanced views. The great danger of skepticism is paralysis, but per- haps even this would be preferable in some ways to an uncritical dogmatism. Let us suppose that everyone who acts or who formulates a program of action must base his acts or program on unproved assumptions. The unproved assumptions of the dogmatist are his sole sup- port in the world, a creed to which he must cling the more tenaciously because, if it falls, he is utterly un- done. The unproved assumptions of the skeptic are from the beginning merely tentative, and he is all the more willing to re-examine and correct them if new evidence presents itself. Thus while the skeptic's creed may not engender the same enthusiasm, it will also be free of the fanaticism of the dogmatist. EDWIN L. MINAR, JR. CONNECTICUT COLLEGE</page></plain_text>
