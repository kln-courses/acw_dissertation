<plain_text><page sequence="1">NOTE, NOEIN, AND THEIR DERIVATIVES IN PRE-SOCRATIC PHILOSOPHY (EXCLUDING ANAXAGORAS) PART II. THE POST-PARMENIDEAN PERIOD KURT VON FRITZ MELISSUS AND ZENON IN THE fragments of the works of Par- menides' immediate disciples, Zenon and Melissus, neither the word voos nor any of its derivatives occurs. Never- theless, they must be discussed briefly be- cause their philosophy was not without influence on the further development of the concept. Setting aside a few devia- tions from the doctrine of Parmenides which have no bearing on our problem, as, for instance, Melissus' contention that the 6ov was 'a'repov rather than rerepaoare.vov, both Zenon and Melissus tried to support the fundamental tenets of their master by new arguments and to defend it against the contrary evidence provided by our senses. This latter part of their philosophi- cal labors implies at least a shift of empha- sis, as compared with Parmenides' own view of the problem, and gave the specu- lation about the ways in which we can find access to ultimate reality a new direction. Theophrastus was probably wrong when he said that Parmenides considered 4poVEZv or Voe6v and alcOaveorOac one and the same thing. But it is significant that, in the decisive sections of his discussion of a64a, Parmenides does not refer to the senses as the cause of erroneous beliefs but speaks of the vo'os rXayKTO'S of mortals. In the Introduction, it is true, the senses are mentioned,98 when the goddess asks Parmenides not to ply-or to give free play to-"his unseeing eye and his buzz- ing ear." But the senses are described merely as unable to grasp the true reality. 98Parm. Bi. 35 (Diels). It is not altogether impossible that in the lost parts of the second half of the poem the senses were referred to again as having somehow contributed to the errors of mortals. But there can be no doubt that the decisive error is committed by the voos, if it errs, even though, and in some respects even because, it is the voos which has access to ultimate reality and is, in a way, in touch with it even when it errs.99 The senses, in other words, even though they are not identified with the voos, are certainly not contrasted with the voos either, so as to be considered as the cause of error committed by the voos, but come in only in a secondary function. The difference between Parmenides and his direct disciples in this respect can be most easily shown by an analysis of Frag. B8 (Diels) of Melissus. In this fragment Melissus tries to prove that if those things which people consider as real, namely, water, fire, air, gold, iron, etc., are truly existent; if, furthermore, they are black and white,'00 dead and alive, etc., as people believe to be true; and if (in this respect) we see and hear correctly, then each one of them must have the proper- ties which "it" (that which is) seemed to have (according to the preceding demon- stration), which means that they cannot change in any respect or be converted into something else but must remain for- ever what they are. But, he continues, in 99 See Part I, CP, XL (1945), 241. i00 It is also characteristic for the shift of emphasis in regard to sensual perception that Melissus speaks of white and black, while Parmenides speaks of light and darkness, of sound and stillness, etc. (see Part I, CP, XL, 240).

It follows, therefore, that we did not see correctly and that the ap- pearance of a multiplicity of things was deceptive. Melissus' argument is somewhat vague and certainly much less precise and cogent than that of Parmenides. But a few defi- nite conclusions can be drawn. It is the senses which he accuses of the error which Parmenides attributes essentially to the v6os 7rXa'yKro's. The words voos and vo62v do not occur in any of the literal frag- ments of the work of Melissus. We can, therefore, not be absolutely sure that he used them at all or, if he did, in what sense. But it is clear that he tried to dis- prove the testimony of the senses by logi- cal reasoning. It seems, furthermore, that he started from the testimony of the senses in order to show that this testi- mony, if followed out into its logical con- sequences, is self-contradictory.102 Even though Zenon in the literal frag- ments neither refers expressly to the senses nor mentions the voos, it is obvious that his purpose and methods in this re- 101 This seems to be the meaning of Melissus' words when he says- "We say that we see and hear and un- derstand correctly. But it seems to us that the warm gets cold and the cold warm, etc." 102 The gist of Melissus' argument, which is not very clearly expressed in the fragment, seems to be this: (1) The senses tell us that various things, like water, fire, gold, etc., exist and that they are warm or cold, living or dead, hard or soft, etc. (2) If this were true, it would follow that water cannot turn into earth and that what is hard cannot become soft, since this would mean that in each case of this kind one thing turns into another or disappears (in the first case the water, in the second case the hard) and something else comes out of nothing (in the flrst case earth, in the sec- ond case the soft). But this is impossible, as demon- strated before, since whatever exists cannot have come out of nothing, or have turned into nothing. (3) Never- theless, the senses tell us that water does turn into earth (stone) and that the hard becomes soft. (4) Hence the testimony of the senses is self-contradictory. spect are essentially the same; for the testimony of the sense of vision shows that Achilles, for instance, in order to reach the turtle must first reach the point from which the latter started and that the turtle moves constantly. It follows, then, that, while Achilles reaches the point which the turtle had reached when he reached its starting-point, the turtle must have traveled some further distance, and so on ad infinitum. Hence it follows that Achilles can never reach the turtle. Yet the testimony of the senses says also that Achilles not only reaches the turtle but passes it by. Even though the senses are not mentioned in the fragments, it seems obvious that with this argument Zenon, just like Melissus, tries to prove that the testimony of the senses is self- contradictory. With these arguments and this method of proof, Zenon and Melissus took a fur- ther important step toward the distinc- tion between sensual perception and logi- cal reasoning, which was to have a great influence on the development of the con- cepts of voos and VOEZV. EMPEDOCLES Among the non-Eleatic pre-Socratic philosophers of the two generations fol- lowing Parmenides, Empedocles occupies a special position in two respects which are most essential for the further history of the concepts of voos and VOEZV, namely, in regard to the general character of his philosophical terminology and in regard to the "theory of knowledge," which is gradually evolving in this period. In most other respects he has much in common with some of the most outstanding philos- ophers of his time, notably with Anaxag- oras, Leucippus, and Democritus. All these philosophers are profoundly influ- enced by Parmenides' reasoning. Yet all reject, in one way or another, his funda-</page><page sequence="3">14 KURT VON FRITZ mental thesis of the absolute unity of that which is and his denial of motion, while they accept his doctrine that nothing can come out of nothing and that nothing can really perish. Empedocles and Anaxago- ras, furthermore, accept Parmenides' ver- dict that the ,?) ov can in no way exist, and therefore they deny the existence of an empty space, while Leucippus and Democritus start from the assumption that the ,?) ov does, in a way, exist, name- ly, as the empty space, the K(VOv. All these philosophers, finally, agree that the testi- mony of our senses is not sufficient to make us grasp the true reality but that this testimony is not completely without value and that it is, at least to some ex- tent, possible to grasp the truly real by means of a correction of the testimony of the senses, though the extent of this cor- rection and the methods followed in ac- complishing it vary greatly from one philosopher to another. Yet there are some fundamental differences between Empedocles and all the others. In the first place, Empedocles, in con- trast to Anaxagoras, Leucippus, and Democritus, still writes in verse and be- gins his philosophical poem with a "myth- ological" introduction.'03 This he has in common with Parmenides. Yet here, too, there is an essential difference. The poetic form of Parmenides' work is appropriate inasmuch as the truth, even though after much hard thinking, has come to him as a "revelation." But, apart from this, nei- ther his thought itself nor its expression has been essentially affected by the poetic form. Where the content of the "revela- 103 There can be no doubt that in the flrst line of the poem in which Pausanias is addressed (B 1), Emped- odles speaks In his own name. In contrast to Par- menides, who attributes the philosophical part of his poem directly to the goddess who reveals the truth to him, Empedocles seems to be the speaker throughout his work. But the invocation of the Muse in B4 is not merely a poetic form, since Empedocles obviously claims divine inspiration for what he has to say (cf. B23. 11; B2. 9; etc.). tion" which he passes on to his listeners or readers is concerned, his language is abstract and his terminology very precise. Empedocles, on the other hand, wrote a religious and somewhat mystical poem, the so-called KaOap4ol, and a philosophi- cal and scientific one, which ancient writers, if they mention a title at all, usually quote as lHEp' 4vWTEW, though this title can hardly be original. This latter poem may be called more "scientific" than the work of Parmenides, because it attempts to give not only a causal expla- nation of the origin and evolution of the universe in which we live but also a de- tailed analysis of various special physical phenomena, not infrequently based on "scientific" experiments.'04 Yet in spite of this and in spite of the fact that the mythological introduction is much less closely linked up with the rest of the poem than in the work of Parmenides, the poeti- cal and the philosophical or scientific ele- ments are much less completely and clear- ly separated in his work. This is true not only of the introduction of the some- what anthropomorphic forces of 4tX60XS and NEZKOS as the main driving agents in the genesis of the universe but, above all, of his terminology; for, in contrast to Parmenides, he uses in the philosophical or scientific parts of his poem many Ho- meric terms which in his time were no longer used outside of poetry, or even of epic poetry, and he not infrequently seems to vary the expressions or terms he uses merely for the sake of stylistic vari- ety, even where the most essential con- cepts are concerned. This makes an analy- sis of his terminology a good deal more difficult. Yet if this peculiarity of Em- pedocles' style is taken into due considera- tion, it seems not impossible to arrive at definite and clear-cut results, which then may make it possible to determine more 104 Cf. A66, A67, A34, B100 (Diels).</page><page sequence="4">NOTE, NOEIN, AND THEIR DERIVATIVES 15 clearly the second main point of difference between him and his contemporaries, namely, in regard to the character of their "theory of knowledge." The peculiarity of Empedocles' style and terminology stands out very clearly in the very first fragment of his main work in which the word voos occurs: orewvcowrot /.ev 'yap 7raXAtaL Kara' yv-a KeXvvrat- iroXX&amp;a U SeLX' g,Arara, r4 Tr &amp;A3X:vovocL /IzEpL/Ivas iraipov U vcoi/s 16Oov ,Aepos a&amp;p naavTes OKViiOpOL Karvoto SLK17V &amp;pO&amp;VTES 6rerTrav acro ,uovov 7rEGO-EvTES, 0rc, 11-p OO7KUpa-EV EKaG-TOS 7rav-oa' eXavvo,uEVOL, rO S'6XOV &lt;tas&gt; EivxET(a evpetv, OVTOS O06r' 1rL8EpKTa Tar6' &amp;V8paTLv O06T' elraKVoTac 057Ef VO6W 7rEpLX?77TcA Oa 8' oi3v, 1EfL ci,8 reUaoeat ov rXeiov flW fpOTEtfl /TLS 6pwpev.'05 The central statement in this passage is obviously that the life of human beings is too short and that everybody therefore believes only that which has come within the compass of his own very limited ex- perience, while he thinks and boasts that he has found out the whole. In this way, Empedocles continues, men can neither see nor hear "this" (ra'e, which means, obviously: that which Empedocles is go- ing to explain and which is the fundamen- tal truth about the structure and evolu- tion of the universe), nor can they encom- pass it with their voos. In this passage the voos is mentioned along with seeing and hearing almost in the same way as in the famous fragment of Xenophanes.'06 It is differentiated from the senses, however, inasmuch as its function seems to be to encompass (1rEptXai4,avewv) something. The relation of the vOos to the 105 B2 (Diels). 10f Xenoph. B24; cf. Part I, CP, XL, 229. senses is further clarified by another frag- ment,'07 in which Empedocles' listener or reader is warned not to give more credence to his sense of vision (65t's) than to his ears, or to his ears more than to the "reve- lations" (TpavcbriaTa) of his tongue (which obviously means "to his sense of taste"), or to favor these as against any one of the other organs (7yvZa) in however many ways there is a pathway to voetv (iro6avp rorpos foT7 voiKaat). This fragment makes it still clearer that, just as in Homer and Xe- nophanes,'08 the voos in Empedocles' phi- losophy perceives, at least ordinarily,109 through the organs of the senses. It also explains the 7r-pJXa,q3ave&amp;v in the first fragment. The voOS comprises (and makes use of) the testimony of all the senses. It is also its function to embrace in its compre- hension the whole of the universe, but it is hampered in this task by the shortness of human life and the consequent insufficien- cy of experience. Finally, the voos seems to have the function of selection; for we are exhorted to admit to the voos that which is presented to us by the senses only in so far as it is clear."10 But what kind of clarity is meant, whether merely the clearness of the vision and distinctiveness of sounds or a clear and integrated insight into the interrelation between the testi- mony of various senses, is not determined by the fragment. On the negative side one may, furthermore, say that so far it is cer- tainly not necessary to assume that the meaning of "logical reasoning" is in any way implied in the term. The further interpretation of the two fragments is made rather difficult by the fact, already mentioned, that they con- tain a good many terms which seem either completely or nearly synonymous, partly 107 B4. 108 See Part I, CP, XL, 229. 109 For possible exceptions see below, p. 18. 110 B3(4). 13: PO6e 64 l 5j)XOV Ua-rovor</page><page sequence="5">16 KURT VON FRITZ with one another, partly with terms which have already been discussed. On the side of sensual perception the analysis of these terms is comparatively easy. In the first line of the first fragment mentioned, Em- pedocles says that narrow raXa4iat are spread over our body. HaXaiwq originally means "the palm of the hand," then "the open hand," and finally "the hand" with- out special qualification. But when in the other fragment Empedocles tells his reader Opet lracTp 7raXMui?"' and then enumerates the various senses, -raXa',u- obviously is a general designation of all organs of sen- sual perception. The choice of the term seems to convey the idea that the senses somehow grasp their objects. The other term, aOpet, means originally "to gaze at," "to look upon something with great attention." In the expression quoted, this term also is extended to cover all the senses and obviously is chosen to mark the intensity with which the senses are bent upon their objects. It is perhaps interest- ing to note that the two expressions which Empedocles uses to designate sensual per- ception in general are borrowed from the sense of vision and the sense of touch,"12 that is, from the most comprehensive of our senses and from that sense which seems most directly in touch with its ob- jects."3 The remaining two relevant terms in the two fragments are jufptliva and ,in.Ts. The first of these words is supposed to be etymologically related to a word meaning "to remember," but in Homer it usually means "care," "solicitude," while the sec- ond one seems etymologically related to Lat. metior, "to measure," and in Homer usually means "foresight," "premedita- 1ll B3(4). 9. 112 For analogies in other pre-Socratic philosophers see K. von Fritz, Philosophie und sprachlicher Aus- druck bei Demokrit, Platon und Aristoteles (New York: Stechert, 1938), p. 22. 113 Cf. also Emped. B133. tion of the future," then also "wisdom" and the "skill" of an artist who works ac- cording to a clearly visualized mental image of the thing which he is going to create. But in Empedocles the meaning of both these words can hardly be distin- guished from that of vo'os. The statement of B2. 2, 7-oXa be be&amp;LX ',urata, Ta T' 6,u43Xv- vovotept,qvas, is repeated in Bi11. 7. But there it is followed by a description of how the y'ptwvat, if insignificant things intrude upon them, go away and "join their own family." "For everything," Empedocles continues, "has 4povqrgts and its share of zcPAua [= 'o'qua]!" Obviously, then, the juept,wat belong to the same -yewza or family as opovr77fs and '677,ua. This is confirmed by the first part of the fragment. Here we are told what happens if the -pariaes (which is the same as opeves) are firm and vigorous (Abvaa), while the second half explains what happens when the juept,uvat are blunted (a9,u,XV'o'Ta). Hlparlaes and ,uept,uva, therefore seem equivalent. At most, they may be dis- tinguished on the analogy of vo'os and voi,qua, the 1rpa1rLaes being the organ and its function, the ,juptypat the results of this function. The case of jp-Tts is only slightly differ- ent. M,qrbeo Oat in B139 means "to think of or contemplate an action." But this is also the meaning of 'oe-t in B84. 1. M-rns in B23 means the "skill of an artist," which, however, as pointed out above, is also a kind of foresight. In the two other pas- sages in which the word occurs"14 it means "mental capacity" in general. Aristotle, when quoting the second one of these pas- sages,"5 translates the word ,u-rts by opo6'vfts and adduces another fragment from Empedocles, which contains about the same statement as B106 but uses the word opeves. Since u-ns, in the sense of 114 B2. 9 and B106. 115 Metaph.

If this is so, two further inferences con- cerning the vo'os can be drawn from these lines in B2 in which ,iCpjCuvat and juns are mentioned. The vo'os can be dulled or blunted. This notion is familiar from Homer. But in Homer the vo'os is blunted by a physical blow, by sorcery, or by a strong passion. In Empedocles it is blunted because, or when, it is too much directed toward trivial things."6 There is also the notion, encountered above in the works of Xenophanes, that the vo'os of human beings, even if not blunted, is limited in its comprehension."7 Apart from this, the analysis so far has shown that, together with their syn- onyms, the words vo'os and vo-th in Em- pedocles seem to designate mainly two things: (1) a mental capacity or function which selects, sifts,"18 corrects, and, above all, co-ordinates and interconnects the testimony of the various senses and (2) planning of an action and foresight. The second meaning is interesting mainly be- cause it shows that Empedocles has taken over a well-known Homeric usage, which, as far as we can judge from the fragments, was not adopted by earlier philosophers, though it seems to have also affected Anaxagoras' concept of vovs.1"9 But since 116 BllO. 6 ff. 117 B2. 9: re6Teat of irX&amp;w Ji ,POTrEI?7 AqTLS 6pWpeY. 11B See B5. 3; cf. also below, p. 20. 119 I take Empedocles and Anaxagoras as contem- poraries, though Anaxagoras may have been born somewhat, but hardly more than ten years, earlier than Empedocles. There is no indication that Emped- ocles' use of the word z'os was in any way influenced by Anaxagoras' very peculiar concept. it does not occur in any passage which is of central importance for Empedocles' phi- losophy, it need not be further discussed. The first meaning quoted seems to come near enough to the most frequent and probably most original meaning of the word in Homer: the vo'os which not merely recognizes an object but under- stands a situation in which many objects are correlated to one another and the vo'os which corrects a first, but erroneous, im- pression. There is, however, the important difference that in Empedocles the word 'yI'yVI'cKEu' no longer has the same mean- ing or the same range of meaning as in Homer and that, therefore, a very essen- tial part of the function of 'yVyV'0c0KEft in Homer is now attributed either to the senses or to the ,oos.12O For this and other reasons the relation between the vo'os and the senses must be further analyzed. According to B2, the senses are the iropoi through which the vo'os receives the raw material for its insight into the true na- ture of the world. This may even be taken in a material sense, considering the fact that in B105. 3 the blood about the heart'2' is described as the seat of the vo'os and 120 The word -yL-yzcrKet occurs only twice in the ex- tant fragments of the work of Empedocles (B4 (5). 3 and B89). In both cases it does not mean "to recognize or identify an object," as in Homer, but "to understand a statement." Snell (op. cit., p. 28) has tried to show how this meaning could derive from the original one, by pointing out that in an early period the thought which is expressed in words could be conceived as an object which must be recognized. To put it in a some- what different way, one might perhaps say that to un- derstand the thought means to recognize and under- stand its object, whether this be a concrete thing or an event, and add that in the early period of Greek specu- lation the thought and its object are often hardly dis- tinguished. That this is still true to some extent of Empedocles is perhaps illustrated by BilO. 2, where Empedocles exhorts his listener to look upon that which he has to tell him with a pure effort (that is, free from selflsh cares) and straining (literally, "leaning on") his Trparl8es to the utmost. But the word yvyP6aKe&amp;P in the extant fragments of the work of Empedocles is used only where a statement is understood or an ob- ject through a statement but never, as usually in Homer, where an object is recognized directly as it pre- sents itself to the sense of vision or touch, etc. 121 VeP&amp;K&amp;p3t1oP alMa.</page><page sequence="7">18 KURT VON FRITZ that, according to Theophrastus,122 Em- pedocles explained sensual perception as due to effluences or abrobboal from the ob- jects which penetrate into the sensual organs; for it seems reasonable to assume that these effluences are transmitted from the organs of perception to the heart, where they are sifted.123 Yet there are some passages which in- dicate that the vo'os in certain circum- stances can acquire insight without the help of the senses. So Empedocles says of God124 that he has no head or limbs (hence, we must infer, no special organs of vision, hearing, etc., but only a 4pz', which, as shown above, in Empedocles is the same as vo'os and which pervades the whole universe with its swift kpoz'ribes).125 In another passage126 Empedocles says that we cannot reach God with our eyes or grasp him with our hands, "which," he says, "is the main path of firm conviction leading to the cpfiv of human beings." The implications of this passage are much less clear than those of the first passage. It clearly says that (ordinarily?) the 4pm'V or voos gets its most important raw ma- terial for true insight through the sense of vision and the sense of touch. If, on the other hand, the assumption is made that human beings can have some knowledge of God, the implication seems to be that this knowledge is acquired by the voos directly and without the help of the senses. 122 See Emped. A86. 7 (from Theophr. De sensu). 123 Cf. also B5. 3, where the words of the Muse are sifted in the o7rX&amp;-yxva, to which the heart belongs. Though it is the meaning of the words which in this case is sifted by the aorX1vyxva as the seat of v6ov, the words as sounds must have reached the aorXATxva through the senses. 124 B134. 125 This idea is in harmony with the statement in B110. 10 that everything in the world is pervaded with op6zaLT and vPtca, and it is not necessarily at variance with the assumption that the 6p6P7oaLT or v6of of human beings is especially concentrated in the heart. 126B 133: o&amp;K gaTLJ reX&amp;aaalat fI' &amp;OcaXuotv Of&amp;KTd&amp;V iAETEpoLv e Xepal Xace?p, ?rfp TE yla-rT? 7reLOOVs &amp;vOpe.oroav &amp;/.lAcLTds 6s kpkvca lrrre&amp;. But there is still the possibility that Em- pedocles means merely to say that we cannot reach God with our senses alone and directly but that we can grasp his na- ture somehow indirectly by looking at the world as it is presented to us by the senses. In a way this would come rather near to the Christian idea of knowing God through his works. But it would still be necessary to ask whether this knowl- edge is acquired by logical inference, that is, by drawing a conclusion from the effect to the cause, or in some other fash- ion. A partial answer to this question is given by two other fragments. In B17. 20 ff., Empedocles speaks of 4D6rTS or Love as one of the main great driving agents which keep the world in motion. Then he goes on to say: TZ' V oiv '6o, apiKEV, As78' o4,Aaas v rao Tc07tr -a rather close parallel to the passage quoted before. But the way in which we acquire knowledge of 4tX6Tqs is further described in B109: ,yatL7 Aev y&amp;p -yatav o6rra/uev, vhaT; 5' v&amp;.p, aWept 8' aWepa SZov, &amp;T&amp;p 7rvpt 7r-vp a`MqXov, rTOpytV P Uropya , VELKOS 'fr TE VEL XV(p4. This passage is of decisive importance not only for the interpretation of Empedocles but also for a full understanding of some of his great predecessors; for it shows clearly that in Empedocles' opinion the recognition of Love and the insight into its nature is not an indirect one and that it is not brought about by inference or logical reasoning but is as direct and im- mediate as the recognition (or percep- tion?) of earth, fire, and water. Yet he has stated with equal clarity that 1XrTs is not seen or recognized by the senses. How, then, is it recognized? The context leaves no doubt as to Empedocles' answer to this question: "Because love and hatred are in ourselves, are part of ourselves," he would say, "we can recognize them directly, not only in other living beings, but also as</page><page sequence="8">NOTE, NOEIN, AND THEIR DERIVATIVES 19 cosmic forces, everywhere in the world." But, according to B109, this is also true of the perception of earth, water, "aether," and fire, though these elements seem to be perceived by the senses.'27 What, then, is the difference between the perception of the elements and the perception of hate and love? Why, if there is such a differ- ence, as other fragments seem to indicate, is the same common principle that like is perceived by like applied to both kinds of perception? What, finally, is the origin of that common principle itself? The principle that like is perceived by like is most easily understandable for us in its application to love and hate. When a person has a certain facial expression, speaks in a certain tone, assumes a cer- tain posture, etc., we seem to feel directly that this person is filled with hatred, is angry, is sad, or is full of joy, etc. At pres- ent we are inclined to attribute this feel- ing to an unconscious inference from the fact that we ourselves have a similar ex- pression or behave in a similar way when feeling a similar emotion. From the ex- treme behavioristic point of view this may even be an unwarranted inference. But the accuracy or inaccuracy of these modern views and interpretations has no bearing on the present question. What matters is merely that when we see the expression of hate or anger in another per- son we are not conscious of drawing an in- ference from his facial expression or his behavior to his feelings but have the im- pression that we perceive his emotion di- rectly. Yet this "direct perception" of the emotions of a person is not in the same way linked up with a specific sensual or- gan as is the perception of light and dark- ness or of sound, since the anger or sad- ness of a person can be perceived in his voice as well as in his facial expression. It seems, therefore, not difficult to under- 127 Cf. also Theophr. De sensu 7. stand128 why Empedocles attributes the "direct perception" of love and hate not to the senses but to the voos. At the same time, it seems clear how this kind of "perception," if it is felt as such, can lead to the theory that like is perceived by like; for when we see an angry or sad person, we have not only the impression that we know in abstracto that this person is angry or sad but, even if we remain free from any contagion by his emotion, that there is something in us which responds to it and that, even while remaining calm, we have the feeling that we understand the mood or the emotion of the person in its individual quality be- cause, at least potentially, it is also in our- selves. In its application, therefore, to love and hate and also to other passions and emotions, the principle that like is per- ceived by like seems easy enough to un- derstand. Nevertheless, one may very well ask the question whether this is really the origin of the principle (1) because its transference to the perception of water, fire, etc., seems very strange and (2)- and this seems an even more cogent ob- jection-because the principle is obvious- ly older than Empedocles and because his predecessors, as far as we know, did not apply it to the perception of love, hate, and other emotions. Yet it is exactly here that the key to the whole problem is found. Among Em- pedocles' predecessors, both Heraclitus and Parmenides, especially the latter, make use of the principle. Yet they do not apply it to emotions but to light and darkness, warmth and cold, silence and sound, etc. On an earlier occasionl29 it was pointed out that to Parmenides these were not merely sensual qualities and that they are closely related to the primary 128 See also below, p. 20. 129 See Part I, CP, XL, 240.</page><page sequence="9">20 KURT VON FRITZ contrasts from which, in the philosophy of Anaximander, the world in which we live emerges. It is now time to point out that they are also emotional qualities, or, in the terms of early Greek thought, more correctly, qualities or conditions of the soul. When we speak of warm love, cold hate, the darkness of sorrow, etc., we say that we speak in "metaphors." But these metaphors would not occur in practically all languages if the transference of these concepts from one field to the other was not natural to the human race, whatever the reason for it may be. To Empedocles' predecessors, however, this was not a transference of concepts but actually an identity of qualities, as Heraclitus' famous fragments'30 on the wet souls of drunk- ards and the dry fire of the soul of the wise man clearly indicate. Once this is clearly understood, both the origin and the later development of the theory that like is perceived by like become quite intelligible. In fact, the ori- gin of this theory can be much more easily explained on the basis of the earlier con- cept than on the basis of Empedocles' philosophy; for the presence of love can still be understood by a man who is full of hatred, but he is no longer able to feel its warmth, and it is a common experience that in the darkness of sorrow everything becomes dark. It is only because to us the warmth of love, the darkness of sorrow or ignorance,"3' etc., have become mere 130 Herac. B117 and B118 (Diels). 131 The fact that ignorance appears related to dark- ness and knowledge to light explains, perhaps, the dis- crepancy in Parmenides' theory of the acquisition of knowledge pointed out above (n. 90). Theophrastus can hardly be completely wrong when he says that, according to Parmenides, PoeTP through warmth and light is better than PoeTp through cold and dark; for in the introductory myth in Parmenides' work the dis- covery of the truth appears as a travel from darkness to light (Bi. 6-10 [Dielsl). But the truth itself, which is revealed to Parmenides at the end of this travel, paradoxically consists in the insight that we are wrong when we divide the world into light, warmth, sound, on the one side, and darkness, cold, silence, on the metaphors that we understand the prin- ciple more easily in its Empedoclean ap- plication to love and hate than in its ap- plication to light and darkness, warmth and cold, silence and noise, etc. Likewise, what appears to us as the transference of the principle that like is perceived by like from the field of emotional to the field of physical qualities is much more natural where emotional and physical qualities are conceived as identical than in the philosophy of Empedocles, in which the theory of love and hate as the driving forces in the physical world and the exten- sion of the principle of perception by like qualities to the elements seem due to rath- er artificial analogies. As a result, then, it can be said that voos in Empedocles has three meanings or, if the voos is considered a unit, that it has three functions: (1) It directly perceives love and hate both in other human beings and as driving forces in nature, and it does so either through the senses or in in some cases, perhaps, without this in- termediary; (2) it co-ordinates and in- tegrates the testimony of the senses into an understanding of the whole ;132 and (3) it has also the function of planning and guiding the actions of human beings.133 The last of these meanings of voos and voELv is obviously taken over directly from the ancient usage of the word which can already be found in Homer. It is not of very great significance in Empedocles' philosophy. The second meaning shows a great affinity to the old Homeric meaning "to realize a situation." But it is extended to comprise the understanding of the world as a whole. In this respect it has a other, considering one group as positive and the other as negative. For the assumption that dark, cold, etc., exist but are negative implies the assumption of the existence of a pi 5v, which is impossible. 132 See above, p. 17. 183 Ibid.</page><page sequence="10">NOTE, NOEIN, AND THEIR DERIVATIVES 21 certain affinity to the concept of voos as found in Xenophanes and Heraclitus.'34 It is the first of the three meanings which is historically and philosophically most interesting. It is not found in Ho- meric usage, yet is not quite remote from it either; for it is very often the mood of a person, his friendliness or unfriendliness, etc., which is the decisive factor in the meaning of a situation.'35 At the same time, one finds here the only affinity be- tween Empedocles' and Parmenides' con- cepts of voos; for the direct perception of love and hate by the voos, according to the principle that like is perceiVed by like, is obviously influenced by Parmenides' theory concerning the origin of 564a. This relation to Parmenides appears even closer if one supplements the evi- dence provided by the literal fragments with the testimony of Theophrastus,'36 who says that, according to Empedocles, the voos functions most properly in those persons in whom there is an equally bal- anced mixture of the elements; for if the mixture is not equally balanced, a person will be partly blind to the presence of those elements in the external world which are inadequately represented in the person himself. On the negative side it is most impor- tant to notice that in the philosophy of Empedocles voELv never has the meaning of "reasoning" and that, in his opinion, all knowledge seems to be acquired by some kind of direct perception, since even the co-ordination and integration of the testimony of the various senses in his philosophy seems due rather to some spe- cial faculty of the voos by which it directly perceives the interrelation between the various sensual data than to any kind of reasoning. This is also what Theophrastus obviously has in mind when he says'37 134 See Part I, CP, XL, 230 and 234. 135 See von Fritz, CP, XXXVIII (1943), 88 ff. 138 De sensu 11. 1a7 Ibid. 10. that in Empedocles' system cpoveZv138 and atOtnOas are either the same (raVTO) or very similar (irapar-Xatov) to each other. In this respect, therefore, Empedocles has no share in the most important develop- ment in the history of the meaning of the terms voos and voEtv, which was initiated by Parmenides and carried further by his disciples, Melissus and Zenon. While in this respect Empedocles seems to represent a pre-Parmenidean type of thought, there are other features in his philosophy which show him to have been a child of his time and by which he has contributed to the rise of a theory of knowledge which was of decisive impor- tance for the later history of the terms voos and voGLv, namely, the clear distinc- tion between the immaterial forces of love and hate and the material elements of fire, aether, water, and earth, and the more detailed criticism of sensual percep- tion which is attributed to him by Theo- phrastus.'39 PROTAGORAS In the fragments of the works of those pre-Socratic philosophers who have not yet been discussed, the terms voivs, voELv, etc., appear but rarely and-with the ex- ception of some fragments of the work of Anaxagoras-not in a very significant context. Nevertheless, there can be no doubt that some of them had a decisive influence on the later history of these terms by promoting the further develop- ment of the antithesis between altoanats and voivs, the first traces of which could al- ready be discovered in the philosophy of Parmenides' disciples, Zenon and Melis- sus.140 Most important in this respect are the atomism of Leucippus and Democ- ritus and what is often called the "sub- jectivism" of Protagoras. 138 Concerning OpoPeZP as a synonym of voeZp in the language of Empedocles, cf. above, p. 16. 139 De sensu 7 f. 140 See above, p. 12.</page><page sequence="11">22 KURT VON FRITZ Protagoras' contribution is crystallized in the famous statement: lraiVTWV xp?7raTcdv /ETpOV iOTLV dvOpc.ros, rwLv Aev OYvTrv Ws c TtY Trc$v U OVK O Yvrwv C'S OUiK oa-v. It is obvious- ly not possible within the framework of this study to discuss in detail all the various interpretations of this sentence which have been given in ancient and modern times.'41 But it will be sufficient for our purpose to determine its meaning as correctly as possible as far as it has a bearing on the problem under discussion. Plato, who is the earliest author to quote the famous sentence,142 indicates clearly that Protagoras illustrated his statement by pointing out that when a wind is blowing, one person may feel cold while another does not; and that in such a case there is no sense in contending that the wind in itself is cold or, on the con- trary, that it is not cold, since obviously it is cold for one person and not cold for the other. So far there can be hardly any doubt that Plato gives Protagoras' own interpretation of his statemnent,143 even though he may have slightly changed the wording. But when he goes on to explain that "to be cold for a person" means to appear cold to a person and then identifies this appearance (4avTauLa from 4aLveaOaL) with sensual perception (aZGaVLS), he is obviously drawing his own conclusions from Protagoras' interpretation, so that it is no longer certain whether these con- clusions coincide exactly with Protagoras' own opinion. E. Kapp in an excellent discussion of Protagoras' principle144 has pointed out that the famous statement IavTwv XPWV &amp;- TWV KTX. is essentially directed against those 141 For a detailed discussion of this controversy see Zeller-Nestle, Die Philosophie der Griechen, I (6th ed.; Leipzig, 1920), 1349 ff. 142 Theaet. 151 e if. 143 Cf. ibid. 152 b: ;) 2re4ra6&amp;ea 7C( U$pwray6pq PQT&amp; riX pV 144 PTO ovX n, XIC ( ) 70 if. 144 Gnomon, XII (1936), 70 ff. earlier philosophers who, like Xenoph- anes, Heraclitus, Parmenides, Zenon, Melissus, and Empedocles, asserted that the opinions of "men," that is, of people in general, are all wrong and that the truth is entirely different;'45 and that Pro- tagoras tried to prove his point by show- ing in an individual case that it is quite senseless to try to prove to a man who is shivering in the wind that the wind is not cold. The correctness of this interpretation is confirmed by the fact that it permits the easy and complete solution of both of the main problems which Protagoras' state- ment presents, which have been discussed by scores of scholars without obtaining a definite result. The first of these prob- lems is whether avGpcoros in the sentence means "'man" in general or every single human individual. Kapp's interpretation shows clearly that it means both; that is, that primarily it means "man" as an ordi- nary human being and his concept of the world in general and the individual things in it in contrast to the presumed superior truth which the philosopher claims to pos- sess and which he contrasts with the error of the common crowd. But, in trying to prove his point, Protagoras uses the indi- vidual as an example, and his demonstra- tion implies unquestionably that even the individual concepts and sensations of the individual, even if they differ from those of other individuals, are as indisputably true for this individual as the common no- tions of most human beings are true for 145 TMs defense of the "natural" views of the "or- dinary" or "common" man against the claims of philosophers and scientists, by the way, is also a char- acteristic of the works of some other Sophists of the fifth century. Antiphon's contention, for instance, that a tangent touched the circle in more than one point belongs obviously in this category. Far from proving that the Greek mathematicians of the flfth century "were not yet able to form the purely mathematical concept of a tangent," as some scholars believe, this contention of Antiphon is an absolutely certain proof that at his time a tangent had been deflned as a straight line which touches a circle In only one point.</page><page sequence="12">NOT2, NOEIN, AND THEIR DERIVATIVES 23 the majority of the human race, whether they conflict with the ideas of the philoso- phers or not. The second problem is whether c&amp;s in cbs TTLv and cS OlVK fi'TlV means "that" or "how." Though Kapp has not discussed this problem, it is not difficult to show that his interpretation of Protagoras' statement as a whole makes a complete solution of the problem easy. There can be no doubt whatever that, in accordance with the prevailing linguistic usage of the time of Protagoras and especially in refer- ence to the preceding OVTCwv and OU'K 6OVTWV cbs EaTLv means "that they exist" and cbs OK EcTTLV "that they do not exist." Yet when Protagoras illustrates his point by means of the qualities or, to use Aristotle's lan- guage, the IrOl6TiTES, of "warm" and "cold," it seems equally clear that cs in both cases must mean "how," though in good Greek this would really be ola. At this point, however, one has again to re- member that in early Greek philosophy, that is, for the predecessors of Heraclitus and Parmenides, warm and cold were not r1OlOTi7TEs, much less purely sensual quali- ties, but rather the fundamental contrasts of which the universe consists,'46 and in this sense xp?luaTa or 6vTa. Both Parmen- ides and Heraclitus had affirmed that "'men"y are wrong when they speak of these contrasts as of an ultimate reality, Heraclitus by affirming that what is cold or death or generally negative for us is warm and life and positive from another aspect, Parmenides by resolving all con- trasts in the unity of that which is. If then, opposing this philosophy, Protag- oras declares that it is senseless to tell human beings that they are mistaken in distinguishing cold and warm as they feel them and that, in fact, cold and warm are what they are for the people who feel them, it is clear that, from the point of 146 See ParxtI,'CP, XL, 240f. view of the philosophy which he combats and therefore, primarily at least, also from the point of view of Protagoras, cbs EaT-v and cbs OVK EcaTtV mean "that they exist" and "that they do not exist"; for it was the existence of warm and cold, either as contrasts in general or in a given individual case, which had been in dis- pute. Yet from the standpoint of a later philosophy for which warm and cold are transitory qualities or 7r -olrres of things which exist independently of these quali- ties, cis CaTtv and &amp;oS OVK CaTtlv in Protag- oras' statement inevitably acquire the meaning of "how they are" and "how they are not." Since Protagoras is on the border line between the earlier and the later philosophy'47 and since, by the very state- ment under discussion, he himself has greatly contributed to the development and clarification of this later philosophy,148 those modern scholars who have con- tended that W's means "how" are not quite wrong from the point of view of later philosophy, though their knowledge of the Greek language is not beyond re- proach. But one has to see Protagoras in his exact historical situation in order to understand him fully. If this is correct, it follows that Plato, when drawing his further con- clusions mentioned above, had al- ready given a one-sided interpretation of 147 This distinction between the "earlier" and the "later" philosophy is, of course, very crude and inade- quate, since the "later" comprises views so utterly different, as, for instance, Aristotle's distinction be- tween obala and "o6v and Democritus' view (see be- low, p. 29) that warm and cold, light and dark, bitter and sweet, etc., are the ways in which our sensual or- gans perceive the shapes of the atoms and the impact with which they strike the various parts of our body or, perhaps more correctly, the subjective qualities in- to which our sensual organs translate the shape and impact of the atoms. What is common to the "later" philosophy, in the sense in which the word is taken here, is merely that warm and cold, etc., have become real or apparent qualities of something else and are no longer the ultimate constituents of the "real" world. I's See below, p. 27.</page><page sequence="13">24 KURT VON FRITZ Protagoras' statement; for, though Pro- tagoras illustrated his point by referring to what we would call the "sensations" of cold and warm, he undoubtedly meant to give his principle a much wider applica- tion.'49 What he meant to say was that the world and everything in the world is what it appears to be (a) to human beings in general and (b) to every individual. What it appears to be to an individual may change from time to time, and this change may be influenced by various things, among others by teaching, rheto- ric, and indoctrination. But there is no sense in the contention that there exists a true world totally different from what most ordinary people feel the world to be, and even less sense in the assumption that this true world is accessible to human knowledge. This view seems also to have been the serious element in Gorgias' dia- lectical tour de force, when in his famous pamphlet, HEpt' OcoTecs 79 repl roTv /.L? OVTOSI he tried to prove (a) that nothing exists, (b) that if something existed it would not be accessible to our knowledge, and (c) that if someone did have such knowledge it would be impossible for him to com- municate it to others.'50 We have no evidence of any kind con- cerning the terminology which Protag- oras may have used in trying to prove his principle. Specifically, we do not know whether he used the terms voos and voe?v at all, or even a synonymous term. On the other hand, it is unlikely that he used the terms alo-Or-ats, aYocaLveYOat, since in all the literal fragments of the works of the pre- Socratics that have come down to us the various senses are always mentioned sepa- rately and are not brought together under the one designation aloOqf lots.'51 Yet, in spite 149 See Kapp, op. cit., p. 71. 150 For a further analysis of Gorgias' arguments and of his terminology, see below, p. 32. 151 It is perhaps interesting to observe that Democ- ritus, when distinguishing sensual perception from of all this, there can be no doubt what- ever that, through the way in which he tried to prove his principle, Protagoras had a very great influence on the history of the terms voos and voetv. THE ATOMISTS Protagoras had tried to prove his point by referring to the qualities of warm and cold. In pre-Parmenidean philosophy these qualities had been considered the fundamental objective contrasts of which the world consists. Parmenides and Hera- clitus, however, though in different ways, had contended that these contrasts ap- pear as contrasts only in the belief of "men," while in reality they are dissolved in a deeper unity. In Parmenides' philos- ophy both true insight and e64a are ulti- mately produced by the vooS. But Par- menides' successors, Zenon and Melissus, had tried to confirm his conclusions by a criticism of the senses.152 As far back as the Homeric poems we find the notion that the voos has a deeper insight than our eyes and ears.'53 The same notion seems also inherent in the philosophy of Xenoph- anes and of Heraclitus.'54 In Empedo- cles' philosophy, finally, the perception of love and hate which is possible only to the voos is contrasted with the perception of the elements and their qualities which oc- curs through the senses.'55 If all this is taken together, nothing seems more nat- ural than that a philosopher who wished to defend the existence of a "real" world another and more penetrating kind of yA,j (B 11 [Diels]), still enumerates Opiv, &amp;KO&amp;etv, 66oOat, etc., but speaks of the fifth sense as of fv iaD boa-et atVO&amp;veo-at. The reason is, of course, that one can say f?' XaT1-ov bpaV, eKObELP, etc., but not br' XaTarov Vabetv because au.betv fundamentally and originally designates the action of touching something or the fact that something comes in contact with something else, but not the sense or sensation of touch. 152 See above, p. 12. 153 See von Fritz, CP, XXXVIII (1943), 89.

Having made this dis- tinction, he would then point out that what Protagoras had tried to show might well be true to some extent of the special field from which he had taken his example but not of knowledge in general. In view of the preceding development, it would also be natural to identify the field in which Protagoras' argument, within cer- tain limitations,156 does hold true with per- ception by or through the various senses, while the field to which it does not apply might be identified with acquisition of knowledge through vOELl'. As shown above, the restriction of the validity of Protagoras' principle to the field of al'Aqts is made the starting-point for the further discussion, and more or less taken as a matter of course, in Plato's Theaetetus. But the distinction on which this restriction is based is much older and, within our knowledge, is found clearly formulated for the first time in the philo- sophical system of Democritus. The atomistic theory, which Democ- ritus tried to develop into an all-compris- ing explanation of all phenomena, had originally been created by Leucippus as an attempt to solve the fundamental prob- lem raised by the philosophy of Parmen- ides.'57 Parmenides' irresistible logic had 156 As to the meaning of this qualification, see be- low, p. 28. 16 7 For a more detailed analysis of the philosophy of Leucippus and of its relation to Parmenides see K. von Fritz, Philosophie und sprachlicher Ausdruck bei Demo- krit, Platon und Aristoteles, pp. 12 ff. In the same book I have also tried to determine more exactly the essen- tial difference between the character of the philoso- phies of Leucippus and Democritus and so implicitly to refute the contention of E. Rohde and other modern scholars that Leucippus had never lived and that atomism was exclusively a creation of Democritus. resulted in a denial not only of all coming- to-be and passing-away but also of all motion. Yet the evidence for the existence of motion seemed so strong that a way out of this dilemma had to be found. Leucip- pus found the solution of the problem in the bold assumption that, contrary to the fundamental premise of Parmenides' con- clusions, the ,i7 ov, the nothing, that which is not, in some way did exist, namely, as the empty space. As the opposite to this true nothing of empty space, that which really (KVplWS) is is filled space and nothing else. Since, besides the space-filling 6ov, the ,4 o v exists as empty space, the 6ov can move within this ,U?3 ov. But if that which is existed, so to speak, all in one lump, it would still not be possible to explain the enormous variety of motion which we ob- serve and the everlasting change of the shape and appearance of the things with which we are surrounded. Therefore, the assumption is made that that which is ex- ists in the form of innumerable extremely small particles. Each one of these particles has all the qualities of the Parmenidean One. It is uncreated, imperishable, indi- visible (hence the name "atom"), and immovable within itself. But by coming together to form a compound, the parti- cles cause this compound to come into be- ing; by separating from one another, they cause the compound to be destroyed; by changing their array, they cause it to change its form and appearance. Finally, by retaining their relative position to one another and moving as a group with the same velocity in the same direction,'18 they cause the compound to move with- out changing its shape.'19 With this gen- 168 The other possibility, namely, that the atoms do not retain their relative position to one another in- dividually but that those atoms which leave their rela- tive position are replaced by others, so that the gener- al form of the compound nevertheless remains the same, is only a variation within the same fundamental theory. 159 The question of what sort of existence the com- pound has in distinction from the atoms and whether</page><page sequence="15">26 KURT VON FRITZ eral solution of the problem Leucippus seems to have contented himself.160 Democritus set himself a much larger task. He accepted the fundamental princi- ples of the philosophy of Leucippus. But, not content with having explained the possibility of change and motion, he wished to show the real cause and origin of the qualities which the things surround- ing us appear to have, of weight, rigidity, resistance to pressure, but also of the ''sensual qualities" of cold and warmth, the tastes, smells, colors, and sounds. What is more, he wanted to show not only that all these qualities, whether seeming or real, could be produced by the atoms whose only fundamental quality was to be space-filling (from which, since they did not fill all space, it followed that they also had shape) but also what particular kind of atoms or combinations of atoms was the basis or cause of every single one of these phenomena.16' An enterprise of such scope could hard- ly be undertaken without a close reflection upon, and analysis of, the ways in which knowledge is acquired. Democritus' ap- proach to this problem was naturally con- ditioned by the theories of his older con- temporaries, Protagoras, Empedocles, and, to some extent, Anaxagoras. It is, there- fore, quite impossible to attain a full un- derstanding of what may be called De- mocritus' theory of knowledge and of his contribution to the development of the concepts of voos and voe-tv without con- its apperception as a whole is merely a subjective product of our organs of knowledge must be omitted from the discussion, since we have no evidence con- cerning Leucippus' views on this problem, if he con- sidered it at all. 160 For a more detailed discussion see von Fritz, Philosophie und sprachlicher Ausdruck bei Demokrit, Platon und Aristoteles, pp. 12 ff. 161 The enthusiastic spirit of investigation Inherent in this vast program is also beautifully expressed in the words 6obXeoOaL /aE?XXov lao efbpeU'v airT6o)Aoylav a T11i Ilepa2o' ol faaa?eicav ye4va0aa (B118). stantly keeping in mind that he had to for- mulate his own solution in such a way as to set it off as clearly as possible against the solutions attempted by his contempo- raries and predecessors. The ancient tradition concerning De- mocritus' theory of knowledge appears at first sight hopelessly confused and contra- dictory. The most extensive literal frag- ment of the works of Democritus which deals with the problem162 distinguishes be- tween two types of -yPv'c1t, a word which it is difficult to render in English, since, like the German word Erkenntnis, it means both knowledge as something which one has and the process of grasping the truth. The first kind of ye'V4tv is called "dark" and is identified with the five senses of vi- sion, hearing, smell, taste, and touch. The second is called "genuine" and described as coming in where the senses are no long- er able to go LirL XEwr6'repoP. This is a clear distinction between sensual perception and another and superior organ of knowl- edge. But the nature of this superiority is expressed in somewhat ambiguous terms; for the true contrast to "genuine" would be "spurious" (vo6os). In consequence, it remains uncertain whether Democritus means to say that the first Ty60c1,u is false or merely that it is imperfect, though the 7ir' Xe7rr&amp;repov seems to support the sec- ond interpretation. The second largest fragment'63 is a brief dialogue between the 5p1'V and the senses, in which the q5p1v says: v6,ucq xpol, VOb4 yXVKbV VO6.Y 7tLKpOV, Ere ' &amp;rota Kal KEVOl, while the senses answer: raXatva Ophv, irap fljLEcvw Xa!3oovaa ra%s 27riareLs rj4aS Kara- 162 Bll: -yvc5i.ns Si b6o dtcrlv t5a, j ,UfV -yvi7rt7, Si f JKOcri7 Kal 0TKOT717S 1dV r&amp;fe s7rav-ra, O&amp;S, &amp;KO7, 6Ojst, -ymsw, vaDcs . . .

In the fragment quoted, however, again the opposite with which it is contrasted is not the usual one, but ETEfl, an adverbial expression derived from TE6Os, which, in the earliest passages in which it occurs, means the truth of a statement, a prophecy, or the like.'65 There is, therefore, again the same am- biguity, due to the fact that the decisive terms do not appear with their usual op- posites. But just as in the first fragment one of the two possible interpretations of the contrast is stressed by the further elaboration of the relation between the two kinds of zyvC'u, so here again the an- swer of the alaOilatsc seems to lead to the conclusion that the inferior eyvW,ni is not entirely false or spurious, as the contrast to ETEp and yvqatLq would suggest, but merely less clear and hence imperfect.

A difficulty, however, is created by a number of fragments which seem to show that Democritus was rather an agnostic. These fragments are the following: B6: 'L7VYC0aKftV TE Xpi 'avOpwrov Tq'eS Tr4 KaVOVt, 6Tt ETEs a'\XXaKrat; B7: &amp;jXo?

The last of these statements has been brilliantly explained by Kapp,169 who showed that Aristotle, when quoting the statement in connection with his discus- sion of Protagoras' famous principle,170 did not mean to say that Democritus agreed with Protagoras but rather that he used the fundamental observation from which Protagoras started in order to draw from it the opposite conclusion. Protag- oras had said that all 4aLvobEva are equally true. Democritus answers: Either nothing is true, or the truth is not mani- fest to us. But to him this undoubtedly meant that there is a truth which is not manifest, which means that it is hidden and difficult to find. Otherwise, his whole atomistic system would be without mean- ing. In this respect, therefore, Democritus returns to the old conviction of Heraclitus, Parmenides, Empedocles, Anaxagoras, etc., all of whom had believed that there 168 Metaph. r. 5. 1009 b. 11; cf.

Part of the other fragments quoted can be explained on the same principle. But some of them contain another element which is not covered by Kapp's explana- tion and which is of very great importance for the problem of the relation of ai'&amp;rGtjts and vovs or 4pt'v in Democritus' theory. His repeated statements that "man" is far removed from truth or that we do not understand truly how everything is in reality, "because opinion for everybody is what is formed'7' in his mind (by the atoms which move in it or into it)," can- not, like similar statements of Heraclitus, Parmenides, etc., simply mean that the common crowd is ignorant, while the philosopher knows the truth. The older philosophers never say "we" in a state- ment of this kind, and Democritus could not assume that he alone was exempt from the common law that the atoms form in our organs of perception various shapes which are not always a true image of the real things outside ourselves. Democritus' theory of sensual percep- tion, of which Theophrastus has left us a rather extensive report,'72 shows clearly that, in his opinion, one has to distinguish two aspects of the question.'73 There can, he believes, be no doubt that, in the "real" world, nothing exists but the atoms and the empty space between them and that the atoms, when penetrating into our organs of perception, evoke there those images which most of us erroneously be- lieve to be true pictures of the "real" world outside ourselves. But while we are mistaken when we believe that colors, 171 Concerning the interpretation of the term i7rtpvc/L1?7 see Kapp, op. cit., p. 163. 172 De 8ensu 49-82; cf. Dem. A135 (Diels). 173 It is, of course, not possible within this article to discuss Democritus' theory of sense-perception in detail. But the accuracy of most of the following state- ments can easily be checked by a perusal of Theophras- tus' report (see the preceding note). smells, tastes, etc., are qualities of the "real" things, we can, from the nature of these subjective sensations, draw definite conclusions not only concerning the shape and motion of the atoms causing them but also, to some extent, concerning the internal structure and composition of the compounds from which those atoms have emanated. So far, and in this sense, it can then truly be said that the hidden truth is nevertheless in the phenomena and that sensual perception gives an "obscured" picture, but still a picture, of the "real" world. But-and this is the second aspect of the question-while all this is true in general, it does not permit us to draw ex- act and reliable conclusions concerning the actual structure of any object with which we are confronted in any individual instance ;174 for a person might be lacking in those atoms or combinations of atoms which had to be affected for the subjec- tive impression of certain colors, smells, etc., to arise. In this case the person's view of the surrounding world or objects would inevitably be defective and dis- torted. Or, on the other hand, images, seemingly of external objects, might arise when the organs are affected by atoms which had not come from the outside but had already existed in the person. This would be the case especially when such atoms, by chance, formed a com- pound similar in shape to well-known ob- jects of the external world. In this case the conclusion from the image to the ex- istence of a corresponding object outside the person would naturally be erroneous and unfounded. While, therefore, a cer- tain and definite knowledge concerning the general structure of the external world is possible and also a general knowledge concerning the structure of objects caus- ing certain sensations, the specific con- clusions concerning the presence and 174 This is the meaning of bxa&lt;Trov in B8 and B10.</page><page sequence="18">NOTE, NOEIN, AND THEIR DERIVATIVES 29 structure of specific objects at a given moment, which we are accustomed to draw, are always uncertain. This is the meaning of Democritus' "agnostic" state- ments. The analysis given so far makes it pos- sible to determine accurately the relation between alcraOtts and voos in Democritus' theory of knowledge. The identity of 4p71V, as it appears in the dialogue between ppfiv and alaO-qts,'75 with voos could be inferred from the general synonymity of the two terms in the philosophical writings of De- mocritus' period if it was not directly attested by B129.'76 It is also clear that the q5p7v or voos gets the material for its knowledge from the senses but clarifies and corrects what the senses offer it and by doing so attains a knowledge of the finer, that is, atomic, structure of the ex- ternal world, a knowledge of great accu- racy as far as the general structure of this world is concerned but less accurate and reliable in the individual case. How does the voos or q5p7v achieve this? Kapp'77 formulates it this way: "Thought has no way of its own to the truth. The truth is in the 0awvo6,eva. But thought is not content with the phenomena. It criti- cizes them and contents itself only after it has made something which satisfies thought and at the same time is in agree- ment with the phenomena." This is an admirable description of the process as envisaged by Democritus. But it is not quite sufficient for the present purpose, since we have also to know how the voos makes this something, even if, in trying to answer this question, we have to take the risk of going beyond Democritus' own awareness of what he was doing. There can be hardly any doubt that two very different elements are involved in the process. On the one hand, there are the ab- 176 B9; see also above, p. 27. 176 (Dpepj 66Ia voDvTra. 177 Op. Cit., p. 167. stract deductions from "a priori" con- cepts, which lead to the conclusion that there can be nothing but empty space and filled space and which, if the attempt is made to reconcile this result with the evi- dence of the phenomenal world, lead to the further assumption that the filled space exists in the form of innumerable very small indivisible and indestructible particles moving around in the empty space. On the other hand, there is the at- tempt to determine the shape and the character of the motion of the atoms which cause the various kinds of sensa- tions. This attempt operates obviously with a different kind of "reasoning." If Democritus, for instance, affirms"78 that the bitter taste is caused by small, smooth atoms with a rounded surface with bends (but not sharp corners) and then adds that for this reason the bitter taste has something sticky ('yXtrxpov) and gluelike (KoOe\fs), one can reconstruct his process of thinking in about the following way: The bitter taste has a sticky or gluelike character. Hence it must be caused by atoms of which glue could consist. Glue is sticky. Hence the atoms must have such a shape that, though being absolutely rigid, they will easily cling together. Hence the bends in their surface which may fit into one another. But glue is also liquid. Hence the atoms must easily change their position in relation to one another, and therefore they must have rounded bends and a smooth surface. What, then, does the mind do when going through this complicated process? First, the taste-sensation of bitter is re- placed by the similar or correlated touch- sensation of stickiness.'79 The reason is ob- viously that this latter sensation, or 178 A135. 66. 179 Possibly the reduction of bitterness to stickiness is partly due to the fact that gall was considered the bitter-tasting substance KaT' itoxiv and that gall is a sticky substance.</page><page sequence="19">30 KURT VON FRITZ rather the objects causing it, lend them- selves more easily to an analysis in terms of "atomistic mechanics." Then the sub- stances causing the touch-sensation of stickiness are studied. Both the sense of touch and the sense of vision indicate that "substances" causing the sensation of stickiness are either liquid or semiliquid and that, nevertheless, their parts stick together and also stick to other objects. Since a priori deductions have led to the conclusion that what appears as a "sub- stance" to the senses is in reality a com- pound of very small particles which are absolutely space-filling and rigid and dif- fer from one another only through their shape (and motion), the question is then asked what sort of solid and rigid particles of visible size, if put together, would have approximately the same properties (of clinging together and to other objects, yet changing their relative position to one another easily, as liquids do) which are characteristic of gluey substances. Since it is found that particles with a smooth surface and rounded bends come nearest to this requirement (for particles with sharp hooks, if interlaced, would hold to- gether more rigidly, and spheric particles with a smooth surface would not hang together at all), the conclusion is drawn that the gluey substances and hence all substances of bitter taste consist of in- visible particles of this shape. The process, then, which leads to the reconstruction of a particular section of the real but invisible world of which we obtain an "obscure" knowledge in sense- perception seems to include at least the following elements: (1) the presence of the most fundamental a priori concepts of "to be," "not to be," space, etc.; (2) de- ductions from analytical judgments based on these concepts and from the evidence of motion in the phenomenal world; (3) a study of the correlated testimony of the senses concerning specific objects; (4) various inferences on the basis of analogy; and (5) the search for models in the vis- ible world which satisfy certain conditions derived from 1, 2, 3, and 4 and which, therefore, again by analogy, can be used for the determination of the shape of their assumed correlates in the invisible world. Whatever additional elements may enter the process, there can be hardly any doubt that the activity of the cp'4v or vovs in Democritus' philosophy'80 does not ex- clusively consist of inductive and deduc- tive reasoning in the traditional sense but is much more complex. How far Democri- tus himself was conscious of, or reflected on, these various elements in his thinking we have no means of finding out. It is, however, sufficient for our purpose to as- certain their presence. CONCLUSION With this analysis of Democritus' con- cept of vovis and voetv, the main task of the present inquiry can be considered completed.'8' It remains to draw some general conclusions. If one tries to deter- mine the main changes which the meaning of the terms vovs and voe?v underwent in the course of the philosophical specula- tions of the pre-Socratics, as compared with the meaning or meanings of the same terms in Homer and Hesiod, two facts stand out most clearly: (1) In contrast to early Greek usage in which the voos, what- ever its special function in a given case 180 Apart from the function of the voDs In Democ- ritus' theory of knowledge, v6oS, VOEZV, and deriva- tives, like a&amp;oiAuw, appear also not infrequently in Democritus' ethical fragments. But the meaning there is mostly either "practical wisdom," which has its origin in the Homeric use of qSpVes, or the wisdom which distinguished the wise man from the common crowd, a meaning which was developed in early pre- Socratic philosophy. These passages, therefore, do not add anything strikingly new to the history of the term. 181 A few odds and ends which still remain may bet- ter be taken up later, when the main results of the in- quiry have been stated (see below, p. 32).</page><page sequence="20">NOTE, NOEIN, AND THEIR DERIVATIVES 31 may be, always has to do with specific situations, in Greek philosophy almost from the very beginning it becomes the main function of the vovs3 to discover the "real" world or the "real" character of the world as a whole, in contrast to the erroneous beliefs of most. human beings. But what is new in this usage is not that the vovs3 penetrates beyond surface ap- pearances and discovers the real truth- for this was also one of the functions of the vWoo in Homer-but the belief that the world is altogether different from what people in general believe it to be. (2) In Homer and Hesiod, 13eZv, which properly designates the sense of vision, can also be used for the recognition and identification of objects and even for the realization of a situation.182 The use of the term voetv, on the other hand, seems originally to have been limited to the latter case but was, even as early as Homer, extended to "planning" and to "the flight of the imagi- nation."''83 Yet with all this, its field was still rather narrowly circumscribed. In pre-Socratic philosophy, on the contrary, especially after Parmenides,'84 the part assigned to 1360 and the other senses is ever more narrowly defined, while at the same time the domain assigned to voivs and voetv is enormously enlarged. In the course of this process, vovs3 becomes syn- onymous with op'v, ,Ans, ,qptpuva and, to some extent, with yyvpuj,185 voETv with 4povetv, Ar7LeorOat, and, to some extent, with yyV0KtV.185 This means that, at 182 See Part I, CP, XL, 223. 183 See ibid., p. 225. 184 Before Parmenides and in the philosophy of Parmenides himself, the narrowing-down of the con- cept of Ib&amp;v and of the functions ascribed to the other senses is foreshadowed by the fact that the senses play only a very minor role in the discussion of the origin of human knowledge and error (see above, p. 12). 185 while no longer distinguished from voot in the same way as yyvv6axe&amp;v is from voeZv in Homer, is sometimes used by Democritus as the larger concept covering both senso-perception and voftv (see above, p. 26). the end of the process, vovs3 and voetv cover not only all the meanings which they had had in Homer but also all the mean- ings originally belonging to those other words'86 and, in addition, designate some further functions of the mind for which no specific terms existed in Homer and Hesiod because they were not specifically reflected upon. The most important addi- tions of this latter kind are: (1) the intui- tion by which Heraclitus is aware of the hidden harmony behind the apparent contrasts and conflicts which to the com- mon crowd mean ultimate reality;'87 (2) the logical deductions by which Parmen- ides arrives at his conclusions and the di- rect contact with ultimate reality which, in his philosophy, is characteristic of the v6os even when it errs ;188 (3) in the philos- ophy of Empedocles, the direct perception of Love and Hate in the external world through the response which these emo- tional agents engender in ourselves;'89 and (4) the complicated processes by which Democritus tries to attain a picture of ultimate reality.'90 In the fourth cen- tury the philosophies of Plato and Aris- totle were to make still further very im- portant additions of this kind. In spite of all this, the preceding analy- sis has shown that, as long as one concen- trates on those fragments which have come down to us in their original wording, it is quite possible to determine with consider- able accuracy what the terms voivs and voetv mean in every individual instance; for, though the early philosophers used the terms with many meanings, they al- ways knew exactly what they had in mind. But it is also easy to see that the enormous variety of meanings covered by 186 This is true even of the original meaning of -yv6. and y&amp;-y1vacEtv; for the extended meaning of these terms belongs to a later period. 187 See Part I, CP, XL, 233. 188 See ibid., p. 241. 180 See above, p. 20. 190 See above, P. 30.</page><page sequence="21">32 KURT VON FRITZ the same terms could hardly fail to create a good deal of confusion in the interpreta- tion of early Greek philosophy by later authors, both ancient and modern; for the interpretations attempted by these later authors were naturally conditioned by the specific meanings which the terms vo-vs and voetv acquired in later philosophical systems. The problem was further com- plicated by the fact that Hellenistic phi- losophy replaced the contrast between vous and al-Oqots, which is characteristic of the latest stage of pre-Socratic philos- ophy, by the contrast of Xo'yos and alauGts. Since a complete history of the misin- terpretations caused by this situation could easily fill a book and is therefore outside the scope of the present article, it must suffice to give two illustrations drawn from examples which have already been touched upon. In the philosophy of Theophrastus, who is influenced by Plato and Aristotle, the concept of Po-vs had again been narrowed as against its widest extension in late fifth-century philosophy. Consequently, since Theophrastus, too, thinks in terms of the simple alternative ,ovs and alaOG7tLs, the field of alaO?1aLs is enlarged and covers any perception or un- derstanding of individual objects, quali- ties, or even events, in space and time, whether it be sense-perception in the nar- rower sense or not. Therefore, when he finds that Parmenides ascribes the error which divides reality into the contrasts of warm and cold, etc., to the voos and that Empedocles attributes the perception of love by love and hate by hate also to 4poveTh, he naturally comes to the errone- ous conclusion that these philosophers considered actrG1o-s and voetv or cpovetv as the same thing,19' "or something very similar."'92 Yet if one refers everything 191 De sensu 3 and 10; see also Part I, CP, XL, 240; and above, p. 21, 192 De sensu 10. to his frame of reference, his interpreta- tion does not go completely astray and can still contribute something to an under- standing of the original thought of these philosophers. This is different with Sextus Empiricus, who stubbornly tries to up- hold the identity of Xo6yos and voi3s and, since this identification is quite impossible if one takes X6-yos in the sense which it had acquired in Hellenistic philosophy and vovs in its pre-Socratic meanings, ends in utter confusion.193 During the last few decades the inter- pretation of pre-Socratic philosophy has made very great progress. But it has not overcome the difficulty altogether. This difficulty can be overcome only by a care- ful analysis of the history of the terminol- ogy. The present article is intended to be a first attempt in this direction-an at- tempt, which, like all first attempts, is still very imperfect. In conclusion it is perhaps permissible to make application of the results ob- tained to some special problems which have been omitted from the previous dis- cussion. As pointed out above,94 Gorgias' contention that nothing exists, etc.-if divested of its deliberately paradoxical form-is nothing but a confirmation of Protagoras' opinion that man is the meas- ure of all things and that it makes no sense to speak of something which really exists and which yet is totally different from the world which we experience. If one inter- prets Gorgias' famous work in this way, his second point-that, if something ex- isted, it would not be accessible to our knowledge-is merely a different way of formulating the essential meaning of his first contention. But there is one interest- ing deviation from Protagoras' argumen- tation. He does not, like Protagoras, use sense-perceptions as examples but 4pove^Zv. 193 See Part I, CP, XL, 234f. 194 See p. 24 and Gorgias B3 (Diels).</page><page sequence="22">NOTE, NOEIN, AND THEIR DERIVATIVES 33 He first shows that things which do not exist, for instance, a wagon driven across the sea or monsters like Scylla and Cha- rybdis, are objects of qpoveZv. Then he con- cludes that, since that which is an object of qpovEZv does not exist, that which ex- ists is not an object of qpopEtv. If taken without any further qualification, this is an obvious logical fallacy; and since the Sophists liked to play with their argu- ments, the conclusion was in all likelihood intentionally expressed in this ambiguous form. But if taken as a counterargu- ment against philosophers who, like An- axagoras and Democritus, contended that Protagoras might to some ex- tent be right in what he said about sen- sations like warm and cold but that the cp'v nevertheless did have access to the reality behind the phenomena, it raised a serious difficulty. Democritus has obviously struggled with this difficulty. He tried to overcome it by the theory that even the illusions of a dazed or an insane man were caused by atoms which belong to the "real world," though in a given individual case we could never be quite sure whether the combinations of atoms which provoke a certain image in our mind had come from outside ourselves or had been formed in our intellectual organs or whether, if they came from bodies outside ourselves, these bodies had exactly the structure indicated by the images caused by the atoms ema- nating from them. Yet, he contended, it was always possible within certain limits to draw a conclusion from a sensation to the form of the atoms causing it."'1 On the linguistic side it is perhaps interesting to observe that Gorgias uses 4poVEtV in the sense of "to imagine." He could do so be- cause in the philosophical terminology of his period the synonyms voeZV and 4poVElV "95 See above, p. 28, and the fragment on axxooopOap (A101). covered any intellectual function that was not sense-perception in the narrowest sense of the word. While Gorgias' use of the term 4poVEZV would make it possible to determine with considerable accuracy the time in which he lived, even if we did not know it other- wise, the opposite is true of the most famous of all the sentences in which the word vovis occurs-Epicharmus' vovis opjy KaIL vovs Kov'et1 ra'XXa Kiwa KaL rvOXa.'. Much has been written about his adher- ence to a specific philosophical system as revealed in this sentence. But the preced- ing analysis has shown that, disregarding the Sophists, Protagoras and Gorgias, there was not a philosopher from Xenoph- anes to Democritus who could not have indorsed it, though none of them would probably have done so without adding some further explanation. The sentence is also in harmony with the Homeric con- cept of voOS. It goes beyond Homer only in so far as it requires some philosophi- cal reflection. But that is all that can be said about it. In another instance, however, a defi- nite chronological conclusion of some in- terest can be drawn. An extract from a work of Alexander Polyhistor (who lived in the time of Sulla) in Diog. Laert. viii. 30 says that the Pythagoreans divided the human soul into three parts-OvGos, vovs, and 4pevEs-and contended that OvMbs and vov-s were also found in animals but pSp&amp;-s only in human beings. This attribu- tion of vovs to animals is certainly impos- sible in any philosophy influenced by Platonic thought. But the division is also uninfluenced by the identification of 4poveZV and voeZtv,'9 which is character- 196 B 12 (Diels). 197 The last pre-Socratic philosophers who, within our knowledge, distinguished clearly between '6ov and qSpi are Xenophanes and Heraclitus (see Part I, CP, XL, 229 and 232). The complete synonymity of the two terms can be proved only for the second half of the flfth century.</page><page sequence="23">34 KURT VON FRITZ istic of Greek philosophy in the second half of the fifth century, and by the dis- tinction of vovis and ao sats. It is, on the other hand, in perfect agreement with Homeric terminology; for an animal can certainly have v6os in the sense of the abil- ity to realize, for instance, the danger of a situation, while it may not be credited with rational action, which is the function of the pcpves in Homer. All this, together with the fact that the terms cp'v and pcpcsYS disappear from Greek prose after the first half of the fourth century, shows that it is hardly possible to place the ori- gin of the doctrine later than the first half of the fifth century. It follows that Alexander's account, even though some of its parts show the influence of later philosophical terminology, does contain elements of genuine early Pythagorean doctrine and is not so worthless as Zel- ler and many other scholars have as- sumed. A fortiori, it follows that Pythagorean philosophy was not entirely the invention of early Platonists and late Greek mystics, as some scholars seem to believe. COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY</page></plain_text>
