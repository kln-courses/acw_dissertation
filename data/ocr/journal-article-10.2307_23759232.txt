The Schokoladenmuseum Köln (Chocolate Museum Cologne, Germany) was founded by Dr. Hans Imhoff in 1993 and since then exhibits an outstanding collection of Pre-Colum bian objects that were acquired on the international art market in order to illustrate the history of chocolate to a general au dience (Durry and Schiffer 2008). Currently, the museum is preparing a new exhibition concept for the Ancient America section that will be launched in 2012. Although the Schoko ladenmuseum counts as one of the most popular museums in Germany, two Maya polychrome vessels in the collec tion (Inv.-Nr. 50058 and 50008, see Front- and Backcover of the current issue) have never been published nor properly described before. Therefore, a brief epigraphic and stylistic analysis of these two masterpieces of Classic Maya pottery is presented here. By doing so, it is not our intention to present an in-depth study of their texts and imagery, but to make them available to the academic community for the time being. Frontcover: A Late Classic cylindrical cacao-drinking vessel (Inv. No. 50003) The first ceramic vessel (Inv.-No. 50003, see Frontcover, Fig. 1) is of cylindrical shape and remarkable dimensions (27 cm in height and 12 cm in diameter). It has been glued together and partially restored (Fig. 5b), but the painting of the vessel remains in its original state, as does the dedication text that is painted in black and red on the surface beneath the upper rim. Around the lower part circulates a frieze consisting of alternating black K'AN signs and doubled dots. These rep resent the dark waters of the netherworld and the night sky, a location where the event depicted in the central scene was thought to have taken place during times of creation in the mythical past. Painted on a black background, two identical scenes are showing a heron or rather an egret (possibly the Great White- or Snowy Egret) fishing. The egret is one of several manifestations of the deity dubbed Gl, a hybrid figure whose anthropomorphic head is shown here merged into the chest of the bird. As several scholars have argued convinc ingly, the egret motif is related to episodes in the Popol Vuh story of the Hero Twins and the omnipresent theme of the transformation of the Maize God (cf. Taube 1985, Quenon and LeFort 1995, Grofe 2003, Martin 2006). The wings of the birds are adorned with 'Ek' "Star" signs giving a hint to the astronomical aspect of Gl as the Venus (as Morningstar?). On other vessels showing the egret motif the "Venus"-sign is substituted by the earflares of this deity; similar representa tions of Gl wearing an egret-headdress and "starry-earflares" once decorated also the facade of Temple 22 at Copan (von Schwerin 2011). The cylindrical vessel of the Schokoladenmuseum is surely the most elegantly painted example of its kind known so far. In contrast to other comparable vessels showing the egret motif as well as water friezes and a black background, the vessel at Cologne bears a legible dedicatory text instead of the pseudo-glyphs that regularly occur on vessels with this theme (e.g. K8538, K6609, K6438, K6181/5082, Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología de Guatemala, Inv. No 13.705, Hellmuth 1981: 174, Fig. 351-53, Fig. 53, Muñoz Cosme et al. 1999: 193, Finamore and Houston 2009: 104). The dedicatory text of vessel 50003 (Fig. 2) consists of thirteen hieroglyphs that are painted with black outlines and characteristic details rendered in red. Our transliteration, tran scription and interpretation of the text follow as: 'a-'AL-ya K'AL-ja 'u tz'i-b'i na-ja yu-k'i-b'i IXIM? ka [CHAK]? ch'o-[ko?] K'AK'?-K'AN-na ke-LE'M 'alay k'ahlaj 'u-tz'ihb 'najaly-uk'ib'ixim(te 'e)l? kaka(w) chak ch 'ok k 'a(h)k "?-k 'an kele 'm "this is it: the painting of the drinking vessel for iximte 'el? cacao of the great youth K 'ahk'? K 'an? Kele'm was wrapped/ presented" Some epigraphic remarks are advisable here. The word kakaw "cacao" is written in an abbreviated form with a sin gle full figure variant of the ka syllable. Due to the damage in Position J, it is not clear which sign precedes "cacao". It might be a corrupted version of the common specification for cacao beverage spelt 'IXIM-TE'-le 'ixiimte'el "(cacao) fla voured with the 'ixiimte'plant". Alternatively, the sign under discussion might be the ta syllable resulting in ta kakaw "for ? cacao" or yu-[ta] resulting in yuta [I] kakaw "fruity cacao" (Beliaev et al. 2010: 258-60). The last glyph of the text is certainly ke-LE'M "youth" attested exclusively as a part of the chak ch'ok kele'm "great youth" title elsewhere. What seems to be CHAK? ch'o-ko? chak ch 'ok is separated from the ke-LE'M glyph by a glyphic compound ?-K'AN-na. Due to the strict formula of dedicatory texts on ceramic vessels, Vol. XXXIII • April 2011</page><page sequence="3">dedicatory text in black and red, a black back ground, as well as the egret motif incorporated in yet another complex mythological scene related to the decay and emergence of the young Maize God. This vessel mentions a member of the Mutu 7 (Tikal) nobility in a secondary text. More black background vessels are known from Tikal and its vicinity, pointing to the Central Peten as a likely origin of the vessel in question. The motif mentioned above, showing repeating black K'AN signs, is also too common in Classic Maya art in order to be used for assigning the vessel to a specific geographic region. Backcover: The cacao-drinking vessel of the 37th ruler of Naranjo (Schokoladenmuseum Köln, Inv. No. 50058) Fig. 1 Inv. No. 50003, Schokoladenmuseum Köln, additional views The vessel dePicted on the reverse side of the (Photos by Guido Krempel 2010) current mexicon issue (Inv. No. 50058, see also Fig.3) is an orange-slipped ceramic bowl with outstanding walls measuring 10.1 cm in height, 22.2 cm in ABC D diameter at the upper rim and 17.3 cm in diameter at the base. It is decorated with two circular lines - a black line on the up per rim and a red one underneath. Additionally, the interior of the vessel is supplied with two parallel bands in red. Despite some superficial erosion, the painting of the vessel remains in excellent condition, and fortunately, the glyphs have not been retouched during its restoration; only a few cracks were filled and one of them was slightly overpainted thereafter (Fig. 4, Position D). The exterior surface bears a dedicatory inscrip tion consisting of fifteen hieroglyphic blocks that are painted with a fluid black colour as evidenced by some blurs of colour that dripped from the brush of the scribe during the painting process. The creative and elegant line of the calligraphy sug gests that it was the work of a highly skilled artist. The text Fig. 2 Inv. No. 50003, dedicatory formula terminates with four vertically arranged dots that serve to (Drawing by Guido Krempel 2011) mark its beginning and end (e.g. K5746). Our transliteration, transcription and interpretation of the text follow as: we are forced to interpret this glyphic compound as a per sonal name. However, a personal name cannot tear a titular 'a-'AL-ya yi-cha T'AB'[-yi] 'u tz'i|-b'a|-li yu-k'i-b'i ta? sequence apart, but it can function as an independent noun. ka CHAK ch'o ko? K'AK' ...-wa CHAN-na CHAHK 4 The best solution we can offer momentarily is to consider the "END OF THE INSCRIPTION" whole sequence, ?-K'AN-na ke-LE'M, as a personal name. An adjective in Mayan languages cannot appear in an isolated 'alayy-ich-a[l] t 'ab 'aay 'u-tz'ihb 'aaly-uk'ib 'ta ka[kaw] chak position and thus the word k 'an "yellow, precious, ripe" writ- ch'ok? k'ahk'...? chart chaahk ten before ke-LE'M favours the interpretation proposed. A tentative translation of the personal name ? K'an Kele'm can "this is its surface (of the vessel): the decoration of the drink be "? Yellow Turkey Rooster", cf. LL+WM *keleem "young, ing vessel for cacao for the great youth K 'ahk' ? Chan Chaahk strong, rooster" (Kaufman 2003). However, the semantics was raised" and literal meaning of ? k'an keleem remains elusive. The possibility remains that ?-K'AN-na is part of the title chak The distinctive writing of the artist necessitates a brief ch 'ok ? k'an kelem, referring to the recipient of the vessel as explanation of each hieroglyphic block. The text starts with "strong youth, very? virile? youth". In this case, the name of the ubiquitous Introductory Glyph at position A. Its phonetic the owner would be entirely omitted in this dedicatory text. reading 'alay is well established, but its literal meaning still The exact provenance of the vessel is yet difficult to remains elusive. We make use of a contextual translation determine because none of the known comparable vessels based on a unique substitution for the Introductory Glyph of similar shape and style were found in archaeological Äa7'"this is" (K1728). Aunique yi-cha spelling (B) follows context. A vessel (K3033) exhibited in the Museo Popol Vuh, the Introductory Glyph. We suggest that this is a variant of Guatemala (MPV0368, MS0740, Reents-Budet 1994: 274, the collocation commonly attested as yi-chi, yi-chi-li and hi Chinchilla Mazariegos 2011: 19), bears a similar bichrome chi. Once again, the exact meaning ofy-ich is unknown, but mexicon • Vol. XXXIII • April 2011 Fig. 1 Inv. No. 50003, Schokoladenmuseum Köln, additional views (Photos by Guido Krempel 2010) B C »«3l E F G H | Fig. 2 Inv. No. 50003, dedicatory formula (Drawing by Guido Krempel 2011)</page><page sequence="4">Fig. 3 Inv. No. 50058, Schokoladenmuseum Köln, additional views (Photos by Carlos Pallan and Guido Krempel 2011) the translation "surface (of the vessel)" proposed by Barbara MacLeod (1990: 161) works well in the given context. The yi-chi-li spelling not only contains the 3rd person ergative pronouny- "his", but also the -il inalienable possession suffix suggesting that the Ancient Maya considered the "surface" as inseparable part of "the vessel", resulting in an independent noun. Nikolai Grube (pers. comm. 2011) has pointed to us that jich always follows after the dedicatory verb t 'ab 'aay "it appeared, came about, got raised" whereas yich usu ally follows after another dedicatory verb k'ahlaj "it was wrapped/presented". Furthermore, an unpossessed form hi/ji-chi is found after other verbal forms, such as tz 'ihb 'naj "it was painted" and GOD.N-na-ja t'ab 'naj? "it was raised?" (K1080). Thus, we like to suggest that the unpossessed form is attested only after passive forms. The disharmonic spelling yi-cha hints at a complex vowel suggesting a vernacular gloss *hiich for the otherwise widely used term *-ich "surface". It is tempting to suggest that the unique spelling combined with its unusual syntactic position hints at an underspelled suffix that indicates a kind of derivation. It might be the -VI inalienable possessive suffix or, alternatively, the -aal suffix of nouns derived from nouns with subtle change of meaning such as for example tz 'ihb 'aal "ornamentation, decoration", derived from tz 'ihb' "painting, writing", or 'ik 'aal "spirit" derived from 'ik'"wind" (Lacadena 2004: 188). Due to the syntactic change attested we opt for the former interpretation. The common dedicatory verb t'ab 'aay "it came about, got raised" (C) is written with a commonly used ligature of the Fig. 4 Inv. No. 50058, dedicatory formula (Drawing by Guido Krempel 2011) signs: T'AB' and yi. The sequence'u-tz'ihb'aaly-uk'ib' ta? ka(kaw) (D-H) is auto-referential to the vessel and its "deco ration" and describes its function as a "drinking vessel for cacao". The ta-syllable and the ka-syllable are put together resulting in an intricate ligature (H), (compare to e.g. K4562, K2704, K5042, K5746). The word kakaw "cacao" is written with a full-figure variant of the phonetic sign ka representing a "fish" (Stuart 1988), cf. proto-Mayan *kay "fish" (Kaufman and Justeson 2003). Nevertheless, the bowl-like shape of the vessels leads us to conclude that it was not solely used for cacao, but likely contained more viscous beverages (Houston, Stuart and Taube 1989). Bowls of similar shape are known to have contained mixed cacao-beverages such as 'uul kakaw "atole cacao" and kakawal 'uul "chocolaty atole", which are to be sipped (Robiscek and Hales 1981: Table lc, Grube 1991: 230, Stuart 2006, Helmke 2009: 625-634, Beliaev et al. 2010). The sign "skull with a leaf in front" has independently been recognized and deciphered by Erik Boot (2009) and Stephen Houston (Houston et al. 2009: 30-31) as a logograph for CHAK "red, great, strong". This CHAK sign, depicting a "skull with a leaf in front" often appears on vessels stylisti cally affiliated with El Zotz, Tikal, Naranjo, Caracol, Nebaj and Altun Ha. Nevertheless, a seemingly unique version of the sign, showing a "human head with a leaf in front" (e.g. K4976), is attested on the vessel presented here (I). A unique version of the ch'o syllable (J) depicts a "head of a mouse looking out of its hole". The word ch 'o' refers to various species of rodents (Hunn 1977: 207-213). Be yond doubt, it is the common chak ch 'ok "great youth" title (Houston 2009), but the commonly employed ko syllable is absent. Instead, the scribe painted a "human head whose ear is plugged with a kind of flower" (K). This sign can be a substitution for the common syllable ko to indicate the final sound of the word ch 'ok. It is tempting to suggest that the syllabic value of the sign is derived from the word for "sordo, deaf' pM *ko 'hk attested in many Lowland Maya languages (Kaufman and Justeson 2003). We wonder if the flower covering the ear is in fact a variant of T173 MIH/mi "nothing", indicating an inability of the deaf to hear. A similar iconic pattern is attested in the logographic sign for "mute, stranger?, prophet?", which is a main constituent of the Rio Azul emblem glyph. The latter depicts a human head, whose mouth is plugged with what can be understood as either a Vol. XXXIII • April 2011</page><page sequence="5">kind of flower or as a foamy substance. Its probable reading realization xiiw. This text describes the impersonation of two is NU "N "mute" as the frequent initial phonetic complement symbolically related deities named "white xiiw tuun" and nu leads to suggest (Zender 1999). A word reconstructed as "black xiiw tuun", referring to the bearers of the throne in pM *nuum~*nuun "dumb, mute, unable to speak" is widely the watery Underworld (Martin 2007: footnotes 23,40).

However, Grube (2010) notes sign might be the logograph XIW "fright, fear", as has been that initial phonetic complements that are neither vocals nor proposed by Nikolai Grube (pers. comm.

The ko syllable might be omitted here be another option as is the case for the syllable xi, derived by some other reason. Thus, the sign depicting a human head from the mentioned templates; in any case, this sign surely may alternatively depict an unusual variant of the logograph deserves a more detailed study that must remain for another KELE 'M "young" for chak ch 'ok kele'm, a widespread ver- occasion. The sequence xi-wa is part of a nominal phrase that sion of the "great youth" title. This interpretation is promising belongs to a pattern of personal names that were in particular as well, since the sign in question actually depicts a "head popular in the royal dynasty of Naranjo. The pattern is K'ahk' of a youth".

No. MPV0457, Museo Popol Vuh, Gua temala (Photo by Karl Herbert Mayer 1978) had been carved and placed at Caracol and which was later dismantled by the invaders. One fragment was transported to Ucanal and others were partially incorporated in Structure II IS at Naranjo (Scheie and Freidel 1990: 187-193,206, Grube 2004: 198, Martin and Grube 2008: 73, Lucía Gámez 2004). The patron of this building and the vessel presented here, K'ahk'...? Chan Chaahk, finally succumbed to his life-long enemy Caracol, supported by the mighty Kaanu'l dynasty of Calakmul (Martin and Grube 2008: 95). The bowl can be identified as a Saxche Orange-poly chrome vessel (Smith and Gifford 1966, Gifford 1976, Gif ford and Kirkpatrick 1996: 126-27). This ceramic type was widespread throughout the Central Maya Lowlands at the transition period between the Early Classic and Late Classic Period. At Tikal, Saxche Orange Polychrome ware marked the Ik ceramic complex (AD 550-700) and was presented in Burial 195 attributed to K'ihnich Waaw (AD 562 - ca. 630) (Culbert 1993: Fig. 50-51). Further to the west, Saxche Orange ceramics were likewise produced for the nobility of Namaan (La Florida, Guatemala) in the Upper Usumacinta Valley. As such, vessels of the same type, decorated with a simple dedicatory text, framed by a black rim and a parallel red line, were hallmarks of the Namaan-dynasty at La Florida where this pottery style was produced from the late 6th until the 8th century (Lopes 2003, Jorgensen and Krempel in prep.). Ceramic sherds of this type were also found in archaeological context at several archaeological sites throughout the central Maya Lowlands (Adams 1963, Ball 1977, Smith and Gifford 1959, 1973, 1976, Culbert 1993, Muñoz 2003, 2006, Golden et al. 2008). Based on these contexts the type can be dated to AD 560-620 (at Piedras Negras) and to between AD 550-700 (in western Belize) and thus generally matches the assumed lifetime of K'ahk'...? Chan Chaahk. Vessels of related Or ange-polychrome types were dedicated to members of the Pa'chan (El Zotz-Uaxactun, Smith 1955: Figs. 7f-i) and the Mutu'l (Tikal and Dos Pilas) dynasty. Another Saxche Or ange-polychrome barrel-shaped vessel from La Florida finds its counterpart in an import found at Zaculeu, far distant in the southern Highlands (Woodbury and Trik 1953: 193-94, 429, Fig. 265s, Jorgensen and Krempel in prep.). In the case of K'ahk'...? Chan Chaahk s vessel discussed here, we lack any archaeological context and similar vessels attributed to Naranjo are unknown. Nevertheless, also related in style are various Palmar Orange ware ceramics which were dedicated to his forebearer 4/ Wosaj Chan K'ihnich. These were found in special deposits at the Central Acropolis of Naranjo (Fi alko 2008: 59-63, Figs. 47a-d) and atTikal (e.g. in Str. 5G-8, Scheie and Freidel 1990: 191, Culbert 1993: Fig. 42c). This leads to the conclusion that preceding generations of Tikal and Naranjo rulers were already in close contact from the late 6th century onwards (compare Scheie and Freidel 1990:191). This early ceramic tradition can be regarded as a precursor of the ceramic type discussed here. Thus, it is not surpris ing to find similar ceramic styles at both sites one and two generations later. Due to the lack of monumental inscriptions from the reign of the 36th and 37th rulers of Naranjo (Grube 2004, Tokovinine 2007), this particular ceramic style associ ated with K'ahk'...? Chan Chaahk sheds new light on the blurry history of Naranjo during the "hiatus" period. It has long been known that with the arrival of Lady Six Sky and the reign of her son K'ahk' Tihliiw Chan Chaahk a new dynastic line was founded at Naranjo. It seems that not only the rul ing elite became replaced thereafter, but also the preceding ceramic traditions associated with "Aj Wosaj" and his suc cessors abruptly ended as a logical consequence of dynastic changeover. This corresponds to the apparent destruction of monumental inscription of K'ahk'...? Chan Chaahk, in the aftermath of the lost battles against Caracol (Grube 2004: 198-200). Most likely the bowl of K'ahk'...? Chan Chaahk, as others, was looted from Naranjo or its close vicinity for it is known that the illicit art market was flooded by stolen goods from the eastern and northeastern Lowlands. Naranjo in par ticular was severely looted in the 1980s and 1990s (Quintana 2004). A vessel in the Museo Popol Vuh, Guatemala, is strik ingly similar in shape and decoration (MPV0457, Fig. 6). It bears pseudo-glyphs on the interior rim and a central scene showing a ball-playing jaguar. It is not only the characteristic style of the glyphs that resembles comparable vessels dedicat ed to the 35th ruler of Naranjo, Aj Wosaj. Anthropomorphic jaguars playing ball-game, dancing and taking part at feast ing and enema-rituals are also a major theme of the ceramic workshops from Naranjo and Tikal of that time. It can be assumed that both orange slipped bowls with black-and-red designs originate from the very same workshop.
