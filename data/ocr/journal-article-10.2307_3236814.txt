For example, dominant plant species in two of the chaparral communities [chamise (Rosaceae) and manzanita (Ericaceae)] he discusses do not have water-impermeable seed (or fruit) coats (Baskin &amp; Baskin 1998). Neither the Olympic, Cascade, nor Siskiyou-Klamath moun- tains are included on the map of montane forests in Ch. 9, and they are not discussed in the text. Yet, the vegetation of the Black Hills receives considerable attention. A discussion of these mountain ranges would have been a good place to cover vegetation and endemism of the ultramafic rock outcrop-soil complex of the Pacific Northwest, especially California. The map of the Temper- ate Rain Forest in Ch. 10 shows this vegetation type extending along the Pacific Coast from the Gulf of Alaska almost as far south as San Francisco Bay. Thus, it includes most of the Coastal Redwood Zone, and extends much further south than shown on some other broad-scale vegetation maps. For example, Kirk &amp; Frankland (1992) show this vegetation type extending from the Gulf of Alaska to the Olympic Peninsula of Washington. In Ch. 10, Bolen uses a minimum size of 1 m DBH and a minimum age of 200 yr as suitable standards for defining old-growth. This may not be sufficient for forests of the Pacific Northwest where this age is &gt; 200 yr. All this said, I still think Bolen has written an excellent book for introducing undergraduates to the biomes of North America north of Mexico. Thus, I recommend it for use as a text in courses that present a broad survey of the ecology of the USA and Canada. Such a course definitely would broaden the "...exposure [of undergraduates] to the natural world in which they live" . The book also would be an appropriate one for ecologists in other parts of the world to read for a general overview of the main vegetation types of the USA and Canada and of some of the interesting organism-environment interac- tions that occur within them.

Price USD 59.95. This unique volume details what is known of the vegeta- tion of the Pacific islands from New Guinea and western Melanesia to eastern Melanesia, Micronesia, the whole of Polynesia and Micronesia down to such remote islands as Pitcairn and Henderson. The Kermadecs and Cook Islands are covered but not New Zealand itself. Treatment is at the indi- vidual island level. The book is the culmination of the lifetime work of the two great Pacific botanists Dieter Mueller-Dombois and F. Raymond Fosberg. The length (733 pages) and number of references are monumental. The outline of the book was drawn up as long ago as 1935. In later years the authors came together four times a year to work on the book - until Ray's untimely death in 1993. I have been reviewing this book for some weeks because I keep on wanting to refer back to it, again and again, becoming submerged in the geology and botany of the different and legendary islands. Of course I am a Pacific island freak. But this book tells me everything I want to know about every one of those distant and remote specks scattered over the Pacific, most so small that they barely show up on maps and bear bizarre names. It is not often that a monograph is sufficiently lucid to be bedtime reading; it attests to the authors meeting their objectives of achieving an appropriate level of generali- zation. As a monograph, this volume is thoroughly up to date on geology, botany, archaeology, and human history of each island. Many islands, of course, were never adequately sur- veyed before the onset of anthropomorphic change. For many the field notes of Ray Fosberg, made during a brief wartime or later visit, are the only information available. Brought home is the incredible physiographic and botani- cal diversity of the Pacific islands, one of the world's great evolutionary centers. A couple of hundred excellent color photos (mostly 9 x 6 cm) provide the reader with a vivid exposure of the individual islands. One thus acquires a close acquaintanceship with remote Ducie Atol, where the only plant is Tournefortia, and the incredible richness and diversity of New Guinea, along with the archaic Gondwanan vegetation of New Caledonia. One learns of the biology of that beautiful strandline plant the Horsetail Casuarina, of the methods of dispersal of seaborne colonizers, the climatic conditions that cause mountain-top dwarfing, the edaphic basis of New Cal- edonian plant communities, the climatic basis of temperature and rainfall elevational zones, and of seasonality. On the debit side it is depressing to learn just how much anthropogenic change there has been throughout the Pacific. For example, the major Micronesian islands of Sapian and Tinian were largely converted to sugar cane by the Japanese, this change being superimposed on those earlier inflicted by the native antecedents. The authors do their best to deduce what original forests were like. Today coconut palms, breadfruit, mangos and other exotics (to name a few) grow in the lowlands of most islands. High rugged hinterlands may support sections, or vestiges, of the 318</page><page sequence="2">Book reviews original vegetation, sometimes secondarily degraded. Slopes often support thickets of native trees and shrubs. Patterns of regrowth following clear-felling are documented. There is first a luxurious growth of herbaceous weeds, then the appear- ance of scrub patches, and subsequently, secondary forest thickets. Such stages can be seen on some islands when agriculture ceases to be profitable. Probably much of the degradation is irreversible. Yet there are some cases of re- storative success, e.g., of such islands as Lord Howe and the Kermadecs. A final chapter is devoted to the future of island vegeta- tion. Attempts are made to predict and quantify end point effects stemming from increased human occupation. In summary, this book is a remarkably complete reference to the climate, origins, history, and botany of the Pacific islands. It sums up the state of current knowledge, making available overviews and botanical detail hitherto unavailable. It will be a basic reference for anybody working on the Pacific islands, or involved in the conservation of island ecosystems. Yet, despite this it is highly readable. Many thanks Dieter and Ray, and to Annette Muller-Dombois to whose technical dedication the authors express special gratitude.

Conserving the sacred for biodiversity management. xxviii + 480 pp. Science Publishers Inc., Enfield, NH. ISBN 1-57808-036-3. Price: USD 79.-. The stated purpose of this book is to provide a synthesis of the current state-of-the-art regarding sacred groves. It contains papers presented at a UNESCO Regional Workshop on the Role of Sacred Groves in Conservation and Management of Biological Diversity held in Kerala, India, 8-11 December, 1997. The Preface outlines a very ambitious objective of covering the ecological, religious, sociocultural and economic aspects of sacred groves. Perhaps, part of the problem I had with this book is that this broad scope does not allow the book to properly address the main topic. One would have hoped to lear from the numerous case studies (25 of the 37 papers) about how the past management of areas as sacred groves resulted in islands of biodiversity within a matrix of environ- ments under heavy human impact. Unfortunately, the defini- tion of sacred groves accepted in this book seems to be very broad, both temporally and spatially; it includes areas very recently set aside and those that had been designated as sacred for centuries; there are areas ranging in size from a cluster of a few trees to several hectares. This extreme variation in dura- tion and size, as well as in the extent of protection afforded to them and the nature of the surrounding areas (urban to more remote mountain tops), makes it difficult to see how the designation of sacred grove is, in itself, the most important factor in the biodiversity found in these areas. The papers appear not to have been proofread or edited to any extent. The book has not only numerous typos and spell- ing errors but also grammatical mistakes such as incomplete sentences. Even sentences that were grammatically correct were often difficult to comprehend (e.g. "One result of un- checked globalization has been that many forms of local idiosyncrasy including dwelt-in sacred geographies are inexo- rably challenged by an economicist planetary perspective which propounds a uniform conceptualisation of land and resources according to standardised topographic or statistical coordinates."; p. 47). The book may, perhaps, be of interest to readers who delve into deep ecology ("Ecology needs a lan- guage which the philosophers, poets and prophets know. Lan- guage is a body, a part of oneself. There cannot be a real representation of the ancient thoughts of sages in another body. What is provided in the following pages is an imitation of imitation."; p. 31). However, it will not be appreciated by many vegetation scientists or ecologists. Kiyoko Miyanishi, Department of Geography, University of Guelph, Guelph, ON N1G 2W1, Canada.

Price: USD 56.- (paperback); xx USD (cloth). Joost: graag even checken There is a fine tradition in Sweden of publishing dedicated volumes in honour of retiring professors of botany. Swedish professors who recently have been saluted in this way are Gunnar Harling (1987), Olov Hedberg (Friis et al. 1993), and now Eddy van der Maarel, who so successfully has possessed the Chair of Ecological Botany in Uppsala until 1999. At the occasion of both the retirement of professor van der Maarel, and the need of an updated review of Swedish plant geogra- phy, a group of vegetation ecologists decided to write a completely new book about the distribution and ecology of Swedish vegetation. As the editors state, the book is intended to be introductory, mainly targeting students, teachers, nature conservationists and ecologists, needing a source book for further reading. This volume indeed brings together a significant collec- tion of papers dealing with terrestrial, limnic and marine vegetation ecology, covered in 12 Chapters. It deals with background abiotic factors such as geology and climate, and separate descriptions of the major habitat types, e.g. deciduous and coniferous forests, alpine and subalpine vegetation, mires, anthropogenic landscapes, rivers and streams, lakes, sea shores, and marine and brackish waters. Most usefully, also an index of all mentioned taxa, and Latin-Swedish, and Swedish-Latin indexes are given, as well as to subjects covered in the text. The chapters generally deal with causal relationships of the vegetation rather than long and tedious descriptions of plant communities, and thus largely follow the current Nordic main tradition in vegetation science, namely to understand the 319</page></plain_text>
