<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mapping the Sea Change: Postcolonialism, MODERNSIM AND LANDSCAPE IN JEAN RhYS'S VOYAGE IN the Dark Kerry Johnson My purpose here is to discuss the ways in which postcolonial space inhabits modernist aesthetics. More specifically, I discuss the way Jean Rhys's writing maps landscape as a space that resists the gender, race, and class exclusions of the nation- state. These points are inextricably intertwined with the fact that Rhys holds a peculiar place among modernist writers - the interstitial position of a woman perceived as a "marginal" writer, not quite West Indian, not quite English - and by examining her work I wish to achieve an analysis of modernism that makes it impossible to deny the constitutive force of postcoloniality. When taking into account the narrative techniques Rhys used as well as the socio-cultural milieu in which she wrote, I believe we can see a more precise picture of modernism as it encompasses an aesthetic practice in addition to a historical period. Both elements, I believe, are tied to the fall of the British Empire and its aftermath.1 The debates about Rhys's status as a colonial and whether or not she can even be called "a Caribbean writer" have emphasized her liminal position to reveal a writer highly aware of the intersections of race, gender, class, and colony.2 As these intersections are particularly apparent in Rhys's constant focus on landscape in her work, it becomes evident that she is a writer sensitive to the struggles of articulating representations of both imperial and colonized space, struggles that have been ignored in many accounts of modernist aesthetics. We must attend to these representations in order to fully comprehend the enormous impact that postcolonial writers from the colonies had on what we have come to know as "modernism."3 A significant element of the modernist aesthetic - one central to the concerns of postcolonial writers - has been overlooked in modernist criticism and that element is spatial representation. Fredric Jameson's analytics of space is an important exception to this critical oversight and provides a point of departure for my argument. Jameson describes a space that defines British modernism with a gap or absence that has everything to do with the colonies across the water. He writes of the disjunction between "absent space and daily life in the metropolis" and argues in a passage I think helpful to quote at length that [ . . . ] daily life and existential experience in the metropolis - which is necessarily the very content of the national literature itself - can now no longer be grasped immanently [by citizens of the imperial nation]; it no longer has its meaning, its deeper reason for being, within itself. As artistic content it will now henceforth always have something missing about it, but in the sense of</page><page sequence="2">48 Journal of Caribbean Literatures privation that can never be restored or made whole simply by adding back in the missing component: its lack is rather comparable to another dimension, an outside like the other face of a mirror, which it constitutively lacks, and which can never be made up or made good. This new and historically original problem in what is itself a new kind of content now constitutes the situation and the problem and the dilemma, the formal contradiction, that modernism seeks to solve; or better still, it is only that new kind of art which reflexively perceives this problem and lives this formal dilemma that can be called modernist in the first place. (51) Rhys's characters represent this Jamesonian spatial gap - that which can never be "made good," that which is missing, a postcolonial woman. As her characters are "inbetween,"4 English national identity is refracted through their understanding of their daily experience of English landscape. By writing from the point of view of the outsider, from the source of the "lack" as Jameson puts it, Rhys creates alternate cartographies of landscape and urban space. As I discuss below, in Voyage in the Dark, the relationship chorus girl Anna Morgan has with the landscape, as she moves through places where she shouldn't be (the city streets at night) and over land that is revealed to be tame and contained (the countryside when she is on tour), reveals a resistance to the fixed spatial boundaries of the Enclosure movements, to the maps that "legitimize the reality of conquest and empire" (Harley 282), and to the consolidation of English national identity. Further, I would argue that Rhys's representations of urban space, including the London landscape that Anne McClintock has revealed to be a feminized space in terms of its intersections with the working class crowds and poverty-stricken slums, is Rhys's way of foregrounding a woman's experience of the metropolitan center. McClintock writes that Emile Zola, Sigmund Freud, and Charles Baudelaire, all "men on the cusp of modernism," "sought the site of their first knowledge and self- discovery" - their childhood nurses - by turning to the "prostitutes, servants and actresses who served as their mistresses, muses and models" in the city, and from there it was a quick step into projecting "the female body onto the modern city as its first shape." McClintock argues further that "the city, as the first space of modern self-knowledge, was mapped as a feminine space" because "[o]nce feminized, the city was more easily represented and made docile for male knowledge and power" (82). Yet Rhys's narrative resists the male gaze, and the projections of the female body onto the city, by relating one dispossessed woman's experience ofthat city. Resisting English National Identity Anna Morgan constantly comments on the grey, cold towns she visits on tour, implying a contrast to the warmth and color of her Caribbean home, and by listing the names of certain streets, she points to the hierarchical class system that binds all of England:</page><page sequence="3">Mapping the Sea Change 49 After a while I got used to England and I liked it all right; I got used to everything except the cold and that the towns we went to always looked so exactly alike. You were perpetually moving to another place which was perpetually the same. There was always a little grey street leading to the stage-door of the theatre and another little grey street where your lodgings were, and rows of little houses with chimneys like the funnels of dummy steamers of smoke the same colour as the sky; and a grey stone promenade running hard, naked and straight by the side of the grey-brown or grey-green sea; or a Corporation Street or High Street or Duke Street or Lord Street where you walked about and looked at the shops. (8) Anna calls attention to the rigid class system by contrasting her experience of the bleak town- and cityscapes with the street names that indicate upper class ownership and commerce. In fact, she represents the other side of the English landscape tradition that helped consolidate the nation-state, the side that instead reveals the dispossession and alienation that occurs in the long aftermath of the Renaissance Enclosure movement. This movement, which disenfranchised the peasants and consolidated power in the landowning class, also consolidated the English nation and helped formulate property owners' sense of "national" identity while it fueled British imperialism. In fact, as W. J.T. Mitchell points out, recent work on landscape painting places the "English landscape movement in the context of the enclosure of common fields and the dispossession of the English peasantry" (5). This movement reveals that while imperial expansion into land beyond the horizon in the form of the colonies was crucial to the formation of an English national identity, the domestic policy of fixing peasants and rural workers in their place and seizing their land also contributed to such an identity. Since landscape painting has clearly been an important way for England to imagine itself as a nation - because it is deeply implicated in the imperial project of expansion as it forces the gaze beyond the horizon, and because of the way it addresses viewers as property owners or those who wish to become part of the property owning class - it is crucial for understanding the ways in which it has been rewritten in postcolonial texts. As W.J.T. Mitchell explains, These semiotic features of landscape, and the historical narratives they generate, are tailor-made for the discourse of imperialism, which conceives itself precisely (and simultaneously) as an expansion of landscape understood as an inevitable, progressive development in history, an expansion of "culture" and "civilization" into a "natural" space in a progress that is itself narrated as "natural." Empires move outward in space as a way of moving forward in time; the "prospect" that opens up is not just a spatial</page><page sequence="4">50 Journal of Caribbean Literatures scene but a projected future of "development" and exploitation. And this movement is not confined to the external, foreign fields toward which empire directs itself; it is typically accompanied by a renewed interest in the re-presentation of the home landscape, the "nature" of the imperial center. (17) Landscape representation was mainly a genre of painting, but Mitchell goes on to point out that the tradition existed in essays, poems, and fiction. Thus re-writing and revision of the imperial landscape is a major concern for someone like Rhys, as a woman and as a postcolonial subject. Her representation of it in England - as alive, as threatening and cold - rewrites the landscape tradition that inculcated viewers into the imagined English nation. Elizabeth Helsinger points out that this tradition was crucial for the development of England's identity as a nation-state when she states, "The aesthetics of landscape, and the activities of viewing and displaying English places through which it was experienced, created for those who could participate in it a claim on England as their national aesthetic property" (105). To undermine such representation is an important point of resistance for any postcolonial writer, but particularly for a woman writer. Anna Morgan's experience of the English countryside, then, underscores the reality of the Enclosure movement. Instead of looking out on the vast, rolling pastures and hills of the picturesque landscape, she instead sees a series of exactly measured parcels of land, not romantic or awe-inspiring, but limiting and significantly, indicative of the white imperial "race": . . . This is England Hester said and I watched it through the train-window divided into squares like pocket-handkerchiefs; a small tidy look it had everywhere fenced off from everywhere else . . . hundreds thousands of white people white people rushing along and the dark houses all alike frowning down one after the other all alike stuck together - the streets like smooth shut-in ravines and the dark houses frowning down [...]. (17) These spaces are enclosed, carefully contained and divided; as I will discuss below, they are closely connected to the containment of female sexuality and unlike the openness of Anna's Caribbean homeland as she recalls it. Significantly, whiteness and the power associated with it also signify enclosure, while the dark houses are threateningly alive. As I discuss below, Rhys's sense of objects as living things, as the houses are described here, is an example of the lack of boundaries between the living and the dead, a transferrai of the vodun possession beyond the body to include "dead" objects and materials. In England, these "living" objects are dangerous, indicating what she perceives to be a vengeful environment. It is in Anna's perceptions of these objects that Afro-Caribbean vodun and obeah influences are again subtly evident. While such rituals are more obviously part of Wide Sargasso Sea, in Voyage in the Dark they form a necessary context for analyzing such objects</page><page sequence="5">Mapping the Sea Change 5 1 and for seeing the ways in which Rhys underscores the threat these components of the landscape really pose. As Rhys mentions walls throughout Voyage in the Dark, she again emphasizes the state of enclosure. At one point, Anna lies in her room, and even trying to think makes it seem that she is "face to face with a high, dark wall" (141). Wondering if she could get a hotel room, she thinks of the hotel employees and notes, "The damned way they look at you, and their damned voices, like high, smooth, unclimbable walls all round you, closing in on you" (147). When she asks her ex- lover's cousin Vincent for money so that she can get an abortion, she sees "the look in his eyes like a high, smooth, unclimbable wall" ( 1 72). Anna sees the imperial gaze as that which encloses and contains, in the same way the English landscape is enclosed in a kind of "internal colonization," as Mitchell argues of the Enclosure movement. The gaze is thus transformed into "an emblem of national and imperial identity" (17). In the novel, Vincent's attempts to control and contain Anna's sexuality are also part of an important equation that connects the gendering of the New World, the Enclosure movement, and female sexuality. Patricia Parker, who has discussed the connection between the colonialist rhetoric that feminized colonized land and its accompanying power to enclose and control land at home in an effort to define "the nation," provides a reminder about this important link. She argues: [ . . . ] we might perceive the structural affinity between a rhetorical tradition concerned to find out or discover a plenteous "matter" and bring it under proper disposition or control, and the way in which the New World was processed, in texts which suggest that the abundance and "unnameable excess" of this feminized New Land also constituted a potential threat, something not just to be marveled at but to be mastered. (148-49) Once the feminine colony is mastered, it becomes the "Other" against which the English nation is defined. In Voyage in the Dark, Anna Morgan is labeled a New World "Hottentot" trespassing on English soil (13), an example of how the English attempt to control her by turning her into a racially suspect "strange thing" (Parker 1 54), and the accompanying reduction of her sexuality to a monetary exchange, carefully contained and delineated, is a clear example of the bodily and sexual enclosure that Parker delineates. Another example of such sexual enclosure is echoed in Vincent's French girlfriend Germaine, a foreigner who clearly has a sexual relationship with him while receiving money from him. She comments on England, "It's a very nice place [ . . . ] so long as you don't suffer from claustrophobia" and even ties this enclosure to national identity when she comments, "I wouldn't be an Englishwoman [ . . . ] for any money you could give me or anything else" (81). Toward the end of the novel, Vincent also coolly tells Anna to have the abortion and get over it, and then notes that Anna's friend from the chorus line looks "hard" in a photograph,</page><page sequence="6">52 Journal of Caribbean Literatures reducing Anna and her friend to a type by remarking, "They get like that" (174). Anna's sexuality is something to be bought and negotiated over, her reproductive powers something to forget. The landscape even seems to punish her further for her abortion. When she leaves the abortionist's office, she is afraid "because the slanting houses might fall on me or the pavement rise up and hit me" (178). As Anna maps the walls that confront her in the urban landscape and in the gazes of metropolitan men, however, she wrests control of a process that has historically contained land, women, and native peoples. She does this by giving agency to the landscape, by calling attention to the marking and naming of the city through class and racial hierarchies and to the enclosures that insure English national identity. In direct contrast to these walls of enclosure, she remaps the urban landscape through perceptions of temporal fluidity that affect her experience of urban space and of history. These perceptions have their source in remembered Afro-Caribbean traditions. In Rhys's novels, landscape is not simply distantly picturesque and removed from the reader, but landscape actually merges with the lived experience of the characters and makes us question the ways in which landscape has been feminized and colonized in representations of the New World by the conquerors in their written accounts, paintings, and maps. The vividly anthropomorphic qualities of Rhys's Caribbean landscapes also offer alternatives to identity formations; identity is not constituted merely through the imperial gaze at a painting or map or the desire of the conqueror that the "real" landscape has come to represent. The gendered qualities of the Caribbean landscape may still be problematic for Rhys, but her characters' close connection to that landscape keeps it from being only an object for colonial violation.5 Their lived experience in the landscape constitutes their subjectivities in relation and resistance to the colonizing male gaze. Anne McClintock analyzes the representations of women at the boundaries of exploration - illustrated as sirens and mermaids on the margins of maps - and argues these representations reveal to male discoverers their fear of engulfment and enclosure (24). By representing Anna Morgan's fluid experience within the landscape, Rhys resists an aesthetic that carefully defines boundaries between space and place in landscape painting and on maps. She reveals that these boundaries are fluid for a particular gendered postcolonial subject, who, thus, resists interpellation into national citizenship by deaestheticizing the metropolitan landscape. The movement of her characters in landscape reveals a deep connection to their experience of time. Anna Morgan's movements, both in the city and country within England, are coexistent with Rhys's insistence that the past is the present - an oft- quoted explanation by Rhys about what she hoped to represent in Voyage in the Dark {Letters 24). I would argue that one source of this insistence is particularly important for understanding how Anna's experience of landscape constitutes postcolonial resistance to imperial progress, and that is the Afro-Caribbean source. An important way to subvert the historical narrative of imperialist expansion is to understand the time/space continuum as it is rooted in African cultures and is then</page><page sequence="7">Mapping the Sea Change 53 experienced by a postcolonial subject in relation to landscape. John S. Mbiti makes this continuum clear when he explains that, "according to traditional concepts, time is a two-dimensional phenomenon, with a long past, a present and virtually no future. The linear concept of time in western thought, with an indefinite past, present and infinite future, is practically foreign to African thinking" (21). By embodying this two-dimensional time/space continuum in landscape, and particularly in the way Anna moves through that landscape, Rhys reveals how a postcolonial woman who is highly aware of the African influences on the Caribbean culture of her home resists the intertwined notions of infinite future progress and the inevitable exploitation that are the result of more linear notions of Western time. This disruption of linear time is also quite evident in the spirit of West Indian carnival that is present throughout Voyage in the Dark. Carnival is a mechanism that suggests for women in particular "a redeployment or counterproduction of culture, knowledge and pleasure" (Russo 2 1 8) and is a powerful tool for rebellion.6 "The carnivalesque" as a set of transgressive practices has been most famously examined by M.M. Bakhtin in Rabelais and His World.1 It is within a context of carnival that Rhys's characters, in Voyage in the Dark as well as in her other novels, order their experience in the hierarchically-determined cultures of modern Europe, and it is within this context that they attempt to subvert the hierarchy while remaining within it. Anna's preoccupation with fashion, a form of costuming, as well as her status as a performer, show how deeply carnival is embedded in her very being. The suspension of time that occurs at the end of the novel, when she is delirious from the effects of a botched abortion and remembers how she danced "forwards and backwards backwards and forwards" (186) during carnival also underscores her longing for the subversions of time and space that carnival allows. Carnival is an ambiguous practice for Rhys's women protagonists.However, as Mary Lou Emery points out: They find that their longings for adventure have made them transgressors of public spaces, and they fear making spectacles of themselves. Carnival emerges as a memory and a discourse that allows them to rescript the meanings of the spectacle so that they do indeed make it themselves and so that it gains the potential for ritual resistance. Nevertheless, while their presence on the streets, in bars, and in cafes becomes disturbing to others, they feel exposed and threatened. (6) Bakhtin contends that those who celebrate carnival are not merely playing, but instead are living carnival's transgressive potential in a suspension of time and space. This is how Rhys's characters experience the carnivalesque as well, and why it makes sense that Anna Morgan is a chorus girl, a costumed performer who experiences the English landscape in a suspension of time and space that infuses her with rebelliousness and breaks down the boundaries between her and her environment.</page><page sequence="8">54 Journal of Caribbean Literatures Abandoned and penniless, Anna finds herself reenacting her carnival experience through her role as a chorus girl. As do carnival celebrants, she extends that exper- ience into her everyday life. Anna carries the theater as she knows it out onto the street, and as such, it becomes a powerful tool for breaking down the public- private dichotomy that has long been a primary source of female oppression, and it re-defines life in a hierarchical society. Anna Morgan's ways of knowing are fused with her identity as a chorus girl, so much so that England becomes a stage on which to live out her transgressions. She experiences England from the trains that carry her from one show to the next and notes of the landscape that, "It was as if a curtain had fallen, hiding everything I had ever known" (3), thus turning the English landscape into a piece of scenery with which she is trapped onstage when the show is over, and emphasizing the lack of boundaries between public and private, between stage and landscape, between the body of a dispossessed woman and her environ- ment. Rhys has even indicated a lack of boundaries between herself and her experience of her environment by taking the color of this English landscape, and all of the oppression and despair it implies, and using it as her own stage surname. In Smile Please, her appropriately unfinished autobiography, Rhys writes of her early days as a chorus girl and says, "Gray was the name I was using then" (88), revealing how she fused her experience of the English landscape with her identity. In Voyage in the Dark, Anna goes on, too, "Thinking how cold the street would be outside and the dressing-room cold too, and that my place was by the door in the draught. It always was" (16). As the draft infuses her body, Anna's very being is quite literally constituted by the external landscape, a "grey" landscape, revealing a lack of boundaries between interior and exterior environments. Additionally, I would argue that the distinct lack of boundaries between performer and environment is an example of another Afro-Caribbean influence, the vodun possession dance. Wilson Harris writes that in the dance of vodun possession, "'space' is the character of the dance - since the celebrants themselves are soon turned into 'objects' - into an architecture of movement like 'deathless' flesh, wood or stone" (13). In Anna Morgan, Rhys shows the performer to be inhabited by the external world as she inhabits it in a similar dance of possession. The grey streets that follow her to the theater and to her room, the grey sky and chimney smoke, the grey promenade and grey-brown or grey-green seas all infuse her as she sits in the draft. The outside is inside, of her, and while she possesses it, it also possesses her. This is the oppressive landscape of the imperial center, and by quite literally embodying it, she attempts to resist its limiting exlusions, the unclimbable walls. The boundaries between self and external environment are so fluid as to be non-existent, thus undermining the imperialist urge to define and delineate space in order to possess it, to own it. By making apparent the aspects of the British landscape that dispossessed and contained many of its people through her own powers of conscious mapping, Anna reveals these inseparable parallels and the nation that constructed them. Indeed, there is no clearer example of how landscape, enclosure, temporality, and</page><page sequence="9">Mapping the Sea Change 55 imperialism intersect than in a vivid passage where Anna thinks of an advertisement boasting "Biscuits Like Mother Makes, as Fresh in the Tropics as in the Motherland, Packed in Airtight Tins" and goes on to describe the advertisement as showing a little boy and girl, the girl reaching up toward sky with a "high, dark wall" behind her. Anna recounts that the slogan reads, "The past is clear, / The future clear, / And, best of all, the present" and goes on to note, "But it was the wall that mattered. And that used to be my idea of what England was like. 'And it is like that, too'" (148-49). History is progress forward through expansion toward the colonies, but within the Mother Country, marginal subjects are packed-in airtight, enclosed by a wall that fixes them and denies them full participation as citizens. Rhys even examines the constitutive element of the landscape - plant life - and finds it menacing, enclosed, and even unnatural. She thinks of a plant made of rubber, "It looked proud of itself, as if it knew that it was going on for ever and ever, as if it knew that it fitted in with the house and the street and the spiked railings outside" (34). The plant is artificial yet aware of its own solidity, in contrast to the vibrant living vegetation of Anna's island landscape. In Anna's memories, the landscape on the island is almost possessed by spirits, a living text containing the ancestors of the place, as Wilson Harris would argue, but the English plant is aware only of itself and the spiked railings that keep outsiders out, underscoring the encouragement foreigners are given to "Get on or get out, they say. Get on or get out" (74), as Anna notices. Despite the fact that the empire extends the world over, the artificial plant and its environment are self-contained, insular, and smug. England's natural environment, however, is also something that restricts. Anna and her lover Walter sit outside in a forest, and Anna at first admits that she didn't think England could be so beautiful. As she looks at the foliage more closely, however, she realizes that it, too, has a way of keeping things out. She notes, "We got to where the beech trees grew close together and their branches met, high up. You had the feeling that outside it was a hot, blue day" (78). Even what is natural in landscape encloses, contains, is tamed and even though Anna and Walter are outside, they are cut off from the sun and sky. They might as well be back in one of Anna's dingy little rooms. It is when Anna thinks of her island home, however, that landscape comes alive as a force that regenerates instead of threatens. In contrast to the artificial rubber plant, she describes a hibiscus as "so red, so proud, and its long gold tongue hung out. It was so red that even the sky was just a background for it" (56). The vibrant colors infuse Anna with a warmth and connection that she cannot feel in England. The hibiscus, which has probably died, was once at least alive and vivid. Unlike the rubber plant that fits in with the English house and street and spiked railings that keep foreigners out, the hibiscus is part of the landscape that keeps Anna's memories, and thus herself, alive. Remembering her island, even if she is romanticizing it at times, is a survival strategy, and when she has trouble describing the flowers of her island, she signifies the difficulty of living in the metropolitan center but trying to remember her island colony. She says, "But when I began to</page><page sequence="10">56 Journal of Caribbean Literatures talk about the flowers out there I got that feeling of a dream, of two things that I couldn't fit together, and it was as if I were making up the names. Stephanotis, hibiscus, yellow-bell, jasmine, frangipanni, corolita" (77-78). This is an example of a Jamesonian gap with a twist. In Jameson's formulation, the metropolitan citizen who is vaguely aware of that which is geographically constitutive of everyday life - the colony - is unable to account for it except through a sense of personal alienation. In Rhys's reformulation, however, Anna, as the postcolonial whose home island becomes ever more distant in memory as well as geographically, tries to account for the gap by naming the wildlife that she "couldn't fit together." The reality of life in the metropolitan center makes her memories more and more dream- like and abstract, yet she still tries to put them into words. And what she focuses on to articulate those memories are the elements of the Caribbean landscape, the flowers and vegetation, that help her resist burying her Caribbean past. Feminized Landscape, Female Identity While some of Rhys's critics have acknowledged that landscape is a significant component in her writing, none have pursued it in any sustained way.8 Many other critics have discussed the feminized aspects of Rhys's landscapes, but seem to accept these aspects as merely indicative of the characters' longings for their lost mothers, and thus, of home. (The Caribbean island is thus the "true" Motherland.) None of these critics, however, have studied the implications of this obvious appro- priation by Rhys of a trope that has long been used in the service of exploitation and oppression in the New World.9 David Spurr reminds us that the "allegorization of colonized nations in terms of the female figure (bodily, rhetorical) has been a cliché of colonial history" (171), and many of Rhys's critics in fact repeat some of these same clichéd colonizing gestures. By simply describing Rhys's landscapes as feminine and leaving unquestioned why it is that Rhys chooses this particular colonialist trope through which to constitute her female characters' identities, and by ignoring whether she alters such a persistent trope at all, these critics leave the terms of conquest firmly in place. Constructing certain female identities through landscape - a landscape that is a vital, living thing - allows Rhys to write a resistance to the colonizing gaze. The contrast between Anna Morgan's experience of the English landscape and her memories of the island landscape of her youth introduces some of the same issues Rhys writes of over thirty years later in Wide Sargasso Sea, and thus, it becomes clear that understanding the significance of landscape in the earlier novel is necessary for understanding her work as a whole. Rhys questions how the aesthetics of the landscape signify otherness, for instance, when Anna refers to her family estate on the island and tries to explain to her lover Walter that it is beautiful. She goes on to ask, however, "On the other hand, if England is beautiful, it's not beautiful. It's some other world. It all depends, doesn't it?" (52). Furthermore, the Caribbean landscape's anthropomorphic qualities are evident throughout the novel, and by stressing that the landscape is a living thing, Rhys draws an inseparable connection</page><page sequence="11">Mapping the Sea Change 57 between it and Anna. The landscape is her consciousness and her identity, and any violation of it is a violation of her. Together, they constitute a "life force," as Elaine Savory argues (7). Anna emphasizes the life force of her island home as life cycle when she remem- bers the road on the way to one of her family's estates: You turn to the left and the sea is at your back, and the road goes zigzag upwards. The feeling of the hills comes to you - cool and hot at the same time. Everything is green, everywhere things are growing. There is never one moment of stillness - always something buzzing. And then dark cliffs and ravines and the smell of rotten leaves and damp. That's how the road to Constance is - green, and the smell of green, and then the smell of water and dark earth and rotting leaves and damp. (151) She goes on to remember seeing the countryside with its "curve of a hill like the curve of a green shoulder" (70). The land resembles the human body, and this again signifies Anna's close connection to it: the landscape is part of her conscious- ness as the body is part of the landscape. Each is a significant component of the other, and while Anna's sense of the landscape as a body echoes the explorers' descriptions and representations of the landscape as the female body in particular, Rhys pushes beyond such descriptions in order to reveal the damage they do. Rhys makes clear that all of the fears and desires that were projected upon the feminized landscape by the explorers are still apparent among the English.10 Rhys's English characters respond so negatively to the island landscapes because they realize its apparent lack of spatial and temporal boundaries undermine those that construct their national identities. As Anna remembers the night landscape, there is no question how subversive the appropriation of the landscape-as-woman trope can be: Before I came to England I used to try to imagine a night that was quite still. I used to try to imagine it with the crac-cracs going. The verandah long and ghostly - the hammock and three chairs and a table with the telescope on it - and the crac-cracs going all the time. The moon and the darkness and the sound of the trees, and not far away the forest where nobody had ever been - a virgin forest. We used to sit on the verandah with the night coming in, huge. And the way it smelt of flowers. ("This place gives me the creeps at night," Hester would say.) (83) All that is sexual and represented as feminine - the flowers, the moon, the "virgin" forest - indicate a lack of boundaries that terrify Anna's English stepmother. The night landscape is inescapable and does not remain outside, in some external sphere,</page><page sequence="12">5 8 Journal of Caribbean Literatures but rather, is "coming in, huge." In another passage, Anna remembers the waterfall at her family estate, and the pool in which she used to bathe: I was always dreaming about that pool, too. It was clear just beyond where the waterfall fell, but the shallow parts were muddy. Those big white flowers that open at night grew round it. Pop-flowers, we call them. They are shaped like lilies and they smell heavy- sweet, very strong. You can smell them a long way off. Hester couldn't bear the scent, it made her faint. (90) The landscape actually sickens Anna's stepmother, and while her gender affects that response in more complicated ways than if she were a male colonizer,11 it is evident that the feminized landscape, a landscape without boundaries, disturbs Anna's stepmother because it subverts the carefully delineated boundaries that define "Englishness" and English national identity. Thus, in Voyage in the Dark, Jean Rhys illustrates that the two elements of the trope, "woman" and "landscape" cannot be disengaged from one another, that in order to understand the history of colonialism and the damage that it has done to both landscape and feminized peoples - especially to a particular Creole woman - the trope must be redeployed beyond its meaning as allegory. The landscape is a character in Rhys's novels, because the character is the landscape, and what she shows her readers is that both have suffered horribly precisely from that imperialist formulation. By focusing on landscape, Rhys adds to an understanding of why modernism incorporates such elements as dream-logic, fragmentation, and stream- of-consciousness narrative techniques in the first place. Rhys's use of the narrative strategies that have defined what we have come to know as "modernism" in order to question the linearity of colonialist history and its impact on colonial subjects pushes our understanding of modernism to include postcolonialism as a significant force within it. 1 For overviews of the varying definitions and formulations of modernism as aesthetic practice, historical period, and narrative strategy, see especially Art Berman, Preface to Modernism (Urbana: U of Illinois P, 1994); Astradur Eysteinsson, The Concept of Modernism (Ithaca: Cornell UP, 1990); Hugh Kenner, The Pound Era (Berkeley: U of California P, 1971); Michael H. Levenson, A Genealogy of Modernism (Cambridge: Cambridge UP, 1984), among others. What becomes clear from these studies is that modernism has long been a slippery term, the more so for critical exclusions of "marginal writers" like Rhys and other writers from the colonial and postcolonial world. 2 In his essay "The Road to Thornfield Hall: An Analysis of Jean Rhys' Wide Sargasso Sea" (in New Beacon Reviews: Collection One, ed. John La Rose (London: New Beacon, 1 968)). Wally Look Lai advanced his argument that Rhys should be considered a Caribbean writer. In Contradictory Omens (Mona, Jamaica: Savacou Publications, 1970), Edward Brathwaite later argued that since Rhys was not one of "the folk "who were the center of</page><page sequence="13">Mapping the Sea Change 59 West Indian society and culture, she could not be considered a Caribbean writer. In the context of this debate, Kenneth Ramchand warned about neglecting the "social relevance" of white Caribbean writers. See his The West Indian Novel and Its Background (New York: Barnes &amp; Noble, Inc., 1970). Louis James maps out this debate and agrees that Rhys is indeed a Caribbean writer in his essay "Sun Fire - Painted Fire: Jean Rhys as a Caribbean Novelist," reprinted in Critical Perspectives on Jean Rhys, ed. Pierrette M. Frickey (Washington, D.C.: Three Continents, 1990). 3 Stephen Slemon's definition of "post-colonial" seems most precise, it seems to me, especially as it liberates postcoloniality from the confines of the merely historical. He argues that "the concept proves most useful not when it is used synonymously with a post- independence historical period in once-colonized nations but rather when it locates a specifically anti- orposi-colonial discursive purchase in culture, one which begins in the moment that colonial power inscribes itself onto the body and space of its Others and which continues as an often occulted tradition into the modern theatre of neo-colonialist international relations" (3). 4 M.M. Adjarian discusses the "inbetween" status of Antoinette/Bertha in her article, "Between and Beyond Boundaries in Wide Sargasso Sea'' and explains Caren Kaplan's definition of "inbetween" as "a space inhabited by oppositional consciousness - that is, those who exist somewhere between the various centers and margins of (white male) power structures" (208). I want to extend that notion to the character of Anna Morgan in Voyage in the Dark as well. See also Kaplan's article, "Deterritorializations: The Rewriting of Home and Exile in Western Feminist Discourse," Cultural Critique 6 (Spring 1987): 187-198. 5 Sir Walter Raleigh's writing of Guyana as "Countrey that hath yet her Maydenhead" is one example among many of the ways in which the New World landscape was gendered by the early explorers. For other studies of the gendering of the New World see Louis Montrose, "The Work of Gender in the Discourse of Discovery," Representations 33 (Winter 1 99 1 ): 1 -4 1 ; and Annette Kolodny, The Lay of the Land (Chapel Hill: U of North Carolina P, 1975). 6 In the Caribbean, carnival was and is a common practice on many islands, including Jean Rhys's home island of Dominica. In their book After Africa, Abraham and Szwed examine the history of carnival in Jamaica, and thus describe some of the common carnivalesque practices throughout the Caribbean. The fact that Jamaican carnival was a combination of peasant festivals in Europe that made their way to the upper classes and were brought to the island and then melded together with New World African customs in another kind of sea-change suggests something inherently transformative about the celebration: not only does it renew its participants, it renews itself. In Jamaica, slaves participated in the three- day Christmas carnival that consisted of constant music and dance. Costumes of brightly colored material and masks made of animal tusks or other materials exhibited native elements while mocking and incorporating European elements as well. Slaveowners contri- buted food and money to the festivities in order to assert some control through a show of support and to encourage revelry instead of rebellion (Abraham &amp; Szwed 226-28). Certain accounts reveal that slave uprisings often occurred anyway, lending credence to the view that the liberation of carnival masking and the suspension of time and space are empowering. 7 Bakhtin analyzes carnival for its transgressive potential in Europe, noting that it was a festival that co-opted official customs and discourse. He argues that carnival existed to "consecrate inventive freedom, to permit the combination of a variety of different elements and their rapprochement, to liberate from the prevailing point of view of the world [ . . . ] to realize the relative nature of all that exists, and to enter a completely new order of things" (34). Bakhtin goes on to argue that mechanisms of the carnivalesque bring official truths down to earth and make them manageable. The topsy-turvy aspect of the carnival world opens up a whole new range of possibilities that a closed system denies: laughter,</page><page sequence="14">60 Journal of Caribbean Literatures masking and costumes, abusive language, the figure of the grotesque, madness, and even death all speak to the transformational potentialities that are within one's grasp when the official world is turned upside down. Most importantly, Bakhtin underscores the rebellion that can occur because he points out that the carnival spirit "destroys [ . . . ] limited seriousness [and] frees human consciousness, thought and imagination" (49). 8 See especially Raskin (9); O'Connor (65); and Drake (99). 9 Many critics, however, have simply accepted that the landscape is inherently feminine, not strategically feminized by Rhys. See especially Bev; E.L. Brown (75); Nancy Hemond Brown (8); and Laura Niesen de Abruna (267). Elaine Savory notes that Rhys's color symbolism - a significant aspect of her landscape descriptions - is "a feminine code" (9), and perhaps in the most reductive assessment of Rhys's landscapes, Teresa O'Connor simply accepts the easy equation of the landscapes Anna has read about in Coleridge's "Kubla Kahn" with her memories of her own island in Voyage in the Dark (102), but she completely ignores the orientalist overtones of Coleridge's "Khan" and the role it plays in imperialist ideology. I would argue instead that Rhys uses this trope to show how Anna resists her own interpellation by it and re-appropriates it to signify something other than land to be penetrated for the male colonizer's gaze. By making the landscape-as- woman trope an integral part of the main character's sense of herself, Rhys asks us to question the force of this trope and the implications for those upon whom it is imposed. 10 David Spurr points out how this trope "marks the entrance of the colonizer, with his penetrating and controlling power, as a natural union with the subject nation. Colonial domination thus is understood as having a salutary effect on the natural excesses and the undirected sexual energies of the colonized" (172). The arbitrary geographic boundaries of the colony that establish English national identity are undermined by the island landscape in Voyage in the Dark, however, by the very trope used to impose those boundaries. 11 For more on the position of colonial women in relation to colonized women, see many of the essays in Blunt and Rose's collection, especially Sara Mills's "Knowledge, Gender, and Empire," Alison Blunt's "Mapping Authorship and Authority: Reading Mary Kingsley's Landscape Descriptions," and Cheryl McEwan's "Encounters with West African Women: Textual Representations of Difference by White Women Abroad."
