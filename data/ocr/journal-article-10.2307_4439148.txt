During the past fifty years, under the im- pact of the Machine Age, America's landscape has undergone vast changes from the semi- rural culture of the turn of the century to the highly urbanized complex of the present. Many a city dweller of today visualizes meat only as something that comes from the super- market, neatly packaged and wrapped in ster- ile cellophane; milk as a white substance that appears miraculously on the doorstep in car- tons or bottles so long as the bills are paid; and water as something that flows endlessly from a chrome-plated tap at the will of the user. On a large segment of the public, the fact that meat, milk, and water are direct products of the soil has been lost in a great maze of high-pressure advertising and modern specialization. Even the farmers, for the greater part, are now specialists in wheat, corn, hogs, or beef, and the old-time general farmer, who raised practically all of the family needs on his own few acres and traded the surplus for bolts of calico or legal services, has become a fading anachronism. As our society has grown more complicated, the distance between the plot of soil that raises the food product and the ulti- mate consumer has stretched from a few rods to many hundreds of miles. Iowa corn may fatten Vermont turkeys that will be served on tables in San Francisco, and wheat raised in the Dakotas is converted into flour in Min- neapolis for consumption as bread in Florida. From the standpoint of the nation's economy these developments are generally good, but often they tend to blind the consumer to basic natural resources problems. The old-time farmer whose water supply came from a spring on a nearby hill knew the importance of keeping forest fires away from that hill and grazing area sparingly if at all. It is somewhat more difficult for the apartment dweller in the city to see that the same principles apply to his own water supply when his own water tap is separated from the source by some fifty to a hundred miles of cast-iron pipe. A major part of the job of the modem nature teacher is to bridge this vast gap of understanding. Rather than becoming simpler, the problem of supplying the needs of a nation of 175 million people is perhaps ten times as difficult as it was for a nation of 100 million. New processing methods consume huge quan- tities of water, and some new products require in their manufacture as much water as was consumed for all purposes at the beginning of the century. Plans now in the blueprint stage for future developments promise still further heavy uses of water in the coming years with little promise of an increased supply. Aside from the fundamental needs of food and clothing, America is losing many of the spiritual and esthetic values of natural re- sources, and these values are assuming increas- ing importance as population pressures build up. A major part of the present suburban movement is a somewhat futile attempt by Americans to escape from the crowding of city life and to get closer to nature. The pres- ervation of the outdoor recreation these people want-whether it be birdwatching, boating, hunting or fishing-will depend upon how well we manage to preserve some of the natural areas which must provide the environ- ment for these sports in future years. Few greater or more important tasks can be performed by the members of the Ameri- can Nature Study Society than to impress upon their pupils the values of remaining natural areas and the importance of managing the land to produce maximum material and recreational values consistent with essential material needs. During the coming years it will become increasingly necessary for teachers of biology and nature study to drive home facts concern- ing the interrelationships of livng things-in- cluding man-with one another. We have spe- cialized in every field, even in natural resource management, to the extent that some foresters see woodland values only in terms of saw logs; some agriculturists regard any plot of land not producing corn or soybeans as wastelands; and *Presented at the annual meeting of The American Nature Study Society, Washington, D. C., Decem- ber 27, 1958. 229</page><page sequence="2">230 THE AMlERICAN BIOLOGY TEACHER October, 1959 many engineers consider any water area, whether marsh, stream or lake, as worthless until filled, channelized, leveed, or drained. The fact that these areas may be important recreational areas providing a brief escape from a world increasingly filled with man- made noise is lost on such people. They also may never fully understand that the draining or filling of a coast marsh area may affect the importance of local commercial fishery catches; that the draining of potholes in the Dakotas may deprive hunters on the marshes of Louisiana of a day of sport; that the exploitive cutting of a forest area may destroy the recre- ational values of streams far below the lum- bering operation; or that forest fires and over- grazing may destroy or seriously impair the water supplies of large cities. A second contribution that teachers of nature study and biology can make in future years is an improvement of the accuracy of information passed on to others. Many of the myths, half-truths, and fallacies that filled the early literature of natural history have been buried, but, unfortunately, some of these heri- tages from a less enlightened past persist to the present in the writings of some popular writers, in the lectures of untrained teachers, and in a substantial portion of the public mind. Some of these fallacies may be attributed to limited personal observation but stem from lack of scientific training and from prejudices traceable to superstidion, folk-lore, and myth. A common failing of many nature writers is the use of the anthropomorphic concept of "good" and "evil" when applied to members of a natural community. This idea originated many centuries ago with fabulists like Aesop and LaFontaine, but it has been perpetuated by modem writings, even of people claiming to be serious nature teachers. I have no desire to see children deprived of the pleasures of the classic fables and fairy stories, but it would be good to see a more objective approach on the part of responsible authors and lecturers on nature study. The anthropomorphic concept is familiar to all of you. One of its common themes is that the grazers and browsers, such as deer, rabbits, and sheep, are virtuous "friends of man" while the carnivores are the perpetual villains of the natural drama, thirsting for the blood of the innocent, and conflicting with the interests of the farmer and of humanity at large. Anyone who is familiar with wild- life management problems today, however, should be aware of the fact that overpopula- tions of wild grazing animals are creating greater economic problems than the depreda- tions of all predatory mammals combined. Elk and deer, the two worst offenders, have in- creased in number so rapidly in many places that they are threatening watershed values, de- stroying valuable forest reproduction, and presenting a threat to local agricultural efforts. These problems in turn are traceable, at least in part, to the extermination of wolves, pumas, and other predators under campaigns often initiated and supported by sportsmen and nature lovers to protect the herbivores. Predation, in the absence of other effective population controls, is essential to the well- being of the prey species. It tends to keep herds of browsing and grazing mammals in balance with their food supplies, minimizing overcrowding that causes mass starvation, lowered reproduction, malnutrition, and dis- ease. Even heavy seasonal hunting has not been able to prevent general overpopulations of deer and elk over the ranges of these species in America. A second common misconception among otherwise well-informed nature students is that a native predatory species can exterminate more desirable local wildlife populations or that seed-eating birds exert important con- trols over undesirable plants. When one con- siders the abundance and fecundity of plants, with a single seed pod or flower head produc- ing from fifty to ten thousand seeds, it can be seen that even large concentrations of birds could do little more than exert the most local control over the spread of any one plant species. Predator-prey relationships are similar in their basic mechanics. The unbalance of reproductive potential between prey and predator also applies here. Then, too, few predators single out one species of prey to attack to the exclusion of all others, since most of them are hunters of opportunity, tak- ing what is most readily available, and trans- ferring their attention to more abundant or more easily captured forms when the first is reduced below levels of abundance. By dispelling these and similar fallacies from the literature of nature study the members</page><page sequence="3">Vol. 21, No. 6 NATURAL HISTORY OF SOME BIRD'S NESTS 231 of the ANSS can make an important contribu- tion to a clearer public understanding of the relationships between living organisms. But from the broader standpoint of the future of man, the greatest contribution that this So- ciety can make would be to instill in others what Aldo Leopold called "the ecological con- science," an awareness of the interrelationship between various natural resources as well as between plant communities and animal popu- lations, between human welfare and the con- dition of the soil and water, between land management and water supply, and between wildlife populations and forest resources. Pos- sibly if we had had a few more nature teachers with an ecological conscience fifty years ago, many of our present problems would have solved themselves without the sometimes bit- ter controversies that have marked the con- servation movement in recent years.</page></plain_text>
