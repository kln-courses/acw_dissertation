<plain_text><page sequence="1">EDITORIAL Advertising Education Advertising is one form of human communication. While there are other forms of communication, adver- tising is concerned with communication about products and services. Advertising education, therefore, is con- cerned with those subject matter areas involved with understanding the nature of communication. It is truly an interdisciplinary enterprise. However, if we really believe that advertising is a communication industry, and that it, therefore, is con- cerned with the study of communication, then it is a reasonable implication that advertising education - wherever it occurs - would, in fact, show that the study of communication was actually being pursued. Yet, any empirical analysis will easily show that this is not the case. Except for a few isolated cases, the facts are that we are actually engaged in the study of "communications," not communication. And therein lies a major cause of many of our problems in advertising education (and, subsequently, in agency and client organizations). Our time and ener- gies are so completely committed to gaining knowl- edge about the technological contingencies to the communication process (layout, design, production, media, etc.), we find little time for gaining knowledge about the process per se. Consequently, we are experts in knowing how to design ads and commercials, and we are experts in knowing what materials and tech- niques to use in their construction, but we can't tell why one ad or commercial communicates better than another - not beyond opinion, and not coherently. To do so would necessarily require true knowledge about the nature of communication. In general, the study of communication involves those disciplines considered to be informative of what it means to be a human being, that is to say, a con- sumer. Since advertising is communication between human beings, the more students know about what it means to be human, the better should be the communi- cative efficacy of their future advertising efforts. These subjects are known as the humanities - what we cur- rently label the "social and behavioral sciences." Today, one of our major educational problems lies in making available to students those particular courses whose burden it is to coherently explain and coherently measure the communicative effectiveness of specific advertisements and commercials. These courses are found in the humanities. There are, of course, some universities that do offer courses in their advertising curricula beyond the level of vocational education - courses, e.g., in com- munication theory, psycholinguistics, and psychology. Yet, any basic (ontological) investigation of these courses will show them to lack theoretical presupposi- tions valid for the consumer's mind. Such an analysis easily shows that the psychological terms employed have, in fact, been equivocated to neurophysiological phenomena. And it is this fact that constitutes a sec- ond major educational problem. We need to allow a competition of ideas in this area; we need to allow another point of view to be heard in these critical courses - a point of view whose experimental designs do not require a basic confusion between psychologi- cal and physical phenomena. Nothing will change at the operational level of advertising and consumer behavior research, unless it is first changed at the theoretical level. And merely giving a psychological label to a theory or test instrument does not necessar- ily mean that the theory or test instrument is actually concerned with psychological phenomena. Therefore, the two most urgent problems in adver- tising education today are, (1 ) the need to achieve a better balance between courses in vocational educa- tion and courses in the humanities, and (2) the need for courses in the humanities - should they be of- fered -that have theoretica I presuppositions based on something other than neurophysiological psychol- ogy. A pertinent question is: What is the prognosis for a more balanced type of advertising education to occur? In many universities, there exist some serious problems which are antithetical to quality education. Not the least of these problems is an intensified politi- calization which - as any epistemological critique of current advertising research will suggest - has made it extremely difficult to pursue new ideas (ontologically discrete from materialism). In the absence of pub- lished research that would prove otherwise, this further suggests that a genuinely free search for truth has been effectively impaired. Recently, a major article in the Wall Street Journal by Kingman Brewster, Jr., President of Yale University, stated in part: "In strong universities, assuring free- dom from intellectual conformity coerced within the institution is even more of a concern than is the pro- tection of freedom from external interference. . . . If a university is alive and productive, it is a place where colleagues are in constant dispute; defending their latest intellectual enthusiasm, attacking the contrary view of others. From this trial by intellectual combat emerges a sharper insight, later to be blunted by other, sharper minds. It is vital that this contest be uninhibited by fear of reprisal. Sides must be taken only on the basis of the merits of a proposition. Jock- eying for favor by trimming the argument because some colleague or some group will have the power of academic life or death in some later process of review would falsify and subvert the whole exercise." Advertising exists to serve the communication 45</page><page sequence="2">needs of advertisers. Advertising education, therefore, should prepare students to provide advertisers with the best service possible. The argument here is for a better balance between courses in vocational tech- nology and those subjects informative of what it means to be a human being (i.e., a consumer). The current imbalance has resulted in anthropomorphic explana- tions of advertising and consumer behavior. Surely, we should at least make the effort to provide adver- tisers with better "service" than this. For our own best interests, we urgently need to move out of politics, and even beyond the "neutrality" of studied silence, and to actually encourage those points of view about ad- vertising that differ radically from our own.
