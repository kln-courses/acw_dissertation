      <p>More than 25 years ago, Jöreskog, Keesling, and Wiley (working independently) made a major breakthrough in the field of multivariate analysis when they developed a general framework for the analysis of covariance structures that integrated psychometric factor analytic models with econometric structural equation models, and permitted latent variables to be related to each other in a simultaneous equations fashion. A few years later, the impact of this breakthrough began to be felt in the field of consumer research, spurred on by the development of the first computer program to implement this general method (LISREL) and the publication of Bagozzi's (1980) influential book <italic>Causal Models in Marketing</italic>.</p>
      <p>Although at least some of the initial interest in latent variable structural equation modeling (LVSEM) was driven by the myth that it had a unique capacity to extract information about causal relationships from correlational data, its greatest value lies in its potential to improve theory development and testing in the field by changing the way we think about things. Because LVSEM requires us to explicitly specify measurement relationships as well as structural relationships, it forces us to think more carefully about the relationships between our constructs and measures, and to recognize these relationships as hypotheses in their own right. Because it provides a ready means of estimating and testing complex theoretical structures, it encourages us to broaden the scope of our theoretical models by thinking in terms of entire systems of conceptual relationships that better represent the complex environments to which we hope our theories apply. And finally, by making it easier to rigorously test mediating processes, investigate the systematic effects of nonhypothesized factors (e.g., methodological or theoretical) on hypothesized relationships, and compare hierarchically related theoretical structures, it encourages us to pit one theory/model/process against another to advance theoretical knowledge in the field. Thus, as noted by Bagozzi (1980), LVSEM offers the discipline a unified, scientifically precise approach for developing and testing theory that integrates metatheoretical criteria with methodological considerations better than any other method currently available.</p>
      <p>But the diffusion of these ideas into the field has been slow, and some of the most powerful capabilities of LVSEM are not being used in consumer research. It has been more than 20 years since LVSEM was first introduced to the field, yet since then only about 6 percent of the papers published in the <italic>Journal of Consumer Research</italic> have tested latent variable structural equation models. Not only is this rate lower than for <italic>Journal of Marketing</italic> or <italic>Journal of Marketing Research</italic>, but it shows no signs of increasing. This low rate of usage is both surprising and disturbing, because LVSEM is particularly well suited for testing the kinds of complex systems of conceptual relationships often specified by theories in our discipline. Although there are several potential reasons why LVSEM is not used more widely in our discipline, one may be that researchers do not fully appreciate its benefits. Consequently, this article discusses several major advantages of LVSEM, and the potential it offers for advancing research in the field. My goal is to sensitize researchers to some of the key limitations of currently used alternative methodologies and stimulate them to rethink how they can improve theory testing and development in our discipline via LVSEM.</p>

            <title>The Ability to Control for Measurement Error</title>
            <p>Perhaps the most important advantage of LVSEM methods is the ability to take measurement error into account. This is important because most measures used in consumer research reflect not only the construct they are intended to represent, but also random and systematic measurement error. Random error is due to the inherent difficulties in accurately measuring abstract constructs, and systematic error can be due to contaminating/confounding factors (e.g., nonhypothesized constructs, social desirability, self‐generated validity, or implicit theories), common method factors (e.g., scale type, rater, or context), response biases (e.g., leniency, yea‐saying, or nay‐saying), or anything other than the hypothesized construct that has a systematic effect on the construct measures. Both types of measurement error threaten the validity of consumer research findings, and they are an especially serious concern whenever the constructs of interest are abstract or difficult to measure—which is more often than we tend to admit.</p>
            <p>It is widely recognized that measurement error causes two problems when examining the relationship between a predictor and a criterion variable in a simple regression. First, measurement error in the predictor variable artificially attenuates the estimate of the slope of the relationship between the predictor and criterion variable. Second, measurement error in either the predictor or the criterion variable artificially reduces the proportion of variance in the criterion variable accounted for by the predictor. Thus, measurement error increases the probability of type II errors when testing hypotheses and may be one of the main reasons why the proportion of variance accounted for is usually quite low in consumer research studies (see, e.g., Peterson, Albaum, and Beltramini 1985).</p>
            <p>However, the problems caused by measurement error get even worse when other predictor variables are added to the model (e.g., in the case of multiple regression) and when the model is placed into a larger theoretical context (e.g., in the case of multiple equation systems). Although the slope coefficient is always attenuated by measurement error in a simple regression, this generalization does <italic>not</italic> hold in multiple regression or multiple equation systems. Measurement error in even a single predictor variable can inflate or deflate any/all of the other regression coefficients in a multiple regression equation (depending upon the reliability of the measures, and the magnitudes and signs of the correlations among the predictors). In fact, in multiple equation systems, measurement error can inflate or deflate not only estimates of the relations between the predictor and criterion constructs, but also estimates of the relations among the criterion constructs, and the structural error terms. Thus, estimated coefficients from multiple regression and multiple equation models that ignore measurement error can be higher or lower than the true coefficients, thus leading to both type I and type II errors.</p>
            <p>At a minimum, this suggests that the potential consequences of ignoring random or systematic measurement error can be quite serious. Just how serious is illustrated by Cote and Buckley (1987) who calculated the average amount of trait, method (i.e., systematic), and random error variance present in 70 multitrait, multimethod studies. They found that in marketing studies the measures averaged approximately 68 percent trait variance, 16 percent systematic measurement error, and 16 percent random measurement error; and in the psychological/sociological research studies the measures contained about 36 percent trait variance, 29 percent systematic measurement error, and 35 percent random measurement error. The figures for a typical <italic>JCR</italic> study would probably be somewhere in between. Thus, approximately one‐third to two‐thirds of the variance in a typical consumer research measure is due to measurement error.</p>
            <p>As noted by Cote and Buckley (1988), the impact of this much measurement error on estimates of the relationships between constructs can be easily calculated. Their analysis indicates that on average, the true relationship between two constructs is typically 2.4 times greater than the estimated relationship between the constructs' imperfect measures. Obviously, an underestimation of this magnitude in a simple regression would have a huge effect on the type II error rate. Moreover, because the amount of measurement error varies depending on the type of construct being studied (perhaps due to the difficulty of measurement or abstractness), and by discipline (perhaps due to differences in the emphasis on construct validation and measurement procedures), so will the extent of the bias. Thus, the bias for some types of consumer research is even greater than the overall average they cite. For example, it can be shown that the bias factor for psychological/sociological research is 2.8, for attitude research is 3.4, and for personality/individual difference research is 2.6. These bias estimates suggest that the common practice of ignoring measurement error is having a substantial (but largely unnoticed) detrimental impact on research in the field.</p>
            <p>Finally, it is important to remember that the biasing effect of measurement error can increase as well as decrease the observed relationships. Table 1 uses Cote and Buckley's (1987) estimates of the average amount of trait, method, and random error variance, and the average method intercorrelation, to calculate the impact of measurement error on the observed correlation between measures of different types of constructs (e.g., attitude, personality, aptitude, and job performance/satisfaction). For example, the entry in the first column of the first row indicates that even though two attitude constructs are perfectly correlated, the observed correlation between their measures will be only .524 because of measurement error. Similarly, the entry in the last column of the first row indicates that even though two attitude constructs are completely uncorrelated, the observed correlation between their measures will be .226 because of measurement error. Both of these numbers are depressing, but for different reasons. The entries in the first column are depressing because they show that even though two traits are perfectly correlated, typical levels of measurement error will cut the observed correlation between their measures in half. The last column is depressing because it shows that even when two constructs are completely uncorrelated, measurement error will inflate the observed correlation between their measures causing it to be greater than zero. Indeed, these numbers are rather scary because some of them are not very different from the effect sizes often reported in <italic>JCR</italic>.<table-wrap id="tb1" position="float" seq="1">

            <p>Fortunately, the biasing effects of measurement error can be controlled in several ways. Random error can be statistically controlled by developing multiple measures of constructs and using LVSEM to test the hypothesized relationships among them. If multiple measures cannot be obtained, it is also possible to partially control for random error by fixing the measurement error term at some reasonable value based on prior research (e.g., a reliability estimate from another study could be used if the measure is a scale score) or theory (e.g., the error in a self‐reported measure of gender is likely to be smaller than the error in a self‐reported measure of attractiveness). Systematic error can be controlled through changes in the design of the study or by modeling the source of the error through the addition of a first‐order method factor. With the exception of a few multitrait, multimethod studies, <italic>JCR</italic> articles have not attempted to statistically control for systematic error variance.</p>

            <title>Improved Experimental Research</title>
            <p>Another advantage of structural equation modeling with latent variables is that it has the potential to fundamentally improve experimental research in the field. In part, this is because measurement error can be taken into account. Just because a study is done in a lab setting does not guarantee that the measures are free from error. This is especially true for the kinds of variables frequently examined in consumer research experiments (e.g., beliefs, emotions, attitudes, satisfaction, brand loyalty, brand equity, materialism, ethnocentrism, need for cognition, involvement, and product knowledge).</p>
            <p>However, there are other important advantages for experimental research as well. One is that the general framework is extremely flexible. Indeed, since LVSEM is a generalization of both regression and factor analysis, it incorporates most linear modeling methods (including ANOVA and ANCOVA) as special cases. This means that models that relax some of the traditional restrictions of ANOVA or ANCOVA can be estimated. For example, LVSEM can be used to examine the effect of a treatment manipulation on a dependent variable, while controlling for covariates that are related to the treatment manipulation and for measurement error. Alternatively, LVSEM can also be used to estimate carryover effects in repeated measures designs in a straightforward fashion, while also taking measurement error into account. These analytical issues cannot be examined with ANOVA or ANCOVA because they violate assumptions of the models.</p>
            <p>Another key advantage is that LVSEM allows more rigorous tests of the hypothesized effects of experimental manipulations. Figure 1, panel A, illustrates this point. As shown in the figure, most experimental manipulations are intended to influence some conceptual variable that cannot be measured or manipulated without error (see e.g., Cook and Campbell 1979; Sawyer, Lynch, and Brinberg 1995). It is hypothesized that the treatment manipulation will influence the dependent variable because of the impact of the manipulation on this particular conceptual independent variable. In other words, the hypothesized (or intended) effect of the manipulation is represented by paths 𝛄<sub>11</sub> and 𝛃<sub>21</sub> in Figure 1. Path 𝛄<sub>11</sub> represents the validity of the experimental manipulation, and path 𝛃<sub>21</sub> represents the impact of the conceptual independent variable on the conceptual dependent variable. Path 𝛄<sub>21</sub> in the figure represents the fact that it is possible for a manipulation to influence the dependent variable for unintended reasons, which have nothing to do with the hypothesized effect of the manipulation. Confounds like this sometimes result from the laudable desire to make the stimulus manipulations realistic, and sometimes simply from the fact that a manipulation is often a blunt instrument, and it is difficult to create treatment conditions that influence the conceptual independent variable without influencing anything else.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

            <p>Traditional ANOVA cannot separate these intended and unintended effects, but LVSEM can. If the model in Figure 1, panel A, is estimated, the hypothesized effect of the manipulation (i.e., the indirect path 𝛄<sub>11</sub>𝛃<sub>21</sub>) can be estimated and tested (cf. Brown 1997) while controlling for the nonhypothesized effects of the manipulation (i.e., path 𝛄<sub>21</sub>). If the indirect path 𝛄<sub>11</sub>𝛃<sub>21</sub> is significant and path 𝛄<sub>21</sub> is not, then the entire effect of the manipulation on the dependent variable is for the hypothesized reason. If the indirect path 𝛄<sub>11</sub>𝛃<sub>21</sub> is significant and the direct path 𝛄<sub>21</sub> is too, then only part of the effect of the manipulation on the dependent variable is for the hypothesized reason. In this event, the standardized path coefficients can be examined to determine the relative strengths of the hypothesized and nonhypothesized effects. And in the unhappy event that the indirect path 𝛄<sub>11</sub>𝛃<sub>21</sub> is nonsignificant while the direct path 𝛄<sub>21</sub> is significant, it would indicate that the manipulation influenced the dependent measure for reasons other than that which was hypothesized. It is important to note that the latter outcome can occur even though the manipulation is shown to have a significant effect on the manipulation check measures (i.e., path 𝛄<sub>11</sub> is significant).</p>
            <p>Furthermore, this type of thinking can and should be extended to the case of multiple manipulations and to interactions between manipulations. In the case of multiple main and interaction effects on the same conceptual independent variable, the extension is relatively straightforward as shown in Figure 1, panel B. In this figure, the hypothesized main and interaction effects of the manipulations on the conceptual dependent variable are represented by the indirect paths from the manipulation and interaction dummy variables to the conceptual dependent variable that go through the conceptual independent construct (i.e., paths 𝛄<sub>11</sub>𝛃<sub>21</sub>, 𝛄<sub>13</sub>𝛃<sub>21</sub>, and 𝛄<sub>12</sub>𝛃<sub>21</sub>). Confounding effects would be represented in this model by direct paths from the manipulation and interaction dummy variables to the conceptual dependent variable (not shown in Fig. 1, panel B).</p>
            <p>In the case of multiple main and interaction effects on different conceptual independent variables, the modeling gets a bit more complicated. As shown in Figure 1, panel C, the main effect of each manipulation on the conceptual dependent measure should be modeled as being mediated by its effect on the conceptual independent variable it was intended to influence (paths 𝛄<sub>11</sub>𝛃<sub>31</sub> and 𝛄<sub>23</sub>𝛃<sub>32</sub>). The interaction effect is captured by the indirect effects of the interaction dummy variable on the conceptual dependent variable (paths 𝛄<sub>12</sub>𝛃<sub>31</sub> and 𝛄<sub>22</sub>𝛃<sub>32</sub>). Moreover, with this model, not only can the hypothesized effects of the manipulations and their interaction be tested, but so can two types of unintended effects. One type of confound is the effect of the manipulation on the other conceptual independent variable measured in the study. This type of confound would be represented by a direct path from manipulation A to conceptual independent variable IV<sub>B</sub> and/or a direct path from manipulation B to conceptual independent variable IV<sub>A</sub> (neither path is shown in Fig. 1, panel C), and it is the type of confound that Perdue and Summers (1986) and Cook and Campbell (1979) have cautioned researchers to check for. As previously discussed, the nonhypothesized effects of any unmeasured variables would be represented by direct paths from the manipulations and interaction to the conceptual dependent variable (not shown in Fig. 1, panel C).</p>
            <p>However, it is important to recognize that if the interaction is modeled in this way the interaction of the treatment manipulations on the conceptual dependent variable is driven by the interaction of the treatment manipulations on the conceptual independent variables. That is not quite the same as being driven by the interaction between the conceptual independent variables themselves. Figure 1, panel D, depicts a way to model the interaction between the conceptual independent variables themselves. In this model, the hypothesized main effect of manipulation A is captured by the indirect path 𝛄<sub>11</sub>𝛃<sub>41</sub>, and the hypothesized main effect of manipulation B is captured by the indirect path 𝛄<sub>23</sub>𝛃<sub>42</sub>.

The effect of this latent variable interaction on the conceptual dependent variable is represented by path 𝛃<sub>43</sub>. Although constraints must be placed on the factor loadings and measurement error terms for the indicators of the latent variable interaction, models like this can be estimated using LVSEM programs and maximum likelihood or weighted least squares estimators; or regression programs and two‐stage least squares estimators (see Schumacker and Marcoulides 1998).</p>

            <title>Enhanced Testing of Theoretical Structures</title>
            <p>Another advantage of LVSEM is the ability to compare complex theoretical models, involving whole systems of conceptual relationships. When the competing models are hierarchically related, a direct statistical test of the differences between the two theoretical structures is possible. But even when they are not, other means of comparison are available (Browne and Cudeck 1993). Latent variable structural equation modeling also allows researchers to conveniently compare the performance of a theoretical model across multiple populations, contexts, or times, thus making it easier to test the boundary conditions of a theory, and to evaluate the generalizability of the hypothesized relationships and/or parameter estimates. For example, comparing the performance of a model across treatment and control groups can provide insight into the effects of a manipulation on the means of the latent constructs and measures, or the slopes of the relationships between the measures and latent constructs or among the latent constructs themselves (see, e.g., MacKenzie and Spreng 1992). Comparing the performance of a model across developmental and validation samples provides insight into the robustness of the developmental sample parameter estimates (see e.g., MacKenzie, Lutz, and Belch 1986). Comparing the performance of a model across cultures provides insight into whether the estimates or the relationships are culturally specific (see, e.g., Steenkamp and Baumgartner 1998).</p>

            <title>The Ability to Link Micro and Macro Perspectives</title>
            <p>Another advantage of LVSEM is that it permits the estimation of multilevel models that integrate micro‐ and macrolevel perspectives on consumer behavior. Multilevel models explicitly recognize that microlevel phenomena are embedded in higher level macro contexts, and that macrolevel phenomena often emerge through the interaction and dynamics of lower level micro elements (see Klein and Kozlowski 2000). Figure 2 illustrates some of the potential inter‐ and intralevel relationships possible. Consumer researchers have tended to emphasize either a micro‐ or macrolevel perspective without recognizing the interaction between the two. The micro perspective is rooted in psychological research that focuses on variations among individual characteristics and their effects on individual reactions (Fig. 2, path 1). This approach implicitly assumes that a macrolevel focus on groups of individuals tends to mask the variations in individual behavior that are of primary interest to psychologically oriented researchers. In contrast, the macro perspective is rooted in anthropological and sociological research that assumes that there are substantial regularities in social behavior that transcend the apparent differences among individual actors (Fig. 2, path 2). According to this approach, it is possible to focus on aggregate or collective responses and to ignore individual variation, because it is assumed that situational and demographics factors will lead people to behave similarly.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg2" position="float" seq="2">

            <p>Obviously, neither the micro nor macro perspective by itself can adequately account for consumer behavior. The macro perspective neglects the means by which individual cognition, affect, behavior, and their interactions give rise to higher level phenomena like group norms, cultural values, segment preferences, market shares, and so on (Fig. 2, paths 3a and 4a). Here there is a danger of anthropomorphism because reference groups, market segments, and subcultures do not behave—people do. The micro perspective is guilty of neglecting contextual, social, and embedding factors that can determine or constrain individual differences (Fig. 2, path 3b), individual behaviors (Fig. 2, path 5), or the effects of individual differences on individual behaviors (Fig. 2, path 6). It is also guilty of ignoring the question of how individual behavior translates into macrolevel collective responses of interest to managers and public policy makers (Fig. 2, path 4a).</p>
            <p>Consequently, consumer research would benefit from the ability to estimate multilevel models that link micro‐ and macrolevel variables. This can be done using contextual analysis, hierarchical linear modeling, or LVSEM. However, contextual analysis and hierarchical linear modeling have three key shortcomings. One is that they ignore measurement error. Another is that they cannot be easily extended to multiequation systems at the individual (or group) level. And both require the criterion variable to be measured at the lowest level of interest to the researcher (although the predictors can be at either this level or a higher level). This means they are inappropriate for situations where researchers are interested in the joint effects of individual and group level variables on group level phenomena.</p>
            <p>Fortunately, these problems can be alleviated through the use of LVSEM. Although the technical details of how LVSEM can be used to estimate multilevel models are complex and cannot be elaborated on here, several examples can be found in the literature (e.g., Kaplan and Elliott 1997). For the present purposes, the important point is that LVSEM can be used to model the nonindependence caused by grouping factors and to estimate the effects of group level factors on individual level parameters (both latent variable means and structural relationships), while also taking measurement error into account and permitting systems of equations to be simultaneously estimated. None of the other commonly used methods of estimating group level effects can do all of this.</p>
            <p>This capability opens the door to investigating an interesting new set of cross‐level phenomena. For example, multilevel models could be used to examine the effects of group level variables like social norms and cultural values on individual beliefs, attitudes, and purchase intention, and on the relationships among these constructs. Alternatively, when studying advertising effects, a conceptual model could be estimated for all the individuals who saw a particular advertisement. If different groups of individuals saw different advertisements, one could then investigate whether the means and/or path coefficients of this model are related to characteristics of the advertisements, the media context in which the ad was placed, and so on. In other words, individuals could be grouped within advertisements or media contexts.</p>
            <p>In addition, although it might not be initially obvious, multilevel structures also occur in longitudinal studies when a time series of measurements is taken on a number of different individuals. In this instance, the repeated observations of the focal variable(s) can be thought of as being grouped within individuals so the individual himself/herself is the higher level grouping factor. This presents some interesting possibilities. For example, researchers could estimate a linear and quadratic trend in some variable of interest (e.g., attention, customer satisfaction, attitude, attitude accessibility, brand perceptions) over time for each person, and then investigate whether these trajectories are related to individual differences (e.g., cognitive ability, affectivity, product involvement, brand usage, need for cognition, global or instrumental values). Alternatively, using this type of design it might also be possible to estimate the effects of (<italic>a</italic>) a person's need for achievement, need for recognition, vanity, public self‐focus, or self‐esteem on trends in his/her attitudes toward consumption produced by repeated exposures to a particular type of television programming; or (<italic>b</italic>) an individual's need for stimulation, need for uniqueness, affect intensity, or risk aversion on trends in his/her satisfaction with a product produced by repeated usage experiences. Examples of how to estimate growth curve models like these can be found in the LVSEM research literature (e.g., Duncan and Duncan 1995).</p>

            <title>Better Assessment of Measures</title>
            <p>A final advantage of LVSEM is that it has the potential to improve scale development in the field by providing statistical tests of construct dimensionality, new indices of construct/item reliability, and more rigorous procedures for evaluating discriminant validity. Indeed, it already has in many respects, and it is now commonplace for studies developing new scales to report the results of a confirmatory factor analysis. However, progress in this area has been undermined by two problems. One problem is that researchers often fail to appreciate the theoretical implications of their measurement model specifications. Even though LVSEM can accommodate different types of measures (Bollen and Lennox 1991), often a reflective indicator model (where causality flows from the construct to the measures) is blindly applied to constructs for which a formative indicator model (where causality flows from the measures to the construct) would be more appropriate. When this happens, the desire to achieve high levels of construct and item reliability causes items to be dropped that are necessary to adequately tap the domain of the construct. Thus, content validity is needlessly sacrificed for reliability, simply because the researcher has failed to think about the appropriate direction of causality between the constructs and measures. The other problem is that researchers often ignore what is known about the reliability and validity of their measures when testing their hypotheses. This happens whenever scale scores are created by summing or averaging several imperfect measures and are used to represent the latent constructs in the hypothesis tests. The problem with this practice is that scale scores do not adequately represent the latent constructs because they ignore measurement error (Bollen and Lennox 1991). As previously discussed, this leads to some very thorny problems.</p>

         <title>Conclusions</title>
         <p>A critical examination of the consumer research literature reveals a few unhealthy trends. Too many studies overlook measurement error, even though it depresses <italic>R</italic>
            <sup>2</sup> and increases the probability of type I and type II errors. Latent variable structural equation modeling is almost never used to analyze experimental data, even though it is better than ANOVA in many instances. It is unusual to find direct tests of the differences between hierarchically related models in the literature, or rigorous statistical comparisons of the performance of a conceptual model across multiple populations, contexts, or times. It is also rare to see conceptual models that integrate micro‐ and macrolevel perspectives, even though cross‐level influences undoubtedly occur. And measurement model mis‐specifications involving a reversal of the true direction of causality between constructs and measures are all too common. Although these criticisms certainly do not apply to all consumer research, they nevertheless represent a fairly serious indictment of a great deal of it.</p>
         <p>Fortunately, LVSEM provides an opportunity to alleviate these problems. Thus, it is surprising that it is not used more often in consumer research. But what accounts for this neglect? Is it that our measures are perfectly reliable, our manipulations are uncontaminated by error or confounds, our models do not need to be cross‐validated, or that macrolevel factors do not influence microlevel phenomena? I doubt anyone believes that. Is it that LVSEM programs like LISREL, EQS, Amos, and MPlus are too cumbersome and difficult to use? Although this may once have been true, it is not anymore. Recent versions of all these programs have added sophisticated graphical user interfaces that permit researchers to specify their models literally in pictorial form, and the programs themselves now generate the commands necessary to connect the variables to the appropriate constructs, and estimate the specified relationships between the constructs. (Amos is particularly good in this regard.) Or is it that LVSEM is too sensitive (i.e., too likely to reject the hypothesized model)? Once again, although this may once have been true due to over reliance on the chi‐square statistic as the index of model fit, it is not true anymore. Recent simulations by Hu and Bentler (1999) demonstrate that a reasonable balance of type I and type II error rates can easily be achieved when a combination of absolute and incremental fit indices is used, and the cutoff criteria are adjusted as they recommend. Or is LVSEM neglected simply because a great deal of our empirical research comes from experiments, and ANOVA is thought to be the best way to analyze experimental data? Hopefully, the preceding discussion has demonstrated that this is not always true—especially when the independent and dependent variables cannot be measured/manipulated without error and/or when causal relationships among the dependent variables are of interest.</p>
         <p>Therefore, I would like to close by offering the following suggestions for improving the conduct of consumer research through LVSEM. First, model conceptual variables as latent factors with multiple indicators whenever possible in order to control for measurement error. Second, think carefully about the appropriate direction of causality between each construct and its measures, and make sure that the measurement model specification is consistent with it. Third, measure the conceptual independent variables in experiments whenever they cannot be manipulated without error or confounds, and use them as mediators in the tests of the impact of the manipulations on the dependent variables. Fourth, test your models against competing theoretical specifications, and evaluate their performance across samples, situations, and times. And finally, seriously consider whether macrolevel phenomena influence the microlevel phenomena specified by your theories, and model their influences when appropriate. Together, these recommendations are a constructive way to address some fundamental problems that have weakened consumer research for far too long.</p>
