<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reviews Martin Carnoy. Education as Cultural Imperialism. New York: David McKay Co., 1974. Pp. 378. $8.95. Mary Jean Bowman University of Chicago This polemical work argues that exploitative dominance by a ruling bour- geois class is manifest overwhelmingly in the intent and the implementa- tion of "capitalist" educational policies. This basic thesis is applied to both international and intranational relationships. In developing his posi- tion, Carnoy brings together themes that are familiar in the current radi- cal literature and have histories dating back some generations. Explicitly discarding Schumpeter's distinction between free-market capitalism and imperialism, Carnoy takes as his theoretical starting point Lenin's theory of imperialism as the inevitable outcome of capitalism. To this he adds "dependency theory" as the reflection of a broadly interpreted imperial- ism, seen from the perspective of allegedly subordinated nations. The set of postulates is rounded out with a new-old psychological theory of the "colonization" of people's minds, in which education plays an important part. This potpourri is blended in a generalized theory of capitalist ex- ploitation, which is applied to situations ranging from traditional colonial- ism in Africa and parts of Asia to the colonizing of women's minds to accept inferior status in the contemporary United States-and the coloni- zation of the minds of would-be reformers to accept the legitimacy of control by bourgeois elites. Schooling and educational policy are thus instruments for the legitimation and maintenance of power in the hands of a few nations and in the "ruling bourgeois" elites within those nations. Schools channel youth into status and occupational roles in ways that support the inheritance of privilege from generation to generation, both implemented and legitimized by tests, grades, and certificates-always distorted in favor of the children of the ruling elite. At the same time, the schools colonize the minds of students to accept designations of in- feriority or superiority that serve the capitalist class system. At the abstract (theoretical) level, this is merely a modern recount- ing of an old, perennial declamation. However, Carnoy's book is orga- 833</page><page sequence="2">Economic Development and Cultural Change nized around the components of his broad conception of the evolution of capitalist exploitation in its various manifestations. He draws skillfully- but selectively-on empirical materials to try to support his position in its application to educational policies and practices. For examples of "traditional colonialism" and the use of educational policy to build and sustain empire and bourgeois privilege, Carnoy takes India (1700-1930) and the colonization of West Africa. To illustrate dependency theory and "free-trade colonialism" of nominally independent countries, he cites Brazil and Peru. Education is asserted to be a tool of "internal colonial- ism" in the United States among whites (1830-1970) and then with respect to blacks (1865-1930). This discussion of the domestic scene is then extended by analogy to the role of the United States in ex-colonial nations since 1945. A final chapter, "What Is to Be Done?" is difficult to reconcile with the rest of the book, although it shares in an underlying common theme that could have been a more appropriate title: "Education as Colonization at Home and Abroad." Carnoy is a well-qualified economist, and he confesses that his thesis is by no means proven. However, no one reading this book could guess that he had any competence in economics. Curiously, he displays none of the concern for efficiency and productivity that haunts rulers of socialist societies; efficiency and productivity are almost bad words, that Carnoy applies only to capitalism. Although Carnoy frankly states that he is offer- ing a particular interpretation of history in polar opposition to "idealized liberal capitalism," he does nevertheless introduce occasional caveats. Quickly submerged under the main flow of the discussion, these caveats may do little more than mislead unsophisticated readers into seeing ob- jectivity and balance. Unfortunately, the tone of the book is likely to turn away more sophisticated and relatively open-minded liberals who might otherwise have been stimulated to some fresh thinking about im- portant half-truths that flow from Carnoy's pen. There are two glaring omissions from this book-given that it is a brief against capitalism and the associated educational policies and sys- tems. (1) There is no systematic discussion of what Carnoy means by capitalism and no specification of which societies he excludes from the capitalist categorization. (2) His illustrative chapters are confined to Western Europe and the United States as the imperialists and colonizers; there is no comparative material and no attempt to examine power and status attributes of other societies. Most obviously, Carnoy evades any real discussion of Russia; he seems to exclude any possibility of imperial- ist or colonizing activities in that country, international or internal. This distortion, I infer, arises from his intent to write an attack explicitly on capitalist countries of the West. But even in a polemic, a country occu- pying as important and ambiguous a position as Russia deserves careful attention. This waffling on definition of capitalism and inattention to 834</page><page sequence="3">Reviews Russia marks? most (not all) tracts on imperialism, neoimperialism, or colonialism. What might be taken as Carnoy's definition of capitalism is found in his equating of capitalist forms with the market economy and indi- vidual competition (p. 31) and then indirectly in referring to production for profit and to the development of monopoly capitalism. But, in com- mon with other writers, Carnoy then begins to back and fill, noting that recent work which builds on Lenin regards profit differentials between the advanced and "backward" economies as a contributing rather than a key factor in understanding imperialism. The emphasis is shifted to Lenin's second point: "When the whole world had been shared out, there was inevitably ushered in a period of colonial monopoly and, consequently, a period of intense struggle for the partition and repar- tition of the world." This is not a departure from the economic ratio- nale for imperialism. It is rather a rejection of simplistic cause and effect explanations based on direct profit differentials. In addition, it is an adaptation of Lenin's work to changes in the nature of capitalism and to the political reality of an "independent" Asia and Africa, the Russian and Chinese Revolutions, World War II, the rise of the United States as the dominant capitalist power, and the cold war. [P. 45] After further quotations from modern writers on imperialism, Carnoy goes on to state that the reaction to imperialism inherent in the Russian, Chinese, and other revolutionary movements plus the struggle for political independence by many other African and Asian nations introduce new variables into the relationship between the advanced and the less advanced countries. Direct control over another nation is no longer considered acceptable international behavior. . . . Much more reliance is placed on working with groups within the less-developed countries who are willing to co- operate with the advanced economy and contain any movement away from the established dependent relation. This is the model developed in Latin America by both the British and the United States in the nine- teenth century. Ironically, it was used by the United States after World War II to extend economic influence in Europe itself. [P. 46] By the time capitalist society and its imperializing, colonizing character- istics have been redefined and the nature of these processes has been re- assessed in such ways, it must surely become evident that the dominance- subordination theme contains a power theory of human behavior that can hardly be confined to the West. Furthermore, Carnoy's recurrent emphasis on education as a distinctively capitalist instrument to protect an establishment, to maintain order, and to encourage hard work at modest pay among the members of a population makes strange reading in today's world. Attempts to draw on empirical evidence to support so sweeping a theory as Carnoy espouses (or its opposite) seem inevitably to run on two main tracks: (1) assessments of motivations or of intent in the for- mulation and implementation of educational policies and (2) assessments 835</page><page sequence="4">Economic Development and Cultural Change of the actual societal effects of educational systems and their operations. Where one of these assessments might appear to conflict with the other, it is usually possible to reinterpret the evidence that seemed to run con- trary to one's preferred theoretical expectations. Alternatively, it may be argued that the dominant policymakers were too naive to recognize what the effects of their policies would be-or that they recognized this as a long-term problem only. Sometimes, in reading essays of this type, I have been struck by their similarities to Greek mythology: by anthropomorphic projection of the individual we arrive at an Olympic view of societal deci- sion making. In any case, the argument that a bourgeois elite dominates educational policies and the links between education and the larger socio- economic structure can be sustained for a market economy only by a reasoned theory of political as well as economic process. Instead of such a theory, Carnoy gives us the concept of colonization as a psychosocial phenomenon. It is a corollary that since schooling is a major instrument for this process, the teachers themselves are psychologically colonized. The problems raised for Carnoy by these questions of effects and intent are resolved most easily for his first empirical cases-cases of traditional colonialism, where there is direct intervention by an economi- cally and militarily powerful country in a weak one. It is easy enough to show, for example, that British colonizers consciously pursued a policy of educating indigenous individuals to serve as intermediaries for the establishment and maintenance of British control and British culture. Furthermore, few knowledgeable people would deny another important (partial) truth in the assertions of radical writers: Missionaries and other reformers often were used in part as handmaidens of capitalist domination under traditional colonialism, even when they were not also colonized psychologically to identify their ideals with the interests of the ruling bourgeois of the metropole. But there are contrary facts: education does liberate men to become independent thinkers and leaders; this ideal did characterize some of the educational missionaries of colonial times; and leaders were educated in "British" schools to ideals of democratic self- determination (and democratic participatory political democracy); re- cruitment to colonial schools often was open. To call this "cultural im- perialism" is one thing; to identify it with hierarchical capitalist domina- tion and antidemocracy is another. Carnoy treated traditional colonialism at the beginning of his em- pirical discussion, while the treatment of recent neocolonialism in these same parts of the world comes in chapter 7, at the end. There is a reason for this ordering: Carnoy places his emphasis on the United States as a neocolonial power, and he builds his analysis of U.S. neocolonialism on a prior discussion (in chaps. 5 and 6) of our alleged "internal colonial- ism." There is some advantage in shifting this order, however, for these brief comments. Discussion of neocolonial policies is centered around the notion of 836</page><page sequence="5">Reviews an "ideology of efficiency," and efficiency seems to be almost entirely a "bad." It is not just that there might be more egalitarian ways to attain comparable productivity than existing practices (a question much dis- cussed among free-enterprise, neoclassical economists as well as by their opponents). Neither is it just that sometimes it may indeed be necessary to pursue policies that entail a trade-off between productivity and equity --or that in any system some direct redistributive transfers will be needed. Carnoy simply does not look at these topics analytically. Hence he attributes to capitalism the sins of conventional manpower planning and of misguided vocationalization of schools, disregarding the central historic role in capitalism of nonformal and informal education. It should not go unnoticed that the policy positions that Carnoy attacks in reference to school systems and manpower planning are recommendations that have been opposed by most neoclassical, free-enterprise economists. The planning of highly qualified manpower (for elite roles in the economy and the polity) is practiced in collectivist more than in capitalist societies. It was a Balogh and a Dumont, not a Bauer or a Schultz or an Anderson or a Bowman, who advocated a reorientation of the curricula of rural primary schools to keep rural youth of the LDCs back in the villages, relieving the urban populations of the "burden" of rural-urban migration. On the other hand, there has been a vast public subsidization of univer- sity education in the LDCs-in the name of equality but often in fact as a bulwark of privilege, old and new. Carnoy might have made a much stronger case against free-enterprise capitalism on this point than he made in fact if he were willing to specify that a noncapitalist society would ration places and force those privileged to continue to forego any ensuing economic or power advantage, meanwhile keeping them in the country to contribute to the society what their schooling had enabled them to contribute. But this argument points up universal dilemmas of freedom and control, which Carnoy evades throughout his book. It is sur- prising that he disregards the less awkward cumulating evidence of the regressive impact of the financing of higher education in (almost) all countries and of secondary education in most-but this is of course not solely in capitalist societies. In the era of traditional colonialism, technologies were less complex, and production organizations were not so large in scale. Furthermore, explosive population increases were only beginning to emerge. Neither of these developments, in population or in scale of production, can be at- tributed directly to capitalism-assuming that we identify capitalism with market economies, which is as close as I can come to identifying Carnoy's meaning of the term. To be sure, capitalist society produced the basic knowledge and techniques in public health and sanitation that have lowered death rates and that undergird the population explosion. Production technologies and organization in large-scale enterprise have characterized capitalist development in the twentieth century, but col- 837</page><page sequence="6">Economic Development and Cultural Change lectivized economies are even more structured to large-scale activity- and often in principle discourage initiative among small enterprisers. A glaring distortion in Carnoy's book, as in similar works, is to disregard underlying forces that cut across types of societies. This narrowness of outlook leads to gross misinterpretations of how the dilemmas and prob- lems faced by ex-colonial nations arose. Thus Carnoy has attributed such "problems" as rural-urban migration to capitalism. Unwillingness to consider universal constraints on the pace of economic development leads to declamations against capitalism for providing good jobs-that fully utilize potentials in the dynamic sector-to so small a fraction of the populations of the LDCs. Again, the question is not raised as to whether "economic dualism" is distinctively one of the progeny of free- enterprise capitalism, or a problem of much wider implications. And nowhere is there recognition of the many voices from the United States that have long urged policies that would support the development of small enterprises in which individuals would have greater independence and scope in decision making. The downgrading of informal sector ac- tivities in much of the writing and oratory about the LDCs has been in a distinctly anticapitalist mood, in total disregard of the importance of encouraging progress and improvement in the smaller and middle-range activities as a crucial element in the depolarization of the society and the diffusion of opportunities among a population. Perhaps Carnoy's chosen postulates force him to spurn such a route to greater freedom and human dignity. Surely, a cult of collectivization has spawned social monstrosities quite as inimical to freedom and equality as any that have arisen from what Carnoy terms "idealist, liberal capitalism." The chapter on Latin America contains Carnoy's illustrative mate- rial for dependency theory. By a line of argument that will be familiar enough to readers of this journal, Carnoy posits that the status structure of Brazil and of Peru exemplify the pernicious effects of international trade and of multinational companies on the development of relatively backward nations. Similar arguments were used at one time to charac- terize the southeastern part of the United States as "colonial." Briefly stated, in Carnoy's words, . . . dependency theory argues that long-run and permanent improve- ment of the human condition in the dependent countries must-by the nature of the dependent situation-be largely limited to the dominant group in the Periphery country. This is not the result of obstacles left over from a feudal or traditional society, but the result of social, politi- cal and economic relationships prevalent in the international capitalist system: a stratified social structure, the political institutions necessary to maintain the social structure, and an economic system which pro- duces goods to satisfy small high- and middle-income groups and is able to employ only a small fraction of the labor force in its dynamic sectors. . . . Desired values and norms are taken from the metropole, not from the local experience. [P. 55] 838</page><page sequence="7">Reviews Unfortunately, in his preoccupation with dependency theory, Carnoy does not ask why some countries should respond to international trade capitalism in this way while others do not-which would seem to be crucial to his case. Nor does he take note of the marked differences among presumably capitalist countries in the degree of association be- tween occupation and education-the extremely loose relationships and wide range of occupations of university graduates in the United States and Japan, for example, as compared with Sweden and Spain at the other extreme. To be sure, local elites in many Latin American Coun- tries have exploited their positions to maintain a hierarchical system that has delayed development for the majority of the people. But surely Latin American capitalism differs in crucial respects from that charac- terizing Western Europe and (especially) the United States, even in earlier stages of their economic development. How much international trade really has to do with all this must be questioned. Perhaps we should simply look at the Hispanic heritage. This could fit Carnoy's thesis in some respects, but it would become difficult to attribute Latin America's retardation to imperialism, colonialism, or dependency. Carnoy's chapter on black education in the United States from 1865 to 1930 is so fundamentally correct, despite reasonable caveats, as to mute any critical comment. By contrast, I found the chapter dealing with the white population to be forced into a systematically distorted perspective. At no other point in the book did I find interpretations so strained, or omissions so glaring. An ignorant reader would remain un- aware of the democratic forces in the development of education, in and out of schools, in the northern colonies. He would gain no insight what- soever into the nature of the early land-grant movement in American universities, the introduction of pragmatic curricula into those institu- tions, the insistence that what was good for the lawyer or the doctor was good for the mechanic or the farmer. The importance of the "undiffer- entiated American" in the society and so in the educational system prob- ably has been matched in few other parts of the literate world. Carnoy's citations from recent articles on the United States are highly selective in the evidence shown and the interpretations quoted. More important, even if the most damning statistical interpretations are accepted, we must ask how far toward equality we have moved in the spread of educational opportunity, whether we are now moving in the right direction, and how far any (the most successful) noncapitalist society has managed to move in this respect over more than the first revolutionary generation. Despite Carnoy's ventures into history, nowhere in the book is the lack of a sense of historical continuity and change as an ongoing process so obvious as in the first of his two chapters, "Education as Internal Co- lonialism" (referring to whites in the United States). One point should be especially stressed, however: Carnoy is entire- ly correct in asserting that the spread of education is not in itself any 839</page><page sequence="8">Economic Development and Cultural Change guarantee of progressive equalization of income or wealth, in the United States or elsewhere. Empirically, diffusion of schooling can differ sub- stantially in its relation to the greater spread or the narrowing of differ- entials in income and wealth according to the starting point and to labor market policies. These interrelationships differ from one country and time to another, both within and without the capitalist fold. In sum, this is an interesting, relatively readable, and thoughtful new book on an old theme. Like most books in this tradition, implicitly (though not explicitly) it raises questions about the nature of human nature, its nonperfectibility, and the demand for power as a human trait evidenced in all societies. It displays the advantages and the serious de- fects that follow from any attempt to explain complex and diverse histo- rical processes by a general theory. Basic, but inescapable issues are skirted, as in the failure to take a direct look at dilemmas and meanings of freedom and control. Carnoy slides over the role of the state but seems to define capitalism as state-supported free enterprise-though again, this slips in and I have difficulties with just what he does mean by "capitalist society." As we come to the end of a book like this, two basic questions force themselves upon us. What sort of evidence could the author conceivably have accepted as running counter to his argument in the various times and places at which he has looked? And what policies would he accept today as having other than socially pernicious effects on all but a privi- leged segment of the population and the nations of the world? Could any present change short of all-out destruction of the existing society as the first step meet the requirements? Carnoy is not one of the most extreme of the radical writers on these matters. This becomes clear in his con- cluding chapter, though we have hints earlier in occasional caveats and even some bows to the realism of capitalist ideology (for example on p. 128). His response seems to be in two parts. First, schools reflect the society, and only a basic change in socioeconomic structures can alter the roles of schools in shaping societal developments. But how large a change is a basic change, and how does it come about? Scholars of many different political orientations agree that the crisis in the schools of the LDCs (or of the United States) today arise primarily outside of the schools. The other part of Carnoy's response is to enlist the schools ac- tively in bringing about basic social-economic change. This is to be done not by the usual changes in curricula that are favored by manpower planners on the one hand or by pedagogues on the other-even the free- school, open-classroom pedagogues of the new Deweyism of the 1970s. Rather, he would have the schools teach societal revolution, preferably nonviolent, but revolutionary nonetheless. Anything bordering on meri- tocracy is dismissed, despite the fact that recognition that meritocracy definitely is not democratic equality (which must be appreciated by 840</page><page sequence="9">Reviews every human-capital economist) leaves wide open the problem of recon- ciling equity with efficiency in provision of education for the universal dignity of human life. Before such dignity can be approximated, I infer, we must have a generation educated to a culture of revolt. How Carnoy reconciles his theory of the colonization of peoples' minds, including the minds of teachers, with using the schools to plant seeds of revolutionary change and deliberately to nourish them is a problem I leave for him to resolve. No one can deny that this book presents an elaborate interpretive web threaded into a single dominant theme. John White has provided a refreshing encouragement to simpler thinking that is pertinent here. His reference is to elaborate theories of the hidden motives of donors of for- eign aid and their skill in Machiavelian maneuvers in their own self interest: "The difficulty with this explanation . . . is that it is so exces- sively complex as to lack credibility. The assumptions which it makes about the donors' ability to perceive and act upon their own interests are so large, and the manipulations which it postulates are so convoluted, that it is sensible to ask whether there is not perhaps some simpler com- mon-sense explanation which is sufficient, and which, being simpler and sufficient, is more convincing."' 1 John White, The Politics of Foreign Aid (London: Bodley Head Ltd., 1974), p. 197.</page></plain_text>
