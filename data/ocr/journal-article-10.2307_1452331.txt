'Ali al-Lawi al-Basri, flourished during the second half of the tenth century. His surname al-Basri indicates that his place of origin very likely was Basra, in Iraq, an old important center of Muhammedan and Jewish culture. In all probability he spent a con- siderable portion of his long life in Jerusalem.3 This assumption is based on the twofold fact that he reveals in his writings a close familiarity with the topography of Palestine,4 and that he is mentioned as one of "the teachers of Jerusalem" in a statement by the eleventh century Rabbanite commentator, 'All b. Israel Alluf.5 We have no information about the private life of this author. In this respect he shares the fate of numerous Jewish celebrities concerning whose personal careers his- tory is silent.6 Of his literary activity, however, we know considerably more. He was one of the most prolific of ' The following study is the result of work done by the present writer in conjunction with his edition of Yefet's Commentary on Hosea, which is about to be published.

Unlike his older contemp orary of his own sect, Salmon b. Yeruhim,9 he was favorably inclined toward secular studies. This is evidenced from his remark on the word "knowledge" in Prov. 1.7, where he sees a possible reference "to sciences other than religious lore, such as astronomy, medicine, mathematics and similar branches of learning."I? ECLECTIC. Yefet's commentary is a veritable reposi- tory embodying many enlightening interpretations and views of authors whose works are no longer extant. That he is eclectic may be seen from his own statement, in the introduction to the commentary on Hosea, which runs as follows: "We shall now begin with the translation of this book in accordance with what we have heard and learned 7 Pinsker, op. cit., p. 169; Steinschneider, Arabische Literatur, p. 81. The statement in The Jewish Encyclopedia, III, 190a, that whether Yefet "really translated any parts of the Bible is undetermined" is obviously incorrect. 8 On the life and works of Yefet see Pinsker, op. cit., II, 181 ff.; Fiirst, Geschichte des Karaerthums, II, 124ff.; Neubauer, Aus d.

In a similar vein he writes at the end of his commentary on the Book of Daniel: "We have explained this chapter in accordance with what we have heard from the teachers of the Captivity, or read in their books, so far as those theories seemed probable."12 Thus, in an effort to select the most plausible interpretation, he cites profusely from the works of others without naming sources, except on very rare occasions. His citations are generally expressed in such terms as, "another says"; "it is being said"; "it has been said"; "many interpreters have adopted the opinion that..." It is safe to say that Yefet's biblical commentary, although it contains numerous original interpretations, is in the main a compilation into which the author has condensed the exegetic erudition of his predecessors. The manner in which Yefet either accepts or rejects an interpretation is for the most part that of a dogmatic critic, as when he says: "Many commentators have adopted the opinion that it [the verse] has an allegorical meaning wherein they differ from one another; I choose to mention what is most likely and abandon what is remote."13 "This verse has been given another interpretation which I do not record because it is remote."14 "This is the interpre- tation which appeals to me as the most likely."'5 "This "n 'PD D 1yDhV In 3ynl MiyoD mo =Dnr sDIm it-i, n7nnw inn-7n o;n01yn= rDinmn"nK 1Ys3 'p iN aom"ihl o"I y ar ^N.

(1 ;In'l); "it may be that" (1t l~D'1); "it may also be supposed" (wlr'K 5nnn1). When he cites differing renditions of a given biblical passage, he usually concludes by indi- cating those toward which he inclines most, with ex- pressions like: "but we lean toward the first interpre- tation"; "the first interpretation is more likely"; "the first interpretation is stronger and of better harmony."I7 Incidentally, the first of a given number of explanations is usually the one which expresses his preference. Thus we see Yefet taking into account all possible con- structions, which he treats comparatively, in his attempt to arrive at a satisfactory solution. He obviously scruti- nizes these with care and with a love for what he deems the truth. When he opposes interpretations, he does so regard- less of their source. He demands complete freedom for the exegete and refuses to bow before authority. From him we learn for the first time the well-known principle, enunciated by 'Anan, the nominal founder of Karaism, that one must search the Bible independently.'8 He is, therefore, a forerunner of Abraham ibn Ezra, who likewise contends for a free, unhampered exegesis. It is indeed remarkable that both employ similar terms in expressing themselves against dependence on authority.19 A close analysis of Ibn Ezra's commentary reveals his x6 On 4.19: p 1 D inK trn ' mnyPo n,oD n nK milm.

He borrows from Yefet despite his con- temptuous opinion of the Karaites who, he assures us, "lack knowledge of the holy tongue and blunder as to grammar."21 Characteristic and to the point is the obser- vation made by Joseph Solomon del Medigo who, speaking of the marked influence of Karaite exegetes upon Ibn Ezra, says: "Know that in the books of the Karaites you will find an explanation to the words of R. Abraham b. Ezra, for most of his interpretations are [derived] from their ancient [scholars], such as R. Jeshu'a, R. Yefet, and R. Judah the Persian. [Ibn Ezra] constantly draws [upon these] although he is at times like a suckling that bites the breasts of its mother."22 The tradition current among the Karaites that Ibn Ezra, who lived in the twelfth century, was the pupil of Yefet (tenth century),23 though grossly anachro- nistic, is yet understandable as a tribute to him. TARGUM AS SOURCE. Yefet follows the Targum con- sistently, although he quotes it but rarely, and then with- out specific reference. Occasionally he only amplifies the sense of the Targum by paraphrase, even where he seems to differ. Yefet's relation to the Targum as a source will best be exemplified by the following passages: "One of the sages has said that the meaning of this [Hosea's taking Gomer to wife] (1.2-3) is that he prophesied 20 See Geiger, Melo Chofnajim, Berlin, 1840, p. 77. 2I Ibn Ezra, 1. c.: o'plnp-r om lyn' 1 5Y a'p'-i npn 1lw niyD onm. 22 tnK =nDn, ed.

At the outset of his commentary on Hosea he discusses at length a matter which is briefly stated in both Talmud and Midrash, viz., "wherever the name of a person and that of his father are mentioned in connection with prophecy, it is sure that he was a prophet and the son of a prophet," etc.30 In agreement with a statement in Pesikta Rabbati, he writes that the prophetic activity of Hosea lasted ninety years.3' He quotes R. Yoianan, anonymously, when he declares, "one of the interpreters said". . . that the word rinn (1.2) is here used adverbially and that it signifies "before," that is, God spoke to Hosea before He spoke to the latter's contem- poraries.3" Yefet's rendition of inzmi (3.2) in the sense of "to recognize" is likewise borrowed from R. Yohanan.33 His rendition of almy v'in (3.1) in the sense of "jugs of wine" is clearly taken from R. Samuel.J?

He renders these verbs in the sense of "repeating" and "returning," re- spectively, and, obviously, takes them as derivatives of the talmudic 'in, "to repeat, do a second time." And sure enough, the Talmud quotes 'Ulla to the effect that znnr here is derived from the Chaldaic ,n (rr piDO hily 0NK -D0m nvDrN D116).38 TALMUDIC IDIOM. Yefet employs a great deal of Hebrew terminology wherever the discussion hinges on religious rites and customs or on grammar.39 What is particularly noteworthy is the marked influence of talmudic idiom upon the style of this Karaite. Thus, in speaking of affirm- ative and negative precepts he designates these by the usual talmudic phrase nwiyn i nlDxm nWy nlm . A person uninformed in religious laws he terms n1m. Animals which are not dedicated for the altar he denominates r,n [ = l'in]. He uses the talmudic terms nzw and i'm in the sense of "praise" and "disgrace," respectively. In a genuinely "pilpulistic" manner he raises an objec- tion only to be solved immediately by one of two answers.40 36 Yallkut, ad loc.: -nn miK 1a' 'tr -nN. 37 Pes. 50a; B. B. 75a. 38 B. B. 8a.

The very attacks of Kirkisani and Salmon b. Yeruhim upon rabbinic teachings form conclusive proof as to that.43 Consequently, despite all their effort to dis- guise talmudic influence these Karaites failed in their attempt.44 MU'TAZILITE INFLUENCE. Yefet, like many Karaites and like some Rabbanites including Sa'adyah, followed the religious philosophy of the Mu'tazilites, the sect of Muhammedan heretics founded in the eighth century.45 In accordance with the Mu'tazilite doctrine of negating all attributes of God, Yefet writes on Ex. 19.20 that one must not take literally the biblical statement that God came down on Mount Sinai and spoke; for "the Creator may not be described nor defined, and space does not contain Him. It is not permissible to say of Him that He is in the world or outside thereof, since this is one of the attributes of created things, which are contained in space and subject to accidents. This being so, there is no doubt that by saying, 'the Lord came down,' [the verse] indicates a created, defined something and a local compression [of the air] on the top of the mountain."46 41 On 2.1: on-lnN lp:mli 1f 's 'ip3P ... .lpli ~D' i'KD ,i. 42 Passim: ...

In order to explain the "word of God," different theories were entertained, the most popular of which consisted in the assumption that God creates the attribute of the word within an outer object, viz., the air, and that the word thus created becomes perceptible outside of Him.47 In agreement with this theory, Yefet makes the following observation relative to Ex. 20.1: "The Creator only produces the word in the atmosphere, as He pleases, and strikes with it the ear of those who are to hear."48 The Mu'tazilites maintained that the angels are superior to man.49 Yefet expresses this opinion when he writes on Gen. 1.26 as follows: "People are not in agreement as to the rank of the angels. Some say that they [the angels] are inferior to Adam, adducing the argument that Adam had qualities which angels lack, and that whatever is to be found in angels is likewise to be found in Adam, since he is the microcosm. Because, therefore, Adam surpasses the angels in eminence, he becomes the most important of created beings.

The tolerant al-Ghazali, who warned his pious coreligionists against hasty accusa- tions of heresy, wrote a special work to prove that the adherents of this idea were atheists, doomed to hell.53 Yefet, as a close follower of the Mu'tazilites, repeatedly distinguishes between rational and traditional laws,54 which are to be obeyed on an equal basis. He emphasizes likewise the idea that the divine laws are intended for the benefit of man. In the introduction to his commentary on Hosea he discusses the prophets and lists the advan- tages which accrued to Israel because of prophecy.

These efforts resulted in a new method of Koranic exegesis, to which was given the old name ta'wil in the sense of figurative interpretation, an exegetical trend against which the Hanbalites at all times protested."s6 In conformity with this essential feature of Mu'tazilism, Yefet persistently explains anthropomorphic passages figuratively. Sa'adyah, too, was not exempt from Mu'tazil- ite influence in this exegetical tendency, although he claimed the Targumim as his models.57 While it is true that both authors borrowed metaphorical interpretations of given verses from the Targumim and the midrashic litera- ture, it is equally true that their Mu'tazilite environment was an important factor in their method of biblical exegesis. With regard to the verse, "I will go and return to My place, till they acknowledge their guilt, and seek My face" (5.15), Yefet quotes a number of sources in an effort to arrive at an interpretation devoid of anthropomorphism: "Some of the sages [i. e., the Targum] interpreted this verse to mean the departure of the [divine] glory from the Temple...

In a refutation of Sa'adyah's allegorical inter- pretation of the species of animals mentioned in Gen. 15.9, he concludes with the following remark: "Now, if he [i. e., the head of the academy], who refutes anybody substitut- ing a figurative interpretation for the literal meaning of texts, had proceeded to render [the passage in question] literally, according to his custom in many places, he might certainly have escaped this great error."6' In keeping with his viewpoint that the biblical text is to be understood literally wherever possible, he is much concerned for the primary and natural import of the words in the Bible, toward which he frequently directs the reader's attention.62 Where, on the other hand, he is certain that a passage is to be rendered metaphorically, he stresses this by using two synonyms for "metaphor," adding that "one should be aware of its figurative signification.63 59 'b13 tn 'i9" t 33K v= y 1-zT Dnm3 y - i w n , , 7 t l 'ilp- . 60 Hoerning, British Museum Karaite MSS., London, 1889, pp. 32 and 42, cites the same rendition of nlmn in Yefet's commentary on Zech. 8.14, 22, 23. 6z Cited by Poznanski, Karaite Literary Opponents of Saadiah Gaon, London, 1908, p. 26: nr't ' ri nny~ ;rnina ,y [in,h^t DKn 'sI] Ntwo 199 ywKQ T33: ^i'Knn7 II7 ;nl:;lID y rl!oXN ij-N Ra J 'Y T i9K t4 ytbltI6 11 T1'l ;pK ?P U;r i 12JD iD U p pKc. 6a Passim: ;mnIKib 'Y ... 1' 1K nrli ... i l n;1-iN 1K.9 63 rtuyD ,'Y 1pa, ,::wn 'rInD 1m.

Yefet violently attacks Sa'adyah, the defender of Rabbinic Judaism, not only in matters of doctrine but also on points in Hebrew grammar and lexicography. He refers to him as "the Fayyumite," "the head of the academy," "who practices self-deception," and "claims to possess knowledge of the most abstruse rules of the [Hebrew] language," which "he transmits to those who listen to falsehoods- a people of fools," "he who himself lacks right direction in the ways of the lan- guage."64 Yet there can be no doubt that Yefet recognized in Sa'adyah, whom he survived by perhaps half a century, a worthy model. When we compare the fourteen citations from Sa'adyah in .Kimhi's commentary on Hosea with the corresponding comments proposed by Yefet (on the verses in question), we are bound to conclude that the latter made a searching study of Sa'adyah not only for the pur- pose of finding fault with him but also, perhaps primarily, of accepting him as a guide in biblical exegesis. For, as will be shown, fully twelve out of the fourteen passages are identical. Another noteworthy example of the extent to which Sa'adyah is drawn upon by Yefet will be found on comparing the interpretations of these two exegetes on Hosea 14.2-5. The treatment Sa'adyah gives to these verses in his Kitab al-Amdnat wa'l-I'tikddat is repeated in each detail by Yefet.6S This evidence of Yefet's reliance 64 See Munk, Notice sur Abou'l-Walid, pp. 40 f.: 4 la 4J r^J 4&lt;!JI &lt;3jL C^. 6 Sa'adyah, al-Amanat, ed.

Yefet is often blamed for his diffuseness. Yet when we consider the task before him of compiling the choice opinions on given biblical verses, we do not find this accusation alto- gether true. Only where he indulges in sectarian digres- sions and pious exhortations is it accurate to say that he is verbose. However, his digressilons are far less wordy than those of his contemporaries in the Rabbanite circles. The latter, according to Ibn Ezra, yielded to a common habit of writing voluminously on single verses. This "long and wide method" was adopted by many "great ones" of the geonic period, including Sa'adyah who "introduced unrelated ideas" into his commentaries and Samuel b. 67</page><page sequence="18">THE JEWISH QUARTERLY REVIEW Hofni who "gathered wind in his fists."66 Their books, Dukes aptly observes, assumed the character of encyclo- pedias wherein the essential theme was frequently neg- lected and was made to give way to a series of associated ideas.67 Yefet, on the other hand, is by no means to be charged with having followed such a course. He lived at an age when access to books was difficult; consequently he endeavored to write a summary of the most representative interpretations included in numerous commentaries. This will explain the fact that he either quotes sources anony- mously or, as is often the case, refrains from quoting at all. The reader in those days was not so much interested in the authorship and origin of certain views as in the views themselves.68 His simple, unadorned diction does not admit of ambi- guity. If he grows repetitious on occasions it is only be- cause he wishes to remove all uncertainty as to precisely what he intends to convey. To avoid reiteration of state- ments made elsewhere in his commentary, he simply refers to the places where they are to be found. He frequently translates connected passages which he accompanies with a relatively brief commentary, instead of expanding on each verse separately. At times he gives a general outline of a verse, which he follows up with a concise analysis of the parts thereof, as when he says, "after we have shown the order and scope of the verse in abridgment we now return to the explanation of its detail."69 66 Introduction to Pentateuch: 1iT ni ... nmi nmsiK nnmn In,T nly- Dmnr -nieKwT ', "iMM imi- 1- '7D n- pr nry, U riDD ... 0i ,:sn9 m nli 1:n sn l ~itnv :, .a ... -innn; comp.

He supplies, so to speak, missing links and reduces incongruities with the result that the text becomes more coherent. He is therefore compelled to enter now and then into long and verbose discussions justifying his interpretations. According to Yefet, Hosea addressed himself not only to the people of his own time but also to those of the past and future. Hence Yefet frequently refers to events recorded in the Bible as well as to contemporaneous religious problems. A good example is his interpretation of 1.5, "and it shall come to pass at that day that I will break the bow of Israel in the valley of Jezreel": "Herein," he writes, "the slaying of Ahab is indicated... although this [Ahab's] defeat occurred before the time of the prophet, [it is related here] by way of infor- mation as to what happened to Jezreel [i. e., Ahab]."70 For purposes of edification he does not stop short of extravagant anachronisms. He reads into the biblical text direct references to Karaitic modes of living and religious expression, as opposed to rabbinic practices. In discussing the verse, "They shall walk after the Lord, who shall roar like a lion; for He shall roar, and the children shall come trembling from the west" (11.10), he proceeds: "He [God] points out what shall become of them in the latter days, after captivity, by saying, '[as for] those people... whom I used to draw unto Myself but who refused to be attracted by Me, a time shall come when from their midst there shall arise some who shall walk with eagerness and cheerfulness after Me.' They shall roar in their prayers night and day like the lion that roars, seeking 70 'IDDim mNj 1X: ]K . . .
