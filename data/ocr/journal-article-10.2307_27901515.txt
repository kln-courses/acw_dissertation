<plain_text><page sequence="1">"CREATION" EAST AND WEST Can the philosopher judge the language of particular faiths from a more general phenomenology of religion? Mircea Eliade continues to argue that it is possible to formulate a universal theory of symbolism and belief.1 There is now a large enough body of research in the history of religions to accomplish what Frazer attempted in his Golden Bough without adequate resources. Eliade urges that we can arrive at transculturai judgments, identifying common structures and concerns. Most if not all primitive and archaic religions have creation myths. Their ritual re enacts the words and deeds of the gods in an attempt to recapture the dynamic energy of the first moment of time. Of course, meanings are not fully conceptualized, but con veyed by ritual, myth and symbol. These express the way that man understands the world and reality to be speaking to him. The sacred makes the world a cosmos, organizing experience and giving it meaning. Eliade finds that a kind of unreflective "ontology" underlies the myth of beginnings of early man. The devotee seeks to reach a timeless moment, not only to understand the way reality was originally, but more particularly to know how it is in the present. Even without explicit philosophical intent, he distinguishes be tween being and becoming, reality and illusion. 1 Mircea Eliade and Joseph Kitagawa, The History of Religions: Essays in Methodology (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1959).</page><page sequence="2">"creation" east and west 445 This paper attempts to understand the major differences in religious language between East and West from the idea of creation. Of course, such an omnibus distinction, "East and West," immediately threatens over-generalization. We propose to examine a fundamental epistemological differ ence between Hinduism and Buddhism, on the one hand, and Western theism, on the other. Chinese and Japanese thought will be considered only in their Buddhist forms. The more developed religions do not preserve the creation myth unreflectively. Hinduism and Buddhism displace the immediacy of the reactualization of "auroral time" by a comsic cycle governed by the law of karma. However identified conceptually, pantheistic, agnostic or atheistic, Indian thought denies in principle the Jewish-Christian doctrine of creation. To be sure, it has its creation stories, but regards them as timeless myths. Western monotheism gives more drastic primacy to time and history. Instead of abandoning the idea of creation, the Western metaphysics of theism attempts to make it philosophically explicit in the analogy of being. We propose to ask the consequences of these divergent developments for religious language. It is our thesis that the implicit rejection of this alternative in Eastern piety and reflection conditions language and symbols. We do not intend a defense of the Western notion of creation, but rather a typology. For a large body of Christian theologians, the idea of creation does not signify a particular point of beginning as much as a relation of dependence between God and the world.2 Of course, different theories of time and eternity appear among the various schools of thought, as between 2 This is particularly the case for liberal and Protestant neo-orthodox theologians.</page><page sequence="3">446 THE MONIST Thomist and Neo-Kantian, for example. None the less, there is a clear difference between East and West: the two religions with founders, Buddhism and Christianity, pre sent a sharp alternative in their early stages. Both leaders probed the experience of finitude and evil deeply, but with opposite conclusions. Early Buddhism is agnostic if not atheistic; Christianity preaches a theodicy. Both are existen tially aware of the transience and incompleteness of life in the world. Buddhism seeks freedom from suffering in enlighten ment. It rejects the idea of creation, however spiritualized on the grounds that the world could not have come from a good God. Gautama refused the idea of providential con cern as much as Jesus affirmed it. The Jewish-Christian idea of creation was joined to the Greek notion of participation in both patristic and me dieval scholastic philosophy. The analogy of being, found already in Plato and Aristotle, was given new dimensions by Christian reflection. As Gilson argues, Christian belief carried a more drastic sense of God's transcendence and self-completeness than had been envisaged in archaic reli gion, East or West. It affirmed a new concept of absolute being, a deity fully independent of the world and yet related to it. Analogy carried both epistemological and metaphysical implications as a descriptive reference. Basic ally, it designates likeness and relation but not identity, "similarity in dissimilarity/ ' God, man and the world have common characteristics even in radical difference. Crea turely being is related positively to deity; it opens "over out." We propose to explore the idea of analogy as the dividing principle between Eastern piety and reflection, 3 Etienne Gilson, The Spirit of Medieval Philosophy (New York: Charles Scribners Sons, 1940), pp. 42 et seq.</page><page sequence="4">"creation" east and west 447 both Hindu and Buddhist, and the Western metaphysics of theism. The Buddhist protest was directed against the Hindu idea of God, Brahman, rather than Western theism. The Eastern view of creation is symbolized by the dancing Shiva whose many arms represent his role as creator, preserver and destroyer. The world of individual existence is really Maya, illusion, perpetuated by ignorance. Creation is the sport of the gods. Only the soul, ultimately one with Brah man, is real. Shiva, the ascetic, gives understanding of this unity. Even though his arms and legs dance wildly and passionately, his face remains aloof and unaffected by the display of his own energy. No doubt, the symbol of the dancing Shiva is multivalued; yet, we may relate it fairly to Vedanta. Sankara, the chief theologian and leader of the Hindu revival following the decline of Buddhism in India, was himself a Shivite devotee. Understood in these terms, man's world as well as his vital psychic experience is a product of cosmic illusion. Becoming is just one form of non-being, even though it is in the world. The dancing Shiva helps the devotee to see through life's illusions: time and history are not taken as real as in the West. It is impossible to relate God and the soul analogically; they are one and the same while yet beyond all appearance. Buddhism's rejection of the Hindu experience of deity makes description more difficult. God, soul and the world are all denied in a sense of emptiness or "Void." It seems difficult to speak of a distinctive Buddhist religious lan guage in view of its diversity of cultus and lack of credal center. None the less, the essence of the position is clear: underlying all symbolic expression is the idea of enlighten ment, Nirvana. Buddhist practice ranges from near magic to the more extreme Zen sects. Yet, one must concede that</page><page sequence="5">448 THE MONIST the idea of Nirvana penetrates throughout all schools "even as salt pervades the sea." No doubt, questions of reli gious discipline and language have been disputed ever since the death of Gautama. Is the devotee free to proceed in the spirit of Buddha? How much is he bound to the letter of the Master's teaching? The issue became decisive as be tween Teravada and Mahayana interpretation, the latter more world affirming and widely ranging in symbol and language. We would accept the thesis that Mahayana, even though borrowing widely, still maintained its identity. Gautama as a historical person was not important. Instead, worship centered around a host of Buddhas and Bodhisattvas, the latter willing even to lose life in unselfish service for others. Later Mahayana found Nirvana manifested even in part in the present world, a revolutionary insight which reduced other-worldly tension. In spite of a drastic sense of emptiness, it affirmed that Nirvana is not simply negative. This insight more than freedom from legalism distinguishes the Ma hayana protest from Teravada and led to new expression. Mensching rightly points out that Nirvana has a place comparable with that of deity in theism.4 Yet, unlike God who is understood to have particular attributes analogically, it is beyond all description. The philosophy of Nagarjuna, the so-called second Gautama, a founder of Mahayana, ap pears to the Westerner to have reached the maximum of nihilism. Paradoxically, it was intellectually as well as religiously productive. Negation does not destroy the ex istential reference. It seems to have meaning even in its "emptiness." 4 Gustav Mensching, Die Religion (Stuttgart: Schwab, 1959), p. 12.</page><page sequence="6">"creation" east and west 449 Analogy, as a principle of structure, characterizes West ern psychology more than that of the East. It denotes dy namic unity but not identity. One reality is not absorbed in another. As an epistemological reference, it avoids both Hindu pantheism and Buddhist agnosticism. Analogy is a way of expressing the relation between the finite and in finite, the world and deity, on the one hand, and between different beings in the world, on the other. Premised on the principle of sufficient reason or what Whitehead has called the ontological principle, it explains the "rationalism" of the Western metaphysics of theism.5 The reality which is known in time has a transcending relation to being in its fullness. Understanding does not destroy mystery. It implies degrees of knowledge and being which are interrelated ontologically. The analogy of being is not primarily a deductive refer ence for predication of the divine attributes. Rather, we must appraise it phenomenologically as a metaphysical and religious principle identifying both form and content. It premises an epistemological realism based on the widest possible outlook in life and experience. Language is not exhaustive, but carries us beyond mere ignorance. Under standing seeks for unity, consistency and self-containedness. This goal remains unfulfilled at the level of immanence. Inclusiveness is possible only from a transcendent refer ence: the ultimate unity is in God himself. Religious lan guage, reflective and devotional, seeks to express this mys tery analogously, with a sense of distance rather than iden tity. Structures are identified in reality and conceptualized definitively enough that they may be examined and criti 5 Alfred North Whitehead, Process and Reality (New York: The Macmillan Co., 1929), p. 28.</page><page sequence="7">450 THE MONIST cized again and again with significant disagreement. Criti cal reappraisal makes possible growth of knowledge and new understanding. Analogy implies more than a positivistic or pragmatic basis for knowledge. In short, it allows for authentic under standing of truth. Existence, although richer than concept, must at the same time be defined in terms of the real. Knowledge is incomplete and tentative but not illusory. In mythical language, it is said that man is made in the image of God. Creation does not mean identity but difference, yet not absolute difference. Man's life opens "over-out" in dependence on the deity. Analogy makes clear the funda mental relation in being of immanence and transcendence. Man's life has its source in God. Because God, significantly other and beyond, yet sustains the world, we can speak analogically of his nature. Both Hinduism and Buddhism deny that the "transcendent" has any abiding positive rela tion to the world.6 Instead, time and with it history is finally illusory. The Greek and Hebrew sense of an abiding moral order is expressed at most in karma. The analogy of being has had a variety of interpretations in the Western tradition. Plato presupposed a rather direct image-copy relation: time mirrors eternity as its moving image. The realm of becoming has a self-transcending rela tion to the higher spiritual world of being. Doctrines of analogy based on the philosophy of Aristotle have given priority to causality rather than participation. Augustine's Christian personalism internalized the Platonic ontology, whereas Aquinas was more cosmological in orientation. For Augustine (as contrasted with Gautama), past, present 6 This is less true of the theology of such a thinker as Ramanuja; none the less, he did not affirm a doctrine of creation as in the West.</page><page sequence="8">"cr?ation" east and west 451 and future are interrelated analogously and in the end sus tained together by the power of God. Grace brings illumina tion in knowledge. Man's contingent being mirrors the living reality of God himself analogously. The Jewish Christian conviction about the discontinuity between man and God is not sacrificed. We experience what Marcel has called 44Presence," a spiritual reality which at the same time confronts and stands over against us.7 It cannot be manipu lated or reduced to thinghood. Richer than concept, it cannot be reduced merely to the world. God remains free and transcendent. The immanent categories of conscious ness cannot encompass fully his noumenal reality. Analogy means a "knowing in a greater not knowing." Mystical illumination is less important for Thomism than Augustinianism. Aquinas' chief reference is cosmolog ical rather than personal, namely, causality. The plurality and diversity of the universe points beyond itself to a self contained ground of unity. For Aquinas, the world stands over against God as a total analogy.8 God alone is the full ness of actuality; his essence and existence are the same. Unlike God, each individual person bears a tension be tween the two in his life in space-time. The tension between essence and existence in the human creature can be ex plained only from their unity in the deity. Causal efficacy proceeds creature-ward from him, although one may pro ceed from the world to the deity in tracing its meaning. Analogy presupposes a dialectic between immanence and transcendence in which the final determination is not from the creature. For Aquinas, the analogy of attribution or proportion does not stand alone without the analogy of 7 Gabriel Marcel, The Mystery of Being (London: Harvill, 1950) , I, p. 197 et seq. 8 Cf., Erich Przywara, Polarity (London: Oxford, 1935), p. 95 et seq.</page><page sequence="9">452 THE MONIST proportionality.9 The latter, which proceeds from God to man, makes clear that the final ground of all predication rests in the mystery of God himself. Aquinas no more than Augustine holds that the "ascending" relation is self-com plete without its "descending" counterpart. Philosophically insight finally reaches a point at which it is joined by reli gious experience. Analogy thus bespeaks an abiding tension between God and the world. Man in his freedom stands over against the deity who is at the same time the ground of life. Avoiding any crudely anthropomorphic, much less physical descrip tion, Western theistic interpretation none the less premises that individuality is not completely merged with the ulti mate. Deity is more than transient symbol; there is spirit ual knowledge of God in his separate self-identity. Religious symbols have a more intrinsic and lasting meaning than the Hindu or Buddhist description allows. They are not just to be "seen through," but require the most critical reading in distinguishing concept and mystery. The God who made the universe, upon whom it depends, is not identical with it. Instead, he transcends it as judge and redeemer. History and evil are not Maya. Few if any Jewish or Christian thinkers make non-being as central as in Buddhism. To be sure, the synthesis of Greek and Hebrew notions presupposed in the medieval analogy of being has been challenged ever since the Ref ormation. Karl Barth has stated the extreme Protestant position in insisting on an analogy of faith instead of an analogy of being.10 Although premising his own inter 9 Erich Przywara, Analogia Entis (M?nchen: K?sel &amp; Pustet, 1932), p. 95 et seq. io Karl Barth, Die Kirchliche Dogmatik (M?nchen: Chr. Kaiser Verlag, 1935), 1/1, pp. 257-259.</page><page sequence="10">"creation" east and west 453 pretation confessionally, Barth none the less seems to have developed a metaphysic of faith in which analogy is an inevitable reference. Appraised epistemologically, his pre suppositions are commonly said to represent a "negative Kantianism," strongly influenced by Kierkegaardian ex istentialism. Creation and with it analogy is a religious affirmation. Barth attempts to interpret analogy only from revelation, refusing all natural theology. None the less, from the time of his book on Anselm, his Augustinianism has continued to approach a positive notion of being. In abandoning his earlier Kierkegaardian orientation, he recognized the necessity of looking for interrelations which are by implication analogical. In short, in spite of epistemo logies, analogy remains as a religious concept! It must be acknowledged that modern Western phil osophers, more often than not, have agreed with Kant: the notion of creation ends in an antinomy of reason. On first view, this corresponds to the Buddhist position. Gautama like most of the yogis would have nothing to do with "origins," regarding all search for first cause as futile. Yet, more must be said. Ananda and other disciples of Buddha, like the Hindu god, Krishna, could "remember births."11 In this way, the consequences which the first causes have brought on every individual are neutralized. Enlighten ment enables one to reach back, at least psychologically, to the moment when the cosmos came into existence. The question of beginnings is not avoided as a religious issue. Suffering is overcome by retracing one's footsteps through memory to the initial moment when time first became manifest.

Concern for the sacred in evitably joins phenomena and noumena. The problem of the ground of being cannot be avoided. Western theism does not seek to return to timelessness, but instead makes a positive valuation of history based on the idea of creation. Eastern religion tends toward identity; Western theism has a normative "analogy character." Although both have been philosophically productive, neither Buddhism nor Chris tianity was intended to fit a philosophical outlook as much as to alter previous world views. We can hardly overlook their phenomenological implications for the language of reli gion, inasmuch as they represent two of the most wide spread and persistent spiritual experiences of mankind.
