<plain_text><page sequence="1">Equity, Education and Design in New Zealand: The Whare Wananga Project ANTHONY WARD, University ofAuckland WONG LIU SHUENG, Liu Shueng Consultants This article outlines the social, economic, and political aspects of educational mythology in the New Zealand context, with specific reference to issues of dominant and subordinate cultural values. It ties to these the particular program requirements for the Whare Wananga as it evolved, together with an illustrated description of the finished design. Finally, we develop a cultural- political critique of architectural theory in multicultural settings based on our experiences of the examples given, bearing in mind that issues of cultural politics are not confined to New Zealand. The example here has significant implications for the cultural politics of architectural education worldwide. Specifically, we compare the model of the cultural politics of design that evolved from this project with those implicit in the currently fashionable deconstructivist theories of design-- especially those promoted by Peter Eisenman. THIS PROJECT, INVOLVING THE DESIGN OF A Whare Wananga, or Maori university, cen- tered around issues of power, knowledge, and language in a colonized culture. The language of instruction was to be that of the Maori, the indigenous people of New Zealand, and the university was to be pub- licly funded from the common tax fund. The themes and discoveries of this project are those associated with designing in the context of indigenous peoples everywhere. In March 1988, the Community De- sign Studio at the Department of Architec- ture at the University of Auckland, New Zealand, was engaged by the management consultancy firm DMR (now CMR) to assist with design proposals for a large commercial development in the small town of Whakatane (pronounced "Fokkataani") in New Zealand's Eastern Bay of Plenty. The project eventually grew into the develop- ment of a pattern language for an entirely new town plan, which involved a consider- able degree of community participation. The unique bicultural context of New Zealand society has previously been reviewed.' This story continues where that study concluded. Some aspects of the town plan, particularly issues important to the Ngati Awa tribe, have now been implemented. Their lands were illegally confiscated in the 1870s, and their only resource is their people-a resource that is tragically underutilized. A significant 30 percent of the population of Whakatane are Maori, prima- rily of Ngati Awa descent. They represent the bulk of the unemployed and the least educated in the population. It was this lack of education that the tribal elders sought to counter in 1990, when they proposed the establishment of a Whare Wananga, a Maori place of learning incorporating university, polytechnic, and vocational courses. Based on the goodwill that was estab- lished between the Ngati Awa and the Com- munity Design Studio in the 1988 project, the tribe requested that we participate in the design of the Whare Wananga. From the in- ception of the project, staff and students of the course were assailed by colleagues and members of the general public with questions about why the Maori should have a separate tertiary education system paid for out of common taxes. These questions became so insistent that they needed to be addressed di- rectly, alongside the actual design decisions for the Whare Wananga. In response, we brought together our respective experiences in social anthropology, bilingual education, and community design to produce a compre- hensive discourse on these issues. In doing so, we were forced to confront the myth of edu- cational equality in New Zealand and its pro- grammatic implications for design. We suggest that the dominant deconstructivist theories of design operate to reproduce regimes of privilege and domi- nation despite their avowed libertarianism. Instead, we subscribe to the opposing view that the built environment constitutes a nonverbal language system mediated by mechanisms of power. These mechanisms operate to maintain a condition of cultural imperialism that aims at silencing the voices of minority or subordinate cultures in the material interests of the power status quo- that is, the dominant, Eurocentric culture. In July 1990, the Ngati Awa tribe of Whakatane proposed to establish their own university-technical college (uni-tech) in ac- cordance with recent changes to legislation designed to encourage community participa- tion in the education system.2 The uni-tech was to offer university and technical courses in a variety of subjects. Instruction was to be primarily in the Maori language, and enroll- ment was to be given preferentially to mem- bers of the Ngati Awa tribe, followed by members of other tribes, and finally to Pakeha students (those of European descent).

February 1996 JAE 49/3 1 36</page><page sequence="2">In 1988, the Community Design Stu- dio of the University of Auckland Depart- ment of Architecture had been involved with the Ngati Awa in the development of a town plan for Whakatane.3 The Ngati Awa now commissioned the staff and students of the Community Design Studio to assist in the design of the uni-tech. The project ran for the third term of 1990 (six weeks). Nine third- and fourth-year students of what was then a four-year B.Arch. course participated. Two of the students were Maori. Following the announcement of the project by the Ngati Awa, there was a great deal of negative response in the public me- dia, including accusations of "educational apartheid" and "racial discrimination."' The design team felt that these accusations were misplaced, yet represented a sufficiently se- rious factual misconception by a significant number of New Zealanders that warranted systematic refutation. We realized that de- sign considerations would be misunder- stood if we were not proactive in initially dispelling these highly charged and racially motivated myths. These misconceptions were not confined to the "outside" world alone, but were reflected in the attitudes of university colleagues as well as members of the design team. Throughout the design process, therefore, an active discourse was carried out around the issue of separatism and educational equality. This article re- flects many of the issues that emerged from that discourse, which became, finally, the theoretical basis of the design report. Power, Education, and Design This story inevitably begins with issues of class. It is unfashionable nowadays to use the conceptual category of class in any social analysis. In recent poststructural theorizing, class has been absorbed into the more gen- eral conceptual category of cultural differ- ence. Yet, it is difficult to witness the cul- tural status of the Maori in New Zealand without acknowledging that they constitute a definite underclass, formed through years of systematic and institutionalized oppres- sion and racial discrimination. Subtle forms of this discrimination can be found in the lack of access that the Maori community is afforded to sound professional services and advice-particularly to architectural advice. Other professions, such as medicine and law, acknowledge some responsibility in this respect. In New Zealand, the medical profession operates through a public health system, and the legal profession operates a legal aid system, both funded from public monies. The design professions, on the other hand, have no such system for those who cannot afford professional design services. The argument is often made that law and health are basic rights, but that architecture does not constitute a basic need. We believe that this definition of architecture is reflexive and compounds the basic environmental needs of the underprivileged by denying them access to what might otherwise signifi- cantly alleviate their hardship. In the larger sense, it also contributes to a masking of the real causes of social inequality, suggesting that they arise from a combination of sup- posed character defects and racial inferiority, rather than from the organization and distri- bution of material resources in a society structured along lines of power and privilege. At the same time, this ideology also relegates architecture itself to the sphere of the ephem- eral, limiting it to matters of visual aesthetics and separating it from issues of power and so- cial transformation. The issue of power in modern society is intimately linked to issues of property, and architecture-as a primary instrument of property's symbolic capital-is a cornerstone of the status quo power. In its renunciation of power relationships, the architectural profes- sion serves the power interests of the already- propertied. In this sense, architects who adopt an apolitical attitude unwittingly define themselves as part of the oppressing class. In much the same way, and contrary to popular mythology, education also serves the needs of the already-powerful at the ex- pense of the powerless. Just as in architecture there is no agency available to the poor, so in education there is no institutionalized system of insurance against an education that might significantly reduce students' life chances. Critical Design Process The process employed in this design has been described elsewhere and need not be elaborated here.5 However, it is important to point out that this process adopted a critical pedagogy approach in which stu- dents and staff continually attempted to de- mythologize their own beliefs about architecture, education, and racial prejudice and about the relationship between them. Such a process allows participants to identify the social, economic, and political causes of exploitation and to compare these dialectically with introspective reflection and dialogue. Teachers and students dis- cover not only the source of their own ex- ploitation, but also their role in the exploitation of others.6 To see the issues, such processes require a commitment to critical analysis and a high degree of per- sonal courage to incorporate the learnings into professional (and perhaps personal) change. Major learnings about education in New Zealand emerged through this critical appraisal of the design problem. They indicate the degree to which language is used as a weapon of domination within the education system and from there, hegemonically, to the domain of everyday 1 37 Ward and Wong</page><page sequence="3">life. Prompted by a series of public misgiv- ings, as alluded to earlier, they demanded a response, which follows. Some Public Misgivings Why Do the Maori Want a Separate Education System? Many critics of the Whare Wananga proposal questioned the need for a distinct Maori uni- tech. They argue that at the tertiary level, the educational process works equally well for both Pakeha and Maori. This is not the case. Maori and Pacific Island children are poorly served by the Pakeha-dominated education system. The facts speak for themselves. Maori students specifically perform less well in school than either European, Pacific Island, Chinese, or East Indian students. In every age group, the Maori have fewer school qualifica- tions at secondary or tertiary levels and are represented proportionately less than any other cultural group. Their tertiary education entrance and matriculation are lower, and their dropout rates are higher. The Maori have a higher illiteracy rate and are more heavily represented in unemployment, social welfare, and prison population statistics.7 These statistics are rarely used as a spring- board for investigation into the causes of Maori failure, but rather as a racially moti- vated a priori justification for the supposed laziness and racial inferiority of the Maori as a whole. Such arguments are also used against the aboriginal people of Australia and the in- digenous peoples of North and South America. This alerts us to the operation of a regime of cultural dominance and institu- tionalized racism evolving from a colonial past that sees indigenous peoples as "primi- tive" and in need of western civilization. Yet, it is precisely "Civilization" that mainstream education systems have failed to deliver to indigenous peoples and instead have pushed them into their current state of dependence and poverty. It is for this reason that since 1982, the Maori community has been attempting to establish a separate sys- tem of education that will better serve the interests of their children and will create con- ditions in which they can indeed compete on an equal footing with members of the domi- nant culture. In that year, they began by es- tablishing a system of Kohanga Reo (literally "language nests") for preschool-age children. The Kohanga Reo operate at preschool level in Maori language and Maori pedagogy. They were intended initially as a means of preventing the imminent extinction of the Maori language.8 Children in the language nests were initially taught by unpaid volun- teer Maori grandmothers and aunts, and the schools were not government-funded. Their success soon became apparent within the Maori community, which lobbied success- fully for public funding. By 1987, children from the Kohanga Reo, now fluent in Maori, were beginning to appear in large numbers at primary schools, exerting political pressure for an extension of the Maori alternative throughout the rest of the education system. The government then moved to support Maori-language primary schools (Kura Kaupapa Maori), providing a natural extension of an improved system of learning for Maori children: By 1987, the children who had been immersed in the Te Kohanga Reo for the full five years were ready for entry into the school system. School had already become the major site on which Maori language was being con- tested .... However, the emergence of a group of children who had been deliberately immersed in Maori lan- guage and practice brought into play a different set of arguments.... i) the right to continue learning in the language (as opposed to learning the language) ii) the right to attend a school which reflected in all its structures the con- cepts embodied in Te Kohanga Reo iii) the right to make decisions over what children should be learning, how they should learn and from whom they should learn.... Kura Kaupapa Maori are an attempt to transmit a reconnected and authen- tic culture to its children. Total im- mersion in the language gives access to forms of knowledge. Making decisions about knowledge gives greater control over curriculum. Constructing a school and classroom that reflects Maori values and social structures cre- ates "new" pedagogical relationships and management structures.' The Whare Wananga was seen by the Ngati Awa as a natural extension of both the Kohanga Reo and the Kura Kaupapa Maori systems. Indeed, the Whare Wananga pro- gram, as designed, included both Kohanga Reo and Kura Kaupapa Maori components (as well as tertiary courses), based on the tra- ditional Maori principle of instruction of Tuakana Teina: older Maori children help- ing and taking responsibility for younger children. Maori education is thus seen as a total system of which the university level of the Whare Wananga is a part. What's Wrong with the Present University System? Mainstream management and training struc- tures do not reflect Maori values. This is made clear by Ray Hoskins, who, reflecting as a Maori student on his training at the University of Auckland Department of Ar- chitecture, had this to say: The School of Architecture, like the rest of the mainstream education sys- February 1996 JAE 49/3 1 38</page><page sequence="4">tem, is structured around Pakeha in- terests and Pakeha determined goals. The School teaches a selection of knowledge determined by a select group of people, none of them Maori. In so doing, they have said that this selection constitutes valid knowledge for a School of Architecture in New Zealand. Hence the School, by vali- dating Western Architecture, can be seen as suffering from the ideology of ethnocentrism. An example of this was apparent this year in the Law side of Practice and Law where not one mention was made of Maori land titles, multiple ownership and Papakainga schemes or the land law related to them. These omissions were made all the more bla- tant when every form of Pakeha land tenure was dealt with, including leasehold, fee simple, unit titles, cross leasing and mortgages. Clearly a selec- tion of knowledge as regards land ten- ure has been made and validated by its teaching. Clearly by this omission, Maori land tenure does not constitute valid knowledge.,o Such examples, taken in this instance from the field of architecture, may be found in every discipline. Such systems are not only culturally insensitive in that they marginalize alternative forms of manage- ment, decision making, and training in which tribal people are already highly skilled, but they also operate as a barrier to indigenous peoples. Access is prevented to the higher levels of the social hierarchy in both business and academia where change may be effected. The essential Eurocentric form and content of knowledge produced and distributed through the university sys- tem amounts to what Martin Carnoy has called "cultural imperialism," which further disempowers the already-powerless by maintaining "informally" a process of cul- tural assimilation that is mythologized to have been officially and politically aban- doned.1" These actual cultural consequences point to the ideological basis of knowledge in form, content, and omissions. Why Do the Maori Insist on Making Even Education a Political Issue? The awareness that knowledge is ideologi- cally determined-that it is not exempt from the exigencies of class, race, gender, or culture-is one of the hallmarks of our postmodern, postindustrial society. The myth that knowledge is neutral is no longer credible. This is just as valid at the upper levels of the educational system as it is at the lower. It may even be more critical in ter- tiary education because it is from this level of academia that the educational system as a whole takes its values and criteria. Univer- sities, as the pinnacle of academic achieve- ment, symbolize and legitimize the system itself, with all of its constituent curricular ethnocentrism. It is essential, therefore, that if the system is to live up to its (mythologi- cal?) promises of equity and social justice, the changes being implemented at pre- school, primary, and secondary educational levels must carry through to the tertiary level. It is not enough for Maori Studies to be offered as an option in an otherwise en- tirely Eurocentric system of knowledge be- cause the place of Maoritanga (Maori tradition and culture) in society and its im- portance to the life of the whole culture re- main prescribed by the dominant value system. This process of hegemony occurs when a point of view held by a small and influential group of people becomes ac- cepted as common sense by the majority and hence is accepted by the oppressed to collude in their own oppression.12 Hege- mony is one of the cornerstones of the sys- tem of institutionalized racism. Any attempt to challenge racism therefore confronts our understanding of the social world that has been manufactured out of the colonial past. Attempts to reveal the mistaken logic and the real causes of racism therefore threaten the existing social stability, which is based on oppression. The cultural imperialism inherent in the production and distribution of knowl- edge is thus located in what Antonio Gramsci calls the "war of position"-that is, the struggle for the power to define the terms of reference or the ground rules of the definitions of meaning.13 Pierre Bourdieu refers to this power to define meaning as "cultural capital." Culture has an uneven exchange value, according to Bourdieu. Some (dominant) cultural values are valued "higher" than other (subordinate) cultural values. Cultural capital operates like eco- nomic capital such that those with the most capital have the greatest power to increase their capital accumulation, and those with the least capital have a diminishing oppor- tunity to do so. This leads inevitably to a situation in which the power to define meaning is increasingly lodged in the hands of fewer and fewer increasingly powerful individuals.14 The cultural exchange value assigned to differing cultural practices is thus connected intimately to existing power relationships in society in such a way as to continuously and increasingly subvert subordinate cultures through the mutually accepted devaluation of their cultural capi- tal. Won 't All of This Create Even Greater Social Division andAntagonism? We do not have the space here to undertake a complete analysis of institutionalized rac- ism in the New Zealand education system. Briefly, extreme objections to the Whare Wananga gauge the pervasiveness of such rac- 1 39 Ward and Wong</page><page sequence="5">ism, and its nuances have thus far been estab- lished sufficiently well. If institutionalized racism is to be overcome in New Zealand, it is imperative that minority peoples attain positions of power and management to gain access to resources. This implies that minori- ties must move toward positions of leader- ship within the community."15 The determination of the Maori to control their own educational resources and to reverse the 155 year process of cultural assimilation is doubtless threatening to the majority of Pakeha New Zealanders. As Dr. R. Ihaka says, "I have often suspected that the real motivation for those who advocate the use of English to the exclusion of other languages is that they themselves speak only English and would find themselves disad- vantaged in a true multi-cultural, multilin- gual society."'' The racism expressed in the media to which Ihaka was responding is but the surface expression of deep institutional forms of racism within the education sys- tem itself. Te Whare Wananga o Ngati Awa was intended to address and counteract both personal and institutional racism in the New Zealand educational system, to offer to the Ngati Awa a true opportunity of equity as guaranteed to them under the 1840 Treaty of Waitangi, and to ensure their share of economic resources. Cultural antagonism is the result of social and re- source inequality. It already exists in large measure as the negative comments of our critics show. The best way to resolve these antagonisms is to establish a system that is equitable and in which social political and economic resources are evenly redistrib- uted. The move toward some form of Maori autonomous system (Tino Ranga- tiratanga) based on Maori, rather than Eu- ropean, interpretations of sovereignty under the treaty in this sense represents a move toward greater social harmony rather than social discord. Won 't a Separate Maori Education System Cost the Taxpayers More? For 155 years, the Maori have been paying their taxes to fund an education system that severely disadvantaged their children. A par- allel system of education can be established that will actually cost less overall than the present system and will at the same time re- solve the problems of Maori children and parents. Consider, for example, a figure of five hundred people-the proposed popula- tion of the Whare Wananga. Calculations suggest that by subsidizing the Whare Wananga, the government could gain sub- stantial savings in unemployment, social wel- fare, and prison expenditures, rendering the Whare Wananga economically viable within two years. Even if the projected rates of un- employment and incarceration were reduced by one-half, the Whare Wananga would still pay for itself within five years and would, beyond that date, provide substantial eco- nomic savings to the community at large.17 Assuming, finally, that the Whare Wananga experiment were successful and provided an example for other tribal groups throughout New Zealand, the savings would be substantial-not just within the eco- nomic realm, but in the social realm also. IfMaori Education Is So Viable, Why Does It Attract Such Opposition? We conclude that an insidious form of in- stitutionalized racism exists in New Zealand that finds its most pernicious expression in education. It brings with it social and eco- nomic costs that few nations are able to sus- tain. In New Zealand, it is sustained through legislation and the allocation of educational resources. Education serves, to maintain asymmetrical power relationships in society, and it accomplishes this by main- taining an image of educational equality. It is supported by the very highest governmen- tal authority and is endorsed by numerous members of Parliament who view the Maori language as a luxury. The Maori language is not viewed as a basic cultural need of the indigenous people or as an official language of New Zealand, underwritten by the Treaty of Waitangi. Such attitudes mask a continuing assimilation policy that is sup- posed to have been discarded long ago but that finds its expression even at the level of classroom interaction. What Is Institutionalized Racism? Members of the dominant culture are all, to some extent, proponents of institutionalized racism. To say that racism is institutionalized is to say that it is habitual and therefore largely invisible to its proponents. Discrimi- natory attitudes take on the patina of com- mon sense in the eyes of a racist. Being a nonracist in an environment of institutional- ized racism is to wage a continual struggle for awareness of one's actions from the victim's viewpoint and to acknowledge one's own position of privilege and undeserved power. This is neither easy nor comfortable, and our slightest magnanimity is therefore felt as great openmindedness. Hence many racists actually pride themselves on their racial tol- erance, unaware of the deeper significance of their unconscious behavior. How Does Institutionalized Racism Work in Schools? Teachers, no less than others, are often un- aware of their racism. All of the available evidence indicates that in schools the domi- nant culture exerts an irresistible influence and that minority students are seriously dis- advantaged through the kinds of classroom interactions that operate in such a "normal" school system. Research has shown un- equivocally that the treatment that minority students experience in school is the most significant factor in their low academic achievement. In the United States, for in- February 1996 JAE 49/3 1 40</page><page sequence="6">stance, the Commission on Civil Rights (1973) reported that the majority students were praised or en- couraged 36% more often than Mexi- can-American students, and their classroom contributions were used or built upon 40% more frequently than Mexican-American students. In all positive categories the majority stu- dents experienced more interaction whereas the minority students experi- enced more interaction only with re- spect to criticism and being given directions. This discriminatory inter- action usually operates in an uncon- scious way and appears to be a consequence of the diminished ex- pectations that teachers have for stu- dents perceived as low achievers.... In short, the discrimination that exists [in schools] against certain minority groups in the wider society has often been reproduced (inadvertently in most cases) in the interactions chil- dren experience at school. The overt racism has become covert, the violence against minority children has shifted from physical to psychological.18 This psychological violence is an expression of institutional racism, albeit operating at an unconscious level. Why Should Maori Students Be Given Preference in Maori Schools? The most frequent criticism of the Whare Wananga proposal concerned the admis- sions preference given to Ngati Awa and then other Maori students over Pakeha stu- dents. Critics believed that the Maori should compete on an equal footing with other cultures for places in the new univer- sity and that staffing should be allocated on a nonethnic basis. People with these views often accused the Ngati Awa of "reverse rac- ism." The tribe argued convincingly that in the majority of schools with bilingual pro- grams (usually with a majority of Pakeha pupils), the Maori language component had acquired a marginalized "option" status, im- plying social and cultural insignificance: "Where Maoritanga [Maori language and culture] programs are conducted in a school where teachers hold strong 'deficit' views of Maori children, it is clear that a patronizing view of Maoritanga is communicated to all pupils. Likewise, in those schools where Maoritanga is offered as a club option in competition with such activities as 'cook- ery,' the message is communicated to all pupils in that the status of Maoritanga in education is neither significant nor impor- tant."'19 In instances where Maori has been used as a language of instruction, Maori stu- dents have invariably performed much bet- ter academically than has otherwise been the case. Similar findings overseas have con- firmed these results.20 Why Shouldn 't Maori Children Speak English? The second most frequent criticism of the Whare Wananga project concerned the use of Maori as the language of instruction. Critics suggested a variety of reasons why Maori children should not be instructed in the Maori language. The design team con- stantly reminded critics that the Ngati Awa had never suggested that Maori children should speak only Maori. They were clear that their young people should have ex- cellence in both Maori and English. Al- though it was proposed that Te Whare Wananga would carry out most of its in- struction in Maori, it was recognized that the acquisition of English was in no way jeopardized because all Maori children learn to speak English in the context of the wider society. The value of mastering both lan- guages was, on the contrary, widely ac- cepted: "Throughout human history the ability to speak several languages has always been regarded as a mark of culture and in- telligence. In the past, elite groups have en- sured that their children would acquire competence in two or more languages, and in most countries this is still the case."21 Why Is It Important to Teach Other Subjects in Maori Rather Than English? Any response to this question must be seen in the context of the history of language loss and the historical role of the Pakeha school system in this process. Until the urban drift of the Maori, the language and oral history of the culture struggled to survive. The Marae setting undoubtedly helped to keep the Maori language alive, even in the face of strong prejudice from the school system which permitted only English.22 Maori was often spoken at home, although parents were encouraged by teachers, ignorant of the value of bilingualism, to speak to their children in English. Parents became confused about whether to insist on children's speaking Maori or to accept that the more Maori chil- dren knew, the more abuse and difficulty they would likely encounter at school. Be- lieving that education offered their children the best opportunity for a better future, they accepted the words of the teachers and sacri- ficed their children's heritage language. In doing so, they failed to realize the further obstacles that they were placing in the way of their children's emancipation. Neither the Eurocentric teachers nor the disempowered parents understood the academic benefits of maintaining and increasing fluency in one's first (heritage) language: "Understanding new ideas is difficult enough at the best of times. It is doubly difficult when the ideas are presented in a language you do not un- derstand well. Presented with such a situa- tion most children will switch off. A pattern of failure quickly becomes established."'23 1 41 Ward and Wong</page><page sequence="7">This seems obvious. What is not ob- vious, however, is that not only is learning in a first language easier than learning in a second language, but it also carries advan- tages for the second language: "Having a strong foundation in the native language makes learning a second language both easier and faster .... Moreover, there is gen- eral agreement that knowledge transfers readily from one language to another, so that students do not have to relearn in a sec- ond language what they have already learned in a first. In fact it is clear that the ability to transfer to English what is learned in the native language applies not only to content area subjects like science and math, but also to skills in reading and writing-- even when the orthographic system is quite different from the Roman alphabet."'24 All of the overseas research in bilingual education demonstrates unequivocally that students learn better in their native tongue than they do in their second language. In Jim Cummins's exhaustive review of research into both bilingual and second-language immer- sion programs, he details the mythologies surrounding bilingualism and demonstrates conclusively that bilingual children perform as well and often better than monolingual children in a wide range of subjects. Being taught mathematics or science in one's first language seems to have a distinct advantage, not just in specific subjects, but in general comprehension-that is, in the student's ability to create appropriate models of social and physical reality. Why Is Language So Important to Sociocultural Learning? There is a compelling argument to be made that minority language students actually benefit not just academically, but socially from instruction in their first language. This is undoubtedly true in a Maori context, where results from existing Kohanga Reo programs and more recent Kura Kaupapa Maori programs demonstrate a marked im- provement in comprehension and language skills among Maori children. What is more, these programs allow children to learn the language of their identity. Not only are the language skills developed with a sense of pride and belonging through distinctly Maori (noncompetitive) pedagogy, but the medium of the language is itself congruent with the cultural values it imparts. Consider the situation of the mod- ern, urban Maori. For a great number of these students, English is their first lan- guage and Maori their second. The sugges- tion has been made that for these students English should remain the language of in- struction. This suggestion ignores the fact that verbal language is but one aspect of culture, albeit an important one, and to have lost one's heritage language is to have lost something profound. Irrespective of age, access to the student's own language opens the door to his or her history, family, culture, ethnic worldview, and self-image. There can be no doubt that a stable and positive self-image is an indispensable pre- requisite of academic as well as social achievement. In the context of the minor- ity child, this positive self-image can only be acquired through the learning of the heritage language. There is very strong evi- dence to suggest that students learn better in the context of their own indigenous cul- ture, of which verbal language is but a con- stituent, reflective part. Expecting minority children to achieve well in a second lan- guage necessitates the affirmation and rein- forcement of cultural and first-language identity. The advantage of educating stu- dents in their heritage language can be ex- tended even further by increasing community involvement in the educational process.25 This is particularly true when the learner's cultural identity is tribal. Why Can 't All of This Be Accomplished in Existing Schools? We have already mentioned how Maori lan- guage programs in existing schools have struggled against marginalization, but there is another reason why such programs are not practicable. They presume a uniformity of Maori language that does not exist. There is no such thing as the Maori language. There are Maori languages. Different tribes use different words to mean the same thing, and often the same word can mean quite differ- ent things in different tribes. Until the com- ing of the Pakeha, there were no "Maori." There were the Ngati Awa, the Tainui, the Ngati Whatua, and so on. The word Maori simply means "normal people," and it was incorrectly taken by the European coloniz- ers as a pantribal referent. The overlay of na- tionalistic programs on the tribal society of the Maori carried enormous implications for the education of Maori children, who were forced to choose between their histori- cally rooted self and their emergent "New Zealander" self: "To survive, many Maori people have developed a kind of schizophre- nia. On the one hand to succeed in Pakeha society you often have to forgo the essence of yourself which is Maori. On the other hand, to succeed in Maori society you have to recall that essence.'"26 Until quite recently, the pressure upon Maori children to abandon their heritage language was backed by the full force of the law and by a primitive education system. The abo- lition of corporal punishment for Maori schoolchildren who would speak their own language in school is only a relatively recent event. The sys- tematic racism of a Eurocentric school curriculum and pedagogy re- mains at odds with Maori culture and values and is a leftover from defunct February 1996 JAE 49/3 1 42</page><page sequence="8">assimilation policies of the last 150 years: There is no doubt that the ini- tial overt purpose of the schooling that was provided for Maori people was to assist in the assimilation of Maori society. The dealings of the native land court and the economic activities it fostered sought to destroy the more visible aspects of Maori life, such as the ownership of lands, the power of the chiefs and the physical well-being of people who attended the court sittings. Although its rulings and other effects of land legislation struck deep into Maori society, it met and conducted its business in centers away from the day to day activities of most Maori communities . . . Schools, however, were placed in the heart of Maori communities like Tro- jan horses. Their task was to destroy the less visible aspects of Maori life: beliefs, value systems and the spiritual bonds that connected people to each other and to their environment. They were to be replaced by new sets of val- ues, attitudes and behaviors. These were not quite the same ones being taught to Pakeha children, for Maori children also needed to be educated into their place in society based on class stratification and exploitation.'"27 This implicit stratification became an inte- gral part of the dominant ideology of the school, and it persists in somewhat less ob- vious forms today. Throughout the last 150 years, Maori children have been unrealisti- cally expected to achieve at the same levels as Pakeha colleagues, who are isolated from the racism and other educational impedi- ments that have been the lot of the Maori. When they have understandably failed in this uneven competition, they have then been categorized as problematic. Isn t All of This Their Own Fault? Maori children have been considered to be problematic in the present system. Their poor achievement levels in Pakeha-centered skills and tests have reinforced racist stereo- types of intellectual inferiority. Maori chil- dren became "deficient" within the system, and they needed their deficiency "made up" by remedial English work. The "deficit" policy of the sixties was ideological in that it focused on the Maori child as a "problem" for education while concealing the bias in favor of Pakeha dominance that was inher- ent in the education system itself. This process, known as "blaming the victim," was first described by William Ryan in 1972 with reference to the education of African-American children in the United States.28 The process of blaming the victim is applied to welfare recipients ("too lazy to look for work"), the unemployed ("dole bludgers"), alcoholics ("can't hold their drink"), the violent ("still savages"), the homeless ("can't hold down a job"), the sexually harassed ("anyone wearing such a short skirt is asking for trouble"), and a host of other disadvantaged and disempowered people. Cummins has graphically illustrated how the process works in the realm of edu- cation. He shows how coercive instruction in a person's non-native language masks a co- vert desire to colonize indigenous and non- English-speaking peoples of subordinate cultures and to promote the dominant culture's value system as a normative enter- prise. These processes lead to high failure rates among the underprivileged, and these failures are then taken ipso facto as evidence of their supposed intellectual inferiority, thus reinforcing racially motivated stereotyping.29 This system of blaming the victim rein- forces the victimization processes themselves. Minority children coping badly with their oppressive school environments have been given more remedial English, which only fur- ther diminishes their capacity to cope, despite evidence supporting bilingual programs. Isn't Maori Culture Going to Die Anyway? There is a terrible irony in all of this. For 150 years, the Maori have been asked to contribute their time, their energy, and their taxes to a system that victimized them. They have been asked to participate in a system that has been set up to disempower them through the systematic erosion of their culture by a process of (assimilating) education. This has been done even though their language and their culture was pro- tected and guaranteed under the Treaty of Waitangi: "In 1985 the Wellington Maori Language Board-Nga Kaiwhakapumau i Te Reo-submitted to the Waitangi Tribu- nal that the Maori version of the Treaty of Waitangi clearly provides protection for the language. The Board pointed out that many current laws directly violate the Treaty in this regard."30 The Tribunal also found that: "the crown did promise to rec- ognize and protect the language and that promise has not been kept."31 Ever since the Treaty of Waitangi was signed in 1840, all of the resources that the Maori have con- tributed have been used to ensure their cul- tural assimilation. Now, when they have finally decided to develop their own system of education within the framework of the law, members of the dominant Pakeha community are expressing anxiety about "apartheid." Such comments are ill-in- formed. As Ihaka has pointed out, "Apart- heid is a system designed by the whites of South Africa to ensure their economic su- premacy and to subjugate the black and colored cultures of that country. ... Those working at building a Maori-based educa- tional alternative are striving towards lib- eration and empowerment for people who are likely to be placed and kept in an infe- rior socio-economic position by a failed 1 43 Ward and Wong</page><page sequence="9">educational system. Surely it is those who advocate a continuation of a system which places many Maori at a socio-economic dis- advantage who should be likened to the ar- chitects and maintainers of apartheid."'32 Most scholars now acknowledge that the Treaty embodied issues of a partnership between Maori and Pakeha. This issue of partnership is very important because it implies an equality of culture and a sharing of power and resources. The Maori signed the Treaty as equals, and they now insist that aspects of this equality be applied to the allocation of educational resources. Isn't Maori a Dead Language? The importance of Maori language and cul- ture has been recognized in the acceptance of Maori as an official language of New Zealand. Government departments are now mandated to conduct their public business in both Maori and English. Yet, many crit- ics of Maori bilingualism still base their ar- guments on its apparent inappropriateness to the modern world. They suggest, for in- stance, that the language cannot be used as a medium of instruction in schools because it is not capable of expressing technological terms. Such critics often refer to the lan- guage as "simple" and "primitive." This is not the case. With the establishment of the Maori Language Commission, the Maori language is being extended to include words of this modern technological age. All lan- guages, when in current use, naturally evolve in this way. It is once again ironic that the Maori, historically deprived of the capacity to use and hence to evolve their language, are now blamed for having a lan- guage locked in a historical and rural con- text. There is every reason to believe that given expression and support within the New Zealand educational system and with the support of the Maori Language Com- mission, the Maori language will itself grow to encompass the needs of a technological age. Finally, Maori is a language that is rich in poetic metaphor. It is an expressive lan- guage with evocative nuances of meaning characteristic of the spoken words of many preliterate (prelinear) cultures. It is a sacred element of Maori culture-a taonga-re- vered and prized for its beauty and power. We believe it is worth learning and saving for this quality alone. Can Maori Be a Language of Commerce? Critics also suggest that the Maori language has no place in the modern world of com- merce. The logical extension of this argu- ment is that for the commercially minded student, learning Maori is a waste of time, that anyone involved in the world of com- merce should not learn to speak Maori. Japanese or German are often suggested as more commercially useful languages. There is nothing to prevent the fluent Maori speaker from also becoming fluent in Japa- nese or German. The acquisition of Maori not only reinforces what it means to be a New Zealander, but also establishes skills for the acquisition of other languages, in- cluding Japanese, German, and French. We predict that in the next decade, being a New Zealander will mean speaking both Maori and English. The Ngati Awa proposal is proactive in the light of emergent New Zealand linguistic diversity. The suggestion that students of com- merce should not speak Maori has more sin- ister connotations, however. The suggestion that Maoridom should abandon its heritage language at the precise moment that it is be- ginning to acquire a significant resource base (together with the economic muscle that this can bring) speaks to an underlying imperative to prevent the true empowerment of the Maori. A powerful but culturally alienated Maori will not threaten the status quo eco- nomic power structure of New Zealand for the simple reason that their entrance fee to the upper levels of the social hierarchy is as- similation into the dominant culture. The cost of success is their alienation from the broad spectrum of the Maori community. The government of New Zealand, for in- stance, no longer negotiates with the true representatives of the tribes, but with govern- ment-nominated "spokesmen."33 In this way, the control of resources may be confined to a small and elite social group that speaks only English, rather than being more equitably distributed throughout society at large. We suggest an alternative scenario. As more young Maori students are educated in their own language, debate about the distri- bution of resources becomes more possible within the language itself, which few Euro- peans understand or speak. Such a process implies a reversal of the normal power rela- tionship with respect to resource ownership and allocation, and it is for this reason pri- marily that the dominant culture actively fears the growth of the Maori language in the field of commerce. It potentially places the Pakeha in a position of real disadvantage and economic vulnerability. We predict that within twenty years it will be necessary for the Pakeha executive class to learn te Reo Maori if they are to survive commercially. What is at stake in the struggle over bilingual education programs is the definition of nationality itself. Proponents and oppo- nents have conflicting definitions of patrio- tism. Its proponents (who are characterized by its opponents as "unpatriotic") see nation- alism as a more egalitarian, more diverse phe- nomenon that celebrates and accommodates cultural difference and in which material re- sources are more evenly distributed across so- ciety. Opponents of bilingualism, on the other hand, have a narrower view of what it means to be a New Zealander. Their view ul- timately seeks the eradication of cultural dif- ference and the assimilation of ethnically February 1996 JAE 49/3 1 44</page><page sequence="10">diverse groups into the essentially European way of being and doing and perceiving. It is the voice of institutionalized racism. Reflections on the Issues Such were the issues with which we, as a de- sign team, were constantly confronted during the Whare Wananga project. We did not set out initially to address the ideological and po- litical questions raised by the project in the minds of New Zealanders. However, the ques- tions were so insistent and so deeply lodged, not only in the "outside" community but also among the members of the design team itself, that we were compelled to look for answers in order to achieve and maintain some sense of our own integrity and purpose. Indeed, we are able to articulate these questions with clarity now only because they formed the basis of much of the heated dialogue among the mem- bers of the design team. It was in this sense that the project worked as much as an instru- ment of our own consciousness-raising as it did to articulate the programmatic and spatial needs of the Ngati Awa themselves. Its educa- tional scope extended beyond that of the typi- cal studio program in which students and in- structors produce designs without challenging their own experiences and convictions. The project also challenged normative conceptions of what properly constitutes architectural de- sign and process, a topic addressed in the fol- lowing section. The Studio Experience By the end of the design project, everyone involved was better informed about the cul- tural politics of language acquisition and of the relationship between power and knowl- edge. What was learned had a dramatic im- pact on our design considerations. Because of its inherent "reality," the Whare Wananga project placed important design and time constraints on the students. The project itself lasted for only six weeks, and all of the design work, the community meetings, and the process of self-education had to be completed within this time frame. As in more usual projects, students were first expected to complete a compre- hensive analysis of the site conditions. The site itself was located on the banks of the Whakatane River, some two miles north of the town. The Whare Wananga was to be located in the partially disused lumber mills and on adjacent farm land (Figure 1). The mill was built on land confiscated from the Ngati Awa during the so-called Maori Wars of the 1870s, and archaeological studies have revealed a significant Maori presence on what was one of the few high points in the river's earlier flood plain.34 The continu- ing operation of part of the lumber mills constituted a serious noise problem for a proximate learning environment, and the students spent a considerable time recording noise levels at various critical locations on the site (Figures 2 and 3). The existing buildings comprised part of the original 1915 East Coast Dairy Co- operative, which was opened by the then prime minister (Figures 4 and 5). These were, for the most part, constructed in rein- forced concrete of one, two, and three sto- ries and were in a good state of preservation. The whole site development included the possibility of cradle-to-grave education for all academic abilities, with a Whare Rapuora (health clinic), a Kohanga Reo, a Kura Kaupapa Maori, a technical college and a university, together with a collection of Kaumatua (elders) flats. The proposed design was laid out along a "noise gradient," with those parts of the Whare Wananga that were noisiest-light engineering, panel- beating, paint spraying etc.-located closest to the operating board mill, and those most sensitive to noise intrusion-the Whare Pukapuka (library), teaching and seminar spaces, the Kohanga Reo, the Kura Kaupapa Maori, the Whare Nui, and the Kaumatua flats-were located farthest away (Figure 6). The side of the teaching blocks closest to the operating board mill were shielded from oc- casional high-frequency noise emissions by 1.

This "heart" was flanked to the north by the library, to the east by the rec- reation center and the teaching blocks, and to the west by the student common room and Whare Kai (cafeteria). Beyond the Whare Kai and connected to it was the Marae Atea and Whare Nui, where guests could be welcomed and accommodated overnight in the Maori tradition. Beyond these and reaching out to the quietest areas of the site along the riverbank, were the Kaumatua flats, the Whare Rapuora, and the children's areas. At the extremity of the western boundary and on the bank of the river was located a Whare Whakairo, or carving school-the most sacred and tapu of the campus activities. The whole campus was linked across the river to the nearby suburban residential areas by a pedestrian foot and cycle bridge (Figure 8).

These were joined by an atrium that could serve as a meeting place for the whole community of the Whare Wananga (an important aspect of Maori pedagogy that relies on consensus decision making involving the entire population of the institution) (Figures 9 to 11). Critical Reflections on Design Theory All of the foregoing may seem at first sight to be entirely straightforward and not unlike an "ordinary" studio program. The difference here was partly in the student-client relation- ship: Staff and students spent several week- ends meeting and sleeping over communally with the clients in the traditional Whare Nui (meeting house) context. It was also unique in the real-world context in which the design took place. The deeper significance of the project, beyond the issue of racism, lay in the decision made about the expression of "Maoriness" in the design. As the project progressed, we became increasingly aware that just as verbal Maori language (which we were trying to promote and house) repre- sents a separate and different cosmology, so does Maori architecture embody a language system that is equally expressive of this dif- ference. The question we had to ask our- selves as designers was whether (since we were incapable of conversing in the Maori language) it was impertinent to assume that we could design in a Maori architectural lan- guage. It was here that the cultural imperial- ism of normative architectural meaning came into full force, casting a revealing light on the political and ideological deficiencies of current design theorizing such as those advocated by Peter Eisenman. It is particularly interesting to note that Eisenman has himself described architec- ture as a kind of second language. In his con- tribution to Marco Diani and Catherine Ingraham's 1988 book, Restructuring Archi- tectural Theory, Eisenman likens architecture to a second language-a language learned secondarily to one's mother language, or heritage language.35 In so doing, he aestheticizes language, as though "English as a second language" were a neutral artifact separate from the processes of social and cultural domination. All of the available evidence points to a contrary conclusion. Furthermore, by relegating architecture to the status of a second language, Eisenman seems to be suggesting that it is of a lower order of cultural importance in the process of cultural identity formation than are ver- bal language systems: "The word 'second' in this context does not mean merely to come after in a temporal sense because the idea of a first language or mother tongue implies an originary and even moral value. Thus the idea of a second language suggests the absence of these values as a negative condition.'"36 This suggests a very limited and limiting understanding of the conceptual category architecture, which effectively sepa- rates its practice from the reality of everyday life and brackets it as a special and privileged February 1996 JAE 49/3 148</page><page sequence="14">form of social and cultural activity. It also reflects a misunderstanding of the process of identity formation itself. A child growing up "reads" environmental clues to social behav- ior as he or she does verbal clues. Indeed, the two are often inextricably linked, such as when a verbal prohibition against certain forms of behavior is directly associated with physical arrangements of space. In a tribal society that does not recognize western con- ceptions of private property, for instance, spatial arrangements and boundaries may be "read" quite differently from those in Euro- pean culture, often leading to major cross- cultural conflict and misunderstanding.37 Eisenman concludes that architecture is like a second language because it operates as a text, meaning not "the representation of a narrative," but rather "the representation of the structure of the form of the narra- tive." In other words, "no longer something complete, enclosed in a book or its margins, it is a differential network. A fabric of traces referring endlessly to something other than itself." In this latter sense, text "displaces the conventional" or the "natural" idea of the literary work. Whereas the concept of text as the structure of the work referred inwardly to the work itself, text in this sense is a fun- damental condition of displacement; it de- pends on no terms of internal reference such as structure. It is neither a complete work nor a meta-language. It is not a "stable ob- ject" but a process, a "transgressive activity which disperses the author as the center, limit and guarantor of truth."38 Using this rather special definition of text derived from Derrida, Eisenman devel- ops the idea of architecture as a strategy of dislocation. He suggests that architecture is essentially multivalent, that it embodies no one particular meaning, that it reflects and expresses a multiplicity of values that oper- ate parallel to the original narrative or struc- ture of the form. He suggests that this represents a radical departure in theorizing about architectural form that is at odds with the normative category of architecture- that is, of the production of visual art ob- jects as works of individual creative genius.39 Against this, he promotes not the notion of architecture as a collective enterprise with deep cultural and political meaning and sig- nificance, but an architecture of meaning- lessness that "does violence to the former celebrations of architecture as an object of desire (of an aesthetic pleasure); as a reification of man (anthropomorphism and human scale); as an object of value (truth, origin and metaphoric meaning). Such a between text is not place specific, time spe- cific or scale specific. It does not symbolize use, shelter or structure. Its aesthetic and history are other. Its dislocation takes place between the conventional and the natural. Thus, what is being violated is the mainte- nance of the system as a whole."40 This theory seems revolutionary-- promising to undermine established aes- thetic norms. Instead of replacing the architectural meanings of a privileged class with another set of classless meanings as modernism tried to do, it attempts instead to define an architecture that is itself meaning- less, expressing nothing but pure form, rep- resentative of nothing but itself. It seeks to avoid the trap awaiting most designers: re- producing the circumstances of their own social and cultural conditioning.4" As the New Zealander Mark Wigley put it in his introduction to the Deconstructivist Archi- tecture Exhibition at the Museum of Mod- ern Art in 1988: "The disquiet (of Deconstructivist designs such as Eisenman's) is not produced by some new spirit of the age; it is not that an unsettled world pro- duces an unsettled architecture. It is not even the personal angst of the architect; it is not a form of expressionism--the architect ex- presses nothing here. The architecture only makes it possible for the tradition to go wrong, to deform itself. The nightmare of deconstructivist architecture inhabits the un- conscious ofpureform rather than the uncon- scious of the architect" (emphasis added).42 Pure form, in this context, may be taken to mean the form that strikes to the heart of the unconscious, bypassing expectations, dis- rupting habituated thought and behavior, and forcing us to recognize our social and cultural conditioning. This suggestion that form can be pure, can remain uncontami- nated by any ideological baggage, alerts us to nonreflexive thinking. The theory is nothing less, of course, than the repackaged concep- tion of the old Kantian transcendental art, which under critical analysis is revealed to be a tool that the dominant culture of the sev- enteenth century designed to preserve their cultural capital in the face of a rising indus- trial bourgeoisie.43 There are strange, modernist echoes in Eisenman's high-sounding theories- echoes of an International Style that tran- scends context and repudiates history. It would seem, indeed, that he is acting in bad faith simply because his own theorizing, while purporting to undermine dominant cultural ideologies, in fact extends and rein- forces them. This other aesthetic and his- tory to which Eisenman refers bears a greater resemblance to the high architecture that he criticizes than it does to any other cultural tradition. As Vincent Pecora notes elsewhere about Eisenman's attempts to "disrupt" architectural meaning, "There is no explanation of how this 'new, modern dialectic' between unifying and fragment- ing, meaningful and meaningless form is any more critical or any less ideological, than the supposedly monolithic humanist synthesis of form and function. . . . it is merely naive to believe that such a gesture is either new, critical, anti-traditional or even intellectually honest. For in the end, 149 Ward and Wong</page><page sequence="15">Eisenman proves himself the most moral of all: unlike the fallen, he remains true to the only great love 'real' architects have ever rec- ognized-lady architecture herself. Criti- cism becomes apotheosis."44 This is why Eisenman's theory is eventually reduced to a discussion of the in- terplay of style, of surface elements, and (most important) of the dominant cultural interpretation of what constitutes this thing called "architecture." Eisenman's notion of architecture as a dislocating text is presented as a more truthful representation than the theory of building as an expression of singu- lar meaning. However, he attacks a straw man that he himself has constructed. The notion of a univalent architecture that he attacks is itself the product of the privileged and elitist architectural theorizing in which he is but the most vocal current spokesper- son. By tearing the issue of meaning from its cultural, social, and political roots, he con- tinues a tradition through which the archi- tectural profession has historically defined itself. The issue is not one of how the domi- nant culture can disrupt its own meanings, but how subordinate cultures can empower themselves in the shaping and control of their own environments. To do this, it is imperative that they break the hegemonic stranglehold that the professions maintain over what precisely constitutes medicine, law, and architecture (as opposed, for in- stance, to "mere" building or to that marginalizing subcategory, vernacular).45 The Commodification of Design Since the thirteenth century, beginning with the initial distinction between architect and master mason, the burgeoning division of labor wrought by the emergence of capi- talism created two juxtaposed streams of commodified building production.46 Archi- tecture-as-art and building-as-science have became increasingly distinct and often an- tagonistic domains of professional activity, each jealously guarded. It is this division that lies at the root of Eisenman's theories of what properly constitutes the category, ar- chitecture. It is a division that is also rooted in the dynamics of class distinction, which took on sharper focus in the seventeenth century, when the English upper classes saw their status and power being eroded by an emergent nouveau riche whose power base was that of developing rationalism, science, and industry. Whereas the scientific life was concerned with the advancement of knowl- edge, the artistic life was established as a su- perior form of knowledge, associated with timelessness and transcendence.47 Art in the modern sense was coupled with truth, and this truth was nothing less than the old cosmological and social order, which was itself reflexively confirmed as su- perior by virtue of its connection to the transcendent. To sustain itself in the face of encroaching Enlightenment rationality, this truth was wrapped in a cocoon of logical mystification designed to mask its power origins.48 Mystification thus became an es- sential part of the concept of art, and it con- tinues to be up to the present. This is why notions of design associated with art, such as those promoted by Eisenman, also mani- fest an essential process of mystification de- signed to mask their relationship to regimes of power. The normative understanding of the category architecture, insofar as it aligns itself to art, operates instrumentally to re- produce existing hierarchies of power and to reflexively locate the architect close to the apex of that hierarchy. The distinction be- tween architecture-as-art and building also expresses and reproduces the classist separa- tion between manual and intellectual labor. This becomes very clear when we consider possible alternative meanings of the cat- egory architecture, especially in the context of a precolonized culture like that of the Maori. There, no such distinction existed, and the conception and execution of the building form were indivisible. They were a collective enterprise and expressions of deep, collective meanings tying the identity of the present generation intimately to their tipuna, or ancestors. The process and the language of the process were transparent: They embodied well-known stories that were integrated with the stories of the present generation to cement the indivisible link to the past. In the case of the modernist or postmodernist conception of architecture- as-art, these links have been consciously broken, and the language used is severed from its historical and cultural roots. Under these circumstances, architecture is con- demned to that which must be continually novel, and its mission is not to acknowledge or celebrate the past, but to eliminate it. This demand for novelty, which David Harvey and others have called the "creative destruction" of modernism,49 is nothing less than the expression of consumer capitalism, which from the fifteenth century has been synonymous with the colonization and ex- ploitation of indigenous peoples. It is the force that requires that art (modernist art, that is) not only be novel, but also develop a reflexive critique from which its required novelty might draw. The avant-garde em- bodies this continual dialectic on the cat- egorical boundaries of art, which it simultaneously draws and polices. However, the avant-garde never actually challenges the existence of the category itself because to do so would be to undermine its own validity. Yet, as some art historians have noted, "So- cial art history tends to see any claim that art has a special language of its own as a smoke screen for the deeper social reality that sup- ports it. By stripping art of its autonomy, February 1996 JAE 49/3 1 50</page><page sequence="16">social history is able to regard works of art as illustrations of sexual oppression, class war, imperialism or the ruling ideas of a par- ticular age. But too much stress on the so- cial aspect of art ignores the qualities which make it art rather than something else. A different kind of dissolving is found in the new theory, which defines art as one of the major fictions in the grand fiction of West- ern metaphysics."50 In adopting his avant-gardist position in architectural theorizing and practice, Eisenman thus not only acts conservatively to reinforce and maintain the dominant cultural position that he holds, but he does so under the pretext of disrupting it. The profession continues to peddle its elite cultural and sym- bolic capital through the self-referential sig- nature building that appears to challenge the status quo but that in reality insidiously un- dermines resistance. Eisenman would like to "violate the maintenance of the system as a whole" while carefully sustaining his own position as the arbiter of social and cultural value-which is to say, while maintaining the system he pretends to deconstruct. He would seek to change the existing social structure without changing the economic and class structure on which it rests and of which he is a prime beneficiary. The clue to this rests in the obtuseness and opacity with which he and others like him couch their theorizing-- not in terms that the oppressed themselves might understand, but in terms that are de- signed to exclude them further from a posi- tion of leverage. In the end, the "multivalence" that Eisenman so arduously defends turns out to be just another form of expressionism, and the expressions are of just one voice: that of Peter Eisenman. Just as English as a Second Language acts as a form of (Anglocentric) cultural im- perialism, so does architecture (as envisaged by Eisenman) act as a form of cultural im- perialism. The purpose here is to eradicate difference and to absorb all other expres- sions of voice into the consuming dictates of an architectural taste for which the profes- sions are the gatekeepers. Just as the sugges- tion that minority peoples who are failing academically need more ESL tuition belies the reality that what besets them is a lack of voice-a silencing of their own heritage cul- ture, similarly the suggestion that people need more architecture obscures the fact that it is the architect's architecture that has been alienating and oppressing them for the last four hundred years."' A critical theory of design directed to the maintenance of human dignity, the re- alization of social equity, and the elimina- tion of human suffering aims to reveal the economic, cultural, social, and linguistic power on which the present system is built., It assists the oppressed in the process of self- empowerment through support for their own verbal and architectural language sys- tems. Empowerment in this sense means the removal of the social and political obstacles that prevent ordinary people from taking control of the social and cultural resources that shape their own identity-in Marxist terms, of the means of production. All else is a form of institutionalized racism that we either support or resist. Critical Reflections on Design Education It was through our attempts to understand the politics of heritage-language mainte- nance through the design of the Whare Wananga that we came to understand these deeper cultural issues about recent architec- tural design theory and education. We came to see current design theorizing as an inte- gral part of the overall hegemonic process that maintains the existing economic, social, cultural, and political status quo as a form of institutionalized racism. We believe that the evidence indicates that this institutionalized racism operates at all levels of the educa- tional system, from preschool to university, and throughout all disciplines, including architectural education. Within the Community Design Stu- dio, the Whare Wananga project raised im- portant issues not only about New Zealand's "bicultural" society at large, but also about architectural education itself, about its relation to this society, and about course content and pedagogical practice that reflects the nature of this relationship. The fact that it was an actual project, with a real client confronting real oppression, contrib- uted significantly to the interest and com- mitment of the participants. What became increasingly clear to us was that an architec- tural education that purports to acknowl- edge issues of social well-being cannot continue to ignore aspects of racism and cultural imperialism to which contributes. In the end, we accepted that any project that has as its moral imperative an alignment with the emancipatory demands of subject groups cannot succeed if it oper- ates internally in a non- or anti-emancipa- tory manner. Such a design project must be structured democratically to ensure that its members share an equal responsibility for its productions and that the structural hierar- chies that normally constrain teacher-stu- dent relationships and inhibit dialogue about sensitive issues must be abandoned or dimin- ished. It means also that the gendered, classed, or racially intolerant practices and attitudes that are part of the larger society and are therefore present within the design group constitute the process of personal and social emancipation.52 In this way, issues of social equality and empowerment in the out- side world are linked both theoretically and practically to a process of personal liberation for group members. 1 51 Ward and Wong</page><page sequence="17">The Whare Wananga project raised some important issues of design theory and the role of architects. Most challenged was the conception of an architecture of neutral- ity, an architecture depoliticized but at the same time maintaining some modicum of a liberatory intent. We came to realize that architecture in its current conception as an ideologically neutral enterprise directly serves the interests of the dominant culture and operates as an instrument of cultural oppression. We also came to realize that the converse was true: that a definition of archi- tecture that takes issues of equity and eman- cipation seriously can provide a powerful and useful vehicle whereby disenfranchised groups may rediscover their voice. The Form of the Whare Wananga Practicing architects as well as academics who have seen the Whare Wananga proposal have expressed uniform disappointment at the lack of any apparently explicit Maori iconog- raphy in the design. Whereas traditional Maori architectural forms are characterized by rich carvings and precise placement of building elements, the Whare Wananga de- sign demonstrably seems to neglect the former and to concentrate solely on the lat- ter. During the course of the project, a great deal of discussion took place about whether an explicitly Maori idiom should be applied to the final design. Given the highly visible and political nature of the project, the temp- tation to package the design in such a way as to convey its essential "Maoriness" was very strong. There was little doubt that a Maori university that looked distinctly Maori would have a more profound impact on the public awareness of the project than one that did not. The decision was made, in conjunction with the Ngati Awa themselves, to avoid such a presentation of the project for four reasons. First, as we have already noted, there is no one "Maori" language, but different dialects. Because these dialects are so deeply connected and rooted in particular histories of each tribe, they cannot be properly char- acterized as variations on a unified historical theme. Similarly, there are different archi- tectural languages for each tribe, each of which expresses a different belief system and history. The carving style of the Tuhoi is quite different from that of the Te Arawa, for instance. To "Maorify" the design would thus have been to erase the important and separate tribal identity of the Ngati Awa, something that the Whare Wananga was it- self specifically conceived to prevent. Second, it was clear that any attempt by the Pakeha students to superimpose a Maori aesthetic on the design would be grossly paternalistic and would be particularly difficult when taking into account the differ- ences in scale at which the project was being conceptualized and the scale at which the Maori carvings are made and experienced. It would have been impossible to capture the intricate detail or the particular vernacular of the Ngati Awa themselves at the scale of the comprehensive development plan. The third reason for resisting the temptation to "Maorify" the design of the Whare Wananga stemmed from traditional Maori educational philosophy. Unlike the Eurocentric model of education, which pro- motes a (capitalist) division of labor between intellectual knowledge and manual skill, tra- ditional Maori educational philosophy and practice are holistic. In programmatic terms, this means that it is almost inconceivable that one might design the detailed arrange- ment of the Whare Wananga separately from its production or fabrication. The carver, or tohunga whakairo in Maori culture, is a per- son who integrates intellectual, physical, in- tuitive, and healing skills. Further, because the tohunga whakairo is also a teacher, the educational process (which we assign, usually to the theoretical side of the equation) is also intimately linked to the production of form. It became clear, as the project progressed, that the formal details of the Whare Wananga could only be decided at the time of production and as an aspect of the educa- tional process itself. This meant that an im- portant element of the actual educational process would be the shaping of the educa- tional environment. Finally, the tohunga whakairo does not create in isolation, but in the midst of his tribe.53 As we have already noted, the notion of the individual creative genius working in isolation is foreign to tribal cul- tures. It would have been entirely inappro- priate to conceive of the detailing of the architecture in a remote university context, which was why the design team spent an unusual amount of time working and stay- ing in Whakatane and had developed design techniques that were accessible to the clients themselves.54 For all of these reasons, it be- came clear that it would be entirely inappro- priate for the design team to address the detailed formal requirements of the project. Projects like the Whare Wananga de- mand that the profession acknowledge its connections to issues of power and cultural imperialism and to come terms with the evolving reality of the postmodern world in more than token stylistic formalism. When we define architecture to ex- clude issues of culture or power, as Peter Eisenman does, we automatically align the profession with the processes of oppression and deny it the opportunity to shape the so- cial world. What we define collectively as ar- chitecture is just as much hegemonically (and Eurocentrically) determined as any other knowledge boundary or discipline. In the Whare Wananga project, the demy- thologizing of "educational freedom" in general evolved concurrently with the grow- February 1996 JAE 49/3 1 52</page><page sequence="18">ing awareness of the mythological nature of a "neutral architecture." Gradually, we came to recognize that these myths operate in a mutually sustaining way. To demystify one is to demystify both. They do not present a seamless surface, however. They are susceptible to analysis. This realization flowed naturally from the nature of the project itself. In addressing real cultural problems in a highly charged social context, students and staff were forced to confront elements of our own colonization and our role in the continuing subordination of Maoridom. We believe that this understanding would have been impossible were it not for the reciprocal re- lationship that we maintained between criti- cal theory and critical practice. Indeed, we would go farther and say that studio design projects that speak to either critical theory or critical practice in isolation from the other (that is, nonreflexively) invariably have as their subtext the reproduction of the status quo power, the maintenance of the existing social order, and the continuing prestige of the profession as a cultural elite, no matter how apparently transformative their language might appear. 55 If it is true, as Lyotard has suggested, that postmodernism has heralded the end of the grand narrative of universal emancipation (although truth itself is destabilized by Lyotard), then universal history no longer has a linear direction. This means that the mod- ernist (and capitalist) future has no privileged status over and above the precolonial past and that capitalism itself loses precisely that inevitability that the New Right, with its free market economics, would like to erect in the space vacated by the retreat of orthodox Marxism. If this is the case, there is much that we can learn and usefully adopt from the cultural traditions of indigenous peoples. In- deed, many of their myths and legends speak of their status as the guardians of important and earth-saving knowledge.56 Indigenous cultures shaped themselves through a con- tinuous process of living in balance with the material and social world. The skills and techniques they evolved for this purpose are perhaps even more relevant today than they were 150 years ago. If social transformation is to happen, it will require a radical restructur- ing of the way in which we conceptualize and teach architecture. Notes 1.

By the early eighties, it was estimated that of the approximately 450,000 (12 percent) Maori population of New Zealand, only 50,000 were fluent Maori speakers, and many of these were elders. It was feared that when they died, the language would die with them. 9. Linda T.

The amount of money needed to support five hundred unemployed people is $3.154 million per annum in unemployment and benefits. On top of this, we must add another $3 million in Welfare Depart- ment administrative costs (exclusive of actual welfare payments). If we further assume (bearing in mind the proven correlation between high unemployment levels and increases in crime) that 10 percent of Maori youth between the ages of sixteen and thirty are incarcerated (the Justice Department statistics actually put the fig- ure much higher, at 22 percent), with all of the court, legal aid, and incarceration costs involved, this adds an additional $2.75 million per annum to the national budget. The total cost to the taxpayer per year may therefore be in the region of $9 million per annum. This represents approximately half of the Whare Wananga costs. Assuming that the Whare Wananga operates effectively in preparing Maori youth for inde- pendence and positions of leadership, it would pay for itself in two years. All of these figures are taken from the appropriate government departmental statistics as of report publication in November 1990. The Justice Department at that time estimated the cost of incar- ceration at $55,000. In April 1991, that figure was in- 1 53 Ward and Wong</page><page sequence="19">creased to $57,000. The Justice Department also esti- mated that 22 percent of all Iwi (tribal) youth between sixteen and thirty years of age are incarcerated. We have allowed for a much lower figure in our calculations. Estimates of Maori who are unemployed or on Social Welfare are taken from Labour Department figures for persons clearly identifiable as Maori. The cost estimates for these figures have now changed downward since the national government's April 1 cuts in unemployment and welfare benefits. 18.

The use of schools as a mechanism of cul- tural assimilation has been well known and widely practiced throughout the colonized world. In the United States, for instance, Native American children have always been torn from their cultural and geo- graphic roots and forced to undergo racially inspired instruction in oppressive boarding-school conditions where they have been forbidden to speak their own language. See Mary Crow Dog and Richard Erdoes, Lakota Woman (New York: HarperCollins, 1990). 28. William Ryan, Blaming the Victim (New York: Vintage, 1972). This process is used to racially stereotype not only African-American children, but children of many ethnic minorities, most specifically America's own indigenous peoples. 29.

The government is currently negotiating a "fiscal envelope" agreement with selected tribal "spokes- men" through which, for an agreed sum (reputed to be $1 billion), all tribes will relinquish all future claims under the 1840 Treaty. The tribes themselves are strug- gling to expose the fact that these representatives have not been nominated by the Maori themselves and do not represent all of the tribes, but only a select few. Analysis of the tribes most likely to profit from the "fis- cal envelope" indicates that they are precisely those that have been most culturally "diluted," and have the high- est proportion of European ancestry and intermarriage. ("Insight Documentary," Radio New Zealand, July 31, 1994.) Similar processes have occurred regularly in the United States: For almost one hundred years, the Bu- reau of Indian Affairs has nominated tribal councils based not on traditional forms of representation, but aimed to place in power only those who would support federal policies of cultural assimilation and resource ac- quisition congruent with the needs of the oil and min- ing industries. See Emily Benedek, The Wind Won't Know Me: A History of the Navajo-Hopi Land Dispute (New York: Vintage Books, 1993). 34. The entire land holdings of the Ngati Awa were confiscated for the alleged murder of a part- Maori missionary. More than a hundred years later, those imprisoned and executed for the alleged crime were completely exonerated and pardoned, but of course, the land taken was never given back. Not in- significantly, it was sold, and the money was bequethed for the foundation and establishment of the University of Auckland, which proportionally few Maori attend. 35.

Ibid. p. 69. Research in second-language learning theory shows that people learning any lan- guage need to feel comfortable with the values inher- ent in that "other" culture. We cannot separate a language from the cultural values on which it is based. Language is the instrument through which cultural values are expressed. Reluctant language learners, par- ticularly immigrants, are often individuals who find that the importance of their own culture far outweighs any benefits of learning the language of their new country, knowing that once they do, they will auto- matically become more like their "oppressors."

St. Clair, eds., Language and Social Psychology (Oxford: Blackwell, 1979), pp. 193-221; see also R.C. Gardner, Social Psychology and Second Language Learning: The Role ofAttitudes and Motivation (Lon- don: Edward Arnold, 1985). 37. Indeed, the concept of theft is itself only intelligible in the context of a parallel concept of prop- erty. For the related development histories of property and theft in a European context, Foucault notes: "The illegality of rights, which often meant the survival of the most deprived, tended, with the new status of prop- erty, to become an illegality of property. It then had to be punished." See M. Foucault, Discipline and Punish: The Birth ofthe Prison (New York: Pantheon, 1977), p. 85.

In a bizarre logical twist, this is precisely the aim of the design theories of modernism, based (albeit falsely) on notions of objectivity, that Eisenman sets out to repudiate. 42. Ibid., p. 20. 43. Culture has, according to Pierre Bourdieu, an uneven exchange value. Some (dominant) cultural values are valued "higher" than other (subordinate) cul- tural values. Cultural capital operates like economic capital: Those with the most capital have the greatest power to increase their capital accumulation, whereas those with the least capital have a diminishing oppor- tunity to do so. This leads inevitably to a situation in which the power to define meaning is increasingly lodged in the hands of fewer and fewer increasingly powerful individuals.

Janet Daley argues that verbal and archi- tectural languages cannot be compared because "if de- sign and artistic creativity are experimentation with our perceptual limits, then they are irrevocably outside the realm of verbal description. We cannot describe the bounds of our experience because, as both Kant and Wittgenstein made clear, we can never step out- side them. But this is the true province of design, which is not a meta-language nor a set of deductions, but a systematization of our experience of the physi- cal world. The ways in which we symbolize and rep- resent that kind of systematization may be the most important clues to how we make sense of the world. Only by remaining true to the nature of the level of experience which is entailed can we hope to reach any real understanding of the phenomena for which we are trying to account. These boundaries may be, in effect, where philosophy ends and art begins." Janet Daley, "Design Creativity and the Understanding of Ob- jects," in Nigel Cross, ed, Developments in Design Methodology (Chichester, England: Open University, 1984), p. 300. I note that Daley accepts de facto the existence and definition of the category Art uncritically (that is, out of its social, cultural, and po- litical context). This is, of course, the classic Kantian conception of transcendent art that I am here making problematic. 52. The existence of discriminatory patterns of behavior and attitude in architectural education has been very well described in G. Grant, "Cultural Invis- ibility: The African American Experience in Architec- tural Education," in Dutton, Voices in Architectural Education, pp. 149-64; Julie Diaz, S. Buss, and S. Tircuit, "Beyond Cultural Chauvinism: Broadening and Enriching Architectural Education," in Dutton, Voices in Architectural Education, pp. 121-46; Jaqueline Leavitt, "Introducing Gender into Architec- tural Studios," in Dutton, Voices in Architectural Edu- cation, pp. 225-47; and Karen Kingsley, "Rethinking Architectural History from a Gender Perspective," in Dutton, Voices in Architectural Education, pp. 249-64. 53. Wood carving is traditionally a male occu- pation. Women, on the other hand, were "keepers of the stone." 54. Initially, it had been hoped to work with children's building blocks. By an oversight, these were left in Auckland. It became clear during a critical phase of the design process that the Ngati Awa with whom we were working were extremely reluctant to use the pencils and crayons that we had provided for them to draw their proposals. We therefore resorted to using cutout paper shapes for the different activities, which we labeled (a kind of two-dimensional building block). This proved to be an extremely useful and practical way of encouraging client participation. 55. As a matter of historical record, the Whare Wananga was finally stalled due to cutbacks in education funding arising from the election of the conservative National Party government in 1990. However, the Ngati Awa proceeded with their pro- posal, and the Whare Wananga was eventually estab- lished in a scaled-down version on a different site. It is now operating quite successfully, producing Maori- fluent graduates in a number of professional degree programs. 56. The Hopi of Arizona are particularly sig- nificant in this respect. Their whole spirituality is based on the premise that they will one day be called on to share their knowledge once again with human- ity after the "great cleansing."
