HACKER Particular cloths in Orissa, such as a silk ikat with verses from the GTtagovinda, function in specific, highly codified ways within a ritual domain at the Jagann?tha temple in Puri (fig. 1). Within the complex network at this great religious institution, cloth denotes status for the hereditary temple sevakas, or servants, of Lord Jagann?tha, who number in the thousands. The important capacity of cloth to denote status in Indian culture has been articulated in a number of recent publications.1 My investigation, however, focuses on the circulation of cloth in various ritual and social arenas related to the Jagann?tha temple, underscoring a dynamic process of status negotiation, contestation, or enhancement. Furthermore I am concerned not only with the sevakas, but with a larger ensemble of people: artisans and devotees of the Jagann?tha temple? spectators and participants, who, in turn, present and receive gifts of cloth. The public spectacle of the Rathy?tr? inverts the temple norms, erasing social and sectarian boundaries, by allowing all to gaze on the divine body of Lord Jagann?tha and to witness rituals generally excluded from all but temple officiants who, with the exception of a small group of female temple dancers, are all male.2 The inclusiveness of this procession reminds one of the syncretic nature of Jagann?tha himself: a deity whose tribal origins have been assimilated into mainstream Hinduism as an incarnation of Visnu. Tribal groups in Orissa, especially the Kondh who inhabit the hilly tracts of Phulbani district, worship numerous goddesses who may be represented by wooden posts or pillars (fig. 2). The mediation between religious and cultural systems is explicitly acknowledged by Jagann?tha's iconography? rather than being anthropomorphic, he retains a wooden, pillarlike form (fig. 3)?and by the presence of both temple Brahmanical priests and tribal dait?s who preside over different spheres of Jagann?tha's life. By drawing on both historical documents and contemporary practices, I will argue that ritual, social, and political domains, like status, do not remain discrete or static but intersect through a series of shifting power relations. The setting: Orissa's Jagann?tha Temple at Puri The Jagann?tha temple in Orissa, the eastern coastal town of Puri, is one of seven MoksapurTs, or "sacred places" in India where one gains liberation, and a celebrated place of pilgrimage (t?rthasth?na), especially for the Rathy?tr?, or Cart Festival (fig. 4). At this annual event, the anomalous wooden images of Jagann?tha,3 "Lord of the Universe," his sister Subhadr?, and his elder brother Balabhadra are brought out of their twelfth century temple, placed in three massive wooden chariots with cloth-covered towers, and drawn by devotees in public procession along a one-and-a-half kilometer route along the Grand Road north to the Gundic? temple where they reside for nine days (fig. 5). Considered the first residence of Lord Jagann?tha and 2. Entry into the Jagann?tha temple is restricted to Hindus; furthermore, they may view the images installed in the sanctum at prescribed times of day only. 3. Unlike stone images typically installed permanently in Hindu sanctums with smaller metal sculptures for processional use, Puri's large wooden triad leaves the temple annually for the Rathy?tr?. An earlier version of this paper was presented at the annual meeting of the Canadian Asian Studies Association at the University of Calgary 1994. I would like to thank Purna Chandra Mishra of Puri for his invaluable assistance in Orissa and my colleagues who read earlier drafts of this article. I would also like to express my appreciation to Res editor Francesco Pellizzi and two anonymous reviewers for their many useful comments. 1. See E.

At the end of nine days, the procession is reenacted for the deities' return to the Jagann?tha temple. The Jagann?tha temple's complex ritual calendar is regulated by daily rhythms punctuated by temporal markers. The temple rituals can be divided broadly into daily worship (p?ja) and festival cycles (utsava) such as the annual Sn?nap?rnima, or "Bathing Ceremony," and Rathy?tr?, and the periodic Navakalevara, or "New Embodiment," with accompanying specialists. Hereditary temple priests attend to daily rituals, while the dait?s preside over aspects of the seasonal calendar. Historian Ronald Inden has written of medieval Indian kings and their campaigns of temple building as constructing "scales of ontological spaces with their appropriate categories of people and activities."4 I would extend his analysis to include categories of objects, and within the context of this paper, cloth. Textiles are cited repeatedly in the extensive literature on the Jagann?tha temple. Indeed, colonial officers recognized if not their importance, at least their quantity by preparing separate inventories of cloth, giving us some idea of its pervasive use in temple rituals and as gift exchange in the early nineteenth century.5 Today, weavers of the Buddhist Sar?ka caste, for example, prepare some fifteen distinct 4.

During an elaborate daily worship of offering sixteen upacaras (food, flowers, incense, or service), the deity is dressed with two cloths (vastra) after his bath.7 A presentation of silk or cotton cloth used to be the official recognition of all sevakas beginning their service to the temple, referred to as the s??lhT-bandh?, or "sari-binding," ceremony.8 SarjhT, or "sari," is the name commonly given to a woman's garment. Rather than denoting a gender-specific garment, however, the term here signifies a six-yard loom-width cloth, uncut and unstitched. Unstitched cloth typically denotes the highest ritual value. Of great importance here is that this cloth? marking the sevaka's entry into the temple culture?has been worn previously by the deity and the selection of a specific cloth indicates the sevaka's rank and prestige.

Organizationally, this textile conforms to other Indian draped cloths such as the sari, with a clearly defined central field, borders, and decorative end panel (pallu) with its three alternating colors that correspond to the dominant color of each of the three chariots: green for Balabhadra, red for Subhadr?, and yellow for Jagann?tha. Inscribed Indian textiles are rare; therefore their presence typically signals a symbolic dimension. For example, block-printed textiles with the repeating Vai?navite salutation "SrT R?m, Jai R?m, Jai Jai R?m" are widely available at temple sites to be purchased by pilgrims as a religious memento, or they may be worn by priests, as during the 1994 Rathy?tr? celebrated Groeme served as Collector of the Southern Division at Puri and was requested by the East India Company to prepare these inventories.

Pers. comm. with Govinda Das, a weaver in Nuagodi village, near Nirmala, Puri district, July 1994. According to Das, this tradition of weaving cloth for the Jagann?tha temple has been in his family for two generations. One day his father was in the market selling some towel-like cloth (gamucha). Also in the shop was the present king's grandfather who was relating to the shopkeeper some problem with the supply of cloth, just prior to the Rathy?tr?. The shopkeeper recommended Sanatana Das, Govinda Das's father, and this is how his family entered the temple culture. These weavers are suppliers only; they do not have sevaka status. 7. Articles are presented in a specific order, with cloth offered ninth. For a detailed examination of the entire ritual, see G. C. Tripathi, "The Daily P?j?

The inscription on the G?tagovinda cloth is not created by block printing, but instead by ikat, a resist-dye technique applied to a fabric's weft and/or warp before weaving (fig. 8). Groups of threads are protected or reserved from dye penetration by tying or binding. Ikat, and other resist techniques such as plangi, are known as bandh? from the Sanskrit "to tie" or "to bind."The main field is devoted to a single verse, or sloka, from the twelfth-century G?tagovinda, composed in Sanskrit but here written in the regional Oriya script, repeated on the entire length of cloth. Jayadeva's G?tagovinda is a devotional poem, or r?gak?vya, of twelve cantos containing twenty-four songs dedicated to Kr?na. The verse most frequently employed is the invocational stanza of the first part (1.16): the Dasavat?ra, recounting Vi?nu's ten avataras, "descents" or "incarnations."9 The selection of the G?tagovinda locates Jagann?tha more specifically in bhakti devotionalism. In Orissa, Jagann?tha is considered Krsna, Vi?nu's ninth avat?ra. As Richard Davis has observed, "the concept of avat?ra . . . offered important advantages to an expanding community of Vi^nu worshipers. It enabled the Vai?navas to maintain their identification of Vi?nu as the Absolute, yet also incorporate other local or regional 9. This verse, in translation, reads: For upholding the Vedas, For upporting the earth, For raising the world, For tearing the demon asunder, For cheating Bali, For destroying the warrior class, For conquering R?vana, For wielding the plow, For spreading compassion, For routing the barbarians: Homage to you, Krishna, In all your ten incarnate forms!

C. Mishra's The Cult of Jagannath, where it was not his reference to "the new silken cloths used to cover the sacred D?ru [ritually selected log to become the new cult image]" but the photograph of the log covered with the unidentified G?tagovinda textile that substantiated the prominent role of the latter in the ceremonial selection and replacement of the wooden image of Lord Jagann?tha.11 While the ceremonial renewal of the wooden images occurs only every twelve to nineteen years, implying an infrequent use of the G?tagovinda cloth,12 the daily worship of Lord Jagann?tha also entails the use of this textile. Hence, the G?tagovinda cloth participates in both the daily and seasonal cycles of the temple. The G?tagovinda poem is recited at two separate phases of the evening worship. Among the 119 departments of sevakas with 36 different castes, a "G?tagovinda sevaka" is responsible for the first recitation?including the singing of the Dasavat?rau? accompanied by musicians, then by devad?s?s, or temple dancers, the only group of women in attendance to Jagann?tha. From a dated inscription on the Jayavijaya gateway within the Jagann?tha temple complex, we know that the performance of the G?tagovinda has been Figure 4. The Lion's Gate, the Jagann?tha temple's eastern and main entrance. Above the entranceway are ten panels representing the ten avataras or incarnations of Vis.nu, with Jagann?tha depicted as ninth avat?ra.

While initially determined by the occurrence of an extra ?s??lha (June/July) in the lunar calendar, economics increasingly plays a significant role in this expensive ceremony. The last Navakalavera was held in 1996; the one before, 1977. Not only was 1996 the last year in which the festival could be held within the prescribed cycle of 12 to 19 years, but many of the most knowledgeable, senior dait?s are quite old, and as these traditions must be practiced to be followed properly, this ritual knowledge was perceived to be in jeopardy. 13.

Significantly, this dress is none other than the silk G?tagovinda cloth.16 The text of the cloth relates directly to its role in the evening ritual. As the ritual proceeds, sanctum lamps are slowly extinguished. The participants' interpretations of the complete ritual all alluded to sexual union.17 The appropriateness of this particular poem for inclusion in each evening's concluding ritual is apparent in its erotic content. As Miller elaborates, "The lyrical techniques of Jayadeva's songs combine with the conventional language of Sanskrit erotic poetry to express the intimate power of divine love. As Jayadeva's elaborates the passion of R?dh? and Krishna, he creates an aesthetic atmosphere of erotic mood (srhgararasa) that is bliss for devotees of Krishna."18 Yet, as noted earlier, Jagann?tha is not shown with his consort; rather the Puri triad is a familial one, composed will be performed thus at the time of food-offerings (bhoga) to the Elder Lord (Balar?ma) and the Lord of the G?tagovinda (Jagann?tha). This dancing will continue from the end of the deities' evening meal to their bedtime meal. The dancing group of the Elder Lord, the female dancers of Lord Kapilesvara, and the ancient dancing group of Telengana will all learn no song other than the G?tagovinda from the Elder Lord. Aum. They will sing no other song. No other dance should be performed before the great God. In addition to the dancing, there will be four singers who will sing only the G?tagovinda. Those who are not versed in singing the G?tagovinda will follow in chorus?they should learn no other song. Any temple official who knowingly allows any other song or dance to be performed is hostile to Jagann?tha. (See note 9), p. 6 15. Frederique Apffel Marglin, Wives of the God-King.

Whereas the imagery in the G?tagovinda celebrates specifically the union of Kr?na, the deity, and R?dh?, devotee par excellence, Jagann?tha's evening ritual is comparable with other divine marriages at major festivals, such as the South Indian goddess Minaks?'s marriage to Lord Siva at the Minaks? temple in Madurai, and more specifically to the nightly ritual of palliyaria pujai with its key aspect of the joining together of the god and goddess, seen explicitly as lovers.

It has been proposed that Balabhadra was added to a pair of divinities? identified in inscriptions as Puru?ottama, "Lord of the World" and Lak?m?19?in the thirteenth century, and with this addition, Lak?mi as Jagann?tha's consort was redefined as his sister Subhadr?.20 It seems clear that the inclusion of this rite, which references a divine marriage was grafted onto the worship of Jagann?tha at an early stage of his transformation, and while Subhadr?'s status has changed, the rite has been retained, revealing the disjunctures between ideological and iconographie conceptualizations of the deities. Rather than a reductive opposition between two contrasting systems, the triad marks one moment in a more complex process of interventions. Indeed, this - complexity is dramatically reinforced by the presence of not three but seven deities installed in the main sanctum: the three images of Jagann?tha, Subhadr?, and Balabhadra; small metal images of Jagann?tha's consorts Lak$mi and Sarasvat?; the wooden pillar Sudarsana; and M?dhava.21 The ambiguity and potential multiple 19.

It is only after the deity partakes of this food that the bhoga becomes mah?pras?d, to be distributed to the sevakas and pilgrims present at the temple. As we shall see, cloth, like food, is ritual ly consumed and redistributed. Kings, daitas, and authority within the temple culture Political history interacts with religious history. The Jagann?tha temple has been a royally sponsored institution since its founding, after 1135 A.D., by Anantavarman Co?jaganga (1078-1147 A.D.), who conquered central Orissa (Utkala). The Saivite Cocjaganga employed two strategies to promote stabilization and legitimation of his power over his new empire: he shifted his capital from Kalinga?agara to central Orissa and erected the Vai?navite temple in Puri to honor Orissa's popular cult.23 In 1230 King Anangabh?ma III of the Ganga dynasty ritually dedicated the empire of Orissa to Jagann?tha as Lord of the Universe; and in the fifteenth century, King Kapilendra declared himself adisevaka, the first servant of Lord Jagann?tha, thus shifting control of the temple from the priests to the king, at the apex of the temple hierarchy. In inscriptions, Kapilendra boldly equated himself with the deity; if anyone opposed his rule, it was tantamount to treason (droha) against Lord Jagann?tha himself.24 In Orissa, kingship cannot be categorized strictly as a secular activity or separated from the religious domain as the ruler was seen to embody the divinity on earth. When superimposed with Orissa's history, the rich layering of religious meanings of the Jagann?tha cult can also be read as strategic manipulations for political 22.

Kapilendra, for example, usurped the throne from the Gangas and founded the powerful SDryavamsa dynasty. The Jagann?tha cult has been integrally connected to the political power of Orissa throughout their shared history by its status as a state religion. The king exploited cloth as a visual means of establishibg hierarchy and marking status and prestige within the institutional boundaries of the temple cult. Just as temple servants are bound by specific obligations to the temple, the king extended a network of religious obligations, rights, and privileges, patterned on the religious institution, to incorporate the political landscape. By appropriating these recognizable symbols, rulers sought to consolidate the Orissan empire, or to maintain control of the tributary states within the region. One tool royalty consistently commanded was the distribution of cloth, which functioned as part of a political contract. As example, cloth used by the deities and mahapras?d, sacred food prepared in the temple kitchen and offered to the deities, were sent to the Rajas of Dhenkanal and Talcher in return for supplying iron, and to the King of Ranpur for providing ropes to construct and pull the carts during the Rathy?tr?.25 The annual supply of wood for the construction of the carts was the privilege of the Rajas of Dasapalla, to the west of Puri. The M?dala P?nj?, or "Puri temple chronicles," record that "saris (or turbans, as signs of honor) should be sent from the temple store for the two chieftains."26 The rajas of these feudatory states, in turn, engaged tribals in duties related to the festival, and they were rewarded in the same manner: cloth and an honorarium from the temple.27 The jagann?tha Sthala Vrtt?ntam, containing approximately thirty-five royal letters (ch?mu cit?u) dating from 1654 to 1913,28 reveals a consistent pattern of recognition and honors issued by the king on behalf of the temple to visitors to the Jagann?tha temple. Entries record the year of reign, the name, title, and place of origin of the visitor, as well as those in his party and their relationship to him, the purpose of his visit, his endowment and gifts to the temple, and the special privileges and facilities to be accorded him. The king, acting on behalf of the temple, bestowed gifts to the visitor. Invariably, like those provided to the feudatory kings for services rendered, these gifts were cloth. The Raja of Avanti, for example, "visiting Puri for darsan should be honoured by presents of garments and sandal wood paste in the temple."29 The Raja of Khandapada's family members were honored with "twenty-one pieces of cotton cloths" while the king was given "a silk cloth of orange color. . . further gifts of a piece of cloth from the sacred flag of the temple [b?n?], three pieces of local cloth and a silk cloth."30 And a third example, the Raja of Kendujhar, who endowed fifty rupees to the temple, was given a silk cloth called "Phillatoni" and his secretary, a piece of cotton cloth.31 The above three entries are representative of the corpus of royal letters in that they underscore the presentation of cloth as an honor and the category of the gift appropriate to the status of the recipient. Kings receive the prestigious silk, their ministers and family members, cotton. Even when the cloth is specifically identified, such as Phillatoni, cited above, the fiber is always named, underscoring the differentiating significance and power associated with silk. Furthermore, the cloth's size is communicated in the descriptive language of sari, indicating that it is a six-yard length of cloth, and khandua, approximately two yards. The Rajas of Khurda tried to bolster their increasingly weakened political position through ritual means, such as the granting of special privileges.32 Cloth was a major element in the system of according special status and a means of formalizing relationships; thus it served not only religious and ceremonial functions but the political realm as well. As a way of marking their independence from the collapsing Khurda dynasty in the sixteenth century, a 25.

These feudatory kings also emulated Puri's Jagann?tha tradition by staging their own cart festivals/ Talcher, Atgarh, Tigiria, and Dhenkanal?each with their own Jagann?tha temple?appear to have replicated this political and religious authority with the rituals at Puri by presenting G?tagovinda cloth.34 In 1994 atTigiria's sixteenth-century Jagann?tha temple, two elderly temple priests in charge of dressing Lord Jagann?tha were able to verify the existence of a G?tagovinda cloth. Both in their sixties, they remember this textile given by the king. When it became old and torn, however, the cloth was ritually disposed of by being placed in a tank. Since then the cloth has not been replaced.35 At Atgarh, the present generation of temple priests knows of no G?tagovinda cloth in use at their Jagann?tha temple, constructed in 1728 by Raja Raghunatha Harichandana. Although in the present day kingship has been superseded by modern forms of governance, and management of the temple shifted to the state in the mid-1950s, the King of Puri continues to carry out ceremonial duties within the Jagann?tha temple's ritual arena and, as ?disevaka, receives the largest share of the temple mah?pras?d.36 As a token of his coronation when he becomes the temple's "first servant," the king wears the G?tagovinda cloth, referred to as pagabandhiba, an ikat-patterned turban (paga). This ceremony took place most recently in January of 1971 when Divyasirhha Deva IV became Raja of Puri. A seventeenth-century manual of Jagann?tha's ritual (Niti) records the important sweeping of the carts (cher? p?hamra), which is initiated by the Raja. Although the rituals are undergoing change, this grand ceremony of sweeping the carts remains a most important "royal duty" (r?janiti) of the present Raja of Puri and a conspicuous part of the festival (fig. 9).37 Indeed the king signals the entire procession to begin, as he makes a 33. The cult of Jagann?tha is continuing to increase its sphere of influence from coastal Orissa into the interior. I observed the celebration of the cart festival in hilly, predominately tribal areas of central Orissa and in the adjacent state of Madhya Pradesh. This also speaks to migration patterns?which have increased dramatically since the 1960s?of Hindus from the plains up into the hills. 34.

Other examples of change: the image of Jagann?tha is traditionally supposed to be carried around his cart once, and Sudarsana, who is brought out first, is to circumambulate all three carts once.

After the ritual cleansing or purification, the king returns to his palace in an open palanquin so as to be seen by all the spectators assembled along the route. As Kulke has argued, these processionals served as a public means of displaying power, and of ritually linking tribal rural communities with royal or urban centers through the Hinduized worship of a local deity.38 Of tribal or Sabara origin,39 the daifas hold an interesting position within the institutional structure. They play an extremely important role in the festival cycle of the temple, especially during anavasara, when annual repairs and repainting of the images are made after the Bathing Ceremony, prior to the cart festival; the eleven-day annual Rathy?tr?; and the periodic Navakalevara or "New Embodiment." During these events held in the summer months of Jye?fha (May-June) and ?$acjha (June-July), the daifas may wear the G?tagovinda cloth.40 A new set of G?tagovinda cloths is given to the daifas at the annual Khacjilagi Ek?das?, when the images are repainted at the conclusion of the bathing ceremony.41 The ritual of bathing, painting, and dressing the images represents their annual rebirth prior to the cart festival. 38.

It would be important here to establish at what points in the ritual cycles these cloths are worn.

Khadi, meaning the color white, refers to the painting of the images.</page><page sequence="13">118 RES 32 AUTUMN 1997 At the beginning of the Navakalevara, four daita chiefs?from the four divisions of daifas serving Lord Jagann?tha, Subhadr?, Balabhadra, and Sudarsana?are presented with silk G?tagovinda cloths of approximately eighteen feet in length, or, in the local system of measurement, twelve hata (hands). The remaining compliment of daifas, thirty-two in all,42 receive four to five hatas (charihata) of the same fabric.43 The Viswakarm? carpenters receive cotton and silk saris from the Raja of Puri as "a symbolic authorization of the king to begin work."44 When the proper tree has been selected for each of the four images, it is circumambulated seven times, sprinkled with holy water, applied with sandalpaste, offered flowers, and finally wrapped with a "new cloth." Mishra's photograph, cited above, documents the 1969 Navakalevara in which the wooden log (d?ru) is protectively wrapped in the silk G?tagovinda cloth, revealing that the very first cloth to be worn by the future deity in its unrealized form is the G?tagovinda cloth. Drawn ceremoniously in wooden carts back to Puri, the four d?rus are then carved in a specially constructed pavilion in the northern precinct of the temple compound. This special two-week event is conducted under great secrecy, concluding with the all important transfer of the "life-substance" (brahmapadartha) from the old ?mages to the new icons who now are considered alive. This most important ceremony is performed by the head daita for each of the four deities. The previous, "dead," images are ritually disposed of in a deep pit lined with red cloth. This burial site (Koili Vaikuntha) is also located on the northern side of the temple. While the daitas are the major players in this festival cycle, temple priests are not excluded. Interestingly, during Navakalevara, the location of the proper trees is revealed in a dream not only to the dait?s but to the Viswakarm?s, and to the temple priests who perform rituals in the forest that parallel those in the temple's daily worship of Jagann?tha. After the return to Puri, Vedic rites are conducted simultaneously by the temple Brahmins in a structure adjacent to the one housing the Viswakarm?s who are carving the new images. After the images are painted by the chitrakaras, it is the Brahmin priest who performs the important ceremony of eye opening (Netrotsava) by painting in the pupils of the eyes of the deities. The deities then receive a purification bath at the hands of the priests that is meant to cleanse them of the contamination received from the artisans. The public Snanapurnima ceremony is another example where social boundaries are negotiated and temple authority is mediated; tribal dait?s and Brahmin sevakas together bathe the images, and sit together while cooked food is offered. While the periodic ceremony celebrating the renewal of an ephemeral form subverts the primacy of Jagann?tha as a Hindu deity, the use of the G?tagovinda cloth with its word images of Krsna reasserts Jagann?tha's incorporation into devotional Hinduism inscribing the ceremony with a certain tension between religious ideologies. At these moments where contrasting traditions and competing interests intersect within existing power structures, we see ritual systems to mediate the authority at the temple. As the daitas are considered family members (kutumba) of Jagann?tha and actually observe a period of mourning and death pollution after the transfer of the "life-essence" to the new images, they are entitled to the personal effects of the old images after the "New Embodiment" ceremony. Of concern here is the fact that the statues are not made solely of wood, but also of seven layers of cloth, resin, and sandalwood. As part of the deconsecration of the old images, these materials may be given away by the daitas at their discretion, whereupon they are then treated as relics. The G?tagovinda cloth is accorded a similar status. It is preserved for generations; when the cloth has almost disintegrated, thin strips (sirikapada) are tied around the necks of devotees, as a token of the goddess, who is none other than Laksm?, consort of Lord Jagann?tha. Moreover, small pieces of the cloth may be purchased from the dait?s by villagers for their goddess to wear as a head covering or odhani. The dait?s themselves preserve small fragments of the G?tagovinda cloth in their Laksmi p?j? phedi, a traditional casket of bamboo or brass where images and articles for Laksmi's p?j? are stored. Among the daita community, another 42. Tripathi records twenty-five daitas in "Navakalevara," (see note 25); but according to Laksmanadas Mahapatra, a senior daita, the figure is thirty-two, perhaps reflecting the continuing expansion of the institution over the last twenty years. 43.

According to Purna Chandra Mishra of Puri, who interviewed them in 1993, the carpenters are not daita.</page><page sequence="14">Hacker: Dressing Lord Jagann?tha in silk 119 significant function of the G?tagovinda cloth is as a funeral shroud for a deceased member of their family? male or female.45 By placing an old fragment on the body of the deceased, Jagann?tha's renewal is symbolically reenacted, and with it, the promise of reincarnation. The silk G?tagovinda cloth, in its various forms, manifests the divine body. Initially clothing the deity himself, the cloth goes on to circulate within the domains of kingship, kinship, and devotion. Worn only by the king when he assumes the title of first servant at his coronation, at this ceremony and with the G?tagovinda cloth the institutions of state and religion are officially bound. Although the status of the daitas within the temple sevaka organization is ambiguous, the cloth wraps the daitas in a collective identity by proclaiming their kinship ties with Lord Jagann?tha. Their status within the larger temple culture is enhanced by the privilege of distributing the G?tagovinda cloth. The process of redistribution also establishes new sets of social and political relationships. Even as it physically degenerates, the cloth retains its religious resonance for the pilgrims who accept portions of the divine body from the dait?s. The weavers of Nuapatna Having discussed the roles of textiles for the consumers, what of the makers of the cloth? Do the weavers simply fulfill an order or are they too recipients in some of the merits and gifts of the temple? What is the nature of their affiliation with the temple? At present, the G?tagovinda cloth is woven in Nuapatna, Cuttack district, a large village located along Orissa's Mahanad? River. Perhaps ninety percent of Nuapatna's population of approximately 4,000 people are hereditary weavers, comprised of five different castes: Asin? p?tar?; Gaud?ya p?tar?; Sar?ka and Rangan?, (Buddhists); and Odiy? p?tar?. Sixty-year-old Sudama Guin, a master weaver whose family belongs to the Gaud?ya p?tar?s, prepares the G?tagovinda textile (fig. 10). According to their oral history, Guin's family who migrated from Burdwan, Bengal, have been weaving this cloth for fourteen generations. Adopted by his maternal uncle Cintamani Guin, Sudama Guin was the youngest of three sons and had to receive permission 45. Pers. comm., Laksmanadas Mahapatra, Puri. from his mother to begin weaving the G?tagovinda cloth, and then only after his marriage. Had he been an only son, this occupation would not have been allowed because in Guin's own words: "In God's work, you have to be very careful; if not, he'll destroy you." He cites the example of his father's younger brother a weaver who died prematurely at thirty-two. Villagers thought perhaps he had made a mistake in weaving and expressed their belief that there is great danger (bipada) attached with temple weaving. Of Sudama Guin's four sons, only his second and married son Nityananda has begun weaving the G?tagovinda.46 The G?tagovinda cloth is known alternately as "Kenduli pata" or "Kenduli khandu?," the title Kenduli referring to the village where, according to legend, the cloth originated.47 An early historical document referring to these cloths and their place of manufacture appears in the M?daj? P?nj?. The royal decree by King Ramachandra Deva II, dated 1641 Saka (1719 a.D.),48 states that "'the bandha gitagovinda' set of cloths previously woven by Kenduli weavers could not be done there and therefore 46. Nityananda Guin's work is on exhibition in the Ethnographic wing of the Orissa State Museum in the capital city of Bhubaneswar. On this small cloth with a red ground, four white ikat lines from the Sampuma Ramayana are created in Devan?gari characters. At the bottom, also crafted in ikat, is the weaver's signature in English: "Nityananda Guin son of Sudam Guin Nuapatna CTC Orissa." Also exhibited are two other small ikats on cotton: a representation of the Jagann?tha temple highlighting its soaring tower, and a "Jayadev Khandua." All three carry the brief label in Oriya and English, "Findspot: Nuapatna (Cuttack)." In a separate open vitrine, images of Jagann?tha, Subhadr?, and Balabhadra are draped with silk G?tagovinda cloths. 47. Communities of weavers from Kenduli, as well as Dhenkanal and Baramba appear to have moved to Nuapatna in the 1760s. The possibility of the cloth originating in Kenduli is indeed a fascinating one, as Jayadeva, the twelfth-century author of the G?tagovinda, names "Kindubilva" as his birthplace in the G?tagovinda (111.10). There has been much discussion, however, about the location of this village: Orissa or West Bengal. See Miller (see note 9), p. 4. Historian K. N. Mahapatra has published on this issue arguing convincingly for Orissan authorship, but as his publications Khurudh? Itihasa (1969) and Sr? Jayadeva o Sr? G?tagovinda (1973) are in Oriya, his ideas are not yet part of the public discourse. 48. Whereas the Madala Pa?j? verifies an eighteenth-century date or earlier for the ikat technique in Orissa, there are no extant ikat textiles of that age. The oldest documented Orissan ikat appears to be the commissioned piece for the 1937 coronation of King George of Great Britain, in the collection of the Calico Museum of Textiles, Ahmedabad. 49. B.

The Jagann?tha temple administration currently purchases directly from master weaver Guin a set of "G?tagovinda khandu?" for Rs 13,500 (approximately $450). This silk set consists of twelve pieces for seven images: the wooden triad of Jagann?tha, Subhadr? and Balabhadra, the wooden pillar Sudarsana, small metal ?mages of consorts Lak?m? and Sarasvat?, and M?dhava. These additional four deities are also installed in the main sanctum of the Jagann?tha temple. The twelve cloths have specific names, sizes, and functions. The b?ra hata, a cloth of eighteen feet (twelve hata), is an upper garment worn like a shawl. Three b?ra hata are prepared for the Trinity. Another upper garment, the paharana covers the head and body and is twenty-one feet long (fourteen hata). The khandu?, a lower garment of eight hata is also prepared for Jagann?tha, Subhadr?, and Balabhadra. An extremely long cloth of thirty-six feet (twenty-four hata), the phut? is wrapped around the deities's arms and in front of the body to resemble a garland (see fig. 6). Only two phut? are required?for Lord Jagann?tha and Balabhadra?as Subhadr?, who stands in the center of the triad, has no arms (see figs. 3 and 6). The twelfth cloth is the kani, which is cut into fourths for the accompanying deities Sudarsana, Lak?m?, Sarasvat?, and M?dhava. These cloths?three b?ra hata (shawl), paharana (head cover), and khandu? (lower garment); two phut?) and one kani make up a complete set for the Jagann?tha temple. According to Guin, the temple has four unnegotiable requirements: the G?tagovinda is the only text to be used; the verses, created in ikat, must be in Oriya script only; the cloth must be silk; and the cloth's background color must be red. Eberhard Fischer suggests that Devan?gari script was used in an earlier period, replaced by Oriya, and while there are cloths utilizing Devan?gari, such as the above cited cloth by Nityananda Guin in the Orissa State Museum, these, I believe, represent private orders rather than those placed from the Jagann?tha temple.50 Temple insistence on vernacular Oriya rather than classical Devan?gari script underscores the regional nature of the Jagann?tha cult, and may recall the historic 50. Fischer and Pathy (see note 11), p. 290.</page><page sequence="16">Hacker: Dressing Lord Jagann?tha in silk 121 circumstances of privileging or consciously selecting Oriya to promote an Oriya identity. Working within these prescriptions, Guin is free to choose the verses from the G?tagovinda. According to the weaver, Lord Jagann?tha himself appears in a dream (sopna desa) and reveals which slokas to prepare. Sometimes a whole song is written, or a single verse is repeated. Guin's personal and visionary participation is, therefore, of crucial importance to the outcome of the cloth. Whereas the temple orders G?tagovinda cloths annually, this is not the only new set coming into the Jagann?tha temple. Devotees request Guin's address, from the temple administration or from shopkeepers, and order sets for presentation at the temple. According to Guin, commissions from devotees have increased over the years: in the summer of 1994, he had prepared four or five sets, including one order received from a top industrialist from Orissa. In addition to his role as weaver, Guin as a personal devotee of Lord Jagann?tha annually gives four pieces of cloth (ghocja) he has woven to be worn as shawls by the deities in the winter season. Furthermore, like the dait?s, Sudama Guin preserves a fragment of the G?tagovinda cloth, woven by his great grandfather, for a head covering for the goddess, for his personal devotions. Guin also prepares a cotton cloth specifically for pilgrims or devotees (fig. 11). Evoking the silk G?tagovinda cloth, the ground is red and bands of inscriptions are prepared in ikat. With verses from the G?tagovinda or the Carit?maritam by the famous Bengali Vai^navite saint Caitanya (1485-1533 A.D.) or even an image of Lord Jagann?tha created by the ikat technique, these cloths are worn by pilgrims as scarves or shoulder cloths, perhaps to emulate the dait?s (fig. 12). Not as time-consuming or finely wrought as the silk G?tagovinda, the cotton pilgrim cloths can be prepared twenty at one time. This finished cloth enters a well established commercial network, a major industry around the temple selling religious souvenirs for pilgrims such as paintings, small wooden shrines, conch shells, and bamboo baskets filled with pras?d (fig. 13).51 While merchants sell these wares year-round at the square in front of the temple, during the Rathy?tr? this industry more than triples in quantity, types of goods, and the physical space required for display. Separate, portable stalls, often no more than a piece of cloth to demarcate their space, appear during the summer lining both sides of the processional route. While seemingly random and chaotic, a certain ordering is detectable: spaces directly in front of the carts, at either end of the festival site, carry goods for the immediate ritual needs of the pilgrims in their devotions to Lord Jagann?tha?incense, oil lamps, coconuts, flowers. That ikat cloth was produced for other special, secular occasions can be verified from another source. The Calico Museum of Textiles, Ahmedabad, has in its collection a "silk souvenir sample" woven on the occasion of George Vl's coronation in 1937, with a repeating refrain in English: "God save great George our King, Long live our noble King, God save the King, Send him Victorious, Happy and Glorious, Long to reign over us God save the King, Tigiria." The date of this coronation cloth coincides with the date that Guin's great grandfather Kalindi Katu?la was presented a Certificate of Merit from the King of Mayurbhanj state, suggesting that the cloth was a commission of the Raja and prepared by Guin's ancestor. Guin receives cash payment for his cloth; whereas in the past, according to the M?daj? Panj? temple records, the weavers received pras?d and other gifts. Are the weavers of the G?tagovinda cloth, then, honored as sevakas, like the chitrak?ras who paint images for the temple or the potters who prepare pots for the mah?pras?d? Those artisans are acknowledged as sevakas by beginning their service with the sa?lh? binding ceremony and receiving fire from the temple kitchen to light their funeral pyre. The potters carry an honorific surname Bisoi ("leader") which distinguishes them from other potters, and they have received a large tract of land as well as other benefits from the temple.52 The potters' service to the temple is, in fact, their main occupation. Yet they have begun to find their obligations and duties onerous and are searching for new means to maintain their obligations as well as economic solvency. Perhaps this was the situation for the weavers as well. What I found, instead, is that these weavers are excluded from the sevaka system. 51. For a discussion of painting on cloth (pata chitra), the artisans, and their ritual status as sevakas at the Jagann?tha temple, see J. P. Das, Puri Paintings: the Chitrakara and his Work (New Delhi: Arnold Heinemann, 1982). 52.

A devotee outside the main gate of the Jagann?tha temple at the conclusion of the 1993 Rathy?tr?. Photo: Leedom Lefferts. Like the other silk ikat textiles of Nuapatna village, the G?tagovinda is woven on India's most common loom?the pit loom, where the male weaver sits at the edge of a pit with the breast beam stretching across his lap (fig. 14). Whereas I saw no women weaving in Nuapatna, they do, in fact, perform related tasks, such as reeling silk and warping the loom.53 Indeed, there is a special prohibition against women weaving the G?tagovinda cloth, and they will not even enter the workshop where this cloth is being woven. The exclusion of women as weavers conforms to the pattern within the male-dominated sevaka structure of the temple where status is linked with the male domain. The execution of this cloth requires special and stringent ritual observances, such as fasting and sexual abstinence during its production. Remarks made by the weavers suggest the magical transformative nature of the G?tagovinda textile: "People are afraid to weave this cloth."54 In this regard, their work sets them apart from the other craftspeople in Nuapatna who also weave silk ikat. Indian weavers could improve their status by creating finer and purer commodities, such as silk rather than cotton. The issue here, however, is not only one of purity, but of power, perhaps a perceived uncontrollable power. It seems that the weavers of the G?tagovinda cloth and the dait?s have much in common?both may be described as artisans or ritual specialists who engage in work considered dangerous and polluting; consequently, their status is also ambiguous. While Sudama Guin has received recognition for his craft at the state and national levels?he was awarded the National Craftsman's Award in 1976?among both artisan and temple communities his status is contested. The Gau?J?ya weavers?Guin's hereditary caste?are also known as Kosa K?tiya, people who extract thread from cocoons, and, by extension, kill silkworms. Because of this, the Asin? p?tar? caste considers the Gau?J?ya p?tar?s inferior. And within the temple culture, although his textiles are instrumental in defining key ritual moments and players, Guin and his family are not acknowledged as sevakas; they receive no sari-binding nor is fire from the temple kitchen provided to light their funeral pyre. Guin has taken the unprecedented step of 53. This phenomenon is not unique to Orissa. Gender and skill hierarchies among weavers, and other artisan communities, are characteristic of north India in general. The notable exception is India's Northeast?Assam, Manipur, Nagaland?where women weave on backstrap looms. 54. These comments recall those I have received from other craftspeople in relation to the creation of special imagery. Brasscaster Jaidev Baghel of Kondagaon, Bastar district, Madhya Pradesh, speaks of how certain deities are "dangerous" and their making is restricted to old men. See Katherine F. Hacker, "Continuities and Transformations among Living Sculptural Traditions: Wax-thread Metal Images of Eastern India," Ph.D. diss., University of Pennsylvania, 1993, pp. 173-174. 55. About ten years ago, Guin appealed to the Jagann?tha Temple Managing Committee, the governing board of the temple, which consists of the Raja of Puri, the Collector, and four sevakas among others. According to Guin, there were members on the board who were sympathetic to his case. The committee, however, did not rule in his favor.

He appears to be the first artisan to actually petition for entry.55 As Guin's cloth is the object of a complex series of exchanges within the temple culture, Guin would like this to be acknowledged, and acknowledged through the status of sevaka, as are other hereditary artisan groups. Perhaps his motivation is also partly financial since, in addition to the inherent high prestige, sevakas are now awarded a pension by the government. I would suggest that forms of contestation exist at other levels of this great religious and economic institution. In recent years, the control of the Rathy?tr? has been contested between the dait?s, the traditional authority, and the state government, which increasingly dominates the event. This rivalry is played out each year, with the police in riot gear overseeing events on the ground, the dhoti-clad dait?s orchestrating from above on the chariots (see fig. 9). The Rathy?tr??religious event and public spectacle?is being promoted as one of Orissa's major tourist attractions. Japanese film crews jostle with incense and coconut-bearing pilgrims for a better glimpse of Lord Jagann?tha. The 1994 Rathy?tr? was even televised live on Doordarshan, India's national television. As a means of demonstrating their ultimate power over the ritual, the dait?s at the 1993 Rathy?tr? withheld the image of Lord Jagann?tha, upsetting the scheduled return of the deities to their temple residence. By extension, the Jagann?tha temple itself actively strives to enhance its prestige by prohibiting the sale of non vegetarian food and the playing of film music in front of the temple and along the Grand Road. Shopkeepers are encouraged to play bhajans and other devotional music. The local Municipal Council justifies this decision by citing other major Hindu holy places?Rishikesh, Dwarka, Brindavan, Mathura?that impose these regulations. Mr. Maheswar Mohanty, the Council's chairman, states "Sri Kshetra, as Puri is known, was no less important that these pilgrim centres."56 By affiliating itself with canonical Hindu institutions, Jagann?tha's regional cult is positioning itself in the national arena.
