<plain_text><page sequence="1">Leonard Bark?n, Nature's Work of Art: The Human Body as Image of the World, New Haven and London, Yale University Press, 1975. In-8, x-291 p. Leonard Barkan, associate professor of English at Northwestern University, in Nature's Work of Art, gives us a learned and well organized study of one of the most enlightening analogies of litera ture, for (as Angus Fletcher writes in Allegory: The Theory of a Symbolic Mode, 1964, p. 71) : "When each part of the human body is made to stand for a particular part of the body politic, the subdividing process shows the most obvious kind of unity in diversity ; both bodies are being anatomized and the parts of both are found to correspond isomorphically to each other." As Pope says : All are but parts of one stupendous whole, Whose body nature is, and God the soul. Within that universe there is the human body seen philosophically (man and the cosmos), sociologically and politically (man and the state), and aesthetically (man and art)?and all these, in the end, are part of one gigantic whole as well. In three chapters in which the critical and the historical are harmonized and many disparate ideas brought together with grace as well as erudition, the author covers such matters as the organic theory of the commonwealth and the Mystical Body of Christ as discussed by the theologians, aptly making references to characters as diverse as St. Augustine, Falstaff, and Hobbes, Vitruvius, Ben</page><page sequence="2">510 comptes rendus Jonson, and Alanus de Insulis. Discordia Concors indeed I The reader will be grateful that Professor Barkan marshals all his evidence to inform rather than to impress and, with admirable skill in presenting it all in a lucid and interesting way, makes it add up to a learned humanitarian discourse and not an inhuman mass of undigested filing eards, the sort of dead mass so often referred to politely as a "monument" of scholarship. Moreover, all this groundwork is then put to good use, for the book concludes with two meet and meaty chapters in which the anthropomorphic allegory is seen at work in two masterworks of literature : Astrophil and Stella and The Faerie Queene, two works in which "a corporeal iconography and allegory that image forth multiplicity and unity" demonstrate how Elizabethan philosophical, political, and artistic theories are derived from and interpenetrate a conservative and typically Renaissance view of man as the measure of all things and the creature whose very anatomy, as well as the reason which guides it and the soul which gives it its rationale, guides him in his proper relations to the divine right of kings and the divine plan for the world. This world of proportion just and due is shaken by Milton's treat ment of the cosmos "on its own terms" and Professor Barkan echoes Milton scholars in repeating that "Milton's cosmology is uniquely literal and empirical." The king as head, the human body as image of the commonwealth or the cosmos, no longer serve the insights of the philosophical poet. It is the end of an era. Professor Barkan concludes : The concerns of more recent times, the self-doubting creator, nature and the world viewed for their own sakes, the belief in chaos and inef?ability, are innately different from the feelings which produced the microcosmic image of the body. The loss of the certainties about poet, cosmos, and proportion has not been consistent or total since 1650, but the poetry of the Renaissance is the last which celebrated all these certain ties. All the rest is modern literature. For the fuller understanding and appreciation of Renaissance literature and the need for and direction of the break which poets such as Milton decided, dared and did effect, a study like Nature's Work of Art was necessary. That it has been so thoroughly researched and so readably written is cause for both admiration and joy. This is one of those books recommended to the attention of "all serious scholars" which can be approached without trepidation or any fear of boredom, not at all one of those large works which it would be superfluous to praise and depressing to consult. You will not only learn a great deal from Nature's Work of Art, by its very nature, but will enjoy the experience, for it is a work of art, didactic but teaching delightfully. You will enjoy reading it. New York. L.R.N. Ashley.</page></plain_text>
