<plain_text><page sequence="1">BUDDHIST STATUE FROM MATHURA Near the Nepalese foothills of the Himalayas in 563 B.C. Gautama Buddha, the founder of Buddhism, was born as Prince Siddhirtha. Since it had been prophesied that he would grow to be either an emperor or a spiritual teacher, his father did everything in his power to keep him interested in a courtly and material life, lest he turn against his heritage and devote him self to things of the spirit. He even went so far as to have the prince, when he was only sixteen years old, married to his cousin Yasodhara. Moreover, when Siddhartha went out from I00</page><page sequence="2">THE BULLETIN OF THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART one of his palaces, arrangements were made to prevent him from seeing anything unpleasant, but his inevitable progress could not be blocked. Thus, it came about that one day he saw the contrast between ordinary human suffering and the tran quillity of a monk, and he determined to seek out the reason for these things; and it was not long thereafter that he made up his mind to renounce the princely life for that of a hermit, despite the opposition of his parents. When his wife finally bore him a child, therefore, he named it Rahula, or Hindrance, but did not let it deter him from his purpose. In the middle of a certain night, when even the guards were asleep, he made his escape to the forest. This is called the Great Renunciation. After trying one system after another, he one day observed an omen foretelling his enlightenment. So he went that night and sat under the Wisdom-Tree, where he was assaulted in many ways by Mara, the Evil One; and when all the assaults had met with failure, he reached down and touched the Earth, who sub stantiated his claim to the seat of wisdom. Then, being left alone to meditate, he came to comprehend the law of cause and effect, and thus was he the recipient of the Great Enlightenment. Seven weeks later, when the implications of his enlightenment had become clear to him, he delivered his First Sermon in the Deer Park at Benares, and this is known as the Turning of the Wheel of the Law. And finally, when he had acquired a large number of followers, to whom he had enunciated the doctrine for transmission, he died; that is, he gave up his body for the life of the spirit, which constitutes Unqualified Release. In the early centuries after the death of the Buddha his fol lowers found no cause to produce anthropomorphic representa tions to be worshipped, for each had been taught that the light was to be sought within himself, so that there was no place for a personal god. There were, however, anthropomorphic repre sentations of tree spirits, goddesses of fertility, and so on, worshipped by numerous non-Buddhist popular cults, some of the members of which were turning to Buddhism, while still unwilling to give up their devotional images. It seems probable that this conversion was contemporaneous with the gradual displacement of Hinayana Buddhism-which believed only in Sakyamuni (Gautama) and Maitreya (the Buddha of the Future)-by the Mahayana sect, with its vast multiplication IOI</page><page sequence="3">THE BULLETIN OF THE CLEVELAND MUSEUM OF ART of deities; and it is known that some of the popular gods were worshipped as though they were Buddhist. In fact, it was in answer to the demands of this new lay public that Buddhist images were produced to supplant the old cult figures. Thus it came about that statues of the Buddha began to be produced. In the middle of the first century A.D. the Kushans, who were a branch of the Yiieh Chih, left Bactria and moved south, con quering Afghanistan, Gandhara, and Northwest India, ulti mately possibly expanding as far east as Benares. Now, it hap pens that the subject peoples were non-image-worshipping members of the Hinayana sect, but this fact did not prevent the Kushan rulers from making, or having made, as they be came converted to Buddhism, statues of the gods that they wanted to worship. And it is one of these statues that is repro duced on the inside front cover of the Bulletin, having recently been acquired for the Edward L. Whittemore Collection.' It represents the Buddha seated in yoga pose, his missing right hand once raised in the gesture of protection, his left hand grasping the folds of his garment. The head is missing. The figure is of the reddish sandstone found in the neighborhood of Mathura (Muttra) and can be dated in the third century A.D., or perhaps late in the second century. Like all Mathura Buddhas of the period, it exhibits enormous physical energy, which is accentuated by the raised left arm and the clenched fist. Beneath the ankles the garment is patterned like half of a lotus, which is, among other things, a manifestation of deity.2 HOWARD HOLLIS 1 No. 4I.94. Height 2'. 2 See Ananda K.
