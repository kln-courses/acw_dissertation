<plain_text><page sequence="1">Mike Kelley: minor histories ? Statements, conversations, pro posals. Edited by John C. Welchman. 456 pp. with 62 b. &amp; w. ills. (MIT Press, Cambridge MA and Lon don, 2004), ?41.95/165. ISBN 0-262-61198-8. Minor histories contains a small portion of Mike Kelley's writings, including statements produced for catalogues and exhibitions, 'image-texts' accompanying works of art and writings on architecture and Ufology. It is the second in a series of three volumes, the first of which, Foul Perfection, contains longer essays written by Kelley on art and artists. Scripts for performances and videos are to be published in a third. A vivid picture of his work and persona emerges in Minor histories, auto biographical descriptions showing the traumatic imprint of having grown up in the American Midwest. For Kelley, salvaging significance from the debased circum stances of mass culture means a constant perversion and wrong-footing of convention. This can be both rewarding and frustrating ? rewarding in the breadth and humour of Kelley's heterogeneous thinking, frus trating in the heavy-handed morality and clumsy appeal to authoritative academic apparatus, such as footnoting. 'The Meaning is Confused Spatially, Framed' is a good statement of Kelley's Pynchonian inclusiveness: as Welchman puts it in his commentary, 'connecting experimental psychology, modernist sculpture, dance and design, anthropomorphic imagination, Chinese American cultural symbolism, sexuality and repression, personal history, simulations of nature ...'. The absence of illustrations included with the original essay in the catalogue to an exhibition held in Grenoble in 1999?2000 is a shame, for these provided clarification of the typically boggling Kelleyean connection between Isamu Noguchi's sets for Martha Graham's choreogra phy and Harry Harlow's 'open field test rooms' famous for clinical testing of chimpanzees in the 1950s. Welch man's straightforward textual support provides a steady frame in which Kelley's 'contrarian sensibility' can play.</page></plain_text>
