<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Analogy Theory of Thinking* Leila Haaparanta" Abstract The paper deals with a doctrine called the analogy theory of thinking. Its contemporary proponents have been Wilfried Sellars and Peter Geach. The paper is an attempt to give an exact formulation for one answer to the question concerning the relation of thought and speech. That answer is a reduced of Sellar's theory. A semiformal explication of the view is suggested by means of the classical analogy theory and Bochenski's treatment of that theory. It is argued that even if the analogy theory of thinking is subject to serious criticism, it offers us tools for conside- ring some old philosophical problems in a new way. I. Introduction 1. Competing Views In the philosophical literature there are a great number of remarks on the relation between thought and language but it is not easy to find any detailed treatment of the problem. Some philosophers, linguists and psychologists hold the view that thought can be clearly distinguished from overt language and it is ontologically prior to it; still, language is required for conveying our private thoughts to other people's minds. The opposite standpoint claims that thought has no independent existence prior to speech. Thought is some kind of inner speech originating from overt speech. It is the spoken language that either partly or completely determines our thought. Still, the descriptions suggested do not catch the details of the theories concerning the relation of thought and speech. The main reason for this is that the contrast of the two types of theories is only based on what kind of answers different theories give to the question: 'Which is ontologically prior, thought or speech?' Moreover, many senses can be given to the term 'ontological ' I am grateful to Professor Raimo Tuomela, who originally called my attention to this sub- ject and who also commented on earlier versions of this article.

We may talk about phylogenetic, ontogenetic or causal priority, for example. In addition to the ontological views, there is a classification of theories which is based on epistemology or on conceptual priority and posteriority. Two different answers can be given to the question concerning our knowledge of thinking and our coming to understand mental activity. Cartesian-minded philosophers argue that we have direct access to our thoughts by means of in- trospection, which enables us to understand the mental and have knowledge of thinking without using any concepts referring to overt public objects and actions. It is also claimed that we possess categories directly applicable to thought, and the properties, such as intentionality, which we ascribe to both thought and language, are properties of thought analogically extended to overt language. Philosophers opposing the Cartesian tradition, for example, Wilfrid Sellars, argue that overt public objects, events and actions are what we primarily know and understand and such categories as intentionality are directly applied to overt language and then analogically extended to thought. The former tradition is called internalist and the latter externalist by C.F. Delaney (1979), who tries to show that the philosopher who most completely carried through the externa- list programme was C.S. Peirce. The suggested opposition may naturally be challenged, but I shall not deal with that alternative in my paper. 2. Conceptual Preliminaries The topic of this essay is a doctrine called the analogy theory of thinking, which has been put forward by Sellars (1956, 1969, 1972) and Geach (1959). The formulation of a similar view can also be found in William of Ockham's texts, which have influenced Sellars' views. Sellars has adopted parts of Ock- ham's theory, but he has contributed to developing the theory by paying atten- tion to the idea that our theory of thinking can be regarded as a theory of com- mon-sense psychology, in which the concept of thought has a similar role to that of theoretical concepts in scientific theories. Sellars stresses that mental episodes are theoretical entities postulated by common-sense psychology and that verbal episodes are the entities of the model of this theory. The basic theses of the theory of thinking are the following: (1) Thought is analogous to speech. (2) Speech is conceptually prior to thought, that is, prior in the order of knowing. (3) Thought is ontologically prior to speech, that is, prior in the order of being. My purpose here is to try to specify one answer to the question concerning the relation of thought and speech, which is a kind of reduced analogy theory</page><page sequence="3">The Analogy Theory of Thinking 171 of thinking. In this paper, I shall use the terms 'speech', 'overt language' and 'spoken language' as synonyms. The theory is expressible by means of the theses (1) and (2). Ontological considerations are completely omitted from the theory. Before going into details, I shall say something of the key concepts of the proposed view, which are the concepts of analogy, metaphor and model. When we talk about analogy, we usually think of similarity. The concept of metaphor, or the transfer of meaning, is commonly used in poetics meaning there a comparison in which no 'as' occurs. The comparison is compounded out of two parts, the naming or the describing part and the name of the thing named or described. The term 'abbreviated comparison' is occasionally used as a synonym for 'metaphor'. There are many fresh metaphors in lyrics (e.g., Baudelaire's metaphor 'the enormous laugh of the sea'), while a great number of pale metaphors can be found in newspapers. 'Sufficiently pale' metaphors are continuously used in everyday language, 'sufficiently pale' being such metaphors as are so worn-out that their metaphorical origin is not even real- ized any more (e.g., to save time, to waste time, an illuminating example). It is similarity that is at issue also in metaphors. For example, we pay attention to certain similarities between time and money, which makes us transfer words primarily applicable to money to time as well (e.g., to save, to waste). There are many classifications for the uses of the concept of model in phil- osophy of science1. Likewise, there are definitions of the concept of model which are meant to be applicable to all kinds of cases. In general, the model means the thing or the system, which is an imitation or a copy of another thing or a system. Behind the concept of model you can also see the concept of simi- larity or analogy. It is usually thought that the object copied and the model are analogous. The word 'analogy' means 'according to reason' (Greek: ana, 'according to', and logos, 'reason'). Originally, as a mathematical concept, it meant pro- portion. There are some new interesting discussions on analogy and meta- phor2. However, here I shall rely on some of the ideas of the classical analogy theory put forward by Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and Cardinal Cajetan. Fol- lowing them, we can distinguish between three ways of talking about analogy: (1) analogy of terms, or analogy of names, or analogical predication ( analogia nominum), (2) analogy of things, or analogy of being (analogia entis), and 1 For example, see Hesse (1970) and Hermerén (1974). í hor example, see Leatherdale ( 1974), Ortony ( 1979), Sacks ( 1979), Lakoff and Johnson (1980), and Ross (1981).</page><page sequence="4">172 Leila Haaparanta (3) analogical argument (analogia rationis), which is connected with the questions of inductive logic. The classical analogy theory and the analogy theory of thinking relate mainly to the analogy of terms and the analogy of things. We may say that events, objects or systems are analogous, thereby meaning that they have similar properties or a similar structure. We may argue that an atom and a solar system are analogous, that is, they are structurally similar to each other; an atom is compounded out of a core and electrons in a way similar to the way a solar system is compounded out of the sun and planets which revolve around the sun. Objects a and b can be said to be 'not the same, or identical, but analogous'. This example is an example of the analogy of things (analogia entis). The words of our language can be divided into univocal and multivocal words. For example, the word 'town' is univocal; say, in the sentences 'Lon- don is a town' and 'Paris is a town' we mean the same thing by the word 'town'. The ideal of the language of science has included the demand for the univoc- ity and the definability of all the words of the language, except for primitive terms. Multivocity has two forms. Terms are totally multivocal, for example, equivocal, (e.g., bank ) or terms are analogous, that is, they are neither com- pletely the same nor completely different in meaning (e.g., A saves money and A saves time). In the example the verb 'to save' has in part the same meaning in these two uses. However, all that 'to save' can mean in the former case can- not be found in the latter case (e.g., A cannot deposit money in a bank. A cannot deposit time in a bank, except in a new metaphorical sense, which I am not proposing here). There has often been a change in the history of language to the effect that words have been transferred from a concrete to an abstract use. Such words as 'inflation' or 'congress' originally had a concrete meaning. Likewise, it often happens in science that concepts applicable in a known area are applied in an unknown area (e.g., water waves, sound waves and light waves). It is analogi- cal predication, or the analogy of terms, that is in question in these examples. Thus, for example, 'to save , ' is analogous to 'to save2', and 'to conceive/ that is used at the moment t is analogous to 'to conceive2' that is used at the mo- ment t' This form of analogy is normally based on the analogy of things, ac- tions or events to which the terms refer. Accordingly, a concept often applies, or a concept has been applied, to an object or to a set of objects originally and to other objects secondarily. We know one part of the world primarily, namely concrete objects and our every- day world, and we possess concepts or a language applicable to this area.</page><page sequence="5">The Analogy Theory of Thinking 173 When we become familiar with new objects, we start using old concepts loaded with partly new meanings. This happens on the basis that the new things that we have become familiar with are in some respects similar to the things we have known previously. II. The Indirect Knowledge of Thinking I. The Problem and the Possible Answers It may now be asked if the analogy theory of thinking as it is expressed by the theses (1) and (2) really gives us any help. It may be admitted that we do have knowledge of the spoken language, but we may wonder how it is possible to know anything else through the spoken language. This is, however, what is assumed in the analogy theory of thinking, in which overt language is con- strued as the model of thought. There are at least three types of analogous expressions which concern speech and thought: ( 1 ) A unit of speech, S, means that p. A unit of thought, T, means that p. (or: T is the thought that p.) or: A says that p. A thinks that p. (1') A unit of speech, s, means c. A unit of thought, t, means c. (In these state- ments 'c'is not a sentence as 'p' is in the first two examples.) (2) What A says ('S') is true. What A thinks ('T') is true. (3) We have spoken words and a spoken language. We have mental words and a mental language (or: words of a language of thought and a language of thought). In these examples, the expressions 'means that p' 'that p', V, 'is true', 'word', and 'language' are used as analogous expressions. Here I shall concen- trate on the first problem, especially as it comes out in 'means that p 'construc- tions. Let us suppose that it is known that a unit of speech, S, means that p. Are we now justified in saying that a unit of thought, T, means that p?The possible answers to our problem are the following: (1) We are justified, because thought is reducible to silent speech. (2) The expression is meaningless, hence, we are not justified. (3) We are justified, because the expression is meaningful, even if thought is not reducible to silent speech.</page><page sequence="6">174 Leila Haaparanta If thought and speech were syntactically and semantically identical, our meaning-statements formulated in a metalanguage concerning thought and speech, for example, 'A unit of speech, S, means that p', A unit of thought, T, means that p' or ' A says that p' and 'A thinks that p' where 'p' expresses the meaning-content of a unit of speech and a unit of thought, would be univocal, that is, they would apply in the same sense to all the things, in this case to both the unit of speech and the unit of thought, to which they are applied. If thought and speech were syntactically and semantically totally dissimilar, our meaning-statements concerning units of thought and units of speech would be totally equivocal. Thus, in case of mere equivocity, in the statements 'A thinks that p' and 'A says that p' 'p' would mean two totally different things. If we fixed the meaning of 'p'so that 'p' would be applied to the unit of speech, then, 'p' as applied to the unit of thought, would be meaningless for us. The analogy theory, which gives the third answer, states that the meaning- statements concerning thought and speech are used neither univocally nor completely equivocally. The meaning-statement 'p'is not used in exactly the same way in all the cases where it is properly used. Nor are the differences be- tween the two uses such as to make us say that there is no connection between the two uses. Instead of choosing the identity of the units and the univocity of the meaning-statements or the dissimilarity of the units and the total equivoc- ity of the meaning-statements, the present theory chooses the similarity of the units and the analogy of the meaning-statements. 2. An Excursion into the Classical Analogy Theory It is illuminating to make an excursion into the classical analogy theory put forward mainly by Aristotle, Thomas Aquinas and Cajetan. The problem which we find in the theory of thinking is exactly the same in the analogy theory of medieval philosophers, and it is put forward by many philosophers writing on religious language nowadays. What follows is not meant to be a de- tailed historical study of the concept of analogy. However, the medieval anal- ogy theory can serve as a kind of heuristic device for developing the analogy theory of thinking. The question of the knowledge of thinking is of the same nature as the question of the knowledge of God in medieval philosophy. It is the central idea of the medieval analogy theory that we can make positive statements about God, which are meaningful statements. The analogy is called the anal- ogy of names or the analogy of terms. The terminology follows Plato's and Aristotle's usage, according to which nouns, verbs and adjectives are all con-</page><page sequence="7">The Analogy Theory of Thinking 175 sidered to be names3. In short, the analogy theory is purported to justify the so-called transcategorial statements. In the philosophy of religion it means that in terms of the analogy theory it can be shown that the predicates that are applied to the things in the world, are meaningfully applicable to God without the danger of anthropomorphism. In the philosophy of thinking it means that in terms of the analogy theory we can show that the meaning-statements that are expressed concerning speech can also be meaningfully expressed concern- ing thought without reducing thought to silent speech. Let us assume that we have two statements: (a) Socrates is wise. (b) God is wise. The term 'wise' is primarily applied to Socrates. The principle of univocity maintains that each term should be kept strictly to its defined sense. However, univocity in theology would lead to anthropomorphism. But total equivocity is also unacceptable in the traditional theory, since it makes complete non- sense of positive theological language4. The idea of the analogous use of two or more instances of the same term is proposed to solve the problem. There is plenty of discussion of analogy and related matters in Aristotle's, Thomas Aquinas' and their followers' writings. One of the most important texts is De Nominum Analogia (1498) by Cardinal Cajetan. There is also much recent discussion of the classical analogy theory, for example, by Klubertanz (1960), Mclnerny (1961, 1971), Ross (1971, 1981), and Mondin (1975). Some of the main problems have concerned the interpretations of Thomas Aquinas' analogy theory and the reliability of Cajetan's interpreta- tion. As I mentioned, I shall use parts of the classical analogy theory as heuris- tic aids, and these parts are the basic ideas of the analogy theory in the philos- ophy of religion, which are taken from Thomas Aquinas, and the types of analogy put forward by Cajetan. The problem is the possibility of positive statements about thinking. Negative statements are regarded here as semanti- cally unproblematic. If we want to express something accurate by sentences like 'God is wise' and 'God is good', we must face the problem of how to apply the terms 'good' and 'wise' to God. It was stated already that the reduction of our knowledge of God to a basis of univocal concepts would be anthropomorphism. Thomas Aquinas accepted some parts of negative theology, but he also developed the semantics of positive statements concerning God. According to his theory, 3 See Plato, 'Cratylus', and also Aristotle, 'De interpretatione'. 4 See Ross (1971), pp. 35-74.</page><page sequence="8">176 Leila Haaparanta one of the things in question is primarily named by the term and the others are named by it because of their relation to what is primarily named. There are two forms of this mode of being named: either several things are named with reference to what is primarily named by the term ( multorum ad unum) or one thing is named with reference to another which is primarily named by the term (unius ad alterum; e.g., God and the things in the world)5. The distinction between the order of knowing, or the terminological order ( ordo nominis), and the order of being (ordo rerum) is central in Aquinas' theory. In Summa contra gentiles (Capitulum XXXIV) he writes: 'When a de- scription is used in a related sense (by analogy), priority in terminology may diverge from factual priority. For terminological order follows the sequence in which we get to know the things. - Sometimes it happens that what comes first in fact is not known to us first.' De Nominum Analogiaby Cajetan is a more detailed presentation of the analogy theory. To a great extent, his work is meant to be an interpretation of Thomas Aquinas. Whether Cajetan's book is reliable as a commentary or not, it is a useful book on analogy and the only detailed presentation of the matter known to the history of philosophy. Cajetan's work relies on some of Aristotle's remarks on the topic. Aristotle writes as follows: 'Likeness should be studied, first, in the case of things be- longing to different genera, the formula being 'A:B::C:D' (e.g., as sight is in the eye, so is reason in the soul, and as calm is in the sea, so is windlessness in the air)'6. According to Aristotle, the basic proportion studied is the follow- ing: 'as A is in B or to B, C is in D or to D'7. In addition to this 'proper propor- tionality', Aristotle also discusses the cases of 'improper proportionality' or metaphors: if A:B::C:D and there is a name for the C:D relation but there is no name for the A:B relation, then we often transfer the name of the C:D rela- tion to name the A:B relation. In his De Nominum Analogia Cajetan reduces all analogous terms to three modes of analogy. One of them is analogy of pro- portionality. He maintains that according to the true sense of the term and the practice of Aristotle, it is this mode that constitutes analogy. Analogy of proportionality is considered by Cajetan to be the same as Thomas Aquinas' analogy secundum intentionem et secundum esse. Cajetan gives the following definition of analogy of proportionality: those things are called analogous by proportionality which have a common name, and the no- tion expressed by this name is proportionally the same. Cajetan also gives an example: to see by corporeal vision and by intellectual vision are indicated by 5 See Thomas Aquinas (1974), Capitulum XXXIV. 6 Aristotle, Topica, I, 17, 108a7-ll. ' Aristotle, Metapnysica, iU4öb/.</page><page sequence="9">The Analogy Theory of Thinking 177 the common term 'to see', because just as 'to understand' presents something to the mind, so 'to see' presents something to the animated body (Cajetan, 1953, pp. 24-25). The name 'proportion' means a definite relation of one quantity to an- other, while the name 'proportionality' means a similarity of two proportions. Cajetan remarks that philosophers have taken the terms 'proportion' and 'proportionality' from the sphere of mathematics and extended their use, which comes out in the idea of analogy of proportionality. Analogy of propor- tionality concerns the relations of relations. The starting-point is a mathe- matical proportion, for example, 4 is to 2 as 8 is to 4, which is an example of the relation of double. The term 'double' is a univocal term; it has the same meaning in all contexts of use. As Cajetan stresses, this idea is extended in the analogy theory, in which no sameness of relations is demanded. In the propor- tions ARjB and CR2D, Rx does not have to be the same as R2. Instead, in the analogy theory it is argued that Rļ is similar to R2, and the term or the name 'R' is analogous, that is, its first occurrence ('Rļ') is analogous to its second occurrence ('R2'). « 3. A Solution of the Problem The interesting point in the medieval analogy theory is that we have one language and two worlds or categories as the following figure shows: ^ -► world j language ^ ► world2 The language is primarily applied to world2. We know about world! just as much as world2 tells us about it. In philosophy of religion the idea is expressible as follows: - ► God language ► the things (e.g., creatures) of the world e.g. God wise Socrates</page><page sequence="10">178 Leila Haaparanta As was mentioned above, in terms of the analogy theory we can show that the meaning-statements that are expressed concerning speech can also be meaningfully expressed concerning thought without reducing thought to si- lent speech. The analogy theory of thinking proposes the idea of the concep- tual priority of speech, in other words, the position that speech is prior to thought in the order of knowing. Speech is more familiar to us than the units of thought; we understand the discourse on thought by means of the discourse on speech, although the properties and the relations of the units of thought are not the same as the properties and the relations of the units of speech, that is, although our knowledge of the units of speech does not reveal us everything that there is in the units of thought. Thus, in the analogy theory of thinking we have the following basic idea: the units of thought ^ (object language^ metalanguage - ^ the units of speech (object language2) e.g. ► T means that p ----- &gt; 5 Let us consider the following statements: (a) S means that p. (b) T means that p. Our problems are the following: A) What is the unit to which the predicate truly applies? The analogy theory of thinking answers that it is the unit of speech. B) How does it apply to the unit of thought, then? The analogy theory of thinking answers that it applies to the unit of thought in accord with analogy of proportionality, or analogy based upon the relations of relations. If we now adopt the Sellarsian functional theory of meaning, we may say that the unit of thought Tis to the other units of thought, observation</page><page sequence="11">The Analogy Theory of Thinking 179 and behaviour as S is to the other units of speech, observation and behaviour. The units T and S have similar relations, which are expressed by the statement 'P- III. The Formulation of the Analogy Theory of Thinking As we have seen, the analogy theory of Thomas Aquinas concerns the similarity of meaning of a term in two contexts of use, hence not directly the similarity of things. In the analogy theory of thinking the analogy between dis- course of speech and discourse of thought comes to be the same thing as the Aquinian analogy of terms. Let us call it the analogy of reports. We may say that our meaning-statements give reports on the units of thought and speech in a given metalanguage. In the analogy theory of thinking the meaning-statements and other predi- cations of thought and speech units are analogous, which means that they are similar in meaning. The thought and speech units are also analogous, that is, they have similar relations. The analogy of predication is dependent on and determined by the analogy of thought and speech units in the sense that the predications are analogous if the thought and speech units have similar rela- tions, similar structural positions or functions in relation to respective wholes, which are observation, thought and behaviour, and observation, speech and behaviour. The thesis that overt language is a model of thought can be under- stood in two senses. (1) The spoken language as a system which is analogous to the language of thought is a model of thought. (2) The metalanguage as a way of talking about the language of thought in the same way as about the spoken language is a model of thought. The analogy in the analogy theory of thinking can now be dealt with in a way similar to the way in which Bochenski ( 1971) treats the Aquinian analogy of terms. The fundamental notion is that of a semantic complex, which is ex- pressed by the following formula: 'the name a signifies in the language / the content /of the thing jť (symbolically: M(a,l,fx)). In our theory of thinking the meaning-statement 'p'(e.g. 'S means that p'; ' T means that p') means cer- tain contents of a unit of speech and a unit of thought. These contents are pre- cisely the functions which the units of speech and the units of thought have in the spoken language and in the language of thought. The two instances of 'p', 'pj 'and 'p2 are the translations of the units 5 and Tin the metalanguage / '. 'p' is analogous in the way that its instances 'p¡' and 'p2' are similar in meaning. 'S 'names a unit of an object language, which is the spoken language, 'T' names a unit of another object language, which is the language of thought, and 'p 'is the translation of those units. Hence, 'S', 'T' 'p' 'S means that/? 'and</page><page sequence="12">180 Leila Haaparanta T means that p' are all expressions of the metalanguage /'. Consequently, we have a common metalanguage for two object languages, and the metalan- guage contains the translations of the sentences of the object languages and the means to refer to the expressions of these languages. Following Bochenski, I shall assume that every relation of meaning implies a reference to a language. But I do not take two metalanguages into my for- mulas, because the meaning-statement 'p'is not formulated in any inner me- talanguage but only in some overt metalanguage. We describe our thoughts as meaning something in the semantical terms that we usually apply only to speech. But what is the meaning of 'p' in these two contexts? 'p' can be said to denote the units which 'S'and T'name and to mean the function f2 of the sen- tence named by 'S' and the function f, of the sentence of the language of thought named by T! We could also say that p means 5 as the performer of the function f2 and T as the performer of the function //. In Bochenski's symbolism, the symbol '/'means the content, which deter- mines the thing whose content it is. The units of thought and speech are the things in our theory of thinking to which the reports attribute certain functions in the corresponding structures. The unit of thought, T, has certain relations to other units of thought, to observation and to behaviour. The same is true of the unit of speech, S, and speech, observation and behaviour, respectively. Hence, the function f¡ of Tis determined by the relations of T to other units of thought, to observation and to behaviour. Likewise, the function f2 of S is determined by the relations of S to other units of speech, to observation and to behaviour. T and S have similar relations, that is, f¡ # f2 but f¡ is similar to f2. We shall use the following formulas: (i) M(p2,l',f2,S): p2 means in the language /' the function f2 of the unit of speech S. (ii) M(Pl,l'f„T): Pj means in the language /' the function f, of the unit of thougt T. For example, M(lt is raining., English, f2, Es regnet.) M( It is raining., English, fb T) 8 For the sake of simplicity, I write 'p 'without quotation marks in the formula of the seman- tic complex.</page><page sequence="13">The Analogy Theory of Thinking 181 In this example, the object language is German and the metalanguage is Eng- lish. It is assumed that T' names a unit of thought of a German speaker. In our second example, the situation is as follows: M('It is raining.', English, f2, It is raining.) M('lt is raining. ' English, f¡, T) In this case English is both our object language and our metalanguage. Here T'is assumed to name a unit of thought of an English speaker. In our exam- ples we have replaced 'S' by German and English sentences, which are ex- pressions of our object languages, but left the symbol T' untouched, because the report 'p' is our only access to what 'T' denotes. This is precisely the key point of the analogy theory of thinking. The analogy theory starts from the supposition that we know something about the function of the unit of speech. This part of the meaning of the report 'p ' is known to us. But the function of the unit of thought cannot be known in any similar way. Only the part of its function f¡ that overlaps a part of the func- tion f2 may be known by us. Thus, we have to try to know f¡ by means of our knowledge of f2. IV. Concluding Remarks What I have given in this article is a semiformal explication of a theory which bears the name 'analogy theory of thining'. However, this theory is im- mediately subject to serious criticism. First of all, even if we manage to repre- sent that theory in a semiformal framework and even if we thus succeed in giv- ing it an exact content, it seems that we cannot prove any interesting results by means of this machinery. The above specification of the analogy theory of thinking also reveals the main weakness of the theory, which is that we do not come to know by means of our model in which respect thought differs from overt language and what thus makes thought what it essentially is. We might even argue that since we do not get this information through our model, we do not come to know anything relevant of our thought. Despite its defects, the proposed theory offers us a method of considering certain old philosophical problems in a new way. For example, by adopting the analogy theory of thinking we can get rid of 'intentionally inexisting ob- jects'. As William of Ockham already stated, 'an act of understanding can sig- nify something just as well as any sign.'9 We do not need any additional inten- 9 See Ockham (1974), p. 74.</page><page sequence="14">182 Leila Haaparanta tionally inexisting objects for our thinking. Instead, we may use the following strategy: The expression 'A person A thinks that p'can be formulated as Tis the thought that p 'and, further, as T means that p We may continue our ana- lysis by saying that there is some unit of speech S, which means that p, S has the function f2, and Thas the function f„ which is similar to the function f2. What this means is that our discourse on thought and its intentionality is anal- ogous to our discourse on speech and its intentionality and the intentionality of thought can be understood by means of linguistic meaning. Histories of natural languages and etymologies of words also offer plenty of material which parallels the line of thought that I have here suggested. The material I am referring to consists of the mental vocabulary of natural lan- guages. It shows that primarily we have concepts for overt perceptible acti- vities. When we try to say something about the mental, we are compelled to resort to metaphorical language. For example, according to the Cartesian way of thinking, I know that I think (cogito), whereas according to the view which is a kind of historical epistemology, 'I know that I think' is further construed as 'I know that there is happening something that is like "riding on breathing'" (cogito &lt; co-agito &lt; cum animo agito). An exponent of this epistemology argues that the event which is my thinking is not knowable or conceptualiz- able in any other way than by referring to overt perceptible activities; what- ever the ontological order may be, the conceptual order goes from the beha- vioral to the mental. Similarly, the words 'act' and 'action' are of public origin, and they are extended to such expressions as 'mental act' and 'mental action'. Hence, the basic point of the analogy theory of thinking is simply the idea that thinking is not an evident phenomenon close to us. On the contrary, our knowledge of thinking is like our knowledge of God according to Thomas Aquinas. It is only reached indirectly by means of models, or by means of metaphorical ways of talking and thinking.
