Reviewed by Pascal Boyer. The subtitle may be deceptive. What is offered here is not so much a "new" account of religion, as something potentially more interesting, namely a sophisticated and clearly argued defence of a classical view, generally neglected in recent studies of religion. Guthrie's mam thesis is that anthropomorphism is the mam driving force and organising principle in religious representations the world over. This by itself is not really "new," but Guthrie offers a novel, psychologically grounded explanation for the systematic projection of human features and capacities that underlies most religious systems. The explanation is to be found in general cognitive principles that impose definite constraints on mental representations, from perceptual processes all the way up to "higher" domains such as cultural systems. Cognitive research has argued for decades that perceptual and cognitive processes are not "dumb," data-driven, automatic responses to regular patterns in the environment. They consist in an active process of shape and structure imposition, whereby the information available m the environment is made meaningful by matching it to complex templates. Perception is an active process, and strives to maximize the meanings that can be extracted m this way. Cats that treat falling leaves as prey, or people who see faces m rock formations, are involved m this process of imposing on experience the most complex templates compatible with the information given. Anthropomorphism, thus, is not just one aspect of particular religious beliefs. It is a crucial force in many domains of cultural representations. Guthrie documents the prevalence of anthropomorphic themes in art, philosophy, and science. Given this background, it should not be surprising that such themes are also fundamental in most religious systems, whatever their superficial differences. Most religious systems tend to over-emphasize the difference, strangeness, or transcendence of religious agencies. However, they would not carry intelligible meanings if such differences were not represented against the background of a massive anthropomorphisation of religious entities. Guthrie must be commended for paying attention to recurrent features of religious representations, which are too often neglected or treated as self-evident by cultural anthropologists. Also, he shows how traditional explanations of those features, particularly m terms of general human motivations such as fear, are insufficient. Most importantly, Guthrie stresses</page><page sequence="2">92 Reviews the continuity of religious representations and everyday cognition, a theme that is not really common in religious studies. If religious representations are acquired, stored, and transmitted by human mmds, then we must consider seriously what constraints such processes impose on the contents of religious systems. Such careful attention to psychological findings and hypotheses is rare, and is the mam reason why the book will be indispensable to all students of religion. Obviously, there are problems, too; for instance, it is not always clear why the "search for complexity" in cognitive processes should result in projections of human characteristics, and why only some characteristics of humans tend to be projected repeatedly. These, however, are questions for future investigation, and Guthrie's book shows why such questions are empirically tractable and how they should be approached in a general study of religious ideas.
