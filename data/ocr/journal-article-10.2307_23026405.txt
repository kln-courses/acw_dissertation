<plain_text><page sequence="1">Traces of Sun Worship in North America. It is asserted by some of the American Ethnologists that the heavenly bodies were never deified by any of the North American Races. Granting this to be, in some degree, true: That the luminaries, collectively or individually, were not elevated to the highest place in their worship, by any tribe or people in North America, — yet the celestial orbs, neverthe less, figured prominently in the list of supreme objects of worship, and many traces, at least, of this form of worship are found in the religions of aboriginal races of all ages, — from the oldest peoples down to the tribes of the present day, especially amongst those versed in astrology or astronomy.</page><page sequence="2">Miscellen und Bucherschau. 147 Although little is known of the Toltecs of Ancient Mexico, it is an established fact that astral worship was practiced by them. They paid homage to the sun and dedicated their earliest temples to him. The moon, also, they referenced as his wife and the stars were believed to be his sisters, according to the Mexican Licentiate, Don Mariano Veytia, in his „Historia Antigua'. The same writer describes the ruins of San Juan Teotihuacan, the most ancient architectural rema'ins of Mexico, which are situated about thirteen miles north east of the capital city. Of these, the largest pyramid, which measured six hundred and eighty feet in length at the base and was estimated at two hundred and twenty feet in height, was dedicated to Tonatiuh or Tonatricli, th6 sun; the next structure in size and importance was inscribed to Meztli, the moon On the summit of the former, a temple was erected, in which was placed an immense statue representing the sun, which faced toward the east. According to the accounts of Bernardino de Sahagun, a Spanish author of the sixteenth century, and one who was particularly cautious in his deductions and entirely reliable in his accounts of the religion of the Aztecs: — according to Sahagun, as set forth in his „Historia Universal do Nueva Espaiia", solar and lunur worship occurred in the Aztec religion, the sun with them being a spiritual conception. They believed that the heroes who fell in battle or died in captivity and women who died in child-birth, were immediately transported into the House of the Sun where they led a life of everlasting delight. From the broad tops of their teocallis or temples, the Aztec priests were in the habit of performing impressive, and, in too many cases, bloody, ceremonies, in which the heavenly bodies were made to take a pro minent part. After the fall of the Mexican Empire, vestiges of sun worship were frequently met with, Captain Fernando Alarcon, one of the old Spanish pioneers in „New Spain", mentioned having seen, in the year 1540, on the Colorado River, Indians who worshipped the sun. This same custom exists at present among the modern Pueblo Indians of New Mexico, Lieutenant A. W. Whipple, in Volume III of the Pacific Rail Road Reports, says of these people" they are now anxiously expecting the arrival of Montezuma; and it is related that in San Domingo, (one of the nineteen Pueblo towns) every morning at sunrise, a sentinel climbs to his house-top and looks eastward, to watch for his coming." Mr. Whipple also gives a tradition of these Indians, which assigns Acoti (another Pueblo village, situated in New Mexico on the Rio Grande del Norte, — the ancient Tiguex) as his birthplace; but the tale is so at variance with facts and so rich in imagination that it is evidently the invention of some fertile brain. The Spaniards who first communicated with the Pueblos, shortly after the Mexican Conquest, about the year 1539, evidently introduced the name of Montezuma II, and probably instilled into their minds this idea of his second advent. Thus the worship of heavenly bodies may have become blended with the deification of ancestors; them the sun may have taken the name of Montezuma Mr Whipple further states that these people „smoke to the sun that he may send them antelope to kill, Indians to trade with and save them from enemies." Among the Navajos also, the same observer remarks, „the sun, moon and stars are sacred, as the authors of seasons of rain and of harvest." He also says of the Zuiiians (an allied tribe, living in one town near the Pueblo Villages), „Beneath the apparent multiplicity of gods, these Indians have a firm faith in the Deity, the unseen Spirit of God. His name is above all things sacred, and like Jehovah of the Jews, too holy to be spoken. Montezuma is his son and their king. The sun, moon and stars are His works, worthy of their adoration." The ancient Pueblos of the Pacific Slope of the United States, whose ruined stone structures are found so numerously throughout portions of Colorado, Utah, New Mexico, Arizona and probably Nevada, held the sun in high esteem, at least, if they did not worship it. This is shown in the situation of the houses in many localities. In the Canon of the Rio Mancos, for example, the dwellings are almost invariably found secreted in the cliffs of the western bluff, and from their roofs the inhabitants were wont to salute the king of day, as he raised himself above the eastern plateau. Among the Moqui tribe, who to-day occupy seven towns built on high table-hands in northern Arizona, traces of this form of worship still obtain. The religion of their fore-fathers 10*</page><page sequence="3">148 Miscellen und Bucherschau. (the ancient Pueblos who erected the buildings which now lie in ruins through the land) seems to have degenerated into a mere custom, the origin of which has been long lost sight of in their obscure traditions. Thus in the course of time, it seetns probable, the worship of celestial orbs has given place to hero-worship; solar worship, to anthropomorphism, and it is said that the Moquis have ultimately become imbued with the belief that it is a Messiah, in tho form of one of their own ancestors, that is Montezuma, the former king of the Aztecs, whom they are expecting to arrive from the east. The Moquis, the Pueblos and the Zufiis (or Zunians) are cognate tribes and doubtless are remnants of one of the ancient Nahuatlac races; in other words, they sprung frum an ancestral stock which was closely allied to the Toltecs, Aztecs, Tezcucans, etc., hence the similarity of their customs. As the first faint streak of red lights up the low horizon tall, dark figures appear on the parapets of the Seven Moqui towns and remain facing the dawn until the sun has appeared entirely to view. Then the muffled forms drop away slowly and sadly one by one, for another morn has brought disappointment to the souls of many that have watched so eagerly and persistently for the coming of the great Montezuma. The rputine of another Moqui day has commenced; all is bustle and life and the subdued hum of household occupation floats out drowsily 011 the sullen, sultry air and the sound of the hundred flour-mills (metates) grinding steadily on every side, seems, as it issues from the doors and windows of the stone houses, to pause in mid-air like a droning bee. Then scores of busy figures repair with their earthen vessels to the verge of the steep bluffs and disappear in the crevices of the rocks below, in quest of water. Having presented the foregoing facts, in support of the assumption that solar adoration entered to some extent into the religions of some of the American races, we may sum them up briefly as follows: 1. Fetichism being the commonest form of idolatry, especially amongst the lower races of man, most tribes whose religion is polytheistic, venerate the sun. 2. We can detect vestiges of sun worship in the ruins of the Toltec and Aztec temples and pyramids and also in the statues which were placed within them. 3. We can observe traces of it in the traditions and observances of savage and semi barbarous tribes at the present day. 4 We notice indications of it in the hieroglyphics or picture-writings of most North American tribes, ancient and modern, in which the sun symbol occurs frequently. 5. Also in the position of ruined stone houses which look toward the east, the larger rectangular buildings of the Pacific Slope being built so as to face the cardinal points. 6. Finally, we can observe signs of this worship in the orientation of dead bodies in graves. If we accept these facts, there can be no reasonable doubts that the worship of the sun entered to some degree into the religions of the aboriginal Americans, but exactly to what extent we have not the means of determining.1) Edwin A.
