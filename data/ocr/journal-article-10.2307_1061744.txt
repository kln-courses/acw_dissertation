<plain_text><page sequence="1">G. C. Oosthuizen ISAIAH SHEMBE AND THE ZULU WORLD VIEW I Anthopologists and theologians have written on the movement founded by Isaiah Shembe-probably the most important mes- sianic figure in South Africa-namely, the Church of the Nazarites. Often these discussions concentrated only on the movement itself with sporadic reference to the Zulu world view, and as a result the real issues involved were either distorted or received super- ficial, journalistic description. The "Church" of the Nazarites is a typical example of a re- vitalization movement in which nativistic trends form the basis on which it flourishes. It is thus not a church in the Christian sense of the word as Jesus Christ is the church and the church is Jesus Christ; neither is it a Christian sect where the emphasis is on Jesus Christ plus the Sabbath or adult baptism; rather, it is a nativistic movement in which a conscious attempt has been made to revive or perpetuate selected aspects of the Zulu culture. The founder of this movement was born about 1867 and died on May 2, 1935, after standing for three hours in cold water in a river administering adult baptism. Shembe, the son of a farm labourer, was illiterate. He had no educational contact with whites, with the result that he developed no sense of spiritual dependence on their culture. Although a sickly child, he developed into a healthy young man. 1</page><page sequence="2">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View Already as a boy he experienced several revelations, and through the medium of lightning he received his call. His somatic type differed very little from that of the average diviner (isangoma), which is different from the heavy type of the chief. He had the qualities of a seer (oboniswayo) but was not a diviner, although healing was one of his major activities. Very little is known of his contact with Christianity. He was, however, baptized in 1906 by an African minister of the African Baptist church, in which he was eventually ordained as a minister. Before he became a member of this church he was already known as a healer. He became known through his travels in Natal, South Africa, mostly by foot and ox wagon and very seldom by bus or by train; he drove out demons, gave people holy water as a means of healing or purification, and preached under open skies, in kraals, and alongside pools. In 1911 he seceded from his church after he became convinced that Saturday, the Old Testament Sabbath, was the special day of Jehova and that all the ritual prohibitions associated with it should be observed most meticulously. He thus founded the Church of the Nazarites and claimed for his movement all the verses in the Old Testament referring to Nazarites. In 1913 he visited Nhlangakazi, which became the movement's holy mountain, for the first time. Ekuphakameni, about eighteen miles from Durban, Natal, became its holy city. The leadership of the movement has become institutional in that Isaiah's son, Johannes Galilee Shembe (who was born July 27, 1904, received his B.A. degree at the University College of Fort Hare, and was a teacher), became his father's successor after his death in 1935. The elder Shembe maintained that, although he might die one day, his essence would continue to live in his progeny.' II Zulus have not formulated their creed, nor have they given us a specific systematized statement of faith. Even their mythology does not make our predicament easier; for example, the Zulu crea- tion myth leaves many questions unanswered with regard to the relationship between uNkulunkulu and uMvelingqangi. What they believe has to be detected from what is said, from songs and prayers, from ceremonies and sacrifices. What is true of the Zulu 1 For further information see G. C. Oosthuizen, The Theology of a South African Messiah (Leiden and Cologne: E. J. Brill, 1967). 2</page><page sequence="3">History of Religions religion in this respect is also true of Shembe's movement. The in- dependent movements in general have no real formulated creed or confession of faith. The religion of the Zulus, like all African religion, is expressed in ritual rather than in dogma, and some of the rituals are elaborate, for example, the events on Nhlangakazi, the holy mountain, or the reintroduction of the first-fruit cere- monies during Christmas. While both the Zulu religion and the Church of the Nazarites have no specific codified confession, the difference is that Shembe's movement has a founder and a book. Both believe in the harmony of the natural and the supernatural, that the tradition of the forefathers should be maintained, and that, if adhered to, it will spell success, whereas hunger, war, and ill fate will follow if tradition falls. The deification of some of the "dead" ancestors, especially those in authority, is in the old religion a grasping back to the source of everything, a way of maintaining contact with the supernatural world.2 The deification of Isaiah Shembe is not merely a reaction against the so-called pale white Christ of the white man-this is one of Sundkler's over- simplifications-but it is an effort to have through him powerful contact with a world the Zulus fear they may lose as a result of the disruption of their society. In him their hopes and aspirations are crystallized. A myth gives form to what is holy, and the mythical is considered to be the very basis of everything. The myth of the Black Christ is not merely born out of reaction but is considered to be a vital element, a working power, a living contact with the con- scious religions and social experience of the Zulu people, who feel the need of maintaining an intimate relationship with the super- natural world, which was such a real experience through the king before the white man came. "Primitive" cultures are not static but dynamic and continu- ously find ways and means to overcome specific situations. This is also the case in the Shembe movement, which produced its own stress-reduction techniques in a situation of social disruption. III Ancestor worship stands at the center of the Zulu tradition. The Zulus live in a symbiotic union with the unseen spirits and powers which to them are so real that their very existence depends upon 2 See L. L6vy-Bruhl, Die geistige Welt der Primitiven (Munich: Verlag F. Bruck- man, 1927), p. 1. 3</page><page sequence="4">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View them and their whole being is, as it were, penetrated by them. 3 Dammann emphasized this aspect when he stated that transcendent and immanent, object and subject, are not separated for so-calledpri- mitives.4 They are part of both nature and the supernatural, and to- gether they form a continuous whole. The land, the sky, the people, the ancestors, the streams and pools form one whole which should not be disturbed. For the Zulus of Isaiah Shembe's time especially, no barrier existed between this world and the next; the living and the dead constituted one community which was the very basis of uZulu (Zuluness), which lived under one heaven, iZulu, and whose god was epheZulu or ezulwini (in heaven). Although the outward resistance to Christianity may be weak, the Umwelt (environment) and the magical Weltbild (world view) are so strong that many theological obstacles prevail in the innermost being of many a Zulu when he becomes a Christian. Isaiah Shembe attempted to over- come this tension by making what is basic in the Zulu world view the determining factor in religious living. This explains why many of his followers come from the conservative Zululand and become members of the movement without extensive catechistic material to absorb. The emphasis on Zulu tradition, with the centrality of ancestor worship in Shembe's doctrine, is in itself a great attrac- tion. When Zulus confess their faith "in the holy congregation of the Nazarites, and the fellowship of the saints of Nazareth" (Isi- hlabelelo 731), they have in mind not only the living but also those who have passed away. Shembe's emphasis on the function of the shades or ancestors was due to his concern for the well-being of the Zulu nation, which always depended on the proper relation- ship with the shades. Shembe's nativism is revivalistic and magical, using elements of the old religion 5 and giving them new magical values in order to strengthen the sense of community. Lehmann 6 lacked scientific depth in his often naive analysis of the Shembe movement, while Schlosser7 did not see the real issues involved in her excellent description but somewhat super- ficial analysis of the movement. Although one has to be careful 3 See E. Dammann, Die Religionen Afrikas (Stuttgart: Kohlhammer, 1963). 4 H. Kraemer underestimated the strength of the so-called primitive religion and its propensity to syncretism. See his Religion and the Christian Faith (London: Lutterworth, 1958), pp. 405-6. 5 This process is also evident in West Africa. Cf. G.

Tylor consid- ered animism "a bare and meagre definition of religion."8 Spiritual beings control human events. In an era of term-coining, Marett 9 coined in 1899 the term "animatism" in order to give a more ade- quate, precise, and refined description of Tylor's animism. Animat- ism wishes to describe the impersonal spiritual power, the vital force that pervades all things. This was also termed dynamism. Animism and dynamism are two terms used in connection with African religion and could very definitely be applied to the Zulu religion in particular. Magic has to do with this impersonal power. Religion and magic, animism and dynamism are intimately associated in man's actions. Magic was called by Frazer a pseudoscience,10 while van der Leeuw stated that magic has to do with power in one's own hands, with a "wille zur Macht."ll Beth stated this truth as follows: "Der magische Mensch herrscht, der religiose Mensch dient."12 All practices of a dynamic nature have to do with magic in some form or other. With the Zulus there is an all pervading energy behind everything ;13 the ancestors themselves are carriers of this energy, but it can also be obtained through magical prac- tices. Those who obtain it have a share in this mysterious force which gives inner security and authority. This authority over the supernatural forces is the very basis of security. Magic gives special significance to holy objects, to holy-water relics, to the observance of ritual prohibitions; it is magic in man's hands by which he in- fluences the supernatural world. IV Thus one has to take into consideration very carefully the mana concept. It refers to a supernatural strength which can be used for good or evil. Everything that surpasses the ordinary power of in- dividuals or of the world is ascribed to mana. Through mana one can heal or make sick, regulate weather and give rain, or let people see the future.14 The gods and spirits of the primitive world are 8 E. B.

Since they are related to beliefs and practices associated with a supersensible, mysterious, pervad- ing energy, force, and potency, the New Testament texts which pertain to the power of the Holy Spirit receive special significance in the nativistic interpretation of Christianity. The effect of this power is what Tempels called "forceful living."16 What Jahn called Ntu and described as the cosmic universal power, which is being itself,17 is mediated to people through certain persons such as the king, chief, diviner, or any person in a position of authority, that is, who has uMoya and is in a special contact with the super- natural world. The prayers of the African to his ancestral spirits continuously ask: "Give me strength." This is echoed in the Izihlabelelo zama Nazaretha. It would thus be wrong to think of Zulu religion solely in terms of animism. Zulus do not believe only in spirits, nor are they mere animatists thinking of unco-ordinated energies. For them this im- personal force is found in iNkosi epheZulu, uNkulunkulu, uMve- lingqangi, or whatever name they prefer to use for the deity; in ancestors; even in animals, medicines, and things.18 It is the very essence of being; for example, it is not the leaves or roots that are of significance to the isangoma (diviner) but the essence enshrined in them. Only certain persons have the knowledge to convey this power; this is why only some within the independent movements have uMoya. Zulus have always believed that they themselves- their hair, nails, and so on-and all beings and things and actions have hidden inner power. When one wishes to understand the Shembe movement one has to take note of this magical world view.19 Whether the power comes from personal or impersonal forces, spirits, or gods, the important fact is that the carriers must have this vital force. Chiefs and diviners have such power, and Shembe I and II are revered and worshiped because of this power they 15 Th. P. van Baaren in Menschen wie wir (Giitersloh: Giitersloher Verlaghaus, 1964), p. 112, stated: "Gotter und Geister manifestieren sich, sie sind Urheber von Offenbarungen. Mana ist nicht Urheber, sondern Resultat von Offenbarung. Die Bemiihung eines Geistes oder Gottes geht aus dem Manacharakter dessen hervor worum er sich bemiiht hat." 16 p.

The bearer of this power can give benefits, protect, heal, and even hurt. Here he fulfils the role of both chief and diviner. Shembe's return to the ancestors has a double meaning: it is a return to them as potent forces in human life, but also, through them, the forces of nature which are the powers behind the seas, rivers, streams, pools, rocks, wells, and hills receive new signific- ance. Both the personality in Shembe and the power are wor- shiped. To understand Shembe's nativistic messianic movement further, one needs to discuss briefly the Zulus' concept of the divinity. Without entering the debate whether the Zulus' concept of God is that of a high God, it is necessary to state that their God plays practically no role in the cult. God is not really known-what they know about him is that he has a beginning and is all-powerful. He is thought of in anthropomorphic terms. For Zulus, God is some- how far away and yet near, and the only real link is vouchsafed through the ancestors and in an eternally active life-principle. The nearness and yet detachment of God is typical in many African religions. He is only now and then called upon and is rather a deus absconditus or deus otiosus. Between him and the people are all the forces referred to above. In any religion where God takes such a position other forces will take precedence, and this is what actually happens in the daily life of Zulus. It is thus not difficult to under- stand why God is in the background while Shembe himself takes precedence, maintaining that the Zulus were once told of a God "who cannot see, who has neither love nor pity. But Isaiah Shembe showed you a God who walks on feet and who heals with his hands, and who can be known by men, a God who loves and who has compassion."20 Isaiah Shembe brought the distant God into their midst. Shembe I was addressed by his followers preferably with the designation uMvelingqangi rather than uNkulunkulu or uThixo, the names used in the translations of the Zulu Bible. Furthermore, Shembe's popularity among the Zulus of Zululand, where uMve- lingqangi is mainly used, may be a reason why they describe him with this term. One is not clear who took precedence in the crea- tion story, uMvelingqangi or uNkulunkulu. The Zulu creation story is not interested in the prima causa of the universe, but, in- stead, as in all primitive religion, is concerned to establish the creation in the supernatural, in the numinous. From uHlanga came 20 B. G. M. Sundkler, Bantu Prophets in South Africa (London: Oxford Univer- sity Press, 1948), p. 278. 7</page><page sequence="8">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View uNkulunkulu, and from then onward starts his history.21 Asmus emphasized the fact that uNkulunkulu is not merely floating in heaven (osixinda se Zulu) but is the dynamic center of the Zulu collectivism over which it rules.22 This is an overstatement, but Asmus, it seems, wished to emphasize that uNkulunkulu is the final representative of all working energy. He has to do with all fertility, is the cause and basis of all existence, and in this sense is the center of the whole Zulu world, the uZulu in their totality. The mediators of this energy, vital force, or numinous power are mainly the ancestors with the result that they receive the atten- tion. uNkulunkulu has rights but also obligations; he is an all-powerful energy, the cause of all being and of the Zulu world of which the king is the embodiment and representative. But there is still uMvelingqangi, the name used for Shembe. This is a misty, obscure being who helps in times of great stress, makes himself known then, reigns over all being and action. He can be magically influenced and listens to a soul calling out in its need, especially when it doubts in the power of magical customs. uMvelingqangi is thus deeply concerned and could be approached directly.23 This explains why uMvelingqangi is preferred to uNkulunkulu as a designation for Shembe I. uNkulunkulu calls the whole Zulu hier- archical system to mind-he could not be approached by ordinary people. In spite of the fact that the image of God has changed, the mysterious relationship of the king to uNkulunkulu is continued even in the case of the Black Christ, Shembe, when they speak of uNkulunkulu ka Shembe (Shembe's God). The reason why Shembe I is called uMvelingqangi by his fol- lowers may probably be explained from the etymology of the word itself. Every religion has to do with myth, and the best solution for the enigma of mythology often lies in the etymological explanation ofthe names of god and of heroes.24 Just as uNkulunkulu has no cultic but only mythical significance in Zulu religion, so also has uMve- lingqangi. The word uMvelingqangi can be broken up into three component parts, each having special significance: (1) Umveli is derived from ukuvela, which means (a) "come forth, appear, come into view"; (b) "originate, come from"; (c) "gain distraction, 21 See H. Callaway, The Religious System of the Amazulu (London: Triibner &amp; Co., 1870); see also W.

Siecke, Max Millers mythologisches Testament (Berlin: Archiv fur Religionswissenschaft, 1902), p. 108. 8</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions favor, stand out, be prominent."25 (2) Ngqa, which is the nunnated form of qa and is used with qala mostly to express the superlative, means "at first sight, rare occurrence, beginning, commence- ment." (3) The third component is somewhat of a problem, and, though Wanger's suggestion in this connection is grammatically inconsistent, it needs mentioning, namely, that the expression Umvela-Kawala-wetu ("He Who Was before Us") led him to the conclusion that ngi is here actually the first-person singular and uMvelingqangi actually means "He Who Was before Me."26 This places uMvelingqangi as the very first about whom Zulus main- tain uMvelingqangi owenza izinto zonke ("uMvelingqangi created all things").27 The one from whom everyone comes and of whom none is the equal, is not uNkulunkulu but uMvelingqangi.28 Callaway stated that uHlanga, the source of everything in the creation story, was itself made by uMvelingqangi; he made the origin (uHlanga), and the origin produced uNkulunkulu and his wife.29 The designation uMvelingqangi for Shembe I is thus a definite grasping back to the original, the beginning before the break up of the tradition of the Zulus, a term still prominent in Zululand. uMvelingqangi is thus the prominent one, who appeared before anybody else-even before uNkulunkulu and uThixo, designations for God used by the missionaries. uMvelingqangi, who can be directly approached, is now in their midst. It is he who has more intimate contact with the ancestral world than anybody else. V Shembe has now usurped the position of God, who is still some- what distant in the sense of being difficult to approach. Because the Great-Great-One (uNkulunkulu) is thought of in anthropo- morphic terms, Shembe can easily take his place, be his repre- sentative.30 Shembe is more-he is himself the very first among the gods and messiahs preached by missionaries. 25 See C. M. Doke and B. W. Vilakazi, Zulu-English Dictionary (Johannesburg: Witwatersrand University Press, 1958). 26 W.

In order to get a clearer concept of the implications involved in Shembe's leadership, an analysis of both types of office is necessary. Starting with the first of these, one should state at the outset that the king or chief in Africa forms an important link with the supernatural world-in some parts of Africa he is even deified. Through the Zulu king the tribe contacts the royal ancestral spirits (amakhosi), which is also the name for the Zulu senate and is never used in the singular when referring to the ancestors or shades of chiefs. The king or chief never becomes a medium of any of the royal ancestors.31 Shembe himself is not the medium but is in intimate contact with the shades of the royal ancestors even though he is not of royal descent. The Zulus share in the rich king culture of Africa, and none of the African cultures is more rich in fixed forms, in ceremonies, in cult and symbolism than this type.32 Priests are not to be found in South Africa-the role is taken by the head of the family-and this gives to the king or chief even added prominence in the religious activities. He is the highest symbol in the Zulu society of what is powerful: he is the personification of law, the representative of the royal ancestors, and thus the center of ritual.33 He has both legis- lative and judicial power, but the decisions of the tribe in council carry important weight. Krige stated that "treason against the Chief is the same as treason against the whole people, for the Chief is the symbol of the unity of the tribe and as such is sacred."34 One could thus speak of sacral kingship in the Zulu society. The king rules over the life and death of his subjects but has to act and speak according to the injunctions from uNkulunkulu and the royal ancestors, not in a mechanical way but in the sense of re- ceiving advice. The king has thus a cosmic meaning. He is the only channel through which the amakhosi can be approached, and he officiates at national sacrificial ceremonies. When he dies it is never said of him that he is dead (ufile) but that he is brooding (uyandunguzela).35 He is not only the physical but also the magical 31 See A. Friedrich, Afrikanische Priestertum (Stuttgart: Strecker &amp; Schroder, 1939), p. 70: "Ich erinnere mich keines Falles, wo der konig selbst Medium eines seiner Ahne gewesen ware." This puts Shembe in the king type of leadership rather than in the diviner type. 32 Ibid., p. 7. 33 E. J.

Behind his office is the power and force of the ancestors, and as the earthly representative of divine powers he became in the Zulu society semidivine. He is more than an ordinary priest officiating at ceremonies. He represents the harmonious continuity between the cosmic powers. He has the destiny of the country in his hands, and this destiny is equated with his life. On him the tribe depends for rain, weather, and fertility and to him the first fruits of the earth are sacrificed. Not all who pass away eventually become ancestors but only those who were in authoritative positions on earth, for example, the head of each house.36 The chiefs always become such destiny ancestors. They determine the destiny of the tribe. Only those ancestors who had authority in the family or clan determine its destiny. The spirits of kings are ruling spirits in the supernatural world; they are treated as gods and receive in some parts the same honor. The chiefs have a special graveyard which is visited yearly. During droughts black beasts (black is the color of strength) called umzimu are sacrificed to the ancestors. These animals are driven to the graves of former chiefs whose spirits are called upon, and after this the beasts are slaughtered in the royal kraal. These places are holy, which means that they have a magical prestige- if not, they fall in the sphere of the profane and have no cultic value. The very name of the king or chief is holy, and for this reason Shaka, the non-Christian Zulu king, could become an apostolic father in an independent movement. The name of the king is revered through the Hlonipa custom by which certain names are avoided by certain people. He is called by such names as "father," "leopard," "noble elephant" (which are praise names also for Shembe), "thou who art as high as heaven," "the black one"37 (i.e., the strong beloved one). Sundkler's suggestion con- cerning the Black Christ, with the emphasis on the reaction against the so-called pale white Christ, is not the last word. Black beasts, black medicine, ashes used from the meat of a black bull, the king praised as "the black one," also show the importance attached to black as the Zulu symbolic color for strength. Grasping back to the beginning, the hereditary chiefs are called the amakhosi Ohlanga, that is, the chiefs of the reeds, the lords from the origin of things. Shembe I is uMvelingqangi but also the Black Christ, the first and 36 Callaway, op. cit., p. 144. 37 See A.

Although chiefs are not possessed by a spirit, they are always mouthpieces of the supernatural world. In many parts of Africa inspiration took place through this specific group of royal ancestors.38 Chiefs in the Zulu society pray at the graveyards of the dead chiefs, called Emakhosini.39 Since the time of Cetshwayo the Zulu kings and some chiefs have been buried with Christian rites, but there are still traditional Zulu customs kept. Syncretism of Christianity and the royal cult must have taken place at an early stage in this con- tact process and been witnessed by great numbers of the Zulu nation. It has already been indicated that the king represents all that is "might and power."40 He receives especially during the great Um- khosi (first-fruit festival) powerful or so-called black medicines for fortification. These medicines, dangerous to commoners, include parts of a black bull. This process of fortification is known as ukuqunga, which means "invigorate, strengthen, fortify by medi- cal charms, make callous, fearless."41 The army is also qungad when the king is fortified. At the Great Umkhosi the king purified himself in the river, in which ashes from his holy vessel had been thrown; and farther down the river the soldiers also washed in this sacred water, which had passed over the king. This is evidence that his whole person had a magical value to them. Many nativis- tic movements amongst the Zulus have now a "vessel of ashes" (isitsha somlotha) which is used by friends to cover the body of a neophyte when he has received supernatural contact and which is described as filled with the Holy Spirit. When the king is strengthened or fortified he remains in a par- ticular hut described as eya'emsizini, and this hut is used for this purpose every year. This special hut could only be entered by the king, his doctor, and his mother, and only during special occasions. Here the king goes into seclusion.42 All this reminds one of Shem- be's hut, which he entered on special occasions and which is now only entered by his son. The king, whose power was in part seen in his possessions as the wealthiest man in the tribe, did not use it just for himself but also for the benefit of the tribe. This is also the 38 See David Livingstone, Missionsreisen und Forschungen in Siid-Afrika, I (tVbersetzung Leipzig, 1838), 109. 39 Krige, op. cit., p. 175. 40 See Wanger, "The Zulu Notion of God," p. 680. 41 See Doke and Vilakazi, op. cit., s.v. qunga. 42 Krige, op. cit., p. 254. 12</page><page sequence="13">History of Religions case with Shembe I and II, who use their wealth for the benefit of their community.43 The king's regalia include sacred articles of the tribe and, like Isaiah Shembe's, they are kept in his sacred house. The king's re- galia are handed from father to son, for example, the ancestral assegai, axe, and hoe. These are believed to have contracted in them mana or supernatural power. Isaiah Shembe's house, holy vessels (the holy vessel of the king was the most sacred article of his regalia), holy drum, and secret scriptures are similarly kept.44 The sacred articles of the king are used during many ritual occa- sions, while those of Shembe are only taken during the January festival to Nhlangakazi. Just as the king's regalia find a place in the big hut of the royal kraal (indlukulu),45 so those of Shembe still find their abode in his house at Ekuphakameni. Even Shembe's staff has a prototype in the chief's sacred stick or induku yomuzi, which, together with the assegai, plays a role in the first-fruit cere- monies. Shembe's staff, which he lays on the heads of patients during his healing ceremonies, reminds one also of the so-called thumb diviners (izinyanga zesithupa) who use divining rods or izi- bulo.46 The memorial at Ekuphakameni is reminiscent of the ink'atha or sacred coil, a most significant holy article of the tribe symboliz- ing tribal unity. The circular form of the ink'atha is said to have "the power of collecting up all traitors and disaffected subjects and joining them together with the rest of the nation in affection for the King."47 This description may refer to Shembe, the hope and unifier of the nation, just as the key structure may refer to the Sabbath, which is described by Shembe I in Isihlabelelo 188 as the key to salvation. Shembe's position is thus deeply influenced by that of the king and the royal ancestors, to whom he often refers in the Izihla- belelo.48 As the one in intimate contact with the royal ancestors his authority is considered to be higher than even that of the present reigning royal family. He has in many ways usurped their position. 43 Albert Schweitzer once asked an African woman candidate for baptism about Jesus Christ, and she replied that he must have been a wealthy person since he was the son of God, who is the most powerful of chiefs.

Izihlabelelo is the plural of Isihlabelelo. 13</page><page sequence="14">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View VI The role of the diviner also had its influence on Shembe. The isan- goma (diviner) is the keystone in the Zulu religious system. The belief in reincarnation and in the eternally active life-principle finds its fullest expression in the isangoma. The diviners, mediums of supernatural powers, possessed only by the spirits of their own ancestors, form a loosely knit fraternity.49 They had in former times an important function in the social system, and belief in their omniscience was vivid.50 One cannot become a diviner by act of choice. The would-be diviner experiences a vivid self-revelation of the ancestral spirit which comes as an irresistible force.51 When somebody receives these experiences his or her health is affected, and physical suffer- ing is experienced in the shoulders. The training is mainly directed toward making the diviner free from imperfections (hlambulula), which means to become clear, clarify. Dreams and visions, as de- scribed above, are his experience, as was the case with Shembe, who, for example, was admonished in a dream to leave his four wives.52 It is not uncommon in African society to regard celibacy as a source of magical power. When a person thwasa's (becomes an isangoma), he (or she) often sleeps and dreams about ancestors who take him to a pool in the river, where he is painted with white earth, after which he returns, singing, to the cattle kraal, where he dances. The isangoma has no political power attached to his office. The diviner is a medicine man or woman whose medicine has magical rather than pharmaceutical value. Medicine, religion, and magic are here closely related, as is the case in the Zulu religion and even the Shembe movement. These consider medicine taboo, but holy water is used in its place, and magical value is attributed to it. Throughout Africa the medicine man or woman performs his prac- tices because he is subject to some spirit influence. The herbalist and the diviner may overlap. Zulus speak of izinyanga zamakambi, doctors of medicine, and zamakubalo nezinyamazane, doctors of plants and animal parts. The ancestors or spirits are the source of power to the diviners, 49 M.

They are the only people who regularly pray to the spirits and sing hymns to them.53 They make known to people the will of the spirits and interpret their messages. In the diviner numinous power is concentrated in a special way so that what the diviner does is "by means of a special concentration of power within him, which enables him to under- stand things which are beyond the conception of ordinary mortals. This power in the case of the diviner is derived from the ancestors themselves."54 The spirit of the diviner is considered stronger than that which a prophet has at his command.55 The diviner is in a sense also a prophet. Wanger refers to the diviner's office as a pro- phetical one56-here, however, the inspiring agency is the ama- dhlozi, amathongo, or amakhosi. He goes about in the flesh but may also go in the spirit while only his body remains at home.57 This is also firmly believed of Shembe. Nobody can do anything to the diviner because he is in the care of the spirits. The diviner roams among the spirits or on the hills, in the sea, or in the river, and when he is at home his relatives do not know whether it is only his body. The spiritual life of the tribe is the concern of the isangoma. The continuous threat against the community by invisible negative, destructive forces of life makes the function of the isangoma a necessity. The magical world is his or her "spiritual mother on earth." A main function of the isangoma is to heal the sick and in his contact with the spirits through dreams and trance situations, which is a religious medical contact, his supernatural power is strengthened. He counteracts evil forces, especially those that cause disease, and he fights his way through the magical world and its dangers and attacks it right at the center. The isangoma in the African society is thus in a sense a savior and messiah. Isaiah Shembe has also developed out of this type of seer, media- tor, healer, and prophet inspired by the spirit, while magic plays its role through the holy water, his staff, and the holy place itself. VII Isaiah Shembe introduced the first-fruit ceremony into his move- ment. He referred to it in Isl. 216: This ceremony originally was 53 A. T. Bryant, "The Zulu Cult of the Dead," Man, No. 95 (1917), p. 145. 54 Ibid., p. 43. 55 Sundkler, op. cit., p. 241. 56 Wanger, "The Zulu Notion of God," p. 576. 57 Kohler (ed.), op. cit., p. 22. 15</page><page sequence="16">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View divided into two events about a month apart, namely, the Little and Great Umkhosi. The ceremony has to do with the amakhosi.58 It is "the great festival of the ancestral spirits of the tribe,"59 the great national festival introducing the new time cycle for the Zulus. It could be described as the Zulu New Year festival. Christmas, the festival celebrating the birth of Jesus Christ, was substituted by Isaiah Shembe for that of the first fruits. On the occasion of the first fruit ceremonies the prestige of the king, as the representative of the tribe, was revealed in its greatest strength and power, greater than at any other ceremony. The paramount chief of the Zulus put an end to the feast, probably be- cause the ceremony included strangling a black bull and the in- spection of soldiers on parade; but Shembe restored it again in his own way, as these events are not allowed under European (white) rule. It is in its new form less obnoxious. The Little Umkhosi (Umkhosi omncane) takes place about Christmastime, while the Great Umkhosi (Umkhosi omkulu)60 takes place in January when the tribe brings the first fruits to the king as the representative of the ancestors. One aim of the cere- mony is protection against mystical powers. The ceremony also has a magical nature in the sense that the evil effects of the medi- cines, used to enhance the growth of the crops, have to be taken away or have to be "fortified against" (ukwelekeza). This danger is explained as a concentration of power in the crops that results from the ukusula medicines applied to them to make them fruit- ful. The Little Umkhosi is held mainly in order to protect the king from harm which might result from his possible contacts with those who partake of the first fruits without purification. This is not a full tribal gathering at this occasion-only great men of the na- tion, certain selected regiments, and young boys under the age of puberty take part. It is during this ceremony that the king is "fortified" on rising ground facing east, licks medicines off his fingers, and squirts it toward the sun to confuse his enemies; and it is also at the Little Umkhosi that the black bull is killed. During the Great Umkhosi the whole nation pours into the capital, as attendance is strictly compulsory. The people are 58 A. T. Bryant, A Zulu-English Dictionary (Pinetown, Natal: Mariannhill Mission Press, 1905), s.v.

Max Gluckman, "Social Aspects of First Fruit Ceremonies among the South-eastern Bantu," Africa, XI (1938), 25. Each kraal has its own small first-fruit ceremony called dologina. Cf. Bryant, Dictionary, s.v. dologina. 16</page><page sequence="17">History of Religions housed in a vast camp of grass huts, just as in the case of Shembe's gathering on Nhlangakazi, which now takes place during the same time as the Great Umkhosi in January. For two or three days before this ceremony the king is continuously treated with power- ful medicines in order to get occult ascendancy (ukutonya) over his enemies. Oxen are driven to the graves of the kings, their spirits are praised, and then they are sacrificed; this rite is called uku- buyisela kwamakosi (the return of the royal ancestors). Here the regiments stand at a distance and shout: "Woza-ke, woza-lapha" ("Come therefore, come thither"),61 which reminds one of the fol- lowers of Shembe who shout on the opposite hill at Nhlangakazi, "Come to us, all ye people, let the spirit send you to us." At the graves of the kings songs with meaningless words are sung.62 Dur- ing this ceremony the unkatha is doctored and rebound. It contains soil from footprints, vomit of the royal family, straw from the en- trances of huts, grass on which the army has slept.63 To this a circu- lar object which can be seen in the holy city most probably refers. The edicts announced at the Little Umkhosi are now proclaimed and others revoked. The well-known zi zi sounds, often heard in nativistic liturgy, come out in the spiriting ceremony when the chief chants: "Wo Vuma, Ndaba Hayi, zi zi."64 One is here interested in the atmosphere of the Umkhosi, and thus this brief discussion of the ritual which is far more compli- cated.65 The main concern is not the symbolism of the rites but its importance and the effects it produces on the Zulu life and thus on Shembe, who introduced it in his movement. Behind all the sacrifice of this ceremony lies the idea of making contact with the supernatural, having communion with it, and thus keeping the cosmic order. This is a sacrament with two roots, namely, eating with the gods or ancestors and eating together. Eating together means possessing together, which is in its deepest sense a demon- stration of inner unity. It is a feast of thanksgiving, but in it an anxiety for the new is revealed. This is why the king is heavily medicated before he approaches the food. The first fruits are sacri- ficed to God and the ancestors; they are eaten in connection with a ritual meal; the sacrifice and the meal together become a feast; the first fruits are given to the tribal head; it became under Shaka 61 See Lugg, op. cit., pp. 373-78. 62 Ibid., pp. 367-68. 63 Gluckman, op. cit., p. 28. 64 Lugg, op. cit., p. 373. 65 See H. Kiiiick, "Umkosi Wokwamazulu. Annual Festival of the Zulus," Folk- lore Journal (Cape Town, 1880), Vol. I, Part VI. 17</page><page sequence="18">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View much more of a military celebration, a war feast with the warriors becoming more prominent in the feast. He also raised the status of the ancestors. It is the occasion when both the dead and the living assemble together at the capital, in Shembe's case at Eku- phakameni. The king calls up the ancestors to the post, as "it would be an impious act for him to presume to celebrate without their presence."66 In Isl. 1484 Shembe states: Bamenyeziwe emathuneni They have been called out of the graves; Sebe phumile sibabonile They are already out, we have seen them, Bangenile emzini oyingcwele They have entered the city that is holy; Maka bongwe u Jehova May Jehova be praised. The graves of the royal ancestors are also visited by the Nazar- ites during festivals. This movement accepts survival of the dead but not Biblical resurrection. The ancestors are present; they actually preside over the festival as Shembe I still presides over Ekuphakameni even now after his death. The first-fruit ceremony is a demonstration not only of loyalty to the ancestors but also of thanksgiving (ukubonga) through sacrifices for what the Zulus have received. The Umkhosi depends upon a whole series of mysti- cal notions which are reflected in the Shembe movement, especially during the Nhlangakazi festival, which takes place at the holy mountain or Sinai, called Nhlangakazi. Belief in magical sub- stances, the mystical attributes of the crops, the power of the an- cestors, and the close dependence of the welfare of the country on the king67-all are reflected in the Shembe movement in spite of the fact that Shembe rejected medicine. The magical notion of nativism is intensely present, and the welfare of the Zulu nation is dependent upon the magical personality of Isaiah Shembe with its numinous power. There is nothing in his teaching or hymns to discourage this magical approach but much to encourage it. This is seen in many of his hymns, for example, Isl. 934, where he states: Siyakubonga chibi elihle We are praising the beautiful lake; Lokugeza izono zethu. It washes away our sins. This is repeated by Shembe II in Isl. 2272: Lowomfula uphi wona Where is that stream Enginga geza kuwo, Through which I can wash ? Kuzosuka isisila The dirt will leave; Ngibe muhle ngiphelele. I am then beautiful and complete. 66 Gluckman, op. cit., p. 33. 67 Ibid. 18</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions These verses should be seen in the context of Shembe's theology. The January feast is surrounded with great secrecy; in fact, no white man has witnessed this feast. It has the character of reveal- ing the Zulu mysterium tremendum. During 1916 Isaiah Shembe had a revelation that God wanted to speak to him on a mountain as He spoke to Moses on Sinai. For two weeks during January the Umkhosi wamadokodo ("Festival of the Tabernacles") takes place on Nhlangakazi. Prayers are offered, healing takes place, dancing and singing and sacrifices are made.68 The whole atmos- phere of the traditional Umkhosi was to emphasize solidarity and unity against external foes and internal forces of division, and this atmosphere prevails at Nhlangakazi, the holy mountain. At the first-fruit ceremonies of the Shembe movement the ancestors are present, whereas at Nhlangakazi the emphasis is on the direct relationship with the royal ancestors and the Supreme Being. The events on Nhlangakazi may also be associated with the rain sacri- fice, which Wanger calls "the one solitary relic of pre-pagan times, in the performance of which not a single mention of any idhlosi or amadhlozi was made, addressed as it was to Nkulunkulu, who, as inkosi epezulu, i.e. the Lord in heaven, had it in his power to give rain or withhold it."69 In the original Zulu religion Inkosasana yazezulwini, the heavenly princess, also called Unomkubulwana, was the rain queen in whose honor a special feast took place dur- ing October. She is not an ancestor spirit, but in her honor the Zulus used to hold dances on hills. This feast of the first fruits has to do with control, that is, con- trol of the food and the people. New laws are proclaimed at the feast, and discipline is inculcated with regard to the use of the crops. Inner social and religious relationships are strengthened. This explains the special role of the shades: taboos are observed which awaken patriotic sentiments, as this is the great feast of the nation when it assembles as a whole, and all pray to the same an- cestors, thus strengthening the bonds of kinship. Many of these ceremonies are aimed, at unifying and blessing the tribe. Further- more, with its aim of controlling social behavior, the first-fruit ceremony appealed to Shembe in a special way. The fruits, for 68 Sundkler, op. cit., p. 199. Some Zulus maintain that a human sacrifice is also made. This may not be the case, but it shows with how much mystery the feast is veiled. A. Vilakazi made no reference to such rumors, and he himself witnessed such a feast. See Vilakazi, "Isonto Lamanazaretha: The Church of the Nazarites" (unpublished M.A. thesis, Hartford Seminary Foundation, May, 1954). 69 Wanger, "The Zulu Notion of God" p. 564. Inkosi epezulu=the Lord of Heaven; idhlosi here refers to ancestor spirit (amadhlosi is the plural). 19</page><page sequence="20">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View example, are eaten in a certain order: "Younger people must wait on older, commoners on aristocrats, and all on the Chief, and the ancestors would invest those who come first with a new greatness in the eyes of their inferiors. In the ceremony is evidenced a prac- tical demonstration of the status of the ancestors, chief, army, and headman."70 The first-fruit ceremony that takes place at Ekupha- kameni breathes this atmosphere. The emphasis on rank is an in- tegrated aspect of Zulu society. Shembe tried to restore respect for the Zulu hierarchical system during a time when it faced serious difficulties as a result of social disruption. The emphasis on unity and blessing from the supernatural forces appealed to Shembe, and he considered the first-fruit ceremony a major factor in restor- ing the Zulu nation to its previous glory. Shembe wanted to acquire the sanction of the Zulu nation for his movement and for his own position. The roles and statuses must be legitimate in the society in which they occur; they must have moral and jural sanc- tion. This is not acquired simply by putting on a garment but is conferred upon a person by society, that is, society71 as including the authority of both the living and the dead. This begins with birth and goes on to puberty, marriage, parenthood, and finally death. Although those are physiological events, they are neverthe- less socially defined and are always marked by ritual and cere- mony. Shembe wished to receive the sanction of the Zulu nation to such an extent that he introduced the rite of circumcision, which Shaka has brought to an end. Membership in the lineage is based on right of birth only if a person is the legitimate child of his father. Shembe did not belong to the royal family, and as a result he had to get royal sanction, especially in Zululand, where allegi- ance to the chief and the Zulu kingship has heightened.72 In the case of the passage rites the "social" elements are more important than the magico-religious. The magico-religious element is strong in the first-fruit ceremonies because the social status of certain persons is emphasized with the concentration on their authority in the society sanctioned by the supernatural forces. The role of the person is outside him, and in order to accept his role the rites of passage emphasize ritual and ceremony in status-giving. 70 Gluckman, op. cit., pp. 36-37. 71 See M. Fortes, "Ritual and Office in Tribal Society," in M. Gluckman (ed.), Essays on the Ritual of Social Relations (Manchester: Manchester University Press, 1962), p. 54.

These ceremonies are repeated to give yearly assurance of loyalty and to demonstrate unity and receive blessing. Office par excel- lence is seen in kingship, which Shembe accepted for himself. A king or chief is invariably installed by a public ceremony, and he has to take care of the country. Shembe accepted this position, which meant that he had to supervise external affairs; but the most important obligation was the performance of rituals, for example, the right offerings to the ancestors. The prayers spoken at the first-fruit ceremonies are purely magical: the magic can only be mobilized with the support of the ancestors, who are present not because of their moral and domestic interest but chiefly be- cause of their jural interest. These ceremonies are repeated annual- ly in order to confirm the occupation of each office and remind one of his task. They are a ritually enforced check on the discharge of duties. The breaking up of the Zulu society, the limitation of the lands which were held in trust by each generation for posterity and for which account had to be given to the ancestors, as misuse would incur supernatural penalties, led Shembe to emphasize religious conceptions and ritual institutions of the kind that fulfil "critical integrative functions in primitive societies."73 These are the uni- fying factors of this society. Nhlangakazi, together with the first-fruit ceremonies at Eku- phakameni, is a grasping back to the Zulu religion and its ancestry. Here impepho flowers are burnt and the smoke inhaled, as was the case with the diviners when they wished to increase their divining powers. At the ukubuyisa ceremony, the putting into office of the ancestor, a small piece of meat is burnt with impepho (which gives a fragrant smell) as it is prepared for the shades and declared their food by the diviners.74 Through contact with the numinous power conveyed by the ancestors, the Nazarites or followers of Shembe have been strengthened. In this case the effects of the combination of Christian and basic traditional Zulu religious elements lead to quite formidable results. Not only did God and Shembe meet on the mountain, but Shembe and his followers also experienced the presence of the ancestral world. The term amakhosi (royal ances- tral spirits) used in his hymns is very suggestive, so that one could say this is also an effort to restore the Zulu kingship with which 73 Fortes, op. cit., p. 83. 74 See Kohler (ed.), op. cit., p. 34. 21</page><page sequence="22">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View Shembe now had special contacts. In Isl. 68 Jehova and the amakhosi are mentioned together: Jehova saved the Nazarites from their enemies (v. 2) and protected them "with the amakhosi who have power" (v. 3); and Shembe added: 6. Wabakhokhela entabeni yas' Enhlangakazi 7. Wachitha icebo Laba cebi babo 8. Waphendula ubuggili babo Baba ukukhosi. He led them at the mountain of Nhlangakazi. He scattered the device Of the schemers He changed their slavery; It became kingly authority. Shembe blamed the enemies of Jehova for destroying the eternal kingly authority (see Isl. 175) after having destroyed that of the Zulu nation. The restoration of this Zulu kingly authority is re- ceived on Nhlangakazi, as is undoubtedly stated in Isl. 174: Abe mukeliswa ubukhosi Phezu Kwentaba, Phaphamani phaphamani Nina ma Africa. Those who are given kingly authority on the mountain, Rise up, rise up, Ye Africans. This Mount Sinai of the Nazarites is not only related to Jehova but also to the sanctified royal ancestry of the Zulu nation. Here they drink from the fountain of Sendzangakhona (Isl. 2165) and from the rock of Mount Sinai (lulelotshe lasentabeni yase sinayi, Isl. 835). As a result of the mysterious happenings on Nhlangakazi, Shembe has indeed become the mediator of the Zulu nation. The July festival at Ekuphakameni is an effort to bring Zulus into the atmosphere of the lighter side of their religion. This festi- val witnesses preaching, testimonies, dancing according to age groups,75 singing, bathing in the river, mass baptism, and mar- riages culminating in holy communion. This is a time of filling up with numinous power (uMoya), and many are attracted to the feast in order to be near Shembe during these occasions. The numinous power is thought of as being bound to office and ritual. This is why one sings in Isl. 1034: Sithumele wedwa Nkosi Leso sichaka sakho, Sibuthele sigewalise Ngalowo moya wakho We send for Thee alone, Nkosi, That servant of yours That we may gather and we may fill up Through that uMoya of thee. 75 The isolation of sexes and generations in such circumstances is typical of sacral communities. This grouping constitutes the sacral congregation. Taboos are designed to prevent the real or imagined danger incident to the contact of the sexes which leads to the transmissibility of sexual character. Cf. H. Webster, Primitive Secret Societies (New York: Macmillan, 1908). 22</page><page sequence="23">History of Religions Johannes Galilee Shembe, referred to as Shembe II, described the feasts of Ekuphakameni as good uMoya. In Isl. 2403 it is sung: Amadili akho Thixo Thy feasts, Thixo, Angumoya omuhle They are good uMoya [i.e., numinous power] Through dancing and singing, contact is made with this super- natural power. The dance itself implies both thanksgiving and re- ceiving. This is why so-called primitive religion is "not so much thought out as danced out."76 Primitive man overcomes his limi- tations by way of ritual dances and magical actions which are also aimed at influencing the supernatural forces. Shembe I had special days set aside for dancing. Zulus are very fond not only of dancing but also of singing. Songs are composed by almost everybody. Almost every mother invents for her baby girl a lullaby called isihlabelelo, which is sung again when she menstruates and again when she marries.77 These songs give supernatural blessing and power. The general belief was that the king's song, sung at the Umkhosi, brings rain. Dingaan spent much time in arranging new dances and composing new songs. Each sib (isibongo) had its song (iHubo), which was directed to a spirit.78 In singing they become "strong," as in dancing. The songs are treated with very great respect by all members of the sib and are only sung at very special occasions.79 Puberty songs sung at the boys' ear-piercing ceremony are said to be meaningless,80 as are the songs sung at the graveyard of the kings. But these sup- posedly meaningless songs are full of meaning and are understood by the ancestors. Shembe's hymnal has many songs singing his praises just as the Zulu nation had many songs in which it praised the king. The hypnotic effect of dancing and singing is also evident in the Shembe movement. Even praying takes up much energy. According to Asmus the Zulu pray hard and loudly to the ancestors,81 and this boisterous praying is characteristic of many independent movements. Prayer is magical in that, by working oneself into a trance, one makes contact with the supernatural and thus influences it. This same idea prevails in preaching. Showing the spirit is a sign of effective and good preaching. It is not exposition of Scripture that is in the 76 See Marett, op. cit., p. xxxi. 77 Krige, op. cit., p. 238. 78 Ibid., p. 259. 79 Bryant, Dictionary, s.v. iHubo. 80 Krige, op. cit., p. 95. 81 Asmus, op. cit., p. 148. 23</page><page sequence="24">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View center, but singing, dancing, drumming, ecstatic prayers, confes- sion of sins, and healing. What is for the westerner symbolism is for the Zulu the divine dynamic itself. The king is the symbol of the tribe's strength, the author of all zestful living. Everything used in the Zulu religion has not merely symbolic value, as is ordinarily understood, but dynamic value. Ekuphakameni is the holy place; the profane has been elevated to the sacral, as is the case with the Zulu kraal (isi- baya), the temple of the traditional Zulu. The head of the kraal (umnumzana) is the dynamic center of the village of which the kraal head alone is the sacrificing priest. Every kraal with all its ordained units is a miniature example of the great organism of the Zulu world.82 The king is the dynamic center of the totality. The uZulu in their totality are part of the iZulu (heaven), making one proud to say singabakwa Zulu ("I am a Zulu"). Ekuphakameni is now the holy place, the new Jerusalem, the place of symbolic dis- placement out of a frustrating situation, which recaptured the old symbolism of the Zulu nation using Christian elements to revital- ize it. In this sense the old Zulu habits in dress are sacred and respected, while the symbolic colors of the Nazarite gowns are re- ceived through dreams and the dress itself is referred to as the dress of the spirit (izingubo zika Moya).83 The sacraments must be seen in the traditional Zulu religious context as purification rites based on the magical effects of water, which is used also as medicine. Water used for "holy" com- munion 84 is fetched from a secret spot by specific members of the movement assigned to this task. This reminds one of the fact that water used by the king and by the nearest of kin was obtained from a special spot which could not be used by anybody else. Special water such as seawater and water from big rivers had to be ob- tained in great secrecy, and this, together with certain ingredients from vegetables, was used as medicine. This water had "to be prayed for" in order to be effective. Water always played a great role in purification rites among the Zulu as, for example, in the case of the king's bathing in the river during the Great Umkhosi festival. The bread used in "holy" communion must be baked at Ekuphakameni. The elements are also given to the sick. The sacra- ment itself is held in Paradise (a certain spot at Ekuphakameni) during the night, which reminds one of the nocturnal meetings of 82 Ibid., p. 48. 83 Sundkler, op. cit., pp. 213-14. 84 "Holy" here means "magically loaded," not holy in the Christian sense. 24</page><page sequence="25">History of Religions the traditional Zulu cult. The only equivalent of the Christian holy communion in the Zulu religion is the first-fruits sacrament, and this may be the reason why it takes place only during the January and July festivals. Baptism has taken precedence in the Shembe movement over the "holy" communion not merely because Shembe hailed from a Baptist church but because of baptism's affinity with the old river purification cult. Baptism takes place preferably at Ekuphaka- meni, and as a purification rite it can be repeated on the same person continuously. It has lost its reference to the Jesus Christ of the Scriptures, and as a result of the Zulu notion of sin as defile- ment, sin is thought of as something which can be washed away. Ritual vomiting to expel the evil spirit is another way of getting rid of evil. In the old Zulu religion, the ubulawu medicine, made of certain bulbs, was used to make a person vomit in order to relieve him of the evil spirit. Ritual prohibitions are considered to be the negative side of numinous power or mana. Dammann states, "Das ganze Leben des Menschen ist von Meidungen erfiillt."85 There were a number of animals Zulus did not eat even before white men came. A cow which had a stillborn calf was not eaten by girls lest they experi- ence a miscarriage ;86 the king did not eat meat or drink milk (amasi) captured from foreign tribes.87 These things have symbolic value in the Zulu sense of the word. Ritual prohibitions are magic and have a dynamic character whose main function is to influence the supernatural world and to hold the community together. This strong magical approach with regard to ritual prohibition is clearly reflected in the Shembe movement, especially with regard to the Sabbath, the keeping of which leads to salvation (see Isl. 188). Simenyiwe thina sonke We have been invited all Simenywa yiNkosi yeSabatha, We have been invited by the iNkosi of the Sabbath Size sisindiswe That we may be saved Ngaleli Sabatha Through the Sabbath. To this he adds in Isl. 2122: iSabatha lingu Khiye The Sabbath is the key Avulwe amasango. The gates may be opened. Sundkler maintains that "the dream and the taboo are the two 85 Dammann, op. cit., p. 96. 86 Krige, op. cit., p. 57. 87 Ibid., p. 238. 25</page><page sequence="26">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View back doors through which the African past enters the church."88 Many nativistic elements take then a more prominent place. Lightning plays a significant role in certain Zulu nativistic move- ments. Shembe, who was himself burned by lightning, was always interested in it. The Zulus have special lightning magicians (abelusi bezulu), and the iNkosi epheZulu is especially connected with thunder and lightning and can strike those who angered him with lightning.89 The lightning magicians are not connected with spirits but with special medicines which contain "heaven" in a concentrated form.90 A person struck by lightning receives no death wail or mourning and does not become an ancestor spirit; his body is treated with special medicines, and those removing the body are fortified against its evil effects. The Zulu word iZulu can either mean sky, heaven, or lightning. Shembe had revelations through lightning, and prophets in the nativistic movements re- ceive their call through lightning. Lightning has been God's direct medium to execute his will, and for traditional Zulus, lightning is "heaven" in a concentrated form, while for Zulus who have been influenced by Christianity, if lightning is "thrown" at a person he is filled with the Holy Spirit. Lightning is God's direct power working without an intermediary, and so the Holy Spirit is thought of as God's power. Soil struck by lightning is loaded with power and used for medicine, while a beast struck by lightning can only be eaten by a prophet. Here again magic plays a significant role in the nativistically orientated movements. VIII The Zulu nation has thus been restored to its supernatural forces which are hierarchically ranked and should be properly ap- proached. Numinous power is obtained through the acts explained above. The Zulu world view is incomprehensible without dynamism or magic. The ritual prohibitions are emphasized because of their magical value; that is, through observing them the supernatural forces are influenced. Holy water has replaced the magic of medi- cine, and Lehmann's rejoicing in the assurance "dass der innere oder geistige Gehalt der Zeremonien das Entscheidende sei, und 88 Sundkler, op. cit., p. 216. 89 Krige, op. cit., p. 282. 90 E. M. Eiselen and I.

The African personality cult, where the chief "is the sum and substance of the whole commun- ity"92 and the headman the very self of the village, demands per- sonalities like that of Shembe in the acculturation process. The headman is the sacrificing priest and so also the leader of the nativistic movement. Twice yearly the forces of the Shembe move- ment gather at Ekuphakameni for renewal and refilling, which is reflected in the repetition of baptism itself as a purification rite. Shembe is much more successful than the churches in giving a sense of security and power to his adherents, a sense of possession in a world in which many feel spiritually dispossessed. Here religious ritual plays a significant role. Two factors are of signific- ance in analyzing religious ritual, namely, "the form of action and the content of ideas and aims."93 The desired effect, the aim of the ritual and its end result, is important. The need of those taking part is a vital concern. The atmosphere of the Shembe ritual is that of a specifically Zulu ritual influenced by Christian elements. Mostly Zulus constitute the membership of the movement, which gives them a sense of homogeneity and community. The religion of Shembe is conservative and non-revolutionary, with every promise fulfilled in the here and now, as was the case in the old religion. There is no waiting upon a future resurrection either, for the survival of those passed away and the influence of those be- coming ancestors make such a postponement unrealistic for Zulus. Here ritual succeeds because the people understand it and enjoy it but also revere it. Through the revitalized Zulu world, which Christianity has helped to reshape, what the supernatural world has to give is received. Even the language in its expressed and un- expressed form, a language of words but even more of acts, is clearly understood and interpreted from within the Zulu world view. Here is a religion in which magic and religion are not separ- ate and independent systems but actually reinforce one another at certain points. Not only are the old supernatural forces venerated in the Shem- be movement, but the whole culture with what it signifies. To- gether, they give nativism here a messianic form. The activities on Nhlangakazi, the holy mountain, contributed much to this 91 Lehmann, op. cit., p. 193. 92 J. Taylor, Primal Vision (London: Student Christian Movement Press, 1963), p. 135. 93 S. F. Nadel, Nupe Religion (London: Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul, 1954), p. 32. 27</page><page sequence="28">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View development. Definite elements of the Zulu religion are high- lighted, emphasized, and given symbolic value through contact with Christian religion. This is a revitalization movement of the nativistic type in which syncretism has taken place at the very grass roots. Shembe's reaction against the social and religious dis- ruption of the Zulu nation was given a cult form in order to give religious meaning to the defense of the Zulu culture as a whole. Indigenous elements are used in a magical way in order to recreate the total situation in which the ancestors lived, a symbolic dis- placement in which the past of the Zulu nation has a definite magi- cal influence on the present. This in itself is responsible for much of the social solidarity experienced within the movement. Certain aspects, such as the Zulu kingship, have been selected and elevated to symbols of the society's continued existence as a unique entity. Here is traditional symbolism explained in the light of accultur- ated symbolism. The important question is: How are these sym- bols used? They serve as a means of escape, of symbolic displacement from frustrating situations; and for this, symbolic forms are used in ritual and ceremony, song and drama, dance and sacrifice at special holy places. This symbolic displacement ties in with Christian eschatology to become a realized eschatology under- girded by a concept of time which concentrates on the here and now rather than on the there and then. Shembe started from an African Baptist church with a Christian religious movement emphasizing the Sabbath as a result of dreams he had. This "holy" day with its ritual prohibitions became the binding factor of the movement. Soon the old entered the move- ment as a result of its emphasis on religious experience and ritual prohibitions. Through Shembe a point of crystallization has been reached for the Zulu people, who were fast losing their unity and even identity in a pressing situation. Shembe I did not fully suc- ceed in restoring the old, but he exerted tremendous influence, especially on non-Christian Zulus. Shembe II also has great influ- ence on the Zulu nation. Shembe's movement is not a Sabbatarian Christian sect but is a definite nativistic messianic movement. This is due to the fact that the stable stage in the process of contact of the cultures concerned was short, after which the Zulu nation was violently shocked and the prestige it enjoyed among the tribes of South Africa was lost. A stable stage did insue, but soon rapid social change had its negative effects in the Zulu nation. The Zulus now blamed the con- tact culture for the disruption of what they considered a meaning- 28</page><page sequence="29">History of Religions ful way of life. They ascribed their plight to a neglect of the admonitions of their ancestors. In these circumstances Shembe appeared on the scene as a man of destiny, having himself under- gone "personality transformation dreams." He developed from a prophet into a messiah, as seen in one of his later hymns, Isl. 2141: Umkhululi wethu- Our Liberator- Thina ndzalo Ka Dingana We the progeny of Dingaan, SimZwile ufikile We have heard he has arrived. uMkhululi ufikile The Liberator has arrived; uMkhululi usefikile! The Liberator has now arrived! Wema zulu sesimzwile. Ye Zulus we have heard about him. Destiny dreams took hold of Shembe I, and he himself developed into a magical personality with numinous power, not only possess- ing supernatural contact but himself being supernatural. Here is an effort to control magically conditions that get out of hand. He has developed into a messiah. What he himself has brought forward is different from both Christianity and the Zulu religion. It is not merely a question of fusion or mixing but a process much more complicated in which the old is dynamically modified. To explain this process Malinowski told how in a delapidated African section in Johannesburg he once witnessed a divining performance carried out by a Zulu witch doctor, a Methodist prayer meeting, young men preparing for an initiation ceremony, an African "board and pebble game" played for European money, a bicycle from Japan, and dress objects from Indian, English, German, and American tailors.94 He remarks that to the superficial observer these activi- ties and objects will naturally fall into their respective European and African categories. Malinowski, however, rightly maintained that in this complex situation a new type of African has developed with a new outlook on the European and African culture. What was true in that case is true of the religious doctrine of the Church of the Nazarites. Not only has Shembe's personality undergone transformations, but so have his approaches to the Zulu and Christian religions. He has established in this process a new religion. We have selective conservatism in which everything is explained from the basic Zulu religious structure, which deter- mines what and how Christianity fits in. In the process the Zulu structure itself has changed. This is a dynamic process which will continue.95 The process continues in Shembe II, inheritor of the 94 B. Malinowski, The Dynamics of Culture Change (4th ed.; New Haven, Conn.: Yale University Press, 1949), p. 21. 95 See M. Fortes, "Culture Contact as a Dynamic Process," Africa, IX (1936), 26. 29</page><page sequence="30">Isaiah Shembe and the Zulu World View movement. He has already made some changes in his own hymns and omitted Isl. 220 in later editions of the Izihlabelelo zama Nazaretha. Of this hymn it is stated in the superscription (and Shembe II compiled the hymns) that it had been written by Shembe I after his resurrection in May, 1939, four years after his death in May, 1935. ("Emva Koku vuka kwakhe kwabafileyo" = "After his rising from the dead.") Basically the doctrine remains the same. If Jesus Christ of Scripture remains the center of a church or sect, it will not be able to develop into a nativistic mes- sianic movement. Nowhere have Shembe I and II in writing refuted the divinity ascribed to them. 30</page></plain_text>
