<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book reMarks A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature Ruth M. Stein Nina Bawden, English author of chil- dren's books, writes: "To a child a book is a revelation. It shows him his place in the world ... as if he looked into a gyp- sy's crystal ball." Besides connecting with one's immediate world, books connect to the more remote. As Paul Hazard stated in his classic, Books , Chil- dren, and Men, "'Give us books,' say the children, 'give us wings. You who are powerful and strong, help us to escape into the faraway. . . . We are willing to learn everything that we are taught at school but, please, let us keep our dreams.'" Reviewed below are some books which provide that look into the crystal ball and heed the quest for wings. A plus (+) signifies the superior ones, while a minus (-) designates the in- ferior. Happy New Year and happy reading! Picture Story Books + Audubon Cat by Mary Calhoun, ill. by Susan Bonners. Morrow, 1981. 32 pp. $7.95. Left alone for two days in her moun- tain home, Hilda, the self-styled hunt- ress, decides she's better at bird watch- ing than bird catching in a close-up look at nature and her creatures. The surpris- ingly suspenseful yarn is a fit compan- ion for Calhoun's wintry Cross-Country Cat . Bonners' golden autumnal illustra- tions provide setting for text. For the primary grades as a lure into natural goings-on. Braithwaite's Original Brass Band by Peter Stevenson. Warne, 1981. 32 pp. $8.95. In an effort to recapture their stolen musical notes in time for the musical championship, five members of the band find themselves on a planet inhab- ited by Sesame Street-type monsters who kidnap the best bands in the world. Rousing poster art enlivens an 52 Language Arts, Volume 59, Number Í, January 1982</page><page sequence="2">offbeat story, the author's first picture book both written and illustrated. A successful first effort. I'm Too Small. You're Too Big. by Judi Barrett, ill. by David Rose. Atheneum, 1981. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $9.95. A small book for a big price, albeit a very entertaining and well designed one. Type and muted cross-hatched drawings on wash contrast the disad- vantages of size for one small boy and his father, following the pattern of "I'm too small/to go to work" on one page, and "BUT YOU'RE TOO BIG/ТО GO TO KINDERGARTEN" on the facing page. The second-person monologue height- ens interest for nursery and kindergar- ten youngsters. Jumanji by Chris Van Allsburg. Houghton Mifflin, 1981. 32 pp. Rein- forced binding, $9.95. Left alone, two restless children find unexpected excitement in a mysterious jungle board game. The plot, neither original nor important, serves as a springboard to the black/white art, clearly derived from Van Allsburg's first book, The Garden of Abdul Gasazi. The il- lustrations bring the viewer into the scene by creating a sense of depth and space through attention to light and shade, shapes and sizes in composition and characterization. As the game itself limits the action, the book arouses more curiosity than tension. +The Marzipan Moon by Nancy Wil- lard, ill. by Marcia Sewell. Harcourt Brace Jovanovich, 1981. 48 pp. Rein- forced binding, $9.95. Almonds in a magic crock nightly produce a nourishing marzipan moon for a poor parish priest, until a visiting bishop decides the crock needs a finer home. Sewell's recognizable style in three-color drawings is a perfect match for Willard's wit in a down-to-earth morality tale with antecedents in folklore. +McGoogan Moves the Mighty Rock by Dick Gackenbach. Harper &amp; Row, 1981. 42 pp. $8.95. McGoogan, Master Guitar Player and Singer of Songs, befriends a rock with a hankering to see the sea. Told with the lilt of the Irish storyteller, the story is the tale of a journey of friendship. McGoogan's brogue contrasts with the formal-speaking stone. Two-color draw- ings strengthen the story's humor and action, even as the language signals changes. One of Gackenbach's best, especially the literal and figurative title. +The Missing Piece Meets the Big О by Shel Silverstein. Harper &amp; Row, 1981. 96 pp. $8.95. This fable of quest and fulfillment is the companion to Silverstein's The Miss- ing Piece . The deliberately paced story of the missing piece ". . . waiting for someone/to come along/and take it somewhere" is purposely slowed by almost-empty pages of space, with a continuous line leading the eye and interest. Assonance, alliteration, and rhythm raise the tale of taking charge of one's life to the poetic level, with design definitely affecting the story's timing. A quiet book for a quiet time. Onions, Onions by Tono Hormann, ill. by Diane Stanley. Crowell, 1981. 32 pp. $7.95. A houseful of onions is too much for Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 53</page><page sequence="3">the husband whose wife insists they keep away evil spirits. A chuckling litany of woes attributed to evil spirits and the repetition of onion food builds up dissension so that we shout along with the man, "'Onions, onions, enough with onions!'" When and how the wife comes to see the light charges interest in a yarn based on country-folk superstitions. The artist uses motifs and the strong colors of Pennsylvania Dutch art. This attractive book is Hormann's first published work as an author. Pa's Top Hat by Estelle Corney, ill. by Hilary Abrahams. Deutsch, 1981. 34 pp. $9.95. Pa leaves his top hat and little else besides the vegetable garden when he sets off to make his fortune. How a brother and sister use the hat to survive until Pa returns makes a cheerful story set in rural New Zealand ". . .in the good old days when steam engines roared up and down the land and across it." Full-sized watercolors reflect the rural setting throughout the seasons. Detailed interiors and exteriors, re- sourceful children and mother, and a story that avoids the banal should hold first and second graders. A first story by a New Zealand grandmother who seems to know her materials and her audience. Perfect the Pig by Susan Jeschke. Holt, Rinehart &amp; Winston, 1981. 40 pp. $9.95. Through a good deed, the runt of a litter gets his wish to have wings, which leads to an adventurous life with an art- ist who thinks the pig is almost perfect. It's an old tale with some new gim- micks, enhanced by black/white draw- ings. Perfect is one of Jeschke's more engaging creatures. In fact, I prefer her porcine creations to her humans. The Voyage of the Jolly Boat by Margret Rettich, English version by Olive Jones. Methuen, 1981. 32 pp. On October 21, 1686 a jolly boat with three children aboard was lost in a storm off the island of Nordernay. How by land, river, and sea the children brought the jolly boat back comprises this briny rite of passage, all of which happened in Holland long ago. Blue dominates the illustrations, done in the art of the period with some expres- sionistic touches added. The frontpiece follows the journey. Pictures rather than description impart the flavor of the times through costume, architecture, and background. For the middle grades. Realistic Fiction For the Middle Grades The Cybil War by Betsy Byars, ill. by Gail Owens. Viking, 1981. 126 pp. $8.95. Simon learns some hard lessons about good and bad friendships when his pal Tony involves him in some troublesome situations. Byers is excel- lent at depicting with humor universal situations such as a first crush, but the object of Simon's affection, Cybil, is just too good to be true. Not up to Byars' best. After a while Tony's using Simon becomes irritatingly tedious. +My Summer Brother by Ilse-Margret Vogel. Harper &amp; Row, 1981. 86 pp. $8.95. This is a more powerful, more subtle book about crushes, one in which nine-year-old Inge struggles to un- derstand the friendship between her mother and the twenty-year-old young man she herself is infatuated with. The first-person account of the first summer 54 Language Arts</page><page sequence="4">after the death of Inge's twin sister is hard to take. At first, neither the young man's nor the girl's action and words ring true. Slowly, slowly the nine-year- old perception comes through, building up and communicating the piercing ache of puppy love. The accurate depic- tion of mother-daughter rivalry is sel- dom encountered in stories for this age. The book is charged with emotion, wholly from the child's point of view. The imagery, especially of the Zobtn Mountains, parallels the evocation of feelings. You needn't have read the other books in the series to be moved by this. -The Secret Life of the Underwear Champ by Betty Miles, ill. by Dan Jones. Knopf, 1981. 117 pp. $1.95. A Borzoi paperback. One of the light Capers books, not as good as some in the series, better than others. Ten-year-old Larry is "discov- ered" on the street and asked to appear in a television commercial. Narrated in the first-person and in the past tense, the words ring true to the boy's cir- cumstances. Remember the kid who got on t.v. because of his cooking ability? This one makes it because of his red hair, then finds fame conflicting with his baseball aspirations. Both worlds are reconciled in a superficial story that can be read in one sitting. The characters are one-dimensional, unaided by the tired theme of the benchwarmer who saves the game. I suppose reluctant readers gain by being able to read this, but not much. Miles has her fans and they will read this. Turtle by Betty Sue Cummings, ill. by Susan Dodge. Atheneum, 1981. 42 pp. Reinforced binding, $8.95. An elderly Florida woman addresses a young boy informally about the loss of her pet turtle and of her growing affec- tion for the unlikely pet. Fourteen pages comprise the woman's tale, while twenty-one pages relate what happened to the turtle. While the animal is true to his kind in behavior, thoughts and emo- tions skirt anthropomorphism. The woman seems younger in the Japanese- influenced black/white drawings than depicted in the text. Illustrations extend the relationships, but do not always ac- company the text, especially in portray- ing the two perspectives. + Uncle Lemon's Spring by Jane Yolen, ill. by Glen Rounds. A Unicorn Book I Dutton, 1981. 64 pp. Reinforced bind- ing, $8.95. In a creative change-of-pace, Yolen comes forth with an inspired tall tale of how Uncle Lemon got his spring in the middle of the driest summer on record and the troublesome consequences it brought him in the person of mean Preacher. Droll characters with matching names are straight out of the West Vir- ginia hills - Merlie the Witchin' Man, Uncle Lemon himself, and his enterpris- ing niece Letty. Letty learns "witchin' isn't much more than common sense" through a series of hilarious incidents, properly larger-than-life. Yolen repro- duces the dialogue, as funny read aloud as silently. Irrepressible scratchy line drawings complement the humor of the text. Great fun! For the Upper Grades + Homecoming by Cynthia Voigt. Atheneum, 1981. 312 pp. $12.95. Abandoned by their mother, thir- teen-year-old Dicey and her two Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 55</page><page sequence="5">younger brothers and sister begin a search for home and family identity that takes them down the length of the Con- necticut coastline and to Maryland. The dangers and people encountered along Route #1 symbolize almost everything met in life, too much to expect in just thirteen short years. And this is possi- bly the book's major weak point, but not enough to detract from a first ado- lescent novel that is rich in character de- velopment, sensitive to atmosphere, and woven from many lives, the threads of which the author never loses sight. The jangling highways contrast with the smooth flow of ocean river, and bays - Dicey's metaphoric dream, at- tained through her practical wits and. the personalities of unforgettable sib- lings. A book for sharing. Lupita Manana by Patricia Beatty. Mor- row, 1981. 192 pp. $8.95. Everything that can happen does to thirteen-year-old Lupita, who, with her older brother, enter California as illegal aliens. Unlike Dicey, Lupita is passive, stoic in the face of adversity, hoping for a better tomorrow, hence her nickname. Whereas Voigťs novel and Beatty's pre- vious ones used historical and sociologi- cal events to highlight character and theme, here the incidents are the end in themselves, purposely dramatized to get the plight of illegal aliens across to the readers, at the sacrifice of story. Beatty's use of italicized Spanish expressions is illogical, as the characters ostensibly speak Spanish throughout. While this is no junior Grapes of Wrath , a good teacher might use the book to motivate and discuss a national problem that con- cerns us all. Plight , rather than people - oriented. -No Scarlet Ribbons by Susan Terris. Farrar, Straus, &amp; Giroux, 1981. 154 pp. $9.95. Having succeeded in her plan for her mother to marry her English teacher, eighth-grader Rachel Nolan now faces disappointment at being "left out." Her efforts to destroy the marriage nearly work before she realizes she has more to lose than she realized. Another book on remarriage that has nothing new to offer except a weird over-dramatized heroine with unreal expectations. The step- father comes off as realistic and sym- pathetic, but Rachel's carryings-on seem overblown, even for the world of melo- dramatic adolescent fiction. The book's conclusion is its most tender and believ- able moment. -hSave Queen of Sheba by Louise Moeri. Dutton, 1981. 128 pp. $9.25. After surviving a Sioux Indian raid on the trail to Oregon a brother and sis- ter set out with few provisions to find the rest of the wagon train. Twelve- year-old King David and the frail Queen of Sheba (named after biblical mon- archs) turn an improbable journey into a possible one through the author's inter- play of character and background infor- mation. Moeri's ability to begin and end her story precisely, to add where neces- sary, and to omit when called for, draws readers into the western locale via two heart-breaking protagonists. You'll re- member this pair long after you've for- gotten Lupita and her brother on their California quest. The Silent One by Joy Cowley, ill. by Hermann Greissle. Knopf, 1981. 136 pp. $8.95. 56 Language Arts</page><page sequence="6">Jonasi, a deaf-mute who tames a huge white turtle, becomes the target of the superstitious people of his small vil- lage because of his affliction and his pet. Set in the South Pacific and told from m each character's perspective, the haunt- ing story depicts the fear, hate, and desperation of its protagonists. Jonasi's foster mother, her son, the chiefs son, and the reptile whose "... eyes looked as though they'd seen a forever of yes- terdays" play out their epic-like roles against the sea and surf. An allegoric ending fits the story of alienation and acceptance of a silent youth by the silent sea. Wood engravings introduce the chapters, setting mood, time, and place. Fantasy For the Middle Grades +Arabel and Mortimer by Joan Aiken, ill. by Quentin Blake. Doubleday, 1981. 143 pp. $9.95. If you've read Arabel's Raven , you know what to expect - nonsensical events in plausible London surround- ings, sober people caught in impossible situations, and ordinary objects, like sewing machines and lawn mowers, tak- ing on a separate life under the raven's frenetic activity. In three more of Aiken's daffy tales Mortimer causes havoc on a cruise, brings zoo thieves to bay, and ends the archaeological excava- tions in Rainwater Crescent Garden. If you're in the mood, the dead-pan humor can keep you in stitches. Blake's drawings heighten the hilarity of the disaster-prone bird. Giant Kippernose and Other Stories by John Cunliffe, ill. by Fritz Wegner. Deutsch, 1981. Ill pp. $8.95. Youngsters fascinated with size - and who isn't? - will enjoy the sly humor of Cunliffe's nine giants, two of whom have appeared elsewhere. These British giants set the otherwise proper world awry. Their outlandish names in- dicate their nature, from the reluctant hero Giant Dumpling to the reformed thief, Garlick Rustytoes. Splendid draw- ings capitalize on the droll humor of these original tales. "Once there was a giant. Mr. Radagast Makes an Unexpected Journey by Sharon Nastick, ill. by Judy Glasser. Crowell, 1981. 85 pp. $8.95. Berkeley's theory of Immaterialism serves as a jumping-off place for Nas- tick's first book in which a seventh- grade class "thinks" its unpopular teacher into another world. Complica- tions cause two students to go after him in a good first literary effort that is bet- ter than most books for these grades. Danger of wish-fulfillment couched in a plot of the "what if" variety makes for a simply written story easily read in a short time. The original concept is actu- ally the trickiest part. Superfluous illus- trations. Quimble Wood by N. M. Bodecker, ill. by Branka Starr. A Margaret K. McEl- derry Book. Atheneum, 1981. 32 pp. Reinforced binding, $8.95. An unpaged five-chapter tale unfolds with four quimbles, each no bigger than a little finger, falling out of a car in a forest where they must fend for them- selves before winter sets in. Exquisite pencil drawings as much as the fragile story draw young readers into a minia- ture survival story scaled down to Bor- rower size. Fine details regarding in- volvement with the elements lend a cozy authenticity. Welcome Quilliam, Quil- Book reMarks: A Personal View of Current Juvenile Literature 57</page><page sequence="7">ice, Quint, and Quenelope to the realm of mythical creatures. Perhaps in addi- tional stories we'll learn more about these mysterious beings whose separate talents keep them going as they learn to work, play, and live together. Snip by Nathaniel Benchley, ill. by Irene Trivas. Doubleday, 1981. 65 pp. $8.95. The arrival of Snip, a mischievous young poodle, upsets the routine life of a tired old dog in a book that carries too many themes for its length. First, there is the growing affection between the two dogs, with Snip's teaching the old dog new tricks. Then there is the canine view of the ordinary world, with an anti-hunting message and the cruelties toward circus animals thrown in. Last comes the question of ageism, death, and dying. The transition from amuse- ment to poignancy is an uneasy one. Benchley writes well, and with some judicious pruning this could have been a good book. He just tries to tell too much. For the Upper Grades -Cat's Magic by Margaret Greaves. Harper &amp; Row, 1981. 183 pp. $8.95. Through a kitten's magic, orphaned Louise meets and rescues some unfortu- nate forebears from Victorian England. Time-travel gimmickry enables Louise to meet her ancestors, but everyone sounds too much alike to arouse inter- est. Casca the cat never realizes his po- tential. Not nearly as chilling as Greaves' other stories. The Deadly Hoax by Scott Corbett. A Unicorn book/Dutton, 1981. 86 pp. $9.25. If you can get past a deadly first chapter that lays the scientific basis for the plot, you might get involved in a novel that crosses science fiction with futuristic fantasy. When taken aboard the spaceship of creatures who an- nounce a plan to save Earth from itself, two seventeen-year-old boys question the intentions of strange beings who may be from outer space. Corbett's imaginative spin-off from a non-fiction book about computers is a bit too obvi- ous and awkward, weighed down by a deluge of information. The idea of com- puters as rescuers or destroyers is lost among the scientific concepts. An in- triguing theme that goes no place. The setting - an old house perched high on a mountain - provides whatever suspense there may be. The Green Futures of Tycho by William Sleator. Dutton, 1981. 133 pp. $10.25. An egg-shaped object enables eleven-year-old Tycho to travel back and forth in time, causing him to grapple with several futures he sees for himself and his family. The reader can figure out the problem of fourth dimensional manipulation and its consequences long before the repulsive protagonist. An il- logical "happy ending," too many paradoxes, and Tycho's many meander- ings bewilder and raise unanswered questions. Not as powerful nor as frightening as the more direct House of Stairs. The Singer in Stone by John Willett. Houghton Mifflin, 1981. 86 pp. $6.95. When Angelina of the Plain People encounters Rubythroat Singer, the last of the Dreamers awakened from his long sleep, she shares his effort to revive a sense of wonder in her people. A be- guiling futuristic fantasy, where con- crete objects and convergent behavior 58 Language Arts</page><page sequence="8">McGoogan Moves the Mighty Rock - photo courtesy of Harper &amp; Row The Missing Piece Meets the Big О - photo courtesy of Harper &amp; Row My Summer Brother - photo courtesy of Harper &amp; Row Uncle Lemon's Spring - photo courtesy of Dutton Save Queen of Sheba - photo courtesy of Dutton Arabel and Mortimer - photo courtesy of Doubleday are the accepted norms, pleads for the poet, artist, dancer, and spinner of tales - the creative person who adds color to life and makes it worth living. A "Glossary" adds a ring of authenticity to a time of astral traveling and to a way of life too frightening to contemplate. For readers of all ages to share. The Wolves of Aam by Jane Louise Curry. A Margaret K. McElderry Book. Argos/Atheneum, 1981. 192 pp. $9.95. Curry engages the reader im- mediately with an engrossing high fan- tasy of an ancient world peopled by men and giants, fabled and ordinary beasts, and the original Tiddi, a shy folk smaller and older than the human race. Great wolves with terrible riders roam, a con- jurer searches for a powerful "dream- stone," and there are even the prerequi- site maps and introductory poem. Imagine my dismay when I realized Curry couldn't possibly finish her tale in the pages left, and that another book would have to be read to conclude the story! At least the publisher should warn the reader at the beginning of the book. I am getting tired of fantasies which need two or three volumes to spin out their adventures. With libraries and other institutions suffering financial cuts, who can afford to order such luxuries, as well written as they may be?
