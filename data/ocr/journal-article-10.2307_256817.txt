SYMBOLIC PROCESSES IN THE IMPLEMENTATION OF TECHNOLOGICAL CHANGE: A SYMBOLIC INTERACTIONIST STUDY OF WORK COMPUTERIZATION PUSHKALA PRASAD University of Calgary This study examined the symbolic processes involved in the computer- ization of work in a health maintenance organization. Guided by sym- bolic interaction as a methodological framework, this inductive study used the methods of participant observation and in-depth interviewing for gathering data. It documents the multiple symbols associated with computerization in the organization and discusses local interpretations of those symbolic realities. It also explores the influence of this sym- bolism on the computerization process. Technological change as a recurring and pivotal process in organiza- tions has engaged the attention of organization scholars for a long time (Mohr, 1971; Susman, 1972; Woodward, 1965). Although early studies fo- cused on a variety of manufacturing and production technologies, comput- ers have begun to occupy center stage recently. As organizations move into the so-called information society and post-industrial age, information tech- nologies, with their immense capacities to change work and relationships, have begun to elicit considerable interest within organization scholarship. Studies of computerization and organizational change can take many forms. Bikson and Gutek (1983) for instance, surveyed the attitudes of em- ployees after the introduction of information technology, Carter (1984) ex- amined the impact of computerization on the structure of newspaper indus- tries, and Child and Loveridge (1983) related work computerization to alter- ations in labor market possibilities. Simultaneously, writers taking a sociotechnical approach have studied everyday aspects of computerization, especially concentrating on employee anxiety and resistance, and organiza- tional turmoil (Mumford &amp; Weir, 1979; Pava, 1983). Altogether, a substantial body of research now offers insights into how computers change organiza- tions and into the problems and issues associated with the implementation of computer technology. I would specially like to thank Jack Hewitt at the University of Massachusetts, Amherst, for first introducing me to symbolic interaction and for later inspiring me to take it up more seriously. This article would also never have been written without the constant encouragement of Anshu Prasad. 1400</page><page sequence="2">Yet some writers (Barry, 1989; Hennestad, 1987) remain dissatisfied with previous work, which they have characterized as incomplete and in- adequate. For the most part, they suggest that researchers have not ade- quately examined the process issues involved in implementing information technology and have neglected the symbolic dimensions of computerized work (Hennestad, 1987; Turkle, 1984). I attempted to fill some of these lacunae by looking at the symbolic processes contained in technological change. More specifically, this article reports a study of the computerization of administrative operations in a health maintenance organization (HMO) from a symbolic interactionist framework. Symbolic interaction, an underutilized methodology, has immense po- tential to augment scholarly understanding of organizations. Although I adopted the methodology for studying the implementation of technological change, symbolic interaction can be used to understand any organizational process, be it policy implementation, evaluation processes, or leadership changes. It is hoped that my demonstration of the application of this ap- proach will provide readers with insights into its use in other organizational situations. COMPUTERIZATION, SYMBOLISM, AND ORGANIZATIONS The organizational literature on work computerization has contributed substantially to the understanding of information technologies and organ- izational relationships (e.g., Child, 1987; DeBrabander &amp; Edstrom, 1977; Pava, 1986; Zeffane, 1989). However, there is still much that remains unex- plored. Barry (1989: 219) for instance, suggested that the literature on com- puterization has, for the most part, been dominated by a macro emphasis on organizational structure. Certainly, the works of Moynihan (1985), Carter (1984), Grinyer and Yasai-Ardekani (1980), and others have established con- nections between computerization and organizational centralization, and Pfeffer and Leblebicci (1977) and Zeffane (1989) have also explored the impact of computerization on levels of formalization in organizations. How- ever, this preoccupation with computerization and organizational structure may have led to a neglect of other areas, notably the impact of computers on power coalitions, managerial work, and organizational communication (Barry, 1989). Overall, Barry suggested that the processes whereby comput- erization is implemented and transforms organizations may be in need of greater attention. Others have suggested that what is missing is an appreciation of the symbolic and noninstrumental dimensions of computerized work. Yet the- oreticians have recognized that the symbolic aspects of computerized work are both important and relevant to organization studies. As early as 1965, Simon, discussing computers in organizations, described them as having captured people's imagination; he clearly recognized the noninstrumental and symbolic nature of computers at work when he commented, "They serve the imagination for all that is mysterious, potential and portentous" (1965: ix). Simon also urged managers and organization scholars to think of com- 1993 Prasad 1401</page><page sequence="3">Academy of Management Journal puters as Rorschach inkblots, holding multiple meanings for different peo- ple and reflecting their hopes, anxieties, dreams, and inadequacies. More recently, a theoretical recognition of the symbolic nature of com- puters and information technology has gained strength. Turkle (1984: 13) critiqued most studies of computerization for exclusively focusing on the "instrumental computer" while ignoring what she called the "subjective computer." Yet, she pointed out, the computer is an extraordinarily evoca- tive technology, holding different meanings for different people. Perhaps the most seminal piece of work in this genre is Feldman and March's (1981) article identifying the symbolic nature of information and information tech- nologies in organizations as providing "ritualistic assurances" of managerial competencies. Further, Hennestad (1987: 141) suggested that "computers and their systems also play a role as metaphor and source of ideas" in organizations, and Brissy (1990) described the "magical" symbolism of the computer in the workplace. Adopting a symbolic view of computerized work may accomplish sev- eral ends. Symbolic perspectives, which help researchers enter the cognitive worlds of organizational participants, help explain what computerization represents to people and how those representations can influence their in- teractions with the technology. Symbolic perspectives go beyond explaining computerization in solely rational and economic terms and help reveal the expressive world of organization members (Turner, 1986). In fact, Turner contended that the study of organizational symbolism "promises to provide a new view of how organizations really work, which managers should learn about in order to begin to manipulate their own cultural environment" (1986: 103). In a related vein, Hennestad reminded us that managers' igno- rance of the deeper structure of meanings and symbols behind work com- puterization is crucially linked to the "mismanagement of meaning" (1987: 144) during times of technological change. Despite this theoretical recognition of the significance of the symbolism of computerization, very few empirical studies have systematically docu- mented it or explored how it can influence organization-level action. Al- though studies of symbolism have grown to be quite pervasive in the organ- izational literature (e.g., Elmes &amp; Costello, 1992; Feldman, 1990; Gioia, 1986; Linstead, 1985; Mechling &amp; Wilson, 1988), technological change and work computerization in particular have rarely been studied from a symbolic per- spective. Such a perspective could, however, clearly offer considerable in- sights into the processes of computer implementation in organizations. Muetzelfeld's (1990) study of computerization in an Australian government agency, for instance, showed how a positive orientation toward computers resulted from linking the symbolic meaning of efficient production to the symbolic meaning of consumption. Symbolic aspects of computerized work can in fact be studied from a variety of methodological perspectives, including cognitive mapping (Bougon, 1983), semiotics (Sausurre, 1960), cultural anthropology (Geertz, 1973), and rhetorical analysis (Burke, 1955). This article, however, docu- 1402 December</page><page sequence="4">ments a field study of computerized work in the symbolic interactionist tradition. Symbolic interaction is particularly appropriate for the study of technological symbolism in organizations because it simultaneously empha- sizes both process issues and the roles of meaning and symbols. It also facilitates the generation of middle range theory, which offers insights into a number of related organizational situations. CENTRAL IDEAS IN SYMBOLIC INTERACTION Symbolic interaction belongs to a group of social constructionist socio- logical approaches employing predominantly qualitative methods and fre- quently characterized as interpretive methodologies or perspectives (Burrell &amp; Morgan, 1979). In its current form, symbolic interaction owes much to both German phenomenology (Husserl, 1970; Simmel, 1950) and the philosophy of American pragmatism, in particular the ideas of Mead (1934, 1977), Cooley (1918), and James (1890). Drawing upon these two strands of think- ing, Blumer (1969) developed a methodology for social research that he called symbolic interaction. Many of these ideas were also elaborated by Stryker (1968), Rock (1979), Hewitt (1988), Maines (1988), and others, who contributed to establishing symbolic interaction as a stable and influential school of thought in American sociology. Symbolic interaction is not exclusively concerned with the study of symbols. Rather, it is primarily concerned with the study of human meaning, which is seen as existing in symbolic realms, and related meaningful action. The theory rests on the belief that objects and events have no intrinsic meaning separate from the meanings people assign to them in the course of everyday social interaction. Indeed, this simultaneous emphasis on meaning and action is reflected in the term symbolic interaction. Symbolic interac- tion has also been described as a genre of research and thinking in the social sciences that emphasizes the creation of meaning in social situations, with the point of gravity the self, or personhood (Martindale, 1981).1 Symbolic interaction offers both a way of conceptualizing the social world and a meth- odology for conducting research. It has its own distinct ontological and epistemological assumptions and related methodological preferences. As a framework, it is well suited for the development of qualitative theory build- ing regarding the process of technological change in organizations. The earlier discussion on computerization in organizations suggested that there is a need to understand the symbolic processes involved. Sym- bolic interaction is a particularly appropriate way to gain such understand- ing because of its emphasis on the construction of meaning in social situa- tions. Not all qualitative methodologies are quite as concerned with indi- 1 Since the scope of this article prevents a detailed discussion of symbolic interaction, interested readers may want to look at Hewitt's (1988) Self and Society for a comprehensive yet succinct account of these ideas. Fine (1992) provides an interesting account of current devel- opments in the field. Prasad 1993 1403</page><page sequence="5">Academy of Management Journal vidual meanings as symbolic interaction. Ethnomethodology (Garfinkel, 1967) for instance, focuses on the accomplishment of everyday practices and the precariousness of reality, and semiotics (Saussure, 1960) is more con- cerned with uncovering broad and systematic patterns of meaning in society. Symbolic interaction, however, concerns itself with how events and situa- tions are interpreted through individual "sensemaking" processes. Accord- ing to this perspective, human beings possess images of themselves that are shaped by meaningful social interaction. These self-images influence how people assign meaning and how they eventually engage in meaningful ac- tion. Thus, in studying work computerization, how different organization members make sense of the technology in terms of their own self-images and visions of themselves in the situation would be of interest. In fact, one of the central concepts of symbolic interaction is the "definition of the situation" (Cooley, 1918; Hewitt, 1988), the process whereby people make sense of and articulate for themselves and others different situations, events, and con- texts. Accordingly, a symbolic interactionist study would examine how or- ganizational participants define a situation of work computerization on the basis of meanings of the technology, their own self-images, and the influence of other social forces on those images. Second, unlike many variants of cultural anthropology, such as func- tionalist ethnography (cf. Trice, 1985), which are concerned with under- standing shared meanings, symbolic interaction rests on an assumption that every organizational situation is likely to be filled with multiple and fre- quently conflicting interpretations and meanings. The perspective stresses the need to present a multifaceted picture of organizational life and encour- ages the use of more than one research method to capture complexity and problematical data. Thus, using symbolic interaction implies a willingness to use different "modes of knowing" (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967), including (but not restricted to) participant observation, document analysis, in-depth in- terviews, and life histories. Although the focus of symbolic interaction is on meaning, the emphasis is on local meanings, those held in multiple everyday contexts, such as particular areas, functions, and enclaves within an organization. Symbolic interactionists recognize that people may symbolically sustain certain no- tions, such as freedom, justice, and leadership, at a broad societal level, but that those notions contain very different images and meanings for people within particular institutional contexts. For instance, although computeriza- tion is seen as symbolizing chaos and turmoil (Mumford &amp; Weir, 1979; Pava, 1983), the images and meanings of chaos differ in different organizational contexts and need to be understood in terms of these differences. Symbolic interaction is also appropriate to the study of technological change because of its emphasis on the processes whereby individual mean- ings crystallize into collective, enduring, taken-for-granted realities. This focus on the "sedimentation of meanings" (Fine, 1992) implies that re- searchers need to understand how some symbols play a more powerful role in organizational sensemaking and are more enduring than others. When a 1404 December</page><page sequence="6">symbol is "sedimented," it has acquired a strong level of materiality and permanence within an organization. Finally, symbolic interactists have always been acutely conscious that the relationship between meaning and action is dialectical and dynamic. From their perspective, symbols are not static objects or artifacts but are constantly produced and reproduced through meaningful social interaction, which in turn they influence. This concept of "enactment," or the process whereby symbolism in organizations shapes and influences everyday organ- izational practices, is key to the symbolic interactionist position. In studying computerization, what would be of interest is how the symbolism of the technology influences the process of implementation and related areas of organization-level action. To sum up, symbolic interaction provides a methodological framework for understanding the symbolic processes involved in work computeriza- tion. It offers a perspective from which a researcher can look at multiple local meanings of technological change and proceed to understand how those meanings become crystallized and subsequently influence organiza- tion-level action. It must be pointed out that by virtue of its ontological and epistemological positions, symbolic interaction does not share the same aims as traditional positivist inquiry. Being explicitly concerned with phe- nomena within particular situations, such as individual organizations, pro- fessional groups, and social institutions, which are always unique, symbolic interaction does not aim to provide universalistic predictions and explana- tions about organizations and society. Rather, it aims to offer relevant theo- retical insights that might be useful in understanding similar and related organizational situations. RESEARCH QUESTIONS AND METHODS This article reports a field study of work computerization in an HMO in the eastern United States. I followed an entire process of computerization, from prior to the introduction of the technology in February 1989 through the adoption of computers 19 months later. Research Site The organization studied was a medium-sized HMO with 163 full-time employees that had recently been taken over by a large national health care organization, which I will call the Paragon Corporation. The HMO offered the usual services of a medical center, including preventive and prescriptive health care, referrals, a pharmacy, and health education. Its patients were mostly members of a prepaid group insured by Paragon Corporation, which delivered both health care and insurance services. The corporation made most of the key administrative and policy decisions, such as those concern- ing hiring physicians and computerizing operations, and the HMO's man- agers dealt with everyday administrative issues. The HMO had ten clinical departments (e.g., family practice, internal 1993 Prasad 1405</page><page sequence="7">Academy of Management Journal medicine) and four nonclinical departments (e.g., nutrition), and was ad- ministered by an HMO manager and several nurse supervisors. The employ- ees represented diverse occupations, including those of physician, nurse, physician assistant, nutritionist, radiologist, records clerk, and receptionist. Paragon announced the decision to computerize all administrative opera- tions in the HMO in November 1988. Most of the other Paragon HMOs had been computerized for a while, and the same system that was in use through- out the corporation was introduced into this HMO. The system was a com- prehensive one designed to computerize a variety of administrative func- tions, including the upkeep and retrieval of medical records, the regular maintenance and updating of a membership data base, the scheduling of medical appointments, and billing. Formerly all administrative operations in the HMO had been performed manually. Appointments were scheduled in log books, records were main- tained in large files in a records room, and so on. Thus, a switch to comput- erization meant substantial changes in daily work practices and in the for- mal and informal interactions of organization members. After the decision to computerize the HMO had been announced, Paragon began training a few nurses and nurse supervisors, who would then train remaining staff mem- bers to use the computer system. The entire implementation process was spearheaded by a project supervisor from Paragon who was responsible for both the training phase and the adoption of the new system. Official training sessions for the entire organization began in June 1989 and were conducted during the regular working hours of the HMO. Training was completed by the end of August 1989, at which point the organization embarked on its first practice runs with the system. The entire organization went officially on-line the following month: all scheduling, billing, record keeping, and record retrieval were now done via computer. Research Questions My research questions, developed after several weeks of preliminary observations at the HMO, were simultaneously a product of identifying gaps in the relevant literature, my own theoretical orientation, and my initial observations. To begin with, I fully intended to explore the symbolic aspects of computerization, and my first few weeks of observation were geared to- ward (1) ascertaining whether the symbolism of computerization was no- ticeable and (2) pinpointing aspects of that symbolism that might be fruitful to pursue in this organizational context. In many ways, the situation in the HMO was ideal for this purpose as it provided an opportunity for me to study the gradual emergence of symbol- ism. Since the technology was not a physical presence when I began obser- vations, I was able to pay attention exclusively to the symbolic construction of computerization in the organization. Computers were indeed a symbolic presence in the HMO long before they became a material presence, holding multiple meaningful realities for different organization members. Comput- erization acquired a symbolic reality through the expectations and visions of 1406 December</page><page sequence="8">different employees, which were frequently expressed in everyday conver- sation and action. Above all, to the employees of the HMO, computers were far more than technical objects. They represented many different things to different people either through association, resemblance, or tradition. Ac- cordingly, I designed the study to explore, document, and analyze the sym- bolic nature of computerized work in organizations. The research questions were as follows: (1) What are the multiple symbols associated with work computerization in the organization studied? (2) What are the local mean- ings of these symbolic representations? (3) What influences the process of sedimentation of symbols in the organization? and (4) How do these sym- bolic realities influence the process of computerization and related organ- ization-level action? In developing these research questions, I was primarily guided by cer- tain central tenets in symbolic interaction. I designed questions 1 and 2 to help explore the multiple nature of technological symbolism and the diverse local interpretations of this symbolism in this organization. Question 3 emerged out of the symbolic interactionist concern for the sedimentation of meaning, and question 4 was designed to help explain the connection be- tween symbolism and organization-level action. Research Methods Given the symbolic interactionist orientation of this study, the research methods used were qualitative, intended to capture the rich array of subjec- tive experiences of organization members during a process of technological change. The two methods used were observation and interviews. I began active observation in the first week of February 1989 and concluded it 19 months later. During this period, I regularly visited the HMO at least twice a week. Observation sessions varied in duration, occasionally lasting an entire day, but more often between two and five hours. I used what Denzin (1970) called the method of observer as participant, spending extended pe- riods of time during work and breaks observing work and interactions and trying to enter the subjective worlds of organization members. I spent hours watching receptionists, physician assistants, nurses, and records clerks at work and on several occasions even operated the appointment and billing system if a receptionist or clerk was particularly busy. Sometimes I accom- panied employees on their lunch breaks and occasionally went into town with them to run errands or to have a cup of coffee. I tried to structure my observation so that I was able to spend propor- tionate amounts of time in the HMO before the computerization of work, during the period of training and implementation, and after the computer- ization. The study was longitudinal in that I gathered data both before and after computerization. I observed everyday work practices in four clinical departments, the records room, and the referrals department both before and after computerization and attended training sessions, various formal and informal get-togethers, and a number of staff meetings held to discuss the Prasad 1993 1407</page><page sequence="9">Academy of Management Journal computerization process. After every session of fieldwork, I wrote up exten- sive notes documenting my observations. From the inception of my study, there was a full disclosure of my iden- tity and interest in computerization to all employees in the HMO. Although my observation was somewhat unobtrusive, my very presence undoubtedly made many participants more conscious of the computerization process. During the first few weeks of observation, a few employees repeatedly brought up the impending computerization of work, often asking me for my opinions about it. I tried to remain as noncommittal about it as possible, emphasizing that I was in the HMO mainly to understand the process of technological change and reiterating that I was not an expert on computer systems. I also tried to write most of my field notes off site. I found that if I took notes while observing, people were apt to become conscious of my presence and to ask me what I was finding out about them and their work. However, as I continued to visit, many employees grew so accustomed to my presence that they seemed to worry less and less about what I was doing. In some sense, I felt myself grow more invisible the longer I stayed. After the first few weeks of my observation, I found people becoming very forthright and com- menting on management, colleagues, and the computerization process with a tremendous degree of candor. The second major research procedure employed was in-depth inter- views. Symbolic interactionists are partial to the use of interviews as a par- allel mode of inquiry that helps clarify and modify their observations. I found that in some cases the interviews corroborated my own assessment of a situation and in others offered a different interpretation that forced me to rethink my analysis. Further, the privacy of the interviews gave many em- ployees a space in which they could reflect on and freely express their own reactions to computerized work in the HMO. Altogether I interviewed 34 employees of the HMO and Paragon Corpo- ration, representing a diverse array of occupations and organizational posi- tions. Table 1 provides details regarding the positions of the interviewees and the departments from which they were drawn. I did all the interviewing between February and April 1990, after the system had been in use for more than five months. The interviews were prearranged, and each interviewee was interviewed once. The interviews lasted anywhere from 45 minutes to one and a half hours and were semistandardized and semistructured: there was no one set of questions administered to all interviewees and no specific sequencing of the issues raised. However, the interviews definitely focused on understanding organization members' meaningful experiences with computerized work. The style of the interviews can best be described as meaning-centered-I tried to understand some of the diverse personal meanings posed by the experience of computerization in the organization. Spradley and McCurdy's (1972) idea of "grand tour" and "mini tour" questions informed the formulation of interview questions. The somewhat 1408 December</page><page sequence="10">TABLE 1 Locations of Interviewees Position Department Number HMO manager Three Paragon Corporation HMOs 3 Nurse supervisor Family practice, pediatrics, internal 4 medicine, obstetrics/gynecology Project supervisor Paragon Corporation 1 Physician Family practice, pediatrics, 5 obstetrics/gynecology, internal medicine Treatment and triage nurse Internal medicine, pediatrics, 8 obstetrics/gynecology, ophthalmology, family practice Receptionist Ophthalmology, family practice, internal 8 medicine, obstetrics/gynecology, pediatrics Records clerk Records division 2 Physician assistant Family practice, internal medicine 3 broad and exploratory grand tour questions gave the interviews focus and were developed keeping my research interests in mind. For the most part, grand tour questions got interviewees talking about aspects of computeriza- tion and related organizational issues. If an interviewee touched on some- thing that was closely connected with the symbolism of computers or seemed particularly concerned about certain aspects of computerization, I pursued those areas through the use of more specific and detailed mini tour questions. Thus, grand tour questions set the context within which specific mini tour questions were developed. Most of the interviews were tape- recorded and transcribed later. In a few instances in which an interviewee indicated discomfort with being recorded, I took notes during the interview and wrote up a summary of the interview after the session. These summaries were shown to the interviewees, who evaluated their accuracy. Data Analysis As in any qualitative study using a variety of methods, the sheer volume of data collected in this study was enormous. Over 1,800 pages of field notes from observations and nearly 800 pages of interview transcripts needed to be analyzed. To analyze the data, I used the techniques of grounded theory (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967), which provide guidelines for the classification of and commentary on qualitative data. Grounded theory offered some sim- ple and practical ways of keeping track of data, classifying it, and subse- quently analyzing it, primarily helping me organize my data through the creation and maintenance of "concept cards" (Glaser &amp; Strauss, 1967; Martin &amp; Turner, 1986). Keeping concept cards was a way of identifying core con- Prasad 1993 1409</page><page sequence="11">Academy of Management Journal cepts in the data. As I read and reread transcripts and field notes, I noticed that certain incidents, events, or pieces of conversation related to a partic- ular theme. I accumulated these common elements and put them together under a meaningful label on a concept card. Table 2 shows a sample card containing elements relating to the symbolism of computerization as turmoil or chaos. In keeping with Martin and Turner's (1986) suggestion, I tried to con- stitute the concept cards so that each related to one theme. If a card con- tained elements relating to diverse themes, it ceased to reflect a meaningful category, and it made more sense to break it up into a few new concept cards. Similarly, data elements could contain multiple themes and appear on more than one card. Maintaining the concept cards was an iterative process. Since I kept them from early in the research process, new elements were always TABLE 2 Sample Concept Card: The Symbolism of Organizational Turmoil and Work Computerization Data Source Field notes #2: p. 12 Field notes #7: p. 3 Interview #5: p. 6 Interview #8: p. 23 Field notes #33: p. 24 Interview #24: pp. 8-9 Organization Member HMO manager Project manager Triage nurse Receptionist Nurse supervisor HMO manager Incident, Quotation, Opinion, Event, and So Forth Comment on approaching computerization: "We are getting ready ... you see, for our collision course with computers."

"I finally know what army generals feel like ... that's exactly what it was like.

The concept cards not only helped make the analysis more or- derly, but also directly helped answer the first two research questions. The cards helped me classify the diverse meanings of the technology and there- fore helped me identify the multiple symbolic representations of computer- ization in the organization. They also helped identify the organization mem- bers who shaped and believed in those representations. Thus, the sample card in Table 2 helped identify the symbolism of turmoil associated with computerization and pinpointed the organizational actors to whom this symbolism was most meaningful. The cards also indicated the local mean- ings of each symbol. For instance, organizational turmoil had local meanings of emotional distress and chaos linked with images of battles, divorce, and moving day (see Table 2). I also scanned concept cards for relationships among elements on the same card and on different cards. This process yielded a new set of second- order cards that helped me make connections between certain symbolic representations of computerization and areas of organizational action. I was also able to generate another set of cards indicating the influences behind certain symbols and their role in sedimenting some symbolic realities in the HMO. Symbolic interactists urge researchers to explore all relationships theoretically and in a manner that goes "beyond common sense sociology" (Silverman, 1989: 229). And in discussing recent refinements in grounded theory, Corbin and Strauss (1990) recommended that once researchers have identified meaningful relationships in data, they should place those rela- tionships in the context of relevant literature to achieve a broad and insight- ful analysis. Certainly, in explaining many of the patterns in the data, I constantly referred to relevant bodies of research on organizations, techno- logical symbolism, computerization, and so on. Thus, the processes of re- porting the findings and conducting the analysis were highly related. RESEARCH FINDINGS AND ANALYSIS Multiple Symbols of Work Computerization The first research question was intended to uncover the multiple sym- bols of work computerization in the HMO. My intent was to document the different representations, or constructions, that computerization acquired and to pinpoint the organization members for whom they were most rele- vant. Symbolic constructions of computerization surfaced during my obser- vations and interviews and could be found in the everyday language and practices at the HMO. The daily conversation of employees, the organiza- tional literature on computerization (including fliers, newsletters, and memos), discussions during training sessions and staff meetings, employees' expressions of concerns about computers, actions and events like employ- ees' acquisition of computer-generated graphic art and passing out anticom- puter literature, and personal accounts of work computerization during in- terviews all contained many symbolic representations of computerization. 1993 Prasad 1411</page><page sequence="13">Academy of Management Journal These different symbolic representations of computerization were not equally shared among or believed in by all organization members. Nor were they equally influential in shaping the enactment of the computerization process. Additionally, some symbolic notions were more potent at particular moments of the computerization process, such as during training or imple- mentation. Others became sedimented as organizational reality very early in my study and remained as symbolic presences throughout the implementa- tion and adoption of the computer system. Space does not permit an in- depth discussion of these differences, but it is important to remember that there were considerable variations in the credibility, influence, and endur- ance of different symbolic realities. Altogether, I was able to document 12 different symbolic constructions of work computerization in the HMO. These could be further classified into three distinct categories: the pragmatic, the pessimistic, and the romantic. Each category comprised different symbolic elements but was characterized by a common mood or theme. For instance, the pragmatic symbolism in- cluded representations of computers as efficient, professional, inevitable, and linked to organizational survival. The theme underlying these symbolic representations was practical realism and instrumentality. Another cluster of symbolic representations linked computers with ro- botization, physical hazards, omnipotence, organizational turmoil, and oth- erness, or alienness. I categorized this group of representations as pessimis- tic because they cast computerization in a negative light and highlighted its disturbing aspects. Finally, a third cluster of symbols represented comput- erization in terms of anthropomorphism, utopianism, and fun and play. I refer to this group as romantic because optimism, idealism, and excitement characterized these symbols, which represented computers as lifelike and heroic and set up idealistic expectations of the technology. Table 3 summa- rizes the variation in the symbolic representations of computerization and indicates the organizational participants to whom they were relevant and the stages of computerization during which they were most noticeable. Local Meanings of Professionalism and Anthropomorphism The second research question was designed to uncover the local mean- ings of each symbolic representation. Not only did the computerization of work represent multiple symbolic realities; each one could also be inter- preted in different ways at the various local levels of the organization. To symbolic interactionists, a focus on local meanings is important. Thus, it is not at all sufficient to say that computerization symbolized professionalism. It is equally necessary to explore what the notion of professionalism meant to different organization members because it was in the context of those local interpretations that computerization was enacted. It is clearly impossible to discuss in detail the multiple local meanings of the different symbols of work computerization in a single article. Therefore, I focus on two symbolic realities, professionalism and anthropomorphism, in the remainder of the article. Both anthropomorphism and professionalism became crystallized as 1412 December</page><page sequence="14">TABLE 3 The Multiple Symbolism of Work Computerization Unifying Theme Relevant Phase of and Form Organization Members Computerization Pragmatism Efficiency Professionalism Organizational survival Inevitability Pessimism Omnipotence Hazards Organizational turmoil Robotization Otherness Administrators, physician assistants, clerks, receptionists Nurses, clerks, receptionists, administrators, physician assistants All Administrators, clerks, nurses Receptionists, clerks Receptionists, clerks Physicians, nurses, project supervisor, receptionists, administrators, clerks Receptionists, clerks Nurses, physicians, clerks, receptionists Precomputerization All phases Precomputerization and early implementation Precomputerization Precomputerization, training, and early implementation Precomputerization Implementation and adoption of computerization Romanticism Anthropomorphism Utopianism Fun and play All Project supervisor, administrators, nurses, receptionists Physician assistants, nurses, project supervisor, patients, administrators All phases Precomputerization, training, and early implementation All phases symbolic realities early in my study and remained that way until the com- pletion of the study. Thus, they provide valuable illustrations of the role of symbolic processes in technological change. Local meanings of professionalism. From my very first visits to the HMO, I noticed that a number of different employees were associating the computerization of work with professionalism. In my second visit, the HMO manager referred to the impending computerization with some relief when she said, "Thank God! A professional may be coming our way at last." The word "professional" was frequently used to describe computer technology 1993 Prasad 1413</page><page sequence="15">Academy of Management Journal in general and the nature of the computerization process. In fliers, staff meetings, announcements, and informal conversations, computerization was referred to as a professional technology that would eventually profes- sionalize the HMO. In an early staff meeting, the project supervisor respon- sible for the installation of the new system underscored its importance when he said, "We cannot give professional service without a professional tech- nology." Although the terms "professional" and "professionalism" were fre- quently associated with work computerization, this symbolism held three distinct sets of meanings for different organization members. First, the sym- bolism of professionalism was linked to the notion that computers helped in the provision of good medical care. On countless occasions, employees char- acterized computerization as professional because it would help their organ- ization offer superior or "real" health care. In many cases, this link was made partly on account of the so-called professional appearance bestowed on the HMO by the introduction of computers. A nurse, for instance, said2 "It looks so-well professional. When you walk in the door ... at least now it looks like a real medical center." In other instances as well, I found that computerization represented professionalism in part because it enhanced the appearance of the workplace by making it look more clinical. Nurses and physician assistants in partic- ular felt that prior to computerization the overall appearance of the HMO had been "messy" and "unorganized" because files, papers, and pencils were scattered all over reception desks. The former lack of computers was seen as contributing to the unprofessional style of the HMO, which was variously described as a "cozy little establishment" or an "obscure little organization." Employees saw computerization as transcending this cozi- ness and making the HMO a "real professional enterprise." Overall, a central theme in these interpretations of the symbolism of professionalism was the notion that real health care services could be provided by clean technologies like the computer. Second, the computerization of work also symbolized professionalism because of the technology's ability to "move the organization forward" and to transform employees into "modern medical workers." Nurses, adminis- trators, physician assistants, and receptionists evoked such notions of tech- nological advancement and progress. A flier describing the approaching computerization in the HMO also referred to it as a "future-oriented tech- nology for the professionals of tomorrow," and the HMO manager summa- rized her reactions in these words: "The way we do work is outdated . .. hmmm unprofessional. Computers can get us out of that into the twentieth century." Third, expertise was an aspect of the professional symbolism, especially to nurses and physician assistants, who equated computerization with pro- fessionalism because of its boundless capacity to provide instant informa- 2 The dashes in quotations indicate pauses by the subject being interviewed. December 1414</page><page sequence="16">tion about medical records and other concerns, thereby transforming them into experts. Computers were also frequently associated with expert systems and came to symbolize professionalism because these systems were seen as being used by specialists or experts like doctors. Table 4 provides samples of these different sets of local meanings of professionalism. Local meanings of anthropomorphism. Anthropomorphism was an- other symbolic reality engulfing the computerization of work in the HMO. A number of employees, some from every occupational group and department, tended to attribute human characteristics and behavior to the technology. Anthropomorphic symbolism was pervasive throughout the organization both before and after the computerization of work. The most noticeable element of the symbolism of anthropomorphism was the theme of cerebrality. Employees seemed to associate computers so closely with the human mind and with intelligence that the two were almost indivisible. It was also taken for granted that the technology was modeled on the principles of human intelligence and was designed to simulate the hu- man brain. To sum up, in the symbolism of anthropomorphism computer- ization was equated with superior brainpower and intelligence and helped construct realities of the "smart machine." Computers also represented an TABLE 4 Local Meanings of Professionalism Organization Meaning Member Quotations Real medicine Nurse supervisor After all we are in the business of health care....

Prasad 1993 1415</page><page sequence="17">Academy of Management Journal advancement over other technologies in use in the organization, such as cash registers and radiology equipment, which were seen as more mechanical than cerebral. In some sense, computerization also acquired a privileged status on account of its symbolic association with human intelligence. Table 5 presents some examples of local meanings of computers as symbolizing the human mind and intelligence. The symbolism of anthropomorphism also held meanings of humanness construed as fallibility, unpredictability, emotionality, and even warmth. As a nurse supervisor said, "At first it seemed too smart almost-and it is -really. But it goofs up too, you know like any of us-and makes poor judgments." In a number of instances (illustrated in Table 6), the computer system appeared to acquire different human characteristics, including way- wardness, companionability, and so on. Some receptionists even regarded their terminals with mild affection and were unwilling to let a particular terminal be replaced, and others spoke of them as having distinct personal- ities. Table 6 summarizes some of these symbolic constructions. The Sedimentation of Symbolism The third research question looked at the influences behind the process of sedimentation in the organization. Although computerized work symbol- ized many different things, some symbolic representations and their accom- panying meanings were more influential and long-lasting than others. These symbols became organizational realities by acquiring a degree of materiality and permanence. A recent focus of symbolic interaction (Busch, 1980; Fine, 1992) has been on this sedimentation of symbolism. Theorists have argued that attention should be directed to the forces behind sedimentation. Sociocultural forces. In part, the sedimentation of professionalism and anthropomorphism can be explained as having occurred through the influ- ence of cultural and social forces. As several writers have testified, notions TABLE 5 Anthropomorphism: Computers as the Human Mind Organization Member Quotations Physician assistant When you have so much information ... to process . . . you need a mind that's bigger than yours.

In general, professionalism symbolizes expert knowl- edge, detachment, prestige, and an adherence to occupational norms. In the HMO, too, people believed in these notions of professionalism and linked them to computerization because the technology embodied some of those qualities, notably expertise and prestige. Similarly, anthropomorphic notions of computers are common in the broader culture and can be found in several forms of public discourse, in- cluding science fiction, popular books, and magazines. Further, an outpour- ing of scholarly writing has defined computer technology as an "intelligent" and "higher" form of life (Jastrow, 1984; McCorduck, 1985). Undoubtedly, these broader cultural notions of computers as human have influenced or- ganizational symbolism as well. Local institutional forces and individual identity. Sociocultural imper- atives alone cannot sufficiently explain the strong sedimentation of these symbolic representations. After all, at a societal level computers symbolized a number of different phenomena, all of which were not present in the organization studied. To further explain this process of sedimentation, I needed to look at specific local institutional and individual circumstances. For instance, some of the sedimentation of professionalism can be under- stood only within the context of the HMO's history. Until its recent takeover by Paragon Corporation, its members had perceived the HMO as small, au- tonomous, and "cozy." By contrast, most of the HMO employees regarded Paragon as being an exemplary "professional" organization. There was also considerable anxiety that the HMO did not measure up to the parent com- pany's professional standards, and the absence of computerization was seen as simply another instance of the HMO's unprofessional style of functioning. Thus, the symbolic association of computerization with professionalism in 1993 Prasad 1417</page><page sequence="19">Academy of Management Journal part gained strength because it was seen as making the HMO a more profes- sional member of the Paragon group of companies. The appeal of professionalism can also be explained by the medical context of the organization and its impact on individual self-images. In the HMO, nurses and physician assistants prided themselves on their profes- sional status while simultaneously feeling that society largely did not regard them as professionals like the physicians. Nurses derived reassurance from working with the computers because in some sense it validated their pro- fessional identities. In the words of one nurse practitioner, "Working with them [computers] gives me a feeling of really being professional. See ... I am not a doctor ... a real one and so I almost need to have other things." Similarly, physician assistants implied that the aura of professionalism sur- rounding the computers meant that anyone working with them would gain professional standing. Seen from this perspective, it is not really surprising that the symbolism of professionalism became so strongly sedimented in the organization. Not only did it confirm many employees' sense of themselves as professionals, but it was also seen as helping secure a professional identity for nurses and physician assistants. Clerks and receptionists also linked computerization to professionalism on account of the new status it was seen as bestowing on them. One of the records clerks offered an interesting interpretation when she talked of how computers would make her work more professional be- cause they were "clean machines." She went on to say, "There is something about them that's so nice. Not ... well messy or dirty-not like the machines my dad works with ... that are greasy ... so yucky. With these you feel like a real white-collar person." Thus, to some people in the organization, com- puters had so much appeal because they were linked to individual desires to belong to a white-collar occupation or group. The sedimentation of anthropomorphism can also be understood by looking at issues of identity among employees in the HMO. For many em- ployees, the computer system induced confusion and bewilderment, since it was not easily understandable in simple mechanical terms. One way of making sense of the technology's inscrutability was to anthropomorphize it and to attribute its unknowable character to its "human intelligence." For example, a physician assistant who was disturbed by the computer's mys- terious ways resolved her anxiety through the following sensemaking, "It must be intelligent or something. At least-made on the same principle. Otherwise, how can you explain its behavior." Additionally, at one point the project supervisor deliberately promoted the symbolism of anthropomorphism, feeling it would help employees over- come their mistrust of computers. In a staff meeting held to discuss issues related to problems of adjustment with computers, the project supervisor stressed the importance of employees learning to "trust" the system. He also said that this could be achieved only if the employees themselves became convinced of the system's superior intelligence and capabilities. He sug- gested that supervisors actively propagate the notion of an "intelligent tech- 1418 December</page><page sequence="20">nology" throughout the organization. Although all the supervisors were not equally comfortable with this scheme, a few actually carried it out by em- phasizing during training sessions and routine work station checks how "clever" and "smart" the computers were. Table 7 summarizes some efforts by supervisors to actively build a symbolic reality of intelligence with regard to the new system. The Enactment of Symbolic Realities The fourth research question explored the influence of symbolic reali- ties on organization-level action. The symbolism of computerization was pervasive and also eventually shaped organization members' constructions of and interactions with computerized work. For symbolic interactionists, this process of enactment, whereby symbolic realities mediate meaningful action, is a central concern of any research project. By again focusing on the symbolism of professionalism and anthropomorphism, I describe the influ- ence of these symbolic representations on the eventual process of comput- erization in the organization. The creation of a favorable climate for computerization. The symbol- ism of professionalism had definite consequences for the organization's eventual encounter with computerized work. First of all, since so many organization members equated computerization with professionalism, the technology acquired a number of positive characteristics linked with the notion of professionalism. Thus, the technology was perceived as a desirable organizational acquisition because it promised to make the HMO itself more professional. Therefore, in some sense, the symbolism of professionalism helped create a favorable climate for the reception of computer technology and as a result, minimized resistance to change. The HMO manager recog- nized this minimization, attributing the smoothness of the transition in part to the employees' realization of the professional nature of computerization. Excluding serious opposition. The symbolism of professionalism was also instrumental in excluding serious opposition to the computerization of work. Since computerization was seen as professional and therefore both TABLE 7 Supervisory Efforts to Construct Anthropomorphic Realities Supervisor and Occurrence Quotations Project supervisor, during You need to learn respect for the computer ... this training session machine is probably smarter than you.

In interviews, many employees mentioned some of their problems in working with computers while reiterating that these problems were merely a "cost" or a "small price" to be paid for the professionalization of the workplace. Furthermore, the employees were unwilling to raise their con- cerns with supervisors and managers because they feared that they would be seen as "unprofessional" in not wholeheartedly endorsing the technology. Ensuring long-term commitment to computerization. The symbolism of professionalism also influenced the emergence of a long-term commitment to the computerization of work in the organization. By linking computers with professionalism, the symbolism also awarded considerable status to those who worked with them. This status in turn ensured their continued commitment to the system, even when it broke down or caused innumerable everyday working problems in the form of errors and delays. As one physi- cian assistant pointed out, "I'd never want to stop working with them [com- puters]. Just sitting before them makes people feel I'm something." Nurses also expressed a commitment to the technology because it permitted them to engage more actively in professional conversations with nurses outside their organization without having to feel behind the times. A much more em- phatic instance of commitment to computerization was demonstrated by a receptionist who refused to report certain technical problems with her ter- minal because she feared that her computer would be taken away from her, which would have robbed her of the new prestige she enjoyed in her family because she worked with a computer. Glamorizing effects of intelligence. The symbolism of anthropomor- phism also eased the implementation process by creating favorable mental images of computers. The intelligence imagery made them seem glamorous and desirable, and the human imagery made them seem less threatening and almost likeable. Moreover, the overall symbolism of the smart machine en- sured that organization members would have a certain level of trust in the system's ability to store, process, and retrieve important information intel- ligently. This trust made the changeover from the manual to the electronic system easier than the Paragon Corporation's management had anticipated. Unintended consequences of anthropomorphism. The symbolism of an- thropomorphism also had certain unintended consequences for the comput- erization process. For one thing, those who equated computers with super- intelligence were most disappointed when the system failed to live up to their expectations. These organization members felt let down, as this nurse practitioner described: "Well-you see I really thought they would be as smart-no-cleverer than me. . . . It's very disappointing now that I know they are like any other machine after all-only worse because we have to trust them to do these really smart things." Thus, once the symbolism of the intelligent computer was called into question, employees resorted to blam- ing the technology when things went awry. On a couple of instances during my observation, I noticed that carelessly entered data or failures to save 1420 December</page><page sequence="22">information were later attributed to the machinations of the "stupid ma- chine." The symbolic reality of humanness was so strong that some employ- ees were able to use it to attribute personal errors to the computer by blaming the "dumb machine" and suggesting that its mischievous personality could be responsible for problems. Further, when problems did occur regarding saving and retrieving data, supervisors were often confronted by angry re- ceptionists who wanted to know why such an intelligent technology made so many "stupid" mistakes. In sum, symbolic realities of professionalism and anthropomorphism contributed to a smoother transition while creating new domains of meaning that constantly required new efforts on the part of management. Understand- ing both these symbolic realities offers certain sharp insights into work com- puterization and also suggests certain possible future directions of inquiry. INSIGHTS AND IMPLICATIONS FOR ORGANIZATION THEORY AND PRACTICE This study looked at the symbolic processes of technological change using the methods of observation and interviews. The study's symbolic in- teractionist framework meant that I looked at multiple symbols of work computerization, local interpretations of them, the influences behind their sedimentation into symbolic reality, and their influence on organization- level action. Thus, more than anything else, symbolic interaction offered an overarching perspective and an accompanying set of relevant data-gathering techniques that helped me to understand the process of technological change. Its primary contribution, therefore, lay in the unique combination of perspective and method that laid certain guidelines for the conduct of the study and therefore helped reveal new aspects of technological change. Although the data-gathering techniques used here are not new, their conjunction with the perspective of symbolic interaction makes the current methodology innovative. To illustrate, ethnographic methods, including participant observation and interviews, can actually provide a range of find- ings that are related to a theoretical approach. It is not only the method of observation or interviews that directs the focus but the lens through which a researcher sees the situation that offers innovative directions. After all, earlier studies using participant observation have reached various insights whose character depends on the theoretical perspective-implicit or ex- plicit-of the researchers. Thus, observing the process of work computer- ization from a functionalist perspective (cf. Mann &amp; Williams, 1960) offers a completely different vision of the process than observation done from a Marxist-feminist perspective (cf. Murphree, 1984). Different aspects of com- puterization come to light in these two cases. In this study, the combination of the symbolic interactionist focus on meanings, local interpretations, and enactment and ethnographic methods revealed some hidden meanings of work computerization. Symbolic inter- actionist ideas have undoubtedly touched the work of several organization 1993 Prasad 1421</page><page sequence="23">Academy of Management Journal theorists who work in the areas of sensemaking, schemata, and identity theory. In this study, however, I systematically tried to use the ontological and epistemological positions of symbolic interaction and relevant research procedures to guide the study. Principally, symbolic interaction helped me focus on the symbolic and nontechnical aspects of a changeover to computerization. Feldman (1989) suggested that when researchers study and work with technological change, they tend to exaggerate or "idealize" the technological dimension at the expense of cultural, symbolic, and interpersonal dimension. However, a focus on the symbolic unearthed a number of insights for understanding computerization and suggested some future directions for organizational inquiry. Aside from providing thick descriptions of local organizational phe- nomena, symbolic interactionists seek to offer theoretical insights into orga- nizational situations similar to those specifically addressed through the de- velopment of middle range theories (Merton, 1968). Middle range theories are less broad in scope than grand theories and are couched at a lower level of abstraction. They are also directly developed from empirical findings (Turner, 1986). Middle range theories are less likely than grand theories to generate testable hypotheses or all-inclusive models. Rather, they are couched as guiding propositions-theoretical formulations from empirical findings that offer insights into certain selected organizational or societal phenomena (Merton, 1968). The propositions developed here are not universally appli- cable statements on work computerization. However, they do offer concep- tual insights regarding symbolic processes in technological change that emerged from detailed empirical research. They may not apply identically to all organizations but do offer several empirically supported perspectives for understanding the computerization of work in organizations. Primarily, this study suggests that computerization, or any technology, can simultaneously hold different meanings for individuals and groups in organizations. This study also showed that the strengths of different sym- bolic realities differed. Some realities-notably, professionalism--were more enduring by far than others, such as robotization. Table 3 offers details regarding the phases when different symbolic realities were present in the organization. Thus, Proposition 1: In organizations, technological symbolism is likely to take multiple forms that differ with respect to levels of intensity and endurance. For managers, this proposition not only opens up the nontechnical as- pects of technological change but also suggests that multiple symbolic real- ities holding different local meanings within an organization may accom- pany technological change. Managers are often more inclined to see only the technical aspects of technological change processes (Feldman, 1989) and fail to recognize the multiple symbolism associated with any technology. Al- December 1422</page><page sequence="24">though this study showed that computers represented diverse phenomena including professionalism, survival, and even play, symbolic realities are likely to be unique to each organization, even if they are characterized by common themes such as pragmatism, pessimism, and romanticism. Under- standing the nature of these broad symbolic realities may provide a way to understand resistance and adaptation to technological change in general. The study also showed how the symbolism of computers mediated the implementation and adoption of the technology. Proposition 2: Technological symbolism influences orga- nization-level action. I have discussed how the symbolism of professionalism and anthropomor- phism affected how computers were received and interacted with in this HMO. This proposition also carries implications for understanding manage- rial decisions regarding the introduction of new technologies in organiza- tions. Although this study focused on the symbolism surrounding comput- erization that emerged after the decision to computerize the HMO had been taken, it clearly indicates that technological symbolism might play a pow- erful role in decisions to adopt new systems. In their discussion of information as sign and symbol, Feldman and March (1981) suggested that frequently, information technologies are used and introduced primarily for their symbolic value. I have discussed some of those symbolic messages within an organization. Further, this research sug- gests that the pragmatic symbolism linking computerization to efficiency and organizational survival probably exerts considerable influence on man- agerial decisions to computerize administrative and manufacturing opera- tions. In other words, the use and adoption of certain technologies has im- mense symbolic value for management, value that may even outweigh pro- ductivity and performance concerns. There is therefore a need to understand the influence of symbolism not only in organizational situations undergoing technological change, but also in managerial decision making about the use and adoption of technologies. The study also found that, by and large, symbols with the themes of pragmatism and romantism influenced employees' expectations of comput- ers in a positive direction. I have not discussed the details of the symbols with negative connotations. These negative symbols were relatively short- lived (see Table 3), so they affected the computerization process less sharply than did the positive symbols. Proposition 3: Positive symbolism surrounding comput- ers or any other technology can smooth a technological changeover by convincing employees of the desirability of the technology mainly on the basis of symbolic asso- ciations. As discussed earlier, the symbolism of professionalism was influential in preparing organization members to see computerization favorably. In fact, 1993 Prasad 1423</page><page sequence="25">Academy of Management Journal this symbolism was so powerful that opposition to computerization became difficult on account of its association with lack of professionalism. This phenomenon has several implications for managers of technological change and scholars interested in this process. A substantial portion of the research on technological change concentrates on user involvement (DeBrabander &amp; Edstrom, 1977; Diebold Group, 1982), the role of change agents (Pava, 1983), and managerial understanding of affected stakeholders (Mumford &amp; Weir, 1979) as key to the orchestration of technological transitions. The managers of the HMO studied paid very little attention to these issues, but the entire process of computerization proceeded relatively smoothly, in part because the symbolism of professionalism and anthropomorphism created favorable images of computers and a sense of anticipation with regard to computer- ization. Both researchers and managers concerned with technological change need to recognize that smooth implementation processes may sub- stantially be the outcome of symbolic representations of technology at both the local organizational level and within the broader sociocultural sphere. The symbolic interactionist approach also calls for locating the sources of the symbolism of anthropomorphism and professionalism. Interestingly, as pointed out earlier, symbolic realities both emerged as a result of domi- nant cultural beliefs and ideas and were developed in the HMO by some managers. Proposition 4: Technological symbolism is a result of both managerial activity and sociocultural influences. Although managers can certainly promote symbolic constructions of a tech- nology, they do so within definite institutional fields of beliefs and ideolo- gies. Several managers in the HMO propagated an anthropomorphic view of computers, and the everyday world of the employees reinforced that view. The symbolism of professionalism was, however, much more influenced by the institutional culture of medicine, which endorses and values profession- alism. Proposition 5: Key institutional factors are likely to influ- ence the sedimentation of the symbolic realities of com- puterization and other technologies. This proposition implies that symbolic realities have different levels of potency in different institutional fields. Within the institutional field of medicine, for instance, the symbolism of professionalism was very powerful, and it therefore eventually exerted a strong influence on the computerization process itself. Future research might do well to identify institutional com- monalities across variants of technological symbolism. Such identification could provide additional explanations for isomorphism among industries (DiMaggio &amp; Powell, 1983) with regard to the adoption and implementation of technologies, whether they are computer systems, robotic technologies, or employee-scanning devices such as drug testing and electronic monitoring. This study also addressed the issue of "cultural persistence" (Zucker, 1424 December</page><page sequence="26">1977), the phenomenon whereby beliefs, values, perceptions, and so forth become objectified as virtual truths in an organization. Zucker used the insights of ethnomethodology to understand cultural persistence, but sym- bolic interaction, with its focus on the sedimentation of symbolic reality, offers additional insights into the process. Mainly, it shows that cultural persistence can occur because certain symbolic messages from a sociocul- tural or an institutional environment have an immediate and personal rele- vance to organization members because of connections to their own identi- ties and self-images. Thus, professionalism, which is strongly institutional- ized in the broader culture, was especially meaningful to the employees of the HMO because it reinforced their self-images as professional, white-collar workers. Proposition 6: Forms of technological symbolism likely to be culturally persistent are those that reinforce organiza- tion members' own sense of identity and self-worth. Finally, the study also showed that a particular form of symbolism, such as anthropomorphism, can have both intended and unintended conse- quences for organizational computerization. Managers quickly recognized the benefits of anthropomorphizing computers but were less quick to realize its dysfunctional possibilities. In a sense, their own management of anthro- pomorphic messages may have contributed to some later problems. Proposition 7: The management of meanings around tech- nological change can have both intended and unintended consequences for the process. Anthropomorphism certainly glamorized the technology by depicting the computers as "superintelligent" and "brainy." But employees came to have extremely high expectations about computerized work. The system introduced into the HMO, which was designed to perform only relatively simple tasks, suffered from a number of minor working problems. It fre- quently failed to live up to the hopes invoked by the anthropomorphic imagery, thereby precipitating a strong sense of letdown among many HMO employees. Clearly, this situation illustrates Hennestad's (1987) warnings regarding the mismanagement of meaning during transitions to computer- ized work. Managers are often urged to present computerization and tech- nological change in a favorable light, but the dysfunctional consequences accompanying some symbolic representations are frequently neglected. The lesson here also relates to Stevenson's (1990) discussion of the dangers of "computer-hype," the attachment of overly positive meanings to computers with little thought to their subsequent interpretation. The management of the symbolic realities of work computerization can have other consequences as well. When Simon (1965) urged managers to understand people's tendencies to project themselves onto computer tech- nologies, he was clearly aware of potential consequences in the everyday world of organizations. I also found that the powerful symbolism of intelli- gence encouraged the belief that the system could solve problems better than 1993 Prasad 1425</page><page sequence="27">Academy of Management Journal people could. Although this belief might predispose employees to work with computers, it also has implications regarding their willingness to allow the technology to take over a number of simple functions. This tendency was discussed in a different context by Pauchant and Mitroff (1992), who em- phasized the dangers inherent in overreliance on sophisticated technologies and the accompanying underutilization of human judgment and concentra- tion. Managers need to be aware of the possibility of encouraging overreli- ance on the technology when they intentionally or otherwise emphasize a computer's intelligence. This study's major contribution is its empirical demonstration of how personal and cultural constructions of computerization mediate organiza- tion members eventual relationships with information technology. Previous work has both tacitly and explicitly acknowledged this connection (e.g., Feldman &amp; March, 1981; Hennestad, 1987); this study illustrates how this connection between symbolism and organizational practice actually arises. In doing so, the study makes the domain of organizational symbolism less exotic and distant and brings it closer to the everyday reality of work in organizations. For organization researchers, the methodology has potential for use in a variety of situations. The implementation of technological change is not the only area of organizational activity that can benefit from the insights of symbolic interaction. Understanding of the phenomena of leadership tran- sitions, mergers and acquisitions, new policy implementations, and organ- izational collaborations, to name a few, might benefit from a symbolic in- teractionist inquiry. All those situations contain multiple local meanings, some of which are strongly sedimented and often influence organization- level action. The broad guidelines this study suggests may help researchers gain a more process-oriented view of phenomena that have traditionally been looked at from a macro perspective.
