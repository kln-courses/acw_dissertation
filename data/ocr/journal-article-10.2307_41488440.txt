The notion of the 'division of physiological labour' is today an outdated relic in the history of science. This contrasts with the fate of another notion, which was so frequently paired with the division of physiological labour, which is the concept of 'morphological differentiation.' This is one of the elementary modal concepts of ontogenesis. In this paper, we intend to target the problems and causes that gradually led biologists to combine these two notions during the 19th century, and to progressively dissociate them, retaining only the concept of differentiation by the early 20th century. We shall adhere to the following: 1 . The primitive economic concept of the division of labour is not a descriptive notion denoting a type of organisation of labour, but an etiological one: the idea of a causal relationship between this type of organization and the improvement of the whole. 2. This concept rapidly interested naturalists such as Henri Milne-Edwards, who were keen to find a rational ground for hierarchizing living forms based on anatomical complexity. 3. The validation of this notion in the realms of biology was subject to at least two conditions which were far from being fully satisfied. This did not prevent, however, the initial success of the concept of the division of physiological labour during the second half of the 19th century. 4. Finally, the gradual disqualification, within the Darwinian theoretical context, of the conception of an intrinsic hierarchical rank of organisms, led to a lack of interest in the concept of the physiological division of labour, at least in its non-Darwinian and non-ecological variant (the link between the division of labour within an organism and organic perfection).

It has been some time since this term vanished from the indexes of biology textbooks, as well as the idea that it was supposed to express (which we clarify later) and has been relegated to the realms of forgotten history.1 This is more unfortunate that it may initially seem, as it con- trasts with the destiny of another notional term, with which the 'division of physiological labour' was for so long associated: the concept of morphological differentiation. Open any recent textbook of developmental biology, and it will be impossible to miss the central role that the concept of differentiation plays in understanding embryogenesis. 'Differentiation' is, even today, the chosen word used to qualify that which appears as the principal characteristic modality of ontogenesis: Development accomplishes two major functions. It generates cel- lular diversity and order within each generation, and it ensures the continuity of life from one generation to the next. The first function involves the production and organization of all the diverse types of cells in the body. [...] This generation of cellular diversity is called 'differentiation'; the processes that organize the different cells into tissues and organs are called 'morphogenesis' (creation of form and structure) and 'growth' (increase in size). (Gilbert, 1994, p. 4) It is also true in developmental microbiology: It is useful to separate development events into several individual components: growth, differentiation, and morphogenesis. The term 'growth' is used to define the gain of volume and/or mass of an 1 There are some exceptions. But when the term is used, it is only within a framework of a description (of organic development, or of social organization of animal societies), and never to justify a normative point of view on organisms. One finds some occur- rences of a maximalist extension of the concept in contemporary literature, but its comprehension remains, even in this case, purely descriptive. For example, Graham Bell sustains that "the cooperative division of labor among replicated entities is a broad principle of organic construction that applies at all levels of organization" (Bell, 2001, p. 245). It is therefore obvious that the "division of labor" is not always used as a simple metaphor in biology; but, at the very least, the expression no longer implies the idea of a causal link between the phenomenon that embryologists today call determination, and the improvement of organization, which is the key idea of the former concept of division of physiological labour, as we will see.</page><page sequence="3">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 5 organism due to cell enlargement and cell multiplication. 'Differenti- ation' describes alterations of the form and function of cells, resulting in the formation of new structures or changes in tissue and organs [. . .] The changing shape of the organism which is linked to changes in function, is called 'morphogenesis.' (Westhoff, 1998, pp. 14-15) Throughout these passages from reference works dealing with differentia- tion, we find nothing whatsoever which resembles the 'division of labour.' In this paper, we attempt to explain the reasons that led to the biological use of these two notions in biology during the 19th century. We then study the development of the theoretical context and the considerable difficulties involved in the enforcement of the concept of the division of labour in life sciences, which finally led to the separation of these two concepts by the early 20th century, leaving biology only with the concept of differentiation. The Division of Physiological Labour: Justifying the Hierarchical Place of Organisms in the Chain of Beings Division of Labour and the Improvement of the Whole Organization The pages on division of labour in Adam Smith's book: An Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations (1776) are extremely well known. The case studied by Smith of the pin factory (Smith, 1778, Book 1, chap. 1), which requires at least 21 separate basic operations, con- stitutes a notably striking case and a classic illustration of the division of labour. It is used in practically all the textbooks of political economics in the 19th century. These considerations would hardly have been so influential if they were simply of pedagogical value. The interest of Smith's analysis is also due to the fact that, more than any other author who had previously taken this direction, he emphasized the importance of the logical role that one has to attribute to the division of labour within the theory of economic improvement: The division of labour [. . .], so far as it can be introduced, occasions, in every art, a proportionable increase of the productive powers of labour. The separation of different trades and employments from one another, seems to have taken place in consequence of this advantage. This sep- aration, too, is generally carried furthest in those countries which enjoy the highest degree of industry and improvement; what is the work of one man, in a rude state of society, being generally that of several in an improved one. [. . .] It is the great multiplication of the productions of all</page><page sequence="4">6 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES the different arts, in consequence of the division of labour, which occasions, in a well-governed society, that universal opulence which extends itself to the lowest ranks of the people. {Ibid., pp. 7-8) Smith claims a causal link between the division of labour and the 'degree of improvement' of social organization, via productivity. This therefore concerns a theory, and more precisely an etiological theory, about the 'Wealth of Nations.' Incidentally, this theory - as various historians and above all Marx, have pointed out (Marx, 1910, Part II, chap. 2; 1990, chap. 14, V) - dates not to Smith, for we also find some older and almost identical versions in the writings of Bernard Mandeville, Francis Hutcheson and Adam Ferguson (Hamowy, 1968, pp. 249-259; Hutchi- son, 1988; Rashid, 1986, pp. 292-297; Séris, 1994, pp. 28-57). Therefore in economics, the division of labour is not the only term used to characterize a certain type - the cooperative type - of organi- zation of production. It is also an etiological concept: the idea of a causal relation between both the degree of this type of organization (i.e. the level of cooperation), and the level of 'perfection' or 'civilization,' in the economic sense of the term (wealth), attained by the society. This is why, as we will see, the naturalists who use this notion deliberately spoke of the 'principles' or the 'law' of division of physiological labour. And it is precisely this same notion2 that we find in 1826 from the quill of the young French zoologist Henri Milne-Edwards, when concluding the entry ' Nerfs ,' in the Dictionnaire Classique d'Histoire Naturelle : What we have recently witnessed concerning the nervous system is also happening in various other parts of the animal economy [économie animale ]. It is the very same organ that is used for smell, movement or perspiration; which absorbs edible substances, and also assures the conservation of species. However, little by little these various functions are assigned to a unique instrument; the different physiological sequences, of which each function is composed, are held within distinctive organs. Nature, which is always economical in the means it employs to reach an objective [but], has therefore fol- lowed, in the perfectioning of all beings, the principle [principe] developed by modern economists; and it is in these works of Nature, as well as in artistic productions, that we see the immense advantages resulting from the division of labour. (Milne- Edwards, 1826, p. 533, our translation) 2 For an opposing view, claiming the assimilation of the division of physiological labour of Milne-Edwards with a purely "descriptive unifying principle for the observed specialization of functions in organisms", see Schweber (1980, pp. 211-213).</page><page sequence="5">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 7 The expression, commonly used by Milne-Edwards, of the ' principle of the division of physiological labour' seems ambiguous. However, the zoologist frequently expresses it using, for instance, formulae such as 'the principle of perfectioning by the division of labour,' 'the law of perfectioning by division of labour,' and other similar expressions underlining the causal link between division of labour (as a phenome- non), and organic perfectioning. The idea of a causal relationship between division of labour and the improvement of the organization is reaffirmed further on, in the entry ' Organisation' : It always follows the principle of the division of labour that Nature then proceeds by perfecting the result [perfectionner le résultat] that it needs, or wants to obtain. In animals from lower classifications, the capacity to perceive and transmit sensations, and determine, under the influence of stimulants, muscular con- tractions [...], etc., does not seem to reside in any part of the nervous system. But amongst higher animals, each of these capacities [facultés] tends to be localized [localiseés], and disappear more or less completely with the destruction of the spécifique organ which has become its anatomical basis. (Milne-Edwards, 1827, pp. 343-344, our translation) Why then should we extend the application of a principle, which Milne- Edwards expressly recognized as economic, to the domain of life sciences? The texts quoted above give an answer. To prove that the division of labour applies to the products of living nature as well as to the industries of man is to return to an old and, for most naturalists, persistent problem of biological philosophy (Shanahan, 2004, pp. 94-114): the problem of the rational basis of the hierarchical rank of organisms on the scale ( or chain) of beings (Schweber, 1980, pp. 255-256; Richards, 1992, pp. 135-136; Elwick, 2001, pp. 22-23). 3 This question had already faced 3 For a divergent interpretation concerning Milne Edwards'view of the identity of the theoretical problem that the division of physiological labour is supposed to resolve, see for instance Limoges (1994, pp. 322-326). According to Limoges, the problem is the compatibility between repeated observations on the functional diversity of certain lower marine organisms and the Cuvieran dominant conception of a close functional-ana- tomical correlation. By contrast, we claim that what Limoges considers as the key problem (a strict correlation between anatomical complexity and functional diversity) is in fact one of the conditions required for the adoption of the notion of the division of labour in biology, and we claim that the very problem tackled by Milne-Edwards is to find a rational basis to the role of the index of organic perfection, traditionally assigned to the anatomical complication.</page><page sequence="6">8 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES early 19th century naturalists such as Julien-Joseph Virey or Henry- Marie Ducrotay de Blainville (Virey, 1816, pp. 1-81; Blainville, 1847), who continued to give credence to the traditional scheme of a progressive and unique series of living beings (Daudin, 1926, Vol. 2, pp. 69-236; Lovejoy, 1960, pp. 227-234; Rheinberger, 1986, pp. 237-250), despite many logical incompatibilities involved in its use and the application of systematic classification principles, and in the face of criticisms from eminent naturalists, notably from Cu vier, who wrote in 1817: I have neither pretended nor desired to class animals so as to form a single line, or as to mark their relative superiority. I even consider every attempt of this kind impracticable. [...] I regard my divisions and subdivisions as the merely graduated expression of the resemblance of the beings which enter into each of them; and although in some we observe a sort of passage or gradation from one species into another, which cannot be denied, this disposition is far from being general. The pretended chain of being, as applied to the whole creation, is but an erroneous application of those partial observations, which are only true when confined to the limits within which they were made; and, in my opinion, it has proved more detrimental to the progress of natural history in modern times, than it easy to imagine. (Cuvier, 1817, Vol. 1, xvii) We see that, as he criticizes it, Cuvier recognizes the influence that this model continues to have of the unique and progressive series on his contemporary naturalists. The Distinction between Localization and Multiplication of Organic Functions To say that the organic rank attributed to living organisms has no ra- tional basis does not mean that, in practice, there are no criteria which allow an establishment of hierarchy amongst living things. It simply means that these criteria are in need of a rational justification. Among the criteria traditionally retained, there is one which stands out, and which continues to play a role in many attempts to define the biological pro- gress4: that of morphological complication (or anatomical complexity). If one was to rely exclusively upon this criteria, one would then state that the 4 B. Rosslenbroich has tried to list the various definitions underlying the multiple occurrences of the terminology of progress in the contemporary biological literature. Among these definitions, those including the criterion of anatomical complications to a greater or lesser extent, are still very numerous. See Rosslenbroich (2006, pp. 41-70).</page><page sequence="7">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 9 more anatomically complex an animal is, the higher on that scale it will be situated. Following the elementary principle which claims that there is no faculty without anatomical basis, morphological complication needs to be considered as correlating to a physiological phenomenon. In fact, since the beginning of the 19th century at least, at any given level of anatomical complexity, it has been customary to admit a proportional degree of diversity of functional aptitudes within the selected organism (Daubenton, 1782, xvii; Vicq d'Azyr, 1792, xxvi; Lamarck, 1801, p. 19; 1809, p. 220; Virey, 1816, pp. 12-13). However, that which naturalists generally hold as an auxiliary phenomena and, at best, a complementary feature of the multiplication of faculties - that is, the localization of functions - is considered by Milne-Edwards to be the main physiolog- ical characteristic, which is truly correlative to anatomical complexity. It is necessary, in his view, to substitute the notion of functional diversi- fication with the notion of functional localization as the concept the best able to characterize the nature of physiological phenomenon, which is correlated to the anatomical phenomenon of complexity. Milne- Edwards largely insists upon this point in other works (Milne-Edwards, 1834, Vol. 1, pp. 7-10; Milne-Edwards, 1847, pp. 293-297; 1857-1881, Vol. 1, pp. 19-23), although with more verve in speech than in practice, as we shall see later on. Take this extract from a work from 1845 on physiological circulation, in which the author targets Lamarck: Several authors have admitted as an obvious axiom of zoology that 'the function is immanent in the organ'; in such a way that when an organ disappears, the faculty toward which it was the instrument must also disappear. Lamarck for example, refused to accord sensitivity to all animals which have no brain, for, concerning all beings in which this faculty is most evident, it has as its main instrument the nervous system. It is also for this reason that one denies the existence of blood circulation in animals possessing neither heart, nor arteries, nor veins, or that one should admit the existence of all these parts everywhere that physiologists have witnessed the circulatory movement of nutrient fluids. Neverthe- less, it is to form too narrow an idea of Nature, as well as a poor reflection of her resourcefulness of Nature, to believe that she is forcibly attached to such a necessity. It is nevertheless true that the faculty with which Nature endows a living being can only be exerted using the medium of an organ or instrument; but this instrument is not always the same, and the physiological results of a same standing can be obtained by various means. When one admits</page><page sequence="8">10 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES this necessary interdependence between function and organ, one can no longer comprehend the physiology of inferior animals; for one sees progressively in these animals the disappearance of each of these instruments which, amongst the most perfect of beings, are indis- pensible toward the exercise of the most necessary faculties to sur- vival of either the individual or the species. Despite all this, these lower graded [dégradés] animals live and reproduce just as success- fully as the higher. (Milne-Edwards, 1868, t. 1, pp. 62-63) To summarize, the vital faculties do not disappear as the complexity of the organism decreases towards simplification. They just spread out, meaning that they are being fulfilled by a wider variety of anatomical parts within the animal body. Milne-Edwards never ceased to defend this theory throughout his scientific career. It is from this perspective that one can understand his interest for the much talked about experi- ments (1744) of Abraham Trembley on Hydra vulgaris (Trembley, 1744), which were repeated successfully by several naturalists during the 19th century, notably by Jean-Louis Laurent (Laurent, 1842). By demonstrating that the undifferentiated anatomical parts of the hydra continue to survive and even to reproduce themselves after their sepa- ration from the whole, Trembley provided, according to Milne- Edwards, the experimental proof that structural simplicity does not entail poorness of functions, but rather a de-concentration of function. To put it conceptually: the physiological term of reference corre- sponding to anatomical complication is not functional diversity, but functional localization. What is at stake here? And just what does this discussion reveal? It is at this point that one again finds the problem of the origin of the notion of the division of physiological labour: the question of the rational justifi- cation of the rank attributed to organisms. If the principle of division of labour is truly valid both in living beings and human industry, then the idea of an intrinsic hierarchical place of all living things loses its arbitrary character. For a given animal species, one could now say with certainty which rank on the zoological scale it belongs at, on the sole basis of the degree of division of physiological labour it has reached through its body. There are also subsidiary conditions which, incidentally, Milne- Edwards also targeted (Milne-Edwards, 1851, pp. 76-78); but these seem to hold less importance for the accreditation of the concept of division of physiological labour. Particularly: what would happen when the division of physiological labour achieves a higher degree within one animal species than in another, in relation to certain organic parts (for instance the workings of locomotion), and to a lesser degree, in relation</page><page sequence="9">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 1 1 to other parts (for instance the mechanisms of nutrition)? The solution would be to total up the (possibly various) degrees in the division of labour attained by each part of the animal body, and to compare the various culminating levels in different species. Note that this condition is not specific to the division of labour, and that this argument applies equally to the morphological criteria (anatomical complexity). At any rate, it is thanks to Milne-Edwards that we came to understand that the substitution of multiplication of functions with localization of functions, to which the naturalist community still seems to lend little or no credence, constitutes one of the key-conditions for adopting the theory of the division of labour in biology, and thus solves an old and formidable philosophical problem in natural history: the rational basis for the organic value of living beings. But there is another condition in adopting such a theory: the assimilation of functional organic activity with labour in the economic sense of the term (productive labour). Milne-Edwards knows this well, as he repeatedly employs expressions such as 'respiratory labour' [travail respiratoire ], 'secretory labour' [travail secrétoire ], 'digestive labour' [travail digestif], 'irrigatory labour' [travail irrigatole] etc., concerning the functioning of an organ or apparatus (Milne-Edwards, 1857-1881, Vol. 1, pp. 507-508; Vol. 7, pp. 190, 200, 283, 287, 292; Vol. 5, pp. 269, 273; Vol. 13, pp. 229, 390-391; Vol. 14, pp. 202, 223, 226, 230). It is as if organic activity, either in general or as applied to a particular organ, was truly and not just metaphorically a type of labour in the economic sense of the term. But there is significant difference between affirming that these phenomena actually belong to the economic category of activities producing goods, and proving this. Likewise, that functional concentration more than functional diver- sity progressively increases with greater morphological complication increases. To be specific, one will see that even Milne- Edwards, among all those trying to solve the same problem (the rational basis of the organic rank of species), through employing the notion of the division of physiological labour, finally comes to respect neither of those two logical prerequisites for the validity of the concept. The Problematic Nature of the Presuppositions Underlying the Use of the Concept The Problem of Comparing the Functional Activity of Organs to Labour in the Economic Sense During the 19th century, there were few scientists who openly expressed their reservations concerning the validity of the concept of the division</page><page sequence="10">12 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES of physiological labour. This fact brings out the importance of the comments made by two of them: Claude Bernard and Charles Robin.5 One figures in Bernard's Leçons sur les phénomènes de la vie commun aux animaux et aux végétaux (1878). The second appears in Anatomie et physiologie cellulaire (1873), from Robin. The first is as follows: Successive differentiation is a demonstrated fact, when we follow the development of a given being. The elementary cells [...] dif- ferentiate and specialize by exaggerating certain properties to the detriment of others. [...]. This differentiation, this specialization is finally a division of physiological labour. This division is incom- plete, since each element, by exaggerating one property, naturally contains the others without which it could not live. Within these limits and with this restriction, the principle of division of physi- ological labour seems accurate: it is the expression of the truth. Outside of this framework it is often applied in a way which is illegitimate and erroneous. In a word, this principle is true in general physiology, but false in comparative physiology. It pre- supposes indeed that all organisms do the same work, with more specific instruments and more sophistication on the top of the scale, and with lesser instruments and more roughly at the bottom of the scale. Yet this is only true for the vital work, which is common to all living beings, for the essential conditions of elementary life. It is not true for functional activities, which are not necessarily common to all living beings. One extra organ does not imply the idea of a more sophisticated tool for the same work: it implies a new work, or a new complication to the work. (Bernard, 1878-1879, Vol. 1, pp. 374-375, our translation) Underlying this, and therefore according to Bernard, the division of labour does not apply to the functions of the macroscopic organism, but only to the properties of their elementary constituents (the cells). To speak about division of labour applied to macroscopic functions sup- poses that we are dealing with the same functions as we move from one organism to another. This, according to Bernard, is a false view. Robin 5 Charles-Philippe Robin (1821-1885), founder in 1848 (with Claude Bernard and Charles-Edouard Brown Sequard) of the Société de Biologie, author with Emile Littré of a famous Dictionnaire de médecine (1855) was a leading figure of the French histology of the second half of the 19th century. However, the true impact on the progress of the French biological and medical research by this prolific writer, animated by a knowl- edgeable and tireless curiosity, was far from being always positive, according to histo- rians. Robin was a member of the Académie de Médecine (1858) and the Académie des Sciences (1868).</page><page sequence="11">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 1 3 adds a supplementary argument which further argues against the application concept of division of physiological labour. Here is what he said: Firstly, the facts [i.e. anatomical and functional complexities] which were previously described; secondly, the generation of elements and therefore new organs, while there are no more "blastodermic" cells in the embryo; and thirdly, the generation within each cell of particles which did not previously exist [. . .] are considered by several authors as a separation, or differentiation of the parts and correlating func- tions which depend on a division of physiological labour (Gegen- baur, etc.). [. . .] The work of the whole economy, and that of its parts, did not exist before the appearance and cannot be divided. It appears, it grows and multiplies with each faculty, which appear one after the other. But the genesis and multiplication of the parts, which are different despite being mutually dependent, by the very fact of their conditions and their mode of generation, is not division. [...] Fur- thermore, at this point, the cell, the tissue, the organ, etc., accomplish acts, but do not elaborate objects. Concerning the division of labour there is an enacting ( mise en oeuvre) of objects external to the agent: man or machine; there is division between several individuals (acting separately, with or without co-operation, simultaneously or other- wise) in the execution of operations which differ from each other, and which were previously carried out by just one individual [...]. Thus it is not without reservation that we are compelled to accept into biology theories of division of labour which have been borrowed from economists by several modern naturalists. (Robin, 1873, pp. 294-295, original italics, our translation) As with Bernard, the notion of the division of physiological labour is approached from a broader perspective. However, unlike Bernard, it was no longer a matter of defending the validity of general physiology alongside comparative physiology, but preserving certain aspects of preforma tionism in the debate concerning the theory of generation. But even if Robin intends to give a wider critical role to his considerations concerning the division of physiological labour, his critique against the notion is perfectly viable as it stands. His style is more abstract and opaque than that of Bernard, but the argument is identical, namely that one cannot compare organisms from the point of view of the division of labour (or from the specialization of functions) because these functions are not the same, and their number varies according to the complexity of the organism considered.</page><page sequence="12">14 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES But Robin is not content with this alone. He goes further, and adds something else: in the last lines of his text, Robin discusses the problem presented by assimilation of organic activity to labour in an economic sense, which is a logical implication of the notion of the division of physiological labour. This problem was, to our knowledge, never dis- cussed by Bernard. In the passage we refer to, Robin infers a distinction between the act and the object ("object external to the agent") which itself depends on the validity of the notion of division of labour, in economics as well as physiology. This distinction is certainly equivalent to that which the economists draw between production and product (external to the producer). Through want of a better term, Robin clearly saw that in order to apply the concept of the division of labour, the distinction between productivity and product cannot be an analytical but rather a real distinction. This requirement was already an obstacle to extending the application of the etiological notion of the division of labour to service activities in economic theory (François, 1990, pp. 715-729). Consequently it is the case in physiology - a discipline which studies functions that may be assimilated to services, but never, or only exceptionally (for example, secretions) to manufactured pro- ductions of goods, i.e. of objects exterior to the producers. From Adam Smith to John Stuart-Mill and even later thinkers, a recurring debate is found in history of classical political economics concerning the problem of establishing which human activities truly produce wealth, meaning they are work in the economic sense of the term (productive labour). This is the famous controversy regarding the question of the separation of productive labour and non-productive labour (Schumpeter, 1987, pp. 176-178, 597-600). Adam Smith decided to put a strict limit on the field of the notion of productive labour, as he excluded from his jurisdiction all activity that "does not fix or realize itself in any particular subject or vendible commodity [...], and seldom leave any trace or value behind it for which an equal quantity of service could afterwards be procured." (Smith, 1778, Vol. 1, p. 401) This refusal concerns equally occupations considered as unprofitable or frivolous (servant, actors...), as more respectable professions (magistrate, officer, physician...). Needless to say, these are professional activities which involve a considerable number of people and therefore play an impor- tant role in the actual economy. It is perhaps an oversimplification, but not entirely untrue, to say that the trend over the 19th century was the gradual extension of the jurisdiction of the concept of productive labour far beyond the limits set by Smith: all sorts of jobs, considered until then as unproductive,</page><page sequence="13">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 1 5 gradually became recognized as productive labour. For instance, John Stuart Mill judged as relevant for this category: inventors, physicians, teachers, the police force, etc., for the reason that they are all, in one way or other, indirectly productive. Mill wrote in his Principals of Political Economy : "We should regard all labour as productive, which is employed in creating permanent utilities, whether embodied in human beings, or in any other animate or inanimate objects" (Mill, 1965, Vol. 1, p. 48). The definition of productive labour that Mill gives is without doubt wider than Smith's, as in addition to material objects it includes human beings among the materials which are able to be worked upon. Yet the same notions of duration and materiality are found in Mill's definition as in Smith's: those implied by the term of 'product,' in its usual sense, as opposed to 'production.' The presence of these components within this broad view of the division of labour has a signification relative to the question at hand. It is difficult to deny the validity of the distinction between production and product when giving a definition of productive labour which is com- patible with the conventional meaning of the term (labour which pro- duces wealth). Applying this meaning, it is thus incorrect to denote as productive work any activity for which the distinction between the production and the product is purely analytical or theoretical, and therefore not a real and genuine distinction. To then say that the idea of the production of services is contradictory per se would be going too far. It is perhaps even reasonable to think that productivity of an unproductive worker, like that of a productive worker, varies according to the level to which the division of labour is established. It has to be said, however, that it is much more difficult to estimate the gain of the generated productivity by an increase of the division of work in a firm providing services, than that of industrial manufacture (producing goods) (Mark, 1982, pp. 3-8; Blois, 1985, pp. 45-60; Harvey, 1987, pp. 29-38; McLaughlin and Coffey, 1990, pp. 46-64). The difficulty in measuring productivity in services is greater still in physiology, when organic functioning is compared to work in the eco- nomic sense of the term. If there is any kind of economic labour that presents analogies with organic functioning, then it is surely with the so-called 'unproductive' tasks, which are services. Generally speaking, the functional activity of such-and-such an organ lends itself more to supplying a service for the whole than to contributing to the production of an organic substance separable from the body. This is most notable in the distinction between product and production applied to the working of an organism, which is an analytical distinction only. Assuming that</page><page sequence="14">16 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES the functioning of organs really constitutes economic labour, it should be placed in the category of service labour (i.e. unproductive). It is then inevitable that biologists have to face, in their calculation of the pro- ductivity of 'physiological work' of the whole or a part of the organism, the same methodological difficulties as economists when they estimate the productivity of services. This leads to a fundamental question, which must be resolved in order to be able to use the division of labour in physiology: how can we estimate the zoological value of each species according to the degree of division of labour, if we do not have the means to measure the productivity of vital work and are thus unable to establish a causal link between division of labour and productivity of physiological labour? The Limited Application of the Concept of Functional Multiplication There is a further problem. Due to the implications of the notion like of the division of physiological labour, it is not enough to consider the activity of each organ as individual 'work.' These organic functions should also be viewed as plastic and wide-ranging. In other words, as we examine different functions from one species to another, we need to keep in mind that it is the same work, as underlined by Bernard. For example, the digestive function in a bird is the same process as the digestive function in a crustacean. This is also the case in economics. When Smith uses the case of 'pin- makers' for example, he refers to the tasks which remain the same, whether carried out step by step by just one worker, or by several workers simultaneously (division of labour). Smith, reusing a model of a pin factory described in 1755 by Alexandre Deleyre in Diderot and d'Alembert's Encyclopédie (Diderot, 1755, pp. 804-808), divides the production of one single pin into eighteen distinct operations: One man draws out the wire, another straights it, a third cuts it, a fourth points it, a fifth grinds it at the top for receiving the head; to make the head requires two or three distinct operations; to put it on, is a peculiar business, to whiten the pins is another; it is even a trade by itself to put them into the paper; and the important business of making a pin is, in this manner, divided into about eighteen distinct operations, which, in some manufactories, are all performed by distinct hands, though in some others the same man will sometimes perform two or three of them. (Smith, 1778, Vol. 1, p. 6). The very fact that, during the 18th century, this production shifts from craftsmen to manufacturing, does not lead to any notable change in the</page><page sequence="15">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 1 7 process itself: the production of objects still involves the same elemen- tary operations. At the beginning of the last century, the Belgian economist Laurent Dechesne rightly criticized Smith for a confusion in his examples chosen to illustrate the division of labour, as some phenomena relate to the division of labour strictly speaking, whereas others relate to different type of 'specialized production' (Dechesne, 1901, pp. 1 18-162, 730-751, 1087-1122). Dechesne wrote: "It is necessary to proceed toward a com- plete revision of the concept of division of labour, and to replace it with the expression 'specialization of production,' the idea of specialization replacing the idea of 'division,' and the notion of production replacing the notion of labour." {Ibid., p. 151). Hence 'specialization of production' seems to the economist to be a more flexible notion, which he substitutes with the former to create an all-encompassing concept. Since the work of Dechesne, other historical studies have established the inaccuracy of the Smithian conception of division of labour (Meek and Skinner, 1973, pp. 1094-1 116). But the criticism of Deschesne seems to us particularly interesting in this case. Indeed, one of the motives given by the economist to support this change of vocabulary is that for the division of labour, contrary to the specialization of production, the final product always remains identical. But it in no way suggests the idea of any multiplication or diversification of the component tasks. Yet if the end product changes after a development in the specialization of production, except in the case where specialization takes the form of division of labour strictly speaking (such as in a pin factory), it then becomes impossible to compare the respective productivity of labour resulting in two different end products. What is true for economics is even more so in physiology. Following the requirement that has been given concerning the understanding and extension of the economic notion, we must exclude from the application of the concept of the division of physiological labour all the physiological phenomena which have less similarity with the division of labour strictly speaking, than with any other kind of specialization of production. This is particularly the case with the well-known phenomenon of the multipli- cation of functions. Functional multiplication belongs more to the development, within society, of completely new trades. This is clearly a type of specialization which is different to the division of labour. By contrast, localization of physiological functions within an organism appears to be similar in some respects to the process of division of labour within a factory, in the sense at least that it is a process which applies to the manufacture of one product (clothing, a watch, playing cards, etc.). If we hope to have a chance of solving the problem of the rational</page><page sequence="16">18 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES foundation of the zoological values of species, it must also be demon- strated that the relevant physiological variable of the 'anatomophysio- logical pair' correlating to the phenomenon of morphological differentiation is localization, and not a multiplication of functions. Needless to say, this demonstration has never been made. The author who has without doubt done more than anyone else to tackle the logical demands involved in using the concept of the division of physiological labour - Milne-Edwards himself- seems to move back a step, rather than resolve the difficulty. This is how he proceeds: in general Milne-Edwards concedes that there is certainly a creation of distinctive functions at the sub-functional level (and ever more so at the level of the 'elementary acts' that make up these lower functions), but not as far as the general func- tions themselves are concerned. For example chewing, swallowing, sali- vating, etc., are recognized by Milne-Edwards as new abilities which appear progressively as up the scale of complexity of organisms, but not the digestive function itself, of which these particular abilities form the component parts (Milne-Edwards, 1847, pp. 11-16; 1868, pp. 59-60, 65). However, Milne-Edwards occasionally contradicts himself and admits that - even talks as if - at the level of the general functions themselves, there really is an increasing creation of functions as we go up the animal scale (Milne-Edwards, 1847, pp. 269-270; 1868, pp. 64, 72). Although he never fully admits the whole notion, his vocabulary frequently betrays the difficulty involved in considering 'functional multiplication' as a solely secondary variable, and thus applicable only to sub-functions. * Despite the difficulties caused by certain implications of the concept, the division of (physiological) labour met with great success in the life sci- ences in the second half of the 19th century. Both the term and the idea were reused by many morphologists, physiologists and embryologists - especially in zoology, but there are also some attempts to use this notion in botany (Saporta and Marion, 1881, chap. 8; Sachs, 1887, Introductory Remarks) - such as Rudolf Leuckart, Heinrich Bronn, Ernst Haeckel, Karl Gegenbaur, Oscar Hertwig and Max Verworn in Germany, Claude Bernard, Edmond Perrier, Mathias Duval, Louis Roule, Yves Delage, Frédéric Houssay and Alfred Dastre in France, Thomas Huxley in Britain, Ermanno Giglio-Tos in Italy6 - all renowned authors in their 6 See especially: Leuckart, 1851, Bronn, 1858, Part 3, Haeckel, 1866, Vol. 1, drittes Buch, Vol. 2, fünftes Buch, Gegenbaur, 1874, Kap. 2; Hertwig, 1888, Kap. 4; Verworn, 1894, Kap. 6; Bernard, 1878-1879, 9e Leçon, Perrier, 1881, Livre 2; Roule, 1893, chap. 9; Delage, 1896, pp. 641-653; Duval, 1897, chap. 5; Houssay, 1900, 1, chap. 3; Dastre, 1903, Livre 3; Huxley, 1877, Part 1, chap. 5; Giglio-Tos, 1900, Part 1, chap. 5.</page><page sequence="17">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 19 field. During this period, in all the most important scientific nations of Europe, many biologists, confronted with the problem of the rational justification of the organic value of living beings, had recourse to the notion of the division of physiological labour. An irony of history is that even Darwin credited the notion (Darwin, 1872, pp. 74, 89-90, 97-98, 233, 389; 1882, pp. 51-52, 136, 164, 286), despite being the naturalist who was the most active in rendering null and void the very problem which led to the notion itself. Darwin, however, did not generally use the expression in the same sense. He meant rather a division of labour between different organisms competing for finite resources in the same geographical area (ecological division of labour), than a division of labour between organs, regarded less as consumer than as producer, and which cooperate within the same organism (division of physiological labour strictly speaking). The latter seems closer, as Tammone in particular has noted (Tammone, 1995, pp. 125-126), to what the economists call the 'manufacturing' or 'technical' division of labour, whereas the former seems more like what is called the 'social' or 'vocational' or even 'professional' division of labour.7 But beyond Darwin, how then could such a concept have met with a wide acceptation in the scientific community, given the inherent problems involved in its adoption, and encountered by naturalists? We can only reiterate the explanation previously suggested: in the division of physi- ological labour, naturalists saw a way out of a snare in philosophical biology which seemed unavoidable, i.e. the problem of the rational jus- tification of the hierarchical rank attributed to organisms. We can con- sider that the seriousness and the importance of this problem, as well as the emphasis given to its successful resolution, concerned biologists more than the logical difficulties presented by the use of this notion. Darwinism and the Crisis of the Concept of the Division of Physiological Labour Disappearance of the ( False ) Problem of the Foundation of Organic Perfection For over one and a half centuries, thinkers have attempted to apply the theory of evolution to different fields of human knowledge - from 7 A growing literature is now available on the specific Darwinian conception of the division of physiological labour, its evolution and its difference with the notion from Milne- Edwards (Limoges, 1968, pp. 111-115; 1994, pp. 326-330; Young, 1972, pp. 202-205; Schweber, 1980, pp. 21 1-214, 250-257, 266-267; Kohn, 1985, pp. 245-247, 256; Tammone, 1995, pp. 121-128; Gould, 2002, pp. 224-234; Shanahan, 2004, pp. 181-184).</page><page sequence="18">20 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES life sciences to psychology and epistemology. Among these attempts to explore the implications of this theory, there arise some issues which specifically concern the philosophy of biology, such as the question of the validity of an idea of a hierarchy structuring the living kingdom in post-Darwinian biology. The examination of the epistemological treatment of this question would seem to fall within the perimeter of our research, as it is a prejudicial issue to the question highlighted earlier of the rational foundation of the hierarchical ranking of living beings. It is obvious that, if there is no actual hierarchy between living beings (in an anthropomorphical sense), then the foundation for this hierarchy becomes meaningless. It would certainly be untrue to say that the Darwinian theory does not accommodate any kind of value judgment concerning living species. The very idea that there exists an axiological difference between individuals competing for the same ecological place - a difference between their respective 'adaptative values' - has its roots in Darwin. In this very strict sense, it is in accordance with the Darwinian interpretation to speak of inferiority or superiority of one given group over another. However, it is clear that the sense given by the English naturalist to those terms is not close enough to the traditional meaning to be able to deduce any idea of a fixed hierarchical order from Darwin's axiological notions. So what does Darwin have in mind when using such terms? A vast literature exists on such questions of interpretation of Darwin's writ- ings, which were once hotly debated by historians and philosophers of evolutionary theory (Mayr, 1976, pp. 44-52, 277-296; Ospovat, 1981, pp. 60-86; Bowler, 1989, pp. 177-223; Richards, 1992, pp. 80-166; Gould, 2002, pp. 224-234, 467-479; Browne, 2002, pp. 43-81; Ruse, 2003; Shanahan, 2004, pp. 173-196). Historians are generally agreed on the following proposition: when Darwin applied the words 'superior' and 'inferior' to organisms or species, it was always either (a) in the same sense as used by his fellow naturalists, though Darwin claimed elsewhere that they had not produced a clear and rational definition of these terms, or (b) by adding an ecological dimension (reference to the local environment) to the usual definition of these terms, which changes their meaning in such a way that their scope is considerably reduced. When it concerns his own thoughts on the subject or at least his thoughts as a theorist of natural selection, Darwin never refers to one taxon (organism or species) as intrinsically inferior or superior to another. This kind of axiological judgment is justified, according to him, only if one also refers to a given ecological context. Certainly, some historians as Ospovat, Richards, and Shanahan, in the passages refered</page><page sequence="19">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 21 to above, argued that Darwin was not only 'progressive' in social and political issues, but also in biology too, as were his fellow naturalists. But they also argued that Darwin recognized that some of the logical implications of his theory, and certain interpretations of facts in para- sitology, embryology, paleontology, etc., contradicted, or were at least hardly in accordance with his progressive biological views. It is the same when Darwin employs the terminology of progress. Historians have shown that he either talks in the same way as other naturalists of the time about the progress of 'organization' in general - and in such cases he never fails to suggest or to mention "that it is hardly possible to define clearly what is meant by the organisation being higher or lower" (Darwin, 1872, p. 389), or that his fellow naturalists "have not defined to each other's satisfaction what is meant by an advance in organisation" (Ibid., p. 97) - or he speaks in a way as does not imply any idea of universality. 'Progress,' in this case, signifies advantageous change (morphological and/or physiological) regarding the circumstances in which the organism evolves. This conception is clearly the consequence of a more general and fundamental evolutionary vision of living forms, by which is distinguished notably the fact that it is radically non-teleological. As stated by the authors of Du développement à l'évolution au XV Ule et XIXe siècles, according to Darwin "life has neither preference nor plan; it is not oriented towards anything, not even its own conservation. It is the chance of a given area which negatively orients it, and sometimes, stabilizes it" (Canguilhem et al., 1962, p. 33, our translation). So, any progress coming from the division of labour should be viewed in Darwin's very euphemistic sense of the term, i.e. progress indexed to an ecological parameter. In addition, any causal relationship between the division of labour and progress is definitely not systematic. It is true that, like many of his fellow naturalists, Darwin sometimes seems to give credit to the idea of productivity (or efficiency) of func- tional activity - what Michael Ghiselin interprets as 'energetic advan- tage' (Ghiselin, 1974, p. 101) - which varies depending on the degree of physiological division of labour within a single organism. But Darwin is still not very clear on the issue (Darwin, 1872, pp. 89-90, 233; 1882, pp. 52, 136). In fact, he is all too aware of the gap that separates specialization, as an effect of the division of labour between organisms ,8 8 The implications (cooperation ví. competition, functional efficiency vs. maximizing the number of inhabitants within the same area) of the duality of level (intra ví. interindividual) of the application of the division of labour in Darwin's texts, have been explored well by several historians. See Limoges (1968, p. 114), Ghiselin (1978, pp. 234-235), Ghiselin (1974, pp. 233-240), Tammone (1995, pp. 125-128), Gould (2002, pp. 231-232).</page><page sequence="20">22 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES and adaptation strictly speaking, as an effect of natural selection. This prevents him from drawing a strict parallel between division of labour in general and progress, and even more so between specialization and progress. In Darwin's point of view, gains in specialization lead to losses in functional plasticity, and the future is certainly not always favourable for species confined in an ecological niche, or attached to an exclusive way of life. Natural selection can even favour the development of cer- tain simpler and more rudimentary offsprings than their ancestors from an anatomical point of view: a simplicity which is generally labelled as 'degraded,' 'degenerated,' 'regressive' or 'retrograded.' Darwin indeed notes many exceptions to the so-called rule of proportionality between the degree of division of physiological labour and morphological differentiation on the one hand, and the level of reproductive success on the other. For example, Darwin enjoyed quoting the case studies of certain parasites, which have been discovered to have had an 'illustrious' genealogy, and which are actually 'degraded' or 'degener- ated' offsprings coming from forms more complex (Darwin, 1872 pp. 99, 175, 390). In a nutshell, according to Darwin there is no such thing as an anatomical or physiological modality of progress. It is meaningless to attempt to make a valid estimation of the level of adaptative value of an individual regardless of circumstances, taking into account only its degree of structural complication, for instance, or the degree of division of physiological labour which it has attained. The parallel with the notion of species, and the way Darwin deals with it, is instructive. Even though historians disagree regarding the Darwinian interpretation if there are serious disagreements about the Darwinian interpretation of the term 'species' (on whether it is nomi- nalistic or not, and to which degree) and its epistemological status, they all allow that Darwin continued to use the terminology of species, even though his theory imposed a radical revision of its meaning, notably dismissing the essentialist connotations it traditionally included. Darwin went on using such terms as 'inferior' and 'superior' organization (or organism), 'progress,' 'improvement' etc., while developing notions which were radically incompatible with the common meanings that naturalists gave to these terms.9 From an historiographical point of view, it is basically the same for the categories of progress and improvement as the category of species in biology. Once one agrees on For a fairly nominalistic interpretation of the species in Darwin, see Stamos, 2004, chap. 2 and 3; 2007, chap. 8; Lherminier and Solignac, 2005, pp. 53-62. For a more realistic view, see: Beatty, 1992, pp. 227-245.</page><page sequence="21">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 23 the radical critical consequences implied by the Darwinian theory, the problems relating to the use of these grand methodological categories of natural history lose their raison d'être. This explains the gradual disappearance of the question how can we rationally justify the hierarchical place of each living form within the organic scale, as one of the pressing concerns of biologists. Indeed, the residual and minimal understanding of the axiological dimension of living phenomena that post-Darwinian biology was able to allow was simply not enough to impart the idea of one sole hierarchical scale. The fundamental problem of the justification of the organic rank of living beings became, quite simply, a non-issue. In saying this, we obviously do not want to suggest that this shift in awareness was sudden. Indeed, we know, especially since the studies of Peter Bowler (Bowler, 1983, 1988), that naturalists after Darwin included their anthropomorphic and teleological beliefs in their evolutionism for a long time, and just how late and difficult the ideological break logically implied by the Darwinian theory just was. But even slow, thwarted and laborious this shift was, a shift it indeed was. Downgrading and Rejecting the Concept of the Division of Physiological Labour From the time the question of organic rank is shown to be a false problem, the theory supposed to constitute the solution to this question is thus dispossessed of a major part of its initial interest. A major part, but not the entirely. It is certainly true that the division of physiological labour has also been considered as interesting because of the reference of the term to another etiological and sociological idea: what causes the interdependence of parts within the whole being (or cause of organic unity). The interest that the notion presents to this problem of organic integrity obviously does not disappear with the invalidation of the fundamental problem of the rational basis of an organic rank of living beings' organic rank (Myers, 1967, pp. 432-440). Of course, this is not either to say that hierarchical principles have lost all influence in evolutionary biology. In the 20th century, the story of the taxonomie notion of grade is a case in point. Provided notably during the 40's and the 50's by some of the first architects (Huxley, 1942; Mayr, 1942; Rensch, 1947; Simpson, 1961) of modern synthesis, this notion met with a certain success in the naturalist community up to the 70's. As other historians (Tassy, 1991, pp. 99-100, 137; Le Guyader, 2003, pp. 39-43), we can seriously wonder whether such a success is in</page><page sequence="22">24 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES spite of or indeed due to the fact that the usual definition of evolu- tionary 'grade' as a threshold of structural-functional organization implies the idea of a hierarchy in the consecutive evolutionary stages of living forms. Even in recent naturalist studies (Queiroz, 1988, pp. 252-253), we can find traces of this trend to update the theory of the chain of beings, by 'temporalizing' it (Lovejoy, 1936, p. 242). This is despite the fact that cladistic analysis has demonstrated the confusion between paraphyletic and monophyletic groups (clades) inherent in the category of grade, and the impossibility to establish a real phylogenic classification by using such a concept (Panchen, 1992, pp. 132-168). So the idea of hierarchy persists somewhere in the imagination of biologists. But to claim a universal, timeless and rationally justified hierarchy in the living kingdom would be a step too far, as the idea of an evolution of species with no aim or predetermined direction, an ''évolution sans projet ,' to quote the biologist François Jacob (Jacob, 1979, pp. 145-147), has become a self-evident truth for the vast majority of naturalists. The notion of the division of physiological labour has therefore lost its main function, which is the rational justification of using morphological complexity as the criteria of organic perfection. This in itself constitutes a good reason not to use it any longer. At the same time the theoretical difficulties entailed by its use which were explained previously - i.e. on the one hand the possible parallel between the functional activity of organs and a work, in the economic sense of the term, and on the other the possible substitution of functional multiplication by functional localiza- tion in the role of physiological parameter par excellence - remain unresolved. Moreover, these difficulties are no longer counter-balanced by any theoretical advantages provided by the use of this concept. In any event, after considering the advantages and disadvantages of the notion of the division of physiological labour, it would seem that now the balance is clearly weighed towards the costs rather than the benefits. In fact, after a period of latency, which corresponds more or less to the time it took for the naturalist community to accustom itself to Darwin's ideas, the notion of the division of physiological labour dis- appeared completely from the manuals and treatises of animal mor- phology and embryology. The French treatise Traité de zoologie for instance, considerable work of 52 volumes edited by Pierre Grassé between 1950 and 1979, seems to ignore the concept of division of physiological labour entirely. When the terminology occasionaly is used, for example in the case of societies of social insects (ants, social hymenoptera, bees...), it's always in the sense of a differentiation of</page><page sequence="23">THE DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 25 tasks between individuals cooperating in a colony (Grassé, 1950-1979, t. 10, pp. 1067-1069, 1143-1145, 1248-1251). This conceptual treat- ment, which omits any reference to the idea of improvement of the organization, contrasts sharply with that of the division of labour, for example in the previous Traité de zoologie by the brothers Edmond and Rémy Perrier, published fifty years earlier by the same editor. Indeed in this treatise, E. Perrier held that "the physiological division of labour is the condition for progress and improvement of individual organisms, as it is the condition for the progress, development and power of industries and human societies" (Perrier, 1893, Vol. 1, p. 23). To show how obsolete this notion became in just a few decades, we can also take the example of the French naturalist and embryologist Louis Roule, who published the tenth and last volume of his impressive monography on fish in 1937 (Roule, 1926-1937). This volume concerns "The Biological Philosophy and General Economy of the Living World", to quote its title. However, neither the term, nor even the concept of the division of physiological labour is ever used in this vol- ume. This omission is illustrative of the grievous fate of the notion, especially when we realise the importance that the author formerly attached to the 'law' of the division of physiological labour, as the following extracts from his works prior to 1900 show: Nature improves from simple to complex, through a increasing differentiation which is closely related to the division of physio- logical labour; this dual principle which we owe to Milne-Edwards, of connection and of continuous progress is the basis of all natural history and is undeniably the highest and most complete expression of the philosophy of biological sciences. (Roule, 1894, VII, our translation) Nature goes from simple to complex by a greater and greater dif- ferentiation of forms linked to an ever-increasing division of vital work. This principle is truly the fundamental law [loi directrice ] in the biological sciences, as well as in the sciences connected to them. It is a constant guide, without which we only find falsehood and error. All naturalists, all philosophers who search for the truth must keep it well in mind and never depart from it. (Roule, 1898, Vol. 1, VII, our translation) This unequivocal praise of the notion formulated by Milne-Edwards dates from Roule's early work. In the following decades, the 'market price' of the concept of intrinsic organic value fell considerably as - once again, not by mere chance - Darwinian ideas gained credit.</page><page sequence="24">26 EMMANUEL D'HOMBRES Conclusion As soon as we realise that it is illusory to believe in the possibility of organizing taxa of the same taxonomie class in a sole hierarchical series, it clearly becomes nonsensical to speak about a 'law' of the division of physiological labour. Then the breakdown of the pairing 'morphologi- cal differentiation/division of physiological labour' simply becomes a question of time. Nothing now prevents these concepts, which have been linked together for some time, from moving once again in their separate directions, each with varying levels of success. We now know that from the two terms which make up this conceptual pair, the future will only retain the anatomical variable. Today the concept of differ- entiation, in so far as it refers to at least one essential modality of the evolutionary process, remains a fundamental concept in embryology, and to a lesser degree in evolutionary biology. By contrast, the concept of the division of physiological labour is now practically unimproved, except by naturalists studying animal societies, and who are especially interested in the division of labour between individual organisms (Beshers and Fewell, 2001, pp. 413-440; Anderson et al., 2001, pp. 643-651; Page and Erber, 2002, pp. 91-106). If the concept is no longer of concern to the biologists, it has become a subject only for historians and philosophers of biology. If by chance a naturalist dares to use such an expression, he will always do it within the context of a description of functional phenomena (Bell, 2001, p. 245; West-Eber- hard, 2003, pp. 86, 92), and never within the framework of a (meta- physical) explanation of the rank of such and such a creature in the 'organic scale' of a cosmic order, a concept to which no scientist will attach the slightest rational validity. All in all, the meaning of the division of physiological labour is once more purely and exclusively modal, as emphasized literally by the words 'division of labour.' A given level of division of labour in an organism corresponds to a determined degree of concentration (or localization) of functions, just as a given level of differentiation signifies a determined degree of heterogeneity attained by the structure. There is no longer any trace of the primitive economic sense of the term. One could claim that the division of physiological labour has become a concept which has meaning and interest only for biologists, as the expression no longer evokes the idea, inherited from the economic notion of division of labour, of a causal link between localization of functions and the improvement of the organization. However, its insignificance in today's theoretical practice of naturalists leads us to</page><page sequence="25">THE 'DIVISION OF PHYSIOLOGICAL LABOUR' 27 conclude that the division of physiological labour is no longer a useful concept, even in biology.
