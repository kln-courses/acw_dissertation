<plain_text><page sequence="1">Sixteenth CenturyJournal XXXV/2 (2004) Francisco de Sotomayor and Nascent Urbanism in Sixteenth-Century Madrid Jesu's Escobar Fairfield University This article examines a document in the Spanish National Archive at Simancas, which entails a list of urban reform projects for Madrid in its early years as both court and de facto capital of the Spanish Habsburg monarchy. Herein, the document is dated to 1565 and attributed to Francisco de Sotomayor, a corregidor, or royal governor of the city appointed by Philip II. Sotomayor's report on urban reforms was informed by years of service in Madrid both in government and in the royal works. It is the first surviving example of an effort at concerted town planning in Madrid, and one of the rare examples of such for sixteenth-century Spain in general.This article surveys the contents of the report within the context of evolving principles about Renaissance urbanism and also highlights the importance of pubhc architecture for early modern cities. Sotomayor's report emerges as one of the earliest catalysts for Madrid's remark able transformation from peripheral town to imperial metropolis. IN I56I, MADRID WAS A SECONDARY TOWN OF CASTILE, noted for an established mercantile population and ringed by country retreats used by Spanish royalty during their infrequent visits. Madrid's status, however, was poised to change dra matically in the spring of that year, when Philip II (r. 1556-98) brought the Span ish Habsburg court to the town and set out to establish there a permanent capital. In the following decades, Madrid underwent one of the greatest urban transfor mations ever seen in Europe. From a population of around twelve to sixteen thou sand inhabitants at the time of the court's arrival, Madrid exploded into a metropolis of ninety to ninety-five thousand residents by the end of the century.1 Madrid's remarkable growth demanded an architectural response, and gave rise to one of the first examples of concerted town planning in early modern Spain. Planning for the accommodation of the court and the Spanish Habsburg govern ment was met by providing the basic services necessary for a rapidly expanding *As is the case with other early modern cities, there is no consensus among scholars regarding Madrid's population; see Alfredo Alvar Ezquerra, El nacimiento de una capital europea: Madrid entre 1561 y 1601 (Madrid: Turner y Ayuntamiento de Madrid, 1989), 17-104; and Jos?

As a result, Madrid was shaped over time according to new urbanistic principles developed both locally and abroad.2 In comparison with a city such as Turin, one of the most important of planned European cities in the late sixteenth century, Madrid was not ordered along orthogonal lines.3 Its topography precluded this sort of development. Like Turin, however, Madrid had wide streets, and every effort was taken by its planners to secure pleasant vistas. In the Spanish capital, vistas might be onto prominent monuments, but they could just as likely be to the coun tryside. Such was also the case in Mexico City, the Spanish colonial capital of New Spain built atop the Aztec city of Tenochtitlan. As in Lima, Potosi, or Puebla, all notable colonial cities, Mexico City was laid out after 1521 according to a grid plan following contemporary theory from Europe as well as traditional building prac tices in the Americas.4 Developments in places like Turin and Mexico City were followed closely in Madrid, where one of the most powerful European princes sought to establish a capital for his Monarchia Universalis. The notion of a universal monarchy is one used by Anthony Pagden to denote empire in the early modern period.5 With territorial holdings on three continents, Philip II's Spain in the 1560s was an empire and Madrid its chosen capital.The standard line about Madrid among scholars has been that the city grew beyond Philip's control and in a haphazard manner.6 While it is certainly fruitless to argue that the king had a master plan for his city,7 a careful 2On the topic of urbanism in early modern Spain, see Fernando Marias, "City Planning in Six teenth-Century Spain," in Spanish Cities of the Golden Age: The Views of Anton van den Wyngaerde, ed.

The program survives in manuscript form at the Spanish National Archive at Simancas. Written in 1565 and directed to Philip II, the so called Memoria de las obras de Madrid [Report on the works of Madrid] is herein attributed to the corregidor, or town governor, Francisco de Sotomayor. Sotomayor's proposed reforms suggest that town planning in the early modern period was con cerned with public works as much as, if not more than, monumental architecture. An analysis of the program must therefore consider the role of public architecture in sixteenth-century urbanism.With buildings providing for the public good at the top of planning concerns, Madrid can be viewed as a new kind of capital, symbolic of Habsburg power but also of Habsburg beneficence. As a city of monumental buildings and well-designed public works, Madrid served as a place for the proper functioning of government. As a symbol itself of good government, Madrid played a decisive role in the definition of a baroque capital.9 The climate of building in early modern Madrid fostered a nascent urbanism that would soon have an impact on town design throughout Spain. Moreover, stat utes and laws were developed about cities that would also affect Spanish colonial territories, such as Naples, Lima, or Manila. Notably, young foreign rulers educated in Madrid left the Spanish court with an interest in urbanism. For instance, the future duke,Vespasiano Gonzaga of Mantua, spent the years 1545 to 1548 as page of honor to Prince Philip, who was busily overseeing a new Committee of Royal ronmental Process and Reform in Early Renaissance Rome (Cambridge, MA: MIT Press, 1990), and Manfredo Tafuri, "'Cives esse non licere: Nicol?

Another beneficiary of an education in Madrid was the Austrian Habsburg Arch duke Rudolf, who with his brother Ernst, stayed at the Spanish court for seven years beginning in 1564. Following this period, Rudolf returned to Vienna and then, as Holy Roman Emperor, relocated his capital to Prague in 1583.11 As he undertook a citywide building campaign in the Bohemian city, Rudolf must have called to mind all that he had seen and learned in Madrid. Whether in Turin, Prague, or Madrid, public buildings were of paramount importance in defining the image of a city. Publc architecture is a term often used to describe buildings that serve an array of functions in modern cities, such as town halls or post offices, but the definition sometimes also includes churches and muse ums. For the early modern period, the term is useful to distinguish buildings that served a pubic, and very often municipal, function from the palaces and relgious buildings erected by private and corporate patrons. Pubhc buildings were essential 10On Sabbioneta, see ChiaraTelHni Perina, Sabbioneta (Milan: Electa, 1991), and Kurt W.

A KING, AN ADVISER, AND MADRID Philip II's choice of Madrid as capital has perplexed scholars for decades. Spanish cities like Toledo and Seville, for instance, already ranked among the notable met ropolitan centers of Europe.Without a cathedral or a university, Madrid's appeal as capital seems to have been linked to its natural setting, as can be appreciated in a panoramic view executed around 1562 by the Flemish artist Anton van den Wyn gaerde (fig. 1 above). In the view, Madrid's hinterland vies with the urban fabric for primacy. The town sits perched on a ravine, with medieval walls encircling the older quarters. A monumental royal palace, the Alcazar, stands at the western limit of the town. Its towers are echoed by the verticality of the towers of parish churches, each labeled by the artist. At the foot of the ravine runs the river Guadarrama (today's Manza nares), which serves as a frame for the townscape.The peaks of a looming mountain 12On the importance of public architecture, see Urban Achievement in Early Modern Europe: Golden Ages in Antwerp, Amsterdam and London, ed.

At the bottom left, the Casa del Campo, a royal retreat, stands on the choice hunting grounds in the northwestern vicinity of Madrid. Madrid's favorable setting for recreation certainly contributed to Philip II's decision to settle his court there, but political motivations also abounded. Writing in the early years of the seventeenth century, the chronicler Luis Cabrera de Cor doba employed an anthropomorphic metaphor to explain Philip's choice of a cap ital. Cabrera de Cordoba wrote that the king was disposed to found a great city [that he could] augment over time and through art by means of magnificent buildings, recreations, gardens, and orchards. It was proper that so great a Monarchy should have a city that could perform the duty of the heart, that its principality and seat be in the middle of the body to administer equally its virtues in peace and war to all its States, like those permanent seats of the Roman court, and those of France, England, and Constantinople. 13 Cabrera de Cordoba's words make clear that the effort at Madrid was nothing less than the creation, and expansion, of a capital city in the physical center of the realm. The phrase "over time and through art" summarizes Philip II's approach to Madrid. The art most relevant in the enterprise was, of course, architecture. As prince and then as king, Philip had a great passion for the building arts and a com manding knowledge of contemporary architectural and urban theory. In Madrid, Philip rebuilt the Alcazar, a medieval palace built atop the Muslim alcazaba, or fortress, located at the western extreme of the city. He also realigned streets connecting the Alcazar to the center of Madrid, and was the patron of numerous religious institutions. During his reign, the Paseo de San Jeronimo became a fashionable tree-lined promenade on the eastern limits of the city. Hinting at its lascivious uses, the paseo was labeled by one humanist commentator as a zone for lovers "consecrated byVenus."14 With the reform of city hospitals, the public market, and city squares, Philip's activities were widespread. The effort was enough for the Italian architect Pellegrino Tibaldi, who lived in the city for nearly a decade between 1586 and 1595, to consider Madrid "among the best [cities] of Europe."15 13Luis Cabrera de C?rdoba, Felipe segundo, rey de Espa?a, ed.Jos?

Sotomayor had served as corregidor of Madrid during the young prince's regency in 1551-53.17 The corregidor of a Spanish city or town was appointed by royal charter and served as a voice of the king in the local governments of all Spanish cities and towns of any significance.18 As the holder of this office, Sotomayor served as the chief officer of Madrid's town council, or Ayuntamiento, advocating the pol icies of the monarchy. Surviving documents inform us that Francisco de Sotomayor served at least three years in his first tenure as corregidor and was instrumental in preparing the town for the prince's residency and a visit of the court in 1552.19 In addition to participating in the municipal government, Sotomayor served also as a ranking administrator of the royal works.The Committee of Royal Works, or Real junta de obras y bosques, was established by Holy Roman Emperor CharlesV in 1544 to oversee building projects in Madrid and its hinterland.20 At its inception, the committee was supervised by the emperor's son, Prince Philip. The prince learned about architecture and architectural patronage firsthand, and came to know officials like Sotomayor who were responsible for his works. In 1553, a municipal scribe reports that the "muy magnifico seiior don Francisco de Sotomayor" had named builders to erect the royal stables adjoining the Alcazar, following an order 16For an introduction to the workings of the building trade in Madrid, see Jes?s Escobar, "Archi tects, Masons, and Bureaucrats in the Royal Works of Madrid," Annali di architettura 12 (2000): 91-98; Wilkinson-Zerner, Juan de Herrera, chap. l,"The Making of a Royal Architect"; and idem, "The New Professionalism in the Renaissance," in The Architect: Chapters in the History of the Profession, ed.

Hurtado's letters to the king in the 1560s mention that, among other things, Sotomayor submitted reports on building progress, suggested land pur chases, and requested building materials. With his manifold duties, Sotomayor had become well versed in the economics and administration of urban reform.23 He would bring these skills to municipal government in later years. A native of Salamanca, Sotomayor came from the upper echelons of Spanish society. A power of attorney dated 1565 reveals that Sotomayor had assumed the care of two orphaned noble children and that he employed a servant, both signs of his elevated status.24 Despite the paucity of biographical data on Sotomayor, he was clearly an expert as a supervisor of works and a town planner. The most convincing evidence of his expertise is an unsigned and undated manuscript recording a list of proposals for reforms in Madrid that is the topic of this essay.25 Simply labeled a Memoria de las obras de Madrid, the document was uncovered in the early 1980s and published independently in 1984 by both a French and a Spanish scholar.26 The Memoria has been cited since a number of times, but without a satisfying attribu tion.27 My work with the document reveals that the manuscript was prepared in the first half of 1565 by Francisco de Sotomayor, who was then serving for a second 21See Archivo General de Simancas (hereafter AGS), Casas y Sitios Reales, legajo 247-2 (8 August 1553), cited by Jos?

(31 October 1565). The surname Enriquez suggests a possible Hnk to one of the most influential famiHes in Madrid, but historians of Spain are quick to reaHze the dangers of making these types of assumptions on the basis of surnames alone. Moreover, Sotomayor did not sign regular corre spondence with this surname. 25 AGS, Casas y Sitios Reales, legajo 247-1, no. 257. In what foUows, citations of the text are given in the original Spanish in footnotes. For a lengthy transcription of the portions of the document relevant to pubHc works, see Wilkinson-Zerner, Juan de Herrera, 197-99. 26Gerard, De Castillo a Palacio, 141, attributes the text to a corregidor and dates it between 1562 and 1567. Gerard also suspects the inspiration of the royal architect Juan Bautista de Toledo. Concurring with this thesis, Rivera Blanco, Juan Bautista de Toledo, 328, pubHshing also in 1984, claims Toledo served as "mentor y ide?logo" for the corregidor Antonio de Lugo in drawing up the text of the Memoria between 1564 and 1565. Recently, writing on another topic, Guerrero MayUo, Gobierno Municipal, 28, has indicated that Lugo served as corregidor between 1569 and 1572, that is, after the death of the royal architect. 27Alvar Ezquerra, Nacimiento de una capital, 192-94, offers a summary of the document but doubts its author was a corregidor.

Philip was now king, and Madrid was about to be shaped into a capital. THE REPORT ON THE WORKS OF MADRID Sotomayor's report on the need for urban renewal in Madrid is one of the most remarkable documents in the city's urban history, and is one of the earliest exam ples of unified town planning in Renaissance Spain.28 The reforms he suggests entail the reshaping of an entire city center to meet the demands of demographic growth and the necessity for public amenities. Although Sotomayor died in 1567, all but one of his proposals for public works were completed by the 1580s owing largely to the farsighted policies of later royal officials. Moreover, the comprehen sive nature of the report renders it of primary significance in the history of town planning in early modern Spain, as well as in the history of public architecture for all of Europe. To judge from the opening remarks, it would appear that Sotomayor's report was unsolicited: Considering the benefit and favor that your Majesty has always granted and continues to bestow upon this town in aggrandizing it with works and buildings, I have resolved to submit this report on a number of [projects] which might be undertaken in [Madrid] for the great service of God and of your Majesty, as well as for its civility (policz'a) and embellishment (ornato). [These works stand to] profit residents of the town and its terri tory, as well as the merchants and dealers who bring to it its provisions. In the following chapters, I present details on the facility with which these buildings and other works can be financed.29 Sotomayor's familiarity with Madrid and with the king is clearly evident. Also, notably, the corregidor employs with ease a new vocabulary of aesthetics and pol itics in the realm of urban design. The correspondences between Sotomayor's vocabulary and that which appears in other sources suggests the extent of the new urban theory that was being developed and put into practice at the court in Madrid. The attribution of the Memoria to Sotomayor is clinched by his comments on plans to demolish one of the town's oldest gates, the Puerta de Balnadui: 28Fernando Mar?as, the leading Spanish architectural historian of the early modern period, has maintained that for any period prior to the seventeenth century, one cannot speak effectively of town planning in Spain.

If your Majesty should wish, [Toledo] can deal with [this project] and the town can con tribute to your Majesty a part of its rent surpluses [to finance the work].30 A statement by the royal secretary named above survives in Madrid's municipal archive and confirms Sotomayor's role in the demolition of the city gate in ques tion. The letter, which is dated August 1567, reads as follows: I, Pedro de Hoyo, secretary and member of the Council of your Majesty, certify that your Majesty ordered that, on your behalf, I should inform Francisco de Sotomayor, who was corregidor of this town, that he inform the Ayuntamiento that your Majesty wishes that the gate and tower of Bal nadfu be demolished ... and that the amount spent on this project should be paid for with rent surpluses.31 Pedro de Hoyo's reference to Francisco de Sotomayor in the past tense suggests that the corregidor had died by this date. At the time of his death in 1567, Francisco de Sotomayor had been one of the principal individuals to give shape to the new capital and his legacy would be pro found. In the Memoria, Sotomayor hints at his years of experience in Madrid, as when he mentions that he had discussed "many times" with the king the need to reform the city's hospitals. Although the manuscript is not dated, the Memoria was most likely written in the first half of 1565, inunediately prior to or during Soto mayor's second tenure as corregidor. He assumed the office around 25 May 1565, succeeding the licentiate Ruiz de Villaquir'an, who had an especially troubled tenure and was accused on numerous occasions of wrongdoing by his colleagues in the Ayuntamiento.32 Sotomayor's return to public office might thus be considered as part of Philip II's effort to reestablish order in the local governing body by the appointment of a trusted elder adviser. Lacking details of Sotomayor's biography, a dating of the Memoria must be 30In Madrid, rent surpluses (sobras de rentas) were monies derived from local lands owned by the municipality.

The Tridentine rulings were only formally recognized by Philip II in December 1564, with a plan for their implementation issued by the Council of Castile in January 1565.34 Elsewhere in the Memoria, Sotomayor refers to the archi tect Juan Bautista de Toledo (ca. 1515-67) a number of times, which has led some scholars to believe that Toledo played a key role in drawing up the provisions.35 A native Spaniard,Toledo worked in Rome and Naples before being called to oversee the royal works in Madrid in 1559.36 He was the highest ranking designer in the royal works and would have been familiar with administrators like Sotomayor. In the Memoria, Sotomayor refers to Toledo as the king's servant (criado) and chief builder (obrero mayor), and he certainly seems to have counted on Toledo's partici pation to see his proposals carried forth. Sotomayor notes emphatically that the reforms he proposes for Madrid are aes thetic in nature, but grounded in necessity. He thus exhibits an awareness of con temporary theoretical writings on architecture, such as those writers who followed the tenets laid out by Leon BattistaAlberti in mid-fifteenth-century Italy.37Alberti's writing, which was inspired by the model of the Greco-Roman architect Marco PollioVitruvius, has to be viewed in the context of sixteenth-century Spain, where other theoretical ideas about the city also proliferated. For instance, in the Memoria, Sotomayor freely employs the important concepts of ornato and polici'a, both of which are difficult to translate and deserve some explanation. Ornato can be translated as embellishment, and is a concept that was also used in Renaissance Italy. The word implies the embellishment of visual objects as well as speech, signifying a root for the word in the art of rhetoric.When applied to the 33In a letter dated October 1565, Sotomayor promised to report (to the king?)

AGS, Casas y Sitios Reales, legajo 247-1 also includes an anonymous list of items to discuss with Philip II, including works at Do?a Leonor's monastery, a returned shipment of paintings, and "Sotomayor," the latter being a pos sible reference to the Memoria. ^4See Jos?

Wilkinson-Zerner,_/w?W de Herrera, 151 52, proposes the authorship of another royal architect, Juan de Herrera. This provocative hypothesis is based solely on a statement by Herrera in 1586 that he had been involved in Madrid works since the arrival of the court there. The architect's statement can be found at AHPM, protocolo 421, fol. 269v, as published by Agust?n Bustamante Garc?a, "En torno a Juan de Herrera y la arquitectura," Bolet?n del Semi nario de Estudios de Arte y Arqueolog?a 42 (1976): 228. 36On Toledo's Italian career, see Rivera Blanco, Juan Bautista de Toledo, 67-100. 37See Leon Battista Albert!, On the Art of Building in Ten Books, trans.

For instance, in 1544, when Prince Philip argued the importance of opening a new street from the Alcazar to the center of Madrid, he claimed that "it [serves the] ornato of this town and [it is] a public work."38 The prince and his courtiers would have learned the meaning of ornato from reading Alberti or Vitruvius, but a third source was also at hand. Around 1550, an anonymous author penned an architectural treatise which is labeled De arquitectura and survives in the Spanish National Library in Madrid. The treatise is dedicated to Philip and opens with an argument that architecture is a nec essary, and costly, undertaking for the just ruler.39 Architecture contributes directly to what the anonymous writer labels policta humana. Although the term policia can be related to urban aesthetics, it is more directly evocative of the political mechanisms by which a state of good government can be attained.40 When Sotomayor writes in his Memoria that demolishing a block of unsightly buildings will serve the "ornato and policta" of a city square, policta is equated with a sense of formal order.Yet, when he claims an enlarged bread mart will serve the "good governance and policia" of Madrid, policia is more correctly equated with a notion of social order that is achieved by a well-organized polity. In this sense, policta can be translated as civility. For the anonymous treatise writer's understanding of polici'a, the intended use of a building is an essential consideration when determining its outward appear ance.According to the author, public buildings should exhibit moderation, and rich ornament should be reserved for religious temples. The argument follows Cicero's advice on oration, as filtered by Alberti in his writing on architecture as well as in his influential writing on the family.41 For Alberti, a well-run city could be com pared to a well-run household.Just as the household must be composed of individ uals performing specific duties and responding to a patriarchal head, so, too, the city requires a ruler and an attendant group of supporters. Interestingly, Alberti's city is a gendered city and one whose goal is to maintain a sense of order.42 38AGS, Casas y Sitios Reales, legajo 247-1, fol. 1 (25 July 1544). The term was used in Madrid also in the late 1530s; seeToajas Roger, "De urbanismo y arquitectura," 98. 39On the treatise (Biblioteca Nacional de Madrid, MS 9681), see Fernando Mar?as and Agust?n Bustamante, "Un tratado in?dito de arquitectura de hacia 1550," Bolet?n y Museo del Instituto "Cam?n Aznar" 13 (1983): 41-57; and Catherine Wilkinson, "Planning a Style for the Escorial: An Architectural Treatise for PhiHp II of Spain," Journal of the Society of Architectural Historians 44 (1985): 37-47.

Likewise, the anonymous Spaniard stressed aesthetic matters in his trea tise. But aesthetics were always met with practical and moral concerns.43 The author writes, for instance, that public spaces in a city should be a primary concern for the ruler concerned with his reputation. He uses the example of a city square: People of our day have not taken the care to make plazas of good measure or ornament, unlike the ancients who recognized that [these] spaces are of foremost importance in the city given that they are the most frequented places for the people [of the city] and for foreign [visitors], who tend to report about [our] cities in their homelands. For this reason, it is worth shaping our plazas as the ancients did.44 The author's words suggest a belief that good urban form could reflect a political ideal of civility but also a cultural ideal that was bound in the reputation of a place. Given these concerns, public architecture becomes an important responsibility of the ruler. In the program established by Philip II and his advisers for Madrid, public works and spaces were central. Although the Alc'azar served as the principal archi tectural sign of a royal presence in Madrid, the royal arms on the facade of a munic ipal granary, a court jail, or on fountains throughout the town signaled the beneficence of the king as was the case in other Spanish cities (fig. 2). Yet, arms and regal devices would not be the only distinguishing feature of Madrid's public mon uments. These buildings also came to share a similar style of construction and adornment. The primary characteristic of construction was an intentionally repet itive use of brick, granite, and iron. Adorning elements included walls and towers inspired by Spanish medieval traditions, portals and windows based on the classical vanguard of the Italian Renaissance, and the peculiar roof silhouettes of Burgundian architecture found largely in the Low Countries. The resulting hybrid architecture has been labeled "Austrian," a stylistic label that refers to the origins of the Habs burg dynasty.45 This so-called estilo austriaco served to establish an urban image of in urban culture as well as in urban theory.

In a footnote, Nev?la notes that "a moral subtext can also be detected" in legislation about ornato,but does not offer a full explanation of the theoretical ideas behind the policy. 44An?nimo, De Arquitectura, 291: "Los de nuestro tiempo no an curado de hazer las pla?as con medida ni ornamentos, mas los antiguos ten?an desto mucho cuydado porque el espacio que es cosa m?s adornada y m?s puestas en raz?n de toda la ciudad de ver la que m?s vista del pueblo y do m?s com?n mente acuden los estrangeros, los quales suelen lleuar de la relaci?n de las ciudades a otras tierras estra?as por tanto dirlagen de la forma de las pla?as seg?n los antiguos." 45On the reception of foreign taste in Spanish architectural design and the estilo austr?aco, see Alicia C?mara Mu?oz, Arquitectura y Sociedad en el Siglo de Oro: Idea, traza y edificio (Madrid: El Arquero, 1990), 19-42; Mar?as, El Largo Siglo XVI, 270-452; and Fernando Checa, "El estilo cl?sico, 1564-1599," in Victor Nieto Alcaide, Alfredo Jos?

Baeza, Foutain of Santa Maria, 1560s (Photo: author) Madrid as capital, and has become synonymous with the Habsburg monarchy in Spain. Recognizing the importance of public architecture, Philip began to be appre ciated as a beneficent provider of necessary services to his people, and specifically to the residents of the capital. In a letter ofJanuary 1559, the royal works surveyor Luis Hurtado wrote to the young king, "everyone says this town of Madrid, ennobled with sumptuous and regal buildings, is the one favored by your Majesty, who wishes that no one else leave their mark on nor set foot in its territory." In a telling passage, the official continues, "Now, more than ever, one can boast of Madrid as the gift of your Majesty."46 The ideology of beneficence and grandeur that lay behind a public works program was derived from sixteenth-century political theory and the human ist revival of classical antiquity.47 Augustan Rome would have provided a clear model for Philip II's role as pater urbis of his new capital. Diane Favro's work on the age ofAugustus emphasizes the notion of responsibility as a motivator for an ancient 46AGS, Casas y Sitios Reales, legajo 248, fol. 70 (20 January 1559): "En todas estas dichas obras se pone el cuydado y d?igencia posible para q[ue] con la brevedad q[ue] v[uestra] M[ajesta]d manda se con cluyan....

These ideas would find their way into the writings of Giovanni Botero, a favorite poHtical theorist at the Spanish court. Botero s exposi tion on the grandeur and magnificence of cities first appeared in 1589 as an appendage to a treatise on the reason of state. The text was translated into Spanish four years later as Diez libros de la raz?n de estado, con tres libros de las causas de la grandeza y magnificencia de las ciudades (Madrid, 1593).

The Augustan model was also one followed later in France by Louis XIV, who sought to present his reign as one rivaling the ancient world.49 While Francisco de Sotomayor would have been inspired by contemporary humanist efforts to ennoble architecture and its ability to reflect the deeds of a good ruler, his report also addressed larger matters for a city being reshaped in an era of religious reform. Reflecting the concerns espoused in early modern Catholic the ology, the Memoria opens with what Sotomayor perceived to be Madrid's foremost necessity, and one Philip II would never see realized: the building of a cathedral. Charles V obtained a bull from Pope Leo X in 1518 for a cathedral in Madrid, or at least the amplification of the church of Santa Maria near the Alc'azar, but the project was never realized.50 Sotomayor followed his discussion of the cathedral with two other religious matters, the planning of a seminary for Madrid and the placement of orphaned girls in the so-called Monastery of Doina Leonor, named for an abbess and former tutor of the king.51 Sotomayor next turned to a planned incorporation of the city's hospitals into one building, a project that seems to have occupied the municipality for some time.52 The larger portion of Sotomayor's report is devoted to twenty public works ini tiatives, each of which was intended to improve town provisioning, social services, and housing. For each proposal, Sotomayor is careful to include suggestions for its funding. While he excuses himself for tiring the king with so many details, Soto mayor suggests that Philip appoint "someone with whom I can discuss [these mat ters] in greater detail." Sotomayor does not suggest anyone by name. The omission of the architect Juan Bautista de Toledo is especially notable, hinting at the impor tance of local and royal officials as much as architects in the Madrid building industry. PUBLIC ARCHITECTURE IN MADRID From hospitals to public squares to city walls, the public works proposals presented in the Memoria address a variety of issues. The scope of Sotomayor's project seems to anticipate later reform efforts in locations far beyond Madrid, such as the 48See Diane Favro, The Urban Image of Augustan Rome (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1996), esp. 110-28. 49Peter Burke, The Fabrication of Louis XIV (New HavemYale University Press, 1992), 195-97. 50See Ram?n Mesonero Romanos, El antiguo Madrid: Paseos hist?rico-anecd?ticos por las Calles y Casas de esta Villa (Madrid: Renacimiento, 1861), 34; and Alicia C?mara Mu?oz, "Dos propuestos de catedral para Madrid a comienzos del siglo XVII: Reflexi?n sobre una arquitectura imaginada," in Cinco siglos de arte en Madrid (XV-XX) (Madrid: Alpuerto, 1991), 3:33-39.

The map in figure 3 indicates many of the sites of Sotomayor's proposed interventions, along with the major monuments of his day. Notably, the corregidor offers no consideration of the architectural style desired for new public buildings. By citing the participation of the royal architect, how ever, Sotomayor implies that the buildings would look like other royal works projects. The corregidor's first proposal concerns the completion of what is today the Calle de Segovia. This new street was to begin at the Segovia bridge over the river Guadarrama, lead into the core of the old town, and stop at the Puerta Cerrada, or closed gate. From this point, Sotomayor suggests that "Juan Bautista"-the royal architect Juan Bautista de Toledo-prepare a plan for a second street that would link the Alcazar to the new Calle de Segovia. Sotomayor argues that both streets would facilitate the king's travels into and out of Madrid. As it turned out, these traffic pro posals would be taken up again in later decades for the same purpose. Given a dra matic drop in the topography, the direct route from the western bridge to the Alcazar would not be completed until an iron viaduct was put in place in the nine teenth century. Turning to utilitarian matters, Sotomayor briefly addresses repairs at the Foun tain of the Pear Tree (fuente del peral) and the building of a municipal jail, both to be carried out by Juan Bautista de Toledo. On a matter of public decorum, Soto mayor suggests that the fish market (casa de pescado) be moved from the center of town to its outskirts owing to the bad odors it emitted. Here, Sotomayor reminds the king of the damage the fish market had wrought on the city's water system that fed into the royal gardens adjoining the Alcazar. He recommends relocating the public building next to another structure destined to serve as a slaughterhouse in the southwestern limits of Madrid, where running water was easily accessible.54 The corregidor's suggestions illustrate an evolving sense of spatial organization in the city with an eye toward hygiene as well as decorum. Such concerns would become the basis of a public works committee founded in 1590 by Philip II and a later adviser, the royal judge Agustin Ximenez Ortiz, to address issues of public health and urban policy.55 53See BaUon, Paris of Henri IV. 54On the discussion of moving the casa del pescado, see AVM, Libros de Actas (15-17 November 1564), cited by Alvar, Nacimiento de una capital, 173. Owing to construction difficulties, no building for a fish market and slaughterhouse was undertaken. After the roof of the fish market caved in during a storm in January 1565, the town decided it had to be rebuilt. In an entry for 6 May 1566, Madrid's aldermen were stiU searching for a site. AVM, Libros de Actas (19 September 1565), also cited by Alvar, Nacimiento de una capital, 181, records a decision to repair the slaughterhouse, a "municipal house," and a weigh house with no mention of the fish market. 55On the later committee, known as the junta de polic?a among a variety of other names, see the inaugural study by Francisco I?iguez Almech, "Juan de Herrera y las reformas en el Madrid de FeHpe</page><page sequence="17">Escobar/ Francisco de Sotomayor &amp; Nascent Urbanism in Madrid 373 ,u. c~c, CD~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~cn~~~~~~c m cf)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~c 4D W 4V CDf CD w 4)~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~Z 0- - C/C ui~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~ ~~~ Fig 3.MapofMadid,ca160 Peae yCntod ouetc6 para la Historia de Madrid, Universidad AutnCOmad ard</page><page sequence="18">374 Sixteenth Century Journal XXXV/2 (2004) Sotomayor's concern for decorum and the reputation of Madrid arises again in his comments on the public brothel. For "the good of the republic," Sotomayor argues the necessity of relocating the "house of enamored women" from its current "very public" location to the site of a former slaughterhouse.The corregidor advo cates that "the door and service entry of the [brothel] open to the countryside and not to the town."56 The effort to control established trades, and perhaps also to con trol the movement of women, is notable.57 That a public brothel even receives notice in the Memoria is not surprising. The same institution appears listed in a legend of important sites at the bottom of one of the first printed maps of Madrid from the 1650s.58 Located at the center of Madrid, the Plaza Mayor, or chief city square, was the principal market and ceremonial space in Madrid. Its reshaping began in earnest in the 1580s, and the efforts undertaken at the site mirror the recommendations laid out by Sotomayor in the 1565 Memoria de las obras de Madrid. Of great significance to later reforms in the Plaza Mayor, Sotomayor's recommendations are not limited to the square itself, but extend to its neighboring streets and buildings. He also plants the seeds for a new bread mart that would evolve into the monumental Panaderia that still looms over the northern range of the square (fig. 4). Sotomayor viewed the city square in tandem with the traffic arteries that fed into it and the housing that surrounded it. The notion of an urban ensemble was even expressed by a street cleaner who claimed in 1586 that his duties were to sweep the plaza as well as the streets said to be "in concert" with it.59 While it is possible that a notary inserted these words into the street cleaner's chatty testimony, they suggest again the widespread nature of nascent urban sensibilities in Madrid. In the vicinity of the plaza, Sotomayor first addresses the street that would become Madrid's principal thoroughfare in the Baroque era and through the early II," Revista de la Biblioteca, Archivo, y Museo 19 (1950): 3-108.

Here, Sotomayor saw the potential for a noteworthy street that would link the old town to the expanding residential quarters east and north of the Plaza Mayor. Moreover, reflecting contemporary concerns in urban design, Sotomayor envisioned for the street a "very principal and worthy view." Sotomayor's words again cause one to pause to consider the origins of his thinking about vistas and what one architectural historian has called the "dominion of the eye" in late medi eval urban design.61 Clearly, the Calle Mayor vista was worthy of Madrid, and so the corregidor calls for the demolition of a house that jutted into the street and obstructed the view between the Puerta de Guadalajara, at its western end, and the Puerta del Sol, or sun gate, to the east. Confidently, Sotomayor notes that the 60The Calle Mayor, along with its worthy landmarks, would evolve as a companion piece to the Plaza Mayor.

A number of these residents were vendors of prestige merchandise such as gold and silver, books, and fine cloths. The wealthy citizens also included members of the nobility, for whom living in proximity to the royal palace was a central concern.62 As the built environment of Madrid expanded, a sense of spatial hierarchy emerged in which the older parts of town became reserved for the elite. For instance, in 1565, the town aldermen debated the removal of storage facilities for wheat, barley, and flour from the Plaza de San Salvador, located in the heart of Madrid. It was argued that these public facilities were located too close to the Alcazar, in an area that was intended "for the recreation of the town and court."63 Over time, the principal ceremonial routes of Madrid would link these spaces within the old walls, creating a noble enclave and reinforcing the special status of its residents during public rituals. This seems to be precisely what Sotomayor had in mind. On the public buildings within the Plaza Mayor, Sotomayor offers concrete suggestions for both a municipal meat market and a bread mart which would have significant ramifications in later decades. Moreover, these institutions were impor tant sources of tax revenue for the municipality, and so their planning was given careful attention.64 The principal concern of the meat market was to consolidate a provisionary court facility, located in the Plaza de Santa Cruz, with the municipal establishment housed along the northern limits of the Plaza Mayor. The case illus trates the dual town and court administration that characterized building in the young capital. In this instance, the difference between the two meat markets was one of taxation.Whereas the municipal meat supply was susceptible to all sorts of taxes, the meat market run by the court magistrates was free of such duties. For the magistrates, who were charged with providing an abundant food supply for the court, nothing was easier than to remove the burden of taxation on the goods brought into their "territory." Ironically, the so-called territorio was the same with which Madrid's municipal government had to deal.65 Moreover, the court stood to gain much from the transfer of its meat market to the municipal building. With some expansion of the municipal quarters, the court could also take advantage of the modern scales already in the town's possession. Thus, as a representative of the 62See Gerard, De Castillo a Palacio, 119?53; and idem, "L'Alc?zar de Madrid et son quartier au XVIe si?cle," Coloquio Artes 39 (1978): 36-45.

There were still other benefits to be had. On the meat market, Sotomayor con tinues by outlining the appropriation of the property of Francisco del Prado that adjoined the site chosen for the public building. Here, above the enlarged meat market, "the town can build housing like that which currently exists ... and this at the cost of the owners since the profit will be theirs."66 The demand for housing in a rapidly expanding Madrid was paramount and gave rise to a vertical, multistory type of housing, such as that that would come to line the perimeter of the Plaza Mayor and other new construction. The severity of the situation also explains municipal and court efforts to erect housing wherever possible, including above public buildings. Sotomayor did not miss the opportunity for profit in the construction of public works, but he also advocated for important services related to the town's provisions. The Memoria continues: "Also concerning the ornato of the plaza and the good gov ernment and polici'a of this town it is important that there be a structure where fresh fish can be sold, and that there be a hall where bread can be kept clean and gath ered."67 Sotomayor's further suggestions for a granary (alhondiga) include many of the features that would be incorporated into a later, monumental bread mart, such as scales for wheat and flour. Elsewhere, Sotomayor recommended that the town purchase a small building in which to place weighing devices for the grains. Below the structure, the town could build a much needed silo in one of the cellars, which currently serves as a granary, for wheat and barley ... so that these are protected from rain and sunlight. In another cellar, the town should install horse stables to main tain the beasts that bring provisions to the granary. On the same matter, it is necessary to demolish the existing weigh house for flour in order to make a plaza before the granary so that the carts and beasts of burden might fit in it.68 66"Seria cosa muy nes?esaria en que la v?la ganara porque encima de lo que se acres?entasen las carnicer?as podr?a aver casas de bibienda como lo ay ahora sobre lo que son carnicer?as, y esto a costa de los proprios pues el probecho es para eUos." 67"Ansimismo por lo que toca al hornato de la pla?a y a la buena governa?ion y puH?ia desta V?la, conbiene que aya rred a donde se bendan los pescados frescos y que aya panader?a a donde este el pan Hmpio y rrecogido." 68"e yncorporarse con las d[ic]has troges y comprar una cas?la questa cabo eUa y meter dentro este peso y lo dem?s y el otro questa fuera y encima de los d[ic]hos pesos hazer una troge ques nes?esaria.Y en una de las vaxas que ahora sirben hazer alhondiga para meter dentro el trigo y la cebada y se guarde y de por quenta y rrazon porque ahora no la ay.

[The expansion] is necessary for festivals and would be [beneficial] for the provisions that are brought there for sale, as well as for the ornato and polici'a [of the plaza] because the said houses are old and unsightly (de mal parecer).They are also small and offer little hous ing, so that one stands to lose very little by demolishing them.69 The financing of the projected demolition of the manzana illustrates once more the speculative nature of urban planning in the capital in which the town and res idents would pay for the works, while the court gained an edifying public space: Although the houses [of the manzana] will not obtain the many fruits of the reform [of the plaza] and although the said houses will be expensive owing to their site, the houses behind [the manzana] have everything to gain. To help pay for what this work might cost, the town can contribute a part since it owns two or three houses that are to be demolished. Because the benefit is so great for the houses behind [the manzana] as well as for the entire plaza, all plaza residents can contribute for this most necessary undertaking.70 What precisely would property owners behind the manzana stand to gain? The answer seems to be a view onto the city square. At the time, having a view onto the plaza meant having the potential to collect valuable rents on windows during festivals. Festivals, however, were seasonal or commemorative. On most days of the year, the benefit for residents would be enhanced interior light, and perhaps the view itself. The desirability of a view suggests yet another clue to the permeation of ideas about urban aesthetics in the late-sixteenth-century city. 69"Por muchas vezes sea tratado en esta Villa que unas casas que est?n en la pla?a della q[ue] llaman la man?ana se derribasen para ensanchar la d[ic]ha pla?a, lo qual seria cosa de gran ymportan?ia.Y que dem?s de ser nes?esario para las fiestas lo es para los mantenimientos que se bienen a vender.Y ansimismo para el hornato y puli?ia, porque las d[ic]has casas son biejas y de mal pares?er y de poco hedifi?io y aposento en que se pierde poco de derriballas."The demolition of the manzana was taken up again in 1581 and carried out by 1583. Drawings for the project are conserved in the Biblioteca Francisco de Zab?lburu (carpeta 219, nos. 103-4) in Madrid; they were first published by I?iguez Almech,"Juan de Herrera." The program accompanying the drawings notes that the demolition of the manzana had been originally debated thirty years earlier. Notably, at that time, Sotomayor was serving his first tenure as corregidor. 70"Aunque no se consiguiesen los dem?s frutos de hazerse y aunque las dichas casas costaran mucho por estar en el sitio que est?n, las questan detras d?lias lo ganan todo.Y para ayuda a lo que cos taren la villa podra ayudar con alguna parte e con que ansi mismo tiene alli dos o tres casas de las que se an de derribar.Y pues el beneficio es tan grande ansi para las casas de detras como para toda la pla?a.Y todos los vezinos de la pla?a contribuyan para esta obra por ser tan nes?esaria."</page><page sequence="23">Escobar / Francisco de Sotomayor &amp; Nascent Urbanism in Madrid 379 Considering the subsequent history of reforms in the Plaza Mayor, Soto mayor's foresight is noteworthy. Twenty years after the appearance of his report to Philip II, the king's architects and the municipality's builders were grappling with the same matters in an effort to reform the city square. Their solutions, which follow Sotomayor's recommendations very closely, prove the corregidor's legacy in the shaping of Madrid.71 Turning in the Memoria away from the Plaza Mayor, Sotomayor deals with a number of street reforms in other parts of the capital. He first recommends straight ening the road leading to the extramural monastery of San Jeronimo. This road, over seven hundred meters long, began at the Puerta del Sol and led to the gardens and orchards planted along the eastern outskirts of the town before the important monastery. Here again, Sotomayor argues the importance of a notable vista, recom mending that a few corrals and small houses along the road that obstruct the view of the monastery be demolished. The singularity of the view as a primary concern for city design is reminiscent ofAlberti's theoretical writings on architecture and the city, but also looks forward to Baroque urbanism. Two decades after Sotomayor's Memoria, Sixtus V began to reshape the center and eastern quarters of Rome with straight streets that ended in vistas of prominent monuments.72 Such scenographic streets would become standard in Baroque city design. In the core of the old town, Sotomayor next recommends enlarging the pas sageway between the churches of Santiago and SanJuan to improve the processional route between the Alcazar and the Puerta de Guadalajara.73 This area formed the core of medieval Madrid, and suggests the perceived need to widen its streets and provide it with direct access to the Plaza Mayor and its network of feeder streets. It also returns to the problems of circulation through the city, which Philip had addressed as prince.With the arrival of the court in Madrid, an enhanced ceremo nial calendar demanded changes to the urban fabric. Sotomayor's final five proposals concern Madrid's walls and city gates. Juan Bautista de Toledo is cited again with regard to the suggested demolition of the Puerta de Balnad'u, already discussed above. Apparently, by order of the king, the secretary Pedro de Hoyo ordered Sotomayor to investigate the removal of four other city gates, suggesting that Madrid in the middle of the 1560s was already constrained by its limiting walls. In place of both the Puerta de Balnadfu and the Puerta del Moro, Sotomayor advocates leveling plazas, the cost of which could be paid for by the sale of stone from the demolished structures. Presumably, these new squares would also be beneficial for residents living on their perimeter who would gain views. 71 For an account of the city square within the larger context of the bunding of Madrid, see Esco bar, Plaza Mayor, esp. chaps. 3?5. 72Much has been written on Sixtus V and his reforms in Rome. See the interpretive analysis by Charles Burroughs, "Absolutism and the Rhetoric of Topography: Streets in the Rome of Sixtus V," in Streets: Critical Perspectives on Public Space, ed. Zeynep ?elik, Diane Favro, and Richard IngersoU (Ber keley: University of California Press, 1994), 189-200. 73As noted above, Prince PhiHp ordered such a reform in 1544 during one of his first residencies in Madrid.</page><page sequence="24">380 Sixteenth Century Journal XXXV/2 (2004) As a service to poorly communicated neighborhoods, Sotomayor proposes that the town open three passageways in the "old walls." Pertinent to the future devel opment of the Plaza Mayor, one of these passages was located behind the church of San Miguel de los Otoes and opened to the Cava de San Miguel, a winding street marking the western limits of the city square. The concern to facilitate passage in the area adjoining the Plaza Mayor fits with another project undertaken by the cor regidor in the 1560s. In conjunction with the town council, Sotomayor deter mined limits for the city and sought to divide the city into districts.74 The evidence suggests that Sotomayor developed a consistent sense of urban order that was con ceived spatially. Moreover, it had theoretical and practical applications. Districts would facilitate policing on the practical level, while the imposition of order also offered a semblance of control.The latter notion was especially attractive for a city undergoing rapid expansion. The Memoria de las obras de Madrid ends with suggestions for funding the pro posed reforms. As a means of obtaining building materials, Sotomayor advocates demolishing further portions of the town walls. He also advises sweeping away pri vate property that abutted either side of the walls as dictated by the "laws of these Reigns."75 Exhibiting the insight that could only come with experience in munic ipal government, Sotomayor requests that the municipality be allowed to rent a parcel of land to the residents of the nearby town of Majadahonda in exchange for supplying bread to Madrid. The need for a constant bread supply would haunt the city government in future decades, and would force the court and municipality to build a monumental bread mart in the Plaza Mayor as a distribution center for the vital commodity. The building would also provide the city with a political symbol of the king's beneficence.76 In his final entry of the report, Sotomayor seems to be engaged in a bit of housecleaning, ridding the Ayuntamiento of corruption. The corregidor suggests that Philip II require Juan de Vitoria and a certain Gudiel, both local officials, to pay the town an extra fifth of the value of former municipally owned land they had recently acquired. Elsewhere in the report, Sotomayor criticizes the self-serving interests of aldermen who had delayed the construction of the municipal jail because of its incursion onto property of "friends of theirs." In both of these instances, the role of the corregidor as an advocate of the king's policies and wishes could not be clearer. That they deserved inclusion in this important report alludes 74Francisco I?iguez Almech, "L?mites y ordenanzas de 1567 para la V?la de Madrid," Ayuntamiento de Madrid. Revista de la Biblioteca, Archivo y Museo 34 (1955): 3?37. 75This proposal surely met with resistance from property owners, as similar measures were st?l contested in the early years of the seventeenth century. See, for example, AVM, Secretar?a, legajo 1-203 9 (1609), a lawsuit of Diego P?rez against Madrid for attempting to take his property along the Cava Baja de San Francisco. Perez's lawyer wrote: "Those waUs and enclosures along which the laws of these Reigns prohibit bu?ding are those that encircle frontier cities and towns, and not those that are located in the interior of Castile as is the town of Madrid and the city of Toledo." 76On the crisis of 1590 and its architectural response, see Catherine W?kinson-Zerner, "Madrid in 1590-91," Kritische Berichte: Zeitschrift f?r Kunst und Kulturwissenschaften 1 (1992): 93-105.</page><page sequence="25">Escobar / Francisco de Sotomayor &amp; Nascent Urbanism in Madrid 381 to the panoptic eye of the corregidor, both royal and municipal officer, and his sense of responsibility that came with the office. SOTOMAYOR'S LEGACY IN MADRID To see the proposals in his Memoria carried out, Francisco de Sotomayor had antic ipated the participation of architects and builders associated with the Committee of Royal Works, and particularly its chief designer, Juan Bautista de Toledo. Toledo's death in May 1567, and Sotomayor's passing months later resulted in the delayed execution of many of the corregidor's recommendations. Also contribut ing to the delay was the construction of Philip II's monastery and palace complex of El Escorial. Under the direction of the architect Juan de Herrera following the death of Toledo, building at El Escorial advanced with great speed owing to changes in building practice and technological innovations. This level of efficiency was desired for Madrid, but the realization of Sotomayor's vision for the capital would have to wait.77 Only as El Escorial neared completion in the early 1580s were major undertakings like the reform of the Plaza Mayor begun in earnest. Efficiency was an ideal realized at El Escorial, one of the singular instances of building along the lines of treatises about ideal cities that proliferated in the early modern period.78 The concept of the ideal city receives considerable attention among scholars, although the realities of urban life render these places among the rarest in the history of architecture. When they were actually built, as was the case of Sabbioneta, they were little populated and often did not thrive for very long periods of time, if at all. Sotomayor's Memoria suggests that plans existed for the shaping of Madrid as capital from the start, but the text also reveals a practicality that must be weighed against contemporary urban theory. Whereas the goals of ornato leaned toward an expression of the ideal city, those of polici'a sought to realize a well-ordered place that could exist and was capable of being controlled by laws. Madrid was built atop an older city, an agglomeration of medieval neighbor hoods that had surpassed the limits of an original, ninth-century Muslim outpost. Indeed, Madrid was not an ideal place, but its building embodied the goals of effi ciency put forth in humanist visions of an ideal world such as Thomas More's description of Utopia, or "Noplace."79 Wide streets, abundant fountains, and public 77 Agust?n Bustamante Garc?a, La arquitectura clasic?sta del foco vallisoletano (1561?1640) (Valladolid: Instituci?n Cultural Simancas, 1983), argues that a model of efficiency could also be found in the rebuilding of Valladolid after a devastating fire in 1561. On the organization of labor and new techno logical innovations at El Escorial, see Jos? Luis Cano de Gadoqui y Garc?a, La construcci?n del Monasterio de El Escorial: Historia de una empresa arquitect?nica (Valladolid: Universidad de Valladolid, 1994); Wilkin son-Zerner, Jm?jh de Herrera, 14-26, and 46?62; and George Kubler, Building the Escorial (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1982). 78For this tradition of thought, see Ruth Eaton, Ideal Cities: Utopianism and the Built Environment (Antwerp: Mercatorfonds, 2001); idem, "The City as an Intellectual Exercise," in Utopia: The Search for the Ideal Society in the Western World, ed.

Paul Turner (Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1965).</page><page sequence="26">382 Sixteenth Century Journal XXXV/2 (2004) architecture would serve this end, and yet there was more. Sotomayor's recurring references to the pleasures of the eye-as in the use of the term ornato or the fre quent mention of urban vistas-suggests that the corregidor's aim was to balance the aesthetic and the practical. Madrid can be viewed as a reasoned version of More's Utopia, an actual Someplace. Adorned with buildings in a recognizably Spanish Habsburg style and serving all sorts of functions, public, civic, and other wise, Madrid took on the image of a capital. It remains to be asked if Philip II actually read the Memoria de las obras de Madrid. As mentioned above, Sotomayor's opening paragraph suggests that his report was unsolicited. This, however, may be a literary device, just as More opens his Utopia with a nonchalant, and humorous, letter about the attempt to write what the reader should take to be a draft of a text rather than the important work that it is. Composed in the bureaucratic language of sixteenth-century Spain, Sotomayor's Memoria is no literary achievement, but it was filed away for safekeeping among the papers of the royal works. Moreover, both the even handwriting of the text and the lack of a signature suggest that the surviving text is perhaps a copy of an original document, long since worn by constant use and reference. The building history of Madrid after 1565 suggests rather strongly that the king, or one of his chief advisers, did indeed read the Memoria. Each of Sotomayor's recommendations for urban reforms was eventually executed in the decades after Madrid's selection as capital, with two exceptions: the approach from the Alc'azar to the Segovia bridge, and the construction of a cathedral, which was not begun until the eighteenth century. When Philip established a committee devoted exclusively to public works and urban policy in 1590, that group's first effort was to draw up a report very much in the manner of Sotomayor's Memoria. As with Sotomayor's project, the new committee's recommendations focused on street reforms and public buildings that would enhance the appearance of Madrid as a stage for the ceremonial life of the capital. The later committee has received considerable attention from scholars, which may help explain the oversight of Francisco de Sotomayor's role in the shaping of Madrid. The recovery of the Memoria de las obras de Madrid and the identification of its author offer valuable clues in the still uncharted history of Madrid's early modern transformation.</page></plain_text>
