<plain_text><page sequence="1">2 Language Development FRANCIS J. DI VESTA and DAVID S. PALERMO* The Pennsylvania State University Human language is a remarkable accomplishment, particularly when viewed from the standpoint of regularity in development. Educators and psychologists traditionally have been mainly concerned with descriptions of linguistic categories and investigation of the content of language. Recently a revitalization of research in the area of language and cognitive processing has been stimulated by the influence of philosophers of science (Kuhn, 1970), linguists (N. Chomsky, 1965), and developmental psychologists such as Piaget (see Elkind &amp; Flavell, 1969). A concern for what it is that one learns in acquisition of language and what it is that one does in the use of it is apparent, as is concern for how language development is influenced by the interaction between innate (given) mental capabilities, maturational processes, and environmental encounters. In general, attention has been redirected to creativity and innovation as characteristics of human mental activity, as opposed to earlier mechanistic views which emphasized input- output relations in studying the control and prediction of human behavior. The study of language embraces a variety of issues, including the compe- tence-performance distinction, the relation between language and thought, the invariant properties of language (linguistic universals), the relation of base structures to surface structures, and the psychological reality of the hypothesized properties of language. Current sensitivity to these issues is reflected in the awakened research interest in such areas as learning of con- nected discourse, comprehension, and organization in memory, as well as the application of psycholinguistics to bilingual education, education of the JOHN B.

The view of language as a symbol system comprising much of the basis of education and of human thinking is making new demands on both the researcher in the language area and the educator wishing to apply whatever new insights are available. Both must know the characteristics of language and its development, how we arrived at our present understandings about language, how current approaches differ from earlier research views of verbal learning and structural lin- guistics, and how language can be applied to education. This chapter is in- tended to provide a perspective on, introduction to, and review of what we consider to be the important literature related to these matters. I. HISTORICAL OVERVIEW Early Orientations to the Study of Language The study of language development dates back at least to the times of King Psammetichus of Egypt, who isolated two infants in order to deter- mine from their first utterances the original language of man. The more recent history of the study of language acquisition began with biographies of young children, like most other aspects of child behavior. Detailed studies of a biographical nature form a continuous thread throughout the history of research on language acquisition and continue to be valuable in the current literature. Observations of individual subjects have been the basis of general observations on the development in English of the semantic system (Taine, 1877; Nice, 1915), syntactic development (Moore, 1896; Bateman, 1914), and phonological development (Velten, 1943; Burling, 1959). Language development in languages other than English (Gregoire, 1937; Chao, 1951), in bilingual children (Leopold, 1939-1949) and even in chimpanzees (Kellogg &amp; Kellogg, 1933; Gardner &amp; Gardner, 1969; Premack, 197 la, 197 lb), has also been studied on this basis. Standard criticisms of baby biographies apply to some of these reports. In addition, the early studies of language acquisition, in particular, often suffered from the observer's lack of understanding of linguistics. Research in this area requires some minimal knowledge of linguistics, that is, it is es- sential to understand the structure of the language in order to study the na- ture of its development. Early Descriptive Studies of Language Development During the 1920s and through the 1940s researchers became more ob- jective in their description of language development. In a large number of reports the primary concern was on describing the naturally occurring de- velopmental patterns of language as a function of age, sex, and sociological variables. The classic series of studies by O. C. Irwin on vocal development, such</page><page sequence="3">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 57 as Chen &amp; Irwin (1946), is a typical example of the research of this time. Irwin pointed out the methodological inadequacies of previous develop- mental studies--small sample size, unsystematic observations, lack of relia- bility estimates on the observers, failure to use standard recording procedures, minimal statistical analyses, and unwarranted interpretations of the observations (Irwin, 1941; Irwin &amp; Chen, 1943). After satisfying himself that the use of the International Phonetic Alphabet would allow re- liable recording of infants' vocal development (Irwin &amp; Chen, 1941), Irwin embarked upon a longitudinal study of 95 infants in which he studied the development of vocalizations from 1 to 30 months of age. The earliest sounds made by the infant before actual language were found to be primarily vowels, first those made in the front and middle of the vocal tract, followed by the development of back vowels. The consonants, most frequently found in adult speech, are not used as frequently as vowels until the child is about one year of age. During the babbling period consonants appear in the reverse order of that for vowels, or from back to front of the vocal tract. In the same tradition, Templin (1957), in a cross-sectional study of a carefully selected sample of 480 children three to eight years of age, investigated the development of articulation, speech sound discrimi- nation, syntax and vocabulary, as well as the interrelations among these aspects of language development. Her results indicated that: 1. The speech sound production, so clearly incomplete by two and one half years in the Irwin studies, reaches essential maturity by age eight. She thereby confirmed the developmental characteristics of articulation found in studies conducted 20 years earlier. 2. While there is an increase in complexity of the syntactical structure of ut- terances during this period, the language of children., even at three years of age, functions in a manner similar to the language of adults. 3. In contrast to articulatory and syntactic development, vocabulary growth showed no evidence of slowing down during this age period. As with the measures of syntax, vocabulary development seemed to be ahead of that of the children measured two decades earlier. 4. The intercorrelations among these various measures were relatively high, particularly at the younger age levels. McCarthy (1954) has summarized a number of less extensive develop- mental studies that provide normative data about the characteristic lan- guage behavior of the child at various age levels, including the average ages at which cooing, babbling, and the first word occur; the average length of sentences at each age level; the frequency with which pronouns are used at different ages; the mean rate of speaking as a function of age; the average number of questions asked, and so on. This research indicates that in- dividual-difference variables and a number of gross environmental vari-</page><page sequence="4">58 Review of Research in Education, 2 ables are related to language development. For example, girls tend to be advanced relative to boys on many measures of language development; children from high socioeconomic families develop language more rapidly than those from low socioeconomic families; the language of only children develops more rapidly, and twin children more slowly, than others; and the amount of verbal stimulation in the school and home affects the rate of lan- guage development. While these studies were concerned with the representativeness of the sample and the reliability of the measures used, they failed to focus on ex- perimental tests of hypotheses regarding the observed developmental trends. They were a valuable beginning from which inductive general- izations about children's development were advanced, but no attempt was made to determine the functional relationships between relevant indepen- dent variables and language behaviors. In general, the basic orientation of research during this period was descriptive; theory construction was left to others. The Verbal Learning Tradition In the 1950s experimentally oriented research concerned with children's language development turned to an exploration of the function of words in affecting performance in various learning tasks. The assumption was that language is basic to the cognitive processes, or thought, and therefore should have an important effect on all learning. Considerable effort was devoted to the investigation of acquired distinctiveness and acquired equiv- alence of cues. The theoretical motivation for these studies came from the Hullian notion of secondary generalization (Hull, 1939), as expanded by Dollard and Miller (1950). In the case of acquired distinctiveness, the basic idea was that attaching distinctive verbal labels to physical stimuli which were similar would make the subsequent pattern of response-produced stimuli associated with the verbal label, along with the actual physical stimulus, more distinctive than the physical stimulus alone. The resultant decrease in generalization of habit tendencies to the two stimulus patterns would allow subsequent learning of new responses to those physical stimuli to proceed more rapidly (Norcross, 1958). The acquired equivalence of cues hypothesis follows the same theoretical lines of reasoning. It is argued that attaching the same or similar names to physically distinctive stimuli leads to an increased tendency for a response learned to one stimulus to generalize to the other. The Birge (1941), Jeffrey (1953) and Shepard (1956) studies are examples of research which has been interpreted as sup- port for this theoretical hypothesis. A large number of other studies grew out of this general theoretical framework as an extension of the acquired distinctiveness and equivalence hypotheses. It was reasoned that since a response could produce stimuli, it</page><page sequence="5">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 59 should follow that other responses to those stimuli in other situations could be learned. Thus any number of relatively more complicated learning situa- tions could be accounted for in terms of responses learned to mediators consisting of an overt or covert verbal response and the stimuli associated with that verbal response. This particular area of research became of con- siderable interest when it was discovered that children below some critical age, variously set between five and seven years, were obviously able to talk but did not seem to use the available language to mediate responses, while children above that age did seem to do so. Research along these lines was stimulated by the finding of Kuenne (1946) that transposition behavior of children correlated rather markedly with mental age. Children with mental ages above five years transposed nearly 100 percent on both near and far tests for transposition, while those below five showed considerably less transposition on the far test. The results evidenced by those subjects who transposed on the far test were at- tributed to language mediators when it was shown that subjects who verbalized the size relations of the stimuli were those who showed a high probability of transposing on the far test. In general, the results of the Kuenne study indicated that the transposition of the younger, nonverbal children was similar to that of lower animals (Spence, 1942), while that of the older, more verbal children required additional theoretical elaboration. The Kendlers have extended the study of the effects of verbal mediators to the reversal and nonreversal shift discrimination problem (Kendler &amp; Kendler, 1962). Reese (1962) and White (1965) have reviewed the litera- ture on the problem of what Reese has called the "mediational deficiency" of young children in a variety of tasks. More recently Flavell (1970) has argued that children are not mediationally deficient in such learning tasks, but rather deficient in producing mediators at the appropriate occasions. Flavell's production deficiency hypothesis shifts the orientation to the problem from determining why children don't use mediators which they have available to determining the strategies-verbal and nonverbal- which children do use when faced with a learning or memory task. Attempts to Relate Verbal Mediation to Language. During the fifties and sixties experimental child psychologists employed rigorous methodol- ogical control in attempts to establish lawful relationships between in- dependent and dependent variables. Their interest, however, was primarily with the mechanisms of learning and only secondarily, if at all, with lan- guage. Since their research had so little to do with language, the researchers in this group paid little attention to linguistics. Nevertheless, many investigators interested in word association and verbal mediation considered the results of their research in terms of under- standing language acquisition and function (Ervin, 1961; McNeill, 1963). Brown and Berko's study (1960) was an especially notable attempt in this</page><page sequence="6">60 Review of Research in Education, 2 respect. They constructed a word association test of 36 words comprised of an equal number of count nouns, mass nouns, adjectives, transitive verbs, intransitive verbs, and adverbs. A Word Usage Test comprised of 12 non- sense words embedded in sentences, such that two nonsense words represented the six parts of speech in different sentences, was also con- structed. For example, the subject might be asked, "Do you know what it means to nare? This is a picture of a little boy who wants to nare." The subject was then asked to make up a sentence using the word nare. In this case, he would be scored correct if he used nare as an intransitive verb. Children from the first, second, and third grades, as well as a group of adults, were given both tests. The results provided evidence of develop- mental trends toward paradigmatic (i.e., same-form class, such as tall/short) responding in all of the grammatical categories of the association test, as well as correct grammatical use of the nonsense words in the usage test. Most important to the present discussion, however, were the rank order correlations (r = .46 to .94) between performance on the two tests. Thus the characteristics of word associations were found to be closely related to the development of the child's ability to recognize and use new words in appropriate syntactic relationships. Investigators in verbal learning have also attempted to extend their research in mediation to thinking (and therefore language) by experi- mentally examining the means by which ideas become associated (Horton &amp; Kjeldergaard, 1961, p. 1). Within this context, strong support has been obtained with adult subjects for three basic paradigms: the A-B, B-C, A-C chaining paradigm; the A-B, C-B, A-C stimulus equivalence paradigm; and the B-A, B-C, A-C response equivalence paradigm. Basically the procedure consisted of Ss learning, in a paired-associates task, A-B pairs of words followed by B-C pairs, after which it could be demonstrated that prior A- B, B-C learning facilitated learning a third list composed of A-C pairs. Despite the voluminous literature on mediation with adults, the experi- ments with children are more impressive, since the effects are not limited to the early trials of the transfer task, as is typically the case in the adult studies. Among the first studies with children was an investigation of the A- B, B-C, A-C chaining paradigm with kindergarten and first-grade children (Norcross &amp; Spiker, 1958), which resulted in clear support for mediation in learning the A-C list. Several other studies have provided similar results with the chaining paradigm (Berkson &amp; Cantor, 1960; Clifton, 1966; Nikkel &amp; Palermo, 1965; Wismer &amp; Lipsitt, 1964; Wu &amp; Lipsitt, 1965). Most used older grade-school children as subjects, although Berkson and Cantor demonstrated mediation effects using retarded subjects. The Nikkel and Palermo experiment assumed the first list associations from word asso- ciation norms and used only a two-list design. Evidence of mediation using the B-C, A-B, A-C chaining paradigm has also been demonstrated (Nikkel &amp; Palermo, 1965; Odom, 1965; Rieber, 1964). Experimental support for</page><page sequence="7">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 61 the stimulus equivalence and response equivalence paradigms, while not as extensive, has been demonstrated in a number of experiments (Palermo, 1962, 1966; Shapiro &amp; Palermo, 1968). The mediation design has also been used to demonstrate the development of attitudes and preferences (Di Vesta, 1962; Eisman, 1955). Critique Of The Verbal Learning Approach To Studying Lan- guage. The underlying assumption that research on verbal learning is ger- mane to language was made explicit in Jenkins and Palermo's attempt to account for the acquisition of syntax by children via mediation theory (Jenkins &amp; Palermo, 1964; Palermo, 197 la, 197 Ic). They argued that sen- tential sequencing involved the chaining paradigm and that grammatical classes are gradually differentiated through stimulus and response equiva- lence; further, words used in the same syntactic positions tend to form equivalences. Once these equivalences are formed, new sentences can be generated by substituting words of the same form class within a given syn- tactic position. Thus, new sentences can be devised through mediation by chaining. While some critics have argued strongly that verbal learning studies and related theory are inadequate in principle to explain language (N. Chomsky, 1959; Fodor, 1965; McNeill, 197 1), the primary criticism has been that researchers and theorists in the verbal-learning tradition have failed to consider the characteristics of the language they sought to explain. As will become clear in the subsequent section, they were naive with re- spect to linguistics, knowledge of which is essential for those who wish to relate their work directly to language behavior rather than limiting research and theory to the effects of words in relatively restricted contexts. II. THE CURRENT PSYCHOLINGUISTIC POSITION The brief review above of the earlier research positions concerned with language behavior has been sketchy and fails to do justice to many who have contributed to the field but, hopefully, it has familiarized the reader with some of the historical trends which have preceded the reappearance of the specialty known as developmental psycholinguistics. While psycholin- guistics is a new term to the present generation of researchers, it is histori- cally as old as the laboratory study of psychology. Wundt, for example, wrote a great deal on the topic (see Blumenthal, 1970). However, it is now apparent that the rise of behaviorism was associated with the fall of earlier efforts in the study of language. Recently, linguistics has had a renewed influence upon psychology through N. Chomsky's (1957) book entitled Syntactic Structures, which precipitated a scientific revolution within the field of linguistics and is manifested in psychology by psycholinguistics. Descriptive Linguistics Prior to the publication of Chomsky's first book, the science of lin-</page><page sequence="8">62 Review of Research in Education, 2 guistics in this country had been dominated by the writings and methodol- ogy of Bloomfield (1933), a strong behaviorist. His endorsement of em- piricism, with emphasis upon a descriptive fact-collecting approach, was viewed as scientifically exact and unprejudiced by theory. The assumption was that appropriate inductive generalizations would emerge from descrip- tive data, once enough of it became available. Bloomfield's approach to linguistics ran into difficulties, however, because it was unable to handle many interesting problems of language. For example, within the Bloomfieldian tradition, it was assumed by Fries (1952) that it would be possible to define grammatical classes by showing that the words of a class would fit into a slot within a standard defining sen- tence frame. The technique failed, however, because one must necessarily know something about the grammatical structure of the sentence in ad- vance in order to know whether a particular constituent will fit in the frame. For example, the slot in the frame was good, used to define a noun, can be filled by The concert but also by He was bad or he. These two parts of sentences are clearly not comparable, although both form perfectly grammatical sentences. A related problem which poses difficulties arises in connection with am- biguous sentences. Consider the sentence, They were fascinating girls. It is ambiguous because the slot filled by the word "fascinating" can serve dif- ferent grammatical functions in this context; it may used to define a verb or an adjective, depending upon the meaning of the sentence. Only by recog- nizing the two underlying structures can the sentence be disambiguated. Phrase Structure Grammar Some linguists attempted to avoid the difficulties of the substitution-in- frames analysis of sentences by postulating a hierarchical analysis known as phrase structure or constituent structure analysis. This type of analysis shows that a sentence is composed of phrases or constituents which are fur- ther composed of other constituents, all of which are related to one another in a hierarchical fashion. The relationships of the constituents can be represented by tree diagrams or by the use of brackets. To illustrate, there are two structures for the example sentence discussed above; one structure relates "fascinating" more closely to "were" in one interpretation and to "girls" in the other interpretation. They may be distinguished by the fol- lowing bracketing for the constituents: ((They) ((were fascinating) (girls))). ((They) ((were) (fascinating girls))). While introducing the phrase structure analysis solved some kinds of problems, it left others unsolved. The sentence, He was killed by the falling bridge, does not have two different phrase structures to differentiate the two meanings which any native speaker of the language can recognize, one</page><page sequence="9">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 63 describing where he was killed and the other how he was killed. Putting different labels on parts of the phrase structure description might help, but even that will not solve the problem posed by a sentence such as Bill likes Jill more than Will, wherein the ambiguity results from the lack of an overt manifestation of parts of the sentence which would disambiguate the sen- tence. There are still other problems with a phrase structure grammar. It cannot express the relation between the following two sentences: I called the girl up. I called up the girl. The sentences are clearly related, but the phrase structure analyses of the two sentences are quite different. Note also that one can say I called her up but not I called up her. Phrase structure grammar does not allow for showing the relation between a sentence and the paraphrase of a sentence or between two paraphrases of a sentence. Finally, there is no way for phrase structure grammars to handle the problem of the difference between these sentences: John is easy to please. John is eager to please. Both have the same phrase structure, but John is the logical subject of the sentence in one case and the logical object of the sentence in the other, a point which is clear as soon as you attempt to paraphrase the sentences. Transformational Grammar The type of science which Bloomfield outlined for the field of linguistics seems inadequate to account for many aspects which are intuitively clear to any native speaker of a language. Most English teachers have encountered such problems in teaching students how to diagram sentences. The lan- guage user seems to know more about his language than the descriptive lin- guist, restricted by the type of acceptable scientific procedures allowed by Bloomfield's prescription, has been able to capture. Chomsky's contribu- tion in Syntactic Structures was to note some of the inadequacies of the Bloomfieldian approach and, more importantly, to offer a solution in the form of transformational generative grammar. The Competence-Performance Distinction. The goal of linguistics, ac- cording to Chomsky, is to construct a theory of language, that is, to con- struct a grammar made up of a finite set of rules capable of generating all of the infinite set of grammatically correct utterances possible in any lan- guage and none of the grammatically incorrect ones. Especially important to developmental psycholinguistics was the assumption that such a set of rules would describe the knowledge that a native speaker of a language has about his language. This knowledge is referred to as the linguistic compe- tence of the language user. Put another way, the competence of a language</page><page sequence="10">64 Review of Research in Education, 2 user is the set of rules which allow the user to speak and understand the language by relating the sound system to the meaning system, that is, the phonetic representation to the semantic representation. Competence is one of the factors which underlies performance; it is an abstraction which describes a part of the mental equipment of the language user. It is in this sense that linguistics is mentalistic. It attempts to discover "a mental reality underlying actual behavior [N. Chomsky, 1965, p. 4]." Performance, of course, is the actual behavior which may be affected by any number of other variables and from which competence is inferred. Thus a clear dis- tinction is made between competence and performance, or between the knowledge in the mind and the overt behavior. The overt behavior may be influenced by all kinds of factors, including such things as memory, fatigue, distraction, and a host of other variables. In order to understand perform- ance, however, it is clear that the structure of competence, the underlying rule system or grammar, must be understood. In this sense, linguistics is a part of psychology. The grammar of a language, according to N. Chomsky (1965), consists of a tripartite system of rules about semantics, syntax, and phonology. The syntactic component relates the deep structure of the semantic component to the surface structure of the phonological component. Thus the semantic component consists of the rules pertaining to the underlying meaning to be expressed, and the syntactic component consists of the rules for converting the deep structure to a surface structure form which can be interpreted by the phonological rules. There are, therefore, rules for interpreting meaning, rules for interpreting sounds and rules for pairing the appropriate meaning with the appropriate sounds. Chomsky's formulations have been criticized with respect to the relations between semantics and syntax at the un- derlying or deep-structure level by Ross (1967), Fillmore (1968), and Mc- Cawley (1968a, 1968b) among others, but the same basic approach to the analysis of language is now generally agreed upon by most modern linguists (Lyons, 1968). Language Universals. The rationalist aspect of Chomsky's approach was influenced by the work of Descartes. The modern concern is with the assumption that mental processes are determined by the nature of the orga- nism. Applied specifically to language, Chomsky argues that all the 3,000 or more languages have a common or universal core. The general form and even some of the substantive features of the grammar for particular lan- guages overlap with those of all other languages, that is, they are deter- mined by the nature of the mental structures and processing which charac- terize man and which are manifested in substantive and formal universal aspects of language. The substantive universals refer to the nature of the phonological, syntactic, and semantic units of which language is composed. Formal universals refer to the form of the rules which will appear in the</page><page sequence="11">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 65 grammar. Transformational rules, for example, may be required to handle the syntactic component of the grammar satisfactorily. The notion of language universals is particularly important to those interested in going beyond linguistics per se to the study of language per- formance because it is directly related to the processes of language acquisi- tion. It suggests that the child is constrained in certain ways by his biologi- cal constitution, which causes language input to be treated in a limited number of ways in formulating the grammar which is correct for the lan- guage being acquired. Relative to the infinite output possible in any lan- guage, the child receives a small sample of language from those who speak to him. These data appear to be treated at the phonological, syntactic, and semantic levels in a restricted manner; the hypotheses about the input are limited, and the specific grammar appropriate to the child's language is de- termined from the fragmentary sample he receives. Only a small amount of environmental support is required to permit the child to select the correct grammar for his language community and thus be able to generate and comprehend utterances which are unique to him, or to know or be creative with the language. It should be noted, however, that the study of language acquisition involves the question of how the linguistic competence is brought into play, or how a grammar is selected from among the many pos- sible grammars, as well as how performance can be related to that compe- tence and to the large number of other factors which may affect it. Language and Thought The issue of the relationship between language and thought has captured the interest of philosophers, educators, and psychologists for at least a cen- tury. (See Vygotsky, 1962, for a useful summary.) While it cannot be con- sidered as exclusively within the domain of the psycholinguist, this issue clearly has received renewed emphasis with the emergence of interest in that domain, particularly in the area of developmental psycholinguistics, as illustrated by the works of Sinclair-de-Zwart (19691) and Slobin (1971), among others cited in this section. Three perspectives related to this issue can be differentiated: (1) language precedes thought, (2) language and thought are inseparable, and (3) thought precedes language (Jenkins, 1969). The review of the literature from these points of view indicates that each has unique implications for research on language development and for the interpretation of the research conducted within it. Language Precedes Thought. Vygotsky (1962) elaborated on Pavlov's distinction between the first- and second-signal systems in a series of studies oriented around the view that "the use of the sign, or word, is the means by which we direct our mental operations, control their course, and channel them toward solution of the problem confronting us [p. 58]." Luria (1959, 1961), one of Vygotsky's collaborators, concluded that the</page><page sequence="12">66 Review of Research in Education, 2 directive role of words develops through a series of stages during the preschool years. Initially, specific words control orientation to objects or actions by more or less reflexive behavioral tendencies. Second, words syn- thesized into sentence units limit (direct) behavior through activation but not inhibition of behavior. In the third phase, commands or instructions from an external source control behavior through both activation and inhibition. Finally, words acquire self-regulatory functions. A similar posi- tion was taken in a series of studies by Bruner, Olver &amp; Greenfield et al. (1966). While these views suggest that thought is based on the word, it is also apparent that propositional relationships are involved. Furthermore, each of the investigations suggests the relevance of early experience as prerequisites to the formation of symbolic representation, even when they agree with the view expressed by Miller and Chomsky (1963) that "sen- tences have a compelling power to control both thought and action [p. 488] ." Language as a determinant of cognition is explicitly stated in the Whorf- Sapir Weltanschuung hypothesis (Carroll, 1956), in which the world view perceptions, notions of causality, and cognitions of a member of a language community) is said to be a direct function of the language codes available to the community. Carroll and Casagrande (1958) provided partial confir- mation of this hypothesis in a developmental study with Navaho children. Nevertheless, the influence of cultural differences in language on behavior was found to be eliminated with very little experience. The linguistic rela- tivity hypothesis, in the form which places the burden of thought processes on lexical coding, can be modified considerably, even within a given lan- guage community, by the cognitive domain and the cultural context in which the codes occur (Bruner et al., 1966; Lenneberg, 1967). Language and Thought Are Inseparable. The behaviorist position sug- gests that thought and language are only different representations of behav- ior (Watson, 1925; Skinner, 1957; Staats, 1971). In a functional analysis of behavior it becomes necessary to study the categories of language ac- cording to function, the conditions under which language behavior is produced, and the way language functions in adjustment. Thus speech is controlled by environmental stimuli, drive stimuli, and printed and verbal stimuli, and all are learned by conditioning through thousands of learning trials. Verbal stimuli elicit physiological and- affective responses which, in turn, have stimulus characteristics that elicit speech responses. Some char- acteristics are acquired through classical conditioning where, for example, the emotional meaning of one word is transferred to another through asso- ciation and provides the basis for the acquisition of discriminative control- ling value. Larger repertoires of verbal patterns are acquired by chaining to form sequences in speech, listening, or reading which then control motor</page><page sequence="13">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 67 responses. The formation of these larger repertoires is dependent on imita- tion, matching to a source, and reward contingencies. The apparent regularity of the stages of language development suggests they are behaviors to be analyzed in terms of their respective functions. Privileges of occurrence, pivot-open class constructions, regularizations of irregular verb forms, inflections, negations, and the like are explained in terms of one or more S-R learning principles, including elementary condi- tioning principles, mediation, and habit family hierarchies. These learning principles are applied, in general fashion, at all developmental levels. Within this framework, thinking is transformed conceptually into behav- ioral chains or patterns. Staats (1971) notes that "Reasoning involves lan- guage as a primary determinant. Much of what we call intelligence... involves, or is [italics ours], language.... The study of language develop- ment in children must be concerned with circumstances that produce ab- normal language, or a deficit in language, as well as with normal language development [112-113]." It should be noted that the psycholinguist might also argue that language and thought are inseparable in the sense that meaning and deep structure can be equated with "thought" and surface structure with "language." However, the psycholinguist (and the cognitive psychologist) would differ from the behaviorist in their accounts of the way information is processed. As described above, the behaviorist insists that language is the behavior (i.e., the corpus or language sample). Further, he depends upon explana- tions based on conditioning and related processes, such as reinforcement, chaining, and generalization, to account for the formation of simple combi- nations of stimuli and responses into increasingly complex sequences such as words, phrases, or sentences. By contrast, the psycholinguist insists that language development depends upon the child (or adult) as a receiver, processor, and transformer of information. (See the following section.) The information acquired is comprised of the structural properties of an experi- ence rather than stimuli and responses. The consequence is the formation of rules and their storage in an organized form called schemas which are often intuitive, that is, in the form of tacit, rather than explicit, knowledge. Schemas become modified with new experience and, as knowledge struc- tures, have an influence on subsequent perception, comprehension, acquisi- tion, and memory. Thought Precedes Language. Studies that have been influenced, indi- rectly or directly, by Piaget's theories imply that cognitive growth precedes language development. Language development parallels cognition but always lags behind to become mapped onto experience (Furth, 1970). The child develops meanings to be expressed in language through prior experi- ence. Within given levels of knowledge about language, its structures and functions, he discovers ways of expressing these meanings. This process</page><page sequence="14">68 Review of Research in Education, 2 always requires perceptual experience, exposure to speech patterns, and ac- tive attempts to understand them. New information is assimilated into the existing language structures, and language structures are modified to ac- commodate new forms and patterns of information input. Among the more pervasive principles representing this view is that "New forms first express old functions, and new functions are first expressed by old forms [Slobin, 1971, p. 371]." Despite exposure to large numbers of well-formed sentences, the child incorporates into his own speech patterns only those language structures that correspond to his cognitive develop- ment. Conversely, the child's cognitive development cannot be accelerated by teaching him whatever vocabulary is supposedly required for higher levels of cognitive functioning (Sinclair-de-Zwart, 1967, 1969). Arguing against the necessity for hypothesizing innate mechanisms such as the Language Acquisition Device (McNeill, 1970), Schlesinger (1971) indicates that the child's cognitive capacity determines the nature of the I- markers, that is, language input containing ways of viewing the world and comprising the speaker's intentions or the way the child's experience is pat- terned or conceptualized and the things the speaker wants to talk about. These represent the semantic intentions of the speaker. Via realization rules the child produces utterances that correspond to his intentions. In lis- tening he associates (or matches) the situation with the utterances, and in speaking, he matches utterances with the situation. In proposing realization rules, Schlesinger provides a substitute for transformational rules and P- markers (phrase markers), suggesting that the deep structure ought to focus on semantics rather than syntax. A few studies have attempted to directly relate language acquisition to cognitive development. Sinclair-de-Zwart (1967) found that preoperational children were able to identify correctly an object as bigger than the one on its left in a left-to-right ascending series. The children correctly shifted to smaller when the objects were in a continuing left-to-right descending series. However, in a descending right-to-left series (the inverse of the former), the children incorrectly described the now smaller object as being bigger than the previous one. Sinclair-de-Zwart attributed this result to the cognitive inability of preoperational children to perform the reversal of logical operations involved in employing language structures. Summary. The notion that experience and cognition precede language is prevalent in a number of current positions on semantic development to be discussed below. Nevertheless, it can be seen that the relationship be- tween language and thought is a complex one, and no single position by it- self is a sufficient explanation (Jenkins, 1969). Any language is a repre- sentation, through its underlying structure, of all languages. The language pattern (structure) learned by a member of a language community is af- fected by experiencing, perceiving, and cognizing. Whatever language is</page><page sequence="15">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 69 learned involves knowledge of structures which interact with future experi- ences, regardless of their form. Although each of the positions that have been described emphasizes a different relation between language and thought, there appear to be several points at which they converge: 1. Language has structure. Even in investigations of the directive functions of words, the word operationally represents a propositional statement implying logical relations. 2. Language acquisition and usage involve the development of perceptual strategies and knowledge about meanings to be conveyed (semantic inten- tions). 3. Experience, thought, and language development are interactive variables. What is learned about the structure of the language influences the ways new experiences are stored and meanings are expressed. With increasing cognitive capacities for perceiving there are corresponding modifications in the child's language such that they become closer approximations of the formal language structures employed by the adult. Ill. LANGUAGE DEVELOPMENT: THE ACQUISITION OF LANGUAGE While the child does not begin to use meaningful words until about his first birthday, he does considerable vocalizing prior to that time. Little is known about the relationship between the prelanguage utterances of the in- fant and the emergence of true language. Recently, however, several studies have appeared in the literature which suggest that aspects of phonological discrimination are evident shortly after birth. Phonological Development The early vocalizations of the child might be conceived as random sounds which are part of a phase preparatory to gaining control over the vocal apparatus and learning the sounds the child hears in the language of his environment. Within this context, the reactions of the adult to the sounds of the infant act as reinforcements for the language-appropriate sounds (phonemes), thereby increasing the frequency of those sounds rela- tive to the frequency of others which are not specific to the language in the child's environment. One study has shown that the frequency of vocaliza- tions by three-month-old infants can be manipulated using operant tech- niques (Rheingold, Gewirtz, &amp; Ross, 1959), and Mowrer (1960) argues that hearing oneself speak is a secondary reinforcer which facilitates learning the speech sounds of the language spoken by parents. Biological Factors in Phonological Development. A counterargument to the learning viewpoint relates to the observation that the vocalizations of</page><page sequence="16">70 Review of Research in Education, 2 the congenitally deaf child are indistinguishable from those of the hearing child up to about six months of age (Lenneberg, Rebelsky, &amp; Nichols, 1965), suggesting the influence of maturation during that period. Further- more, Lenneberg (1967), stressing the importance of biological charac- teristics in language development, indicates that control over the articula- tory aspects of speech are uncorrelated with the onset of language proper. The child gradually gains enough control over his articulators so that sound patterns may be understood by others as words. Not until later does he learn the precise movements associated with specific sounds in various con- texts. Clearly, the role of infant vocalizations during the first year of life requires further study to resolve the basic disagreements represented by the learning and biological-factor views. On the comprehension side of phonological development, Eimas, Siqueland, Jusczyk, and Vigorito (1971), Moffitt (1971), and Morse (1971) have demonstrated that the prelanguage infant does discriminate speech sounds and intonation contours as early as one month of age. Infants, like adults, make categorical discriminations among speech sounds when the physical variations in the sound yield phonemic differences. However, they fail to perceive equal physical sound variations within phoneme bounda- ries. More recently, Molfese (1972) has shown that lateralization of lan- guage processing in the left cerebral hemisphere, known to occur in adults, is apparently present in infants as young as one month, thereby providing additional support to Lenneberg's (1967) arguments that many of the lan- guage capabilities of man may be biologically determined. Feature Analyses of Phoneme Production and Comprehension. Jakob- son (1968) has suggested another approach to the study of the emergence of the sound system of language stimulated by the analysis of speech in terms of distinctive features (Chomsky &amp; Halle, 1968; Jakobson, Fant, &amp; Halle, 1952; Jakobson &amp; Halle, 1956). Jakobson's theory places an emphasis on the acoustic characteristics of the sound rather than relying exclusively on the point and manner of articulation used by most other systems (including the International Phonetic Alphabet) to describe the sounds or phonemes of language. Phonemes are considered as simultaneous actualizations of a set of features rather than as discrete individual entities. Each sound can be designated as either possessing (+) or not possessing (-) each of the features, to define the particular sounds which make up a language. Inherent features define the sounds independent of the sequences in which they enter. Prosodic features are superimposed upon the inherent features and refer to tone, force, and quality, which can only be specified in terms of the sequences of sounds in which they appear. Inherent Features. Probably not many more than 12 to 15 inherent features are necessary to define all of the sounds in any language. Each of these dichotomous features is defined in terms of acoustic and articulatory</page><page sequence="17">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 71 characteristics. By assigning language sounds the appropriate features, each phoneme can be isolated as different from every other phoneme on the basis of one or more features. The greater the number of feature dif- ferences between two sounds, the more distinctive they should be (Miller &amp; Nicely, 1955). In acquiring the language, the child begins by discriminating the features of the sounds used in the language (Jakobson, 1968). Initially he dicho- tomizes all sounds on the basis of one feature which would give him a single contrast. Features are then added progressively until all of the sounds of the language have been identified on the basis of their distin- guishing features. Each feature is assumed to be acquired in an all-or-none fashion, so that when a feature is applied, it is not to just one sound but to all sounds for which it is relevant. The order in which the features appear in the child's language seems to correspond to the number of languages in the world which contain the fea- ture. Within an individual, the whole sound development begins with the optimal consonant-optimal vowel contrast, which is the maximal sound dif- ference. More refined distinctions are then made; the consonant sounds become more compact and more vowellike, while the vowel sounds become more diffuse and more consonantlike. This theoretical system applies only to language, without concern for prelinguistic utterances. Only when the child uses meaningful words does an active phonological system replace the unsystematic phonetic prefer- ences which precede this stage of development. The assumed lack of sys- tematicity in infant prelinguistic utterances and the systematic nature of the sounds in speech seem to be a discontinuous process (Jakobson, 1968), but further research may identify heretofore undiscovered relationships be- tween the prelanguage and language stages. There are few data which bear directly on the acquisition of the sound system within Jakobson's framework. On the basis of a review of the litera- ture to 1966, Ervin-Tripp (1966) concluded there was a rough corre- spondence between the available data and Jakobson's predictions. In gen- eral, this approach to speech sound analysis promises general insights more than a look at the acquisition of specific individual phonemes. The specifi- cation of the features necessary to describe the sound system, as well as the phonological rules specifying their interrelations, however, is still far from complete (see Chomsky &amp; Halle, 1968). A somewhat different approach to the nature of phonological develop- ment has been taken by Anisfeld and his students (Anisfeld, Barlow &amp; Frail, 1968; Anisfeld &amp; Gordon, 1968). They have worked with older children in an attempt to show the relationships among features by devel- oping artificial tasks in which substitutions are forced upon the language user. For example, children in the first two elementary grades were asked</page><page sequence="18">72 Review of Research in Education, 2 which of two nonsense syllables best represented a plural. The syllables (e.g., NAR) were presented as singular forms, and then two forms of the syllable with an additional phoneme (e.g., NARF and NARK) were presented as a choice for a plural form. The children tended to choose the plural form most similar (i.e., fewest distinctive feature differences) to the regular /s/ or /z/ used to form plurals in English.' When given a choice, the sounds with the feature + strident (e.g., /tI/, /di/ and I'/ as in church, jet, and ship, respectively) were chosen more often than by chance. This fea- ture defines the silibants and is the distinguishing feature of the regular plural markers /s/ and /z/. Messer (1967), using a similar approach with three-year-old children, found that children forced to choose between two artificial monosyllable words selected those which followed the rules of En- glish. Mispronunciations of both types of words by the children were minimally distant from the correct pronunciation in terms of the number of distinctive features. Together, these studies provide additional support to the psychological reality of the distinctive-features analysis. Prosodic Features. While the data relevant to inherent features are not extensive, those bearing upon the development of prosodic features are even less so. Some observers (Pike, 1949; Weir, 1962, 1966) suggest that the infant imitates prosodic features during the babbling period. Miller and Ervin (1964) indicate that the rising and falling intonations associated with questions and statements occur much later. Menyuk and Bernholtz (1969) found that children at the one-word stage of development (well past the babbling state) use distinguishable intonation patterns which identify the single-word utterances as declarative, interrogative, and emphatic state- ments. Obviously, much more attention needs to be paid to prosodic fea- tures before a clear notion of their development is attained and the possi- bility that the prosody heard in babbling may reflect only anthropomorphic interpretations by adults can be eliminated. An interesting characteristic of the acoustic features of speech sounds is that phonemes remain the same for an individual speaker but the absolute frequencies vary considerably between speakers. For example, sounds of the male voice are lower than those of the female voice, and the female voice falls in a lower frequency range than that of a child. Nevertheless, the child is not confused by the overlap in acoustic characteristics of different sounds (e.g., pat/pet) or the acoustic differences in the same sounds when different speakers use them. Similarly, the adult understands the child even before all the distinctive feature contrasts have been acquired. These ob- servations imply that both children and adults respond to patterns of 1Phonemic symbols are by convention represented between slash marks to distin- guish them from alphabetic letters, which often have several sounds associated with them. Thus, for example, the word 'cat' is spelled /ket/ phonemically.</page><page sequence="19">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 73 sounds rather than to the absolute characteristics of the sound. Sequencing Rules In Phonological Development. Berko (1958) was the first to examine sequencing rules involved in the acquisition of the bound morphemes which inflect verbs for tense and nouns for plural and posses- sive. Despite some methodological weaknesses (Natalicio &amp; Natalicio, 1969) in this classic study, there are enough subsequent data to permit confidence in the results. Berko's procedure involved presenting four- to seven-year-old children with pictures referenced by nonsense or real En- glish names. She then elicited from the child the appropriate name, with an inflection. Since all of the sounds used in producing; these inflections were within the articulatory abilities of the children, the question of concern was whether the children had acquired the phonological rules which determine the particular inflectional ending in each phonological context: the three allomorphs for past tense, and the three allomorphs for pluralization. A comparison of the four- and five-year-old group with the six- and seven- year-old group indicated that of the 28 items used in her test, there were 12 on which the productions of the older children were significantly closer to those of adults. Pluralization of the nonsense words was generally 70 per- cent correct or better for all ages when the /s/ and /z/ allomorphs were required but less than 40 percent correct when the laz/ allomorph was cor- rect, despite the fact that 99 percent of the older children correctly inflected glass for the plural form. With past-tense inflection, performance ranged from approximately 50 to 85 percent correct when the It/ or /d/ inflection was required but was less than 35 percent at all ages when the /ad/ inflec- tion was correct for the nonsense words, although the verb melt was cor- rectly inflected by better than 70 percent of all children. Three alternative explanations of Berko's findings are possible: 1. In both the pluralization and the past-tense inflection rules, children collapse the three rules involved into two, at least insofar as the produc- tive extension of the rules is concerned. 2. The child has three rules in each case but for nouns ending in a sibilant or verbs endings in It/ or /d/, pluralization and past tense both are formed by a zero allomorph. 3. Berko favors the argument that there is only one rule in each case, a rule that /z/ added to a noun makes the word plural and a rule that /d/ added to a verb makes it past tense. Under certain conditions, the /z/ becomes /s/ and the /d/ becomes I/t/ automatically, by a more general phonological rule. Berko also found that the plural of some nouns, for example heaf, and the past tense of some verbs, for example gling, were treated as irregular forms by a significant number of adults, who offered the plural form heaves</page><page sequence="20">74 Review of Research in Education, 2 (42 percent) and the past form glung or glang (75 percent), which the children seldom produced. In addition, the Iaz/ plural for glass was cor- rectly used by 99 percent of the older children but not generalized to new words. These findings suggest that children learn some irregular forms by rote and later require an alternative rule based upon a few irregular words in the language, and which they extend to new words with a similar overall phonological form. Rote learning may be a general initial strategy in lan- guage acquisition, at least for some aspects of language. Only when the memory load or some other factor makes rote learning unmanageable does the use of more general rules come into play. Berko's data on the relatively better performance with the /oz/ allomorph for possessive forms and the third-person singular verbs relative to the plural form implies that acquired rules are sensitive to other factors, such as syntactic context, before they are applied only on phonological bases. Berko's suggestion that children may generalize responses on the basis of phonological rather than phonetic similarity, that is, on the basis of feature similarity and not sound similarity, was followed up by Anisfeld and his colleagues. In the first of a series of studies (Anisfeld &amp; Tucker, 1967) the development of pluralization rules was examined. It was found that six- year-old children had difficulty only with the pluralization rule in which 4z/12 is used, but they were aware of both the concept of plurality and the phonological problems involved with words ending in sounds which require the AIz/ plural form. Furthermore, they tended to use numbers in their responses when they were not sure of the correct pluralization rule. The children responded as if they knew that their pluralization might not convey the semantic concept and therefore preceded the word by the ap- propriate number to achieve the same effect. A second study indicated that children seem to have a concept that the plural form of a name is the singular form with something appended. Children of this age appear to have the concept of one and more than one, the ability to recognize when they do not know how to correctly pluralize a word, and the concept that pluralization demands some sort of phonological addition to the word to make it plural, although they may not know what the addition should be. Two additional studies (Anisfeld, Barlow &amp; Frail, 1968; Anisfeld &amp; Gordon, 1968) dealt specifically with the child's generalization of phonological rules in relation to the distinctive fea- tures of the sounds associated with inflections for plural and past tense. The results indicated that adults restricted their plural choices when possible to sounds which were + strident (ch and j), + continuant (the) or both (f, v, and sh). The six-to-nine-year-olds' preferences were restricted to /sh/, /ch/, 2Anisfeld and his collaborators use the /iz/ and lid/ phonetic symbols where Berko used the /az/ and /od/.</page><page sequence="21">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 75 and /j/, which make up the subclass of sounds which, along with /s/ and /z/, comprise the functionally significant sounds in English pluralization; they all take the izl form for pluralization when they occur at the end of a noun. Although the children demonstrated some tendency to prefer the /f/, /v/, and /th/ found acceptable by adults, their preferences for all sounds were weaker than those of the adults. The adults also favored the /m/ and /n/ endings often used in irregular forms of pluralization in English, while the children showed no such preferences. This indicates that children's phonological rules are less well developed than adults', a finding that ap- pears to corroborate Berko's results with heaf and gling. In general, children's rules appear to be more restrictive than adults'. When making past-tense choices, the fifth-grade children showed significant preferences for /ch/ and /j/, which contain the It/ and /d/ sounds, respectively, in their complex articulation. Finally, studies by Bruce (1964) and by Bryant and Anisfeld (1969) show that children have difficulty parsing the singular from the plural form. At earlier ages the child treats whole sentences as undivided units. With further language acquisition, he parses the larger units into parts. In the age range from five to eight, the child deals with the word, or syllable, as the sound unit, since analytic abilities required to isolate and manipulate phonemic units within words are lacking. Adults analyze the syllable unit prior to the phonemic unit, since phonemes are abstract entities which are perceived only by an analysis of previously perceived syllables (Savin &amp; Bever, 1970). Young children learning inflection rules may be learning new words which express semantic concepts, rather than new phonemes which convert singular words to their plural form. At a later age, sometime after the child generalizes the /d/ and /z/ inflectional forms, he makes the latter analysis. By the time he is six or seven he has developed a complex system of phonological rules, but he still has not abstracted the phoneme from that system of rules. Nor has he mastered the complex relationships which the phoneme has to acoustic stimuli and to articulatory movements. Summary. Evidence of phonological development appears to begin as early as the first few weeks of life, at least in terms of receptive differentia- tion, and extends to about eight years of age before the intricacies of production are fully mastered. There is evidence of an innate biological receptivity to phonological distinctions at birth, followed, beginning at about one year of age, by increasing ability to make productive feature dis- tinctions (Menyuk, 1968; 197 1) and to form sequential rules for the combi- nation of sounds. The child acquires these rules early in order to put sounds together to form words, but he has difficulty with the rules for combining consonants in clusters until he is seven or eight years of age (Templin, 1957). Finally, the child acquires suprasegmental rules at the same time he is forming words by use of segmental and sequencing rules. Examples</page><page sequence="22">76 Review of Research in Education, 2 are rules for sequencing and stress within words (e.g., photo- graph-photography; produce-production) and intonation contours for sentences such as rising intonation at the end of a yes-no question). For a more comprehensive account of all aspects of phonological development, the reader should consult Menyuk (in press). Syntactic Development At about one year of age the child begins to utter single words which seem to have some meaningful relation to his contextual environment (Greenfield, Smith &amp; Laufer, in press). Most of these early words are nouns or verbs; the child appears to be able to communicate some messages to those around him by single words, taking advantage of the context to convey the rest of the message. The term "holophrastic" has been used to describe the speech of children at this stage on the assumption that its evi- dent conative, expressive, and referential characteristics express complex ideas which only later will be supported by a complete syntax (McNeill, 1970). Sometime between the ages of approximately 18 and 24 months the child begins to utter constructions of two words, and analyses of language constructions can be less tenuous. The early linguistic analyses of Braine, Miller, and Brown (Braine, 1963; W. R. Miller, 1964a, 1964b; Miller and Ervin, 1964; Brown, Cazden &amp; Bellugi, 1969; Brown &amp; Fraser, 1964; Brown, Fraser &amp; Bellugi, 1964) noted that two-word utterances seem to have a characteristic structure which accounts for about 70 percent of the utterances heard. Examining the entire corpus or a sample of the child's speech, it has been observed that there is a small group of words which occur fairly consistently in the first position, another, smaller group of words which occur fairly consistently in the second position, and a larger group of words which occur in either the first or second positions. The grammar of this stage was described initially as consisting of sentences composed of a pivot word plus an open-class word, or an open-class word plus a pivot word. The pivot words which occurred in the first position did not seem to appear in the second position, and vice versa, while the open- class words often occurred in both positions. In general, the conclusion was that first language constructions took the form of P-O or O-P. Going beyond the simple pivot-open distributional analysis of these early "sentence" constructions to an examination of the nature of the pivot and open word relations leads to a hodgepodge of parts of speech, by adult standards. McNeill (1966a), however, demonstrated that every utterance of one of the children studied by Brown represented a grammatical form which would subsequently be used in complete form. Some took the form of modifier plus noun, others verb plus object, still others subject plus predicate, and so on. Furthermore, an analysis of the three-word utterances</page><page sequence="23">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 77 pointed to an adult form that eventually could be observed in complete syntax. Finally, none of the child's utterances failed to fit into the system. In other words, the child was not sequencing words in random fashion to achieve communication. The evidence clearly implies a set of grammatical rules governing the child's constructions which could be related directly to adult grammar. Thus, the syntactic structures reflected in these early utter- ances is more complicated and more directly related to the target grammar toward which the child is moving than the simple P-O grammar analysis had suggested. Bloom (1970) stated that these earlier analyses, by failing to consider context, limited grammatical analyses of utterances such as Mommy book to a single category. Upon a detailed examination of language patterns at this stage, she concluded that more than one grammatical function might be served by the same two-word utterance, depending upon the context in which it was spoken. In the example above the grammatical relation of pos- session (Mommy's book) may be intended in one context, and a subject- object relation in another (Mommy is reading the book). The import of Bloom's work was to indicate that the child has an even greater grasp of grammatical relations than McNeill's analysis had implied. We are led by this research to the implication that language is but a' manifestation or, perhaps, expression of a broader cognitive structure, a position from which Piaget (Sinclair-de-Zwart, 1969) has argued for some years. Slobin (1971) has recently provided a number of specific hypotheses about the relations between linguistic development and cognitive structures. The acquisition of syntax seems to be related to the derivational complexity of particular syntactic forms. Brown and Hanlon (1970) report a developmental progression from sentences of relatively simple linguistic derivation to those which are more complex. (The exceptions to this gener- alization center around the details of the linguistic theory, rather than major constructions.) It is evident from children's errors that, as in their P-O constructions, their later constructions are rule generated: their errors reflect overgeneralization of new rules to exceptions or failure to acquire some rule. For example, at the morphological level, children first learn the past tense of irregular verbs (made, ran, came). Then they learn the rule governing past-tense inflections of regular verbs (walked, rubbed, seated), at which time errors are made on the irreg- ular forms reflecting overgeneralization of the rule acquired (maked, ranned, camed). At the syntactic level the child may utter "I don't see something," which reflects a developmental level of negative construction. The latter construction is rule governed, but the child's rule has not, as yet, taken into account the relation between the negating of the verb and the form of the indefinite pronoun which is the object of the verb. There ap- pears to be a regularity to the approach children take to the target language</page><page sequence="24">78 Review of Research in Education, 2 which is reflected in a systematic sequential process of acquiring the rules. In Brown and Hanlon's (1970) words, "The fact that some ungrammatical or immature forms have been used by all the children that have been stud- ied shows that children are alike in the innate knowledge, language- processing routines, preferences and assumptions they bring to the problem of language acquisition [p. 49] ." An examination of the development of specific constructions has revealed some of the details of acquisition. Bellugi (1964), for example, found that the first negative constructions appeared when the mean utter- ance length was 1.4 and 1.9 morphemes (excluding the negative morpheme) for the two children studied. The children were 18, 22, and 25 months and 28, 32, and 38 months old, respectively, at the beginning of Stages I, II, and III of their development. Each stage lasted about three to six months. However, the state of development was actually defined in terms of the mean number of morphemes per utterance, since, in the early stages of language acquisition, this measure is a much more accurate gauge of development than is chronological age (Bellugi, 1965; Brown, Cazden &amp; Bellugi, 1969). As may be seen, there is a good deal of variability in the ages of the two children at which their utterance length and syntactic devel- opment are quite comparable. Bellugi's study found that the first negative is formed by the simple procedure of appending a "no" or "not" to the beginning or, less frequently, to the end of an affirmative utterance. The second stage includes four negative constructions which all appear at about the same time. While the constructions of the first stage do not resemble the model language, some of the second-stage negative utterances are perfectly grammatical from an adult point of view. One interesting characteristic of this stage is that can't and don't forms are used before can and do. Can't and don't ap- pear to function as single-unit negative morphemes at this stage, and not until the next stage does the child separate the auxiliary verb from the neg- ative and use them independently. In the third stage, Bellugi found the appearance of indefinite adjectives and pronouns and the progressive form of the verb in the child's language. The copular be is first seen in Stage III but it is optional; sometimes it ap- pears and sometimes it doesn't. In the fourth stage, be is obligatory in some forms and optional in others. It appears that the child complicates his utter- ances a step at a time; the be copular verb, for example, appears first in the earlier, perhaps simpler, forms and becomes obligatory only after other aspects of the construction are well established. Later be is added to other forms as they are incorporated into the child's language. Bellugi (1965) and Brown (1968) have also analyzed the interrogative development of three children. At the same stages of development, defined by mean length of utterance in morphemes used to describe the negative</page><page sequence="25">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 79 forms, the children were also learning the syntax of questions. They clearly acquired both syntactic structures at the same time, in coordinated fashion. For example, can't and don't appeared in questions as well as in negative declarative structures at the same stage of development. When can and do appeared, they were observed in negative, interrogative, and simple declarative affirmative sentences at about the same stage of development. Furthermore, other auxiliaries were found to enter the system in all three types of sentences. Thus, the development of each structure may be recorded separately, but they are all coordinated in the sense that the dev- elopment of all structures is dependent upon a common core of elements. When one element, such as auxiliaries or indefinite adjectives, is required, it is reflected in the change of all the larger syntactic structures or sen- tences. An examination of children's responses to questions indicated that comprehension precedes or at least parallels production of the interroga- tive. In the first stage, for example, when the child is primarily using in- tonation contour (using a rising intonation at the end of utterances to in- dicate a question), he does not comprehend wh interrogatives. His responses to questions such as "What are you doing?" are completely irrel- evant to the question. Later, in the second stage, as he produces wh inter- rogatives, his answers to such questions are also appropriate, indicating comprehension. In fact, the child appears to comprehend questions of the wh form which are more complex than those he asks. A number of inves- tigators have suggested that comprehension precedes production in lan- guage development. Some additional relevant research related to this hypothesis will be presented later. Expansion, Reduction and Imitation. The child's language can be ex- amined in terms of the relation between what he says and what the adult says in discourse between the two. The child's utterances bear a consistent relationship to those of the parent, on a number of dimensions. They are shorter, but they contain some of the same morphemes as appear in the parent's utterances. Initially, the child appears to talk only in the present; there is no indication of future or past tense. The parent, on the other hand, tends to speak in relatively short and simple sentences to the child. Brown and Bellugi (1964) found that the child's imitation of the adult's utterance reduces the latter in length but retains the high content words in the correct order. The preservation of word order implies that the adult sentence is processed as a unitary construction and is uninfluenced by the factors that affect recall of a list of unrelated words. Thus, the child is able to comprehend longer utterances but is unable to produce them (Freedle, Kenney, &amp; Smith, 1970). Brown and Bellugi (1964) also observed an interaction between the length of parental and child utterances. The child's imitative responses</page><page sequence="26">80 Review of Research in Education, 2 always remain within the normal length of his own spontaneous utterances, regardless of the length of the model's utterance. The child shortens the adult's utterance by retaining high information or content words and omit- ting functors. The nouns and verbs are retained, while the words with no semantic content and less stress in the sentence tend to be eliminated. On the other hand, the parent expands the child's utterances. The child's short, incomplete utterances are repeated with a stress contour and the inclusion of functors. Word order is preserved, and there is heavy reliance on context in the adult's expansion of the child's utterance. There often may be several interpretations of an utterance with respect to such things as tense of verbs, prepositions, and declarative or question forms. The parent frequently seems to be verifying his interpretation of the child's utterance when he responds by expanding. In order to examine the role of imitation in this process, Ervin (1964) wrote grammatical rules for the free utterances of the five children she stud- ied. Then the children's spontaneous imitations of adult utterances were tested against the grammar to see if they were at the same or at a more ad- vanced grammatical level than their spontaneous utterances. While not denying that imitation might have played some part in language acquisi- tion, Ervin (1964) concluded "there is not a shred of evidence supporting a view that progress toward adult norms of grammar arises merely from prac- tice in overt imitation of adult sentences [p. 72] ." Slobin (1965) attempted a more fine-grained analysis of these imitative processes by examing the exchanges between parent and child when the parent expanded the child's utterances and the child, in turn, imitated the expansion. Under these conditions the child was found to expand his previous utterance about 50 percent of the time. Slobin argues that this type of exchange can be viewed as a teaching device which permits the child to advance his grammar. Thus it seems that Ervin's statement was too strong. When imitation is viewed in terms of reduction-expansion-reduction exchanges between child and parent, language acquisition does appear to be facilitated. Later Syntactic Development. Prior to the time the child is five years old, he has acquired a major portion of grammatical structures of his lan- guage, whichever language that may be. Menyuk (1963a, 1963b, 1964a, 1964b), as a consequence of examining extensive samples of the productive language of preschool children, concluded that "All the basic structures used by adults to generate their sentences can be found in the grammar of nursery school children [Menyuk, 1963a, p. 419]." Slobin (1966) drew a similar conclusion on the basis of his research on the comprehension of ac- tive, passive, negative, and passive-negative sentences. While it is obvious that the child entering school does seem capable of syntactically correct language at a relatively complex level, more recent</page><page sequence="27">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 81 research has indicated that syntactic development continues well into later childhood and even adolescence (Palermo &amp; Molfese, 1972). C. A. Chomsky, (1969), Cromer (1970), and Kessel (1970), for example, have shown that children in the age range from five to nine have difficulty with constructions involving the verbs ask and promise, pronominalization, and sentences in which the surface-structure subject is not the deep-structure subject (e.g., John is easy to please). Sentence constructions involving ask/tell, in which the main clause consists of an interrogative pronoun and infinitival verb (ask/tell me which block to take) were found to be difficult even for adult subjects (Sanders, 1971). Passive sentences are difficult for school age children to comprehend (Gaer, 1969; Hayhurst, 1967; Turner &amp; Rommetveit, 1967). Connectives such as because, but, and although are not fully comprehended even at grade six (Katz &amp; Brent, 1968). Neimark and Slotnick (1970) and Neimark (1970) have also shown that at the high school level the little word "or" still causes problems in comprehension of logical problems. Bormuth, Manning, Carr, and Pearson (1970) demon- strated the inadequacy of fourth-graders' comprehension of a variety of syntactic forms and the serious implications this has for the educational process. In summary, syntactic development appears to begin as early as the one- word stage, where environmental context serves to support the child's single-word utterances. Syntax develops rapidly once the child begins to utter strings of two or more words, and it reaches the stage at which he speaks in complete and varied grammatical structures before he is five years of age. There remains, however, a good deal to be acquired, and full competence with all structures does not seem to be reached until rather late in childhood. There is accumulating evidence to suggest that syntactic de- velopment depends upon prior cognitive development. The ties between the two are discussed more fully in other sections of this chapter. Semantic Development The study of semantic development must be considered one of the fron- tiers of research on language development. (See, for example, Perfetti, 1972.) The derivation of meanings is reflected in the meanings of words, it influences the use of grammar, it is influenced by grammar, and it influences most aspects of cognition and thought, including cognitive struc- ture, comprehension, concept formation, and memory. Thus it has influences beyond the language itself. The Meaning of Words. The extent of one's vocabulary is an indicator of the meanings one has. Both basic and derived vocabularies increase dramatically between CA:2 and CA:12 (M. K. Smith, 1941). Corre- sponding increases in the differences between the two vocabularies over age imply increased precision in word meanings.</page><page sequence="28">82 Review of Research in Education, 2 Frequency. Analyses of the Thorndike-Lorge (1944) word-count norms and of its more recent counterpart (Carroll, Davies &amp; Richman, 1971) indicate increases in frequencies of abstract words with age. Lorge and Chall (1963) examined studies of vocabulary estimates conducted since the 1800s for limitations of the methods of frequency sampling and dic- tionary sampling used in estimating vocabulary size. They conclude that when sampling and other errors are considered, the estimates of the vocabularies of first-grade children are close to the older estimates, reported to be in the thousands, rather than in the tens of thousands, as M. K. Smith's (1941) study reported. Nevertheless, they suggest that ade- quate estimates will depend upon further investigations of the methodol- ogical issues involved in estimating vocabulary size. Associations. Palermo and Jenkins (1964) compiled normative tables of word associations to 200 stimulus words given by children in the 1st through 8th grades, high school students in the 10th and 12th grades, and college students. Increases with age were found in agreement of parts of speech between the individual responses and the stimuli, frequency of the most popular responses, and use of opposite responses to the stimulus words. Superordinate responses increased up to grade six and then decreased (Palermo and Jenkins, 1963). The greatest increases in paradig- matic responses (i.e., responses that are of the same part of speech as the stimulus) occurred between the first and second grades. (Brown &amp; Berko, 1960; Entwisle, 1966; Palermo, 197 Ic). Grammatical Functions. Carroll (1971a) investigated the development of meanings for grammatically ambiguous words based on words having multiple grammatical functions (MGF). Increases were found between the third and ninth grades in lexicographical information. Both comprehension of grammatical functions and differential meanings were implicated as related to these changes, which were also correlated with general vocabu- lary. Carroll also presents normative data for several measures, including MGF for 600 unambiguous and 630 ambiguous words. Semantic Meanings. The semantic content of words is reflected, too, in their connotative meanings, as measured by the semantic differential tech- nique. Representative studies in this domain of investigation have been compiled in a volume edited by Snider &amp; Osgood (1969). Studies of children's responses on the semantic differential from grades two through seven (Di Vesta, 1966a) indicate that the use of the Potency and Activity dimensions by second-grade children is correlated and comprises a dynamism factor (e.g., "big things are fast"). Older children have devel- oped semantic systems characterized by the differentiated Evaluation, Po- tency, and Activity system found in adults (Di Vesta, 1966a, 1966b). Over these same age ranges, abstract concepts are first rated neutral but progres- sively increase over age in degree of polarity in the Evaluation dimension,</page><page sequence="29">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 83 so that by the seventh grade ratings correspond to those made by adults (Di Vesta, 1966a). Ervin &amp; Foster (1960) demonstrate that children, even up to CA: 12, employed happy, pretty, and good synonymously, as they did large and strong, suggesting that these words enter the lexicon without all the semantic markers necessary for differentiation within categories (Lumsden &amp; Poteat, 1968; Palermo &amp; Molfese, 1972). Referential Theories of Semantic Development. Meanings of isolated words comprise only one aspect of semantics. Olson (1970a, 1970b, 1972) has argued that semantic decisions are not determined by the syntactic and semantic markers of the linguistic system but "rather on the basis of the user's knowledge of the perceived and intended referent [Olson, 1970b, p. 271]." A word represents selected features of objects and events relative to other alternative words, thereby describing both what the referent includes and what it excludes. Language is comprised of choices of words to facilitate comprehension through differentiating the intended referent from a set of alternatives. For the speaker, language is redundant, that is, it has no information; for the listener, language (the choice of words by the speaker) provides the basis for obtaining information. Olson (1970a) has examined these notions in studies of cognitive growth and has applied them to procedures involved in the Montessori and other instructional methods. A number of psycholinguists, among whom are Greenfield, Smith, &amp; Laufer (in press), Macnamara (1972), Schlesinger (1971), Bloom (1970), and Brown (1973), are united in the view that the referential features of a situation and comprehension of its nonlinguistic structure are important in learning the grammar and in the observer's understanding of what is being communicated by the child. In a study of the early language habits of two children (approximately 7 to 22 months of age) in the holophrastic stage of language development, Greenfield et al. (in press) concluded that sequences of single words focus on different situational features rather than each other. The later two-word utterances of children 19 to 23 months old ap- pear to be based on such semantic considerations as nonlinguistic contexts, features of the referent toward which the utterance is directed, temporal relations among events being considered, and context provided by preced- ing utterances (Bloom, 1970). Brown (1973) has indicated that combina- tions of words in the P-O classes have the reference (semantic) functions of nomination (pointing and naming an object), notice (attracting attention to an object), recurrence (commenting on or requesting the appearance of an object), and nonexistence (commenting on or requesting the disappearance of an object). They appear to be outgrowths of the child's early experience at the sensorimotor level (Piaget) in which the permanence of objects, rec- ognition of objects, differentiation of self from others, and distinctions of actions from objects lead to the agent, object, and dative semantic relations (Brown, 1973).</page><page sequence="30">84 Review of Research in Education, 2 The ability to communicate referential features of unique graphic figures by developing names to describe the figures is positively correlated with age (Krauss &amp; Glucksberg, 1969). With repeated trials, kindergarten children failed to improve, while communication by children in the first, third, and fifth grades showed steady improvement. Even at the age of 10, children did not reach the adult's level of performance. Interestingly, the comprehension accuracy of an adult listener in child-speaker-adult-listener pairs increased as a positive function of the age of the child-speaker. Werner and Kaplan (1950) showed that the referential meaning of an artificial word when placed in six different sentences could be derived by children of CA:8.6 to CA:13.6. The sentences were of the forms: A CORPLUM may be used for support, CORPLUM can be used to close off an open space, and A CORPLUM will burn. Younger children up to CA: 10 made the mistake of using part of one sentence as a definition of the word; these mistakes decreased with increasing age. Another kind of mis- take extends the general meaning of a word so that a phrase which suited one sentence also fits the other. This "mistake" was made by children up to CA: 12.6. Saltz (1971) has noted that when given two different ideas em- bedded contextually within a sentence (e.g., a father who goes to work where he is a doctor), six-year-old children tend to overdiscriminate, or fail to conserve a concept; in the example, they tend to reply that when the fa- ther goes to work he is no longer a father. If the father is depicted as a drunkard (thereby increasing the good-bad contrast) the effect is noted as late as eight years of age. The ability to employ increasingly inclusive categories is an indicator of vertical semantic development. In an early experiment by Sigel (1953), seven-year-olds sorted items into concrete categories based on perceptual characteristics such as uses of objects, similarities in structure, and proxim- ity of geographical locations. Eleven-year-olds treated the same objects in terms of their membership in a superordinate category, such as animal, fur- niture, or vehicle. A parallel study of semantic development was conducted recently by Anglin (1970), who used a task in which added instances resulted in a hierarchical arrangement of increasing abstractness. Anglin concluded from his findings that semantic development is from concrete to abstract and involves increasing accretion of features that enable the for- mation of the larger, more inclusive, superordinate categories. (Also see Palermo &amp; Jenkins, 1963.) The studies described in this section generally indicate that semantic development consists of the accrual of features for a given lexical item over time. The evidence suggests that more information is available with increases in age which allows the child to delimit the concept underlying the meaning of a given word (McNeill, 1970; Clifton, 1967). While the development of semantic meaning occurs well into the adolescent years,</page><page sequence="31">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 85 Macnamara (1972) and Greenfield et al. (1972) imply that infants and very young children (8 to 24 months) learn the language by first determining, in- dependent of language, the meaning a speaker intends to convey and then working out the relationship between the meaning and the expression heard. Thus even the holophrastic and two-word structures are employed to represent a variety of semantic structures. Theories Based On Selection-Restrictions. Evidence for the ability to use semantic markers was provided by McNeill (1970) in an experiment in which subjects were required to recall grammatical (syntactically and semantically correct), anomalous (syntactically correct but semantically il- logical), and scrambled (syntactically and semantically incorrect) strings heard through a + 5 dB masking noise. (Also see Marks and Miller, 1964.) The difference in recall between grammatical and anomalous strings was assumed to reflect the ability to use semantic restrictions, and that be- tween anomalous and scrambled strings was taken to reflect the ability to use syntactic restrictions in deriving the meaning of a string of words. Mc- Neill (1970) found that five-year-olds were much less able to exploit semantic restrictions than were eight-year-olds. Children at all ages per- formed about the same on the three types of sentences, but the eight-year- olds' performance was significantly better than that of all other groups on grammatical sentences. The Syntagmatic-Paradigmatic Shift. Responses in word association tests may be classified as paradigmatic, where the response is the same part of speech as the stimulus (deep/shallow), or syntagmatic, where it is a dif- ferent part of speech (deep/hole). The associations of five- to six-year-old children are dominated by syntagmatic associations, while those of adults tend to be dominated by paradigmatic associations (Brown &amp; Berko, 1960; Ervin, 1961; Palermo, 1971). The change, or shift, occurs during the ages of five and nine years. A possible explanation of the shift is oriented around the issue of whether semantic development is horizontal or vertical (McNeill, 1970). If horizontal, words enter the lexicon sequentially such that semantic features differ among words; semantic development then proceeds by the addition of semantic markers to words as well as the addition of new words. If ver- tical, a word enters the lexicon with most or all of its semantic features. Thus, semantic development consists mainly of adding new words and unifying the organization of acquisitions according to semantic markers. The latter circumstance implies that words common to the vocabularies of children and adults could have the same properties. McNeill (1966b; 1970) and Clifton (1967) reasoned that the syntag- matic-paradigmatic shift is a consequence of semantic rather than syntactic unification, that is, of horizontal development. In brief, syntagmatic responses are often paradigmatic responses which, because of the breadth</page><page sequence="32">86 Review of Research in Education, 2 of the child's semantic categories, fall outside the grammatical class of the stimulus. During the course of development, the number of features as- sociated with a word, including its bipolar contrast, is increased, thereby confining it to a category consisting only of words in the same form class. The shift to paradigmatic responses makes its appearance when sufficient numbers of features are added ". . . so that the minimal contrast for any word will always lie within the boundaries of the word's grammatical class [McNeill, 1966b, p. 556] ." Anderson and Beh (1968) argued that paradigmatic responses result from vertical development. They presented a list comprised of syntagmatic and paradigmatic associates, randomly arranged, to six- and seven-year- olds whose task was to recognize which words were repeated. The seven- year-olds confused more paradigmatic responses (e.g., come was "recog- nized" as a repeated word when, in fact, it was go). McNeill (1970) in- dicates that even a single semantic marker unified vertically will create such confusions; without vertical unification they would be impossible. It seems reasonable to assume that semantic development is both ver- tical and horizontal, since they are not mutually exclusive processes when the entire lexicon is considered (McNeill, 1970; Palermo &amp; Molfese, 1972). However, there have been no studies in which the alternative hy- potheses have been tested directly. Although semantics plays a greater role than syntax in comprehension, grammaticality does have its effects. Carroll (197 lb), for example, has ex- tracted from the literature some conclusions regarding the effects of lan- guage structure on understanding which appear to be applicable to semantic development, as follows: 1. The logical subject of the deep structure of a sentence influences meaning more than does the surface subject. 2. Interpretation failures are often due to failure to process all of the input, especially those features denoting relationships. 3. Self-embedded statements are more difficult to understand than their right- branching equivalents. 4. The number of transformations required to process surface structure into deep structure increases sentence complexity and thereby increases difficulty in processing (though not necessarily). The Case Theory of Grammar. The relations suggested by Bloom (1970) had been formally presented in Fillmore's (1968) model based on the assumption that case relations (agentive, instrumental, dative, factitive, locative, and objective) are the primitive elements of the grammar. Case was changed to a semantic element of deep structure from its traditional use as a morphological element related to surface structure, as, for ex- ample, in Latin. In common with a number of other generative gram-</page><page sequence="33">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 87 marians (Lakoff, 1968, 1969; McCawley, 1968) who tend to employ a semantic base structure, Fillmore argues that syntactic transformations are governed by case categories. The principal constituents of sentences within the case grammar are the proposition, or the tenseless relations involving verbs and nouns, and the modality, or the reflection, in the sentence as a whole, of tense, mood, and negation. Agentive, objective, locative, and dative case forms were found in samples of early speech from American, Samoan, Finnish, and Luo children (Kernan, 1970). Definite case markers were absent, as were all but the rudimentary modalities of interrogatives and negation. Kernan found that the utterances of a 21/2-year-old Samoan child were either predicative (contained a verb of action), or stative (did not contain the notion of ac- tion). Case relations exhibited in the child's speech were agentive (verb with agent), objective (verb with object), and locative (verb with direction) for utterances of predication and names of objects in combination with location for stative utterances. Most of the utterances of the child corre- sponded in length to those observed in pivot grammar and expressed only one semantic relationship. The model of grammar emerging from Kernan's analysis rests on rules for representing semantic relations and the linguistic representation of these events. Semantic relations represent observable aspects of the envi- ronment. Language is the basis for expressing meanings by the speaker-list- ener within his language community. Thus, the P + O utterance my candy expresses possession and is a cognitive interpretation of reality. Rules such as agent + object, object + action, direction + action, and dative + ac- tion result in linguistic expressions of semantic relations, that is, they rep- resent the speaker's knowledge. Greenfield et al. (in press) see reflections of conceptual development in the progressive appearance of cases. With development (from eight months to two years), there are corresponding increases in external entities in the utterance. As they indicate, a name requires but one entity in the situa- tional structure; dative or locative cases require two. Thus, in the course of development, language takes on greater complexity. Knowledge and linguistic intent find expression through realization rules (Schlesinger, 1971). In the course of learning the language, the child learns features of objects and actions that can be associated with names, rules for the order in which words can be arranged, names for functions, and the for- mation and markings for word classes. First in language development is learning to name environmental features, then expressing single rela- tionships, and finally combining two or more relationships in deep struc- ture, together with new realization rules for ordering or surface deletions which permit the expression of more complex relations. Comprehension of Relational Terms. Studies of the comprehension of</page><page sequence="34">88 Review of Research in Education, 2 relational terms denote an interaction between cognitive capacity and the extent to which two opposing terms are understood. They imply that children in the early elementary grades may have a substantial number of words that have different meanings from those of the adult. In the review below, it can be seen that the transition from the preoperational period to the concrete operations period is marked by a developmental shift in the ability to use these words. Children's errors of such notions as those involved in temporal events are not random. When the order of clauses corresponds to the order in which events actually occur, sentences are more easily understood than when the reverse is the case (Clark &amp; Clark, 1968). Before is more easily understood (less complex) than after by 3-year-old children because it con- tains fewer semantic features than after (Clark, 1971; Clark &amp; Clark, 1968). These features are acquired developmentally in hierarchical fashion in the order listed. Furthermore, positive features (affirmation) are learned earlier (are more easily verified) than negative (negation) features (Just &amp; Carpenter, 1971). Thus, before is differentiated from after in terms of the negative value for the last feature learned. Amidon and Carey (1972) extended Clark's studies to 5 year-old children's comprehension of sentences with first and last (move the red plane first; move the blue plane last). In contrast to Clark's findings, first and last were found to be comprehended more easily than before and after (move the red plane before you move the blue plane). Although these two pairs appear to be identical in their semantic features, Amidon and Carey concluded that before and after sentences were more difficult because they contained subordinating syntax, that is, the main clauses were always asser- tions and the subordinate clauses were always presuppositions (Smith &amp; McMahon, 1970), while first and last sentences were comprised of two main clauses with corresponding temporal feature markers. In an extensive series of parallel studies with preoperational Scottish children, Donaldson and her colleagues (Donaldson &amp; Balfour, 1968; Donaldson &amp; Wales, 1970) studied the acquisition of relational terms including polar adjectives (more/less, same/different), superlatives (too-X used descriptively), true comparative (more than ...), and comparatives (too-X, X-enough used as functional comparatives). More and less were found to be used synonymously. Similar results were obtained for compara- tives and superlatives. In the same/different comparison, different was in- terpreted as "different items which have the same features (attributes)." Palermo (1973) replicated the findings of Donaldson's studies using the two terms more and less for both discrete and continuous substances. Even at the age of seven, some children were found that had not yet differentiated between more and less. He provided further support of the findings by use of semantic differential techniques. Summary. Most current theories emphasize the importance of</page><page sequence="35">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 89 semantics, which is becoming a central issue in the study of behavior gen- erally. (See, for example, Tulving &amp; Donaldson, 1972.) Nevertheless, theories are in conflict as to the role semantics plays in relation to syntac- tical development. The evidence appears to indicate that phonological, syn- tactic, and semantic levels of analysis are highly interrelated, and language facility is clearly correlated with cognitive development (Palermo &amp; Mol- fese, 1972). Not to be neglected for consideration are provocative studies and theories by Bransford, Barclay, and Franks (1972), Bransford and Franks (1970; 1971), Franks (1971), and Franks and Bransford (1971; 1972) on the role of semantic organization in behavior which have yet to be applied to studies of semantic development. IV. IMPLICATIONS OF THE STUDY OF LANGUAGE FOR EDUCATION There are few aspects of education untouched by language. The renewed emphasis on the study of language and language processes on such matters as comprehension, learning from connected discourse, and organization in memory is making itself known in current explorations. (See, for example, Freedle and Carroll, 1972.) As important as these efforts are, a detailed discussion of them is beyond the scope of this review. Accordingly, only three illustrations of what appear to be important current issues are presented: (1) second-language learning, (2) the deficit-difference models of nonstandard English, and (3) language skills and reading. Hopefully, they will illustrate the ways in which the study of language is currently being related to the educational process. Second-Language Learning Emerging out of the study of processes in bilingualism is the question of when a second language ought to be taught as a part of the school's curricu- lum. In outline, Carroll (1969) suggests that there is little evidence to serve as clear guides to answers for such questions as: Do children learn a second language more easily than adults? The necessary methodology for making precise comparative studies is simply unavailable at present. The evidence must eventually come from evaluations of pragmatic programs in which teaching of two languages is attempted in the elementary school. The meager evidence currently available suggests that pronunciation is learned more easily by children than by adults; vocabulary is learned more easily by adults than children; and grammatical structures are learned at about the same rates by both groups. Aptitudes for foreign language learning can be measured (Carroll, 1969); this is a particularly important fact since it appears that not all children, even among those above average in achieve- ment, are equally facile in learning a second language (Dunkel &amp; Pillet, 1962). There are no differences in intelligence of bilinguals and monolinguals,</page><page sequence="36">90 Review of Research in Education, 2 as is sometimes supposed. The alleged differences, where they do appear, can almost always be attributed to the use of testing instruments which fail to make distinctions between different linguistic behaviors (Haugen, 1961). An advantage of early learning of a second language is that relearning at a later date may be made easier. Perhaps the most important variable af- fecting the rate of learning of a second language is the amount of time spent (Carroll, 1969). Some of the most compelling arguments for teaching a second language in the elementary school come from research on bilingual education pro- grams, which were initiated to meet the urgent requirements of school-age children from homes in which a language other than standard English is spoken. Such children are placed in a position of double jeopardy, being required to learn the traditional subject matter at the same time they are acquiring a new language, often at the expense of stamping out their native language. Under bilingual education legislation, such programs call for the use of two languages, English and another, as mediums for instruction, thus providing an opportunity for these pupils to become bilingual. They not only study the traditional curriculum but also receive instruction in English and in their own language, within the context of the history and culture of that language. A study which may well serve as a prototype of an experiment in bilin- gual education was conducted in the Montreal schools by Lambert, Just, and Segalowitz (1970). The results indicated high achievement in French, average achievement in English, and high achievement in nonlanguage sub- jects such as mathematics. A somewhat comparable experiment in the Philippines (Tucker, Otanes, &amp; Sibayan, 1970) yielded high achievement in both English and the native language without sacrificing achievement in subject matter areas. Bilingual programs in the United States have not experienced similar successes. Entwisle (1971) suggests that this difference in achievement may be due to several factors. The programs in Montreal and the Philippines were undertaken with full support of the parents and children. Only one language was spoken by all children at all times, without direct competi- tion; there was pressure on the children to learn the language in order to communicate with a monolingual teacher; and no differential rewards were offered for speaking one or the other language. Bilingual programs in the United States have not been so carefully implemented. Often, bilingual teacher aides without adequate preparation in teaching or in the subject matter areas have been employed. Time allotted to teaching in the second language has varied, with some programs devoting only a few minutes a day to instruction in the second language. Curricula, too, are not carefully considered, and the bilingual programs are often viewed as remedial opera- tions. Whatever other disadvantages accrue in view of the objective of these</page><page sequence="37">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 91 programs, a major one is that the culture of the second language fails to be objectively represented and may be either misrepresented or neglected. Clearly, these analyses suggest the need for experimental programs in which curricular, linguistic, and social factors are carefully manipulated. Evaluation must be made as carefully as in the Montreal studies, with ap- propriate controls for comparisons of results. The effects on all aspects of performance with the two languages need to be evaluated, and separate evaluation of achievement in language subjects and in nonlanguage subjects appears necessary. Finally, evaluation instruments must be tailored to the language being considered. Nonstandard English: Deficit or Difference? Departures in the use of nonstandard English from standard English in dialectal characteristics, vocabulary, and syntactical structures have been variously attributed to social conditions (primarily in the home), noise in the environment of the child, or linguistically deprived environments (Bernstein, 1960; 1961; Hess &amp; Bear, 1968; Templin, 1957). The in- terpretation of the effects of departures from standard English on cognitive ability has come to be delineated in the deficit-difference issue: advocates of the deficit position suggest that nonstandard English is related to cogni- tive impairment, while those advocating the difference position interpret the role of nonstandard English in cognitive ability as inconsequential. The deficit position has been influential in speech training (Raph, 1967) and in guiding and shaping educational practice in preschool programs (Engelmann, 1970, 1971; Bereiter &amp; Engelmann, 1966, 1968). In earlier papers Bernstein (1960, 1961) viewed nonstandard English as a restricted code with limited meanings and standard English as an elaborated code with more general or universal meanings. More recently, Bernstein (1970) has tempered his view of the restricted code as a deficit, cautioning that the distinction between restricted and elaborated codes "'has sometimes led to the erroneous conception that a restricted code can be directly equated with linguistic deprivation, linguistic deficiency, or being nonverbal [p. 26] ." In general, those taking the deficit position imply that nonstandard En- glish is an underdeveloped or substandard language. It is said not only to lead to a different "world view" but to create inadequacies in complex and abstract cognitive skills. The argument here rests on the assumption that the child when entering school must learn standard English which, because of its presumed stronger structure compared to nonstandard English, provides for greater capacity in thinking and reasoning. The methods for remediation of these deficiencies, whether implicitly or explicitly stated, in- volve changing the language of the child to facilitate his adaptation to the educational environment. Baratz (1968), Weber (1968), and Carroll (1972) have taken issue with</page><page sequence="38">92 Review of Research in Education, 2 the deficit hypothesis, arguing that a difference is not to be viewed as a def- icit, since standard usage is relative to social acceptability and not an absolute standard. Linguistically, nonstandard English is as well developed, as structured, and as grammatical as any other language. The kinds of grammatical differences between it and standard English are no more in- dicative of defects in communication potential than are the differences in grammatical structure between standard English and languages like French, German, or Russian. Neither language competence nor degree of cognitive ability is questioned by investigators taking the difference position. Rather, the child who uses nonstandard English upon entering school is said to be subjected to the requirement of learning a second or quasi-foreign lan- guage. Investigators taking the difference position realistically point to neglect- ful interpretations of the data on which the deficit position is based. In par- ticular, Labov (1970), a linguist, has demonstrated that the typical assess- ment situation places the user of nonstandard English in a position subordi- nate to the authority of the examiner. The result is an inhibition of verbal output, erroneously interpreted as a deficiency. When the power difference is minimized, the child displays fully developed linguistic patterns. Other features of the testing situation may jeopardize the performance of the user of nonstandard English. Disadvantaged black children, assessed on standard English sentences, performed more poorly than did lower class children as a whole; when they were assessed on nonstandard English sen- tences, however, their performance was significantly improved (J. C. Baratz, 1969). Few studies have made appropriate controls of such assess- ment procedures (Baratz &amp; Baratz, 1970; J. C. Baratz, 1969). Proponents of the deficit position have failed to consider cultural biases associated with the use of such standardized tests as the Templin-Darley Articulation Test and the Illinois Test of Psycholinguistic Ability when used with children from different subcultures. (For example, see Gerber and Hertel, 1969; Garvey and McFarlane, 1970; and comments on Gerber and Hertel by Holland, 1970.) In general, it must be concluded that the apparent poor performance of children who use nonstandard English is a reflection of si- tuational (testing) constraints and the demands of a particular language, rather than an indication of linguistic capabilities. New methodology is needed for experimental studies in this area. An in- novative use of the Berko (1958) task by Marwit, Marwit, and Boswell (1972) appears to hold promise for application of similar procedures to in- vestigations of language patterns used by different cultural groups. The child's (second-grade) task was to derive present, plural, possessive, and time-extension forms of a nonsense syllable. The response of white children contained more standard English forms, while black children supplied more nonstandard English forms in all but present-tense tasks. The find-</page><page sequence="39">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 93 ings indicate that black nonstandard English is a quasi-foreign language. Thus, Marwit et al. provide some additional experimental evidence that nonstandard black language is a highly structured, consistent language governed by regular grammatical rules which differ from those used by the middle-class American, rather than merely a "sloppy" version of it. (For further references, see Dillard, 1972, and Williams, 1970a.) From an educational view, the difference position implies that nonstan- dard language may indeed jeopardize the child's ability to benefit from school experience, since he must cope simultaneously with new intellectual challenges at the same time he must acquire another language form. How- ever, from the difference view it is the responsibility of education to ac- commodate these differences in the school's curriculum so that the pupil learns first through his own language system (Baratz &amp; Shuy, 1969). Subsequent instruction might be directed toward teaching the pupil the standard form without the risk of rejecting loyalty to his own language, self-incrimination because of the language he uses, or negative evaluation from others because he employs a nonstandard language form. Out of such instructional systems may eventually emerge still another bicultural model which provides for dual socialization simultaneously in the mainstream cul- ture and in the subculture (Valentine, 1971). The magnitude of the issue involved in the deficit-difference clash is documented by the appearance of two edited volumes (Williams, 1970a; Shuy, 1971) devoted largely to a discussion of these models. Despite the impressive array of scholars and arguments presented on both sides of this issue, there is little empirical evidence based on investigations which di- rectly compare predictions from the two models or directly test the deficiency-difference issue as alternative hypotheses (Williams, 1970b). Language Skills and Reading Early reviews of research in reading were made by Chall (1967), Harris (1969), Harris, Otto, and Barrett (1969), and Weintraub, Robinson, and Smith (1970). A major interdisciplinary effort in research on reading was launched through the U.S. Office of Education Project Literacy (Levin, Gibson, &amp; Gibson, 1968). An effort to summarize the extant literature on reading and its related areas, produced under the editorship of Davis, is entitled The Literature of Research in Reading with Emphasis on Models (Davis, 1971). The volume reviews approximately 850 of the most significant of the 8000 articles on reading published since 1884 which can be found in the annotated ERIC/CRIER master file. In addition, there are descriptions of 77 models related to reading, one series of which is based on language development. This effort truly suggests a field in search of a model, sufficiently so to overwhelm and beguile even the most sophisticated scholar. Unfortunately,</page><page sequence="40">94 Review of Research in Education, 2 the models presented are often little more than abstractions of existing theories in linguistics, information processing, cognitive psychology, rein- forcement theory, and perception. Attempts to integrate these models ap- pear as strained extrapolations from psychological theories to the reading process. In sharp contrast to traditional theories related to teaching the mechanics of reading (e.g., alphabet learning, phonics, decoding letters into sounds and serial processing of letters into words and words into sentences) is the current emphasis on studies of reading as they bear on an under- standing of cognitive processes. These new developments have undoubtedly been responsible for the republication of Huey's 1908 work, The Psychol- ogy and Pedagogy of Reading, in 1968 and Thorndike's (1917) article "Reading as Reasoning." F. Smith's (1971) Understanding Reading is a modern version of a similar view based on psycholinguistic analyses of reading. Among the most recent attempts to relate linguistics and psycholinguistics to reading (as well as visual perception, speech percep- tion, and information processing) are two edited volumes. In one (Levin &amp; Williams, 1970) many, though not all, of the studies reported are outgrowths of Project Literacy. The other volume, edited by Kavanagh and Mattingly (1972) is based on a research conference on the relationships be- tween speech and learning to read sponsored by the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development. In the main, a theory of reading based on developmental psycholin- guistics would be constructed around reading as a skill in which thought processes and language interact. Work on such a theory has been carried on by a number of researchers. For example, Hochberg (1970) speculates that information picked up in peripheral vision during reading guides eye move- ments (peripheral search guidance, or PSG) in accordance with the reader's hypotheses about information that must be obtained from the reading ma- terial (cognitive search guidance, or CSG). Schlesinger (1966) has used the eye-voice span as an indicator of comprehension and thus as a reflection of information processing. Brown (1970) comments that normal errors can be seen as related to progression in the reader's knowledge of the grammar. Goodman (1970) has shown that even the very young reader can benefit from reading materials that effectively provide contextual, semantic, and syntactical information rather than the somewhat trite expressiveness char- acteristically employed in preprimers devoted to building word recognition. Thorndike, in a very early article (1917), and more recently Goodman (1969), Clay (1968), Weber (1970), and Brown (1970), in independent papers, have noted that errors in reading are due more to the reader's knowledge of language, the way he processes the material, and the context provided in the written material than they are to sloppy habits, carelessness, and the like. Reading efficiency has been found to be facili-</page><page sequence="41">Di Vesta and Palermo: Language Development 95 tated by language patterns with which the reader is most familiar (Tatham, 1970; Levin &amp; Wanat, 1967). As a final example, the research emphasis has replaced the role of the printed page with the role of the reader; serial processing of letters, sounds, and words has been replaced with parallel processing based on syntactical and semantic considerations (Vanevery and Rosenberg, 1970; Cohen, 1970; Denner, 1970). The newer models based on psycholinguistics have implications for radi- cal departures from traditional teaching methods. (See, for example, Levin and Williams, 1970, and Kavanagh and Mattingly, 1972.) They suggest the necessity for early (preschool) experience with the variety and depth of lan- guage through many modes of presentation, such as story telling arid lis- tening, and on a variety of topics. Language input at a time when the child is equipped to learn the language is essential (C. A. Chomsky, 1972). In- formal instruction in reading in the home and in the early grades is ad- vocated without the usual pressures associated with school work (Bugelski, 1968). Formal instruction in such matters as phonics is not neglected but merely postponed until such time as the child has acquired some initial reading skill (Huey, 1908; Carroll, 1964; F. Smith, 1971) and has the abil- ity to profit from formal instruction. Oral reading is played down, since it encourages the development of slow reading habits. Rapid reading must be encouraged to overcome the limits of short-term memory when reading long sentences, paragraphs, and larger organizations. Evaluation is based on reading for sense rather than precise mimicry of letter, sound, or word sequences. Accordingly, errors that are syntactically or semantically appro- priate in context are not regarded as errors, a point which is treated more generally in discussions of the "cloze" procedure (Taylor, 1953; Schneyer, 1966). As Carroll (1971c) has argued, the "great debate" still centers around the order in which reading skills should be taught. The time at which this review is written appears to be a turning point in reading research. The beginnings of systematic theories are emerging from the morass of research literature. In view of statements suggesting that training in reading has not changed significantly in the past half century, there is now the possibility that the empirical bases for profound changes in training procedures may be available at the end of the next decade.
