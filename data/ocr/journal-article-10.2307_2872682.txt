<plain_text><page sequence="1">WHITMAN'S UNFINISHED QUEST FOR AN AMERICAN IDENTITY BY ROLAND HAGENBUCHLE Whitman's mode of thinking in terms of bipolar unity has been analyzed before.1 In re-examining it, I shall emphasize those literary and intellectual problems involved which, to my knowl- edge, have been largely neglected so far. Although I shall try to show how Whitman's stance permeates his whole work both with regard to style and " Weltanschauung" (the two being, in fact, inseparably linked up), my main intent is to demonstrate how the stylistic problems eventually reappear as fundamental difficulties in the poet's search for a new American identity. On the stylistic level, my concern is with the manifestation of Whitman's poetic principle in such devices as the catalogue, the paradox, the structure of movement; but also with the tension between " book-words" and things, between particularity and "ensemble," plenitude and form, direction and indirection. In describing Whitman's attempt to reconcile the antinomies of the particular and the universal, law and liberty, affirming (" Set- zung ") and negating (" Negierung"), being and non-being, I shall concentrate on the " common concrete," the triadic pattern of sexual imagery, and on the emblem. The latter guarantees both the individual integrity of existing things and " the divine rapport," joining them in an analoqia erntis of sorts. Metaphor is made little use of by Whitman (with the important exception of anthropomorphisms), since the para- digmatic substitution type in stressing quasi-identity would vio- late the self-sufficiency of objects, while the syntagmatic tension type would unduly emphasize the constitutive or symbolic func- tion of language (and thus its autonomy) in man's apprehension of reality. The emblem, by contrast, serves as a kind of provi- 1 Howard J. Waskow, Whitmnan: Exploration in Form (Chicago and London, 1966).

It is this lack of a stylistically and intellectually convincing " fusion " which also impairs the poet's search for an American identity. To create the (&lt; new man," Whitman sets out to integrate the two antagonistic halves of "the American soul": "measureless pride" (the liberty of the individual) and " love " (the law of humanity as a xvhole). How this colossal project of " the divine average'" (or demo- cratic principle) can be achieved, is never seriously explored by the poet. He rests satisfied with the suggested " skeleton" of a new identity, without trying to breathe some life into it. It is precisely at this point that Whitman's " message " becomes questionable. The union of such fundamental opposites can hardly be achieved by a mere " change of garment" or simple equation (whose cognitive value is admittedly low) ,3 the main flaw residing in the fact that the principle of bipolar unity, as used by the poet, provides no common ground on which the synthesis of the projected identity might be worked out. Nor is Whitman's attempt to shift the crux on to the reader entirely fair, even though it must be admitted that the latter finally comes into his own. When the realization of the new identity is eventually projected into an indefinite future (a time dimension already latently present in the open form of the catalogue) the quest seems to take on a purely utopian character. 2 The choice of the term "emblem" is endorsed by the poet's own usage. The term here used should help to focus attention on Whitman's idiosyncratic use of analogy in its double function of defending the Apollonian independence of the related elements and, at the same time, of effecting their Dionysian fusion. It is this antagonism between (Apollonian) consciousness and (Dionysian) being which is redeemed in the emblem, though " by curious removes " (CW IX, 419). As a result of its contradictory status the emblem approximates Whitman's ideal of the " formless simulacrum " (CW VI, 129) or suspended image.

Roland Hagenbilcele 429</page><page sequence="3">Although love might, indeed, provide the integrating force in the poet's search, Whitman's own use of the concept (both in its homo- and heterosexual variants) appears far too limited to guarantee the new identity. It cannot be denied, however, that this very failure may throw new light on the living reality of present-day American society and, at the same time, deepen our insight into the problem of human identity as such. For Walt Whitman the tabula rasa quality of the United States affords " Modern Man " (CW IX, 1) the unique chance to re-create the world-a better world this time-thus offering him the privilege to assume in the creative act a new, properly speaking, American identity (CW IX, 288).4 Just like Adam, when the animals marched by, one by one, to receive their proper names, the poet lets the world file past him to assign each object its " aboriginal name " (CW IX, 507) .' In this way he rediscovers their idiosyncrasies, too long camouflaged by con- ventional attitudes.6 Unlike Adam, however, he is not merely the giver of names; as a genuine wroplql, he feels at one with what he creates. Hence, Whitman's attempt to establish a new relation- ship with reality rests on two premises. On he one hand, he wants to experience and appreciate each individual thing in its par- ticularity (Emerson's " centrality of things"): "all sacredness is in the individual "; 7 on the other, his urge to identify himself with the objects makes him demand that " all must have reference to the ensemble of the world" (CW IX, 386) and be ultimately fused into the universe as an integral whole (Emerson's " eva- 'On naming as an act of self-identification cf. An American Primer by Walt Whitman, ed. Horace Traubel (Boston, 1904), p. 34. 'This comparison was (in a somewhat different context) first used by George Santayana, Interpretations of Poetry and Religion (New York, 1900), p. 178. Note also, by way of contrasts Mallarme's abhorrence of naming things which, in his eyes, largely destroys the enjoyment of a poem. His demand for suggestiveness, however, is comparable to Whitman's insistence on " indirection " and " drift," though with the important difference that, for Mallarme, the " mystic cipher " is an element of language, rather than of objects. 6 Leaves of Grass is, of course, a revolt against feudalism and sentimentalism (CW I, %037-88), the " weeds and chaff " of the English literary tradition, then prevalent in the United States (An American Primer, p. 29). What is sometimes overlooked, is the fact that it is, at the same time, directed against the utilitarian mode of existence in American society itself. For a comparison of Whitman's concept of democracy with the social realities of his time, see Alan Trachtenberg's introductory essay in Democratic Vistas: 1860-1880, The American Culture Series IV (New York, 1970), pp. 1-32.

It is hardly surprising, therefore, that all reality is Janus-faced: " World of the real-world of the twain in one " (CW IX, 4528). The poet's approach is thus both Apollonian and Dionysian, not unlike the two modes of seeing nature as both " atomised" and " ensphered" which Emerson finds in " proximate " and distant vision.8 Indeed, Whitman's fresh outlook " from an American point of view" (CW IX, 19) is largely based on Emerson's bipolar unity of " Me " and "c Not- Me." ' His occasional efforts to belittle the philosopher's impact on his poetry must be understood in the light of his claim to complete originality as a poet-itself another Emersonian tenet (CW IV, 69). Whitman's conception of reality (and, for that matter, Emer- son's transcendentalism) presents a dilemma which is evident throughout his work and largely determines the poet's ambiguous attitude towards his medium. Traditional poetic diction, metre, and verse " sugar'd in rhyme" (CW IX, 202) must needs be discarded, biblical language providing an unassailable precedents Ultimately, however, so as not to violate the integrity of objects, he would like to get rid of language altogether: " A perfect user of words uses things." 1 Ideally, poems ought to be " act poems " (CW IX, 93), and "c words should be able . . . to make the male and female act, procreate."' 2 This demand on tle potency 8 Cf. Sherman Paul, Emerson's Angle of Vision (Cambridge, Mass., 1962), pp. 71-84. The far-reaching literary and philosophical implications of Whitman's transcendental stance are explored by Howard J. Waskow, pp. 23-69. 10 Cf. Milton's somewhat different arguments in his prefatory notes on verse in Paradise Lost. If Whitman even discards " apt numbers " and " fit quantity of syllables," this " Freedom from all laws " and " formules " (CW IX, 155) reflects his strongly anthropoeentric and subjectivist world picture: " The rule . . . of poetry will always be not Nature but Man " (CW VIII, 485). Milton, by contrast, still keeps a (somewhat precarious) balance. Cf. Roland HagenbUchle, Siindenfall und Wahlfreiheit in Mittons 'Paradise Lost,' Swiss Studies in English no. 59 (Bern, 1967), pp. 133-41. 'L An American Primer, p. 14. The " magic" (power and danger!) of names is of a twofold nature. As " simple words " they present reality in a clear and distinct way, naked, as it were; at the same time, they pour " a flood through the soul," since, in naming the things themselves, they evoke the general power and awe which emanates from " undraped " nature. 12 An American Primer, p. 16. Characteristically, Whitman does not consider language as a distinctive phenomenon of its own but rather as a duplicate of reality, because the latter still has unquestioned priority. Mallarme', a decade later on, will demand that words become separate as music does. The growing confidence in language as a medium sui generis is, however, dearly paid for by the concomitant loss of union with the phenomenal world. Whereas Whitman's poetry is (what we shall Roland Hagenbiichle 431</page><page sequence="5">of words (reminiscent of Emerson's dictum: " words are things," statements actions) goes even beyond Coleridge's definition of the imagination as " a repetition in the finites mind of the eternal act of creation in the infinite I AM." It is, in fact, precisely the term " finite " which is alien to Whitman's mode of thinking, as will be discussed later on. In any case, the object language of Laputa is hardly a feasible instrument for a poet who is con- vinced of his self-assumed mission as a prophet of modern man. In closest approximation to the language of objects it is, quite logically, the single word which offers itself as the basic linguistic unit to the poet striking up " for a New World " (CW IX, 16). As a some-time printer, Whitman must have had a professional eye for the single word. It best fulfills the poet's demand for a simple, clear, and " perfectly transparent, plate-glassy style." 13 The single word is most apt to bridge the gulf between the experiencing subject and the object, thus bringing together " the axis of vision" with "&lt;the axis of things."" This explains his incessant search for self-sufficient words, "simple as grass " (CW IX, 73). It likewise accounts for his interest in "aboriginal" words, and in etymologies as a means to undercut language, as it were, and reach reality itself. "CA vexatious matter this of names" (CW VII, 247), and a lifelong concern (a concern, moreover, which he shares with Emily Dickinson although, char- acteristically, her preoccupation was with the dictionary, not the spoken word) . Single but " true words " (CW IX, 9221), so Whitman feels, are not only best fitted to guarantee the integrity of objects but also to elicit the archetypal pattern " lurking " in things (CW IX, 8). Herein, Whitman anticipates certain objec- tives of the Expressionist movement which, in similar rebellion against traditional aesthetics, sought to uncover the inner form call) emblematic in the sense that it claims to unveil some truth hidden in things, Mallarme6s is legitimately called symbolist, because it creates within the realm of language an " univers poetique " of its own. ' Notes and Fragmests, ed. R. M. Burke (London, 1899), p. 170. '4 Cf. Sherman Paul, p. 71. It indeed appears that the sentence (in predicating certain qualities of the subject) splits a totality up into its components. The word, by contrast, is less (explicitly) determinate and normally makes no judgments which might falsify our spontaneous relationship to things. Certain philosophers (Heidegger among them) also seem to have a predilection for the word as a unit. Words, according to Heidegger, best mediate the original identity between human thinking and being. The unit of speech for him is therefore the word, not the sentence. He calls the subject of a sentence (Satz-Subjekt) an unfortunate grammatical category (eine " fatale grammatische Kategorie"). 432 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="6">(cf. titles such as " der Vater," " das Kind," etc.), while at the same time attempting to regain the original potential inherent in words. This quest for the universal is, of course, evident through- out Whitman's work. Suffice it to mention the signal lack of descriptive features in general and of facial features in particular, the conspicuous absence of flowers '5 (in contrast to the virtual omnipresence of the non-particularized " grass "), and, on the syntactical level, the frequent use of non-finite verb forms. (Where Whitman has a predilection for present participles, func- tioning as both time-expanders and intensifiers, Dickinson pre- fers the endingless form of the third person singular to express the " granitic base " or universality of being.) The posited superi- ority of naming things to describing things, like that of photo- graphy to painting,'6 is in itself a kind of phenomenological reduction in search for " essences " (CW IX, 344, etc.) or, what Whitman calls, " the common concrete" (CW IV, 69) -the latter being a felicitous expression for the poet's desire to fuse the particular with the universal. Deprived, as he was, of the use of those never-failing, " sub- stantial words which are in the ground and sea " (CW IX, 219), even the most powerful terms could, at best, only re-present reality, producing " merely pictures " (CW IX, 103). These seemingly unsophisticated, clear-cut little poems, best instanced by " A Farn Picture," associate Whitman, at least partially, with the artistic concepts of Imagism and with Japanese Haiku poetry, which would appear to be the last step before falling silent alto- gether.'7 Still, little pictures with their emphasis on close or "C atomistic" vision (as opposed to " vista") "' could hardly satisfy a poet whose declared aim it was to embody the world 15 There are, of course, some signal exceptions where flowers are used as emblems, such as the lilac or, more rarely, roses and lilies, etc. 16 This holds good as long as particularity is in the focus. But since, on the other hand, reality only becomes " real " if touched by emotion, Whitman also has to maintain the opposite view (CW VIII, 419). 17 For an acute analysis of Whitman's imagist features, see Waskow, pp. 105-13. It is significant, however, that even these imagistic poems frequently show the " optical democracy " of distant vision. " A Farm Picture " is particularly instructive in this respect, because in 1871 the poem was rounded off by a third line: "And haze and Vista, and the far horizon fading away " (CW IX, 274). The Apollonian element of concrete individuality is eventually set off against the Dionysian desire for " ensemble "-nature (as Emerson would have put it) both " ensphered " and " atomised." Note also in this connection the occasional juxtaposition of " recess " and " vista." Roland Hagenbilchle 433</page><page sequence="7">in its totality, "Holding the universe with all its parts as one" (CW IX, 514). To consummate his colossal project, Whitman, not knowing " the word final " (CW IX, 262) ,'" is forced "to pile the words of the earth" (CW IX, 1245) in kaleidoscopic "negligent lists" (CW IX, 103). Not unlike Milton, he thus creates a visionary atmosphere, adequate to his prophetic ambition. In presenting vast, space-creating panoramic " vistas," the catalogue achieves that equalizing synthesis and fusing synopsis which Emerson attributes to " the optical demo- cracy" of distant vision. The artistic impulse for cumulation, moreover, responds to his deep-rooted need for motion. Contrary to the poetic stasis of his contemporaries, Whitman hurls him- self into the world or lets it pass by in grand but orderly proces- sion-" The universe " itself being " a procession with measured and perfect motion'" (CW IX, 98). The centripetal movement of things, "To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow" (CW IX, 47), exhibits Whitman as the focal center of creation for whose benefit the universe exists. As such he appears as the "loitering" observer who looks and listens on all sides in " centripetal isolation a (CW VIII, 391), " filtering " all the sense data through his con- sciousness (CW IX, 30), in thisc "receptive" and, so to speak, female role (the objects occasionally " sting" him) the poet assumes a sort of " negative identity," not unlike Emerson who becomes a transparent eyeball: "I am nothing, I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me."20 The centrifugal direction, by contrast, often takes on the form of telluric or even cosmic voyages through time and space, expres- sive of the endless becoming of reality within the experiencing subject through the identification of the " Me " and " Not-Me ": " There was a child went forth every day, / And the first object he look'd upon, that object he became, / And that object became part of him" (CW IX, 364). Whitman considers it the poets gift and task to keep this childlike power of empathy although, at times, subject and object only seem to " tend " towards each '9 " The word final " as used in " Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking " is, of course, " death." In fact, Whitman repeatedly stresses his conviction that poems on death would be the ultima ratio of poetry. In practice, however, the terror and mystery of death is all too often reduced to a mere equation within his bipolar world model. His poetic program (if one may call it such) finds its fulfilment in Emily Dickinson's work. 20 The Works of Ralph Waldo Emerson, ed. Edward W. Emerson, 12 vols. (Boston and New York, 1903-1909), I, 16. 434 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="8">other (CW IX, 44). The encounter with reality is frequently rendered in sexual imagery whose implication will be discussed later on. It often displays the triadic pattern of observation (apostrophe), imaginative identification (normally in quick suc- cession) and extrication (epistrophe). The identifications them- selves are only tentative and the contact with one element at a time accordingly short-lived. The poet compares himself to comets and meteors: " I flit through you hastily " (CW IX, 239). He just points at things or persons, touches them quickly in passing and throws them loosely from him (CW IX, 119). Even Kenneth Burke is slightly disturbed by this Whitman who is "hurrying along the open road, with a haste that troubles the thoughtful." 21 This rapid change of identities is paralleled on the syntactic level by the poet's use of analogies which normally occur in clusters and are repeatedly called in question by an introductory " may," " perhaps,&gt;" etc., or even negated altogether (CW IX, 80, 119, etc.). It should here be noted that the questioned or negated analogy has become a characteristic feature of much of modern poetry, first, because the concept of an analogia entis, together with the traditional mode of analogical perception, is dismissed as suspicious or even untenable and, second, because the focus on the uniqueness of human experience defies all attempts to describe it by means of comparisons or metaphors which would overemphasize the element of similarity (or quasi-identity) in essentially dissimilar things and experi- ences. Accordingly, the merely hypothetical " as if " type along with the negation type has achieved a sort of pre-eminent status in poets such as Wallace Stevens, Henry James but also in Faulkner and, even before, Emily Dickinson. Randall Jarrell's " and yet&gt;" tag (taken over from Stevens) serves the same function of semantic indeterminacy. Whitman's identifications, too, are rather provisionary and experimental; in fact, the change of identities, though seemingly unreserved in nature, turns out to be a mere change "'of garment" (CW IX, 67). To identify oneself with everything else seems tantamount to a refusal to get really involved, and is, as such, a kind of self-defense. Although this favorite strategy of the poet is, at first sight, quite success- ful in combing the Apollonian and Dionysian approach to 21Kenneth Burke, "Acceptance and Rejection," The Southern Review, 2 (1937), 603. Roland Hctqenbuichle 435</page><page sequence="9">reality, it appears on closer inspection slightly evasive, even deceptive.22 Whitman's cosmic gestures, " I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents " (CW IX, 61), appear somewhat operatic at times. Lines such as " The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies " (CW IX, 56) can, in fact, be traced back to prose descriptions of actual opera experiences (the one in question to a description of the opera singer Alboni). The poet himself, an enthusiastic visitor to the opera in the early fifties, later affirmed in a some- what -typical sweeping statement: " but for the opera I could never have written Leaves of Grass." 23 However this may be, it should be noticed that movement (whether centrifugal or centripetal) normally shows a linear pattern in Whitman's work. This is in marked contrast to the dialetic reversal of expansion into centroversion, which is characteristic of Emily Dickinson's work. The non-linearity of her poetry shows itself, for example, in the fact that moving objects suddenly disappear out of sight, as if swallowed up into " circumference "; among the stylistic indica- tors we may point out prepositions (e. g., beyond), prefixes (e. g., trans-), suffixes (e. g., -less), verbs (e. g., pass), absolute com- paratives, negated analogies, " foreign " adjectives and nouns (often abstracts), etc. This loss, or absence of outward reality is, however, set off by a heightened presence within the realm of consciousness. Consequently, the nonlinear form of movement is accompanied by a destruction of the normal time sequence. These " superior moments " of fulfilled time are characterized by a " druidic difference." Closely related with this ecstatic experi- ence of time and space in Emily Dickinson's poetry is the frequent use of syntagmatic (or tension) metaphors instead of paradigmatic substitution metaphors.24 As a result of the predominantly linear movement, we largely miss in Whitman's work what Rilke, later on, calls " Weltin- nenraum." This fact is, no doubt, connected with the poet's by- 22 Frederic I. Carpenter, Emerson Handbook (New York, 1953). Cf. the discussion of Kenneth Burke's defense, pp. 25 If. 23Quoted by Gay W. Allen, IWalt Whitman (Detroit, 1969), p. 56. Statements of this kind are frequent in Whitman's prose and correspondence. To quote an example: " If I had not stood bareheaded before the great poems of the past, I could not have written Leaves of Grass " (CW VIII, 721). Such a claim is, of course, flatly con- tradicted by a number of other passages as well as by his poetic practice. 24 Cf. Roland Hagenbiichle, " Precision and Indeterminacy in the Poetry of Emily Dickinson," Emerson Society Quarterly (forthcoming). 4436 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an Amenrcan Identity</page><page sequence="10">and-large undisturbed confidence in, the phenomenal world and his corresponding diffidence in the autonomy of language. The signal lack of metaphors (to which we shall revert later on) must also be understood in this context. There are moments, however, when Whitman is about to achieve a kind, of ecstatic experience of time and space, outside the linear (however grandiosely panoramic) spatio-temporal pattern: " I am a dance-play up there! the fit is whirling me fast " (CW IX, 426) and, even more so perhaps, in the following passage, from "The Sleepers ": " Now I pierce the darkness, . . . The Earth recedes from me into the night," which may be compared to Emily Dickinson's " I touched the Universe- / and back it slid-and I alone- / A speck upon a Ball- / Went out upon Circumference / Beyond the dip of Bell." 25 Still, Whitman never really transcends (" be- yond" !) reality. In fact, he is soon. back, going from bedside to bedside and identifying himself (a kind of self-protection at a remove) with the various sleepers. Whitman may " be " the dance but Emily Dickinson acts it out as experience. There are, occasionally, moments of intriguing poise, where the movement comes to a total or near standstill. The poet himself may take a short rest, and/or he may observe the slowdown (or even stoppage) of some powerful momentum as displayed, for example, by an army corps halting at some natural defile in form of a river ford or a mountain pass (CW IX, 300, 301, 305, etc.) -comparable in its arrested energy to Faulkner's description of the locomotive's " terrific nomotion " when crawling over the crest of the steep grade.20 The freezing down of movement is, of course, an important objective with many poets in their endeavour to grasp the elusiveness of actual life and to transform it into the permanent potential of an art object, though increas- ingly so since the romantic movement. It is significant, however, that in Whitman's case such moments of suspended actuality do not open up a new dimension of space and time experience as in Emily Dickinson's poetry, but merely serve as provisional stop- ping points for the mythopoeic self or life force, ready to " troop forth,' once; more, "replenished and eager to resume the 27 The letters of Emily Dickinson, ed.

In Emily Dickinson's poetry the crucial point of transition may be found in the course of the sun through the meridian at noon, the solstice in June and, more generally, in -the conversion from being into non-being (or vice versa) as experienced, for example, in spring. For her, however, the decisive discovery is that such moments of seeming poise are not only elusive but, in the last analysis, nonexistent, as the following profound observation makes clear: "When water ceases to rise-it has commenced falling. That is the law of Flood." 27 It is, mutatis mutandis, also the law of her poetry. In analyzing the structure of movement we are, moreover, struck by two apparently contradictory kinetic principles. On the one hand, Whitman shows a marked predilection for rhythmic and "measured" motion (CW IX, 98), represented first by continuous, irresistible progression (so prominent already in his early, otherwise negligible, prose) in the form of regular steps, the advance of generations and centuries (the march of progress, as it were), all denoting the poet's belief (a sort of Jamesian "Cmeliorism") 28 in the prefectibility of a universe infinitely expand- ing in time and space; there is, in fact, no limit to the "( perpetual in time and space; there is, in fact, no limit to the "perpetual transfers and promotions " of nature (CW IX, 87), nor to human development: " all goes onward and outward, nothing collapses"' (CW IX, 34), or in Emerson's words: " around every circle another can be drawn." 29 " There is no outside, no enclosing wall, no circumference to us," as Emerson asserts in his essay Circles. The tremendous difference with Emily Dickinson's " Weltbild " becomes clear if seen against the background of her admission that she inevitably has " God for a frontier." " The Amherst poet accepts the limiting finitude of her creaturely existence, whereas Whitman largely ignores it. For him, the clash between "Me" and "Not-Me" can be resolved by equation because the two prima facie contrary realms are ultimately identical. Dickin- son, by contrast, will have to find a new way to reconcile the two spheres separated by an absolute border: finitude and infinity. 27 The Letters of Emily Dickinson, ed. Thomas II.

Whitman's above mentioned predilection for order is, secondly, reflected by a symmetrically alternating motion found in the flexible raising and lowering of arms (a kind of see-saw move- ment) , the carrying forth and back of ferry-boats, or the shuttling movement of ebb and flow, all suggestive of the systole-diastole rhythm of life (Emerson's "expansion and concentration ") ,3' and, in a larger context, the universal law of the' cosmos. As such we may also find it in the working of the human mind, both as female," or " passive reception " and " male," or active conl- struction" (to use Emerson's terms), the two basic modes of human perception: affirming (" Setzung ") and negating (" Ne- gierung ") -the plus and minus signs of the paradox, as it were. The poet's alternately assuming the male and female persona is, therefore, not merely a confusion of roles as Edwin H. Miller suggests.32 Such a change of role-giver and receiver, "recipi- ent " and " constructive," male and female, father and child, father and comrade, etc.-is, in fact, basic to Whitman's poetic expression of reality experience and, in a certain way, to poetry in general, particularly since the romantic movement.33 But on the other hand, Whitman feels immensely attracted by the erratic motion of eddies or vapours, by the irregular growth of trees and the free flight of birds. This pattern, by contrast, evidently mirrors the poet's desire for individual liberty, and his belief in the self-sufficiency and integrity of particular things (despite their subservience to the universal law). The gyrating or spiral movement, finally, seems to present a synthesis of the two contradictory kinetic (and intellectual) principles. It may best be instanced by the quasi-circular pattern of the " wild dance," the law of ritual fused with the liberty of expression 31 Cf. Sherman Paul, pp. 105, 109 et passim. It must be stressed, however, that the two types of centripetal and centrifugal movement always occur successively. There is no simultaneous " contracting expansion," which might bring in a non-linear element. Cf. note 34. 32 Edwin H. Miller, Walt Whitman's Poetry, A Psychological Journey (Boston, 1968), pp. 43, 54. Miller is perfectly correct in pointing out the dangers, implied in such an arbitrary mode of self-identification. The study, despite its somewhat rigid Freudian schema, is rich in literary insights and indispensible to a deeper under- standing of Whitman's poetry.

This momentarily arrested motion in form of a " living fierce gyrating wheel " (cf. the C"revolving wheel" of Emily Dickinson's hummingbird), non-linear in its circularity and suspension of time, points toward Dickinson's concept of the internalized-eternalized "nowAd: "cir- cumference." Like the figure of the " wild dance" it expresses the synthesis of Whitman's antagonistic poetic principles, abandon to the liberty of " varied flight" on the one hand, and regained control through the restraint. of form on the other (CW VII, 195) -" The greatest trick of literary genius " (CW VIII, 759). The " indefiniteness of . . . poetry " is here "c fused in geometry's utmost exactness " (CW VII, 178). Although Yeats's "Leda and the Swan " is faintly reminiscent of the " sudden muffled sound," and "c the rushing amorous contact," Whitman's hierogamy is not the marriage between god and man but, characteristically, the conjunction of the male and female principle of the cosmos, as it were, and, accordingly, symmetrical in structure, since there is no split between "Me" and " Not-Me," finitude and infinity. Eventually, this circular movement (the circle being the " high- est, emblem in the cypher of the world," according to Emerson) may symbolize Whitman's quest for identity as an endless process of individuation within the human psyche: " To launch off with absolute faith, to sweep through the ceaseless rings and never be quiet again" (CW IX, 170). The widening circles of self- evolution seem to show a never quite, achieved tendency toward the spiral, such as we notice in " Time's spirals rounding, out of thyself" (CW IX, 461). Y But despite such terms ass 'ssoar, " in this passage Whitman comes very near Milton's cosmic metamorphosis of matter into spirit. If read as an emblem, however, it would point to the envisioned spiritualization of a basely materialistic society. That the spiral never really receives full status in Whitman's work seems connected with the poet's claim that each present moment is the sum and summit of the whole history of the cosmos (CW IX, S0). It is, of course, difficult to reconcile this tenet with the belief in perfectibility, since a superior future must necessarily down-grade the present. The spiral would, however, reconcile both claims because it shows each instant as the momentary climax of a steadily evolving universe. Whitman gets into difficulties only because he simultaneously holds that there is no better moment than the present nor even will be-in much the same way that he finds "no sweeter fat than sticks to" his "own bones" (CW IX, 47). Whitman's words might, however, also be construed to mean that each moment is a unique experience, and as such achieves a sort of maximum " satisfaction." 440 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="14">evolution " (one of the three " natal stars `" i. e., ideals) or "flight " we always feel a gravitational pull towards the horizontal (so intensely hated by Emerson), because Whitman does not so much think in terms of metamorphosis but of " fusion" or inclusion of opposites, the latter definitely favoring the principle of the circle within the circle or the globe within the globe (CW IX, 461) ?5 Now, the principle of the expanding circle (or sphere) remains essentially linear and has by no means that "dialectic " character which Sherman Paul attributes to it."6 If, furthermore, Whitman found his " dialectical " principle in the image of sexual procreation, this, too, lacks some essential features of the (Hegelian) system of dialectics, first, for its symmetrical matrix character and, second, for the fact that the synthesis (the child) does not produce out of itself a new antithesis. In fact, even here, Whitman favors the principle of inclusion: c" carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly" (CW IX, 64, 391, etc.). In this context, Whitman's use of the present participle (first pointed out by Leo Spitzer) might be interpreted as an attempt on the syntactical level to synthesize movement and stasis or, as Spitzer puts it, " to cry- stallize movement." 87 At any rate, the non-finite verb forms tend to blur the otherwise clear-cut outline of the finite, forms, thus again fusing identity and " ensemble." To sum up, the element of movement faithfully reflects the poet's dual approach to reality as well as his attempt to find a balance between the two. To emphasize the impression of totality, while at the same time reflecting the limitless variety of existence, Whitman fre- quently inserts in his " divine lists" (CW IX, 92) word-pairs of antithetical, cyclic or complementary semantic structure such as good " and " evil," " pain " and " joy,'' " body '' and "spirit "Sherman Paul, pp. 116-19. Whitman seems to find it difficult to inform the progression of the horizontal with the quality of the vertical. d Even if taken in its Platonic sense, the term " dialectic " hardly applies. Although both Emerson's predilection for the bisected line and Whitman's partiality for semantic antithesis contain a potential starting point for a dialectical movement the principle of bipolar unity as used by Whitman and Emerson is far too symmetrical (and there- fore static) in blandly asserting the ultimate identity of prima facie opposite elements, to allow the dialectical method to work. (Note that the asymmetrical division of Plato's line appears as a perfectly symmetrical bisection in Emerson's concept of "correspondence.") Moreover, both Whitman and Emerson totally disregard " con- sistency" which is hardly consonant with the dialectical method. " Leo Spitzer, Essays on English and American Literature, ed.

This propensity for semantic " symmetry" is strongly reminiscent of Emerson's own usage of pairs such as " efflux " and " influx," " ebb "and" flow," etc., a device that is ultimately linked up with his notion of God as " the Great Compensation " that (like the Oversoul) both contains and resolves all antagonism."8 Still, Whitman's favorite cumulative method-" Perhaps the best is always cumulative" (CW VII, 277) -remains necessarily inade- quate, (too commodious, Stevens would say) since even the most extended list of "the organist skipping staccato over the keys of the great organ" (CW IX, 184) must inevitably appear frag- mentary if it does not point beyond itself by virtue of an intrinsic structural principle. This should not bother him, however, since " Nature looks on all fixed-up poetry as something almost im- pertinent" (CW VII, 291). Moreover, the open (or endless) form of many of Whitman's poems evokes the time dimension of the future so dear to the poet. As in the analysis of motion, we once more find a linear expansion ad infinitum but hardly the " contracting expansion " of time (and space) so often met with in Emily Dickinson's poetry. This linearity is evidently a corollary of the principle of the endless catalogue. As an artistic device, however, it hardly lends itself to bringing about the desired fusion of opposites.39 The poet is, no doubt, aware of these problems but feels rather perplexed: " round the earth having wander'd . . . But where is what I started for so long ago?" (CW IX, 3). Nevertheless, he will go on piling up the words of the earth, hoping that the architects will appear in the future to build the house for which he can only seek to make the paths (CW IX, 456). It must be admitted, however, that the catalogue does achieve " the common concrete " at least insofar as it gives a sort of provisional supremacy to the individual object, which, through the very device of seeming endlessness, is gradually suspended because the listed elements eventually tend to cancel each other out. ""Sherman Paul, p. 99. The symmetrical element is particularly noticeable in Emerson's belief that there are two sides to every question. At the same time this stresses his tendency toward bipolarization. 8" For a different evaluation of the poetic effect of "chaotic enumeration " cf. Leo Spitzer, Essays on English and American Literature, pp. 23-25. 442. Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="16">So far, we have focused our attention on Whitman's concern with the integrity of things and his (related) use of the catalogue, considering its role for the poet's fresh experience of the " New World," while at the same time pointing out some of the stylistic problems involved. We shall now revert to an examination of the status of the object, this time, however, not " with reference " to particularity but to " ensemble " (CW IX, 23). This will provide us with a clue as to why Whitman invests things with a numinous power. "In every object," he claims, "a mystic cipher waits enfolded" (CW IX, 544). It is the privilege, even the " mandate (CW VII, 1) of the poet, to decode this " orbic language " (CW IX, 203). " He resolves all tongues into his own and bestows them upon men" (CW IX, 168). It is hardly surprising if Whitman often falls short of his own pledge to decipher the cryptography of the universe. Even Langland's " Anima " is a voiceless crea- ture, and so is Melville's whale. The poet himself assures us that (like the mystic color white) the essential odor is the odorless- ness of the atmosphere (CW IX, 29). The objects, those " beautiful" but " dumb ministers " (CW IX, 165) remain essentially inarticulate and keep the secret of existence to them- selves. "If you [objects] don't say anything, how can I say any- thing?" (CW IX, 87). Maybe, there is some truth waiting in all things, but if " Only the kernel of every object nourishes . . . who tears off the husk for you and me? " (CW IX, 153). Nobody can, not even the poet, however much he may " wrestle " with the objects, the tree being an outstanding example of his effort (CW VII, 143). It is significant that Whitman, despite his seemingly successful identifications with reality, occasionally feels "' stung " by the objects (CW IX, 104, etc.) in much the same way that Emily Dickinson does.40 This is an indirect admission not only of the 40 The Poems of Emily Dickinson, no. 348, 364, 620, etc. It is only with a great effort that Emily overcomes her dread of the robin; she feels " mangled " by the shouts of the birds, the "Yellow Gown"' of the daffodils seems to " pierce " her, and " The Brooks slam all the day." In short, nature is recklessly herself, with total unconcern for man's feelings. This radical break between "Me " and " Not-Me" (also one of Stevens' disquieting experiences) is largely alien to Whitman. Although Emerson, too, was aware of the " crack " between man and nature and found that "We are much strangers in nature as we are aliens to God," he was able to bridge the gulf between consciousness and being by means of a radical analogy correspondence which Dickinson would have been unable to accept, the ultimate reason being her different attitude towards death (or nothingness). Roland Hagenbilchle 443</page><page sequence="17">fact that "the body," the visible world in general, " baulks account" (CW IX, 94) but also of the terror inspired by the "otherness" " of outward reality and the resultant impossibility of a permanent union which would but "kill " the poet-lover (CW IX, 108). It is probably for this reason that Whitman declares: "the sun-rise would kill me, / If I could not send sun-rise out of mel" (CW IX, 54). Poetry thus becomes a defensive strategy for keeping one's identity in face of the over- powering universe: the creation is endurable for man only if he manages to negate it by recreating it within his consciousness, not, however, through mere " daguerrotyping " or repetition but through the "' image-seeking faculty . . . almost triumphing over it" (CW VIII, 419) . Here, if anywhere, is ""the eyesight proceeding from the eyesight," the hearing from the hearing, the voice from the voice which saves man from brute reality (CW IX, 715). From this angle, the poet's amorous " wrestling " with the objects is undoubtedly successful. Whitman, by alternately assuming the male and female per- sona, either aggressively " pierces the darkness " of the world womb (CW IX, 425) and untiringly tries to catch or even transfix its protean shapes (CW IX, 59) or else, playing the c female " and " receptive " part, feels "c pierced ' and " stung ' by the objects-including his own " hubb'd sting" (CW IX, 104). This latter role appears to be a variant of the "'negative capability " since it reflects the poet's attempt to " filter" all the impressions through his senses in his search for the essence of things. It is noteworthy that Wallace Stevens, too, makes use of the sexual metaphor when analyzing his relationship with reality as " a war between the mind and the sky . . . that never ends." In " The Bouquet " he speaks of " things transfixed, transpierced and well / Perceived," but at the same time he asserts:: "I must impale myself on reality." 41 The profound relationship between sex and reality experience may also have been at the back of Federico Garcia Lorca's mind when, in adapting the poet's own verses, he comments in his, "Ode to Walt Whitman ": " You cried like a bird / Whose sex is trans- fixed by a needle." 42 Emily Dickinson's similar oscillation in 41 Wallace Stevens, Opnts Posthumous, ed. Samuel Morse (New York, 1971), p. xxiv. 42 Cf. James E. Miller, Jr., "Walt Whitman and the Secret of History" in Start with the Sun, Studies in the Whitman Tradition, ed. James E. Miller, Jr., Karl Shapiro, Bernice Slote (Lincoln, Neb., 1960), p. 18. Miller is certainly right in seeing 444 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="18">her choice of sex for the poems' personae, however, is not so much traceable to her experience of reality as such but to her dialecti- cal relationship with the absolute, the most striking expression, perhaps, being her variation on Shelley's verses in Epipsychidion: " Circumference-thou Bride of Awe / Possessing thou shalt be possessed / By every hallowed Knight / That dares to covet Thee." 4 Still, Whitman's " wrestling-fight " with the " Not- Me " is not unlike Emily Dickinson's struggle with the angel-God. It is as a result of this fight that the poet finally puts on her power: "Pugilist and Poet, Jacob was correct-." " Similarly, Whitman holds God-father firmly embraced till he answers "something" (CW IX, 255) . But the only reply he can get is that of his own poetry, not some divine message transmitted through the objects, although his " Emersonian conviction " of a universal analogy in the material world would seem to entitle him to such a claim. What he can do, at best, is to have things speak their own " dialect " and to render the " message " (CW IX, 422) of the twittering bird, the hissing sea-" the eloquent dumb great mother " (CW IX, 221) -and the rustling leaves " in faint clews and indirections" (CXV IX, 8) ." Thus, the poet becomes "the compiler of dictionaries that print cannot touch" (CW IX, 224); " words are nothing, the drift is everything" (CW IX, 13). Instead of looking at the objects themselves, Whitman is here concerned with what Emerson calls " the penumbra " of things,45 since, as he points out, in order to see a star clearly, one must avoid " gazing directly " toward it but " off one side " (CW VII, 292). In giving all-importance to " drift," Whitman indirectly stresses the element of sense hidden in the phenomenal world, which Lorca's Whitman as "the symbol of agonized purity," the Apollonian Whitman, as it were. I feel (with Miller), however, that the sexual aspect does not exhaust the depth of the imagery. It is for this reason that I have made the tentative connection of sex with the reality principle. I strongly suspect, however, that there is another bird-poet to whom the metaphor of the transfixed sex would even better apply. 4 The Poems of Emily Dickinson, no. 1620. 4 The Letters of Emily Dickinson, no. 1042. For an analysis of the dialectical process involved (" I will not let thee go unless I bless thee"); cf. Roland Hagen- biichle, Emily Dickinson's Ablative Estate (a book currently in progress). " Whitman is here caught not so much between " direction and indirection " as between his belief in the self-sufficiency of things and the conflicting claim of language to the status of an autonomous power, which, if used accordingly might indeed give " faint cluws and indirections "-particularly by means of metaphors and symbols. 46 Sherman Paul, p. 83. Roland Hagenbu-chle 445</page><page sequence="19">becomes increasingly clear if one compares " drift " and "indirec- tion " to Emily Dickinson's concept of " slant " and "circuit." Although both Whitman and Emerson speak of " circuitous style," their emphasis lies on the meaning inherent in reality, whereas the Amherst poet is concerned with states of conscious- ness as such. Later poets like Wallace Stevens will discard the possibility of a meaning intrinsically belonging to objects and reach out for " the thing itself." Appearance (" Erscheinung ") acquires a sense and dignity of its own. Accordingly, the un- differentiated " rock" becomes a sort of final but negative metaphor since being and appearance totally coincide: " Let be be the finale of seem." The trend towards phenomenological re- duction, powerfully launched by Whitman, is thus carried to its linguistic limits. It is characteristically above all the later Whitman, " lolling on easy seas " (CW V, 246), who occasionally assures us that he has discovered the master-key: " Come, for I have found the clew I sought so long" (CW IX, 410), commonly in form of what he calls "mind-formulas " (CW IX, 456), such as " form, union, plan . . . eternal life . . . happiness" (CW IX, 88). Yet, why reach for all-inclusive and consequently empty terms if " a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels?"' (CW IX, 59) .4 "; Mind formulas," moreover, are not only inadequate but, if not defined properly,48 dangerous semantic tools, more likely to destroy the mystery of existence, than bring it to light or, by " instructing" the eye, rouse the sense of wonder (the central characteristic of Emerson's "primary man ") . Concepts such as "c real life " (CW IX, 8, 81, etc.), c "real Union " (CW IX, 456, etc.), or even more so, " the real real" (CW IX, 461) turn out to be an implicit admission of failure, at least on the expression level. Chinese boxes and Russian Matrioshkas have always proved an excellent means of beguiling people, as Albee's Tiny Alice conclusively demonstrates. '7 There is, indeed, much to be said for Roy Harvey Pearce's claim that " we need to recover the Whitman of 1860," and not the secure literatus of soothing " mind- formulas " (The Continuity of American Poetry [Princeton, N. J., 1961] p. 59). 48 Cf. Emily Dickinson's repeated probing into the meaning of abstract terms, mainly by means of analogies which function as provisionary models or hypotheses that can be questioned and, if necessary, modified. Both poets, however, largely forego the use of paradigmatic substitution metaphors which presuppose a kind of static quasi-identity which may be the hallmark of a " heile Welt " but leaves little room for experiment. 446 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="20">It might well be rewarding to study the latent element of absurdity inherent in this semantic impasse. That this danger is largely avoided is due to the fact that, since the divine generator in the center virtually contains all the circles, the cosmic evolution (man's included) is a purposeful one, although its ends are unknown (CW VIII, 728-30, etc.). If, on the other hand, this endless process guarantees that man will never open the last chamber, as Emerson puts it, the " spectre " of absurdity does not seem to be lurking far behind. Wallace Stevens is, as might be expected, very much aware of this problem. In "Things of August" he examines the fact that language puts man in a self- created prison, inside an egg as it were: " The shell is a shore. The egg of the sea / And the egg of the sky are in shells, in walls, in skins / And the egg of the earth lies deep within an egg. / Spread outward. Crack the round dome. Break through." His antidote is the disinterested (phenomenological) and " a- moral" seach for the " res itself," " In the space of horizons that neither love nor hate." Behind Whitman's approach is, of course, the (Emersonian) principle of " the circle within the circle" (or the sphere within the sphere) both in its expanding and contracting variant (God being the centripetal force in contrast to man's self-evolving circles). The same principle, in virtue of its structural similarity, is at the basis of both Emerson's and Whitman's use of analogy: " Me" and "'Not-Me'" correspond in much the same way as the eye (or first circle) and the horizon (or second circle). The principle of concentric circles also plays an important role in Hawthorne's style. It is very often through successively con- tracting circles that he gets to the (symbolically loaded) center of the action. In The Custom House, for example, the movement is from the wider circle of reality to the "narrow circle of fiction "; many decisive scenes or important places are built up in concentric circles (The Scarlet Letter providing some striking examples; but consider also descriptions such as the garden in The House of the Seven Gables or the tower in The Marble Faun). The principle of the circle is obviously connected with Hawthorne's idea of the symbolical as such. In order to transcend the merely allegorical or emblematical, Hawthorne tries to charge things, persons or places with a power (of sanctity or evil) that seems to emanate in magic circles around the object in question. In other words, he attempts to reach the " invisible center " of Roland Hagenbuichle 447</page><page sequence="21">which " the visible " is, according to Emerson, " the Terminus or the circumference." It is this inner circle of pure potentiality, as heightened presence of the past, especially some past act, which distinguishes the symbol in its quasi-mystic participation in a reality of a different order from allegory and emblem. (Whether his not infrequent attempt to change the status of the allegorical or emblematical into the symbolical by merely putting the one-to-one correspondence in question and replacing it by some sort of multiple relationship is successful remains doubtful.) Is it, finally, not somewhat surprising that the concept of the bipolar unity finds its expression in the circle and not the ellipsis which, with its two focal centers, would appear to be the ideal geometrical representation? 4 The reason is evidently the radical similarity between the various circular (or spherical) shapes which lends itself so easily to the practice of identification and inclusion. Still, the circle has not only an element of the (emblematically) ideal but also of the simplistic, if compared to the intriguing form of the ellipsis which changes its direction in each point of the curve. (Milton's ideal of beauty is, character- istically, eccentric.) 50 Whitman's peculiar use of antithesis (as asyndetic or coordi- nating opposition of single words, word-groups or phrases) has already been pointed out in the stylistic analysis of his catalogues. We shall now direct our attention to the cognitive function of this poetic device. The syntactically loose array of contradictory morphemes may be considered a preliminary (or posterior) stage of metaphorical expression. The antagonistic lexical elements still confront each other as independent units without affording overlapping semantic spheres which might open up the way to a further exploration of human experience. As it is, we are merely left with a choice, either to accept the contradictory terms as inevitable antinomies of life, or else tacitly to assume an ultimate identity, thus treating the seemingly adverse lexical units just 4 It is probably more than mere chance that Schiller among others, who tried to find some common ground between the seemingly incompatible realms, prefers the ellipsis to the circle. " Roland HagenbUchle, Miltons 'Paradise Lost' p. 54. The element of "eccentricity" is, of course, very conspicuous in the works of both Whitman and Emerson. How- ever, it is still symptomatic that the two realms of order and disorder have not found a synthesis of some sort, but only an equational coexistence. 448 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="22">like positive and negative mathematical quantities (denoting, in the last analysis, being and non-being)." Whitman's assertion, " the one I sing / (One, yet of contradictions made)" (CW IX, 13), makes it plain that both alternatives will be found in his work; indeed, they must coexist. The (patently Emersonian) protestation " let contradictions prevail! let one thing contradict another! and let one line of my poems contradict another!" (CW IX, 591) emphasizes the inviolable integrity of all existing things (including mental concepts), while at the same time stressing the paradoxical character of reality; on the other hand, the poet incessantly affirms that these contradictions are only apparent: "if the body were not the soul, what is the soul?" (CW IX, 94). Body and soul, death and life, indeed, "all this multifarious mad chaos . . . we call the world" (CW VII, 258) is ultimately an indissoluble " organic compact" (CW IX, 349), the " many in one " (CW IX, 402). Such a drastic reduction of complex reality as the result of an act of faith or a mystical experience must, no doubt, be honored and respected; as a poetical (or philosophical) interpretation of existence it is, in this form at least, hardly satisfactory. Frederic I. Carpenter believes that the criticism of equivalence or ambivalence levelled against Emerson (and Whitman) has been answered by Kenneth Burke's essay "Acceptance and Rejection." 52 I am not so sure. If Emerson allegedly avoids the danger of simplistic antithesis or equation by claiming that " The soul is not a compensation but a life. The soul is," if, in other words, "being is the vast affirmative excluding negation, self- balanced and swallowing up all relations," one might legitimately ask whether non-being is not simply overlooked. It seems to me that Emerson's bipolar unity is, in fact, based on this final reduction of being and non-being to being, good and whole, with the former obviously as the sole survivor of the pair. How characteristic that for Emily Dickinson "'No' is the wildest word we consign to language," 53 whereas for Emerson (and Whitman) it is " yes," " the affirmative of affirmatives," but only after a preceding elimination of "no " (or non-being) which, however, occasionally looms up in Whitman's poetry as "the " Cf. Denis Donaghue, Connoisseurs of Chaos (New York, 1965), pp. 924-80. 2 Kenneth Burke, "Acceptance and Rejection," pp. 600-32. 5 The Letters of Emily Dickinson, no. 562.

And yet, it is this very experience of " annihilation" that gives man a sense of his limitations or, what Kenneth Burke calls a " proper in- gredient of ' Entsagen ' " (renunciation) ." Whitman's predilection for paradoxes would, furthermore, seem to indicate that, at least on the level of expression, the " One" (or middle ground) he is looking for has not been found, despite his repeated claims to the contrary. (Another stylistic indicator would be the overall lack of metaphorical language.) We have already noted that the paradox (and Whitman's use of antithesis in general) frequently shows a symmetrical relationship between the terms in question which, even from an epistemological point of view, has a rather low cognitive value.55 Emily Dickinson's profound probing into the mystery of existence, by contrast, makes extensive use of what she herself calls the principle of " slant.-" Slant or asymmetry (in metaphors or otherwise) offers infinitely more " drift " and " indirection " than direct opposition ever can. It must be taken into account, however, that the device of the catalogue as such also implies a certain element of slantness. Time and again, Whitman stresses the analogical structure of creation: " A vast similitude interlocks all " (CW IX, 88). The same old law that works in all objects, animate and inanimate, reigns also in him, although " it is without a name " (CW IX, 88). Because everything refers to everything else, anything can make a "c hub for the wheel'd universe " (CW IX, 86). Thus, to the poet every object can function as an objective correlative (or, as Emerson puts it: " In the transmission of the heavenly waters, every hose fits every hydrant ") . This is precisely how Whitman understands himself: " America isolated yet embodying all, what is it finally except myself." The poet's identity "though but " One could, of course, argue that non-being is not so much eliminated but simply suspended as complementary to being. There are, indeed, several passages that lend themselves to this view. However, Whitman's work as a whole seems to me to exclude such an interpretation. The principle of complementarity is, in the end, almost always given up for the monistic concept of being-the " mind-formulas " being a typical example. But even if the prevalence of the complementarity principle could be established, the reductive element of symmetry would still present a serious problem. Cf. Gerald Holton, " The Roots of Complementarity " in The Twentieth Century Series, Studies in the Biography of Ideas, ed. G. HIolton (New York, 1972), p. 382- 422 (esp. p. 416). " Cf.

The element of personal smallness, verging on nothingness ("but a point") in the confrontation with the " Not-Me" is likewise found in both Emerson and Dickinson. Emerson's well-known passage on the transparent eyeball shows a dialectical principle at work (or, at least, its results): " I become a transparent eyeball; I see all; the currents of the Universal Being circulate through me; I am part or particle of God." Once the negative identity is achieved, a reversal takes place, and man's emptiness is filled with the absolute. This reversal can even more clearly be seen in Emily Dickinson's verse: " Annihilation-plated fresh / With Im- mortality-." 56 The last stage, according to her, is man's achieve- ment of " Finite Infinity." 5 Now, whereas Emily's wrestling with the absolute in her quest for identity reveals itself as a dialectical process, Whitman's is basically a static equation: "Well do they do their jobs those journeymen divine . . . I reckon I am their boss and they make me a pet besides" (CW IX, 426). Although this might be the starting point for a more complex relationship, he prefers to play a secure double role. How smug and self-complacent appears Whitman's stance if compared to Emily Dickinson's tormented yearning for the place of " the best girl" at her " Master's " breast, expressive of her agonizing confrontation with infinity.58 If, as a result of his propensity for sympathetic correspondence, Whitman is occasionally labelled a mystic, this is admissible only in terms of a horizontal, as opposed to the vertical (or God- 56 The Poems of Enmily Dickinson, no. 705.

Movement alone (in particular of the linear type) is hardly sufficient to render a piece of art dynamic. A poet such as Emily Dickinson, although not indulging in Whitman's telluric and cosmic gestures, displays an incredible dynamism on the vertical or psycho-intellectual level; by recreating Whitman's panoramic vistas as " Weltinnenraum " within her own consciousness, she by far transcends the spatio-temporal experience of the former. As a poet of crisis (the romantic inheritance is obvious) she will not have recourse to saving " mind-formulas " but explores the abyss of consciousness in the ecstastic experience of "druidic difference " and in her painful probing into the status of non-being.

In that poem, too, everything corresponds to everything else. Whitman, however, seems to lack Baudelaire's trust in the language as a medium sai generis. Since his confidence in the self-expressive- ness of reality is, by and large, still unshaken, literature has not yet assumed the importance of an autonomous domain, capable of establishing a referential network of its own. To Whitman, therefore, literature qua literature is transient: "poems distill'd from poems pass away " (CW IX, 350). (This might also be taken to mean, however, that the poet, in search for authenticity, refuses to make use of " a paint mixed by another person," 60 thereby showing his dislike for pre-worded experience in general and literary tradition in particular) ." Whitman, accordingly, warns us that an aesthetic approach alone cannot really touch the essential body of his work. The refusal to be judged according to established literary criteria is accompanied by the claim that his book transcends literature as such and, in reaching out for existential reality, bridges the gap between words and things, aesthetics and ethics, life and fiction: The American Muse is finally " install'd amid the kitchenware! " (CW IX, 195). Be- cause Whitman is convinced of his " mandate " (CW VII, 1) as the chosen prophet of the " new religion " (CW IX, 445), the poet's self-expression in " the blood smudged little note-books " (CW I, 1) and in Leaves of Grass acquires the sanctity of a divine message. Poetry takes on the dignity of a religion with the poet as its priest, " The true son of God . . . singing his songs" (CW IX, 415). Characteristically, this romantic Emer- sonian claim finds a non-messianic, personalized and internalized expression in Emily Dickinson's self-description as "Queen of Calvary." Whitman, in turn, would have considered this " sepa- " The term " horizontal mysticism " is here used to denote the pantheistic "hen kai pan" feeling where, on the basis of some immanent godlike (though impersonal) power man, as microcosm or entelechy, is able to identify everything with everything else as well as with himself. Cf. Roy Harvey Pearce, p. 44. 60 The Letters of Emily Dickinson, no. 271. 61 Both Whitman and Dickinson know, however, that " true poems flee " (poem no. 1472). Concerning the problem of pre-worded experience cf. Ernst Leisi, " Sprachliche Vorwegnahme-ein Aspekt unserer Kultur " in the Literary Supplement of the Neue Zilrcher Zeitung, 16 Jan. 1972, no. 25 (Fernausgabe no. 15). 4592 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="26">rate look" on one's own " crucifixion" a definite " mistake" (CW IX, 72), because he does not want to act out one particular role, let alone that of the suffering God or self. Although he, too, identifies with Christ's agony for a moment, his sympathy is with the risen Messiah, "corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me," and he quickly changes into the mythopoeic role: cI troop forth replenish'd with supreme power, one of an average unending procession " (CW IX, 72). Whitman's contention for the religious status of poetry is lastly connected with his new relationship to reality which, the poet asserts, " only becomes real when touched by emotion" (CW VIII, 404). The Apollonian " purity without religious sentiment," that "cynical-clear, MAinerva-like quality, is for the aesthetic sense alone,"&gt; not for " the religious sense, the varied All . . . full of . . . mystery (CW VII, 174). But even this religious emotion could not transform the objects into their essential reality, if "s Facts " xere not " showered over with light "I (CW VIII, 449), or, as Emerson puts it in his essay on " Nature," if "natural facts" were not " symbols (in our terminology: emblems) of particular spiritual facts." 62 Poetry is religion (in the etymological sense of the word), is indeed " the great Bible " destined to reunite heaven and earth because it reveals the " golden chain " between man and nature. If, for Whitman, the religious emotion (or emotional love) is in turn transcended by the sovereign power of " the lord," " the sun . . . right, justice, truth," this does not denote a return of the Apollonian-Dionysian movements to its origin, but reflects the central correspondence, the sun being both an emblem and a final spiritual reality: "Its analogy in the material world is what holds together this world" (CW VIII, 415). Obviously, all " world pictures " (whether metaphorical or not) are of necessity heliocentric 63 because "; We see Comparatively d 61 (i. e., in analogies of one sort or another) or, to use Emerson's words, because " Man is an analogist." Even for the " iconoclastic " Stevens " the colossal sun ' and its course still provides the final point of fixity (" Not ideas about the Thing but the Thing Itself "). 62 Vasco Ronchi, Optics, The Science of Vision, tr.

Roland Hagenbuichle 453</page><page sequence="27">Although the self-sufficiency of things may still be a source of consolation to, Whitman the man, it is, manifestly, a constant cause of uncertainty and doubt to the poet, because the value of language, the writer's proper instrument, is called in question. No wonder, that he begins to see " little or nothing in audible words" (CW IX, 224). " If you would understand me," he urges, " go to the height or watershore, / The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of the waves a key" (CW IX, 85) . Again, the poet seems to refute pre-worded (or literary) experience as inauthentic. As he himself would leave the lecture of " The learn'd Astronomer " in disgust, to look at the stars in solitude and silence (CW IX, 271), so he would have us look at the objects directly without the screening medium of language. Just as modern poets try to rescind the existence of the poem as a fixed artifact (particularly by means of the suspended image), Whitman tends to, annul his own creation: " He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher" (CW IX, 84). Because he feels unable to achieve this effect within language, he has to reject the medium as such.65 His distrust in the autonom- ous power of language obviously disqualifies him as a forerunner of the Symbolist movement.66 As a result, his best poems develop the analogia entis not so much metaphorically or symbolically but, as will now be shown, emblematically. The use of the morpheme, "grass " displays Whitman's " emble- matic thinking" directly at work. "A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands " (CW IX, 33). The poet starts with the grass in its concrete existence. This question " W1hat is the grass? " is thus identical with the question: what is reality? To give an answer, the poet is hardly better qualified than the child. He, therefore, tries to relate the object " grass" to other objects, a technique which he describes in the poem 65 The reader might, in fact, start wondering why he should read Whitman's poetry in the first place. Obviously, it is the poet's aim to get him out of the rut, out of the "horizontal" routine, that "ground line of familiar facts," as Emerson called it. Still, if the teacher himself capitulates before the " riddle " of things (CW IX, 476-78), unable to word his experience, the didactic stance (however provisionally assumed) is in danger of becoming a pose. 66 This is not necessarily in contradiction to Feidelson's attempt to classify Whitman as a symbolist, since his use of the term carries a much wider meaning, almost synonymous with the symbolic mode of language and, according to Cassirer, of human existence as such. See Charles Feidelson, Jr., Symbolism and American Literature (Chicago, 1953), pp. 44-76. 454 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="28">"A Noiseless Patient Spider." Whitman, accordingly starts out with a series of tentative analogies. "I guess it must be the flag of my disposition out of hopeful green stuff woven. / Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord, / A scented gift and and remebrancer designedly dropt, / Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners . . . Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation "' (CXV IX, 34). What deserves consideration is the fact that the objects mentioned for comparisons are themselves analogically determined in their signification and can thus function as emblems, "Bearing the owner's name someway in the corners " (CW IX, 33). It is for this reason that the objects " call from diffusion " the poet's " meanings and give them shape " (CW IX, 150). The analogical correspondence is thus based on a sort of secularized analogia entis which in turn is the result of the poet's vision: Whitman finds "letters from God " all over the place, "'and every one is sign'd by God's name" (CW IX, 87). Emily Dickinson, too, gets " Bulletins all Day / From Immor- tality," but with the important difference, that these "Bulletins" reach her directly in " the soul's superior instants" of ecstatic experience, not, as in Whitman's case, via the message of the objects " signed by God." (It is in this sense that " the world," i. e., the objects of the universe, " never wrote " to her.) Whitman then conjectures that the grass might be a " uniform hiero- glyphic / And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones, Growing among black folks as among white, / Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff " (CW IX, 34). In its omnipresence the grass represents " the democratic principle " (CW VIII, 390), the poet's concept of a new form of society. Later on " it seems . . . the beautiful uncut hair of graves . . maybe from the breasts of young men . . . maybe . . . from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers' laps, / And here you are the mothers' laps" (CW IX, 34). The final metaphor actually transcends literary trope since the poet as- sumes total identity. It is for this reason that the preceding cluster of tentative analogies can function as hieroglyphs or emblems, representing the " perceptible analogies " of " external nature" (CW VIII, 251). If the poet first affects to be unable to decipher these emblems, he (at least partly) wants to involve the reader by engaging his help: "What do you think has become of the young and old men?" The initial inquiry into the Roland Hagenbui-cle 455</page><page sequence="29">nature of the grass, i. e., of life, is thus mirrored by the question: what is death? Eventually, the grass turns into " uttering tongues "-his own poems growing directly out of the earth, as it were-which now disclose the general tenor of the whole pas- sage: "The smallest sprout shows there is really no death, / And if ever there was, it led forward life . . . All goes onward and outward" (CW IX, 34-35). The somewhat didactic con- clusion ends on a triumphant note which turns the previous uncertaintly of the passage into ultimate certitude: the anti- nomies of life and death are only apparent, the latter being merely a constituent of the endless process of life. Like Isaiah Whitman might say: All grass is flesh.7 Unlike that prophet, however, he does not lament the transience of life but reasserts the recurring cycle of existence. Whereas Emerson's questions: " But is there no intent of an analogy between man's life and the seasons? " is answered by Whitman with an unqualified " yes," the redeeming analogy would be as categorically denied by Emily Dickinson. For her the rift between man and nature, consciousness and being is irreconcilable: " We pass and she [i. e., nature] abides." 68 The different relationship between subject and object, " Me " and " Not-Me " is one of the crucial features that separates the two poets. Whereas Whitman feels able, by and large, to identify himself with the objects, be it in an animistic or empathetic way, Emily Dickinson recognizes that "Perception of an Object / Costs precise the Object's loss." 69 As a result, the principle of analogy, widely used by both, fulfills quite diverse functions in their poetry. For Emily it serves as a kind of model or hypothesis, to circle around the mystery of life and death. For Whitman (as for Emerson), however, analogy is both spiritual and material: it is the sovereign power that holds this world together (CW VIII, 415). That is why "the ductile anchor" and the gossamer thread" flung out by his soul to explore "the vacant vast" (by means of analogies) are bound to catch and hold " somewhere " (CW IX, 450); in other words, the tentative analogies become reliable emblems. Accordingly, the imaginative leap into identification will always be safe. It cannot be denied, 67 The comparison was first made by Gay W. Allen (p. 75). He makes no reference to the problem of analogy, however, between man and the seasons. 68 The Poems of Emily Dickinson no. 811. 69 The Poems of Emily Dickinson, no. 1071. 456 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="30">however, that the provisionary status of many of XVhitman's analogies as well as his use of negated analogy is an unmis- takable indication of some underlying current of insecurity which, periodically, comes to the surface in his work (though less so in the poems of his later period). At such moments, -the securely emblematic status of the universe is threatened by " the spectre of world destruction " (CW VII, 9258), the poet feels menaced by " the fierce enigmas " of the phenomenal world and he is " cut by the bitter and angry hail " of " Being," or rather non-being (the connection with death is explicitly made) , that " puzzle of puzzles" (CW IX, 56). It is precisely in those passages where the identification of being and non-being seems shaken, that Whitman comes nearest to a symbolical mode of expression. However, he normally quickly retreats from this abyss and resumes his usual stance of secure identification through the defensive strategy of the bipolar unity. That Whitman's mode of thinking is emblematic and not symbolic, further reveals itself in his use of the sea as one of the central images in Leaves of Grass. The sea, " that vast paradox," fulfills (like the night) the dual role of the mater magna as creator and destroyer. As a life-giving principle she appears in the image of the "cradle endlessly rocking" (CW IX, 9246), though, at the same time, putting all life to sleep. But then she is also personified as a " fierce old mother," tossing her serpentlike fingers for the solid land (life), whispering "the word . . . of all songs" death (CW IX, 9253). Like the grass, the leaves, or the clouds, the sea embodies the eternal rhythm of life and death, " influx and efflux " (CA IX, 50) and ultimately the paradoxical structure of existence itself, encom- passing both love and hate, good and evil. The sea-shore, in particular, "that suggesting, dividing line . . . the solid marry- ing the liquid . . . blending the real and ideal, and each made portion of the other" (CW VII, 138-39), engages the poet's interest. Like the " half-tints " of dusk (CW VII, 473) ,the mystic "chiaroscuro" (CW VII, 183), the palpable yet elusive odor or, even more overtly so, music and " vista," the shore line (com- parable to Emerson's " mystic line" of contact between sky and earth) admirably lends itself as a " formless simulacrum " for Whitman's attempt to fuse the contradictory elements of his poetry. It is significant, however, that Whitman, in contrast, say, to Hawthorne's " neutral territory " (or Schiller's synthesis Roland Hagenbichle 457</page><page sequence="31">in the realm of " Schein ") is not looking for some middle ground where the real and ideal, the solid (law) and the liquid (liberty) might be reconciled. The mere borderline of contact (cf. the surface contact identification mentioned above) in form of " liquid rims and wet sands " (CW IX, 254) proves enough to cc marry " the antagonistic principles. The same line does simu- taneously divide and conjoin, not only space but also time, with the present both separating and (in the mythopoeic self) containing past and future: he is the " acme of things accom- plish'd" and " the encloser of things to be " (CW IX, 80) . For the same reason, the contact between the grass and the graves brings about a total identification: the grass finally "is " the dead themselves. For Whitman (as for Hawthorne and later Faulkner) the past is never dead, it lives on in the present and into the future. Still, the poet's method of converting contact into identity leaves hardly any common ground to work out the intended synthesis between the paradoxical elements of existence. It can probably only be achieved on that "c neutral territory" where the absence of the actual gains a heightened presence within the " inner sphere " of consciousness It is here that the fusion of actuality and potentiality (real and ideal, life and death, etc.) be- comes possible in a state which Hawthorne calls "conscious sleep" and which has come to be the overriding concern of modern poets such as Valery, Rilke, Randall Jarrell and others. At times, the author himself feels "&lt;bubbled up " and cast ashore by "'the measureless float" like "'a trail of drift and debris (CW IX, 255), his poems being but " dripping frag- ments" (CW IX, 103) oozing out of the lips of death with "the prismatic 70 colours " of life (CW IX, 256). (In fact, many of Whitman's images are at the same time emblems of his own poetic oeuvre.) At such moments the poet seems to recognize that he, like all existence, is grounded on nothingness. Yet, the consequences of such a possibility are never really accepted, as the following passage from " The Sleepers " demonstrates: " I " Whereas Emily Dickinson's use of the word " prism " that " never held the Hues, / It only heard them play " (poem no. 1602) refers to the dividing function of con- sciousness (ef. German " Urteil "), it would seem that Whitman's adjective " prismatic " is more nearly related to Faulkner's " myriad." Dickinson's use is, however, continued by Wallace Stevens, who is deeply interested in the problem whether the " special hue " reality takes on in the eye reveals, if " seen in insight," " the facture of the thing " as such, or whether the mind can only see " parathings " (The Bouquet, part IV). 458 Whitman/s Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="32">too pass from the night, / I stay awhile away 0 night, but I return to you again . . . I do not desert her in whom I lay so long, / know not how I came of you and I know not where I go with you, but I know I came well and shall go well" (CXV IX, 433). The terror of death is redeemed by the identification of tomb and womb: "I will duly pass the day [i. e. life] 0 my mother, and duly return to you." Man born of mother returns to the " mother." But at the same time, the identification tends to eliminate our awe before the mystery of death. Here again, the frequent personifications and antithetical epithets often re- duce the unfathomable potential of the sea as a symbol to a mere paradox. Whereas the latter leaves us with a binary though irreconcilable choice, the symbol confronts the reader in a totally different way. We can no longer be " saved " by a leap into the bipolar unity which contains the paradox like plus and minus signs (representing in the last analysis being and non- being). The symbol (and metaphorical expression in particular) leaves us hovering over the abyss, since the contradictory elements cannot be pinned down to an orderly array of opposites. In fact, the potentially unlimited number of connotations itself creates a kind of void, because we are never really able to touch ground. This element of uncertainty, even of terror, is alien to paradoxical expression which we still seem to be able to mani- pulate as neutralizing opposites. It is precisely for this reason that we cannot consider Whitman a symbolist, since he never really believes in the possibility of ultimate wreck. To him nothingness is not a reality per se. The "deep waters" are still the " seas of God," and the poet's " daring joy" is "safe" (CW IX, 421). l With Emerson, Whitman holds that the night is the creator of day, and nothingness but the mother of life. The language of such a world-picture is certainly emblematic 7I It is " This 'Whitman " Roy Harvery Pearce has strong reservations about: " The passage of a soul, whether it is everyman's or a saint's, is not 'safe,' however 'joyful ' " (pp. 39-40). Although I basically agree with Pearce, and although it is my claim that the secure vantage point of bipolar unity frequently reduces the symbolical potential of Whitman's poetry to the status of emblems, it must be recognized that by questioning the legitimacy of this device we necessarily question a large part of Whitman's work. I shall, moreover, not conceal the fact that I have been unable to cogently decide how far the method of Whitman's identifications (in terms of bipolar unity) is a spiritual achievement against overwhelming odds, or if it is merely a defensive strategy to avoid the last mystery of human existence, death. It may well be both. Roland Hagenbuichle 459</page><page sequence="33">rather than symbolical. At the same time, it has become clear that the principle of the paradox, and that of bipolar unity in general, implies a strongly reductive element.72 Even the image of the road or, in universalized form, the voyage-expressive of the poet's dynamic approach to reality_73 shows a strong tendency towards the emblematic style. Ulti- mately, the whole universe is conceived as a gigantic road for the soul venturing out on its perennial journey of individuation: " Of the progress of the souls of men and women along the grand roads of the universe, all other progress is the needed emblem and sustenance " (CW IX, 157). The voyage thus reflects the new mode of Whitman's original experience of reality as an endless process of becoming through the identification of " Me" and "Not-Me." At the same time, the road exemplifies the poet's optimistic belief in a cosmic evolution, not, however, in terms of an increasing spiritualization of matter as Milton saw it,74 but as eternal amalgamation of creative opposites: " Ever the dim beginning, / Ever the growth, the rounding of the circle, / Ever the summit and the merge at last, (to surely start again)" (CW IX, 5). The circular movement incorporates, as it were, the pendulum motion of ebb and flow, in analogy to the natural cycle of life and death. (It is characteristic that, for Whitman, the zenith of the circle is also the beginning of a new, possibly expanded, but otherwise identical circular motion, whereas the same point, in Emily Dickinson's poetry, often denotes the qualitatively different dimension of ecstatic experience: " degree- less noon.") 7 Frequently, however, Whitman unrolls the ideal form of the circle into the historical line of progress. ""Whither I walk, I cannot define, but I know it is good " (CW IX, 439). Although unknown, the poet's " rendezvous " (CW IX, 112), like that of the cosmos, " is appointed, it is certain" (CW IX, 83). This confidence is based on his belief in the world as a harmonious "' Scheme ": " the universe is duly [i. e., due to the universal law] in order" (CW IX, 432). "All goes onward and outward, 72 If we consider Whitman's poetry with Wellek as metonymic (in its totalized sense), Kenneth Burke's characterization of the metonymic mode as " reductive " would, indeed, coincide with our findings. 72 The philosophical and literary implications of Whitman's dynamic approach were masterfully examined by Charles Feidelson, Jr. (pp. 17-27). My respect for his pioneer work is in no way lessened by certain points of disagreement. 7 Cf. Milton's Paradise Lost, V, 463-505. " Cf. Roland Hagenbiichle, "Precision and Indeterminacy." 460 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="34">nothing collapses," (CW IX, 34). The road, in fact, becomes more important than the house it leads to: "The paths to the house I seek to, make, / But leave to those to come the house itself" (CW IX, 614). That the suggested direction is the right one, Whitman never doubts. The poet, moreover, unlike his more pessimistic followers, still serenely enjoys his " unbehaustes Dasein." If, however, moving on is preferable to reaching the goal, progress emerges as the highest value: "size is only de- velopment . . . are you the President? It is a trifle, they [i. e., the future generations] will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on (CW IX, 49). Whitman's occasional warnings to the reader: "the way is suspicious, the result uncertain, perhaps destructive . . . release me and depart on your way!" (CW IX, 115-17) are largely rhetorical although symptomatic of the aforementioned undercurrent of latent doubt.76 Even the drowning of " the giant swimmer " or the wrecking of the stranded ship (CW IX, 428-29) seem merely grandiose spectacles, and do not evoke any lasting impression on the part of the poet or reader. Unlike Emily Dickinson, neither Emerson nor Whitman ever ventured to look directly into the terrifying abyss of nothingness.77 Whitman himself seems at times uneasy about the emblematic character of the image and tries to do without it: "O public road . . . You express me better than I can express myself, / You shall be my poem" (CW IX, 151). The tension between language and reality, as reflected in this passage, is clearly a result of the emblematic style. It could not arise in such a way if language was used as a symbolist tool. The poet then makes the road lead wherever he chooses, ventures on "paths untrodden" or even on pathless and wild seas and, finally gets rid of it altogether (CW IX, 112). In a similar manner, because they do not serve his "purpose," he discards the "Emblematic and capricious blades " (CW IX, 114), and in " Song of Mvyself," the stallion: "Why do I need your paces when I outgallop 76 This doubt in the meaningfulness of the phenomenal world might be related to the stylistic device of tentative and negated analogies. 77 Emerson did, in fact, look at the abyss, but from a secure vantage point: " 11owv the restless soul runs round the outmost orbit aid builds her bold conclusion as a tower of observation from whence her eyes wander incessantly in the unfathomable abyss" (Sherman Paul, p. 99). Moreover, for Emerson as for Whitman, God (as "self ") is in the very center, providing the necessary fixity and "centrality " for man's "self-evolving circle." Roland Hagenbu-chle 461</page><page sequence="35">them?" (CW IX, 61) .T It is precisely because language does not yet command an autonomous power within a "neutral territory" that Whitman is constantly tempted to do without all objective correlatives and renounce the use of tropes alto- gether: " I will say what I have to say by myself " (CW IX, 114). The -dilemma stems from the fact that the poet either wants too much (total identification of words and, things) or too little (words as bookwords, only). Although the emblem lends itself as a kind of compromise, it is ultimately unable to overcome the difficulty since, unlike the symbol, it lacks a proper domain of its own. It is not surprising, therefore, that Whitman occasion- ally shows little confidence in the adequacy of his medium and seems to disregard his ultimate dependence on it. It might be argued, however, that the poet, perhaps unconsciously, did re- cognize the fundamental problem of limiting particularity in- herent in all imagery and-by suspending his emblems-tried to regain the freedom of pure potentiality. Analogously, one could consider his use of antithesis in all its forms (plenitude, contradiction, paradox, particularity and universality, law and liberty, being and non-being) as a strategy of affirming (Set- zung ") and negating (" Negierung ") which, in its neutralizing effect, leaves all options open: existence is thus once more reduced to a sort of potentiality, itself the ground for a new reality. What Whitman tries to achieve by juxtaposing contra- dictory terms, through the counterbalancing device of cumulation or by direct negation, is later on accomplished by means of (what one might call with Dylan Thomas) the " dialectal method 'T9 where, within strict formal limits, images build up into self-suspending clusters, with the negated metaphor (ex- 78 At the same time, this passage establishes the supremacy of the " image-making faculty" (i. e. the potentiality of consciousness) over reality on the one hand and, possibly, over fixed images on the other. Cf. further: " Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask-lie over! / You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also" (CW IX, 73). 7' Dylan Thomas formulates the " dialectical method " as follows: "I let, perhaps, an image be 'made' emotionally in me and then apply to it what intellectual and critical forces I possess-let it breed another, let the image contradict the first, make, of the third image bred out of the other two together, a fourth contradictory image, and let them all, within my imposed formal limits, conflict. Each image holds within it the seed of its own destruction, and my dialectical method, as I understand it, is a constant building up and breaking down of the images that come out of the central seed, which is itself destructive and constructive at the same time." The method is not unrelated to Valery's concept of " absence presente. 462 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an Amezrian Identity</page><page sequence="36">tensively used by Emily Dickinson) as an extreme case where the image is simultaneously built up and broken down within a single trope itself.80 The emblematic character of Whitman's poetry is strikingly revealed in his choice of titles: " Confession Drops " (later " Trickle Drops ") , " Quicksand Years," " Scented Herbage of my Breast," "M .Ay Picture-Gallery " (with the poet as Cicerone), " Song of the Banner at Daybreak," " Ship of Libertad," etc. The list could easily be extended. If used on a large scale, emblems can assume a mythic dimension, as shown in " Song of the Broad-Axe." This poem, characterized by the author as " a long varied train of an emblem " (CXV IX, 184), outlines the development of humanity by tracing the historical role of the axe, "the mighty and friendly emblem of the power of [his] own race " (CW IX, 192). It should be remembered, however, that Whitman's use of the emblem (like that of the analogy) is often rather free and by no means fixed in the sense of an immutable one to one relationship. This becomes increasingly clear if one looks at images such as the cloud, the ship, the bird, the star or the sun. The "formless simulacrum" of the cloud, for example, can serve as an emblem for a "superber earth" or liberty, as well as for imperfection, sadness or even death. The emblem of the ship may embody the poet's book, the soul, democracy, liberty, the world or, in its tacking course, the history of mankind. The hawk stands in turn for liberty and sexuality, or for the fierceness and untranslatability of reality. The mockingbird is an emblem of the poet's ecstatic joy in both fulfilled life and death.Sl The sun in its "dazzling, fierce aureole," and its "inextinguishable glance" is emblematic of Whitman's ideal of "Libertad," of Right, Truth and Justice; it 0 The principle of simultaneous creation and suspension characteristic of Emily Dickinson's negated metaphor is well brought out in the expression: landscapes of absence," which, surprisingly enough, has its German counterpart in Rilke's " Gebirge des Nicht-mehr." Emily Dickinson, like Dylan Thomas, has given a description of her poetic " method ": " To pile like Thunder to its close / Then crumble grand away / While everything created hid / This-would be Poetry-" (poem no. 1247). Not " mimesis " of reality but conversion into the potentiality of con- sciousness: " The Possible's slow fuse is lit / By the Imagination " (poem no. 1687). It could also be argued that such poetry is still "mimesis" not, however, of a reality seen in terms of entities but of processes. " Cf. Bernice Slote and James E. Miller, Jr., " of Monkeys, Nudes and the Good Gray Poet," reprinted in Start with the Sun, p. 185.

In short, the various emblems have a wide, though by no means unrestricted, range of meaning with a marked tendency towards bipolarization but occasionally also approaching the status of pure symbols.82 For all that we should not disregard the basic assumption underlying Whitman's preference for the emblematic style: the belief that this world is a meaningful one and that its significance need only be uncovered. Whitman's habit of mind is, therefore, fundamentally nonallegorical, since allegory, in the narrower sense of the term, despairs of finding some factual truth in things and, as a result, creates an arbitrary relationship between objects and their meanings.83 Although it sometimes proves difficult to distinguish between the allegoric and emblematic use of a term (in fact, what may appear emblematic to the poet may seem allegoric to the reader), this doubt of a meaningful world is, on the whole, alien to Whitman. For him the elements of the universe still make up a congruous whole, without leaving any part unresolved. The antithetical elements are not neglected or suppressed but, in the twofold sense of the word, overlooked. The emblematic mode of thinking is, hence, contrary to an exten- sive use of metaphor. Whitman is not,as Denis Donoghue believes, " uninterested in fidgeting with metaphors," 84 but disinclined by nature to think metaphorically, because he is not concerned with the subtle blending of elements, but only with total fusion. Metaphorical expression is inadequate to render Whitman's world picture, since it is precisely the unresolved 82 The sea is a case in point. It is characteristic, moreover, that the symbolic element in Whitman's images gains momentum whenever the undercurrent of doubt, fear and perplexity in face of " the puzzle of puzzles," " being," is allowed free play; in other words when the redeeming mode of symmetrical thinking (in terms of bipolar unity) is disturbed by the experience of impending death or nothingness. 8"A. Henkel and A. Schbne, Emblemata: Handbuch zur Sinnbildkunt des XVI und XVII Jahrhunderts (Stuttgart, 1967), pp. xiii-xvii. Whether the borrowed definition can really be applied to later epochs is admittedly a mute point. Whitman s own use of the term is, of course, influenced by Emerson. In the essay " The Poet " the latter defines nature as " a temple whose walls are covered with emblems." As a result, the poet becomes an amanuensis of the universe. If Emerson goes on to say that " the distinction which we make in events . . . disappear, when nature is used as a symbol," the term " symbol" would seem to point at the universal analogy which unites all things, and is therefore practically synonymous with "emblem," which becomes increasingly clear from other passages such as: " Things admit of being used as symbols, because nature is a symbol, in the whole and in every part." 84 Denis Donoghue, p. 44. 464 Whitmanm's Unfinished Quest for an Ame7ican Identity</page><page sequence="38">"6 rest" (the dissimilarity in similarity) which makes up the proper domain of metaphor as a linguistic phenomenon.8 Two sets of semantic markers with one or more incommensurable elements are syntactically interrelated, thus making for some greater or lesser degree of semantic anomaly. As a result of the syntactical conjunction we experience a sort of analogical union on the semantic level, which, however, seems never completely achieved. We remain in a state of expectation as to the fusion of the two apparently heterogeneous morphemes which continue to defend their identities despite what may be called contextual pressure. As, therefore, a complete synthesis cannot be reached, an element of disharmony remains and accounts for our per- plexity. It is precisely that remnant of disorder which points to an existential mystery: something is and at the same time is not-yet.86 Though it would appear that Whitman's " divine law of in- directions" (CW IX, 386) alludes to this sphere of subtle blending and suspended conflict, it is, in the last analysis, rather an indication of the hieroglyphic character of appearances; nevertheless, it must be admitted that the symbolic function of language is, if only indirectly, increasingly brought into focus. In fact, (as metioned above) Whitman's images often transcend 86 It must be remembered, however, that Whitman makes extensive use of one type of metaphor: the personification variant. Cf. note 87. SO The term metaphor is, as always in this essay, used in its narrower sense, com- prising both the paradigmatic substitution type and the syntagmatic tension type. Whereas the latter (a characteristic of Emily Dickinson's poetry) is practically absent from Whitman's work, the former is mainly represented by the personification (the animation and, more rarely so, the reification) variant Rene Wellek very subtly con- tends that Whitman is not a metaphoric but a metonymic poet. Metonymy in its narrower sense implies a qualitative relationship according to the four types of causes (material, formal, efficient and final). This kind of trope, however, is rarely found in Whitman, since he is interested in "the thing itself," at least on one level. Wellek evi- dently thinks of synecdoche which is, in fact, often subsumed under the term metonymy. If so, it must be taken in its totalized form of pars pro toto, because every object can function as " the hub of the universe." The paradoxical status of the object as a cc common concrete " determines its relationship with the whole as one of both total identification and independence. Metonymy, however, excludes ' equivalence." Still, Whitman's method may well be called metonymic in the sense that he is unable to realize his colossal project and, despite his desire for totality, can only offer " fragments " and " specimens." It should further be noted that WVhitman's extensive use of the catalogue, among other feature, shows indeed a strong tendency towards total metonymy in Jakobson's sense of this term. Cf. Rene Wellek, A History of Modern Criticism: 1750-1950, 5 vols. (New Haven and London, 1965), IV, The Later Nineteenth Century, 191-9?00. Roland Hagenbuichle 465</page><page sequence="39">the range of their emblematic function and explore the deeper strata of symbolical meaning which is, as in all great poetry, at least in part, beyond the conscious intention of the author. In this sense, Whitman is doubtlessly justified in affirming: " there is more in myself . . . and more in my poems than I have supposed'" (CW IX, 447). The poet's repeated and explicit references to a sphere as yet recalcitrant to linguistic expression, however, go to show that he still lacks the corresponding stylistic means to render it satisfactorily: " I feel a hundred realities, clearly deter- mined in me, that words are not yet formed to represent" (" An American Primer," p. 21). First, it remains doubtful whether these realities are, indeed, "clearly determined " and second, it is probably not a question of words (which are surely available), but of their use. The " vexatious matter " is not one of " names," but of expression. Whitman's bipolar unity, " One, yet . . . of contradictions made" (CW IX. 13) definitely disqualifies him for an extensive use of metaphor, save, perhaps in terms of the oxymoron (a sort of compressed antithesis) such as "c liquid trees" (CW IX, 49) or "a child very old" (CW IX, 111); yet even this trope is not frequent. There is, of course, one paramount exception: personification. In fact, the poet's " divine rapport" between " Me " and " Not-Me," between man and nature is most appropriately conveyed by anthropomorphic images (more rarely by animation and reification). Besides, the idea of corre- spondence finds adequate expression in comparisons and anal- ogies.87 Although Whitman occasionally identifies himself with Hegel's system, the dialectic principle in its abstract form remained foreign to him. The poet accordingly found his own peculiar analogy not in a philosophic formula but in the most elemental manifestation of life, in the procreative act. " All were lacking, if sex were lacking " (CW IX, 101), was the programmatic though not dominating trend of the second edition of Leaves of Grass. It is, of course, possible in a limited way, to understand his sexual imagery in terms of a psychological journey through his mind and in a mythopoeic sense, the mind of everyman. To claim, however, that Whitman ventured more fearlessly into the " That the poet does not always avoid falling into tasteless banalities, most readers of his poetry would readily admit. Again, the stylistic problem cannot be dissociated from Whitman's emblematic mode of thinking that always carries with it the latent danger of simplistic reduction. 466 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="40">depths of the unconscious than, say, Melville, seems a rather naive overestimate of the poetic and cognitive role of " undraped sexuality," particularly in view of the plainly regressive nature of much of his imagery.88 Despite this caveat, there can be no doubt that sexual imagery is absolutely central to Whitman's poetry. As a child issues from the physical union without de- stroying the individuality of the parents and is able, in his turn, to pass on life, so the function of sexual imagery is basically to fuse, at least momentarily, the contradictory elements of existence, without sacrificing their integrity, into a third set, destined to become part of a new antithesis: " Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex " (CW IX, 31). Thus, sex embodies the poet's quest for an endless reconciliation of the Apollonian and Dionysian elements of his poetry, of the particular and the universal, the real and ideal, of individual and type and, in the last analysis, liberty and law. The eternal rhythm of the loom of life provides Whitman with a means to transcend the world as a mere paradox, satisfies his inveterate distrust of the finality of goals, gratifies his admiration for the Heraclitian strife of opposites as a necessary prerequisite for bringing out individuality and harmony, and finally allows him to project the as yet unattainable synthesis into an indefinite future, thus suspending the reader's potential disbelief in the entelechy of life. Lastly, sexual imagery is admirably suited to " vitalize" or " vivify" the world of objects,89 while at the same time manifesting the analogia entis. Behind Whitman's use of sexual imagery is, of course, always the intended unio mystica of spirit and matter, body and soul: "I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you, / And you must not be abased to the other . . I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning, / How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn'd over upon me, / And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart, / And reach'd till you felt my beard, and reach'd till you held my feet" (CW IX, 88 Edwin H. Miller, pp. 19, 62, 109 et passim. 89 Cf. Roy Harvey Pearce, p. 45. According to Pearce, Whitman's use of the verb " vivify " is close to Pound's " make it new." It is the imaginative power which the poet discovers in language, " to break through the categories of time, space, and matter." Roland Hagenbiichle 467</page><page sequence="41">32-33). The whole passage, in theme and diction, points forward to Dylan Thomas " My Hero Bares His Nerve." 90 The crosswise unification (the cross being a time-honored emblem of the sun and hence of eternal life) as described in the autoerotic image, shows how the soul accepts the body from head to heel, i. e., in its full corporeality. It gives thus expression to the idea that both the realms of spirit and matter axe fully integrated, while at the same time stressing the integrity and equality of both partners. As noticed before, sexual imagery (frequently of the narcissistic type), also fulfills an important function in Whitman's explora- tion of reality: " Press close bare-bosm'd night," the ecstatic poet-lover exclaims, "mad naked summer night . . . Smile 0 voluptuous coolbreathed earth! . . . Smile, for your lover comes " (CW IX, 49). As Marcuse (paraphrasing Freud) points out in Eros and Civilization, this " narcissism may contain the germs of a different reality principle: the libidinal cathexis of the ego (one's own body) may become the source and reservoir for a new libidinal cathexis of the objective world." 91 It is, in fact, through a kind of childlike empathy that " the caresser of life " (CXV IX, 40) identifies himself with the " Not-Me." The poet's senses are " instant conductors," and each touch electrifies him into " a new identity " (CW IX, 57). Although the fusion is only momentary, it suffices, not unlike a chain reaction, endlessly to generate further images at will. What may originally have been an encounter with reality tends to be superseded by an autonomous activity of the " image-making faculty." This poetic principle " shapes ever projecting other shapes" (CW IX, 195), sometimes works only too well, putting an unbearable strain on the reader as the poems " Salut au Monde! " or "Passage to India&gt;" exemplify.92 The all too easy proliferation of changing identifications reveals that this "new reality principle " of "libidinal cathexis" has (at least in Whitman's use of it) a serious flaw: it lacks depth, or to put it differently, the poet sacrifices it for reasons of dynamism, of limitless expansion and progression. The preponderance of the horizontal over the vertical is, however, hardly suited to help Whitman in his search for a new identity. 90 Cf. Bernice Slote and James E. Miller, p. 136. 91 Herbert Marcuse, Eros and Civilization: A Philosophical Inquiry into Freud (Boston, 1955), p. 169. Also quoted by Miller, p. 928. 92 Cf. Feidelson, p. 27. 468 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="42">Although the poet alternately or simultaneously embodies the male and female principle, the latter definitely dominates. The father figure is, barring some rare (though important) exceptions, restricted to the early prose, and there appears at best benevolent and helpless.93 Accordingly, Whitman's "Muse" (undeniably "changed, journey'd considerable" from the locus amoenus of the Boeotian Helicon) has become a strangely androgynous, though at the same time strongly matriarchal, deity watching over " the good old cause," " Libertad," the progress and liberty of the race, and ultimately, the cuincidentia oppositorum, not however, in terms of a static principle but one of endless flux. In fact, sexual imagery is inseperably bound up with the idea of progressive procreation, and hence, with the temporal dimen- sion, as the poet's description of woman in terms of archetypal libido or life force clearly establishes. (It is, perhaps, noteworthy that Whitman and Emily Dickinson embody the principle of negation in their respective anima and animus. In other words, Whitman's concept of the terrible mother finds its counterpart in the figure of the terrible God-father of the Amherst poet.) Whitman's " Brave New World " is, indeed, a futuristic utopia. The triadic progress pattern (then fashionable in European poetry and philosophy, and passed on mainly via Emerson) as delineated by the poet, is political democracy, material prosperity, and, out of these two, the new moral and aesthetic identity. " The divine average " (CW IX, 487), Whitman's all too often misinterpreted vision of modem democrarcy, is nothing less than a gigantic scheme for the restructuring of the human personality within a totally transformed culture, even though it may look like a quixotic attempt to repeat the Puritan experiment (that had so disastrously miscarried in Europe) in secularized terms on the promised land of the new continent: the democratic prin- ciple will create " a new earth and a new man " (CW VIII, 390). The depressing final books of Paradise Lost, describing the deteriorating history of fallen man, are to be rewritten from the optimistic " American point of view " (i. e without the agonizing and frustrating effect of the Fall) and reversed into the ascending history before a new paradisical state: " To the garden the world anew ascending " (CW IX, 90). However, the poet is by 9 The predominance of the mother is best documented by the poet's correspondence, where his father is hardly ever mentioned. Roland Hagenbuchle 469</page><page sequence="43">no means blissfully oblivious of " brute reality." In " Democratic Vistas" (originally planned as a retort to Carlyle's attack on democracy) he, in fact, bitterly abuses the States that have just come into being as a monster whose materialism, like the biblical serpent, devours all the other serpents; the antidote he administers is his vision of a new American identity: " a gigantic skeleton of Personality" (CW I, 347). The new American identity, as envisioned by the poet, faith- fully reflects his endeavour to find a new relationship with reality in terms of a bipolar unity: "The American Soul, with equal hemispheres, one Love, one . . . Pride " (CW IX, 174) is also the soul of his poems: " Art sleeps with the twain " (CW IX, 716). One half, " measureless pride," as Whitman prefers to call it, expresses the unrestrained claim of the individual to self- realization. It is counterbalanced by the other half, " robust love ' or "adhesiveness " "C. . . that fuses, ties, aggregates," expressing man's duty or, as the poet believes, his urge, to fuse himself in " the divine average," in other words, to yield to the archetypal pattern of existence which inseparably links him with humanity as a whole (CW VIII, 404). Whitman is thus faced with the time-honored Puritan (though not only Puritan!) dilemma of law and liberty, which proved well-nigh insoluble even to Milton who, however, attempted a less risky answer.9 Man undoubtedly wins his widest liberty by submitting to the universal law: "Would you have in yourself the divine, vast, general law? Then merge yourself in it" (CW VIII, 381). What has already been pointed out in the stylistic analysis of XWhitman's poetry now becomes a decisive problem: the lack of a " middle ground." The principle of identification leaves no region to work out a synthesis. As a result, the poet pays little or no attention to the apparent incompatibility of the two realms; he makes hardly any attempt to resolve the antinomies but is content simply to hold on to the two poles as comple- "It is more than doubtful whether the term "adhesiveness" can be limited to homoerotic love. It should be borne in mind, moreover, that both homo- and heteroerotic love often transcend the merely physical aspect, reflecting the poet's concern with individuality and "fusion." " Cf. Roland HagenbUchle, Miltons 'Paradie Lost,' ch. V. Milton's attempt to reconcile the two realms is based on the (somewhat rationalized) " imago dei " concept. However, the shift from the theocentric to the anthropocentric worldviexv confronts Milton with problems similar to those Whitman is struggling with. 470 Whitman''s Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="44">mentary and ultimately identical parts of one great " ensemble." If "the chanter of Adamic songs" (CW IX, 107) chooses " measureless pride " as one half of the new identity, the Satanic principle is already naturalized in the new Jerusalem, "the new City of Friends " (CW IX, 133). It is in this sense of a "negated negation" (through incorporation) that the poet may indeed demand "the grim estimates inherited from the Puritans " such as ""the Devil, hell, and depravity" must be "absent from literature " (CW VIII, 414). The " hell under the skull-bones " (CW IX, 158) is not blinked at but it is neutralized (as in the device of the paradox) by opposing and ultimately fusing it with the divine principle of "love," which alone can bridle Leviathan (CW VIII, 422). In thus merging heaven and hell (past and present, life and death) the poet may justly claim to be "'the equalizer of his age and land " (CW IX, 347) . Just because Whitman was aware of the " levelling" tendency of the democratic principle he insisted on " pride " as the " centripetal element of man's self-evolving individuality (CW VIII, 726). In fact, the principle of bipolar unity, as used by Whitman, can probably only be understood fully in the light of the poet's actual or imaginative experience (CW IX, 709-29) of this vast continent and its people.96 Just as Whitman's space-creating catalogue must be seen together with the overpowering size of this country, so the tension between diversity and unity was, no doubt, particularly urgent in a nation that had hardly yet felt the fusing effect of historical tradition. The poet's powerful " press " (CW IX, 587 etc.) must, as it were, replace that of a largely non-existent past in creating the new American identity (language being the universal absorber and combiner). Whit- man's claim that his poetry and the war are one (CW IX, XXXIV) is usually dismissed by critics as a post factum rationalization not borne out by the facts of his poetic achieve- ment before the war. Taken in its emblematic sense (which it must be), the poet is entirely correct. His mode of thinking is, from the first, radically bound up with the antagonism 9I In fact, Whitman's 1855 preface to Leaves of Grass, the credo of "the Great Bible," sounds like Taine's theory of the formative influence of race, milieu and historical moment elevated to a poetic principle: "The . . . expression of the American poet must be transcendent and new, commensurate with the continent and its people, who of all nations at any time upon the earth have probably the fullest poetical nature." Roland Hagenbiichle 471</page><page sequence="45">between the single States and the Union on one hand (" cohesion at all costs"), and the tension between the liberty of individual self-expression and the " lump character ' or " national identity (CW IX, 738) on the other. However, to reconcile the posited liberty of the individual with the general law of the whole is, at least in terms of bipolar unity, a superhuman task which he must eventually shift on to the reader. The latter "must himself . . . construct indeed the poem, . . . the text furnishing the hints, the clue, the start, or framework. Not the book needs so much to be the complete sum, but the reader of the book does": "You be my poem" (CW VII, 424 and IX, 233). The reader as Everyman is, despite Whitman's " tender directions and indirections " (CW IX, 238), hardly in a better position to come to terms with these (real or imaginary) antinomies, although it must be admitted that he finally comes into his own. Still, I feel uncomfortable about the claim that, provided the reader yields himself up to the procreative urge released through the organic form, he is on the best way to his own transformation.97 The process of in- dividuation (in the Jungian sense) is a slow and laborious process and it remains at least doubtful whether mere self-identi- fication with the " Not-Me" as practiced by Whitman (and Emerson) goes very far in achieving it. The poet's own self is not realized so much through identification (which is somewhat accidental) but through self-expression in his poetic oeuvre. Accordingly, man must not only become his own priest but his own poet (CW VIII, 454). It is no doubt Whitman's aim to activate the reader's own creativity, to have him co-create his poems, thereby anticipating an important objective in much of modern poetry. This would, however, presuppose that the reader's creative urge works along the lines of the poet-and even so it would be unsatisfactory. Whitman himself expressly wants us to refuse " pre-worded experience," including his own, as inau- thentic, and this despite his " Come leave all the teachings and preachings of others and mind only these words, 98 a didactic stance which is, of course, part of the poet's prophetic message. " Howard J. Waskow, p. 157. For a different view cf. Roy Harvey Pearce, pp. 74-75. 98 In Re Walt Whitman, ed. Horace L. Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, Thomas B. Harned (Philadelphia, 1893), p. 18. (From an article anonymously published by Whitman after the issue of the first edition of his poems.) 472 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="46">The reader should start out anew, and play "the same old role, the role that is what we make it" (CW IX, 163). This comes close to Sartre's claim that we create our own values, though with the important difference that, for Whitman, it is an "old role" because, whatever part we adopt, we cannot but express the purpose (even if unknown) of the cosmos itself, which is still held together by the universal analogy of right, justice and truth (CW VIII, 415, 730). (That is also why Whitman's poetry, like that of Emerson, is often saddled with a moral rider.) Accordingly, the poet cannot be satisfied with the traditional " to thine own self be true " but offers a model, however rudimentary, of the phylogenetic process: the Heraclitian strife, necessary to bring out identity is redeemed in the imagina- tive identification of opposites. Whitman's prophetic vision, " final " though " undefined " (CW IX, 76, 458) -the third religion fusing the beauty of Greece (life) with the suffering of Christianity (death) -embodies in his eyes the ultima ratio of human condition (CW VII, 708). Indeed, the "Trinitas divine shall be gloriously accomplish'd and compacted by the true son of God, the poet " (CW IX, 415) who will raise " the descending man : "Here is my neck . . . hang your whole weight upon me"' (CW IX, 74). This is a colossal claim which goes far beyond Hdlderlin's " dichterisch wohnet der Mensch." Whit- man himself, at times, realizes the enormity of his enterprise. In such moments " the arbiter " of the universe (CW IX, 347) feels like a debris struck from the float of being and shrivels up at the thought of God (CW IX, 419). All seems " maya " and he asks himself: " Is it the prophet's thought I speak, or am I raving? " (CW IX, 423). And he admits: "before all my arrogant poems, the real Me stands yet untouch'd, untold, altogether unreach'd . . . mocking me . . . with peals of distant ironical laughter at every word I have written" (CW IX, 254). "Whitman's occasional despair is not unlike that of Holderlin's Empedokles, who finally comes to realize that his presumptions claim to a godlike status leaves him " seelenlos im Dunkel." The deification of the self as an autonomous "kosmos " paradoxically entails the loss of self, since the absolute self only proves its finitude. Cf. Wolfgang Binder, H6lderlin Aufsdtze (Frankfurt am Main, 1970), pp. 17-923. The romantic inheritance of the poet-god is not without its dangers, especially when the concept of the creative self is elevated to a message with a historical application. For a masterful survey of the problem of selfhood in romantic tradition cf. Harold Bloom's stimulating essay "The Internalization of Quest Romance" reprinted in The Ringers in the Tower, pp. 12-35. Roland Hayenbuichle 47.3</page><page sequence="47">It is here, that Whitman finally has to recognize the funda- mental asymmetry between Me and Not-Me, the finite and the infinite, Man and God. In other words, the " real Me " is not something one can identify with at will, it is rather the continuous act of man transcending himself. Looked at in this way, the quest for identity is ultimately bound to fail. (To accept a defeat of sorts and pursue the quest for its own sake is, in fact, Emily Dickinson's solution.) If the poet usually seems at ease, knowing that the " shadow my likeness . . . is really me" (CW IX, 136), this is obviously the result of his poetic achievement: canto, ergo um! But what about the reader who must work out his own salvation? The new identity of the American soul in terms of a bipolar unity of pride and love may work as a model for Whitman the writer, but it does not work as a message. As noticed before, the poet's imaginative leap into total identification not only suspends any sort of deeper union but-most important-leaves no com- mon ground to work out a synthesis. It either is or is not. Whitman's concept of the new earth revolving "in free and lawful circuit " (CW VIII, 404) as well as that of the new man acting "under the law of liberty" (CW VIII, 538) does not offer that " neutral territory " where alone individuation may be achieved, not in a leap, but in a process of gradual concrescence. The new identity of a "sound, large, complete, physiological, emotional, moral, intellectual and spiritual Man [Emerson's "spheral man "] adjusted to the modern, New World, to Demo- cracy and to Science " (CW I, 151) is a project of such grandiose dimensions that, from the very outset, it seems to defeat all attempts at realization. In his messianic claim, Whitman sacri- ficed finite man (to use Roy Harvey Pearce's words) to an unattainable " cosmic man." 100 The poet's hopeful surmise that " the seas are all crossed " (CW IX, 415), and the antinomies of existence "averaged now" (CW IX, 431), is true only in the poet's vision or in death. The same optimism that enabled the poet to create a fresh world picture " seems to have hampered his insight into the limits of man's creaturely existence. Identification of " Me A" and "c Not-Me " presupposes a symmetrical relationship between the two terms. This completely negates the difference between 100 Cf. Roy Harvey Pearce, p. 39. 474 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="48">finitude and infinity by including the latter, God (man's "Elder Brother"), in one's own self.101 However, the recognition of a fundamental asymmetry between man and the absolute is un- deniably one of the profoundest human experiences, which finds expression in all great poetry (with Whitman's contemporary Emily Dickinson as a case in point). This does not necessarily mean that there is no meeting point for this deepest of all contra- dictions (the meeting point in Emily Dickinson's case is the negative identity for the parousia of the " Spirit"). It does mean, however, that the facile and often rather glibly practised identi- fication of " Me " and " Not-Me " as a mere change " of garment " (CW IX, 67) is hardly compatible with man's nature.102 The humanly possible ground for a reconciliation of these antinomies might (as again Dickinson points out) be found in the sacrificial and self-transcending quality of " love " that accepts, but over- comes, man's limiting finitude and is able to bring about the fundamental structural change which Whitman envisions in the human psyche. In fact, the word is ready at hand as part of the poet's universal lexicon; it might actually be the clue so long sought for, " the word final, superior to all" (CXV IX, p252). But although " A kelson of the creation is love" (CW IX, 33), and despite the fact that the term is used as a constituent of the new identity, Whitman seems unable "to bring forth what lies slumbering forever ready in all words" (CW IX, 384). Why, we may ask, does the word " love," despite its frequency, betray a signally limited range of meaning (often synonymous with " affection ") ? Could it be that the poet (like Emerson!) lacks in this sphere of life what he himself would call " the develop'd soul? " (CW IX, 384). We seem to perceive in him a peculiar type of compensatory mechanism, close investigation of which lies outside the scope of this essay.'03 It is clear, however, that 101 The deification of the self must be strictly distinguished from the "negative identity" as achieved by Emily Dickinson where the renunciated self becomes the temple for the parousia of the spirit. Although Whitman, occasionally, seems to approach this mode of existence, it is by and large alien to him. His attempt to suspend and transcend selfhood finds expression in the mythopoeic persona. 102 In Emily Dickinson's work, by contrast, the role of pain and agony is, in the strict sense of the term, an existential-not merely another " change of garment." For her, death or non-being is the ultimate mystery, and there is no way for her to get rid of it by means of analogies or identifications. 102 Edwin H. Miller gives a balanced account of this specific problem in particular, and of Whitman's psychodynamics in general (pp. 140-70). Roland Hagenbitchle 47,5</page><page sequence="49">" love " is only used to counterbalance " pride " (analogous to the intended fusion of the particular and the universal), not, how- ever, as an autonomous power of its own. For this reason, " l'amor che muove il sole e l'altre stelle " is superseded by the sun itself, denoting the (half Puritan, half transcendental) ab- stracts " right, justice, truth." 104 Since Whitman's position arouses, in the last analysis, un- answerable questions " (CW IX, 237) and clearly overtaxes human capacity, the yearned-for fusion of " Me " and " Not-Me " is, ultimately unattainable. Consequently, the poet's chief con- cern, " The pass-word primeval . . . democracy (CW IX, 52), " a word of the modern, the word En-Masse," i. e., the new identity of modem America-of modern man in general-remains an impressive but delusive Fata Morgana.105 It is, however, far too simplistic to measure Whitman's vision by the yardstick of sociological reality and find it wanting. This would, in fact, be the deepest misunderstanding Whitman's work can possibly un- dergo: to reduce his poetry to a literary artifact and blissfully overlook the summons it contains as well as its implied criticism of our " ordinary "i mode of life (as understood in the light of Tolstoy's Ivan Itych) . It would certainly be more honest, though much more painful, to ask if Whitman's Utopia and American reality did not, perhaps, share certain features whose investigation might deepen our insight into the nature of man. One of the questions one might legitimately raise is whether Whitman's colossal enterprise is not somehow related to a peculiarly Ameri- can climate of optimism about an eventual (also technological) breakthrough, which will hopefully solve all the problems of the present: "'Be not dishearten'd, affection shall solve every one of the problems of freedom yet" (CW IX, 315, 609) . Furthermore, the will to say all is a manifestation of the will to power, " so important in poetry and war " (CW V, 327) and " dearest of all to the sense of the artist" (CW VIII, 419). Power, finally, 104 The status of love is a question that haunted the Puritan movement from the beginning and never received an adequate answer. Cf. Roland Hagenbuchle, Miltons 'Paradise Lost,' ch. I. Still, biographical and psychological factors seem to be more influential in Whitman's case than historical pressure. 10" Note in this context 'Whitman's frequent use of "foreign words" (especially Gallicisms such as ensemble, Ma Femme, feuillage) to express the unexpressable, which reminds us of Emily Dickinson's somewhat similar tactics in her reaching out for words meant to denote an ecstatic state of consciousness. 476 Whitman's Unfinished Quest for an American Identity</page><page sequence="50">guarantees "the national identity.106 This feeling of unlimited strength, space and time is, for better or worse, no longer shared by later poets. The " New World " has come to realize that it has never really managed to leave behind the faults of the " Old," or in Jarrell's words: " The westering soul / Finds Europe waiting for it over every sea." 107 Man cannot escape himself. Although Whitman's search for an American identity remains unfinished-" the children are still westward tramping for para- dise "-and although the aesthetic quality of his poetry (for reasons previously discussed and not unconnected with his intellectual framework) is sometimes uneven-Ezra Pound sarca- stically spoke of the thirty wellwritten pages which he later on could not find `08-there can be no doubt that Whitman must be considered a historical phenomenon of the first magnitude, not only as the originator and precursor of much of modern Ameri- can 109 but also of European (including Russian) 110 poetry. Thus, Whitman's hope that the experiment of American democracy 106 The term " power " as used by Whitman occasionally shrows a meaning similar to that which predominates in Emily Dickinson's poetry (namely power as unlimited potentiality), particularly in association with beauty or more explicitly in his recogni- tion that " power is no less potent for being impalpable " (CW VII, 147). Whitman, however, never reached Dickinson's insight that "power" is "pain" since it presupposes a renunciation of the object which alone enables the poet to regain it as intensified " absence presente": "I prefer the Power-for Power is Glory, when it likes, and Dominion, too" (Letters, no. 292). 107 Randall Jarrell, The Complete Poems (New York, 1962), p. 440. 1 Ezra Pound, ABC of Reading (New York, 1960), p. 192. Despite his ambivalent feeling of repulsion and attraction, Ezra Pound finally had to admit that he and Whitman were of " one sap and one root " (Personae, The Collected Poems of Ezra Pound [New York, 1949], p. 89). 109 In her introductory essay to Start with the Sun, Bernice Slote, very persuasively, makes out a case for a Whitman tradition as opposed to the neo-puritan Eliot tradition (pp. 3-11). 110 Suffice it to mention Whitman's influence on the early (pre-revolutionary) poetry of Mayakovsky. It is particularly noticeable in poems such as " The Cloud in Trousers" (especially part II), which was one of the four pieces that comprised Mayakovsky's first book, published under the revealing title I. Among later poems one might mention " Brooklyn Bridge " (composed during his stay in the United States in 1925) and " At the Top of My Voice" (1930), somewhat reminiscent of Whitman's " barbaric yawp." It must be admitted, however, that the similarities are more a result of kindred personalities than of direct influence. Concerning Mayakovsky the Utopian, the revolutionary Messiah, " Simply a Man," the rebel-individualist and debunker of sentimentality cf. Wiktor Woroszylski, The Life of Mayakovsky, trans. the Polish by Boleslaw Taborski (New York, 1970), pp. 104-105, 232-36 et passim. For his reaction to the American reality see pp. 368-93. The extent of Whitman's influence is traced by Kornei Chukovsky in the introduction to his new translation of Leaves of Grass.

In judging literary pioneers we must, moreover, be ready to value the project as such, irrespective of its ultimate success. Indeed, Whitman's work as a whole is largely promise, " a few hints," as it were. The ways suggested may not be our ways, but his vision of a vigorously expanding but nonetheless self-limited human personality within a society whose very pluralism makes up its balance and, even more so, his unfaltering belief in man's existence as pure yet purposeful possibility, remains a challenge. Though we find it impossible to give life to the poet's gigantic skeleton of a new man on a new earth, the fault is not entirely his. If, as Roy Harvey Pearce claims, it "'is Whitman's greatest tri- umph: That we have not yet got used to him, "'1 then we, too, have been weighed and found wanting. Indeed, Whitman's project still awaits " the architects of the future." Will they ever arrive?
