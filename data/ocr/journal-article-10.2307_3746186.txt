<plain_text><page sequence="1">GREAT THINKERS (VIII) SPINOZA PROFESSOR W. G. DE BURGH I THE student of Spinoza is faced by a peculiar difficulty. On opening the Ethics-Spinoza's chief work, completed for publication shortly before his death in I674-he finds a system of metaphysics set forth in geometrical form, starting from definitions, axioms, and postulates, and advancing synthetically from first principles to a detailed interpretation of the universe. The difficulty lies not in the language- Spinoza's Latin is easy to construe, and there are translations-nor in the lack of literary graces; his style indeed is singularly impressive in its austere dignity. It lies rather in this, that the method of exposition conveys a misleading suggestion of dogmatism and finality, and conceals almost all traces of the patient inquiries that issued in the finished structure. If once the principles of the system are admitted, the rest appears to follow by logical necessity. But by what processes of thought was Spinoza led to those principles? This is the problem that besets the reader: in order to understand the Ethics, he must penetrate behind the text of the propositions to their significance as answers to the questions that were stirring in Spinoza's mind. And here, for all the light thrown by earlier writings-especially the Short Treatise on God, Man, and his Well- being (I656-I660) and the fragment on The Improvement of the Intellect (I661-I662)-and by the researches of modern scholars, much is still left for conjectural interpretation. Why, then, did Spinoza adopt the geometrical method of exposition? Certainly he shared Descartes's belief that mathematics furnished the model of demon- strative reasoning for all branches of knowledge. That he did not, however, regard the method as an infallible guarantee is evidenced by the fact that already, in 1663, he had presented Descartes's philo- sophy in geometrical form, while holding many of its doctrines to be erroneous. Spinoza's motive lay rather in his passionate desire to present the order of the world and the nature of man in their timeless reality, independently of human purposes and interests. He set himself to rid metaphysics of anthropomorphism, in face not only of popular theology, Jewish and Christian, but of the then dominant philosophy of Descartes. Descartes, while excluding final causes from the science of physical nature, held that the divine purposes in 271</page><page sequence="2">PHILOSOPHY creation lay beyond the grasp of the human mind. In Spinoza's eyes, to credit God with purposes while pronouncing those purposes unknowable was to take refuge in an asylum ignorantiae. "The human mind," he declares, "has adequate knowledge of the eternal and infinite essence of God." God, thus truly known, is known as a being who unfolds His eternal nature in the structure of the universe with a necessity that leaves no place for determination by all-too- human preferences. Ends and means, goods and evils, are relative to man's imperfect apprehension under the form of time. Man fondly imagines himself as exercising an imperium in imperio, independently of God, but this imagination is devoid of truth. Spinoza will show him as he really is, interpreting his nature and passions impersonally "as though it were a question of lines, planes, or bodies." He chose the geometrical order of presentment, as excluding any appeal to teleology and as reflecting, more nearly than any other form of reasoning, the timeless perfection of the real. Apart from this formal obstacle, there is, of course, the graver difficulty, attendant on the study of all great thinkers, of grasping the meaning of Spinoza's main doctrines. They are hard to conceive in thought; harder still to interpret without prolonged discussion. Such are the notions of God's indivisible extension, of His infinity of Attributes, of His eternity in relation to its inadequate expression under the forms of duration and time, of finite individuals as the diversifications of His unique and all-embracing individuality. Consider, for example, one of the most perplexing of Spinoza's doctrines, the two-fold reference of the term idea. This will serve as an introduction to his views on two important problems, the nature of knowledge and the relation between body and mind. For Spinoza, an idea is not, as it was for Descartes, an object pas- sively apprehended by the mind, but an act of judgment, involving affirmation of its content; an idea that is adequate or true is the criterion of its own truth. "As light makes manifest both itself and darkness, so truth is the norm both of itself and of what is false" (II, 43 S).' Moreover, each idea is the mental side of an act of the body, the bodily act and the mental being distinct aspects of a single mode of the one infinite substance, God. They are not two modes, of body and mind respectively, standing in a one-one relationship, but a single mode, reflected now in God's essential Attribute of extension, now in His essential Attribute of Thought, as a single point is situated both on the convex and on the concave of a curve. Here we have Spinoza's answer to the mind-body problem, which had been left in a precarious position by Descartes and his immediate successors. Spinoza recognizes the real dis- I All references in the text, unless otherwise specified, are to the Ethics. S refers to the Scholium, C to the Corollary, appended to a given proposition. 272</page><page sequence="3">SPINOZA tinction and transcends it. He escapes, on the one hand, from the difficulties of causal interaction, on the other, from the Cartesian dualism of substances and the absurdities of Occasionalism. But in his use of the term idea there is a further reference to the body which is far harder to understand. Spinoza maintains that the knower's body is not merely the extended side of his act of thought; it is also the ideatum or object known. Paul's mind, we are told, is the idea of Paul's body; when Paul thinks of Peter, his idea of Peter "indicates rather the constitution of Paul's body than the nature of Peter" (II, I7 S). What meaning are we to attach to this doctrine? In what sense can it be true that, when I look at or conceive a fellow creature, I am looking at or conceiving my own organism? Now Spinoza certainly cannot be charged with the crudities of Repre- sentative Perception. Nor is he simply stating, what all thinkers of his age took for granted, that in sense-awareness what is per- ceived is infected with qualities, e.g. of sound, colour, or taste, that are relative to the percipient. For the doctrine in question holds, not only on the level of sense-perception, but on that of clear and distinct thought. Spinoza means that the finite human mind knows its object, not in its full truth as God knows it, but from the angle, so to speak, of a fragment of God's being; and, further, that this stamp of finitude is set on the whole content of what is known. My mind and my body, when rightly understood, do not form a self-contained entity, "cut off by a hatchet" from the minds and bodies of other individuals, as seems to the inadequate picture- thinking of sense. They form indeed a real individual, but as a unique mode of God's whole thinking and extended nature; so that to know them truly implies knowledge of their context, inclusive of all other minds and bodies in the universe. As Professor Hallett has put it, the statement that the mind knows only its own body means that it knows its body as responding more or less adequately to Nature as a whole. But this view that Paul, in knowing any body, be it Peter's or Paul's own, knows it and the whole world of body from the angle of the knowing subject, so that what he knows reflects his own nature rather than that of the object known, does not mean that the human mind can never grasp the truth. It means only that it can never grasp the truth in its infinite fulness as it is known by God. Of course, since God is all in all things, my true thinking is the act of God thinking in me. But God thinking in a finite mind is one thing, God thinking as God, another. Spinoza draws a clear distinction between God's thought quatenus infinitus est and His thought quatenus constituit essentiam humanae mentis. In the one case He thinks the universe, so to speak, from all angles at once, uno intuitu; in the other, from the angle of an individual human mind. It is in the latter sense that Paul's knowledge of Peter s 273</page><page sequence="4">PHILOSOPHY can be said to express Paul's nature rather than Peter's, or-since the body is, directly or indirectly, the object (ideatum) of every thought-to express the nature of Paul's body rather than that of Peter's. This theory of knowledge is doubtless open to criticism; the brief summary we have given will at least convince the reader that the study of Spinoza is no easy task. Yet, for all its difficulty, Spinoza's philosophy promises a rich reward to those who have the patience to understand it. To him, as to the thinkers of ancient Greece, philosophy was before all else a way of life. Again, like the prophets of his own race, he has a message to proclaim, of salvation for the human soul. He called his great work the Ethics, to show clearly that the metaphysical con- struction in the First Part, and the dispassionate analysis of man's knowledge and emotional nature in the Second and Third Parts, were but the preparation for the doctrine of the mind's liberation from bondage unfolded in Parts IV and V. From his youth up, Spinoza's heart had been athirst for the living God. In the opening pages of his treatise on method, he lifts for a moment the curtain that veils his spiritual history, to tell how in early manhood he had reviewed the various ends that men desire-wealth, honour, and bodily pleasures-to discover in them but vain and transitory sources of distraction; and how his search had led him to the conviction that only in the love of an eternal and infinite reality could the soul find abiding joy and rest. "Happiness and misery," he writes, "lie wholly in this alone, in the nature of the object on which we fix our love." It is the doctrine, elaborated in the Ethics, that knowledge is impotent, unless it stirs desire. From the love of perishable objects spring strife, sorrow, envy, fear, hatred, evil passions that perturb the mind. "But love towards eternal and infinite substance (erga rem aeternam et infinitam) feeds the mind with pure delight, and is wholly free from every taint of sorrow; herein must lie the supreme goal of our desire, to be sought with all our strength." And he goes on to tell how this saving experience, vouchsafed at first in rare moments of insight, became with effort habitual and dominant. It is a love, be it understood, that has its source in knowledge. Spinoza's way of salvation, like Plato's, is the way of intellect. The beatific vision comes only as the crown of prolonged scientific thinking. Like Plato, he realized that it was impossible for the multitude to be philosophical. His message is for those who have ears to hear. There is something in Spinoza of the intellectual aristocrat, looking down from a far height on the vulgar follies of mankind, with pity not unmixed with scorn. This is what parts the spirit of Spinoza from that of Christianity. He was profoundly religious; but his religion was that of the intellect: alike in his life and in his doctrine, he was a saint of rationalism. 274</page><page sequence="5">SPINOZA II It is the doctrine that matters. Our interest in Spinoza's life is limited to the growth of his philosophy. Born at Amsterdam in 1632, into a colony of Jewish refugees from Spain, he lived peaceably under the tolerant rule of the Dutch Republic, and died of con- sumption at the Hague in I674. He earned his livelihood as a polisher of lenses, refusing all offers of academic or monetary assistance rather than compromise his independence. Though a contemplative by temper and habit, he was no recluse; his letters show him associating genially with a large circle both of intellectuals and of men of affairs. His friends recognized in him a nature of rare purity of intention and firmness of purpose, wholly indifferent to worldly gain or glory, one whose evenness of spirit was unmoved by temporal vicissitudes and inspired by a single-minded devotion to things eternal. Spinoza's thoughts on these eternal things were the fruit of his own reflection; none of the influences that helped to their development impaired their marked originality. Of these influences, the chief were the Jewish Platonist tradition and the philosophy of Descartes. Nurtured in the religious inheritance of his race, Spinoza became at an early age an accomplished Hebrew scholar and, as was evidenced after by the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (1670), an acute precursor of the higher criticism of the Old Testament. It is not surprising that his intellectual daring and fearless integrity roused suspicion among the orthodox, leading to his excommunication by the Amsterdam synagogue in 1656. The legacy of Jewish medieval Platonism which had been transmitted to thinkers and poets of the Renaissance left a deep mark upon his mature philosophy. The doctrines of the emanation of all things from the One, the primal source of being and perfection; of the necessary law whereby the products of its inexhaustible energy are generated unilaterally, without derogation to its absolute self-dependence; of freedom as consisting in this absolute self-dependence; of evil as negativity, i.e. as deficiency of reality in the parts of the universe when torn from their context in the perfect whole; of time as the broken light of eternity for man's finite apprehension; of the restoration of the soul by the way of knowledge to union with the One in intellectual love;-all these were fragments of the great Neo-Platonic tradition, bequeathed to Spinoza by the Jewish thinkers of the Middle Ages. Nor was he unfamiliar with Christian medieval thought. We find him in 1662 instructing a pupil in scholastic metaphysics and Cartesian physics. The second main influence on the growth of Spinoza's philosophy was Descartes. Descartes, too, as M. Gilson has fully shown, drew largely on the storehouse of his medieval precursors, 275</page><page sequence="6">PHILOSOPHY and, as a mathematician, was naturally on the side of the Platonists against the Aristotelians. But it is a grave error to label Spinoza a Cartesian; as we have said, he was nullo addictus magistro, and his divergences from Descartes are as striking as his obligations. Broadly speaking, he accepted the Cartesian physics in principle, while rejecting many of its details; in metaphysics and theory of knowledge he took over from Descartes the real distinction of thought and extension, of mind and body, the criterion of clear and distinct conception, the inadequacy of sense apprehension in com- parison with conceptual truth, and the category of Substance and Mode as the key to the structure of reality. His chief divergences from Descartes may be summarized as follows. (I) His thorough- going Monism. Rejecting the doctrine of discrete concepts, each of which is just itself and not another, and therewith the dualism of distinct substances, body and mind, Spinoza affirmed one infinite and self-dependent Substance, God, who alone is conceived with perfect clarity and truth; thought and extension being interpreted as Attributes of the one and only Substance. (2) His insistence on God's immanent causality. For the transcendent Creator, whom Descartes, in common with Jewish and Christian theologians, held to have brought a contingent world into being ex nihilo by a fiat of will, Spinoza substituted a God causally immanent in the effects which flow timelessly from His being with the same necessity as do the properties of a geometrical figure from its essence. (3) His consequent exclusion of all contingency from Nature and of all freedom of choice from the sphere of human action. (4) The ascription to God of extension as an essential Attribute. (5) The doctrine that all modal being is eternal in God and the relegation of time from the status of a determinant factor in the universe to that of an appearance (auxilium imaginationis) relative to man's inadequate apprehension by way of sense. As we have already pointed out, Spinoza never dallied with the Cartesian theory of Representative Perception. Other influences on Spinoza's thought were secondary and inci- dental; e.g. of Bacon, in the field of logical method, and of Hobbes, in that of political theory. To the last-mentioned subject he devoted much attention; as is witnessed by the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus and the unfinished Tractatus Politicus. We cannot dwell on these speculations in this article, but will confine ourselves to the Ethics, and therein (A) to Spinoza's metaphysic of reality and (B) to its application to the moral life of man. III (A) "Whatever is is in God, and without God nothing can be or be conceived" (I, I5). For, whatever is must be either Substance or 276</page><page sequence="7">SPINOZA a Mode of Substance, i.e. it must be either self-dependent in being and conception or dependent for its being on Substance, through which also it is conceived (I, Deff. 3, 5, Ax. I). Spinoza, as we have said, regarded with Descartes this distinction as ultimate; in other words, he regarded the logical relation of Subject and Predicate as expressing the structure of reality. To question this assumption is to question the very basis of Spinoza's metaphysics. Further, there can be only one Substance, which must be infinite. Were it limited, it would cease to be self-dependent, i.e. it would be no longer Substance. Were there more than one infinite Substance, the natures of each would overlap, infecting both with finitude. Spinoza is thus com- mitted at the outset to a monistic philosophy. The one infinite Substance he calls God, or, less frequently, Nature (Deus sive Natura). This Absolute being is a self-conscious (and extended) individual; though the term "person" is rejected as anthropomorphic, he is able to be known and loved by men, and to reciprocate men's knowledge and love. "The (human) mind's intellectual love towards God is a part of the infinite love, wherewith God loves Himself.... Hence it follows that God, in so far as He loves Himself, loves men, and consequently that God's love towards men and the mind's intellectual love towards God are one and the same" (V, 36 and C.). God, the infinite Substance, is defined as "consisting of infinite Attributes, each of which expresses His eternal and infinite essence" (I, Def. 6). The Attributes, therefore, belong to God essentially, each of them expressing a distinct character of His being and covering, so to speak, His whole being under that character. There is nothing in God that is not thinking, nothing that is not extended; but His thinking is not His extension, nor is His extension His thought. We may recall the analogy of the convex and the concave aspects of the curve. Diversity thus enters into the essence of Substance, which is as really many-infinitely many-as it is one. Of the infinite Attri- butes, expressing the inexhaustible richness of God's being, two only, extension and thought, are known to man. Descartes's created substances, res extensa and res cogitans, are thus dethroned from substantiality. It must be remembered that the extension ascribed by Spinoza to God is infinite and indivisible, differing radically from the spatiality of material objects. Lastly, though man knows God through only two of His Attributes, all are in- trinsically knowable; there is nothing in God's essence that is opaque to mind. God knows Himself in all his Attributes. For Spinoza, as for Plato, what is most real is most knowable and what is most knowable is most real. From God's essential nature, i.e. from His Attributes, flow the dependent Modes, or, rather, the system of Modes as reflected in each Attribute. God is essentially active in self-maintenance 277</page><page sequence="8">PHILOSOPHY and self-expression, overflowing of His infinite plenitude of being in infinite productive energy. To God as timelessly productive (the Attributes) Spinoza applies the scholastic term Natura Naturans; to God as the timeless effects of His productivity (the Modes) the term Natura Naturata. "From the necessity of the divine nature infinite things must follow in infinite ways, i.e. everything that can fall under infinite intellect" (I, I6). In God all possibilities are actualized; "He lacked not matter for creating everything, from the highest to the lowest grade of perfection; or, speaking more strictly, the laws of Nature herself were so ample as to suffice for the produc- tion of all that can fall under any infinite intellect" (I, App.). Everything in Natura Naturata is necessary; there is no place for contingency or purposive selection. God indeed is free, for He exists solely by the necessity of His own nature, and His actions are determined by Himself alone (I, Def. 7). But His freedom is poles removed from freedom of choice. It lies in His self-causality. Spinoza's favourite analogy of the logical necessity with which geometrical properties follow from the definition of the figure is manifestly inadequate to express this dynamic productivity of God. Its core of truth is the timelessness of both processes. Spinoza's terminology must not mislead us; when he speaks of cause, he means ground or reason (causa seu ratio), using the word to enforce the paradox that not only the essences of all things but their existence is the eternal effect of God's agency, in whom essence and existence are one. It is in this sense that he speaks of God as the efficient cause of His modes (I, I6 C). Moreover, the modal effects are them- selves God. Whence else could they derive their being? Thus God is the immanent, not the transient, cause of all things (I, I8). Here too we must be on our guard. God is not a transient cause after the manner of Descartes's Creator, who brings the world into existence as something other than, and contingent to, Himself. But to reject external transience is not to proclaim a doctrine of sheer immanence. The neo-Platonic synthesis of immanence and transcendence comes much closer to Spinoza's meaning. Plotinus and Proclus, too, held that all things are in the One and draw their being necessarily from its nature. They too rejected contingency and volitional creation, while upholding unilateral causality and, therewith, the tran- scendence of the One. So for Spinoza the modal effects (natura naturata) depend upon the cause (natura naturans), but not con- versely. God as cause is in se; they are in alio (I, Def. I); "Substance is prior by nature to its affections," i.e. to its modes (I, I). If we would consider Substance "truly," we must leave its affections aside and know it in the purity of its self-dependence (I, 5). Only when thus conceived does God reveal Himself in the concrete fullness of His individuality. 278</page><page sequence="9">SPINOZA Of this self-revelation more presently; we pass to the modal systems of Natura Naturata. Each mode of God, existing timelessly within each of His infinite Attributes, is, within each Attribute, a fragment of an infinite modal system. We have seen that it is one and the same mode that is reflected coincidently in all the Attributes. Spinoza's position therefore is not that of psycho-physical paral- lelism. Nor does it allow of inter-action. For, since each Attribute is self-contained, having nothing in common with any other, modes of the Attribute of thought are to be explained wholly in terms of that modal system, without reference to their ideata in the modal system of extension. We saw, too, that the relation between the several modes is not external but intrinsic, so that adequate knowledge of a given mind or body involves knowledge of the whole system of minds or bodies with which it is integrated. Further, the modes under each Attribute form a hierarchical order. From the Attribute, we are told, there follows directly an "immediate infinite and eternal mode," and from this a "mediate infinite and eternal mode"; both these infinite modes covering the whole modal system. Thus, from the Attribute of Extension, there flow, immediately, "motion and rest," and, mediated by this mode, "the structure (facies) of the universe in its entirety" (see Ep. 32, to Oldenburg). Finite modes are individual wholes, constituting subordinate differentiations within these primary and all-pervasive entities. Similarly, within the modal system of Ideas. Spinoza's theory is doubtless very difficult, nor is it set forth with the detail that we would desire; but the principle at least is clear, that there are grades of perfection or reality, exhibited both in the relation of Natura Naturans to Natura Naturata, and, with richer complexity, within Natura Naturata itself. Spinoza frankly confesses that the terms "whole" and "part" are inadequate to express this relationship. He conceives extended Nature as an individual, mirrored, alike in its wholeness and in its individuality, in the hierarchy of its constituent members; and likewise, God's infinite thought as mirrored in finite minds and thoughts, each of which possesses individuality in the measure of its wholeness. For the structure of the modal system in one Attribute is identical with the modal structure in every other. Ordo et connexio idearum idem est ac ordo et connexio rerum" (II, 7). It follows that not only the human body, but all bodies, have their mind-aspect: Omnia, quamvis diversis gradibus, animata sunt (II, 13 S). The modes of thought, however, possess the peculiarity of self-consciousness and have themselves, as well as the knower's body, for their object. To know, says Spinoza, is to know that we know, and so forth; i.e. an idea, which is the act of knowing the body as its ideatum, becomes in that very act an ideatum to itself. A further question presses on us in regard to Spinoza's theory of 279</page><page sequence="10">PHILOSOPHY Natura Naturata. We have been speaking hitherto of the modes of God, infinite and finite, in their timeless reality. What, then, about the world as it comes to us in sense-experience, as a series of events in time? What, for Spinoza, is the status of the "world of presenta- tion," of what he terms the "common order of Nature"? We must confine ourselves to a dogmatic statement of what seems to be Spinoza's view. The spatio-temporal world, as we perceive it, is no mere illusion. The image of the sun as at 200 feet distance is true as far as it goes; we do actually see thus, and, when we know the fuller truth of science, we understand that, given the conditions, the image cannot be otherwise. Error arises only when we judge that the sun is really at that pictured distance. In view of Spinoza's doctrine that an idea is always an act of judgment, the error is not easy to explain. The world of presentation, though real in its measure, carries us but a very little way towards the truth it claims to represent. It is a fragment, apprehended in detachment from its context, arbitrarily isolated from the system of which it forms a part. Time is a form of this imperfect apprehension. Think out the system of Natura Naturata, and the semblance of time will be transcended in knowledge of the timeless reality. It is a basic assumption of Spinoza's metaphysic that eternity must needs manifest itself, for man's inadequate apprehension, under the form of temporal duration. How this is so, he is avowedly unable to explain; that it is so, is to be accepted as certain truth. To give a full rationale of experience is possible only for the infinite intellect of God. IV In the knowledge of God's eternal perfection and of his own reality as an eternal mode of God, lies man's salvation. That indi- viduality consists in eternity is the central thought of Spinoza's Ethics. "In God there is given of necessity an idea, which expresses the essence of this and of that human body under the form of eternity" (V, 22). There is no thought here of Pantheistic absorption; in the experience of union with God a man realizes his full individuality. In the experience he is, and knows himself to be, eternal; not everlasting, nor immortal, for eternity excludes any thought of temporal duration. We have noted that man attains this goal by way of knowledge. All other forms of conscious experience-emotion, desire, volition-depend on the adequacy or inadequacy of intel- lectual apprehension. Theoria entails praxis; rather, it is itself praxis, for to have an idea is already an act of self-realization. "Our mind is partly active, partly passive; in so far as it has adequate ideas, it is of necessity active, and in so far as it has inadequate ideas, it is of necessity passive." "The mind's actions arise solely from its 280</page><page sequence="11">SPINOZA adequate ideas; but its passions depend solely on its inadequate ideas" (III, I and 3). In this activity of self-knowledge and self- maintenance, man finds liberation from bondage and achieves virtue and felicity. The conditions of this spiritual pilgrimage and the steps in its accomplishment are described in Parts III, IV, and V of the Ethics. We see men at the start, like Plato's prisoners in the cave, shackled in a land of shadows, and impotent to rid themselves of the bonds of circumstance and passion. How a being who, though deficient in reality, is yet a mode of God's eternal perfection, can be thus vic- timized by error; and how, if once so placed, he can ever enter upon the path of liberation-are problems wellnigh insoluble within the bounds of Spinoza's system. But, assuming the possibility, let us note the stages of the process by which inadequate knowledge is transmuted into adequate, and therewith slavery to passion into the active emotion of love towards God. "An emotion," Spinoza tells us, "cannot be controlled or removed save by a contrary emotion stronger than that which is to be controlled" (IV, 7). Knowledge does not suffice of itself; its liberating efficacy is due to its emotional correlate. When we know a passion for what it truly is, a necessary link in the order of nature, it ceases to be a passion and is transformed into the contrary active emotion. A, for example, hates B as the apparent cause of his diminished vitality or pain; but the knowledge that B's act was a necessary moment in the eternal order dissolves the hatred by arousing the contrary sense of heightened being together with the idea of God as its cause, i.e. an active emotion of love to God. "That emotion which is a passion ceases to be a passion, as soon as we form a clear and distinct idea thereof" (V, 3). In comprehending a present sorrow as in truth God's timeless decree, it ceases to afflict us; we are purged of vain regret and find rest in sharing in the divine love. E la sua voluntate e nostra pace. Spinoza distinguishes three grades of knowledge, carrying with them three grades of moral progress. There is, first, the grade of Imaginatio, from which all men start, covering the whole field of sense-experience. On this initial plane, the mind apprehends itself and the surrounding world as an aggregate of events in time, in an unending chain of local and temporal conjunction, forming "the common order of nature." Empirical inductions and class- concepts, as well as table-talk and hearsay, fall within its scope; the "idols" of Bacon's Novum Organum were undoubtedly present to Spinoza's mind. Time, Number, and Measure are its distinctive instruments (auxilia imaginationis). Though, as we have noted, the knowledge it yields is not necessarily false, it is riddled with sub- jectivity, the product of psychological association and chance coincidence. The mind is at the mercy of whatever happens to affect 281</page><page sequence="12">PHILOSOPHY the body at the moment and of the traces left by prior affections upon the organism. The ethical correlate of this kind of knowledge is a life swayed by fitful gusts of passion, without principle or rational control, the life of Plato's "democratic" soul, which is "everything by starts and nothing long," or, at the worst, of the "tyrannical soul," enslaved to one bestial appetite. Against this dark background of man's natural servitude emerges the second grade of apprehension, that of ratio or scientific know- ledge. The mind rises to apprehend the world as a realm of necessary and timeless truths, deducible, as are the properties of a geometrical figure, from simple self-evident principles. Our own individuality, and that of all other things, is resolved into a structure of universal law. Spinoza's Ethics is an example of this type of knowing. On this level, all ideas are true. "The essence of reason (ratio) is nought save our mind in so far as it clearly and distinctly understands" (IV, 26). Time has vanished with imaginative thinking; all is known in the timeless order of Natura Naturata. "It is of the nature of reason to contemplate things as necessary, and not as contingent. Moreover, it perceives this necessity of things truly, as it is in itself. But this necessity of things is the very necessity of God's eternal nature. Therefore it is of the nature of reason to contemplate things under this form of eternity" (II, 44, C 2). The corresponding life is one governed wholly by active emotion. "By this power of rightly ordering and systematizing the bodily affections we can escape from being easily affected by evil emotions. For greater strength is needed to constrain emotions which are ordered and systematized in accordance with their order in respect to the intellect than those which are uncertain and shifting" (V, o1 S). It is a life of social co-operation, directed to a common good. The individualism which brings Spinoza's political theory, on the level of Imaginatio, into close relationship with that of Hobbes, is now transcended in a view of society organized on the basis of reason, that stretches far beyond Hobbes' horizon. But the rational life is none the less one of pleasur- able self-realization. Since pleasure is defined as the sense of transi- tion from a lower to a higher grade of perfection, and love as pleasure accompanied by the thought of its cause; and since on the plane of ratio the cause is known to be God; it follows that the life of reason is characterized by love of God. "He who clearly and distinctly understands his emotions, loves God; and loves Him the more, the more he understands himself and his emotions" (V, I5). As this love flows from the knowledge of God's immanence in all things, it is the strongest and most constant of the emotions. There is no directly contrary emotion that can destroy it. "Since it (i.e. amor Dei) is the highest good which we can seek under the guidance of reason, and one common to all mankind, we desire that all shall 282</page><page sequence="13">SPINOZA delight therein; it cannot therefore be tainted by the emotion of envy or of jealousy, but contrariwise must be fostered the more, the more men share our joy" (V, 20). But knowledge, Spinoza tells us, is possible on a yet higher plane. "Reason by itself," he writes in the Treatise on the Improvement of the Intellect, "will not be the means whereby we attain to our per- fection." Beyond ratio, though springing from it as its source, is the knowledge of scientia intuitiva. At this third grade, the mind rises above mediate and discursive thinking. For Spinoza, as for Plato, the field of intellectual activity is wider than that of ratiocination. On the side of the knower, the knowledge in question is intuitive vision; on the side of the object known, God and His modes are grasped, not as a system of universal laws, but in their eternal indi- viduality. God for Spinoza is the One in Many, and the Many are as real as the One. In scientia intuitiva, the human thinker appre- hends God's unity in difference by a timeless act of vision, and therein is, and knows himself to be, eternal. That in this experience he realizes to the full his individual personality is clearly indicated by Spinoza in the closing propositions of Part V. In the Scholium to Prop. 20 he tells us that henceforward he will consider the Love of God quatenus ad solam mentem refertur, apart from its relation to the body. The implications of this statement are greatly dark, and we wonder how Spinoza would have developed the doctrine that the human body "cannot suffer destruction but somewhat of it remains that is eternal." Both the concepts of Love of God and Eternity undergo significant, if subtle, modification. The earlier definition of Amor, "pleasure accompanied by the idea of an external cause," is obviously inapplicable on the plane of intuitive knowledge; God is not an external cause, nor is man's love for Him to be de- scribed as pleasure. For pleasure is the sense of transition to greater perfection, and here transition is superseded in attainment. "Although this Love of God has no beginning, yet it has all the perfections of Love, just as if it had come to be in time.... Nor is there here any difference, save that the mind has had these perfections, which we imagined to be added to it, from all eternity, and that accompanied by the idea of God as eternal cause. But if pleasure consists in transition to greater perfection, felicity (beatitudo) must assuredly consist in this, that the mind is in actual possession of perfection" (V, 33). Nor is there any longer a place for the distinction, never clearly expounded by Spinoza, between the cognitive and emotional aspects of conscious life; the amor Dei of the grade of ratio now becomes amor Dei intellectualis. So, too, what was then known "under a certain form (sub quadam specie) of eternity" is now known, without qualifying restriction, sub specie aeternitatis. Once more; on the lower level of ratio, since God is expers passionum, 283</page><page sequence="14">PHILOSOPHY "he who loves God cannot endeavour that God may love him in return" (V, I9). In scientia intuitiva, love, as we have seen, acquires a richer meaning; with the transformation of pleasure into felicity, the relation between God and man becomes one of reciprocal com- munion. In the words already quoted, "God, in so far as He loves Himself, loves men; and consequently God's love towards men and the mind's intellectual love towards God are one and the same." The relationship is of individual to individual, and the eternity therein realized is likewise an individual experience. Sentimus experimurque nos (the plural, here and in V, 36 C, is unambiguous) aeternos esse: "we have conscious experience of our (individual) eternity." Spinoza's way of life culminates in personal fruition. "Thus we 'clearly comprehend wherein lies our salvation, that is to say, our felicity or freedom; to wit, in constant and eternal love towards God, or, in other words, in God's love towards men. This love or felicity is called in the sacred writings 'the Glory of God,' and with good reason. For whether this Love be referred to God or to our mind, it can rightly be termed 'peace of mind' (acquiescentia animi), and this is the same as glory" (V, 36 S). V No attempt has been made in the foregoing outline to discuss the validity of Spinoza's philosophy. A few of the difficulties have been indicated in passing; others will readily occur to the mind of the discerning reader. We find, for instance, that Spinoza himself towards the close of his life was troubled over the theory of Extension. In the last of his extant letters (Ep. 83), in answer to Tschirnhaus, he writes: "As regards your question, whether the variety of things can be demonstrated a priori from the concept of extension alone, I think I have already shown with sufficient clearness that this is impossible; and that consequently matter has been ill defined by Descartes through extension, but that it ought necessarily to be explained through an attribute expressing eternal and infinite essence. But I will perhaps discuss these questions with you more clearly at some future time, if my life is spared. For up to now I have never been able to set any of my thoughts on these things in order." The statement is brief and cryptic, save in the implica- tion of an appeal to experience and in the rejection of Descartes's view of extension as a quiescent mass and of motion as due to God's action ab extra. Little light is thrown on the problems that vex the mind of the modem student. What does Spinoza mean by the indivi- sible extension that is attributed to God? Or by its dynamic efficacy, as possessed of timeless causal energy? How can motion be conceived apart from time, as an infinite and eternal mode flowing immediately 284</page><page sequence="15">SPINOZA from God's extension ? And in what sense can finite extended bodies be eternal? It would be rash to suppose that Spinoza was contem- plating such a radical revision of his metaphysics as a solution of these questions would have involved. Yet it is impossible to read the Second Part of the Ethics without gathering the impression that his thought is moving on lines that herald the latest developments of modern physics. He was certainly not a victim to what Professor Whitehead has called "the fallacy of simple location." The corpus- cular atomism outlined in the pages following on II, I3 is admittedly provisional. The difficulty just referred to lies rather in understanding Spinoza's theory than in any demonstrable incoherence in his system. When we ask, however, as to the validity of his ethical doctrine, the case is otherwise. Of the possibility of moral liberation by way of know- ledge he was assured by personal experience. Were it not so, the whole faith that inspired him to write the Ethics would have been vain. Yet the experience and the faith alike seem irreconcilable with the principles of his metaphysics. If time be but "an aid of the imagi- nation," that vanishes for clearer knowledge in eternity, what real significance can we attach to the transition from a state of ignorance and vice to that of virtue? Doubtless Spinoza believed that there was place for transition and movement, construed in some non-temporal sense, within timeless fruition, and the belief has been championed by some of his moder commentators; but is it capable of intelligible meaning? The problem of evil, too, is on our hands. For, unless moral experience be robbed of all significance, moral evil, and the intellectual error from which it springs, must have a positive status in reality. Error is not mere ignorance, or vice mere deficiency of goodness. Yet, on Spinoza's principles, they must be explained away as sheer negation. How can God stand, as moral experience demands, in detachment from the law of His own being? Even if the appearance of positivity in evil be regarded as an illusion, it must yet fall, as illusion, within God. Or, to put the problem in yet another form, does not Spinoza's thorough-going determinism, with its insistent rejection of freedom of choice, cut the ground from under his belief in moral redemption? That he allows full scope for the higher freedom, that of self-depen- dence and self-causality, proper to God and to those who in God have attained perfection, will not save him from the impasse; what is at stake is the possibility of passing out of the state of bondage and entering upon the road to such attainment. These questions were raised in correspondence with Spinoza by van Blyenbergh, a worthy and rather simple-minded burgher of Amsterdam. Van Blyenbergh was no philosopher, and in the event his verbose and tedious letters provoked Spinoza to cut short the controversy in despair. Moder 285</page><page sequence="16">PHILOSOPHY commentators have, almost with one voice, dismissed van Blyen- bergh's objections as those of an ignorant amateur, unworthy of the great philosopher's attention. But they remained unanswered, for the simple reason that no possible answer could be given to them. Moral experience is inexplicable on the basis of Spinoza's meta- physic. He could neither account for the fact of vice, nor, granting the fact, for the victim's liberation from enslavement. If deliverance be possible-and, as we have said, Spinoza never dreamt of ques- tioning it-it can only be by driving a breach through the nexus of determinism. As a living Italian critic, Guzzo, has acutely shown, the breach occurs in the very section of the Ethics where the mechanism of Spinoza's theory is most pronounced, in the 43rd Proposition of Part III. The mechanistic doctrine of emotion requires that if A is hated, or loved, by B, he must hate, or love, B in return (III, 40). A little later (III, 43) we read that "hatred is increased by reciprocated hatred, and on the other hand can (potest) be destroyed by love." The first of these two clauses follows strictly from the mechanism. A, being hated by B, hates B back, and B's original hatred is strengthened as a consequence of the reciprocation. But how are we to understand the second clause? If A, when hated by B, responds with love, naturally B's hatred is diminished or annulled by the response. But how can A respond with love? The mechanism necessitates a response of hatred; yet we are told that a contrary response of love is possible. Spinoza has unwittingly, by help of a seemingly innocent "potest," severed the deterministic chain and, by so doing, rendered feasible the initiation of the saving process of liberation. To reply that the response of hatred is prompted by imaginative thinking, while that of love springs from knowledge of reason, is true but unavailing. The difficulty is only thrown a stage farther back. The issue is how man can ever rise, conformably to Spinoza's system, from a lower plane of knowledge to a higher. Spinoza's way of life, in short, reveals a far-reaching incoherence in his philosophy. Nor have the efforts, either of Spinoza or of his modern interpreters, to dispel the criticism proved, in our opinion, satisfactory. But Spinoza's greatness as a philosopher does not rest on the finality of his doctrines. A metaphysical system can only claim to be final under pain of self-contradiction; for, as Hegel said in words that Spinoza would willingly have endorsed, "the life of mind is not one that shuns death and keeps clear of destruction; it endures its death, and in death maintains its being." Nor does his greatness depend on his influence on succeeding generations. Spinoza recked lightly of transitory honour, and to measure his worth sub specie durationis savours of impertinence. For a century after his death, his message was ignored or misunderstood. With the dawn of the 286</page><page sequence="17">SPINOZA German Enlightenment, he came into his own. His fame has grown steadily ever since. To-day all serious thinkers acknowledge him for their master. It has been said that every philosopher has two philosophies, his own and Spinoza's. Those who are most conscious of the difficulties of the Ethics can yet draw from its study something of the eternal peace in which Spinoza found the cure for his "mortal sickness." For the true source of his greatness lies beyond "the splendours of the firmament of time," in the flight of speculative genius whereby "a mind, for ever wandering through strange seas of thought, alone" won timeless fruition in the knowledge and love of God. NOTE The best English version of the Ethics is by Hale White (Oxford Press). The Ethics, together with the fragment on The Improvement of the Intellect, is also translated in the Everyman Series. Students are recommended to consult Professor Joachim's Study of the Ethics of Spinoza (Clarendon Press) and Professor Hallett's Aeternitas (Clarendon Press). For those who can read Italian, Guzzo: II pensiero di Spinoza (Vallechi, Firenze) is a valuable com- mentary on all Spinoza's writings. 287</page></plain_text>
