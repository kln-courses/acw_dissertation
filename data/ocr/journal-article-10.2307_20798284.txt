Despite the fact that a considerable amount of works on the life and thought of this great statesman, philosopher and com mentator have come to light during the past hundred years,1 to this day almost no in-depth treatments of aspects of his exegetical methodology have been published.2 This might have its practical reasons, such as the * Thanks are due to the anonymous reviewer whose comments and suggestions improved the article considerably (all remaining deficiencies are my sole responsibility); my brother, Professor Tanni Haas of Brooklyn College, and my brother-in-law, Martin Sykes-Haas, for comments on grammar and style; S?rit Kattan Gribetz, who carried out the copy-editing on behalf of the Jewish Studies Quarterly; Pazit Magen for her almost tireless efforts to obtain relevant materials for me. 1 For a thorough, though not exhaustive, survey of Abarbanel scholarship from the middle of the nineteenth century to the end of the twentieth century (1994), see: Eric Lawee, "Isaac Abarbanel's intellectual achievement and literary legacy in modern scho larship: A retrospective and opportunity," Studies in Medieval Jewish History and Lit erature 3 (2000), pp. 215-219 [henceforth: Lawee, Achievement].

Under preparation is a much needed (see: Lawee, Achievement, p. 223) study on Abarbanel's approach to biblical chronology. A few aspects of Abarbanel's somewhat surprising stand on this issue will be analysed in the present study. 3 See: Jakob Guttmann, Die Religionsphilosophischen Lehren des Isaak Abravanel, Breslau 1916, p. 16; Menachem Kellner, "Isaac Abravanel on dogma and faith," Da 'at 32-33 (1994), pp. 47-59, pp. xlvii - lix; Leo Strauss, "On Abravanel's philosophical tendency and political teaching," in: B.

Z. Segal, "R. Isaac Abarbanel as a biblical commentator," Tarbiz 8 (1937), pp. 281, 289 [Hebrew; henceforth: Segal, Com mentator]. 4 A long line of Renaissance influences have been traced in Abarbanel's writings (see, for instance: Moshe idei, "Qabbalah and the ancient philosophy in Isaac and Judah Abravanel," in: M. Dorm?n and Z. Levi [eds.], The Philosophy of Love of Leone Ebreo, Haifa 1985, pp. 73-112 [Hebrew; henceforth: Idei, Qabbalah]; Eleazar Gutwirth, "'Consolatio:' Don Ishaq Abravanel and the classical tradition," Medievalia et Huma n?stica 27 [2000], pp. 79-98; Cedric Cohen-Skalli, "The dual humanism of Don Isaac Abravanel," Leituras 14-15 [2004], pp. 151-171; ibid., "Discovering Isaac Abravanel's humanistic rhetoric," Jewish Quarterly Review 97, 1 [2007], pp. 67-99 [henceforth: Co hen-Skalli, Discovering]; Brian Ogren, "Circularity, the soul-vehicle and the Renais sance rebirth of reincarnation: Marsilio Ficino and Isaac Abrabanel on the possibility of transmigration," Accademia 6 [2004], pp. 63-94, and more), but there can be no doubt that Abarbanel's basic Weltanschauung is to a large extent medieval in essence (see: Benzion Netanyahu, Don Isaac Abravanel: Statesman and Philosopher, trans, by Aharon Amir, Tel Aviv 2005, p. 129-130 [Hebrew; henceforth: Netanyahu, Statesman]; Lawee, Tradition, p. 169). For a similar case of a scholar incorporating Renaissance influences into a worldview firmly anchored in the Middle Ages, see: Robert Bonfil, "The book of the Honeycomb's Flow by Judah Messer Leon: The rhetorical dimension of Jewish humanism in fifteenth-century Italy," Jewish History 6, 1-2 (1992), pp. 21-33. 5 For example, the second part of Netanyahu's biography (Statesman, pp. 117-270) carries the headline 'Exegete and philosopher,' but is in actuality nothing but a sys tematic exposition of Abarbanel's principal philosophical and theological doctrines, mainly based on views scattered throughout his biblical commentaries. Cedric Co hen-Skalli has written an important criticism of this philological-thematical method, adopted by the great pioneers of Abarbanel studies throughout the greater part of the twentieth century, which completely ignores Abarbanel's humanistically influenced eclecticism (Cedric Cohen-Skalli, The Humanist Rhetoric of Don Isaac Abravanel: Rhetoric, History and Tradition in Isaac Abravanel's Introductions and letters, Ph.D thesis, Tel Aviv 2005, pp. 5^0 [Hebrew]; a shorter version of this criticism is to be</page><page sequence="3">304 Jair Haas JSQ 17 tical principles goes deeper than what can be attributed to lack of pa tience or general disinterestedness among students of medieval intellec tual history. Abarbanel's exegesis defies exact definition, it does not easily fit into the categories that usually serve to analyse exegetical meth odologies. Here lies, it seems, the root of the matter. As will be demon strated, scholars have expressed widely different opinions concerning the essential nature of Abarbanel's commentaries, thus testifying to the dif ficulty inherent in the task of defining them. It is the purpose of the present study to trace the source of the problematic nature of Abarba nels' biblical commentaries, in the hope of overcoming some of the scho larly aversions and stimulating further research into one of the most colourful and variegated of exegetical corpora produced by medieval Jewry. What is attempted here is a general introduction to Abarbanel's main exegetical concerns, a demonstration of the ways in which he met and dealt with those concerns, and finally an attempt to comprehend the exegetical frame of mind in which Abarbanel's interpretive methods found their inherent justification. The study is not meant to be exhaus tive. On the contrary, one of its additional purposes is to indicate the urgent need for more specific, local studies on a host of issues relating to Abarbanel's exegetical principles in all their perplexity, as well as to suggest the basic lines along which these ought to be carried out. But before proceeding to the exposition of the author's personal understand ing of Abarbanel's exegesis, it is in place to provide some insight into the surprising range of existing opinions on this subject. found in: ibid., Discovering, pp. 68-72). To this I would like to add that this eclecticism is not an accidental trait of Abarbanel's exegesis due to his partly humanistic intellec tual environment, but it serves him in his aspirations to solve all exegetical difficulties in (what seemed to him) a satisfactory manner. For example, in his efforts to justify the fact of the great luminaries having been created for the sake of such a lowly creature as Man (Gen 1:14-18), Abarbanel offers no less than three alternative explanations (Isaac Abarbanel, Commentary on Genesis, ed. by Yehuda Shaviv, Jerusalem 2008, pp. 99-103 [henceforth: Abarbanel, Genesis]), and even though they are all mutually exclusive, he somewhat surprisingly airs the view that a multiplicity of explanations only increases the surety in the difficulty having been satisfactorily settled: 'Have I not offered you a threefold solution to this last difficulty [...] all of them being true in the eyes of the man of understanding and straight to the searcher of truth? And if you join them all to gether and accumulate them, there is no doubt that "the threefold chord is not easily cut off" (Eccles 4:12)' (ibid., p. 60). Towards the end of the present study a contra diction in Abarbanel's view on Man's superiority over the Beast, also stemming from the aim of solving exegetical difficulties as they presented themselves, will be analyzed.</page><page sequence="4">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 305 Scholarly opinions on the nature of Abarbanel's exegesis Abarbanel undoubtedly considered himself a champion of peshat - usually translated as the plain or literal meaning of the text - a term frequently used by him in order to characterise his own exegesis.6 In one of the more recent studies on Abarbanel, author Eric Lawee claims that 'Abarbanel defined himself first and foremost as a seeker of Scripture's plain sense and lived up to his representations on this score.'7 But not only does Lawee affirm Abarbanel's basic self-understanding as an ex egete of Scripture's literal meaning, on several occasions he also bewails the fact that scholars writing on Abarbanel's exegesis have failed to stress this point,8 some even neglecting it altogether.9 But this begs an 6 As will be demonstrated below, n. 41, in the vast majority of cases Abarbanel's use of this term is not significantly different from that of the great literal exegetes of the eleventh and twelfth centuries. 7 Lawee, Tradition, p. 94. More or less agreeing with Lawee is Samuel Gr?nberg ("Eine Leuchte der Bibelexegese um die Wende des Mittelalters," Jeschurun 25 (1928), p. 25): 'Trotzdem Abarbanel in sehr vielen Stellen die interessantesten Agadoth anf?hrt [...] bem?ht er sich doch ?berall nur den Peshat, den einfachen Schriftsinn festzustellen.' 8 See: Lawee, Achievement, p. 236, . 29; ibid., Tradition, p. 254, . 13. According to Avraham Grossman ("Biblical exegesis in Spain in the thirteenth-fifteenth centuries," in: H. Beinart (ed.), The Sephardic Heritage, Jerusalem 1992, p. 116 [Hebrew]) Abarba nel's desire to be original and not just to rely on his predecessors led him to offer many forced and far-fetched interpretations. I personally find this kind of reasoning implau sible. Unless Abarbanel thought he had something real and important to contribute to biblical studies, he would hardly have troubled himself by writing such bulky commen taries. In the present study I argue that the unconvincing nature of Abarbanel's exeg esis has its source in the much more serious-minded ambition of showing the Torah's absolute, divine perfection, as will be explained shortly. According to Ephraim Shmueli ("Faith and science in biblical exegesis," In: J. Rosenthal et. al. (eds.), Sefer HaYovel - Mayer Waxman, Jerusalem 1966, p. 265 [Hebrew]), 'In the books of the Bible Abarba nel seeks the divine intention in the world, the meaning of history, and the verification of his own hopes, which is why his commentaries are cast between the plain meaning and the homiletical meaning [...] his orientation is philosophical-religious, not scienti fic-exegetical.' These words are much closer to my own conceptions of Abarbanel's exegesis (see below). 9 In his short survey on the last commentators of Spain and Provence and the commentators of Italy (R. Isaiah of Trani, R. Jacob ben Asher, R. Joseph ibn Kaspi, R. Levi ben Gershom and Abarbanel), Shnayer Leiman (Commentators, pp. 91-98) characterises the first four commentators as pursuers of Scripture's plain sense, while such a characterisation is conspicuosly absent in the case of Abarbanel. In the synopsis of Louis Rabinowitz ("Abravanel as exegete," in: B. Trend and H. Loewe (edsj, Isaac Abravanel - Six Lectures, Cambridge 1937, p. 83 [henceforth: Rabinowitz, Exegete]) Abarbanel's exegesis is defined as being of 'rational and original character,' and in that of Shaul Regev ("Abarbanel's exegetical method," Mahanayim 4 (1993), p. 242 [Hebrew]) as 'philosophical-rational,' but no mention of Scripture's plain sense is to be found in either of them.</page><page sequence="5">306 Jair Haas JSQ 17 other question. Is it reasonable to assume that the repeated failure to acknowledge a central and dominant characteristic of Abarbanel's ex egetical writings is due to mere coincidence or forgetfulness, or does it perhaps reflect an intuition reaching deeper than that? To my mind the last possibility is by far the most probable. Certainly, when M. Z. Segal repeatedly labels Abarbanel's commentaries as der ash - homiletic exeg esis - he must have found in them something that made such a character isation come to his mind: R. Isaac Abarbanel did not enrich the treasury of Hebrew Bible exegesis with objective commentaries of lasting value. His commentaries in general are commentaries of der ash, rabbinical or philosophical or historical der ash. As other masters of derash Abarbanel approaches the Bible from a subjec tive standpoint, explaining Scripture not from the point of view of the bib lical author but rather from the point of view of the commentator himself.10 Is Abarbanel then a seeker of Scripture's plain sense, as Lawee would have it, or is he the master of derash that Segal claims him to be? Even before examining Abarbanel's commentaries, this startling difference of opinion between two scholars relating to the same exegetical corpus should arouse in us at least a suspicion that the terms peshat and derash might not be the most suitable means of achieving an understanding of its true nature. This does not mean that it is neither one nor the other nor even both of them, but it points to the fact that the attempt to define, at the very outset, the entirety of Abarbanel's exegesis as belong ing exclusively to one or another methodological category seems to be an overly simplistic approach. There is no inherent justification in the assumption that any given commentator must first and foremost be ca tegorised in terms of one methodology or the other. This study argues that Abarbanel had more pressing exegetical concerns than developing a consistent methodology, and methodological considerations, important as they seem to have been even in the eyes of Abarbanel, were subordi nate to these concerns. The dogmatic nature of Abarbanel's exegesis For reasons soon to become clear it has been decided that the focus of this study will be mainly on Abarbanel's commentary on the Torah, and not on his commentaries to the Prophets (he did not produce any com 10 Segal, Commentator, p. 289. All translations from the Bible, the commentators and modern scholars are mine unless stated otherwise.</page><page sequence="6">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 307 mentaries on the Writings). Abarbanel's main objective in his Torah commentary, as the present author understands it, has already been discussed by Mayer Waxman, who spoke of the entirety of his biblical commentaries: He aimed at showing the rationality as well as the sublime holiness of the Scriptures, that they are all completely perfect and contain no contradic tions and inconsistencies, if only it be properly known how to see through the veil of the words [...] Abarbanel's overall purpose was to extract from Scripture its hidden light in its full splendor. This hidden light is expressed in four aspects: 1) historic authenticity, 2) literary beauty and order, 3) har mony with rational and scientific truths, 4) theological veracity. Any fact, any incident, any book whose literal meaning is incompatible with these four aspects is in need of explanation and illumination [...] Don Isaac's main goal was, as already indicated, to refine and purify the Scriptures from any flaw and dross, and he made an effort to harmonise them as much as possible with the [demands of the] intellect and with [the knowledge of] nature, even if this sometimes compelled him to clarify them in an uncon vincing manner.11 I agree in principle with Waxman's basic conclusion, according to which Abarbanel's overall exegetical concern was to demonstrate Scripture's perfection from a host of perspectives relating to both content and form. But it is true only concerning the Torah. With regard to the re maining books, Abarbanel was all but aware of the implications of their human authorship. He was, in fact, a pioneer in pinpointing the limita tions of the biblical authors, their intellectual powers, literary skills etc.12 But when it comes to the Torah, the approach changes radically. The starting point of Abarbanel's commentaries on the Torah is his unwa vering conviction that the Torah, due to its divine origin, must ipso facto be superior to any other (humanly authored) literary work.13 Therefore, 11 Waxman, Don Isaac, pp. 76, 87. 12 See: Lawee, Scholarship, pp. 208-210. 13 This change of approach is reflected in Abarbanel's stance toward a host of issues. I would like to mention three of the more prominent ones here: (1) The Kri u Ktiv phenomenon: In his introduction to the commentary on Jeremiah, Abarbanel relates the many strange Kri forms in this biblical book in particular to the fact of Jeremiah having been 'a young lad when beginning to prophesy, and therefore unexper ienced in the ways of grammar and eloquent writing.' The Ktiv is seen as the correc tions that Ezra the Scribe added in the margin. The same phenomenon appearing in the Torah is seen not as expressing any deficiency in the Mosaic literary style, but as 'the secret mysteries of the Torah,' while the Ktiv is the explanantion of the words according to their simple meaning (Isaac Abarbanel, Commentary on Latter prophets, Bnei Ar ve'el Publishing House, Jerusalem 1979, pp. 298-300 [henceforth: Abarbanel, Latter prophets]); (2) The aethiological expression 'unto this day:' In the introduction to the commentary on the Former Prophets (Isaac Abarbanel, Commentary on Former Pro phets, Torah ve-Da'at Publishing House, Jerusalem 1955, p. 13 [henceforth: Abarbanel,</page><page sequence="7">308 Jair Haas JSQ 17 when undertaking to investigate Abarbanel's exegetical frame of mind, any conclusion that fails to take this change of approach into account is evidently bound to be misleading. Towards the end of the study, the author has provided some preliminary remarks as to the direction to be taken in the study of Abarbanel's remaining commentaries, but al ready at this point it should be clear why the commentary on the Torah must be studied separately. The view of the Torah as possessing divine perfection was undoubt edly shared by Abarbanel's forerunners, but like nobody else before him Abarbanel translated this view into a full-fledged exegetical program. Abarbanel himself testifies to this aim at the end of the series of ques tions preceding his commentary to the second creation story: shall now arise to search' [Can 3:2] and 'to explore with the power of my mind' [Dan 8:15], the ways of this section in a manner that will solve all the questions pertaining to it, not allowing any flaw or doubt to be found in 'God's perfect Torah' [Ps 19:8]. It will then be clear that there can be no contradiction between faith and reason and that the Torah does not deviate from self-evident truths, 'because the ways of the Lord [here a metaphorical expression for: His revealed words] are straight' [Hos 14:10], 'there is noth ing twisted or crooked in them' [Pro 8:8].14 Needless to say, such an attitude does not arise in a vacuum, and before proceeding to the actual demonstration of the way it finds expression in Abarbanel's exegesis, it is incumbent upon us to provide some insight into the spiritual and intellectual climate that spurred it. Former Prophets]), Abarbanel points out that the expression 'unto this day,' that fre quently serves to connect the narrative of the book of Joshua to the reality of the time of the author, shows that this book must have been written down a long time after the events described therein, thus ruling out the view of the talmudic sages (Bava Batra 14, II) that 'Joshua wrote his own book.' There are seven 'problematic' instances of this expression in the Torah (Gen 26:33, 32:33, 47:26; Deut 2:22, 3:14, 10:8, 34:6), and in all of them Abarbanel remains conspicuously silent; (3) The 'repetition of meaning in different words' phenomenon: in his commentaries on the Prophets, Abarbanel is will ing to admit that Scripture sometimes repeats an idea twice or more through a change of formulation, while in his commentary on the Torah he is always meticulous in ex tracting additional meaning from every word or phrase. This feature of Abarbanel's exegesis has been analysed at length in: Haas, Repetition, and will also be discussed below. 14 Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 149. As the reader will notice, Abarbanel's language is replete with fragments and paraphrases of Biblical verses, which is a common feature of the Hebrew religious literature of the time. On one of the ways in which Abarbanel further developed this writing style, see: Jair Haas, "Why were the words of Isaac Arama included in the writings of Isaac Abarbanel?," Sinai 134 (2005), pp. 154-159 [Hebrew]. The present study does not offer any systematic description of this phenom enon, the full aesthetic effect of which cannot be preserved in translation.</page><page sequence="8">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 309 Historical and Intellectual contexts In his study on the role of midrash in Abarbanel's biblical commen taries, Eric Lawee15 suggests that Abarbanel's occupation with layers of meaning beyond the plain one (especially midrash) should be under stood as a response to the achievements of Christian scholars in extract ing moral and religious lessons from the Scriptures by way of additional modes of interpretation: In Abarbanel's day the Christian stimulus for Jewish occupation with aggadah was palpable [...] in the introduction to his compendium of ser mons-turned-homilies written after 1492, Isaac Arama told of parishioners who complained that in reading Holy Writ, 'the Gentiles search enthusias tically for religious and ethical content, using all appropriate hermeneutical techniques', while Jewish commentators merely sought to 'explain the gram matical forms of words and the simple meaning of the stories and com mandments' [...] Arama's description of his audience's perception of Jewish biblical interpretation [...] recalls Abarbanel's deprecation a decade earlier of ibn Ezra-style biblical interpretation.16 On the other hand, Lawee also shows that Abarbanel does hardly forfeit an opportunity to show the incompatibility of midrashic exegesis with Scripture's plain meaning,17 and from here Lawee infers 'Abarbanel's paramount preoccupation with peshuto shel miqra.'ls But the peshat midrash dichotomy that Lawee adopts is far too narrow to serve as a framework for a thorough comprehension of the overall gist of Abarba nel's biblical exegesis.19 As already explained, there is no inherent justi 15 Lawee, Tradition, pp. 91-92. 16 A translation of the relevant passage at the end of Abarbanel's introduction to the Former Prophets is worthwhile in order to understand to what Lawee is referring, and because the present study will offer a different interpretation of it below. Abarba nel wrote: 'It is a bitter evil to me that the great master, Rashi, in his commentaries on the Scriptures, mostly rested content with citing the words of the [talmudic] sages; and that the scholar Abraham ibn Ezra [rested content] with the grammar of the words and the superficial peshat, his interpretation thus being even shorter than the verse itself. And in their wake followed others, who interpreted occasionally according to the de rash, and occasionally according to the superficial and revealed peshat, relating only to the grammar of the book, as if it was an ordinary book of history or just another poem, thus testifying to their own limited comprehension of the verses' true nature. Did they not know and comprehend that the Torah has seventy faces, that great light and abun dant wisdom is present in the Holy Scriptures, which contain the secrets of existence and wondrous measures of divine wisdom? How, then, do they dare expounding them in only a few words?' (Abarbanel, Former Prophets, p. 13). 17 Lawee, Tradition, pp. 94-95. 18 Ibid., p. 94. 19 Symptomatic of this is Lawee's enumeration of Abarbanel's insistence on extract ing meaning from 'ever-so-slight "surface irregularities'" among the 'ways of Midrash'</page><page sequence="9">310 Jair Haas JSQ 17 fication in the assumption that Abarbanel must be understood mainly through his allegiance to one or more exegetical methodologies. Nor should his rhetorical pronouncements concerning such allegiances pre vent us from carrying out a critical examination of his methodological consistency. For such was Abarbanel's aim: to show the absolute perfec tion of the divine Torah, and to present this enterprise as having been carried out within the confinements of peshat. The assessment whether Abarbanel succeeded in this enterprise is a principal topic of the present study. This, of course, does not entail an anachronistic evaluation of Abarbanel's commentaries in light of modern scholarship. Rather, the term peshat in this context - even as Abarbanel nowhere clarifies his exact understanding of this term - should be defined as the hermeneutic axioms of the historical movement in Jewish exegesis that was com mitted to a rationalistic exposition of Scripture's literal meaning as ex emplified through its foremost representatives.20 Abarbanel's frequent rejection of midrashic exegesis, as well as his frequent use of the terms peshat and derash even when characterising the commentaries of his medieval predecessors, show that he was familiar with these axioms and had thoroughly internalised them. It is therefore in order to try and explain why Abarbanel so often strayed from the path of peshat without admitting to it and without turning to midrash. But before ad adopted by Abarbanel (Lawee, Tradition, pp. 109-110). Lawee seems to imply that since this approach is not on par with the assumptions of the 'Andalusian commenta tors [...] and those whom they influenced,' it must be understood as a retreat to the (un)stylistic assumptions of the Midrash. As will be shown below, Abarbanel's ap proach reflects, as a matter of fact, one of the conspicuous characteristics of late fif teenth and early sixteenth century exegesis, and should by no means be attributed to the influence of the Midrash. Gidon Rothstein bases his doctoral thesis ( Writing Mid rash Avot: The Change that Three Fifteenth Century Exegetes Introduced to Avot Inter pretation, its Impact and Origin, Ph. D. thesis, Massachusetts 2003) on a similar faulty assumption, that Abarbanel interpreted Scripture according to the basic attitude of midrashic exegesis (ibid., pp. 1-2, 4-7, 17-26,), and this 'forces' Rothstein (ibid., pp. 61-72) to go out of his way in order to explain why this approach 'spilled over' to Abarbanel's talmudic (Avot, Passover Haggadah, and messianic sayings) and Mai monidean exegesis. But Rothstein's arguments are not entirely convincing, as he him self seems to indicate (ibid., p. 61), and as a matter of fact there is no 'spilling over' here, rather Abarbanel related to the different kinds of texts in accordance with con temporary paradigms of proper literary analysis (more on this below). 20 It should be stressed that the frequent comparisons between Abarbanel's inter pretations and those of his peshat-orientcd predecessors, or their evaluation in light of accepted principles of peshat, are by no means meant to create the impression that Abarbanel's predecessors were all completely consistent exegetes of Scripture's plain meaning. This is far from being the case (cf. Rashi and Nachmanides). Rather the purpose is to demonstrate how far Abarbanel was from adhering to his own declared allegiance to peshat.</page><page sequence="10">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 311 dressing this question it is, as already indicated, incumbent upon us properly to explore the historical context of Abarbanel's exegesis, its incentives and goals. Fifteenth-century Jewish thought saw a substantial shift of emphasis in views on the Torah's role in the fulfillment of Man's ultimate purpose and his attainment of felicity. Generally speaking, major thinkers of preceding centuries, like Abraham ibn Ezra, Maimonides and Gerso nides, saw Man's destiny in the comprehension of eternal truths. In this scheme the fulfillment of religious commandments was considered subordinate, a way of disciplining and educating man to overcome his worldly desires, so that he may invest his energy and intellectual powers in spiritual contemplation. But now the increasingly widespread view was that the study of the Torah, as well as the fulfillment of its practical commandments, are the only way to true felicity,21 which is now brought closer within the reach of everyman. For example, Profayt Duran, in his grammatical work Ma'aseh Efod (1403), dedicates a twenty-five-page long introduction to the exposition of this view, now assigning to a proper knowledge of grammar the role formerly occupied by the Torah itself - an indispensable prerequisite for fulfilling one's destiny. After a lengthy discourse on the question, what constitutes the true wisdom of the Torah, in which Duran refutes the claims of the talmudists, the philosophers and the kabbalists respectively, he concludes: But in my opinion the most sensible conclusion is that what constitutes the wisdom of the Torah is - the very Torah itself! Being ever immersed in it, keeping it in one's heart, encompassing it, and thinking about it incessantly - all these will remove the obstacles preventing man from attaining his ulti mate and eternal purpose [literally: success].22 The Torah is the way to Man's ultimate perfection and self-realisation, and, accordingly, a recurring theme in the religious literature of the time is the absolute, divine perfection of the Torah, almost habitually ex pressed throught the verse The Torah of God is perfect' (Ps 19:8). These are the opening words of Duran's Ma'aseh Efod, and, as seen above, 21 See: Julius Guttmann, The Philosophy of Judaism, trans, by J. L.

This shift of emphasis has its historical causes, the two most impor tant being the internal crisis and disintegration of the Iberian Peninsu la's Jewish communities in the wake of continuous Christian persecution (especially since 1391 but also before that), and Christian attacks to the effect that the Jews occupied themselves almost exclusively with the study of the Talmud while being ignorant of the Scriptures themselves. It was felt that it was in the power of the newly emerging 'bibliocentr ism,' which parallels similar developments within Christianity (the criti cism by men like Marsilius, Ockham and Wycliffe against the papacy, the sacraments and the supremacy of the priesthood),23 to provide a solution to both of these interconnected evils. The adoption of the Tho mistic preference of theology over philosophy could be used to strength en the faith of the masses and through intensified Scriptural study to formulate a clearly defined set of dogmas, while at the same time meet ing the abovementioned Christian argument. This educational program, which sought to base all fields of study in the Bible, rested upon the assumption that ultimately all human knowledge had its source in the Jewish Scriptures.24 This assumption eventually served as the foundation for the specifically Jewish version of the Prisca theologia developed in the early sixteenth century by, amongst others, Isaac Abarbanel and his son Judah,25 and as will be shown below, its importance for the under standing of Abarbanel's exegesis is considerable. But the emphasis on the Torah's perfection has an additional dimen sion to it, insofar it is inspired by some further developments in the Christian anti-Jewish polemics of the era. In the later Middle Ages the Christians developed new techniques of anti-Jewish polemic, one of them being an attack on the Talmud and the rest of post-biblical Jewish religious literature, developed especially by Pablo Christiani at the dis putation at Barcelona (1263) and in Raymond Martini's Pugio Fidei (1278).26 But the attack was not restricted to rabbinic literature only, 23 On the connection between Duran's 'bibliocentrism' and contemporary develop ments within the Catholic church, see: Frank E. Talmage, "The polemical writings of Profiat Duran," In: Barry Dov Walfish (ed.), Apples of Gold in Settings of Silver: Stu dies in Medieval Jewish Exegesis and Polemics, Toronto 1999, p. 282, n. 3. 24 See: Arthur M.

From the polemical work of Profayt Duran, Kl?m?t ha-Goyim (1397), we learn of Christian claims to the effect that the Torah is imperfect in several of its aspects, that is from the point of view of three of its four (Aristotelian) causes, the sufficient, formal (or material28) and final causes respectively.29 Similar discussions - close to Duran's treatment in content and style and clearly dependent on it - are to be found in the polemical work Qeshet u-Magen by Shi mon ben Tzemah Duran30 (1361-1444) and in Sefer ha-Iqqarim (part 3, chapter 25) of Joseph Albo (finished 1425).31 The repeated discussion of this particular issue, which from the Christian side was meant to justify the completion of the Torah in the teachings of Jesus Christ, testifies to the fact that the refusal of these claims must have been conceived as being particularly urgent. This urgency might even have increased with time, for while Profayt Duran - surprising as it is - saw no reason to attack the particular claims of the Christian side head-on, and remained content with the affirmation that 'the Torah of God is perfect,'32 Albo (and Shimon ben Tzemah Duran with him) dedicated considerable space to a systematic rebuttal of each of the Christian claims. But even so, Albo still thought that more work was needed in this particular area of Jewish religious apologetics, and in this he assigned a crucial role to the biblical exegetes. Against the Christian claim that the Torah contains superfluous narratives, Albo affirms that 'there is not a word and not a narrative in the law of Moses which is not essential either to inculcate an 27 See: Jeremy Cohen, The Friars and the Jews : The Evolution of Medieval Anti Judaism, Ithaca 1982, pp. 140-142 28 Duran uses the expression DS57, which probably means 'essence' (formal cause), but might also mean 'substance' (material cause). 29 Profayt Duran, Polemical Writings by Prof?at Duran, ed. by Frank Talmage, Jer usalem 1981, pp. 32-34 [Hebrew; henceforth: Duran, Polemical Writings]. 30 Simon ben Tzemah Duran, Qeshet u-Magen, Jerusalem 1970, pp. 12b-13b. 31 According to Albo's own testimony at the beginning of the chapter, his treatment of the subject reflects 'a discussion I had with a Christian scholar' (Joseph Albo, Sefer ha-Iqqarim, edited and with an English translation and notes by Isaac Husik, Philadel phia 1929-1930, p. 217 [henceforth: Albo, ha-Iqqarim]). There is no reason to cast doubt on the fact that Albo actually met and argued with Christian scholars (cf. his participation in the disputation at Tortosa 1413-1414), but considering the remarkable similarity with the parallel discussions in the works of the Durans, the written account must have undergone considerable syst?matisation in order to encompass the issue from all of its angles. In Albo's account the Christian scholar attacks the Torah with reference to all four of its Aristotelian causes. 32 Duran, Polemical Writings, p. 34.</page><page sequence="13">314 Jair Haas JSQ 17 idea or moral or to explain one of the commandments.'33 After having brought a few examples, Albo concludes this part of the discussion with the words: 'So are all other narratives understood by the initiated, and the commentators of our Torah have explained them at length.'34 More than mirroring the actual state of affairs,35 Albo's words reflect the emergence of new conceptions of the role of the biblical exegete.36 Needless to say, the need for effective rebuttal of the aggressive Chris tian polemics of his time was not lost on the the ever curious and ever absorbing intellect of Abarbanel, who in his commentary on Deuteron omy 23:20-21 engages in a lengthy refutation of what must have been one of the main Christian arguments for the deficiency of the Torah: The Christian scholars deem our Torah imperfect, in that it is occupied with utility rather than with the purity of heart. They prove this from the issue of taking interest from a gentile [...] I shall provide four refuta tions against this claim.'37 Yet another factor that has to be taken into consideration is the some what competitive nature of the encounter of many Jewish scholars with the new learning of the Renaissance.38 The Nophet Tzufim of Judah Messer Leon (1475) is a case at hand. The book's declared purpose is to demonstrate that the then newly (re)emerging science of rhetoric was 33 Albo, ha-Iqqarim, p. 221. 34 Ibid., p. 222. 35 The late fifteenth century Granadean scholar, Sa'adya ibn Danan, readily ac knowledged that this ideal was still far from being realised when he exclaimed that 'the wisdom of our sages has been lost, and our own understanding is too limited to comprehend most of the secrets of the [Torah's] narratives' (Treatise on the Genres, in: Judith Targarona-Borras, "Tratado sobre los g?neros literarios de Se'adyah ibn Danan: edici?n cr?tica, traducci?n y notas," Miscel?nea de Estudios Arabes y Hebraicos 36,2 [1987], pp. 47). 36 Cf. the explanation of Meira Polliack ("The Spanish Legacy in the Hebrew Bible commentaries of Abraham ibn Ezra and Profayt Duran," Encuentros and Desencuen tros: Spanish Jewish Cultural Interaction Throughout History, Tel Aviv 2000, p. 94) re garding why Profayt Duran, despite his appliance of text-critical tools in his polemics against Christianity, never developed into a commentator of Scripture's plain sense: 'In these general circumstances, and those particular to the anti-Jewish riots of 1391, which had a lasting personal effect on Duran and his entire generation, biblical exegesis became the hostage of polemics [...] how could one remain loyal to the "simple sense" of the Hebrew Bible, to the rules of its language and logical exposition, if this meant that at some stage all that one said could be used as evidence against him?' 37 Isaac Abarbanel, Commentary on Deuteronomy, ed by Avishai Shotland, Jeru salem 1999, p. 358 (henceforth: Abarbanel, Deuteronomy). Both Profayt Duran (Polem ical Writings, p. 33) and Albo (ha-Iqqarim, p. 219) mention the taking of interest as one of the deficiencies that the Christians found in the Torah's formal cause. 38 See: Robert Bonfil, Jewish Life in Renaissance Italy, Berkeley, Los Angeles, Lon don 1994, pp. 145-163.</page><page sequence="14">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 315 scriptural in origin. This conviction follows naturally from the faith in the absolute perfection of the divine teaching: I was jealous for the Lord with a great jealousy, and presumed in my heart to show the peoples and the princes that the testimony of the Lord is sure, perfect, and exalted, making wise the simple [...] if thou thinkest I believe that the prophets speak with a tongue that speaketh proud things because I consider their words to comport with what, of the same kind, is found amongst some of the nations [...] I shall be clear from thy oath. But if that which cometh into thy mind is that I have turned to those words and given them credence because they are close to the words of prophecy [...] it will be my mouth that speaketh, behold, here I am.39 Messer Leon felt that unless the Scriptures were shown not to fall from the highest literary standards of the time, they were susceptible to charges of deficiency. But since the distinctiveness of the Jews was de fined by their religious tradition, this would equal Jewish cultural infer iority and was apt to cause a devastating blow to Jewish self-definition and self-esteem. Abarbanel no doubt shared some of those sentiments. Towards the end of this study it will be shown that some of the specific expressions of the Torah's perfection, as conceived by Abarbanel, are strongly reflective of certain humanist literary ideals. Hence, it seems reasonable to conclude that Abarbanel's encounter with the Renais sance, as well, is responsible for his aim to show the Torah's divine perfection. But is this exegetical-apologetical enterprise now to be achieved by turning to additional layers of meaning, such as midrash or allegory? A closer look at Abarbanel's statement of intent in the introduction to his commentary on the Former Prophets40 shows that this was most probably not what he meant by invoking the talmudic maxim about the Torah's 'seventy faces.' Abarbanel's complaint against Ibn Ezra and other commentators of his ilk is that they were too brief and occu pied themselves solely with grammar and with the 'superficial peshaf (probably the meaning of the words), and that they therefore treat the Scriptures as if they were 'an ordinary book of history' or 'just another poem,' failing to do justice to 'the abundance of divine wisdom' found in them. But the occupation with grammar and 'the superficial peshaf is only deemed insufficient to extract from Scripture its abundant wisdom, not misguided, and it is inconceivable that Abarbanel would ever utter words to the effect that the way to reveal the divine wisdom embedded 39 The Book of the Honeycombs Flow, ed. and trans, by Isaac Rabinowitz, Ithaca and London 1983, pp. 9-13. 40 This statement has been translated above, n. 16.</page><page sequence="15">316 Jair Haas JSQ 17 in Scripture is to forsake the way of peshat and engage in allegory or in homiletics (Rashi's exaggerated occupation with homiletics is deemed 'a bitter evil'). Hence, when Abarbanel spoke of the Torah's seventy faces in his introduction to the Former Prophets, he meant to express, meta phorically, the supreme wisdom embedded in the Scriptures, not their polysemous nature. Like Profayt Duran who emphasised that 'the wis dom of the Torah - is the very Torah itself (and not talmudic homiletics or philosophical and mystical allegories), so Abarbanel did not forfeit opportunities to stress that his exegesis is the true peshat. I have been successful in locating no less than 155 such places in the commentaries on the Torah alone,41 far surpassing even the most consistent peshat exegetes among Abarbanel's predecessors.42 The reason for this empha 41 AbarbanePs use of these terms is not significantly different from that of the great literal exegetes of previous centuries. Following the habit of Nachmanides, he usually employs the word peshuto [shel mikra] in order to indicate the simple straightforward meaning of the words (Abarbanel, Genesis, pp. 35, 64, 86, 127, 148 etc.), while the word peshat mostly indicates an interpretation that is based on a rational analysis of the peshuto according to accepted rules of lexicography, grammar, syntax etc. (ibid., pp. 10, 16, 35, 65, 149 etc.). Nevertheless, and not surprising in the least, in many instances it is clear that one of several possible interpretations is deemed the true peshat mainly because it fits in with Abarbanel's overall exegetical concerns. Thus, for exam ple, he interprets the phrase 'a tree of fruits making fruits according to its kind' (Gen 1:11): 'The meaning of this according to its peshat is: a tree of fruits whose fruits bring about [more] fruits [...] when planted in the soil' (ibid., pp. 86-87). Scripture's plain sense also allows for the (commonly accepted) understanding that it is the fruit tree that brings forth fruits, but this would constitute an unnecessary doubling of meaning, inconceivable in Abarbanel's eyes (see below; for similar cases, see: Isaac Abarbanel, Commentary on Numbers, ed. by Yehuda Shaviv, Jerusalem 2007, pp.43, 130 [hence forth: Abarbanel, Numbers]). There are a few cases in which Abarbanel seems to use the term peshat and its derivatives in a somewhat expanded way. For example, in his commentary on the words 'show me now your majesty' (Exod 33:18) he writes: 'This interpretation is in my eyes incompatible with the peshat of the verses, since it is ex ceedingly implausible to assume that Moses would ever ask of the Almighty that he reveal to him his true essence. Even the smallest of philosophers knows that the mind becomes one with the object of its conception, and if anybody were to know God's essence, he himself would become Him' (Abarbanel, Exodus, p. 560). Here the term peshat expresses the true understanding of the verse in accordance with Abarbanel's own a priori theological assumptions. This broadening of the term was to be expected in the writings of a commentator to whom the exposition of Scripture's true literal meaning was no longer the main concern. It is therefore not surprising, as well, that in the commentators that followed in Abarbanel's wake, such as Moses Alsheikh, this development took on further momentum (see below). 42 For comparison with two of the most consistent peshat exegetes of the Middle Ages, Abraham ibn Ezra and David Qimhi (Radaq), who both had a considerable influence on Abarbanel: Ibn Ezra stressed that his interpretations are in accordance with Scripture's literal meaning 82 times throughout his commentaries on the Bible, and Radaq 99 times throughout his Bible commentaries. Ibn Ezra and Radaq both waged a war, each in his own place, against darshanic methods of interpretation, which</page><page sequence="16">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 317 sis is clear: the claim that the Torah is imperfect could be used not only to rationalise the need for a new and superior Torah,' but also to justify the allegorisation of the old one. Thus, Pico della Mirandola, writing only six years after Abarbanel, in the introduction to his commentary on the first 27 verses of Genesis, the Heptaplus (1489), justifies his multi fold allegorical interpretations by pointing out that 'there are many who, drawing their argument from the rough bark of its words, scorn and despise the book of Moses as mediocre and trivial.'43 Thus it seems that towards the end of the fifteenth century the plain sense of the Torah found itself under attack from different and variegated directions, and that this was what spurred Abarbanel to compose his extended and detailed commentaries. But for Abarbanel, the Jew, the path of allegor isation was almost completely blocked,44 lest he justify a mode of inter pretation traditionally used by Christians in order to undermine the practical validity of the commandments.45 But also the gates of midrash, unlike the case of Isaac Arama, were almost shut up, since Abarbanel did not consider the talmudic tradition authoritative as regards the un derstanding of Scripture's plain sense, except for in a very limited num ber of cases.46 The divine perfection of the Torah and its endless wisdom explains their frequent emphasis on the pashtanic character of their own exegesis. In light of this it is probable that also Abarbanel's emphasis serves some kind of polemical purpose, as will be explained shortly. 43 Pico della Mirandola, Heptaplus, trans, by Douglas Carmichael, New York and Indianapolis 1965, p. 70 [henceforth: Pico, Heptaplus}. 44 But see below, that Abarbanel himself engages in allegorising the commandments that became irrelevant with the destruction of the temple - in order to safeguard the Torah's absolute and eternal relevance. 45 Cf. his critique of Maimonides' allegorising of the second creation story brought below. 46 In his introduction to the Former Prophets (p. 13) Abarbanel states that he is not bound by the commentaries of the talmudic sages, unless they can be said to constitute 'a received tradition' (see also: Isaac Abarbanel, Commentary on Exodus, ed. by Avishai Shotland, Jerusalem 1997, p. 76 [henceforth: Abarbanel, Exodus]: 'If it is a received tradition in their possession - we shall accept it, but what I wrote is in accord with Scripture's literal meaning'). Abarbanel does not specify the principles according to which he distinguishes between the original exegesis of the sages and traditions from Sinai that were in their possession. It is not the distinction between halacha (legal material) and aggadah (non-legal material) set forth - as least formally, if not always applied in practice - by Abraham ibn Ezra (see: Yesha'ayahu Maori, "The meaning of the term nm in the commentary of Ibn Ezra on the Torah: On Ibn Ezra's attitude towards rabbinic midrash," Shnaton 13 [2002], pp. 201-246 [Hebrew]), since Abarbanel in many cases interprets halachic material differently from talmudic law (see, for example: Abarbanel, Exodus, p. 348 [commentary on Exod 21:10]). As a matter of fact, it seems that this distinction to a large extent is subordinate to Abarbanel's general aim of proving the Torah's perfection, that is to say, Abarbanel will typically define a certain commentary put forth by the sages as 'received tradition' if it has</page><page sequence="17">318 Jair Haas JSQ 17 were, therefore, to be extracted from its peshat, albeit not from the ana lysis of its grammar or of the superficial meaning of its words, but rather by plunging into its true depths. In what follows, some of the main expressions of Abarbanel's princi pal exegetical concerns and his way of dealing with them will be demon strated. After that, we shall be in a better position to evaluate Abarba nel's hermeneutical consistency and the extent of his adherence to pe shat. Demonstrating Abarbanel's exegetical approach Abarbanel's approach is apologetic in essence. The way to prove the Bible's perfection is to show that it contains no flaws. It is in the ques tions that precede the actual perusal of the biblical text that Abarbanel's apologetic purposes are expressed in their pristine purity. It has been stated that 'the difficulties he [= Abarbanel] propounds are so convin cing, and his solution of them is so unconvincing.'47 But the truth is that from a pashtanic point of view also the questions that Abarbanel poses are, in many cases, unconvincing. They, more than anything else, reveal his aim to explain away every apparent flaw in the text much more than creating a scientific commentary on the Bible. Abarbanel's introductory questions can be roughly divided into two categories: (1) questions that relate explicitly to the form and content of the Scriptures, dealing with a host of instances in which a superficial understanding of the text only might lead one to the (faulty) conclusion that it entails some kind of flaw; (2) questions relating to the inherent logic of the Heilsgeschichte, within its power the ability to neutralise an apparent flaw in the text. For example, in his commentary on Exod 21:24 (Abarbanel, Exodus, pp. 354-355) he reminds his readers that concerning 'the rule "an eye for an eye," tradition [Mekhilta ad. loc.] has deter mined that it is not to be understood literally' (lyfctPDD), since there are many cases where its implementation would not be in accordance with strict justice (as, for exam ple, in case the perpetrator himself has only one functioning eye, and damaging it would cause complete blindness). This example bears out Lawee's determination (Tra dition, p. 104) that 'when Abarbanel vehemently asserts the prophetic authority of mid rashic views, sensitive theological issues are usually close at hand.' But as a matter of fact the authority of the talmudic sages is asserted also when textual flaws are at stake. In his commentary on Exod 23:19 (Abarbanel, Exodus, p. 375) Abarbanel solves a well known 'redundancy' in this way. Concerning the talmudic determination (Hullin 115, II) that the threefold repetition of the prohibition against boiling a kid in its mothers milk (Exod 23:19, 34:26; Deut 14:21) refers to boiling, eating and benefitting from such a stew respectively, Abarbanel states: 'Seeing that this commandment has been thrice repeated, reason affirms that the received teaching of our sages is completely true.' 47 Rabinowitz, Exegete, p. 82.</page><page sequence="18">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 319 the actions of God and men.48 This last category is no less an expression of Abarbanel's apologetic purposes than the first one. Abarbanel had great literary acumen, and he knew well the distinction between the actual events in the lives of the biblical heroes and Scripture's depiction of these events.49 The Bible does not record trivial events, only those that are of historical and, in particular, meta-historical significance, that is to say, the events that constitute the holy history of Israel with God.50 Hence, it is clear that Abarbanel's struggle with this sort of difficulties is no less a matter of preserving the Bible's integrity as a literary work than the questions of the first category.51 This assumption is perfectly borne out by the second example in the analysis that will shortly follow. 48 For example, in the questions preceeding the portion of Gen 47:28-48:22, which will be dealt with shortly, questions 1,11 belong to the first category, while the remain der of the 16 questions belong to the second category These numbers are not repre sentative of the average proportional relationship between the two categories, which usually tends to be more equal. 49 This distinction is implicit in Nachmanides' determination that the Torah relates the events in the lives of the Patriarchs at length in order to hint at events in the lives of their descendants (typology; commentary on Genesis 12:6), as well as in the assertion that the Torah does not contain superfluous words, brought forth by many fourteenth and fifteenth century scholars (the present study brings examples from Joseph ibn Kaspi, Isaac Qanpanton, Joseph Albo and Isaac Abarbanel). 50 Many examples could be brought (see, for example: Haas, Multi-significant, p. 161, n. 54), but I would like to focus on what I consider to be one of the highlights of Abarbanel's exegesis as a whole, his treatment of the prophetic nature of the Former Prophets. As opposed to the divinely given commandments in the Torah and the pro phecies of the future in the Latter prophets, these four books do not hold any intrinsic traits that testify to their inspired character, since chronicle-writing is a well-document ed human enterprise in no need of divine inspiration. Abarbanel's answer is given in accord with the then newly arising ideal of trustworthy, objective history-writing with its inherent critique of the tendentious records current until then (see: D. W. Lomax and R. J. Oakley [eds.], Fern?o Lopes: The English in Portugal 1367-87, Warminster 1988, pp. XXIV-XXVII): 'The prophets were undoubtedly in possession of the differ ent chronicles that are mentioned in the Book of Kings [2Kgs 1:18, 8:23 etc.], in which the judges or the kings or the pious men of each generation and other authors relate the events of their times. But since these were scattered in different places, and since they contained matters of tendentious nature and sometimes included unnecessary material - for such is the habit of the authors and chroniclers, to praise or denounce more than what is befitting in accordance with their own inclinations [literally: love and hate], resulting in an admixture of truth with falsehood and of the essential with the superfluous - it was necessary for the Divine Spirit to rest on those prophets and command them to write down all those stories in a perfect and truthful way. Thus they gathered together all the different documents, and God, may He be blessed, in formed them prophetically about the way to present them in a perfect and truthful manner, how to distinguish truth from falsehood and the essential from the superflu ous' (Abarbanel, Former Prophets, p. 8; on this passage, see also: Lawee, Scholarship, pp. 205-206). 51 For a different view, see below, n. 59.</page><page sequence="19">320 Jair Haas JSQ 17 Comparing the questions that Abarbanel raises with regard to Scrip tural verses with those raised by the outstanding commentators of the preceding centuries brings their apologetic nature into prominence. This will presently be demonstrated by an analysis of two separate cases, each one relevant to one of the two abovementioned categories. In his first question on the portion of Genesis 47:28 - 48:2252 Abar banel raises a difficulty concerning what is stated 'and Jacob lived in Egypt for seventeen years' [Gen 47:28] - in light of the fact that it has already been related that Jacob was a hundred and thirty years old at the time of his arrival in Egypt [above, verse 9], and that we are now told that he lived for a hundred and forty seven years [Gen 47:28], there is no need to mention that he lived in Egypt for seventeen years, which is self-evident. Abarbanel points out what seems to be a redundancy in the biblical text. The fact of Jacob having lived in Egypt for seventeen years is easily deduced by subtracting his age of arrival from the age in which he died in that same place. The specific mentioning of this fact thus appears to be superfluous and to run counter to the notion of the Torah's perfec tion. It is therefore the task of the commentator to show that it is not really so and that this sentence also comes to reveal an additional piece of information of which the reader would not have been aware other wise. This is Abarbanel's formal standpoint,53 and in this manner he usually solves this kind of 'difficulty.'54 Looking through the commen taries of some of the dominant literal exegetes of previous centuries (Rashi, Rashbam, Bekhor Shor, Ibn Ezra, Radaq, Nachmanides and Gersonides)55 though, we find no hint whatsoever that any of them were troubled in the slightest by the question raised by Abarbanel. The reason for this is perfectly obvious. The principal task of literal exegesis is to illuminate the unclear and explain the uncommon. What is clear, on the other hand, is in no need of illumination, and what is common in the Bible - even if odd from the point of view of contem 52 Abarbanel poses his own original division of Scripture into sections that are 'in accordance with the matter of the discourse and the demarcation of the stories' (Abar banel, Former Prophets, p. 13). 53 See the citation from his commentary on Exod 3:8 brought below. 54 In this particular case Abarbanel explains that since Jacob intended to see Joseph and then return to Canaan immediately, Scripture relates that Jacob stayed in order to stress that 'the counsel of God [in Gen 15:13, that the descendants of Abraham would become slaves in a foreign land] was carried out' (Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 752). 55 For the words of the commentators mentioned here and Rabbi Joseph ibn Kaspi we rely on Mikra'ot Gedolot 'ha-Keter,' ed. by Menahem Cohen, Ramat Gan 1992? 2007.</page><page sequence="20">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 321 porary conventions - is to be explained in terms of stylistic notions only. The sentence 'and Jacob lived in Egypt for seventeen years' is perfectly clear when standing alone, and the sort of 'superfluous' calculations that it comprises in its context is a common feature of biblical literature,56 and therefore it cannot serve as ground for a midrash-like extraction of meaning that is not explicitly contained in it. This principle is exem plified in the commentary of Abraham ibn Ezra (second recension) on the very same verse: 'And the days of Jacob, the years of his life, were seven years and forty and hundred years,' and concerning Abraham it is stated that 'the years of Abraham were... a hundred years and seventy years and five years' (Gen 25:7) - sometimes the greater number is mentioned before the lesser number, and sometimes the lesser number is mentioned before the greater number; there are no fixed rules concerning this. The purpose of Ibn Ezra's comments, as in numerous other instances, seems to be to counterfeit the methods of midrashic exegesis, which was wont to point out this and other kinds of discrepancies between different places in Scripture and use them as building blocks in order to create its exegetical edifice. To a consistent exegete of Scripture's plain meaning like Ibn Ezra it appeared as sheer absurdity to assume that anything at all could be learned from different ways of enumerating the ages of biblical personages. Hence he stresses that both ways are common in the Bible, and this is to him sufficient proof that nothing can be adduced from the difference between them, apart from a certain flexibility of biblical style in such cases. In the two following verses in the same chapter it is stated: 'And when the days drew near that Israel must die, he called his son Joseph and said to him: "If I have found favor in your eyes, put your hand under my thigh and promise to deal loyally and truly with me. Do not bury me in Egypt. I shall lie with my fathers, carry me therefore out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place.'" In his third question on the portion Abarbanel deals with an additional redundancy that he has found in these verses, this time in the words of Jacob cited by the narrator, and not in the narrative exposition itself: Since he [= Jacob] commanded Joseph concerning his burial first in the negative: 'do not bury me in Egypt,' and then afterwards also in the affir mative: 'carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burying place,' it turns out that the same command is being doubled and only the formulation has been altered!? 56 See Gen 5:3-31; Nirm 1:20-47, 31:4-5, 31-46 etc.</page><page sequence="21">322 Jair Haas JSQ 17 As already mentioned, in Abarbanel's view the purpose of semantic 'doublings' in the Torah is always to disclose an additional piece of information and it is inconceivable that the Torah would repeat itself for purely stylistic-aesthetic reasons. But when Abarbanel deals with non-Mosaic prophecy, his attitude is radically different. If the doubling phenomena occur in the speech of other prophets, Abarbanel defines its rhetorical character as 'emphasis,' and when occurring in biblical texts explicitly defined as 'poetry' - which according to Abarbanel were com posed by human authors while not being under the influence of prophe tic inspiration - he stresses its poetic character.57 Since according to Abarbanel all the prophesies, apart from those of Moses, were cast in the personal formulations of the prophets,58 and all the more so the poetic sections of the Bible, there can be no doubt as to the fact that Abarbanel knew that repetition of meanings, whether literal or through a change of words, is characteristic of both the way human beings speak and of the way human authors write. From here it follows that Abarba nel was troubled not by the fact that Jacob repeated his impassioned plea not to be buried in Egypt, which is perfectly understandable, but rather by the fact that the Torah found it necessary to cite both of Jacob's alternative formulations.59 But then again, examining the com 57 Haas, Repetition, pp. 245-253. 58 Abarbanel, Exodus, p. 280. 59 Kaiman Bland ("Issues in sixteenth century Jewish exegesis," in: David Steinmetz [ed.], The Bible in the Sixteenth Century, London and Durham 1990, pp. 56-57 [hence forth: Bland, Issues]) saw things differently when he wrote, concerning the similar ex egetical attitude of Isaac Qaro, that 'Karo's procedure for resolving these breaches in style is premised on the view that God and Jacob [italics added] can be presumed to subscribe to the canons of correct style, but they deliberately and purposefully depart from them in order to communicate special messages.' Shimon Shalem ("The exegetical method of R. Yosef Taitazak and his circle: its nature and its form of inquiry," Sefunot 11 [1971-1977], p. 124 [Hebrew; henceforth: Shalem, Taitazak]) seems to present an understanding closer to our own when he ascribes Taitazak's habit of extracting mean ing from every word of Scripture, including the speech of the Biblical heroes, to his understanding of 'the essence of the text, its authors, their education, their ways of thinking and their ways of expression.' But, on the other hand, before then (p. 123) he wrote that 'logic and reason guide the heroes in their actions and direct them in their reactions. All their deeds are based on perfectly rational considerations, and the pos sibility of random responses is therefore inconceivable.' This understanding of the com mentators' exegetical consciousness is untenable. Once it is understood that they, due to their well-developed literary accumen, drew a clear distinction between the actual events and their literary presentation, it is unjustified to assume that they thought of the Biblical heroes as people whose actions were all guided by pure logic and whose utterances were formulated with perfect foreknowledge of the fact that they sometime in the future would constitute a part of the divine teaching. This is contrary to the realistic orientation that characterised the exegesis of men like Abarbanel and Qaro.</page><page sequence="22">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 323 mentaries of the seven other exegetes mentioned in the first example, we find no references to this problem. An ever recurring phenomenon like the doubling principle simply did not bother the great literal commen tators of the Middle Ages,60 for the reasons already explicated above. Most of them were troubled by what seems to be a much more urgent question from the point of view of Scripture's plain meaning - the cor rect understanding of the phrase shall lie with my fathers.' Is this a metaphorical expression for death as in numerous other places,61 or is it to be understood literally as part of Jacob's request to be buried in the actual vicinity of Abraham and Isaac? Rashi favored the former option, but Ibn Ezra shows that in this particular instance the other option has to be reckoned with also: " shall lie with my fathers" - this is a meta phor for death. But one could also interpret: do not bury me in Egypt, so that I may [literally] lie with my fathers; and how is this to be carried out? - by carrying me out of Egypt and burying me in their grave.' The different exegetical concerns of Ibn Ezra and Abarbanel stand out clearly by comparing this commentary with Abarbanel's solution to the problem that he himself raised: The word na [a word that usually accompanies entreaties or exhortations but has no translatable meaning in and of itself] in this place takes on the meaning of "now;"62 [Jacob] said: [...] I know that at the time of the re demption the people of Israel will carry your remains with them, but I do not wish to be buried now in Egypt so that they might carry my remains with them at that time [...] rather, as soon as I lie down with my fathers - this is a metaphor for death - you shall carry me out of Egypt and bury me in their burial place.' Even though the two commentators are dealing with different questions, the words of each one of them also contain a solution to the question dealt with by his colleague. Thus what is identified by Abarbanel as a possible doubling of Jacob's plea is explained by Ibn Ezra as a request and its practical execution; and the phrase shall lie down with my fathers' is expounded by Abarbanel according to one of the solutions 60 Cf. Ibn Ezra's harsh words in his commentary on Exod 19:3 (first recension) against commentators who insisted in differentiating between 'thus shall you speak to the house of Jacob' and 'thus shall you tell the children of Israel:' 'As if they hadn't noticed that it is customary for the prophets to speak the same thing twice, the purpose being to impress the words upon the heart [of the listener] by way of a poetic mode of expression.' 61 Deut 31:16; lKgs 1:21, 2: 10, 11:21, 43, 14:20 etc. 62 According to Ibn Ezra 'in the whole of Scripture the word na carries the meaning of "now"' (commentary on Exod 12:9, first recension). This view was reiterated by Radaq in his biblical dictionary (Sefer ha-Shorashim, ed. by H. Biesenthal and F. Leb recht, Berolini 1847, entry na, p. 204).</page><page sequence="23">324 Jair Haas JSQ 17 proposed by Ibn Ezra. But while there is no indication that Jacob's doubled request actually constitutes an exegetical difficulty in the eyes of Ibn Ezra, Abarbanel discloses ample awareness of the fact that the words shall lie with my fathers' are in need of explanation. Never theless, Abarbanel, who undoubtedly knew the commentary of Ibn Ezra, ignores the full implications of the problem and chooses the alter native that fits into his own scheme - to explain any seeming redun dancy as a bearer of additional meanings and intentions, that is, to show that it really is not redundant. This commentary thus constitutes an interesting piece of evidence to preferences in Abarbanel's exegetical concerns: explaining away what seem to be flaws in the divine text, and thus showing the text's absolute perfection, appeared to him a more urgent task than offering a systematic, strictly scientific peshat-commm tary on the Bible. As shown above, Abarbanel makes an explicit connection between his conviction in the absolute perfection of the Torah and the general need to explain away any phenomenon that seems to contradict this dogmatic belief of his. But also when it comes to specific expressions of Abarba nel's exegetical outlook he discloses, in some cases, the dogmatic foun dation of his exceptional views. Thus with regard to the already attested ambition of explaining every doubling of meaning in the Torah as a bearer of additional information, he writes that 'there can be no doubt as to the fact that any semantic doubling [...] in the divine words serves an indispensable purpose,'63 that is, it is inconceivable that the Torah, in lieu of its divine perfection, should repeat itself for purely aesthetic rea sons. In the omitted passage of the citation above, which actually constitu tes only one single word: veshinui (= and change), Abarbanel hints at the dogmatic foundation of his attitude to yet another characteristic phe nomenon of biblical style: nuance, or asymmetry. By power of his ex treme sensitivity to details64 Abarbanel often identified instances of 63 Abarbanel, Exodus, p. 29. 64 A fairly amusing example of this is to be found in his commentary on Micah 7:5 6 (Isaac Abarbanel, Commentary on Minor Prophets, Tel Aviv 1956, p. 150). The pro phet describes a generation in which dishonesty is the order of the day, and he therefore advices his listeners not to put their trust in anyone: 'Do not have faith in your fellow man, trust neither your beloved one, do not confide with your wife. For the son de spises his father, the daughter turns against her mother and the bride against her mother-in-law, a person's enemies are in his own household.' Abarbanel remarks, pos sibly with a twinkle in his eyes: '[The prophet describes] a generation so corrupt that a man ought not trust his own wife, and the wife should not trust her husband either, even if they are considered "one flesh" [...] the son also despises his father etc. But do not object that there is nothing unusual in a bride [also: daughter-in-law] turning</page><page sequence="24">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 325 asymmetry that were not mentioned or dealt with by his forerunners. For example, in the tenth question preceding the portion that begins with Genesis 2:4 he notes inconsistencies in the details mentioned in connection with each one of the four riverheads that flowed from the river that was in the Garden of Eden: You will notice that with regard to the Pishon, that was mentioned first, [Scripture] related which land was encompassed by it, as it is written: 'this is the one that encompasses the whole land of Havilah' [Gen 2:11], and the things that existed there, as it is written: 'where gold is to be found' [ibid.]. But concerning the second river, that is: the Gihon, and the third river, the Hidekel, it only related the land that was encompassed, as it is written: 'this is the one that encompasses the whole land of Kush' [ibid., 13], 'this is the one that runs towards the land of Assyria' [ibid., 14], but it did not mention the things to be found there. And concerning the fourth river it mentioned neither the land that it encompassed nor the things to be found there, it only stated that 'the fourth river is the Perat' [ibid.]. Abarbanel's answer to the first problem, why gold was mentioned only with regard to the first river, reflects the inherent logic of his approach, according to which nothing in Scripture is accidental, not even the ab sence of certain information. The last three rivers, Abarbanel argues, did not contain gold or precious stones, and this is why this fact was men tioned only concerning the first one. A second answer given, which seems to be a supplement to the first one and not a complete answer in and of itself, is that since the last three rivers were better known than the first one - the Gihon flowed just outside of Jerusalem (see lKgs 1:37), the Hidekel is mentioned in the book of Daniel (10:4), and the Perat constituted the border between the land of Israel and Babylon - and nothing of value were found in them anyway, Scripture saw no reason to mention this. The second problem that Abarbanel raised, why the land encompassed by the rivers was mentioned only in the first three cases, is not answered at all. Whatever may be the reasons for Abarbanel's silence, his conclusion that 'all this solves the tenth ques tion' is partly unjustified. But it would be equally unjustified to think that Abarbanel's failure to solve a problem that he himself posed could stem from mere forgetfulness. Abarbanel's memory was, by all means, against her mother-in-law, seeing that this has been the custom [literally: the way of the world] throughout the generations. The situation to which the prophet is referring in this reproof is when the bride is standing under the canopy, when she is still fond of her mother-in-law and tries to find favour in her eyes [literally: kissing her hands] as if she was her daughter truly.' This interpretation, and many others, shows Abarbanel's de veloped understanding of human nature as well as his sensitivity to even the smallest of details in the text with which he is dealing.</page><page sequence="25">326 Jair Haas JSQ 17 absolutely phenomenal65 and his attentiveness to details, as already men tioned, no less so. In my opinion - and I say this even at the risk of being offensive - Abarbanel simply ignored the question,66 either because he did not have an answer, or because the solution he had in mind when writing down the difficulty no longer satisfied him when the time to answer it arrived. To be sure, Abarbanel entertained no doubt that this problem also had its proper solution, but when faced with the di lemma whether to admit to his incapacity to solve a certain difficulty or to ignore the matter altogether, Abarbanel, not surprisingly, chose the latter option.67 Another of Abarbanel's principal aims throughout his biblical com mentaries is to show the consistent logical as well as chronological ar 65 Rabinowitz (Exegete, p. 79) states 'that a claim could be made out for Abravanel as one of the most learned men of his time, both in Hebrew and in secular knowledge.' 66 An additional, almost clear-cut case of ignoring occurs in the case of the laws concerning the criteria for fish that are permitted to be eaten in Deut 14:9-10. Abar banel was of the opinion that the book of Deuteronomy - being formulated in the first person, and not in the third person as the rest of the books - was originally spoken by Moses at his own initiative, and only subsequently was it included, by power of divine sanction, in the Torah. This being the case, it is inconceivable that the deuteronomic law code in chapters 12-26 could contain even one single law not already hinted at in the first four books (Abarbanel, Deuteronomy, p. 8). But, on the other hand, if Moses saw fit to reiterate many of the already well-known ordinances, it must have been in order to elaborate on them (ibid., pp. 9-10), since it is equally inconceivable that the Almighty should have sanctioned the inclusion of superfluous repetitions into his divi nely perfect Torah. Thus, due to Abarbanel's understanding of the book's content being tied to his conception of the Torah's absolute perfection, this view also is not being left to the theoretical discussion in his introduction to the book alone, but is translated into a full-fledged exegetical program in Abarbanel's commentary on the deuteronomic lawcode. Law after law, statute after statute is expounded as elaborations on laws and statutes already mentioned in the former books. Needless to say some of the explanations are rather far-fetched (see, for example, how, in Abarbanel's opinion, the commandment of the annulment of loans in the sabbatical year [Deut 15:1-3] is already hinted at in Lev 25:2 [Abarbanel, Deuteronomy, p. 231]), but in the case of the permitted fish it does not work at all. The version in Lev 11:9-12 is longer and more elaborate than the parallel one in Deut 14:9-10, which does not disclose any informa tion that has not been disclosed already, in Leviticus. How does Abarbanel cope with such an insolvable difficulty within the framework of his own understanding of the book's nature? Well, he doesn't! He simply ignores the whole issue. 67 Cf. Segal, Commentator, p. 280: 'In Abarbanel there are no "maybe's" or "if s." His interpretations bear no sign of doubts or hesitations. He is convinced about the truth of his words, and all the more so about his own capability of settling all difficul ties and solving all problems that may arise with regard to Scripture's meaning. Many difficulties that his predecessors were unable to solve, or which they settled in an un convincing manner, he settles easily, sometimes by way of his sound insight and critical sensibilities, and sometimes - and this goes for the majority of cases - by way of far fetched, implausible casuistry that in his eyes constitutes Scripture's simple meaning' [italics added].</page><page sequence="26">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 327 rangement of Scripture's literary units. With regard to his conviction in the perfectly logical arrangement of the laws in the Torah he explicitly states that this follows from the divine nature of the book: Tt is self evident that the content of the Torah follows a certain order, for it is unfitting to attribute any flaw or blemish to the teachings of the Blessed one, the judge of the entire world, and to think that they could be less ordered than the books of even the smallest of scholars.'68 Subsequently Abarbanel brings an additional argument why this must be so: 'Since the extraordinary chronological order of the Torah has been clarified in the most perfect of ways with regard to the stories I have expounded on so far, it is proper to assume that also the order of the divine laws and ordinations was not fixed by chance, and that they were not mentioned in an arbitrary way.'69 In light of the equation-in-principle entailed in this additional proof between the two types of order - the chronological order of the narrative portions of the Torah, and the logical order of literary units to which chronology does not apply, that is to say: the laws - it is evident that the same dogmatic outlook is responsible also for Abarbanel's somewhat surprising standpoint that the stories in the Torah always follow a consistent chronological arrangement.70 This con clusion is certainly borne out by the fact that in order to demonstrate the truth of his formal position in every single particular case Abarbanel occasionally offers some rather far-fetched interpretations, even if some 68 Abarbanel, Exodus, p. 337. 69 Abarbanel's inference of specific messages on the sole basis of different laws being brought in immediate proximity constitutes a significant retreat from long estab lished rules of peshat. Already Ibn Ezra established the rule that whenever possible one should search for the common denominator of the laws in a given literary unit, but whatever is learned from the proximity of two adjacent laws is nothing but 'midrashic imagination' (or: 'likened to derasK mBTD; see: Isaac B. Gottlieb, "Adjacent chapters in Ibn Ezra," Iyunei Mikra u-Farshanut 5 (2000), pp. 5-19 [Hebrew]). Abarba nel did not pay heed to these principles when he interpreted Deut 16:21-22 ('Do not plant for yourself an Asherah or any other tree near the altar that you will make yourself for God your Lord. Do not erect a sacred pillar, since this is something that God your Lord hates' [translation follows: Kaplan, The The Five Books of Moses, a new translation with notes and introduction by Aryeh Kaplan, New York and Jerusa lem 1985]) allegorically as relating to the establishment of a fair system of justice in accordance with the subject dealt with in the preceding verses (see also his commentary on Exod 21:15-17, where he seems to rely on an interpretation brought by Ibn Ezra [long recension] in the name of the 'Gaon' [Rav Sa'adya]). 70 Already the Talmud observed that 'the Torah does not always follow a consistent chronological order' (literally: 'there is no earlier and later in the Torah;' Pesahim 6, II). This view was adopted by most medieval commentators, and as far as I know Abarbanel was the first outrightly to reject it. More on this subject is to be found below (see also the short discussion in: Yaakov Elman, '"It is no empty thing:' Nahmanides and the search for omnisignificance," Torah u-Madda Journal 4 (1993), pp. 21-22).</page><page sequence="27">328 Jair Haas JSQ 17 times (poorly) disguised as strictly philological exegesis. One such inter pretation is his explanation of the location of the verse 4and Man (Adam) called his wife Hava, because she was the mother of all living (Hay)' (Gen 3:20). Standing by itself the verse is perfectly clear: Adam calls his wife by a name that is reminiscent of a word that describes one of her main characteristics. This type of name-calling is widespread in the Bible, and from his initial question it is clear that Abarbanel was very well aware that this is the simple and obvious understanding of the verse.71 But he could not accept it as the verse's true intention, his a priori convictions as regards the perfect chronological order of the Torah did not allow for that. The verse in question is stuck in between the curses that God made come upon the man, the woman and the snake (Gen 3:14-19) and the description of God preparing clothes for the man and the woman (ibid. 21) - both events that followed directly from the sin of eating from the Tree of Knowledge. But the fact of the woman being the mother of all living has no obvious connection to the eating of the forbidden fruit, and if the verse is interpreted in the abovementioned way one would at least have to suspect that its location does not reflect the actual place of this incident in the chronological order of events. This is why Abarbanel deemed it necessary to offer an alternative inter pretation, one that explains the name-calling as an integral part of the incidents that followed in the wake of the sin: When the man (Adam) saw all the evil things that happened to him due to the words and arguments of the woman, he regretted having called her isha [- woman], because it would give the [false] impression that she is equal to him, who is a man (ish), and he is equal to her. Therefore, after he was cursed due to a fault of hers, he named her Hava ( 1 ), that is: chatterbox, like the meaning of 'will utter knowledge' ( 5 1 ; Ps 19:3) and 'bear with me a little and I will tell you' ( 1 1 T?yt ; Job 36:2). And because she by nature desired to emulate the beasts, as she did when she desired to eat from the tree like the snake, in this sense she should be considered 'the mother of all living,' caring for the beasts as if they were her own offspring.72 This interpretation is as unconvincing as it is regrettable, that one of Judaism's great teachers could hold such low views on women.73 The 71 These are his words there: 'Concerning what is stated "and Man named his wife Hava, because she was the mother of all living [Hay]" [...] since she is the mother of all living she ought to be named Haya, and not Hava' (Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 148 [38th question]). 72 Ibid., p. 110. 73 Commenting on the words 'and God created Man in His image, in the image of God He created him, male and female he created them' (Gen 1:27), Abarbanel airs the view that only Man was created in the image of God, thus constituting the pinnacle and final purpose of Creation, while Woman was made with the exclusive purpose of</page><page sequence="28">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 329 word ki (= because), that hints at the causal relation between the naming of the woman and the fact of her being the mother of all living, does not allow for a splitting of the verse into two separate utterances, as Abar banel would have it. The only way to explain this far-fetched interpreta tion is by pointing to Abarbanel's aspirations to demonstrate the excep tional chronological order of Scripture coming down even to the smal lest of literary units. Another major hermeneutic issue regarding which Abarbanel hints at the connection between his formal standpoint and his view of the Torah as possessing divine perfection is the use of allegory. Living in a Chris tian society, and probably also partaking in religious disputes with Christians,74 Abarbanel advocated utmost caution in the use of allegory, lest it might be understood as an admission of the Christian claim that the laws of the Torah are to be understood figuratively and not actually observed. Thus he attacks Maimonides for interpreting the second crea tion story in an allegorical manner,75 stressing the extreme dangers in herent in the latter's approach. What will the Rabbi and Guide answer when having to bring account before the Master of the World, who allowed him to [...] turn the verses into figures and nullify their plain meaning? This is bound to bring heresy in its wake, since the plague will spread and cause allegorisation of the laws of the Torah, its ordinances and enactments. If it is allowed in parts [of the Torah], it will [eventually] be allowed in all of it.76 Despite his fears that a figurative understanding of the Pentateuchal narrative might eventually lead to allegorisation of the laws and laxity in their practical observance, Abarbanel himself engaged in large-scale allegorisation of many laws, the practical applicability of which had ex pired with the destruction of the temple. The rationale for this is ex plained in the introduction to Abarbanel's commentary on the building of the tabernacle (Exod 35^0): securing the continuity of the species. Also stressing explicitly that humankind's divi sion into males and females is a partaking of the traits of the rest of the animal king dom (Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 120), Abarbanel, again, is more than hinting that in his view women are more or less on the level of beasts. 74 In his commentary on Deut 24 -4 Abarbanel mentions the debate between Jew ish and Christian scholars whether the Torah permits divorce, and testifies that discussed this subject with some of their scholars, and I refuted their arguments.' 75 See: Guide for the Perplexed, part II, chap. 30. For a fuller analysis of Abarba nel's attitude toward Maimonidean allegorising, see: Eric Lawee, "'The good we accept and the bad we do not:' Aspects of Isaac Abarbanel's stance toward Maimonides," Be'ero t Yitzhak: Studies in Memory of Isadore Twer sky, Cambridge, Massachusetts, London 2005, pp. 146-153. 76 Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 150.</page><page sequence="29">330 Jair Haas JSQ 17 It is inconceivable that today, in our exile, we derive no utility from know ing all that is told about the tabernacle and its vessels and the order of its erection and its journeys, the sacrifices, the matters of the nobles, the vest ments of the priest, and the rest of the things that were in those generations [...] the answer to this is that what is written in the Torah, its main purpose is to constitute a book of the highest wisdom and of divine teachings, in order that men of faith may delve into it and bring their souls to perfection through the acquisition of those truths [...] thus whatever is known to us today about the tabernacle and its vessels with their figurative meanings is as useful to us today at it was at the time of their practical application.77 In Abarbanel's view the Torah's divine perfection entails its eternal re levance, that is to say, its perfection not only in space but also in time.78 Since this outlook is axiomatic, Abarbanel does not doubt the fact that laws, the applicability of which have long expired, should be understood allegorically - as disclosing eternal, divine truths - and this is asserted without need for any inherent justification. True, Abarbanel's approach differs from the approach of the Christians and Maimonides insofar as the allegory is not thought of as in any way nullifying or downgrading Scripture's literal meaning. But the claim that the Torah is first and foremost a theoretical study book and not a practical guide to life - and therefore at least some parts of it must be interpreted allegorically - nevertheless seems overly daring for a Jew writing in Christian Europe. It comes dangerously close to views held by the Church and used by it in polemical contexts against the Jews and their, in Christian eyes, stub born adherence to Scripture's literal meaning. From a methodological point of view Abarbanel removes himself exceedingly far from the foun dations of peshat exegesis, in that his rationale for applying the figura tive approach is mystical rather than literary.79 In claiming that the 77 Abarbanel, Exodus, pp. 457-458. 78 For the specific reasons why, according to Abarbanel, the Torah's perfection en tails its unchangeability in time, see the eleventh chapter of Rosh Amana (Isaac Abar banel, Rosh Amana, ed. by Menahem Kellner, Ramat Gan 1993, pp. 85-95). Abarba nel's 'defense' of the Torah's laws might have been spurred by Renaissance scholars' interest in the history of laws and the awareness of their validity being limited in time and place, beginning with Petrarch (1304 - 1374; see: Peter Burke, The Renaissance Sense of the Past, London 1969, pp. 32-38). In his commentary on the weekly portion of Mishpatim (Exod 21-23:19), Abarbanel goes out of his way in order to demonstrate the absolute superiority of the Torah's laws to those of 'the nations' (see: Yair Hass [= Jair Haas], "Between Law and Law," Bar-Ilan University's Parashat Hashavua Study Center, Parashat Mishpatim 5765 (http://www.biu.ac.il/JH/Parasha/eng/mishpat/ has.html). 79 While Maimonides' approach to allegory is entirely literary (see: Mordechai Co hen, Three Approaches to Biblical Metaphor, Leiden and Boston 2003, pp. 98-136 [hen ceforth: Cohen, Approaches]).</page><page sequence="30">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 331 Torah's literary essence is such that even the most far-reaching historical circumstances do not, and indeed cannot, impair its absolute relevance even the slightest, Abarbanel posits his own personal adaptation of the kabbalistic maxim, that 'God looked into the Torah before he created the world.'80 The issues analysed above, all relating to Abarbanel's attitude to wards literary aspects of the Torah, clearly demonstrate that in Abarba nel's exegesis the development of a consistent methodology gives way to his main exegetical-apologetical aim of proving the Torah's divine per fection. But the belief in the Torah's perfection is also reflected in the many cases where Abarbanel endeavors to show the infallibility of the Torah's content from any thinkable perspective, historic, scientific, phi losophic, etc. Several statements testify to Abarbanel's conviction in the perfect truth of all facts and views mentioned or hinted at in the Torah. For example: 'The purpose of the divine Torah was undoubtedly to bring the chosen nation to its true perfection as concerns pure and refined char acter-traits and true beliefs and opinions.'81 Other commentators would no doubt agree in principle with this statement, but they would hardly approve of the ways in which Abarbanel distorted Scripture's plain meaning in order to prove his point. In his commentary on the words 'in the waters below the land' (Exod 20:4) Abarbanel writes: 'What is meant is not that the waters were below the land, [which is impossible] since they are above it in the hierarchy of the elements [as taught by Aristotle] [...] it is as if he said: the fish that are being generated on the land that is below the waters and serves as their ground [= the bottom of the sea].' Abarbanel does not bring any textual support for his understanding of the phrase 'the waters below the land' as meaning 'the land below the waters.' It might be that he is applying Ibn Janach's controversial principle of 'reversal' (lisn),82 which Ibn Ezra so severely criticised for being based on the assumption that Scripture's style is less than perfectly understandable (commentary on Ps 104:6 [first recension] and more). But Abarbanel, like Ibn Ezra before him, was no admirer of Ibn Janach's approach - to him the Torah's clarity was but an addi tional aspect of its divine perfection83 - and he would most probably 80 Zohar, Trumah 161, I. 81 Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 154. 82 R.

The atomistic nature of AbarbaneVs exegesis No less symptomatic of Abarbanel's disregard for methodological con sistency than the far-fetched interpretations exemplified above, are the contradictions that can be traced between different places in his exege tical corpus. Contradictions are found in the writings of other commen tators also, but in Abarbanel's corpus their frequency as well as their prominence nevertheless stand out. For example, when Abarbanel offers an interpretation that downright contradicts what he wrote only a few pages before - and considering the rapid pace in which Abarbanel wrote down his commentaries84 it is more than probable that it was all written in the very same day, and certainly in no more than two consecutive days - the matter calls for something more substantial than trivial ex planations such as forgetfulness, change of mind, or even a different audience. Especially conspicuous is the case of the two interpretations that he offers on the words 'God is a man of war' (Exod 15:3). In his lengthy introduction to the commentary on the Song of the Sea (Exod 15:1-18), Abarbanel analyzes the features the presence of which in a literary work justifies its characterisation as poetry - melody, meter and rhyme, and figurative speech. The third feature is characterised as poetry par excellence (DXya "PtP).85 Among other examples of this fea 84 For example, his commentaries on Joshua, Judges, and Samuel were completed between the fall of 1483 and the spring of 1484 (see: Abarbanel, Former Prophets, pp.92, 161,421). 85 Abarbanel, Exodus, p. 212. This is an interesting departure from the strict criteria of poetry in Spain of the Golden Age, according to which a literary creation could be deemed poetic only if it was written in meter and rhyme. This departure stems at least partly from the absence of clear meter and rhyme in biblical poetry (see: James L. Kugel, "Some medieval and Renaissance Hebrew writings on the poetry of the Bible," in: Isadore Twersky (ed.), Studies in Medieval Jewish history and Literature, Cambridge, Massachusetts and London 1979, pp. 66-77) The threefold division of Abarbanel ap pears already in the commentary of Moses ibn Tibbon (mid-thirteenth century) on the Song of Songs (see: ibid., p. 80, nn. 48, 54), but seems to be based on the misreading of a certain passage in Averroes' commentary on Aristotle's Poetics. Averroes does say that 'with respect to poetical statements, imitation and representation come about by means of three things: harmonious tune, rhythm, and comparison itself,' but he then continues to explain that 'each of these may occur separately from the others - like tune in flute-playing; rhythm in dance; and representation in utterances' [that is, not all of them necessarily pertain to poetry, and the words 'with respect to poetic statements' were only meant to introduce the subject matter of the discussion to follow], and he</page><page sequence="32">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 333 ture Abarbanel brings our verse: '[The words] "God is a man of war" are a figurative expression, because "God is no man" (Num 23:19) and he does not wage wars.' But only some three pages later, even after having ascertained, in the introduction, that the song is in essence a humanly authored, and not a prophetic, work - Moses wrote it at his own initiative, and it was only incorporated in the Torah due to God's subsequent approval - Abarbanel nevertheless eschews the possibility that the words 'man of war' could be applied to God, even figuratively: Concerning what is written 'God is a man of war,' Onkelos translated it into 'God is a possessor of victories in battle,' and all the commentators86 followed this understanding. But since in my eyes it is improper to charac terise the Blessed One as 'a man,' it seems to me that the verse should be interpreted in one of the two following ways: according to the first way the words were meant as a [rhetorical] question: Is God really a man of war? Surely he is no man to wage war with another man. On the contrary, 'God is his name' (ibid.), good and beneficial and compassionate, but not a man of war. And all the evil that came upon the Egyptians when they drowned in the sea came about through their own actions [...] And the second way: because Pharaoh said in Egypt: 'who is this God that I must obey him ... I do not know this God' (Exod 5:2), Moses answered him here with scorn: 'God, O man of war, God is his name,' 'man of war' being an epithet for Pharaoh. As if [Moses] rebutted: you are a man of war who delights in evil, which is why you chase after the people of Israel to wage war against them. But God, whom you did not know, God is his name; you will now come to know him through his [mighty] actions. What could be the cause for this surprising reversal of attitude? Why this urgent need to explain away an obvious metaphor by way of two some what forced alternative solutions? The most obvious explanation is that Abarbanel, when faced with the responsibility of expounding the song to his contemporaries, became seized by a sudden, most probably justified, anxiety as to the capability of his potential audience to grasp the full implications of his highly sophisticated and theoretical treatment of the nature of poetry in general and the Song of the Sea in particular, includ concludes that 'there is no melody in the poems of the Arabs' and Only that which brings these two things together [= meter and representation] should truly be called a poem' (Averroes' Middle Commentary on Aristotle's Poetics, trans, with introduction and notes by Charles Butterworth, Princeton 1986, pp. 62-65). If it is true, as we as sume, that Abarbanel's view is based on Ibn Tibbon's (or somebody else's) misreading of Averroes, then it may be surmised that Abarbanel had not read the Latin translation of Averroes' commentary by Hermannus Alemannus (1256), even though this transla tion was printed (for the first time) in Venice 1481, and must have been easily available to Abarbanel after his arrival in Italy in 1492. 86 Cf. the commentaries of Rashi, Ibn Ezra (both recensions) and Gersonides.</page><page sequence="33">334 Jair Haas JSQ 17 ing subtle distinctions between full-fledged prophecy and The Holy Spir it, or between divinely authored texts and texts that only received divine sanction after their de facto completion. In other words, Abarbanel feared lest someone might come to think, mistakenly, that the Torah attributes human traits to the Almighty, which would constitute a me taphysical falsehood and therefore an impairment of its divine perfec tion.87 It could also be that Abarbanel himself suddenly became aware of certain implications of his own words of which he had not been aware before, that is, even if the Song of the Sea was written by Moses, its inclusion in the Torah must have been conditioned by its being in accord with divine standards of writing.88 Also intriguing is the comparison between Abarbanel's interpreta tions of the prohibition against boiling a kid in its mother's milk in its three appearances in the Torah. In Exodus 23:19 the prohibition follows the commandments regarding the observance of the three pilgrim festi vals, and Abarbanel, in accordance with his conviction in the perfect logical order of the pentateuchal laws (see above), interprets the prohibi tion in this context. The explanation given seems to reflect the influence of Maimonides' historical approach to the sacrifices, which mostly did not hold its sway over Abarbanel's explanations of the commandments: because it was the custom of idol-worshippers in those days to eat kids 87 It is of course crucial to mention, in this context, that Abarbanel's understanding of the nature of allegory resembles the attitude of Radaq and, more importantly, that of his son Judah Abarbanel, according to which the allegorical image is more than a poetic ornament - it reveals certain traits of the topic to which it alludes (On Radaq, see: Cohen, Approaches, pp. 276-292; on Judah Abarbanel, see: Jo?o Jos? Miranda Vila-Ch?, Amor Intellectualis?: Leone Ebreo (Judah Abravanel) and the Intelligibility of Love, Ph. D. thesis, Massachussetts 1999, pp. 357-358 [henceforth: Vila-Ch?, Leone Ebreo]; on Isaac Abarbanel, see: Haas, Repetition, pp. 254-256). In such a view the use of the word 'man' in order to characterise the Godhead, even if only figuratively, is akin to heresy (anthropomorphism). 88 This hypothesis is contradicted by the fact that in his commentary on verse 2 Abar banel identifies the 'repetition of meaning in different words' (maw irisan pay *?SD) phenomenon and characterises it as 'poetic style' (" rofc?fc), that is, an aesthetic feature. As already mentioned, according to Abarbanel, this phenomenon occurs only in humanly authored texts, while in divinely authored texts every single word bears additional meaning. On the other hand, according to Abarbanel the entire book of Deuteronomy was spoken by Moses on his own initiative, and only afterwards was he commanded by God to write it all down (see above, n. 66). Hence, it seems reasonable to expect that Abarbanel in Moses' thirty-chapter long speech of admonishment would identify rhetorical features such as the doubling phenomenon, which he in several in stances defines as 'emphasis.' But this is not the case, and on the whole there is no differences between Abarbanel's attitude towards the literary style of this book and that of the other four books of Moses.</page><page sequence="34">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 335 boiled in milk at the time of their assemblies,89 the purpose being to appease their gods, the Torah forbade this at the time of the festivals in order to distance the people as much as possible from idol worship. At the same time Abarbanel was troubled by the fact that the Torah repeated the one and same prohibition several times. He therefore incor porated the talmudic view,90 that this hints at a tripartite prohibition imposed by the Torah against cooking, eating and benefiting from a stew composed of milk and meat, into the abovementioned scheme: 'so in order to distance them completely from idol worshippers the Blessed One forbade eating and deriving benefit and cooking.' Also in Exodus 34:26, the prohibition against milk and meat follows the commandments concerning the pilgrim festivals, and in his commentary Abarbanel sum marises the essentials of the approach first presented in the commentary on Exodus 23:19, though without mentioning the tripartite prohibition taught by the Talmud. In conclusion Abarbanel stresses that this inter pretation 'proves that all these commandments were mentioned in their proper order.'91 In Deuteronomy 14:21 the prohibition against boiling a kid in its mothers milk is brought in a completely different context, as the final prohibition in a long passage of dietary laws (Deut 14:3-21) listing animals, fish and fowl that are forbidden to eat. This fact, together with the fact that the passage opens with the terse warning 'do not eat any abomination,' does not allow for the historical approach adopted in the commentary on Exodus. Accordingly the admixture of milk and meat is seen here not as a means to distance people from the abomination of idol worship, but as an abomination in and of itself. Scripture mentions the prohibition against boiling a kid in its mother's milk in order to clarify that food might be forbidden not only due to its own inherently unclean nature,92 or because the way the animal died,93 but also by virtue of its composition: 'by virtue of their composition the kid and the milk are considered an abomination.'94 The final example of this paragraph reflects Abarbanel's position as a medieval scholar standing on the threshold of the Renaissance, who was therefore capable of oscillating between different views in keeping up 89 Abarbanel bases this claim on the fact that similar customs were observed in his own time among the shepherds of Spain and England (Abarbanel, Exodus, pp. 374 375). 90 Hullin 115, II. 91 Abarbanel, Exodus, p. 595. 92 Like the forbidden animals, fish and fowl mentioned in verses 7-10. 93 The prohibition against eating a nevelah, an animal that has died a natural death, appears in verse 21. 94 Abarbanel, Deuteronomy, p. 223.</page><page sequence="35">336 Jair Haas JSQ 17 with his a priori assumptions regarding the Torah's divine perfection. In his commentary on Genesis 1:31, 'and God saw all that he had created, and behold it was very good,' he deals with the problem of why Scrip ture does not characterise Man himself as being 'good.' This fact seems to be troubling Abarbanel from at least two different angles: (1) the demand for symmetry - 'good' is said about the creation of light (day 1), the separation of the sea from the dry land and the creation of herbs and fruits (day 3), the making of the luminaries (day 4), the creation of fish and fowl (day 5), the creation of the beasts (day 6) and of creation in general (ibid.), and concerning the absence of this characterisation about the making of the firmament (day 2) Abarbanel felt the need to offer a special explanation of why this is so;95 (2) the demand for theo logical soundness - Abarbanel considered Man the pinnacle of creation, and the fact that he, of all creatures, did not deserve to be called 'good' was in his eyes extremely vexing. In his answer, Abarbanel mentions the opinion of 'the commentators' that, in light of its obvious humanistic, nay almost existential, conception of Man, seems to reflect a contem porary view. This view, though, is refuted in favor of Abarbanel's own typically medieval conceptions: The commentators wrote that it is because the purpose of his [= Man's] existence is not fulfilled [literally: his goodness is not being complete] by his merely being existent like other creatures. Rather man's perfection is reached [only] through his actions and his deeds96 [...] But this answer is untenable in 95 Abarbanel (Genesis, p. 70) offers two explanations, one of them resembling the solution posed by Pico della Mirandola (Heptaplus, p. 168). 96 This view is to be found in the Torah commentary of Rabbi Abraham Saba (Zeror HaMor, Bnei Beraq 1990, p. 7), which was completed around the year 1500 and might have reached the hands of Abarbanel, who wrote his commentary on Gen esis in 1502 (Moshe Idei, "The source of the circle Images in Dialoghi d'Amore" Iyun 28, 2-3 [1978], p. 160 [Hebrew]) or 1505 (Lawee, Tradition, p. 55). Before that it was expressed by Joseph Albo in his Sefer ha-Iqqarim (discourse 3, chapter 2), on which Abarbanel relies heavily in many of his writings, and it was reiterated by Isaac Qaro, another Spanish expulsee, in his commentary, Toldot Yitzhaq (Constantinople 1518), testifying to its wide acceptance. But, examining the contexts in which the words of Albo and Saba were uttered, it is clear that these two scholars by no means negated Man's inherent worth, all the more so his inborn superiority over the animals. 'The commentators' mentioned by Abarbanel, whether Saba or Albo or somebody else, were apparently understood by him as indicating an extreme humanist position, as repre sented in the words of one of the great philosophers of the Italian Renaissance Gio vanni Pico della Mirandola (1463-1494): 'We have given to thee, Adam, no fixed seat, no form of thy very own [...] thou art confined by no bounds; and thou wilt fix limits of nature for thyself [...] Thou canst grow downward into the lower natures which are brutes. Thou canst again grow upward from thy soul's reason into the higher natures which are divine' (Pico della Mirandola, Oration on the Dignity of Man, trans, by Charles Glenn Wallis, New York and Indianapolis 1965, pp. 4-5).</page><page sequence="36">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 337 my eyes, because since God created Man in his likeness and his image in accord with the highest perfection, should this primary creation not have been called 'good'?! [...] It therefore seems to me that the words 'and God saw all that He had created, and behold it was very good' do not refer to Creation in general but to the creation of Man only [...] And behold, Man is very good, because his essence is inherently better and more perfect than the rest of existent creatures.97 This conception of Man's inherent worth, due to his superior position in the chain of being, is expressed in many other places in the writings of Abarbanel.98 It seems to reflect the true opinion of Abarbanel, which is why he is willing to offer a pretty far-fetched interpretation - that the words 'and God saw all that he had made, and behold it was very good' refer to the creation of Man exclusively - without bringing any textual proof for it.99 Nevertheless, when his main exegetical concern, to show the absolute perfection of the Torah, demands it, Abarbanel is willing to adopt opposing views also. In his commentary on the sixth day of crea tion, Abarbanel raises a difficulty regarding the logic of the division of the Creation days: 'why was a separate day not dedicated to the creation of Man [...], seeing that the [existential] level of Speakers is higher than the level of the rest of living creatures?'100 In his answer, which appears only ten pages earlier than the citation above, he advances a view close to the one refuted there: His [Man's] perfection is not inherent [literally: born with him]. [Rather] his superiority depends on his deeds: if he lives in accordance with his intellect, he is likened to the separate intelligences, but if he succumbs to his physical existence, he will be like an animal or a beast101 [...] Therefore, in order to spur him, He [- God] created him and the animals on the same 97 Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 124-125. 98 See: Isaac E. Barzilay, Between Reason and Faith - Anti-Rationalism in Italian Jewish Thought, 1250-1650, The Hague and Paris 1967, pp. 87-90 [henceforth: Barzi lay, Anti-Rationalism]. 99 This view was expressed a couple of years earlier by Yohanan Alemanno in The Song of the Ascents of Salomon (brought in: Avraham Melamed, "The place of Man in the order of being - 'the superiority of Man' in the Jewish thought of Spain and Italy in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance," Italiah 3, 1-2 (1982), p. 73 [Hebrew]), who bases it on an allegorical interpretation of the word 'all,' which he understands to refer to Man only, 'who is all and encompasses all of existence, upper as well as lower, in his perfection.' Abarbanel was extremely cautious not to interpret the creation story alle gorically, lest the 'plague' of allegory might spread to the normative sections of the Torah (see above) and lest the belief in creatio ex nihilo - in his eyes the cardinal principle of the Jewish faith (Rosh Amana, p. 56) - be undermined. 100 Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 109 (3rd question). 101 Note the striking similarity with the words of Pico della Mirandola in the Ora tion, above, n. 96.</page><page sequence="37">338 Jair Haas JSQ 17 day [...] so that he shouldn't think that they are inherently inferior to him.102 One should notice the purely Aristotelian, rather than the religious, tone of Abarbanel's initial question. It is more than peculiar that Abarbanel should be troubled by the fact that the division of the days of creation is at odds with Aristotle's understanding of Man's superiority, while in the Torah's and in Abarbanel's own conception this superiority is primarily by virtue of his being created in the divine image, which according to Abarbanel means that his soul is of the substance of the separate intel ligences, or that he, like God, contains within him all the levels of being.103 It seems as if already in the initial question Abarbanel conceals his true views, because the solution to the problem raised here is diame trically opposed to them. On the other hand, Abarbanel could not just ignore the difficulty. He was too deeply bothered by the fact that Man and Beast were created on the same day - and accordingly fearful lest this could be used as pretext to cast doubt on the Torah's absolute perfection - to leave this question unanswered. The result is a peculiarly formulated difficulty and a more than insincere solution, and all this for purely apologetic reasons.104 Methodological contradictions In the previous paragraph we demonstrated the atomistic nature of Abarbanel's exegesis. Abarbanel is, harsh as it may sound, more a pro blem solver than a searcher for truth, as least when it comes to the understanding of Scripture's true intentions. Abarbanel's quest for con textual exegesis does not, primarily, stem from his commitment to the principles of peshat - which, as we have seen, was far from being total - 102 Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 114. 103 Ibid., pp. 115-117. 104 The insincere nature of Abarbanel's words here is also borne out by the fact that 11 pages later, after having claimed that the characterisation 'very good' refers to Man only, Abarbanel changes his view regarding the Torah's description of the sixth crea tion day, showing that the difference between Man and Beast does not ultimately go unnotified: 'And because on this sixth day were created both the animal species accord ing to their [existential] levels, and Man according to his level, which is exceedingly higher, [the Torah] said: "It was evening, it was morning, the sixth day," thus attribut ing the creation of the animals to the evening and the creation of Man to the morning.' These words exclude the possibility of relating to the differences between the two com ments as a matter of emphasis only, and had Abarbanel thought of this interpretative possibility earlier, the first interpretation would most probably never have come into the world.</page><page sequence="38">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 339 but from his aim at solving any possible difficulty, real or imaginary, wherever it may present itself. The by-product of this sort of approach is, inevitably as it were, many far-fetched interpretations, inconsistencies and even contradictions. But these still do not constitute Abarbanel's gravest 'sins.' There are instances in which Abarbanel's exegesis reaches yet higher stages of methodological inconsistency, and that is when he offers interpretations that are contrary to hermeneutical principles that he himself has hinted at elsewhere, or, alternatively, when he, in order to justify a given interpretation, formulates a rule that does not reflect his true standpoint as brought into force in other places. To the second category belongs a case with which we have already dealt above, the case of the woman being named Hava in Genesis 3:20. In his introductory questions to the section, Abarbanel mentions several reasons why the understanding of the verse in accordance with what seems to be its straightforward meaning, is untenable. One of them re lates to the fact that the root of the word Hava is , while the root of the word 'living' (hay) is '^ : Since she was the mother of all living she should have been named , and not 1 , and even though [the letter] vav and [the letter] yod interchange, the question still remains why he didn't call her in accordance with her letters, but 1 through a change of letters?' These words, serving as justification for rejecting the derivation of 1 from Tl, implicitly entail a methodological state ment according to which letters do not interchange unless there is a specific reason for this. But is this Abarbanel's formal standpoint con cerning the interchangeability of letters? Abarbanel seldomly relates to this issue, but on two occasions he mentions the interchangeability of the letters samekh and shin and bases his interpretation on this principle without offering any further justifications.105 The 'methodological' state ment in his commentary on Genesis 3:20 is, therefore, not to be taken seriously, as reflecting his true standpoint. Rather it was put forth in order to justify only one single interpretation, the purpose of which was, as will be recalled, to prove the consistent chronological order of the Torah. A methodological principle belonging to the first of the categories mentioned above - the full implications of which pretty much sum up the main gist of this paper so far - is hinted at in Abarbanel's commen tary on Isaiah 8:3: God commanded him [- Isaiah] to name him [= his son] Maker Shalal Hash Baz [- the spoil speeds, the prey hastens], that is, any one of those two 105 Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 757; ibid., Numbers, p. 207.</page><page sequence="39">340 Jair Haas JSQ 17 names, M?her Shalal or Hash Baz, since their meaning is identical, like the meaning of 'Jacob' and 'Israel.'106 The words 'like the meaning of "Jacob" and "Israel"' hint at the fact that these two words constitute one the most common fixed word-pairs in the Bible, words that often occur together in the same sentence or verse, which means that they are no more than variant epithets for the same entity, and that no specific meaning can be deduced from such a change in formulation. So far Abarbanel's view is on par with the main stream medieval peshat-commentators, and in his commentaries on the Prophets he generally adheres to these principles.107 But in his commen tary on the Torah the approach changes radically, and almost every time the word-pair 'Jacob'/'Israel' appears, Abarbanel endeavors to attribute specific connotations to each of its constituents. Consider, for example, the commentary on Exodus 19:3. It cannot be excluded that Abarbanel's commentary on Isaiah 8:3 echoes Ibn Ezra's harsh criticism of the mid rashic approach to semantic doubling in his short commentary on Exo dus 19:3,108 but all the more so the abysmal difference between the two commentators comes into prominence: 'Thus you shall say to the house of Jacob' - these are the deceitful and sly109 people among them; 'and relate to the sons of Israel' - the good and honest of heart.110 Alternatively, the distinction relates to the masses and the leaders111 respectively.112 For Abarbanel it is a given that the use of different phrases in the two stitches of the verse must entail some kind of distinction. This is a sig nificant digression from then accepted principles of peshat of which Abarbanel did not lack awareness. It may be argued, of course, that Abarbanel never tried to conceal the fact - which I have observed in no other medieval commentator - that his approach to the literary style of the Torah was diff?rent from his approach to the style of the Prophets113 106 Abarbanel, Latter prophets, p. 71. 107 See commentaries on Is 43:1 (ibid., p. 205); Jer 46:27 (ibid., p. 415). 108 See above, n. 60. 109 Cf. Esau's cynical outburst: 'He is rightly named Jacob (Ya'akov), since he has already deceived (VaYa'akveni) me twice' (Gen 27:36). 110 Abarbanel seems to assume an etymological connection between Yisrael Cnnw) and Yashar ("W) - honest, upright. 111 Now Yisrael is linked to Sarim (DntP) - princes. 112 Abarbanel, Exodus, p. 285. For additional examples, see commentary on Gen 49:24 (Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 773-774); Num 24:17 (Abarbanel, Numbers, pp. 209 210). 113 Cf. Mordechai Cohen, "The best of poetry ...': Literary approaches to the Bible in the Spanish peshat tradition," Tor ah u-M adda Journal 6 (1995-1996), p. 37: 'To re</page><page sequence="40">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 341 (though I know of no place where he admits to this explicitly). This might be true, but its implications are wide-ranging and point to another, much graver, contradiction, namely that even if Abarbanel, in his commentary on the Torah, expresses his commitment to peshat time and time again, this has to be taken with more than a grain of salt. True, Abarbanel was deeply influenced by the peshat-movQmtni and had thoroughly interna lised its ideals. But his deepest commitment, in his Torah-commentary, was to show the divine perfection of the Torah, and in order to achieve this he was willing to pay an enormous price in terms of exegetical prob ability and methodological consistency. Towards an understanding of Abarbanel's exegetical frame of mind One need not exaggerate the extent of previous commentators' commit ment to peshat - few, if any, were as consistent as Ibn Ezra in this regard - in order to understand that Abarbanel was far from realising the ideal of consistent, scientific exegesis that he himself glorified on many an occasion. In the third paragraph of this study we analysed possible spurs, internal as well as external, to Abarbanel's occupation with the Torah's absolute perfection. But while these constitute the historical background of his main exegetical concern, they by no means explain the ways in which this concern was brought into actuality. These ways are still a puzzle, insofar as they seem far removed from the ideals of peshat. The first step towards a better (I deliberately refrain from using the word 'full') understanding of Abarbanel's exegetical frame of mind is, I believe, to stress the fact that his specific conceptions regarding the Tor ah's perfection concur with what, in his day, was considered to consti tute the highest scientific and especially literary ideals, ideals that, self evidently, could not be conceived not to have reached their highest ex pression in Holy Writ. This will now be demonstrated with regard to three of the principal expressions of Abarbanel's exegesis as demon strated above: the search for meaning in every single word or phrasing, concile the conflicting literary and "omnisignificant" approaches, a compromise can be considered [...] In the Prophets and Writings [...] some words can be viewed merely as literary ornamentation, whereas the Torah [...] must be treated as an omnisignificant code that requires interpretation of every minute detail [...] Yet, this compromise posi tion does not actually appear among the exegetes we have seen in the debate between the literary and anti-literary approaches.'</page><page sequence="41">342 Jair Haas JSQ 17 the search for a consistent chronology, and the use of allegory to prove the eternal relevance of the Torah. 1. The omnisignificance of every word or formulation: Avraham Gross has written about the exegesis of Abarbanel's Lisbon mentor, the great Rabbi Joseph Hayyun, who in his adherence to peshat was not a little more consistent than his famous disciple. Nevertheless, clear traces of the emerging fifteenth century exegetical concerns as described above can be found in Hayyun's writings. Gross writes that 'if there are any aspects of derash in the exegesis of Hayyun [...] they should be ascribed to his insistence on extracting specific meaning from every word and phrase.'114 The theological vision behind this approach is revealed by Hayyun himself when he states, concerning the book of Psalms, that prophecy115 'contains neither lies and falsehood, nor void and superflu ous things.'116 Hence, also Hayyun had a vision of the word of God as perfect in all its aspects, substantial ones as well as formal ones, and this vision has a clear and concrete expression in his commentaries. But, no less important for our understanding of Abarbanel, this search for meaning in every detail of the text has been shown to reflect contemporaneous opinions on logic and language and the connection between them. Gross attributes Hayyun's approach to the influence of his teacher, R. Isaac Qanpanton, who in his short treatise Darkei ha Talmud developed a method of Talmud-study that was based on careful analysis of the text down to the smallest of details. In several places Qanpanton stresses that this is the method to be adopted also when studying the Scriptures, and from here Gross117 infers the influence of Qanpanton on Hayyun. But it seems unrealistic to assume that a few 114 Rabbi Joseph ben Abraham Hayyun: Leader of the Lisbon Jewish Community and his Literary Work, Ramat Gan 1993, p. 69 [Hebrew; henceforth: Gross, Hayyun}. 115 Whether the Book of Psalms was to be considered full-fledged prophecy was a great source of debate among medieval commentators (see, for example, the different approaches analysed in: Uriel Simon, Four Approaches to the Book of Psalms, Ramat Gan 1982 [Hebrew]). In Abarbanel's opinion, King David authored his songs by the aid of The Holy Spirit, an inferior kind of divine inspiration that differs from prophecy in that it reinforces, and actually works through, man's regular intellectual, cognitive and creative powers, instead of putting them out of function (see: Haas, Repetition, pp. 249-252). From the formulation of Hayyun it would seem that he did consider the book prophecy. But, on the other hand, one cannot exclude the possibility that in this case he was not meticulous in his use of terminology, since it is probable to assume that in his opinion all biblical books excel in their truthfulness, regardless of their exact inspirational level. 116 Commentary on Jer 23:28, cited by: Gross, Hayyun, p. 69. 117 Gross, Hayyun, pp. 72-73.</page><page sequence="42">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 343 scattered remarks of Qanpanton could have developed into a full fledged exegetical approach already in the commentaries of his immedi ate pupil (if at all). And, indeed, as often in the history of ideas, what at first sight seems to constitute a 'one-man-revolution,' in the end turns out to reflect broad cultural trends. Daniel Boyar?n118 has demonstrated the theoretical source of Qan panton's approach to language in scholastic linguistic philosophy '[al ready] so beloved of the Spanish Jews influenced by scholasticism,'119 and Israel Ta-Shma has argued that the basic assumptions of Qanpan ton's approach have their roots in the Spanish study-tradition of the thirteenth and fourteenth centuries that 'incorporated terms, trends of thought, and even a philosophical jargon from its Christian and Jewish environment [...] into the classical world of halachic decision-mak ing.'120 Could this be the case also with regard to the study of Scripture? Boyar?n reckons that Qanpanton might have been influenced by the fourteenth century logician (and, no less important to stress, biblical exegete), R. Joseph ibn Kaspi, who claimed that 'nearly all synonyms have a difference in meaning between them, when examined exact ingly.'121 Ibn Kaspi was an extremist in applying logical categories to the perusal of (in his eyes apparent) difficulties in Scripture's style,122 and he takes pains to stress that 'even if [Scripture] repeats a certain matter [...] this is still not to be considered redundant speech, since also the philosophers were wont to repeat their words, when saying: "we will return [to this matter] in order to elucidate.'"123 In other words, the application of philosophical concepts and scholastic linguistics to the study of Scripture existed in the fourteenth century alongside this very same trend with regard to the study of halacha. Furthermore, one specific passage in Darkei ha-Talmud seems to indicate that Qanpanton's 118 Daniel Boyar?n, "Moslem, Christian, and Jewish cultural interaction in Sefardic talmudic interpretation," Review of Rabbinic Judaism 5, 2 (2002) pp. 1-33 (henceforth: Boyar?n, Interaction). 119 Ibid., p. 2. 120 Israel Ta-Shma, "The state of talmudic studies in 15th century Spain," in: Y. Assis and Y. Kaplan (eds.), Jews and Conversos at the Time of the Expulsion, Jerusalem 1999, p. 54 [Hebrew]. 121 See: Boyar?n, Interaction, p. 5, n. 8. 122 This issue deserves further study. In the meantime, see: Wilhelm Bacher, "Joseph Ibn Kaspi als Bibelerkl?rer," in: Festschrift zu Hermann Cohens Siebzigstem Geburts tage, Berlin 1912, pp. 127-129; Shalom Rosenberg, Logic and Ontology in Jewish Phi losophy in the Fourteenth Century, Ph.

Ibn Kaspi had established that 'our holy Torah is divided into two principal categories, the one consist ing in stories and narratives [...] and the other related to commandments and exhortations.' With regard to the first category, '[many people] think that it contains superfluous and irrelevant facts and light-heartedness, like the stories in the chronicles of the kings of Israel or the kings of Mede and Persia, whom many have compared to the fables of the Talmud [emphasis added].' Against these claims Ibn Kaspi stresses that 'our holy Torah does not contain a single story that does not contribute to the perfection of the intellect.'124 Applying these views to the Talmud as well and extending them to include every single statement, while main taining the distinction between law and narrative, Qanpanton wrote: Certainly, every single statement and story which is brought in our Torah and the Gemara serves a purpose and is of benefit to the body or the soul or both of them together. All the more so [is this true] with regard to the laws to be found in them, since anything that does not serve a purpose is vanity, and it is written 'it is no vain thing to you' (Deut. 32:47).125 For several reasons it is tempting to suggest that the word 'Gemara' in this passage is a later addition. Firstly, the prooftext relates to the Torah only, and therefore cannot be said to pertain to the Talmud also. Sec ondly, and more importantly, the claim that every single word of the Talmud is of benefit to the body and the soul (and not only to a com plete understanding of the talmudic discussion) seems to constitute a novel claim that I personally have not encountered anywhere else. But actually it is highly improbable that this passage should not have reached us in its original version. Admittedly, the reference to the text's benefit to body and soul in the context of Qanpanton's otherwise strictly logical discussion of talmudic style is an oddity, but had the text related to Scripture only, it would have been completely irrelevant. Thus, the only plausible way of explaining the existence of this passage is to see it as reflecting a certain dimension in Qanpanton's methodological de velopment, his application of Scriptural exegetical modes to the analysis of the talmudic sugya. The importance of all this for our discussion is that Abarbanel adopted an approach to text that in his cultural context was already widely disseminated in several scholarly disciplines, an approach that he applied to other areas than Scriptural exegesis, such as talmudic 124 R. Joseph ibn Kaspi, Sefer ha-Sod (Tirai Kesef), In: Mishne Kesef, ed. by Isaac Last, Pressburg 1905, pp. 1-2. 125 Qanpanton, Darkei ha-Gemara, p. 7.</page><page sequence="44">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 345 and Maimonidean interpretation.126 More compelling than viewing these three in a narrow line of development - Qanpanton influenced Hayyun who influenced Abarbanel - would be to regard the scholars all as participating in the same cultural trends. 2. The search for consistent chronology: Abarbanel's claim that the Torah follows an absolutely consistent chronology is as surprising as it is novel within the framework of Jewish tradition, given that the opinion of the talmudic sages, that 'there is no earlier and later in the Torah,' was universally accepted, even though later commentators like Nachma nides and Ibn Kaspi understood it differently from earlier genera tions.127 This calls for a substantial explanation, and even though it is my intention to deal with this issue at length in a future study, some preliminary remarks are certainly in place here. Scholars like Gutwirth, Lawee and Ben-Shalom have demonstrated that Abarbanel evaluates (and even judges) biblical narrative in accor dance with the standards of humanistic historiography when he, in his introductions to the Former Prophets, relates to subjects such as author ial intent, reliance on and criticism of earlier sources, and the purpose of the books being to provide a chronology of the events.128 The sources for these emphases - which should be traced not to the Italian period of Abarbanel's life and his encounter with the Italian Renaissance (1492 1508), but rather to the earliest period of his life129 - are most probably 126 Cf. our criticism of Gidon Rothstein above, n. 19. 127 On Nachmanides, see: Isaac B. Gottlieb, '"Eyn Muqdam u-Me'uhar' in Ram ban's commentary on the Torah," Tarbiz 63, 1 (1994), pp. 41-62 [Hebrew; henceforth: Gottlieb, Eyn mukdam]; for Ibn Kaspi, see his commentaries on ISam 23:12; Is 30:17; Esther 2:19-20 and more. 128 Lawee, Scholarship, pp. 206-208; Ram Ben-Shalom, Facing Christian Culture, Jerusalem 2006, pp. 12, 70 [Hebrew]; Eleazar Gutwirth, "Don Ishaq Abravanel and vernacular humanism in fifteenth century Iberia," Biblioth?que d'Humanisme et Renais sance 60, 3 (1998), pp. 650-657. 129 Abarbanel testifies that he has read 'all their [= the ancient Romans] books of history' (Isaac Abarbanel, Yeshu'ot Meshicho, K?nigsberg 1861, 45, I). Abarbanel's broad classical learning was the natural result of his being 'the son of an influential Jewish courtier' (Netanyahu, Statesman, p. 30), and might very well have been further broadened during his years of service to King Afonso V, who was in possession of one of Europe's finest humanist libraries. Furthermore, after the victory over Castille in the battle of Aljubarotta (1385) Portugal saw a significant upsurge in national pride (Ne tanyahu, Statesman, p. 23) that eventually resulted in King Duarte's commisioning the keeper of the royal archives, Fern?o Lopes, with the task of writing the entire national history of Portugal sometime before the year 1434 (Nathan Adams, Fern?o Lopes: Late Medieval Portuguese Chronicler, Ph. D. thesis, New Jersey 1955, p. 77). There are sig nificant parallels between the way Lopes orders his chronicle and Abarbanel's under standing of the Torah's chronological order. A detailed study of these parallels will be brought in the planned study, and one of them will be mentioned below, n. 132.</page><page sequence="45">346 Jair Haas JSQ 17 also responsible for his views on the Torah's chronology.130 Arnaldo Momigliano's observation that Ordinary history is chronologically or dered'131 holds true also for the great historical chronicles that were written in Portugal during Abarbanel's formative years there, and inter esting parallels can be drawn between the chronological principles in herent in them and the way Abarbanel perceives the ordering of the pentateuchal narrative.132 130 It is possible that Abarbanel's novel approach to this issue should be seen not only against the background of his general aim to prove the Torah's absolute perfec tion, but also as an answer to specific attacks on the Torah with regard to its seeming lack of order. Rabbi Ovadiah Sforno, writing about a generation later, also in (Renais sance) Italy, states in the introduction to his Torah-commentary, that the purpose of his book is to encourage Jews, who, weary of the ongoing vicissitudes of the exile, do not any more find a purpose in clinging onto their ancestral religion. In their mouths he puts two arguments against the perfection of the Torah, which must therefore be as sumed to have been considered among some of the more serious attacks on the Torah: 'They say: what is the purpose and benefit of our holy Torah, seeing that it is wholly this-worldly [literally: material], abolishing any hope [of receiving reward] in an after life; and of what avail are its narratives, some of them being contradictory to the chronological order of things?' (R. Ovadyah Sforno, Commentary on the Torah, ed. and with notes by Ze'ev Gottlieb, Jerusalem 1980, p. 3). The fact of the this-worldliness of the Torah is an old Christian argument that troubled Abarbanel deeply, and with which he dealt at length in his no longer extant Tzedek Olamim (see: Isaac Abarbanel, Commentary on Leviticus, ed. by Avishai Shotland, Jerusalem 2005, p. 306 [henceforth: Abarbanel, Leviticus]; Noah Rosenblum, "Rationales for the omission of eschatology in the Bible," Judaism 43, 2 (1994), pp. 149-157). The argument from the lack of order in the Torah might very well have been developed by Jewish apostates, who were famil iar with the Talmud and who played a central role in the Christian anti-Jewish polemics in the generation of the Expulsion from Spain (see: Netanyahu, Statesman, pp. 218 219, and the sources referred to there). Sforno's solution to the problem is less radical than Abarbanel's. He was of the opinion that the Torah only reverses the order for specific purposes (see: commentary on Num 9:1), an opinion that is reminiscent of the approach of Nachmanides (see: Gottlieb, Eyn Muqdam). 131 Arnaldo Momigliano, The Classical Foundations of Modern Historiography, Ber keley, Los Angeles, Oxford 1990. p. 61. 132 For example: in the 16th chapter of the Chronicle of Dom Jo?o, Fern?o Lopes sketches out the way the historian ought to organise his material when confronted with separate but simultaneous plots: although in most cases the strict chronological order is to be preferred, in the case of simultaneous plots, one should be careful to distinguish one from the other, for the sake of clarity: 'Historians are [usually] much better under stood and remembered if they are perfectly well ordered than if they are otherwise; and although our intention is that we want to write of these things in a good and clear style, nevertheless such a great abundance of stories are available to us, especially at this point, that our desire and will strongly dissuade us from such ordering [...] According to our judgment, it is better to speak of some things and then of the others - though some people will not be pleased - than to mix them up confusedly, which would be much harder to understand.' (brought in: Adams, Chronicler, p. 137). These principles are implicit in many of Abarbanel's explanations of the narrative sequence in the Tor ah. Thus, for example, when explaining why the planting of the Garden of Eden (Gen 2:8) which in Abarbanel's opinion took place on the sixth day of creation, is mentioned</page><page sequence="46">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 347 3. The use of allegory: As demonstrated above, Abarbanel feared lest the allegorical method used by Maimonides and his followers be applied to the laws of the Torah, thus justifying basic Christian tenets with re gard to the abolition of their practical validity. On the other hand, when faced with the problem of the relevance of (ritual) laws no longer prac ticed, Abarbanel was more than ready to engage in large-scale allegor isation. This readiness seems to indicate an acknowledgement of the usefulness, nay the necessity, of the allegorical method in order to ex tract from the Torah the fullness of its divine message. Such a view of allegory was dominant in Abarbanel's immediate intellectual environ ment in Renaissance Italy (where he wrote his Torah commentary), in the Dialoghi d'Amore of his son, Judah Abarbanel, written in the year 1502,133 the very same year that Abarbanel the father commenced his commentary on Genesis or three years earlier than that.134 This is how Hava Tirosh-Rothschild describes it: Ebreo agreed with Ficino that philosophical wisdom is best taught through the allegorical mode [...] According to Maimonides, then, the fig urative speech of the philosophic Torah was a concession to the intellectual imperfection of the multitude. The perfect philosopher, however, must strip away the "silver lining" of metaphoric speech in order to grasp "the golden apples" of the Torah's philosophy. Leone Ebreo, by contrast, maintained that human imagination is not a hindrance to truth but the very faculty that enables the mind to recognise the beautiful [...] The good philosopher is not the one who discards the figurative language of the Torah in order to capture its philosophical con tent, but rather the one who finds in the beautiful speech of the Torah the key to the mysteries of God and creation.135 after the seventh day (ibid., 2:2-4), he wrote: 'all this was not mentioned in the section dealing with the sixth day [...] because Scripture saw fit to mention the garden and its trees adjacent and relating to Man's sin and punishment that was caused by it' (Abar banel, Genesis, p. 158). In other words, adjacency of cause and effect is crucial to the understanding of the narrative, and had Scripture mentioned the Garden of Eden in its strict chronological place, it would have impaired the integrity of the plot. 133 There has been some debate among scholars concerning the time of writing and the language in which the Dialoghi were originally written. The author accepts the conclusions of Arthur Lesley ("The place of the Dialoghi d'amore in contemporaneous Jewish thought," In: David B. Ruderman (ed.), Essential Papers on Jewish Culture in Renaissance and Baroque Italy, New York and London 1992, pp. 171-172) that they were written in Hebrew in the year 1502. 134 See above, n. 96. 135 Hava Tirosh-Rothschild, "Jewish philosophy on the eve of modernity," In: Da niel H. Frank and Oliver Leamann (eds.), History of Jewish Philosophy, London and New York 1997, pp. 523-524. On the place and role of allegory within Leone's general Weltanschauung, see: Vila-Ch?, Leone Ebreo, pp. 352-375.</page><page sequence="47">348 Jair Haas JSQ 17 It should not be surprising, then, that already in his commentary on Genesis 2-3 Abarbanel, for no apparent apologetical reason, places the existence of an allegorical level of meaning alongside the literal one, justifying it by stressing the Torah's divine essence: This is what constitutes the wondrous superiority of the divine Torah compared with any humanly authored work of wisdom or law: some of them express their intentions in a straightforward way and do not hint at any higher meaning, and some of them are to be understood according to their inner meaning only, the plain sense of the words being an empty shell. But this Torah of Moses differs from them. Its surface meaning is true and authentic, while at the same time it hints at a higher wisdom.136 These words are partly borrowed from the philosophical-homiletical Torah-commentary of Abarbanel's contemporary R. Isaac Arama, Aqe dat Yitzhak (part 1, chap. 7), which bases this view on an elaborate statement to be found in the Zohar (portion of Beha'alotekha).131 Ara ma, though, does not mention Moses in this connection, which might suggest the additional influence on Abarbanel of Christian exegesis, which from the thirteenth century and onwards was wont to emphasise the role of the human authors in the creation of Holy Writ.138 A similar view was aired by Pico della Mirandola only a dozen years earlier: The same words, the same context, and the same order in the whole passage are completely suitable for symbolising the secrets of all the worlds and of the whole of nature. It is in this respect that the book of Moses excels all other progeny of the human mind in doctrine, eloquence, and gen ius.'139 It should be stressed, though, that this view outrightly contra dicts Abarbanel's aim of demonstrating the 'wondrous measures of di vine wisdom' inherent in the plain sense (see above and below), which might explain why he subsequently abandoned the way of allegory and only turned to it when the plain sense nevertheless seemed to do insuffi cient justice to the Torah's divine perfection. The second step towards an understanding of Abarbanel's exegetical frame of mind is to recall that alongside his commitment to scientific truth and literary ideals, Abarbanel's thought also has an anti-rationa 136 Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 153. 137 Abarbanel saw Arama's book while residing in the Southern Italian kingdom of Naples (see: Sarah Heller Wilensky, The Philosophy of Isaac Arama in the Framework of Philonic Philosophy, Jerusalem and Tel Aviv 1956, pp. 50-53 [Hebrew]), whither he had arrived after the Expulsion from Spain (see: Netanyahu, Statesman, pp. 82-89). 138 For a short summary of this trend, see: A. J. Minnis and A. B. Scott, Medieval Literary Theory and Criticism, c. 1100 - c. 1375, Oxford 1988, pp. 197-212. 139 Pico, Heptaplus, pp. 94-95.</page><page sequence="48">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 349 listic side to it. Shaul Regev140 has described an important current in fifteenth-century Jewish thought, the 'rationalist-mystical' current as he called it. The two main characteristics of this current are, on the one hand, an emphasis on the superiority of the Kabbalah as a fixed set of divinely received, authoritative, mystical interpretations of the Torah, over the inferences of philosophical, rational thought; and, on the other hand, the identification of the main teachings of philosophy with those of the Kabbalah. There is no contradiction between the two, because what is emphasised is mainly the superiority of the Kabbalah as a way of attaining certainty, while the role of philosophy is reduced to the explanation, justification and rationalisation of those received truths. These views are closely connected to the 'bibliocentrism' of Pro fayt Duran described above, even if differences of view exist as to the question what constitutes the Torah's authoritative interpretation, its grammar or the mystical tradition attached to it. Regev shows that also in the writings of Abarbanel the influence of this current can be traced, but he attributes it almost exclusively to Abarbanel's identifica tion of the ten separate intelligences of philosophy with the ten sefirot of the Kabbalah.141 Abarbanel's indebtedness to this way of thinking, though, is considerably deeper and wider than described by Regev and, in fact, it is typical of most of Abarbanel's philosophical thought as well as his biblical exegesis,142 even as it entails a significant broad ening of the concept of Kabbalah. Already in the claim that the Kabba lah constitutes the divinely given oral tradition we can discern a certain blur in the distinction between Qabbalah as a set of esoteric teachings 140 Shaul Regev, "Rationalism and mysticism in fifteenth century Jewish thought," Jerusalem Studies in Jewish Thought 5 (1986), pp. 155-189 [Hebrew; henceforth: Regev, Rationalism]. 141 Ibid., pp. 181-186 142 Abarbanel's anti-rationalistic attitude appears almost wholly chrystallised in Ateret Zekenim, written in his early thirties (see: Barzilay, Anti-Rationalism, p. 74). This ought not surprise anyone. In light of the fact that from his early twenties onward Abarbanel began an intense life as a businessman, community leader and statesman, there can be no doubt that he amassed the main body of his encyclopedic learning already during his childhood and early manhood, and that he therefore also cultivated his essential intellectual stance during those years. Among possible influences two men are especially worthy of being mentioned: R. Joseph ibn Shem-Tov, 'the divine master [...] from whose mouth I heard wisdom in my youth' (Abarbanel, Exodus, p. 435), an outstanding representative of the anti-rationalistic trend of fifteenth century Spain (Regev, Rationalism, pp. 158-169), and R. Joseph Hayyun, with whom Abarbanel en joyed intellectual relations (see: Avraham Gross, "Joseph Hayyun and Isaac Abravanel: Intellectual contacts," Michael 11 (1989), pp. 23-32 [Hebrew]; ibid., Hayyun, pp. 95 103).</page><page sequence="49">350 Jair Haas JSQ 17 and Qabbalah as received tradition.143 In the worldview of Abarbanel this blurring of distinctions is translated into an attitude that 'sanctifies' any opinion, creed or dogma that is conceived as being part and parcel of Judaism. Much has been written about Abarbanel's anti-rationalism, but all can agree upon the fact that it does not entail a rejection of secular learning in general or of philosophy in particular. Rather, philo sophy is made the handmaiden of faith,144 as also indicated in the title of Seymour Felman's recent study.145 The preference given to received 'truths' over unbiased, rational analysis was bound to have an impact on Abarbanel's biblical exegesis as well. For example, if in Mifalot Elo him (1501) Abarbanel argues rationally for creatio ex nihilo,146 his treat ment of this subject in an exegetical environment does not leave any doubt as to its dogmatic character: The commentators explained that Scripture does not come to relate the order of creation, rather the word 'in the beginning' is in construct state, and the meaning is: when God began to create heaven and earth, the earth was void and empty. This is the opinion of Rashi and Ibn Ezra, and Gersonides followed in their footsteps, though he considered 'let there be light' the main clause of the sentence [...] But this interpretation is inconceivable in my eyes, since according to it Scripture does not mention the creation of heaven and earth as a primary fact, even though the very possibility of indeterminism [and its logical derivatives: prophecy, miracles, free will, reward and punish ment, etc.] depends on it.147 Abarbanel's willingness to determine questions of grammar and syntax - and, as we have seen, also theological, stylistic and other literary com plexities - by resorting to the authority of commonly accepted truths, constitutes a significant departure from peshat-exegesis. The points of similarity with the homiletical exegesis of Joseph Taitazak and his circle (Sal?nica, late fifteenth early sixteenth century)148 is striking. Regev con fined his description of the rational-mystic current to the Iberian sphere 143 See: Lawee, Tradition, pp. 103-109. 144 Thus, it would be no less correct to view Abarbanel as a representative of the moderate rationalism that dominated Hispano-Jewish intellectual circles in the fif teenth century (see: Ackerman, Jewish philosophy). 145 Seymour Feldman, Philosophy in a Time of Crisis - Don Isaac Abravanel: De fender of the Faith, London and New York 2003 [henceforth: Feldman, Defender]. 146 por opposing views regarding whether Abarbanel himself thought that he had succeeded in proving this doctrine rationally, compare: Feldman, Defender, pp. 40-66, with: Barzilay, Anti-rationalism, pp. 79-84. 147 Abarbanel, Genesis, p. 3. 148 On the life of Taitazak, see: Meir Benayahu, "Rabbi Joseph Taitatzak - Head of the Spanish Exile," In: Tzvi Ankori (ed.), Then and Now: Annual Lectures on the Jews of Greece (1977-1983), Tel Aviv 1984, pp. 21-34 [Hebrew].</page><page sequence="50">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 351 before the Expulsion, but there are clear traces of it in the thought and exegesis of Taitazak, who distinguishes between 'divine wisdom' and 'human wisdom,' the first being identifiable as the wisdom of the Torah, and the second as human logical inference.149 The relationship between the two is more or less identical with the relationship between Kabbalah and philosophy in the Spanish branch of the current, and the words used by Shimon Shalem to describe its influence on Taitazak's exegesis could equally be applied to Abarbanel: The 'divine wisdom' differs from the 'human' one with regard to its source, the way it is attained, and its veracity (that is: its authority as a determinator of truth) [...] The role of the intellect is to help understand the principles and to ground them in the science of logic and in accepted methods of inference [...] From a hermeneutical point of view this means that Taitazak is willing to 'detect' in Scripture late beliefs and opinions, and even facts that were discovered in his own generation. Everything that is accepted as true is part of the 'divine wisdom,' to which no truth is un known, and all those opinions and facts must therefore be present in the Torah.150 A full comparative study of Abarbanel's exegesis with that of late fif teenth and early sixteenth centuries darshanim is beyond the scope of the present research. At this moment, suffice it to establish that, from a hermeneutical point of view, there is a striking similarity between the two. Abarbanel's repeated affirmations of peshat and his frequent dis agreements with the interpretations of the talmudic sages is not what should deter us from recognising the darshanic aspects of his exegesis.151 The homiletical exegesis at the turn of the sixteenth century was gov erned by a set of well-defined rules and principles that make it easily distinguishable from the homiletics of the Midrash, a dominant one among them being an almost obsessive preoccupation with questions of context and sequence,152 clearly present also in the commentaries of Abarbanel. The darshanim also frequently took account with the Mid rash as incompatible with (what they considered) peshat.153 Abarbanel's aim at proving the Torah's absolute perfection contains a rationalistic aspect - the aim of reconciling the Torah with scientific and 149 Shalem, Taitazak. 150 Ibid., pp.116, 120. 151 Cf. Segal's opinion on Abarbanel's exegesis cited above, and see also the words of Barzilay (Anti-rationalism, p. 113): 'With the darshanim of all times and ages, Abra vanel shares the tendency of "squeezing" the Biblical text so that it may yield its inner treasures.' 152 Shalem, Taitazak, p. 124. 153 Ibid., p. 127.</page><page sequence="51">352 Jair Haas JSQ 17 philosophical truth as well as with the highest literary ideals - and an anti-rationalistic aspect - in order to prove his tenets Abarbanel offers many far-fetched interpretations. The third and final step towards a better understanding of Abarbanel's frame of mind when writing his commentaries is, therefore, to answer the question how and whether these opposing tendencies are reconciled in Abarbanel's consciousness, or in other words, how the anti-rationalistic tendency is rationalised and reconciled with the opposing tendency. In the analysis of the final sentences of Abarbanal's introduction to the Former Prophets brought above, it was shown that Scripture's 'se venty faces' containing 'wondrous measures of divine wisdom,' as op posed to the 'superficial peshat' most probably do not refer to addi tional layers of meaning, but rather to a deeper level of the literal sense itself. This understanding can be confirmed by what is known about developments within Christian biblical exegesis of the fifteenth century. Since the term 'superficial peshaf seems to be a translation of the term 'superficiem lit tere' current in the Christian exegesis of the time,154 this comparison naturally suggests itself. This is how Karlfried Froehlich sums up what he calls the 'state of biblical hermeneutics at the beginning of the fifteenth century:' 1. There was considerably more talk about "literal" sense than in either Augustine or in authors from intervening centuries [...] To concern oneself with the glory of the literal sense was en vogue [...] 2. In the definition of the literal sense, the older line of tying it to the human words and thus to the surface meaning of a text was being abandoned. The definitional key was now the ancient formula of God (or the Holy Spirit) as the principal author. His intention defined the literal sense [...] 3. The emphasis on God's inten tion as the definition of the literal sense was frequently coupled with a nominalist and decidedly anti-thomist distrust of words [...] 4. Another common feature was the surprisingly widespread doctrine of a "double lit eral sense" [...] a distinction between a lower, or outright "false," literal sense, the "mere grammatical signification of these words," and the true literal sense, the one the Spirit intended.155 This description is somewhat one-sided, and different views on this lar gely neglected period in Christian Bible interpretation have been put forth. Crofton Black has argued at length that the medieval tradition nf tVif* fnnr qptiqp? msiint?iinpH it? nliirp ac tVip Hrvmincmt Vip?rmp?n&lt;='iitir' 154 Lawee, Scholarship, p. 198, n. 24. 155 Karlfried Froehlich, "Always to keep to the literal sense means to kill one's soul: The state of biblical hermeneutics at the beginning of the fifteenth century," In: E. Miner (ed.), Literary Uses of Typology from the Late Middle Ages to the Present, Princeton 1977, pp. 45^6.</page><page sequence="52">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 353 model throughout the fifteenth century.156 The true state of affairs was probably more complex than any of the above descriptions, and as a matter of fact it seems that both trends ought to be reckoned with for a proper understanding of Abarbanel. The attacks on the Torah's per fection described above undoubtedly had their source in the followers of the four-sense model, who desired to denigrate the Torah's literal sense in order to justify their own allegorical interpretations. And Abarbanel, in his aim to rebut their arguments, drew his inspiration from the more novel trend in Christian exegesis described by Froehlich. Abarbanel was concerned with the glory of the literal sense. This is apparent from the analysis of his commentaries and his more than ob vious aim to reconcile Scripture with contemporary science and litera ture. His principal statement at the end of the introduction to the For mer Prophets only reinforces this conclusion and contributes to situate his exegetical aims firmly within important currents of fifteenth century exegesis. We are now in a situation where we can better appreciate the fact that Abarbanel in almost a single breath so harshly critisises Rashi's midrashic approach, on the one hand, and Ibn Ezra's philological ap proach, on the other: both of them constitute serious threats to the glory of the literal sense. Unlike Isaac Arama, Abarbanel did not think it necessary to turn to midrash or other meta-literal layers of meaning in order to glorify the Torah. On the contrary, Abarbanel was troubled by Christian attacks on the literal sense of the Torah, and apparently felt that Arama's approach somehow justified these attacks. Ibn Ezra's ap proach also downgrades the literal sense. Its stubborn insistence on the unambiguity of the words does not always enable their reconciliation with true divine wisdom. Abarbanel seems to have adopted the 'nomin alist distrust of words.' An obvious example of this is his explanation of Adam's calling his wife by the name Hava. From the introductory ques tion it is clear that Abarbanel concedes that the immediate understand ing of the verse is that he called her so because she is the mother of all living (Hay)}51 and only pressing theological and literary issues - which are hard to distinguish when the aim is to prove the Torah's divine perfection - force him to suggest an alternative, philologically disguised, interpretation. In a similar fashion, we saw that purely theological, not philological, considerations had the power to tip the scales in favor of one reading of the first verse in the Torah over against another (widely 156 Crofton Black, Pico's Heptaplus and Biblical Hermeneutics, Boston and Leiden 2006, pp. 54-94. 157 See above, n. 71.</page><page sequence="53">354 Jair Haas JSQ 17 accepted) reading. And many other interpretations brought in this study can, upon closer examination, be shown to be based on the same dis trust towards the immediate meaning of words.158 This distrust of words - which is also one of the main pillars in Qanpanton's method: the immediate meaning of the words he calls peshat, while the true meaning arrived at by way of minute analysis he calls diyyuk (precision)159 - is the link between the rationalistic and anti-rationalistic aspects of Abarba nePs exegesis, or rather the rationalisation of his habit of offering inter pretations that seem far from peshat. The starting point is the firm belief in the divine character of the Torah. All other factors, the meaning of words included, are subordinate to this primary fact. In his thought as well as in his exegesis Abarbanel discloses the influ ence of a welter of different intellectual currents, many of them opposed, contradictory and absolutely irreconcilable one with another. Equipped with an insatiable thirst for knowledge and a phenomonal intellect, Abarbanel continued to widen his intellectual horizons throughout his life. Consistency of outlook and attempts at harmonisation were not at the forefront of his concerns. But one can nevertheless discern a consis tency of approach. Abarbanel was the great Defender of Faith, and for this purpose he mobilised all of his encyclopedic knowledge as well as his extremely creative intellect. One cannot but be astonished by the combination of extreme religious conviction with the influence of and acquaintance with all the major intellectual currents of the time and an extremely well-developed critical and historical sense. It certainly turns Abarbanel into a unique phenomenon in the religio-intellectual history of Judaism. Also, in the decades after Abarbanel's death, many commentaries were written with the specific intention of extracting from scripture the divine wisdom embedded in every single one of its words. Kaiman Bland has written briefly about this characteristic in the exegesis of Isaac Qaro and Moses Alsheikh.160 Over time, this aspiration was bound to bring about certain changes in the use of the term peshat. Already in the ex 158 See, for example, the four interpretations brought above, nn. 41,46. It is possible that the purpose of the initial questions or difficulties that Abarbanel asks before the discussion of a textual unit is to shatter what at first sight seems to be the text's obvious meaning, thus paving the way for an alternative reading (for other suggestions, see: Marc Saperstein, "The method of doubts: Problematising the Bible in late medieval Jewish exegesis," In: Jane D?mmen McAuliffe et. al. (eds.), With Reverence for the Word, Oxford 2003, pp. 144-146). This is, in any case, what Abarbanel actually does. 159 Qanpanton, Darkei ha-Gemara, p. 3.

Abarbanel is to be considered one of the main contributors to the translation of the anti-rationalistic worldview into an exegetical hermeneutic. The logical and at the same time paradoxical consequence of this development was reached in the kabbalistic exegesis of Alsheikh's friend and colleague, Moses Cordovero, who denied Scrip ture's literal meaning its independent status altogether, because it seemed to him inconceivable that its trivialities could possibly be an expression of God's boundless wisdom.163 Summary, Conclusions, and Suggestions for Future Research The question whether Abarbanel's exegesis should be defined as peshat (Lawee) or as derash (Segal) has no simple answer. Abarbanel's com mentaries are, from a methodological point of view, extremely complex. To be sure, they do contain interpretations that could and should be defined as peshat, and Segal's judgement that 'Abarbanel did not enrich the treasury of Hebrew exegesis with objective commentaries of lasting value' seems a bit harsh. But it does contain a kernel of truth, and the quest for peshat was by no means Abarbanel's main incentive for writing his commentaries. Abarbanel aimed at showing the absolute perfection of the Torah from every thinkable aspect, and in spite of a developed sense for methodological issues, these were nevertheless almost comple tely subordinate to his main agenda. The present study constitutes an attempt to understand Abarbanel's exegesis through the integration of the broader historical and intellec tual contexts with Abarbanel's own principal-methodological statements of exegetical purposes and outlooks and with in-depth analyses of a few of the ways in which his exegetical principles find their practical applica tion. A major emphasis of this paper has been to disclose the futility of trying to fit the entirety of Abarbanel's exegesis into a methodological 161 See above, . 41. 162 Shimon Shalem, Rabbi Moses Alsheikh, Jerusalem 1966, p. 67 [Hebrew]. 163 Bland, Issues, pp. 64-67.</page><page sequence="55">356 Jair Haas JSQ 17 straight-jacket, and it suggests two major, interconnected directions for future research on Abarbanel's commentaries on the Torah: (1) Disclos ing the connections between Abarbanel's stance toward a host of addi tional hermeneutical issues - such as his stance toward midrash and many literary aspects of Scripture - and his principal goal of showing the Torah's perfection. (2) Attending the question: what are the ways in which Abarbanel carries out his exegetical enterprise? How much does he owe to the historical movements and methodologies of Jewish and Christian exegesis, midrash, peshat, typology, philosophical allegory, kabbalistic interpretations, sixteenth century sermons etc.? Are they all equally legitimate in his eyes as long as they serve his purposes, or are there, after all, some that are preferable to others (not only theoreti cally)? Another important issue is the extent to which the conclusions reached in the present study pertain to Abarbanel's commentaries on the Prophets. As mentioned, Abarbanel does not hesitate to pinpoint stylistic or substantial flaws in the remaining biblical books. On the other hand, it must not be forgotten that Abarbanel's stress on Scrip ture's 'seventy faces' appears in the introduction to the commentary on the Former Prophets. Many of the concerns discernable in his commen tary on the Torah, such as theological and literary soundness in their various expressions, come to the fore in the commentaries on the Pro phets as well. Here they stem not from Abarbanel's view of these books as possessing absolute divine perfection, but of his view of the prophets as, in most cases, educated men who wrote their books through divine inspiration. Nevertheless his approach seems less strained. For example, already in his commentary on the first chapter of Joshua Abarbanel finds himself forced to admit that the sending of the spies at the begin ning of chapter 2 must have taken place two days prior to Joshua's commanding the people to prepare themselves for the crossing of the Jordan River in chapter 1, verses 10-11, while he deems Gersonides's attempt to explain the events according to their order of presentation unsuccessful.164 From the point of view of Abarbanel's philosophical and theological convictions, the present study lays bare the grave shortcomings of the philological-thematic approach to Abarbanel's writings, against which Cedric Cohen Skalli has warned repeatedly.165 It has been demonstrated that Abarbanel did not hesitate to adopt conflicting or even contradict 164 Abarbanel, Former Prophets, pp. 17-18. 165 See above, . 5.</page><page sequence="56">(2010) Divine Perfection and Methodological Inconsistency 357 ing views to the extent that they served his exegetical purposes. Hence, any attempt to present the entirety of Abarbanel's philosophical writ ings as reflecting a consistent worldview is meaningless, and ways must be sought to distinguish between different levels of sincerity in the views set forth. In other words, a thorough understanding of Abarbanel's re ligious thought calls for an inter-disciplinary approach. Considering the fact that a substantial part of Abarbanel's philosophical writings are scattered throughout his biblical commentaries, students of Abarbanel's thought must not only be familiar with the essentials of his exegetical approach, they must also constantly weigh the sincerity of his words over against the exegetical 'benefit' to be derived from them. Many scholars writing on aspects of Abarbanel's philosophical outlook seem to have lacked basic awareness of the nature of his commentaries. It is hoped that the present study will contribute to the correction of this state of affairs also.</page></plain_text>
