Text in French. 264 pp., 435 b/w &amp; 110 color photos, 102 line drawings, 20 maps, 1 chart, bibliography. F 1,250 softcover. Reviewed by Eugenia W. Herbert Time was when one had to look for African weapons in baskets tucked away in the cor- ners of shops dealing in African curios. That was when they were still classed as artifacts, material culture. No more. In the last ten-fif- teen years they have been redefined as Art and have been increasingly exhibited, alone or with other objects. They have also been subjected to more intense study. It goes with- out saying that prices have risen accordingly. With the exhibition "Beaut6 Fatale: Armes d'Afrique Centrale" in Brussels (Dec. 18, 1992-Feb. 28, 1993), this art form received the ultimate imprimatur: a display of 506 objects of very high quality and a lavish catalogue, both sponsored by Credit Communal and independent of any museum. The catalogue illustrates all the objects exhibited. In addi- tion it includes a series of essays, a bibliogra- phy, and a number of excellent maps, diagrams, and old photographs, the latter primarily from the archives of the Royal Museum for Central Africa in Tervuren. Jan Elsen, referred to in the "Avant-Propos" as the "cheville ouvriere" (kingpin) of the enterprise, was apparently responsible for organizing the exhibition as well as for writ- ing the lion's share of the catalogue (and pro- viding more than half the objects exhibited). The other contributors are Francis Van Noten, William Dewey, Marc Felix, Jacques Schoonheyt, Joseph Cornet, Christian Gos- seau, and Paul Dubrunfaut. If this is the most ambitious presentation of African weapons to date, how does it measure up? Is this the definitive work on the genre as far as Central Africa is concerned? Unfortu- nately, the verdict cannot be an unqualified yes. While the catalogue examines and illus- trates an extraordinary range of objects (including shields and guns and a few black- smith's tools as well as the usual axes, swords, knives, and shields) and provides a painstak- ingly detailed analysis of forms and their dis- tribution, it is frustrating in its lack of serious attention to previous work in the field. Elsen's essays are almost entirely unfootnoted, so that one has little idea whether he is basing his dat- ing and ethnic/geographical typologies entire- ly on his own field and museum work or whether he can support them with other sources. One does not even learn where and when he has carried out fieldwork. At the same time he does not engage with other scholars such as Agthe (1985), Westerdijk (1988), and Fischer and Zirngibl (1978) to show where and why he agrees or disagrees with their attributions or typologies. Finally, his discussion and that of his fellow essayists of the meaning of these objects is at best super- ficial. They are too content to settle for stylistic analysis and some reference to manufacturing technique, alluding only tangentially to the status, prestige, and ritual roles of these objects or to their use in exchange without fully exploring the weapon form itself as a central symbol of power. As is apt to be the case in catalogues by many hands, the individual contributions are uneven. Francis Van Noten's essay, "Premibre Exploitation du Fer en Afrique Centrale," which immediately follows the introduction and acknowledgments, would better have been omitted altogether. Van Noten focuses narrowly on his own work among the Amadi and writes about iron smelting in a way that would certainly confuse the uninitiated read- er. His eighth-century B.C. dating of iron smelting at Meroe and Nok is also unaccept- ably early. In insisting on the homogeneity of iron-working techniques throughout the Great Lakes region, he seems to ignore the exhaustive work of Georges Cdlis (1976, 1987, 1991) in the area. William Dewey covers virtually the same territory much more comprehensively in the next chapter. With great clarity and economy, he looks at both iron smelting and forging technology and sets it nicely in its socio-cos- mological context. Incidentally, one hopes that his text will lead the reader to realize how misleading is Elsen's opening statement that iron is easy to work, easier than copper or bronze. Dewey underscores the tremendous importance of iron in all aspects of African life, noting especially the strong ties in Central Africa between king and smith, royal power and iron working. He is also one of the few authors in the catalogue to give careful citations for all references, and although he draws on his own fieldwork, he does not allow it to dominate the presentation. Marc Felix takes up the theme of the exhi- bition title in his essay, "La Terrible Beaute des Outils de Mort: Les Armes et la Sculp- ture." He poses the paradox of the beauty of the individual objects and their death-dealing purpose. Here, I think, he misses the larger point. It is not so much death per se that these objects symbolize, as power. Most of the objects displayed (and collected) are, he acknowledges, not weapons of everyday use in war and hunt, but those made to take their place among the emblems of office of kings and chiefs or to be used in rituals such as cir- cumcision; they have been deliberately trans- lated into the ceremonial realm. While they originate with utilitarian objects, the elabora- tion of form and the addition of materials such as copper, brass, and ivory alter their role. To be sure, they signify the death-deal- ing aspect of political and ritual power, but this is only one dimension of their message. Like iron itself, the weapons commonly allude to the complexities and ambivalences of power. The focus, then, should be on the materials as well as the form, and on the com- bined and multivocal statements that they make (cf. Herbert 1984). Felix recognizes the symbolism with which these objects are charged but does not take advantage of research already available to help elucidate them. He, too, provides no references for his essay, and his generalizations about usage, manufacture, and adornment need to be but- tressed by specific examples to be credible. Felix also discusses the presence of sculp- tural forms on the weapons, specifically hu- man and animal forms. Here he makes use of Elsen's division of Central Africa into sixteen groups (see below), concluding that "natural- istic decoration is concentrated in southern Zaire where societies are stratified, generally matrilineal and live primarily from agricul- ture" (p. 35, my translation). Why? What is the connection? And, of course, one may argue that such societies are not at all unique to southern Zaire. Other essays oscillate between micro and macro perspectives. Joseph Cornet looks at Kuba arms, with a brief addendum about chiefly knives of the Woyo and Kakongo; Christian Gosseau sorts out the fascinating ramifications of the nugulu execution knife, using the Belgian explorer-administrator Coquilhat's writings as his point of departure; Elsen demonstrates the difficulty of classify- ing the Ndengese oshele simply as currency because of the magical properties ascribed to it. Paul Dubrunfaut's short essay on trade guns is intended primarily to identify them by type, but it also notes colonial attempts to african arts * january 1994 89</page><page sequence="2">regulate the commerce. It does not tackle the impact of such arms on the region or discuss ways in which Africans embellished these weapons according to their own lights. On the macro side, Jacques Schoonheyt takes a world historical perspective, setting the scene for his brief but well-supported sur- vey of iron weapon currencies by reference to ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the silent trade of the Carthaginians. Like Felix, howev- er, he tends to assume the historical validity of the notion "tribe": one tribe, one currency, or one style. Also in the macro category is Elsen's chapter on "La Guerre," one of the weakest in the entire catalogue. Contra- dicting Felix, who tends to romanticize the precolonial past, he describes African warfare as a bloody, cannibalistic affair when it pitted one "tribe" against another. After several such sweeping introductory generalizations, he offers case histories of specific campaigns carried out mainly by the Zande and their neighbors, stressing the adaptation of war- fare to the different environments of forest, savanna, and river valley. What are his sources? If these are nineteenth-century wars, how much have they been influenced by incursions of slavers? Again, we go from gen- eralization to detail without the necessary context to make sense of these accounts. At the heart of the catalogue, however, are the two long chapters by Elsen, the first proposing a terminology for the various types of arms, the second a division of Central Africa into sixteen groups. In the first case, the two main categories are, logi- cally, offensive and defensive weapons. Here the accompanying diagrams are very useful, especially to illustrate his interest- ing hypotheses about the evolution in sev- eral directions of the throwing knife in tandem with population movements into different ecosystems. When he comes to the "Aperqu par Com- plexe Ethnique," Elsen acknowledges that he bases his classification on offensive weapons more than defensive: "Certain tribes have been placed in a complex as a function of their hand weapons whereas their shields might belong to another group" (p. 142, my translation). In fact, while he refers to ethnic groups in his schema, he is fully aware, thankfully, that arms are easily traded, copied, or captured, and that populations have been in motion throughout Central Africa. Hence ethnic labels are fluid at best, and it is preferable to classify arms by territo- rially delineated clusters, Elsen's sixteen groups, especially since he stresses the im- portance of topography in the evolution of weapons. The defining characteristics of each group are summarized briefly and illustrated by relevant objects in the exhibition. In addi- tion each group has its map (for some reason all of them have current country names in English) identifying the ethnic groups referred to and embellished with diagrams of the predominant forms. Photographs show warriors in full regalia brandishing some of the weapons in question, although they tend to have a very staged look. Elsen's groups are certainly an improve- ment on the older classification by "tribe," although in the end he, too, uses ethnic attri- butions for each individual object. At the same time, he suggests the limitations of this classi- fication by pointing out the distribution of some types of arms well beyond the bounds of his group-boundaries may be even more permeable for these objects than for other cul- tural artifacts. Given this permeability, it is not ultimately clear how Elsen decided to draw lines where he has: does the core area of a throwing knife type, for example, necessarily correspond to that of spears or swords? Some- times the diagrams seem to suggest that sever- al types of arms provide the criteria, other times a single one. Inevitably lances and spears are the stepchildren of the exhibition, neither as various nor as spectacular as the repertoire of knives, axes, and swords. Information about each object includes the local name where known as well as ethnic provenance and date. In the case of museum collections, one assumes that the date refers to acquisition by the museum or donor. In the case of private collections, the source of most of the objects exhibited, it would be helpful to have more information. Elsen notes that because iron rusts, few weapons extant today can claim great antiquity. On the other hand, Felix claims to have examined many old, reliably dated weapons, which entitles him to conclude that the late nineteenth cen- tury was the Golden Age of indigenous arms manufacture in Central Africa, the apogee of a long technical and artistic evolution. But most of the objects that were in the exhibition have twentieth-century dates, and one must even consider the possibility that some may have been made in the colonial period as gifts or to meet Western taste, as Enid Schildkrout and Curtis Keim have demonstrated in the case of Mangbetu anthropomorphic art (1990). Hence any attempt to propose a very deep history of the evolution of styles is pre- mature. At the same time, neither style nor function is static. Probably no schema can encompass the mind-boggling diversity in a single area, nor the adaptation to new condi- tions. My own recent experience in an Ekonda village in Zaire leads me to believe that there are many types of weapons which are still uncatalogued and whose uses and forms are continuing to change. Beautd Fatale, then, provides an invaluable visual resource. Perhaps it is too much to expect that it would be equally good in prob- ing the meaning of some of these objects. It is true, too, that some of the most sophisticated work in this area has not yet been published, such as Colleen Kriger's dissertation on iron working in Central Africa (1993), which not only critiques earlier typologies but shows how arms functioned in a historical and socio-political context. Nevertheless, most of the contributors have not made use of the published literature, much more abundant than they seem to realize, to go substantially beyond formal analysis. These objects are in many cases the best "texts" we have to deci- pher changing economic, political, social, and religious relations; they speak far more than the language of beauty. One last concern. Of the 506 objects illus- trated in the catalogue (which one assumes were all exhibited), more than half are in the collection of Jan Elsen, the organizer and pri- mary author of Beaute Fatale. Another 70 are from the collection of Marc Felix (and another 35 from an unidentified "CP"). This makes it in large measure an exhibition of three private collectors, with all that this implies in art mar- ket terms. Shouldn't this at least be acknowl- edged more openly from the start?
