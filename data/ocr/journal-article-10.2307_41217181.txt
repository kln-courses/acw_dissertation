<plain_text><page sequence="1">In Search of Merymutef , « Lord of Khayet » It would surely be excessive to speak of an important cult in honour of the god Merymutef in Egypt. His name in fact appears so rarely in Egyptian texts that we have great difficulty in grasping his personality and nature, and we can venture to state the scarcity of documentation on Merymutef has led Egyptologists to neglect this divinity (1). Nevertheless, this short paper aims to show that his figure was a little more complex than it is generally believed. In the Egyptian texts, Merymutef is the only god to carry the title of « lord of Khayet {H'yt) (2) », a settlement identified with Manqabad (3) in the Xlllth Upper Egyptian nome, and situated on the left bank of the Nile, about 11.5 km downstream from Asyut. It may be assumed, therefore, that Merymutef had strong cultic as- sociations with that locality, where most likely he played the role of pre-eminent deity. We know nothing about the beginning of Merymutef' s worship. The earliest occurrences of his name appear on a number of coffins of the IXth-XIIth dynasties discovered at Asyut (4). However, it is from the New Kingdom onwards that Merymutef achieved a more significant role in the Egyptian pantheon, when, as « lord of Khayet », he starts to appear outside of the territory of his locality. Furthermore, in the geographical list of Aby dos (5), Khayet replaces (1) Cf. W. Helck, in Lexikon der Ägyptologie, IV, 96 and E. Cruz-Uri- BE, H ibis Temple Project I.

It is likely that in the XVIIIth dynasty the king Amenhotep IV/Akhenaton was involved in the construction or embellishment of a temple at Khayet. A. Kamal, who excavated in Manqabad in 1910, found a limestone block with the cartouche of Akhenaton's god (6). According to the brief description given by the archa- eologist, this block was part of a large building. Kamal also brought to light a limestone fragment bearing the name of Merymutef with the epithet « lord of Khayet » (7). In addition, a funerary statuette (8), discovered in a necropolis of the Ptolemaic Period located north-west of Manqabad, belongs to the « first prophet {hm-ntr tpy) of Merymutef, lord of Khayet, Nbiry », in- forming us that Merymutef' s cult was still active in that period, and implying the presence of a specific priesthood in his honour. This statuette, to my knowledge, represents the only attestation of a priest of this divinity. In his role of « lord of Khayet », Merymutef is in a few cases associated with the lioness goddess 'Ipipt (9). On the back-pillar of the statuette of the king's son Mry-ms, dated to the reign of Amenhotep III and coming probably from Asyut, the offering- formula is addressed to the gods « Wepwawet of the South, con- troller of the Two Lands, Merymutef « and « Ipipet, lord(s) of Khayet » (10). Here we encounter a unique example of the use of the hieroglyph of the ram-headed god as determinative for Merymutef' s name. In a scene of the Great Hall of the temple of Abu Simbel, the « lord of Khayet » Merymutef is represented ram- headed, furnished with both horizontal and curved horns, and holding the z^is-sceptre and the ankh-sign. Behind him a goddess, named 'Ipt and with the epithets « lady of the sky [nbt pt), (6) A. Kamal, « ASAE » 11 (1911), 3. See also: PM IV, 259. (7) Kamal, op. cit., 3. (8) Ibid., 4 and PM IV, 259.

In the so-called « litany of Wasit » of the XlXth dynasty, listing the names of female deities and their localities, this goddess appears, as the main divinity of Khayet, without her companion (12). Of this text two versions are known. The first one, very damaged, is engraved on blocks from Karnak of the reign of Ramesses II; the second version is in the sanctuary of Ramesses III within the great temple of Amon at Karnak. Here, the « lady of Khayet » is invoked, in order to propitiate the reigning king, between « Hathor lady of Meden » and « Hathor lady of Cusae ». It is worth noting that in both these ex- amples, we encounter another different spelling of her name, 'Ipwy, and that in the version dating to Ramesses IFs reign it is followed by the determinative of the lioness goddess. The worship of Merymutef was not restricted to the territory of Khayet. A single document bears witness to the presence of a cult in honour of Merymutef in Sinai. In the temple of Hathor at Serabit el-Khadim,- a stela of the XVIIIth dynasty with the god's name has been found (13). In the inscription, Merymutef is invoked in order that he « may give a beautiful life, favour and love » to the k3 of the owner, the hunter 'nnsw, represented bringing a burning censer and pouring water on offerings before the god, of which only one hand with ^is-sceptre and part of his human head are preserved. Merymutef' s name appears also in the list of Memphite gods in- scribed in the chapel of Ptah-Sokar in the temple of Seti I at (11) R. Lepsius, Denkmäler aus Ägypten und Äthiopien, III, 188c; J.F. Champollion, Monuments de l'Egypte et de la Nubie. Notices Descriptives, I, 65; PM VII, 102. Merymutef « lord of Khayet » is depicted as an an- thropomorphic god with the head of a ram also on an Osiride pillar of the same sanctuary; in this context his figure is preceded by a ram-headed Mon- thu: Lepsius, op. cit., V, 154 [bottom]; Champollion, op. cit., I, 68 and PM VII, 105.

According to this list, Merymutef shared his residence with the god Hry-tp-snw.f, within a shrine called « Behind the South Wall » (h3 inb rsy), whose name presumably refers to its lo- cation in the Shetayet precinct of Sokar at Memphis (15). The presence of the god is also testified in the great temple in Karnak. On the eighth pylon, of the XVIIIth dynasty and restored by Seti I, Merymutef is depicted in human form holding the w3s- sceptre and ankh-sign and referred to as the « great god (ntr 3), lord of the sky {nb pt) », who gives « every life and domination to the King of Upper and Lower Egypt, Lord of the Two Lands Men- maat-Re » (16). As we shall see, there may also be indications of the worship of the god in the temple of Hibis, at least during the XXVIIth dynasty, and at Dendera in the Graeco-Roman Period. The meaning of the name Mry-mwt.f does not present any problem and can be easily translated as « Beloved of his mother ». But who is this mother who loves her son? The choice is rather res- tricted. The female divinities with whom he was usually associated are not many. Besides the goddess Ipui, Merymutef is connected with Nut, and some clues suggest that she was the mother of the god of Khayet.

One may infer that, by presenting himself behind Shu, Tefnut, Geb and Nut, Merymutef tried to trace his descent from these divinities. As for 3h-it.f (« Glorious one of his father ») and Hry-tp-snw.f (« Chief over his brothers »), they, as well as Merymutef, are probably in- tended to be local children of Geb and Nut, as the meaning of their names eloquently suggests. In particular, Hry-tp-snw.f, besides these coffins (18), is quoted, to my knowledge, only in the list of Memphite gods of Abydos and even here he is in the company of Merymutef. On other coffins from Asyut (19) the name of Merymutef is preceded by those of Osiris, Isis, Seth and Nephthys, all children of Geb and Nut. In this context he seems to take the place of another son of Nut, the god Horwer. If so, the Xlllth nome of Upper Egypt tended to regard the main god of Khayet, lo- cated in its territory, as a component of the Great Ennead and as a form, or preferably as a brother of Horwer. A few documents provide evidence in favour of this hypothesis. H. Kees has already pointed out that the religious traditions of the Xlllth Upper Egyptian nome were partly influenced by the Heliopolitan theology (20). Furthermore, the presence of Akhenaton in Manqabad and the fact that, on the naos of Ismailia (21) of the XXXth dynasty, Khayet is enumerated amongst the primordial cities erected by Shu during his terrestrial reign, just before the re- ign of Re, both suggest that the locality had strong solar conno- tations. Also, the list of Egyptian deities engraved in the temple of Edfu (22) seems to testify to the existence of a significant tie between the gods Merymutef and Horwer: the name of Merymutef is there immediately followed by that of Horwer, « son of Nut ». More interesting and informative is a scene on the east wall of the so-called room G in the temple of Hibis (23) of the XXVIIth (18) See also: Chassinat - Palanque, op. cit., 25.

Here the four gods form, clearly and un- equivocally, a divine family. The king is shown offering linen to Geb « prince of the gods », Nut « who bore the gods », Merymutef, « great god who dwells in Hibis », and Horwer, « son of Nut ». It may be worthwhile to mention that both Merymutef and Horwer are represented with the head of falcon, but, unlike Horwer, Merymutef appears uncrowned, probably in order to stress his min- or importance in respect to his elder brother. Moreover, in the temple of Dendera (24), the gods Geb and Nut are followed by Merymutef « in ТЗ-n-'Itm (25), powerful god (shm ntr), venerable (šps), beautiful of face (nfr hr) (26) », an anthropomorphic deity named Nb-shb ntr (3 and a falcon-headed Horwer, labelled as « son of Nut, foremost of 'Iwnt, venerable falcon, many coloured of plumage ». Merymutef appears here as a youth: he is pictured in fully human form, holding the u^s-sceptre in his left hand, the right arm raised towards the shoulders of Nut, and with a lock of hair sticking out from his nemes. As for his youthful aspect, Merymutef himself is quite explicit: in a sarcophagus of a certain P3-di-wsir of the Late Period (27), the god, represented in human form, claims to be « Horus within his egg » (Hr m-hnw swht.f). Even though the association between the god Horus and the egg seems to refer above all to the young Horus, son of Isis (28), it seems also connected with the filiation from the goddess Nut. For example, in Chapter 77 of the Book of the Dead (29), the deceased, after having affirmed to be the one who has « risen like the mighty hawk [of gold], that come forth from his egg », claims to take his seat « among those first born gods of Nut ».

Hail, о Egg! I am Horus who lives for million of years ». It still remains to discuss briefly another problem concerning the figure of Merymutef. He is indeed usually referred to by scholars as a ram god, as if this was his most peculiar and signifi- cant aspect. But examination of the available sources shows that this iconography is neither exclusive nor predominant. As we have seen, Merymutef is above all pictured as fully human (Dendera, Karnak, Sinai and coffin of P3-di-wsir), or, in one case, as an an- thropomorphic god with the head of a falcon (Temple of Hibis). It is not easy to judge whether the iconography of a ram stressed a connection of Merymutef with a particular god, or whether it was representative of a specific aspect of his own nature. Some scholars have resolved the issue by stating that Merymutef was nothing but a local form of the god Khnum (31). At present, this hypothesis is not corroborated by any document and there is no telling just why Merymutef may be pictured as a ram, above all in association with Ipui. Moreover, according to the scanty available documents, this iconography, like the attestations of Ipui, seems to be limited to the New Kingdom. P. Monte t argued that the ram aspect of Merymutef was due to his relation with the city of Cusae in the XlVth nome of Upper Egypt, not very far from Khayet, and where the goddess Hathor was worshipped. According to this scholar, Merymutef exercised, together with Hathor herself, a protective function towards the ovine species of that locality (32). Even though this connection is rather puzzling, the fact that the goddess Ipui seems to be a form of Hathor, and the presence of a cult of Merymutef in the temple of the goddess in Sinai, might point in the same direction. However, Hathor was worshipped also in the Xlllth nome as main divinity of the city of Meden (33), modern Deir Durunka, located very close to Khayet, and where, in the (30) Budge, op. cit., I, 148-140; Allen, op. cit., 48.

In short, the god Merymutef most likely had his origin in the XlIIth nome of Upper Egypt, where, according to the local theology, he played the role of child of Geb and Nut. In this capacity, by taking the very appropriate form of a youthful god, his aspect was, to be sure, in harmony with the impression he wanted to produce. Moreover, his cult-centre, Khayet, was located between Asyut and Cusae, and it seems only proper that the Egyptians could represent him as child of Nut of the XlIIth nome, together with Horwer, who indeed in Cusae was believed to be another son of Nut (35). In the lack of more explicit information, the problem concerning the connections between Merymutef and the ram must be left unsettled. Nevertheless, it is not possible to rule out the possibility that Cusae itself, and its goddess Hathor, contributed, as suggested by Montet, to the creation of Merymutef's aspect of a ram. Moreover, it is likely the pre-eminent Hathor who hides behind the minor female deity Ipui. Bologna Marco Zecchi (34) Chassinat - Palanque, op. cit., 137.
