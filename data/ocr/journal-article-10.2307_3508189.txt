<plain_text><page sequence="1">Gulliver among the Horses A. D. NUTTALL New College, Oxford Gulliver, newly landed on unknown soil, some leagues south of Nuyts Land, sees in a field a group of repulsive animals. Revolted by the sight he eagerly pursues his way along the beaten road, hoping to find some human habitation. But, almost at once, he meets with one of the unpleasant creatures, full in his path: The ugly Monster, when he saw me, distorted several Ways every Feature of his Visage, and stared as at an Object he had never seen before; then approaching nearer, lifted up his fore Paw, whether out of Curiosity or Mischief, I could not tell: But I drew my Hanger, and gave him a good Blow with the flat Side of it; for I durst not strike him with the Edge, fearing the Inhabitants might be provoked against me, if they should come to know, that I had killed or maimed any of their Cattle. (Gulliver's Travels, Part Iv, Chapter I (p. 224))1 This is how Swift begins his narrative of Gulliver's sojourn among the Houyhnhnms, or rational horses. The creatures he saw, first in the field and then in the road, are of course not Houyhnhnms but Yahoos. Only gradually does it become clear, to Gulliver and to the first-time reader, that the bestial Yahoos are in fact human beings (that the horses are rational is revealed much more rapidly). The writing, as usual, is spare and colourless. But this does not so much preclude as enhance a certain dream-like intensity. When I say 'dream-like' I mean just that: like a dream - not like most literary versions of dreams. The resemblance has something to do with a combina- tion of distinctness and paucity of information and also with the way the horrible animals are first seen at a safe distance in an ordinary field and then, without transition or preparation, one suddenly appears in the human territory of the road. Childhood memories of some huge cow or bull, dung- encrusted, encountered unexpectedly in a lane may play their part. But what Gulliver sees is, of course, much worse. Such is the immediate impression made by the passage: an absolute, undoubted nastiness (not an evil; we need the more childish word) threaten- ing the person with whom we are for the moment entirely identified, occurring in an almost blank environment. The elementary impression of something utterly and manifestly revolting is, and remains, the most impor- tant feature of the passage, but other things are happening. Even a first-time 1 Gulliver's Travels is quoted from The Prose Writings ofJonathan Swift, edited by Herbert Davis and others, i6 vols (Oxford 1939-74), XI (revised 1959).

The dry prose finds space to make us aware that, just as Gulliver is seeing something he cannot name, so the creature before him is staring 'as at an Object he had never seen before'. Thus even within this narrative of primary, utterly objective, repulsion there is a moment of implied reciprocity, or relativism. The first-time reader may even wonder, 'When the other raised his fore-paw, was he perhaps making a gesture of friendship, as it were, offering to shake hands?'. The complex distortion of the visage carries, moreover, an implicit suggestion of human facial expres- sion, so much richer and more various than anything we see in brutes. Even if the thought is not there when we first read the passage, it can gradually enter our sense of what must have happened as we read on and become aware that the Yahoos are human. But in that case Gulliver is wildly astray; he would, but for a ludicrously-misconceived apprehension, have killed without provocation an unarmed fellow human being who had done no more than extend his hand. The other may even have been smiling. The passage, with its strong and its weak signals, is doubly disorientating. Gulliver is of course immediately surrounded by the Yahoos, who attack him by dropping excrement on him from the branches above his head. But Gulliver, the intruder in Utopia, is the aggressor. The Yahoos, themselves no party to the happiness of Houyhnhnms Land, attack (ineffectively) with excrement. Later the Houyhnhnms themselves will repel Gulliver's intru- sion in an opposite manner; as they deal with diseases by 'a great Evacuation' (Iv. 6 (p. 253)) so they will deal with this unwanted invasion of the body politic by a simple act of extrusion. What I have called 'the weak signals' in the present passage are, as it turns out, immediately congenial to the prejudices of the twentieth century. If we try to write 'Gulliver' in the 'little language' of the Journal to Stella we get 'Gullible' and this, it might be said, is the key. There is, however, a snag. Gullible is not known to the Oxford English Dictionary before the nineteenth century, though the puzzling word cullible (having the same meaning) appears to have been in use in Swift's time (see, for example, Swift's letter to Pope of 16 July 1728).2 Meanwhile the verb, to gull, was of course common currency. Certainly Gulliver is from the first entirely deceived by appear- ances. The reader quickly intuits that the horses Gulliver admires so fervently are cold, passionless, and, at the last, cruel. This impression, faint at first, is overwhelming by the end of the book, when Gulliver shrinks from the obviously virtuous Portuguese captain and prefers the society of his horses to that of his wife and children. No one, at the end of Gulliver's last voyage, can doubt, it is said, that the hero is mad. 2 The Correspondence ofJonathan Swift, edited by Harold Williams, 5 vols (Oxford, 1963-65), 111 (1963), 294-</page><page sequence="3">A. D. NUTTALL 53 Such is the critical orthodoxy of the twentieth century, though it is true that since the beginning of the I96os various powerful voices have been raised in dissent.3 There is moreover one forceful technical argument which supports this orthodoxy. Gulliver's fourth voyage is, quite clearly, a comic extravaganza. If there is one observation which applies as plainly to the first readers of Gulliver's Travels as it does to the most recent, it is that this book astonishes by reversing the ordinary disposition of characters; it turns human beings into dumb animals and it makes horses into grave sages. The logical implication of this is simple and unavoidable; in ordinary life it must be the other way round: horses must be dumb animals and such sagacity as is available must be gleaned from human beings. Were it otherwise the book would not be extravagant, would not be comic. Where did Swift find the characteristics, the thoughts, the behaviour of the Houyhnhnms, unless from human beings in their graver moments (especially, say, from certain Stoics of antiquity)? The argument cuts cleanly but every good Swiftian will wish to resist it. The Dean would never have wasted time on the vacuous irony of mere reversal. He will always wish to fold into the most extravagant image, the most preposterous invention, an element of nagging likeness, or even of mere truth. The argument from comic extravagance needs to be put, however, because its failure is instructive. We begin to realize in consequence that all the great ironists, since Socrates said that he knew he knew nothing, have at some level always meant the thing they said in jest. Even tragic irony (a different but related thing) actually works most potently through an unlooked-for coincidence with truth rather than by any pleasure we may take in the manifest error; when Oedipus says he will track down the murderer of Laius he errs in supposing the culprit to be someone other than himself, but the force of the tragic irony lies in the fact that he will, in due course, carry out his promise to the letter. Swift, we know in our bones, will want us to think, if only at moments and against the odds, 'What are we but Yahoos?'. SThe satirist satirized view is most ably argued, perhaps, by Robert C. Elliott in his The Power ofSatire: Magic, Ritual, Art (Princeton, NewJersey 1960), especially pp. 2 11-2 I. W. B. Carnochan, 'The Complex- ity of Swift: Gulliver's Fourth Voyage', SP, 60o (1963), 23-44 (p. 23), provides a useful summary of criticisms pursuing the view that in the fourth book it is Gulliver and the horses who are satirized, rather than the human race.

That Swift might have preferred coldness to warmth is not just conceivable, it is probable. Moreover, the implication of this preference, that intense love is ruled out, is precisely the kind of unwelcome corollary he would delight in adducing. He may even have seen himself at such moments less as the English Rabelais than as the successor of that Siger of Paris whom Dante describes: 'leggendo nel vico delli strami I sillogizzo invidiosi veri' (Paradiso, x. 137; 'Lecturing in Straw street, he set forth in syllogisms truths his hearers hated'). That Gulliver's misanthropy is to some extent shared by Swift was the common presumption until the present century. William Warburton spoke for many when he accused Swift of degrading his species and carrying satire to the point of mere destruction: 'And now the Fig-leaf is so cleanly plucked off, what remains but bravely to strike away the rotten Staff, that yet keeps our doting Parents on their last legs.'4 One half suspects the presence of a Freudian equivocation in 'the rotten staff' immediately following the re- moval of the fig leaf, as if Warburton with some part of his mind percevied that Swift's real motive was a hatred of sexuality, so that he sought not only to degrade but also to emasculate mankind. Moreover, Swift, notoriously, accepted the charge of misanthropy. 'I hate and detest that animal called man', he told Pope, 'although I heartily love John, Peter, Thomas and so forth', and added, 'Upon this great foundation of Misanthropy (though not Timons manner) The whole building of my Travells is erected' (Correspon- dence, III, 103). Writing to Charles Ford on Ig January 1723/4 he affirms that he hates Yahoos of both sexes: even Stella and Madame de Villette are 'onely tolerable at best, for want of [the society of] Houyhnhnms' (Correspondence, Iii, 4). On I I September 1725 he wrote to Thomas Sheridan: 'You will every day find my Description of Yahoes more resembling' (Correspondence, III, 94). To be sure, the tone is jesting, especially in the second of these. But (once more) few Swiftians will suppose that the irony is of the kind which simply cancels the apparent assertion. As the Examiner (7 June 171 I), Swift wrote: 'Nothing can well be more mortifying, than to reflect, that I am of the same Species with Creatures capable of uttering so much Scurrility, Dulness, Falshood and Impertinence, to the Scandal and Disgrace of Human Nature' (Works, III, 171-72). The piece was anonymous but the voice is Swift's own. Yet the peculiar frisson at one's biological kinship with the most odious of all creatures is precisely what is to charge the most powerful moment in Gulliver's Travels: Gulliver goes swimming on a hot day and a certain female Yahoo, seeing him, makes amorous advances. It is then that he knows, by a test used to this day by working scientists, that he is of the same species as the 4 A Critical and Philosophic Enquiry into the Causes of Prodigies and Miracles (London, 1727), in Swift: The Critical Heritage, edited by Kathleen Williams (London, 1970), pp. 71-72.</page><page sequence="5">A. D. NUTTALL 55 Yahoos, though of course the biologist requires, as Swift does not, that the union be fertile. Odysseus, the first traveller in European literature, wanted above all to go home. Gulliver's 'poor Wife' (Iv. I (p. 221)) seems to have been quite as faithful as Penelope, but she and his home are alike odious to him after he has been permitted to kiss the hoof of the Houyhnhnm. The horror of wife, family, and home is, at its root, identical with the horror of biological kinship. Yet here, in the extremity of his madness, Gulliver can speak with what is recognizably the voice of Swift: My Reconcilement to the Yahoo-kind in general might not be so difficult, if they would be content with those Vices and Follies only which Nature hath entitled them to. ... This is all according to the due Course of Things: But, when I behold a Lump of Deformity, and Diseases both in Body and Mind, smitten with Pride, it immedi- ately breaks all the Measures of my Patience. (Iv. 12 (p. 296)) Quite clearly the same savage indignation tore at Swift's heart: Patrick Delany tells how Swift asked a friend whether 'the corruptions and villainies of men in power did not eat his flesh and exhaust his spirits?'. When his friend answered that they did not, Swift cried out in a fury: 'Why, why, how can you help it, how can you avoid it?'5 Of the two reactions Gulliver's is the more temperate. W. B. Carnochan, reviewing these materials, concedes that at the end of the book Gulliver, like Timon or Moliere's Alceste, is himself satirized. But, he adds, thejoke is a painful one; he endorses the view ofJohn F. Ross that it is 'at the expense of a very important part of himself'.6 Claude Rawson, similarly, finds a certain doubleness in the final Timonian misanthropy of Gulliver. Plainly, he says, Gulliver is insane, but his reclusiveness and ranting stand for a position which is seriously asserted by Swift; meanwhile, however, the ranting, the manner, is Gulliver's, not Swift's. In this way Swift can distance himself from the charge of extremism while contriving to press his own central accusation against the human race.' This is criticism at its best, lucid, discriminating, and sensitive, but I am not quite persuaded that it is right. Carnochan suggests a simple clash of sympathies: Swift both despises and sympathizes with the misanthropy of Gulliver. Rawson sug- gests a more organized tension: both Swift and Gulliver despise the human race but Swift implicitly dissociates himself from extreme misanthropy. I would prefer to say that Swift simultaneously asserts both the full, extreme misanthropy of Gulliver and its human absurdity, knowing that the two are, at root, not opposed but logically interlocked. Everyone knows, in a primary, perhaps a biologically primary, fashion that to be repelled by one's wife and child merely on account of their s Cited by W. B.

Swift, who to put it mildly, was no fool, certainly knew this. At the same time, if human kind stinks, then Gulliver is absolutely right. Here also the thought burns in Swift's mind with a primal force, rooted in infantile responses, growing powerfully from an instinctive to a fully ethical revulsion. By their dung ye shall know them: the human variety is so much more offensive than the equine. The horse is a comelier, more fragrant thing than this beast which, alone among animals, maims and tortures its own kind. It may be that the point at issue between myself and Rawson is a vanishing one, for in the essay I have cited he immediately qualifies the opposition I described by adding: 'But his [Gulliver's] are the final words which produce the taste Swift chose to leave behind: it is no great comfort or compliment to the reader to be assaulted with a mean hysteria that he cannot shrug off because, when all is said, it tells what the whole volume has insisted to be the truth' (p. 73). These words close the gap I would have closed. Indeed it was shut fast from the beginning by the latent logic of the narrative. The effect of this is to expose an anomaly in ethics; moral discourse is sometimes species- based in a radical manner, sometimes not. Species-based morality makes love of mankind primary; to desire the destruction of the human race is, in this scheme, axiomatically wicked and no moral defence of such a desire is even conceivable. Non-species-based morality, on the other hand, recog- nizes no such practical axiom (it is, in G. E. Moore's terms, more clearly 'non-naturalistic').8 It permits one to step back, even from one's own species, and to form an ethical judgement on it. Within this morality it is perfectly possible to argue, for example, that the human race taken as a whole is more bad than good, so that a collective suicide of the species is in truth our ultimate duty. Because the structure of species-based morality is simultaneously in force, this proposition immediately registers as both wicked and lunatic. But, because the non-species-based morality also figures powerfully in our conceptual scheme, the proposition 'man is vile' can be cogent. In Gulliver's Travels Swift, working simultaneously from a wicked humour and a black conviction of depravity, chose to cross the lines of nature and convention in a manner calculated to create the maximum disturbance. The newly fashionable cultural relativisim of the Enlightenment, which led even the staid Locke to write with a kind of glee about the Christian Mengrelians who bury their children alive, gave Swift the opportunity for the necessary initial disorientation: what is bad here may be good there.9 But then he switches from relativisim to an absolutism so stark as to be shocking. Lawrence Manley observes that Swift satirizes the very relativism of the 8 Naturalistic morality permits sentences containing the term 'ought' to be translated, without logical remainder, into ordinary indicative sentences or else to be derived from such sentences.

D. NUTTALL 57 travel writers when he shows that the apparent differences between civiliza- tions are in fact real differences, 'so that the Lilliputian disgust with Gulliver and Gulliver's disgust with the Brobdingnagians are a function of their real degree of magnitude and magnanimity'.1' When we come to the rational horses this strategy undergoes a further, brilliant, transformation. For the unnaturally sagacious horses are themselves (in what anyone but the almost cultureless Gulliver will perceive to be a Stoic mode) followers ofNature: their own morality can be construed as thoroughly species-based, and at this level it simply mirrors the species-based presumptions of human beings. Thus far, Swift has shown us a novel figure in the dance of cultural relativism. If this were all, the Houyhnhnms would be subject to the same satiric scourge as mankind, in a precisely parallel manner. But in Houyhnhnm society we are gradually made to suspect that, after all, no fissure can ever be made to appear (as it can in our world) between the species-based and the absolute ethic. Their species really is superior. It follows that in their more or less Stoic philosophy reason will be in accord with this condition of nature and will in consequence exhibit no problems: 'Their grand maxim is, to cultivate Reason, and to be wholly governed by it. Neither is Reason among them a Point problematical as with us, where Men can argue with Plausibility on both Sides of a Question' (IV. 8 (p. 267)). Thus, while human Stoics were constantly exercised by the transition from descript to prescript, no such difficulty arises for the Houyhnhnms. The Stoics affirmed that man was a rational animal and thereafter urged strenuously that he labour to become so. 'You are rational' was habitually followed not by 'Therefore relax' but by the (in the circumstances wholly irrational) 'There- fore subdue your passions'. We have moved, by implication, from 'You are rational' to 'You are, properly, rational', or 'You are basically/originally/at your best rational'. But the Houyhnhnms, unlike the ancient human Stoics, have no vast body of literature on the subjection of passion because they actually are as they say they are (there is indeed a mild inconsistency in Swift's having them continually dwelling in their poems on instances of benevolence (Iv. 9 (p. 274)), since there can be no reason to praise that which is merely given by nature). The Stoic conception of man, it might be said, is noble and therefore the opposite of misanthropic. But because Stoics were in practice everywhere assailed by the rampant irrationality of real human beings, misanthropy seems to have come easily to them: 'One is sometimes seized', says Seneca, 'with hatred of the whole human race."' It is as ifthe old Pindaric tag, 'Become what you are' (Pythian Odes, II. 72) came, with the rise of Stoicism, increasingly to express a state of disquieting tension. Indeed this slippage to the Stoic perception ofhuman nature almost becomes a synchronic equivalent of the Christian conception of the fall of man. 10 Convention, 1500oo-1750 (Cambridge, Massachusetts, 1980), p. 330. 11 De Tranquillitate Animi, Moral Essays, edited with an English translation by J.

R. S. Crane was the first to point out that men and horses provide the running example of rationality and its converse in the treatises of Franco Burgersdijck, Narcissus Marsh (Swift's despised 'Pri- mate Marsh'), and others.12 Indeed the connexion with Gulliver's Travels may be more intricate even than Crane saw. Narcissus Marsh, in his manual designed 'for the use of the young academicians of Dublin', has a way of generating (per accidens) distinctions and paradoxes which can appear essentially Swiftian.13 One of the simpler comic mechanisms in Gulliver's Travels works through the ambiguity of 'animal' in English. Because we commonly use this word to mean 'non-human' or 'beast' the phrase 'Man is a rational animal' carries a whiff of paradox from the start. But the Latin animal has the same ambiguity, and Marsh, in his plodding progress, makes sure that we are aware of the fact. In the very preface of his book he offers the following syllogism: Nullum animal est homo. Omne rationale est homo. Ergo Nullum rationale est animal. No animal is a man. Every rational being is a man. Therefore, no rational being is an animal. (Protheoria Syllogistica, Q.6) After which (still in the 'Preface') horses and apes come crowding in (it will be said that there are no apes in the fourth book of Gulliver's Travels, but it is hard to avoid the sense that the Yahoos are, in a way which Swift cannot acknowledge, partly based on a simian original). Si Simia non sit irrationalis, est homo Sed Simia no est homo. Ergo, Est irrationalis. If an ape be not irrational, it is a man. But an ape is not a man. Therefore it is irrational. (Q.8) All of this of course is also sober sense, though when we come to the section on the Individual we may wonder a little at Marsh's obvious partiality for horses: [Individuum incertum] exprimitur per Nomen commune et Pronomen particulare: ut, Aliquis homo. Quidam equus. We express the indeterminate individual by means of the common noun and the particularising pronoun, Some man. A certain horse. (pp. 9-o)14 12 Crane, 'The Houyhnhnms, the Yahoos and the History of Ideas'. See also C. T. Probyn, 'Swift and the Human Predicament', in The Art of Jonathan Swift, edited by C. T. Probyn (London 1978), pp. 57-80. 13 Institutiones Logicae in usum juventatis Academicae Dublinensis (Dublin, I 68 ). 14 Aliquis and quidam in Latin, unlike 'a certain' in English, can figure as pronouns.</page><page sequence="9">A. D. NUTTALL 59 But it is when we come to the examples of bad syllogisms that we really strike pay-dirt. On page 144 he offers the wholly witless: Nullus homo est brutum. Nullus equus est homo. Ergo, Nullus equus est brutum No man is a brute. No horse is a man. Therefore no horse is a brute.) On pages 149 and 153 we have the following standard Undistributed Middles: Omne brutum est animal, Omnis homo est animal. Ergo, Omnis brutum est homo. Every brute is an animal. Every man is an animal. Therefore, every brute is a man. Omnis homo est animal Omnis equus est animal. Ergo, Omnis equus est homo. Every man is an animal. Every horse is an animal. Therefore every horse is a man. And so the rattling mechanism of Marsh's pedagogy goes on its way. On page 167 the eye is caught by Homo est brutum, 'Man is a brute' and a page later by Homo est Bucephelus, 'Bucephelus [Alexander's famous horse] is a man'. There can be no doubt that all this had its effect on Swift. When he wrote his parodic syllogism on the Aeolists in A Tale ofa Tub he followed the typographic habit of Marsh, italicizing the terms but leaving 'Ergo' in Roman: 'Words are but Wind; and Learning is nothing but words; Ergo Learning is nothing but wind.15 It is easy to see in what spirit the young Swift would have read the Institutiones Logicae, making it a point of honour to believe the syllogisms laboriously offered as errors by his master and to disbelieve the rest. All this, note, was long before Locke attacked Stillingfleet's views on the nature of man. On this side we have clever undergraduate humour; on that, springing from and then freezing the game, a queerly absolute judgement a priori, a judgement fenced with every sort of irony yet inescapably asserted. So far I have argued in terms of commonplaces of the age: reason, temperance, benevolence, and nature provide the framework. But if the effect of this is, as it were, to flatten Swift, to merge him with his background, then once again one is probably going wrong. For Swift's brand of mis- anthropy (and I mean Swift's, not Gulliver's) has its own note of hysteria, its own special extremism. Setting aside the precise medical character of Swift's final illness, we may still be struck with the way contemporaries and near- contemporaries of Swift doubted his sanity while admiring his intellect. I 15 Edited by A. C. Guthkelch and D. Nichol Smith (Oxford, 1958), p. 153.</page><page sequence="10">60 Gulliver among the Horses will say nothing here of the obsession with excrement. Suppose instead that we add to the materials assembled by Carnochan and others the following passage from Swift's 'Letter to a Young Lady on her Marriage' (1723): 'Besides, yours was a Match of Prudence, and common Good-liking, without any Mixture of that ridiculous Passion which hath no Being, but in Play- Books and Romances' (Works, IX, 89). This corresponds with the dis- passionately eugenic marriages of the Houyhnhnms so much admired by Gulliver (Iv. 8 (p. 268)), and yet once more it is Swift, not Gulliver, who is speaking. I have, however, another reason for singling out this passage. It is marked by a special tremor of the intellect which perhaps betrays much. For Swift congratulates Deborah Staunton on the absence of something which (he says it himself) does not exist outside the pages of books. We may seek to expunge the absurdity by saying that Swift obviously means to congratulate the young lady on being free of the delusion of supposing herself in love, since love outside playbooks and romances is always a mere tissue of illusions. But this rescue operation is not altogether comfortable or convincing; a sufficiently vivid delusion of being in love might surely constitute real 'passion'; it is, after all, passion that Swift hates and it is surely wonderful if humankind is wholly free of it, so that it lingers only in works of fiction. The almost unbearable, icy, patronizing blandness of this letter, with its deliberately-unlovable combination of stylistic majesty with personal intimacy is, at this point, disturbed by something which even Swift, perhaps, did not fully understand. It seems to be fear which, for the length of a sentence, here outruns the intelligence. The same fear shows in the 'Resolutions when I come to be Old' which Swift set down more than twenty years before he began to write Gulliver's Travels: 'Not to marry a young Woman.... Not to be fond of Children, or let them come near me hardly' (Works, I, xxxvii). Johnson in his 'Life of Swift' makes his distaste for Swift's inhuman and obsessive rationality very clear. He is horrified by the way Swift lent to the poor, fixing a date for repayment and suing defaulters.16 He describes Swift's private rule of giving one coin at a time when tipping and of always storing 'his pocket with coins of different value' (p. 58). Johnson's celebrated observation of Swift's 'inverted hypocrisy' is offered not in admiration but with some dismay (p. 54). Already one smells what the twentieth century has learned to call schizophrenia. The impression grows stronger when Johnson allows himself a freer rein with anecdotes of personal eccentricity, such as Pope's wonderful account of the occasion when he and Gay called on Swift: Swift asked if they had eaten and, on learning that they had, became very agitated by the thought that he would otherwise have had to give them lobsters, tarts, and a bottle of wine, at a cost of 2s. 6d. each; he was unable to rest until he had persuaded each of them to accept half-a-crown (pp. 58-59). 16 Lives of the English Poets, edited by George Birkbeck Hill, 3 vols (Oxford, i905), 111, 57.</page><page sequence="11">A. D. NUTTALL 61 I suspect that Johnson's obvious hostility springs in part from his recogni- tion of obsessional tendencies within himself; certainly he dealt with them very differently. His pausing to tell us how Swift continually washed his face forms part of the same general picture (p. 55). It is as if Johnson can more easily forgive Kit Smart for not changing his shirt than he can forgive Swift for his cleanliness,17 Meanwhile, however, one cannot feel that Johnson's anxieties are wholly misplaced. The Portuguese sea captain is the strongest evidence in the fourth book for Swift's essential sanity, or so we are told. He is manifestly generous and Gulliver, conversely, is manifestly unbalanced in his response to that generosity. When I considered the behaviour of Gulliver on being reunited with his wife and family, I insisted on listening to the voice which said 'And the heart of the jest is that Gulliver is right, because human beings stink and horses are better than men'. Against all the odds (which is exactly how Swift loved to write) the same voice may even be heard here, if we care to listen. R. S. Crane got it right when he said that if Swift was to convey the full force of his indictment and shock the reader from his or her anthropocentric complacency it was necessary to include in the now-extended ranks of the Yahoos a person who would seem to most of us, in our innocent arrogance, virtuous and admirable. Or, as John Traugott put it more succinctly, 'Even good Yahoos are Yahoos'.s8 Your ordinary racist hates Jews because he believes that they poison wells or (in more recent times) destroy the economy. Your fundamental racist hates Jews because they are Jews and for no other reason. Among friends he will take pleasure in affirming that a good Jew is still a Jew, since in this way he can isolate the element of pure contempt. So with Swift. There is a part of his mind which has attained (so to speak) pure misanthropy, untainted by ordinary human reasons. This then obliges him to bring Gulliver face to face with the best of human kind - and then have his hero shrink in disgust. Of course he knows that the reader will laugh at the folly of Gulliver, but that is now an essential part of Swift's increasingly private joke. For what is the reader but another Yahoo? In the last resort Yahoos will stick together. Even now the joke is not quite over, for what is Swift himself? If this really is the inner logic of the Don Pedro episode then it must be said that it carries a hint of insanity. If a Yahoo cannot be admired for his decent benevolence, then neither can a Houyhnhnm. Non-species-based (absolute) morality allowed Swift to accuse mankind as a whole of cruelty, mendacity, and pride. In this way he could establish a misanthropic base. Then the system gives a shake and, lo, we are presented with an inverse species-based morality. Instead of 'even a bad man is still a fellow human being' we have 17 See Boswell, Life ofJohnson, edited by George Birkbeck Hill, 6vols (Oxford, 1887), I, 397 (24 May 1763). is Crane, 'The Houyhnhnms, The Yahoos and the History of Ideas', p. 35; Traugott, 'A Voyage to Nowhere', p. 562.</page><page sequence="12">62 Gulliver among the Horses 'even a good man is still, ugh!, a man'. It may be thought that in contriving this mirror effect Swift's design was to satirize further the species-based morality which he earlier threw off, but this is one subtlety which I believe we must deny him. The writing is took dark and hot, the links with words uttered in propria persona are of the wrong kind. When Gulliver catches sight of his face in a pool (Iv. Io (p. 278)) his reaction is the opposite of Narcissus's in the myth. Gulliver hates what he sees. In Ovid (Metamorphoses, III. 339-51 o) Narcissus is an innocent and lives in the childhood of what is to become our own world. He has never seen his face before and as soon as he sees it he loves it. Indeed, even the shaggy Cyclops likes his face when he first sees it reflected (Metamorphoses, xIi. 842-43). Gulliver, who saw his face many times in the world of men, finds himself translated to a counter-world in which innocence and truth are in a manner recoverable. Once again his reaction can be seen comoedically as part of the relativist game (what is fair here is foul there and vice versa). But at another level (and that the more important) it is as if the effect of his sojourn among the horses is to make the scales fall from his eyes. He can now see truly, but, although he has somehow strayed into Arcadia, what he sees is corruption. In emphasizing an element of authentically Swiftian misanthropy I have perhaps privileged the tormented ego of the author above his more liberal and fee-ranging imagination. Another way to express the antithesis is to say that the book is an altogether richer thing than its proudly invidious thesis. There is a sense in which simple imaginative postulates, such as 'Let us imagine people six inches high', can generate an increasingly rich variety of situations, almost of themselves. 'Let the horses be rational and the men brutes' is such a postulate. Admit to the scheme a rational man and the possibilities are richer still. Ancient structures of the imagination, ideal Commonwealths, Utopias, transposed pastorals, Paradises penetrated and overthrown begin to figure in the picture. It is as if a monomaniac central impulse is made to work within a polymaniac field of reference. I have resisted the notion that the coldness of the horses implicitly condemns them. If, however, we substitute 'negative' or even 'stupid' for 'cold' the case is somewhat altered. The horses live by reason but they have no skill or facility in ratiocination. They are sages who never philosophize. The most frequent locution applied to them is that beginning 'They have no conception of. . .': 'Power, Government, War, Law, Punishment, and a Thousand other Things had no Terms, wherein that Language could express them' (Iv. 4 (p. 244)); 'The Inhabitants have not the least Idea of Books or Literature' (Iv. 3 (p. 235)); 'they have no Word in their Language to express Lying or Falshood' (Iv. 3 (p. 235)); 'when I asserted that the Yahoos were the only governing Animals in my Country... my Master said [it] was altogether past his Conception' (Iv. 4 (p. 240)). In addition they have no conception of the use of money (Iv. 6 (p. 25) ) or of what a ship is</page><page sequence="13">A. D. NUTTALL 63 (Iv. 3 (p. 235)), only an imperfect conception of illness (iv. 6 (p. 253) ), and no conception, of course, of the various vices described by Gulliver (iv. 4 (p. 244) ); love has 'no Place in their Thoughts' (Iv. 8 (p. 269) ), and the Sorrel Nag 'had no Conception of any Country beside his own' (Iv. io (p. 281)). This is in part an effect of genre. 'They have no word for "lie"' is a recurrent topos of travel literature and early anthropology. But in Swift the topos is immensely extended, and all the odder, it might seem, when we are dealing with paragons of rationality. More importantly we need to remem- ber how rationality is treated by Stoic thinkers. The basic generative sentence of Gulliver's Travels, Part Iv, 'Man is a rational animal', is not, as is commonly supposed, an Aristotelian commonplace, but is largely the property of the Stoics. 'Man is a political animal', on the other hand, is the key sentence of Shakespeare's Timon ofAthens and is a genuinely Aristotelian tag.19 Aristotle is certainly keenly interested in man as an animal capable of acquiring knowledge, but this, as I shall argue, is too dynamic a conception for either the Stoics or Swift.20 Similarly, Aristotle is willing to describe man as the only animal capable of deliberation.21 The nearest he comes to the stock phrase of the logic books is perhaps in the Politics when he says (at 1332 b 3) that the rational principle is not found in brute animals. The central phrase, 'rational animal' (zoon logikon) occurs as far as I can discover only once, and in a most dubious manner. In a fragment of Aristotle which we owe to the Pythagorean Platonist lamblichus (fourth century A.D.) we are told that among the secret doctrines of the Pythagoreans was one which ran, 'There are three kinds of rational animal: gods, men and beings like Pythagoras'.22 It is hard to be sure, but it looks very like a joke. With the Stoics the phrase comes into its own. Chrysippus leads the way, using it in a work revealingly entitled On the Failure to Lead a Consistent Life.23 It is clear that Aristotle is interested in activity, in the things human beings do with their intelligence. What the Stoics are interested in is, despite the rhetorical ordonnance of the Senecan style, rather less perspicuous. Important in the scheme is a notional fusion of 'follow nature' with 'follow reason'. It is commonly said that in the technical philosophy of the seventeenth and eighteenth centuries reason is increasingly restricted to the deductive faculty, with a corresponding shift away from the traditional cognitive conception (reason as a just perception and moral appraisal of what is really the case). 'The traditional conception' appears to owe far more 19 In referring to Aristotle I use the standard Bekker numbers.

A powerful moral stress on cognitive reason can lead to the terminal notion of an inert conformity with nature (where 'nature' means not 'the green world' but That Which Is, considered as a divinely ordered whole). Seneca, in his Moral Epistle 'On the God within Us', explains the matter with an almost Chadbandian vacuousness: Praise in him that which can neither be torn from him nor given to him, that which is the Property of Man. You ask, what may that be? It is soul, and reason perfected in the Soul. For man is a rational animal. And so the highest good is accomplished if he has filled the role for which he was born. And what is it that is demanded from him by this 'reason' of which I speak? The easiest thing of all, to live in accord with his own nature.24 There, to be sure, he ends, trapped in a subjective circle: 'Your nature is rational, what is reason? This life in accordance with your own nature; what is your own nature? Why, to be rational.' Elsewhere the circle is broken and he says, simply, 'Follow nature', the practice being firmly associated with the possession of a sane unclouded mind.25 The Stoic assimilation of reason to both internal and external nature is accomplished through a covert act of prescription. Man's real nature is rational (the 'honorific' use of real). The prescriptive identification was followed by the usual long rebellion of the defacto against the dejure. When the Stoics affirmed the rationality of following nature they intended 'nature' in the sense opposed to 'convention' (physis/nomos): 'Scorn luxury and wild opinion, attend to what is truly noble.' But even in antiquity natue was also opposed by art, and it is this second opposition which lies behind all pastoral writing and will ultimately yield the 'green' nature of Romanticism. Mean- while, what is the opposite of reason? In stoicism it is passion. But by the pastoral opposition it is the passions which seem most obviously natural, while reason belongs with art (we may remember at this point that nomos, which is the Greek for 'convention', also means 'law'). We may now be in a better position to understand the Houyhnhnms. Their minds and values, being perfectly adjusted to nature, need never stir from the consequent sleep: until, that is, they are visited by one whose rationality is of the dangerous, dynamic, ratiocinative kind. Until Gulliver occasioned the first debate in Houyhnhnms Land, these were sages who never once disputed any question. Is it not possible that Gulliver's sessions with his Master Horse are really (though Gulliver would be profoundly shocked at the description) strange tutorials in which Gulliver (not the Horse) is the teacher? The Yahoos are described as unteachable (iv. 8 (p. 266), 9 (P- 271) ) but if we look for the opposite character we shall find it, not in the incurious Houyhnhnms but in homo sapiens as described by 24 Epistulae Morales, 41.8-9, in Ad Lucilium Epistulae Morales, with an English translation by R. M. Gummere, Loeb Classical Library, 3 vols (London, 1917-25)1, 276-78. The translation is mine. 25 On the Happy Life, 3. 3, in Moral Essays, with an English translation by J. W.

The Master Horse is obviously quite unable to account for the malignity implicit in Gulliver's very cleverness; reason ought to be a point in his favour yet it seems to be working the other way. A little desperately he suggests that it is because man has been given only a 'pittance' of reason, which is somehow susceptible of misuse, that he goes wrong (iv. 7 (p. 259)), as if a larger ration of the same would somewhow have been all right. Gulliver's description of the ship is a nice specimen of Enlightenment 'defamiliarization': 'I came over the Sea, from a far Place, with many others of my own Kind, in a great hollow Vessel made of the Bodies of Trees' (Iv. 3 (p. 235)). He has learned to speak as if to a child. The Master Horse's response is touched with inadvertent pathos: 'He was sure no Houyhnhnm alive could make such a Vessel, or would trust Yahoos to manage it.' The truth is that the Houyhnhnms are just not very clever. Not only do they abstain from disputes, but they have no technology. When Gulliver makes two chairs, using his knife, the Sorrel Nag, for all his undoubted membership of the Master Race, is, comfortably and without comment, assigned the simpler and more laborious tasks (iv. 10 (p. 276) ). When, later, Gulliver goes Crusoe-like to work on his ingenious 'Canoo' the Sorrel Nag once more plays the part of Man Friday, performing 'the Parts that required most Labour' (IV. Io (p. 281)). The Stoics were driven to philosophize, to engage in pursuasive discourse, only because man was not in practice invariably rational in the way he was expected to be: the active rationality of Seneca, such as it is, can live and breathe only in the space afforded by the failure of that primal definition. But the horses really are thus and, as the gap is closed, we realize that we are indeed confronted by a species of rationality which has no tincture of the ratiocinative. Such rationality is indeed not so much the correct appraisal of nature as a mere identity with nature, a surrender of thought. We are very close to saying that Swift might, with greater consistency, have used perfectly ordinary well-adjusted horses, without entangling himself in the treacherous business of anthropomorphism; how could he think that he could dignify a noble horse by making him resemble the Yahoo Seneca? The presentiment that Part Iv might be, in some remote fashion, a transposed pastoral is not so wide of the mark. The pre-Argonautical Houyhnhnms, like the men of Virgil's Golden Age, know not the use of iron (Georgics, I. 143; Gulliver's Travels, Iv. 9 (p. 274) ).26 Their use of sledges (Iv. 2 (p. 23I), IV. 9 (P- 275)) suggests that they may not even have invented the wheel, though 'carriages' are mentioned at Iv. 9 (p. 274). Their world is indeed a green one. I have asked, in effect, when Gulliver converses with the Master Horse, which is the teacher, which the taught? There is an obvious sense in which Gulliver's pride in mechanical contrivance is exposed by the 26 See Margaret Anne Doody, 'Gulliver's Travels and Virgil's Georgics', in Augustan Studies and Essays in Honour of Irvin Ehrenpreis, edited by Douglas Lane Patey and Timothy Keegan (Newark, Delaware, London, and Toronto, 1985), 145-74, especially p. 17I.</page><page sequence="16">66 Gulliver among the Horses horse, but this also conforms to the pastoral pattern. Gulliver encounters not the authority of intellect but the authority of innocence. Spenser's Sir Calidore, who with all his civil courtesy brings change and death to a pastoral society, is similarly wrong-footed by innocent wisdom: he makes the mistake of offering money to the aged shepherd Melibee (Faerie Queene, Iv. 9. 32-33). One lesson, we find, the Master Horse is capable of learning; when Gulliver first explains how horses were castrated in his own country the Master is shocked, chiefly no doubt because the operation is performed on horses (Iv. 4 (pp. 241-42)). Later the Master proudly announces how it is possible to learn from the lower animals, and that rebellious Yahoos might be rendered more tractable by castration (Iv. 9 (pp. 272-73) ). This time it is we who are shocked, chiefly no doubt because the operation is to be performed on men. Like Milton's Satan, Gulliver brings with him dynamism and change, transforming the world of unfallen Stoics. He shows how any world in which the intelligence will function as a live thing will contain evil as well as good. Unlike Satan, however, he is no rebel but, had they only known it, their first and only perfect pupil. For Gulliver's abject submission was wholly un- feigned. He swallowed everyting, the Spartan (Hitler Youth) exercises, the pride of caste (like Nietzsche's archaic Greeks in The Genealogy ofMorals, who draw their terms of disapproval from synonyms of 'slave', the horses derive theirs variously from the word Yahoo), the moral platitudes, the equine Pindaric odes on athletic victories - the lot.27 But they decided he was a potential revolutionary and therefore expelled him (Iv. io (p. 279)). It may be said that they were wise, since Gulliver, whatever his intentions, carried the corrupting taint of the civilized Yahoo which would in due course have had its effect. At that level, however, it is likely that the subtle damage was already done. What the Houyhnhnms actually suggest is that Gulliver would have led the local Yahoos in revolt, and it is difficult to resist the conclusion that the Assembly, with its habitual stupidity, simply got it wrong. Gulliver himself, whose attitude to the Assembly is a little like that of George Herbert towards God, makes no complaint. There was one Houyhnhnm, however, who got it right. Near the end of the story Gulliver tells how he put out to sea in his makeshift boat, watched by the Master Horse and some friends. When he was almost out of sight, he says, 'I often heard the Sorrel Nag (who always loved me) crying out, Hnuy illa nyha maiah Yahoo, Take Care of thy self, gentle Yahoo' (Iv. i I (p. 283) ). Not 'seditious', notice, but 'gentle'. The parenthesis '(who always loved me)', after so many pages of rational benevolence and the perfunctory 'better feelings' of the Master (Iv. Io (p. 279)) has a sudden power. It is here rather than in the Don Pedro episode that the Swiftian fear of love is shaken. In the 27 The Genealogy of Morals, I. 4 and io, in The Birth of Tragedy and the Genealogy of Morals, translated by F. Golfing (New York, 1956), pp. 162, 171-72.</page><page sequence="17">A. D. NUTTALL 67 first ideal Commonwealth they expelled the poet. Swift himself with his breath-taking, ever-moving, intelligence would have been expelled from Houyhnhnms Land more rapidly, one surmises, than Gulliver. But to tell Swift this would be to tell him what he already knows, that he must include himself in his misanthropy. It is always unwise to patronize good writers, but it is especially unwise in the case of Swift. We must allow him to say what he must say, however it offends us. Like the tree with which Stoic Aeneas is compared by Virgil, his roots are in hell (Iv. 446). Even so, however, pious Aeneas is too high-minded a hero for our purpose. If Boswell is allowed to compare the mind of Dr Johnson to the Colosseum, perhaps we can say that the mind of Swift resembled the Augean Stable, remembering only that he was also his own Hercules, labouring within it.28 But, if we remember the word lacerare from Swift's epitaph in St Patrick's cathedral, we may think of him as not a Luciferan but an ascetic Prometheus, tormented on his rock, yet able still to torment posterity. 28 Boswell, Life ofJohnson, II, io6 (26 October 1769).</page></plain_text>
