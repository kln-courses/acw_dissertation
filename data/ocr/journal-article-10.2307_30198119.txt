ALWAYS, WE ARE EN ROUTE 4?9ddor HE GREAT airline planes of today are made possible by the application of scien- tific knowledge gained since the time when man first abandoned anthropomorphic and mythological explanations of physical phe- nomena. The airliner of today does not represent the ultimate in scientific progress, however, because science is a vital, con- stantly growing and self-perpetuating force. The airliner is the basis for even greater scientific growth in the future. The needs of air transportation have, in turn, given new impetus to science. Mechani- cal, civil, chemical and electrical engineering; astronomy, meteorology, metallurgy, navi- gation, radio and aerodynamics are some which have felt the stimulus of air trans- portation. Engineers and scientists are profoundly aware of the technological imphlications of aviation. There remains, however, an urgent need for us to acquire a better understanding of the effects which air transportation is having upon the individual and upon world society. It is imperative that educators assume the roles of pilots, to guide the minds of young and old to full awareness of the significance of air transportation. Every aspect of civilization is subject to revolutionary change becauseofthe airplane's ability to travel in any direction, at speeds previously impossible in transportation, uninhibited by earthly confines and configur- ations. Problems of sociology and political science, for example, once of municipal, state or national character, are becoming inter- national. Long-accepted concepts of time and distance are being revised radically, and some are being discarded. The task of interpreting the vast changes is the challenging duty of teachers and school administrators. To aid them, American Air- lines has established Air-Age Education Re- search. It is a clearing-house for ideas, methods and information. We invite your comment and suggestions. And, to help keep you informed, we offer a free copy of "Air Age Education News," upon request.

What counts most in determining the true worth of a teacher is her mental attitude. Does she want to do a fine job or doesn't she? Does she want to strengthen herself professionally or is she indifferent, quite satisfied to drift along with her present stock of ideas? Is she interested in her students as human beings? Is she concerned about their adjustment, their prob- lems, and their aptitudes and ever-ready to give them a needed lift? Or is she interested chiefly in quitting before the last bell has stopped ringing and in drawing the largest possible pay for the least possible effort? In a word: Is she an eager or a meager teacher? Meager teaching can't be changed to eager teaching by any stroke of magic. But the exposure of all the teachers in a given school system to the JOURNAL of EDUCATION frequently helps to effect the transformation. This is because, first of all, the Journal is readable and interesting. It treats education as a lively human experience, not a dreary journey through a desert strewn with dry bones. The little imp who whispers "This is professional reading, so it must be dull," slinks away in silence. But it is not sensational or frothy, this Journal. The fifty or more headed articles, editorials and news items in every issue are packed with information useful to every member of the teaching profession.
