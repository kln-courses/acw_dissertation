<plain_text><page sequence="1">Two Darwins: History versus Criticism MICHAEL T. GHISELIN University of California, Berkeley The question of "why there are so many Darwins" seems not to have been resolved, in spite of much new research. Historians continue to provide one set of interpretations, biologists another. My book The Triumph of the Darwinian Method attempted to present a case for one biologist's interpretation of how Darwin did his work.' The possibility that Darwin thought profoundly and on a vast scale seems to be becom- ing a virtual orthodoxy. Yet from discussions of my work, it would seem'that we need to communicate better. I am amazed, for example, to learn of my supposed claim that Darwin was the first to use the hypothetico-deductive method in biology; I only said that he was good at it and used it extensively. Perhaps our points of view differ so much that real understanding is not possible. Historians often dismiss the commentary of scientists on the history of their own subject as not really history at all. Supposedly there is a right way and a wrong way to research such matters. History is sup- posedly done by searching through archives, ferreting out influences and seeing how science interacts with society as a whole. It may be claimed that a scientist will have to bring his biased outlook into the picture, something that is assumed to be deleterious. This may be true, but there is another possibility. Much that scientists write about the past is not history; rather it is intended to be criticism. My own work on Darwin is a case in point. My goal has been to reveal what Darwin accomplished, thereby allowing us better to appreciate his work. One can hardly break the rules when one is not playing the game. On the other hand, the critic has to incorporate a certain amount of history in his research, so the difference is not an absolute one. Indeed, I myself was originally trained in a branch of history called 'comparative anatomy.' Ever since it has been one of my goals to turn intellectual history into something more like evolutionary biology, or perhaps it would be better to call it subsuming two fields under a more general one. 1.

GHISELIN The historical point of view implicit in my book on Darwin has been developed in certain subsequent publications.2 Up till the present I have hesitated to make the connection with comparative anatomy altogether explicit, although I have taken pains to point out some biological analogies. The traditional conception of comparative anatomy is such that one might look only for some kind of transfer between disciplines and search for historical continuities between antecedent and descen- dent entities. Yet the experience of modern comparative anatomists indicates that the search for mere resemblances leads to a static concep- tion of change. Both history and comparative anatomy have suffered from formalistic, static comparison. If we want to understand mollusks or malacologists, we need to think in terms of flesh-and-blood organisms interacting with material environments. However legitimate it may seem to say that a part is an anterior appendage, it makes all the difference in the world whether that part functions as wing, leg, or fin. Likewise, apart from the processes of thinking we derive no real understanding from similarities and differences among experiments and publications. As zoology is not the study of "types of organisms," so intellectual history is not the study of "ideas" through time. Ideas and archetypes, that is to say, must be dismissed as metaphysical delusions - vestiges of Platonism which cannot be reconciled with what happened in 1859. Scientists have brains that think, not minds that cavort with ideas. It makes little if any difference that one scientist's thought resembles another's if we cannot explain why. The real interest attaches to what scientists do with their hypotheses, their observations, and their discoveries. Of particular significance is the "mechanics of innovation," a topic that can be studied by using hypotheses like the Funktionswechsel of comparative anatomy.3 To this end it is particular- ly important that we view the documents in their vital contexts. The gauntlet has been cast down before me concerning an issue that might be treated as an illuminating test case.4 (And an amusing double entendre.) This is the alleged relationship between the two great Darwins, Charles and his grandfather Erasmus. Supposedly, traditional 2. Michael T.

That Charles Darwin appears to have derived this idea or that idea from his grandfather has been mentioned frequently in the literature, but without adequate sub- stantiation. We need to have a painstaking, critical evaluation of the documents. But before undertaking such a task, let us first consider some basic premises. In particular, just what is meant when we say that one scientist influences another? Clearly, it can mean all sorts of things. (1) The tranfer of hypotheses occurs when scientist A invents a hypo- thesis, and scientist B applies it, perhaps to new problems. There seems to be no question that much of Darwin's geology was thus influenced by that of Lyell. (2) In transfer with a difference, scientist A's hypo- thesis is adopted by scientist B, who, however, alters it in some signifi- cant way. Kepler's ellipses improved over Copernicus's circles, and in this, but not in the heliocentric theory itself, Kepler was original. (3) Heuristical transfer happens when scientist A devises a theory, and sientist B uses A's hypothesis as a "model" that helps him to create his own hypothesis for a different problem. I have attempted to show that a lot of Darwin's thought was thus "modeled" on his own earlier work, and there is a considerable literature on such "themata."5 Nobody seems able to relate this kind of transfer to conventional notions of originality. (4) In incorporation, scientist B makes scientist A's facts or hypotheses serve as elements in his own work. Thus Darwin's theories of evolution in The Origin of Species and elsewhere have been retained in large measure as integral parts of the modern Synthetic Theory, and both are considered original. (5) Common interest would mean that scientist A's work is studied by scientist B because they are interested in the same phenomena. There might be none of the aforementioned interactions. Or scientist B might be stimulated in any of a variety of ways. He might find the research topics interesting and undertake his own studies on the same topic. An important case of this sort of relationship would be a negative reaction, stimulating scientist B to develop a different hypothesis. Given so many possibilities, we cannot just adduce a few resemblan- ces between the works of two scientists, or note an occasional expres- sion of interest in marginalia, to give a meaningful account of any such interaction. One has to find out what both scientists actually meant, 5. Gerald Holton, Thematic Origins of Scientific Thought: Kepler to Einstein (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1973). 123</page><page sequence="4">MICHAEL T. GHISELIN and what both actually did with the facts and hypotheses in question. Our difficulties are increased by the fact that relationships of in- fluence and stimulus may be indirect. Both Darwins read extensively and were more or less familiar with the whole range of available bio- logical knowledge. It is only to be expected that two evolutionists would draw on the same range of sources and materials. Many topics interesting to both - plant sexuality, for example - were repeatedly discussed in the works of other authors. Furthermore, much of Charles Darwin's knowledge, especially early in his intellectual development, was derived from secondary sources. He could hardly have failed to learn a great deal from such authors as Paley, for example. No doubt the younger Darwin derived a great deal of general knowledge from conversations and correspondence. The publications of Charles Darwin relate curiously little about his grandfather's possible influence on his own work. In the "Historical Sketch" appended to later editions of The Origin of Species he only remarks on how Erasmus Darwin had anticipated Lamarck. The Varia- tion of Aninmls and Plants under Domestication merely quotes a passage on artificial selection. Otherwise, even with respect to emotio- nal expression, plant behavior, pollination biology, and other matters of substantial common interest, we find nothing. Even Charles Darwin's biography of Erasmus Darwin mainly sticks to nonscientific matters; the reader is referred to the essay by Krause in the same volume.7 Before jumping to conclusions about Charles Darwin's candidness in such matters, we ought to consider how the two evolutionists differed in their intellectual styles. Erasmus Darwin typifies the Enlightenment panlogist. His interests ranged over the whole of natural philosophy, and he traded, to no small degree, depth for breadth. His contributions to knowledge were significant, but they were not the result of profound understanding, and they were scattered about in various branches of learning. He did attempt to synthesize, but he did so without much detailed understanding gained at first hand. Although his theorizing related to experience, it tended to be ad hoc and, some might say, far too speculative. Only in medical physiology does he impress one as rigorously experiential and possessed of detailed factual knowledge. He was, after all, considered the greatest physician in England. Charles Darwin, on the other hand, supported his theoretical syn- 6. Charles Darwin, The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication, 2nd ed. (London: John Murray, 1875), II, 189. 7.

He backed up his views with extensive compilations from the literature and numerous experi- mental and comparative studies of his own. Inevitably he had to con- fine himself to a narrower range of work, but it was more profound and more accurate. To Charles Darwin, hypotheses had to be tested, not just rendered plausible. In this light it is easy to understand why he says that while a medical student at Edinburgh he "admired greatly the 'Zoonomia'; but on reading it a second time after an interval of ten or fifteen years, I was much disappointed; the proportion of speculation being so large to the facts given."8 He expressed contempt for Lamarck and Herbert Spencer for much the same reason. We do have clear and uncontrovertible evidence that Charles Darwin read his grandfather's works with considerable interest. Exactly when, and how many times, he read them is hard to say, and this uncertainty creates some difficulties when one attempts to interpret the marginalia. The above quotation shows that he had read Zoonomia both before and after the Beagle voyage, and his list of books read gives the date May 26, 1839, for the first volume; but the first notebook on species transmutation begins with a reference to it.9 This notebook was begun in July of 1837. Phytologia was read on April 20, 1840. A piece of paper in the back of Darwin's copy of this work is watermarked "1856." In the front of The Botanic Garden is written "Charles Darwin, 1826." 1826 - 1809 = 17. In the back of it is an abstract dated December 1857. Some of the annotations probably date from the period in which Charles Darwin was working on the biographical essay about Erasmus Darwin. The cautionary implications should be more or less self-evident. However, the following discussion, taken in conceptual rather than chronological order, is not affected by the dates of annota- tions. Charles Darwin's copy of Zoonomia; or, the Laws of Organic Life originally belonged to his father, Robert Waring Darwin, an eminent physician.10 It is a first edition (1794 and 1796), a point of some interest because the third edition therefore seems less likely than Phyto- logia as a source for notions about pangenesis. The work itself, in prose, 8. Francis Darwin, The Life and Letters of Charles Darwin, Including an Auto- biographical Chapter (London: John Murray, 1887), I, 38. 9. Howard E. Gruber and Paul H.

GHISELIN develops a system of neurophysiology and neuropathology, followed by a natural system of diseases on Linnaean principles. In passing it touches upon a wide variety of scientific topics. Its author seeks to explain vital phenomena in terms of the action of nerves, muscles, and contractile fibrils. His psychological theory may be characterized as mechanistic associationism of the conventional sort. Charles Darwin's psychology, as it was presented especially in The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals, bears some resemblances to it, but mainly insofar as he shared the elder Darwin's associationism and sought to explain behavior in terms of neural and muscular organiza- tion. We do find a few remote suggestions of Charles Darwin's principle of "antithesis" in Zoonomia. "1 A passage on grief, which is marked, suggests direct action and associated habits: Now as the suffocating sensation, that produces respiration, is removed almost as soon as perceived, and does not recur again: this disagreeable irritation of the lacrymal ducts, as it must frequently recur, till the tender organ becomes used to variety of odours, is one of the first pains that is repeatedly attended to: and hence through- out our infancy, and in many people throughout their lives, all dis- agreeable sensations are attended with snivelling at the nose, a profu- sion of tears, and some peculiar distortions of countenance: according to the laws of early association before mentioned, which constitutes the natural or universal language of grief.'2 However, Charles Darwin invokes a direct neural connection here, so that we can infer only a common interest. On the other hand, a number of minor passages related to emotional expression are marked and com- mented upon. It seems curious that Charles Darwin failed to mention his grandfather's work, if only as a historical curiosity. There are also quite a number of references to intelligence and habit, which interested both of them, even one on the closure of burrows by earthworms.'3 The section of Zoonomia entitled "Of Vegetable Animation" is rather heavily annotated, and has obvious connections with Charles Darwin's books on plant behavior, a topic that crops up in the early notebooks. Erasmus Darwin asserts that plants have contractile fibers, and discusses sleep movements, circular movement, and the transmission of stimuli. Charles Darwin had another explanation for plants' ability to move, and 11. Ibid., 1, 57, 58. 12. Ibid., p. 150. 13. Ibid., p. 182. 126</page><page sequence="7">Two Darwins: History versus Criticism treated what he called "circumnutation" as a kind of random search, not an indication of "voluntary powers."'14 Both Darwins considered whether plants have ideas.15 Erasmus Darwin maintained that they do have ideas, as well as sensation and the "passion of love." Charles Darwin ultimately developed an experimental approach to the problem of how plant habits evolve. Both discuss the role of experience and instinct. Again, however, no explicit reference to these areas of common interest occurs in Charles Darwin's works. But the two men came to quite different conclusions; at most we would therefore have only a stimulus, not an important source of fact or theory. A substantial portion of Zoonomia is devoted to generation, a topic explained in terms of what we might call a "self-assembly system." 16 The notion of organic particles putting themselves together is explicitly related to the views of Buffon. Development by epigenesis is readily extended to evolution. I shall elaborate upon how generation relates to pangenesis later on. Suffice it to say for the moment that Erasmus Darwin connected this kind of notion to his evolutionary mechanism, and that Charles Darwin in the annotations and elsewhere gives his grandfather full credit for having priority over Lamarck. Perhaps the best-known myth about Zoonomia is that it contains an exposition of sexual selection. The document in question does show an interest in combat between males and a clear understanding of the fact that the contest has something to do with mating. But the explanation is teleological, and to a selectionist all teleological explanations are false. Charles Darwin marked the following passage on page 503: "The final cause of this contest amongst the males seems to be, that the strongest and most active animal should propagate the species, which should thence become improved." In The Origin of Species he mentions this view, but here as elsewhere insists that sexual combat is a purpose- less, even harmful, result of evolution being caused by reproductive competition between members of the same species.'7 Very likely we have a connection here, but if so it was not the source of a hypothesis itself, but rather the stimulus that led to the development of an anti- thetical one. Erasmus Darwin's views on the "final cause of sex" itself are likewise 14. Ibid., p. 104 15. Ibid.. pp. 105-106. For a review of Charles Darwin's views see Michael T.

Charles Darwin refers to this hypothesis in his first species transmutation notebook, and repeats it in the first edition of his Naturalist's Voyage; yet in his book on 7he Effects of Cross and Self Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom he rejects it.19 What sex is "for" remains a controversial topic even today.20 Be this as it may, and in spite of a possible source for an early position, the two came to quite different views. Charles Darwin's copy of Phytologia; or, the Philosophy of Agricul- ture and Gardening bears his signature as well as that of his father. Published in 1801, it is a treatise on plant physiology, both theoretical and applied. It contains a discussion on the "individuality" of buds and other parts of plants. Erasmus Darwin's views on this are among the few that Charles Darwin singles out for approbation in his biography.21 The work abounds in far-fetched analogies between plants and animals - a traditional theme in biology ever since Aristotle. Lacteals are compared to roots, for example. Both Darwins attributed "brains" to plants, but in quite different senses, and with different justification. Erasmus Darwin claimed that the most elementary fibers have neural activity, and argued analogically. Charles Darwin supported his views on plant sensitivity and directed movements with experimental work of his own.22 He analogized the tips of roots and coleoptiles with "brains," but only insofar as these were the first rudiments of control mecha- nisms. Both also discuss insectivorous plants, but Erasmus Darwin merely conjectures that they catch insects to protect their nectar.23 His grandson carried out extensive research, and rightly supported Sprengel's hypothesis of symbiosis between the insects and the plants. To judge from Charles Darwin's efforts to see if similar chemicals affected the behavior of both plants and animals, he too was guided by analogy, but heristically only. The notion already mentioned of sex giving rise to variation also occurs in Phytologia24 In addition we find reference to the physio- logical advantages of crossing, which was Charles Darwin's position. But Erasmus Darwin's remarks were openly derivative, for he cites Koel- 18. Elrasmus Darwin, Zoonomia, 1, 519. 19. Ghiselin, Triumph, pp. 131-134. 20. Ghiselin, Economy of Nature. 21.

A somewhat more advanced form of self-assembly system is presented in Phytologia, for here the fibrils are thought to move into the repro- ductive organs. In spite of the fact that the appropriate passage is unmarked, it nonetheless seems a reasonable source for pangenesis.25 Soon after reading Phytologia Charles Darwin read Spallanzani and Buffon, to whom Erasmus Darwin refers.26 A disclaimer in The Varia- tion of Animals and Plants under Domestication and an exchange of letters with Huxley have created some false impressions in this connec- tion. Charles Darwin knew about his predecessors. But he was attempt- ing to account for a somewhat different group of phenomena. For him, use and disuse were minor evolutionary mechanisms, and he was attempting to explain such phenomena as atavism and latency. Here again, the derivative nature of Erasmus Darwin's views justified their not being cited. The discussion in Phytologia on double flowers seem to have interest- ed Charles Darwin for two reasons.27 For one thing, it provides an example of artificial selection; but such were abundant in the horti- cultural literature. Of greater significance, perhaps, was the fact that these can be stimulated to develop through the action of the environ- ment: by supplying extra nutriment. In a paper published in 1843, Charles Darwin discussed the induction of double flowers by poor nutritive conditions.28 He thought they were sterilized, and that matter was deflected to the petals, inducing excessive growth. Here the two Darwins had common interests and different views. The Botanic Garden is a two-volume work in verse and prose; Charles Darwin's copy is apparently a second edition.29 The first part, entitled The Economy of Vegetation, is a popular exposition of a wide range of scientific topics. In passing it treats matters that evoked comment by Charles Darwin: rudimentary structures explained historically, self- fertilization, and various topics related to floral biology. Much of the content of Phytologia is reiterated in this work. 25. Ibid, pp. 126-129. 26. Ibid., pp. 131, 119. 27. Ibid., pp. 531-532. 28.

GHISELIN The second part, entitled The loves of the Plants, presents the sexual classification system of Linnaeus in poetic form, with prose notes and interludes. The numerous annotations have to do mostly with pollina- tion and related topics. However, the evidence suggests little by way of "influence" beyond a concern for the same kinds of facts. Erasmus Darwin thought that plants fertilize themselves and did not understand the role of insects. Charles Darwin preferred to give credit to Christian Konrad Sprengel, and the annotations of Das entdekte Geheimniss der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen indicate that he read this work with great care and much interest.30 From his grandfather's mention of orchids, one might think that Charles Darwin received a little stimulus from this work, and such cannot be ruled out. On the other hand, what are we to say of a paper by Robert Brown entitled Observations on the Organs and Mode of Fecundation in Orchideae and Asclepiadidae? Charles Darwin's personal copy bears the following note: "Given to me by Mr. Brown on Friday December 9th. 183 1.,,31 This paper refers to Sprengel's work and the possible significance of insects in crossing. The last paragraph is worth quoting. "In conclusion, I venture to add, that in investigating the general problem of genera- tion, additional light is perhaps more likely to be derived from a further minute and patient exanmination of the structure and action of the sexual organs in Asclepiadeae and Orchideae, than from that of any other department either of the vegetable or animal kingdom."32 Here we have an alternative, or at least additional, stimulus in a personal relationship, and Charles Darwin in fact attributed his reading (sup- posedly in 1841) of Sprengel to the influence of Brown.33 He claims to have begun work on pollination ecology in 1839.34 The Temple of Nature was published in 1803.35 Charles Darwin's copy bears two sets of annotations without any obvious indication of their dates. The work itself is a popular exposition, in verse but with many prose notes, of an evolutionary history of life and the origin of mental faculties. The notion of evolutionary progress is discussed, and 30. Konrad Christian Sprengel, Das entdekte Geheimniss der Natur im Bau und in der Befruchtung der Blumen (Berlin: Viewig dem aeltern, 1793). 31.

These topics greatly interested Charles Darwin, who elaborated different views in The Descent of Man. But notebooks M and N show that he was familiar with the philosophical literature from a very early period, and it may be no coincidence that the views of Adam Smith, of Burke, and of Reid are discussed in The Temple of Nature. Canto IV, "Of Good and Evil," presents some ecological discussion that might be taken as adumbrating the "struggle for existence." The following passage, for example, is marked: Air, earth, and ocean, to astonish'd day, One scene of blood, one mighty toomb display! From Hunger's arm the shafts of death are hurl'd, And one great Slaughter-house the warring world!40 But eighteenth-century biologists were fully aware that one organism eats another. Such matters were quite peripheral to their general view of an ultimately providential Creation. At most we can make out a disposition toward more realistic appraisal of food chains. Mortality and extinction have to be recognized, but these qualify as "struggle for existence" only in a crude, misleading, and anthropomorphic sense. Perhaps the worst and most common misconception about natural selection is that it is another name for death. The crucial aspect of reproductive competition, determined by the availability of resources, does not appear in the writings of Erasmus Darwin. From the foregoing it seems clear that the relationship between Erasmus and Charles is not what some have made these two Darwins out to be. We do find that they both were evolutionists, and that both participated in the same intellectual tradition. But the picture that emerges is one of continuity with a difference. If we are to make sense 36. Ibid., p. 53. 37. Ibid., p. 57. 38. Ibid., p. 63. 39. Ibid., p. 68. 40. Ibid., p. 134. 131</page><page sequence="12">MICHAEL T. GHISELIN out of such relationships, we must do so in terms of the particular interactions that actually have occurred. At worst the annotations may be mistaken for the locus of activity. The mere possibility that a given source might have set off some reac- tion provides little in the way of demonstrative evidence. Scientists do not follow a single, well-marked path toward predetermined goals. They work with hints and riddles, the significance of which may not be apparent except to hindsight, and they take devious routes that abound in detours. The factual record of successive accomplishments provides answers to a different sort of question. Perhaps the marginalis are only of marginal utility.
