INTRODUCTION THE Fumariaceae, according to Hutchinson's analysis (16), which is here followed, should be treated as a family distinct from the Papaveraceae, and divisible into two sub-families, Fumarioideae and Hypecoideae. It is a familiar fact that the androecium of the Fumari- oideae consists of two opposite, laterally-placed phalanges, each with a central dithecal member, whose filament is fused, to a greater or less 1 For the titles of the preceding papers in this series, which forms part of the work carried out with the aid of a grant from the Dixon Fund of the University of London, see References (4) and (5), p. 353.

The interpretation of this curious diadelphous arrangement has been a matter of dispute among botanists for fully a hundred years. In the present paper an attempt is made to evaluate the evidence for the contending theories, on the basis of a study of serial microtome sections of the flowers of certain representatives of the tribe; the peculiar anatomy of the stamen-spur is also considered. Incidentally, the vascular relations of the apex of the inflorescence axis, and various minor points in the morphology of the flower, have been studied. I am indebted for material and for other help to the Director and to the Keeper of the Herbarium, the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew; to the Director and to the Superintendent, the Cambridge Botanic Garden; and to Mr S. A. Skan, Dr T. A. Sprague and Mr W. T. Stearn. I hope to deal with the Hypecoideae in a later article. In the first part of this paper the floral structure of certain species belonging to Corydalis, Fumaria and Dicentra is described and figured (pp. 3I9-38); in the second part, the observations recorded are compared and discussed (pp. 338-52). 2. DESCRIPTION Throughout the following descriptions I use the terms "lateral" stamen for the central, dithecal member of each phalange, and "median" stamens for the monothecal members which flank the dithecal stamens. These terms are non-committal, since they relate simply to the position in the flower occupied by the bases of the filaments. (i) Corydalis nobilis Pers. In order to understand the anatomical relations of the parts of the flower in Corydalis nobilis, I have traced the history of the bundles up from the pedicel. Fig. I, p. 3I8, illustrates this history in the case of two flowers; I found the scheme to be essentially identical in both. There are four bundles in the pedicel (A, B, C, D, in Fig. i, Bi and C1, p. 3I8); B2 shows the part which these four bundles play in supplying the members of the first flower. The sepals, of which there are only two, in the antero-posterior plane, and the median petals, are served by branches of B and D; the spurred lateral petal, by A; and the non-spurred lateral petal, by C. On the spurred side of the flower, the central dithecal member and the lateral monothecal members of the stamen phalange all derive their vascular tissue from bundle A of the pedicel. But on the non-spurred side the position is 22-2</page><page sequence="4">320 AGNES ARBER quite different. The three members of the phalange derive their vascular tissue from three different pedicel bundles-B, C and D (see Figs. i, C., and C12, and the diagram, Fig. i, A). In Figs. B1 and B2, the bundle relations have to be taken on trust, since the inter- vening stages are not shown, but in another series (C1-C.2), which has been drawn on a smaller scale from a second flower, the bundles can be traced from pedicel to anthers. Fig. C1 shows the four bundles, A, B, C, D, in the flower-base, while on the left side is seen the base of the petal-spur with its bundle cut horizontally, as it crosses over before turning up on the distal side. In Fig. C2, the downward flaps of the two sepals come into view, and the petal-spur (within which the stamen-spur is enclosed) now shows its bundle cut twice-in its down- ward and upward course. In Fig. C3 the stamen-spur also shows both the downward and upward limbs of the bundle of the lateral stamen. In Fig. C4, the central bundle of A has divided into three, and the laterals of the trio have become petal laterals. The central member of the trio divides into two radially-the outer half becoming the median bundle of the spurred petal. It dips down into the spur, and turns up again on the distal side. In Fig. C5 it is cut three times-in its upward passage in the receptacle, and in its downward and upward passages in the spur. In Fig. C6 it is cut twice only, as this is just the level at which it passes out horizontally from the receptacle. The two median stamens, whose filaments will fuse with the spurred lateral stamen, are supplied by bundles which have also arisen from A. The midribs of the back and front petals also arise from A, while in the first flower they arose from B and D. On the side of the flower opposite to the spur, the history is markedly different; the bundle C does much less than A, for branches of B and D (bundles which are also respon- sible for the sepals) supply the two median stamens to the right. In C6 there is a slight nodal plexus, too embryonic to be shown in the diagram, and in C7 four gynaeceum bundles have arisen from this plexus; it is thus impossible to identify them individually with any of the pedicel bundles A-D. The gynaeceum bundles in Fig. B2 take their origin from a similar plexus. The general scheme of the flower can be understood from Fig. C10, in which the fused filaments form petal-like plates to right and left. Fig. C12 shows the two complete lateral anthers, with the four monothecal anthers between them. In Fig. 2, p. 32I, the apex of an inflorescence of Corydalis nobilis is analysed; the five uppermost flowers are included. The section drawn in Fig. 2, D1, passes through the bracts and pedicels of flowers I and 2, while the strands for the three succeeding flowers can be</page><page sequence="5">On the Fumarioideae 321 Apex o aninflowescence oiCORYDALI1 NOQBLlSPers. hIact l strand lot llower6obmd ~ &gt; . ....................... - wbrand 3 strands'for flowe- - r4- sfrl4l, t,/lo @2o tea strand for b ) |rat 4tnd icel flowee--- r5 owere .Z Q, k\e. -omfld ondsot wert d O b 4 stiand forbtct WA .ia (0)2,lowetsl?2 0 aite) f bnactQ b and lfoldlesoiract,4 /~&lt; --- ss o / t WhJ Qv-SS LOwerS5 Dz.

The normal scheme, which is followed in flowers I-3, is that one bundle in the axis divides into three, the median segment supplying the bract, and the two lateral members forming a pair of bundles for the pedicel (in Corydalis there are no bracteoles). But flowers 4 and 5, which are close together at the tip of the raceme, receive also a small amount of supernumerary vascular tissue from the apex of the axis. Fig. ?, D,, shows the trifid bundles for flowers 4 and 5 (and their bracts) and two axis bundles. If flowers 4 and 5 had been lower in the raceme, they would have been supplied by the trifid bundles only. But at this level the position is complicated by the presence of the two axis strands, which have no destination since the axis terminates just above. One of these strands (to the left in D2 and D3) gives a branch to each of the pedicel systems and then dies out, while the second (to the right in D2 and D3) divides itself completely between the two pedicel systems. The result is that the apex of the axis, which is a minute cone of tissue-very small in proportion to the uppermost pedicels and their relatively massive bracts-is left wholly non-vascular. The process just described is not the only mode of termination of the raceme. In another case there were two bundles in the axis above the uppermost flower; the latter did not appear to have received any supernumerary strands. These two bundles died out, leaving the apex without vascular tissue. And in two other raceme-tips, I found that, above the highest flower, the entire shoot-apex was transformed into a bract. One of these apices is illustrated in Fig. I3, A1-A5, p. 34I. Here, above the uppermost pedicel and its axillant bract, the axis contained one lignified bundle, and a second non-lignified strand, which in passing up applied itself to the main bundle and then dis- appeared. These cases will be discussed later (pp. 338-342). It may be noticed in Fig. 2 that the very young gynaeceum of flower 4, though closed in the lower region (D4), is open above (D5). (ii) Corydalis bulbosa Reichb. Corydalis bulbosa resembles C. nobilis in the vascular relations of the young bract and pedicel with the axis. These relations will be understood from Figs. 3, A1-A6, p. 323, which also show the relatively massive bract; this bract is attached to the axis by its margins, so that the base of the pedicel is quite enclosed. As in C. nobilis, one bundle in the inflorescence axis (A]) divides into three (A2), the middle member of the trio supplying the bract, while the laterals are destined for the pedicel. The two pedicel bundles approach one another on the inner</page><page sequence="7">On the Fumarioideae 323 CORYDALIUS BULBO~A,Reichb. irillorescence axis bract i it foet below Wiat (?ollowed in Az-AD) 0 aglanls,9eitsbtact . ~ A paited bundlesi EeditLs wbecundle s n r X @'~~~'S ~~'RX ~)rat \uiA A..2, pedicee &gt;~~~.

At the level at which this branching takes place, horizontal elements pass round the external surface of the fused bundles. Such swathing elements, taking a direc- tion at right angles to that of the bundles, are commonly to be seen in regions of branching (cf. (5), Fig. 4, B1, p. i8o). Another strand is next given off between the two main bundles on the inner (adaxial) side, so that the pedicel now contains four bundles, lettered A, B, C, D, in Fig. 3, A,. The pedicel whose origin has just been followed is the fifth from the apex. As in C. nobilis, at the extreme tip of the inflorescence the vascular relations are somewhat modified; they can be followed in Fig. 5, p. 327. Fig. 5, B1, shows the apex of an in- florescence axis in which the usual two bundles for the pedicel and one for the bract are preparing to supply the uppermost flower. But the axis also contains three other bundles, which have no destination, since no more flowers are produced. In B2, one of these bundles is attaching itself to the pedicel vascular system. The second axis- bundle contributes a branch to the pedicel system, after which it dies out. The third bundle also dies out, so that in B3, in which the base of the pedicel has become free, it is enclosed in a ring of tissue with no bundles except those of the bract. The ring consists almost en- tirely of bract tissue, but on the side opposite the midrib of the bract, a small non-vascular region, whose limits are in no way defined, must represent the axis. For in B4, where the bract is freeing itself, the abortive axis becomes distinguishable, since it consists, at this level, of decadent tissue. In B. it has died out altogether. In another in- florescence apex I found that two bundles were left in the axis, after the differentiation of the pedicel bundles for the uppermost flower. These two bundles fused and died out, after each contributing a bundle to the pedicel system. In this case also, the actual stem apex consisted of a minute rudiment of decadent tissue. Having considered the vascular relation of pedicel and axis, it remains to follow the bundles from the pedicel into the flower, and for this we must return to Fig. 3, p. 323. Fig. 3, A6, shows the four bundles in the pedicel-A, B, C, D-preparing for division. In Fig. 3, A7, which is cut at a slightly higher level, the products of this division are shown in the receptacle, labelled according to their destinations. (Only certain diagrams have been selected from this series, so that the identity of these bundles is not actually demonstrated, but has to be taken on trust.) It will be noticed in Fig. 3, A7 that the four bundles for the median stamens are already individualised (except</page><page sequence="9">On the Fumarioideae 325 CORYDALIS BULBOSA,Eeichk .tedeanda a mediarkposteriorpet;[ inne4iari 4 \ *d i a r S \ o&lt;inar /a r\ tenor Spued lBterat vetal A u c\g g g A * A Ato.. _____ ~ ~ r L0*,, 0 o0 A- /-0 \ d \ \ , b ~s Ay ta A &lt;Starrmert "( mredian2l Atg5 (tJ __ n 'ta ens - nonspurr,d edva ,el 0 me \&gt; &lt; A =&lt; /X/stanate | gat5etal Av2, . -* Coydli buboa edichb. 1a~ otinuatio ofte Aeiesotas drwninFger,p stane ,l andi~ eAll inldXn,einpea ny n h differsta ent level.

It will be seen in Fig. 3, A8 that the three members of the stamen phalange on the non- spurred side are all supplied by bundle C, whereas on the other side the lateral stamen is supplied by A, but the median stamens are supplied respectively by (A + B) and D. The gynaeceum bundles shown in Fig. 3, A8, are unlignified, and at the level of their origin there is a slight plexus of horizontal strands, but three of them can nevertheless be traced to bundle C and one to bundle A. It will be observed that no sepals are represented in Fig. 3; in Corydalis bulbosa they are reduced to minute non-vascular rudiments which are shown from another flower in Fig. 5, p. 327. In Fig. 5, B6, the anterior, and in B7, the posterior sepal is shown; they occur at slightly different levels. The anterior sepal is drawn on a larger scale in B6a. In following Fig. 3, A8 and Ag, and Fig. 4, A1O-A12, it will be seen that there is a curious relation between the median petals, the spurred lateral petal, and the filament-band on the spurred side of the flower. Near the flower-base, the median petals are fused by their outer faces with the margins of the spurred petal exterior to them, and by their inner faces with the margins of the filament-band interior to them. But this fusion takes place, not at the edges of the median petals, but between the margin and midrib, with the result that part of the petal margin-nipped, as it were, between the two-protrudes into the lateral petal spur. The median petals are also fused, by their faces at a little distance from the margin, with the opposite filament- band, but the margins of the non-spurred petal become free before those of the spurred petal, so that on the non-spurred side of the flower the margin of the median petal is not separated from the main part of the petal as it is on the spurred side. This peculiar development of the median petals suggests that the early development of the flower takes place under pressure in the antero-posterior plane. The petal apices are not shown in this series of diagrams, but may be seen in Fig. 5, B8 and Bg, p. 327. Here the apical thickening of the median petals is indicated; they become mutually appressed, through slight meristematic activity in their sub-epidermal layers (Fig. Bg a). These figures (B8 and B9) again suggest a state of compression between the back and front of the flower. In Fig. 4, A12, the gynaeceum is cut in the ovule-bearing region. A13 passes through the ripe anthers.

Its structure is shown in Fig. 6, which represents a series from below upwards through a petal-spur enclosing the spur of the lateral stamen. Fig. 6, C1, shows the stamen-</page><page sequence="13">On the Fumarioideae 329 spur in the region in which it is free within the petal-spur. It has no xylem, but a relatively large phloem strand, kidney-shaped in section. In Fig. 6, C2, the region of attachment of stamen-spur to petal-spur is just reached, and a second smaller,phloem strand is now visible on the outer side of the stamen-spur. Succeeding sections show that these two phloem strands are connected with the down- ward and upward limbs of the stamen bundle. The xylem of the stamen bundle does not extend below C3. The bundle dips down into the spur to this level and then turns up again and ascends the distal side of the spur, until it passes into the filament of the central stamen of the phalange. Fig. 6, C3, represents the actual level at which the xylem of the downward and upward limbs are connected by a horizontal bridge which is shown in detail in C3 a. It will be noticed in C3 that the phloem of the downward limb is much more massive than that of the upward limb. (The central region consists of large elements unlike the rest, and it is possible that the true phloem is confined to the outer zone.) The peculiar vascular scheme in the lower region of the spur, seen in transverse section in C1-C3, may be described as a tongue of phloem descending into the distal region of the spur for about o 55 mm. (in this particular case) from the base of the downward limb of the stamen bundle, while-parallel with it-a slenderer and shorter tongue of phloem descends for about 0o23 mm. from the base of the upward limb of the stamen bundle. This arrangement will perhaps be best understood by reference to Fig. 8, B, p. 332, which represents diagrammatically the spur struc- ture of Fumaria officinalis. The spur in this species is similar to that of Corydalis bulbosa, except that no downward tongue of phloem is produced from the ufiward limb of the stamen bundle. (iii) Corydalis lutea (L.) DC. I am not giving a description of this species, since it is less favour- able for detailed study than the larger forms-C. nobilis and C. bulbosa-which it resembles in general structure. It does not show the four sharply defined bundles in the pedicel which make it possible, in the species already described, to trace the origin. of the vascular supply for each floral member with close exactness.

The delicate gynaeceum strands, first seen in 2A, appear to arise between the median stamen bundles and the bundles which will give rise to the lateral petal and lateral stamnea bundles.</page><page sequence="15">On the Fumarioideae 33I (iv) Fumaria officinalis L. The floral anatomy of Fumaria officinalis L. can be followed in the series from Fig. 8, A1, p. 332, in which the paired pedicel bundles are still in the axis, up to Fig. 9, A7, p. 334, in which all the parts of the flower are differentiated, though not yet completely separated. It is not worth while to illustrate or describe the general anatomical scheme in great detail, since it follows the same lines as in Corydalis; but there are certain special features to which I want to draw atten- tion, particularly the structure of the stamen-spur. Its general character will be best understood from the diagram, B, in Fig. 8, p. 332. The base of one stamen-the central member of one of the two lateral phalanges-is continued down as a spur enclosed in the petal-spur. For the greater part of its length it is fused with the petal- spur, but it is free in its distal region. The form of the free part of the spur is rather curious. Near the top it is more or less kidney-shaped in section, with the concave face turned towards the floral axis (Fig. 8, A3 and A3 a); lower down, the concavity increases, and the margins approach one another, finally fusing so that the section becomes ring-shaped (A2). Before the tip is reached, the central hollow disappears and the spur becomes solid (A1 a). A section of the upper part of the petal-spur shows the median bundle of the petal, and the stamen bundle, running parallel with one another on the proximal side of the spur (Fig. 8, A4). But careful examination of the stamen strand in this figure shows that it is not, as might be thought at first glance, the stamen bundle cut once, but that it is this bundle doubled on itself with the phloem outwards (Fig. 8, A4 a). The up- ward and downward limbs are in contact by their xylems through most of their length, and it is often impossible to assign every xylem element with certainty to one or other limb. The upward and down- ward limbs may thus be said to form a double bundle with one xylem and two phloem groups, the plane of symmetry of this double bundle being the east and west plane of the flower. In the diagram, B, Fig. 8, the xylems of the upward and downward limbs are, for clearness, represented as more distinct from one another than they actually are. The downward limb has the more massive phloem strand, while there is little phloem in the upward limb which will pass into the filament. The upward turn of the bundle takes place a little below the level at which the spur becomes free; the phloem alone of the downward limb has an extension into the spur nearly to its tip (cf. Fig. 8, A3, A3 a, A2, A1 a).

The phloem tongue is crescent-shaped in section in A2, in which the spur itself is ring- shaped, but in other flowers I have seen the phloem, also, closed in this region into a ring. The spur, which is papillose (Fig. 8, A1 a and A3 a) presumably excretes nectar through the walls of the hairs; I have not observed any stomates or secretory epithelium. The structure of the apical region of the inflorescence of Fumaria officinalis is of some interest for comparison with that of Corydalis. Fig. 9, B4, p. 334, shows the seven uppermost flowers of a raceme; the axillant bracts are a highly conspicuous feature, but, as in Corydalis, there are no bracteoles. The apex of the axis is a minute non-vascular cone. The three uppermost flowers are labelled I-3. The history of the apex up to the level of B4 is sketched in B1-B3. Fig. 9, B1, shows the pedicels and bracts of flowers i and 2, while the axis includes four main bundles with delicate connexions between them. These bundles are, respectively, the bract bundle for the uppermost flower; the two bundles, one on either side, which will supply the pedicel for that flower; and a fourth bundle which would, under ordinary conditions, continue its course in the axis and serve a later flower. But-in correlation with the fact that flower 3 is the uppermost flower of the raceme-the remaining axis bundle divides itself entirely between the two pedicel bundles for flower 3 (B2), So that the minute apex of the inflorescence axis is left non-vascular- the whole of the vascular tissue having passed into the bract and pedicel for flower 3. In the apex of another raceme, events took a somewhat different course. Here no trace of axial tissue was left over, above the uppermost bract and its axillary pedicel; this flower was thus terminal to the raceme (Fig. I3, B1 and B2, p. 34I). Dicentra spectabilis Lem. The relation of the vascular skeleton of the pedicel of Dicentra spectabilis to that of the axis from which it is derived is' shown in Fig. io, A1-A6, and B1, p. 335. Fig. io, A1, is a transverse section of an inflorescence axis, in which there are four principal bundles, lettered K, L, M, N. The bundle L divides into three branches (A2) of which the central one supplies the bract. Bundle K also divides, half of it fusing with one of the branches of L, and the bundle (K + L) thus formed becoming one of the bundles for the pedicel (and brac- teoles). The other bundle for the pedicel (and bracteoles) is formed from the third branch of L. These two vascular masses are seen in A3, occupying what will be the lateral plane of the flower; but in A6 PHYT.

This change of orientation between A3 and A6 is a remarkable one; we shall consider it on p. 340. Fig. io, B1, shows the pedicel of another flower above the detachment of the bract and bracteoles; it includes the main bundles which I have labelled A and B. There are also two minor bundles in the lateral plane, which both appear to arise from A, but of this I am not certain. Between the levels of B. and B2, one of these minor bundles attaches itself to one main bundle, while the other divides itself between the two main bundles. In B2, both A and B have divided as shown, and at a higher level the bundles connected by brackets unite. Each of the two lateral masses, thus produced, branches again to form a bundle trio, of which the central member will supply a lateral petal and lateral stamen, while the marginal members will enter the median stamens. In B3 this triad division is in process on the left side of the section, but is completed on the right. The bundles to north and south have given rise to the sepal and median petal strands. The history of the bundle trio to the right can be followed in detail in Fig. io, B3 a and Fig. ii, B3 b and B4 a, p. 337. The central member of the trio again divides into three (Fig. ii, B3 b) after which the median branch divides tangentially to supply the veins for the lateral petal, while the strands on either flank approach one another and fuse on the inner side of the petal bundle to furnish the bundle for a lateral stamen (Fig. ii, B4 and B4 a). The general character of the vascular scheme can be understood from Fig. ii, B4 and B5. It will be seen that the lateral stamens are placed opposite to the lateral petals with which they have a close vascular connection. The bundles for the median stamens, on the other hand, are set diagonally, so that they alternate with those for the four petals. We will consider the relations of the whorls later (P. 350). Another point in the flower anatomy of Dicentra spectabilis, which these diagrams illustrate, is the origin of the vascular system for the gynaeceum; this will be best understood by tracing a single strand in detail. In Fig. io, B3 a, p. 335, the phloem of the median stamen strand to the south shows a slight meristematic extension, which is destined to form a strand for the gynaeceum. Immediately above this level, the same stamen bundle contributes to this strand two lignified elements, which, however, soon die out.

The other gynaeceum strands arise in a similar fashion as the result of meri- stematic activity between the bundles and associated with them (Fig. ii, B4). When B5 is reached, the embryonic gynaeceum strands have arranged themselves in a more or less continuous ring, from which the four strands shown in Fig. I2, B6, are finally differentiated. A general idea of the relations of the floral parts can be obtained from Figs. I2, B6 and B7, p. 339, which show sections at the level of the filaments and anthers respectively. Owing to a slight obliquity in the series of sections, the stamens to the left in B6 are cut through their fused bases, while those to the right are already free from one another. There is no stamen-spur comparable with that of Corydalis or Fumaria, but the bases of the stamens bulge slightly into the saccate bases of the lateral petals. In Corydalis and Fumaria, as I have shown, a phloem strand extends into the stamen-spur from the level of junction of the downward and upward limbs of the bundle of the lateral stamen. In Dicentra spectabilis, there is a minimal trace of a similar structure; in the flower figured, the phloem of the lateral stamen is extended a little on either flank of the bundle in the out- ward direction, while in another flower I found a definite phloem strand passing outwards from the bundle. The median stamens also have each a phloem strand given off from the main bundle, which dies out soon after the filaments become free; these strands are seen in the stamens to the left in Fig. I2, B6. A similar and similarly placed phloem strand occurs in each of the median stamens to the right, which, however, are cut at too high a level to show them. I found similar phloem strands in each of the four median stamens in another flower-in one of them there appeared to be more than one such phloem strand. 3. DISCUSSION (i) The vascular relation of the pedicels to the raceme-axis, and to its apex In the three genera of Fumarioideae here studied the preparation for the emission of a bract and pedicel consists in the formation, within the inflorescence axis, of a bract bundle, and of paired bundles for the pedicel, the pedicel bundles lying in what will be the lateral plane of the flower. This is illustrated for Corydalis nobilis, Fig. 2, D1, p. 32I, "strands for flower 3"; C. bulbosa, Fig. 3, A3, p. 323, "paired bundles for pedicel "; Fumaria officinalis, Fig. 8, A1, p. 332,</page><page sequence="23">On the Fumarioideae 339 DICENTRA $S?ECTABWLeX3m. s~epal i' edian petal a ~~~~lateral petal phloem straM in ase median stamen ot nedan stanmeri- latera' ptt?l v /0 '. @ .

In Corydalis and Fumaria these paired bundles pass direct into the pedicel, and though they give off other bundles, they retain their original orientation after leaving the axis (cf. Fumaria officinalis, Fig. 9, B1, p. 334). But in Dicentra spectabilis the arrangement is less conservative. Although there are originally within the axis two vascular masses for the pedicel in the lateral planes (Fig. IO, A3, p. 335), the tissues are re-orientated before the pedicel is detached, so that the final result is a pedicel with its two principal bundles in the antero-posterior plane (Fig. IO, A6 and B,). This change in the orientation is probably related to the gaps formed to right and left by the outward passage of the bracteole bundles; the absence of bracteoles in Fumaria and Corydalis may be the factor that preserves the status quo. In Corydalis nobilis, C. bulbosa and Fumaria officinalis, I have cut serial sections through the apices of racemes which had produced their ultimate flowers, in order to examine the relations of these uppermost flowers to the vascular system of the axis. A raceme-apex in C. nobilis is shown in Fig. 2, D1-D5, p. 32I. It is described on pp. 320-322, SO I will only say now that when the strands for the two uppermost flowers (4 and 5) are differentiated within the axis (D1), two axis strands remain over, although there is no further flower for them to supply. One of these strands (to the right in D2 and D3) divides itself completely between the pedicel strands for flowers 4 and 5, while the other, after giving off a branch on either hand to flowers 4 and 5, dies out itself. The extremely minute apex of the inflorescence axis, which is seen in D5, is thus left wholly non-vascular. The arrangement just described is not the only one that occurs in Corydalis nobilis. An interesting variant, which I found in two racemes, was the transformation of the entire shoot apex above the uppermost flower into a bract, which had no axillary pedicel. No residual tissue whatever was left over to form an axis apex, so that this bract (a leaf member) was strictly terminal to the axis (Fig. I3, A1-A5, p. 34I). In Corydalis bulbosa the origin of the uppermost flowers of an in- florescence can be studied in Fig. 5, B1, etc., p. 327. After the forma- tion of the bract bundle and the two pedicel bundles for this flower, three bundles are left in the axis. One of these axis bundles dies out; the second attaches itself to the pedicel strands (B2); the third divides into two branches, one of which dies out, while the other attaches itself to the pedicel strands. The apex of the axis consists of a minute</page><page sequence="25">On the Fumarioideae 34I portion of decadent non-vascular tissue, which in section appears as a mere appendage to the bract of the uppermost flower.

These bundles fused and died out, after each contributing a strand to the pedicel system. The actual apex was thus left non-vascular. The history of a raceme-tip in Fumaria officinalis is shown in Fig. 9, B1-B4, p. 334. In B1, the axis is seen to contain a single</page><page sequence="26">342 AGNES ARBER bundle (to the north) in addition to those destined for the uppermost flower (called flower 3 in the diagrams). This axis bundle divides itself between the two bundles for pedicel 3, so that no vascular tissue is left for the apex of the axis, which is seen in B3 and B4 to be wholly non-vascular. Another type of raceme termination in Fumaria offitinalis is shown in Fig. I3, B1 and B2, p. 34I. Here after the formation of the bundles for the penultimate flower, only two bundles remain; these supply the bract and pedicel for the uppermost flower. All the vascular tissue left over, after the formation of the penultimate flower, thus goes to the ultimate flower, which is terminal to the raceme; there is no vestige of an axis-apex between these two flowers. The examples described show that there is considerable variation in the structure of the raceme apices in Corydalis and Fumaria. Two points of special interest emerge from their study. Firstly, that one or two of the apical flowers may acquire an extra vascular supply, since vascular strands may pass into them which in the ordinary course would have been destined for later flowers; and, secondly, that the raceme axis may actually terminate in an axillant bract with its pedicel, or even in a bract alone. Both these types of termination can be paralleled among the Grasses. In the spikelet (partial inflores- cence) of Luziola Spruceana Benth., the entire apex is transformed into the lemma (bract), palea (bracteole) and flower ((2), p. 402). And among the Bamboos we find examples of a bract (lemma) terminating the axis of a spikelet (for discussion and references, see (3), p. 302). (ii) The occurrence of rudimentary sepals In Corydalis nobilis and C. lutea, there is, in the antero-posterior plane, a single pair of small sepals with a normal vascular supply; they are shown in Fig. i, B2, C2-C1o, p. 3I8, and Fig. 7, I-4, p. 330. In Corydalis bulbosa, on the other hand, the corresponding pair of sepals is extremely reduced and entirely non-vascular (Fig. 5, B6, B6 a and B7, p. 327). (iii) The anatomy of the stamen-s.Pr I have described the anatomy of the stamen-spur in some detail for Corydalis bulbosa (Fig. 6, p. 328) and for Fumaria officinalis (Fig. 8, p. 332). In both, the bundle of the spurred stamen, which is the central member of one phalange, dips down into the spur, and then -doubling sharply on itself-turns upwards, passing eventually into the filament. The downward and upward limbs remain distinct in Corydalis bulbosa (Fig. 6, C4) but in Fumaria officinalis, the xylems</page><page sequence="27">On the Fumarioideae 343 are in contact and cannot always be discriminated (Fig. 8, A4 a). The xylem in both species is accompanied in its downward course by a massive phloem group, while very little phloem is associated with the upward limb. The bundle does not dip down far into the free part of the spur, but this region is not left without conducting tissue, for in Corydalis bulbosa the phloem of both upward and downward limbs (Fig. 6, C2), and in Fumaria officinalis that of the downward limb alone (Fig. 8, B and A1 a, A2, A3, A3 a), is prolonged into it. In Fumaria officinalis the spur is papillose (A3a), and presumably excretes nectar through the hairs. In Dicentra spectabilis, though there is no spur, the bases of the stamens bulge into the saccate bases of the lateral petals. And here again there is an extra development of phloem (p. 338). A branch is given off from the phloem of the bundle of each of the median stamens, and the phloem groups of the lateral stamens also form outgrowths (Fig. I2, B6, p. 339). We thus find that in Corydalis, Fumaria and Dicentra, phloem strands are given off from the stamen bundles to serve the nectari- ferous region. It is interesting in this connection to recall that the glandular tissue of the Crucifers is supplied by strands which have the characters of protophloem ((4), p. 30). (iv) The occurrence of stomates in the anther wall In Fig. 4, A14 and A14 a, p. 325, I have illustrated the occurrence of stomates in the groove between the two synangia of a stamen of Corydalis bulbosa. I have found these stomates in the groove of a lateral stamen in three different flowers. These stomates must be non- functional, as they occur-to all appearance-immediately above striated elements of the wall of the pollen-sac. (v) The occurrence of a rudimentary "replum " Fig. I2, C, p. 339, shows that, in Dicentra spectabilis, at the ex- treme base of the ovary the placentae meet to form a bridge recalling the replum of the Crucifers. The same state of things may occur in Corydalis nobilis and C. bulbosa, while in Fumaria officinalis I have seen traces of a similar ridge across the roof of an ovary. (vi) The origin of the gynaeceum strands The origin of the gynaeceum strands in Dicentra spectabilis is illustrated in Figs. ii, B4 and B5, p. 337. Current morphological notions would lead one to expect to find, after the departure of the stamen traces, a residual vascular cylinder, from which the carpellary</page><page sequence="28">344 AGNES ARBER traces would be derived. But no such cylinder exists. On the con- trary, after the four median stamen strands have been formed, and while those for the lateral stamens are in process of formation, meri- stematic activity begins between them, in the regions marked " gynaeceum " in Fig. ii, B4; this activity leads as a secondary result to the development of the vascular tissue for the gynaeceum seen in B5. The history of one of the embryonic strands supplying the gynaeceum can be traced in Fig. io, B3 a, and Fig. iI, B3 b and B4 a. According to those canons of orthodox morphology which depend on the postulate that stem and leaf are fundamentally distinct entities', a foliar strand cannot arise except from an axial strand, and therefore a carpellary strand cannot be derived from a stamen strand. But if we put aside any such preconceptions about what should hap- pen, and simply look at the facts as they are, we cannot fail to recognise (in Fig. Io, B3 a and Fig. II, B3 b and B4 a) that the process of detachment of a gynaeceum strand from a stamen strand is actu- ally occurring. In order to reconcile the facts with the canons of "stem and leaf " morphology, we should be obliged to describe the median stamen strand in B4 a as having originated from the small strand adjacent to it labelled "embryonic strand for gynaeceum." Fig. B3 a must then be taken to represent the level at which the stamen bundle is " given off " from this strand. But as the strand in question is in fact merely a meristematic outgrowth from the phloem of the stamen bundle, to regard it as the parent strand of the stamen bundle is clearly absurd. Literal adhesion to the stem and leaf view thus leads to an obviously untenable position. (vii) The interpretation of the androecium (A) Summary of the existing theories. It is well known that the androecium of the Fumarioideae con- sists of two lateral stamen groups (phalanges) each formed of a "dithecal" member with four pollen sacs, flanked by two lateral "monothecal " members, each with two pollen-sacs (Fig. I, C.2, p. 3I8; Fig. 9, C, p. 334; Fig. I2, B7, p. 339). This peculiar arrangement has at different times received three different interpretations. (I) Bernhardi in I8oo and later ((7) but the idea more fully developed in (8)), followed by Wydler in I859 (19), maintained that the androecium consists of four stamens, two lateral and two median; the lateral members occupy their natural places, while each of the two median stamens is split in half, the halves being attached to the 1 For arguments against the validity of this view, see (3).</page><page sequence="29">On the Fumarioideae 345 lateral whole stamens on either side. Eichler (11), and others following him, attribute this theory to A. P. de Candolle, and to A. St Hilaire and A. Moquin-Tandon, but I cannot find that these writers ever explicitly committed themselves to it. So I think that it should be called Bernhardi's theory, or the "i I" theory. (2) Eichler (10), (11) supported the view first put forward by Asa Gray in I848 (15), that only the outer whorl of stamens is present, consisting of two lateral stamens, each of which bears two mono- thecal members laterally, as stipules. Each stamen phalange is thus equivalent to a single stamen. (3) A third theory was clearly enunciated by Gay (13) as early as I842, but it did not come into prominence until Celakovsky arrived at the same idea independently some fifty years later and presented a full and reasoned statement of his grounds for it (9). Celakovsky's view is that there is an outer whorl of two lateral stamens, followed by an inner whorl of four whole stamens, which, however, are reduced and monothecal, and are attached to the flanks of the stamens of the outer whorl. (B) Criticism of the existing theories. The oldest of the theories enumerated above dates back for more than a hundred and thirty years, while even the newest is more than eighty years old, and yet no one of them can be said to have gained general acceptance, despite the time afforded for considering them. So I propose now to attempt a criticism of each in turn, and then to outline the view at which I have myself arrived, on the basis of the structural evidence detailed in the preceding pages. (i) On the " Ii" theory of the stamen phalange, each mono- thecal member is, in reality, part of the same stamen as the corre- sponding monothecal member of the opposite stamen phalange. If this theory were correct, we should expect to find that the vascular supply of the two monothecal members, which are held to be halves of one stamen, would show some evidence of their relationship. E. R. Saunders (18), who has attempted to support this theory on anatomical grounds, writes, in reference to the bundles destined for the monothecal stamens in Corydalis lustea, "The petal tissue blocks the way to the union and consolidation of each pair of these small bundles into a single median cord." But I doubt if any anatomist will accept the contention that when two bundles have a third bundle between them, we are at liberty to assume that these two bundles are really the halves of one bundle, which are prevented from showing</page><page sequence="30">346 AGNES ARBER their unity by the existence of the bundle between them. And even if, for the sake of argument, we accept this principle, we find that it proves too much. It might equally well be applied, for instance, to the left-hand group in Fig. Io, B3, p. 335, in which the strands for two median stamens of Dicentra spectabilis are seen to be separated by the bundle which will give rise to a lateral petal and stamen. On E. R. Saunders's principle, we should have to suppose that the union of these two median stamen bundles is only prevented by the bundle between them, and that, but for this obstacle, they would unite and so prove themselves one. From this it would follow that the two monothecal stamens which flank one lateral stamen are the halves of a single member-a conclusion altogether antagonistic to the interpretation which E. R. Saunders upholds. And not only is her principle inadmissible on general grounds, but a study of serial microtome sections through the flower shows that there is nothing in the special case which she takes-Corydalis lutea-to support her suggestion. I have drawn the strands in question in Fig. 7, p. 330, where they are labelled " strands for median stamens " (see especially I, A and B, and 2, A and B). Moreover, in the anatomy of the other species studied, I find nothing whatever to confirm E. R. Saunders's view that " a single median cord" has suffered " congenital separation into two portions." On the contrary, as I have shown for flowers of Corydalis nobilis and C. bulbosa, in Figs. I, 3 and 4, the monothecal stamens which Bernhardi and E. R. Saunders claim as halves of the same member, are unconnected in their vascular supply, even to the point of deriving their bundles from strands which are already dis- tinct from one another below the base of the flower. For instance, Fig. i A, p. 3I8, shows, for C. nobilis, that the two monothecal stamens to the north, which on Bernhardi's view are halves of the same stamen, derive their vascular supply respectively from two distinct bundles of the pedicel, A and B, in Fig. i, B1, while the two to the south derive theirs respectively from A and D. The anatomical evidence thus makes it impossible to accept Bernhardi's view. (2) Eichler's theory need not be considered in detail, as it fails to stand the anatomical test. The three members of the left-hand phalange in Fig. i A, p. 3I8, derive their vascular supply from three independent pedicel bundles, although on Eichler's theory, they all belong to one leaf member. (3) Celakovsky's theory may be analysed into three independent propositions, which for purposes of criticism are best considered separately.</page><page sequence="31">On the Fumarioideae 347 (a) That the androecium of the Fumarioideae consists of six in- dependent members. It will be recognised from the account of the flower structure in the descriptive section of this paper that the anatomy entirely supports this view. (b) That the monothecal character of the anthers of four of these stamens is not inconsistent with their being reduced whole stamens. The existence of only two instead of four pollen-sacs in four of the stamens in the Fumarioideae has often been felt as a difficulty. Eichler spoke of "die Abnormitat in dem Vorkommen zwei- und einfacheriger Staubgefasse in der namlichen Bliithe" (10). Indeed it was to get over this apparent difficulty that the "half" stamen theory was promulgated. But is not this theory too anthropomorphic to be valid? There is some reason to believe that in the course of phylogeny organs may undergo dedoublement, but I know of no evidence that nature ever behaves like a man with a knife-splitting an organ down lengthways into two entirely separate halves, which continue an autonomous existence, though retaining permanently the external characters of "half" organs. But even if we have a right to postulate such a process, there is certainly no need to invoke it here; for, as Celakovsky points out, the difficulty created by the presence of dithecal and monothecal anthers in the same flower is an imaginary one, since these two types of anther actually occur together in Atelanthera perbusilla Hook. f. et Thoms., a Crucifer recorded only from Kashmir and Turkestan. In this plant, which owes its generic name to its imperfect anthers, the four inner stamens, which the comparison with normal Crucifers shows to be whole (not "half") stamens, have each two pollen-sacs only. I have been able to cut sections of herbarium material of a flower-bud of this species from Thomson's original collection, and these sections show the two types of anther (Fig. I4, A, p. 348). Moreover the mono- thecal anthers of Atelanthera are not unique, for anthers of the same character are occasionally to be found in reduced stamens elsewhere. For instance, in examining serial sections of seventy flowers from an abnormal stock of the Bamboo, Cephalostachyum virgatum, in which the androecium showed a tendency to reduction, I found ten flowers in each of which one of the stamens had two pollen-sacs instead of four (1(), p. 68). One of these is sketched in Fig. I4, B1, B2, p. 348, for comparison with a monothecal anther of Corydalis nobilis Pers. (Fig. I4, C). In the flower of Cephalostachyum virgatum illustrated, the reduction of one anther to the monothecal state may well be the</page><page sequence="32">348 AGNES ARBER MONTECAL ANTHERS FOR COMEPAISON WITH E FUMARIOIDE petal AT ELAN THE RA PERPUSILLA, Hooki ethonts.

The stamens are even more closely appressed than is shown in the diagram, for the mere fact of outlining the parts, so as to make them distinguishable, exaggerates their separateness. The flowering glume (lemma) enwraps the flower one-and-a-half times, and the palea more than encircles the flower. The moulding of the palea to the surface of the anthers, and the infolding of one of its margins, suggest a condition of compression. And, as will be shown in (C), p. 35I, it is possible that the monothecal character of the median stamens in the Fumarioideae may be due to pressure which inhibits full development. (c) That the androecium consists of an outer whorl-the two lateral dithecal stamens-and an inner whorl-the four monothecal stamens. I do not find that the anatomy of the Fumarioideae lends any support to this element of Celakovsky's theory. In Dicentra specta- bilis, for instance, the bundles for the median (monothecal) stamens are first individualised, and then each of the two bundles which will supply a lateral petal gives off a strand on either flank; the fusion of these two strands forms a bundle for the lateral stamen, which is thus later in origin than the bundles for the monothecal stamens. The history of these bundles can be followed in Fig. io, B3, B3 a, p. 335, and Fig. ii, BA B4, B a and B5, p. 337. A similarly belated origin of the lateral stamen strands is shown for Corydalis lutea in Fig. 7, 2 A, p. 330, and for C. bulbosa, in Fig. 3, A7, p. 323. These facts make it impossible to follow Celakovsky' in regarding the lateral stamens as belonging to an outer whorl, and the monothecal stamens to an inner whorl. (C) The interpretation here proposed. We have shown in the preceding pages that neither Bemhardi's nor Eichler's theories of the androecium can be harmonised with the facts of flower structure in the Fumarioideae. The evidence, on the other hand, is consistent with that part of Celakovsky's theory which asserts that the androecium of the Fumarioideae consists of six whole stamens, two of which are dithecal, while the remaining four, which are monothecal, are fused laterally with the dithecal members. But, though accepting Celakovsky's theory up to this point, I wish to propose a modification of it, so far as the whorl-succession in the flower is concerned. I should describe the flower of the Fumarioideae, in its most complete and typical development (e.g. Dicentra, which is shown diagrammatically in Fig. I5, P. 350) in the following terms. A pedicel arises in the axil of a bract and bears two bracteoles later- PHYT. XXX. 5 24</page><page sequence="34">350 AGNES ARBER ally; one pair of sepals in the antero-posterior plane is followed by a pair of outer lateral petals, and an inner pair of petals in the antero- posterior plane. These petals, though they may rightly be described as two dimerous whorls, form-from the point of view of floral alternation-a single complex whorl', with which the four mono- thecal stamens alternate; it will be recognised, from such sketches as, Fig. ii, B4, p. 337, that the bundles for the four median stamens are in definite alternation with the petal bundles. Two carpels are present with their midribs in the lateral plane, thus lying between the dia- gonal planes in which the four monothecal stamens are developed.

Floral diagram of Dicentra, to illustrate the view of the flower mor- phology of the Fumarioideae adopted in the present paper. It will be noticed that in this enumeration of the floral whorls I have omitted the lateral stamens which, anatomically, form a whorl within the median (monothecal) stamens. I have done so because the lateral petals, with their superposed lateral stamens, seem to me to form examples of what de Jussieu(17) long ago called "petales... doubles chacun d'une etamine"; the petal and stamen together should thus be regarded as a complex unit behaving as a single member in floral alternation. This idea has recently been worked out from the anatomical standpoint by Bancroft and Dickson in their interesting study of the floral morphology of Pelargonium (6). On the view just outlined regarding the sequence of the whorls, I Fedde (I2) explains a complex whorl as consisting of two or more true whorls, together forming a unit with which the next whorl alternates as with a single whorl.</page><page sequence="35">On the Fumarioideae 35I the flower of the Fumarioideae cannot be as closely compared with that of the Cruciferae as was supposed by Gay and Celakovsky. For while the Crucifers have two pairs of sepals in the lateral and antero- posterior planes, followed by four diagonally placed petals, alter- nating with the complex sepal whorl, the Fumarioideae have one pair of sepals in the antero-posterior plane, followed by two pairs of petals in the lateral and antero-posterior planes. And, as regards the androecium, the lateral stamens of the Crucifers belong to an external whorl, alternating with the petals, the antero-posterior stamens of this whorl being undeveloped, while the four diagonally placed stamens follow the outer whorl in regular alternation. But in the Fumarioideae, as I have shown, the four monothecal stamens alter- nate with the petals, while the lateral antepetalous stamens must be counted as one with the lateral petals from the point of view of the alternation sequence. A question which remains to be considered is whether there is any indication of a physical cause for the reduction of the four median stamens to the monothecal state. In the flower of Ceplsalostaclsyum virgatum with a monothecal anther, discussed on pp. 347-349, it seems probable that this reduction may be due to development under pressure and I think that this idea may be extended to the Fumarioi- deae. Indeed the possible importance of pressure conditions in the development of the flower of the Fumarioideae was long ago empha- sised by Godron (14). The smallness of the front and back sepals in Corydalis, culminating in their reduction to the minute non-vascular rudiments found in C. bulbosa (Fig. 5, B6 and B7, p. 327) suggests some inhibiting factor acting in this plane. The curious marginal relation of the median and lateral petals in Corydalis bulbosa (p. 326 and Fig. 3, A8 and Ag, p. 323, and Fig. 4, A10-A12, p. 325) also in- dicates a state of compression between the back and front of the flower. And in Fig. i2, B6 and C, p. 339, it will be seen that each median petal of Dicentra spectabilis is nipped between the margins of the two lateral petals in such a way that its midrib emerges in the small space between them, as if it were seeking an outlet for its growth. There is every appearance of the existence of pressure along the antero-posterior plane, for these median petals are so closely appressed to the gynaeceum by their inner faces that the median stamens are forced out of their natural stations, which alternate with the petals. They are pressed to right and left, and their filaments thus come to form, basally, a continuous structure with those of the lateral stamens. In the case of Dicentra, this compression in the 24-2</page><page sequence="36">352 AGNES ARBER antero-posterior plane may perhaps be attributed to the pinching effect of the single pair of sepals which occurs in this plane. These sepals, though inconspicuous in the fully formed flower, are relatively well-developed in young stages (Fig. ii, B5 and Fig. I2, B6). The bract and bracteoles of Dicentra may also play a part as agents of compression in the earliest phases. In Corydalis and Fumaria the chief factor in exerting pressure is probably the bract, which at its base may completely enclose the pedicel. The remarkably massive character of the bract in comparison with the young pedicel may be recognised from Fig. 2, D1 and D3, p. 32I (Corydalis nobilis Pers.); Fig. 3, A1 and A2, p. 323, and Fig. 5, B3-B5, p. 327 (C. bulbosa Reichb.); Fig. 9, B1, p. 334 (Fumaria officinalis L.). But it must be re- membered that the question of how far spatial conditions and pres- sure in early stages of ontogeny may influence form is at present in a highly speculative state, and any interpretation based on it must be of a tentative character. 4. SUMMARY i. The flower structure of species belonging to Corydalis, Fumaria and Dicentra is described and figured (pp. 3i8-338), and attention is drawn to certain points arising out of these descriptions: (a) The special vascular relations of the uppermost flower of the raceme, which may receive supernumerary vascular tissue, or may, on the other hand, be reduced to vanishing point, and be represented only by its axillant bract, which then affords an example of a leaf actually terminating an axis (pp. 338-342). (b) The occurrence of non-vascular sepals in Corydalis bulbosa Reichb. (p. 342). (c) The structure of the stamen-spur in Corydalis and Fumaria, which is served by a bundle dipping into the spur and turning up again into the filament, and also contributing a strand or strands of phloem to the distal region of the spur; the occurrence of phloem strands supplying the unspurred stamen bases in Dicentra spectabilis; the probable connexion of the extra phloem development in the stamens of these three genera with nectar secretion (pp. 342-343). (d) The occurrence of stomates (apparently non-functional) in the groove of the lateral anthers of Corydalis bulbosa Reichb. (p. 343). (e) The fact that a rudimentary " replum " may occur at the base of the ovary in Corydalis and in its roof in Fumaria (p. 343). (f) The " secondary" origin of the gynaeceum strands in Dicentra</page><page sequence="37">On the Fumarioideae 353 spectabilis, which is irreconcilable with the view of anatomy based on the postulate that "stem" and "leaf" are fundamentally distinct morphological entities (pp. 343-344). 2.. The morphological interpretation of the androecium in the Fumarioideae is discussed (pp. 344-352). The various views which have been held are considered and criticised, and it is suggested that a modification of Celakovsky's theory best meets the case (see Fig. I5, p. 350). According to this view the androecium consists of six stamens -two, which are normal and dithecal, and four, which, though re- duced and monothecal, are independent members, and not "half" stamens. The lateral stamens belong, anatomically, to the inner whorl, but in the alternation sequence they count as one whorl with the lateral petals to which they are superposed. The evidence indi- cates that pressure in the early stages of development may possibly be one of the factors determining the peculiarities of the flower in the Fumarioideae.
