<plain_text><page sequence="1">Book Reviews Charles S. Peirce: Naturordnung und Zeichenprozess, Schriften iiber Semiotik und Naturphilosophie, mit einem Vorwort von Tiya Prigogine Helmut Pape, Editor, Bertram Kienzle, Translator Aachen: Alano Verlag/Rader Publikationen, 1988. 484 pp. + Appendix. Price unavailable Published as Band 18 of the series Aachener Studien zur Semiotik und Kommunikationsforschung, this collection of various writings by Peirce ranging in date from 1884 to 1906 emphasizes the evolutionary element both in Peirce's philosophy of nature and in Peirce's semeiotic. It argues forcefully for an intimate connection between Peirce's ob- jectification of probability on the one hand and Peirce's fallibilistic account of knowledge-acquisition and theory-construction on the other. It insists on Peirce as a systematic and speculative philosopher with a unitary vision of his task. It spotlights Peirce's objective ideal- ism. And, while it attributes to the special sciences a particularly important role in Peirce's thought, it neither predicates of Peirce a rigid scientism nor ignores the kinds of validity that Peirce accorded to all experiences. The emphases of the volume are entoned in its every segment, from the foreword by Nobel-Prize-winning non-equilibrium thermodynami- cist Ilya Prigogine, to the excellent 100-page introductory essay by editor Helmut Pape, through the carefully-selected and arranged texts of Peirce, and to the Appendix consisting of 36 definitions by Peirce from The Century Dictionary and Cyclopedia. The admirable translations of Peirce's writings are arranged into 15 pieces - let us call them "chapters" - which are grouped (in the table of contents, though not, curiously enough, in the body of the text itself) into two parts. Part 1, consisting of seven chapters, is entitled "The Cosmology of Evolution," and Part 2, consisting of eight chap- ters, is entitled "The Evolutionary Semeiotic of Knowledge." The effect of Pape's arrangement of the writings is that of a continuous</page><page sequence="2">148 Book Reviews composition by Peirce on the topic of evolutionary metaphysics and epistemology. Though some readers may find the unity too artifi- cial and too much imposed ab extra, there can be no question that the themes that Pape's editorship has highlighted are major themes in Peirce's thought. And essays 3 through 7 are Peirce's five articles for The Monist. Seven of the chapters, and part of an eighth, are translated from sections of the Collected Papers. But a surprising amount of this volume's Peircean material, about half of it, has been translated di- rectly from (photocopies of) handwritten manuscripts. Thus we find either complete translations of or selections from manuscripts 975, 957, 870, 293, 830, 831, 517, 439, as well as bits of a manuscript iden- tified on p. 106 as MS 964 but on p. 126 as MS 954. And the first essay, "Design and Chance," translated from MS 975, has not pre- viously been published. The second essay consists of selections related to "The Architecture of Theories," which is itself the third essay. Essay 8, which begins the second part of this book's contents, is entitled "Causation and Force." Essay 9 is entitled "What Is a Natural Law," and is trans- lated from MS 870. Essay 10 is selections from "Prolegomena to an Apology for Pragmaticism," and is translated from MS 293. Selec- tions from MS 830 and 831 appear in Essay 11 under the title "Per- ception as Unconscious Inference." Essay 12 is "New Elements," translated from MS 517. Essay 13 is entitled "Further Independent Ideas and the Conflict between Nominalism and Realism," and is translated from MS 439. Essay 14 is "Variety and Uniformity," from the sixth Lowell Lecture of 1903. Essay 15 is an abridgement of the eighth Lowell Lecture of 1903, entitled in the Collected Papers as "On Selecting Hypotheses," and entitled in Pape's book as "On The- ory Construction." Arranging for the Foreword by the distinguished contemporary scientist Ilya Prigogine was a masterful stroke by Pape. For, both in the mere fact of its presence and in the content of Prigogine 's re- marks, the foreword - translated from French into German by Doro- thea Schmidt - signals recognition not only of Peirce's scientific</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 149 genius in its historical Darwinian context, but also of the undeniable contemporary relevance of Peirce's technical insights. Prigogine finds most especially relevant to contemporary science the Peircean themes that Pape's editorship stresses: the evolutionary character of nature and knowledge. Prigogine locates two contemporary scientific ideas in particular - the idea of objective probability and the idea of ir- reversible processes that are both destructive and constructive - with regard to which "Peirce made pioneering accomplishments." Helmut Pape's introductory essay proposes to be no less than a complete interpretation of Peirce's entire philosophical task. Pape enunciates a handful of theses about Peirce's overall project and at- tempts to show how the myriad and manifold pieces of Peirce's vast production fit into the resulting general system. The essay is as im- portant as it is ambitious, and it deserves expansion into a book in its own right. Section 1 of Pape's introduction takes up where Prigogine left off. After excoriating a narrow analytic approach to philosophy, Pape proceeds to exalt speculative philosophy of the Peircean sort by maintaining that Peirce anticipated three chief definitory character- istics of non-equilibrium thermodynamic systems, which Pape finds outlined by Prigogine in his Tanner Lecture on Human Value of 1982, entitled uOnly an Illusion?": 1) their being composed of a very large number of microscopic parts (e.g., molecules), 2) their being subject to a time-dependent principle governing the actions of these parts in such a manner that the system's end state is not deterministically predictable but is the outcome of the unpredictable actions of the parts themselves, and 3) their being describable at the macroscopic level in terms of probabilistic regularities. Pape also mentions the importance in non-equilibrium systems of breaches of symmetry, and he relates this to Peirce's using the example of dextrose and levulose in arguing against mechanistic determinism (CP 5.65). Pape concludes that Peirce actually anticipated non-equilibrium thermo- dynamics. This anticipation, Pape maintains, is only one of Peirce's staggering successes; and Pape seeks to answer the question as to the basis of</page><page sequence="4">150 Book Reviews Peirce's amazing accomplishments. He maintains that this basis lies precisely in the speculative and systematic methodology of Peirce's philosophizing, in the fact that Peirce's philosophy is architectonic in the sense that on the basis of logical and semeiotic structure it seeks for ontological structure by going beyond mere particular philosophical questions and attempting to formulate a theory of reality valid for all the special disciplines (human, cultural, and physical). Only by going beyond merely analytic methods, Pape adds, is such a rich and rele- vant philosophy as that of Peirce possible. In this theme Pape is echo- ing well-known ideas of his teacher Klaus Oehler. In four theses, labelled Tj through T4, Pape encapsulates the fun- damental semeiotic and ontological conceptions that he sees as form- ing the core of Peirce's philosophical project. Tj says that "Peirce's evolutionary philosophy of nature is grounded by principles that are taken over from semeiotic." T2 says that "The ontologically primary element for material metaphysics is mind (Geist). Matter that no longer contains a mental (geistiges) element is mind that has perished." T3 says that "Every habit of states of affairs, every law of nature, and every consensus of a community of intelligent beings is the result of a single mental process of the development of regularity in this uni- verse, which process starts from conditions of great fortuitousness and has as its limit the identity of mind and matter." T4 says that "The development of more strongly determining regularities from more fortuitous circumstances is irreversible and thus fixes a temporal di- rection, so that the most important function of all forms of represen- tation is to select regularities of future events in harmony with the goal of enabling even further goals in the future to be chosen." From these densely-packed theses Pape elicits the nethermost reaches of Peirce's evolutionary objective idealism, which Pape finds similar to, though different in various details from, the idealisms of Kant, Schelling, and Hegel. Of special concern to Pape is the "anthropo- morphism thesis," according to which hypotheses that appear natural to us have a certain probability in themselves. He is also especially concerned with the entire problem of the connection in Peirce's thought between the evolution of nature and the development of sys- tems of signs.</page><page sequence="5">Book Reviews 151 Section 2 of the introduction seeks to clarify the sense in which the evolutionary emergence of new forms and properties is founded in the dimension of the anthropomorphic possibilities of experience. Pape maintains here a similarity between Peirce's thinking in this regard and the so-called "anthropic cosmological principle* * by means of which some contemporary cosmologists, such as Barrow and Tipler, have attempted to account for the fact that the fundamental constants of nature have the values that they do. Section 3 and 4 of the introduction continue the discussion of the significance of the "anthropomorphism-thesis'* and discuss the re- lationship between Peirce's semeiotic and his philosophy of nature in great detail. The main argument here is to the effect that symbolic sign forms regularly bring about the achievement of purposes in such a way that any purposeful development always includes the develop- ment of a system of signs. And Chapter 5 tries to provide a founda- tion for Peirce's thesis that an ongoing community of intelligent beings is a rational postulate of cosmological speculation. There should be little question that on the whole and in broad general terms, Pape has correctly characterized the systematic unity of Peirce's thought. Pape's argument in detail, however, is so con- densed, many-sided, and in some places complex, that discussing it meaningfully in a short review would be impossible. One matter related to the introductory essay, as well as to the book as a whole, does nevertheless invite attention. Pape has pro- vided yet another illustration of a fact with which, sooner or later, every Peirce scholar must come to terms: Peirce was a first-rank sci- entific and mathematical genius who was in many ways so far ahead of his time that he became a kind of professional martyr to his own intellectual ability and achievement. As Carolyn Eisele has repeatedly insisted, and as Pape displays once again, every part of Peirce's phi- losophy is invested with, indeed saturated in, concepts taken from advanced topics in mathematics (especially mathematical logic), physics, chemistry, and biology. The implication of this fact is that for scholars to deal seriously with Peirce's philosophy, they must be educated not merely in philosophy as standardly taught, but also</page><page sequence="6">152 Book Reviews educated (and educated to a fairly advanced level) in the special sciences and most especially in mathematics and mathematical logic. To see that this is so, one merely has to reflect for a moment about what sort of argumentation would be required to verify in detail Pape's thesis that Peirce anticipated non-equilibrium thermodynamics. Think, for example, how one would set about showing that Peirce understood the concept of "far from equilibrium," which is so central to Prigogine's concept of reality. This point is connected with Pape's thesis that philosophy must go beyond the merely analytical to the speculative. Of course, this is correct. But the key words are go beyond. As Pape is clearly aware, these words should not be taken to mean bypass but rather only to mean surpass. For the analytic tendency in philosophy cannot be gone beyond by ignoring it. Nor can this tendency's own ignoring of Peirce, and its occasional outright disdain for Peirce, be overcome except by beating it at its own game. Defenders of Peirce who will not argue analytically, nor learn the technical material necessary to display in detail Peirce's thinking, will be seen by analysts as merely doing what the mathematicians call "waving of the hands." Pape has produced a fine edition of Peirce's writings that inevi- tably will show the German philosophical community that Peirce is a major figure of modern culture. This community owes Pape its congratulations and thanks. Texas A &amp; M University Robert Burch</page></plain_text>
