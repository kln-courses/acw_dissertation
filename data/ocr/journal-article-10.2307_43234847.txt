<plain_text><page sequence="1">Reginald Byron Ethnicity at the Limit Ancestry and the Politics of Multiculturalism in the United States Since the 1970s, there has been a fundamental change in the politics of culture in the United States. Until then, the predominant ethos was that of the melting pot; an ethos which assumed that the old-country cultures and loyalties of the immigrant generation were merging as the generations succeeded one another and would continue to do so until, eventually, ev- ery citizen had become an unethnic American. This ethos has been grad- ually replaced by another, that of multiculturalism, which now predom- inates in both popular and scholarly discourse. Unlike assimilationism, which posits a temporal process of linear social change, multiculturalism is largely atemporal: it assumes that every American remains identifiably ethnic, and a member of the cultural category associated with his or her immigrant ancestors. Multiculturalism is, thus, centrally concerned with classification, boundary-definition, and the relationships between these bounded segments within a political field. This paper examines the conse- quences of this ideological shift for one representative European ancestral origin category: contemporary Americans of Irish descent. I The 1980 U. S. Census, the first to ask an ancestry question, revealed that there are now more than 40 million Americans of Irish ancestry. Since then, this figure has been widely quoted and has been taken to mean that there is an ethnic constituency of 40 million Irish-Americans in the United States, an interpretation endorsed by at least one leading American socio- logical journal. In 1994, Michael Hout and Joshua Goldstein contributed an article to the American Sociological Review entitled, 'How 4.5 Mil- lion Irish Immigrants Became 40 Million Irish- Americans'.

Yet, since 74 per cent of these people actually reported themselves to be of mixed Irish an- cestry, nearly 30 million were simultaneously something else: German- American, English- American, Italian-American, and so on; that is, the same persons appear in other ancestral categories. Nor is the ancestry of the remaining 10 million persons - who reported themselves to be of pure, unmixed Irish ancestry - without problems of interpretation.1 This fig- ure is extraordinarily high, when compared with other, methodologically more reliable sources of information about the ancestral composition of the present-day American population. There is strong suspicion that there was a significant tendency for people of complex ancestry to respond to the census question with a single label, making it appear that they were of pure, unmixed Irish ancestry when in fact they were not. Why should they have done this? One possibility is that through the pervasive influence of multicultural- ism, sanctioned by contemporary political ideologies, the younger gener- ations of Americans may be coming to think of themselves in terms of the simple, reductive folk categories of ethnic populism. As the generations pass and people become more distant from their immigrant origins, and as their genealogies continue to ramify and become more complex, more people predictably will simply fail to keep track of their ancestry and will not pass on to their children anything more than a crude label or two. As other researchers have noted,2 the older generations who have already lost track or whose pedigrees make their categorical identities indeterminate may have had little option but to reply 'American' to the census ques- tion. Apparently unremarked upon, however, is the distinct possibility that those schooled since the 1970s are much more likely to reply to questions about their ancestry with answers about the folk category that they have been encouraged to believe they belong, just as a native Australian might quote the name of his or her totemic clan: a group which coheres on the basis of putative common descent, rather than demonstrable genealogical links. 1 See S.

Waters, From Many Strands ; R. Farley, 'The new census question about ancestry: what did it tell us?' 10</page><page sequence="3">Ethnicity at the Limit The American sociologist Herbert Gans observed, in 1979, that as the generations have passed since their immigrant ancestors arrived in Amer- ica, the ethnic identities of their descendants have been transformed by the nature of the social milieux which have nourished their expression.3 As assimilation and intermarriage have proceeded over the generations, the hard edges of ethnicity have gradually worn away. While people may still be identified as ethnics by others on the basis of their surnames or phys- ical appearance, the everyday lived experience that once went with being ethnic has largely disappeared, allowing individuals the latitude to decide when, how, and in what degree - if at all - to express their attachment to their ancestry. As the pedigrees of individuals have become mixed and complicated through intermarriage with people of other ancestral back- grounds, their ethnic identity has become increasingly indeterminate. The boundaries of belonging overlap, lose their definition, and melt away. Identity with one's ancestral origins becomes optional, a matter of per- sonal inclination and interpretation. For the later-generation descendants of European immigrants, Gans's hypothesis has been largely borne out by subsequent research. The Amer- ican sociologists Richard Alba, Stanley Lieberson, and Mary Waters have shown that in terms of concrete social action, if not also in the ways that people think of themselves, distinctive differences associated with their old-country origins have dimmed and disappeared in everyday social ex- perience as the generations have passed. It is now clear that what consti- tutes a sense of ethnic identity among these Americans varies greatly in quality and quantity from one individual to another. Moreover, free inter- marriage across ancestral lines over the generations has had the result that most people of European origin are nowadays of mixed descent: which of their European origins they might identify with, if any, the analyst cannot presume to know in advance. Thus neither the social distribution nor the cultural contents of ethnicity can any longer be taken for granted, but must be established empirically. In the same paper, Herbert Gans noted that ethnicity is determined not only by what goes on among the ethnics, but also by developments in the larger society, a remark which echoed the point made by Max Weber in 1921, that the appearance and persistence of ethnic identification is related to its political context.4 Until the 1970s, the prevailing political ideology 3 H. Gans, 'Symbolic Ethnicity: The Future of Ethnic Groups in America'. M. Weber, Economy and Society (G. Roth and C. Wittisch, eds.), Vol. 1, 389-95. 11</page><page sequence="4">Reginald Byron in America was that of the Melting Pot: immigrants' children were of- ficially described as native-born Americans who were expected to have largely sloughed off their parents' old-country loyalties, and it was widely assumed that by the third generation their grandchildren would be com- pletely assimilated, unethnic Americans. For millions of people of Euro- pean origin, this was not merely a political ideology buttressed by a schol- arly theory (that of 'straight-line' assimilation): it was a moral project, a fundamental civic value of Americanness in which they were brought up to believe. Over the generations, they strove to make their children the same as their neighbours' children: unethnic, unhyphenated, unlabelled, and undifferent. That a high degree of assimilation was largely achieved, at least for the later-generation descendants of people of European origin if not for other Americans, is broadly supported by the findings of recent sociological research. Yet, paradoxically, as the lived-and-felt experience of ethnicity has been transformed by generational distance and compli- cated by intermarriage, a new political arena - that of multiculturalism - has emerged since the 1970s. New ethnies have been created, and mori- bund ones revitalized and reinvented just at a moment in American his- tory when they had all but vanished for the descendants of mid-nineteenth century European immigrants. As it has come to be widely accepted - so gradually that the truly profound nature of this ideological shift has perhaps received less recognition than it ought - that everyone in Amer- ica should now have 'an ethnic identity' and that every newly-invented or reinvented ethnie should be furnished with 'a culture' and 'a history', Weber's observation now seems more applicable to American society than ever before: ethnies are not to be understood as things-in-themselves, but only in relation to the other ethnies by which they are defined. 11 Most Irish emigrants to America left their native country at a time of agrar- ian upheaval and economic depression. The causes of Ireland's condi- tion generated passionate debate, which joined with other eighteenth- and nineteenth-century intellectual currents eventually to produce in literature and political rhetoric the idea of an Irish ethnie, a people with a history and culture distinctively different from those of their neighbours. The devel- opment of a cultural politics was not unique to Ireland, and as elsewhere in Europe crystallized into a nationalist movement whose proponents be- 12</page><page sequence="5">Ethnicity at the Limit lieved that it was the natural destiny of culture and polity to have the same boundaries. Nationalist sentiment in Ireland had a chequered history dur- ing the nineteenth century: sometimes rising to the surface, then falling out of public interest. Only at the very end of the century, and the be- ginning of the twentieth, did public sympathy with the nationalists' cause become widespread, and in the parliamentary general election of 1918 gather enough votes to give a popular mandate to the establishment of an independent Irish republic, so provoking a series of dramatic events that led to constitutional crisis and the dissolution of the Union with Great Britain in 1921. Yet, today, Ireland is stereotypically portrayed as being constantly on the brink of revolution throughout the nineteenth century. It seems nowa- days to be assumed that every immigrant from Ireland worthy of being regarded as truly and properly Irish was the embodiment of a distinctive, idealized national culture or ethnic type; that each was the innocent victim of deliberate oppression; and that all left Ireland against their will. The temptation to use exaggerated, over-generalizing, and morally-charged ideas of this kind to explain the nature of emigration and the character of Irish emigrants to America, and to interpret the ethnic identity of their descendants, has proved irresistible to scholars and popular writers on the Irish in America. These images of Irishness have influenced what research is done, where it is done, and how it is done. While much has been written recently about the 'Irish-American immigrant experience' and the 'cul- ture', 'ethnicity', and 'identity' of the current generations of Americans of Irish descent, remarkably few writers have looked beyond the nineteenth- century ethnic enclaves of New York, Boston, Philadelphia, or Chicago; or have asked how the notion of a distinctive Irish-American ethnic cul- ture in contemporary America can be reconciled with four, five, or six generations of intermarriage and assimilation over the last century and a half. This research project upon which this paper is based aimed to dis- cover in what senses and in what degrees the present-day descendants of nineteenth-century Irish immigrants possess distinctive beliefs and social practices, a goal which influenced the research methods that were used, what pieces of evidence were collected, and how they are analysed. The significance of this evidence was assessed by a kind of methodological triangulation, using historical, sociological, and anthropological ideas and procedures. The people whom we interviewed were the fourth-, fifth-, 13</page><page sequence="6">Reginald Byron and sixth-generation descendants of people who left Ireland and came to America in the mid- nineteenth century. Ill Like the people this research concerns, I am a fourth-generation Amer- ican, the descendant of mid-nineteenth immigrants. My family name is one that occurs in Ireland. My other great-grandparents were crofters and fisherfolk from the west coast of Scotland, many of whom were forced off their smallholdings by agrarian reform and then tried to make a living in the highly-unstable inshore fishery; another branch of the family were people of farming stock from rural Wiltshire who could not find enough land in their crowded native villages. Another set of great-grandparents were immigrants from Silesia, a former German-speaking province east of the Oder River (now in Poland) which was at the centre of territory disputed by Prussia, Austria, and Russia; speaking the wrong language or professing the wrong religion for whatever ethnie was proclaimed to be the correct one in the place where they had lived for generations, they moved west by degrees across Europe and then emigrated to the United States. Some of my ancestors were Catholics, and some were Protestants. They settled all over the country, and like most American families, moved around quite a lot. My mother's family moved from Michigan in 1922 to live on a farm near Albany, a place that is still connected with the family, and nowadays, after thirty years of living abroad, it is my home away from home. Since 1970, I have lived in the British Isles, first as a graduate stu- dent in London, and then a teacher of social anthropology. Fifteen of these years were spent in Ireland. After a twenty-year absence, pursu- ing research interests unconnected with North America, on a brief visit to Albany in 1989 I was struck by its Irishness, something that I had never before really noticed. As a child and young person growing up in Amer- ica, I had never been conscious of my ancestral background, nor that of those around me. While my friends had names like Herlihy, Holtermann, Maitrejean, Renzetti, Axelsson, and Greenberg, they were just like me. Their homes, and what went on inside them, were as familiar to me as my own. I do not think I even knew which of my friends were Catholic and which were Protestant, although I was aware that one or two were Jewish because they kept different religious holidays. On St Patrick's Day, I wore 14</page><page sequence="7">Ethnicity at the Limit something green to school, like everyone else. It was merely something that we did without asking why, like exchanging cards on St Valentine's Day. My years of living in a divided part of Ireland, where people were ex- tremely sensitive to cultural and political nuance and varieties of Irishness, and where Irishness itself was a concept contested in the streets with flags, banners, parades, stones, bullets, and bombs, brought home to me the sig- nificance of ethnic difference and the sometimes tragic consequences of nationalist passion in ways that I had never experienced in America. And when those of my students who had spent summers working in Atlantic City, New Jersey in the late 1980s asked me, as an American, why peo- ple they had met in America said they were Irish too, even though it was clear that these people had been Americans for generations, I began to be intrigued. At first, I intended only to write an lecture or two about this phenomenon. I soon discovered, much to my surprise, that there was little scholarly literature upon which I could base a lecture. What academically- respectable literature I was able to unearth in Ireland by Irish and Amer- ican authors concerned nineteenth-century Irish immigration to America and was largely historical. Anthropological and sociological accounts of contemporary Irishness in America were scarce, patchy, fragmentary, and entirely restricted to the ethnic enclaves of the big industrial cities. It became clear that if I wanted to learn about Irishness in contemporary America beyond the big-city ghettos, I would have to go there and find out for myself. It has been a very odd and at times distinctly uncomfortable feeling, doing anthropological research among my own kind; the sort of people among whom I grew up. Try as I might, I have been unable to think of them as 'the Other': they are me, and I am them. Nor have I been able to recognize myself, as a fourth-generation American who can claim attach- ment to any of three or four 'diasporic cultures' which have no practical and scarcely any symbolic meaning to me (in fact I was almost completely unaware that I belonged to some of them before beginning this piece of research), in what is now being imputed about the nature of my 'ethnic- ity' and 'identity' by my scholarly colleagues. Did the social worlds of people like me really change during my 20-year absence from the United States, such that they are now more ethnic than they used to be, and have clearer senses of how their social identities are connected with their im- migrant ancestors' origins? Or have the scholarly theories and modes of 15</page><page sequence="8">Reginald Byron ethnographic and historiographie representation which have come to pre- vail over other paradigms during that interval had the unintended and un- seen effect of inflating what few small and vestigial differences remain: in order, perhaps, to fill the voids newly created by the politics of multicul- turalism? It seemed important to try to resolve this question, and I chose to do so by taking an approach that owes little to recent theoretical fash- ion. In assigning primacy to systems of meaning that, it is claimed, are shared among the people concerned (as they must be if they are to consti- tute vital aspects of their 'culture') the culturalist or interpretivist approach prejudges fundamental sociological and historical questions, and makes it difficult or impossible to ask whether culture - thus understood - actually matters: to whom, in what degree, and why. Rather than starting from a point which assumes that every 'member of the culture' is its bearer and shares its implicit meanings, I have taken a broadly organizational ap- proach, asking how those qualities that are commonly regarded as being diacritical of Irishness, and which can be measured, are distributed among people who are descended from Irish immigrant ancestors. This approach, it seems to me, at least has the advantage of inviting inspection of the ev- idence for the general validity of what is being argued. Because of my experience of the contested nature of Irishness in Ireland, I was careful to make no a priori assumptions about what constituted the Irishness I might find in Albany, or who might qualify as 'Irish', things which most of the writers on the Irish in America that I had read did not seem to regard as being at all problematic. The propensity for most writers on the Irish in America to see Irish- ness as culture, or to view Irish-Americans as an ethnic group, provokes the search for typicalities in order to validate the writer's initial assump- tion that they are culturally or socially distinct. For without such typi- calities, the notions of 'culture' or 'ethnicity' cannot be sustained: the epistemological foundation of these concepts rests upon the possibility of generalization and its intellectual procedure: it demands the identification of a set of phenotypical traits by which the cultural species in question may be recognized and classified as distinct from all others in the museum col- lection. Under such pressure, the notion of typicality is not infrequently stretched beyond credulity. The term comes to mean something other than the middle part of a statistical curve of distribution: what most people say and do most of the time. Rather, it comes to rest on exampling, conve- nient illustration, anecdote, or so-called 'thick description'. Measurement 16</page><page sequence="9">Ethnicity at the Limit is obscured or omitted, the pursuit of generality is abandoned, and any instance or episode of the phenomenon in question (whose typicality the reader is given no means of judging) may be used to justify the analyst's contention that these characteristics constitute distinctive ethnies, cultures, communities, symbolic and cognitive systems, or social identities. IV Five generations have passed since the ancestors of the current genera- tions of Americans of Irish descent arrived in America. Their descendants are now thoroughly assimilated Americans. In their everyday private lives, few traces remain of their Irish immigrant great-great-grandparentage. For most, and for 90 percent of the fifth generation, their connections with the Famine refugees of the mid-nineteenth century have become increasingly distant and uncertain, as their own and previous generations married peo- ple of other European ancestries, and as they married the descendants of Irish immigrants who had arrived in America before the Great Famine (1845-49), or much later. Many of our informants had lost touch, through their genealogical knowledge, with that fateful moment in history a cen- tury and a half ago (the years 1847 to 1854 accounted for 20 percent of all Irish emigration the America in the nineteenth century); and how, if at all, they were connected to it. Two-thirds had an incomplete knowl- edge of the basic details of their grandparents' biographies which took them back to the beginning of the twentieth century or the end of the nine- teenth, and fewer still were able to account for their great-grandparents and great-great-grandparents a half-century earlier, knowing when their Irish ancestors left the old country, and why. Until recently, this kind of backward-looking knowledge was clearly unimportant to most people. The previous generations were not especially interested in where their an- cestors had come from, or when, but rather in making lives for themselves and investing in the future through their children. There was nothing to be gained by looking back, and there was no practical use to which such knowledge could be put. Nonetheless, most of our informants were conscious of being of Irish ancestry, and there were occasions when they still felt Irish, displayed their Irishness, and did self-consciously Irish things even if this was only to wear something green on St Patrick's Day. Much of this was related to the particular social milieu of Albany, where being of Irish descent and being 17</page><page sequence="10">Reginald Byron a Catholic are so common that they are firmly tied together in the popular imagination. While the conjuncture of these two things, along with being a Democrat, is the consequence of local historical circumstance, the ideas people had about themselves were not necessarily backward-looking, and usually were not. For the majority of our informants, it was enough to know that being of Irish ancestry made one normal, like most other peo- ple, a part of the fully-assimilated, old-stock European majority in Albany society, and signified little more than this. Until the 1924 Immigration Act required the census bureau and the immigration service to set quotas related to the American population as it was then constituted, little effort had been made to determine the ancestral composition of the American population. No question on place of birth was asked until the census of 1850. The second generation, whatever their parents' origins, were merely recorded as native-born until 1880, when they were asked whether they had foreign-born parents and if so where they had been born. No question would be asked about the grand- parentage of the third generation for another century, by which time the older-stock ancestries who had arrived by 1850 were already into the fifth or sixth generation and beyond. And, no question on religion was ever asked, or would be asked in a U. S. Census. When the American Council of Learned Societies was commissioned to prepare its report on the U. S. population in 1790, it was required to differentiate within the immigrant flow from Ireland. The only possible motive there could have been for this requirement was to distinguish between Irish Catholics (who were presumed to have come from Leinster, Munster and Connaught) and Irish Protestants (who were presumed to have come from Ulster). There being no direct evidence about this, the ACLS had use indirect evidence; but in order to determine how to proceed, it had to have a working definition of what we would nowadays call 'ethnicity'. The ACLS used the notion of 'national character', commonplace at the time, which did not distinguish between race and culture, but treated loyalty to faith and custom as facts of nature inherent in bonds of blood and descent from common origins, as if they were inherited traits of the same order as skin colour or hair tex- ture. In accepting the report, the United States government thus endorsed as authoritative a definition of 'ethnicity' based upon primordialism - that membership of an ethnic community is the consequence of the facts of birth - and in so doing entered the arena of modern American ethnic pol- itics extraordinarily ill-equipped tó perceive its sociological realities. 18</page><page sequence="11">Ethnicity at the Limit The civil rights debates of the 1950s and 1960s, since they eventu- ally became reduced to skin colour - an inherited physical trait - as the defining characteristic of those suffering the most grievous political dis- advantage and social alienation from the American Dream, was so easily accommodated within the primordialist interpretation of ethnicity already accepted by the federal authorities that it appeared to confirm its valid- ity as a general principle and to justify its extension into other realms of American life. The essentializing idea that ethnicity is unambiguously and unalterably fixed by ancestry eventually came to underpin official policies on multiculturalism and equal opportunities. Thus one can read in a con- temporary American manual on hiring practices: "For the purposes of this discussion we will define primary dimensions of diversity as those immutable human differ- ences that are inborn and/or that exert an important impact on our early socialization and an ongoing impact throughout our lives. . . . Listed in alphabetical order, they are: (1) Age. (2) Ethnicity. (3) Gender. (4) Physical abilities/qualities. (5) Race. (6) Sexual/affectional orientation."5 Ethnicity, thus defined, is concerned only with the category itself and the criterion of belonging to it, and not - at least initially - with its content. The categorical boundary may be imposed from the top down, as a matter of official policy; if so, it is not a matter of self-definition by the group or, necessarily, the product of negotiation with its members (for no such category may have existed as a coherent social group in advance of its official definition); nor is it the product of negotiation between groups in a Barthian sense. The boundary encloses all those who are defined as having inherited membership of it through birth. Ethnicity, thus under- stood as an ascriptive phenomenon which merges genetics and culture, cannot cope comfortably with the problems of ambiguity, choice, or de- nial. It is an astonishing reversal of ideology that the country which re- garded itself a melting pot, and which for generations encouraged its citi- zens to slough off their attachments to their foreign origins and to become unethnic Americans, should now require its citizens to belong, at least nominally, to a set of officially-defined, primordial, quasi-racial ethnies. Nowadays, in the interests of even-handed, egalitarian multiculturalism, 5 M. Loden and J. Rosener, quoted in K. Verdery, 'Ethnicity, Nationalism, and State- making', 53. 19</page><page sequence="12">Reginald Byron American schoolteachers not uncommonly ask children to say what they 'are' (not merely to say what their immigrant ancestors' origins were a century ago), forcing them to identify with an ethnie, no matter how irrel- evant such a question might be to the child's circumstances or complicated or indeterminate their ancestry. Teachers rely on manuals and textbooks to tell the children about 'their traditions' and 'their history' which they are presumed to have inherited along with their skin and hair colour, books which are authorized for use in publicly-funded classrooms by state leg- islatures and local school boards. These interpretations of 'culture', and 'history' are, then, subject to political definition and surveillance. Arguably, contemporary ethnic politics has had the effect, intended or not, of creating cleavages and deepening differences in the American social fabric. New ethnies have been defined which would have been scarcely recognizable to the ancestors of most present-day generations of Americans, since more often than not they are based on boundaries of inclusion and exclusion that are not congruent with those which had significance to the first generations of immigrants to America, one, two, or three centuries ago; and in any event for a large part of the European- ancestry population have become obscured and all but erased by subse- quent generations of intermarriage. Once the boundaries encompassing these new ethnies came to be defined by the continent, region, or the mod- ern nation-state encompassing the place of one's ancestors' birth, the void thus created within these boundaries demanded to be filled with cultural stuff; with moral content; with stories. "Multiculturalism tends to become a form of identity poli- tics, in which the concept of culture becomes merged with that of ethnic identity. From an anthropological standpoint, this move, at least in its more simplistic ideological forms, is fraught with dangers both theoretical and practical. It risks essentializing the idea of culture as the property of an ethnic group or race; it risks reifying cultures as separate entities by overemphasizing their boundedness and mutual distinctness; it risks overemphasizing the internal homogeneity of cultures in terms that potentially legitimate repressive demands for communal conformity."6 6 T. Turner, 'Anthropology and Multiculturalism: What is Anthropology That Multi- culturalists Should Be Mindful of It?', 411-412, quoted in G. Baumann, Contesting Culture, 20. 20</page><page sequence="13">Ethnicity at the Limit There is another risk: the politics of multiculturalism encourages competi- tion between ethnies : in practice, as the game has been played, those who can sustain their claims to have endured the most suffering and injustice by presenting the most persuasive stories through their ethnic advocates have won the contests for recognition and special treatment. The success of some claims has not been lost on all those other players seeking to ad- vance their interests or even just to avoid losing ground relative to the rest. There are points to be scored for being a wronged and exploited minority, but none for being part of the comfortably middle-class majority. Political expediency thus influences what stories come to fill the space within the ethnic boundaries. Five generations is a long time, long enough for most people to have lost touch with distantly-removed branches of their families in the United States, much less with even more distant relatives in Ireland, if any still remain. For many of our informants, a knowledge of who their Irish an- cestors were, where they lived, whether they were the landless poor from the rocky Atlantic shores of Donegal or Mayo or the middle ranks of the yeomanry from the rich fields and pastures of Down or Wexford; whether they were Famine refugees escaping poverty and pestilence; or whether they were surplus daughters their fathers were shipping off to New York to avoid paying a dowry or the social embarrassment of a 'wrong' (i.e., down-the-social-scale or religiously-mixed) marriage, or sons impatient with the prospect of remaining unmarried and having to work as unpaid farm hands until their forties or fifties when their fathers chose to retire and hand over the house and farm; or whether they were simply seeking the promise of the American Dream like so many other European immigrants of the time, is knowledge which is now lost to their descendants. Our informants' understandings of the past may or may not have had much relationship to the stories their ancestors might have told. These under- standings varied from one informant to the next; they were a jumble of the particular and the general, of fragments of actual events in Irish his- tory and the nation-building rhetoric of the nineteenth century, together with ideas drawn from panegyric popular histories, fiction, film, televi- sion, schoolroom projects, museum displays, and theme days. Contem- porary public debate about multiculturalism in North America has given a great deal of impetus to the creation and revitalization of folk images and scholarly interpretations of Irishness: and especially to certain kinds of images and interpretations. 21</page><page sequence="14">Reginald Byron For people of Irish ancestry, simply being an American and climbing the ladder of success, that which their great- grandparents strove for and achieved by putting a stony, no-hope farm in County Clare behind them, is today no longer enough, it seems. Since the 1970s, with public debates about multiculturalism, everyone has come to be regarded as needing 'an ethnic identity'. Compared with previous generations, consciousness of ancestry has become heightened and people have been goaded into taking an interest in their ethnic heritage: the cultural stuff of being Irish. As a consequence of this awakening of interest, as well as the creation of demand through its own dynamics, an entire industry has developed which supplies a surfeit of ready-made, off-the-shelf stories and pictures of the past, amongst which the consumer may browse, that satisfy the curiosity that anyone of Irish ancestry might have about the immigrant experience, about what happened in Ireland, and about Irish traditions. Like written- to-a-formula airport novels, some of these stories sell rather better than others. Those which contrive to pluck at the emotional heartstrings are always among the best-sellers. For the Irish, the cultural space newly authorized by multiculturalism was quickly filled. The materials already existed to transform the bare fact of Irish ancestry into the cultural stuff of Irish ethnicity. A useful, if dated, model of ethnic Irishness was close at hand, and so was its cultural stuff. The waves of religious, linguistic, economic, and political transformation reached Ireland in her island fastness on the western edge of Europe af- ter they had swept across the rest of the continent, arriving late enough that the traumas of modernization were entering their most painful and politically-difficult phase when a new idea, that of the nation, appeared in Europe at the end of the eighteenth century. Irish society had already become complex and highly differentiated, but the main thing most of the population still had in common that was distinctively different from the English, and eventually came to form the cultural foundation of a new na- tion, was their religion. The notion of Celticness, a racial metaphor, came to embody the sectarian division of Ireland into those who saw themselves as the natural inheritors of her history and native traditions, and those who were seen as invaders and despoilers. The idea of an Irish ethnie, based upon primordial attachments, had been forged in the crucible of Irish na- tionalism by more than a hundred years of political persuasion and intel- lectual industry. The battle for Irish independence was won in 1920; a half-century later 22</page><page sequence="15">Ethnicity at the Limit these ideas were beginning to gather dust when the need for a primordial Irish ethnie, pictured as a wronged and exploited underclass, arose again in the United States in the 1970s. The sectarian, quasi-racial, nineteenth- century nation-building image of the Irish as Celts, Catholics, and chil- dren of the Famine was dusted off and resurrected as the definition of 'true' Irishness, and its stories - written for a particular political purpose in another country in another century - were likewise dusted off and sup- plemented by home-grown tales of the hardships and homesickness of the first generation of Irish Catholic immigrants in America's big-city en- claves. In much the same way that ethnic advocates have found that plead- ing past suffering and injustice wins political points, heritage-industry entrepreneurs have discovered that adversity and tragedy, like romance, is a winning formula for selling stories to a public presumed to be hun- gry for knowledge of who they are in this multicultural world, a world in which everyone must now have 'a history', 'a culture' and 'an ethnic iden- tity', however and by whomever contrived, from whatever motives. Ethnic politicians and heritage-industry businesspeople alike have an interest in raking over the past and turning over the mossiest of stones to find win- ning stories which have clear moral messages. Under one of these mossy stones was John Mitchel's hyperbolic dramatization of the Famine, the tale of a cruel and calculating tyrant (Britannia) and an innocent and pitiable victim (Erin): a story that succeeds brilliantly in anthropomorphizing and embellishing historical contingency, and in transforming impersonal, un- intended, and unconnected events into a seamless moral epic: a just-so story with all the makings of a modern myth.7 That ten percent of Ireland's population was lost in the fearful and fate- ful calamity of the Famine which it was the misfortune of Ireland to bear 7 John Mitchel (1815-1875) was a journalist, pamphleteer, demagogue, and radical Young Irelander. It is to Mitchel's mid-nineteenth century oratory and polemical tracts that we can trace the politicization of the Great Famine, and the emotive claim that the Great Famine was, if not deliberately planned and provoked by the English, then simply allowed to happen while the British government did nothing, a charge that was subsequently incorporated into nationalist rhetoric and eventually into twentieth- century Irish- American folklore. Echoes of Mitchel's claim that the English starved the Irish out of their homeland by malign intent or culpable inactivity can still be found in recent American scholarly accounts of the Irish in America. Yet, remarkably, such sentiments are largely if not entirely absent from most recent accounts of the Great Famine by Irish historians. 23</page><page sequence="16">Reginald Byron with such severity, and that some Irish immigrants to America were mal- treated just as the Italians who followed them were maltreated by earlier arrivals in America (including the Irish themselves) are facts that are be- yond question. But it is equally indisputable that ninety percent survived the Famine, and that most of those who came to America as wholly un- remarkable economic migrants - who were 80 percent of the immigrant flow from Ireland to America in the nineteenth century8 - found what they were looking for, succeeded as well as any, made more rapid gains than non-English speakers arriving at the same time from Germany, Italy, Poland, and elsewhere, and over the generations have merged completely into the lace-curtain American ascendancy. The Irish historian Mary Daly has observed that: "The Great Famine is arguably the only event in modern Irish history to have achieved widespread international recogni- tion. The steady sales of Cecil Woodham-Smith's The Great Hunger, which has been in print for more than thirty years, testify to a continuing wish to be informed about this crisis. The more recent runaway success of the spurious Famine Diary - allegedly the diary of school teacher Gerald Kee- gan who emigrated with his wife to Canada on a 'coffin ship' where both died of fever - and its continuing sales de- spite being revealed as a piece of late nineteenth-century Canadian-Irish fiction - suggest a strong desire to wallow in its emotional horrors, perhaps at the cost of a wider under- standing. For some U. S. and Canadian citizens of Irish de- scent the Famine is in danger of becoming their answer to the Jewish Holocaust: evidence that the Irish too are a nation of victims, a causal explanation for mass emigration and a symbol of national unity. With the sesquicentennial of the Famine in 1995 and the promises of Famine walks, Famine museums and the commemoration of Famine-era graveyards 8 According to Blessing's figures, 3,785,222 immigrants from Ireland arrived in the United States from 1820 through 1899. Those arriving during the Famine and its immediate aftermath, from 1847 through 1854, totalled 1,186,928. One must, how- ever subtract from this the number of immigrants would might reasonably have been expected to arrive had it not been for the Famine. This is estimated at 50,000 per year, which was the level seen immediately before the Famine, and which followed from 1855 onward. See P. J. Blessing, The Irish in America, 289. 24</page><page sequence="17">Ethnicity at the Limit the Famine seems set to become a part of the Irish heritage industry."9 The anthropomorphic interpretation of the Famine, as the event that is popularly believed to have caused the Irish diaspora, has assumed mythic status and now informs most people's understandings of the 'immigrant experience'. Like other myths, its relationship to history and social orga- nization is problematic: it is only partly related to reality. It is an allegory that invites us to consider how something that does not exist except as a nominal abstraction and might never have existed in the other America beyond the first-generation big-city immigrant ghetto - an Irish- American ethnie - can be represented in our imagination. It is a means by which we can begin to understand how people whose repertoire of social practices from one year to the next is in their own estimations in no way Irish, who are several generations removed from anyone who ever lived in Ireland, and whose genealogies might reveal them to be mostly German or English, can nonetheless feel the emotional tug of being Irish for an hour, a day, or a lifetime. That the arresting imagery of this picture is the very opposite of social and historical reality, and stands in a dialectical relationship to it, adds to its power to command our attention. V It is conventional, but probably an anthropological conceit, to say that ev- eryone need myths. It may be that people need ideals, things to believe in, and stories about the worlds they inhabit that provide more-or-less sat- isfying explanations, but these do not necessarily have to be culturally- specific parables which reach back into the past. Our informants' parents and grandparents looked to the future, to the day their children and grand- children attained the American Dream. The dream may have turned to dust for some Americans, but for millions of descendants of European immigrants there was suburban middle-class respectability at the end of the rainbow and the Melting Pot was, and is, most certainly not a myth but the everyday moral project of past and current generations. Multi- culturalismi has brought about a new kind of project and has opened up a bourgeoning market in politicized and manufactured heritage: both have produced essentializing myths. In place of the variety of views of the 9 M. Daly, 'Revisionism and Irish History: The Great Famine', 71. 25</page><page sequence="18">Reginald Byron world as their ancestors actually experienced it, as it was related to their time, place, and individual social circumstances, we now have 'a diasporic culture': mass-produced, standardized, pre-packaged, one-size-fits-all. Myths fill a need. That need should not be ridiculed or disparaged. But we might question why some myths take the form they do, and wonder why they have done so, and in whose political or economic interest it is to create or perpetuate certain kinds of stories. As scholars, we have a duty to distinguish between those ideas whose epistemological status derives from serious scholarship and demonstrable and measurable evidence; and those which merely reify hackneyed, essentializing myths. It is ironic that as Irishness has dimmed and disappeared in everyday social practice, it should now be reinvented as 'social memory', 'shared identity', and 'collective self-image'. Tradition needs to be preserved in a condition of post-traditionality, or it fades away. As traditions are no longer nourished in families, they no longer have a life of their own ex- cept through their inscription in best-selling stories and their embodiment in museum displays and theme days. Most of the people we interviewed knew something about Ireland and Irishness, and a very large proportion of our informants had made visits to their ancestors' homeland. But the evidence of a shared social memory of the immigrant experience in our informants' accounts, as something that binds them together as a col- lectivity, is exceedingly equivocal, and raises searching methodological questions about what counts as social memory or self-image and how one establishes that these things are shared to the extent that one can speak of them as 'collective'. There was wide variation among our informants in their accounts of their Irishness. Which of them should we have chosen as the exemplar, had we had decided to proceed by ignoring the sociological questions of who and in what degree, giving the reader only convenient illustration, or 'thick description'? Their accounts were differently struc- tured; some derived from personal experience, others from the experiences of other people they knew, still others from abstractions and beliefs not rooted in the experience of anyone whom they knew but were nonetheless taken to be evidence of something significant, real, and true. Much the same can be said of their social practices. How is such wide variation to be regarded as evidence of 'a shared culture'? Or as informing 'the eth- nic identity' of individuals? One suspects that it is simply because, as the storytellers, we say so. We have taken it as our task to discover what lies within the space bounded by the idea of 'Irish-American ethnicity'. But if 26</page><page sequence="19">Ethnicity at the Limit we do not question the legitimacy of the category by critically examining the nature of its boundaries, how they have been defined, by whom and for what purpose, as well as what happens at the boundary-zone and beyond, we merely create that which we are looking for as a consequence of our scholarly practice. Only a handful of our informants were sufficiently interested in their ancestry or ethnicity that one might have said that their 'identity' as Irish- Americans had some everyday importance to them. The assumption that everyone is interested in their ethnic identity, or that despite the strident demands of multiculturalism that they have the wish, or the means, to assign themselves to a single ethnie is not unambiguously borne out by our findings in Albany. That we were a research team from Ireland inter- ested in their Irish connections and their sense of Irishness undoubtedly influenced what our informants told us. There is no reason to think that someone half Irish and half German might not have said very different things had we been a research team from Germany. What is now understood to be Irish-American ethnicity is a creoliza- tion of Irish and American history and popular culture produced in the rough and tumble of American pluralism and multiculturalism, and has probably taken different twists and turns in different places across the country over the last century and a half. We are now in danger of losing all this richness of variety as understandings about 'Irish ethnicity' and 'the immigrant experience' settle into rigid, iconic shapes which canalize and constrain the way that Irish-Americanness is represented, authorizing - even sacralizing - some ideas and interpretations and condemning others as 'revisionism'. The commonplace, increasingly standardized and essen- tialized stereotypes of Irishness held by Americans, including their inter- pretations of the Famine, have been exported across the Atlantic along with bagels, baseball, and St Patrick's Day parades (complete with cheer- leaders and marching bands) and are now repackaged and sold back to Americans as 'heritage' when they visit Ireland. Providing for Ameri- can and Canadian tourists is one of Ireland's biggest and most impor- tant industries and sources of dollar revenue. Nothing is left to chance: the national tourist board and private entrepreneurs in Ireland do highly- professional market research and know what North Americans want to see and hear, which stories and pictures are acceptable and saleable and which are not; a brief package tour of Ireland is therefore much less likely disturb North American preconceptions than to reinforce them. 27</page><page sequence="20">Reginald Byron Although Albany is as Irish a place as one might expect to find out- side the big-city enclaves, in many respects it is less markedly Irish than one might have anticipated from the way Irish-Americanness is portrayed in much of the scholarly literature. A view of Irishness from the van- tage point of Murphy's Tavern, or the folk music scene, as seen through the eyes of people who were especially conscious of their Irishness and were involved in Irish- American affairs, would have been very different. Had we limited our horizons in this way, it would not have been diffi- cult to have sustained a plausible argument that Irishness was undimmed by a century and a half of social change, though its contemporary man- ifestations might perhaps have taken different forms. But the world of the self-conscious Irishness of the few would not have been the world of the many: the other ninety percent of Albany's residents, who have an equal - or even stronger - claim upon descent from the Famine-era im- migrants, but soon left their Irishness behind as they began to succeed in climbing the ladder of the American Dream, never to look back. After the passage of five or six generations of assimilation and in- termarriage, Irishness, for most people, is already a virtual ethnicity, no longer a lived reality: a composed and constructed one consisting of a contrived categorical boundary containing idiosyncratic individual collec- tions of bits and pieces, highly variable in provenance, quality, and quan- tity. Like a reversible T-shirt saying 'Irish for a Day' on one side and 'Ku mich, ich bin Schwabe' on the other that one can keep in a bottom drawer, and put on when the mood takes one, or as the occasion warrants, such manifestations of ethnicity are not very demanding to maintain, take up very little space in one's wardrobe of understandings, beliefs, and social practices, and might still come in useful now and again.
