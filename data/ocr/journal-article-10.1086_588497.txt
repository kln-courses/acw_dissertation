         <p>This is a story about the way colonialism shapes the symbolism of the societies it dominates and about the possibility of contesting and transforming colonial meanings. It is centered on the way the colonial historical apparatus works. Its main actors are a North Andean native community, archaeological practice, and historical discourses of several kinds. We contend that the past is a rhetorical space full of changing meanings that are situational and played out in terms of identity. These general assertions are better seen if grounded in particular cases. Ours come from Colombia.</p>
         <p>The conception of the past of the indigenous communities of Andean southwestern Colombia was shaped by the Spanish conquest,<sup>1</sup> especially by the generalized ideological (and physical) violence exercised by the Catholic Church. Although we will never know how those communities conceived of their pasts before European colonization, we can at least argue that Catholicism condemned the preconquest era in terms of the moral evolutionism that underlay its project of civilization and that the ancestors of those communities were included in that condemnation. The pejorative treatment of past inhabitants (not just <italic>others</italic> but also the communities’ own ancestors, in other words, <italic>the ancestors turned others</italic>) is typical wherever colonial domination occurs. Colonial domination sometimes destroys local histories (and their associated paraphernalia, such as shrines and votive items) and their historians (by physical destruction or rhetorical repression). It also creates histories anew by imposing new beginnings and condemning any time before those beginnings. This rupture of historical continuity is a powerful strategy for neutralizing local histories because it replaces their myths of origin with a new one, that of civilization.</p>
         <p>The history imposed by the conquerors does not simply erase the history of the conquered but distorts, conflates, and confuses it. Colonialism constructs more than it destroys, and this construction is insidious and far more effective than simple destruction; the symbolic universe of the conquered takes a new form. The historical disciplines further this process. Archaeology, for instance, contributes to the alienation of native histories by severing the ties between contemporary indigenous societies and the material referents that expert knowledge groups under the term “the archaeological record.” It does so in two ways: by neglecting indigenous meanings and by appropriating those referents for a collective history (usually referred to as “national”) that celebrates the native societies of the past while despising their contemporary counterparts.</p>
         <p>One of the consequences of this process is that some indigenous societies (specifically, we will argue, those subjected to the domination of the Catholic Church) fear the material referents linked to their forebears that archaeologists call “archaeological materials.” This fear is translated into neglect and proscription, creating the curious situation in which empowered native communities explicitly interested in historical matters disregard archaeological sites and materials. The interpretation and, eventually, the overcoming of this contradiction is the main purpose of this paper. Although it can be argued that the indigenous communities that were brought under the colonial yoke possessed theories of otherness and that those theories may have included dichotomous classifications of self and other akin to those of the West (that is, the self as civilized, primordial, and exemplary and the other as barbaric, referential, and negative), their perception of their own pasts as uncivilized and negligible is the product of colonialism. This perception is now being contested and subverted by native political and cultural empowerment, with the result that what was previously feared and proscribed (the ancestors and their material referents) now assumes a positive valuation. We will discuss this process by showing how the Nasa, one of the most numerous and empowered contemporary native societies in Colombia, are contesting and transforming colonial‐national history through the resignification of material referents (archaeological materials, especially stone statues, until recently ignored, neglected, or proscribed because of colonial symbolism), systems of representation (archaeology, especially its denial of local meanings), and colonial categories (histories that created new beginnings and condemned old practices). The growing interest of a number of social actors in matters that historical experts (including archaeologists) have routinely considered their own has broadened the significance of the past with the inclusion of other worldviews and different projections of the present and the future. Local autonomies consecrated by constitutional reforms such as the one that took place in Colombia in 1991,2 reflecting ethnic agendas established well before multiculturalism became a state concern, are fostering the production of historical narratives and creating opportunities to resignify the past.</p>
         <p>Local historical narrative production, with its linkage to a deep sense of territorial belonging, as well as the native resignification of material referents long ignored, is a refurbished apparatus that confronts (but also uses) both Western constructions of the past and native histories that have become official through their association with ethnic political agendas and literacy. Through the case study of a Nasa community that was recently relocated to a new territory in which it “discovered” an archaeological site, we hope to show that the transformation of pervasive colonial meanings in the framework of local (in this case, ethnic) struggle for self‐determination can be assisted by public, reflexive, and committed archaeological practice. The argument thus comes full circle, but this time the circle is open. We begin by showing how colonialism transformed the history of an indigenous society and archaeology played a central role in that transformation; we then show how that history is being recast through the subversion of colonial meanings; and we end by showing that archaeology can abandon its long affiliation with colonialism to align itself with new historical meanings in the larger context of decolonization. This move of archaeology can be even more significant if we consider that in the postmodern era historical colonialism has added another, different layer of meaning to its operating machine: nowadays history itself is under attack by the supremacy of the present, and so is its potential for social resistance. Although postmodern logic does away with history (Jameson 1984; Lipovetsky 1990), a multitude of actors—social movements, class organizations, academics—opposes the devaluation of the meanings attributed to the past. This opposition is not uniform, stems from different interests, and places emphasis on a variety of potential referents. Social movements stand out as leaders of this opposition, searching for historical meaning as a form of utopian resistance, finding in history their origin and destiny, and appealing to it in various ways against (and despite) postmodern mandates: as cultural densification, reflection about times to come, and the construction of a social fabric. Thus history is deployed in action and an old drama is cast anew. A decolonized archaeology is committed to the vindication of the past as a fundamental source for the construction of social projects, and therefore we conclude with a discussion of the role of historical consciousness in postmodern times.</p>

         <title>The Nasa People</title>
         <p>Some 200,000 Nasa, whose relationship with the state (colonial and republican) has been marked by both capitulation and rebellion, live mostly in a region of the Andes of southwestern Colombia known as Tierradentro (fig. 1). In 1994 an earthquake shook the heart of their territory. Several communities were uprooted from their ancestral lands because of the destruction of agricultural fields and geological risk. A relocation effort was launched by the Colombian state with the aim of finding suitable lands for them. After some initial hesitation and difficult negotiations with the state‐run agency that directed the relocation, some 500 Nasa from Vitoncó accepted resettlement in an area around Santa Leticia, a small frontier town between the provinces of Cauca and Huila that lies outside current Nasa territory. They agreed to move after their <italic>the’walas</italic> (shamans) had given their approval on the basis of a sensorial survey.3 The new settlement was named after Juan Tama, an eighteenth‐century Nasa leader and a fundamental referent in Nasa history.4 Strengthening their sense of territorial belonging and ethnic consciousness has become an urgent matter for the resettled Nasa. In the new settlement the younger generation has conflicting feelings about ethnicity much more intense than those of their parents a few decades ago, when capitalism was encroaching upon their world and putting pressure on their ethnic identity.5 Moreover, overt conflict is more prevalent in the region around Santa Leticia than in the ancestral lands because the Juan Tama settlement is surrounded by mestizo peasants with different priorities and worldviews rather than by other <italic>resguardos</italic>.6 In such a situation a sense of territorial belonging can make a difference, becoming one of the bases of cultural life. Gómez and Ruíz (1997) have shown that for the Nasa territory is more than a spatial phenomenon; it is a dynamic social process resulting from multiple interactions (economic, ecological, political, cognitive, and symbolic) and the main locus of social memory.7 Territory is also history, and history is territory. According to Rappaport (1990, 9), the Nasa “have encoded their history of struggle in their sacred geography, so that past meets present in the very terrain on which they live, farm and walk.” Nasa history “behaves so dynamically that it is constantly being re‐created to validate contemporary actions. … Around the slightest physical event or social happening a local adaptation of the original version [of history] is inevitable. … Historical memory has been the cornerstone of territorial defense … and Páez8 [Nasa] ethnicity” (Gómez and Ruíz 1997, 132).<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg1" position="float" seq="1">

         <p>History is a model for the creation and revitalization of ethnic identity, which prominently includes the defense of territorial integrity. Autonomous development requires a competent reshaping of history. In this endeavor Nasa oral traditions have been fundamental in providing the basis for a pedagogical model that nurtures territorial meaning, interest in historical matters, and consciousness of self‐development. The relatively recent inception of an official native history has also been crucial in the revival of historical matters and the role accorded to that revival in the weaving of an empowered social fabric.</p>
         <p>In the forefront of Nasa ethnic empowerment has been the Cauca Regional Indigenous Council (CRIC), a powerful indigenous regional organization founded in 1971 on the basis of the experience of widespread peasant revolts. From its mostly Nasa origins, the CRIC eventually became a panethnic organization with strong influence on native national affairs. Its activities and accomplishments include the recovery of ancestral lands and languages, instruction in legal matters, bilingual education, the promotion of communal practices (economic, social), and historical revitalization.</p>
         <p>The transmission of history in ethnic communities has changed since the adoption of written communication and literacy as part of the political struggle for legitimacy and empowerment. Since the eighteenth century, political leadership has developed around cultural brokers, individuals capable of dealing with the colonial and republican authorities (Findji and Rojas 1985; Rappaport 1990). The perceived capabilities of those individuals have been based to a great extent on their reading and writing skills, notable in a basically illiterate society. Cultural legitimacy vis‐à‐vis the national state has been achieved since late colonial times in part by demonstrating the “factuality” of indigenous myths by providing written versions of otherwise “fictitious” oral accounts. Since the 1970s literacy has been widely promoted;9 a visible effect has been the promotion of a formerly unknown official native history, disseminated through school curricula, political instruction, journals, and pamphlets.</p>
         <p>This official history counters national history and plays a role that the state (colonial and republican) has condemned: serving as the basis for ethnic consciousness and mobilization. It has created a sense of community, a sort of national indigenous discourse, that goes beyond the borders of particular <italic>resguardos</italic> (Rappaport 2004). It stresses the importance of political heroes who fought for the Nasa. Those leaders left behind models for political action and, knowingly or not, a morality. The case of Quintín Lame, a native leader of the first half of the twentieth century, is illustrative in this regard. The political establishment, especially the leadership of the Quintín Lame10 guerrilla movement, made Lame one of the historical cornerstones of native insurgency (Espinosa 1996); this move sharply contrasts with the almost total neglect of him until the 1980s because of his marked religiosity. Juan Tama was also virtually forgotten or remembered and re‐created only locally11 until Lame’s (2004 [1971]) political manifesto, which recounts Tama’s legal struggle for colonial recognition of Nasa territory, made him the paramount historical referent of the Nasa.12 For good reason Lame’s manuscript is known as <italic>la doctrina</italic> (the doctrine). These leaders passed down what the current leadership interprets as rules to be followed. The 1971 CRIC political agenda closely follows the eighteenth‐century mandate of Juan Tama, reinterpreted two centuries later by Lame: the recovery of culture, language, and territory. Native official history is therefore a morality based on the political actions of great past leaders. Myths dealing with less decisive events have not been accorded the same importance,13 although they are constantly played out in many contexts. These myths, along with geographical features endowed with historical referents, remain the main historical repository of the Nasa.</p>
         <p>The official Nasa history and myths accord a central place to territory. Therefore it is not surprising that the Nasa communities that were relocated after the 1994 earthquake have strategically employed the relationship between history and territory to give meaning to a physical space that, at least in recent oral tradition, was not their own. Representations are re‐created according to ancestral worldviews and are articulated and adapted to provide a meaningful symbolic scheme for situational needs such as territorial expansion (Gómez and Ruíz 1997, 165, 193). In 1995, a year after the Juan Tama settlement had been established, one of us (Hernández) witnessed the confirmation of the mythical boundaries of the new area14 based upon Nasa social memory. Although the area was devoid of indigenous peoples in the eyes of Westerners until a decade ago, it is widely believed that this de facto extension of the pre‐1994 Nasa <italic>resguardos</italic> is a redrawing of the preconquest boundaries of Nasa territory (see Rappaport 1990, 29–30). The <italic>the’walas</italic>, elders, political officials (the governor and members of the <italic>cabildo</italic>, the corporate governing body), and members of the community walked the territory, finding similarities with their heartland in Tierradentro and recognizing points of reference mentioned in myths (notably a waterfall located to the west). While performing this symbolic appropriation of the new <italic>resguardo</italic> they came across La Candelaria, an archaeological site with stone statues (located in a narrow valley in the upper reaches of the Aguacatal River near Santa Leticia) until then overlooked by Nasa history. The stone carvings from the site were given mythical meaning. For instance, one carving was said to be the chair of Juan Tama (Gómez and Ruíz 1997, 196), and the site itself was declared ancestral land.15 Angel María Yoinó, a highly esteemed <italic>the’wala</italic>, claimed four years ago, recalling the discovery of La Candelaria, that the statues at the site<disp-quote>
               <p>take care of us and from now on we have to care for them, although we can’t reach out or can’t understand. If we the <italic>the’walas</italic> don’t get together we will never understand this way. We know that they loved and love us, so we must do the same, love and respect them. Stones have existed since the origin of the earth; they have been rearing us. We have been living for a long time, and so we have to remember our forebears, but we forget and don’t seem to remember them. But now that we have found them we must think with strength, walk with strength, and teach our grandkids. Only thus will we keep on living16</p>
            </disp-quote>The stones are, of course, more than just <italic>things</italic>. They are animate objects that evoke emotions and beings (forebears) that appeal to larger (and more permanent, although changing) structures of meaning. Such structures, for the most part mythically re‐created and displayed, link and transcend spatio‐temporal contingencies and allow new territories to be given meaning and appropriated by a sense of belonging.</p>
         <p>Mythical re‐creation has thus been basic to the way the relocated community has constructed its relationship with the new territory and given meaning to the archaeological site. The people of the Juan Tama <italic>resguardo</italic> have revitalized Nasa myths (still basically oral) that were displaced by the written official Nasa history. Nasa foundation myths stress the importance of water. The Nasa and the neighboring Guambianos and Yanaconas all consider themselves people of the water (Portela 2000). Water is a central element of Nasa history that “is constantly reinterpreted and validated from the starting point of the lakes as home” (Gómez and Ruíz 1997, 121). The annual “refreshment” of the staffs, symbols of political authority, takes place at Juan Tama Lake and represents the ancestral blessing of current officials. Juan Tama’s birth is also linked to water, along with the birth of other important caciques (chiefs). Stones are also important to the Nasa. St. Thomas, a prominent character in their mythology, is the stone incarnation of a powerful force related to earthquakes and the origin of the earth; he turned <italic>pijaos</italic> (enemies)17 into stone and lent his name to a stone that marks the boundary between two <italic>resguardos</italic>18 (Gómez and Ruíz 1997, 110). The transcriptions of traditional Nasa myths made by Yule (1993), a Nasa writer, and Segundo Bernal (1953), an anthropologist, make extensive reference to stones, albeit with strong Catholic symbolism (which, in fact, pervades Nasa mythology to this day). The myths related to the aquatic origin of the Nasa and their cultural heroes and those related to stones were prominently mentioned by the <italic>the’walas </italic>and the community in appropriating La Candelaria. This is not surprising, given that the site is located on the bank of a river and close to a waterfall and that its most prominent cultural features are stone carvings.</p>
         <p>This is a case of a varied mythical substratum’s surfacing in the midst of a native history made official (or unintentionally produced) by political and other needs. It indicates that ethnic agendas are neither homogeneous nor fully consensual, and it shows that myths both explain and act upon reality (Gómez and Ruíz 1997, 201). As an explanatory tool they provide order and meaning to past and current events, while as action they provide legitimacy to practices that regulate Nasa interaction with their territory and with other groups.</p>
         <p>The symbolic meaning attributed to La Candelaria by the Nasa resettled around Santa Leticia is a mélange of foundation myths and official narratives and shows that, no matter how codified, history is always in the making. What archaeologists call the archaeological record has been central to this process (figs. 2 and 3) as a tangible and motivational referent for reflection on temporality and cultural continuity. Yet until the appropriation of La Candelaria by the inhabitants of the Juan Tama settlement there were no records of Nasa relationships with the numerous archaeological remains that dot Tierradentro (mostly at San Andrés de Pisimbalá, where there are painted communal tombs and stone statues).19 Some three decades ago the archaeologist Gerardo Reichel‐Dolmatoff (1972a, 57; see also Gómez and Ruíz 1997, 155) noted that “many archaeological sites in Páez [Nasa] territory are still greatly feared … by the local Indians, who attribute them to the ancient <italic>pijao‐jaguars</italic>.” However, this situation is changing, and not just among the Nasa. Indeed, the Nasa mythological incorporation of La Candelaria may contribute to a change in the traditional relationship between native groups and archaeology in Colombia, which is still characterized by the hegemony with which the institutional establishment deals with indigenous peoples, archaeological material culture, and the contemporary contexts of its symbolic deployment and by native communities’ marked lack of interest (reinforced by social proscriptions) in archaeological remains. The rest of the paper is devoted to arguing that this lack of interest was a colonial creation and explaining how it is being transformed.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg2" position="float" seq="2">

         <title>Colonial‐National History and the Nasa</title>
         <p>La Candelaria, the archaeological site that the Nasa have built into their territorial and mythical symbolism, was unknown to Westerners until Henri Lehmann, a German‐born French archaeologist working for the newly established Institute of Ethnology of the Universidad del Cauca in Popayán, visited it in 1943. La Candelaria contained several stone statues amidst other remains such as dwelling terraces, channels, and pottery sherds. Lehmann noticed that these statues greatly resembled those of San Agustín, a well‐known site on the Upper Magdelena River, and decided to move three of them (fig. 4) to Popayán. Local excitement regarding the transportation of the statues was as might be imagined for a small, quiet, isolated Andean city six decades ago. The task was monumental, given that the dirt road that currently winds 3 km to the south of the site was just being built. However, Lehmann succeeded with the aid of several soldiers who built a trail and dragged the heavy statues 12 km over uneven terrain. The statues have remained ever since at the Universidad del Cauca—initially housed in the so‐called archaeological park in the main yard of the Santo Domingo cloister, then for more than two decades in the Mosquera Museum, and since 1989 in the Museum of Natural History.20 The local newspaper reported that the purpose of bringing the statues to Popayán was “salvaging an autochthonous monument of great value” (<italic>Liberal</italic> 1943, 1). Since their removal from the site, however, they have been little more than decorative items, sitting mute through the years. In their current location they bear no labels indicating their origin, age, or any other contextual markers; tourists who visit the museum rarely notice them and never ask about them.<fig-group content-type="figgrp" id="fg4" position="float" seq="4">

         <p>The stone statues of southwestern Colombia have fascinated travelers and archaeologists ever since they were first reported by a Spanish soldier in the sixteenth century. Especially fascinating have been those of the eastern flanks of the Andes commonly grouped under the label “San Agustín culture,” an umbrella name that covers several sites—including La Candelaria and nearby Agua Bonita, Yarumalito, and San José—sharing anthropomorphic statues with animal features such as feline fangs. Only a few reports concerning these statues were written in the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries (e.g., Codazzi 1959 [1857]; Caldas 1972 [1808]; Santa Gertrudis 1994 [1956]), and it was not until Konrad Theodor Preuss carried out the first archaeological research at the eponymous site of San Agustín in the 1920s that the first serious descriptions of them were made (Preuss 1974 [1931]). The majority of researchers considered the statues and associated material outside any contemporary cultural context, that is, simply as the remains of past peoples. There was no attempt to establish cultural continuities of any kind with extant societies. Nor was any consideration given to the use of current indigenous symbolism in the interpretation of the archaeological data. This approach made sense, however, in the light of a national project dating back to the middle of the nineteenth century, when the governing liberal elite attempted to build an inclusive national identity. In this nation‐building project contemporary Indians were a troublesome problem: while internal colonialism kept them subjugated and at a distance, nationalism demanded their rhetorical inclusion on the basis of an egalitarian ethic. This dilemma was resolved, to a great extent, by the adoption of pre‐Hispanic otherness as the cornerstone of national identity and the marginalization of contemporary indigenous societies.</p>
         <p>The pre‐Hispanic societies appropriated by the national identity were those deemed civilized such as the Muisca of the eastern highlands. A civilized society was a society with several decision‐making levels, institutional discriminations, a legal apparatus, religion, an army, and taxes—that is, a society different in degree but not in kind from contemporary European societies. In the mid‐nineteenth century Uricoechea (1984 [1854]) said that the Colombian nationality was based on the “nations” that peopled the Andean region, thus excluding the “barbaric” nomads of the lowlands. Building upon that logic, Law 89 of 1890, Colombia’s most fully developed legal statement regarding native communities until the 1991 Constitution, established a legal distinction between savages (basically lowlanders), to be tutored by the church, and civilized Indians (basically inhabitants of the Andes), to be ruled by the laws of the republic. This distinction was based on the Western dichotomy between sedentarism and nomadism that is central to the legal conception of territorial rights. By virtue of their designation as “civilized” on the basis of the archaeological evidence, the Muisca were discursively treated as an alterity writ “self.” This vindication of pre‐Hispanic civilizations contributed to the production of the civilization/barbarism dichotomy that still pervades the discourse of the Colombian state when dealing either with the ethnic other or with the guerrillas. This interest of Colombian archaeologists in civilization led them to pay disproportionate attention to monumental sites (Jaramillo and Oyuela 1994, 54).</p>
         <p>The division of otherness between past and present produced an indigeneity that was both present and absent, a dichotomy that fueled internal colonialism. As Fabian (1983) has shown, temporal distancing (allochronism) is one of the main discursive strategies for constructing alterity. The physical and typological time of archaeologists is used to naturalize their construction of an other effectively localized in another time, a time that has to be brought, by inclusion, into our time. Allochronism is a political cosmology (<italic>sensu</italic> Fabian 1983, 152), not an innocent disciplinary tool. The morality implied in allochronism produces a good past alterity and a bad present one. The location of conflict not in the past but in the present through the discursive degradation of the contemporaneous other explains the obsession of Colombian archaeologists with cultural discontinuities, catastrophes, and diffusion. Diffusionism is a central element in archaeology’s reproduction of internal colonialism even today. It writes the atemporal history of atemporal societies (Fabian 1983, 18) in terms of spatial and directional comparisons. Therefore, the determination of origins is more political than disciplinary (Pineda 1984, 202–3). For instance, the notion of a Mesoamerican or Peruvian origin for Colombian pre‐Hispanic societies helped to valorize the civilized other within and lent credence to Spanish and internal colonialisms that aimed to civilize the uncivilized other.</p>
         <p>Archaeology also helped to rationalize a divided alterity through catastrophism. Colombian archaeological discourse continually alludes to annihilation and disappearance: archaeological subjects (societies, cultures, even sherds) do not change but disappear. The disappearance of pre‐Hispanic societies implicit in catastrophism (involving invasions, migrations, and the like) implies their annihilation in time and space and their textual salvation (<italic>sensu</italic> Clifford 1986, 112)—a salvation that is neither social nor political. The “more advanced” pre‐Hispanic societies—those with metallurgy, statues, and large public works—were eliminated from the scene with catastrophic explanations and replaced by “backward” societies such as those of colonial and republican discourses about alterity. It is no accident that the genesis of civilization is usually linked to invading peoples who brought with them the gift of culture. Archaeological explanations mirrored colonial and republican policies toward the other. Through colonial relationships otherness was kept at a prudent distance. The marvels of pre‐Hispanic civilizations, written out of the historical scene with the stroke of the archaeologist’s pen, fell to barbaric invaders, the very people being colonized.</p>
         <p>The disappearance of civilized pre‐Hispanic societies recurs in the Colombian archaeological literature, which has acquired a seamless, almost atemporal narrative structure. The pre‐Hispanic groups whose disappearance is most notable are those of the Upper Magdalena River, where “civilized” but “lost” societies once crafted stone statues and built large earthworks. Five citations from different periods and contexts should suffice to illustrate this point. The scientist Francisco José de Caldas (1972 [1808], 116), visiting the region at the end of the eighteenth century, wrote: “[The Upper Magdalena] is inhabited by few Indian families, and there are evidences of an artistic and laborious nation that exists no longer.” Agustín Codazzi (1959 [1857], 420), an Italian engineer working for the Colombian government around 1850, reported that “manufacturing arts and a social culture [known to the Upper Magdalena societies] cannot be found amidst the barbaric remains of a now destroyed nation, nomadic and dispersed through the jungle.” Carlos Cuervo (1920, 228–30), an engineer and traveler at the turn of the twentieth century, said, “[These monuments] reveal in detail and construction a cultural level far superior to anything known in Colombia at the time of the conquest. … Therefore, we have to refer these monuments to an ancient time and to consider them as impassive remains of a people and civilization extinguished long ago.” The historian Juan Friede (1953, 116), said, “All this invites us to think that this Sculptor Society was sedentary and inhabited these territories for centuries. These qualities do not correspond to the primitive and unorganized tribes which peopled the Upper Magdalena at the time of the conquest.” Finally, the archaeologist Roberto Lleras (1995, 54) reported that “[in the reaches of the Upper Magdalena] Amazonian groups reclaimed for themselves what used to be the territories of the megalithic sculptors.” These five statements, although separated by more than 200 years, all argue the same idea: that the civilized sculptors of the Upper Magdalena (with whom the Colombian nation builders were eager to establish a rhetorical link) had been replaced by less developed, barbaric groups (excluded from that connection).</p>
         <p>In this context of denial of cultural continuity between past and present indigenous societies, it is not surprising that the connection between the stone statues of the Upper Magdalena and its contemporary native inhabitants was not just ignored but severed. Few archaeologists departed from this trend. Schottelius (1939) mentioned Chibcha mythology from the eastern highlands of Colombia to illustrate some motifs depicted in San Agustín’s iconography. Although he claimed that he was “confident to have demonstrated that the same religious ideas that informed the soul of the Chibcha from Cundinamarca and Boyacá [two Colombian provinces] were expressed in a people of the same or different race in San Agustín,” his mythological account is rather sketchy. Preuss’s (1974, [1931]) brief anecdotal references to indigenous mythologies in interpreting his San Agustín findings are even sketchier. Gerardo Reichel‐Dolmatoff, in contrast, in an essay devoted to the feline motif at San Agustín (1972<italic>a</italic>; see also 1972<italic>b</italic>, 83–113), effectively brought myths to bear on archaeological interpretation. Although he displayed vast knowledge of indigenous mythology from Mesoamerica to the Amazon, he began his argument with symbolism from the Nasa because they lived in Tierradentro (implying spatial contiguity) and because they preserved “many traits of the ancient belief system” (1972<italic>a</italic>, 54) (implying temporal continuity).21 Whether this statement is considered true or not is a matter of choice between essentialist and constructionist perspectives, but the fact is that Reichel‐Dolmatoff considered Nasa mythology a fundamental bridge for the cultural understanding of otherwise mute stone symbolism. In other words, he saw a cultural continuity between the makers of the statues and the current indigenous inhabitants of a nearby region.</p>
         <p>Paradoxically, and because of the enduring influence of the colonial apparatus (mostly of the church), the indigenous societies of Colombia and elsewhere have reproduced and helped to maintain the rupture of historical continuity instituted by most archaeologists and, in general terms, by the official history of the state with regard to native peoples. As have many other indigenous peoples, the Nasa have traditionally disregarded the archaeological record.22 This disregard has been used by some anthropologists (in a stunning example of tautological thinking) to argue that they are relative newcomers to the territory they now inhabit. As Miñana (1994, 14) argues,<disp-quote>
               <p>When the Spaniards arrived the <italic>Paeces</italic> [Nasa] were newcomers in the zone they occupy today, probably coming from the forest. … The archaeological remains found in their territories belong to other cultures. Oral tradition is conscious of this fact; the Nasa themselves talk generically about “<italic>pijao</italic>” burials and do not recognize them as their own.</p>
            </disp-quote>This behavior may seem surprising, given the Nasa’s strong involvement with the indigenous struggle, in which history is paramount, and given that the ancestors are central to their social life. Establishing historical continuity with the material remains of the area’s pre‐Hispanic populations would have provided good ammunition for territorial struggle and cultural revival, but until recently this was never attempted. The reason is clearly not lack of interest in historical matters. The indigenous movement considers the defense of native history one of its purposes (CRIC 1983, 5), the Nasa think of themselves as heirs of the past peoples of the region (Rappaport 1990, 18), and historical consciousness is one of the pillars of the Nasa worldview (Piñacué 1994, 27–29). References to ancient petroglyphs are common in two collections of Nasa myths and stories (Bernal 1953; Yule 1993). For instance, in a story called “The Defeated Chief” (Yule 1993, 59), a young Nasa chief “defends and demarcates the communal lands with writings on the stones against the Spanish invasions.” Therefore, as Rappaport (1990, 18) has indicated,<disp-quote>
               <p>The chains of transmission of the Paéz [Nasa] historical vision permit the drawing of a moral continuity between the precolumbian inhabitants of Tierradentro and the twentieth‐century population that lives there. … Whether or not they are the same group is immaterial: what matters is that they perceive this link as existing, and have fashioned their ideology so as to legitimize it.</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>A paradox is evident here: the Nasa claim descent from the pre‐Columbian inhabitants of Tierradentro, yet they have until very recently made no effort to infuse the pre‐Hispanic material culture found in their territory with local historical meaning or to reclaim it from state control23 as has happened worldwide in the past 30 years. Despite its large and politically active indigenous population, Colombia still has not witnessed a confrontation of histories in terms of either the material record or historical narratives. Nothing comparable to the events prompted by the Native American Graves Protection and Repatriation Act (NAGPRA) in the United States or the consensual arrangements agreed upon by native peoples and the archaeological apparatus in Canada, Australia, and New Zealand has yet taken place in Colombia, where indigenous peoples’ confrontation of archaeological hegemony has been only marginal.</p>
         <p>There may be several reasons for this apparent anomaly. The Nasa fear anything physically related to the dead (ancestors), and it is taboo to be associated with or be near their remains. This prohibition also extends to people outside the community.24 One of the dreaded diseases in Nasa medical systems is the cacique illness25 (Portela 2002, 70). Whenever archaeological remains of any kind but especially burials (known as <italic>tumbas de pijaos</italic>, “<italic>pijao</italic> burials”) appear (e.g., during the construction of houses, ditches, roads), the <italic>the’walas</italic> advise a change of location. If archaeological remains happen to appear after construction, the <italic>the’walas</italic> conduct a refreshment of the site and a cleansing of the people who have acquired <italic>p</italic>’<italic>tanz</italic> (“dirt,” in very general sense)26 because of proximity to the remains. The cacique disease stems from the Nasa worldview, which posits the existence of three worlds, one of which is the underworld, where the ancestors, among other beings, have lived since they buried themselves to escape the Spanish invasion and domination.27</p>
         <p>The ancestors also live in a proscribed region of <italic>this</italic> world, the world of the Nasa, a region that houses the untamed, the uncultivated, and the wild but also the sacred. The forces dwelling in this region are spiritual, powerful, and feared (see Portela 2000, 2002). Both the underworld and the untamed region of this world are places where the Nasa can enter into contact with the order and forces of creation—with a time before the advent of Catholicism (which for the Nasa is both an important cultural referent and, especially since the emergence of widespread political consciousness in the past three decades, the cause of cultural loss). Although <italic>p’tanz</italic> is not associated with stone statues and other unburied pre‐Hispanic remains, these items are nevertheless included in the proscription because of their implicit relationship with the ancestors.</p>
         <p>We contend that the active and meaningful relationship between indigenous peoples and some aspects of the contemporary material culture existing in their territories (which form part of what we now call archaeological remains) was severed at some point during the colonial period. The turning point in the European crusade against this relationship was the “extirpation of idolatries,” a task entrusted to the church and an important goal of the colonial state in Latin America because the persistence of native religious practices (and the corporate sense they conveyed) was a potential focus of resistance. This long‐lasting enterprise was directed against many practices and their related objects; some of the latter were made of stone, although they were not necessarily statues. A well‐known account of the colonial war against “stone worship” is <italic>Dioses y hombres de Huarochirí</italic> (1975), a Quechua manuscript from the sixteenth century. The text contains several allusions to stone worship, among them the following:<disp-quote>
               <p>In that very moment the woman became stone. She is still there, with her human legs and visible sex, by the roadside, just as Huatyacuri put her there. And she is offered coca, even today, yes, for any reason. [p. 42]On that occasion all the people went to the stone into which Chuquisuso was converted. They carried chicha, a kind of foodstuff known as ticti, and guinea pigs and llamas for worshiping that she‐demon. [p. 49]In the plaza of Huacsatambo, called Tumna, there are now some piled stones; upon arriving at the center of that pile, everyone began to pray. [p. 67]</p>
            </disp-quote>The manuscript also mentions the repression of stone worship by Spanish friars; for instance, “Your name will be Capac Huanca. That is how you will be known. Then he cooled the body of the man until he was converted into stone. When Doctor Ávila [the priest responsible for collecting the manuscript] arrived on the site of Capac Huanca he blew him up” (p. 115). Duviols (1975, 153, 157) registered several instances of such of a repression from the same area of Peru during the sixteenth century; one priest noted that “many idolatries have been remedied, in discovering their rites and the ceremonies they had for worshiping stones. … These Indians, reduced to the truth, publicly confessed their mistakes, and said that what they worshiped as gods were nothing but stones.”</p>
         <p>Although <italic>Dioses y hombres de Huarochirí</italic> is an account of a Peruvian experience, there is reason to believe that stone worship may have been widespread in the Americas at the time of the European arrival. Tierradentro remained outside Spanish control well into the seventeenth century because of armed indigenous resistance; therefore, no direct and detailed chronicles of the sixteenth and seventeenth centries are known from the area. However, an account from its southern fringe does document stone worship. The work of a Franciscan priest, Juan de Santa Gertrudis, about his mission in southern Colombia in the second half of the eighteenth century, <italic>Maravillas de la naturaleza (Wonders of Nature)</italic>, contains a passage describing a large boulder with petroglyphs in the Páramo de Letreros (some 80 km south of Tierradentro) and in front of it “many little baskets with stones” (1994, [1956] 402)—offerings that he attributed to pacts between the “barbarians” and the demon. The rhetoric and phrasing of this passage share the discursive structure of the texts produced during the war waged against idolatry in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries. Although we cannot know if those offerings had pre‐Hispanic antecedents or even if that putative native practice was ever repressed by the church, at least there is a hint of what could have happened regarding the relationship between the indigenous societies conquered by the Spanish and the stone statues and petroglyphs their forebears had made.</p>
         <p>The only direct account of the extirpation of idolatries in Tierradentro is late, from the end of the nineteenth century. Carlos Cuervo, a soldier and traveler interested in indigenous matters, described a large stone where pilgrims worshiped a reputed figure of Christ: “It is true that there were Indian hieroglyphs, probably very important ones, on this stone. Perhaps this was a shrine and the first missionaries, wanting to extirpate the idolatry, pounded the surface where the Indian paintings were and painted, instead, the image of Christ” (1920, 34). Stone worship in Tierradentro was witnessed in the late 1930s by the Spanish archaeologist José Pérez de Barradas: “ In Mosoco there is the stone of St. Thomas, protected by a shack. It has engraved spirals and a human trace; the Indians go there when an animal is lost. By the sputter of the laurel wax candles they light there they think they can find out if the animal fell down a cliff or if it was stolen” (1943, 119).</p>
         <p>The extirpation of idolatries created, above all, widespread fear that was used by the colonial authorities to break the chains of symbolic meaning that may have existed between the natives and their material culture, including the things related to the ancestors. The fear of ancestors that is common among indigenous peoples in Colombia is mainly the result of the preaching of Catholic missionaries. As Taussig (1987, 373) has noted, “the <italic>infieles</italic> or pagans of that other (preconquest, pre‐European) time, have been enfolded and iconicized into the bowels of the Christian cosmos as Antichrist figures—so that they live on forever rustling the leaves of memory in the colonially constructed space of death.” Ramírez (1996, 99) found the same attitude toward putative ancestors among indigenous communities of the eastern flanks of the Andes, where they are called <italic>aukas</italic> or <italic>andaquíes</italic> and considered savages and cannibals. This image is built around the unbaptized, those who resist domination, and has ancient Judeo‐Christian roots. As White (1985, 160) points out, “The archetypal wild men of the Old Testament are the great rebels against the Lord.” Thus, <italic>auka</italic>, <italic>andaqui</italic>, and <italic>pijao</italic> are not ethnic denominations but terms applied in different languages to the same phenomenon: the incarnation of potentially subversive behaviors repressed and punished in the self by the morality of civilization. For instance, <italic>auka</italic> is a Quechua word meaning “warrior, enemy, opponent, cruel, sadistic, bad, traitor, savage, rebellious, barbaric, mischievous, unworthy” (Torres 1982, 39)—that is, all of the negative connotations attributed to the other. The ancestors are therefore to be left alone, undisturbed, lest their evil powers be awakened.</p>
         <p>This fear and proscription created by the colonial process may have been widespread in other parts of the Catholic realm in the Americas as well. For instance, the Aymara historian Carlos Mamani (1989, 49) asserts that “the traumatic fact of colonial invasion changed our contact with the sacred sites of our ancestors. It was claimed that they were places of ‘devil worship,’ thus leaving us with only a mythological understanding both of our past and of the material remains of the past.” Gil (2006) has noted that one of the meanings of <italic>chullpa</italic>, a Quechua word in wide use in the Central Andes, is linked to the tutelary beings of the underworld, who inhabit archaeological ruins and cause illness and death in those who fail to give them “due respect.” For many indigenous peoples in the Andes “archaeological ruins are liminal places located at the spatial‐temporal borders of the community and inhabited by exteme forms of wild alterity belonging to the past” (p. 4).</p>
         <p>We can now see the cacique illness of the Nasa and its proscription of physical proximity to the places of the dangerous and feared other (the ancestors but also <italic>pijaos</italic>28) as an instance of the colonial fear reaching beyond mere abstract symbolism to encompass physical referents. The fear of ancestors highlights a colonial evil: the invention of an other within the other, a sort of double alterity imposed by the construction of the civilized self. There is a <italic>good other</italic>, bending to colonial domination and religious conversion, and there is a <italic>bad other</italic>, rebellious and untamed, a permanent morality constantly calling attention to the perils of subversion. This dichotomy created an other close to the <italic>must</italic> and another other opposing that moral imperative. Ancestors occupy the ranks of the bad other (that is, <italic>ancestors turned other</italic>). They belong to a time when alterity did not suffer colonial subjugation and therefore embody behaviors that are to be repressed in and by the good other, on the verge of becoming part of the civilized self if only the colonial apparatus is capable of countering the courtship of the bad other.29 The ancestors are among the unbaptized, spirits, while the Nasa are baptized, that is, humans. Catholic influence on Nasa historical morality, which impinges upon the very classification of beings and nonbeings, created two main eras: the time before Catholicism was imposed, dominated by spirits and danger, and the time of the civilized, converted self. The ancestors live in the former and are lumped, together with the <italic>pijaos</italic>, as bad others, with the result that the two have become indistinguishable and the terms for them interchangeable.</p>
         <p>As noted above, Reichel‐Dolmatoff (1972<italic>a</italic>) interpreted the iconography of the stone statues of San Agustín in terms of Nasa mythology; he argued that it was related to “the jaguar‐spirit, the concept of fertility, and shamanism” and that all these aspects came down to social control—that what the statues and some indigenous myths portrayed were social proscriptions and the fear of otherness, embodied in the symbol of the jaguar and, by association, of the jaguar‐people—sometimes enemy, sometimes ally, but always fearsome and untrustworthy. Reichel‐Dolmatoff pointed out that images linked to the jaguar were normally thought of as pertaining to the natural world, the untamed, the uncivilized. The jaguar (brutal force of unrepressed sexuality and destruction) had to be tamed by shamanic practices in order to transform its evil into positive outcomes. The shaman was the agent of social control who turned the savage other into the tamed self: “According to many Colombian Indians part of man’s essence is of jaguar origin, a wild, untrammeled energy, all‐devouring in its impulses. … The feline rather represents an energetic principle, the natural life force which, on the social level, has to be controlled if a moral order is to be preserved” (Reichel‐Dolmatoff 1972<italic>a</italic>, 61–62).</p>
         <p>The moral sense of this fearsome and feared force was extended to the <italic>pijaos</italic> and, eventually, to the ancestors. Although it is possible that this extension to the <italic>pijaos </italic>was pre‐European, our argument is that the extension to the ancestors is colonial. Reporting on Nasa myths and stories, Bernal (1953, 291) noted that “it is not necessary to highlight the role played by the <italic>pijaos </italic>in these stories. The memory of this forceful people is still fresh … alive the fear aroused by the name <italic>pijao</italic>. … They appear as phenomenal, as animals of enormous proportions and force.” The <italic>pijaos</italic> had other connotations as well. Bolaños (1994) has explored their colonial meaning, which still lingers: the <italic>pijaos</italic> were cannibals and barbarians but also erotic monsters of the greatest lewdness and sometimes even incarnations of the feminine. All these meanings are iconic of a colonial biopolitics controlling the native body (individual and social) by repressing and condemning behaviors and emotions. By being barbarians, cannibals, monsters, lascivious, feminine, and so on, the <italic>pijaos</italic> fully embodied the enemy of the civilized self. As enemies the <italic>pijaos</italic> cause anxiety because they are feared and dangerous, a permanent menace; as Bolaños (1994, 164) puts it, “the anxiety with regard to the <italic>pijao</italic> is not only because it is ‘different’ but, mainly, because is uncontrollable.”</p>
         <p>In sum, a dangerous other (embodied in the symbol of the jaguar, the <italic>pijaos</italic>, and the ancestors), whether it is outside or inside the social body, has to be held at bay or tamed. Morality thus confronts the danger of the other because it implies the dissolution of the bond that links the self with the civilized order. This reasoning makes it possible to understand why many native societies in Colombia and elsewhere have a tense and difficult relationship with the physical referents related to the dangerous other, including their ancestors and their material remains (the archaeological record). The distinction between bad and good others had an instrumental end: severing the relationship of native societies with the time before Christianity created a new beginning. The indigenous identification of the bad other closely follows the depiction of the savage Indian by early Spanish chroniclers, another indication of how deeply infused myths are with colonial‐created categories.</p>
         <p>The colonial origin of this discursive object can be better seen through ethnographic comparison. Indigenous groups located in areas where the influence of the church and its colonial discourse was less decisive or nonexistent do not display the rhetoric of the bad other regarding the ancestors. It is even possible to trace a sort of ideological frontier defined by the presence of the bad‐other/fear‐of‐ancestors rhetorical complex, and this frontier coincides with the spread of Catholic domination. We want to illustrate this argument with two examples from contemporary Colombia: the native groups of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta, on the Caribbean coast, and the Uwa of the Eastern Cordillera. Unlike the indigenous communities of the Andes and its eastern flanks, the native societies of the Sierra Nevada de Santa Marta constantly re‐create the meaning of archaeological remains. The ancients are revered along with their material referents, such as agricultural terraces, mythological dwellings (among them pyramid‐like hills), and large rocks (thought to be petrified mythical characters). There is a clear continuity in some material cultural items; for instance, the present‐day Kogi use copper and stone objects (adornments, jingle bells, whistles, flat slabs for musical purposes, ceremonial adzes, and quartz beads) that either come from archaeological contexts (found by chance or deliberately sought) or are manufactured in traditional ways. Although some proscriptions exist (archaeological sites house the dead, are full of diseases, and must be left undisturbed), they are related to the constant fear of wrongdoing (according to their own cultural norms) and its consequent supernatural punishment, including that of the ancestors, and are mediated by <italic>mámas</italic>, the religious leaders of the Sierra Nevada30 (Reichel‐Dolmatoff 1985). So strong is their relationship with the material remains of their ancestors that they have even claimed territorial rights to the most spectacular pre‐Hispanic remains in Colombia, the so‐called Lost City (a large terraced settlement with households, plazas, and stairways that is widely promoted by Colombian governments as an icon of national identity comparable only to Machu Picchu). In 1987 the regional indigenous organization Gonawindúa Tairona claimed the city, locally called Teyuna, arguing that it belonged to their ancestors, the Tayrona. The site’s importance as national patrimony was a reason the state gave for not acceding to this request, but that same year the Colombian Institute of Anthropology and History agreed to cease archaeological excavations and allow the performance of native ceremonies there (Orrantia 2003). Some two years later Kogi elders from the Sierra Nevada visited the Gold Museuem in Santa Marta and requested the repatriation of ritually significant pre‐Hispanic lithic artifacts that were on display. Although no repatriation occurred, a compromise was reached, and one special sacred artifact was removed from display (Luz Alba Gómez, personal communication).</p>
         <p>The Uwa (formerly known as Tunebos) inhabit the eastern and western flanks of the Sierra Nevada del Cocuy, the part of the Eastern Cordillera bordering the interior of northeastern Colombia and the vast expanses of the Eastern Plains. The land currently inhabited by the Uwa is an isolated corner of the Eastern Cordillera spared by colonial domination and by Christian evangelization until the twentieth century; part of their ancestral territory, however, located on the western flanks of the Sierra, suffered the rigors of the conquest, resulting in ethnic destructuring of the native population (which became peasant, albeit with a strong ethnic memory) and the appropriation of their lands. The relatively limited impact of colonization (both colonial and republican) upon the Uwa (especially the eastern groups), at least compared with that suffered by many other native groups in the Americas, is apparent in the fact that their current culture is built around indigenous practices. Uwa territory is dotted with large menhirs whose meaning has not changed much since they were described in the seventeenth century. They are the pillars that support the world and were placed in position by their deities in their ancestral territory: “The chronicles of the conquest say that places with large stones were sacred to the Indians, and the contemporary Uwa hold that in the sites with menhirs their ancestors communicated with the gods of creation” (Falchetti 2003, 52–53). Further, “the Uwa have maintained the symbolic association between the sacred markers of their territory, the menhirs, and their shamans or traditional authorities” (p. 204). Although the sites with menhirs are no longer in use, the memory that relates them to ancestors and deities is still alive. The Uwa’s sacred songs are linked to archaeological sites, and they use material culture items found there (Osborn 1985). Although there are several colonial accounts of Uwa “idolatry” (e.g., Falchetti 2003, 62–63, 65, 73, 154), the prosecution of its practitioners was limited because they always managed to escape to the eastern, inaccessible parts of the Uwa realm, from where they eventually ventured out into the western, colonial‐dominated parts of their former territory.31</p>
         <p>These two examples show that colonial historical domination was not homogeneous among indigenous societies. For reasons that are case‐sensitive, some of them managed to escape the brutal transformation of their historical representations. But even in the cases in which colonialism condemned and proscribed pre‐European times, feared ancestors could be converted into positive forces, and this new meaning implies a semantic and political subversion of the colonial order. Given that ancestors are central to Nasa life, forming with the thunder and the lakes a relational axis on which the three worlds of their worldview spin (Portela 2001, 55), at some point their relationship with pre‐Hispanic material remains could change, and this is actually happening in the Juan Tama community.</p>

               <p>The anthropologist Anthony Henman also hints at this in his work on coca use in southwestern Colombia. Referring to the similarities between some engravings on the Tierradentro stone statues and contemporary coca‐related paraphernalia, he writes: “The engraving of the coca bag has the same size and shape as contemporaneous versions used by the Nasa, so one suspects more than a simple coincidence” (Henman 1980, 50). He does not, however, develop this argument of historical continuity. Incidentally, Henman’s idea about the representations of coca chewing in pre‐Hispanic material culture from the northern Andes (mostly stone statues and pottery) is illustrated by one of the statues from La Candelaria (fig. 4, <italic>left</italic>). Another exception that must be mentioned is the work of Ann Osborn among the Uwa from the Colombia’s Eastern Cordillera. In a book devoted to exploring Uwa myths (Osborn 1985), she reports that they refer to actual archaeological sites; yet hers is not an archaeological interpretation using mythical material but an account of myths showing that they contain references to sites.</p>

               <p>Some colonized societies did not suffer this rupture as dramatically, did not suffer it at all, or recast it in imaginative ways. For instance, the analysis of Hamann (2002) of what he calls “indigenous Mesoamerican archaeology” shows how important and meaningful the remains of the past were and still are for postconquest Mesoamerican native societies. The explanations of such instances, so different from the one we are discussing, must be case‐sensitive, but a general statement could be drawn from the policies of inclusiveness of some nation‐states, such as Mexico.</p>

         <title>Native Histories: History in the Making</title>
         <p>Colonialist archaeological discourse about native histories imposed the idea that indigenous peoples and cultures were part of the past. The basis of this discourse, upon which the exclusion and subordination of ethnic alterity was largely predicated, was the idea that the subject matter of history is the past, not the present and the future. Native resistance to this discourse confronted a meaning‐producing regime, that of national history, with local histories largely mobilized in the framework of ethnic struggle. The establishment of temporal continuity using material (archaeological) referents and the revitalization of social memories long silenced now become central elements of new social projects.</p>
         <p>In the past two decades there has been a drift toward a restoration of the links with ancestral times that includes their material referents. In Colombia this still‐developing process was started by the Guambianos, neighbors of the Nasa, who feared the <italic>pishaus</italic>, reputedly former inhabitants of their territory,32 as much as the Nasa fear the <italic>pijaos</italic>. The <italic>pishaus</italic> were a colonial‐produced incarnation of a feared alterity. Yet the Guambianos have recently turned the <italic>pishaus</italic> into their own revered ancestors (Dagua, Aranda, and Vasco 1998), and in this task they have been decisively assisted by anthropologists and archaeologists (Vasco 1992). Material remains uncovered by collaborative archaeological research have been endowed with new meanings in the context of ethnic struggle for self‐determination and cultural revival. From considering that “bones and burial goods are dangerous and can cause disease and even death upon entering in contact with them” and that “those remains do not belong to Guambianos but to <italic>pishaus</italic>” (Vasco 1992, 181), the Guambianos came to say that “all the pottery and all the traces found in our territory are our own and not of other people. … The <italic>pishau</italic> are our ancestors and not strange people” (p. 188). In a manifesto coauthored by an anthropologist and two respected Guambiano elders a year after these remarks were made, any doubts about the cultural affiliation of <italic>pishau</italic> were dispelled (Vasco, Dagua, and Aranda 1993, 14–15):<disp-quote>
               <p>The <italic>pishau</italic> were not other people; they were the very same Guambiano. … White historians come now to tell us that the traces of the ancients that remain in our territory do not belong to the <italic>pishau </italic>but to the <italic>pijao</italic>, which were our enemies. With that story they want to snatch away our forebears, they want to cut off our roots from our trunk in order to assert their lie that we are not from here.</p>
            </disp-quote>The manifesto thus makes it clear that the consideration of the <italic>pishaus </italic>as alien enemies was a colonial imposition and that their symbolic and physical recovery as ancestors is a political move of the greatest importance. This reassessment, an obviously conscious choice on the part of the Guambianos, sums up a moral story: the bad other disappears when the good other decides to confront domination, when subjugated alterity decides to become a respected and empowered self. Cultural meanings are historical and strategic.</p>
         <p>There is yet another reason that this inverted semantics can occur: the bad other is certainly feared but also admired and made central to the symbolism of resistance (Taussig 1987). It embodies the power to confront the colonial order. Otherness is the locus of potential resistance, something the state has always known and that caused it to enlist the Catholic Church to curtail deviations from the norm of civilization. The bad other exemplifies everything feared and punished by the self, a moral void into which the good other is always at risk of falling, but the good other, no matter how afraid, finds in it a model, a positive morality, an icon of struggle. The ancestors fooled the Spanish by burying themselves in the underworld—a sign not of cowardice but of ingenuity—and thus avoided colonial subjugation. Burying oneself in the land or in the water (as Nasa myths say Juan Tama and other creation heroes did)—that is, patiently resting or hiding until the time arrives to return—is a pan‐Andean trademark of the native messiahs eagerly awaited in the symbolism of these societies. Thus, the negative categorization of the bad other is, simultaneously, its sign of purity, the signature of the “true” native.</p>
         <p>The indigenous organization in Cauca has recently set out on the path of the Guambianos. The celebration of the thirty‐fourth anniversary of the CRIC two years ago began with a trip to San Andrés de Pisimbalá, site of the Tierradentro Archaeological Park—a significant move signaling the commitment of the organization to previously neglected archaeological referents. The current events taking place in the Juan Tama <italic>resguardo</italic> contributed to and deepen this move. Although the three stone statues uprooted from La Candelaria six decades ago are still housed in the museum in Popayán, in the past year several respected elders of the Juan Tama community have come to the museum to see them. Learning that they were taken from La Candelaria and that the university is willing to give them back has been a thrill for them. The university and the Juan Tama community have agreed that the statues will return to their original location. Their trip back to the Aguacatal River will highlight a planned collaborative research project involving archaeologists and native peoples in the production of local history, deepening a brief joint project carried out in 2003. The earlier project produced audiovisual materials showing the importance of getting to know the archaeology of La Candelaria and adjacent areas. Schoolteachers and students were especially active in this effort to strengthen and redefine ethnic identity.</p>
         <p>Archaeology can find places where historical production is truly meaningful for local populations, politically and otherwise, beyond the grandeur (and, quite often, the local uselessness) of universal narratives. Public outreach is becoming ethically mandatory and strategically necessary. Yet, for many archaeologists public outreach is still just a way of sharing results—that is, not a collective and collaborative enterprise but a one‐way process by which expert knowledge is communicated to the public. Native peoples are included in this process with the idea that they may eventually find archaeological information useful for their own histories. In contrast, public archaeology (that is, archaeology for and by the public) is conceived not as a normally unidirectional process wherein wise archaeologists advise ignorant people about their own history but as a coproduction in which interested parties collaborate, learn from each other, and jointly (but not without productive conflict) produce history (Gnecco 2006).</p>
         <p>From an academic perspective there is no doubt that history is crucial for the constitution and maintenance of the social fabric, but the situation may be different when one is dealing with communities experiencing living conditions on the margins of the well‐being that the industrialized world takes for granted. In such cases mere survival and the fulfillment of basic needs (such as education and health) are more important or at least much more urgent than memory and its activation by history. It is one thing to talk about the importance of memory and history from the comfortable desk of a university office and quite another when the struggle for territory, economic self‐sufficiency, and political recognition are at stake. Yet, when urgent agendas have already been fulfilled or when historical narratives can accompany them, there is room for hope that desire will eventually meet memory. Although this is currently happening in the Juan Tama <italic>resguardo</italic>, the meaningful appropriation of archaeological remains by indigenous communities in old and newly settled territories is a process that has to be promoted and in which archaeology is a prominent actor.33</p>
         <p>The Juan Tama community displays history in the making. Nasa history is cyclical, and one of its prominent features is times of renewal. It is also millenarist, and disasters are propitious for the restoration of order (Rappaport 1981). This idea seems to be widespread in Amerindian philosophy; the name it receives in the Andes is <italic>pachacuti</italic>,34 a cyclical, cataclysmic destruction of the world followed by the return of the right order. The millenarist movements of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries in Tierradentro documented by Rappaport (1981), similar to others in the Andean realm, highlight the role of earthquakes in the reorganization of the world. The 1994 earhquake caused widespread destruction, but it was also a creative historical event: it has been thought of as a time of renewal and restoration, one capable of awakening history. This mythical renewal, moral in its postulation of the world as <italic>it has to be</italic>, combines with political struggle to produce a propitious time for the Nasa, a restoration of a lost order, a time in which historical meaning, through the symbolic appropriation of otherwise ignored and feared objects, can be paramount. As Rappaport (1981, 384) has noted, messianic thought is always present in Nasa culture, ready to become action when “available social conditions and cultural symbols coincide.” In the case of the Juan Tama <italic>resguardo</italic>, the requisite social conditions exist in the strong involvement of the people in political consciousness‐raising, bilingual education, historical revitalization, and the promotion of communal practices. Symbols are at hand, too, in the form (among other things) of archaeological remains that can be culturally appropriated and in the adoption of Juan Tama as the community’s name: Tama was a messiah who defeated the <italic>pijaos </italic>and ended years of colonial terror, symbolically and proactively;35 he made the Nasa proud of themselves. This coincidence of symbols and conditions deepens an apocalyptic, millenarist native hope of a new opportunity to subvert the colonial order for the construction of autonomous, self‐determining societies.</p>
         <p>The native symbolic appropriation of archaeological remains, however, is marked by an approach that departs from that of most archaeologists. While for the latter the archaeological record is evidence of the past and therefore of vanished cultures worthy of being subjected to scholarly inquiry, for indigenous peoples an archaeological site is a living place (Mamani 1989, 49–50):<disp-quote>
               <p>The archaeological ruins left by ancient cultures are not inert or dead objects: they have a reality which actively influences our lives both individually and collectively. … The relationship we have with material evidence of our past goes beyond a simple “positivist” attitude which would treat them as mere objects of knowledge. Rather, they are for us sources of moral strength and a reaffirmation of our cultural autonomy.</p>
            </disp-quote>It has been held that Nasa memory rests on material referents such as mountains, lakes, boulders, and waterfalls (Rappaport 1990; Findji 1993; Gómez and Ruíz 1997). In contrast to those of Western societies, these referents are almost exclusively geographical.36 Yet, indigenous communities can appropriate other material referents, even what we call archaeological materials, into their symbolic realm. They are even willing to explore the symbolic possibilities of alternative (even Western) mnemonic devices such as museums (see Vasco 1992). In this regard, the statues from La Candelaria can act as historical acivators not only for the Juan Tama Nasa but also for many indigenous and local communities elsewhere. Material objects and features turned archaeological by academic or community‐appropriated discourses can serve to strengthen the historical reflection that is needed to stimulate social participation.</p>

         <title>Closing: Histories in the Postmodern Era</title>
         <p>During the course of modernity the state was the only social actor fully aware of history as one of the main battlefields of identity. Nowadays there are other actors, empowered with the weapons of self‐representation, on the historical scene. This situation may seem singular in the postmodern era, one of whose main tenets is the termination of the historical sense; yet the need for a historical horizon in the construction of utopia is prominent for a host of social actors. History becomes a source of collective meanings and a memory of negative events to be overcome—of the disasters brought about by colonialism. Colonial meanings, powerful and pervasive, are recast and resignified.</p>
         <p>Walter Benjamin (1968, 254) noted that “the past caries with it a temporal index by which it is referred to redemption”; he conceived the latter as the basic fuel of the utopian rocket. The past is filled with meaning by a present that dreams: “Every image of the past that is not recognized by the present as one of its own concerns threatens to disappear irretrievably” (p. 255).37 History is not the recollection of things that happened but the narrative of things that must have happened:<disp-quote>
               <p>To articulate the past historically does not mean to recognize it “the way it really was” (Ranke). It means to seize hold of a memory as it flashes up at a moment of danger. … The danger affects both the content of the tradition and its receivers. The same threat hangs over both: that of becoming a tool of the ruling classes. … Only that historian [capable of separating tradition from conformity] will have the gift of fanning the spark of hope in the past who is firmly convinced that <italic>even the dead</italic> will not be safe from the enemy if he wins. And this enemy has not ceased to be victorious.</p>
            </disp-quote>For over two centuries the “enemy” was national histories that not only transformed, appropriated, erased, and domesticated local histories but also claimed a monopoly on representing them. The enemy is different nowadays and is richly clad in the colorful dress of antihistorical rhetoric: in postmodern logic, history is devaluated or plainly declared dead. Gilles Lipovetsky (1990, 305–6) expressed it well: “The reign of the past has been abolished; it is now neutralized, subdued as it is by the unquestionable imperative of individual private satisfaction. … The legitimacy of the founding past, characteristic of traditional societies, has given way to the organization of the future.”</p>
         <p>Although the past now plays a more discreet role compared with its grand appearances in the opera of modernity, a growing resistance is challenging this order of things. Archaeologists and other interested parties, prominently including social movements such as that of the Juan Tama community, are opposing the postmodern devaluation of history by mobilizing alternative interpretations of the past. Alternative histories are “critical histories” (<italic>sensu</italic> Nietzsche 2000) that read the documentary record with different eyes: they read it from different presents and futures anchored in a plethora of alternative identities.38 Local communities worldwide are contesting the control of academic disciplines over historical narratives. Historical insubordination has displaced the locus of the enunciation of the past, formerly the exclusive privilege of “professionals of memory” (<italic>sensu </italic>Wachtel 1986, 217), now placing it on the agenda of ethnic minorities, in school curricula, and in new constitutional and legal frameworks (multicultural, pluricultural, multiethnic). The relationship between archaeologists and the groups whose voices they have never heard has changed in the past two decades; these groups now have influence over the configuration of historical narratives, even beyond the borders of their own identities, as multicultural morality demands. The relationship is now marked by the struggle for self‐determination, decision‐making power, and control.</p>
         <p>This new scenario has prompted new conditions with which some archaeologists do not feel comfortable, accustomed as they are to an unquestioned narrative monopoly. One of the aspects that trouble archaeologists most is sharing (or, in some cases, relinquishing) the control they have enjoyed over the archaeological record or, more generally, the public heritage. However, as Wylie (1997, 117) has noted, archaeologists “cannot presume an automatic priority of access to or control over (much less ownership of) archaeological resources on grounds that a commitment to promote (scientific) knowledge and inquiry serves ‘society’ as a whole.” First, the notion that scientific enquiry benefits and pleases society at large is an arrogance that can only be conceived from the standpoint of a colonial ideology. Secondly, “archaeological record” and “public heritage” are terms drawn from the national imagination. The national (and postnational) conception of heritage as public and as the field of intervention of selected experts can only be imposed with violence (symbolic and otherwise). Yet, heritage is a contested field and its reputed public character questioned. Cojti (2006), for instance, has shown that contemporary native communities in Guatemala are challenging the state appropriation of the “Maya” heritage for nonencompassing nationality and for the tourist market: “The Maya past is considered a common good to be shared with the international community, rather than a cultural right for Maya to decide how our past will be shared with other people” (Cojti 2006, 13). The story told in this paper is just one instance of this new order, one in which archaeology gains wide legitimacy by “going public,” by questioning its long marriage with national histories, by leaving the academic ghetto to which it has confined itself for so long and finding places where historical production is meaningful for a variety of peoples. Public archaeology is plural archaeology—not a way of broadening the reception of expert knowledge but a way of expanding and empowering the constituencies researching and giving meaning to the past (Gnecco 2006).</p>

               <p>Nietzsche (2000, 102) thought similarly: “The past can only be interpreted from the most powerful force of the present.”</p>

               <p>A case from Guatemala illustrates this point. Contemporary Mayas now read the 1524 text <italic>Annals of the Kaqchikels</italic> differently from the way it has been read by national history. For the latter the <italic>Annals</italic> consecrate the success of the Spanish conquest and the ensuing indigenous defeat; for the Maya they offer “a view from the past of the origins of a major indigenous people, their common cosmology, their experiences of armed European invasion, and, critically, their genealogical continuity and survival” (Warren 1996, 91).</p>
