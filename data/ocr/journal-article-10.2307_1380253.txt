<plain_text><page sequence="1">Barash, David P. SOCIOBIOLOGY AND BEHAVIOR, Elsevier, New York, 378 pp., 1977. From its title and from an endorsement by E. O. Wilson in the foreword, this book might be expected to offer to the zoologist a useful condensation of Wilson's massive compendium, So- ciobiology: The New Synthesis (1975). Indeed, the book contains a sociobiological glossary and an easy-to-use boldface bibliography in which references are cited in the body of the text. Moreover, the book is liberally supplied with figures and photographs illustrating behavioral concepts. But despite the inclusion of these professional features in his book, David Barash intends it to be only a "persuasive primer," which "assumes no background other than high school biology" and is "directed mainly toward students in the social sciences," (p. x). "The book does not provide a comprehensive view of all of social behavior," (p. x) he states, but it stresses specifically the concepts of kin selection and inclusive fitness as advanced by W. D. Hamilton and R. L. Trivers. Barash's premise is that "kinship considerations may figure signif- icantly in virtually all aspects of social behavior," (p. 267). The book is written in an informal, conversational style, which Wilson calls "swift and light" (p. xiii), but which occasionally employs colloquialisms like "getting it together" and "where biology is at." Moreover, as Barash cautions, he has "indulged rather freely in biologically grounded speculation," (p. x), climaxing in a conjectural 50-page final chapter entitled "The Sociobiology of Human Behavior: Extrapolations and Speculations." One of his avowed objec- tives is to convert students of psychology, sociology, and anthropology to a new point of view: "I hope only to make a case for the sociobiological approach; it is therefore one-sided and</page><page sequence="2">648 JOURNAL OF MAMMALOGY Vol. 59, No. 3 'pushes' an evolutionary perspective," (p. xi). In the final chapter, he points out that "the social sciences need all the help they can get," (p. 276) and "if biology seems arrogant in seeking to include humans within its scope, think of the greater arrogance of a social science that refuses help when it is offered," (p. 277). The help that Barash offers begins with a 70-page introduction to the theory of evolution by natural selection, and to the genetic basis of some behaviors and hence their susceptibility to evolutionary modification. He concludes the opening section with a categorization of four dif- ferent evolutionary approaches to the study of animal social behavior. These are as follows: 1) historical, the derivation of behavioral phylogenies from studies of extant species; 2) evaluative, the identification of the functional significance of behaviors observed in the field; 3) correlational, the behavioral comparison of closely related groups that occupy different environments; 4) pre- dictive, a method introduced by Barash that uses a priori predictions of expected social behavior based on knowledge of the biology of a population and, presumably, its environmental setting. These predictions are governed by what Barash defines as "The Central Theorem of Sociobiol- ogy: when any behavior under study reflects some component of genotype, animals should behave so as to maximize their inclusive fitness," (p. 63). Barash observes later, "animal social systems may well represent neither more nor less than the sum of behaviors of individuals, each of whom is acting to maximize its inclusive fitness," (p. 103). In the next 200 pages, Barash discusses aspects of altruistic behavior, advantages and disad- vantages of sociality, and evolutionary strategies of mate selection, parenting, social competition, and spacing. Examples are drawn primarily from animals, illustrating Barash's belief that "so- ciobiology relies heavily on the behavioral consequences of genetic relatedness," (p. 171). De- spite the book's general title, he only touches upon a number of significant factors, which con- tribute to animal social structures. These include such ecological factors as habitat structure, resource dispersion and abundance, competition and predation, and such phylogenetic factors as physiological and anatomical limitations, sensory modalities and species ethograms. Intrinsic variables such as population dynamics, demography, and gene flow, as well as foraging strategies and time-energy budgets, are given little consideration. Although Barash admits, for example, that predation is a "strong selective force in shaping animal social organization," (p. 110), he chooses not to discuss extrinsic ecological factors in much detail. It is a source of confusion that the term sociobiology has recently come to refer almost exclu- sively to the single issue of kin selection and to one species-Homo sapiens. Another problem is ambiguity in the use of the term "altruism." The interpretation of many altruistic behaviors in light of kin selection is that "they are all selfish in the long run," (p. 97). Barash admits that "the term altruism is probably unfortunate" because "true altruism implies that the altruist's inclusive fitness is actually reduced," (p. 97). It is curious that Barash further qualifies the term altruism because "it implies a cognitive process that may well be uniquely human," (p. 97), when he himself uses such anthropomorphic terms as "rape," "cuckoldry," "adultery," and "prostitution" in discussing some activities of non-humans. Barash promotes the predictive approach to behavioral investigation because he feels it avoids the potentially tautological pitfalls of the other approaches. A few admonitions might also apply to the predictive method, however. First, field observations intended to verify a sociobiological prediction should be sufficiently extensive in scope and duration to allow for a relatively full range of variation in the subject. Second, predictions should be formulated at the outset in such a way as to eliminate as many competing hypotheses as possible for which the same expectations might apply. Third, when alternative hypotheses exist, they should be capable of being tested. This is a weakness of Barash's concluding chapter, where he bases his speculative predictions concerning human behavior on considerations of kin selection. He admits that "culture can mimic biology ... there is no way to eliminate it as a confounding variable," (p. 282) and "just because something is adaptive does not mean that it must be biological even if it accords with sociobiological prediction," (283). "We are going to play 'Let's Pretend,"' (p. 277) Barash says, hoping that the potentially heuristic value of the statements he calls "sometimes playful ... avowedly speculative and perhaps a bit outrageous," (p. xi) will outweigh these drawbacks. Examples of such speculations are that males should be more intolerant of infidelity than females, defective children should be neglected, older persons should be more altruistic than younger ones, and people should tend to be more hostile toward individuals of other races. In general, "each individual is ultimately motivated by considerations of their (sic) own evolutionary self- interest," (p. 305).</page><page sequence="3">August 1978 REVIEWS 649 The book suffers from a number of inconsistencies. For example, Barash states that "selection itself could never lead a species over an evolutionary cliff," (p. 154) but later observes that "populations ... by natural selection operating on each component individual ... may also fall over a cliff, i.e. become extinct," (p. 280). Elsewhere, after he cautions that although "social behavior can profitably be viewed as a consequence of natural selection, it does not necessarily follow that every identifiable phenotype must therefore by adaptive," (p. 244) he states con- cerning home range size that "variations, while seemingly chaotic and resistant to generalization, are in fact susceptible to one overwhelming generality: they represent adaptive variation appro- priate for the maximization of fitness in each idiosyncratic case," (p. 252). In Table 6-1 (p. 161) jacanas are listed as the example for simultaneous polyandry, but in the text (p. 171), turkeys and Tasmanian hens are described as "the two documented cases of simultaneous polyandry among animals," with no mention of jacanas. On page 197 jacanas and phalaropes are listed as examples of polyandry with no mention of the first two. In addition, several minor errors, mis- prints and omissions give the book a slightly hurried look. Typical examples are: Skutch (1949) is cited on p. 75 but not listed in the bibliography; and Plate 4-6 on p. 91, showing geese, is ascribed in the text to Tasmanian hens. With more comprehensive coverage of the field, a more systematic presentation of ideas, less speculation, and a less informal tone, this book might not only have better accomplished its stated objectives, but also have provided the student of animal behavior with a valuable refer- ence. On the other hand, the student of the social sciences who relies on Barash's book as his sole exposure to sociobiology might come to share Mark Twain's view: "There is something fascinating about science. One gets such wholesale returns of conjecture out of such a trifling investment of fact."-S. E. THOMPSON, JR., Museum of Vertebrate Zoology, University of Cal- ifornia, Berkeley, California 94720. J. Mamm., 59(3):647-649, 1978</page></plain_text>
