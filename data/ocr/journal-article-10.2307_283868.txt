CONACHER UNIVERSITY OF SASKATCHEWAN I In the many studies written on the Suppliants of Euripides, by far the greatest attention has been paid to the political aspects of this play. Among scholars who have approached the play from this point of view, some seek in it merely the reflection of contemporary events aind contemporary political attitudes;' others, more con- cerned with literary values, have found that topical references do interfere, in places, with the characterization and the "epic frame- work" of the play ;2 finally a few (mostly among recent critics) have argued that the political theme of the Suppliants is expressed in the 1 Among studies of this nature, the following may be mentioned as representative: G. Lugge, Quomodo Euripides in Supplicibus Tempora Sua Respexerit (Diss. Guestfalia 1887); P. Giles, "Political Allusions in the Suppliants of Euripides," CR 4 (1890) 95-98; C. Kuiper, "De Euripidis Supplicibus," tr. and published by J. H. Hartman, Mnem- osyne N. S. 51 (1923) 101-28; R. Goosens, "Pericles et Thhs6e," Bull. de l'Assoc. Guill. Bude, (Avril 1932) 9-40; E. Delebecque, Euripide et la Guerre du Peloponnese (Paris 1951) chap. 9. The similarities between the burial issue in the Suppliants and the aftermath of Delium in 424, and between the Argive-Athenian pact at the end of this play and the historical pact between Athens, Argos, Elis and Mantinea in 420, serve as starting points for the arguments concerning the dating of this play and the reflection in it of contemp- orary affairs and attitudes in the period immediately preceding 420. In this context, the studies mentioned above discuss in detail the attitudes allegedly expressed toward the Thebans, the Spartans and the Argives, and toward the character and policies of Alcibiades, Nicias and (in retrospect) Pericles, in various attempts to assess both the political ideals of the dramatist and the specific political advice of this play. Useful as such historical studies may be, particularly in the matter of dating a play, they tend to examine each element in the play for its alleged contemporary significance only and to ignore the possible dramatic reasons for its presence. The works of Lugge, Goosens and Delebecque cited above, in this note, will be re- ferred to hereafter by the author's name alone.

Thus, even in the more literary discussions, it is the political and ethical aspects of Theseus' and (in some studies) Adrastus' actions, and their effect on the suffering women who give the play its name, which have been most fully considered. As a result of this understandable emphasis, rela- tively little attention has been paid to certain puzzling features con- cerning the treatment of the gods in this play. This is, admittedly, a minor theme in the Suppliants, but it is one which, in its peculiar relation to the major, ethical theme, may help to account for certain unusual and perhaps faulty features in the play's construction. It is, moreover, a theme of great interest in Euripidean studies gener- ally, and particularly in this instance, as here Euripides' attitude to the gods may seem to run counter to various attitudes expressed in other plays of his. Several commentators have observed this ap- parent peculiarity in passing, but very few have sought to go beneath the appearance, or else to explain what they have accepted as a major inconsistency in Euripides' treatment of this subject. Most commentators regard the Theseus of the Suppliants as a model of conventional piety and, either expressly or by implication, suggest that in this play Euripides presents an orthodox picture of the gods as champions of justice and as the authors of a certain order in the world. Professor Gregoire, for example, describes the piety of Theseus as follows: Les trois principaux commandements de la morale grecque, souvent rappeles par les poetes, sont: 'Honore les dieux, respecte les h8tes, venere tes parents.' Euripide a pris grand soin de nous montrer Thesee obser- vant religieusement les trois preceptes.4 Roger Goosens, agreeing with this view, considers this conventional religious attitude an important part of the idealized picture of con- temporary (or near-contemporary) Athenian society supposedly represented by the Theseus and the Athens of this play.5 The alleged emphasis on piety and orthodoxy in the Suppliants has caused several scholars to contrast this aspect of the play with I See Kitto 221-29; Greenwood, chap. 4; Zuntz, chap. 1. Professor Grube's study also belongs among these more formal, literary analyses but this critic is more ready to admit that certain passages of contemporary reference in the Suppliants have been but imperfectly woven into the dramatic pattern. 4L.

Conacher [1956 the attitude to the gods expressed elsewhere in Euripides. G. Feugere, in a dissertation comparing the thought of Euripides and Socrates, contrasts Theseus' picture (Supp. 195 ff.) of a divine providence taking thought for the world, with Hecuba 488-91, where rather the opposite idea is suggested. This author affirms, more- over (in a somewhat confusing and tendentious argument), that the favourable picture of the gods in Theseus' speech is more representa- tive of Euripides' view.6 Other commentators, however, regard the Suppliants as the exception in this matter. W. J. Koster, for one, considers it the best example of a play where Euripides is "un- like himself"; this critic selects the lack of criticism of the gods and the general optimism about their government of world affairs as the most untypical features.7 Koster's explanation of this apparent in- consistency in Euripides seems inadequate: he argues that in the complex mind of the poet contemporary interests and new ideas were not entirely freed from the bonds of ancestral religion and customs. Hence arose "dispar illa et parum constans ars et philosophia" which this critic finds to be a frequent source of confusion in the poet's work.8 With this view we may compare the rather similar approach of Professor Masqueray:9 "En quelques drames Euripide s'ingenie 'a soutenir des id6es contraires aux siennes.... A cet egard, la trag6die des Suppliantes est singuliere." (Masqueray cites the defeat of Adrastus and the victory of Theseus over the hybristic Thebans as evidence of the "moral vindication" of the gods in this play.) Masqueray, like Koster, suggests a conflict between tradi- tion and individuality in the mind of the poet as an explanation of the kind of inconsistency here involved, but in this case, the conflict is presented as one between the imagination and the reason: "C'est que les conceptions mythologiques dont son esprit d'homme de theatre etait penetre, repugnaient plus que nos legendes "a tout examen critique." Hence, Masqueray pictures Euripides as torn between the traditional, mythical material (which both dramatic convention and his own poetic imagination approved) and his own love of truth, particularly in everything which concerned the gods. In the case of the Suppliants, Masqueray feels that the traditional 6 G.

Other critics have also remarked on the unusual traditionalism of the Suppliants but since several of these have been more con- cerned with specific instances of itlO than with the more general suggestions of "dualism" which have just been outlined, it may be useful to consider for a moment the kind of approach to Euripides typified in the studies of Masqueray and Koster. Both these ex- planations of apparently opposed tendencies in Euripides' work seem to argue a greater degree of ingenuousness and even confusion on the part of the dramatist than his actual handling of traditional themes would suggest. Masqueray's distinction, for example, be- tween myth and truth is surely more naive than Euripides (let alone many modern critics!) would allow, and Koster's explanation of the Bacchae as an indication of Euripides' occasional nostalgia for traditional beliefs'1 shows a similar blindness to the poet's own awareness of the potentialities in myth. Euripides was quite ready to express the truths which he perceived in life, through myth; some- times, perhaps, he was helped in the finding of those truths by ex- amining myths according to his own lights. The difficulty springs rather from the fact that Euripides treated myth in more than one way and with more than one purpose. As well as expressing in his own terms the truths which he found in certain myths, he was also concerned with showing how myth was not to be regarded, and here, particularly with regard to mythical treatments of the gods, it was the literal, the anthropomorphic and the dogmatic, in current atti- tudes to myth, which he most constantly derided. These distinc- tions between Euripides' attitudes to myth are easier to discern in the more philosophic plays, on the one hand, and in the serio-comic, melodramatic plays, on the other hand. In predominately "poli- tical" plays (using the term in its highest sense) like the Suppliants, the treatment of traditional material will need, for reasons soon to be considered, to be more conventional, but even here, one need not expect the poet's quick and constant sense of the ludicrous or the '? Several critics have commented particularly on the unusual orthodoxy of Euri- pides' attitude toward divination in the Suppliants; cf., for example, J. Berlage, Com- mentatio de Euripide Philosopho (Lugduni Batavorum 1888) 114 ff., and Feugere (above, note 6) 60-1, 63 ff.

Conacher [1956 over-literal in conventional attitudes to myth and legend completely to desert him. In the Suppliants the imprint of this sense appears, perhaps, only in the minor themes, but one cannot help feeling that those critics who complain of the unexpected orthodoxy of this play have missed some of the asides by which the poet has saved his integrity. Among the more formal literary analyses of the Suppliacnts, the questioni of Euripides' attitude to the gods (when considered at all) has been treated with greater perception, but sinlce the divine theme is a relatively minor one here, several of these literary studies have accorded it only a passing reference. Professor Grube's comment oIn the effect of Athena's epiphany serves as a salutary corrective to those accounits which attach too much weight to the apprently benevolent aspects of the gods suggested in certain earlier portions of the play: '. . . it is the goddess Athena herself, beyond sorrow and beyond feeling, who says the last word.... There is no peace for mankiind, certainly no peace from the gods."'2 In Professor Kitto's account (one of the few which argue for a serious moral tragedy in the Suppliants) there is curiously little discussion of the gods. It is true that they cointribute little that is positive to what this critic believes to be the main theme of the play,"3 but we might, perhaps, expect some mention of their ambiguous relation to what workings of justice can be found in it. Professor Zuntz, on the other hand, un- equivocally includes the gods, as the dispensers of world-order, in the optimistic, rational view of the world which he finds to be the basic conceptioni of this play. What is more, he emphasizes the contrast betweeni this coniception anid Euripides' usual "boundless aind impenetrable" world, with its inexorable gods, and suggests an explanation of the iniconsistency which is at least more worthy of our poet than talk about his confused nostalgia for tradition: His compassion for the absurd and ruinous sufferings brought upon mankind by their own shortsightedness prompted Euripides, for once, to narrow his all-embracing and ironical view. Identifying himself with a 12 Grube 242. 13 "The theme is the same as that of the Hecuba and Troades, the communal suffer- ing that comes from communal wrong-doing and folly" (Kitto 223). Professor Kitto's clear exposition of this view of the theme perhaps does more than justice to the unity of the Suppliants, allowing, as it does, a full measure of tragic significance (within the frame-work of the whole play) to the concluding passages. But in regarding Adrastus and the Argives as the central tragic figures, this critic diminishes the thematic import- ance of the central "political" portions of the play, and, specifically, of the decisions of Theseus and Athens, on whom the dramatic action of the play depends.</page><page sequence="6">Vol. lxxxvii] Euripides' Suppliants 13 definite set of contemporary ideals, he offered his fellows, in the time- honoured form of tragedy, some definite and salutary teaching.14 Professor Zuntz's idea of the theme of the Suppliants stems di- rectly from this basic conception. We may readily agree that the play is mainly concerned with the preservation of those laws without which this optimistic view of the world (i.e., "civilization", on the human level) would be impossible, but it is possible that the brilliant analysis by which Zuntz "proves" this theme presents a rather more idealized picture than the text of the play will support. Thus, for example, he imputes to Theseus (at line 195 if.) a clearer account than the speaker actually gives us of the world as "a well-ordered whole, the life of which is safe-guarded, for the good of man, by wholesome, rational laws.""5 This tendency toward idealization leads the critic to overlook certain ironies and disturbing flashes of realism or iconoclasm which Euripides allows to play around the central theme. The most marked of these are the touches of ambiguity which surround the treatment of the gods and of religion in this play. Some such hints occur in the earlier portions of the play, but it is not until the political action is over and the main theme all but expressed that they are developed. Professor Zuntz's analysis is at its best when it concerns the earlier portions of the play: the reason for this may be that the dramatist himself, failing to sustain his main theme evenly throughout the play, allows more prominence to attach to the minor themes (including those con- cerning the gods and the punishment of hybris) in the later, less dramatic passages. In sharp contrast with Professor Zuntz's "optimistic" interpre- tation of the Suppliants is that of Mr. L. H. G. Greenwood. Like Professor Kitto, Mr. Greenwood stresses the pacifistic passages in the play and regards it as a serious moral tragedy; Mr. Greenwood, however, goes further in this direction and suggests that not only the war waged by Adrastus but even the apparently just war of Theseus is included in the condemnation of war implied by the pacifistic tone which underlies the whole. Thus, neither in technique nor in atti- tude, according to Mr. Greenwood's view, is the Suppliants to be contrasted with other Euripidean plays; here as elsewhere, "Euri- 14 Zuntz 22.

(One would not deny that something of what Zuntz states is at least implied in Theseus' speech at line 195 ff. but, as we shall see, Theseus himself has his reservations about this divine ordering and safe-guarding of life. See below, pp. 17-21.)</page><page sequence="7">14 D. J. Conacher [1956 pides wishes some of his readers ... to perceive that he says one thing and means another."'6 Mr. Greenwood applies this view of the dramatist's satirical intent to the apparently glorious action of Theseus and, since he believes that Theseus is to be accepted as a thoroughly pious man, to the gods whom Theseus serves. "The piety of Theseus . . is less attractive when the divine objects of it are shown to be unworthy of reverence and obedience."17 Mr. Greenwood's perception that, even in the Suppliants, there are underlying ironies and that these attach particularly to the appar- ently pious and orthodox tones in the play, is very valuable. But the thesis to which this perception is attached, namely that the war of Theseus is wrong and leads only to further suffering, finds little support in the text of the play.18 The present paper will seek to argue that, even within a more conventional, straightforward theme (such as that described by Professor Zuntz), Euripides preserves something of his own critical attitude toward conventional piety and the current modifications of myth on which it depended. II Enough has now been said to indicate that most critics regard the religious attitude expressed in the Suppliants as "orthodox" or even 16 Greenwood 92; for the general view of the play cited above, see ibid. chap. 4 passim, esp. 92-93, 99-103. 17 Ibid. 113. Here and elsewhere in his analysis Mr. Greenwood's arguments con- cerning Euripides' implicit criticism of the gods in this play are similar to suggestions raised later in the present paper; cf. particularly his interpretations of Supp. 594-97, 731-32, 778-85, 1213-26 (Greenwood 113-14, 117, 114, 104-5, respectively). There are, however, two important points in Mr. Greenwood's thesis with which the writer disagrees: these concern the (alleged) orthodox piety of Theseus (ibid. 113 and 116) and the (alleged) Euripidean criticism of Theseus' war against Thebes (see below, note 18). Difference of opinion on these matters entails a rather different treatment of the pas- sages concerning the gods and of the place of such passages in the structure of the play. 18 If (as Mr. Greenwood argues, ibid. 102-3) Euripides meant us to regard Theseus' armed intervention as wrong, surely he would dwell on the suffering that it brought to Theseus and his city. But on the contrary, Theseus' triumph, his moderation in victory and his subsequent serene demeanour are contrasted sharply with the sufferings of Adrastus and of Creon for their hybristic actions in military matters. Nor can Theseus be regarded as the cause, except in a very superficial sense, of the anguished laments of the Argive mothers, or of the immolation of Evadne, after he has won back the bodies. Mr. Greenwood's further argument, that this war is "wasteful folly," be- cause bones are not worth it, seems to find some support in the speech of Iphis at 1104-7, which he quotes. But while line 1107 may represent Euripides' own view of the unim- portance of the bones themselves, there is no doubt that the Suppliant Mothers want them (and find a grievous satisfaction in the obsequies) nor that Euripides, like The- seus, is defending their time-honoured rights. There is no need to quote Voltaire to suggest that these two aspects of Euripides' attitude are not incompatible.</page><page sequence="8">Vol. lxxxvii] Euripides' Suppliants 15 pious, and that many have felt that the play differs sharply, in this respect, from other plays of Euripides. From the few serious ex- planations which have been considered, it is clear that either one must accept this difference of approach as intentional, a part of some special purpose of Euripides in this play, or else one must re-examine the text to see whether Euripides' "orthodoxy" is not more apparent than real. What, then, are the main bases of this general impression of a conforming traditionalism in the Suppliants? All but a few critics agree in accepting a straightforward inter- pretation of the main action of the play, that the decision of Theseus and Athens is to be regarded as the right one, and that Athens per- forms a noble deed in aiding the Suppliants. Professor Zuntz has given perhaps the best expression to the theme of the play as it appears from this interpretation of the central action: Theseus (in his speech at 195 ff.) has declared his belief in an optimistic view of the world, based on law and order, and the Athenian democracy (as it has appeared in Theseus' account of it to the Herald, particularly at 429 ff.) is the best embodiment of that law and order within the state; therefore Theseus and Athens go to war with tyrannical Thebes to preserve, in the international sphere, those laws without which civilization, the rational ordering of society, is impossible.19 To what extent are the gods involved in Euripides' expression of this theme? First of all, the idea of recovering the bodies of the slain warriors is itself related to the religious rites which the Sup- pliants wish to perform for them. Secondly, Theseus himself refers to his undertaking as a championship of the vo,uos waXatos bai,uovwv (563). Thus on the literal level of interpretation Theseus, in honouring the Suppliants, who are protected by Zeus, and in assisting the sacred rights of the dead, may be said to be fulfilling the will of the gods - and it is mainly on this basis that one first gets the impression that Euripides is adhering to a pious orthodoxy in this play. But it is quite possible to view the accepted convention of returning the bodies of slain warriors as a test-case, almost a symbol, of internatioinal law, quite apart from its technical religious associations. It is worth noting, in this connection, that Theseus, in his arguments to the Herald concerning the return of the bodies, uses rigorously rational arguments (524 ff.) and does not even 19 See Zuntz 7-9.</page><page sequence="9">16 D. J. Conacher [1956 mention the religious aspects of the convention. So also, the re- ported appeal of Theseus' herald to the Thebans, just before the battle, is based only on the grounds of panhellenic law (669-72). Is it necessary, then, to believe that the gods are involved in that defence of order and justice among men with which the real theme of the play is concerned? There are several passages in the play in which a conception of the gods quite incompatible with this view appears. It should be admitted at the outset that Aethra views the sup- plication in a religious light. Her statements in the Prologue, the whole significance of the Eleusinian setting,20 and the emphasis on the suppliant bonds, which continues to the end of Theseus' initial refusal of the Suppliants, clearly start the play off on this religious basis. But Theseus himself is somewhat slow to take up this issue: his first reaction is to avoid the dangers which involvement with Adrastus seems to entail. As far as the main theme of the play is concerned, the significance of Theseus' interrogation of Adrastus, and of his consequent refusal to accept his plea, has been clearly stated by several scholars: in this episode, the dramatist first of all dissociates Theseus and Athens from the earlier guilt of Adrastus, in attacking Thebes, and clarifies the motives from which Theseus later does decide to help the Argives: neither the original rashness of Adrastus, nor indeed his own personal character, however hybristic, has anything to do with the principle on which Theseus ultimately acts.21 (Various commentators have also suggested contemporary political meanings for this passage,22 but these suggestions, whether 20 Euripides adopted the Eleusinian setting from Aeschylus' play, the Eleusinians (based on the same legend), but he used it for his own purposes. Aethra's mention of her interrupted prayer to Kore and Demeter for the Athenian crops (a prayer which she now extends to include also the happiness of her own native Argive town) permits us, for a moment, to see the whole of the subsequent action as a kind of fertility ritual en- suring Athenian and Argive prosperity: the familiar elements of carrying out the dead and pacifying the nether powers are both present and surely it is no coincidence that the Chorus cries, "Honour the chorus of Hades" (75) at precisely the same line in its song as Aethra has mentioned Kore and Demeter (34) in her account of the supplication which interrupted her sacrifice. 21 This is substantially the view of Professor Zuntz (7-9). Cf. also the similar interpretations of this passage by Professors Grube (230-33) and Kitto (224-25). Professor Grube, however, distinguishes more acutely between the religious and emo- tional appeal of the chorus and Aethra and the more political (and bungling) appeal of Adrastus. Professor Kitto places more emphasis on the wrong-doing of Adrastus in relation to the major theme as he sees it: "the communal suffering that comes from communal wrong-doing and folly" (223). 22 This is, of course, one of the key passages for those whose main interest in the play is its alleged inspiration (either in anticipation or in retrospect) by the Argive pact</page><page sequence="10">Vol. lxxxvii] Euripides' Supplitants 17 true or not, are not needed for the understanding of its dramatic function.) However, it is in this first exchange between Theseus and Adrastus that the dramatist also suggests, incidentally and tentatively, a hint of Theseus' view of the gods. Our first intimation of Theseus' "theological position" occurs in connection with his attitude to augury, which is both interesting and rather perplexing. Theseus questions Adrastus closely on his initial involvement in Theban affairs and discovers that it was on the basis of a Delphic oracle that the Argive King came to marry his daughter to Polyneices (133-46). Next, Theseus criticizes Adras- tus sharply for his neglect of his own augur, Amphiareus, when making war on Thebes in the interest of the dispossessed Polyneices (155-57-59-61). Furthermore, in his speech on the foundations of civilization (195 ff.), Theseus praises the prophet's art, based on fire, sacrificial entrails and on the flight of birds (211-13), among those gifts to man vaguely ascribed to some unknown god (201-2). There follows (214-18) a sneer at those who do not regard such divine gifts as sufficient, who think themselves wiser than the gods, and this sneer leads directly to Theseus' main criticism of Adrastus: "yoked to the oracles of Phoebus" (220), he connected his house with a troubled, unhealthy house, and, influenced by ambitious youths, he plunged into war despite his augurs' warnings (219-37). It is interesting that, in branding Adrastus as one of those who are "too clever" to be content with the normal gifts of augury, Theseus should include a sneer at the Delphic Oracle. Some com- mentators, however, take this reference to Delphi in a concessive sense, i.e., "though you paid attention to the gods in the first in- stance, and so married off your children at the Oracle's behest, you failed to heed your augurs' objections to your proposed attack on Thebes."23 It seems easier, however, to regard Theseus' criticism of 420 and by the political ferment which preceded it. For various interpretations, in these contemporary terms, of the anti-Argive sentiments inferred from this passage, cf. Lugge 23; Gregoire (above, note 4) 83 ff.; Delebecque 213-14. Berlage (above, note 10) 185, arguing in a similar vein, suggests that Theseus' criticisms at 237 ff. may be directed against Alcibiades, whereas Greenwood (112) believes that the criticism of Argos in the whole of this passage (232-245) is meant to apply to contemporary Athen- ian democracy. Goosens (17 ff.) pushes the historical reference of this belaboured passage some years further back: he suggests that Theseus' criticisms of Adrastus' rash attack on Thebes echoes Pericles' cautious disapproval of Tolmides' subsequently dis- astrous expedition in 447 (see Plut. Per. 18.2-3). 23 Cf., for example, Hermann's note to Supp. 221: "'Tu,' inquit, 'filias hospitibus dedisti, oraculo monitus, ideoque sic, ut qui esse deos crederes: mox autem expeditionem suscepisti, neglectis vatum monitis, ut si nulli essent dii.'

Conacher [1956 of Adrastus as including his allegiance to Delphi: Adrastus' marriage of his daughter to Polyneices, which is what this particular oracle led to, can hardly be taken as an example of following the will of the gods, for it was precisely this action which led to war with Thebes, which Theseus clearly shows to have been done in rash disregard of the gods. Though it is impossible to be certain about this pas- sage (the point is not perhaps of fundamental importance), the im- plication seems to be that Delphi does not speak for the gods. This initerpretation, too, suggests a possible meaning for the expression Cs @WVTwv OE'v (221), which has caused considerable discussion. The dramatist makes his Athenian king despise the direct political abuse of prophecy practised at Delphi cWs PWcvTcwv 0ECov, i.e., as if the gods were like human beings, directly interfering in political affairs.24 In general, then, Theseus' view of Adrastus' trouble seems to be this: the family of Polyneices was accursed of the gods, unhealthy, and so dangerous, and Adrastus ought to have kept his "healthy" household away from it. The reference to the gods here, far from suggesting political intervention, "side-taking," on their part, sup- ports the common-sense judgment, not to mix the prosperous with the unprosperous: IovA a'd o E's -r's -vXas r/^yo',eo KOvas~ 'yap 6 oE Ta TvX ?7)vOLEvOs TroLs Tro-v voooVTros 7r7fIaav 5tWXEo-,E TOV vovoUoTvra KOU3Ev 7&amp;K?7KOTa.

Nicklin (The Suppliant Women [Oxford 1936] ad loc.) also find the point of this passage to lie in the contrast between Adrastus' acting first as if the gods existed and later as if they did not. Grube, however, stresses that even in the first instance only "pretended piety" is suggested. 24 A different interpretation of W's t6vrwv OE&amp;v has already been quoted from several scholars in the preceding note. We may now quote a few comments and translations which approach, at various distances, the interpretation suggested in the text of our argument.

Cf. also Greenwood 115-16, who concludes that the passage, con- sidered in its total context (219-28), suggests some satire of Delphi. 25 It seems preferable to take t6XEo-E (227) as a gnomic aorist, in which case we would read Xp7, with Hartung, instead of xpiiv, in 223.

Cf.</page><page sequence="12">Vol. lxxxvii] Euripides' Suppliants 19 Certainly Theseus is "god-fearing," in the sense that he wants to keep on the right side of these dangerous powers. (His attitude here reminds one of that peculiarly Homeric mixture of common- sense and superstition; indeed, many particular superstitions are merely common-sense judgements translated into supernatural terms.) One gets little impression, however, that Theseus relies on any particular gods, or that he has any real assurance that the gods, generally, are on the side of justice. The passage just quoted does not suggest any scrupulous regard for justice on their part, and an- other passage where Theseus indulges in general reflections on the vicissitudes of human experience, even conveys an impression of rather wanton gods: Some men fare well soon, others late. The god, then, fares sumptu- ously26 for he is held in high honour by the unfortunate man, that he may become fortunate, while the prosperous man also gives him the highest praise, for fear that the favouring gale may leave him (550-5). On the other hand, Theseus' wariness with regard to the gods and to those who are not favoured by them, does appear again in that pas- sage (591 ff.) in which he insists that Adrastus shall not accompany him to battle, even in a just cause. It is Aethra, the exponent throughout of conventional piety, who reminds Theseus of his duty to the Suppliants, quite apart from the rights and wrongs of Adrastus' initial entanglement in Theban affairs. also Paley's note ad loc. In 228, Top ov voaoivra (Lambinus), which Nauck accepts, is certainly the easier reading, but if TOP OvvvooPoi'vra is correct, the total meaning of our translation is but little affected, for either expression could be used to refer to the com- paratively innocent party, i.e., the one who is either not (morally) sick (r6v ov voo-oivra) or who is so only by association (TOv Ovvvo?ooivra). 26 TpvFx 6' o balMwv (552): this interesting phrase has been variously rendered, e.g.: "Fortuna vero ludit" (Barnes); "Fortuna autem petulans est" (Markland); "illudente nobis Fortuna" (I. A. Hartung's paraphrase in Euripides' Restitutus 2 [Hamburg 1844] 94); "Und die Gottheit schaltet mit uns nach Laune" (Wilamowitz); "Les Dieux seuls sont choyes a l'exces" (Gr6goire). It is noteworthy that the later translations avoid the term Fortuna or its equivalents; if we do so translate daimon, we should take care not to regard the expression as a mere figure of speech. In all the passages in which this word occurs in the singular in this play (463, 552, 592, 1008), there is some reference to the anonymous, divine power on whom one's fortunes, good or ill, so often seem to depend. As Nilsson has well observed, this is one of the words which, in some of their fifth century usages, preserve something of the old, pre-anthro- pomorphic conception of the supernatural as undifferentiated "power." (See M. P. Nilsson, A History of Greek Religion, tr. F. J. Fielden [Oxford 1949] 105 ff., 227, 282-85.) This suits Theseus' cautious attitude to the gods to whom he rarely refers by name and from whom he rarely seems to expect much in the way of personal favour or meticulous j ustice.</page><page sequence="13">20 D. J. Conacher [1956 The motherly rebuke with which she begins her plea tends to sub- stantiate the contrast which we have suggested between her piety and Theseus' attitude to the gods: "I bid you, my son, look first to what concerns the gods (Ta T-v Oewv), lest in dishonouring them you go astray: for in this one matter you are lacking (or4XXet -yap evrov'T uovc)27 though in all else most wise" (301-3). Moreover, after this one reference to the gods, Aethra couches her speech in terms which will appeal particularly to Theseus. It is a speech which combines, with subtle and skilful rhetoric, political arguments on both the ideal and the practical level: intervention oIn behalf of the Suppliants will bring Theseus and Athens honour, while abstention will look like cowardice, but the goal of this intervention spells the very mean- ing of civilized relations between states: ... ro yap rot orvvExov avopw.rwv &amp; rXEts rovT' c- orav'ran TLs robs Vo'ovs a4prr KaXc'.s (312-3). This view of Theseus' general conception of the gods and of divine power which we have been seeking to adduce may seem to contra- dict his role as defender of "the ancient laws of the gods" (563). Yet neither in the arguments by which Theseus is persuaded to aid the Suppliants, nor in the reasons which he himself gives for his decision, nor even in the arguments which he presents to the Theban Herald, is there any emphasis on the religious aspect of his missioil. The emphasis is rather on the preservation of panhellenic law and on the punishment of hybristic tyrants who would deny the rights of other Greek states (526-27, 538 if., 561 if., 575). Not until the last line of his long speech to the Herald does the expression vo,uos iraXatos 5aau6ovwv (563) occur: though Theseus does not (with the exceptioni of one conventional phrase at line 348) use the gods in his specific arguments about the law, he naturally follows tradition in speaking of them as the originators of human customs in general. A similar explanation can be given for Theseus' reference to the gods in his speech at line 195 f, in which he states his optimistic view of the world as men know it, where the good exceeds the bad and where intelligence and order can operate if only man makes use of them. Here, too, Theseus attributes the original dispensation to the gods or, rather, to some god unknowin and unnamed (201-2). Euripides 27 So Nauck and Paley (following Elmsley's emendation) though both think that line 303 may be spurious. However, the sense of this passage fits well with Theseus' attitude to the gods as we find it expressed elsewhere in this play. Moreover, this reading is closer to the MSS readings than is Marchant's transposition, with the emenda- tion 'aOa4X-s, adopted by Murray.</page><page sequence="14">Vol. lxxxvii] Euripides' Suppliants 21 could hardly have such a legendary figure as King Theseus do other- wise. From the difficulties just suggested, it will be apparent that one cannot be dogmatic or categorical about Euripides' attitude to the gods in the Suppliants. Even Theseus, the least orthodox element in the play, accepts the traditional explanations as a sort of mythical background to his world-view, but these have little influence on his actual decisions, which are based on ethical rather than on religious considerations. Moreover, as we have seen from various asides, Theseus' confidence in the gods' justice toward men is by no means absolute. Indeed, his parting words (592-97) as he leaves to wage a just war could serve as the text for another theme which receives ambiguous treatment in the Suppliants: the idea of the gods as moral avengers, punishing the hybris of men. III For with my own daimon I'll take the field, illustrious in a glorious war. One thing only do I need, to have the gods who honour justice; Justice and the gods: these two together bring the victory. Valour alone brings naught, unless it has the gods' good-will. (592-97) With these words, Theseus bids the ill-starred Adrastus stay out of the battle. By the word daimon, the King appears to mean his own personal fate which depends on his own relationship with the gods.28 Theseus has confidence in this, as well as in the valour and righteousness of his cause. Nevertheless, there is at least a hint in this passage that not all the gods do honour justice29 and that only with the fortunate coincidence of the gods and justice will arete win the day. (The passage reminds one of Hecuba 1029-30; there too, whichever reading we accept, we find the same idea that justice and the gods do not always coincide in issues of revenge.) The question about the gods and justice, which is hardly made explicit in Theseus' ambiguous phrasing, is developed in the exchange which now follows between the two halves of the Chorus (598-633: Matthiae's hemi-choric distribution, which is followed by Nauck, 28 Cf. above, note 26; cf. also LSJ s.v. daim6n 1.2. 29 Some translators (e.g., Markland, Gr6goire) take 0oot (594) as referring to all the gods; Matthiae, on the other hand, translates it quotquot, against Markland's ill- substantiated argument that this cannot here be the meaning of the word. Although there may be an intentional ambiguity on the part of the poet here, surely it is quite possible to take the clause as restrictive and partitive.</page><page sequence="15">22 D. J. Conacher [1956 seems preferable, in view of the disputatious content of the passage, to Murray's attributions to individual choreutae). The more pessimis- tic half of the Chorus, alarmed by the fresh outbreak of war, wonders what the causes of these things can be. When their confident com- panions assure them that some happy fate attends Theseus, the doubters dissociate themselves from this confidence in just gods (610) and mutter darkly that the gods differ greatly from men in many matters (612).3? The optimists again assure them: "though vengeance has called forth vengeance, and slaughter, slaughter, the gods eventually grant respite and set a term to all these ills" (614-6). The arrival of the Messenger with news of Theseus' victory seems to vindicate this hope and now the whole chorus joins in affirming their belief in the gods as avengers of justice (731-3). But the play is not over yet, and we are reminded of similar triumphant cries in the Heracles (738, 757 if., 772-3) when the gods seem to have wrought justice for the hero's family, only to cap their protection, in the sequel, with worse woes. No such horrendous reversal occurs in the Suppliants, but we are soon to see the clouds of war re-forming, despite the Mothers' prayers. The triumph of Theseus appears to conclude one of the minor themes of the Suppliants, the punishment of hybris at the hands of the just gods. This theme has been first introduced by the Theban Herald, when he warns Theseus (494 if.) against rescuing the bodies of men whom hybris has overthrown. It is interesting, in view of the sequel, that it is the hybris of Capaneus on which the Herald particularly dwells. The Chorus accepts this guilt, but declares that the punishment belongs to Zeus, who has already exacted it. When Theseus' victory is announced, with special emphasis upon the restraint of Theseus in not seeking to capture Thebes, Adrastus affirms Zeus' control of human affairs and gives moral testimony of the just sequence of hybris and punishment which has been suffered by the Argives and the Thebans in turn. This seems a neat con- clusion to the moral theme but once again, as in the apparently happy fulfilment of the chorus' prayers, there is a sequel. IV Whatever we may regard as the leading theme of the Suppliants, the play seems to undergo a curious disintegration after the triumph m Line 612 is admittedly obscure; there may be a hint in it that the gods (in the speakers' opinion) act differently from the way which men think right. See Paley's note ad loc.</page><page sequence="16">Vol. lxxxvii] Euripides' Suppliants 23 of Theseus over the Thebans. If we regard the theme as the vindi- cation, by an idealized Athenian state, of those ancient laws of the Greeks on which their civilization depends, then that theme has now passed through all its phases: its first expression in the absolute and simple terms of the Prologue and the first stasimon, its ago6n (rejec- tion, reformulation, and acceptance) in the "political complication," and its eventual fulfilment in the victory of the law-respecting The- seus over the hybristic Thebans. Now Euripides turns to the sor- rowing mothers receiving their dead, and expresses, in pathetic counterpoint with the cries of victory and the false heroics of the funeral speech, the true picture of war's aftermath. This is a sub- ject on which Euripides is always most eloquent, and which the Athenians of that day must have found deeply moving; in the severe terms of formal criticism, however, it must be censured as bearing little relation to the main theme as we have seen it so far. Nevertheless, this final portion of the play (778-1234) does, when considered by itself, manifest a most satisfying form and meaning and does develop, sometimes with ironic comment, one or two of the minor themes which we have just been discussing. The oppositions which inform this passage may be described as follows: the Chorus sets the dominant theme of lamentation, of pure grief, which wants nothing but to be left alone, with no false joy or fresh sorrow to disturb it; twice these lamentations are interrupted, once by the intrusive and banal consolations of the funeral speech and again by the promise of vengeance (reinforced by Athena's pro- nouncements) from the sons of the slain chieftains. It is in these interruptions that an ironic twist is given to the minor themes of the play, the punishment of hybris and the justice of the gods. (We have omitted the Evadne episode [990-1113] from this brief analysis: it may perhaps be regarded as an extreme, and rather intrusive, dramatization of the grief which the Chorus expresses for the dead chieftains. The fact that it is a young woman who im- molates herself upon her husband's pyre permits a further dramatic parallel: the lament of Evadne's father Iphis [1080 ff.] echoes with a more immediate poignancy the grief which the Chorus has just expressed for its own children.) The dominant tone of this whole movement of the drama is well expressed in the lyric which marks the transition from Theseus' triumph to the grief of the Argive mothers as they view their dead:</page><page sequence="17">24 D. J. Conacher [1956 Some things are well but others are grievous; for the city there is renown, but for me it is bitter to see the spent limbs of my children ... to gaze upon the greatest sorrow of all (778 ff.). The antistrophe takes up the theme which is to haunt the rest of the lamentations in this play: the grief and futility of this child-rearing, the wish for death before bearing sons for such a fate (786 ff.; com- pare 918 ff., 955 ff., 1087 ff., 1135 ff.). In sharp contrast to this grieving lyric and the first kommos which completes it, comes the funeral speech of Adrastus (857 ff.). Many conjectures have been made concerning the possible fifth century reference of the encomia here expressed.3' Theseus' request that Adrastus tell the younger Athenian citizens whence these heroes came by their surpassing courage does perhaps suggest that Euri- pides is giving a lesson in contemporary virtue and the emphasis first on civic virtue and secondly on certain features of contempor- ary, fifth century society (e.g., at 888-895) tends to support this view. Even so, one should note that the passage is not without its ironic overtones. In the earlier parts of the play, we have seen the Argive leaders (not merely Adrastus) branded as hybristic; nlow, once the tumult and the shouting have died, they become, as heroes slain in battle, the exemplars of the conventional virtues. (There may be something in the view of Lucas, and of Wecklein before him, that Euripides is here satirizing dishonest exaggerations in the annual encomia of the city's dead.)32 This irony is particularly marked in the case of Capaneus, now praised for a life of moderation, for the punishment of Capaneus was earlier marked by the Theban Herald, and accepted by the Chorus, as the most obvious case of Zeus' punishment of hybris (496 ff., and 512). Finally, the deaths of all these heroes, previously treated as the work of an aveinging Zeus, are now regarded as proof that good training provides the sense of honour requisite for a noble death. In this context, the 31 For a summary, as well as a rebuttal, of a representative group of such conjec- tures, see Gilbert Norwood, Essays in Euripidean Drama (Toronto 1954) 126-9. (Norwood's own view of the funeral speech is considered below, note 33.) The most extreme of the "fifth century identifications" of the chieftains celebrated in the funeral speech are to be found in Giles' article (above, note 1) which has been sharply critiziced even by the "historical interpreters" of this play, most of whom are content with finding less specific contemporary significance in this passage. Delebecque (216), for ex- ample, cites the funeral speech as one of the "pro-Argive" passages, in his interpretation of the play in terms of contemporary politics. 32 D. W. Lucas, The Greek Tragic Poets (London 1950) 168; cf. also note 18 (ad loc.), for Lucas' reference to Wecklein.</page><page sequence="18">Vol. lxxxvii] Euripides' Suppliants 25 concluding aphorism on the teachability of virtue ("Courage is teachable ... if, indeed, the child is taught to see and hear what he does not understand" 911-13) must surely have a mocking ring to it. What have the Mothers to say of all this glory? 'IJ' rEKVOV, bvo7vxii u' `7peoov... (918 ff.). It was not for this they raised their sons.33 The chorus (955 ff.) which follows soon after this restores the pure note of mourning and here the quality of grief expressed clearly gives the lie to any consolations which seek to interrupt it. The grief of an old age bereaved of children is aimless and insatiable, "wandering like some cloud" (961), belonging neither to the living nor the dead, feeding on the relics left about the empty house, waking only to fresh tears in the early morning (968-79). The second kommos is changed by the Chorus and the sons of the chieftains, who enter bearing their fathers' corpses. The Mothers continue their familiar theme, lamenting the fruitless labours of their motherhood, but again they are interrupted, this time by the cries of vengeance from the Sons. This cry brings fear rather than hope to the Chorus: ("this evil sleeps not yet.... Enough of woe....." 1147, 1149). As the Sons develop the image of themselves clad in the armour of vengeance and strive to hear an order to battle voiced by their fathers' shades, the Chorus seeks to replace these thoughts with gentler images of love.34 The hint of 33Norwood's attack (loc. cit., above, note 31) on the inappropriateness of the funereal tributes, particularly the tribute to Capaneus, are just, but our tentative ac- count of the whole speech as Euripidean irony seems easier than the purely hypothetical explanation which Norwood advances: that this passage (together with many others which, for various reasons, he finds exceptionable) belonged to a fourth century closet- play whose author (later identified as Moschion) might permit himself "esoteric refer- ences and outrageous whimsies" in the company of his indulgent friends. (Norwood [above, note 31] 167-69; cf. chap 4, passim, exp. 152 ff., for his general argument con- cerning the composition of the Suppliants.) In this as in other parts of Norwood's argument on the Suppliants, the thesis proposed seems more difficult to accept, failing any direct evidence to support it, than the difficulties which it seeks to remove. 34 Lines 1140-52 have been variously assigned between the Chorus and the Sons; Kirchoff's attribution of 1143-45 and 1150-52 to the Chorus has been responsible for much subsequent confusion: although it enables one to retain TK POp at 1145 (the read- ing of both L and P, which must be changed if these lines belong to the Sons), it com- pletely destroys the sense of the exchange between the Mothers and the Sons, and also requires further text changes at 1143, 1144, and 1150 (see critical notes in Murray's and Gregoire's texts). The summary of this passage given above follows Murray's text and attributions, in which it is clear that the martial notes belong to the Sons and the peaceful dissuasions to the Mothers. It is in this context that we must understand the exchange at 1153-54; Paley's impression here of war-like Mothers seems quite gratuitous and quite out of keeping with their cry "Enough of woes !" at 1149.</page><page sequence="19">26 D. J. Conacher [1956 vengeance seems to pass; no mention of it is made in the mild ex- change between Theseus and Adrastus, as the human action of the play closes with Theseus' reminder and Adrastus' acceptance of the debt of gratitude which Argos owes to Athens. This peaceful, if sombre, close to the play is abruptly rent by the harsh commands of Athena in the epilogue. Much has already been written on the possible contemporary significance both of her instructions and of the manner in which they are to be fulfilled. We may content ourselves here with suggesting the relation between these divine commands and the thought and action, on the human level, which has preceded them. Theseus, guided by Aethra, has obeyed the nomos palaios in helping the Argives; he asks for no specific payment, but he looks to Adrastus for the same ethical grasp of the nomos palaios which he has shown himself, and Adrastus accepts this bond, in gratitude (1178-79). The goddess Athena is content with no such lofty covenant: she insists (1185-1210) that the Argives be bound by a unilateral military pact, ensured by the use of most sacred and enduring objects in the treaty rites. Athena's second command (1213-1226) is to the Argive Sons: let their beards not be grown before they seek murderous vengeance on the Thebans for their fathers' deaths! Certainly this idea of vengeance runs counter to the thought, so prominent in the earlier parts of the play, that the Argives have suffered just punishment from the gods for their own hybris. Even the Suppliant Mothers have refused the consolations of revenge: they must now remember bitterly their earlier hope that the gods grant men respite from their ills and even bring them to an end at last (615-6). Now comes the prophecy of Athena that an Argive army will march "with god" (1226) to avenge the slaughtered chieftains. In this, as in the god- dess' strictures oIn Theseus' merely "moral" pact, Athena's pro- nouncements cap the latent irony in this play's treatment of the just and kindly gods.</page></plain_text>
