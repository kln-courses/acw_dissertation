LEPPIK Augustana College, Sioux Falls, South Dakota A series of new discoveries has thrown some light on the perplexing life and behavior of social insects. The classic research of Karl von Frisch and his co-workers on "the dances of the bees" revealed the existence of a well- developed system of communication among insects. By performing certain circling dances which are accompanied by definite body movements, a bee is able to communicate information about the location and type of nectar plants. Besides these orientation dances, the writer of this article noticed some more types of "alarm" and "warning" dances, and a strange phenomenon called "bees' struggle" (Leppik, 1951a, 1951b; Bolle, 1952). Further con- tributions to the problem of bee "dances" have been made by F. Schneider (1949), P. Tschumi (1950), in Switzerland, M. H. Haydak (1932), V. G. Milum (1947), and A. L. Kroeber (1952) in the United States, Hein (1950) in the Netherlands, and several other workers in biology. These experiences of several workers have now enabled us to decipher the main part of a "sign language of bees"' and to assume the existence of further communication systems of social insects. The next question that arose was: can insects distinguish and memorize numbers, and if so, in what manner? Many flowering plants, whose fertilization and seed production is depend- ent upon insect pollination, have flowers with constant numbers of petals, sepals, and other floral parts. The dissimilarity of trimerous, tetramerous, and pentamerous flowers is so striking as to be able to serve as possible pointers for the pollinating insects. The amazing behavior of these insects * Data for this paper were recorded while the author was in the employment of the State Horticultural Research Institute and professor at the Technical University of Munich, Bavaria. 1 The term "language of bees"' is criticized for its anthropomorphic meaning which is misleading if applied in the case of communication of insects. The word "language" pertains to the tongue (lingua), which is the main organ used in human verbal speech. But insects do not use the tongue in their communi- cation. Kroeber (1952), discussing different viewpoints, concludes that "language" is not the appropriate term to express the way of communication of insects. Von Frisch uses in German the term "die Sprache," in quotation marks which has, however, a different origin and a more general meaning than our "language." "Sprechen" means "to speak" in general and does not pertain to the tongue. The author of this article proposed the introduction of a new term "melittolexis" (or "apilexis"). Melitta in Greek ([XiLTT(X) means bee and lexis ('X5ts, from XsEy) means "mode of expression," the compilation of signs or symbols (as a lex- icon), and a "language" as a general concept. Dialect (blcXXEXTOs ) is a local va- rietv of a general language. 229</page><page sequence="2">230 THE AMERICAN NATURALIST in remaining steadfast' to certain flower species, indicates that they have considerable ability of orientation among them. The steadfastness of bees, bumblebees, butterflies, and moths was established by several flower ecol- ogists (Lovell, 1918; Kugler, 1943; Werth, 1949; Frisch, 1950) and confirmed by the writer experimentally (Leppik, 1951). H. Kugler also recently observed some groups of flies (Eristalomyia and Syrphus) remaining steadfast to cer- tain flowers. From these circumstances it seems quite plausible to assume that some groups of pollinating insects have developed a certain ability to discrim- inate number. The writer (1948) attempted to bring some light to this ques- tion by special experiments and field observations. A series of tests have been performed in the State Horticultural College and Research Institute at Weihenstephan in Bavaria during the years 1945- 1950. This institution with its several research departments and sections dealing with flowers and ornamental plants, surrounded by rich wild flora, offered a most heterogenous material for these types of experiments and ob- servations. The main results of this study have been discussed previously (Leppik, 1948a, b; Bolle, 1952); whereas the manner in which the insects have been found to distinguish number is to be delineated briefly in this article. EXPERIMENTS WITH MARKED BEES Two closely related species of Mexican marigold, Tagetes patulus L. and T. signatus Bartl., were used for the experiments with marked bees (fig. 2). These species differ in the number of ray flowers. T. patulus normally has several ray flowers in contrast to T. signatus, which possesses regularly only 5 petaloid rays. Honey-bees, wild bees and other pollinating insects distinguish between these species. It could be assumed therefore that T. signatus is a product of a long selective activity of some specialized pol- linators, which have preferred the pentamerous forms among T. patulus. This assumption is supported by the fact that T. patulus has a clear tendency toward polymorphism since pentamerous and hexamerous types are not rare among the garden forms of this species. Beside having different numbers of ray flowers T. patulus and T. stignatus can be distinguished further by their different odors, color and size of heads. In a bee colony adjusted to certain marigold forms, some ray flowers were removed from a number of heads. In this way the number of rays could be changed from 10 to 5, from 5 to 2, etc. (table 1). The majority of the marked bees immediately avoided the abnormal heads. Others became confused by the different numbers in ray flowers and refused part of the abnormal blossoms, 2 Steadfast is recommended by H. M. Blegen to express the attitude of pollinating insects in visiting the flowers of only one type at a time and in not mixing the nec- tar or pollen of different plant species. It was believed formerly that bees are in- dividually constant to some single or few species, which faithfulness of bees was called "flower fidelity" (J. H. Lovell, 1918). This viewpoint is not quite correct and steadfastness is in our case not a synonym for "constancy." In German the term "Artstetigkeit" is used since long instead of "constancy."</page><page sequence="3">THE ABILITY OF INSECTS TO DISTINGUISH NUMBER 231 FIGURE 1.

Scout-bees, as much as could be observed, did not pay any attention to this change. If a great number of heads were changed in this way, bees finally adjusted themselves to the new combination. In the case of intense odors, bees decided on the basis of scent. According to these experiments, bees are able to remember and distin- guish the numbers 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 8, 10, and 12. It is remarkable that the numerical system of bees does not contain the "magic" numbers 7, 9, and 13 but have double meanings for 3 and 5. The most favored number for bees is 5. FIGURE 3. Symbols for numbers 1-12, which a worker bee was able to memorize and distinguish if these were connected with flower types. The way a bee uses numbers is quite different from our way. A bee can- not "count" but must have the numbers expressed in figures that it can easily memorize. The bees are able to distinguish only some few objects one from another. They were unable to make a clear distinction between marigold heads with 3 and 4 'petals and these numbers seem to be the limit of their "calculative" ability. They can, however, easily remember higher numbers if these are expressed in symmetrical figures. Figure 3 contains the symbols and figures for numbers a bee is able to distinguish; fig. 4 shows how these numbers are expressed in flower types.

These selected examples of flowers are arranged in table 2, ac- cording to their evolutionary trend from simple -4, radiate -4, protected ), to zygomorphic types,3 as follows: Zygomorphic types Definite number of flower t parts and bilateral symmetry Protected types Definite number of flower t parts and protected nectaries Radiate types Definite number of flower t parts Simplex types Indefinite number of flower parts The main groups of pollinators are placed corresponding to their special- ization and skill from left to right. By such arrangement of material we can establish a definite parallelism between the numbers expressed in flower types and the ability of main groups of pollinating insects to distinguish these numbers. The appearance and differentiation of numbers in the phylogeny of flowering plants can be co- ordinated with the gradual development of the number discrimination of pol- linating insects. It is remarkable, however, that the bumble-bees preferred zygomorphic types instead of numerical symmetry of radiate flowers. When the bumble- bee flowers are absent, these highly specialized pollinators visit radiate, capitulate and simple types,3 or manage even nectar robbery, from flowers not readily accessible to them. DISCUSSION OF RESULTS Both experiments with marked bees (fig. 2) and field observations (fig. 1) ascertained the ability of pollinating insects to distinguish definite flower types. But this ability, which seems to be dependent upon the stage of psychic development of the insects, varied considerably among the groups studied. Flies, beetle, and weevils commonly did not distinguish more than a few objects one from the other. These insects did not pay any attention to the change of numbers in flower parts. In the event they had to choose, beetles preferred commonly the simplex3 type with unrestricted number of petals and stamens. Bees, on the contrary, were able to distinguish and memorize different combinations of numbers as arranged in fig. 3. They also reacted instan- taneously to change in the numbers of flower parts. In addition to establishing the bees' knowledge of numbers, our experi- ments showed the presence of a keen sense of symmetry among the pollinat- ing insects, which is especially well developed among bumble-bees. 3Some main flower types are indicated according to the classification of the writer (1948, 1953 and fig. 4); Simplices, with unrestricted number of petals, and stamens are one of the oldest. Radiatae and protectae (nectar deposits protected) contain a definite number of petals and sepals. Zygomorphic types are the youngest.</page><page sequence="7">THE ABILITY OF INSECTS TO DISTINGUISH NUMBER 235 Numerous flower types mirror the high level of sense perception among the higher pollinating insects. Besides their colors, symmetry, odors, and number of flower parts, bees are able to remember and distinguish the nec- tar plants from numerous flowers exposed to pollinators at the same time. Every pollinator remembers the main characteristics of its flowers, knows where the nectar deposits are hidden, and is familiar with the occasionally complicated mechanism of pollination. SOME CONCLUSIONS One of the most important conclusions which can be derived from the ex- periments mentioned above is that pollinating insects show a strong tend- ency to consider a flower type as a whole. Pollinators are attracted to the flowers neither by their colors, nor by odor alone,-as was assumed by several earlier ecologists. If a pollinating insect is steadfast to certain flower type, it must remember all essential characteristics of this flower: size, color, number of flower parts, symmetry, and odor. Even the speediest pol- linators, such as sphinx moths, before touching the plant, take time to ex- amine the main characteristics of every flower (fig. 1). Removal of only a single petal or exposure of differently colored varieties of the same species causes bees to notice the difference, but they consider other characteris- tics of this flower and will continue to visit all varieties as long as the nectaries are not removed. The study of flower types in connection with pollinating insects may re- veal some principal factors in the evolution of flowering plants. The ability of pollinating insects to distinguish and remember numbers may have an im- portant selective value among different varieties and ecotypes of flowering plants. In this way, pollinating insects can direct the evolution of flowers toward certain types with definite numbers of flower parts, as is the case of many flowers such as radiate and protective types (fig. 4, middle row). SUMMARY Pollinating insects, bees, bumble-bees, butterflies, and moths have been found able to distinguish numbers, if these are expressed in symmetrical figures as pictured in fig. 3. This ability seems to be dependent upon the stage of psychic development of insects and varies considerably among different groups. Different groups of numbers are clearly expressed in the flower types (fig. 4) and may serve as pointers for pollinating insects to find their plants. The comparative study of trimerous, tetramerous, and pentamerous flower types provides a new approach to the evolution of flowering plants. LITERATURE CITED Bolle, Fritz., 1952, Bienenkrieg.
