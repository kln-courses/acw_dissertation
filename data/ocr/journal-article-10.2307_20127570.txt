<plain_text><page sequence="1">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT?TOWARDS AN UNDERSTANDING OF FOURTEENTH CENTURY PHILOSOPHY AND PSYCHOLOGY ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE A His essay is concerned with two theses about enjoyment to be found in William of Ockham: (1) Enjoyment is a certain kind of love, and (2) Enjoyment is a cause of pleasure, not the same thing as pleasure or an effect of it. Its own thesis is that Ockham's extensive discussions of such topics in human nature as love, pleasure, and voli tion, as well as cognition, deserve not only more attention but more varied attention than they typically receive: Ockham can fruitfully be read as a contemporary philosopher of mind (to help determine, for example, whether enjoying is referentially transparent or opaque), as a pre- and possibly super-Humean founder of behavioral science, and as a committed philosophical theologian (his own central claim in the material to be considered is that the only fully appropriate object of enjoyment is God); further, in each of these ways he can well be taken either in the abstract or as a pivotal historical figure in such larger late medieval-early modern movements of thought as involve a con ception of what human beings are and what they can or should do. In view of this spread of aspects, one might wish for a unifying definition of Ockham's own essential philosophical-psychological nature. The present study is not intended to provide such a definition. Its aim, rather, is to present Ockham as a sort of intellectual revolving door between positions, disciplines, and philosophical concerns which are now largely separated, or as a craggy mountain standing between secular or "modern" thought and vast but nebulous ranges of ideas looming in the distance beyond. An affinity for such ideas is not, to be sure, exclusively medieval, yet Ockham's peculiar position as a de fender of traditional spiritual truths and values (or so he insisted) who at the same time inaugurated an eminently influential via moderna in philosophy and theology suggests that we may find vantage points in his work for insights not easily available elsewhere.x Whether we in 1 The coincidence of concern and opposition of standard philosophical assumptions as between medieval and current approaches to the human Review of Metaphysics 33 (June 1981): 706?28.

The most important source for Ockham's view of human nature, as well as his epistemology and metaphysics, is his massive commen tary on the four books of Sentences of the twelfth century theologian, Peter Lombard. The first book of the Sentences consists of 48 "dis tinctions" (that is, assorted texts and arguments) on topics con cerning God. Our own text is Ockham's treatment of the first of these 48 distinctions, which is about use and enjoyment. The tradi tional idea here is that God is the uniquely final and satisfying object of all right and reasonable activities and that everything else should be regarded as not absolutely final?in some sense, everything else is only to be used, and in some sense only God is to be enjoyed. Ock ham works out his version of this position in six substantial questions on Distinction 1, the first about use, the other five about enjoyment. Space does not permit unpacking all of this dense material, but what is presented here is meant as an account of a line of argument central to the entire distinction and not as the extraction of a philosophical psychological nugget accidentally embedded in an alien theological soul, spirit, psyche, or condition suggest that focusing on this part of Ock ham's thought may contribute significantly to the perennial controversy over his traditionalism or modernity.

It seems strange that Ockham's sustained discussions of topics con cerning human nature have not received much attention, especially given Gilson's diagnosis of Ockham as the first known case of "psychologism," an intellectual disease which consists of demanding that psychology answer philosophical questions (The Unity of Philosophical Experience, pp. 86 90). 0. Fuchs, The Psychology of Habit According to William Ockham (St. Bonaventure, N.Y.: The Franciscan Institute, 1952) is one of the few stud ies in the area. Leff treats cognition in detail in his recent large study but says very little about other topics in the general field of philosophical psy chology or anthropology.</page><page sequence="3">708 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE mass.2 In terms of the summary theses formulated above, the argu ment runs as follows. Ockham begins developing thesis (1), that en joying is a certain kind of loving, by making some distinctions about volition, for it will turn out that enjoying love is a kind of volition. He then defends a broadly volitional approach to enjoyment against the Thomistic counter-claim that enjoyment is essentially cognitive. Pleasure comes into the argument as a proposed specification of the volitional view presented by a contemporary of Ockham's, who held that enjoyment is indeed love, but that pleasure is the kind of love enjoyment is. Thesis (2) summarizes Ockham's rejection of this pro posal: enjoyment is not the same thing as pleasure; it is a psychologi cal act naturally found to exist with pleasure, but it is "really" distinct from pleasure and is in fact a cause of pleasure. In the course of re jecting the hedonistic account of enjoyment, Ockham completes the sis (1) by specifying the kind of loving he thinks enjoying is: an active valuing or cherishing of something for its own sake above all else. If this is what enjoying is, one is naturally led to ask about its objects. The points to be considered on this matter can be thought of either as further clarification and development of (1) and (2) or as yielding a third thesis: (3) there may be "due" objects or ultimate states of en joyment which are satiating or satisfactory.3 2 On the importance of Sentence commentaries and other scholastic theological texts as sources for the history of science, see John E. Murdoch, "From Social into Intellectual Factors: An Aspect of the Unitary Character of Late Medieval Learning," in J. E. Murdoch and E. Sylla, eds., The Cul tural Context of Medieval Learning (Dordrecht-Holland: D. Reidel, 1975), pp. 271-348. 3 Ockham's six questions on Distinction 1 are as follows (Guillelmi de Ockham Scriptum in Librum Primum Sententiarum Ordinatio, Prologus et Distinctio Prima, ed. Gedeon Gal, O. F. M. with the assistance of Ste phen Brown; St. Bonaventure, N.Y.: The Franciscan Institute, 1967 (Opera Theologica, Vol. 1, in the Franciscan Institute edition of Ockham's Opera Philosophica et Theologica); all parenthetical page references in the pres ent article are to this edition; translations are my own). 1. Whether every thing other than God is only to be used (pp. 371 -93). 2. Whether to enjoy is an act solely of will (pp. 394-403). 3. Whether enjoyment is a quality really distinct from pleasure (pp. 403-28). 4. Whether God alone is a due object of enjoyment (pp. 429-47). 5. Whether the will can enjoy anything which is really God while not having enjoyment with respect to something [else] which is really God, that is: whether it can enjoy the [divine] essence while not enjoying the [divine] wisdom or will or person[s], or enjoy one person while not enjoying another (pp. 448-85). 6. Whether the will enjoys the ultimate end freely and contingently (pp. 486-507).</page><page sequence="4">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT 709 I Ockham's position on the whole matter of use and enjoyment (fruitio) grows out of a distinction he makes in the first question of Distinction 1 between what he calls non-referring and referring voli tions. "Someone can take something ("assume" it) into the faculty of will," he says, "either on account of itself or on account of something else . . . [The former] act is non-referring, when, namely, the will elicits an act concerning a thing in such a way that it would elicit the same act even given that nothing else were shown to it" (p. 374). As an example of such non-referring assumption of something into the will, Ockham supposes that God is shown to a person and that the person then desires (app?tit?a broader concept than desire) God, nothing else having been shown to him. On the other hand, in a re ferring act of will "something is taken into the will, another thing having been presented, so that if that other thing were not pre sented, or were not taken into the faculty of will, [the first thing] would not be taken into the faculty of will." An example of this would be when someone wills to take a bitter potion, which he would not do if he did not desire health. The person does will to take the bitter potion, not, however, on account of itself but on account of something else, namely, health. If he did not have health in mind, if, indeed, he did not positively will it, he would not elicit a positive act of will with respect to the potion. This willing one thing because one wills another is "using," as Ockham sees it, and much of question 1 is concerned with the psychological structure and conditions of voli tional acts of using. Ockham's notion of enjoying emerges in a fur ther distinction he makes with respect to non-referring volitions. An object can be non-referringly assumed by the will, he asserts, as the highest or supreme (summum) object that could possibly be pre sented to it to be willed, or it can simply be assumed, neither as high est nor as not highest. The first sort of non-referring volition is the central concern of this paper, for this is what Ockham takes enjoying to be, in the proper sense of the term: a non-referring volition in which the will accepts something as the highest or best thing that can possibly be presented to it to be willed. It will be convenient to call this a strongly non-referring volition to distinguish it from the other sort of non-referring volition Ockham recognizes, the 'absolute' kind, in which we will something as an end in itself or for its own sake but do not will it either as being or as not being the highest possible end.</page><page sequence="5">710 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE Ockham is at some pains to legitimate this idea of an absolute or, as we might say, weak non-referring volition, i.e., to show that such vo lition is possible and is not necessarily morally defective, but he does not recognize it as properly speaking enjoying; he calls it a middle act of will, something between using and enjoying. It will be conve nient, however, to call such weak non-referring volitions weak enjoy ings. In these terms, then, someone enjoys, or strongly enjoys, something when he wills it for itself as the highest object that can possibly be presented to be willed, and a person weakly enjoys some thing when he simply wills it for itself, without making any volitional claim, so to speak, that it is or is not the highest willable object that can be presented. The rest of Distinction 1 is a development and de fense of these claims. The preceding distinctions about volition raise many questions. What is it to will an object? We speak more often of wanting to have an object, or willing to perform an action, or desiring that some state of affairs should exist. Or again, if willing can be construed as relat ing to simple objects (we do speak of willing an end or the means to an end; we say that we will the greatest good of the greatest number, or that we love a person or thing?and loving seems to be at least in part a kind of willing), what objects can be objects of volition? Or further, what does it mean to say that something is "presented" to "the will," and what sort of thing does Ockham take an act of will to be? It will be well to bear such questions in mind, but there is no need to answer them to make some headway with our main topic, and perhaps they can be answered better later. In question 2 of Distinction 1, Ockham defends his volitional view of enjoyment against the contrary view?maintained most eminently by Thomas Aquinas?that enjoyment is, rather, a kind of cognition. With regard especially to the ultimate state of enjoyment called bless edness, St. Thomas argued, in effect, that the essential thing in en joyment, the enjoymgr which makes a state qualify as a state of enjoy ment, is the total fulfillment of our rational or intellectual nature in a direct contemplative awareness of God, the beatific vision. Ockham makes his contribution to the debate between Dominican intellectual ism and Franciscan voluntarism by arguing in response that volition is more fundamental to enjoyment than cognition (it is clear from ex perience that if someone understands something intensely but does not love it, he will not take pleasure in it [p. 395]) and that the sort of volition required is not dependent on the special cognitive state of the</page><page sequence="6">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT 711 beatific vision (the will can actively elicit an act of enjoyment con cerning an enjoyable object whether the object is shown to it by the understanding clearly or obscurely, particularly or universally [pp. 397-98]). We must avoid falling into a stereotyped view of this cona tive-cognitive opposition. While Ockham has some sharp words for St. Thomas at the end of the question, he does not present his own view in a fiercely partisan way. He agrees with St. Thomas, of course, that the blessed will see God "face to face," and it was com mon ground that volition is always of some object presented to the will by the understanding (intellectus) and that the understanding presents objects to the will with recommendations for willing?dic tates?which can be objectively correct (thus, Ockham later [p. 431] distinguishes between ordinate and inordinate enjoyment: the former is when we love supremely what is rationally to be loved supremely, the latter is when we take something else into the will as supreme). Furthermore, Ockham gives an indication here (p. 396) of a position (also anti-Thomistic, to be sure) he will develop in detail later in his Sentences commentary: such so-called faculties of the soul as will and understanding do not have any reality distinct from the substance of the soul itself?one and the same soul is "the understanding" in so far as it is capable of acts of understanding and "the will" in so far as it is capable of volition. Finally, while Ockham's contention in question 2 that enjoyment is essentially volition rather than cognition does fall into the standard pattern of debate on such issues between the two orders of friars, the need for discrimination in using such terms as intellectualism and voluntarism is suggested by the equally sharp issues within a broadly voluntarist approach to enjoyment which arise in question 3. II If enjoyment is volition rather than cognition, what kind of voli tion is it? A classically obvious candidate here is pleasant volition. Pleasure seems to be willed for its own sake or to be involved when other things are willed for their own sake, and even if there should be non-referring volitions without pleasure, the pleasurable ones would seem to have the best claim to be reckoned enjoyments. This is ef fectively the position Ockham examines and rejects in question 3: "Whether enjoyment is a quality really distinct from pleasure."</page><page sequence="7">712 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE The identification of enjoyment with pleasure is part of a broader account of volition given by the contemporary continental theologian, Peter Aureole. Aureole, like Ockham a Franciscan, held (pp. 405 407) that there are four basic sorts of volition, two positive and two negative, two with respect to present or "had" objects, two with re spect to absent ones. We can set aside the negative volitions, or ha treds, of sadness (tristitia) and flight (fuga), in order to concentrate on Aureole's division of positive volition, or love (amor), and Ock ham's response to it. Aureole called love for an absent object longing or desire (desiderium) and love for something we have pleasure (de lectatio). If there were any other basic kind of love, he argued, it would be the love that incites desire, but this is just a special form of pleasurable love, for we desire things that we find pleasant. In argu ing for such conclusions and in supporting his four-fold division of vo lition by analogy with the dynamic principles involved in physical mo tion and animal conation. Aureole plainly sought to provide a theoretically complete account of basic human motivation. Some what in the manner of a learning theorist in modern psychology (al though without a literal reduction of primary drives to the physical level), he made pleasure the beginning as well as the end of all volition and behavior. Against this, Ockham identifies enjoyment, not with pleasure (delectatio), but with a sort of volition he calls dilectio, and it is dilec tio which serves as the first cause in his own account of human behav ior. Dilectio can be translated "love." It is derived from the verb diligo, St. Jerome's choice to translate the Greek ?yan?u) in, for ex ample, Mark 12:29-31 ("Thou shalt love the Lord thy God with all thy heart . . . and love thy neighbor as thyself."). The other general Latin term for love, amo, suggests movement towards union with the beloved, while diligo suggests a choosing out, an esteeming or prefer ring of one person or thing before others. Ockham's sense of the term can best be elicited from his arguments for the thesis that there can be love (amor or dilectio?he prefers dilectio for his own idea but does not draw a distinction) without delectatio. Ockham presents several cases in which, he contends, a person may love something without experiencing pleasure as either incite ment or completion of the process. One (p. 409) is that of a person so overcome by sadness that he is incapable of experiencing any plea sure at all. Aristotle assures us that this can happen, and Ockham supplies the example of a person who is so sad at the loss of some ma</page><page sequence="8">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT 713 terial possession that he is incapable of taking pleasure in scientific contemplation. It is clear that such a person could nevertheless still love to have such knowledge, for he could labor to acquire it. Here, then, is positive volition in the absence of pleasure. Another case is that of anger (p. 411). The angry person has a positive desire for re venge of some kind, but although he will certainly be pleased if he achieves his revenge, his desire for it is not incited by any existing pleasure. If we stipulate that he believes revenge to be impossible, the argument is stronger, for he will still desire it, and yet there will be no pleasure either present or in prospect. Besides these plausible if not completely convincing cases from ordinary life, Ockham pre sents cases for which the data come from religious sources. When the devil tempts a man, he wants him to sin (otherwise he would not tempt him), and yet if the man does sin the devil will get no pleasure from it (p. 408). More generally, after the last judgment the damned will have many acts of will?they will love themselves intensely, de sire beatitude, and so on?but they will have no pleasure in them selves or in anything else (pp. 408, 411). So again, there can be love without pleasure. (Conversely, there can be negative volitions with out sadness. The blessed, for example [p. 409], want some things not to be which still are and other things to be which are not yet, but they have no sadness?one imagines a guardian angel not wanting a man to sin but not being depressed when he does.) At one point (pp. 407 408), Ockham seems to say that he is arguing de possibili on this mat ter, that he is trying to show only that it is possible for there to be love without pleasure, and hence that it is possible that love is really distinguished from pleasure, and that this is all that is required to re fute Aureole. Perhaps, then, the preceding cases should be inter preted as thought experiments and judged accordingly. But even admitting that cases of anhedonic non-referring volition are psycholo gically conceivable, one may still wonder why they should be called cases of enjoyment. A partial explanation for Ockham's identification of enjoyment with dilectio even in the absence of delectatio lies in the historical cir cumstance that the Latin term for enjoyment, "fruitio," connotes a flourishing or fulfillment of a thing's nature. On what could be called the high medieval and classical view of human nature and dignity, such flourishing is located primarily in the operation of man's highest and noblest powers. Accordingly, Ockham devotes part of question 3 (pp. 425-27) to showing that dilectio is "nobler" than delectatio, and</page><page sequence="9">714 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE this, he would think, would support the right of dilectio to the name of enjoyment. Ockham's frequent use of the Greek and medieval idea of an ontological hierarchy of nobility deserves attention. Further support for the identification of enjoyment with dilectio in the present passage can be found in a distinction which Ockham has been taking for granted throughout the whole discussion of enjoy ment (it was familiar, and he had put it forward in his own terms in his discussion of praxis in the long and important prologue to his Sen tences commentary). The distinction, as Ockham puts it, is between two senses of end: in one sense, an end is what we aim at achieving in or through an action; in another sense, the person or thing for whose sake an action is done is an end.4 Now our volitional attitudes towards these two sorts of end are quite different. We "love" the one with a "concupiscent" love. I take this to mean that what we can achieve or possess by our actions is in some way within our grasp. A certain eager avidity is in order, and some kind of contact with the object is anticipated. The other sort of end, the end for whose bene fit we stir ourselves to action, is loved, so to speak, as a friend. Only "so to speak," for a person can be an end in this sense even for himself and so love himself with a "love of friendship," and rationality (recta ratio) can also be directly willed for its own sake, according to Ock ham.5 It is only fairly late (p. 441) that Ockham argues explicitly that enjoyment is principally a matter of loving God with a love of friend ship, but he clearly assumes it from the beginning (cf. pp. 393 and 426), and this does much to flesh out the notion of non-referring voli tion and make it a more attractive candidate for the title of enjoy ment. The idea, now, is that the positive willing of a thing for its own sake in a strongly non-referring volition is to be understood as the 4 P. 306. Cf. St. Thomas, Summa Theologiae, la2ae, q. 26, a. 4 (amor and dilectio in a. 3). Ockham seems to have had in mind Aristotle, Meta physics 12. 7. 1072bl-3. 5 P. 306. Part of an objection to loving God as one's ultimate end which Ockham briefly notices in question 4 is the claim, drawn from Aris totle, that each individual ought to love himself more than anything else (pp. 430, 447). Ockham discusses recta ratio as something to be willed for its own sake in a monumental question "On the Connection of the Virtues" tra ditionally published both as part of his Sentences commentary and as a quod libet. The rich material on moral psychology in this and related texts (dis cussed in my The Political Thought of William of Ockham, pp. 189-96, 203-204) is largely organized around distinctions among different levels of virtue in which particular rationally desirable goods, rationality itself, and God function as final volitional objects.</page><page sequence="10">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT 715 sort of high positive regard, valuing, or cherishing, that is at least in some cases the basis for friendship. Accordingly, we say that we enjoy our friends, and in the same spirit we say that we delight in them. It would be a mistaken anthropomorphism to suggest that just anything appealing we can find to say about friendship may be used to interpret Ockham's concept of enjoyment. I would urge, however, that such terms as cherishing, delighting in, and positively regarding may legitimately be used in connection with Ockhamistic dilectio and that when such terms are kept in mind, the idea that an active valuing of a thing for its own sake is at least one kind of enjoy ment becomes more acceptable. At any rate, this is the kind of loving Ockham thinks enjoying is. Whether or not we are inclined to call such dilectio enjoyment, we may still find the preceding line of argument interesting, for, like Aureole, Ockham, too, has obviously been intent on working out a general account of human motivation, and to this end his attempt to establish a love distinct from pleasure as a volitional first cause is sig nificant even if love without pleasure does not fully satisfy our own sense of what enjoyment is. It is in this context of a broader theory of motivation that we must take note of his next contention (pp. 413 22): that love causes pleasure. This is the coup de gr?ce in his opposi tion to Aureolean hedonism, for if Ockham is right, the attempt to ex plain positive volition by reference to pleasure has things backwards: at least for pleasure connected with the will (let us call this psychic pleasure), a person must non-referringly will something before he ex periences pleasure and not as an effect of pleasure or even for the sake of the pleasure connected with his volition. Ockham takes it for granted in this part of question 3 that positive volition is a necessary condition for the kind of pleasure he is here concerned with. The the sis he argues for, against Scotus (and hence very technically), is that positive volition?and not the object willed?is in the natural order a sufficient condition for pleasure. If nothing impedes the process, pleasure is a causally necessary consequence of positive volition (pp. 420, 422, 415).6 6 As an account of pleasure in general, the denial of a causal role to objects is, of course, quite implausible. It is reassuring, therefore, to find (p. 421) that this account is intended to hold only for pleasure "in the will"? what might today be called psychic pleasure?and that Ockham proposes a very different causal structure to account for pleasure "in sensitive appe tite"?physical pleasure, as we would say. Here, he thinks, volition is not</page><page sequence="11">716 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE III In question 4, Ockham asks, "whether God alone is a due object of enjoyment." He treats this question as being about the possibility or nature of an object of volition which wTould "satiate" or "ultimately quiet" the will. We commonly speak of the things we enjoy?the "objects" of our enjoyings?as more or less enjoyable. Especially if we identify enjoyment with pleasure, we are apt to think of an object as causing our enjoyment of it. The most enjoyable objects, then, would be the ones which cause the greatest enjoyment or pleasure. In these terms, Ockham's fourth question seems perfectly natural and straightforward, albeit his affirmative answer to it may not. In terms of his own position, however, the question itself is perplexing, for the ethical tenor of much that he has said in the earlier questions (his distinction between rationally ordinate and inordinate enjoyment and his identification of enjoyment with an active "love of friendship") would lead us to expect a moral rather than a psychological treatment of "due" or proper objects of enjoyment in the present question, while essentially involved. What does cause physical pleasure? Not physical ob jects, Ockham argues elsewhere (Book 3, question 14 of his Sentences com mentary; cf. ibid., Book 3, question 11, and question 17 of his third set of quodlibetal questions (Guillelmi de Ockham Quodlibeta Septem (Opera Theologica 9), ed. Joseph C. Wey, C. S. B. [St. Bonaventure University: St. Bonaventure, N.Y., 1980], pp. 268-72). Even physical pleasure is psycho logical, after all. Although (as he contends elsewhere) the physical does act directly and immediately on the psychological at some point, the immediate cause in the production of pleasure is not the object but the cognition of the object. An unsensed object does not cause physical pleasure, whereas if the sensation could be conserved in the absence of the object (as by God's power it could be), the pleasure would be exactly the same. This is the sort of distinction someone interested in thinking clearly about psychological pro cesses might want to make. The subtlety of Ockham's treatment of plea sure is further indicated by his account of the pleasures of imagination. Holding as he did that sensation is required to produce physical pleasure, Ockham saw clearly that the pleasure felt at the thought of a physically de sirable but absent object could not be attributed to the object. He argued, accordingly, that pleasure arises here from the will's positive attitude towards the present thought of the absent object. He uses the example of a man who desires to commit fornication with a woman and derives pleasure from the thought of doing so. The pleasure here cannot be derived from the act of fornication, which is not actually had. Pleasure in this case comes rather from the will's present acquiescence to the thought of intercourse or, Ockham seems to suggest, it can arise immediately from inner sense or fan tasy based on present desire or sensitive apprehension (sight of the desired woman, for example).</page><page sequence="12">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT 717 the rejection of hedonism in question 3 would suggest that such psy chology as Ockham might think relevant here would not be a psychol ogy of maximizing satisfaction or contentment; and besides, his denial of a causal role to the object of volition in the production of psychic pleasure makes it unclear how an object could be psychologically sat isfying even if we wanted it to be. There is no general explanation in Distinction 1 (or anywhere else in Ockham?) either of the relation be tween satiation of a psychological capacity and the properties intrin sic to an appropriate range of objects or of the relation between satia tion and pleasure. Something like the following, however, could have been in his mind. Consider first a cognitive capacity, say a capacity for solving logic problems. It seems reasonable to think that some problems would satiate such a capacity (exercise it, challenge it, use it to the full) more than others, and it would probably be easy to determine some properties of good problems which would make them satiating. Now on Ockham's view a person would not automatically derive any psychic pleasure from having or using such a problem-solving skill. For psychic pleasure he would need to want to use the ability, he would need to use it willingly and more or less non-referringly. If a person did want to use such a capacity, however, we might expect, other things being equal, that he would derive more pleasure from applying it to a more satiating than to a less satiating object. But now we must note that the will itself is a psychological capacity and one which, according to medieval assumptions has a range of objects which can in principle be ranked, like lesser and greater logic prob lems, according to their lesser or greater adequacy or satiation value, in this case their lesser or greater objective goodness, as dictated by rational reflection. Here, too, however, even though it is not as easy to see as in the cognitive case, there is a distinction to be drawn be tween satiation and pleasure. A person cannot derive satisfaction from any volitional object except in so far as, and in the way that, he actually wills it, so no matter how good an object is in the abstract? no matter how satiating it is or would be in principle, if the will were applied to it?it has no effect in the will except through being taken up or assumed by the will. But the actual willing of one object differs from the willing of another (Ockham expresses this by saying that cognition of the object, along with the will, is a partial cause of the volition [p. 421]), and so, if a person does will some object, the charac ter of the object (as it is taken into the will, not as something contem</page><page sequence="13">718 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE plated from a distance) will affect the resulting pleasure, and, other things being equal, the willing of an objectively satiating object would lead to more contentment and subjective satisfaction than the willing of a relatively unsatiating object. This is to say, then, that Ockham's discussion of due objects of enjoyment in terms of their satiation or quieting of the will should not be seen as a retreat into hedonism, for on the preceding account the enjoying precedes the pleasure, and what we enjoy is always an object which we claim to be worthy of pos itive regard for its own sake. The pleasure derived from enjoyment can only come, then, as a result that is, in a sense, necessarily unin tended, albeit easy to anticipate and not to be avoided.7 Whether or not the above would meet with Ockham's full ap proval, it will serve to set the stage for his discussion of due objects of enjoyment, for the idea of psychological capacities and objectively 7 If the interpretation offered here of what Ockham means by calling the object of a volition a partial cause of it is correct, his position on the cau sality of psychic pleasure is not as far from Scotus's as it may seem. The difference is that whereas Scotus thinks of the object and the volition (pre sumably the volition of just that object) as cooperating to produce pleasure, Ockham thinks of the object as making its contribution entirely through the volition. On either view, the pleasures consequent on volition will vary with characteristics of the objects willed. In any case, it is important to see that for Ockham, although pleasure is produced by the will, it is not pro duced at will, as a willed object, which pops into existence merely from being willed. Rather, pleasure "in" the will is a natural-causal consequence ?a law-like effect?of willing an object. The different accounts Ockham gives of psychic pleasure and physical pleasure (preceding note) yield an in teresting position on the perennial paradox of hedonism. The paradox is that a person seeking pleasure generally gets less of it than someone who takes an interest in something else. For Ockham the paradox does not hold for physical pleasures. A person might very well choose one food or bever age over another because it tasted better, and the fact that his will for a pleasant taste was the controlling volition in his choice would not of itself keep him from obtaining the pleasure he sought, for such pleasures, accord ing to Ockham, are immediately caused by the sensations we have of physi cal objects. To an extent, then, the intention with which we subject our selves to sensations is irrelevant to the pleasure derived from them. The paradox of hedonism does hold for Ockham, however, with respect to psy chic pleasure, what we might now speak of as the pleasure of enjoyment, for the pleasure involved in enjoyment is not itself the object of enjoyment but the effect of the volitional act of enjoying some object, which act counts as an enjoying of the object because in the act the object is loved for itself. A person could, of course, make his own pleasure the object of his strongest non-referring volitions, but there is little reason to think that this would be a very satisfactory object or that Ockhamistically enjoying it would yield much pleasure. It certainly wouldn't yield pleasure simply because we wanted it to.</page><page sequence="14">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT 719 adequate satiating objects I have tried to set forth as possibly part of Ockham's position is certainly part of the high medieval philosophical position on this matter which he argues against in much of question 4 (on my view, of course, this is not the part of the position to which he objects). The position is that one can establish philosophically that God and only God is a proper object of human enjoyment. Ockham accepts the conclusion on faith but denies that it can be shown by phi losophy. The immediate opponent here is Duns Scotus, but St. Thomas and, if I am not mistaken, most scholastics prior to Ockham would side with Scotus on this issue. Scotus's argument has several inter esting variations; the main theme is as follows (pp. 432-33). If we have perfect and distinct knowledge of some power or capacity, we have all that it takes to specify a due satiating object for it. Now human nature can be regarded as a power or capacity, and we know it perfectly and distinctly, and so we can know what its ultimate satis fying object must be. In particular, from reflection on our natural activities and interests as rational beings, we can see that we have an orientation towards the whole of being, that in some sense we have a capacity for relationship with infinite being and goodness, that nothing short of this will satisfy all that is in us, that, in short, God is the sole due object of human enjoyment. Ockham examines this line of argument carefully but finds it un convincing. Certain as he is on religious grounds that God in fact is accessible to the human will and that He is a suitably satiating object for it, he shows no inclination to assume that there must be convinc ing philosophical arguments for these truths. He argues, in effect, that we cannot tell from our knowledge of existing human nature, however perfect that knowledge may be (setting aside revelation), what human nature is capable of by way of a real upper limit for its cognitive and volitional objects, and even if we recognize in ourselves some sort of abstract general orientation towards the whole of being, it does not follow from this either that we are capable of the kind of volitional focus on God in particular?God as God?that is needed to motivate a specifically religious philosophy of human fulfillment or that we would be unsatisfied by a life dedicated to more limited goods (satiation may even occur from love of less perfect goods than the best concretely available to us) (pp. 436-39, 433-36). At the other extreme, our non-religious knowledge of human nature does not as sure us that any object, even God, would be fully satisfying, for it</page><page sequence="15">720 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE might be that, having God, we could long for other objects and be sad if we lacked them (pp. 435-36). For anyone interested in fourteenth century philosophical and scientific thought about human nature, these arguments are fascinat ing for what we might call their factual (as against rational or specula tive) approach to the questions at hand. Ockham's human nature is not something studied by the methods of experimental science (at least it is not so studied by him), but neither does it display itself?to put the alternative somewhat tendentiously?as the ideal completion of a logical abstraction. Through Scotus, Ockham is well acquainted with the notion of a virtually unlimited Cartesian will, and in his Franciscan way he frequently appeals to the spontaneity of the will to upset an overly smooth account of other areas of human functioning (for example, the notion that understanding the good entails enjoying it). But he does not take the abstract concept of an unlimited will as necessarily descriptive of the real (effective, concrete) capacities of any actual human will. He does not draw the connection, but the im possibility of apprehending God as a possible love-object without faith would seem to limit a person relying solely on natural reason to what we have called weak enjoyings (the "absolute" non-referring volitions of question 1), in which objects are loved for their own sake, but not as the highest goods that could possibly be presented to the will. Presumably such a person would simply not know whether the high est good he was aware of (perhaps peace with justice in a contempla tively oriented human society) was the unqualifiedly highest good that could be presented. There would be nothing inordinate about a life dedicated to such a lesser end, however, so long as the dedication did not involve the mistaken volitional claim that the end in question was the highest one possible. Indeed, there is reason to think that Ockham regarded behavior based on weak enjoyings as making up a large part of any reasonable life. In any case, these two parts of Dis tinction 1 have an undeniable, if implicit, theoretical bearing on one another. In principle, one could envision a human world in which men might wonder about ultimate origins and destiny but have no basis in fact or theory for taking any positive position on such ques tions (for Ockham, the actual world minus revelation would, I think, be such a world).8 The inhabitants of such a world would no doubt 8 This is at least suggested by his way of demarcating temporal from spiritual matters in his political writings (discussed in my The Political Thought of William of Ockham, pp. 200-202 and n.15).</page><page sequence="16">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT 721 suffer from their ignorance in the abstract, and they might be prey to stories of false gods (although they would be philosophically mistaken to worship such), but in this ignorance they would simply not know how well or badly off they were sub specie aeternitatis, and since they would not lack for finite goods to pursue, one could not be sure how unsatisfied they would feel. In present fact, Ockham believed, God is accessible. He is a su premely and satiatingly "due" object of enjoyment, the sole proper object of the strong non-referring positive regard which is the act of enjoying. The remainder of Distinction 1 is entirely predicated on this possibility of loving God above all things and for His own sake (as He deserves to be loved). Although this possibility cannot be grasped by philosophy, the discussion nevertheless has points of phil osophical interest, which should be taken into account in any formula tion of Ockham's views on objects of enjoyment. Ockham believed there could be an ultimate state of enjoyment, blessedness. Those who are in this state are directly aware of God. They "see" Him intuitively, in Ockham's terminology, instead of knowing Him only indirectly or abstractively. In the last half of question 4, Ockham considers the view, actually held by a rather orig inal Dominican thinker, Durandus of St. Pour?ain, that this vision of God, not God Himself, is, strictly speaking, the object of enjoyment (what we enjoy, what is enjoyable). God is involved in the total situ ation, of course, for He is the object of the cognitive act of beatific seeing, but according to Durandus it is this act of seeing which we immediately enjoy. Ockham has distinguished earlier (p. 428) be tween the sense in which the act of enjoyment quiets the will (as the ultimate thing which can be chosen for its own sake and not on ac count of another thing) and the sense in which pleasure quiets the will (as something after which there is nothing else quieting). Bearing this distinction in mind as we turn to his discussion of the proper ob ject of enjoyment, we can read him as arguing in effect (pp. 441-45) that although the ultimate state of blessedness includes the pleasure consequent on both seeing and loving God, God and God alone is the element in the final state of affairs deserving to be loved above all else for its own sake, and since enjoying is precisely such an act of loving, God and God alone must be the object of enjoyment. A conse quence of this (prepared for at pp. 396-97) is that God can be Ockha mistically enjoyed, at least broadly speaking, even in the absence of the beatific vision. He can be enjoyed, for example, even in the pres ent life (fruitio viae), for He can be taken into the will as an ultimate</page><page sequence="17">722 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE end in this life. (If this seems odd, consider the following. We say both that we enjoy our friends and that we enjoy being with our friends. Ockham would hold that the former enjoyment is more basic).9 In the fifth question of Distinction 1, Ockham asks whether the will can enjoy the divine essence without enjoying the persons, or enjoy one person without enjoying another. The persons here are the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit of the Christian Trinity, but at least one issue of general philosophical import is involved: must someone's conception of an object correspond with the object's own nature for it to be said that he is enjoying that object? Ockham's position here is consonant with his earlier insistence against Durandus that the blessed enjoy God, not their vision of God. This also applies, as we have seen, to the wayfarer of this world. Although the wayfarer knows God in or through concepts, abstractively, while the blessed know God in Himself, intuitively, it is in fact the same God who is known in both conditions. It is also the same God who is enjoyed or unqualifiedly loved. So if God is in truth and necessarily three per sons in one essence (as Ockham believes the blessed can see), then what someone who enjoys God enjoys, whether he be wayfarer or blessed, is three persons in one essence (pp. 455-66). The striking implications of this position are clear from the example Ockham con siders of a non-believer who loves God above all things for His own sake but thinks the doctrine of the Trinity is false. Does not such a non-believer love God without loving the persons? No, says Ockham (pp. 467-68), he does not know that he loves the persons, he may be lieve that he does not love the persons or even that he hates the per sons, but he is mistaken in these beliefs about what he loves. Ock ham's long and complicated defense of this idea that what one ultimately loves is a person or thing in him-, her-, or itself, and not a 9 On being with a friend as the fulfillment of friendship, see Aristotle, Nicomachean Ethics 9. 12. Although, as nearly as one can judge, a desire to be with God might be for Ockham a natural consequence of enjoying Him, other things being equal, the imaginary case of a person whose love for God leads him to willingly do without the beatific vision if it is God's will that he not have it (pp. 442-43) shows that Ockham regards the two volitions as distinct. The beatific vision is loved with a love of concupiscence. This would count as an inordinate "using" of God if the beatus did not also love God Himself for His own sake with a love of friendship not causally depen dent on that vision (p. 393).</page><page sequence="18">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT 723 person or thing "as known" or "under a description," as the philoso phers say, deserves more attention. In the sixth and last question, Ockham asks whether the will enjoys its ultimate end freely and contingently.- He means by free dom here (p. 501) a certain indifference or contingency in a power's being able to cause or not cause a specific effect without any change being posited either in itself or in the surrounding circumstances. The power concerned is, of course, the will, and the effect that inter ests Ockham is the will's act of enjoying God in the state of blessed ness. Against the Thomistic view that the will naturally and neces sarily desires its ultimate end and acts contingently only in choosing means, Ockham champions the Franciscan idea of will as spontaneous and "non-natural" through and through, acting contingently in all that it does, even in willing or rejecting its own blessedness (pp. 503 507, with some doubt, however, about the possibility of rejecting God Himself if He is seen clearly and the will is left to its own nature). As Ockham well knew, however, this raises a difficulty. If the beatified will acts freely and contingently in loving God, could it not, then, cease from that act or even elicit a contrary act of hating God, thus falling from beatitude to damnation? Ockham had brought up this unacceptable possibility in question 2 to argue for the opinion that the beatific act of enjoying is not "from the will actively" (pp. 398-400). He will later argue that God will make beatitude permanent by Him self causing the volitions by which the blessed love Him, as well as the corresponding contrary volitions in the damned?our basic voli tions are caused in this life by ourselves and in the afterlife by God.10 The problem of freedom in blessedness is indeed the last problem treated in his Sentences commentary. The enjoyment of God thus oc cupied Ockham as both a first and a last thing. Gilson's diagnosis of Ockham as the first known case of "psychol ogism" (note 1 above) formed part of a more general diagnosis of in cipient skepticism. Some of the issues involved in such an evaluation come to a head in the latter part of Distinction 1. We will perhaps be better able to appreciate these issues if we formulate a summary Ock hamist thesis on objects of enjoyment: there may be due objects or ultimate states of enjoyment which are satiating or satisfactory. We 10 He offers this as a possible account of the confirmation of the wills of the blessed and the obstination of the damned. Question 19 of Book 2 of his Sentences commentary.</page><page sequence="19">724 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE should think of the "may" here as having three senses. First, I have argued that for Ockham there logically may be due objects or ulti mate states of enjoyment, that the concept of a satiating or quieting volitional object or state is a concept Ockham is entitled to use, a con cept consistent with his rejection of hedonism and his ascription of motivational primacy to non-referring volition. Second, there is a "may" or "maybe" of philosophical uncertainty concerning the real, as opposed to the abstract logical, situation. In the abstract, it sounds plausible to say that a person should love above all and for its own sake (that is, enjoy) the greatest good he can think of, but, contrary to most of his medieval predecessors, Ockham did not find anything in the ordinarily observable constitution of human nature to dictate what, if anything, the greatest or most satisfying good really present able to the human will is. Third is a "may" of real personal possibil ity, for Ockham held that in fact the human will is capable of loving God above all else and for His own sake and that God does in fact sati ate the will which so enjoys Him. Much needs saying about these various "may's" and "maybe's," and especially about the relations be tween the second and third of them. It may seem that Ockham's phi losophy makes God harder to reach than He was for earlier thinkers. Revealed religion no longer presents itself as a solution to problems of which we were already vividly aware or as the completion of a driving metaphysical or cosmic quest that we were already necessarily em barked on as men following natural reason. Does it follow that nomi nalism entails a philosophical mind-set hostile to religion?11 However we answer here, we must note that Ockham's theology makes God in some ways more accessible than we might imagine, for his thesis that God, not our idea of Him, is the object of ordinate enjoyment makes the prince of nominalists a realist?a direct realist?in the modern 11 It should not be assumed that a failure of philosophy to attain posi tive conclusions about God and human destiny is cause for theological re gret. It was a medieval commonplace (reflected, perhaps, in Kant's an nounced intention of limiting reason to make room for faith) that faith is meritorious only when it is free and voluntary, not a rational necessity com pelled by evidence. It has also been argued (by E. A. Moody in "Empir icism and Metaphysics in Medieval Philosophy," Philosophical Review 67 (1958): 145-63) that the critical, anti-metaphysical bent of Ockhamist philos ophy was religiously defensible as a response to the theologically unaccept able results of Arab Aristotelianism. Finally, the inability of philosophy to provide foundations for religion (even a total inability, which Ockham would not have granted) need not diminish its usefulness for understanding reli gion on its own grounds.</page><page sequence="20">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT 725 sense of the term, in which realism is opposed to idealism, and his thesis that God can be loved even when He is very poorly known also seems to move in the direction of broader human access to whatever it is that religion is really about. IV If this sketch of Ockham at work on a specific problem in philo sophical psychology has shown that his thought in this area deserves study, it will have served its purpose (better, perhaps, than a more circumspect historically annotated analysis of a smaller piece of ma terial or a broader theme would have done). A distinctive picture of human motivation, one clearly oriented towards the traditional notion of God as the soul's supreme good but without a philosophically visi ble relationship to God built into the soul as a datum for the secular study of human nature; an intense interest in having a clear descrip tive and causal account of what our mental processes are actually like; a rich but disciplined array of conceptual resources?these are per haps the main things we have observed, but each of these aspects of Ockham's treatment of enjoyment calls for a closer look. If strong non-referring volition is the psychological first cause of specifically human behavior, then both volition in general and especially the voli tion of ends need attention, as well as the way in which volition func tions to produce behavior in a creature also motivated by the desires and pleasures of "sensitive appetite." (How, for example, are we to distinguish these conative levels and their corresponding plea sures?) Volition is of objects presented or shown to the will by the intellect, and shown to it, as we have noted, with dictates for willing, which dictates may themselves become volitional objects. What ex actly is the inner structure of such showing and willing, and what is the relation of this whole psychological process to extra-psychic real ity? Are suitable ends ("final causes," in medieval Aristotelian ter minology) in some way pre-existent realities outside the mind? If not, then what sort of mental act or event warrants an end as objec tively good or bad? More generally, how are we to understand na ture and freedom in Ockham's view of man? He affirms the sponta neity of will in distinguishing certain psychological processes from other, "natural" ones and from all physically caused events, and yet he thinks of some volitions as caused by others ("using" volitions by</page><page sequence="21">726 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE enjoying ones) and envisions an ultimate state of affairs in which even our most fundamental volitions will in a sense be necessitated by God. Throughout his discussion of volition, furthermore, the tone is scientifically objective. Is this an ominous anticipation of the para mechanical treatment of mind Ryle found in Descartes, or a com mendable attempt at realism in describing a human freedom which even modern man can neither account for nor do without? Enjoying is not only a first cause of behavior. Properly valuing or cherishing someone or something as an end in itself is also an ultimate psycholog ical achievement, the noblest act of which human nature is capable. As I have interpreted Ockham, ordinate enjoyment establishes a real relationship with something outside oneself?it is not a psychic game of the metaphysically "absolute" or "isolated" textbook Ockhamist in dividual. While Ockham seems to have regarded the beatific experi ence and enjoyment of God as being beyond the reach of natural rea son even as a possibility, he had much to say in a realistic philosophical vein about cognition, behavior, and character formation (but little directly about interpersonal relations) in this-worldly con texts. His espousal of direct realism against Durandus of St. Pour?ain's proposal of the beatific vision as the proper object of enjoy ment is a theological harbinger of typical Ockhamist philosophical po sitions in the analysis of perception, imagination, memory, concept formation, judgment, and reasoning. In discussing all of these pro cesses, Ockham's aim is to establish as direct a relationship as possi ble between the mind and the ordinary objects and qualities of the real world. The resulting psychology is by no means a simple one, since the elimination of essences and relational categories as real world entities over and above individual things and qualities requires Ockham to posit a host of reflective and elaborative mental operations to explain our dealings with the world nominalistically. His account of behavior and character formation in terms of highly specific acts and habits posits a similarly highly complex psychological apparatus. If we are to get to the bottom of Ockham as a serious student of human nature, his treatment of the preceding questions about psy chological processes needs to be moored?ontologically and methodo logically. What are intellect and will (and memory)? If these powers of the rational soul are not really distinct from the substance of the soul itself, then what is that? Is it "substantially distinct" from the sensitive soul, so that one has separate subjects of psychological acts and qualities in a single person? And what is the relation of psy</page><page sequence="22">OCKHAM ON ENJOYMENT 727 chological subject(s) to physical subject? Such ontological questions about soul and body make evident the need for methodological moor ing, if indeed it was not already apparent. How can one know about such things? How are we to determine what our psychological pro cesses are like and what their causes are? Today a philosopher may be advised to leave these questions to the psychologist. What is to count as a reliable and enlightening method in psychology will be whatever working psychologists find reliable and enlightening, and there is no necessity that this follow a pattern laid down by philoso phy. Unfortunately, such advice makes sense only if there are al ready psychologists present. It is only a slight over-dramatization to say, however, that with Ockham we witness the invention of substan tially the very field we now recognize as psychology. Should we therefore try to find appropriate methodological moorings by observ ing Ockham himself at work? No doubt, but in trying to discover the conception of psychological method implicit in his practice as a work ing philosopher or scientist of human nature, we would be foolish to ignore his own exhaustive explicit formulations concerning evidence, analysis, and proof. The skeptical overall view of Ockham as a thinker who somehow made it impossible to prove any of the things about God, man, and nature which previous generations had demon strated with ease can itself be proved or disproved only if we specify appropriately what proof and disproof are. Our preliminary sam pling shows Ockham exercising considerable ingenuity in establishing some psychological conclusions and invalidating others. Neverthe less, at some important points (the existence of a due object of enjoy ment, for example) his position is that, philosophically and scientifi cally speaking, we simply do not (cannot?) know. Finally, with regard not only to method, but also with regard to the other questions raised in the last few pages, we must keep in mind the problem of situating Ockham in relation to his predecessors and successors The fashion in philosophy since Descartes has been to write as if one had no predecessors. (The fashion reaches full self consciousness and self-annulment in the explicit attempt to overcome or deconstruct the tradition.) The opposite medieval fashion was to write as if one had nothing new to say oneself. Here as elsewhere, Ockham is a border figure. As we have seen, he showed little hesita tion about criticizing other Franciscans and none at all about attack ing such a thinker as St. Thomas, and yet, especially vis ? vis Scotus, Ockham's critical onslaught purports to be based on principles com</page><page sequence="23">728 ARTHUR STEPHEN McGRADE mon to him and his opponents rather than on any novel insight into their fundamental misguidedness. Hence, while the alarm provoked in some historians by Ockham's most striking nominalist theses should not be ignored (as can happen when the true conviction that Ockham was a good scholastic is taken to entail that he could not have had any radical philosophical differences with other good scholastics), the growing consensus that he was a culminating rather than a de structive thinker must be accepted and extended: it is a sign of the richness precisely of Ockham's medievalism that he can be studied as a source for both phenomenology and empiricism in psychology, for both natural science and a theology of faith. More or less directly, then, Ockham's discussion of enjoyment prompts all the major questions a general study of Ockham on human nature must seek to answer. It seems clear that Ockham did not use his razor as a device for making self-knowledge triflingly and falsely straightforward. His elimination of unnecessary entities was calcu lated to allow a clearer, finer view of such true realities as may be available to us. And while Ockham was the most powerful four teenth century thinker, as far as one can judge, he was by no means the only one who discussed such matters as have been considered here with technical precision and philosophic intensity. The Carte sian revolution, whatever else may be said of it, was not an advance from rusticity to nuance in its view of man. Study of Ockham and his century may show that in this area, at least, it was not simply a move ment from darkness to enlightenment either. University of Connecticut, Storrs.</page></plain_text>
