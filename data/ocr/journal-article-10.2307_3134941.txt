<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE BWILI OR 'FLYING TRICKSTERS' OF MALAKULA: A CRITICAL DISCUSSION OF RECENT DEBATES ON ROCK ART, ETHNOGRAPHY AND SHAMANISMS ROBERT J. WALLIS University of Southampton The use of 'shamanism' and/or neuropsychology in the interpretation of rock art imagery has been much contested, with opinions often polarized between so-called 'shamaniacs' and 'shamanophobes' who support or oppose these lines of enquiry, respectively. Ethnographic analyses have, arguably, suffered most in this controversy. In this article I explore Layard's ethnography of the bwili or 'flying tricksters' of Malakula, Melanesia, to interpret rock art in the northwest of the island - in the same region and, apparently, of the same era as Layard's bwili. In contrast to uncritical shamaniac interpretations and their misleading equa- tion of'entoptics = shamanism', and as a challenge to the criticisms of shamanophobes, I theorize the term 'shamanisms', scrutinize Layard's ethnography, and critically apply Lewis- Williams and Dowson's (1988) neuropsychological model to interpret the rock art of north- west Malakula. The article therefore seeks to reinstate these approaches - ethnography and neuropsychology - as complementary elements in the interpretation of rock art. Introduction 'Shamanism' has been at the centre of interpretative rock art research for well over a decade. A debate rages between so-called 'shamaniacs', primarily Dowson (e.g. 1998a),Whitley (e.g. 1992), and Lewis-Williams (e.g. 1998), and 'shamanophobes', most vocally represented by Bahn (e.g. 1997; 1998), with comments from Quinlan (1998), Solomon (e.g. 2000), and Kehoe (2000). This controversy began with Lewis-Williams's (e.g. 1975; 1981) proposal of connections between Southern African rock art, nineteenth-century ethno- graphic records of the San (Bushmen), and twentieth-century anthropologi- cal research on Bushman healing practices in the Kalahari. Researchers world-wide applauded Lewis-Williams's research (e.g. Bahn 1988) and many of them looked optimistically towards the potential of ethnographic analogy for expanding the interpretations of other rock art traditions (e.g. Conkey 1987). In 1988 two papers were published (Davenport &amp; Jochim 1988; Lewis-Williams &amp; Dowson 1988), the former rather less famous, now, than the latter. Davenport and Jochim's suggestion (following others, e.g. Kirchner 1952; Lommel 1967) that the 'wounded man' in the Lascaux shaft-scene might be an Upper Palaeolithic shaman had no great or long-lasting impression on ?

WALLIS rock art research, despite its innovative approach to apparent avian character- istics shared by both human and bird-topped staff. In notable contrast, Lewis- Williams and Dowson's proposal of the controversial 'neuropsychological model' and its application to cave art imagery of the European Upper Palaeolithic had an immense impact. Rock art researchers thenceforth split into two camps, shamaniacs and shamanophobes. The neuropsychological model has since been applied to a vast corpus of imagery as diverse as northwest European passage tomb art (e.g. Dronfield 1996), Californian rock art (Patterson 1998), Australian rock art (Sales 1992), and even British Iron Age coinage (Creighton 2000). The situation is certainly troubling: in far too many instances the neuropsychological model is applied uncritically in a search for 'entoptics' (as set out by Dowson 1999), the geometric visual phenomena endogenous to trance and characteristic of'stage one' in Lewis-Williams and Dowson's neuropsychological model.' The mis- taken equation was entoptics = shamanism.Yet some of these authors not only ignored trance stages two and three, and the principles of transformation steer- ing the perception of imagery (Lewis-Williams &amp; Dowson 1993), but also ignored the heterogeneity of rock art and shamanisms in what has aptly been termed 'a steamroller approach' (Garlake 1995). Critics of the shamanistic approach were only too happy to point out such flaws, as well as inaccurate readings of ethnographic sources: Sales's (1992) lack of direct ethnographic evidence for 'Pilbara shamanism' and homogenizing notion of 'Pan-Australian shamanism', for example, is open to criticism (Chippindale, Smith and Tacon's [2000] application of Elkin's [1997] 'clever men' ethnography to 'dynamic figures' of Western Arnhem Land is more rig- orous and convincing). The use of San ethnography to interpret rock art has been challenged on similar grounds. Both the idea of a 'Pan-San' world-view and the application of the Bleek and Lloyd /Xam ethnographies to paintings from KwaZulu-Natal, southern Africa, have been criticized: the one for being generalist; the latter seen as an inappropriate ethnographic analogy. Critics also argue that the /Xam ethnography is more concerned with mythology and gender relations than with shamanistic themes (a debate which continues between Solomon [e.g. 2000] - proponent of the latter - and Lewis-Williams [e.g. 1998]). Ethnographic analyses (e.g. Sales 1992) of rock art have arguably been the greatest victims of shamanophobia. This article therefore has two aims: first, to demonstrate the strength of ethnography in providing insights into the shamanistic nature of certain rock art traditions, with specific discussion of the rock art in northwest Malakula (see Map), Melanesia, in the context of J.W. Layard's early twentieth-century ethnography of the bwili, or 'flying trick- sters', of the same region; and, secondly, to demonstrate the value of both ethnography and neuropsychology as complementary and mutually support- ing approaches by critically applying the neuropsychological model. A criti- cal application requires dismissing the overtly simplistic entoptics = shamanism equation and utilizing the model in its entirety: identification of endogenous visual phenomena, principles of transformation of visual imagery, and specific cultural contexts of iconic images. The article draws on preliminary fieldwork conducted by the Vanuatu Cultural and Historic Sites Survey (hereafter VCHSS) (Roe 1991) to investigate possible connections between the ethnog- 736</page><page sequence="3">ROBERT J.

It serves as an initial exploration of this much- neglected data and seeks to reinstate the potential of ethnographic analysis (where available), complemented by neuropsychological data (e.g. Dowson 1989), at the forefront of shamanistic interpretations in rock art research. Archaeology and anthropology in Vanuatu Malakula is the second-largest island of the Vanuatu archipelago, situated approximately half-way between the Solomon Islands and Fiji. The landscape 737</page><page sequence="4">ROBERT J. WALLIS consists of a rugged jungle interior surrounded by uplifted coral terraces. Archaeological research in Vanuatu has focused mainly on the southern islands of Erromango and Aneityum, with Spriggs (1997b) also examining the north- ern island of Maewo. Following Leaney's (1965) preliminary archaeological survey of Malakula, investigations were conducted by the VCHSS (Roe 1991) which recorded rock art at three sites discussed in this article. Recent excavations (Bedford, Spriggs, Wilson &amp; Regenvanu 1998) have established a basic cultural sequence for most islands of Vanuatu and parallel sequences of environmental change based on pollen cores.Vanuatu was colo- nized around three thousand years ago by settlers who brought dentate- stamped Lapita ceramics. The earliest settlers of Malakula inhabited sheltered bays with reliable water sources, making permanent settlements inland at a later point. In northwest Malakula, the location of rock art discussed here, there is a concentration of cave sites with evidence for intensive ceramic production (for a detailed summary of archaeological research in Vanuatu, see Bedford, Spriggs, Wilson &amp; Regenvanu 1998). Earliest ethnographic documentation of Vanuatu is by Codrington (1891) and Speiser (1990), with reports from specific islands thereafter (e.g. Lane [1965] for Pentecost and Bonnemaison [1994] for Tanna), particularly regard- ing 'cargo cults' (e.g. Worsley 1957), and detailed records for Malakula are provided by Deacon (e.g. 1934b) and Layard (e.g. 1942). Despite the major contributions from Melanesia to anthropological theorizing (e.g. A. Strathern 1971; M. Strathern 1999), there has been less input from Vanuatu, and even less from Malakula: examples include discussion of the politics of rank and gender Jolly 1991) and textiles as 'captivating' agents (Bolton 2001), in north- ernVanuatu, and analysis of animist-Christian syncretism in southern Malakula (Curtis 1999). Rock art research in Western Oceania Western Oceanic rock art and its social context have been consistently neglected, but a number of scholars have explored areas which increase our understanding of the art: Gorecki and Jones (1987) report indigenous beliefs concerning the art and the potential of blood in rock-painting pigments for its dating. Roe (1992) demonstrates connections between the art, other artistic media, and the spread of Austronesian-speaking peoples; Ballard (1992a) documents locational evidence in western Melanesia for a rock art tradition based on Austronesian language groups and suggests (1992b) similarities with Australian cave art; Wilson (1998) conducts a multivariate exploration of similarity/closeness and difference/distance in Pacific rock art and argues for a Southeast Asian common ancestor; Bedford, Spriggs, Wilson, and Regenvanu (1998) propose a preliminary temporal sequence for Vanuatu's rock art; and most recently, Wilson, Spriggs, and Lawson (2001) have obtained AMS radio- carbon dates for rock art of the European contact period from Hopnarop in northwest Malakula. For the most part, however, published works have provided descriptive documentation (e.g. Ballard 1988; Frimigacci &amp; Monnin 1980; Franklin 1996; Specht 1979; Spriggs &amp; Mumford 1992): documentation and the analysis of formal properties is a vital first step in rock art research, 738</page><page sequence="5">ROBERT J. WALLIS but it is only the first step and does not take place in a theoretical vacuum (e.g. Lewis-Williams 1990). The widespread misconception that recording is 'objective' and should be our primary concern is to the detriment of inter- pretation which is no less 'subjective': ample documentation has been com- pleted in certain areas for interpretation to begin. Yet, interpretative research is notably sparse. Wilson (1999) proposes links between Erromango's black linear rock art in caves and gendered imagery on other media, and between the production of rock art and use of the caves by women during periods of warfare. Thus far these interpretations suggest that Wilson's rock art recording and analysis project should produce further fasci- nating results in the near future, but such interpretative research is the excep- tion to the rule. Gunn (1986) is instead content with an outmoded diffusionist perspective; Ewins (1995) presents an exhaustive discussion of rock art from Vatulele (Fiji), only to produce generalized conclusions based on broad defi- nitions of Austronesian/non-Austronesian stylistic conventions and circum- stantial chronological evidence; and while other research has been repetitive (e.g. Rosenfeld 1988), Specht (1979) proposes that meaning in the art is inaccessible without contemporary ethnography. Landscape archaeology (e.g. Bradley 1997; Nash 2000) and folklore (e.g. Alves 2001) mark two avenues of enquiry which have proved beneficial where ethnographic records are unavail- able in European rock art research, but, nevertheless, Specht's point can now be addressed: in this article the ethnography from Malakula provides the access he demands. I demonstrate how this primary ethnographic evidence for a form of shamanism in Malakula, alongside neuropsychological analysis of the imagery, lends substantial support to the shamanistic approach. This article thus challenges the current interpretative malaise in much Oceanic rock art research and, perhaps more significantly, challenges the shamanophobia in certain quarters of rock art research world-wide. 'Shamanism' of the bwili The anthropologist J.W. Layard is 'a forgotten figure in anthropology ... the last of the diffusionists of the psychological persuasion' (Gell 1998: 87). Prior to researching Malakulan sand-drawings (e.g. Layard 1936), Layard became intrigued by reports of the sorcerors known as bwili. Layard did not meet a bwili but, according to his informants, these 'flying tricksters' were believed to exist until at least the early 1930s in northwest Malakula (Layard 1930a: 504).2 Their existence appears to be unknown currently, but 'magicians' called 'kleva' men (Bislama-language term from the English 'clever') perform throughout Vanuatu. Layard's ethnographic records are replete with accounts of the bwili's spirit-world exploits, from practical jokes (such as pretending to be the husband of an unsuspecting woman) to accounts of transformation into snakes, fowl, and plants, ritual dismemberment, and the killing of enemies. Layard describes the bwili as 'sorcerers' and suggests that the various beliefs surrounding them are connected to 'shamanism' and the ideology of death (Layard 1930b; see also Codrington's discussions of magic [1891: 191-217], possession by ghosts [1891: 209, 218-27], and the tavogivogi 'changeling' spirits [1891: 172] which are directly comparable with the bwili). 739</page><page sequence="6">ROBERT J. WALLIS As noted by Herdt (1977), there has been limited research on shamanisms in Melanesia.3 Layard's identification of the bwili as shamans, in the early 1930s, is strik- ing: not only had the term 'shaman' yet to gain currency outside Siberia, but his detailed discussion also anticipates more recent theorizations of the term in place of the off-the-cuff remarks found elsewhere. If Layard were to suggest that the bwili were shamans today, however, he would probably meet consid- erable shamanophobic opposition. Since Layard's day, Eliade (1964) popular- ized the term 'shamanism' as an 'archaic technique of ecstasy' for which he has been widely - and justifiably - criticized (Humphrey 1994: 191; 1996: 47-64; also Smith 1987). Eliade set the trend for homogenizing a plethora of highly diverse practices (e.g. Drury 1989; Harner 1980), and decades of research have yet to yield an agreed theoretical and practical definition (e.g. Harvey forthcoming). The issue stems, largely, from the Western invention of the term in the seventeenth century and the manner of its application ever since.'Shamans' were first encountered in Siberia by Russian explorers but these samna:i/saman (the written form is phonetic since the Evenk had no written language) had various social locations and practices; they were not all the same, even here (see also Price 2001). A pristine or original 'shamanism' never existed, however much Eliade and followers wanted to find one: the 'Siberian cradle' or locus classicus of shamanisms is more a Western construct than an Evenk reality. Anthropologists consistently struggle to represent the cultural specificity - using local terms, such as 'Kam' (Korea),'Baksy' (Central Asia), 'Angakkoq' (Greenland), 'Curandero' (Peru) - while at the same time recognizing cross-cultural similarities. Few can avoid reference to shamanisms altogether (e.g. Atkinson 1989), and others reluctantly utilize this occidental fabrication for comparative purposes (e.g.Vitebsky 1993). The crux of the problem, and I am by no means alone in recognizing the difficulty, is that the term 'shamanisim' aptly fits certain ritual specialists but at the same time neglects the variety of specific social contexts. Some an- thropologists may suggest that we abandon the term altogether and employ indigenous terminology instead but we would still need a term, be it 'ritual specialist', 'medicine man', 'sorcerer', and so on, that would translate the local usages into English for comparative purposes, and 'shamanism' is the term we have - it has currency. Rock art research has a similarly problematic relationship with shamanisms, particularly a search for check-list features. Lewis-Williams's (1998) ten characteristics of shamanism, for example, mark an attempt to pin shamanisms down; but if ten, why not twenty - where do we draw the line? We require a theorizing of'shamanism' (or, more correctly, shamanisms) in archaeology - an archaeology of shamanisms - which acknowledges cross-cultural similarity, but also embraces diversity. Dowson (1999) argues that definitions belie such requirements and that a conceptual shift is required in which we approach 'elements of shamanism' and explore the diversity of themi in specific coimmunities, rather than 'define' or catego- rize 'shamans'. These elements are as follows: agents consistently (a) alter con- sciousness,4 (b) these altered states are accepted as ritual practices by the agent's community, and (c) knowledge concerning altered consciousness is controlled in effecting certain socially sanctioned practices (after Dowson 1999). This approach acknowledges global consistencies but, following recent interpreta- 740</page><page sequence="7">ROBERT J. WALLIS tive trends away from generalities and towards localized socio-political con- texts of shamans in shamanisms (e.g. Humphrey 1994; 1996; Thomas 1994) and rock art (e.g. Dowson 1998b) studies, it explicitly requires examination of the specificity and diversity of shamanisms and rock art. The efficacy of this approach can be demonstrated with regard to the northwest Malakulan bwili. In an initiation ceremony (Layard 1930a: 507-9) the boy to be initiated approaches a bwili, who is a relation. The initiation procedure, which may last several days, involves the boy eating a 'pudding' containing the red leaves of a roware bwili plant.While the initiate lies on roware bwili leaves, the bwili is said to amputate the initiate's limbs and his head, and both 'laugh' at each stage of dismemberment. The body parts are replaced, and the initiate is covered completely by the leaves. The bwili transforms into a fowl by chanting a magic word, and lands on the initiate three times. The boy remains motionless in the first instance, shakes violently in the second, and stands up in the third. When the bwili returns in human form and the boy stands, both again 'laugh'. The boy is now a fully fledged bwili and both bwili proceed to trick the boy's mother by transforming themselves into pigs and fowl. Aspects of the account which attest to its shamanistic character include: length of initiation, dismemberment, chanting of a word of power, metamor- phosis into non-human beings and flying, ritual combat and death, shaking violently, and the role of a specific plant. In the following discussion of these 'elements of bwili shamanism', I focus on the enigmatic plant species and argue that this may provide access to the socio-political idiosyncrasy of Malakulan shamanism, specifically its context in beliefs surrounding the dead. 'ELEMENTS' OF BWILI SHAMANISM: AGENTS ALTER CONSCIOUSNESS There are specific features in the initiation tale which indicate that the bwili alters consciousness. At the outset, Layard (1930a: 509) suggests that the ini- tiation period may last several days; further specific details are lacking in the account, but intensive initiations can induce sensory deprivation and altered consciousness, as for example in the 'vision quests' of many Native American communities (Lyon 1996), the sacred Huichol journey to Wirikuta (Fikes 1993), and the San trance dance (Katz, Biesele &amp; St Denis 1997).The ensuing trance, for the bwili, involves violent trembling. Sensory deprivation is also evident in initiation ceremonies into men's secret societies in the region, which can last many days (Codrington 1891; Deacon 1934b; Layard 1928). Added to this evidence of inducing altered consciousness, the possible use of an entheogen5 by the bwili gives further weight to my argument that they can be usefully approached as shamans. In Layard's account of initiation, the boy lies on, and is later wrapped up in, the leaves of the roware bwili plant. Layard provides no other information on this species of plant, and I have not encountered ethnobotanical or botanical literature referring to it. It is probably of some significance, however. Not only do shamanic and other initiatory ordeals in Melanesia (e.g. Herdt 1977: 156- 7, 161-2, 164) often involve direct contact with specific leaves (though not to my knowledge the roware bwili), specifically to attract spirit-helpers (or'famil- iars'), as might be apparent in Layard's description of the bwili's initiation, but 741</page><page sequence="8">ROBERT J. WALLIS also, after ingesting a brew containing roware bwili and being wrapped in the leaves - and only while wrapped - the candidate shakes violently, which might indicate the plant itself promotes this reaction and/or trance. South American shamans, in particular, ingest entheogenic plants to induce trance (e.g. Taussig 1987), but there is also evidence for such use of leaves in shamanic rituals else- where in Melanesia (Herdt 1977: 157).Although botanical identification of the Malakulan roware bwili is elusive, it may be entheogenic, and the most likely candidate is 'kava' (Piper methysticum forst), prepared as a ritual and social drink in Malakula,Vanuatu, and a large part of the Pacific, and used as a means of interceding with the supernatural world and contacting the dead (e.g. Brunton 1989; Lebot, Merlin &amp; Lindstrom 1992; Pollock 1995). Ingesting large quan- tities of kava leads to 'intoxication' and 'trance' (Lebot &amp; Cabalion 1988: 11- 23), andThomas comments on kava use in 'religious ecstasy' in parts of Melanesia (Thomas 1989). Specific to Malakula, kava was used in men's degree-taking rites (Deacon 1934b), so a connection with Layard's description of the bwili's trance" is not illogical. Indeed, if moderate quantities of kava may cause 'slight nervous trembling' (Lebot &amp; Cabalion 1988: 11), it is conceivable that more substantial amounts caused the bwili's violent trembling. Entheogen ingestion is only one way in which shamans induce altered con- sciousness, and other aspects of the initiation tale hint at these. During the ritual, the initiate is dismembered by the bwili. Such descriptions of shamanic initiatory dismemberment are widespread, as described, for example, by the Sakha (Yakut) shaman Sofron Zateyev (Eliade 1964: 36), the Greenlandic Angakkoq (Jakobsen 1999), and the Iban of Borneo (Roth 1968: 281). In this Malakulan instance, dismemberment is indicative of shamanic experience and may describe the painful transition into trance, and/or the transition from neophyte to initiated shaman, stripping away the life previous to initiation. As the story unfolds, the bwili says a word of power. The word is unspec- ified, but its status as a word of power, and the fact that it is chanted, seems significant. Shamans consistently have chants, songs, and specific words which facilitate the onset of trance, and invoke spirit-helpers. These chants are an integral part of shamanic rites, for instance, for the Malay bomoh (Laderman 1991), the kuran of the eastern Indian Sora (Vitebsky 1993), and the Korean kam (Kendall 1985). For the buili, chanting allows him to engage with a spirit world in which transformation into a fowl and flying are possible. Such meta- morphosis and flight accord with various shamans' descriptions of spirit- helpers who facilitate travel to the spirit world, such as among Scandinavian Sami (Backman 1987), Amazonian Shuar (Harner 1984 [1972]), and Daur Mongolian (Humphrey 1996) shamans. The metaphor of flight is particularly noteworthy, since subjects of Western neuropsychological experiments also describe trance in terms of weightlessness and flight (Siegel 1977). 'ELEMENTS' OF BWILI SHAMANISM: THESE ALTERED STATES ARE ACCEPTED AS RITUAL PRACTICES BY THE AGENT'S COMMUNITY There are a number of ethnographic accounts in which the bwili is said to shape-shift into someone's husband or wife so that he may seduce and then kill the victim of his trickery (Layard 1930a: 509-10). The bwili is also able to 742</page><page sequence="9">ROBERT J. WALLIS kill enemies by transforming himself into fruit or a snake (Layard 1930a: 513; see also Codrington's discussion [1891: 207-8] of metamorphosis, and the mae snake, a familiar which is very similar to the bwili [1891: 188]). These instances of shape-shifting and flight illustrate another widespread aspect of shamanisms - combat with enemies and killing them (e.g. Harner 1984); both of these practices of 'sorcery' are an integral part of social life. At first glance these activities may not appear the most likely candidates for an 'accepted' ritual practice. However, such practices are consistent in shamanisms and, while 'the dark side of the shaman' (Brown 1989) has often been neglected, the 'sorcery', 'trickery', and other malevolent aspects of the bwili are, I argue, vital for socially constituting bwili shamanism (a point also made by Herdt [1977: 155, 161] for Sambian shamans). Since the 1960s, Western entheogen use has been widely stigmatized as criminal and/or aberrant, with the effect of distorting or over-simplifying understandings of shamanisms. In response, researchers repeatedly assert that shamans are not drug abusers, nor are their supernatural activities 'evil'. Most recently, the spread of neo-Shamanist practices has given rise to romanticized representations of the shaman as an idealized healer and New Age spiritual guide, thus sanitizing the more complex realities of shamanic practices in non- Western contexts (Wallis 1999). There are, however, numerous ethnographic accounts of socially embedded ritual practices in which shamans are seen to suffer, injure, and kill, as well as heal. This 'dark side' (Brown 1989) is promi- nent for example, among the Greenlandic Angakkoq (Jakobsen 1999) and Amazonian Shuar (Harner 1984), and I argue that it must be reinstated - where applicable - if we are to not homogenize shamanisms. The example of the bwili, with his coveting of neighbours' wives, ritual combat with enemies, killing via supernatural means, and general trickery or sorcery, is a case in point. It is here, in the practice of sorcery, that I locate acceptance of the bwili's use of altered consciousness by his community. While Godelier (1986: 113 ff.) also discusses the overlap of shamanisms and sorcery in Melanesia with the case of the Baruya, it is noteworthy that the bwili's trickery, specifically adultery, is similar to Herdt's (1977: 158) shaman-informant Baindo whose familiar is a 'lecherous fornicator as Baindo would like to be'. 'ELEMENTS' OF BWILI SHAMANISM: KNOWLEDGE CONCERNING ALTERED CONSCIOUSNESS IS CONTROLLED IN EFFECTING CERTAIN SOCIALLY SANCTIONED PRACTICES In order to do full justice to the distinctiveness of bwili shamanism, and thus to avoid reifying a metanarrative of'shamanism', it is crucial to locate the practices in specific socio-political contexts. In this regard we have much evidence of a shamanism which is peculiar to the region, and I locate these practices within the distinctiveness of Malakulan kinship ties and beliefs sur- rounding the dead.The neophyte in Layard's description is initiated by a family member and, accordingly, ritual knowledge is restricted by lineage in Melane- sia, especially in men's secret societies. Furthermore, shamanisms are heredi- tary in parts of Oceania (e.g. Thomas 1989: 56) and kava use in Vanuatu was limited to initiated men until recent times. So the bwili-lineage probably exer- 743</page><page sequence="10">ROBERT J. WALLIS cised a similar control over their means of trance induction - possibly an entheogen. Bwili initiation is unlike other initiation ceremonies in Melanesian religion, however (e.g. Codrington 1891: 69-100; Deacon 1934b: 231-70; Layard 1928), since the candidate is not initiated into a secret society, but into the practice of'sorcery' or 'trickery'. A further socio-political idiosyncrasy of bwili shamanism is marked by its connections to beliefs surrounding the dead. In Melanesia there is intimate contact between the living of the 'ordinary' world and dead ancestors of the 'supernatural' world (Western terms which do little justice to the complexi- ties of Melanesian world-views). People believe that their soul will only enter the afterworld if strict rituals, taboos, and sacrifices are observed and main- tained (Layard 1934: 118), which continually presences the supernatural in the mundane world. By way of example, a Malakulan island of the dead lies just off the coast, ancestor rituals allow communication with the dead throughout Melanesia, ghosts of the dead frequently manifest themselves among the living (Deacon 1934b: 550-77), the landscape is filled with paths of the dead and places of the spirits, and in everyday activities certain paths and places of spirits are fervently avoided (Roe, Regenvanu, Wadra &amp; Avaho 1994). These instances, alongside the drinking of kava to contact the supernatural world, exemplify how social relations with the dead are, I argue, intrinsic to bwili shamanism. Characteristic of the bwili is his mediation between the super- natural and mundane worlds by transforming into spirit-helpers (Layard 1930b: 531), thus sharing the ability to transform with ancestor spirits (Layard 1930b: 536). The bwili's close contact with the realm of the dead suggests that some of these helpers or 'familiars' were once those of the ancestors who are so prominent in Melanesian cosmology. Layard points out (Layard 1930b: 532) that Siberian and other shamans have shaman-ancestors as spirit-helpers (e.g. Shirokogoroff 1935; Thomas 1989). Application of this notion to the bwili might appear anachronistic; it would be more accurate, given that the closest ethnographic evidence is within Melanesia itself (e.g. Herdt 1977: 154-5), to propose that the bwili's inheritance of shamanic abilities is via the inheritance (and/or possession) of the deceased parent's familiars, rather than the spirit of the parent himself. Furthermore, Layard suggests that the violent trances of the bwili appeared to observers as a death and rebirth, identifying the bwili with spirits of the dead. This was potentially a useful political tool for the bwili, conferring on him the power of ghosts and elevating him to the ranks of the 'living dead' (Layard 1930b: 526, 533, 548). Such experiences of death and resurrection were utilized in the Maki degree-taking rite in Malakula, which was based on mortuary rituals in which men took their place 'among the hierarchy of the living dead' (Layard 1934: 116); and, in Guadalcanal (Solomon Islands), by 'Moro' who augmented a politically powerful 'cultural revival movement' (Davenport &amp; C(oker 1967). The former example illustrates the intimate asso- ciations between death, the dead, mortuary rites, and rites of passage among the living; the latter illustrates the political potency of institutionalized altered states, and how the bwili may have implemented and negotiated trance prac- tices in day-to-day socio-political relations.

Strathern 1994), and particularly gift-exchange, fractal personhood, gendered rank, and graded systems (Godelier &amp; Strathern 1991; Jolly 1991; Lutkehaus &amp; Roscoe 1995; M. Strathern 1999). Having argued that the bwili can be appropriately approached as shamans, and having examined aspects of their social contexts, the remainder of this article seeks to demonstrate connections between bwili shamanism and Malakulan rock art. Malakulan rock art Malakulan rock art (Map; Figs. 1-9) is characterized by geometrics (Figs. 3-4), anthropomorphic figures (Figs. 5-8), birds, fish (Fig. 9), and dogs. The imagery from three cave sites in Malakula were first reported and described by Leaney (1965). The VCHSS (Roe 1991) survey of Malakula produced further details of sites 3.22 Navap Ousei, 3.24 Tenmial ('Yalu A' in Leaney's survey), and 3.6 Abeialau ('Yalu B' in Leaney's survey), and, according to a later paper, five sites were known in 1996 (Roe 1996). No doubt the Vanuatu Archaeology Project will add significantly to the Malakulan dataset. In this article, which offers a first step in interpretative analysis based on current data only, Roe's tracings from Tenmial and Abeialau (Navap Ousei's art has yet to be recorded) and his field notes (1991) on local beliefs surrounding the caves and their art, have been invaluable. Sketch-plans of Tenmial and Abeialau with approximate loca- tion of traced art are shown in Figures 1 and 2. It is noteworthy that the rock art and bwili are both recorded in northern Malakula, and the caves themselves were perhaps suitable locations for inducing altered consciousness via sensory deprivation: natural light would have been minimal and, despite their large size overall, alcoves and low passages restrict body movement. The Tenmial site figures strongly in local religious beliefs, and its rock art is explicitly associated with the dead. A 'path of the dead' also terminates there; the cave is referred to as a 'home of the dead', and a naturally formed 'trumpet' in the wall of the entrance is used to inform the spirits that people will enter. Spirits of the recently deceased manifest themselves as footprints in the ground of the southern chamber; perhaps engravings of footprints and painted hand stencils in other chambers were once conceived of in a similar way. It is per- tinent to note how the small size of this chamber and its virtual darkness could have been conducive to inducing visions. Abeialau, on the other hand, does not figure in contemporary beliefs, and the rock art is not attributed with any meaning, while Navap Ousei, like Tenmial, incorporates a 'road of the dead'. Clearly, the cave sites and their rock art are thoroughly embedded in Malakulan beliefs surrounding the dead. Contesting entoptics = shamanism The 'search for entoptics' has misappropriated Lewis-Williams and Dowson's model and misconstrued their intentions.

I attempt to avoid such metanarratives by discussing the imagery in relation to a specific ethnographic context, and by asserting (as Lewis-Williams &amp; Dowson 1993: 56 have done) that the neuropsychological model is not centred around endoge- nous forms: the identification of endogenous forms alone is insufficient for arguing that rock art is derived from altered consciousness. Trance stages two and three, as well as the seven principles of transformation, are integral parts of the neuropsychological model and should not be neglected. My exploration of the origins of Malakulan rock art depictions in neuropsychological experi- ences is not fundamental to my argument that the bwili were shamans. It does, however, provide additional supporting evidence for this contention, demon- strates connections between the art and altered consciousness, and, by impli- cation, suggests via the bridge of altered states/neuropsychology an intrinsic relationship between the art and the bwlili. In addition, it marks an instance of how the neuropsychological model, when critically applied, can identify con- 746</page><page sequence="13">ROBERT J.

In the first stage of trance, subjects experience endogenous forms; such images are ubiquitous in the Malakulan art. Most important is how these images are subjected to the transformational principles (often ignored in rock art literature, e.g. Dronfield 1996), and also how this is evident in the art. Figure 3 shows grids and lines which are subject to replication and fragmen- tation, and the endogenous filigree and broken zigzag in Figure 4 are inte- grated. In the second stage of trance, subjects try to make sense of such images, resulting in the construal of endogenous and iconic forms, the latter - impor- tantly - being culturally derived. Lewis-Williams and Dowson (1988) point our how the fluidity of stage two means that 'construals' are rarely depicted in static art forms. Accordingly, there are not such images currently recorded in Malakula, but Figure 5 shows how dots are construed to form the eyes of anthropomorphs in the third stage of trance. While endogenous forms and their transformation are recognizable in many rock art traditions, their manifestation in the Malakulan 'style' is markedly different, thereby challeng- ing the monolithic 'search for entoptics' and its neglect of diversity (follow- ing Dowson 1999). Further differences are evident in the Malakulan rock art which represents stage three, or the deepest level of trance in which subjects of Western neuropsychological experiments feel dissociated from their own bodies and their surroundings, and often become part of their imagery. Somatic experi- ences occur, with endogenous phenomena being intensified; shamans describe similar neuropsychologically derived sensations within their own culture- specific frameworks. Both shamans and Western subjects report, for example, 747</page><page sequence="14">ROBERT J. WALLIS FIGURE 3a,b. Site 3.24 Tenmial.

Rock art depictions which perhaps relate to this sort of experience are widespread (e.g. Lewis-Williams &amp; Dowson 1999: figs. 33a-c), and the heads in Figures 6-8 from Malakula have lines extending from the cranium, but the way in which these lines are portrayed is clearly very different from that in other rock art traditions. The amalgamation of anthropomorphic figures and endogenous forms in Figure 6 is particularly striking in this regard but is difficult to interpret: certainly themes of'everyday life' or 'hunting magic'- outdated functionalist explanations of rock art imagery - are inappropriate here.

The blurring and confusion of the five human senses, synaesthesia, is characteristic of trance, and is recorded in neuropsychological literature.

In the Malakulan art there are no recorded spirals, reflecting cultural choice over which imagery was depicted, but the experience of unity may be expressed in the imagery in Figure 6. I have mentioned in particular the line emanating from its head, but, in addition, the whole body is fragmented and severely contorted. Furthermore, subjects of neuropsychological and ethno- graphic reports consistently describe deep 'third stage' trances in terms of moving through tunnels, vortices, holes in the ground, and so on (e.g. Lewis-Williams &amp; Dowson 1988; Dronfield 1996), suggesting that the strong association between art, caves, and shamanism on Malakula was far from coincidental. It niay be particularly significant that in Figure 6 the hairs on the anthro- pomorph's head are markedly erect. Rayed-head figures are common in Melanesian rock art (e.g. Williams 1931: 145), and particularly prominent in Fiji (Ewins 1995), and the southeast Moluccas (Ballard 1988). Such imagery in southern Africa has been approached in relation to the experiences of San shamans and the subjects of neuropsychological experiments who describe somatic experiences involving the feeling of erect hairs (Lewis-Williams &amp; Dowson 1999: 50). The erect hair in Figure 7 indicates that at least one Malakulan shaman underwent similar somatic experiences which were, no doubt, interpreted in a very different, idiosyncratic way. In terms of idiosyncratic images, one of the most unusual of these from Malakula is represented in Figure 7: the skull/head is enlarged, the arm elon- gated, and the leg attached to the torso in an unnatural way. Digits of the hand and foot, and the genitals, are exaggerated, as if somatic sensations were concentrated there. The position of the arm - held in front of the torso, raised 750</page><page sequence="17">ROBERT J. WALLIS FIGURE 8. Site 3.6 Abeialau. Third stage of \ i X trance: four fragmented \ anthropomorphs (after Roe 1991) (interpreted more fully in the text). mr O cm and bent at the elbow, with the forearm upwards - is of interest, especially since there is at least one other image like it at Abeialau. Given that many shamans assume trance postures to induce altered consciousness, often nego- tiating with the spirits to facilitate this process, perhaps these anthropomorphs stand in a peculiarly Malakulan trance posture. The feature emanating from the head in Figure 7 might hint at the trance experiences of attenuation men- tioned above, but in this instance a more likely interpretation is that this is a feather. Feathers are common sacred objects worn by initiated men in Melanesia, but while more than one cassowary, parrot, or other unusually shaped feather may be worn by such initiates, for New Guinea Baruya shamans in particular, a single eagle feather is attached to the head of future shamans in the Koulakita ceremony and is thenceforth worn at the top of the head as a mark of their status and to repel evil spirits (e.g. Godelier 1986; see also Herdt 1977: 158 for the use of eagle feathers in Sambia shamanic rituals). Feather ornaments - plumes of cock and hen feathers in particular - are prominent in grade-taking and other initiation rites for Malakulan men (e.g. Deacon 1934b; Speiser 1990). It seems significant, therefore, not only that a similar feather ornament may be worn by the enigmatic anthropomorph in Figure 7 but also that the bwili is closely associated with fowl in Layard's descriptions. The anthropomorphs in Figure 8 are also enigmatic, with fragmented lines emanating from their heads, and limbs distinctly fragmented from their bodies. The head of the central figure is a considerable distance from its body and this figure is superimposed on an endogenous filigree. The left-hand figure, in contrast, has one arm missing, and one of the clearly visible hands of the figure on the right has no arm to join it to the torso. The producer of the image has decided to represent the lower half of the body as a line which becomes fragmented. Although it might be suggested these depictions are simply poor artistic attempts at portraiture, such an explanation better exem- plifies the inappropriateness of applying Western aesthetic values to the art of 751</page><page sequence="18">ROBERT J.

These fish and bird paintings may portray spirit-helpers and/or express trance experiences of being underwater, and weightlessness or flight (after Roe 1991). 0 10 1 . ' cm other cultures. I propose, rather, that shamans purposely depict themselves in such ways to portray trance experience, suggesting that this Malakulan example is indeed trance-derived; Figure 8 is particularly suggestive of intense shamanic experience. Perhaps whoever engraved the figure that is situated second from the left felt that their head was dissociated from their body during the peak of trance. Moreover, somatic sensations may have concentrated in their head, a common trance experience, overwhelming all sensations in the rest of their body (this may be one explanation for heads alone being depicted in Figure 5). Anthropomorphs predominate in Malakulan art, with fish and birds predominating in the recorded, identifiable examples of animals (Fig. 9). This seems significant given that some shamans (who may use such creatures as spirit-helpers) and subjects of neuropsychological experiments specifically use images of fish and birds, and concomitant experiences of being underwater and flight or weightlessness, to describe trance. The bird metaphor is immedi- ately reminiscent of the bwili's transformation into a fowl in Layard's descrip- tion, although the form of representation in Figure 8 is simply too fragmentary to decide whether or not the three-toed feet of the three anthropomorphs might hint at bird-like features. None the less, one particular creature in the Pacific Ocean, the turtle, is a likely candidate for shamanic spirit-helper and underwater metaphor for trance. Turtle motifs occur in rock art from Aneityum, Southern Vanuatu (Spriggs &amp; Mumford 1992) and New Caledonia (Frimigacci &amp; Monnin 1980), and while none are currently recorded for Malakula - though they are recorded in ground drawings - we might expect to find them in future investigations given their prevalence else- where. Taboos surround consumption of the turtle inVanuatu because of their associations with spirits (e.g. Speiser 1990: 142). The turtle then, may com- prise an underwater metaphor for trance and spirit-helpers idiosyncratic to some shamans in Vanuatu. Furthermore, beliefs surrounding the dead may enhance our understanding of the preponderance of anthropomorphs; their 752</page><page sequence="19">ROBERT J. WALLIS FIGURE 10. Ground drawing (after Deacon 1934a: fig. 73) found as a rock art motif in Aneityum, southern Vanuatu (Spriggs &amp; Mumford 1992: fig. 4). , location at 'homes of the dead' and 'paths of the dead', alongside my earlier suggestion that the bwili may have gained shamanic abilities via the inheri- tance (and/or possession) of a deceased parent's familiars, leads me to the ten- tative suggestion that it may be these familiars which are depicted in the imagery. Conclusions Further discoveries of rock art may provide additional support for these arguments, as well as greater correspondences between rock art and other artistic media (cf. Ballard 1992a; Roe 1996; Spriggs 1997a: 183;Wilson 1999). These media are entrained within Vanuatu beliefs surrounding the dead (Biihler 1946-9: fig. 4; Layard 1928: 212-13, pl. xviii; Leaney 1965: 14) and may contain endogenous imagery. Similarities across this material are striking: rock art from Feles Cave on Lelepa Island, Efate, central Vanuatu (Garanger 1972), for instance, is very similar to the Malakulan art. Ground drawings, too, may be of particular significance as motifs express beliefs regarding the dead (e.g. Deacon 1934a; Layard 1936; Fig. 10), and their production may be asso- ciated with altered consciousness (Crowe 1976). Moreover, both rock art and ground drawings contain similar endogenous-like motifs - with one design being identical (Figure 9; see Spriggs &amp; Mumford 1992) - as well as bird, fish, and turtle motifs. I suggest that these are all beings which relate to trance metaphors and spirit-helpers. In addition, kava bowls, the contents of which I have posited may be linked to the bwili's supernatural activities,8 are some- times elaborately carved with rock-art-like geometric designs. The relation- ships between and social effects of these artistic media - rock art, ground drawings, and decorated kava bowls - may profitably be studied according to Gell's (1992: 1998) anthropological theory of art as a 'technology of enchant- ment'. Other connections, between the bwili, rock art, and archaeological monuments, for example, may yet be elucidated; Layard's (1934: 116) discus- sion of'dolmens' and 'monoliths' in relation to the Maki ritual which confers on men the status of 'living dead' is particularly intriguing, not only in the context of Melanesian shamanisms, but also with possible implications for archaeological interpretation - for example, the production and consumption of megaliths elsewhere in the world, such as Neolithic Britain. The location of rock art in the Malakulan cave sites is also likely to prove significant. 753</page><page sequence="20">ROBERT J. WALLIS Concentrations of particular motifs and the differences between paintings and engravings, particularly their location at cave sites (also noted by Bedford, Spriggs, Wilson &amp; Regenvanu 1998: 185), requires detailed analysis. I conclude that the entoptic = shamanism equation has led to an avoidance of neuropsychology and a maligning of the shamanistic approach in rock art research. This has, in turn, promoted negative views of researchers utilizing ethnography in rock art interpretation. My discussion of Malakulan ethnog- raphy suggests that where available, ethnography has demonstrable potential in the search for meaning in rock art imagery. Critical application of the shamanistic approach and neuropsychological data add to the ethnographic resources to form strong 'relations of relevance' (Lewis-Williams 1991) which suggest that the bu,ili were central to the production and consumption of Malakula's rock art. Indeed, ethnography and rock art not only have shaman- istic connections which reinforce one another, but are also capable of stand- ing alone as evidence for the use of altered consciousness in the region. Further, it seems highly significant that the blwili of the early twentieth century are only documented in northern Malakula, in the same region as the recorded rock art, whilst AMS radiocarbon dates from the nearby cave of Hopnarop testify to a rock art tradition or traditions in the region at the time of (and after) Layard's records (Wilson, Spriggs &amp; Lawson 2001). This article's attempt to offer preliminary interpretations of Malakula's rock art thus offers a challenge to shamanophobic criticisms of the shamanistic approach and seeks to move beyond the monolithic search for entoptics by so-called shamaniacs. There is abundant evidence, in Vanuatu at least, to assert that the search for meaning in rock art is not a worthless exercise in interpretation, but can and should be attempted. NOTES This paper would not have been possible without the encouragement of David Roe and his kind pernmission to use field notes and tracings. I am indebted to both David Roe and espe- cially Thomas Dowson for their support and detailed, constructive criticism. Useful comments on the text were welcomed from Jenny Blain, Edward Evans, Darren Glazier, Graham Harvey, Andrew Jones, Kenneth Lymer, Alexander Woodcock, and two anonymous JRAI readers. I thank Sophia Jundi for her line drawings, and students on the MA Archaeology and Anthropology of Rock Art and MA Art aIld Representation courses, Department of Archaeology, University of Southampton, for lively debates which contributed to the arguments presented in this article. The neuropsychological model proposes three loosely defined stages of trance: stage one, perception of entoptics; stage two, construal of entoptics; and stage three, perception of entop- tics and iconics. In all stages, imagery may be subject to seven principles of visual transforma- tion: replication, fragmentation, integration, superpositioning, juxtapositioning, reduplication, and rotation (Lexis-Williams &amp; Dowson 1988). 2Similar sorcerers were named bh,ile on Ambrym, and abile and nabviwil on Pentecost (Lane 1965: 26(0-1). 3Followiing early reports such as Layard's (1930a; 1930b; see also Wright 1940), there has been more recent interpretative research (esp. Stephen 1979a; Eves 1995, and brief coimments in Trompf 1991), for example, in Polynesia (e.g. Thomas 1989: 1994), though the subject has received most attention in New Guinea (e.g. Godelier 1986; Herdt 1977; Herdt &amp; Stephen 1989; Modjeska 1991; Stephen 1979b; 1987a; 19871; A. Strathern 1994). 4Use of the terms 'trance', 'altered states', or 'ecstasy' as the major defining characteristic of shamanisms, as Eliade (1964) and Lewis (1989) have done, is contested by Humphrey (1996: 754</page><page sequence="21">ROBERT J. WALLIS 30-1). As well as the presence of altered consciousness (arguably a more nuanced term that 'altered state' or 'altered state of consciousness'), the approach advocated here requires two other 'elements of shamanisms' to infer shamanisms. Not all shamanic practices require altered con- sciousness; this approach accommodates such diversity but stresses that altered consciousness is consistently present in the shaman's vocation. 5For explanation of this term and its appropriateness over such value-laden categories as 'psychoactive' and 'hallucinogen', see Forte (1997) and Council on spiritual practices: &lt;www.csp.org.&gt; 6This is in contrast to his interpretation of the violent shaking as associated with epilepsy: current thinking avoids pejorative links between mental illness and shamanism made by earlier scholars. The violent shaking, apparently quite separate from the 'laughing', may also be indica- tive of possession by spirits (e.g. Langness 1965); I follow Lewis (1989) in not divorcing shaman- isms from possession or mediumship where specific socially constituted instances show permeability between such Western imposed categories. 7See, for example, Patterson (1998: fig. 4); Sales (1992: fig. 2); see also Creighton (2000: fig. 2.7), on Iron Age coinage.

Les 'bwili', escrocs volants de Malakula: une discussion critique des debats recents sur l'art rupestre, l'ethnographie et les shamanismes Resume L'utilisation du 'shamanisme', de la neuropsychologie ou de tous les deux dans l'inter- pretation des images de l'art rupestre a et6 tres contest&amp;e, et les avis sont souvent polarises entre ce qu'on pourrait appeler 'shamaniaques' et 'shamanphobes' selon qu'ils appuient ou s'opposent a ces lignes d'enquete. Or ce sont les analyses ethnographiques qui ont le plus souffert dans cette controverse. Dans cet article, j'explore l'ethnographie qu'a faite Kayard des bivili ou 'escrocs volants' de Malakula en Melanesie afin d'interprter l'art rupestre au Nord-ouest de l'ile- dans la meme region et, selon les apparences, de la meme epoque que les bwili de Layard. Par contraste avec les interpretations shamaniaques sans discerne- ment et 1'equation erronee 'entoptique = shamanisme', ainsi qu'en defi aux critiques des shamanophobes, je theorise le terme 'shamanismes', j'examine scrupuleusement l'ethnogra- phie de Layard puis j'applique en critique le modele neuropsychologique de Lewis-Williams et Dowson (1988) pour offrir une interpretation de l'art rupestre du Nord-ouest de Malakula. Le but de cet article est donc de retablir ces demarches - ethnographie et neuropsychologie - dans leurs fonctions d'elements complementaires dans l'interpretation de l'art rupestre.
