EVER Blessed God, Thou art infinitely exalted above our highest thoughts of praise and adoration : Thou needest no sacrifice at our hands, and no words of thanksgiving or prayer that we can utter before Thee. But we, the creatures of thy power and children of thy love and mercy, would sanctify every scene of our lives by the thought of thy presence; and we now desire to bow ourselves down to acknowledge and to worship Thee, as the Father of our spirits and the Sovereign Lord of all. Do Thou lift up the light of thy countenance upon us, and accept the purposes which bring us here to call upon thy name, as those who would work and speak and think as Thou commandest. "We rejoice, merciful Father, that in all things we are in thy hand ; for Thou art the Author of every good and perfect gift, and Thou sheddest abund¬ antly upon us of the manifold riches of thy bounty. In the countless wonders and beauties of outward nature it is thy spirit that is present, speaking to our inmost hearts and revealing Thee to us as the living God who art near us in our daily path and abidest with us for ever. And in those higher capacities of our spirits, thy great and precious gifts of intellect, conscience, and affection, which lead us to thoughts of love, of duty, of truth, and of holi¬ ness, Thou revealest thyself more plainly to our souls, reminding us evermore of that divine image wherein man is created, and by many sure and abiding results of thy providence proclaiming thyself the Lord God Omnipotent, who livest and reignest for ever and ever. 0 Thou Being of beings, by these signs and tokens of Thyself we are taught that Thou carest for us, and we pray Thee to fill us with the conviction and uphold us in the faith that Thou art with us in every deed of righteousness and mercy, and in every effort that Ave make for the diffusion of knowledge, liberty, and peace in the world around us. Even in the darker scenes of our lives may we feel that Thou dost not leave us nor forsake us; for that even by means of trial, of adversity, and suffering, both men and nations shall work out their salvation and attain unto the perfectness which Thou hast destined</page><page sequence="8">6 them to reach. May no sorrow and no adversity move us from this our reliance upon Thee. Give us to partake of the trust and submission that were in Christ, that we too may be enabled to do our Father's work, and in all things to say, " Not as I will, but as Thou wilt." And yet we pray Thee to give us more and still more of that hopefulness and energy which will enable us duly to forget the things that are behind, and still to press forward towards the better light of the more perfect day; and still to exert ourselves cheerfully and strenuously as for thy cause and in thy sight. Touch our hearts, that we may gratefully remember those who have gone before us, who have faithfully served Thee in their day and generation, who have lived and died as in thy service, and into whose labours we have entered. May their patient and steadfast spirit not be wanting in our lives; that we may be enabled to imitate their example, and to hand down to those who shall come after us the same love of truth, of charity, and righteousness that animated them. Thus, O Lord God, by the faithfulness of thy servants, and by the efforts of sincere and upright men of every nation and party and church, may thy Kingdom draw near and come, and thy will be done on earth even as it is in Heaven; and may wre, who here bow ourselves before Thee, be found worthy to contribute in our humble measure to the promotion of thy glory. Hear us in these our prayers and aspirations; accept and bless us even in the midst of oui imperfections and sins; and to Thee, the only wdse God our Saviour, be glory and majesty and dominion and power, both now and for ever. Amen.</page><page sequence="9">PR A YE R OTHOU Eternal Spirit, within whose measureless time our years and centuries he enfolded, may our hearts rise up in adoration to thee, and our minds escape from their servitude to transient interests and opinions, and rest in thy truth and love, which abide and change not. Our fathers have fallen asleep, and generation after generation has laid down the burden of this earthly life ; man's eager passions and ambitious dreams have sunk into oblivion, and the grass has grown upon the grave of many a buried hope ; but thy kingdom and thy righteousness are with us still; rich fruit has been borne by the labours and sufferings of the faithful, and our hearts beat high to-day for the freedom of thy sons. The communion of thy holy Spirit binds us to the far past, and amid the fleeting shadows of our mortal lot, we see the light that has shone in the eyes of saints and prophets, and we feel the throb of that divine life which has dwelt within thy servants in the olden time, and appeared in its beauty and power in the face of the Beloved. In thee, 0 God of our fathers, in thee who beheldest the infant world rising at thy word out of chaos, and whose thought stands fast in its own unchanging laws, we shake off the limits of time, and all thy holy ones of every age become one brotherhood, the enduring temple of thy Spirit, wherein is revealed thine own eternal life. 0 God of infinite majesty, may we be clothed with humility as we enter this temple, and, in answer to thy call, take upon ourselves to minister in its undying services. May "holiness to the Lord" be written on our hearts ; array us in thine own righteousness ; illumine us with thy light and truth, and cleanse with thy grace the secret sources of our living. "We would bow ourselves with awe in thy encircling presence, and wait upon thee, hushing the restless cry of our own thought and desire, that we may listen with lowliest reverence for thy word. Ah Lord God, how hard we find it thus to silence the clamour of our self-righteousness, and hear thy still voice. Yet, speak to us once more, and unstop our deaf ears. 0 loving Father, thou speakest, and art never silent; but open quiet and hallowed depths in our souls, and mortify our self-will, that we may perceive</page><page sequence="10">that it is thou, and understand what it is thou sayest. Through the brief trust of our mortal life may we be found faithful, obedient to those high principles of justice and right which we have inherited, and ready for every new message from thy Spirit. "With fear for our own faithlessness and weakness, but with a holy confidence in thee, we take up the duty of our time. Lead us along our uncertain path. May we never swerve through doubting thee, but, heedless alike of the enticements and the reproaches of the world, follow with gentle simplicity the clear shining of thy will. Give us a large, impartial vision of thy truth; and as the fields of knowledge slowly open to our view, may we receive thy growing revelations with reverent joy, and bo enabled, through our com¬ munion with thee and the sacrifice of our self-love, to combine them still into the unity of faith. Enrich us with a wide sympathy for men, that within their struggles and errors we may still see the good striving for the mastery ; and give us wisdom to show them the better way, and point to thee, the centre of peace and light, above the gloom and bitterness of mutual estrangement. Pour into our hearts the pitying love of Christ, that we may bring healing to the world's anguish, and to its sin a life-giving hope. May the spirit of thy Son abound in us more and more, filling us with all wisdom and spiritual understanding, and changing us into the heavenly image from glory to glory. 0 thou, who art above all, and through all, and in us all, bind us together in the unity of that spirit, and make us one through our common consciousness of fellowship with thee. Thou, Father, hast called us to plead for a larger truth and a deeper charity; receive and bless our humble wish to be dedicated to thy service, and, in answer to the claims of love and duty, to be of use to our fellow-men; and when the time comes that our voices can speak and our arms can labour no more, may it be ours, through thy wonderful grace, to feel that we have not wholly spoiled thy work, but can hand it on, still bearing the mark of its divinity, to a new generation. 0 God of ages, the end is thine, and it shall surely be accomplished. "We come, and pass away ; but thou shalt endure, and at last the earth shall be full of the knowledge of thee as the wraters cover the deep. And now unto thee, the King eternal, immortal, invisible, God only wise, be honour and glory, dominion and power, for ever and ever. Amen.</page><page sequence="11">SERMON. "Then said he unto them, 'Therefore every scribe which is instructed unto the king¬ dom of heaven is like unto a man that is an householder, which bringeth out of his treasure things now and old.' "—-Matthew &lt;riii., 52. A hundred years It is a long time to one who looks back upon it from its further verge. For it means not only that no one survives to remember the men who were active at its beginning, but that three generations have suc¬ ceeded them, and that a fourth is already rising to maturity. And what a century it has been of which we are thinking now In 1786, George III. had not reached the middle point of his reign ; "William Pitt had only just begun his long Ministry. Three years before, England had acknowledged the inde¬ pendence of the United States of America ; three years later, the lurid drama of the French Revolution will open in the storming of the Bastille. An exclu¬ sively Protestant Parliament still sits in Ireland. Catholics and Noncon¬ formists in England have to be content with maimed political privileges. We mark the very year—we bring back to memory the scene and the chief actors upon it, when we say that in 1786 Edmund Burke moved for the impeachment of "Warren Hastings. "What solid national progress we have made since that time ; what conquests of civil and religious liberty we have won ; how the English nation has grown great, not only in its native seat but on many seas, till its language and its institutions encircle the world in their embrace ; with what swift and victorious step natural science has penetrated into the region of the unknown ; how sure canons of criticism have enabled us to dispel the dark¬ ness of primaeval times, and to reconstruct the early history of our race ; what terrible mistakes of policy we have made, what duties neglected or only half performed ; what large responsibilities we have taken on our own shoulders, and those of our children,—all this is a thrice-told tale, not to be repeated now. It is indeed a changed, a greater England in which we live. And it may be that you feel the moment at which I am addressing you to be one of national perplexity and almost despondency. We are trying to solve problems, political and social, of unexampled difficulty. Our desire to transform our</page><page sequence="12">10 island commonwealth into a true City of God was never so pure and high ; but wre are told that old methods have failed in our hands, and that we must try new ones. We are almost beginning to believe that the sad poet was right, when he speaks of our country as " The weary Titan, with deaf Ears, and labour-dimmed eyes # * * Bearing on shoulders immense Atlantean, the load, Well nigh not to be borne, Of the too vast orb of her fate." But look back, 0 friends and fellow-countrymen, over a hundred years, and remembering what we have done, what we have suffered, what we have won for mankind, thank God and take courage. He has yet in store for us a worthy work, a noble fate. Yet a hundred years ago is but as yesterday in the lifetime of a University, vifter a long interval, we are again entering upon a period in which new Colleges arc being endowed, new Universities instituted; though the general history of higher education in Europe shows, in a strange way, how men have been content with, and constant to the old centres of learning and light. Edinburgh and Leiden, mere juniors among European Universities, count their third century complete. Heidelberg, Tubingen, Leipzig, survive in unimpaired vitality from the 15th century ; while it seems to the student of mediasval history as if there never had been a time since learning began to lift its head above the flood of barbaric invasion, at which students did not congre¬ gate at Paris, Bologna, Oxford. At this rate, Manchester New College is only just beginning to live, and can hardly yet be conscious of what great possi¬ bilities may be before it. But as I have already pointed out to you, its one poor century has been singularly changeful, and, almost beyond example, rich in intellectual fruit for mankind. I do not claim for the men of my own age any superiority in learning and genius over their predecessors in any other; I imagine that the ability and energy of mankind remain, for the most part, at an average level. But there are ages of revelation, and this is one of them. There are times at which it is a part of God's wise design in the education of humanity that knowledge should grow and prevail mightily; that great cam¬ paigns should bo fought and won against obstinate and inscrutable nature ; that man should look back upon his own history with fresh eyes, and resolve in a new way the riddle of his fate. And it is something for a College which, however inadecpiate its intellectual means, cherishes an aspiration after univer¬ sality, and would " make all knowledge its province," to have lived through</page><page sequence="13">11 such a time. But it would be much more if it could justly boast that from the beginning it had happily divined the true principles of research and educa¬ tion, in higher and more conspicuous places neglected or denied; and that throughout its career, though not cheered by any signal success, nor ever filling a large place in the eye of the world, and compelled to be content with the triumph of its methods, rather than its own, it had never swerved from the aims of its first founders. And this is the claim which I make for Manchester New College to-day. Or shall I withdraw that vain word " boast" 1 For it lies in the very nature of all great principles, all fine emotions, all noble passions, not that they are ours, to have and to glory in, but that we are theirs, moved by them, possessed by them, strengthened and purified by them, changed by them into unworthy instruments of God. We will not glory in these things, but it is much if we be found faithful to them. The English Presbyterians of the end of the 17 th and the beginning of the 18th century, compelled to accept an imperfect toleration, when they had hoped for equality and comprehension, found themselves excluded from the National Universities, while at the same time they cherished an ardent love of sacred learning. They met the difficulty as best they could, by the institution of academies, in which the most erudite of their ministers gathered round them young men, laymen and divines, and gave them the completest education that their intellectual means permitted. Nor am I prepared to say that the exclusion of our forefathers from Oxford and Cambridge was an unmixed disadvantage. There was more of plain living and high thinking in these modest academies than in the stately halls and noble libraries on the banks of Isis and of Cam; and if the opportunities of knowledge which they offered were necessarily smaller, they were at least approached by a finer method, and in a more disinterested spirit. I have not to tell you to-day the history of those academies. As the century advanced the high school kept by a single minister developed into the College taught by many teachers. Warrington ran its brief and brilliant course, illustrated by the names of Taylor, Priestley, Enfield, Aikin ; in 1786, Manchester took up the torch, for a moment dropped, which it has not yet handed over to a stouter and swifter runner. But all these institutions, academies and colleges alike, have been free schools. Circumstances have, it is true, marked out for them a definite sphere of action, but they have been without limits of principle. Of their teachers, they have asked only that they should be able to teach thoroughly, learnedly, and impartially; of their pupils, that they should bring docile and unprejudiced minds to the acquisition of knowledge. They have thought it a good thing, in the interest of education itself, that men of different opinions, intended for different professions, should meet in the same classes and</page><page sequence="14">12 receive the same instruction. It was all a paradox then, when the signature of the Thirty Nine Articles was deemed a necessary preliminary to the study of Aldrich's Logic, and the passage of the pons cmnorum; it is in part a paradox still, for they ventured, not without success, to teach theology too, on principles which the prejudice of this generation still pronounces absurd and impossible. But wisdom was justified of her children, when, in 1871, the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge were finally thrown open to Nonconformists and Catholics, and though few of us may live to see it, I look for her complete justification yet. When, therefore, "the very respectable meeting of gentlemen, which wras held on the 22nd February, 1786," resolved that their institution should be open " to young men of every religious denomination, from whom no test or confession of faith will bo required," they were faithful at once to the past and to the future. Their distinctive principle had even then a century's experience behind it; and in eighty-five years more was to receive solemn national recog¬ nition. But they were also the pioneers—I am afraid the almost forgotten pioneers—of a great educational movement, which the present generation desires to have set down to its credit. When Manchester was an insignificant country town, only just ceasing to be distinguished for its Jacobite loyalty, and before the enterprise and skill of its citizens had made it the central city of a circle of industrious cities, the busiest spot of manufacturing England, these men resolved that it, too, should be a seat of learning; that its sons should not have to repair to Oxford or Edinburgh, or Leiden to seek a complete training for any learned profession; that erudition should compete with commerce in the very market place, and the best education be brought to every man's door. It was a great thought: but they wore before their time. Their successors, men whom some of us have, known and honoured, were again before their time, when in 1840 they brought back the College from York to its ancient home and re¬ established it, not as a mere seminary for Dissenting divines, but a place of higher education level to the best wants of the city which had in the meantime grown so great. The ideal is now being transmuted into fact; Birmingham, Liverpool, Leeds, Nottingham, Sheffield, Bristol, all as well as Manchester, have Colleges, which are the hope of their advancing civilisation. But I never see the stately buildings in Oxford Road, so full of busy intellectual life, the home at once of a College with a large record of accomplished good, and of a nascent University, without thinking of the humbler roofs under which Manchester Now College strove to perform the same work, and failed,—not because she did not apprehend its conditions, or approached it with too low a thought,—but because the time was not yet.</page><page sequence="15">13 This part of its original function Manchester New College has necessarily abandoned to other hands. She cannot compete, even if she would, with open Universities, and Colleges rising in every great town, whose constitutions are as free as her own. But there remains the study of theology, which she has always maintained should be conducted on the same principle of candid enquiry and complete investigation, without the imposition upon teachers or scholars of any test, or confession of faith. And it is needless to say that this is a principle, the application of which is elsewhere stoutly denied, or at least only half¬ heartedly admitted. Why, it is asked, should not teachers teach what they themselves believe to be true Why should not learners be indoctrinated into the tenets commonly held by the church, which they will probably serve1? Why delay upon methods, instead of proceeding to results 1 Why spend upon enquiry, energies which ought to be employed in apprehending and assimilating the truth 1 I suppose that this attitude of mind was in the old days, and may still be in part, that which corresponds to the idea of orthodoxy. My church is in possession of the truth, all others wander in fatal error. This is the faith once delivered to the Saints, that a creed dictated by man's prejudices and passions; hero is a veritable succession of the Apostles, there a late-born abortion of human ignorance and presumption. Why teach heresy, when you can enforce truth 1 Why degrade the dignity of the Bride of Christ, by stooping to examine the pretensions of her rivals 1 But even where nothing of this feeling remains, an analogy derived from the procedure of the natural sciences, so strong, so victorious in our own time, leads men's minds astray. There, it is said, is no perpetual relaying of foundations, no constant re-examination of first principles; it is not left open to students to take different views on matters as to which scientific men are agreed; they are indoctrinated into what is known; they are confirmed in what is established. So let Unitarian teachers teach Unitarianism; everybody would be quite sure then that they meant just what they said, and had no hidden purpose beneath their wrords. And how much better it would be for Unitarianism 1 Perhaps; though that, too, is a question which I cannot help thinking would admit of argument. The difficulty is, that Manchester New College was estab¬ lished at the first to teach not Unitarianism, but theology, and means, so far as I can judge, to be faithful to the intentions of its founders. I do not know whether we ought to ascribe it to a merely human prescience, or not rather to a certain secret leading of God, that our Presbyterian forefathers early grasped and steadfastly adhered to this principle of free teaching and free learning in theology which, as I cannot but believe, has so great a future before it. From a worldly</page><page sequence="16">14 or sectarian point of view, they had nothing to gain by it. I dare say that if they had built walls of definition, and dug ditches of defence round their church, they might have been rewarded with a larger measure of visible success; they might have held their own more completely against Independent orthodoxy on one side, and Methodist enthusiasm on the other, and would certainly have escaped the reproach of soul-destroying Socinian heresy. All they got in exchange for this, was the liberty of the Hpirit in an obscure ecclesi¬ astical station. They were able to welcome and to take their part in the first vigorous efforts of reawakening science; in the person of Lardner they laid the foundations of modern Biblical criticism; in the person of Priestley, of that chemistry, which has since won so many triumphs. Throughout a century which, though it hid ill its bosom the germs of all that has blossomed and borne fruit in our own time, was yet weighed upon by forces of dullness and reaction, these men were always on the side of freedom;—freedom of theological thought* freedom of ecclesiastical organisation, freedom of political aspiration. They were for the peoples, against the kings; for the oppressed many, against the oppressing few. And more than all, they were, as the event has abundantly proved, for the future as against the present. But if this was so before 1786, are you dissatisfied with the history of the succeeding century 1 Have the men who gathered round Manchester New College as a centre, and drew their inspiration from its characteristic principle, lagged behind the progress of the age 1 I leave politics on one side : politics, in which the young arc always eager for reform, while the old stand contentedly upon the ancient ways; but if in the last hundred years, we have passed through a whole cycle of philosophical and theological change; if the study of natural science, ending in the grandest generalizations, has presented the mystery of the universe to men in a quite unexpected aspect; if criticism has thrown a flood of light upon primaeval history, and all early records,—and w7e have passed from decade to decade without painful rupture with all that went before, never losing exultant expectation of what was yet to come; and find ourselves, believing, as firmly, as joyfully as ever, that the whole secret of things is shut up in the one word, God, and that Christ is still Teacher, Friend, Exemplar, Captain of all faithful souls,—to what do wrc owe it, if not to the liberty in which, by God's grace, we have been able to stand fast 1 But, indeed, this principle of liberty of teaching and learning accurately answers to the nature of religious truth. What is it that you propose to teach on authority 1 The doctrines of the Unitarian, or any other church, so far as they can be defined 1 But any English Dissenting sect is only an insignificant fraction of the whole Christian Church ; surely you are not prepared to make</page><page sequence="17">15 the calm assumption, that it alone holds the whole truth, and that the protests and denials of all the rest of Christendom are not worth even examination At least your students should have the opportunity of choice, if for no other and better reason, that they will probably hold their own creed in a securer grasp if they know what is to be said for others and against it. But to go down nearer to the root of the matter, how will you treat truths, which all churches hold in common 1 The moment you look facts in the face the analogy with natural science breaks down ; everybody accepts the law of gravitation, while there is no fact of theology, oven the most fundamental, which commands universal assent. You begin with the being of God. All, why are there Atheists, why Agnostics,—men in many cases whose characters you must respect, whose intellectual powers you cannot afford to despise 1 You insist, perhaps, on the personality of Deity? Then you have against you the God-intoxicated Spinoza, and a host of thinkers who find that the line between Theism and Pantheism is only too easy to cross. I need not multiply examples ; it is characteristic of religious truth, that men should hold it in the firmest grasp of faith, yet own their inability to define it; that the emotions and passions to which it gives rise, should sway generation after generation, more powerfully than any others, yet that the intellectual bases on which it rests should be perpetually in dispute. We are finite beings, and cannot comprehend the infinite; that is the whole secret. We approach the central truths of religion now on this side, now on that: catching a glimpse of them, but never appre¬ hending them wholly. They run up into inconsistencies and contradictions, if we try to apply the method of logical development to them ; one man's insight agrees but partially with another's. It is the same, to a certain extent, with ethical truths ; practically we are agreed as to the obligation of justice, purity, pity; but when we come to ask whether that obligation is to be based on the dictate of an intuitive conscience, or whether it is a subtly-transmuted form of self-regard, or whether it is the result of a calculation as to the greatest good of the greatest number, the turmoil of the schools begins, and we are deafened and confused by conflicting theories. Nay, push even physics to the wall, and ask her transcendental questions : what is matter, what force, what the world's ultimate reality,—and you will encounter a state of opinion such as she is wont to blame and deride in theology. I yield to no one in my desire for definite opinion and open speech in matters of religion, whenever they are possible; but I know that there is no more dangerous form of error than to invent clear outlines when they do not exist, and to pretend an unreal and impossible certainty. I hold the Athanasian Creed to be the falsest of theological docu¬ ments, simply because it is the most precise.</page><page sequence="18">16 Add, then, to these considerations, that at least two opinions are possible upon every point of Biblical criticism, and that the story of the Church has been told by men whose judgment has been warped by ecclesiastical prejudice,— and you will, I think, have justification enough for the theological method of the College. If the object of teaching be, first, the attainment of truth by the scholar, and next, that he should hold the truth when attained, in a firm grasp of intelligent and conscientious conviction, I do not see what other method is possible. And this, too, is the only method that holds the promise of the future. Why has theology hitherto been an unprogressive science 1 Why has it been subject to cataclysms and revolutions Why has reform, for centuries past, necessarily taken the shape of disintegration 1 How is it that theologians differ hopelessly among themselves, and only put on a delusive appearance of agreement, when they are attacked from without 1. Surely because, forgetting the character of the truths with which they were concerned, they have per¬ sistently clung to the dogmatic method of research and instruction; because they have loved orthodoxy, whether of the many or the few, more than trutli; because they have thought God better served by the maintenance of pious assumptions than by the admission of unwelcome facts. For myself, I have no expectation that theology will ever put on the form of an exact science ; or that it will be able to present its truths in such a way as to command universal and unconditional assent. But whatever is possible in that direction will first begin to be realised, when the method of free teaching and free learning is generally adopted ; when the complete erudition at which it aims, and the im¬ partial spirit of investigation which it alone fosters, are patiently brought to bear, by many active and devout minds, upon the deepest and most difficult problems which offer themselves for human solution. My text compares the scribe—" instructed into the kingdom of heaven "— to a householder, " which bringeth out of his treasure things new and old." And so the work of the Christian Minister is always two-fold. The first part of it, in appearance the most difficult, in reality the easiest, is to present to his hearers, directly or indirectly, the results of a finished erudition; the second, which seems simple enough, but which asks a wider range of power, and is possible only to a sympathetic insight into humanity and a humble walk with God, is to touch their hearts, to prick their consciences, to awaken in them the awe of the Infinite, to raise them to a sense of the dignity and mystery of life. And it is plain that the work of a College as such, directly covers the first alone, and is only indirectly concerned with the second. Human methods of instruction make the scholar; it is the Holy Spirit who prats a message upon the</page><page sequence="19">17 lips of the prophet, and moulds the saint into a consummate holiness. Yet here, too, we cling to the idea, that ignorance has no necessary connexion with enthusiasm, that the most accurate and the widest erudition often goes with the humility of spirit, the purity of heart, which wrere so dear to the soul of Christ; that one whose mind is stored with all various knowledge may yet thrill with the passion of humanity, and burn with ardour for the Kingdom of God. I am prepared to take the consequences of truth whatever they may be ; but I have yet to learn that she will not live in one blessed bond of sisterhood, with faith, with hope, and above all with charity. Yes, young men have sometimes gone out of this, as well as other Colleges, proud of the scanty learning that they had acquired, and dreaming that they were in possession of a philosophical key that would unlock all the world's mysteries; and then, little by little, have found in difficulties which they could not resolve, in wrongs which they could not redress, in sorrows which they could not console, in social ills for which they had no remedy,—that which brought them to their knees, and made them humble, self-denying, self-forgetting servants of the Cross. If for ourselves all vain glory is excluded, if our only word is, we have done what was our duty to do—alas not even that—and at the best are unprofitable servants, we can at least thank God for those who have been in time past beacon lights of goodness, strong and sweet spirits from whom virtue went out to all around them. And we will commemorate our saints. Who that knew him could help loving John James Tayler, who to the learning and piety of an old Benedictine joined a sweet geniality of spirit, which only a lifetime of kindly intercourse with men could have moulded into its perfect unselfishness 1 And there was Travers Madge, as I recollect him, before the ill-health and disappointment which could not obscure his faith in God, or damp his ardour for humanity, had brought a stoop into his shoulders, and darkened the light of his eye; bold, bright, beautiful; the very ideal of Christ's young soldier. My bead-roll of saints might easily be lengthened ; but I pause; each one of us has his own recollections, tender, sacred, sweet beyond words : the dead are with us to-day. After all, it is in connexion with the spiritual rather than the intellectual part of our work, that we can claim communion with the past, and lay a sure hold of hope upon the future. The scholar's fame is almost as fleeting as the orator's or the actor's, though for a different reason : whatever lasting result he achieves is cast into the general storehouse of human knowledge, and ceases to have a personal reference; while just in proportion as knowledge is progressive, the old is forgotten in the new. Philosophical systems have their day, and fall into oblivion ; till presently speculation, always eager, always baffled, takes up</page><page sequence="20">18 again the old solutions, and tries to make them answer the old riddles. So of confessions of faith, written and unwritten ; they rarely touch the reality of tilings tit more than one living point of contact: and overlooking or denying the existence of others, become tainted with an incompleteness, "which is only not falsehood. You take up your parable against Calvanism? Yet in the spiritual world it answers exactly to the scientific conception of the invaria¬ bility of law. You insist upon the ethical aspect of religion, and declare, in Christ's words, that the tree_ must be judged by its fruits; and then comes Luther, with his doctrine of justification by faith alone, to teach you how the tree is to be made good, how the heart is to be melted, purified, trans¬ formed in the heat of a divine passion. You protest that priests are but men, and all men priests, and declaim with just indignation against the abuses of the sacerdotal system; and lo! the Church of Rome turns your flank, with its army of Saints, and asks you if that faith can be wdiolly naught, which issues in such conquests of self-mastery and love. And so I might go on, almost indefinitely, showing how no single development of Christianity can be more than a contribution to the sum of religious truth as apprehended by men; how every coloured ray is necessary to make up the white light, and how egregiously we deceive ourselves if we think that our own form of faith is the one pure, flawless chrysolite, which needs to borrow beauty and radiance from no other. But we are on different and firmer ground when we turn from theology to religion; from the controversies of the schools to the labours of the Church; from the problems of the study to the service of the Kingdom. Those may change from age to age; these are always the same; through those we " sound on our dim and perilous way," thankful for any guidance, any light, any rest;—in these we go from strength to strength; the Infinite and All Holy One besets us behind and before, and beneath us are the Everlasting Arms. And while I thankfully acknowledge and commemorate for you, as well as for myself, the learning, the love of truth, the faith in freedom, which have for a hundred years distinguished the teachers of Manchester New College; and at the same time, record my belief and hope, that in none of these things it will, during its next century of life, fall below the high standard of the past; my heart's desire and prayer for Alma Mater is, that her children, yet to be born, may more and more see God with open vision, and follow Christ with lowly wills and docile hearts, and spend themselves, even unto death, for the Kingdom of heaven upon earth. So may century after century roll away; and men, grateful for the light that streams from her, more grateful for the love which is the very pulse of her heart, cry, Esto Perpetua. Amen.</page><page sequence="21">RECEPTION AT THE MANCHESTER TOWN HALL.

The Mayor took the chair at seven o'clock, and upon rising to address the company, was received with much applause. He said : Ladies and Gentle¬ men,—I esteem it a very high honour to have been invited to occupy the chair to-night, though, considering the nature of the Institution whose Centenary we are celebrating, and the character and high reputation of most of those who are intimately connected with its management, I feel that it wrould have been far more appropriate to the occasion if some gentleman had been selected to occupy this position who has gained distinction in theology, or literature, or science. But there is one consideration that perhaps induced those who undertook the management of this celebration to invite me to preside; and it will, I trust, free me from any charge of presumption in accepting that invitation, namely, that I have the honour to hold, at present, the office of chief magistrate of the town in which the College was founded a century ago, and the name of which it bears, though no longer located here. (Applause.) For, although as you see by the very interesting extract from the original minute prefixed to our programme, this institution had a predecessor at Warrington, yet it is to this town that the honour really belongs of having founded the Manchester Now College—(hear, hear)—and, in spite of the fact that its location was for many years at York, and is now in London, the names which had been during the past one hundred years principally associated with the College are the names of Lancashire and Manchester men. (Applause.) Apart from the special</page><page sequence="23">21 reasons assigned in the report of the original proceedings for the selec¬ tion of this town as the local habitation of the Academy—amongst which reasons I am glad to note one which shows how good a cha¬ racter Manchester had a century ago for the maintenance of order, through the " excellent system of police" then existing here—(applause and laughter);—apart, I say, from those special reasons, you may be sure that then, as now, this community was noted for the culture and refine¬ ment, the public spiritedness, the regard for education, and the readiness to promote all good works, which is the distinguishing feature of its leading citizens down to the present clay. The transference of the College to York, in the early half of the present century, and its subsequent removal to London thirty years ago, were due to educational requirements, and not to any falling off of local interest in the Institution; and the readiness with which these changes were adopted, and the continuance of the hearty support of its Manchester patrons and friends are an additional proof of their real interest in it, and their desire to promote its success, without allowing any petty feelings of local jealousy to interfere with their judgment. (Applause.) In spite of the removals, there was still a hearty reciprocity of affection between the College and the City whose name it bore ; and this is, perhaps, only natural when you recall the list of worthy names which have appeared from time to time on the College roll of Professors and Students—names which are associated in our memories with great services rendered to the community and to the nation, both in public and private capacities. (Hear, hear.) I may name a few of those of whom we, as citizens of Manchester, as well as friends of the Manchester New College, are all proud—Dr. Barnes, Ralph Harrison, John James Tayler, Robert Brook Aspland, Robert Hyde Greg, Mark Philips, James Heywrood, John Kenrick, John Gooch Robberds, and William Gaskoll—(applause)—all of whom have passed away, but whose memorial has not perished with them. To pass to names of those -who still occupy honoured positions amongst us, there are Dr. Martineau,—(applause)—Dr. Vancesmith, the Rev. John Robberds, Dr. Drummond—(applause)—the Rev. Charles Beard,—(renewed applause)— and others ; nor must we omit, on such an occasion as this, to mention the names of men who, though not educated at the College, were associated with it by their tutorial services, such as John Dalton, Robert Finlay, Francis W. Newman, and Eddowes Bowman. (Applause.) It would be invidious for me to select for special mention many other local names which occur frequently on the College rolls, such as Philips, Fielden, Turner, and Potter, which are as familiar to us in Manchester as household words. (Applause.) Nor would it be becoming</page><page sequence="24">22 on my part, to praise in their presence the men to whom the conduct of the College is now committed. They are worthy to rank 'with those already named; and of them and of their predecessors we are justly proud, because they have kept alight, and handed down from generation to generation through the long period of one hundred years, the torch of free and enlightened study in the greatest and most important of all subjects—that of religion. (Applause.) The Rev. S. Alfred Steinthal, Chairman of the Committee, rose and said: Mr. Mayor, Ladies, and Gentlemen,—It is an unfortunate circumstance, in every gathering like the present, that we begin with an expression of regret; and I have now to express the sincere sorrow of the Committee of Man¬ chester New College that I should hold in my hand so many letters of apology as I do, for absence on the present occasion. I do not intend to read all these letters to you; but there are one or two that I am sure you would be glad to hear; and one is from our revered president, Dr. Martineau. (Applause.) Dr. Martineau writes :— " The attraction that draws me towards the Centenary Meeting at Manchester on the 22nd inst., is so strong that I have not found courage, without unseemly delay, to take adequate account of the restraining reasons which justify resistance on the part of my daughters and my friends. But though I can hardly bear the idea of being absent on an occasion so full of interest on public and private grounds, I must bend my will to the limitations of age and circumstance, and be content to be with you only in heart. I am kept to the house at present by a lameness in one foot, which, though of no real conse¬ quence, puts me for a little while under restrictions which cannot well accompany me on a journey, and into the stir of a friendly gathering. I reserve my hopes, therefore, for the London meeting in June. "With man}7 thanks for the invitation, and regrets at the answer, " I am, always most cordially, "JAMES MARTINEAU." I have a further letter here from an old student of Manchester New College, who dates even earlier on our roll than Dr. Martineau. Dr. Martineau's connection with the College began in 1822; the Rev. Richard Shawcross, who writes regretting that age prevents him from being here, was a Manchester College student, at York, in the year 1817. He sends his greetings to us. (Applause.) I have a letter here from Mr. Robert N. Philips—(applause)— who regrets that other engagements prevent his being with us; and since he wrote that we all of us have, with the deepest sorrow, learnt how severe a personal affliction has fallen upon him and his family; and we cordially, I am sure, from this meeting send our sympathy to him. I have a letter, also, from Sir Henry Roscoe—(applause)—whose parliamentary duties prevent his being with us to-day. I have a long list of apologies from others who are absent from</page><page sequence="25">23 us; I can only name amongst them one of your colleagues, Mr. Mayor, who is an old student of Manchester New College, Alderman Sir Thomas Baker. (Hear, hear.) He was a student of the College from 1827; and I regret to say that it is, in his case again, illness that prevents his being with us to-night. (Hear, hear.) I have also a letter here from the daughter of an old student, Mr. Busk, who was a student from 1823, and who regrets that age and infirmity prevent his being with us; but his sympathy with the principles of our College is still as lively as in the old days of studentship at York. (Applause.) Having now given these apologies, it becomes my duty—my pleasant duty— in the name of the Committee, to welcome those who are gathered together here ; and to thank you, Mr. Mayor, for the extreme kindness with which you have received us in your hospitable halls to-day. (Applause.) It is really an unexpected gratification to see the lively interest which has been displayed in the assemblage of so many friends at this Centenary Meeting of what is to us, par excellent, "the College." Those of us who are old students of Manchester New College are delighted to see so many faces of those who were our companions in our bright student days; to look around and see those who preceded us, and succeeded us in their studies, and who, I trust, -will always strive to keep alive that reverent spirit of enlightened free and religious thought which has characterised our College from its first foundation, and which makes those of us who are its students proud indeed that we can claim Manchester New College as our Alma Mater. (Applause.) I do not know how to express my own sense of personal obligation to those gentlemen, all of them either Yorkists or Manchester College men, who have taken part in the services to which we have listened to-day. (Hear, hear.) I feel that it is not a right thing to pass this evening by -without thanking them for the high tone with which they all inspired our proceedings— (hear, hear)—for the way in which they led our hearts up to the Throne of Grace, and made us feel indeed grateful for those rich privileges which through the College we have received, and which not only we but all our societies have received. (Hear, hear.) It was indeed a pleasure to me to listen to those glowing words of power which my friend, Charles Beard, addressed to us from the pulpit. (Applause.) I rejoice to think that we shall have the privilege of refreshing our memories by reading those words, and seeing with what wonderful power and sugges'tiveness, in a few masterly strokes, he placed before us the true history of our College, and showed how, in darker days than these in which we now live, the fathers of our Churches established this Institution; and how, although it was not a mighty Institution as far as the world counts power, yet the</page><page sequence="26">24 high principles which were then laid down have shown a method of study in the very highest branches of knowledge, which we thankfully see is gradually being recognised as true by those who, in the olden time, had not the far- sighted prescience of those whom we claim as our spiritual ancestors. And while thanking my friend, Mr. Beard, for that powerful sermon, and for the wonderfully touching way in which he brought before the minds of many of us the remembrance of saintly ones at whose feet we have sat, and whose example and whose influence we feel in every highest moment of our lives to¬ day, I thank him further especially for the way in which he encouraged us to persevere in the good work that has been so well done hitherto; and would join most heartily in that prayer with which he concluded, that this our College may indeed have before it a life to which time shall place no end. (Ap¬ plause.) And, if I venture, in addition, to speak of what only a few of those in this audience will be able to follow me in, I should like that our Principal, Dr. Drummond, would permit us in connection with the work which we shall have to publish, commemorating this our Centenary Meeting, to include the sermon which he delivered in Cross Street Chapel yesterday, in our publication. (Applause.) I am sure that it was not without a sense of the peculiar fitness of the subject that he chose to tell us of the progressive changes of theological study combined with the essential permanence of the religious spirit, and showed us the very essence of that life which makes Manchester New College ever increasingly powerful for good amongst us.—Now, having said so much, I will not stand between you and those who are to follow me any longer, but with your leave will, as Chairman of the Committee, lay the following resolution before you, and call upon you all heartily to unite in declaring— " That, on this the one hundreth anniversary of its foundation, THE SUPPORTERS AND FRIENDS OF MANCHESTER New COLLEGE THANKFULLY AND HOPEFULLY RENEW ITS PLEDGE, FREELY TO IMPART THEOLOGICAL KNOWLEDGE WITHOUT INSISTING UPON THE ADOPTION OF PARTICULAR THEOLOGICAL DOCTRINES, AND ONCE MORE DECLARE THEIR CONVICTION THAT IN THE FREE LEARNING, AND FN THE FREE TEACHING OF SUCH KNOWLEDGE, WILL ALWAYS BE FOUND THE MOST EFFICIENT SAFEGUARDS AT ONCE OF PURE AND PERSONAL SPIRITUAL RELIGION, AND OF UNAFFECTED SELF-SURRENDER IN THE BOUNDLESS UNITY OF THE ONE CHURCH OF HlM WHO IS A SPIRIT, AND WHO MUST BE WORSHIPPED IN SPIRIT AND IN TRUTH." (ApplaUSO.) That resolution is a declaration of the principles upon which Manchester New College was established, and for the furtherance of which it lives. It</page><page sequence="27">25 will now be illustrated by the Rev. Alexander Gordon, who is especially familiar with the antecedents and history of the College ; by Dr. Drummond, our able and devoted Principal; and by our eloquent friend from outside the College, the Rev. Chas. Hargrove. The Rev. Alexander Gordon, M.A., who rose at the call of the Mayor, amidst cheers, said : Mr. Mayor, Fellow-Collegians, and Friends,—It is not with any reference to the weather in Manchester this evening that I begin by saying that I hope to disperse a little fog, and this by " the light of other days," for, while wre may be proud to speak of this as the one-hundredth anniversary of the College of which many of us have been, and some of us still are members, we may go a little further back with our arithmetic, and may claim that what was done this day a century ago was rather the reconstruction of an existing organisation than the creation of a new life. (Hear, hear.) In the first week of March, 1670, two things happened, one up in Westminster, another down here in the North; according to some of the best authorities, they occurred on the same identical day, but I will not press the minor coincidence. The House of Lords and the House of Commons joined in an address to " His Most Sacred Majesty," returning him thanks for bringing some seditious fanatics to justice, and desiring that the laws might be put in execution against Dissenters and Popish recusants; and that same week, perhaps on that same day, in an old- fashioned manor-house in Yorkshire, at Rathmell (which anyone may find who travels by the Midland Railway, and who, getting out at Settle, will walk a little more than a mile) a clergyman somewhat under 39 years of age dipped his pen, and entered the name of the first student of a Nonconformist university. I use that term advisedly, for this, indeed, was what " Academy " really meant. The powers that wore in Church and State said, " Nonconformity shall die." Richard Frankland took a step which meant " Nonconformity shall live." (Applause.) Nonconformity had been permitted to have, for a few years, a semi-animate existence. The fact is, that a good deal of the High Church zeal of the metropolis had been burnt out in the Great Fire. In the wooden taber¬ nacles, which the Nonconformists then made haste to put up in London, they wrere permitted to preach. The houses as well as the churches were burnt; the rents did not come in ; and the rectors did not think it worth while to interfere with their Nonconforming brethren just at that particular emergency. This went on until, as I said, in March, 1670, the thing had got so high that it must be stopped; and in the next month, on the 11th day of April, 1670, was passed the new Conventicle Act, a piece of legislation of which it has been said that " the wit of man could hardly invent anything, short of capital punishment,</page><page sequence="28">26 more cruel and inhuman." It was just when this Conventicle Act was starting on its fell work that Richard Frankland began his institution. Now, I have to prove that Richard Frankland's Academy is our academy. Let me begin by saying that I hold that Richard Frankland's Academy was the first institution of the kind. I am well aware that there are other claims. There is a claim from Wales, and genealogies in "Wales are long, though they do not always bear very close examination at the upper end. (Laughter.) I have looked into the genealogies of all the contemporary Academies, and the only one of which I can say, " Here is a precise date; and you cannot tell me the name of any student who could have been in the course of his collegiate education among Nonconformists at an earlier date, or even a contemporary date," the only one of which I can say that, is Richard Frankland's Academy at Rathmell, begun in the first week of March, 1670. The next thing about it is that the Bishops were down, even Tillotson was down—though Tillotson was him¬ self the son of a Nonconformist, yet Archbishop Tillotson was down upon this institution; and first, because it was conducted " in so public a manner." Many of those old Nonconformist schools and academies hid their heads; Frankland did not hide his head, he held it up. And further, the Archbishops of Canterbury and York particularly objected to Frankland's enterprise, because they said, this man is teaching " university learning." (Applause.) That is to say he was not establishing a seminary for the concoction of clergy, but he was offering to those who wished to be free—free from entrance tests and from exit tests ; tests when you go to College, tests when you take a degree—• he wanted to place within reach, in the North of England, of such as desired this, parallel advantages to those which were enjoyed already in Oxford and Cambridge. If is said—I wish it could be proved, but I am afraid it is only one of those noble hearsays which we all like to believe—it is said that Frank- land had once been designated by Cromwell " chief of men," as vice-chancellor of that Durham University which was projected but scarcely begun. At any rate, he had not been engaged in his voluntary academical labours above two years, when the ministers in the North saw the grandeur of this work "which was going on, and took measures to support it. Why did they not do this before 1 Because, two years after Frankland began, came the momentary pause of Indul¬ gence, and you good people in Manchester held your first ordination. You did not hold it writh open doors, I believe, but still you held it; and the ministers in the North there assembled thought of what Frankland was doing at Rathmell, and they sent him the good word of encouragement and God speed. Now, Frankland was a Presbyterian. Frankland was nothing if not</page><page sequence="29">27 Calvinistic. The only book we know him to have printed was a little book against Socinianism. When Oliver Heywood complained that one of Frank- laud's students, in declaring his faith at his ordination, was prolix, Frankland shook his head, and said it was well God had raised up young men to be so well armed on the points in controversy with Arminians, Socinians, and others. That was the man's own mind ; but, Presbyterian as he was, I look at the list of his divinity students, and I find that for some time he had none studying with him but Independents, among them being sons of Independent ministers. His very first student, a layman, was the son of an Episcopalian baronet. He claimed for all who went to him the liberty of a broad platform. And I find this very curious circumstance, that, Calvinistic as he was, when the Presbyterians and Independents came together, and drew up and subscribed their Heads of Agreement, Frankland was the only man in the North who saw objections. Oliver Heywrood says that his objections were " over-ruled;" Ralph Thoresby says that his objections were " unanswered." That shows where he took his stand, a free man, holding strong views, and bringing up a generation of free men as strong thinkers. (Applause.) His Academy went about from place to place ; it had six migrations in all. You may recollect that number of six, because our College has run its course, holding a unity of being, through six successive Academies, separately named. Among these migrations of Frankland's Academy it did once come into Lancashire, for a short time. It came to a place which, with the help of Mr. Sutton, the Chief Librarian of your Reference Library, I have been able to identify as Hart Barrow. The next time you are at Lake Windermere, you may make an excur¬ sion to a little manor house in the vicinity of the lower part of the lake, a spot very safe indeed from the orieration of the spies who went about searching whether there were any ministers hi hiding, having incurred the penalties of the Five Mile Act; that was one of the places to which Frank- land transplanted what was called the Northern Academy. At this Academy he educated 304 students, lay and clerical. I suppose perhaps the most distinguished of them was William Tong, the biographer of Matthew Henry. But you Lancashire and Cheshire ministers, if you consult your old records, and look up, among the lists of your predecessors, not the first names, not the names of the ejected, but the names next to them, ten to one you will find that they were Frankland's pupils. Frankland left no heir male, but he left as his spiritual heir, his pupil, John Chorlton. Chorlton was a young man, comparatively speaking, when Frankland died, Ho was only 33. He wras settled here in Manchester, and he was chosen to preach Frankland's funeral sermon. Then he</page><page sequence="30">28 thought he must carrj on Frankland's work. He finished Fraiikland's pupils and took others of his own. That was the first Manchester Academy, opened in 1698 and closed in 1712. There came a time when Chorlton wanted an assistant. Now, in his most admirable and interesting account of Cross-street Charjel, Sir Thomas Baker tells us that the Cross-street congregation came within an ace of having for their minister Thomas Bradbury. But he does not say who Bradbury was. He was the man who devoted himself to giving a sharp doctrinal edge to the line of division between the people who had been one in the Happy Union. It was mainly through the persistent efforts of Tom Bradbury that Nonconformists of the last century came to be generally distin¬ guished as Presbyterian and moderate, Independent and stiff. If it had not been James Coningham who came here, instead of Thomas Bradbury who declined, I do not think, Mr. Mayor, that you would have had Mr. Steinthal sitting at your elbow this evening-—there might have been an Independent minister. (Hear, hear, and applause.) Well, James Coninghani came, and when Chorlton died, Coiiinghain kept up the Academy. Coninghani, I think, was not quite so strong a man as Frankland ; he could not bear to be prosecuted every year, so he went away to London. He gave up the work of the Academy. However, the work was not given up, though he gave it up. It went then to Whitehaven, where it was carried on under Thomas Dixon, doctor of medicine and "prince of theologians." But, before wo go to Whitehaven, let me say that there was an Academy, very closely connected with Frankland's, yet which is not in our list; and we do not want it there. Frankland's last movement was from Attercliffe, near Sheffield. (Applause.) Ay, but wait. At Attercliffe, near Sheffield, there was a minister by the name of Jollie. That minister was not a Presbyterian, but an Independent, and he said, "Frankland, my old master, has gone to Rathniell, so I will still keep up an Academy here, parallel with his;" and he kept it up, I am bound to say, fairly well. He educated that sturdy liberal Benjamin Grosvenor, as well as the reactionist Tom Bradbury; and he began to educate Archbishop Seeker. But he made this ride : " No mathematics in this institution; mathematics tend to scepticism." (Laughter.) So it proved; there was a strong tendency to scepticism as to that paiticular tutor's absolute wisdom. (Applause.) Jollie's pupils did as their tutor bade them in other respects, 1 have no doubt, but, quietly amongst them¬ selves, they ground away at mathematics, and one of them, Nicholas Saunderson, though blind almost from birth, actually became Professor of Mathematics in the University of Cambridge. (Applause.) Now, as I said, we do not want that Academy in our list; I mention it because one may get a better idea of</page><page sequence="31">29 white, by comparing it with whitey brown. We claim the inheritance of the pure white light; neither of mathematics nor of scepticism are we in the least afraid. (Loud applause.) Thomas Dixon, whose Academy followed Chorlton and Coningham's first Manchester one, was called " prince of theologians," and that is nearly all we know about his theological abilities, save that he turned out good men. He made John Taylor, the Hebraist; he made Benson, the biblical critic; and he made Winder, of Liverpool, who wrote a history of the world and of universal knowledge—and that is something. (Applause and laughter.) Thomas Dixon, after bringing the Academy with him from Whitehaven to Lan¬ cashire again, at Bolton, passed away in 1729. Then came a break ; and I must explain and account for that break, or else my proof of our succession will not be complete. There were at that time hi existence two Academies; one very popular among Presbyterians, that at Findern, in Derbyshire, begun by Hill and continued by Latham; and the other was started by no less a divine than Dr. Doddridge, of whom I can hardly say what he was. He was educated, as wo have recently learned from Mr. Jeremy, by aid of a grant from the Presbyterian Fund; he is generally reckoned among Independents; but I believe he was one of those rare souls in whom the Happy Union was a veritable reality. Now, as Doddridge had begun his Academy in 1729, the very year hi which Dixon died, and as Latham was going on at Findern, I supjiose the men of the North thought they would give a clear field to these two Academies, and see if they would supply their wants. It appears they did not exactly supply their wants; not even Doddridge's did. Accordingly, in 1733, at Kendal, the Northern Academy was again set up by Caleb Rotheram, a pupil of Dixon, Dixon himself being a pupil of Chorlton. The lineal succession is perfect. It is not merely Academy after Academy, but it is Academy out of Academy. Caleb Rotheram, at Kendal, conducted his Academy for nearly 20 years, and hi the course of those nearly 20 years he educated 56 divinity students, and 120 lay students. The man of greatest name among his divinity students was George Walker, afterwards scien¬ tific tutor in Warrington, and theological tutor in Manchester Academies; but the most influential, though not the best known men, were the two John Seddons. I have been told this evening, by a friend, that he can help me to disentangle these two John Seddons. It is marvellous how they keep constantly treacling on each others steps ; and they seem to have inherited the tangle, for each, I believe, wTas John Sccldon, son of Peter Seddon. This much I know ; there Avas John Seddon, of Cross-street, Manchester, the first who preached what they called Socinianism; and John Soddon, of Warrington, who does not seem to have preached anything in particular, but who made the Warrington Academy.</page><page sequence="32">30 Observe that in passing on to Warrington Academy we again stride over a few years. Findem got another chance, for Findern was still going on ; the pupils whom Latham had left unfinished went to Findern. And, meanwhile, a great variety of questions were agitating the Lancashire and Cheshire Presbyterians. They must have an Academical Institution in the North. Where should it be 1 What should it be 1 All those four previous stages of the Northern Academy had been private enterprises. Frankland had assistants of his own choosing; Chorlton also had assistance ; and Rotheram had assistants ; but Frankland, Chorltou, Dixon, Rotheram, were personally and solely responsible for the Academies which they headed and maintained and took about with them. Now for the first time, it was not an Academy brought to a man, but a man brought to an Academy. Warrington was chosen as the place, after some heart-burnings between Liverpool and Manchester, who looked at each other with almost as loving eyes as they sometimes do in this century. (Laughter.) They chose Warrington, for its central position, and also because John Seddon was there, and was determined to have it there So, on the 24th October, 1757, they started. Hear a few words from their prospectus. Noble are the words from the prospectus of the Manchester Academy, reprinted on the summons to this meeting, and true is the reference to Warrington which appears in that prospectus ; but let us see what the model is which Manchester followed :— " This Academy, like all other places of public education, will be open to all persons,"—the Manchester prospectus only says, " young men" (laughter and applause)—" and calculated to serve the interests of literature in general; yet regard will bo had, and proper encouragement given to those students who are designed for the Ministry." You see they took Frankland's plan. The University idea was the basal idea, the plan of " literature in general"; and hence they appealed with confidence to "all the friends of religion, liberty, and learning." And here is one of their regulations : the students were to attend worship " either at the Established Church or such separate congregations as their parents and friends shall appoint." That is the breadth of their basis at Warrington. Of Warrington we have already heard an admirable characterisation this afternoon. I "will simply add that I find it was pretty cheaply conducted, although the trustees then, as some trustees now, grumbled occasionally at what they had to spend. When they finished up— and they did not formally dissolve till 1786, nor till the Manchester Academy had already come into existence as the successor to Warrington—they found that they had spent altogether, bursaries and buildings and every other outlay, £17,994. It looks a big sum, but for that they had educated 393 students;</page><page sequence="33">31 and, if my arithmetic is correct, that is an average of £45. 18s. 8^d. per student. I think that will do. (Applause and laughter.) Lot me express, as coming from the right side of the Channel—-(laughter)—the great debt that we in Ireland owe to Warrington Academy. Warrington Academy gave us, perhaps, the richest bishop who ever sat on the Irish bench, Nathaniel Alexander. This is not the debt; nor do I refer to the fact that Warrington Academy helped to cultivate the mind of Archibald Hamilton Rowan. But Warrington gave us Dr. Bruce. (Hear, hear.) Ulster Presbyterian divines had contracted in the Universities of Scotland a custom of thinking in; Bruce brought to Ireland, fiom Warrington, the bolder habit of speaking out; and that made all the difference. I venture to say, but for that circumstance, we should not, humanly speaking, have had a separate body of liberal Presbyterians in Ireland at this day. Well, now, we come to the sixth in the list of our Academies, that which was originally called Manchester Academy, then Manchester Academy, York, then Manchester College, York, then Manchester New College, and now Manchester New College, London. I am not going to say anything about that. Many of you know a great deal more of it than I do. Only let me hope that I have done something to substantiate my thesis, that we did not begin only one hundred years ago, that we have roots farther back in the past. And the moral of this history appears to me to be twofold. The history may clear up misconceptions of far greater importance than miscon¬ ceptions about a mere date. Shall we say that this our College is a denomi¬ national, or shall we say that it is an undenominational institution 1 We may say both, and wre may say both with equal justice, but not precisely in the same sense. This is a denominational College in the sense that from the first it has been projected, manned, maintained, has been furnished with the succes¬ sive chiefs of its teaching staff, and has been provided as regards its finance, by one special religious community. Whatever name belongs of right to that religious community, belongs of equal right to this College, its characteristic child. It was with sound insight that Calamy, the historian of the founders and fathers of our community, grouped them round the venerable figure of Baxter, a man who would take no denominational title except that of Non¬ conformist alone; and we may remember that John Taylor, probably the greatest original theologian of our own manufacture, in the last century, when he opened his new meeting house in Norwich, said that he and his people abandoned Presbyterian, Independent, Arian, Trinitarian—all these titles—to rank themselves exclusively under the simple denomination Christian. Whether we choose this name or that, let us remember what sort of a denomination it is,</page><page sequence="34">32 under whose influence this College has thriven and grown. It is a denomina¬ tion to which one may be proud to belong, one which I think has ever endea¬ voured to pursue that method which Frankland's biographer tells us was successful in his case. " He had a thriving congregation," says Calamy; and because he dealt with them in " candour and humility, gravity and piety," they dwelt in harmony, " notwithstanding the differing principles they wrere of." Now, Mr. Mayor, in another sense this our College is certainly unde¬ nominational, unlimited even to what we are glad to think to be the broadest of the denominations. We cannot call it either Presbyterian or Uni¬ tarian exclusively, inasmuch as it has always welcomed with open heart and hand students of every religious body. So it was in Frankland's time; so it was at Warrington; so at Kendal; so at Manchester. I think the name which stands second on the roll of divinity students of Manchester College is that of one who is specified as a student of " Divinity in the Church." That addition shows that, in the sense of extending more than a transient hospitality to those whose views may differ very widely from the cherished convictions entertained by its founders, this College rightly claims to be an undenominational institution. As we look back upon its history, we may feel a deepening reverence for the men who made it, and for the men whom it has made ; and we may trust that in the years to come, as they roll forward, God may continue to help his servants to guide the fortunes of an institution which connects the frank religious fearlessness of the early clays of Nonconformity with the frank, fearless religiousness of this preseut time (Applause.) Attached to the shield of arms of Richard Frankland is a noble motto, which the heirs of Franklancl's work might well adopt as their own, Libera terra, Uherqiie animus ; that is to say, Be the spirit of oui College so liberal, frank and large, as ever to justify its place in this land " where, girt with friends or foes, a man may speak the thing he will," and where, hi consequence, " freedom broadens slowly down, from rirecedent to precedent." The Rev. Dr. Drummond, who was warmly cheered on rising, said: Mr. Mayor, my Fathers and Brethren in the studies of Manchester New College, and all Friends of the College who are here assembled,—Mr. Gordon, in his most interesting narrative, has traced the pedigree of our College from days which, in some respects, we cannot but call days of dark and sanguinary super¬ stition ; and I think the result of that narrative ought to be to brace up all our hearts afresh, to fill them with thankfulness that such great victories have been won in the cause of religious liberty, and to strengthen our resolution to hold fast those great privileges which we have inherited, and to hand them down</page><page sequence="35">33 untarnished to our successors. (Applause.) I have been asked to undertake, this evening, the difficult task—a task rendered doubly difficult by the noble sermon which we listened to this afternoon—of setting before you, in outline, the fundamental principle of that life which has pervaded the Nonconformist Academies whose heirs we are, and which I trust animates us at this day. Mr. Beard was obliged to remind you that this was a thrice-told tale, and if I fall into some unavoidable repetition in touching once more upon this great theme so closely connected with our meeting, I am sure you will pardon me, and will not feel distressed in having your minds once more turned to this important and stirring subject. (Hear, hear.) Now, in forming an estimate of the life and function of Manchester New College, I think it is clear that we must go beyond the exclusive characteristics of our own Academies, and we must to some extent consider those qualities which we should find in all well-constituted Colleges. All Colleges aim at learning; we aim at learning under certain distinctive methods. But I think we may certainly affirm that the primary end in the foundation of the old Academies and of our own College, was not to become the representatives of any speculative principle, but, under the pressure of a practical necessity, to provide a solid University education for gentlemen who were excluded by the unjust intolerance of ancient times from the so-called National Universities; and therefore it has all along been the endeavour of the managers of the College to provide the very highest education which it was possible for our students to accept. Happily the time has come when the National Universities are no longer closed against any deserving students; and other Colleges besides our own have been founded upon a large and popular basis, so that the necessity out of which the Nonconformist Academies sprang has, to a large extent, passed away; and conse¬ quently in our own College wre no longer retain the complete University curriculum, but have handed over the arts training to a College which has larger support and an ampler number of students than it is possible for us to have or to share in except by association with some more frequented institution. But, in making provision for our undergraduates, wo have not forgotten the claims of learning. We still desire that they should come to us fully equipped University men, that they should study mathematics—which, as we heard just now, were laid under a ban hi one of the Academies—as well as all other topics on which men of large and liberal culture are expected to be informed. In recent years we have even succeeded in sending a certain number of students, largely under their own choice, to Oxford and Cambridge; and for my ow7n part, I hope that this larger association with the. life of our country may become increasingly open</page><page sequence="36">34 to our students, and that when they come to us to receive their special theological training, they will bring into our smaller circle something of that larger and more cosmopolitan life, of that greater width of thought and more extended sympathy, which men acquire amid the associations of a great national institution. (Applause.) Returning, however, to the interior life of our own College, we are now distinctively a Theological College, and in Theology it always has been and still is our endeavour to give the highest and most scholarly training which it is possible to provide within the limits of time at our disposal. A slight conflict occasion¬ ally arises from the apparently dual end which necessarily exists in a Theological College. As communicators of learning, we think only of learning, and of training men to be good theologians; but as practically engaged in the work of life, as having before us young men who are intending to enter the Christian ministry, and who have not always the highest taste for scholarship, although they may have a profound love for their fellow-men and excellent qualifications for useful practical work, we are obliged to admit a different order of consideration. Having, then, these two ends in view, we occasionally find that there is some little conflict between them; and sometimes it is asked by those who are outside as well as inside the College, " What is the use of the variety of subjects and of the minute detail which we lay before our students?" My first reply to that must be, that I think we are falling into a complete misconception when we ask what is the use of learning % I maintain that the intellectual impulse is an original impulse in our nature, and that the gratifi¬ cation of it is an end and not a means. (Applause.) We seek learning because it is learning ; and we desire to know. (Hear, hear.) That should always be our primary end; and we should never be led astray from this by side issues. Where there is any subject which is really worthy of the human understanding, where there is any great topic of thought on which it is possible for us, by careful and patient research, to throw light, then, if we have properly constituted intellects, we shall spare no pains to reach a true result; and we shall be anxious to train our students to reach for themselves true results upon all those high subjects of inquiry. (Applause.) But, at the same time, we may look at learning in another light; and we shall find that it does possess its uses. Glancing, first, at the present state of opinion, do we not all know how unsettled the minds of men are becoming; what an agony of doubt numbers of men have gone through, and are going through at this present time; how difficult they are finding it to remain upon the old lines, and how, as those old lines fade away from their sight, the great spiritual</page><page sequence="37">35 realities which they represented are also fading, and they are entering the conflict of life with cold and desolate hearts, and without a chart to mark their way For these men it is of most material use if you are able to give them such highly-trained intelligence, and such wide and true information, that they will be able for themselves to wrestle with their difficulties, and at last to trace out new lines of thought, and reconstitute in their belief the spiritual realities by which men have to live. (Applause.) It is largely through learning that great public revolutions in religious opinion have taken place, and the disintegration of the lower has been succeeded by the construction of the higher faith; and it is surely the duty of a Theological College to provide its students with such equipment that they can take their place in the onward march of thought, and help their brethren in the conflicts of the time. And, in the mind of the individual student, how rich are the rewards of careful labour! How often is it the case that, under the simple impulse of his conscientious sense of duty, he toils through what may seem at first some dry and dreary study, but at last, in the midst of the desert, he comes upon some verdant oasis where there are flowers of truth and waters of life with which his mind is refreshed, and which he could never have reached if he had declined the previous toil and weariness. Or he may seem to be climbing up some steep ascent, through a tangled thicket; he sees little of the way before him; he sees nothing of the world around him ; and he knows not whither his efforts are tending ; but at last he rises out of the thicket and finds himself on the top of some luminous peak, and he looks abroad over the great world, and feels that the glorious prospect confers upon him an almost infinite reward for the small pains and trouble that he has endured. (Applause.) But if we are thus to seek truth for ourselves; if we are thus to toil through these weary paths in hope of our great reward, then we must be left in our freedom—(hear, hear)—freedom from all outward restraints. We must have no fear of being expelled from our College if we do not share the current thought; we must have no fear that we shall be looked down upon by our fellows because we follow our conscience; wo must have no fear—and we must feel that no bribe is held out to tempt us—if we painfully struggle on hi our lonely path, heedless whether any will follow7, anxious only to be allowed for ourselves to behold the beauty of God. (Applause.) This freedom, accord¬ ingly, is extended in Manchester New College to Teachers and Students alike. Let me briefly explain the grounds on which our policy is based. In the first place, we recognise a fact which is patent to all candid minds that in theological questions there actually exists a very wide variety of opinion,</page><page sequence="38">36 and it is impossible for us any longer, with any feeling of honesty, to pretend that all the sincerity and all the godliness are on one side, and that there is nothing but the perversity of intellectual pride and heretical self-will on the other. We see that men are in earnest in their varying opinions, and accordingly wre must leave the field open; and we feel that the only chance which the human mind has in this, as in all other subjects, of finally reaching the truth, is to be allowed to put forth all its powers unchecked by any interfer¬ ence from men—checked only by devotion to the God of truth, and by that conscience which forbids us to tamper with any doubt or to acce23t any conclusion till we have sincerely and humbly tested it. And then there is another fact which we observe. It is this—that Theology grows. (Hear, hear.) The Churches have for centuries been fighting against this truth. They say Theology does not grow : it has been given once for all as a sacred deposit, which the Church has simply to preserve. But has the Church preserved it 1 It puts forward the claim of a changeless infallibility. What is the consequence 1 Is it that Christendom is united at this day, and that " all who profess and call themselves Christians," and " love the Lord Jesus Christ in sincerity," are agreed upon the same dogmas 1 On the contrary, Christendom is divided into East and West; Western Christendom is divided into Romanist and Protestant; Protestant Christendom is divided into sects without number; and all their striving to fetter the natural action of men's minds, to stay the growth of theological opinion, has simply shattered the unity of Christendom—but it has not sufficed to tie down the free-born mind of man. (Applause.) Again, setting this aside, we recognise the fact that other knowledge has grown, and Theology, even if it were unchangeable in itself, yet necessarily must change its relations to the surrounding "world. You cannot place even Roman Catholic Theology in the same relation to science now that you could three or four centuries ago. Catholics as well as Protestants have to accept the Copernican astronomy, and many of the truths of geology; and although the Church has to some extent (though I think this point has been greatly exaggerated) opposed the advance of science, still it has been obliged to accept this advance; and, consequently, Theology has to observe its relations to surrounding studies, and to place itself under new7 conditions; and the accom¬ plishment of this requires a progressive teaching of Theology itself, and free minds in order to readjust those relations. But I think there is one other point which has always been clearly recog¬ nised at our College, and which, to my mind, is perhaps even more important</page><page sequence="39">37 than those on which I have touched. It is this—that no man ever attains to the deepest religious faith unless he holds some truth which he has won for himself, and which therefore comes home with its whole power and meaning to his own mind and heart. (Hear, hear.) We all know that it is quite possible for men to accept with passive minds certain religious truths which are laid before them. They say that they believe them. They would be scandalised with the utterance of men who declared they did not believe them. But where is the proof of their faith Examine their lives; examine the principles by which they are really animated; examine how far they are self-denying; how far they are filled with love to their fellow-men, and are ready to lay clown upon the altar of conscience and of duty all their worldly advantages and privileges; and then too often you see that these accepted dogmas have never entered into their faith—- they have only lain in their minds as a dead body of truth, but have never quickened them, and caused their souls to rise up out of their grave and enter into the kindling life of Christ. (Applause.) And so I say that the freedom of our College exists in order that we may win men to faith. And it has won men to faith. We do not all agree with one another. We hold our differing opinions; and we recognise the fact that, in the imperfect constitution of our intelligence, we must hold differing opinions; and, while we gaze upon the infinite truth, it must present itself in varying forms to our dimly-seeing niirids. But what then Supposing we have seen, however imperfectly, the form of truth for ourselves, and that it has filled our minds with a sense of its power and beauty; and supposing we have bowed down and worshipped before it; what if we are not all intellectually agreed 1 is there not faith there % and are we not more truly brothers while we kneel before these majestic forms of truth, presented so variously to our varying sight, and in the same spirit are prepared to surrender ourselves to them, and to obey the behest of duty wheresoever it may call us, than if, without this kindling spirit, we simply muttered over the same creed and worshipped at the same shrine (Applause.) Now, if this be so, does it not follow that however uncertain we may be in regard to the precise form of religious truth, still w7e do believe that there are deep and vital truths for men to know71 And is it not one object of our College to find and to teach these truths 1 It certainly seems to me that it is so, and that part of our intellectual work is to shape for the present day, so far as we can, the form in which men can reasonably hold their religion We do not seek merely to communicate methods of study and useful information. As teachers, I cannot think that we should be worthy of our post if we had no thought-out conclusions of our own ; and if, while we laid varying opinions</page><page sequence="40">38 before the young men who came to listen to us, we did not try as judges to sum up the evidence, and tell them how it appeared to us. That is, accord¬ ingly, our practice in every subject which we study. Of course, in so acting, we oblige no man to agree or to pretend to agree with us. We are pleased when students show signs of original thought, and when they are able to correct or supplement the thought of their professor. We do not wish to find our own lectures parroted in the answers of the examination room. We like to see that the mind of the student has been at work, that he has thought out his subjects, and has reached his own conclusions; but still, as I have said, as teachers, speaking to men younger than ourselves, it is our duty, so far as we can, to help our students to arrive at their conclusions. This principle I must apply even to what is ordinarily called religious doctrine. The minds of men are deeply agitated on questions of religious doctrine at the present day. They are feeling that the old forms have changed. What shall they have in their place 1 It is surely one of the foremost duties of a Theological College (and especially of one in which the teachers are expected to keep their minds freely open to the growing light of knowledge) to try to shape the thought of each succeeding age, to determine the form of doctrine which seems the truest now, and to cherish this,—as we cherish truths in other departments of study,— as representing to us, until we become better informed, those great truths which we hope sometime to see more clearly. But you may ask: If this be so, then why do you not at once formulate your body of doctrine, and impose it as a test, both upon your teachers and your students 1 I will give two answers. The first is, that common sense and common honour are infinitely better securities against any kind of abuse than any form of subscription or test that human ingenuity has ever devised. (Applause.) We know only too well at the present day how easy men find it to put their names to creeds which they do not half believe. We want nothing of this kind ; we want no half beliefs; we w7ant sound and whole beliefs. Another reason is that we cannot make any real or safe distinction amongst truths, and say that this truth is vital, and that truth is unimportant. (Hear, hear.) I know not where to draw the line. Every truth must be of value, but the truth which is of value to each man can be determined only by his own mental constitution, and by his own spiritual experience ; and although there may be a large body of truth which it would be desirable for us all to hold, still, as I have already said, that alone w7ill be quickening, and lead men on towards a fairer and better life, which they have realised for themselves, and hold fast with the tenacity of personal conviction,</page><page sequence="41">39 It is the truth, or even the half truth, which a man really believes that to him is vital; to another man it may be some other truth, or half truth; but, I believe, that no truth of God, though it be small as a grain of mustard seed, can dwell within a man's breast without its growing there, and shooting forth its branches, and at last spreading its shade over the whole of his mental being. Therefore, we welcome all students, to whatsoever denomination they may belong, or whatsoever may be their convictions, provided they can honestly say, " we have a religious conviction, and we come with a reverent desire to learn, with an anxiety to approach nearer to the truth of God, and to lay upon his altar the offering of our intellectual and spiritual powers." In fine, the lesson which our fundamental principle teaches to every one of us is simply this—that we still know in part, but when that which is perfect has come, then that which is in part will be done away. And as we all move along our converging lines towards the central light, we shall also be approaching one another; and we shall be animated by the same wonderful hope that the time shall come when we shall see, face to face, and know even as we are know7n, and when the whole fraternity of man shall be bound together, not only (as, amongst small groups of us, it is now7) in the unity of the Spirit, but also in the unity of truth. (Applause.) The Rev. Charles Hargrove, who was received with much applause, said: Mr. Mayor, Ladies and Gentlemen,—At an anti-slavery meeting of old times, more effective than any of the most eloquent appeals, used to be the putting forward of an escaped slave w7ho might tell of his experiences and his sufferings, and so enable born freemen to appreciate the advantages of the freedom which they had always enjoyed and got accustomed to. It is somewhat upon that principle, I suppose, that I have been put forward to support this resolution,— I, who am bound to Manchester New7 College by no debt of gratitude, as others are, and by no tie of loyalty to an alma mater, I who have known, as few of you can have known, what it is to study Theology under restrictions as to the conclu¬ sions at which I might arrive. I have known what it was to read and study my Bible in fear lest the text should disclose to me some proposition which was contrary to " the faith." I have know7n what it was to argue, trying to be fair and truthful, but always bearing in mind that my argument must end in one conclusion, and in no other. I have known what it was to silence argument because I saw that, if I ventured further, I might arrive at a conclusion which would be wrong, and therefore "mortal sin." So, perhaps, I am a fit person to support a resolution in favour of the freedom of Theological teaching. There is much to be said on this behalf; and it has been said, nearly all already, that I could have said, I shall make bold to do what might be foolish presumption if</page><page sequence="42">40 it came from myself alone—to offer some advice, both to the professors of Manchester New College and to you all, on the ground not of my own private opinion or experience, but of the words of the first Principal of the College, which I read the other night. These words are from a sermon preached by Dr. Barnes, 100 years ago. " Of all subjects," he said, " divinity seems most to demand the aid of kindred, and even of apparently remote sciences. Its objects are God and man, and nothing which can either illustrate the perfec¬ tions of God, or the nature, capacities, and history of man, can be entirely unimportant to the student of Theology. (Hear, hear.) But how extensive a field do these subjects open? Natural philosophy, in its evident sense, comprehending wdiatever relates to the history or properties of the works of nature in the earth, air, or ocean, has an immediate reference to the one; and to the other belong all that anatomy and physiology can discover relating to the body, and all that metaphysics, moral philosophy, history, or revelation declare concerning the mind." And then he goes on to sketch out such a programme of studies as might appal the student beginning his course, and abash the man imagining himself to be a proficient; and he concludes : " But the peculiar and favourite studies of the clergyman should be those which more immediately belong to his own profession. To this all their studies should ever be sub¬ ordinate ; the central point to which all their pursuits should converge, and by which they should be continually directed, ought undoubtedly to be the knowledge of the Nero Testament. This is to be what medicine is to the physician or navi¬ gation to the sailor, his first and greatest object. Other studies may be of advantage to embellish the column, to compose its foliage, or adorn its capital; but this must constitute its strength." I confess to you, ladies and gentlemen, when I read those words I was inclined to rebel against them. It seemed to me a little narrow7—a little old-fashioned'—this making the New Testament, one particular book of religion, the most important and central study. I was inclined to say that the successors of Dr. Barnes, in this age, would substitute for the New Testament the study of the philosophy or history of religion in general, and of all sacred books. It wanted but a night's reflection from me to confess that I had been in error, and to see that this old-fashioned divine was indeed in the right. I have a friend who has been engaged for many years in the study of the cockroach. (Laughter.) I trust within a A7ery few months that w7e shall have upon that subject a book from his pen which will tell us about it, what he has discovered, facts new and strange, and not insignificant in meaning. In this connection you smile, and certainly there is no harm in a smile; but I venture to say that no man of science will sneer at such a subject; and less still will any</page><page sequence="43">41 man of religion, any man Avho reverences God as present in all his Avorks, sneer at such a devotion. I confess for my part that I have shuddered as he has told me of some of the marvels of construction found in that " black beetle," at which I have often shuddered for quite other reasons. But, gentlemen, Avhat I complain of is this— that while it is thought perfectly right and useful that a man of great learning and great ability should devote years of his life to the study of the cockroach, the study of the New Testament is considered to be one which is rather beloAV a man of science, Avhich is only fit for " ecclesiastically-minded " men, of narrow learning, and small abilities. " The only science of mankind is man," Avrote the poet long ago, and corrected it into " The proper study of mankind is man." Be it one or the other, and the Avorld seems to have accepted both, for these lines have become a common Avord in the mouths of all; Avhether you take it that the only science Avhich concerns each and all men is knoAvledge of human nature; or that man's proper study, the study to Avhich, above all others and befoie all other things, he ought to devote himself, is himself—I say that this the NeAv Testament vindicates to itself—the study of all men. (Hear, hear.) For Avhat is the NeAv Testament? I do not plead for it as if it Avere a supernatural and divine revelation. If it be that, I should be inclined to say that there is no other study Avhich ought ever to engross our attention, and that AA7hich is purely human and purely natural could, beside the divine and supernatural, only take so utterly inferior a place that Ave should look upon it Avith something akin to contempt. But I take the NeAv Testament, in its very lowest aspect, as being that Avhich undeniably it is, the earliest record we have of a religion Avhich has been the most potent, the most Avide-spread of any religion that has been developed during the history of man¬ kind. (Applause.) And I say that the development of that religion, the development of it Avhich must be studied above all in the NeAv Testament, is a subject worthy of the highest and deepest study, and one which can only be studied to serious purpose by those Avho are free as you are. Take one instance in illustration of my argument. One gospel there is amongst the four Avhich stands out from amongst the others Avith an individuality of its OAvn that the others have not, Avith a loftier tone, Avith a peculiar doctrine. Who Avas the author of that gospel, Avhat its history and purpose is, Avhat its authority in and place in the development of Christian doctrine,— surely such questions are Avorthy of all attention. And, ladies and gentlemen, the matter concerns us all. Religion is not something, like any other science, which a certain number of men may usurp as their oavii province, and say, " This is our hobby ; leave it alone if you like." The geologist may say, " I am</page><page sequence="44">42 interested in geology; you are not. Well and good; I will study it, you leave it alone." There is no professor of theology avIio can so treat his subject. Religion it is Avhich is common to all, and that which concerns religion ought to be the study of every man and of every woman as a central fact of human nature, even if no objective reality correspond to it. But take this subject, then, of the fourth gospel; in Avhat spirit should Ave approach it For its proper study we require learning, Ave require piety, Ave require judg¬ ment ; and these three things it Avere absurd if Ave were to claim as if they were our OAvn, as if Manchester New College had a monopoly of judgment, and piety, and learning; or as if we had that to some large extent that others have not. Gladly, thankfully, Ave acknOAvledge that throughout the Avhole Church these are to be found, and that men who are magnificent in their ability and in their learning have applied themselves to this study and have given us most valuable result; but in one respect only have Ave the advantage over all others, and it is in that respect which makes all their labours of com¬ paratively small account, for Ave are free and they are not. Others come to the study of this gospel, bound to the conclusion beforehand, that .the gospel is the Avork of the Apostle John; that the gospel is in its teaching distinctly Trinitarian, and opposed both to Arianism and Unitarianism; bound to accept it as an historic, and as to some extent more or less, as an inspired and in¬ fallible work, Approaching the study so fettered, they may learn much and teach us much; but hi regard to Avhat is most important as bearing upon the fundamental questions concerned, their conclusions can be of absolutely no value. Men may bring to it all the science of Theology they possess, all the Avits and Avisdom of Avhich they are possessed; but, inas¬ much as the conclusion is a foregone one; inasmuch as they 'start, before the study, Avith the conclusion at which they Avould arrive, all their learning counts for nothing. Their judgment, hoAvever sound, is unexercised; and their piety can only be good to increase my piety, not to help me to a safe conclusion. We only can come to such a study—Ave, professors or students of the science of Theology in the Manchester NeAv College, Ave minis¬ ters and members of free churches,—absolutely unbiassed, free to find in this fourth gospel as in all the NeAv Testament, the doctrines Avhich Ave ourselves disapprove—the Trinitarian ism, if it be there, of the Athanasian creed—the Arianism of Dr. Barnes, or the Unitarianism of Priestley, or the Pantheism of Spinoza—Ave only approach it as men of science approach the object of their science, simply to study it Avith all the aids of learning, in order to discover the truth, Avelcome or unAvelconic, favourable to our preconceived</page><page sequence="45">43 theories or unfavourable. And, therefore, not merely from the point of vieAV of one Avho has the post hoav of minister of one of those Presbyterian churches to Avhich Manchester NeAv College OAves the freedom it possesses, but also as one Avho desires simply to knoAv the truth, be it Avhat it may—for him or against him—and particularly as concerns the NeAv Testament; as one who desires the progress of true religion amongst us; as one who believes that the proper study of mankind is man, and, therefore, that the properest study is the noblest, greatest, most influential religion humanity has ever had, I cordially support this resolution, A\7hich re-affirms, after one hundred years, that Avhich Dr. Barnes affirmed in his first sermon preached at the opening of Manchester NeAv College, that this our temple of learning is dedicated " to truth, to religion, and to liberty." (Applause.) The resolution Avas then put to the meeting, and carried unanimously. The Mayor then left the Chair, and it Avas taken by Mr. Benjamin Heape, Avho called upon Mr. Darbishire to move a resolution. Mr. R. D. Darbishire said: Mr. Chairman, Ladies, and Gentlemen,—It is unfortunate that in this Manchester New College meeting Ave should not have had the speeches of some laymen. Laymen have always been amongst the foremost of the administrators of this College since it was founded. For a long time there Avere laymen in it. We might have heard a speech from an old student, Mr. Robert Philips, had he been Avell enough to come—(hear, hear)— and we might have had, in his accents, a reneAval of our thoughts of another son of our College, Mr. Mark Philips's, Avhose bold Nonconformity, Avhose ever- courageous avowal of opinions which in his clay Avere thought to be discreditable, or even disgraceful, then shut men out of society. It seems that Ave have changed this, to some extent, already; but none of us, Avho Avere fortunate enough to have been brought up under the influence of speeches such as Mr. Mark Philips, and others of his class Avere accustomed to address to us in our meetings, can forget Avhat the teaching of Manchester New College Avas to the laymen of our earlier years in this district. (Hear, hear.) I might go doAvn through our lists. I see before me the Fielclens, the Turners, the Worthing- tons, the Robberdses—all names deeply honoured in our memories. I can call to mind more recent associates,—Mr. Russell Scott Taylor, a dear fellow-student of my oavu, to Avhom the Manchester Guardian OAved much of its later elevation, and the renewal of its influence;—Mr. Richard H. Hutton, for many years the editor of The Spectator, avIio has passed out from amongst our particular communion, but Avho still retains a loyal admiration for the principles of the College and a faithful respect for the</page><page sequence="46">44 opinions of others. (Hear, hear.) I might challenge in his presence another able felloAv-student of my oavii, to Avhom you Avho have read the Guardian for the last thirty or forty years, OAve many debts of gratitude for culture and enlightenment,—Mr. Henry M. Acton; and there is also Mr. F. Harrison Hill, Avho has edited the Daily News for many years, and Avho for a long period edited the Belfast Northern Whig. These are laymen who learnt in Manchester New College independent service, and have done it Avell. I must plead for more than memories. I must plead, in the presence of the governors of the College, and of its friends and supporters, that laymen might have still again the advantage of culture amongst those Avho are designed for the ministry. To me it is the secret of the reason AA7hy Ave have not more laymen to speak to us to¬ night, that by some unfaithfulness of our oavu we have allowed the influence on our young laymen to pass out of our hands ; and we are not now careful that our sons should learn interest and accurate thought and full knoAvledgein the higher matters of the Manchester College courses; that they should learn the inspiration which comes of a habit of reA7erent training under such leaders as its Professors ; of intimate relationships Avith the men of dedication, old and young, the fathers and the brothers of their rising life, just at the time when they are passing from school into life. We have not, as a College, done our duty by our laymen, and, therefore, Ave feel the Avant of them iioav; and you have no better layman to speak to you to-night than one whose Avhole work is that of the scribe and not speaking. But I have been forgetting myself in a vieAV of things in Avhich I take the deepest interest. I rose, Ladies and Gentlemen, to tender, hi the name of the College, in the absence of Mr. Lupton, our late President, who is exceedingly sorry not to be here to-night, our very sincere thanks to the Mayor of Manchester, for his genial courtesy, and for his personal attention in the conduct of this meeting, and for his most liberal hospitality. Mr. Goldschmidt is an old friend of ours, and of every good Avork in this toA\7n ; and it is a pleasure to have the opportunity of offering to him, in the name of the College, and of ourselves, his guests, our heartiest acknoAvledgments. (Applause.) Mr. David Martineau (London) seconded the resolution as one of the London members of the Committee of the College, and on behalf of friends from long distances. The vote of thanks Avas carried by acclamation. The Mayor, in responding, said : I assure you, Ladies and Gentlemen, the remarks of our friend, Mr. Darbishire, Avent straight to my heart. I am one of the laymen avIio cannot speak—(laughter)—but still I believe that I can do some good to the cause, even though I may not be able to do much in the</page><page sequence="47">45 Avay of speaking. (Hear, hear, and applause.) We have had to-night an intellectual feast which Avill last us for many a day; and it is to those gentlemen Avho have provided that intellectual feast that your thanks and mine are due. I regret very much the shortcoming in the earlier part of the evening. It Avas, hoAvever, I assure you, not exactly my fault. Only two hours before six o'clock I Avas informed that there Avould be 250 or 300 guests. Well, Avhen I mention that, instead of that, there are some 500 or 600, I am sure you Avill exonerate me from all blame. (Applause.) Well, gentlemen, for another reason, no thanks are clue to me. I assure you I am proud to be here this evening, and to have presided over such a gathering. (Applause.) My thanks are due to you for your attendance, and the good feeling you have shown towards me. (Applause.) This concluded the proceedings, and the company dispersed.</page><page sequence="48">THE VISION OF FAITH. " And Jacob awaked out of his sleep, and he said, ' Surely the Lord is in this place : and I knew it not.' And he was afraid, and said, ' How dreadful is this place This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven.'"—Geiwsis xxviii., 16, 17. Two points of the highest interest in connection Avith the history of religion seem to be fully established by modern research, namely, the permanence of religious belief, and the mutability and growth of the forms through Avhich it is expressed. Formerly, men supposed that there must have been a primitive revelation, and as, in speaking of revelation, they thought only of the perfect Giver, they assumed that it must have been absolute truth, and that all the subsequent errors of men Avere mere corruptions of pristine knowledge. We are noAV learning to see that in every case of revelation Ave must consider the recipient as Avell as the giver, and that the revealing thought of God, though always pointing toAvards absolute truth, may yet sloAvly unfold itself in the human mind, and clothe itself in transient forms such as the intelligence of successive ages may be able to grasp. In order to illustrate this position, Ave need not travel beyond the pages of the Bible. If, Avith open mind, Ave compare the idea of God in the early chapters of Genesis with the saying that " God is Spirit, and they that Avorship him must worship him in spirit and in truth," do Ave not feel that the tAvo conceptions are separated by an immea¬ surable gulf, and that the latter has reached a sublimity and comprehensive¬ ness Avhich Avould have been quite unintelligible to the rude nomads of earlier times 1 Indeed, Ave know that it AA7as too exalted for the mass of men even at the time when it Avas uttered, and that the Christians, with their assertion of a universal Spirit before Avhom all partial and local gocls must disappear, Avere regarded by the populace as atheists. But Avas there, then, no revelation in the loAver vieAv, and are avc to say that, because it Avas mingled with error, it contained no Avord of God, and spoke Avith no awful and uplifting tone to those avIio gazed Avith the inqiming eyes of an infant race upon this mysterious</page><page sequence="49">47 Avorld 1 Was it not, then, true that God Avalked among the trees or whispered in the evening gale, or stretched his boAv upon the cloud, or confounded the devices of arrogance and guilt, simply because his presence and his righteous¬ ness could not be understood unless they Avere exhibited to the imagination in an anthropomorphic dress? If the conscience Avas aAved, if the spirit AA7as subdued and elevated; if there Avas a glimpse of something higher than the vulgar thought of every clay, then can Ave not trace the Spirit of God throAving gleams of revealing light upon the objects of nature and the hearts of men The story of Jacob's dream affords a beautiful illustration of these remarks. Whether Ave regard it as history or as poetry, it sIioavs Iioav men are led by the experiences of life into secret, often unexpected, converse A\7ith God, and receive visions and revelations of the Lord Avhich lift them to a higher level, though at the same time these revelations IIoav doAvn into the moulds of the accustomed thought. Jacob had been driven forth, through his plotting selfishness, an exile from his father's home. As he trudged on alone, the sun set, and he lay down beneath the angel-stars that Avatched over him, thinking not of God, or perhaps supposing that he had left him behind in the old settlement, and bent only on getting such comfort as he could for his Aveary limbs from a bed of stone. But as he slept, he dreamed, and the higher soul awoke Avithin him. He felt, as never before, that God was Avith him, and the stirrings of a Avonderful and world-Avide destiny began to beat in his heart Avith the poAver of a divine promise, " In thee and in thy seed shall all the families of the earth be blessed." Surely this A\7as a moment of revealing, a flash of light breaking through, though it could not AA7holly disperse, the limiting mists that hung around the patriarch's mind. He Avas filled with dread as unfamiliar tones fell upon his inward ear, and troops of angels seemed to pass betAveen him and heaven. Yet in that first lonely conference Avith God his old character appears, and, instead of surrender¬ ing himself Avith a glow of self-renouncing love, like his descendant Paul in ansAver to another vision, he tried to make a bargain with the new-found leader of his destiny. He kneAv iioav that in some mysterious Avay God could attend the steps of the Avanderer, but he could not yet shake his thought free from the limiting conditions of place and time, and he transferred to God Avhat Avas true only of his OAvn experience. To him the hour and the spot must for ever remain sacred; but he fancied that the sacredness was really in the place, that God Avas there rather than elseAvhere, and perceived not that the gate of heaven Av'as Avithin him, that the house of God Avas his own soul, and that the angels of God ascended and descended, not upon special portions of the earth, but upon the son of man. Centuries had to roll aAvay Avhile knoAvledge sloAvly greAv and</page><page sequence="50">48 thoitght climbed to greater heights, before the truth could be uttered and believed, "Neither in this mountain nor in Jerusalem shall men Avorship the Father;" God " is above all, and through all, and in all." It is curious Iioav the limited notions of ancient times have lingered on in popular teaching, and a rude anthropomorphism Avhich for centuries, I might almost say for thousands of years, has been quite foreign to cultivated theology, too often passes current as a part of Christian doctrine. I cannot but think that much of modern scepticism, and especially among scientific men, has sprung from this source, and is due not so much to the perversity and nariwviiess of theologians, as to the popular ignorance of theology. It is quite touching some¬ times to read an account of the purely pagan conceptions which have been fostered in childhood, and abandoned in later life at the bidding of science, sometimes in exchange for the higher thought of Christianity, sometimes for blank denial, or a doubt that Avill not venture to return an answer to its oAvn questionings. It is true that God is spoken of as infinite, but he is often con¬ ceived as finite, and pictured in the mind as a colossal man, Avho, from some fixed position, presides over the Avell-contrived machinery of the miiverse. The empty thought of the infinite makes less impression on the imagination than measured magnitudes of vast dimensions; and Avhen science loosens the stable earth and sends it rolling as a tiny ball in the midst of a universe where the imagination can only faint in prostrate helplessness, the most colossal man fades from the mind as an inadequate dream, and our Bethel ajopears too mean and trivial to hold the undiscovered cause of all. Yet, if Ave are Avise, Ave shall reject only the limiting forms of our ignorance, and retain the positive truths Avhich Ave had reached. The stones of the moimtain, the silent gleam of stars, are not less sacred because Ave cannot go from the spirit Avhich they enshrine, or flee from the presence Avhich smiles upon our Aveariness and sIioavs us the Avay of duty. To me, Avhose happy lot it Avas to be trained in a more spiritual school, and Avho never, so far as I can remember, thought of God as in the human or any other shape, or as carrying out his designs by the external art of a statuary or a mechanic, it has seemed all along that science, Avhile modifying subordinate details, has been confirming step by step the highest vatici¬ nations of religion. For Avhat has religion taught through the noblest forms, first of JeAvish and then of Christian theology Is it not that God is the infinite Spirit, the one ground and source of all things, the pervading force that fills every part and holds the Avhole together in a connected system, and that thus the universe is an expression of his eternal reason Has, then, science discovered that there are several dis-</page><page sequence="51">49 cordant universes governed by conflicting forces and incompatible designs? Has it proved that the world is without law, and dominated by the caprice of chance And has it enabled the human mind to acquiesce in a panorama of empty and ever-shifting phenomena, which are connected by no rational bond, and express nothing permanent behind them Quite the contrary. Whether we cast our eye over the realms of space, or imagination, guided by the torch of science, gropes its Avay back into the dim eternity behind us, Ave meet AA'ith groAA7ing evidences of unity and order. It Avas a magnificent generalisation Avhich extended the laAV of the falling stone to the moon and the planets; but the astronomer has forced his Avay still further, and research only confirms the suspicion that gravitation is universal, and that the teeming multitudes of stars are all moving in obedience to the same comprehensive rule. What a marvellous sensitiveness of mutual sympathy and dependence is thus imparted to the whole system of things. We cannot take a step without sending a tremor, infinitesimal it may be, but quite real, from star to star. Then Iioav Avonderfully are wre all folded in the same light. It has of course been always known, though its significance has not been fully appreciated, that light reaches us across the stellar spaces. We are thus brought into actual con¬ tact AA7ith bodies Avhich are separated from us by countless millions of miles, and Ave perceive that one of the most familiar facts of earth belongs no less to the most distant heavens,—or shall Ave not say "belonged," for some of the Avavelets that Avill break upon our eyes on the next starry night set out on their journey hundreds, perhaps thousands, of years ago; and through all the intervening space they have tossed their crests as they rolled on with incon¬ ceivable velocity. Taking advantage of some of the laAVS of this light, men have pushed their researches further, and inquired into the chemical composition of sun and stars; and so far Ave have reason to believe that the chemistry of those distant masses is the same as the chemistry of the earth. When Ave turn to Avhat I may call the antiquities of science, Ave find the same truth. The records of the past condition of our globe have been to a certain extent un¬ folded through the prior assumption that the laws AAdiieh exist now existed formerly, and Ave accept speculations Avhich it is impossible for us to verify, on the ground that this is a reasonable assumption, and that the conclusions to which it leads present us with a coherent and rational system, which it is possible for the mind to accept with satisfaction. In all this, then, has science banished God, and sIioavii us that everything is common and profane No ; it is enabling us to rise from our grovelling paganism into the grandeur of ancient faith, and to lift up eyes of adoration that are filled with an unspeakable aAve</page><page sequence="52">50 and Avonder. This is precisely AA7hat our hearts have said, and Ave feel all the more how holy is this place, how holy is this universe, Avrapt in the eternal thought of God, and showing forth in every part his changeless Avill. In all this, science is but proving through its oavii methods of observation Avhat was long ago asserted on the a priori ground of the unity of God, confirmed even then by such knoAvledge of nature as had been gained. To cite only one instance, listen to the statements of Philo the JeAV. He says, in his OAvn figurative Avay, that equality, the mother of justice, has ordered all things Avell, things in heaven and things on earth, by immovable laAvs and ordinances ; that there is an invisible bond of unity by Avhich the parts, locally separated, are joined in one; there is an everlasting laAv Avhich stretches from the centre to the circumference and from the extremities to the centre, constituting a bond of the universe that cannot be broken; the cosmos is like a vast city, with its well-ordered government and duly subordinated authorities, with one polity and one laAv, and it Avas so constituted that it might be a perfect Avork, Avorthy of the Creator.* Thus, then, Jacob's dream has only burst its limits, and everywhere the angels troop to and fro, on the Avings of the morning or in the pomp of sunset splendours, in the heaving ocean, the slowly crumbling moun¬ tain, the sighing forest, or the Avaves of light that tremble in solemn silence from the midnight sky; and Ave need only pure hearts and ears to hear their joyful hymn, " Heaven and earth are full of the glory of God." But there is another testimony beside that Avhich has been slowly Avrung from nature by persevering investigation. It was not through study of the surrounding scene, but through retreat into his oavii lonely heart, that Jacob discovered the presence of God; and to this day it is only Avhen we meet God in the still chambers of the conscience and the spirit that Ave are drawn to him with the gloAv of personal trust and love. Before the unmeasured vastness of nature Ave are stricken almost Avith dismay, and, overwhelmed Avith a sense of our insignificance, Ave cry that Ave can knoAv nothing of a Being infinitely trans¬ cending our thought, and Ave recognise naught but mystery, a poAver too remote and impenetrable for us even to dare to Avorship. But Avhen AA7e retreat into the smaller Avorld Avithin, Ave find that God is no less there than in the bound¬ less magnificence of the sky. In truth small and great belong only to the relations of our thought, and have no existence for Him. The sun and the dewdrop are shaped by the same laAv, and not a sparroAv falls Avithout the impulse of the same force that determines the SAveep of stars. And so our * These statements are taken from various passages in his works.</page><page sequence="53">51 relative insignificance cannot cut us off from God. A human brain is as won¬ derful and mysterious as a solar system, and we are not only encompassed but interpenetrated with that divine poAver Avhich throbs in the light of constella¬ tions, and through millions of years has cooled and shaped the fiery globe into this fair earth on Avhich Ave live. " Surely the Lord is in this place," and it is no longer strange or incredible if, on entering the fields of consciousness, we recognise the presence of a Spirit higher than our ow7n, printing unchanging laAvs upon our minds, and revealing a righteousness, and holiness, and love, which, except to the aAvakened soul of poetry, the cataract and the storm have never chanted, and AA7hose voice is dumb amid the music of the spheres. These, Avith the persistence of their inward light, Avith their heavenly beauty, and their calm authoritative command, are as truly an expression of the eternal Spirit as gravitation is of the eternal PoAver. Before these we are in presence of the light Avhich has struggled Avith the darkness of men since the chvwn of human history, Avhich has flashed in the minds of prophets and chvelt with serene constancy in Christ, Avhich has shone like stars in great and beautiful souls, and comes, as Avith the descending footsteps of angels, to you and me, bringing tender words of divine promise and entreaty. And now Ave dare to Avorship, and to pour out our hearts to the God of our lives. Such, I think, is the abiding witness of God Avhen Ave calmly Avait upon his Avill. But amid the multitude of outward things we are apt to become oppressed and worried; our sun sets, and drowsiness falls upon our higher nature. Our spiritual life, accordingly, is exposed to fluctuations ; and there are times Avhen Ave hear the divine voice more distinctly, or are even startled, like Jacob, to find that Ave have been sleeping beside the gate of heaven. We may glance at one or two of these occasions. The consciousness of sin is an enduring element of religious experience, and calls forth the Avords of confession and the prayer for pardon. But gene¬ rally it slumbers, as it Avere, in the background of our feeling, and only iioav and then, Avhether through some more heinous lapse or simply from an aAvakening of conscience to the ever present facts, it starts forth and Avrings the heart Avith a sense of ill-desert in presence of violated laAv. Then Ave fling aAvay the conven¬ tional pleas that have flattered us AA7ith lies, and in lonely anguish Ave hear the verdict of the holy and omniscient God. Oh, Avell for us then if we accept our shame Avith no sense of mortified vanity, but Avith pure sorrow for the irrevoc¬ able wrong, and seek for renewal, not that Ave may strut about in the pride of righteousness, but that Ave may do God's will with a holy simplicity of mind. To this confession and prayer Iioav wonderful the answer, Feeling ourselves cut</page><page sequence="54">52 off by our unworthiness from all approach to the divine love, lo! we dis¬ cover the mystery of love, Avhich never stands aloof, but takes our poor wounded hearts, and asks only for our trust. And then Ave grasp our pilgrim staff again, and go on our Avay in humility and peace. Again, theie are times Avhen the inward voice seems clearly to call us to an unexpected duty. It is not that our ordinary faculties of judgment are suspended, or that we are led blindly in a way which our judgment does not approve, but that Ave see a new and trying duty Avhich no one else sees for us, and which we could avoid without any blame from our felloAv-men. Such perceptions come to us in our higher moods, and Ave feel that Ave pass behind the veil, and commune with God. We accept the duty from Him, and commit ourselves, for its accom¬ plishment, to his power and love. It has been in obedience to such calls that the triumphant march of human progress has been accomplished. The Avorldling has laughed Avhile the martyr has bled; but the Avorld's guilt and wrong have been battered and shaken by men who listened to the iiiAvard voice, and Avere not disobedient to the heavenly vision. And still the Avorld's hope is in those who watch for more angelic tones than the shallow scoff of an unspiritual knoAV- ledge, and, counting not their lives dear unto themselves, turn into a duty Avhat- ever God may speak to their solitary conscience. The emotions, then, that gloAved in the heart of Jacob are not extinct, like some cold volcano, the forlorn witness of a hot and strenuous past; rather have they burst their bounds and poured their Avarm blessing upon all the families of the earth. Our vision has Avidened into immensity; our feeling of God's pre¬ sence has lost its exclusiveness. Of him, and through him, and to him are all things; and wheresoever we may be Ave may still exclaim, " Surely the Lord is in this place," "This is none other but the house of God, and this is the gate of heaven."</page><page sequence="55">FREE TEACHING AND FREE LEARNING IN 1786. A DISCOURSE DELIVERED AT THE COMMENCEMENT MANCHESTER ACADEMY. SEPTEMBER XIV., MDCCLXXXVI. BY THOMAS BARNES, D.D</page><page sequence="56"></page><page sequence="57">A DISCOURSE. Gentlemen, IT is not easy to imagine a higher object than that which has given occa¬ sion to your present meeting. You have established a Seminary of liberal education ; and you Avish to celebrate its commencement Avith a public testimony of honour and affection. From an intimate knowledge of the motives Avhich have given birth to this Institution, I Avill venture with full confidence to assert, that it is not merely the ardour often felt, in sanguine spirits, upon the opening of a new7 scheme, Avhich has inspired your zeal and drawn together an assembly so numerous and respectable. You have thus far acted, and you Avill continue to act, in this important business, under a strong conviction of the greatness of the end you have in vieAA7, and under the impulse of warm and generous feelings for the best interests of mankind. These interests, in their highest and most extensive sense, you consider as in no small degree concerned in the prosperity of a scheme, the avoAved aim of which is to hold out the advantages of Liberal Education to the several orders of civil society. Every motive which can connect you with the rising genera¬ tion will here come into vigorous action. Are you members of the Great Community of mankind Are you, as Britons, anxious for the preservation of your liberties and laws Are you, as Parents, still more tenderly united to those Avhose happiness is dearer to you than your life 1 Are you, in a still higher character, as Christians, affected for the honour of Religion and the good of immortal souls ?—What object can appear to you so great, so moment¬ ous, as education Upon what occasion will you feel an interest so strong, as Avhen you are thus called to sanction by your presence, and to support by your exertions, an Institution which you have established, Avith the hope that it Avill contribute to convey the blessings of knoAvledge, of liberty, and of religion, to your felloAv-men, to your fellow-citizens, to your families, to generations yet unborn</page><page sequence="58">56 Respecting the influence of education in forming the minds and manners of men, there can be, among men of reason, but one sentiment. He Avho shall affect to consider it as having little poAver must be among the Aveakest, and he who is indifferent to the application of that poAver, must be among the worst of men. We deny not the original differences of minds, as they come from the hand of the Creator ; but Ave contend that the far deeper and bolder lines of distinction are draw7n by early culture. This position it will not be necessary to prove by serious argument. You acknowledge, you feel its truth. A feAV splendid instances may perhaps be found of those avIio, in spite of every seeming disadvantage, have risen to eminence in wisdom and goodness. And, alas too many sad examples evince that those who have apparently been surrounded with every means of mental cultivation may be ignorant and abandoned. But perhaps even these instances, if fairly examined, would not be found to contradict, so strongly as may at first appear, our general principle. Or, if they be Avithout examination admitted as glaring exceptions, hoAV feAV are they in comparison Avith those which establish, Avith evidence Avhich nothing can oppose, the plastic nature of education, and its influence in stamping upon the mind its present, its everlasting character But if it be unnecessary to prove this sentiment, it may not be an useless entertainment to turn our eyes for a feAV moments to some striking instances, by which it is illustrated. To Avhat cause but Education shall Ave ascribe that peculiar cast and air, by which the several orders of society are so strongly marked, and Avhich, by combin¬ ing Avith the uniformity of common nature and national resemblance the varieties of peculiar and professional character, agreeably diversify the scenes of culti¬ vated life, and constitute at once its beauty and its enjoyment But perhaps the illustration may appear to greater advantage in still larger bodies of men. To Avhat other influence shall Ave ascribe that national character, Avhich is more or less visibly impressed upon every country; but most strongly upon those Avhich, having less intercourse Avith other nations, are left open to the iminterrupted operation of those causes by Avhich human nature is affected Observe the abject servility of men educated under the debasements of despotism or superstition! Contrast Avith this the manly spirit of those who have been born under the auspices of freedom and of reason. Survey the same country in different periods of its history. Turn your eye to ancient Greece, the seat of liberty, the nurse of arts, the theatre of glory. Compare these char¬ acters Avith those by which it is iioav degraded. To what cause do you, my countrymen, 0AA7e that high-born spirit, that</page><page sequence="59">57 generous scorn of servitude, Avhich animate your bosoms, by Avhich your isle has been so long distinguished, and by Avhich it has been rendered the abode of arts, of commerce, of science, and of happiness Is it to your soil, to your climate, or to any skyey influence, that you OAve this spirit But other countries, under the same sky, and Avith external circumstances nearly similar to your OAvn, are marked Avith a far different character. No, you have been educated in Britain, and you have from your earliest infancy imbibed that noble invigorating spirit. It has been infused and cherished by the conversation, the writings, the manners of those around you; by the monuments of your ancestors, by their history, by their anniversaries ; till at length the sacred principle has pervaded all your soul, and has stamped upon you a distinguishing, an indelible impression—an impression Avhich you are solicitous to convey to your posterity; and which they, under the same influence, Avill hand down, as a glorious entail, to future generations. I have been led to this illustration by the nature of the plan which you are noAv establishing. Educated in the principles of liberty, civil and religious, and deeming those principles essential to every higher interest of man, you have Avished to form a Seminary of Education, Avhich shall breathe the same spirit, and Avhich shall thus serve, hi the most effectual manner, the cause of truth and goodness. Hence, you have formed your institution upon the most liberal and generous basis, guarded by no jealous subscriptions, and open Avithout suspicion or fear to all Avho Avish to enjoy the advantages of science unfettered and free. You regard ittts your duty, you demand it as your birthright, you glory in it as your privilege, to judge for yourselves on every subject of Science, and above all of Religion, and to act according to your oavii convictions; you consider the Great Head of the Christian Church as the sole lawgiver and judge of men ; you appeal to his Avord, as the only infallible standard of divine truth; and you Avorship the Father of spirits according to the dictates of your own conscience. Upon these broad and noble principles you maintain the cause of religious freedom. With the calmness and temper, but at the same time with the firmness and constancy becoming such principles, you stand fast in this honourable cause; a cause for which the best blood of your countrymen has been shed; a cause which it is real glory to defend; and from Avhich none can shrink Avithout cowardice and infamy. Yours is not the cause of any party. You rank yourselves under no distinguishing name. The liberty Avhich you claim for yourselves you extend Avith equal latitude to others. The burden to Avhich you Avill not submit you will never impose. You plead for the equal, universal dominion of reason, of conscience, and of truth. To these great</page><page sequence="60">58 interests alone you consecrate this Seminary. If these be promoted your first, your highest hope Avill be accomplished. Education at large, considered Avith respect to its general objects, plan, and influence, opens too Avide a field for our present investigation.* The advantages of liberal education upon the principles already mentioned, to young men destined for the several departments of superior life—I mean for those departments Avhich are raised above the drudgery of servile labour—will afford ample scope for our present consideration, and will, I assure myself, engage, because it will so Avell deserve, your serious attention. I shall not be mistaken in the object I have here proposed—I shall not be understood by any person as Avishing to exclude the poorest and lowest of man¬ kind from the blessings of knowledge. The principles before asserted respecting the native privileges and equal liberty of all men will prevent any such inter pretation. AAvay for ever with the ungenerous thought of dooming so large a portion of the human race to darkness It can be the Avish of none but of the abject friends of despotism and superstition—and in them it is consistent. May success attend every Avell-ineaning endeavour to diffuse important Avisdom through every order of the community, and to bless the cottages of the poor Avith those illuminations of truth and righteousness, by Avhich poverty may be cheered and labour SAveetened, by which human nature may be ennobled and immortal happiness extended. But Liberal Education, upon the scale Ave have before us, cannot possibly be enjoyed by all. It can only reach to those Avhose time and fortune and future prospects give them leisure, ability, and incitement to the acquisition. In your printed report! you have professed your intention to be, " To " establish a plan affording a full and systematic course of education for " divines—and preparatory instructions for the other learned professions— "as well as for civil and commercial life." Let us pursue this division. And let us consider attentively the importance of such provision as you are iioav making for the education of divines—for those intended for the professions of medicine and laav—and for those Avho are to fill up the offices of civil and commercial life. 1.—For the Education of Divines. The usefulness of an order of men devoted to the interests of religion 110 rational friend of those interests will call in question. By the Christian, who * For a judicious discussion of many of these points, see Dr. Kippis's excellent sermon in favour of the New Academical Institution at London. t See the Appendix No. I. containing the Report of the tuustees.</page><page sequence="61">59 derives his faith from the NeAv Testament, it Avill in general be immediately acknowledged; for this order of men is there appointed. But, upon the prin¬ ciples Ave have already maintained, it is of unspeakable importance to the interests of religion that those Avho are to be the assertors of its truth, the guardians of its purity, and, under God, the instruments of its poAver, shall feel its noblest influence upon themselves, that they shall study its doctrines free from the control of human decision and authority, and that they shall Avith all simplicity follow wherever truth and reason point the way. If the cause of Christian liberty be dear and valuable in your esteem, you must regard the education of your ministers in the principles of liberty as proportionably im¬ portant ; for upon them Avill the support of that cause, I had almost said, principally depend. Nor Avill I retract the Avord. For where have we knoAvn that cause to flourish, in any respectable degree, where it has not enjoyed the patronage of wise and able advocates in the sacred profession What character in life is more truly venerable in every church and among every denomination than that of a serious, active, consistent Clergyman Where have Ave knoAvn any of this description who has not enjoyed general respect and honour, Avho has not been numbered among the truest friends of all that should be clear to man You will bear with my honest triumph upon this subject. With pride and pleasure I magnify my office. If it has not, among us, Avhat to many would appear to be the highest recommendations of a profession, the rich emoluments, the splendid titles, -the sacerdotal dignities, Avhich are elsewhere to be found, it has all that Christianity bestoAved in its first and purest age ; it has all that can endear and ennoble it to a Avell-disposed mind ; it has the opportunity of dis¬ pensing inestimable blessings to mankind; and it has in general annexed to it the frugal competence and the unbought honour Avhich to a good mind are SAveet and sufficient. In every situation of life the first and greatest object of education is the discipline and formation of the heart. The noblest character we can sustain is that of the offspring of God. To please him is our highest duty. To be approved by him is our only happiness. To this grand point, then, should the education of every person, Avhatever be his rank or destination in future life, be primarily, and in all its stages continually, directed. Without Piety, all the accomplish¬ ments of manners, all the attainments of science, and, if Ave may be alloAved that expression, all the recommendations of loAver excellences, and even of secondary virtues, would be of little avail. The firmest guard of good principles, the richest source of true happiness, the fairest ornament of elevated character, and, I will add, the necessary meetness for future felicity, would be Avauting.</page><page sequence="62">60 If this be true of all persons of every rank and office, it is still more true of those who are destined for the sacred function. To them the spirit of religion is necessary to every end of their profession, to respect, to enjoyment, to useful¬ ness. Destitute of this divine principle, Avhere shall they find motives sufficient to animate or to SAveeten their labours Duty will be a toil, and devotion a drudgery. Their conversation Avill Avant the seasonings of goodness. And the coldness of every service they perform will chill those better affections Avhich it Avas their part to have kindled and kept alive in the bosoms of their audience. But Piety alone, however sincere, hoAvever fervent, Avill not insure to a Minister of Religion respectability or success. It must be regulated and assisted by knoAvledge; and it will be fashioned as to its complexion and form in no small degree by the kind and extent of that knoAvleclge w7ith which it is attended. Let us not despise well meaning ignorance. Let us do honour to the rude but honest effusions of a sincere heart. But in the Public Teacher of Religion you justly expect a furniture, a cultivation of mind sufficient to add lustre to his other treasures, and to qualify him to be not only a burning but a shining light in the sanctuary of God. Upon this subject there will be among us no difference of opinion. That a Christian Minister should be possessed of Avisdom, as Avell as of worth, none here Avill call in question. With those avIio decry human learning we decline all controversy. Their reason is obvious. Illiterate themselves, Avhy should we Avonder if, like the Vandals of old, they endeavour to destroy all the monuments and honours of literature in others. Nor will Ave seriously attempt to combat those Avretched sophistries of super¬ stition, or those miserable abuses of scripture, by which they attempt to defend a sentiment so degrading to human nature, to its great Author, and to Him Avho came into the Avorld that he might enlighten and bless the nations. It is, then, a point of great importance to provide for students in Divinity among us the means of various knowledge, and to open to them the stores of ancient and modern literature. Of these none Avill be Avithout its use, and they Avill all unite their influence in enlarging, polishing, and strengthening the mind, and in qualifying it for a better acquaintance Avith its peculiar and professional studies. For it is Avith me a point of unquestionable truth that a good acquaintance Avith general science is useful, not only in giving vigour by the variety, pleasure by the resemblance, and advantage by the contrast of different subjects, but even hi illustrating, explaining, and applying those sub¬ jects Avhich by our profession Ave are called upon peculiarly to cultivate. Of all subjects divinity seems most to demand the aid of kindred and even of apparently remoter sciences Its objects are God and man, and nothing Avhich</page><page sequence="63">61 can illustrate the perfections of the one, or the nature, capacities, and history of the other, can be entirely unimportant. But how extensive a field do these subjects open Natural Philosophy, in its Avidest sense, comprehending Avhatever relates to the history or properties of the works of Nature in the Earth, the Air, the Ocean, and including Natural History, Chemistry, &amp;c, has an immediate reference to the one ; and to the other belong all that Anatomy and Physiology can discover relating to the body, and all"that Metaphysics, Moral Philosophy, History, or Revelation declare con¬ cerning the mind. But here again the field still opens upon us. For History, as Avell as Revelation, demands the knoAvleclge of Languages; and these, again, of Customs and of Arts, of Chronology and Manners—the stream of science still branching out into more and Avider channels. And to the highest finishing of the mind are necessary those subjects Avhich belong to cultivated Taste, Avhich regulate the Imagination and refine the Feelings, and Avhich give correctness to vigour and eloquence to strength. Of all this various range of science, let us not imagine that any part is improper or Avithout its use. Every part may with great advantage join its influence in forming the accomplished and useful Minister of Religion. It is, indeed, not only a truth, but a truth of unspeakable importance, that the peculiar and favourite studies of a Clergyman should be those Avhich more immediately belong to his profession. To these, all other studies should ever be subordinate. The central point, to Avhich all other pursuits should verge, and by Avhich they should be continually directed, ought undoubtedly to be the knowledge of the New Testament. This is to be Avhat Medicine is to the Physician, or Navigation to the Sailor, his first and greatest object. Other studies may be of advantage to embellish the column, to compose its foliage, or to adorn its capital; but this must constitute its strength. In a finished edifice, it is to be Avished that the shaft of the column may be strong, and that its ornaments may be beautiful. Education, upon such a scale as Ave have noAv imagined, demands the aid of numerous and distant sciences ; none of Avhich can be omitted Avithout narroAv- ing, in some degree, a system Avhich, to be perfect, ought to be as various, as extensive, and as full as possible. To this plan of education for Divines, different objections Avill probably be made. Some will mention the time and the expense necessary in passing round so large a circle.—And if the object Avere to make our student an adept in vaiious sciences, at once a profound Mathematician, a deep Civilian, and an able Chemist, the objection Avould be strong; for any one of these would singly</page><page sequence="64">62 require more time and attention than a Clerical student can spare from more necessary studies. But that more general acquaintance, for Avhich alone Ave plead, and Avhich is sufficient for all the purposes above-mentioned, will be attained Avith comparative ease by a young man, such as alone Ave Avish to find intended for the sacred function, regular, diligent, serious, and frugal of his time. To render the expenses of such an education easy to young men of narrow fortunes, but of promising genius and dispositions, is one great object of your Seminary—an object which, by the generous exertions of the friends of religion and good learning, you will, I doubt not, be able in a good degree to accomplish. But there is another and, in the opinion of some, a much stronger objec¬ tion against the plan Ave have chalked out. A taste for knoAvledge thus diver¬ sified and improved Avill, they apprehend, induce a turn and habit of mind little accommodated to those situations into Avhich so many Ministers among us must necessarily be cast in future life. I feel the force of this difficulty; and if this effect did necessarily folloAV from this cause, the objection Avould be insur¬ mountable. For Avhatever tends to unfit the Ministers of Religion for the most obscure and unlettered congregation, or even for a comparatively hmited and scanty emolument, so far defeats the great purpose of their office, and renders them, at once, useless and unhappy. But I am not staggered by this objection. For if the spirit of Religion, the humble, self-denying, active spirit of Christianity, be but strongly felt, this effect Avill not folloAV. Where the refinements of taste have been kept in clue subordination to the piety of the heart, Avhere the sense of duty, the love of God, and its amiable offspring, the warm desire of doing good to men, have been kept alive, as the first and strongest passions of the soul, this inconvenience cannot exist. In the most private situation, such a mind ayouIc! find opportuni¬ ties both for mental cultivation and for active exertion, and from both these for exalted self-enjoyment. Let him but once consider it as his highest honour to serve God and his generation faithfully in Avhatever situation Providence may have placed him—let him but be persuaded that the minds, even of the plainest people, are susceptible of the noblest culture and improvement—let him, under this impression, so far overlook the coarseness of unpolished manners, as to receive, Avith pleasure, the sterling sentiments of honest nature, in their rudest dress—in one Avord, let him but enter upon his office Avith this principle, if called into a desert, to cultivate and adorn it as much as possible, to step beyond the common and meagre forms of public service, to associate Avith his hearers, by prudent condescension to inspire their love, tempered Avith that dignity Avhich shall command respect—let him but do this, and I will pledge myself for the</page><page sequence="65">63 consequences. He Avill find, in the plainest of his people, minds possessed of great and generous sentiments, and capable, like the diamond, of being polished into amiable excellence. If many Clergymen in such situations are disgusted and unhappy, if in consequence they become indolent and useless, let us not ascribe their com¬ plaints entirely to their situation. If they are dissatisfied Avithout the delicacies and the elegancies of life, if they sigh for luxurious ease and literary refine¬ ment, surely they forget—alas it is to be feared they have never properly felt •—the first, the highest end and object of their office. The means of usefulness, and consequently of enjoyment, lie much in our oavii poAver. The Minister of Religion, who endeavours thus to render himself active and estimable in Ms situation, Avhatever it be, Avill secure to himself the purest satisfactions, nor aaoII he Avant respect and honour in some measure proportioned to his exertions and his merit. If silent merit sometimes lie hidden in obscurity, is it not too often because it remains in obscurity and does not speak in those useful energies for Avhich such a person seems to be peculiarly qualified, for Avhich the circum¬ stances of the Avorld so loudly call, for which the Ministerial office was appointed, and from Avhich it is to derive its highest character and consolation here, as Avell as its noblest reAvard hereafter Permit me here to offer a remark concerning the object and influence of education Avith respect to young men of every class, into Avhich I have been led by the preceding observations. One great, perhaps the greatest, excellence of education is to keep up a constant spring and energy of mind, to maintain that brisk and regular move¬ ment of its various poAvers, Avhich shall preserve their current vigorous and clear. On the other hand, perhaps the most fatal error Avhich can be com¬ mitted is to suffer the mind to become lethargic and languid, to lose its tone and spirit, and to stagnate in inactivity and softness. Indolence rusts the most splendid talents, and blunts the edge of the sharpest poAvers. Hoav little has ever been clone for the honour of God and for the good of men by cloistered dullness On the other hand, Avhat has not been achieved by a bold and per¬ severing industry It has supplied the place of fortune, of strength, .of poAver, and even of genius itself; nor is it to say to Avhat sublime attainments of knowledge and of usefulness he may rise who, actuated by a spirit of resolute and patient application in a good cause, suffers nothing to interrupt his progress. Nothing Avill therefore more deserve our serious attention than to make our Seminary a school of diligence, and to keep alive that fervour of the mind Avhicli is necessary as Avell to present improvement as to future eminence, enjoy¬ ment, and usefulness.</page><page sequence="66">64 You Avill excuse this digression. Let us return to our subject. A culti¬ vated taste in the Minister of Religion will not only render his character more respectable, and Avhen united, as it ever ought to be, Avith a devout spirit, his labours more useful in every situation in Avhich he may be placed, but it Avill also furnish him with those means of superior entertainment Avhich are, I had almost said, most necessary to himself at least in the most obscure retirements. Possessed of these, what rich sources of pleasure of the purest kind open to him on every side 1 Nature in all its scenes, and knoAvledge in all its branches, are ever ready to afford solace and gratification. Destitute of these, is there not reason to fear, and Avill not experience justify the apprehension, that he Avill sink down either into languid insipidity, degrading vulgarity, or even into sottish intemperance And hoAv many places are there among us where, without these qualifica¬ tions, the Christian Minister ' could not possibly support, in any respectable degree, the decorum and dignity of his profession? In all our toAvns, and in the greater part of our country congregations, there are families of opvdence and character among Avhich it has long been an honourable and acknowledged distinction that they are eminently sensible of the importance of Liberal Education. In these, therefore, are to be found—long may they deserve the praise!—persons conspicuous for knowledge, for elegance, and for manly character. Among such persons how desirable, Iioav necessary is it that the Minister of Religion be a man of science and cultivation! But let us noAV turn to the second great object Avhich you have professed to have in view in the establishment of your Academical Institution, viz.:— II.—Preparatory Instructions for the other Learned Professions. A scheme of agreeable transition from the elementary principles of a Grammar School to the higher regions of professional science, upon a founda tion generous and large, and affording the means of obtaining liberal knowledge of various kinds, must be of no small importance to those avIio Avish to super¬ add to the faculties either of Medicine or LaAv the advantages of cultivated understanding and improved taste. If the principles already advanced be true, even Professional Studies may be carried on to much greater advantage by him Avho enjoys the previous aid of more general science. His mental poAvers Avill be enlarged and strengthened; he Avill be enabled to appreciate the several parts of learning, and to assign to each their just proportion of respect and value ; he will be furnished with agreeable entertainment for those hours of relaxation Avhich must necessarily intervene in the busiest life. Add to this, that general knowledge rubs off the pedantic rust</page><page sequence="67">65 Avhich naturally adheres to him, Avho is only a man of one book, or of one science, and that it gives ease and dignity to the manners, elegance to the style, liberality to the spirit, compass to the sentiments, and respectability to the conversation. Hoav Avill he appear hi the mixed commerce of the Avorlcl, or bear an honourable part among men of various characters and studies, Avho is only conversant with one of them From the man who is merely the student of a single art, or Avho has only paced round one circle of thought, you may expect a contemptuous disdain of others, a narrow7ness and coarseness both of sentiment and maimers disgusting to men of better judgment, unfriendly to real improvement, and hostile to that harmony of the Sciences in which so much of their strength and symmetry consist. But I am proving an axiom. To enjoy these previous advantages of general knoAvledge before a young man is sent to the Temple or the University, free from those shackles, and at a distance from those clangers AA7ith Avhich the acqui¬ sition is often attended, must appear to every enlightened mind an object of con¬ siderable moment. Those Avho are destined to these learned professions have generally a feAV years to spend in preparatory studies before they are fit to enter upon those of their immediate designation. And the line in Avhich a generous ambition should prompt them to Avish to move in future life demands the polish and assistance of diversified study. If these principles are immediately admitted Avith respect to the Learned Professions, it is possible they may not meet with so easy or general acceptance wdth respect to the third class of young men mentioned in your Report, viz. :— III.—Those who are designed for Civil and Commercial Life. By many gentlemen here present this question has been canvassed in the place where Ave are now assembled ;* and I flatter myself it has been clearly determined. Our debates have indeed chiefly turned upon the advantages of science to those engaged in Commercial Life. That the higher characters of civil society, that the Magistrate, the Senator, the Statesman, that the Gentle¬ man of independent fortune, that he who aspires one day to fill offices of dignity and trust—offices perhaps involving the interests of our Commerce, of our Constitution, of our Religion itself—that such men shall have their minds cultivated by Liberal Science, that they shall be men of large understandings, of good acquaintance with Languages, Avith History, wdth Arts; that they shall be Patrons of Learning; and that, in order to this, they shall have gone through a course of regular scientific education—avIio, for a single moment, Avill make the subject of a question * The place where the Literary and Philosophical Society hold their meetings.</page><page sequence="68">66 And the man of trade—Avhy shall he be doomed to ignorance and in¬ sipidity Why are books to be his aversion, and knowledge his poison Will a taste for letters, beyond Avhat may merely qualify him for the round of mercantile drudgery, disqualify him for business, for success or pleasure in it A severer, a more unjust libel upon commerce could not possibly be uttered. You, gentlemen, know it to be false. You who are, many of you, alone competent to determine this question, have declared in favour of mental cultivation. You know, from your oAvn experience, that to a certain point, a point far beyond the common standard, this cultivation Avill not interfere with any end or object of commercial industry; that, on the con¬ trary, it Avill highly improve and finish the mercantile character. You wish this improvement for your children, in full assurance that it Avill assist their judgment and exalt their vieAvs; that it will be a preservative from the low, debasing pleasures to which, for want of it, they will be exposed ; that it will add Aveight and interest to their characters and counsels; that it Avill provide them sAveet entertainment and consolation in retirement and in old age; and that it will, in every stage and condition of life, render them more amiable, more useful, more happy. For the advantage of this class of my fellow-citizens, I could form in idea, better than I could describe in language, a plan of education Avhich has not perhaps been as yet fully executed, but Avhich, if it could be carried into successful execution, would be a noble addition to the improvement and happi¬ ness of a very numerous and important part of the community, and Avhich Avould confer high honour as Avell as reAvard on him Avho should accomplish it. I imagine to myself a system of education for a commercial man which shall contain all the parts of science proper for him to knoAv as much as possible in a practical form, and Avhich amidst all the other objects of study shall keep this point continually in A7ieAv. In this system the several noble Arts on which Commerce depends are illustrated by their respective Sciences, Avhilst Science again is rendered clear and entertaining by its application to the Arts. Shall young men of every other class have studies and discipline peculiar to them¬ selves, and shall the man of Business, the Merchant, who Avill be called to sustain so very interesting and honourable a character among his fellow7-citizens, be improved by no studies, be formed by no discipline, be trained by no habits Avhich more immediately belong to his future province The present learned and worthy Bishop of Llandaff has lately proposed to introduce Lectures upon Agriculture and Commerce into the Universities. It Avould be some advance toAvards that ideal scheme, the faint and imperfect outline of Avhich imagination has draAvn before me.</page><page sequence="69">67 To these sentiments the College of Arts and Sciences in Manchester owed its origin ;* and to the conviction of its utility impressed upon the minds of some liberal men it has owed its support. From small beginnings it has risen to an established and respectable character. The courses of lectures Avhich are announced for the ensuing Avinter justify our sanguine hopes of its growing- prosperity and success.! From the important nature of the subjects, and from the well-earned reputation of the Preelectors, I assure myself the high expecta¬ tions of the public Avill not be disappointed. The friendly correspondence which subsists between the patrons of that Institution and the supporters of our Academy is a circumstance mutually favourable to both Establishments, and to that Common Cause which gave them birth. By this friendly co-opera¬ tion the circle of studies Avhich young men may attend among us is agreeably enlarged, and opportunities afforded Avhich could not have been equally enjoyed in a single Institution, or in a more confined sphere. These, gentlemen, are the advantages Avhich you wish to secure to your children and to the rising generation around you by the Seminary Avhich you have instituted. And these advantages you Avish them to enjoy free from any sub¬ scriptions, tests, or obligations inconsistent Avith the sacred rights of truth and conscience. It is your ambition to keep alive that delicate uncorrupted sense of rectitude, that pure and holy love of truth, and that simple and inflexible integrity of conscience, which shall be, under God, their firmest guard against Avhatever is base or disingenuous against the authority of power, the allure¬ ments of interest, or the blandishments of seduction. Hence your plan is, agreeably to your principles and your spirit, liberal and open. From the friends of liberality alone you expect support, and such you rejoice to hope are to be found among those AA7hose principles seem to set them at the remotest distance from one another It is pleasing to behold this spirit diffusing itself abroad among the several denominations of our felkw-Christians, giving a softer aspect to those parties AAdiich used to wear only the air of defiance and hostility, and levelling those mounds Avhich have so long, like impassable ram¬ parts, divided felloAV-men, felloAv-eitizens, fellow-christians. To unite mankind together, not by the bonds of ignorance or hypocrisy, but by the cement of an enlightened and diffusive love, this is the spirit of that divine religion in Avhich Ave boast; this is the tendency of those principles by Avhich Ave are distinguished; * For an account of the origin and objects of this Institution, see Memoirs of the Literary and Philosophical Society in Manchester, Vol. II., p. 16. t Upon Anatomy, by Charles White, F.R.S., &amp;c, and his son, Thomas White, M.D., &amp;c. ; and upon Chemistry, by Thomas Henry, P.R.S., assisted by his son, Mr. Thomas Henry, junior.</page><page sequence="70">68 for this is the end and honour of our cause, the cause of civil and religious liberty. Among Avhatever men and by Avhatever means the spirit of freedom, of toleration, and of candour, and in connection Avith these the spirit of virtue and religion are diffused, this Ave consider as the triumph of our interest. Our interest, did I say 1 It is the interest of truth, of righteousness, of heaven An interest Avhich can alone render our separation honourable or important; an interest to support which by steady character, by generous contribution, and if necessary, by patient suffering, confers on human nature its highest glory ; because it produces to man his noblest happiness. To this interest the diffusion of knoAvledge must ever be useful. In an age of darkness Christianity Avas adulterated. In an age of returning light its honours Avere restored. Let imposture shrink from day. Divine truth seeks no concealment. It fears no detection. Sound knowledge of every kind must ultimately befriend it. And it shall prevail. It is even iioav rapidly prevailing. The day has already daAvned. The light of heaven is advancing. The human faculties are in motion. The Religion of the New Testament, Avhich, like a mighty mountain, has been long obscured Avith exhalations, iioav lifts its majestic head, and under the providence of its Author shall rise superior to those clouds by which its glory has been darkened. In every period from that era to which we look back Avith pride and triumph, as exhibiting the noblest spectacle of pure and inflexible virtue, Avhen so many good men resigned every earthly advantage rather than make ship- Avreck of faith and conscience, there have been men among us avIio have appeared in the foremost ranks of science, and who have honourably supported by splendid abilities and exalted character the cause of truth and freedom. Among those good men Avhom I have just mentioned many were eminently great, and distinguished no less by their learning than by their integrity. Their immediate successors in the cause, not having enjoyed the same opportunities of education, inherited their piety, but had not perhaps, in so large a degree, the distinctions of science. In a little Avhile, hoAvever, this disadvantage Avas removed, Academies under different Tutors Avere established, of Avhich it is sufficient praise to say that they have in every period furnished men fitted to appear, Avith credit to themselves and to their cause, in the defence not merely of a party-interest but of important truth and common Christianity. In the present clay the honour and respectability of the character are still maintained by many Avho have no reason to stand in aAve of the learning or abilities of any of their brethren. May the friends of reason and liberty ever deserve this animating praise And may this Seminary be the means of training up those</page><page sequence="71">69 Avho may appear in the rising age the Avise, the firm, the upright friends of the dearest interests and hopes of man Our Academies, it must be acknowledged, are destitute of some auxiliaries Avhich belong to the more splendid national establishments. We have no titles to confer, no emoluments to bestoAV, nor are Ave vested Avith collegiate powers to enforce obedience. The motives, therefore, by Avhich alone Ave are to animate the exertions and to secure the respect of our pupils must be pure and ingenuous. Unable to allure their industry by mercenary hopes, it may perhaps be better for them only to feel the excitements of disinterested praise.—That our own emoluments depend entirely on our oavh endeavours and success is likewise a favourable circumstance. We are influenced, I trust, by the noblest motives ; but Ave pretend not to be absolutely superior and indifferent to other considerations. And Ave shall be stimulated by the united action of every principle Avhich can keep in motion the strongest springs of human nature. It is of great importance to the cause Ave have in vieAV that several Academies subsist together in different parts of England. Li every region where they are established they bring Liberal Education Avithin the reach of many by whom such advantages could not otherwise have been enjoyed. They Aviden the circle of science, and they keep alive that spirit of honest and generous emulation Avhich is perhaps, in the best minds, necessary in order to continued and growing excellence. I pity the man who cannot distinguish this spirit from its base and spurious image. From the bottom of my heart I wish well to every Academical Institution among us. I respect those who conduct them. I rejoice hi their prosperity. And, animated by their success, I shall earnestly wish, and in this Avish I shall be cordially joined by my Avorthy colleague, that our Seminary may not be less deserving of public estimation, or that it may be as little as possible inferior to those Avhich can boast a longer establishment or a more public patronage. In expressing these sentiments I express yours. With sincere esteem you regard that Academy, Avhich alone has survived the late melancholy Avreck of so many of our public seminaries. With sincere affection you rejoice in the establishment of the neAv Academical Institution at London, because it pro¬ mises to extend to a distant and larger circle those benefits Avhich you Avish to enjoy in your oavh. Since you heard of that design, I Avill be bold to say that not a thought of competition ever entered your breast. You regard the patrons and friends of that scheme as coadjutors and allies Avith yourselves in the same great cause. You have acted upon this principle, and you have given the most unequivocal evidence that you Avished to maintain that cordial union Avith them</page><page sequence="72">70 Avhich ought over to subsist among those avIio have a common and noble end in vieAV. But the Academies already subsisting, or in contemplation, did not seem adequate to the Avants or wishes of every part of the kingdom. The region Avhich Ave inhabit is populous and Avealthy. Our oavii toAvn alone seemed likely to supply a considerable number of pupils. It is the centre of a large and opulent district, beyond Avhich lie many large toAvns, and even comities; to Avhich it Avas presumed the opportunity of enjoying the means of Academical Education would not be unwelcome. With unfeigned regret, you had seen the Academy at Warrington to Avhich Ave had been accustomed to look with fond regard, and to Avhich many around me, as Avell as myself, have been indebted for peculiar advantages, suspended, and at length finally dissolved. Some of you, avIio had been for several years the most cordial and active supporters of that Seminary, laboured with the most zealous assiduity to revive it. You still indulged the hope that it might rise again from its present depression Avith increased splendour ; nor did you at last abandon it till, every hope being at length cut off, you Avere obliged to turn your thoughts to another situation. You asked, " Shall then the Institution Avhich Ave have fostered so long, " and to which Ave have looked forward as the nursery of our youth in future " generations, be for ever given up Shall Ave have no similar establishment " in the northern parts of England Shall Ave have no Ministers educated " amongst ourselves, of Avhose characters, abilities, and sentiments Ave can form " the most certain knowledge Shall our youth, destined for other professions, " or for civil life, have no advantages Avithin the reach of more than a hundred "miles for the attainment of superior science?" The ansAver Avas obvious. Feeling within yourselves resources for this difficulty; animated to attempt, and accustomed to accomplish, Avhatever the sacred cause of liberty and virtue demand, you begun. With pleasure, you saw your scheme approved, and your endeavours seconded, by others of congenial spirits, till, in a short time, the patronage became so large, so liberal, and so respectable, as far to exceed your most sanguine expectations. From hence, you have been emboldened to extend your original plan, and, in addition to those public buildings Avhich alone it Avas your intention to erect, you are iioav pre¬ paring accommodations for a number of students, Avhich will, it is hoped, be free from the inconveniences necessarily attending their residence in the house of their Tutor, and yet so immediately under his eye, as to enjoy all the advantages of constant inspection and effectual government.</page><page sequence="73">71 Upon the general principles of our plan, I Avill, Avith your permission, make a feAV remarks. My time forbids a longer enlargement. With respect to the internal government of our Academy, Ave haA'e felt, as might be expected, the difficulties of every scheme Avhich has been presented to us. There is none Avhich has not its peculiar disadvantages. The best is that in which there are the feAvest. Guided by the experience of similar institutions, and particularly at Warrington, you have resolved"" not to hazard again the dangerous experiment of collegiate residence. You have thought it more eligible that young men shall reside in separate houses, not many together, under the control and inspection of their Professors, to Avhom you have referred the Avhole business of discipline and government. If, indeed, the number of students in divinity might have been expected to be so great as to bear a decided superiority over those destined for the other professions, their influence, it might be hoped, would have been favourable to all the ends Avhich you wished to attain. But Avhen this is not the case, and the past experience of the Academy at Warrington forbids us to expect that it Avill be the case in future, the safer maxim seems to be " to divide, in order to govern." By this means it Avill be much easier to counteract the clangers arising from the artifices of the designing, the audaciousness of the bold, and the seductions of the less principled. This is the general plan of foreign universities ; it is the plan which chiefly prevails in those of our Sister Kingdoms ; this was the plan at Warrington, in its first and purest stage ; and upon this plan have Academies been conducted, both out of and in the metropolis, AA7ith credit and success. It is presumed, therefore, that Ave may consider as established the authority of a principle, aa7Hc1i would of itself seem most likely to ensure order, industry, and improvement. With respect to the situation of Manchester, I Avill not here repeat Avhat has been just said, that Seminaries have flourished in large toAvns Avith the greatest reputation, nor Avill I urge that Masters, both in the principal and the auxiliary departments of science, may be there procured in greater variety, and Avith greater ease, than in other situations. The argument seems to turn upon this point. Are those young men more likely to be hereafter safe against the temptations of the world avIio have been, through the course of their education, entirely secluded from it, in privacy and solitude, far from the scenes Avhich corrupt and the allurements Avhich endanger their virtue, than those aa71io, having been accustomed to behold those scenes, and to resist those temptations, are only called Avhen they enter into more public life, to go on in the path Avhich they have pursued so long, and in Avhich lieAV exertions Avill not be necessary, but only the continuation of that spirit in Avhich they have been</page><page sequence="74">72 already established Is it not probable, and Avill not experience warrant the conclusion, that an education, not entirely AvithdraAA7n from the vieAV of those scenes, in the midst of Avhich they must hereafter be engaged, is more likely to confirm their principles and to mature their resolutions than one in Avhich they can only know by cold report the insinuations of the artful, the impu¬ dence of the wanton, and the raillery of the profane Between a large toAvn and a small one there surely can be no competition. In the smaller toAvns vice is often the most barefaced and brutal. Temptations are presented in the most undisguised and debasing forms. The loAA7er inhabit¬ ants are often marked by languor and supineness, if not by sottishness. And among those of higher rank, there is no poAver of selection. Nor are there those examples of a fervent and active spirit, which may, by a secret but poAverful sympathy, catch the minds of youth, and call them forth to ardour and exertion. With respect to our oavii toAvn, much might be truly said in favour of the regularity of its police, and the energy of that spirit which actuates the various orders of its inhabitants. But I forbear. I Avish not to press the argument to its utmost length. Suffice it to say, that if a large toAvn has some superior advantages, Manchester possesses them in at least an equal degree Avith any of the greater provincial toAvns of the kingdom. I feel, at this moment, Avith aAvful impression, the Aveight and importance of the charge Avhich hoav devoh7es upon me. Vested by the constitution Avhich you have established, in concert Avith my colleague, with the internal government of this Seminary, I feel it as a trust of the most solemn nature But I am not discouraged. Conscious to the motives from Avhich I act, I Avill not shrink from the apprehension of difficulties. I expect them. I avouIc! be prepared for them. In one principle I feel myself firm and immovable. I here pledge myself to you and to the public, that I Avill not continue to endure in this Academy the commission of enormities which, Avherever they prevail, poison the minds of youth, and destroy all the good effects of liberal education. If a temperate and steady discipline cannot restrain those disorders in their infancy, the next painful step Avill be to cut off the offenders from our body, that the baneful infection may not spread and contaminate the Avhole. If this be ineffectual, I Avill not any longer bear a part in the conduct of an institution to the duties of Avhich I shall be found unequal, and the burden of Avhich in such circumstances, if I Iciioav myself, I could not endure. But let me change this dark presage. Let us contemplate a happier and</page><page sequence="75">73 more animating prospect. To be, under God, the means of spreading abroad the beams of knoAvleclge and of religion ; to be succeeded by Providence in this great attempt of training up young men for the important department of superior life ; to see them rising up in fair and honourable excellence ; to soav those seeds Avhich shall in future years and through future generations spring up to a glorious and divine maturity How does the thought exhilarate, how does it expand and Avarm the heart! As for you, the generous founders, patrons, and friends of this Academy, your vieAvs are patriotic and noble. Whatever be its fate, you have acted from the Avorthiest and purest motives. It is not for you to command success. But let us be thankful that success is not necessary to the reward of well-doing. The righteous Judge of men looks to the heart alone ; and he Anil approve, and he Avill reAvard the good intention, even though it fail of accomplishing its pur¬ pose. In his hand are all events. From his favour alone cometh success. Duty is ours ; events belong to God; and let us indulge the sanguine hope, that vieAvs so liberal, and objects so important to the great interests of mankind Avill be honoured Avith his approbation and blessing. You are erecting a Temple, on the front of Avhich you will inscribe no name of any distinguished human leader, either in science or theology. You Avill dedicate it " to truth to liberty to religion !" When you turn your eyes toAvards it, you will breathe forth the dying Patriot's fervent aspiration.* You Avill pray that it may flourish Avith increasing honour to many future generations. Nor will you confine your good Avishes to this Seminary; you Avill also pray that the sacred cause to Avhich it is devoted may extend its influence abroad Avith glorious success; and that the holy light of truth, of reason, and of righteousness may shine over all the nations of the earth AA'ith growing lustre, eA7en to meridian day. *Esto perpetua tt</page><page sequence="76"></page><page sequence="77"></page><page sequence="78"></page><page sequence="79">4ta</page><page sequence="80">^pi&amp;ate- 4 A</page></plain_text>
