<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE VISUAL POETRY OF JOSEP-MARIA JUNOY by Willard Bohn Illinois State University It is generally recognized that the Spanish avant-garde grew out of earlier movements in France and Italy. This phenomenon was particularly evident in Catalonia which reacted against the political hegemony of Castile by strengthening its traditional ties with these two countries. During the first phase, which flourished between 1916 and 1924, Catalan writers experi- mented with Italian Futurism and drew heavily on French literary cu- bism. 1 Agusti Esclasans, one of the original participants, later recalled the enthusiastic reception these movements received: "Qui de nosaltres, els joves, l'any 1919, no jurava pel nom sagrat d'Apollinaire de la mateixa manera que una estona abans havia jurat pel nom sagrat de Marinetti? Del futurisme al cubisme literāri per anar a raure al dadaïsme, tota una llarga sèrie d'entusiasmes i de fantasies" ("Among the young men who were active in 1919, was there one of us who did not swear by the sacred name of Apollinaire - as he had sworn by the sacred name of Marinetti before that? From Futurism to literary cubism and finally dadaismi one long series of enthusiasms and fantasies"). 2 While the nature of this influence varied from writer to writer, one of its earliest signs was the emergence of visual poetry in Barcelona. To be sure, there had been a local visual tradition of sorts, but it had died out some years before. The last known example occurs in Rafel Nogueras Oiler's Les tenebroses (Barcelona: Plaça del Teatre, 1905), which includes a poem in the shape on an "S." Writen in praise of life and its pleasures, this work is in fact entitled "Una esse." Curiously, the shape and title seem to have no connection with the subject matter. This fact plus the heavy, solid form of the poem link it to an extremely old liturgical tradition going back to the Middle Ages. As a vehicle for devotional poetry, the shape was meant to enhance the verbal message while remaining totally subservient to it. Beginning in 1914,</page><page sequence="2">52 Willard Bohn Apollinaire and the Futurists developed a radically new philosophy of visual poetry. In both cases form was closely tied to content, and the visual message rivaled the verbal in importance. Taking their cue from commer- cial advertising, Marinetti's parole in liberta concentrated on expressive typography and geometric forms. In contrast, Apollinaire's calligrammes were inspired by modern art and employed a figurative (realistic) mode. Most of them were integrated into larger groups to form portraits, land- scapes, and still-lifes. While a certain amount of generic contamination occurred over the years as the result of reciprocal influence, the two strains retained their basic purity, allowing us to distinguish easily between Futurist and Apollinarian influence. The earliest practitioner of the new visual poetry in Catalonia was Josep-Maria Junoy (1887-1955). The very first issue of his review, Troços ("Pieces") - later changed to Trossos- included three examples. Appear- ing in 1916, it contained a total of seven poems by Junoy celebrating various artists who were exhibiting at the Galeries Laietanes (listed as publisher). These included Pierre Ynglada, Albert Gleizes, Hélène Grun- hoff, Serge Charchoune, Josep de Togores, Xavier Nougués, and Umber- to Boccioni. Five more visual poems appeared the following year. In 1920 most of Junoy's visual poetry was collected in Poemes i cal ligrames (Barcelona: Llibreria Nacional Catalana), which featured a preface by Apollinaire. While Guillem Diaz-Plaja claims that these works represent Apollinarian inspiration carried to its logical consequences, in fact they borrow heavily from Futurism.3 Among other things, we find the same preoccupation with geometric forms - spirals, parabolas, zigzags -as in Italy. Futurist thematics are also very much in evidence. Although the term calligrama comes from Apollinaire, Junoy's version does not resem- ble its French prototype. Predominately abstract, it rejects the figurative bias of the latter, its fascination with objects, and its pictorial structure. However, the very first poem in the series resembles neither one of its antecedents. Entitled "Pierre Ynglada," it juxtaposes seven unrhymed lines of poetry (arranged conventionally) with a beautifully textured hat label: "Lock &amp; C° / Hatters / St. James Street / London." The circular label has been sliced in two vertically and its left half displaced downward until it barely touches the upper half, forming a pleasing S curve. The lines themselves read as follows: "Jardí a la francesa / Estança de Racan / Maduixes en crema d'Isigny / i / del distant Japó / un / Herbari Lineal" (Classic French garden / Stanza by Racan / Strawberries in cream from Isigny / and / from distant Japan / a / Lineal Herbarium"). This apparently banal composition is actually rather complex. Since there are no verbs in the poem, the relationship between its components must be inferred. These in turn are remarkably static. Isolated on the page, the four objects recall the frozen groups of unrelated objects in Giorgio de Chirico's</page><page sequence="3">PIERRE YNGL ADA Jardi a la francesa Estança de Racan Maduixes en crema d Isigny J del distant ]apó '.S StreeU ÖoSS' Herbari Lineal /Loji ķsu§ ISĪJames</page><page sequence="4">54 Willard Bohn paintings. While it is tempting to picture them as a still-life or landscape, their structure remains stubbornly sequential. Moreover, the source of their unity is verbal, not visual. Clearly the composition is meant to be a portrait of Ynglada, who contributed to Troços and who was a close friend of Junoy's (the 1920 version, in Poemes i cal ligrames, is simply titled "Un amie" ["a friend"]). More precisely, it is a portrait of Ynglada the artist - a mixture of psychology and aesthetics. Thus Ynglada cultivates - and his art reflects - a sense of formal beauty like a classic French garden. Or a poem by Racan. To this we must add the rich sensuality of strawberries and cream and the exoticism of a Japanesse herbarium. The latter includes the notion of precision and order as well, since the dried plants in a lineal herbarium are arranged by genus and species. Actually this image is not as arbitrary as it seems, for Ynglada often drew groups of animals modeled on museum exhibits. Finally, all these traits are combined in the hat label, which provides a visual summary. If the first three objects evoke the French qualities of Ynglada- who affected the name Pierre instead of the Catalan Pere or the Castilian Pedro - the English label is a punning reference to his surname. We also know that he was a passionate admirer of England and France, having lived in each country for a number of years.4 While the label undoubtedly evokes Ynglada's penchant for British headgear as well, it has several other associations. To a Spaniard a British hat is an exotic artifact, a symbol of wealth and elegance. At the same time its simple, unadorned style reflects a basic conservatism, in keeping with the tenets of British fashion. The net impression is thus one of elegant simplicity. The poem begins and ends with this visual statement. Ultimately, we are left with an object portrait much like those perfect- ed by Francis Picabia the year before in New York. Interestingly, Picabia resided in Barcelona during much of 1916 and exhibited at the Dalmau Gallery where the Catalan avant-garde (including Junoy) congregated. The use of labels in general was pioneered by the Cubist painters. Apollinaire authorized its introduction into poetry in 1913 when he wrote: "Rivalise donc poète avec les étiquettes des parfumeurs" ("Le Musicien de Saint- Merry"). In 1920 Junoy added the image of a "maillot de circ" ("circus tights") and replaced Racan's stanza with "Alexandři Niquelai." Neither of these choices is especially felicitous. The latter may refer to the last Tzar, Nikolai Aleksandrovich, recently executed by the Bolsheviks. Or Junoy may be thinking of Nicolas Alexandre (1654-1728) who authored a Dictionnaire botanique et pharmaceutique. Either figure dovetails with the themes of elegance and order. However, the idea of a circus performer in tights introduces a discordant note. It is no longer a question of rarity and refinement but of popular entertainment. The next poem, "Jongleurs d'Hélène Grunhoff," is filled with enor- mous vitality. The body of the text is arranged in a single horizontal line</page><page sequence="5">JONGLEURS D'HÉLÈNE GRUNHOFF 'i* &gt; -4?

While this pattern may duplicate the design of GrunhofFs painting, it probably represents Junoy's abstract impression. In any case, it reproduces the rhythm of several balls passing between two jugglers and suggests their trajectory. Our attention is drawn initially to the word ÁNIMA, whose gigantic boldface letters are strung out between the peaks of the zigzag. It then shifts to another inscription (below the zigzag) in Gothic boldface: Noble i Vehement. These three terms establish the character of GrunhofTs art. Its forceful- ness and its elegance proceed directly from her soul. We are now ready to tackle the rest of the text: "Hum crua de voltaic nodrint una / massa de narració polièdrica / d'un tirànic / i confós dinamisme / eritzat de vermelló ciratge / negre i or" ("arc lamp's raw light nourishing a / polyhedric mass of narration / with a tyrannical / and confused dynamism / bristling with vermillion - black / and gold shoe polish"). If the polyhed- ron lends a tinge of Cubism to the composition, the arc lamp is a Futurist symbol par excellence . The mention of "dinimisme" puts a Futurist seal on the work once and for all. The notion of vehemence is translated, not only by this term but by the harsh light of the lamp. It is intensified by the adjective "tirànic" and the vigorous participle "eritzat" ("bristling"). These aggressive images contrast with the noble solidity of the polyhedric mass and a nourishing presence ("nodrint") suggesting the soul. Thus the poem's visual impressionism is echoed by the verbal text. The only objective facts at our disposal are the painting's title and its primary colors. That these are compared to shoe polish probably indicates a smooth, shiny finish. This brings us back to the words Noble i Vehement which are arranged to form an ellipse. While conceivably they represent the jugglers' ball, their oval shape suggest a flat, round can of shoe polish (as does the Gothic lettering). Undoubtedly this is another example of Junoy's love of labels. Two other texts date from 1916. The first, which eventually appeared in Poemes i calligrames, is little more than a joke. Entitled "Art poètica," it features a large Z at the top of the page linked to a large A at the bottom by a vertical column of dots. The fact that there are exactly twenty-seven of these confirms our initial impression: the sequence is meant to repre- sent the Catalan alphabet. Junoy has reversed the normal order as a form of protest against traditional values - which must be turned upside down. The new aesthetics demands a radical restructuring of art involving its most basic elements. From our own vantage point, sixty years later, the importance of this manifesto is primarily historical. If the date can be trusted, this is the earliest known example of alphabet poetry, a genre that rose to prominence under Dada and Surrealism.5 Antedating Aragon's notorious "Suicide" by a full four years, it grew out of much the same background and embodied a similar philosophy of language. "Estela angular" ("Angular Wake") is yet another type of visual poem.

Placed one below the other with their edges almost touching, these are carefully aligned but have somewhat different dimensions. Each triangle forms part of a larger rectangle that is divided diagonically by the hypoten- euse. In each case the other half of the rectangle is painted solid black - in mourning for Boccioni. The resulting composition is both forceful and intensely angular, like the sculptor himself. While the two black triangles suggest the finality and suddenness of Boccioni's death, they also suggest the influential (angular) wake left by his passage through life. In this context, we should note that one of the alternate meanings of estela is "stele." Visually and functionally the poem does indeed answer this description, but there the resemblance ends. The metaphoric and metaphysical value of the text outweighs its commemora- tive function: i a sensdupte radioactivitat immediata en l'anima despresa de la llatzarosa materia nostra Boccioni que fou en vida panteixant corifeu d'una plástica multíplice de incisos paroxistes certament que amb sa mort ha alcançat vida depurada transfusió del seu esperit a la llum pristina i giravoltanta restant el pus i la fum espessa al ras de la terra llaurada [Detached from our miserable matter, the soul undoubtedly has immediate radioactivity. Boccioni was a living and breathing coryphée of multiplex plasticity and paroxysmic clauses, whose death has enabled him to attain a purified life (the transfusion of his spirit with pristine, fluttering light), while pus and clouds of smoke cover the plowed earth]. The Futurist cult of modernity (and energy) is reflected in the image of the radioactive soul. If Junoy chooses to emphasize this aspect of Boccioni's work, the theme of force - first stated in the visual text - is continued in the paroxysmic manifestos. Similarly the theme of Boccioni's influence, which is implicit in the wake/trail image, is restated by the central metaphor. As one of the founders of Futurism, he resembles the kory- phaios or leader of the chorus in ancient Greek tragedy. Otherwise the poem proceeds via a series of polar images. Following a pattern of repetition and reinforcement, body is opposed to soul, life to death, corruption to purity, and earth to heaven. In addition a visual-verbal contrast exists between the darkness of the black triangles and the light of the Holy Ghost (in the traditional role as a fluttering dove). The final image of tilled fields suggests that the "wake" in question is that of a tractor, not a boat (estela also means track or trail). In any case, the poem</page><page sequence="10">60 Willard Bohn ends on a slightly optimistic note. If the landscape is bare and forlorn, the plowed furrows hold the promise of eventual renewal. Once again the reference is to Boccioni's influence and its (re)generative power. In 1917 Junoy published a poem entitled "Sacarina i mentol en espiral" ("Saccharin and Menthol in a Spiral") in the September issue of Troços. Dedicated to Nijinsky and dated June 1917, it incorporates three different abstract forms. Extending diagonally across the page in huge boldface letters is the word DELTOÏDES. The title itself forms a spiral in the upper left corner, while the lower right is occupied by a fan-like arrangement of eight lines terminating in the letters: FANGDIVI ("divinemud"). In its orientation the fan's 45° arc corresponds to the lower half of the upper right quadrant of a circle. Without the dedication we could never decipher this interesting composition. Following this clue, however, we soon discover that it is a portrait of Nijinsky - who spent much of 1917 in Spain. In June (the date of the poem) he danced with the Ballets Russes at the Gran Teatre del Liceu de Barcelona, which is undoubtedly where Junoy saw him.6 Visually and verbally the images are remarkably cohesive. While the Futurists prized the spiral as a symbol of energy -which fits Nijinsky perfectly - here it also suggests the latter's graceful pirouettes. The hyphens between each syllable introduce the notion of deliberate regularity, reflecting his perfect control as a dancer. If the spiral evokes Nijinsky's grace, the diagonal DELTOÏDES suggests his power. Slicing boldly across the page, it represents the beginning of a great leap (grand jeté). The third figure appears to depict the final phase of that leap. After launching himself into space Nijinsky - famous for his bal- lon - seems to float there forever, eventually descending to earth in a slow, graceful arc. Verbally, the poem consists of a series of metaphors inter- rupted by a single objective image. Of course the connotations of saccharin and menthol have changed over the years. In 1917 these recently invented substances stood for modernity and progress (man's triumph over nature). A symbol of concentrated energy, like the spiral, the artificial sweetener combines with the spearmint flavoring to evoke an intensely pleasurable, refreshing form of dance. In particular, Junoy singles out Nijinsky's prominent deltoid muscles which are responsible for much of his grace. Covering the two shoulder joints, these triangular muscles serve to raise the arm away from the side of the body. The final metaphor derives from the shape of these muscles, which suggests the Trinity to Junoy and hence the divine origins of the dancer. The Baudelairean image of divine mud is not without Biblical overtones. Combining the spiritual with the sensual, the heavenly with the mun- dane, Nijinsky personifies a new breed of dancer. As such he is portrayed as the Adam of ballet.</page><page sequence="11">(a Ntjlnaki) X "JS&gt; /a, &lt;âp^ J. -M. JUNOY. J&lt;UW &gt;M*</page><page sequence="12">62 Willard Bohn In October Junoy published two visual poems, one in Troços the other in Iberia (which had a much greater circulation). Dated August 1917, the first consists of a single sentence arranged in a vertical zigzag pattern: "Ja de bona hora tendra pluja de pétais / de rosa i ubriagueses de triangle de raim / muscat mes la meva dolor no es fon al sol" ("Before long there will be a rain of rose / petals and pergolas with triangles of muscat / grapes, but my pain does not melt away in the sunlight"). At each angle there is a circular cluster of dots representing a shower of blossoms. While at first glance the design of the poem appears to be totally abstract, in fact form is closely wedded to content. Retitled "Zig-Zag" in 1920, the poem traces the course of a single petal. Since the angle of descent remains constant from one line to the next and since the (visual) length of the lines is uniform, it is clearly a windless day. We are left with the image of a blossom gently seesawing back and forth in the still air as it settles to the ground. In addition, continuing the delta motif, the zigzag's two triangles suggest the triangular bunches of grapes on the pergola. At the verbal level Junoy relies on parataxis and condensation. The key to the poem lies in the image of the sun, which presides over the entire composition. Evoked in connection with the author, the sun is also responsible for the biological destinies of the rose and the grape. While in Junoy's case there is a lack of interaction, its effect on the plant world is plainly demonstrable. The images of maturation and resolution in the first two lines contrast with the implicit sterility of the last line. Nowhere is the basic opposition more evident than in the water imagery: the freely falling rain at the beginning and the ice that will not melt at the end. If at one level the poem constitutes a lament (presumably amorous), at another it embodies a yearning for an organic existence. From a Christian point of view -Junoy was a devout Catholic - this amounts to nostalgia for a return to a state of natural grace. Junoy's masterpiece "Guynemer" is the only one of his visual poems to achieve international notoriety. A symbol of sorts, it is likewise the only example of this genre cited by name in the literary histories of Catalonia. 7 Published in Iberia on October 6, 1917, "Guynemer" was translated into French and issued as a booklet about March 1, 19 18. 8 Since the poem concerned France and involved patriotic sentiments, Junoy mailed copies to several prominent patriots, including Charles Maurras, Georges Cle- menceau, and Maurice Barrés. He also sent a copy to Apollinaire, for reasons that remain unclear. At least he could count on a sympathetic response from the author of Calligrammes, who in fact was the only one to appreciate it. This in turn led to a brief exchange of letters, one of which was reprinted as the preface to Poemes i calligrames. 9 Apollinaire himself published a complimentary review of "Guynemer" in L'Europe Nouvelle on April 6, 1918. 10 The title of the poem refers to the French ace Georges Guynemer, who disappeared over Pool-Capelle, Belgium, dur-</page><page sequence="13">* K* A+* • ' ♦ . * af ..-.alio-»9" • • j8p®ißul" ..-.alio-»9" • • • • • * * * « . . . *0*f "o „ '*0/ J.-M.

Apollin- aire, who immediately grasped the visual principle at work here, described the poem as follows: "Sur une page de japon, en points représentant les constellations, on peut lire Ciel de France tandis que la chute de l'avion du grand aviateur est figurée par une courbe qui se lit de bas en haut pour indiquer la remontée au firmament de l'âme du héros." The economy of line in this composition is unprecedented in the history of visual poetry. To have designed a simple curve that would depict two opposite motions (and notions) was a stroke of genius. Apollin- aire neglects to add that the curve is tapered toward the top to give the illusion of distance. This is the only visual poem in Catalonia to incorporate a three-dimensional perspective. In addition, the first two words are larger and darker than the rest, suggesting the doomed aircraft. The visual and verbal messages are actually congruent here, since the poem begins with a metaphor for the airplane, en Vestei ("in the star"). Threading its way through the words CEL DE FRANÇA ("sky over France"), the curve reads: "en l'estel mortalment ferit per l'espai hi brunceig encara el Huent cor del motor mes l'ánima viva del adolescent heroï vola ja vers les constelacións" ("In the mortally wounded star the motor's glowing heart still buzzes through space, but the intrepid soul of the young aerial hero already soars toward the constellations"). 1 1 A note at the bottom informs us that Junoy has petitioned the French Minister of Public Instruction and the president of the Société Astronomique to name a constellation after Guynemer. By sending his poem to selected French patriots, the author obviously hoped to elicit their support. Like most of Junoy's works, "Guynemer" depends on a series of oppositions: up versus down, heaven versus earth, soul versus body, life versus death, etc. If we have encountered these before in "Estela angular," here they are presented visually as well as verbally. Each of the verbal oppositions is contained in the directional polarity of the visual text. Interestingly, no direct mention is made of Guynemer's death. Instead his physical fate is transferred to the airplane which is described in human terms. Even here the distancing process continues, for the final image - now twice-removed - is that of a star. In this way Junoy uses displace- ment and metaphor to minimize the actual loss. The mortally wounded star metaphor seems incongruous at first, which may explain why it was deleted in later versions. However, the existence of constellations spelling CEL DE FRANÇA makes it clear that the action takes place at night. This means that the airplane's "glowing heart" -an anthropomorphic meta- phor for a flaming engine - is highly visible. As the craft plunges to the ground, its arc resembles that of a meteor or falling-star. In fact, the star is the single most important image in the poem. "Guynemer" begins and ends with this image, which gives the composition a deliberate symmetry.</page><page sequence="15">GTT YNEMER • • 4* # • • / : / s / j • • • • • ? . • # / • . •. : jl •* / 1 ••••..:• 2 !

Visually and verbally the poem ends on an upbeat. On both levels we witness the apotheosis of Guynemer. At this point something very interesting happens - the poetic frame expands to include the reader. The final note brings us back to the real world. Proceeding from fantasy to fact, Junoy seeks to project his poetic vision on reality. In asking that a star or constellation be named after the aviator, Junoy is following an ancient tradition. In Greek mythology persons were often metamorphosed into stars to commemorate a particularly important event. Guynemer would thus acquire a mythic dimension in life (or death) paralleling that in Junoy's poem. The falling-star would finally be negated by a rising star. Parenthetically, the words CEL DE FRANÇA are reminiscent of Apollinaire. Composed of dots representing stars, they recall the calligrammatic sky of "Voyage" and the constellation in Cas du brigadier masqué. 12 In the latter work, after his encounter with the masked corporal, the poet discovers that the stars have grouped together to form a sign: VIVE LA FRANCE! In any case Le Poète assassiné, which includes this story, was known in Catalonia as early as November 25, 1916, when Francese Carbonell published a review of it in Iberia. There remains to mention one last visual poem, "Eufòria" ("Euphor- ia"), which is included in Poemes i cailigrames. Dated 1917, it is obviously related to the others and was probably composed in the summer or late spring. Visually, this work is semi-abstract and consists of five lines radiating out from a common center. In each case the reader must begin at the center and work his way toward the periphery. The underlying principle seems to be that of a release of energy, in keeping with the title. The general pattern of radiation suggests nuclear fission, the sun, radio waves, or a star. To decipher the poem we must begin at one o'clock on the dial and prodeed in a clockwise direction: "cos nu al sol / mentol al cor / espiral de rialles / una rosa color de rosa / decisions sinòptiques" ("Nude body in the sun / menthol in the heart / spiral of laughs / a rose-colored rose / synoptic decisions"). The process here is clearly related to that in "Pierre Ynglada." Each of the first four lines serves as an example of euphoria. They are not synoptic decisions so much as synoptic equivalents. Taken together, they constitute a landscape portrait. One is reminded of Manet's Déjeuner sur l'herbe or Renoir's Jeune Femme au soleil. While the semantic incompatibility of the last two words ("decisions sinòptiques") is puzzling, their basic meaning is clear. The previous lines summarize the salient points of a much larger situation - whence their telegraphic style. It is up to the reader to supply the missing context and to complete the picture.</page><page sequence="17">GÜYNEMEB »•»* *»»v' • j» ••••• / ❖ / ❖ s • • • • • € # • • * v • • • J C • * • • • • . # . • * !

For one thing, Junoy proceeds from the inside out, from subjective feelings to objective phenomena. Thus the sensation of well-being attached to sunbathing gives way to the sound of laughter. Inner joy ("menthol al cor") leads to the voluptuous rose. For another thing, the first four lines each contain an image that conforms to the visual pattern. The first of these finally allows us to establish the identity of the picture. Actually this fluctuates in the course of the poem, but it is still possible to point to a dominant image. Presiding over the entire poem, this is clearly the sun. In this respect "Euforia" resembles "Ja de bona hora." In the next line the visual pattern is repeated by the palpitating heart, which transmits (1) blood and (2) sound waves in every direction. While it is possible to reconcile the spiral in line 3 with the radial model, in fact it refers to another visual characteristic. In reading the poem we must rotate the text 360° in order to decipher it. From a visual standpoint these three images are thoroughly dynamic. Returning to the radial pattern in the fourth line, the rose suddenly introduces a static note. This slows the momentum of the poem and prepares for the ending. If "Euforia" resembles works by both Apollinaire and the Futurists, the latter are much more in evidence. The visual design, the telegraphic style, the spiral, the synoptic decisions - all these point to Marinetti. In particular they recall his use of l'analogia disegnata and l'immaginazione senza fili , as well as his tavole sinottiche di valori lirici. As noted previously, this poem antedates "Guynemer" by several months or more. "Euforia" is a distinctly seasonal poem, and the season that it depicts is clearly not fall (cf. "Ja de bona hora"). Thus "Guynemer" not only represents the highpoint of Junoy's visual career, it also marks the end of his experimentation with this genre. After its success - which was widespread - he was apparently unwilling to risk his reputation on other works, which could not fail to be inferior. For all practical purposes, Junoy had exhausted the potential of visual poetry as he understood it. This left him with two choices: to give up poetry for good or to revert to traditional forms. His decision is evident in the next issue of Troços (November 1, 1917) which contains a poem entitled "C2H2." Dated October 1917, it describes a band of acetylene fairies dancing the sardana around a pile of carbide. If its subject is clearly experimental, "C2H2" inaugurates a new series of works written exclusively in vers libres. Through relatively brief, Junoy's visual period awakened other Catalan poets to the possibilities of visual form. Among those who followed in his footsteps were Vicenç Solé de Sojo, Joan Salvat-Papasseit, Joaquim Fol- güera, and Carles Sindreu i Pons. While their works are extremely interesting, visually they are not as appealing as Junoy's. The latter was an accomplished artist and possessed a sophisticated sense of design. Keenly</page><page sequence="19">The Visual Poetry of Josep-Maria Junoy 69 aware of the nuances of visual language, he extracted a maximum of meaning from the shape of this poetry. As much as anything, Junoy's final significance derives from his dual training in art and literature. One of the few visual poets with artistic gifts, he was able to create a rare harmony between form and content.
