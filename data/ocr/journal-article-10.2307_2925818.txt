<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Cage of Matter: The World as Zoo in Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood WILLIAM RODNEY ALLEN Louisiana Schoolfor Math, Science and the Arts IN Flannery O'Connor: The Imagination of Extremity, Frederick Asals observes that Wise Blood "seems to have become the whipping-boy of the O'Connor canon, a mass of faults that reveals the greater expertise of The Violent Bear It Away or the superiority of the stories to both novels."1 Objections to, Wise Blood go as far back as the letter one man wrote to O'Connor demanding to know "what happened to the guy in the ape suit."2 Subsequent com- plaints about the novel have also centered on Enoch Emery-in particular on the supposed disconnectedness of his subplot from the structure of the rest of the story. One critic, for example, while admitting there are thematic parallels between Enoch and the Christ-haunted Hazel Motes, concludes that the episode of Enoch and the gorilla "would have better been deleted from the novel."3 Taking the opposite position is Jonathan Baumbach, who, far from viewing Wise Blood as a collection of thematic loose ends, argues that the novel is overly schematic.4 In the last fifteen years or so, however, a critical consensus has emerged that Wise Blood neither lacks unity nor suffers from an excess of it, whatever that might mean Critics have demonstrated how Enoch's story intricately parallels and parodies Haze's inverted quest for salvation, and how Enoch's donning of the ape suit is the culmination of O'Connor's theme of "reverse evolution," an idea she makes explicit with a profusion of animal imagery.5 Other critics have pointed out the I (Athens: Univ. of Georgia Press, I982), p. 6i. 2 The Habit of Being, ed.

Animal imagery threatens to overwhelm Wise Blood. When O'Connor, in her note to the second edition, pronounced the novel "still alive," she may wryly have meant that assessment almost literally, for Wise Blood is alive as a jungle is alive.7 On nearly every page of the book, as Asals writes, "human figures are well on their way to being absorbed into the lower orders of animals."8 In the novel's opening paragraph, as Haze sits on the train to Taulkin- ham, he faces the cliche-mouthing Mrs. Wally Bee Hitchcock, "a fat woman with pink collars and cuffs and pear-shaped legs" (p. 9) whom O'Connor implicitly links with the hogs Haze has just glimpsed out the window. The "bee" and "cock" imbedded in her name establish a pattern of animal names: Asa and Sabbath Hawks, Onnie Jay Holy, and Holy's real name, Hoover Shoats. As this list suggests, O'Connor favors bird images to describe minor and major characters. A steward on the train moves "like a crow" and serves three women "dressed like parrots," one of whom has a "game-hen expression" (pp. 15-I6). A peeler sales- man's shirt is alive with "pheasants, quail, turkeys," and a used-car salesman's son has a face resembling an "eagle's" (pp. 38, 69). Asa Hawks, described as a "mandrill" (p. 39) at one point because of the striped scars on his face, is ironically named in that he is a spiritually blind, fake preacher whose physical vision is acute; Onnie Jay Holy, like a Jaybird, is loud, brightly "dressed," and capable of scolding (as when he threatens Haze for refusing to work 29 (1976), 197-205; Margaret Peller Feely, in "Flannery O'Connor's Wise Blood: The Negative Way," Southern Quarterly, 17 (I979), 104-22; and Daniel R.

Enoch, as he prepares to steal the "new jesus," operates as always on instinct, for he is like "a bird [who] finds itself building itself a nest when it hasn't actually been planning to" (p. I29). The predatory Haze, though he will hunt and kill prey with his car rather than with a sharp beak, "has a nose like a shrike's bill,"9 and he pushes his way through a crowd "with his elbows out like sharp wings" (pp. I0, 54). O'Connor uses all these images of birds to describe her charac- ters in order to show how humans are no more than animals without the uplifting influence of a spiritual winged figure: the Holy Ghost. On one of his random drives, Haze, who despite himself is more aware than the other characters of the spiritual dimension, notices a "blinding white cloud," which "had turned into a bird with long thin wings and was disappearing in the opposite direction" (p. I27). Since O'Connor describes the cloud earlier, in the traditional anthropomorphic image of God, as a "white one with curls and a beard" (p. II 7), John V. McDermott seems justified in arguing that the Holy Ghost is "symbolized by the cloud-bird image."10 But this emblem of spirituality recedes from Haze even as he drives toward it. While people are frequently depicted as aggressive or gaudy birds in Wise Blood, they are often more disgusting or bizarre creatures. The museum guard resembles "a dried-up spider" (p. 97), Sabbath has "the disposition of a yellow jacket" (p. 2I5), Haze's grandfather had been "a waspish old man" (p. 20), a woman in the crowd in Taulkinham carries a "cat-faced baby" (p. I48), and Enoch has a "fox-shaped face" or looks "like a friendly hound dog with light mange" (pp. 38, 44). But as friendly as Enoch is to his "master," he cannot gain his affection, for Haze has more important matters on his mind-such as his sexual desire, which links him to the animal world. As Haze studies the walls of the toilet stall in the train station, for example, he sees a phallic drawing "that looked like a snake" (p. 30). This observation is one of the many times in Wise Blood that O'Connor depicts man's I Asals notes that Haze's description as a "shrike" may owe something to O'Connor's reading of Nathanael West's Miss Lonelyhearts, which features a character by that name.

Paralleling the toilet stall is another enclosed place with sexual associations: the coffin-like box containing the naked woman Haze had seen as a boy at the carnival. The carnival woman, who had first looked like "a skinned animal" to Haze, had set off the unfortunate linking in the boy's mind of sexuality and death, a fusion encouraged by his father's crude remark that "Had one of themther built into ever' casket. . . be a heap ready to go sooner" (p. 62). Several critics have pointed out that when Haze is punished by his mother when he returns home, and he later imagines his mother in the naked woman's box, the Oedipus complex becomes firmly rooted in his psyche. But what is to the point here is O'Connor's insistence on depicting her characters as loathsome beasts-snakes, spiders, skinned animals. Asals perceptively comments on Wise Blood's "strong current of the imagery of repulsion, a repulsion at the physical deeper than anything required by the novel's motif of reverse evolution"; moreover, he parallels this repulsion with the existentialists' dread of what Sartre calls being-in-itself.11 Physical reality for Sartre is distressing, even sickening, because it is totally inhuman, totally devoid of meaning. One thinks of Sartre's novel Nausea as perhaps the literary epitome of existential loathing of the physical; significantly, O'Connor referred to Wise Blood more than once in her letters as "my opus nauseous."12 Another existential source for Wise Blood may be Kafka's story "Metamorphosis," in which the protagonist de-evolves not into an ape or a dried-up spider but a grotesquely huge insect. But a more important source than the existentialists for O'Connor's treatment of man's animality is the tradition of Christian satire. From Chaucer through Swift and on to Waugh, Christian writers have emphasized man's creatureli- ness in order to undermine his pretensions that he is god. When man in effect becomes an animal, O'Connor and the other Chris- tian satirists insist, and behaves like a beast in a world of beasts, he is "revolting" in both senses of the word: disgusting and in rebellion against his proper place in God's creation. And when man, mimicking Satan, revolts against God, the only way he can go is down-into a lower order of being. 11 Asals, pp. 29-35, 50. 12 The Habit of Being, pp. 24, 27.</page><page sequence="5">260 American Literature Just as humans in the novel regress into animals, animals have a disturbing tendency to appear to metamorphose into humans. During Enoch's ritualistic stop at the Frosty Bottle on the way to the zoo, he and Haze see "a large advertisement for ice cream showing a cow dressed like a housewife" (p. 88). At the zoo, Haze and Enoch pass the cage of two bears, who "sit facing each other like two matrons having tea, their faces polite and self-absorbed" (p. 93). Later, back in his room, Enoch anthropomorphizes the picture of a moose on his wall. He finds "the look of superiority on the animal's face . . . insufferable," and laments that "if he hadn't been afraid of him, he would have done something about it long ago." Enoch triumphs over the moose by "taking the frame off him," which is, to Enoch, equal "to taking the clothes off him (although he didn't have on any)" (pp. I32-33). Apart from comically foreshadowing Enoch's "taking the clothes off" of another "animal" -the man in the ape suit-this episode shows Enoch reduced to the level of envying beasts. Since he desires a life of animal ease and satisfaction-avoiding work, slurping milk shakes at the Frosty Bottle, eating candy bars, pursuing random sexual encounters at whorehouses-Enoch naturally envies the luxurious life of the animals in the zoo. Their cages are "electrical- ly heated in the winter and air conditioned in the summer and there were six men hired to wait on the animals and feed them T- bone steaks. The animals didn't do anything but lie around. Enoch watched them all day, full of awe and hate" (p. 82). O'Connor obviously uses the images of the cow as housewife and the bears as matrons to show the animality of humans whose only desire is to satisfy their physical needs. But by metamorphosing animals into humans as Enoch and Haze approach the zoo, she prepares us for the idea that the caged creatures symbolize secular man in a more profound way, for they, like human beings without God's grace, are hopelessly trapped. As a result of this theme of entrapment, Wise Blood is permeated with the terror of claustrophobia. So pervasive are references to walling up cats (Mrs. Flood says to Haze of this practice that "it's something people have quit doing" [p. 224]), stuffing people up chimneys (a horror that occurs in a story Sabbath tells about a woman and her lover who murder the woman's child [p. 52]), and</page><page sequence="6">The Zoo in O'Connor's Wise Blood 26I being buried alive that Asals and others have noted the unmistak- able echoes of Poe's claustrophobic tales in Wise Blood. 13 O'Connor encloses her characters in a whole graveyard of symbolic coffins, and often her living corpses are women, all of whom recall the naked woman Haze had seen in the box at the carnival. The grotesque swimmer Enoch ogles as she climbs out of the pool and pulls down her swimsuit straps is perhaps the most obvious of these character doubles. Others are the woman in the ticket booth at the moviehouse, Sabbath hiding in the back seat of Haze's car, the grandmother who kills herself by jumping into a well in another of Sabbath's macabre stories, the various waitresses behind counters whom Enoch torments with his crude advances, and a woman on a movie poster being stuffed into an incinerator by a monster. In this last example in particular O'Connor points out the sadism implicit in the commercial idea of sexuality, in which women are turned into objects to be imprisoned, tortured, or killed by aggressive males. In part because he has completely accepted this perverse commercialization of human sexuality, Enoch seeks out enclosed "sexy" places, even though he fears them. Though he promises himself he will not enter, because of the uncontrollable urges it will arouse in him, Enoch obsessively gravitates to the palace of perverse sexuality, the movie theatre. After seeing the poster of the monster stuffing the woman in the incinerator, Enoch is mesmerized by films about a sadistic scientist, Devil's Island Penitentiary, and a baboon whose heroic exploits win him a medal from "a nice-looking girl" (p. I39). Parallel to Enoch's voyeurism at the movies is his spying on the woman at the swimming pool and his obsessive gawking at the animals at the zoo. His sexual maladjustment, moreover, like Haze's, has its roots in childhood; Enoch brags to Haze that he had escaped the "welfare woman," his symbolic mother, by exposing himself to her as she lay in bed. Yet Enoch's fascination with enclosed places extends beyond those with explicitly sexual associations, even though his first encounter with one had been painful. The fake box of candy labeled "A Nutty Surprise" his father had brought home from the 13 Asals, pp. 24-29.</page><page sequence="7">262 American Literature penitentiary had contained only a coiled steel spring that broke off Enoch's front teeth when he had opened his "present." This scene is comically prefigured in the same chapter when Enoch, while peering in at the "new jesus" in his gold-painted shrine, sneezes violently and cracks his head on the cabinet. Curiosity may kill the cat, but it only injures this pathetic "hound dog with light mange." O'Connor is perhaps thinking in these two scenes of the myth of Pandora's box, for when Enoch inquisitively tears open his fake box of candy or breaks into the mummy's case, he is symbolically setting loose evil-his father's cruelty, the awareness of mortality represented by the mummy. Yet, as in the myth, Enoch's actions also set free hope, because in his crude way he is groping toward a better life-one in which he has friends, becomes "The young man of the future" (p. I9I), undergoes a radical transformation. His obsession with the museum-its cool, tomb-like rooms and its mummy cases-reflects his primitive attempt to grapple with the philosophical issue of human mortality. The mysterious shrunken Arab, with whom Enoch identifies (he whispers to Haze that "he was once as tall as you or me" [p. 98]), is for Enoch the incarnation of Haze's abstract notion of the "new jesus" a purely secular savior. But while Enoch "liberates" the mummy from his glass case and brings him to the cabinet shrine in his room, this sham savior remains a dead man in a box-an emblem of the transience of physical existence. As thematically rich as it is, Enoch's subplot serves merely to counterpoint Haze's more metaphysical concerns. As Haze, after being dragged to the museum by Enoch, faces the mummy, he comes to a full stop for the first time. But his meditation on the shrunken man is broken when he sees on the glass case the reflection of the woman from the swimming pool, whose face triggers his Oedipal memories of the carnival woman and of his fantasy of seeing his mother in a box. As her face appears, Haze does what he always does when he feels trapped: he bolts. That Haze would be mesmerized by the mummy in his glass "coffin" is perfectly understandable, since as a child he had seen his fanatical- ly religious grandfather, two brothers, father, and mother in their caskets. Yet as fast as he runs from these terrifying memories, he repeatedly finds himself boxed in symbolic coffins: his berth on the</page><page sequence="8">The Zoo in O'Connor's Wise Blood 263 train, the toilet stall at the station, Leora Watts's tiny room, his car. As a means of escaping his past, Haze's motion is as futile as a rat's on a treadmill, or a rat-colored car's down a highway that seems to be "slipping back under" (p. 207) its wheels. Presenting Haze in frenetic but futile motion is crucial to O'Connor's eventual fusion of the imagery of confined spaces and animals. From the moment we first see Haze he is a man on the move: sitting on the speeding train, he leans "at a forward angle," looking out the window "as if he might want to jump out of it" (p. 9). He has just come back "from half way around the world" (p. 24), where the army had sent him to some unnamed war. Having visited his old home place only to find it claimed by entropy, Haze is one of O'Connor's "displaced" persons-a restless wanderer in search of "a place to be." Any number of critics have commented on Haze's obsessive movement, but none has pointed out how O'Connor renders that movement totally ineffectual and ludicrous. She does so by repeatedly showing Haze moving in a small, closed system that is itself being carried along within a larger moving system. Haze seems completely oblivious to the absurdity of his restless movements on the train, for example. As the train races toward Taulkinham, Haze engages in a Chaplinesque series of slapstick maneuvers. As he lurches up and down the aisles he is pushed by the porter and the steward; next, he is humiliated in the packed dining car; as he returns to his berth he is blocked by Mrs. Hitchcock, and when "she tried to get past him he tried to let her but they were both moving the same way each time" (p. i8); finally, he runs headlong into the porter and knocks him down. In terms of the motion of the train. Haze's incessant movements within it are meaningless. O'Connor's ultimate intention is to suggest that all human movement-even Haze's journey "half way around the world"-is insignificant in cosmic terms. In one of the most often quoted passages in Wise Blood, O'Connor contrasts the frantically blinking neon signs of Taulkinham with the vast, slow motions of the stars, and then scornfully notes that "No one was paying any attention to the sky"14 (p. 37). Throughout the novel 1 O'Connor probably is alluding here to the opening sentence of Stephen Crane's "The Open Boat," another story about the ironies resulting from a closed system's (the boat's) movement within a larger moving system (the ocean).</page><page sequence="9">264 American Literature the sky, with its clouds shaped like the face of God or the Holy Ghost, is man's one escape route from his absurd existence-but he is typically too caught up in looking at the "junk" (p. I94) in the store windows of Taulkinham to notice it. The emblem of Haze's absurd motion is of course his battered Essex, his symbolic home, pulpit, and coffin. Despite Haze's insistence that "I don't have to run from anything" (p. 76), he spends much of his time driving around in his car, which lurches "forward about six inches and then back about four" (p. I54), mimicking Haze's unsteady movements on the train. Insisting in a wonderful enthymematic non sequitur that "Nobody with a good car needs to be justified" (p. II 3), Haze ignores the warnings of several mechanics that his car will soon stop for good. But the Essex does last long enough for Haze to use it to murder his "double," Solace Layfield, whom he runs down and then backs over in a grotesque parody of the car's usual lurching motion. If O'Connor intends for us to see Haze's motions on the train, in his car, or even on a ship headed around the world as absurd and analogous to the futile motions of caged animals, then there should be some specific scenes in Wise Blood involving animals that suggest this parallel: in fact there are three. While testing his new car out in the country, Haze becomes infuriated when he is blocked by a slow-moving truck carrying a crate "stuffed so full of wet barred-rock chickens that the ones facing him had their heads outside the bars" (p. 75). Here O'Connor drives home the point that imprisonment is possible even when one is moving. Moreover, as we have seen, humans have been described as birds throughout the novel. Soon Haze finds himself stopped in the middle of the road, reading a sign that says "Jesus saves." But Haze is not yet ready for this message, so he heads back toward Taulkinham in search of Enoch, having been reminded of the zoo by the crate of chickens. Enoch, he hopes, will lead him to another sort of bird, Asa Hawks. A bird figures in Haze's second encounter with caged animals. When his car breaks down on his "outing" with Sabbath, he walks to a gas station and sees a cage there labeled with a sign reading "Two Deadly Enemies": "There was a black bear about four feet long and very thin, resting on the floor of the cage; his back was</page><page sequence="10">The Zoo in O'Connor's Wise Blood 265 spotted with bird lime that had been shot down on him by a small chicken hawk that was sitting on a perch in the upper part of the same compartment. Most of the hawk's tail was gone; the bear had only one eye" (p. I25). In this passage, O'Connor unleashes her marvelous powers of black comedy and thematic compression. Symbolically, the two deadly enemies are, alternately, Haze and Sabbath or Haze and Asa Hawks. Haze, who is thin and wears a black hat, is the bear; the cage is his car. O'Connor will soon explicitly describe Haze's car as a kind of cage like the bear's, for Haze dreams he is trapped in the Essex while people file past and gawk at him, some showing "considerable reverence, like the boy from the zoo" (p. i6o), others laughing. Sabbath, in the first alternative, is the small chicken hawk; she shares its name and had hidden in the back seat of Haze's car in her efforts to prey on him sexually. As Haze had mused during their drive on the metaphysi- cal contradiction of Sabbath's admission she is Asa's "bastard" child, she had showered him with nonsense (the equivalent of the "bird lime" in the quoted lines) about her exchange of letters with an advice columnist. In the alternative reading, Asa is Haze's "deadly enemy," because he, unlike Haze, is insincere in his religious stance. When O'Connor writes that "most of the hawk's tail was gone," she alludes in a pun on "tale" to Haze's having gotten away in the previous chapter with one of Asa's two newspaper clippings-the one about his plan to blind himself at a revival. Haze does not know about the other clipping describing Asa's failure of nerve; yet, because he has plucked half of the Hawkses' "tale" and because he will soon pluck the other when he discovers Asa can see, Haze is symbolically the one-eyed bear who is half way toward the "victory" over Hawks of blinding himself. The last and most important scene suggesting the identity of humans and caged animals is Enoch's and Haze's visit to the zoo. O'Connor was fascinated by zoos, more for what they revealed about people than about animals. One of her classmates at the University of Iowa recalled: Her favorite place to go in Iowa City was out to the City Park. Once, I walked out there with her on an especially bleak February Sunday afternoon to look at the two sad and mangy bears, the raccoons, and the special foreign chickens they had. It seemed a particularly desultory thing</page><page sequence="11">266 American Literature to be doing, and I was puzzled at how completely absorbed and interested Flannery was that day looking at these things which I knew she'd looked at many times before. She was still working on the novel then, of course (which was to be Wise Blood), although she never talked about it, and I knew nothing at that time about the zoo and park scenes in that book until I read it a few years later.15 In part because of these visits to the Iowa City Park, the zoo became the controlling metaphor for the human condition in Wise Blood. This is clearly the case, for as Enoch drags the reluctant Haze past the animals' cages, O'Connor restates the principal images and themes of the novel. The idea that animals represent humans is reintroduced when the narrator records Enoch's observation that the beasts "were in a long set of steel cages like Alcatraz Penitentiary in the movies" (p. 82). Besides the stimulus of the films he has seen, Enoch has a more personal reason for thinking of humans when he sees the caged animals: his father is in prison. As Enoch and Haze file past the cages, they see "black shapes sitting or pacing" (p. 93). Here O'Connor makes a point vital to the central theme of the novel: some animals are reconciled to their captivity and react with a fatalistic passivity, while others remain restless and pace, though futilely. Most of the characters in Wise Blood are resigned to immobility, and are even happy in their imprisonment-one thinks of Leora Watts lounging in her bed or Mrs. Flood rocking on her porch, dreaming of her ideal life of sitting "by the radio all day, eating cake and ice cream, and soaking her feet" (p. 2 I 7). These women are like the bears in the first cage who look "like two matrons having tea" (p. 93). In contrast, Haze, caring nothing for "creature comforts," is still in rebellion against his imprisonment in a world devoid of meaning and so moves relentlessly. He is like a fierce jungle cat pacing endlessly in his cage; Sabbath even refers to him as "King of the Beasts" (p. I70). Indeed, he thinks of himself as one who hunts down his enemies: "This shiffer-robe belongs to Hazel Motes," he had written on his mother's sole remaining possession in their old house; "Do not steal it or you will be hunted down and killed" (p. 27). Later, from the hood of his Essex, he proclaims "Your conscience is a trick. . . . you had best get it out in the open and '5 Jean Wylder, "Flannery O'Connor: A Reminiscence and Some Letters," North American Review, 7 (I970), 6o.</page><page sequence="12">The Zoo in O'Connor's Wise Blood 267 hunt it down and kill it" (p. i66). All these ominous threats foreshadow Haze's tracking down and killing of Solace Layfield with his cat-like car, which "stood half over the other Prophet as if it were pleased to guard what it had already brought down" (p. 204). Haze and Enoch next pass the monkeys' cage, which Enoch hopes to hurry past in order to get to the museum more quickly. But he can't resist insulting one ape, nor can O'Connor resist foreshadowing his soon-to-come transformation into a gorilla, for she has him sneer, "Look at that ape. . . . If I had a ass like that . . .I'd sit on it" (p. 94). Besides his similarities to birds, bears, and jungle cats, Haze too is linked with apes. As he had prepared to bed Mrs. Watts, Haze's heart "began to grip him like a little ape clutching the bars of its cage" (p. 6o). Sabbath's remark about Haze's being "King of the Beasts" initially suggests he is a lion, but the movie poster's reference to Gonga as the "Giant Jungle Monarch" (pp. I77, I93) identifies Haze with the gorilla, and, by extension, with Enoch. Yet Haze, though linked with Enoch throughout the novel, is headed in a different direction than his parodic double, even though their divergence cannot occur until Haze sees that neither the "new jesus," Asa Hawks, his own blasphemous "Church of Christ without Christ," nor his car can help him escape from the prison of himself. Perhaps at last sensing his identity with the caged animals, Haze pauses in front of the final one-the emblem of wisdom, the owl. When Haze insists to it that "I am clean" (p. 95), the bird, symbolically denying the truth of his claim, closes its one eye and turns its face to the wall. Having come together at the zoo, in their closest approach to friendship and identity, Haze and Enoch now diverge and act out their respective climaxes. After seeing the mummy, Haze becomes infuriated by Enoch's incomprehensible stalling over giving him Hawks's address, and he finally hits Enoch over the head with a rock. The two never see each other alone again. Enoch later hears Haze preaching on the street about the need for a "new jesus," but after he steals the mummy and fails to gain any revelation from it he delivers it to Haze by way of Sabbath and begins his pursuit of Gonga. Entering his final enclosed place, the "paddy wagon"-like truck used to transport the "Jungle Monarch" between movie theatres, Enoch beats up the man dressed as Gonga and steals his gorilla</page><page sequence="13">268 American Literature suit. O'Connor, as she had with Haze's motions within the train at the beginning of the novel, shows Enoch's actions to be absurd by putting his furious battle inside the moving truck: "There came from the van certain thumping noises, but they were drowned out by the drone of the motor and the steady sound of the wheels against the road" (p. I95). Enoch leaps from the truck, runs into the woods, and completes his de-evolution by donning the ape suit. Yet while he in a sense may be correct in believing that the way to succeed in the modern world is to act like an animal, Enoch as Gonga fails to win the friendship for which he has been searching so desperately. When he sneaks up on a couple looking out over the city and offers his hand, they bolt in terror. The human animal has come to the limit of his freedom, and he symbolically finds himself alone in his cage; O'Connor writes that in the distance "the smokestacks and square tops of buildings made an uneven wall against the lighter sky" (p. I98). As Asals puts it, this wall "is both the silhouette of Taulkinham and the cage of man caught in matter." 16 Haze himself soon comes to the dead end of discovering the world is his prison. When a malevolent policeman pushes his car over an embankment, Haze's illusion of freedom, his ability to move, is gone. But Haze is now ready to begin learning, in O'Connor's words, that "freedom cannot be conceived simply." 17 As "his knees bent under him and he sat down on the edge of the embankment," Haze contemplates "the entire distance that ex- tended from his eyes to the blank sky that went on, depth after depth, into space" (p. 209). The embankment, like the door opening onto empty space in Haze's room out of which he had thrown the "new jesus," represents the limits of man's powers: the point past which reason fails him. Haze's car, the symbol of rational design, cannot take him where he wants to go. As Hawks had said to Haze the first time they met, "You can't run away from Jesus" (p. 5i). By the time the policemen asks Haze "Was you going anywheres?" Haze has finally learned the correct answer is "No" (pp. 209-IO). Yet while Enoch's gaze had stopped at the skyline of 16 Asals, p. 47. 17 "Author's Note" to Wise Blood.</page><page sequence="14">The Zoo in O'Connor's Wise Blood 269 Taulkinham, Haze's now penetrates deeper, into the heavens, the dimension of spiritual freedom. In order to see even deeper into that freedom, Haze blinds himself in the action epitomizing the series of Christian paradoxes that conclude Wise Blood. Before, he had insisted on going forward: now he understands he must go backward, into memories of his religious childhood, and eventually back to the transcendent moment in human history, Christ's birth in Bethlehem. Where he had previously run from enclosed places, he now imposes them on himself: limiting his movement by putting rocks in his shoes; wrapping barbed wire around his chest, symbolically fencing in the animal of his flesh; living in the ultimate prison of blindness. But these self-imposed limitations paradoxically lead to an expansion, for even the literal-minded Mrs. Flood can sense that her blind companion contains "the whole black world in his head and his head bigger than the world, his head big enough to include the sky and planets and whatever was or had been or would be" (p. 2i8). Haze's death at the hands of the police, keepers of the human zoo, is simply his final liberation from the cage of matter. In answering the objections of John Selby, the first editor to look at Wise Blood, O'Connor wrote that "I feel that whatever virtues the novel may have are very much connected with the limitations you mention."18 She also wrote that "vocation implies limita- tion."19 This notion that limits, whether self-imposed or circum- stantial, can paradoxically provide one with a liberating point of view was a hard truth O'Connor gained from the discipline of her art and faith and from the ordeal of her illness. When she had Haze develop a limp in his last days, she unknowingly foreshadowed her later crippling hip problems and suggested the extent to which she identified his struggle to attain spiritual liberation through physical constraints with her own. Although she would not encounter the works of Teilhard de Chardin until several years after finishing Wise Blood, O'Connor had already learned from her first bout with lupus about what the paleontologist / priest called "passive dimin- ishment"-the acceptance of an irreversible loss that leads to 18 The Habit of Being, p. i o. 19 The Habit of Being, p. 53.</page><page sequence="15">270 American Literature spiritual gain.20 In his idea of spiritual evolution, de Chardin saw man as struggling to break out of his animality and converge with God; but O'Connor, more cautiously, believed that "everything works toward its true end or away from it."21 In Wise Blood, Haze and Enoch embody that truth. 20 The Habit of Being, p. 509. 21 The Habit of Being, PP. 383, 350.</page></plain_text>
