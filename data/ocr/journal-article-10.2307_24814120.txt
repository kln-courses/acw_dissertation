Notes for a contextualized account of episcopal patronage SILVIA MUZZIN The recovery of a sculpted support with anthropomorphic endings in the walling of the Bishop's Palace in Novara, in its original place and function, makes it possible to rethink the Romanesque appearance of the building façade through the reconstruction of a small number of sculpted elements decorating it. The style of the support, rather inconsistent with the geo graphic context, and the dating of the walls, demonstrated by documents, suggest a possible comparison with the ambon of San Giulio d'Orta. The latter, thoroughly analyzed by scholars, who fail to agree on its chronology and style, has always been considered as a unique case. The juxtaposition with the sculpture of the Bishop's Palace could suggest further compar isons with other works from the same area, thus placing the ambon in the context of local Romanesque sculpture, which can in turn be connected to the Lombard and European production. Considerations on the influence of Maestri Campionesi on the work of Andriolo de* Santi ANNA SGARRELLA To this point, scholars have basically neglected to study the early forma tion, influences and models of Andriolo de' Santi, a Venetian sculptor doc umented between 1328 and 1375. The predisposition towards a strong characterization, expressiveness and rigorous realism points to the influ ence of the Masters from Campione. A series of comparisons makes it pos sible to suggest that the sculptor stayed in Lombardy and received such influence, particularly through the sculptures in the Loggia degli Osii in Milan. Andriolo might also have met Bonino da Campione, possibly in Cre mona: this could have driven the latter to work on the tombs of Jacopo II and Ubertino da Carrara, formerly in Sant'Agostino and currently at the Church of the Eremitani in Padua. Bonino's contribution to the two mon uments sculpted by Andriolo has been accounted for by scholars, who however attribute it to a later phase: based on stylistic considerations, the article suggests Bonino's intervention might be contemporary to An driolo's. Therefore, several other works by Bonino, similar to these and thought to be from the 1360s or early 1370s, could be dated back to the previous decade. On Giovanni Ambrogio Besozzi EUGENIA BIANCHI The article introduces a previously unpublished folder found in the Fondo Notarile (notarial archive group) of the Archivio di Stato of Milan, con taining several inventories of the assets belonging to Milanese painter Giovanni Ambrogio Besozzi and his family. The documents provide new information on this relatively unknown artist, as the records concerning his paintings reveal interesting facts about both his biography and, more importantly, his work, the places that saw his presence and his relation ships with fellow artists, collectors and dealers. The documents also attest that Besozzi and his brothers owned a flourishing crystal workshop within the parish of San Satiro in Milan: thus, the painter also had a commercial business, which makes him part of an interesting group of artists-dealers in late-17th-Century Milan, including names such as Giorgio Bonola and Giuseppe Zanatta, These documents also make it possible to re-order the previously known data about Besozzi's life and to suggest he was the author of a painting with the Birth of Mary from the storage of Brera. Giovanni Giuseppe Vagliano, a travel companion of Giovanni Ambrogio Besozzi ELISABETTA SILVELLO The article explores the close relationship between painter Giovanni Am brogio Besozzi (Milan, 1648-1706) and erudite Giovanni Giuseppe Vagliano (Milan, 1636-Domo Valtravaglia, 1721). Through his narrative and descriptive abilities, Vagliano was able to en dorse the artistic production of his contemporaries, devoting particular attention to the work of Besozzi. Some of his writings, attesting his talent as a critic, are here presented. Le Rive del Verbano (1710) entails a praise of the Borromeo's timing in updating their collection with the achieve ments of 17th-Century Milanese painting, while the Lettere Aceedemiche (1701-1720) show the author's passion for Besozzi's painting, manifested both in the long letter dedicated to the artist and in the description of an imposing group on twenty paintings destined to form an ideal 'Museum' of his work. As a marginal note of this relationship, several unpublished works by Be sozzi are here introduced, with the intention of attesting his contacts with the best artists active in Milan between the 17th and 18th Centuries. The name of Besozzi would eventually be remembered next to those of more famous and gifted painters, such as Lanzani or Legnanino. Vincenzo Volò as a still-life painter: His origins from Bourgogne and some aspects of his Milanese career GIANLUCA BOCCHI The historical figure of still-life painter Vincenzo Volò is finally salvaged from a 400-year-long oblivion, as the artist is given a precise place in the artistic milieu of mid-17th-Century Milan. Born in Franche-Comté, he fled his homeland, plagued by the Thirty Years' War, and arrived in Milan during the 1640s, disconnected from any artistic lineage. Inspired by Flemish painting, he produced several views of flower</page><page sequence="2">Riassunti | Abstracts arrangements, developing an individual style that won him the nickname Vincenzino dei fiori! He founded the first workshop in Milan specialized in still lives, passing on his style and cultural models to his children: Margherita, Francesca, Giovanna and Giuseppe adopted his patronymic and signed their works Vicencina', Vicenzina' and Vicenzino'. Some of his paintings are mentioned in the inventories of many families of the Milanese aristocracy: however, his most prestigious patron was un doubtedly Vitaliano VI Borromeo, who wanted him for the working site of his palace at Isola Bella. The artist's catalogue was reconstructed starting with the panels with flower vases in the Civic Museum of Cremona, and includes works made in collaboration with a specialist such as Evaristo Baschenis and other painters such as the Nuvolone family, Fumagalli and most importantly Francesco Cairo, whose friendship with Volò is documented by his partic ipation to the Baptism of one of the fellow painter's daughters. Giuseppe Sala, a master of 17th-18th-Century wood sculpture in Lombardy ALESSANDRA CASATI Wood sculpture in Lombardy between the mid-17th Century and the first decades of the 18th Century is a field in need of thorough exploration. In this context, the activity of the Sala family and their workshop in Pavia offers an ideal perspective for the analysis of the training and professional path of sculptors, the different skills available to patrons, the relationships with confraternities and vestry boards, as well as stylistic and iconographie preferences. The article specifically focuses on the early Milanese activity of Francesco Sala, before the workshop was moved to Pavia in the 1680s, and aims at reconstructing the catalogue of his son Giuseppe, who held an undisputed leadership in town until his death. Terracotta models for the statues in the Milan Duomo in the former half of the 16th Century PAOLA BOSIO The excavations made between via Broletto and via del Lauro in 1959 for the construction of a new building brought to the finding of several ob jects from the Roman age, but also of parts of terracotta statues dating from the Renaissance, as demonstrated through chemical and physical analyses. The fragments belong to two female figures dressed in antique fashion, whose technique of execution reminds fictile models for stone statues. Through a comparison with the corpus of early-14th-Century stat ues of the Milan Duomo, the author could spot precise similarities with three particular sculptures: a Judith with Holofernes' Head, a St. Lucy and a St. Agatha, the latter coming from Giovanni Antonio Amadeo's spire and almost identical, stylistically speaking, to St. Lucy, although smaller. Judith and St. Lucy have been tentatively attributed by scholars to Cristoforo So lari, who is documented as the author of clay models for the statues of the cathedral at the beginning of the 14th Century. Workforce and family bonds from the archive of the Vestry of the Como Cathedral. Matteo da Annone and his St. Sebastian MIRKO MOIZI Thanks to the discovery of a payment to Gaspare da Annone for a St. Se bastian sculpted by his son Matteo in 1522 for the Como Cathedral, the author could reconstruct the working relationship among the components of this family within the context of the same building site. The analysis of the records of the building shows the importance of the numerous work force coming from the town currently known as Annone Brianza, at least until the 1560s: the family workshops of Martino (initially together with his son Gaspare, then with the other son, Giovan Pietro) and Gaspare da Annone (together with his son Matteo, Francesco and Martino). The latter part of the article is dedicated to the St. Sebastian, so far at tributed by the majority of scholars to Cristoforo Solari, based on its mod erate neoclassicism. The author suggests an attribution to Matteo da Annone and identifies it with the sculpture located in one of the niches in the chapel of the Crucifix in the Como Cathedral. Such attribution makes it possible to associate Matteo and his father Gaspare's workshop with another sculpture, the St. Agnes placed in the niche next to the St. Sebastian, and very similar in style. Architecture and urban spaces in Spanish Lombardy. Antonio Maria Corbetta and the «beautiful design in modern style» for the Cathedral and main square of Voghera GIANPAOLO ANGELINI The Voghera Cathedral, re-founded in 1605, is one of the most important working sites of the former half of the century in Spanish Lombardy. The city council entrusted the project to Antonio Maria Corbetta from Bologna, who would later work as an architect for the "Veneranda Fabbrica' of the Milan Cathedral. Corbetta proposed a quincunx-shaped layout, which placed the Voghera Cathedral in the midst of a complex debate on cen tralized plans between the late 16th Century and the early decades of the 17th Century. The article reconstructs the building process, analyzes the projects and sketches out the question of the urban context surrounding the Cathedral. On still life in Bologna. Two addenda to the catalogue of 'pseudo-Vitali' MICHELE DANIELI The article addresses the activity of the anonymous painter known as 'pseudo-Vitali', who worked in Bologna between the 17th and the 18th Century. The author publishes two large still lives, among the most important works of the artist. Although his pseudonym manifests a similarity to the style of Candido Vitali, the painter's activity is earlier and his cultural horizon broader, ranging from Parma and Felice Boselli to Lombardy and Crivellone, another artist with whom he was often confused. The newly discovered paintings, placed in their proper time frame, reveal the painter's historical position as a link between the baroque legacy of Pier Francesco Cittadini and the 18th Century. 1730: a new façade for San Vittore in Meda. Archive findings on the working site of the monastery ELISA PONTIGGIA The church of San Vittore in Meda, with its façade built in 1730, is one of many examples of Lombard 'Barocchetto'. A series of previously unpub lished documents, found in the archive of the monastery of San Vittore - currently owned by the Antona Traversi family - and in the archive of the Veneranda Fabbrica del Duomo di Milano, makes it possible to reconstruct the facts about the building of the new façade, and identify most of the workforce involved in the project. The building process started thanks to a donation from two nuns, the 'Bi giogere' sisters, and the support of Abbess Elena Marianna Strada. The author of the decorations was probably Giovanni Battista Giudici (father of the better-known Carlo Maria), who sent them to Meda from his work 151</page><page sequence="3">Arte Lombarda shop in Viggiù; the statues on the façade are the work of Angelo Maria Beretta, Francesco Zarabatta, Carlo Rainoldi, Pietro Martire Sanctus, the well-known Elia Vincenzo Buzzi and a sculptor mentioned as 'Pagano', on whom only some hypothetical assumptions can be made. All these artists were active at the Duomo in Milan in the same years. Guglielmo della Porta's treatise: the rivalry with Vasary and the plagiarism of Tolomei and Ligorio STEFANO PIERGUIDI The importance of Guglielmo della Porta's letter to Bartolomeo Amman nati, dating from circa 1564-60, has been overlooked by most scholars. In the letter, which was meant to be diffused in Florence, the sculptor introduces himself as an art scholar and mentions a wide variety of sub jects. The author draws a survey of the history of painting and sculpture in Italy, divided into regional schools: a criterion that would be thor oughly developed forty years later by Giovanni Battista Agucchi. The artist also criticizes the strictly biographical character of Vasari's Lives, and announces the completion of a very ambitious work, a "short trea tise on many famous and valuable men in our arts", which should look up to the Lives. The author, however, proposes to use the project based on the knowledge of ancient Rome, suggested by Claudio Tolomei in 1542; in order to fulfill his task, Guglielmo wanted to use the vast ma terials collected by Pirro Ligorio in his manuscripts, recently sold to Alessandro Farnese. 152</page></plain_text>
