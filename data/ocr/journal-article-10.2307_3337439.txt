<plain_text><page sequence="1">f i r s t w o r d ART OR ARTS? Music may...be seen as a repetition of the world. Friedrich Nietzsche _T _here is a Pygmy legend of the Bird with the Most Beautiful Song. The bird was pursued by a boy, drawn into the deep forest by the beauty of its song. He found the bird and brought it back to camp to feed it. His father was annoyed at the idea of wasting food on a bird, but reluctantly gave in to his son's pleading. The next day the Bird sang the Most Beautiful Song again, and again the boy could not resist going into the forest and bringing it back to camp to be fed. The father was even more angry, but once again relented and fed the bird. The same thing happened on the third day. This time, how- ever, the father took the Bird from his son and sent him away. When he had gone, the father killed the Bird, the Bird with the Most Beautiful Song in the Forest. "With the Bird, he killed the Song, and with the Song he killed himself and he dropped dead, completely dead, dead forever." Colin Turnbull recounts this story in his cassic study of the Pygmies of the Ituri Forest to illustrate the identity of Song and Forest in Pygmy experience. Pygmies sing to awaken the forest, to make things right with the world when it seems out of kilter. For Turnbull, Pygmy song-above all the songs of the molimo, the long trumpet-held the key to understanding the secrets of Pygmy life. No matter that the trumpet was now a long section of metal drainpipe, pilfered from a nearby road construction site, rather than the hollowed-out bamboo of earlier times. What had initially shocked the anthropologist, always the arch-traditionalist, seemed in due time to be a perfectly sensible appropriation of a moder artifact. Unlike the coke bottle in The Gods Must Be Crazy, it did not signify the beginning of the end. Anyone who has listened to Pygmy music has heard at least a faint echo of the Bird with the Most Beautiful Song. My first encounter was in an unlikely spot: a rest house in ex- treme southwestern Uganda some twenty- five years ago. An elderly Pygmy played and sang on into the evening some of the most haunting melodies I have ever experienced. How he came to be so far from his homeland, I never learned. Many years later I heard a great deal more Pygmy music, this time more appropriately performed by whole groups of singers living among the Ekonda in the cen- tral Zairian rainforest. Indeed, the music of the Ekonda and other Bantu groups of the forest is heavily influenced by the poly- phonies of the Pygmies with whom they have so longed lived in a complex symbiosis that almost defies description.

But the centrality of music, in whatever form, in virtually all African cultures is so obvious that it should hardly need pointing out. Everyone at all familiar with Africa is aware that music accompanies the African from the cradle to the grave. Almost nothing hap- pens without music: "The African is born, named, initiated into manhood [or woman- hood], warriored, armed, housed, be- trothed, wedded and buried to music," in the words of the Ghanaian musicologist Kwabena Nketia, and he could have listed a great many more activities. Why then have "African arts" become virtually synonymous with visual arts and even more narrowly with sculpture? The title of this column, "First Word," should suggest sound before image, the spoken before the written word-all the more so since the journal's focus is on cultures of orality and aurality, where historically the visual rarely stands alone without its accompaniment of sound and movement. The creation of Pende masquerades begins, according to Zoe Strother, with a song and a dance; together music and dance dictate the form of mask and costume. "It is hard," she observes, "for Westerners to accept that the sculptor is the last stop in the invention process" (African Arts, Spring 1995). Sepa- rated from this whole ensemble, as so often happens in Western display and discussion, the mask makes no sense for Pende or any other culture. This is not to diminish the importance of the visual arts, only to plead for equal time for music and dance. It does not have to be a zero-sum game; in most cases, art forms enhance each other. Now, it may be argued that the print medium which does so well by the visual arts is intrinsically ill-suited to music and dance. That was not the perception of the founders of African Arts, who really intended the jour- nal to embrace all the arts. In the ambitious agenda outlined in the very first issue in 1967, the editors proposed to emphasize the graphic and plastic arts in each winter issue; music, dance, and cinema in the spring; and literature and theater in the summer. The autumn issue was to be a survey. For a while, they more or less followed this plan. The first issue, for example, contained an article on the African xylophone, mapping out the distrib- ution of its main forms. A subsequent article in the third issue discussed the "Politics of Music in Mali," pointing out the continuity between the time of Sunjata and the medieval Mali Empire and post-independence Mali in the mobilization of music and musicians for political ends. Another article even included musical notation as well as illustrations and verbal descriptions. In one early issue, Alan Merriam reviewed a series of recordings of African music launched by the Musee Royal de l'Afrique Centrale. african arts * winter 1996 8</page><page sequence="3">&amp; I Al ll :A r I,AI4I,INI.

He might have extended his complaint to the humanities and African art studies specifical- ly, for as time passed, music and other forms became less and less conspicuous both in African Arts and in other African studies venues. Indeed, during the past ten years, the visual arts have virtually monopolized the pages of African Arts. Perhaps people no longer submit artices on music and dance, but if so this may reflect a tacit acceptance of the hegemony of the visual arts, ceding the ground and the terminology. To be sure, it may also indicate that as the field has become more specialized, the other arts have acquired their own journals and forums. Research in African Literature dates back to 1970. Cinema has its outlets as well. In contrast, musicologists and music historians seem to have a harder time of it. The journal African Music appears to have been published only sporadically and has made little impact on the field. Mostly re- searchers look to periodicals in world music or ethnomusicology, which further isolates their work from others in the field of African studies. This is unfortunate in all respects, since it reinforces the arbitrary distinctions between the arts, sundering what should be joined together. To begin with, the division between music and sculpture is itself a false one. Not only does sculpture customarily function in a music and dance context, African musical instruments are themselves works of sculp- ture. Much African art is meant to sound, just as sounding instruments are meant to be looked at. The exhibition "Sounding Forms/Formes Sonores" in 1989-90 should have made that abundantly clear. Its selec- tion criteria emphasized precisely the sculp- tural qualities of instruments that seemed to have escaped the notice of most earlier ob- servers, perhaps because they fell in some no man's land between anthropology, art histo- ry, and ethnomusicology. The result was a visually stunning array of objects, most of them elaborating on the anthropomorphic themes common to other art forms in their cultures. Thus there were delicate Ngbaka and Mangbetu harps with their elongated heads; full-bodied Zande and Lunda sanzas, or thumb pianos; cast metal bells in the shape of human heads or torsos from the Lower Niger; idiophones topped with birds; and slit drums in the form of animals. The stylistic elements pro- vide not only a cultural signature but also a shorthand key to the role of music in re- producing-in every sense of the word-the social system. Music and the word fertilize human relationships just as water fertilizes the natural world, as Ogotemmeli explained to Griaule some thirty years ago. Fortunately, there are other encouraging signs that this unnatural absence of music from the Africanist mainstream may be end- ing. In 1989 the African Studies Center at UCLA in collaboration with Crossroads Press/ASA brought out the two-volume festschrift for J. H. Kwabena Nketia, African Musicology: Current Trends. While many of the essays are addressed to the specialist, the volumes also hold much of value for the generalist interested in the the field. The next step is for musicologists to aim occasionally for the untutored readership and to reach out to the other arts. Perhaps Hugh Tracey's wonderful book on Chopi musicians, now almost half a century old, could serve as a model. Note that it is subtitled "Their Music, Poetry, and Instruments." Would that it could be reissued with accompanying CD! Another promising sign is the increasing visibility of African music at professional meetings. It used to be that the serious scholarly work took place during the day, and music provided the entertainment in the evening, but, as Philip Peek noted in these pages in the Spring 1995 issue, there were a number of panels on ethnomusicol- ogy at the African Studies Association meet- ings in Toronto in 1994. It is encouraging, too, that ACASA (Arts Council of the Afri- can Studies Association) has been making a concerted effort to open up its membership to those involved with African music and to encourage more panels on music at its tri- ennial meetings. Most successful of all such endeavors, in my experience, was the recent Mande Studies Conference in Leiden. It included a double panel on Mande music (in which both African and Western scholars and musicians participated) along with a dou- ble panel on the material arts. Unlike so many meetings, panels were not concur- rent, so everyone could attend everything. There was, in fact, an evening of African music, but most of the performers were also participants on the panel. It was a delight to see an ensemble of musicians that blended Guineans, Malians, Austrians, Germans, Dutch, and Americans. All that mattered was that they could play and sing! In keep- ing with this spirit of artistic and scholarly ecumenism, the most recent newsletter of the Association offers brief reviews of re- cent recordings of Mande music. african arts * winter 1996 New England's Center for Traditional African Art: Masks, Figures, Textiles, Artifacts, Books HAMILL Gallery of African Art 2164 Washington St. / Boston, MA 02119 (617) 442-8204 M-Sat 10-6 httpJ:/www.arts-online.com/hamill.html _ ____ _- _w_ C__ ___~_~_ _ _ - ----------- -- . ----------- i---------III-II l _ | _ | E _ _ _ _ _ ___---S______L -=--_I-'-'u llE''Ud lrslRwl ..tS11</page><page sequence="4">A few years ago, an issue of Time maga- zine directed at college students featured the nation's most egregious gut courses. One of these was Robert Farris Thompson's introduction to African art at Yale. Why was it a gut? Because Thompson didn't just show slides, he also drummed and danced his lectures. Surely, anyone who used bongo drums couldn't be serious. Drums seem to raise the specter of Dionysian excess in American culture, just as they did for Nietzsche's audience, which had long been socialized to fear the appeal of music to the emotions. How remote this is from the African notion that drums impose con- trol on the most crucial rituals of human life. Far from creating chaos and disorder, music in African restores order precisely at those moments when the potential for dis- integration is greatest. This is the function of the molimo songs of the Pygmies, just as it is of the Bambara harp to which the musi- cian whispers: "Now it is your turn; orga- nize the world." In fact, Thompson has always refused to talk about African plastic arts in a vacu- um. His pioneering exhibition, "African Art in Motion" (1973), was the first major attempt to contextualize African sculp- ture, to combine sculpture with costume and to re-create sample environments in which it functioned. He was one of the first, if not the first, to use video in the field so that we could see how objects were danced and, just as important, so that African audiences could see their own and others' cultural forms and comment on them. Thompson came to African art history via music, so his special sensitivity to the inextricable ties that unite the arts is understandable. But even if most of us can never hope to match his musicianship, we can at least learn from his example and that of his students. Ideally, too, one would hope that innova- tive experiments combining print and other media might be expanded-like the cata- logue of Tsogho arts and crafts published by the Musee des Arts et Traditions du Gabon and ORSTOM in 1975, which included a 45- rpm record of Tsogho music, or John Miller Chernoff's African Rhythm and African Sen- sibility (1979), with its illustrative audio- cassette, or Margaret Thompson Drewal's Yoruba Performance, which was paired with a videotape. Can such packages become more feasible and affordable as CD and CD-ROM technology is perfected? A recent book on romantic music by Charles Rosen could be a harbinger of things to come: it includes a CD of Rosen playing works he discusses in his text. In the meantime, let us at least have more reviews of music re- cordings and videotapes in Africanist pub- lications and include more such material in bibliographies. And may drums continue to reverberate within the ivied walls of Yale. Whether drain- pipe or bamboo trumpet, we still need to hear the sounds of Africa.
