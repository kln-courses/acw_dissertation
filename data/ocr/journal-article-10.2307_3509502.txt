<plain_text><page sequence="1">YES, 34, 2004 fraught with pitfalls. In response, Burwick offers us the possibility of a more inclu- sive, comprehensive definition of 'imitation' within a Romantic context, one which includes the mind's own workings: 'The rise of individualism, a major factor in the political turmoil of the age, was also manifest in the literary exploration of the individual consciousness and the individual experience. The paradox, of course, was that the very self-assessment crucial to the social changes then taking place would be appraised by critics of subsequent generations as self-indulgent escapism' (p. Io). By widening the scope of Romantic mimesis from 'what' the mind beholds, to 'how' it beholds, Burwick opens up a groundbreaking, comparative discussion of how the post-Kantian German philosophers were influential in the construction of a British Romantic aesthetic. The first three chapters examine the ideas of I'art pour I'art (going back to the cross-cultural first use of the phrase in 1804), idem et alter (dif- ference as an essential marker of the artist's transforming activity), and palingenesis of mind as art respectively. Burwick's direct engagement with the first texts in which Schleiermacher, Schelling, Hegel, Coleridge, and De Quincey articulated their thoughts is particularly refreshing, and it draws attention to the dangers of reductive reading in later interpretations. The final three chapters offer further explorations of the persistent presence of mimesis as a major issue in Romantic texts. Chapter 4 focuses on ekphrasis, on how the mimetic process itself can be the object of mimesis, illustrated by an exceptionally penetrating reading of De Quincey's 'Dream Fugue' in The English Mail Coach. Chapter 5 casts new light on Coleridge and Wordsworth by an emphasis on how 'optical reflection [...] is a model for visual perception as well as an analogue of mental reflection' (p. 148). The final chapter explores 'three novels of the romantic period which develop their irony through a structural bifur- cation that exposes the mimetic pretense of the storytelling' (exemplified in Charles Brockden Brown's Arthur Mervyn, E. T. A. Hoffmann's Kater Murr, andJames Hogg's Confessions of a Justified Sinner). However troubled, tormented, or neurotic the Romantics' engagement with the whole idea of mimesis might have been at times, they did make a convincing aesthetic out of the mimetic predicament. Burwick puts it splendidly: 'If occasionally in a perverse pique or an ironic gesture they attempted to shatter one mirror or the other, it was only with the result that every splinter remained to catch new reflections' (p. i5). A warmly recommended study. VICTORIA UNIVERSITY OF WELLINGTON, NEW ZEALAND HEIDI THOMSON Romanticism and the Materiality of Nature. By ONNO OERLEMANS. Toronto, Buffalo, NY, and London: University of Toronto Press. 2002. vii + 253 pp. $45; f28. ISBN: 0-8020-4863-3. Given the title and the topic of this book, the assertion that 'romanticism is an important origin for environmentalist thought' should probably come as no surprise. That does not make it accurate. Possibly, indeed probably, for some readers Romantic literature is the origin of their 'strong interest' in descriptions of the external world and even perhaps their 'environmentalist thought', but let us not make the mistake of thinking such interest sprang into being in the Romantic period. More than enough has been written about medieval landscapes and Renais- sance forests to correct such misapprehension. What ecocriticism does, and here Onno Oerlemans's book is on sounder ground, is to offer a newer, more rigorous 257</page><page sequence="2">examination of the human fascination with the non-human, natural world. This quibble aside, the introduction offers a useful summary of ecocriticism to date and issues a most welcome plea for something 'harder-edged' to carry us forward. Foremost is the repeated focus on the actual, tangible things that constitute 'nature', recognition of which is a salutary corrective to the habit of taking refuge in the declaration that 'nature' is just a concept. Of course, to some extent it is a concept, and the descriptions of the external world that form the focus of this book necessarily reflect the prevailing concepts, even if they also seek to refine them. That is not contested here, but Oerlemans is justified in repeatedly returning us to the 'materiality of nature' that underpins the concepts and descriptions. Indeed, the strength of this book is that the inevitable discussions of the Wordsworths (William more than Dorothy), Shelley, and Coleridge appear alongside engaged and illumi- nating sections on travel writing and natural history, figuring less familiar names, such as Erasmus Darwin, and William Gilpin. Nor is Oerlemans bound solely to the Romantic period when dealing with theory; there is more than a nod towards twentieth-century and current debates, with some sharp criticism (and due praise) levelled at feminism in particular as well as passing reference to, for example, Todorov. Generally the pattern of the chapters is: reiteration of the themes of this book, followed by a more generalized discussion of the chapter's particular topic, followed by illustrative consideration of particular authors and texts. It is a decent enough pattern, which allows White and Clare to counterbalance the prevalent desire for categorizing, and lets Shelley's vegetarian- ism be understood as a political and philosophical conviction, not just a fad. There is also a welcome admission of Wordsworth's sentimentality and a telling encap- sulation of Clare's distinctive observation of the desire of all animals (and some humans) 'to be secure in a secluded spot'. The thorny issue of anthropomorphism is duly tangled with, and Oerlemens is surely right to point out that both the concept of anthropomorphism and its prohibition are inherent feature of anthropocentrism: the chances are there is no way out of that particular ecocritical thicket. Overall, there is much to appreciate here as well as a certain amount to irritate, but that is no harm - Oerlemans is right in desiring a harder edge to ecocriticism and such edges will tend to irritate. My only regret applies to ecocriticism in general, as much as to this book, which is the loss of one of feminism's early mantras - that of different, but equal. It is proving difficult indeed to maintain that ideal hierarchies will creep in: the prevalence of Wordsworth throughout this book and the initial assertion of the Romantics' originary status are evidence of this, as is the habit of having his literary figures emerge as heroes of particular chapters and the final, almost predictable, move to Thoreau's Walden.
