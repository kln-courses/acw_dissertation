<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGION IN AMERICAN CUL- TURE. By W. Widick Schroeder and Victor Obenhaus. New York: The Free Press of Glencoe, 1964. 254 pp. $7.95. Schroeder and Obenhaus have produced a book which is valuable for what it attempts, in- teresting in a number of its findings, and in- structive in what this reader regards as serious shortcomings. The authors set themselves a difficult and important task: to survey the nature and social consequences of the religious situation in an entire country. Their work and Lenski's are in part parallel and thus provide complement- ary pictures of the religious factor in the life of a city and in that of a town and rural area. My complaint, made in some detail later, is that Schroeder and Obenhaus have not made full use of the potentialities in the method they chose and thus have weakened their analysis and failed to reflect the richness of the data they gathered. The investigation was undertaken primarily to identify the correlates of affiliation with dif- ferent denomimations and different major reli- gious traditions. Knowing the historic lines of cleavage on beliefs and values, the authors are asking whether denominational and tradi- tional identifications still make a difference. The book is divided into four parts: church partici- pation patterns and attitudes toward one's own and other religious groups; cognitive structures, that is biblical knowledge, theological under- standing, and political-economic orientations; conceptions of the role of ministers; and psy- chological characteristics. The study was designed to be more than a description of the religious situation in the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 313 Illinois county studied. Probability sampling was used to select the respondents fiom three towns and two open-country townships. The particular country was selected at least partly because of evidence that it typifies its Corn Belt region in a number of economic charac- teristics and in addition has experienced the industrialization, urbanization, and ethnic as- similation found in other parts of the country. The book title reflects the authors' feeling that data based on a representative sample of county residents should reveal significant tendencies not only in the Corn Belt but also in the nation. The data were gathered primaiily by inter- view using a schedule which involved quite different techniques in different parts of the investigation. Most of the material on religious beliefs and feelings (biblical knowledge, theolo- gical understanding, reasons for religious behav- ior, and conceptions of the minister's role) was secured through open-ended questions. Judging by the illustrative quotations given, the authors gathered some extremely valuable information capable of i evealing not only the respondents' levels of formal biblical and theological knowl- edge but also their general religious perspec- tives. In contrast the data on political-economic osientations were gathered mostly through five forced-response questions less sophisticated in approach than the questions on religious matters. The material on the psychological correlates of religious affiliation is of a different order and to my mind of questionable value. The authors have excellent theoretical reasons for undertaking a psychological investigation and they make the reasons clear. However, they have based their assessment of nine complex psychological attributes on protocols from three TAT cards interpreted by a single dia- gnostician. Granted the difficulty of finding instruments suitable to the investigation of personality characteristics in a single inter- view, I still question the advisability of using a projective instrument at all if resources can- not permit the use of more stimuli and at least two diagnosticians. On one level the authors' findings can be summarized by saying that the people of Corn County were highly identified with organized Christianity but that they were grossly ignorant of the theological traditions to which they were heirs and apparently found little relationship between their religious Identification and the rest of their lives. The major Christian tradi- tions apparently had not been preserved well enough for denominational or traditional iden- tifications to make any important differences. Adherents of different denominations, and com- binations of denominations grouped according to major traditions, showed only minimal dif- ferences in their levels of biblical and theological knowledge, their political-economic orienta- tions, and their assessed personality traits. The authors interpret the lack of difference in political-economic orientations as showing that there was "no clear theoretical understand- ing [of the issues] related to theological tradi- tion." (p. 182) The conceptions of the minis- ter's role were simialry unrelated. They were vague and internally inconsistent in all groups but agreed in showing a widespread feeling that pleasant personal qualities were among the most important matters to be considered. On another level of consideration the matter of findings is less clear. The foregoing summary implies acceptance of the authors' methods of analysis and it is here that I have severe re- servations. The categories used in analysing many of the materials in religious beliefs and feelings and the failure to carry analyses far enough are both sources of disappointment in this potentially important study. Taken together these weaknesses support the suspi- cion that valuable findings may have been lost in the course of the investigation. An extended example from the portion of Chapter 3 entitled "Theological Understanding and Re- ligious Life" (pp. 118-156) will illustrate the criticism. Response to the question, "If a child asks you what God is like, what would you say?", were classified as traditional characterizations, quasi-anthropomorphic responses, characteri- zations by reference to attributes, quasi-psy- chological and relational responses, and miscel- laneous other answers. Explicit references to such doctrinal descriptions as omnipotent ("God is all powerful"); trinity, and supreme being were classified as traditional whereas responses such as spirit, ci eator, lord, governor of the</page><page sequence="3">314 BOOK REVIEWS universe, prefect, and judge were classified as characterizations by reference to attributes. The latter was the most frequent form of descrip- tion. All the characterizations given by each respondent were coded but there was no at- tempt to classify respondents in terms of the particular configurations they used. The au- thors report that respondents in all categories of status, sex, intellectual ability, denomina- tion, and type of church participation most frequently mentioned love and spirit as charac- teristics of God and only very infrequently saw Him as judge. They go on to say, "It appears that a Pelagian notion of sin was a dominant one. A God who judges man, both in his de- fiance of structures and in his idolatrous ac- tivity seemed to be remote to the idea of mos Corn County church members. . . " (p. 138) In the surrounding discussion the authors consider the historic differences in theological traditions in emphasis on divine judgment and redeeming love transcending judgment; they are also interested in whether the people most deeply involved in church activities have the best grasp of their church's theology. Clearly the investigators were not primarily interested in the verbal style of the respondents or the extent of anthropomorphism; they were in- terested in (1) the adequacy with which con- temporary churches have communicated the basic Christian conception of God and (2) the extent to which contemporary people reflect the historic differences in emphasis found in different Christian traditions. This investigation at a minimum requires a classification system with mutually exclusive categories along clearly distinguished dimen- sions and an analysis based on the configura- tions of ideas expressed about God. The coding categories and form of analysis actually used could not reveal the matters under investi- gation. There is also the possibility that the responses were biased by the request for a characterization tailored to a child's under- standing. There is the additional problem that analyses are often not carried far enough. I do not mean that the authors fail to "control" crucial varia- bles. They are consistently careful in checking that possible differences among religious group- ings are neither the result of nor obscured by differences in age, sex, or status distributions. However, they often state a finding and per- haps give a plausible interpretation of it but fail to relate-findings whose relationship would be of theoretical interest or to check on the possibility that there are other equally persua- sive interpretations. One matter of form annoys the conscientious reader enough to deserve comment. Many of the more complex tables are set up in such a way that the comparisons required by the text are difficult to make. In addition, tables often lack the conventional indications of the direc- tion in which the percentages have been com- puted. (See, for example, Tables 11 and 12, pp. 40 and 41) A few minutes with pencil and paper convince the reader that the tables do add and that tables and text agree, but this sort of extra work should not be the reader's responsibility. My complaints about this book have been made with directness and in some detail be- cause I think that they relate to a serious and growing problem. Studies which apply the techniques of the social sciences to the investiga- tion of religious phenomena involve difficult relationships among substantive knowledge, technical sophistication, and methodological clarity. The authors of the work under review are aware of the methodological problem and deserve congratulation for their attempt to present their findings in ways that will make them useful to readers of different methodolog- ical persuasions. However, the problem of equal levels of substantive and technical knowledge remains. Applying survey techniques to com- plicated investigations requires a high order of technical skill and analytic flair if one is to escape the routinizing tendencies inherent in mass data handling. In the instance at hand the presentations of historic theological tradi- tions and laymen's conceptions of the ministerial role, for example, have a sureness and clarity far above that evident in discussions requiring highly skillful analysis of survey data. If sur- vey research into religious phenomena is to approach its potential contribution, we may need to find new means of aiding close consulta- tion among scholars with common interests</page><page sequence="4">BOOK REVIEWS 315 but differences in their areas of substantive knowledge and technical skill.
