<plain_text><page sequence="1">ERIC/RCS REPORT I Animals in Literature I Holly O'Donnell If we look through all the stories we read as children, undoubtedly we will find one that features animals. Whether it is in Bambi, Black Beauty, or one of those countless Mother Goose rhymes, certainly an animal is featured. Why so many ani- mals? According to Bettelheim in Joan Abrams' paper [ED 153 220], "there is so much animal symbolism in children's lit- erature because children identify more closely with animals than with adults." Animals impress children at all ages. Ar- buthnot and Sutherland in Children and Books explain, "Mother Goose is sup- plemented by the more realistic animal picture books." With these books children learn to name all the beasts under the sun. From these, children progress to more complex realistic stories about animals. Charles Peterson in his dissertation, "A Study of Library Books Selected by Sec- ond Grade Boys and Girls in the Iowa City, Iowa Schools" [ED 067 636], notes that the three specific subjects most fre- quently selected by boys and girls are fantasy stories about animals, fanciful humorous stories, and modern fantasy stories about people. Language Arts • Vol. 57, No. 4 • April 1980 451</page><page sequence="2">This article will examine some charac- teristics of animal stories, types of animal portrayals, and the continuing interest children have in animal stories and con- clude with some suggested booklists that can direct the reader to animal stories. Animal stories seem to be characterized three ways. According to Smith and Park in Word Music and Word Magic: Chil- dren's Literature Methods [ED 137 820], whether written for younger or older chil- dren, stories portray: 1) animals that be- have like human beings; 2) animals that act like animals but talk; and 3) animals that act like animals behaving true to their scientific nature. Markowsky in her article, "Why Anthropomorphism in Children's Lit- erature?" [EU 124 043] similarly catego- rizes stories about animals into stories that tell of animals that dress and act like people, stories in which animals talk but otherwise act naturally, and stories in which animals are objectively described. Arbuthnot, in Children and Books, uses the groupings: "Ourselves in fur," "Ani- mals as animals, but talking," and "Ani- mals as animals." Anthropomorphism is evident in the first two categories. Animals in the first cate- gory often display human foibles. As Ar- buthnot and Sutherland point out, "In the stories about Babar by Jean and Laurent de Brunhof and Ferdinand by Munro Leaf, in Dr. Seuss's Horton Hatches the Egg and Michael Bond's Paddington, these absurd animals are doubly funny because they parody the people we know." These stories are primarily of interest to younger children, those who are three to seven years old. Those stories that fall under the "Ani- mals that act like animals but talk" cate- gory appeal to children, according to Abrams [ED 153 220], because "The child expects answers from things that arouse curiosity; and because he is self- centered, he expects animals to talk about things that are important to him." Juliet Markowsky cites several other reasons children are attracted to these stories: 1) young readers are able to identify with animals- which otherwise stripped of all human trappings of speech and clothing may or may not be familiar to the child; 2) animals that talk can let children in on another world, which they may not be able to see without the animals' help; 3) an au- thor can develop a great variety of charac- ters in a short book with few words if an animal is used to express attributes com- monly assumed to represent the creature; and 4) animals who are caricatures of cer- tain types of people are funny to adults and children alike. Animals can represent many aspects of human personality, as discussed by Abrams in her analysis of Mother Goose rhymes based on Bettelheim's theory [ED 152 220]. For example, the cow in fairy- tale metaphor represents the mother im- age. Bees are always female and repre- sent hard work and sweetness and are, therefore, a symbol of maturity. The cat, also female, is a symbol for a valuable, loveable, clean, hard-working mother who is quite mature. Abrams goes on to say, "Those (animals) used to show a coarser side of one's nature appear as snails, frogs, and pigs, and birds of prey. Those animals that show the super ego and adult sides of one's nature seem to be mostly birds (especially robins and sparrows), cats, and hens and bees. Animals that re- late to little boys may be pigs, frogs and snails, dogs and blackbirds." She further speculates that helpful animals represent one's natural energy, that pigs represent the instinctual side of one's personality and that dangerous and destructive ani- mals symbolize the id. Whatever symbolic representation animals might have, animal stories have remained a constant source of enjoyment for children. Roger Sale in Fairy Tales and After [ED 452 Language Arts</page><page sequence="3">163 499] calls the use of animals in chil- dren's literature the strongest link between fairy tales and modern written children's literature. "They are present in most chil- dren's literature, ancient and modern, and they are the major source of the power of the best children's literature, a power that other kinds of literature had abandoned and forgotten well before the nineteenth century." While animals in fairy tales, nursery rhymes, fables, or other young children's stories parody human conditions, animal stories that appear in the third category (animals that act like animals) are of par- ticular interest to children from age seven or eight to maturity. Arbuthnot and Suther- land state that these stories are in the majority and, on the whole, the most popu- lar type of animal books with children over seven or eight. In these stories children find themselves spectators of a humorous or tragic or dramatic series of events that they cannot always fathom. There is also an element of uncertainty to these books that make them more excit- ing than other stories for children. Despite their popularity, Jean McClure Kelty warns that these stories may also contribute to stereotypes for boys, especially reinforc- ing the notion that boys need to proceed through some ritual before being initiated into manhood. Kelty uses The Yearling and Old Yeller as examples in which kill- ing the pet is a ritual killing. The killing of a wild animal is portrayed in such stories as Windigo, The Loner, and Call It Cour- age. Similarly, books that portray animals as symbols of evil or of nature to be con- quered, pitting a young man against that force, to win or lose, are exemplified by Moby Dick and The Old Man and the Sea. However, as Smith and Park [ED 137 820] point out, "Reactions to animal stories in all categories have been mixed as to their value to children. This is prob- ably due to the fact that the children's book market has been flooded with many books in which animals talk and are en- dowed with other human characteristics, books that tend to be trite and oversen- timental ize the animal hero." Or, they are criticized for providing children with false impressions of animal life. Valid as some of these criticisms might be, they are not enough to change the status or joy ani- mals hold for children. Many of the sources used for this article discuss animal stories from different points of view. Creative Growth through Literature for Children and Adolescents [ED 1 1 3 707] examines animal stories for early adoles- cent years, for middle school years, for early school years, and for preschoolers. Children Experience Literature [ED 087 025] presents stories that use animals in fairy and folktales, in fantasy, films and re- cordings about animals, humorous stories about animals, animals in picture-story books, and stories that involve an animal as the major character. Children and Books identifies adult references in animal stories, discusses types of animal stories, de- scribes some criteria for judging animal stories, and provides a bibliography. There are several booklets that suggest appealing animal stories: B-J Paperback Book Guide, Volume 1, Number 1. (1975) [ED 109 709] The pur- pose of this guide is to suggest to English teachers and librarians paperback books for young adults in junior and senior high school. The books deal thematically with such topics as adventure, alienation, ani- mals, careers, family relations, mystery/ suspense, nonfiction, religion, science fic- tion, social problems, war, and woman's status. Your Reading: A Booklist for Junior High Students. Fifth Edition. (1975) [ED 112 425] This edition contains annotations for over 1,500 publications in the fiction and nonfiction categories and presents animal stories under the nonfiction section. ERICIRCS Report: Animals in Literature 453</page><page sequence="4">The World of Books for Children: A Par- ent's Guide. (1979) [ED 166 176] This book provides an annotated list of over 2,000 children's books by 1,200 authors. Organized according to age levels, each chapter provides standard bibliographical citation, discussions of child develop- ment, norms for evaluating books, and suggested activities for each set of books. As Smith and Park remind us, "because of the wide coverage of topics in animal stories, they continually place children in new places where exciting things happen and where they learn about life." If you have developed any interesting units or discussions related to animals in chil- dren's literature, we encourage you to submit them to the ERIC system so that others may share your information.
