<plain_text><page sequence="1">TWO IRON-SMELTING FURNACES FROM THE CHIBI NATIVE RESERVE, SOUTHERN RHODESIA K. R. ROBINSON Chief Inspector, Historical Monuments Commission, Southern Rhodesia An iron-smelting furnace from the Matopo hills was described by C. K. Cooke (1959, pp. 118-20) about two years ago. Therefore it may be of interest to record examples from another area of Southern Rhodesia, an area which has never been settled by the Matabele and is within the boundaries of Mashonaland. On the other hand, according to local native traditions, the country which today forms the Chibi Native Reserve has experienced to the full the ebb and flow of tribal migrations, and the striving for power of rival chieftains prior to the coming of Mzilikazi. Nor did this country escape altogether from Matabele raids, but there appears to be no evidence of prolonged occupa- tion by Nguni people. With regard to pre-Mzilikazi times, there is reason to believe that the present inhabitants, living under Chief Chibi and known as the VaMari of the lion totem, are descended from a group of Manyika people who came down from the Mtoko area during the early years of the last century. These people, led by one Tavengegweyi, eventually drove out the old Makaranga inhabi- tants of the country who were known as the Vangowa. The archaeological evidence bears witness to at least five successive Iron Age occu- pations of the area, commencing with early Zimbabwe type material including 'stamp wares'. Iron smelting was practised from the beginning, therefore furnaces of various ages may be dis- covered, but the earlier ones are unlikely to have survived in a complete state under normal conditions. Description of Site The site consists of a low but extensive ant- heap (termite mound) located approximately 6 miles west of the native commissioner's office, immediately west of Gomanye Hill. At first sight both the furnaces, which are only 2 feet apart, appear to be normal features of the antheap, but closer examination revealed their artificial nature. One of the furnaces is better preserved than the other (fig. I B), and this I decided to clean out and describe in detail. The other furnace, A, is almost certainly identical with B, but it might prove difficult to remove the deposit within it without serious damage to the structure. About 10 yards west of the furnaces there is a patch of iron slag some 6 feet in diameter, while a few yards to the south there is a small water- course which at the time of discovery was dry (during drought conditions). It is probable that this feature normally holds water as it has its source high up on the rocky slopes of Gomanye Hill. There can be little doubt that the iron smelters obtained their water from this supply. Thick bush surrounds the site which is also par- tially protected by rocks. Description of Furnaces The plan of both furnaces is shown in figure 1, and a cross-section through furnace B in figure 2. x V ENT INTERIOR DIMENSIONS /DEPRESSION BROKEN EDGE OF CHIMNEY WALL CHARCOAL SCALE IN FEET FIG. 1 It has already been remarked that furnace A was not cleaned out because of the danger of damage to the daga superstructure. This danger was present but to a lesser degree with regard to furnace B. The interior was filled up with ant- heap having the consistency of rubber which was extremely difficult to remove. The work was eventually completed by the use of a 4-pound hammer and iron spike. Plate IA shows the decorated front intended to represent the torso of a woman, and may be compared with the type of furnace illustrated from the Matopo hills by Cooke (1959, p. 119). The present height above ground-level of furnace B is about 2 feet, and there is no reason to believe that it was ever more than about 6 inches higher. Complete excavation was not possible in view of a desire to preserve the furnace. The base of the furnace appears to have been excavated in the antheap and then lined with daga, after which the super- structure, also of daga, was added. The vent at the rear probably allowed the introduction of a 20</page><page sequence="2">clay blowpipe or pipes connected to bellows, which, as in the furnace described from the Matopos, may have been worked on the surface of the antheap behind the furnaces. It is possible that the furnaces may have been joined by a slight wall of daga which has subsequently been buried by termite workings, but there is at present no evidence of this. The front opening was used for the introduction of the iron ore and fuel, while the superstructure acted as a chimney. The circular depression in front of the main opening was formed, in all probability, for convenience when filling or tending the furnace. A section of charred stick was recovered from the floor of the front opening. A slight depression can be noted at the lowest point in the furnace floor (fig. 2), and from this came a roughly circular piece of slag. Judging from its weight this contains some iron. No other finds were recovered from within the furnace with the exception of small pieces of slag and charcoal. Apart from the fact that furnace A is less well preserved than B there appear to be no structural differences between the two furnaces, and both were originally decorated in a similar manner. Decoration In Plate IA the decorated front of furnace B is shown clearly except for the breasts which have been partially broken away. Immediately below these features there is a small, well-defined pro- tuberance which is probably the umbilicus. Almost immediately below this there is a slightly raised circular boss at the base of which there are four deep vertical grooves about 3 inches in length representing the genital organs. Flanking both protuberances there are the remains of six horizontal grooves. Plate IB shows a modern smelting furnace which was built at the Centenary Exhibition, Bulawayo, in 1953. The men respon- sible came from the Charter district. Bent (1893 p. 308) illustrates the 'breast and furrow' pattern as occurring on an iron-smelting furnace and he actually saw this type of decoration still in common use near Zimbabwe. With regard to furnace B, the top of the chimney has completely collapsed, therefore it is impossible to know whether or not there was any decoration at this point as shown in Plate IB. Conclusions There is no definite evidence for dating these furnaces. Recent-looking potsherds (nineteenth century or later) were noted on the banks of the watercourse, however, and as no other occupa- tional material was discovered in the immediate vicinity these sherds are a pointer. On the other hand, earlier Iron Age sites exist not far away, therefore although an earlier date for the furnaces is unlikely it is not impossible. In discussing the type of furnace one is handi- capped by lack of comparative material. There are several differences between these Chibi furnaces and the one described by Cooke (1959, p. 119). Such as the manner in which the former are excavated into the antheap, and the absence of flanking walls of stone or daga. Plate IB may also be compared on these points. Further, furnace B possesses, although in a very modified form, a feature which attains to considerable proportions in the furnaces examined at Inyanga (Summers 1958, p. 114), i.e. a circular depression in the floor which presumably acted as a sump for the molten iron. In the present instance a 4Ft. CHIMNEY X UNEXCAVATED ENTRANCE ANTHEAP ANTHEAP DAGA CHARCOAL SLAG FIG. 2 circular disk of slag mixed with iron was recovered from this depression. It may be of significance that, as has already been mentioned, the VaMari claim Manyika origin. Female symbolism seems to be a common feature of most if not all African furnaces. Looking at figure 1, the effect of legs produced by the front opening when seen from above is noticeable. Cooke (ibid.) mentions a photograph of a furnace from Inyanga taken by Mr. F. 0. Bernhard which shows a naked female figurine with legs apart perched on the chimney. Infor- mation obtained by me from an old inhabitant in the Matopo district indicates that during smelting operations neither women nor children were allowed near the furnaces. In Uganda (Lanning 1954, pp. 167-9) it was at one time the custom to make, in clay, imitations of the male and female genitalia. These were then fixed to the clay blowpipes leading from bowl-shaped bellows, also of clay. One of the bowls, the smaller, was regarded as the male, and the other the female. These clay bellows had a top made of goatskin. We are not told what type of furnace was employed, but it may have resembled the type of furnace used by the Lovale tribe in north-western Rhodesia (Clark, 1959, p. 306), who also make clay bowls as bases for 21</page><page sequence="3">their bellows. Although the type of bellows known in Southern Rhodesia up to a few years ago was made entirely of goat-skin and had no clay base, they were, nevertheless, probably often used in pairs. Finally, why were two furnaces built together? It is possible that one of them may have been used to refine already smelted but impure iron; on the other hand both may have been for smelting ore. Whatever the truth of this matter it is obvious that time and labour would be saved by having more than one furnace in the same place. It is very probable that sites containing more than two furnaces will turn up. REFERENCES Bent, J. T. 1893. The Ruined Cities of Mashonaland. Longmans, Green &amp; Co., 2nd ed. Clark, J. D. 1959.
