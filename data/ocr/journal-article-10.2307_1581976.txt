<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE BY HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY The eponym of the Tushingham plaque is Director A. Douglas Tushingham, formerly of the American School of Oriental Research in Jerusalem, but presently of the Royal Ontario Museum in Toronto. In the Spring of 1953 the plaque was acquired from the famous Ohan Collection at the Muristan in Jerusalem. Most recently it has been incorporated into the well-selected Case Archaeological Col- lection at the University of Chicago. The plaque (Plate I) is a moderately thin but solidly formed ar- chitectural panel of hard baked clay, superfine in texture and softly tan in color. Coloristically it is pleasingly modulated in pastel shades. Much pigment, in simple decorative schemes of red and yel- low and blue, still adheres to the surface of the artifact. In architectonic terms the panel consists of a substantial rectan- gular podium or base crowned by a perfectly semicircular conch, with a steep gable superimposed thereon. The podium is three and one-half inches wide and two and one-half inches high. The gable, at the protruding outer corners, is three and three-fourths inches wide. From the peak of the gable to the bottom of the base, the panel measures five and three-fourths inches high. The rectangular base is framed in substantial strips of clay that are closely striated in a simply diversified fashion: diagonally across the side pieces and along the length of the base beam, and vertically across the long top strip. These notwide earthen strips are so firm as to give the impression of quite solid beams. The diagonal striations on the side pieces are distinctly suggestive of the windings of spiral columns. This columnar impression is further accented by two oblong capitals that mutually crown the shafts at the sides; the capitals being plain oblongs, nothing more. In between the capitals the upper rim of-the podium is in lower relief than are the oblongs that crown 57</page><page sequence="2">HAROLD R.

My friend Raymond Bowman indicates that the diagonal cross-strokes on the base beam seem to him to be echoing and prolonging the strong diagonal lines of a tile floor, thought of as extending beneath and in front of the base beam itself. To an observant student of Jewish ossuaries, the whole scheme of cross-stroke decoration is reminiscent of one of the commonest framing devices presented on the ample sides and the short ends of ostophagi of the imperial era.1 There the long horizontal strips, top and bottom, carry vertical striations, while vice versa the short vertical strips at the end carry horizontal cross-strokes. The enframe- ment pattern on the Tushingham panel, with its considerately plac- ed diagonal strokes, is a restrained elaboration of this familiar fra- ming device frequently reiterated on the ossuaries of the period. All the decorative striations on the Tushingham panel: vertical or horizontal or diagonal, are presented in relief, rather than being incised. Filling the center of the large rectangular space is a sizeable and high circumference measuring one and five-eighths inches in diame- ter. Four small circles, surrounding tiny knobs at their foci, occupy the four corners of the rectangle. These circles and knobs, like the cross-strokes on the enframing beams, are rendered in relief. Two similar circles at lower corners of the substructure, pin together the cross-hatched side pieces and the lengthy base member. This repeat- ed stress on perfect circles cannot be overlooked in any attempt to interpret the entire design. Surmounting this box-like structure there rises, in a distinct second storey, a colorful conch that is a perfect semi-circle (P1. I). Its polychrome rays, which are strongly defined, radiate from a very unusual two-thirds circle that rises directly from the lintel below. At the lower center of this segment a tiny knob stands in relief just where the focus of the full circle would be located, were the circum- ference rendered completely. Here, then, is a unique double emphasis on circularity, incomplete and complete. Why this singular repetit- ion of emphasis just here? We shall later endeavor to answer that question also. 1 Erwin R.

I). It is decoratively patterned, both in relief and with pigmented strokes also. Two sets of triple strokes in mild relief form patterns on the smooth surface of the apex at the very top. Directly below these there is a circumference in sharp and high relief, exactly one inch in diameter. This is flanked, lower down and on either side, by smaller cocentric circles, which swirl with perfect precision around centering knobs. Very peculiar excavated spaces intervene between the color- ful radiate lunette at the center, and the stilts at the sides that sup- port the high gable above-though none too securely it must be admitted. Quite obviously these ill-shaped spaces require special attention and explanation. Accordingly they will be considered later in some detail. Even such a sketchy descriptive analysis as the foregoing calls attention to the manifest circumstance that the perfect circles above and below, and the perfect semicircle of the conch in between, are the primarily prominent and meaningful features of the ensemble (P1. I), to which all other components are subsidiary. Peripheral and smaller circles outside repeat and re-echo the main motif in fully round fashion. Moreover it should definitely be fixed in mind at the very outset that the larger roundels, in the rectangle below and the triangle above, originally framed disks of polished glass, that were the most striking and the brightest elements presented. There can be no doubt at all of this arrangement. Extant panels of the same class still preserve in situ just such glass medallions. Moreover the circular cavities on the Tushingham tablet itself still show rough holes picked out immediately inside the round rim, and also rem- nants of coarse plaster that originally held such disks in place there. So distinctly important were these crystal medallions that this class of artifacts is most appropriately characterized today as "glass-disk plaques." At the focus of the larger circumference in the oblong podium below, a clay knob was carefully removed at the time of casting, in order to make way for the placement of the glass medallion within its narrow circular frame. Apparently it was not necessary to do this in the smaller roundel beneath the apex of the gable above. A secondary feature in comparison with the roundels -a feature 59</page><page sequence="5">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY not to be ignored however - is a small and perfectly round hole that penetrates straight through the thinness of the panel just above the gable medallion. Clearly it was intended to suspend this plaque from a wall fastening of some sort. The excellent craftsmanship of the panel is convincingly demon- strated by the extremely good condition in which the artifact finds itself today. In essential aspects it is amazingly well preserved. True it has been broken; but it has also been securely mended. The line of fracture runs swervingly from left side to right side, across the lower level of the concave tympanum. The object was originally well formed in a neatly patterned pan mould, into which the fine clay was firmly and carefully pressed. The back, however, was left flat and somewhat rough. It was smoothed by hand, but no more. The rear surface of the panel remains as informal as the fa9ade is scrupulously formalized. Inden- tation at the lower right angle shows that the partially dry plaque was carefully raised from its matrix at this corner. The bevelled edges of the panel decisively facilitated the process of removing the artifact from its enveloping mould. The fact that the panel was thus carefully produced from a definite form makes one optimistic that replicas of this admirable example may yet be recovered somewhere. Altogether the Tushingham panel is a most agreeable item with which to work. Aesthetically it has fine quality, pronounced precision, and marked restraint. Furthermore it belongs to a very diversified class of religious objects that are little known and are quite problema- tic in their import. Such attention as has been given to them has been very controversial, and at times even contradictory in its affir- mations. While there can be no doubt of the religious importance of disk panels, all sorts of questions can be raised as to who made use of them, what the different functions of the several sub-groups were, what symbolic values they represented, how highly or negligently they were estimated, and how they should be understood by modern investigators. To make even a beginning at answering such interro- gations about the Tushingham plaque itself, the multifarious diver- sifications of other objects in the disk category must be kept in view for comparative scrutiny. Accordingly thus early in our investigat- ion attention must be given to the several varieties of glass-disk objects that are familiar to scholars at the present time. 60</page><page sequence="6">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE I The over-all survey of glass-disk objects, known to archaeological scholarship at present, discloses a rather surprising variety of sub- groups of such artifacts, differentiated from each other in several distinct and realistic ways. There are simple frames and flat silhou- ettes and rounded figurines and more or less complicated architec- tural constructions, such as the Tushingham plaque itself. Differen- ces in mediums of expression, in constituent materials used in com- position, in forms and patterns followed, and in sizes of the objects themselves, tend to accentuate the diversifications between the several sub-groups. Quite naturally these differentiations are at once helpful and confusing, suggestive and complicating. They tend to veto any over-simplified conception of the values and functions represented by disk artifacts in their total variety. At the same time they tend to pluralize the number of possible uses of single proble- matic pieces like the Tushingham panel by itself. Any discussion of materials used in the make-up of these objects should begin with observations concerning the identifying crystal medallions. Usually and normally these crystals were plain, thin, clear, translucent roundels of glass. Sometimes, however, the glass was colored to suit its placement on the plaque, or the character of the object it was supposed to represent: whether a particular kind of fruit, or the eye of a bird or animal, or the flame of a lamp. Today most extant disks are fragmentary, broken, clouded, and dark. Some of them have become interestingly and even brilliantly iridescent. A few of them have been preserved in sufficient extent to show curving convexity like that of modern watch crystals or American colonial mirrors. Most frequently and very unfortunately the crystals are non- existent and the encircling frames are empty and unoccupied. The cavities may at times disclose a thin foil of leaden lining, such as was used in the makeup of mirrors of the same period. If pigment- ed priming remains, it is typically red. Presumably both priming and foil were employed as aids to reflectability. For the protecting panels, in which disks were set, a moderate variety of materials were employed. Plaster or clay were the com- monest of these. As pottery objects or terra cottas, accordingly, 61</page><page sequence="7">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY these artifacts are most numerously recovered at the present time. Sometimes stone was used in their manufacture, if it was soft and easily workable. White limestone, especially, was a preferred con- cretion. Quite rarely the panels were made of wood. Josef Strzygow- ski has recorded a blackened Coptic example in that material in the Cairo Museum.2 In the matter of shapes and conformation the disk plaques are exceedingly multiform, and they tend to run to extremes both in magnitude and in pattern. Curiously, features of formation and of size here show a tendency to coordinate with each other, at least in a general way. In the first place, at the nth degree of simplicity and smallness, stand the very neat, geometric frames in circles and squares and polygons. These snugly and firmly enframe the crucial glass disks in their centers.3 More frequently than not the geometric frames are quite bare of pattern. Sometimes they are only lineated with incised concentric circles, or flatly patterned with colored segments of circles. Rather infrequently they are encircled with repeat motifs, foliate or floriate, rinceaux or geometric. In the second place, at the opposite extreme of complexity and size, are the well articulated architectural panels, set out in ample proportions, including well-spaced free areas, specifically for the placement of the indicative glass roundels. The Tushingham plaque (P1. I) is an exceedingly attractive exemplar of the architectural sub-group of disk objects.4 The well organized architectural constructions might be supple- 2 Josef Strzygowski, Koptische Kunst.

Human or divine figures might be present in appropriately structur- ed settings. Realistic portraits, even, might be presented on rare occasion. Certainly religious furnishings and symbols would be recurrent on the architectonic panels. In the third place, just between the small geometric frames and the large architectural reliefs, were solid figures or figurines, anthro- pomorphic or ornithic or geometric, presented as flattened silhouet- tes or cutouts and distinguished as disk bearers.5 Most rounded and most unmanageable of the silhouette class of objects were the familiar Astarte figurines. These creatures were somewhat flattened and somewhat rounded, with the glass disk firmly embedded in the chest or between the thighs or even between the shoulders of the figure. The ornithic silhouettes were not numer- ous in their variety: cutouts of doves or peacocks or chanticleers evidently being preferred above others. The geometric complexes were clearly an enlargement and extension and complication of the simple and single and tight frames. The elongated panel from Beit Jibrin(?), gabled at one end and arched at the other, is a really im- pressive exhibit of such a geometric conflation.6 These formal diversifications, between simple frames and solid silhouettes and ample reliefs, are accented and even exaggerated by contrasts in size between the several genera of disk-bearing objects. The coordinate contrasts are dramatic. They cannot be said to be abnormal or even unexpected, however. Comparatively speaking the small and simple geometric frames are very small indeed in juxtaposition with the medial silhouetted forms, or the larger structured creations. For any typical group of angular or circular enframements the recorded diameters average around three inches only. It is very exceptional when they expand to six inches. Within the group of silhouetted objects, the average length of s For typical varieties of disk figurines and silhouettes see Moulton, op. cit., pp. 74-80, Figs. 4-7; "A Group of Palestinian Figurines", pp. 80-86, Figs. 1-4. 6 Moulton, op. cit., Fig. 4, p. 74. For an inclusive and quite representative collection of disk plaques generally see Palestine Archaeological Museum: (allery Book (Jerusalem, 1943), "Byzantine Period", Nos. 1683-1691, pp. 92 f, 63</page><page sequence="9">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY solid pattern, whether bird form or geometric figure, is about ten inches. Indeed this is exactly the length of the archetypal peacock pottery recovered by Pere Cre at Umm Tuba.7 So also the gable- semidome panel from Beit Jibrin(?), already cited, is approximately the same length. On the other hand the architectural Dormition reliefs, treasured now in the Palestine Archaeological Museum, normally measure half as large again as the solid silhouetted pieces. In the very nature of the case the complicated character of their construction specifically demanded more space for stable elaboration. Erwin Goodenough's record for the structural plaques in the Palestine Museum is as fol- lows: "These are in the first place much larger than most of the others; some of the dimensions run from twelve to sixteen and a half inches." 8 Appropriately enough, the architectonic panels show almost monumental proportions, especially in comparison with simple frame items. When all is said that must be said concerning real differences in materials and patterns and sizes between the several genera of disk objects, it remains to observe and emphasize the commonly shared and interconnecting features that concretely hold together the dif- ferent sub-groups. Regardless of deviations and exceptions, there are certain very obvious aspects all but universally present in all known examples of disk-plaques. These not-to-be-ignored connecting features give tangible clues to significant traits of the artifacts them- selves, and to their specific uses in religion and life. For the inclusive category of disk objects as an entire class, the interconnecting aspects are the same as the primary and secondary features already observed and noted for the Tushingham panel by itself (P1. I). The matter of foremost importance, then, is the focalizing cen- trality of the plain glass medallion on all these objects. Invariably the earthenware panel-whatever its size, formation, or decoration - exists for the protection and enframement and enhancement of the crystal medallion, and not vice versa. In the simplest geometric items, the enframement is the most immediate and direct possible. The pottery margin is the frame, nothing more and nothing less. So 7 R. P. L6on Cr6, "Une d6couverte eucharistique", Revue Biblique, III (1894) 277-291. B Goodenough, op, cit., I, 175, 64</page><page sequence="10">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE also with the most elaborately structured build-ups, the architecture continues to be a framework for the glass disk. At most it does not distract from concentrating attention on the determinative roundel. The amplest and best spaces are assigned to this primary feature. Without exception the largest medallions are the most pivotally located. For recurrent emphasis smaller disks may be multiplied thereabout as expanse and structure afford opportunity. Aesthetically and symbolically and religiously it is most necessary constantly to keep in mind the bright dominance of the shining glass medallion. Compared with that crystal roundel, the secondary interconnecting feature between those diversified objects seems secondary indeed. It is that inconspicuous little hole (or holes), usually near the top of the plaque, obviously for suspension purposes. It assured the secure hanging of the panel from the wall of an above-ground building, public or private or semi-public. Just as securely it was adapted to the suspension of the object from the wall of a subsurface cave or catacomb. The intention would be to hang these plaques more or less at eye level, where their qualities could be seen and understood and appreciated by an interested person. The question of provenance, for groups of artifacts so clearly differentiated and so realistically interconnected, might seem to be more complicated than it actually is. One index on this matter is to observe where, most numerously, these items are being recovered at the present time. By far a much larger number of them have been found in Syria and Palestine, than have emerged from any other Roman provincial area. Only scatteringly have they been reported from other Near East provinces, from east Mediterranean islands, and from Egypt. Still fewer have been known as appearing in Rome and the West. Among the Astarte plaques of Syro-Palestinian provenance and Roman period, neighboring influences have been definitely discernible and specifically recognized: Mesopotamian and Cypriote and Egyptian notably. As to the time of production for glass-disk objects, it has to be acknowledged that no definite and inclusive chronology has yet been achieved for them thus far. This is due to sheer lack of sufficient numbers of examples to work with, and to the absence of explicit documentation for too many of the known examples. The general consensus as to period of production is that it was in Roman imperial 65</page><page sequence="11">THAROLD R. WILLOTUGHBY times, or to say it in another way, in early Christian times. The second and the third and the fourth centuries seem to rate the larger number of attributions, with the third century preferred to the second. Roman imperial in main lines and forms are the controlling architectural arrangements of the structured panels, with Jewish renderings of basilican forms noteworthy on Jewish reliefs. The use of religious symbols and objects in general tallies in time with the structural settings provided for them in the more ambitious pieces. The data regarding both place and time-from Syro-Palestinian areas and from Roman imperial or early Christian centuries-add emphatically to the interest of these inherently fascinating artifacts for and by themselves. II In general there can be no doubt at all of the genuineness and depth of religious concern represented by the disk terra cottas. A sizeable sub-group of them is constituted by Astarte figurines, prob- ably the most generally and widely popular of suchlike objects in their areal milieu. The birds silhouetted in isolation as compact forms, or standing paired and heraldic in high gables, are religious- association birds such as doves and peacocks. Also the fa9ades carved in relief on the largest panels are isolated from religious buildings: temples and tempiettoes, synagogues and Torah shrines, lararia and sanctuaries, tombs and cenotaphs, portals and triumphal arches. Actually it is not to be wondered at that Mayer and Reifenberg seriously estimated a small group of arch-and-gable items, presently in the Palestine Museum at Jerusalem, to be copied from the fagade and inside wall of specifically the Capernaum synagogue 9 - though of course they were not actually so copied! In fine, almost every main aspect of the disk plaquettes proclaim them to be religiously meaningful objects for their creators and possessors. With all the variations in size and shape and material and compos- ition and decoration of disk objects, it is not strange that the several groupings disclose also a variety of religious connections with main systems current in their period. The definite identification of reli- gious traits is so frankly displayed now and again on the plaques 9 Mayer and Reifenberg, loc, cit, 66</page><page sequence="12">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE themselves, that it can hardly be missed by the alert student today. Pagans were genuinely fond of representational religious imagery. Jews were profoundly moved by simplified religious symbolism. Christians were equally the heirs of both Jews and pagans in both these lines of interest, representational and symbolic. As frequently as not, then, one can be reasonably certain of the religious connect- ions of a given panel, if he takes pains to interrogate it scrupulously. With minimum citation of convincing examples, we can illustrate the chief probabilities and possibilities in this matter. Sizeable structured plaques were likely to carry more than one monumental Menorah. Such an artifact could only be classed as Jewish. A sub- group of puzzling plaques was composed of the Astarte figurines. These would surely rate as pagan models. Demonstrably some disk plaques served as Eucharistic containers. These certainly could not be Jewish. They were definitely Christian. On the other hand, some of these objects are so conglomerate in representational and symbolic features that it is quite impossible to classify them as connected with just one religious group, to the exclusion of all others. Erwin Goodenough cites in full detail a prime syncretistic example from the Palestine Archaeological Museum.10 The main motif centers in a disk-bearing urn from which a pair of peacocks drink life-giving wine. That familiar group might certainly be pagan; or it might be Christian; or again it might well be even Jewish. At the top center is a nude figure of Astarte- probably it is she. If so she is inescapably pagan. At the lower left corner of the plaque there is a realistic portrait bust, hung with rich jewelry and snuggling a pet dove. Pagan perhaps; Christian perhaps. Either way the portrait is equally probable. Such are the plural possibilities for definite classification or inde- finite syncretistic rating presented by glass-disk panels viewed as objects of religious esteem. The phenomena of diversity and pluralism are so evident through all phases of the investigation of disk plaques that one cannot reasonably expect to get a single and simple answer, and just one answer only, to the question of the purpose or function served by these interrelated objects. For just one single such object, recovered under very specific circumstances, the simple and single statement 10 Goodenough, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 177; Vol. III, Fig. 445, 67</page><page sequence="13">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY of function might have reasonable validity. It could not possibly have cogency for the entire conglomeration of glass-disk artifacts generally. Yet exactly this sort of mistake was made by the earliest discov- erers and publishers of this class of objects. With great conscien- tiousness and persistency these pioneering explorers endeavored to establish exactly one use and no more than one use for known examples of such panels. As soon as recognized instances apprecia- bly exceeded the number of one object or one type of object, this kind of monotonous, closed-minded consistency lost its validity and pertinence. The oldest single hypothesis to be promulgated concerning the archetypal plaque to be isolated, was the pre-eminently religious Eucharistic theory. When over sixty years ago-in 1893-Father Superior Cre of the Peres Blancs of St. Anne in Jerusalem found at Umm Tuba a bird-shaped pottery with a glass-disk inlay, the idea flashed into his mind that it was a Eucharistic container into which a morsel of sacred bread had been sealed. In his publication of the plaque in the following year in the Revue Biblique, he records ingen- uously how the circumstance that the Eucharistic Congress was scheduled to meet in 1893 at Jerusalem suggested this inspired guess to his mind at just that time.ll Even so, probably Pere Cre was essentially correct in his hypothesis. The character of the bird-shaped pottery itself with its inlaid glass disk was in favor of the guess. The Umm Tuba locale was an important early Christian monastic site. Furthermore the study and restudy of patristic data by Pere Cre himself and by later scholars from Macalister to Goodenough, has confirmed the view that the hanging of Eucharistic plaques in early Christian tombs was a religious practise that was popularly prized and officially disapproved. The only modification that Pere Cr6 himself made in his initial guess was to recognize that the bird he found silhouetted in pottery at Umm Tuba was not a harmless dove, but was a splendid proud peacock instead. Nearly two decades later R.A.S. Macalister of Dublin and the Palestine Exploration Fund had a solitary earthenware roundel, with a carefully centered glass disk, to account for at Gezer. Here he found the Cre hypothesis significant for his need. The roundel "1 Cr6, loc. cit, 68</page><page sequence="14">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE ''USlINGHAM PLAQUE came from a Christian tomb. In a very simple and rough way it had all the appearance of an early Christian monstrance. Functionally the Cre proposal seemed sound for the Gezer medallion as it did for the Umm Tuba peacock. So Macalister published it as a Eucharistic item in his important Gezer volumes,12 resurveying briefly the patristic evidence relevant to it. More strenuous and exacting in their demands than a solitary silhouette or a single roundel were the plaquettes and figurines examined by President Moulton of Bangor, in the first volume of the Annual of the American School of Oriental Research at Jerusalem.13 They were a dozen in number. As an assemblage they were con- spicuously differentiated in size and shape and pattern and character. Included were two Astarte figurines distinguished by prominently placed glass disks. President Moulton made the conscientious but egregious blunder of trying to make the unitary Eucharistic proposal of Pere Cre explanatory for all these cases, for the frankly non-Christian exam- ples, as well as for the neutral or Christian items. With agonizing consistency he did his very best at this endeavor. Regrettably it cannot be affirmed that he succeeded in becoming convincing. That single Eucharistic theory could not possibly be stretched to cover all these multiform cases, standing so far apart in religious relationships as these several forms plainly stood. In vigorous reaction against this overworking of the pyxis theory by President Moulton, Pere Ronzevalle, S. J., equally overworked an untenable counter proposal in the very next year.14 His investi- gation was based mainly on a considerable selection of disk objects that he himself had gathered from different sites in Syria for the Louvre collection. His strong contention was that they were all actual mirrors and were intended to be used as such. In view of the pigmy size of the glass disks and their enframements, however, it had to be said that they were toy mirrors, not actual looking glasses for toilet use. Much later Erwin Goodenough astutely observed that it was dif- 12 R. A. S. Macalister, The Excavation of Gezer.

I and II, Nos. 1-5. 69</page><page sequence="15">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY ficult to understand how so many toys of this one sort came to be preserved, when such vast varieties of ancient toys have perished beyond possibility of recovery.15 Apparently without evaluating what he was doing, Pere Ronze- valle almost reinstated himself in scholarly estimation at the very end of his monograph. There he made allowance for yet other pos- sibilities for disk plaques than merely the toy-mirror specification: "It may be that some of these played the part of amulets rather than mirrors properly so called, that others served as domestic ornaments, and that others again received a short inscription and became votive offerings." 16 It is decidedly matter for regret that in concrete inter- pretation Pere Ronzevalle did not take his own summary suggestions more seriously regarding the plurality of possible and actual uses made of disk plaques. There is plenty of specific data to show that different groups of these objects were actually used in such very different ways as here intimated by the learned Father himself. The next most important additions made to the repertoire of disk panels were the well-scaled monumental terra cottas formerly in the Dormition Museum, but now incorporated in the Palestine Museum collection. They are easily the most ambitious and admirable pieces in their category of disk artifacts. Indeed they have special interest specifically in relation to the Tushingham panel itself (P1. I), since it also belongs to their architectural group. These specimens were published in exemplary fashion by Messrs. L. A. Mayer and A. Reifenberg in the Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund issued in 1937.17 Somewhat surprisingly the authors were quite reserved on questions of purpose and use. They did, however, conclude their investigation with a fresh and pregnant proposal that in the Jewish domestic milieu - these reliefs are palpably Jewish productions - they probably served as pendent prayer niches, intended to indicate the direction in which prayer and other acts of worship should be performed. This proposal was so unique and striking at the time that it surely deserves quotation here: "The novum of our reliefs lies in the fact that-to judge from the holes-they must have been kept fixed to a wall and so are 15 Goodenough, op. cit., I, 175. 16 Ronzevalle, op. cit., p. 174. 17 Mayer and Reifenberg, loc. cit. 70</page><page sequence="16">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE mutatis mutandis in a way the prototypes of the so-called 'mizrach pictures' to be found on the eastern wall of orthodox Jewish houses, indicating the direction of prayer." Thus the all-too-brief report of Mayer and Reifenberg not only appreciably enlarged the growing corpus of disk plaques; also and more importantly it formulated a new and brilliant hypothesis concerning the utilization of such panels in Jewish domestic practise of religion. Most recently Erwin Goodenough's encyclopedic survey of Jewish Symbols in the Greco-Roman Period has contributed specific confir- mation to the astute Mayer-Reifenberg thesis.18 From the Rudolf Jonas Collection in Haifa Goodenough published an architectural relief which he hailed as "the oldest Mizrach I know." The design consisted of a triple-arched colonnade, with glass disk inserts between the columns, comfortably filling a steeply gabled panel. Under the circumstances, that colonnade could be understood only as represen- ting the ideal Jerusalem temple, with its Holy of Holies. Correspon- dingly the shining glass disks would symbolize the Shekinah, the very Divine Presence, that gave to the Most Holy Place its acme of religious meaning. Thus the Jonas plaque at Haifa took on great weight and a decisive role as an antique archetype of the impressive Mizrach panels or "pictures" in quite general use today, as they continue to provide orientation for practices of worship and prayer in Jewish families and communities. This type of disk panel, then, was itself a kind of portable shrine which contributed realistic focal- ization to habitual forms of religious expressionism. Previously in Volume I of Jewish Symbols Goodenough had clearly defined the variant cemeterial function of Jewish disk tablets.19 This was a most important demonstration for such objects. Actually more frequently than not these potteries are recovered today from the milieux of tombs and cenotaphs and catacombs. There they anciently brought to the gloom of man's eternal resting place the hopeful symbolism of the sacred portal as the entrance to a new and undying life, and the gay gleam of light itself as the brilliant illustrat- ion of the sanitive quality and potency of divine and lasting life. Thus the chief Jewish uses of disk tablets, cemeterial and domestic, may now be regarded as definitively established and realistically 18 Goodenough, op. cit., Vol. IV, pp. 124-126, Figs. 49, 84, 89. 19 Ibid., Vol. I, pp. 174-177; Vol. III, Figs. 440, 441, 442, 445, 446. 71</page><page sequence="17">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY disclosed in convincing fashion with numbers of exemplars. The major Jewish uses of disk plaques, so cogently developed by Erwin Goodenough, however appealing and impressive they may be, cannot be regarded as comprehending all the potential and actual functioning of all known types of these objects-not by any means! The fundamental circumstance was that other religious people of the period, pagans and even Christians as well as sons of Israel, made good use of such artifacts and esteemed them highly. Among all these religious groups a plurality and multiplicity of particularized usages must be recognized, suiting the typical interests and concerns and needs of the individuals and groups who possessed and used the artifacts. In this matter, function responded to the characteristic concerns of religious people and to the material aspects of the objects themselves. Astarte figurines, for example, as we have already intimated, would be among the most revered lararia objects treasured in the domestic sanctuaries of pagan households in the eastern Mediter- ranean world. Religiously they were no less than objects of adoration and worship. Specific portrait panels, such as the one in the Palestine Museum, give realistic and indeed pictorial impressions of the memorial value of these plaques, whether preserved in tombs or in homes. In a non-representational way the same is true of inscribed epitaphs on tombstones recording the names of the deceased, and accompanied by cavities for the insertion of crystal medallions. Dedicatory plaques of the disk variety remain, with special places marked out for the names of dedicators. All disk tablets, almost without exception, would have amuletic potency attributed to them. The very weight of religious symbolism that was theirs would determine that. Most of them would also have associated aesthetic interest as objects of domestic ornament. Even the very simplest and plainest of the disk frames were usually attractive items. None of them, however, were just merely ornamental objects and nothing more. Altogether, then, quite a multiplicity of potential functions must be kept in mind for the full variety of different classes and types of disk plaques. Without regret, however, the proposition that such panels were mirrors, either full-sized mirrors for actual looking glass use, or miniature mirrors for play purposes, may be forgotten and ignored. 72</page><page sequence="18">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE Their glass disks were quite too small for full-face reflection, and they were too numerous in a single setting for convenient use. Moreover these were highly significant and richly suggestive religious items, seriously treated and much revered by their possessors and users. They were not the trivialities of ancient toyland. At no time can the religious associations and connotations of glass-disk panels be ap- propriately left out of view. Instead, the religious classification of a glass medallioned plaque is a convenient and time-saving guide to the more specific formula- tion of its probable function. Here the very first question to be asked and answered is this: "To what religious group of the period did this object appertain?" As already observed, quite frequently the religious identifications are plain, and so the specification of probable functions may proceed forthwith. However it must be said also that there are many disk artifacts that are quite non-committal and innocent of specific index to religious classification. (In such cases definition of likely use may prove to be more difficult and less certain than in the clearly clas- sifiable instances.) III When one turns to the specific investigation of the Tushingham plaque (P1. I), one is impressed first of all by the controlling architec- tural character of the entire design. Mainly this is an architectonic panel throughout. Accordingly the suitable preliminary to a consider- ation of its religious purport or intent is to analyse its main structural aspects. As an architectural entity it may be described too simply as a steep gable resting on an oblong, rectangular base. The gable, however, has a large interrupting arch, framing a concave lunette, that occupies its lower area. The semicircle of the arch is wide, and its outer angles rest on pilasters that define at the sides the rectan- gular podium below. An oblong substructure, and a gable with an interrupting arch at its base, describes in main outline the overall design of the Tushingham panel (P1. I). Students of architectural history will at once recognize that this sketchy outline also delineates a dominant type of monumental entrance porticoes, that had outstandingly splendid development in 73</page><page sequence="19">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY Roman imperial times. In this imperial version the triangular gable above was a long and relatively low pediment. The rectangular sub- structure beneath the triangle was an open colonnade; and the inter- rupting arch at the base of the gable was an arcuated architrave, swerving upward above the central intercolumniation, and immedia- tely beneath the apex of the pediment. For convenience and brevity we call it the "arcuated Roman portico." That interrupting central arch was the distinctive feature of the construction. The mightiest and most important buildings of the times, whether sacred or secular, were likely to have such an arcuated introductory member at the ceremonial entrance. A very grand and earlier example from the Syrian section of the Empire was the eastern portico of the stupendous Baalbek precinct between the Lebanons and the Antilebanons.20 There it introduced the awed visitor to the hexagonal court anterior to the colossal tem- ple of Jupiter Optimus Maximus Heliopolitanus. An equally superb, but a later and middle Mediterranean example, from the period of the Tetrarchate, was the high portico of the vestibule to the imperial audience hall in Diocletian's retirement palace at Spalato.21 It still stands there in all its splendid altitude. There in late antique times it introduced the awed visitor to the divinized presence of the im- perial personage himself. The arcuated portico was undoubtedly Rome's grandest accomplishment in the field of monumental en- trance architecture. This portico pattern made such an impression, both on Roman imperialists and on provincial populations as well, that it became a favored motif on Rome's provincial coinage through the imperial 20 Theodor Wiegand, Baalbek.

Cambridge: University Press (1945), Fig. 97, p. 227. It is a familiar fact that repeatedly elsewhere in the vast Baalbek precinct the arcuated Roman portico pattern enjoyed prominent placement-elsewhere, that is, than just at the propylaea. 21 Georg Niemann, Der Palast Diokletian's in Spalato. Wien: Holder (1910), pp. 44-61, Figs. 5, 56, 68, 73, Pls. V, VI, XIII, XIV, XV; Robertson, op. cit., pp. 316-321, P1. XXIV. It goes without saying that again and again at Spalato the Roman arcuated portico was given monumental repetition, e.g., in the portico fronting the octagonal imperial mausoleum, immediately contiguous to the xestibule entrance just cited. 74</page><page sequence="20">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE centuries. This was most notably the case in the Palestinian area after the crushing out of the two major Jewish revolts, respectively of the late first century and of the early second century. Within the very small circumference of a coin such a spacious pattern had to be rendered most tersely, to be included at all. The brief colonnade could have only two or four or at most no more than six columns, to support the arcuated gable. In the architectural shorthand of numismatics this abbreviated framework came to be understood to mean "temple" or "sanctuary." The temple could be specifically identified by the anthropomorphic statue that it enshrined. Roman coins minted in Palestine's Aelia Capitolina (= Jerusalem) were characteristically notable for their reliefs of portico shrines in their reverse medallions.22 From the principate of Hadrian onward, portico designs are recorded for Antoninus Pius (A.D. 138-161), for Marcus Aurelius and Lucius Verus (161-169), for Septimius Severus (193-211) and Diadumenianus (217-218), and also for the Syrian pontiff Elagabalus (218-222). The god most frequently imaged in a portico shrine on coins of Aelia Capitolina mintage was the enthroned Jupiter himself, Optimus et Maximus, the chief of the Capitoline Triad. The goddess most frequently depicted was the turreted Tyche of the provincial capital. Most interesting and suggestive of all were the three-figure, tetra- style medallions, showing the chief goddess or god in the central intercolumniation, directly beneath the arching architrave. This left the smaller columnar spaces at the sides to be filled by supporting twin divinities, masculinely the vigorous Dioscuroi, or femininely the winged Nikes. Considering the architectonic qualities of the arcuated portico, it is not surprising that it played the role it did in monumental construction, on Roman coinage, and on the Tushing- ham relief itself (P1. I). Ultimately and basically the Roman arche- type and pattern for the latter formulation was the monumental arcuated imperial portico. While the main framework of the Tushingham panel must be recognized as echoing the monumental Roman portico, with its in- terruptive central arch, more detailed features of the inclusive construction, and the juxtaposition of its component parts seem to 22 Frederic W. Madden, Coins of the Jews. London: Triibner (1881), "Imperial Colonial Coins Struck at Jerusalem," pp. 247-275. 75</page><page sequence="21">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY exhibit another range of influences: areal, provincial, Near Eastern, and Semitic. The closest congeners to these more specific aspects of the panel are to be found in Semitic and Jewish renderings of con- temporary Roman basilican forms of architecture, and decoration, particularly in Syrian and Palestinian territory. Most numerously and most prominently these features are to be found concretely incorporated in a very well known and exceedingly important species of Jewish religious building, the "basilican" type of synagogue.23 The generally accepted adjective "basilican" gives full recognition to the governing Hellenistic-Roman features of these meeting houses: nave, aisles, colonnades, galleries, triple entrances, porticoes, and gable roof. "Galilean synagogues" is an alternative geographical designation that emphasizes where they have been uncovered in largest numbers and in most extensive preservation in recent times. These buildings may be contrasted in typical features with the more indigenous, more Oriental, but less numerously familiar "broad- house" class of synagogues. Erwin Goodenough's latest published census of basilican or Galilean synagogues numbers some three dozen of them for Palestinian territory only. At least a half dozen more, classed by Goodenough as "Synagogues with Mosaics," should be assigned to the basilican group. In a simple way at least, these too are truly basilican. The Romano-Jewish basilican synthesis found in Galilean syna- gogues is likely to reveal parallels to the Tushingham design in a variety of conspicuous and crucial places. They may appear most inclusively on the fa9ade as a whole; or most immediately at the chief portal; or quite prominently on decorative window enframe- ments outside or inside the building; or sacredly on a sanctuary screen single or double; or most sacredly in a Torah cabinet or niche or shrine incorporated into the wall orientated toward Jerusalem. Wherever located, the simple built-up affair, tripartite in sections, added up to a small shrine, an appropriately scaled sanctuary. In vertical structuralization from base to apex, the distinct strata were as follows in masonry renderings. First there was a substantial rectangular substructure with determinative dimensions. Next there was an arcuated, intervening, transitional member, with the semi-circular space beneath the arch asually filled-in in one manner 23 Goodenough, op. cit., Vol. I, pp. 178-267; Vol. III, Figs. 451-666. 76</page><page sequence="22">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE or another. Finally, there was the triangular gable into which the arch below usually trespassed. Comparing this Romano-Semitic masonry build-up with the open-framework of the arcuated Roman portico, one becomes conscious of the striking differentiation in the central arching factors involved. In the Roman portico the inter- rupting arch, whether arcuated lintel or arched architrave, was typically left quite free and open as a beautiful but vacant lunette. In the Roman-Semitic shrine, the trespassing lunette was usually a filled-in area of sorts: perhaps with open grill-work only, as in the huge gaping lunette immediately above the first storey of the Capernaum synagogue; perhaps with plain flat masonry only, thus forming a solid lunette; but rather more frequently with a normal concave conch or a flattened semidome firmly supporting the arch above. The Semitic and Jewish preference for the filled-in lunette, though not invariable, was yet emphatically and frequently reiter- ated, particularly in basilican synagogues. Almost any number of examples, illustrating closely matching constructions, could be cited here, in a variety of appropriate materials and from a plurality of locations. Here, however, it is virtuous to be restrained and parsimonious and selective in choosing demonstrative instances. We begin in the large, then, with the en- tire front of the best known among the Galilean synagogues, the considerably reconstructed meeting house at Capernaum.24 Most conveniently and suggestively the actual construction of the basilica in two storeys, at the main floor level and higher at the gallery level, is unmistakably outlined on the fa9ade itself, by horizontal masonry moldings, plain or carved in relief. The first storey is delineated by a plain architrave resting on four flat pilasters, with the triple front entrances to the synagogue opening between them. This is the "rectangular substructure" element of the design. Similarly the second storey of the synagogue is outlined at the top by a richly carved and arcuated molding, extending horizontally from one eave of the building to the other. This is the "intervening arcuated mem- ber" in the plan. Finally there is the triangular pediment formed by 24 Ibid., Vol. I, pp. 181-192, Vol. III, Figs. 451-479; Heinrich Kohl and Carl Watzinger, Antike Synagogen in Galilaea. Leipzig: Hinrich (1916), pp. 4-40, Pls. III-VI; E. L. Sukenik, Ancient Synagogues in Palestine and Greece. London: British Academy (1934), pp. 7-21, Pls. I-VII, 77</page><page sequence="23">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY the gabled roof. Definitely the filled-in arch of the arcuated molding beneath the gable is an interruptive element in this triangle, over- lapping it from below. Thus in large-scale space allotment the front- wall of the Capernaum synagogue openly proclaims the building to be a religious sanctuary. Its most obvious features parallel the main areas of the Tushingham panel (P1. I). Other Galilean synagogue fagades that accentuate the same tripartite elements of design may be studied in reconstructions of the basilicas at Kafr Birim, ed- Dikkeh, and Umm el-Kanatir.25 Were the famous Chorazin synago- gue reconstructed, doubtless it too would display the same sort of major space patterning. It is fitting that our next example of a parallel shrine pattern with a closed central arch should be a carved relief of a Torah shrine, the most revered of the cultic foci of Judaism, particularly after the final destruction of the Jerusalem temple with its Holy of Holies. This panel was uncovered at Peki'in in upper Galilee.26 It is almost the sole remnant of the synagogue that once stood there. With singular simplicity and clarity it depicts a typicalAron ha-Qodesh in moderate relief. The Torah cabinet has double doors, set with dignified vertical panels. The doorposts are well-rounded pilasters. Arranged in a framed rectangular panel, this is the high vertical base of the con- struction. The intervening arcuated element above is an arched architrave, enclosing a conch, which in turn crowns the Torah cabinet below. An unbroken rope pattern carved on the architrave calls attention to the continuity of its arcuation. Above this there rises a steep gable, with repeats of pendent cursive omegas hung along the projecting edges of the sloping roofs. The conch and gable together, in vertical juxtaposition, provide double enhancement for the pilastered cabinet below. Structurally, this relief is much better articulated than is the Tushingham panel itself (P1. I). A second closely cognate example of a Torah shrine with both a 25 Goodenough, op. cit., Vol. III, Figs. 452 (Capernaum), 521 (ed-Dikkeh), 533 (Umm el-Kanatir); Kohl and Watzinger, op. cit., p. 97, Fig. 186 (Kafr Birim); p. 100, Fig. 191 (Kafr Birim); p. 124, Fig. 251 (ed-Dikkeh); p. 134, Fig. 272 (Umm el-Kanatir); Sukenik, op. cit., pp. 24-26, Fig. 3 (Kafr Birim). 26 Goodenough, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 18 f., No. 20; Vol. III, Fig. 573; Sukenik, op. cit., p. 52 f., Fig. 13; Idem, The AncientSynagogue of Beth Alpha. Jerusalem; University Press (1932), p.24 f., Fig. 26. 78</page><page sequence="24">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE conch and a gable should be examined. Preferably it should be approximately in normal scale, but in an exceptional medium of representation. Accordingly we choose the end panel of the floor mosaic in the Beth Alpha synagogue,27 located in the first bay of the nave, directly in front of the curtained apse itself. The mosaic painting could hardly have been more effectively devised or located. Above, in the ample apse, there stood the most revered of the synagogue furnishings in three-dimensional construction: Menorahs, Lions of Judah, Curtains, the Aron ha-Qodesh, with the pendent Lamp of Remembrance. Immediately below, and directly in front of the apse, was the floor mosaic wherein the identical items were pictured, this time in two dimensions only, and ren- dered by very colorful tessellae. Both the apsidal tableau and the floor picturization centered inevitably in the Torah cabinet. In mosaic depiction this was delineated as a double-doored cup- board, standing upright on a wide base. Triple pilasters, crowned with ornamental vases, served as door jambs. Up to lintel level, this was the high, rectangular substructure. The three vases and the corner finials aligned themselves as an intervening, ornamental sequence. Two birds, perhaps ostriches, perched precariously and superfluously on the extended finials. The triangular gable above was both steep and stepped in saw-tooth fashion. Where was the to-be-expected conch within its semi-circular frame? It was not indeed missing! Instead it was plainly suspended, apparently quite in isolation, in the center of the triangular gable. Above it, pendent from the apex of the gable, was the ever-burning memorial lamp, its flame illuminating at once the apex above and the conch below. In this abnormal juxtaposition of characteristic features there was a peculiar accent on the double enhancement of the shrine-like construction provided by the conch and the gable in vertical array, one above the other, with the Lamp of Remembrance as the mediating or unifying element suspended between them. It is not forcing or compelling the evidence, but reading it plainly and literally to say that a shrine that was at once arcuated and gabled, had re-emphasized attestation of its inherent sanctity. 27 Goodenough, op. cit., Vol. I, pp. 251-253; Vol. III, Figs. 631, 632, 639; Sukenik, Ancient Synagogues, pp. 31-35, No. 2, Figs. 7 and 8; Idem, Beth Alpha, pp. 22-34, Pls. VIII and IX. 79</page><page sequence="25">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY Such was the doubly accredited sanctuary carved in relief on the Tushingham plaque (P1. I). Recapitulating the evidence from closely parallel architectural constructions, imperial Roman and Oriental or Semitic Roman, we may say that the Tushingham panel now demonstrates itself to be a portable shrine in the form of a pendent plaque. As such it would properly be regarded and treated with esteem and rever- ence, and utilized as definitely a focus of cultic interest and activity. Its inherent sanctity is doubly attested both by the controlling central conch, and also by the high gable above that concave focus. The closed lunette by itself recalls typical Semitic-Roman prefer- ences and practices in construction; while the arch-and-gable combination recalls typical and imperial Roman patterns of monumental enhancement. As here synthesized, elements Semitic and Roman, Oriental and Occidental, combine to create a peculiarly intense concentration of architectural and religious interest just where it is most efficient. That crucial area is the concave lunette with expanding rays that crowns the oblong podium below, while it also provides firm support for the mounting gable above. This architecturally unifying factor, automatically and eventually, proves to be the religiously focalizing factor as well. IV At this point a dual problem, that is both puzzling and annoying, intrudes itself and claims consideration. At the outer, lower corners of the Tushingham gable, between the outside struts that support the gable and the arched semi-circumference of the conch within, there are two irregular excavations gouged out of the plain surface of the plaque (P1. I). These holes have no identifiable form, but they more or less fit the corner spaces that they occupy. Why, in such a regularly constructed and neatly patterned design as this, should these intrusive cavities be tolerated? Can there be found an explanation for them? Of course one can easily and glibly say that they are negative space fillers, or space fillers in reverse. The suggestion would be that here, for some reason or other, clay was removed altogether, instead of being added in relief, in order to render an otherwise 80</page><page sequence="26">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE plain area more interesting. However, like the ill-formed cavities themselves, this "explanation" does not explain. It says next to nothing. Any number of other shrine-like designs in a very great variety of materials intimate a possible explanation of the negative phe- nomena shadowed in these spaces. Far more frequently than not, miniature sanctuaries of this sort blossom out in corner acroteria or finials at the outer angles of gables or pediments. The corner piece may be simple or elaborate; it may be foliate or floreate or of tendril design; but almost unavoidably in some form or other it is there! So regular is this arrangement that when the acroterion is absent, it is consciously or unconsciously missed, and some substitute is craved for it. In a relief against a solid background the corner finial could be rendered securely and well. So also it could be done in mosaic silhouette, as in the floor panel at Beth Alpha that we have just examined. There the corner horns provided sure footing for the precariously balanced birds above. Not so on a cutout plaque like the Tushingham panel! Here corner finials could not be securely attached outside the straightly defined limits of the panel proper. Almost surely and almost immediately they would be broken off. It is possible that the corner cavities in the Tushingham plaque were the best substitute the designer could devise for the outside acroteria which practically were out of question there. Since he could not mould the expected external finials, he provided a secure substitute for them, by excavating deep hollows within the design instead. This may be the sufficient account of the irregular corner cavities on the Tushingham panel (P1. I). Another more concrete and much more complicated possibility has been advocated by Director Kraeling, presently the Curator of the Case Archaeological Collection. It has vividness and specificity and plenty of precedent. The suggestion arises from the circumstance that sacred shrines, notably in the ancient Near East, were not infrequently rendered more impressive and stately and altitudinous by the addition of a canopy or a baldachino above, hung with rich and lavish curtains. The well-known Torah shrine in the synagogue of Dura-Europos - now reconstructed in Damascus-provides an excellent exemplification of this embellishment. In the excavation of the Torah niche proper, architect Pearson found incontrovertible 81</page><page sequence="27">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY evidence that once a gable-like baldachino, hung with curtains, was affixed on the flat summit of the Torah aedicula, directly above the recessed shrine itself 28. Convincingly confirmatory evidence was immediately discovered in a detailed depiction of a curtained Torah shrine of similar model frescoed on the self-same wall 29. The picturesque features there disclosed were as follows. The baldachino itself was a framework construct, in the form of a triangular gable. A fagadal curtain veiled the face of this gable completely. From the outer angles of the gabled facade long and wide lateral curtains hung downward on either side of the Torah shrine and cabinet. Fitted with draw cords, these side curtains could be drawn forward and together to veil the Torah shrine completely; or they could be drawn apart and backward leaving the shrine fully uncovered and exposed to popular view. During synagogue service the shrine would regularly be unveiled. When service was not being held, the shrine would regularly be curtained and concealed. At the outer angles of the gable the upper and lower curtains came together in juxtaposition. When the lateral curtains were pulled back as far as possible, uncovered and empty spaces were there left open, incongruously and unrelieved. It is suggested that this arrangement may explain the cavities in the lower angles of the gable in the Tushingham plaque (P1. I). On this view they would 28 H.-F.

In the very nature of the case this hypothesis is not capable of complete or conclusive demonstration. It remains an hypothesis only. It is, however, a very distinctive thesis that merits careful examination and rumination. Particularly it should be studied in comparison with the phenomena disclosed realistically by the aedicula in the Dura-Europos synagogue. A pictorial reconstruction of the curtained baldachino at Dura can make this proposal seem far more plausible than any aprioristic discussion can possibly do. V We come at long last to the final and presumably the most important problem relative to the Tushingham artifact (P1. I). What initially and intentionally was the religious function of this object? For what purpose or purposes was it created in its own day and place by its designer and craftsman? What use or uses in its own time and milieu did it experience at the hands of its earliest possessors and users ? Surely this nexus of problems is not only most important; it is also most engrossing and most baffling. That from the first the Tushingham plaque was regarded and utilized as a definitely religious item cannot really be doubted. The variety of religious uses, already attested for the closely related architectural reliefs now well known to responsible scholars, all but demonstrates the definitely religious intent of the Tushingham tablet also. If specific and subsidiary demonstration is required for this one piece, it can be found in the well-recognized shrine-like character of the architectural design here so carefully and precisely elaborated. Whatever else the Tushingham panel may or may not be, it is admittedly a portable sanctuary, conveniently designed to be suspended from a wall. Since it is obviously a religious object, an indicative lead toward a definition or description of its purpose or function is to be found in the primary process of religious classification. To which of the major religious systems, current in Mediterranean society during the Roman imperial era, did this little monument appertain? What 83</page><page sequence="29">4HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBYR was its own religious attachment? Was it a Jewish religious object, possessed and used by a Jewish family? Or was it a Christian artifact, valued by a loyal devotee of the Lord Christ? Or was it a pagan item, belonging to some member of a Gentile cult brotherhood ? A priori this plaque may have been any one of these three. Or it might have been, neutrally and synthetically, all three of these together and at once. That is at least conceivable. In view of the official religious exclusiveness openly asserted by the Jewish and Christian groups, however, though not by the pagans, that sort of synthesis would practically be exceptional and unusual, if not even unlikely. With reason, therefore, and in the interest of brevity and non-delay, we may revert to the tripartite discrimination initially proposed: Pagan, Jewish, or Christian? Faced with this triple choice in classification, the present-day student is baffled to observe that the Tushingham panel itself is singularly neutral and non-committal in its patterning and layout (P1. I). For the most part very simple and familiar geometric forms are here presented in non-representational schemes and arrange- ments. Commonest are the circles, always carefully centered, and executed in various sizes and depths. Most prominent is the semi- circle as the intervening or integrating member of the entire arrangement. The substructure at the bottom of the plaque is plain and oblong and box-like. Is one to interpret it as an altar or a reliquary? It might be either one of these furnishings, and as such it might be either Christian or Pagan or even Jewish for that matter! So also the crowning gable at the top, with its striations at the apex, and the circles lower down, and the mysterious curvaceous cavities at the outer angles-it too continues to be quite non- indicative. Pagans, Christians, Jews, all with equal aptitude made good use of the gable as a culminating element in religious building. If positively the Tushingham patterns say little about the religious connections of the plaque, negatively there is also a conspicuous absence of identifying symbols and traits from this ensemble. We have already observed that very frequent and very prominent on disk plaques of the architectural class are images of the Menorah. These fit consonently with their architectural settings, and they proclaim the panel to be a Jewish piece. From 84</page><page sequence="30">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE the Tushingham tablet there are lacking not only the Menorahs, but also all the other familiar Jewish symbols: Lulab, Ethrog, Shofar, Incense Shovel, Torah Scroll, etc. Equally and just as evidently all familiar and accepted Christian symbols are here absent: Cross and chrism, fish and anchor, Good Shepherd and sheep, dove and rooster and peacock, etc. By no specific symbol or device or inscription does this panel assert itself to be a Christian object. Here negative absence of evidence has unusual force and weight, for Jews earlier and Christians later were not reticent about putting identifying marks of their own on other valued disk plaques. Accordingly the negative evidence-the absence of recognizable Jewish and Christian emblems-combines with such positive evi- dence as there is -the sheer neutrality of most of the patterns on the panel-to suggest a careful investigation of the proposition that this may have been a pagan artifact, and accordingly itself neither Jewish nor Christian. In order to emphasize the congeniality of the arch-and-gable type of shrine in pagan use, in the Syro-Palestinian area, and in Roman imperial times, attention is here called to the phenomenal pairs of enshrined Astarte figurines extant from this era. Repeatedly the shrine-like structure moulded in relief on Astarte plaques is a niche of the arcuated gable type, very similar to that on the Tushingham terra cotta (P1. I), only more steeply extended to its apex. At the sides this steep gable is supported by a pair of rounded pilasters, not infrequently with rectangular dedication panels at their bases 30. The enshrined Astartes are apparently antithetical in appearance: one group being completely nude in the familiar pudique manner; the other group being completely clothed in a sack-like garment that extends from neck to ankles. Whether nude or clothed, the enshrined Astarte is regularly and actually the same individual 30 M.

This is fully demonstrated by identities of physiognomy and hair-do and headdress and necklace that distinguish this considerable tribe of Astartes, both the clothed and the unclothed goddesses. External appearances to the contrary notwithstanding, these As- tartes are all identical twins as to type. Examples of them are somewhat numerous in major archaeological collections today. Sometimes, as in the Louvre, it is possible to study side by side an unclothed and a vested Astarte, both ensconced in arcuated- and-gabled shrines that are identical or nearly so, and are not dissimilar to the Tushingham sanctuary. In the popular Near Eastern Astarte cult of the Roman period, the arch-gable type of shrine had particular association with the Astarte figurine itself, whether nude or vested in a formless one-piece garment. It was a popular pagan enframement for a popular pagan image. On the Tushingham plaque, however, there stands no anthro- pomorphic imagery, least of all a dea nutrix, beneath the arcuated gable. This negating circumstance makes it urgent to observe carefully just what is represented beneath that intervening, semi- circular arch (P1. I). Previously we have loosely and carelessly characterized this feature as a "conch". That expression is here defi- nitely wrong in any exact and literal, Latin or Greek, understanding of the term. What is shown here is not at all the concave interior of a bivalve seashell. Rather it is a concave semicircle patterned with the narrow, radiating, and ever-enlarging segments of a circle. The radiant flutings are not modelled from the curved and rounded ribs of a scallop shell. Rather they are formed by sharp and straight lines that isolate the segments, each one in turn. The precedent for the pattern is not marine and crustaceous; it is rather geometric and solar. The flutings as a sequence do not radiate from the hinge of a two-leaved shell. Instead they expand outward and upward from the upper two-thirds of a most carefully centered circle. This circular focus is best understood and explained as representing or suggesting the rising and/or setting sun, pausing exactly on the horizon. Sunrise or sunset is the moment here typified or symbolized. Entirely harmonious with the sun-at-horizon interpretation are 31 Macalister, op. cit., Vol. I, p. 309; Vol. III, P1. CXVI. 86</page><page sequence="32">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE the color phenomena that enliven the concave half circle. The expanding rays are polychrome and the colors are laid on in vari- form fashion. They are red and blue and yellow, though the latter color has now all but disappeared. Some of the radiating segments are in solid color, while others are dappled or striated. In a rather gay and decorative manner it does remind one of a colorful sunset or dawn, when "red at night is sailor's delight", or "red in the morning is sailor's warning". Supplementing and re-enforcing the solar interpretation of the central concavity, are the repeated full circles engrossed above and below it on the Tushingham tablet (P1. I). A larger and a smaller circle, respectively on the base and in the apex, once carried glass disks wherefrom the light of the sun was reflected whenever present. Also still smaller circles, precisely cocentered and done in outline only, echoed and re-echoed the perfect shape of the sun's own orb. In summary, it is the sun itself that is here symbolized and represented and glorified in the eminently religious and shrine- like setting of the Tushingham plaque. In a very simple and con- centrated and efficient manner the panel seems designed to serve as a focalizing cult object for the henotheistic solar religionists of Roman imperial times. Thus today's students can best understand and assess the specific religious values of the Tushingham panel as they are indicated in the outstanding feature of its design (P1. I). In the mid-section concavity a clear solar symbol has definitely replaced an expected conch. Therein is the main meaning of the entire design32. Just here it is timely to pause, if only for a moment, to recall the significance of solar henotheism, not only for Syria and the Syrians, but also for Rome and the Romans, in the third century 82 Instructive parallels to the rayed sun pattern on the Tushingham plaque may be investigated in the enshrined lunettes on Coptic grave steles of the late imperial centuries. Among the radiate lunettes in this group of monuments the blossom-like patterns clearly represent composite flowers with expanding petals. Similarly the shell-like patterns envisage conches, properly so-called. Likewise the flat, linear, geometric patterns represent the sun disk with its expanding rays of light. See W. E. Crum, Coptic Monu- ments. Cairo (1902), P1. XXXTV, Nos. 8595, 8596, 8597; P1. XXXVII, Nos. 8615, 8617; P1. XXXVIII, Nos. 8618, 8621; P1. LII, No. 8696.

Through Hellenistic and Roman times, the ancient and crude pantheism of native Syrian religion had developed into what at its best was an elevated solar henotheism. This was not a forced and abnormal process. It was a remarkably normal and natural and to-be-expected development under the circum- stances of the period and area and people. The sun, conspicuously the most glorious and potent and salutary among the astronomical bodies, had become exalted and revered as the representative, the image, the embodiment of the supreme power of the universe, even of the Most High Deity. M. Cumont phrased the culminating conception thus: "The radiant star that gives us light became the visible image of the supreme power, the source of all life and all intelligence, the intermediary between an inaccessible god and man- kind, and the one object of special homage from the multitude." 33 For imperial Rome, in her religious and political policies, this theological evolution had striking and far-reaching consequences. There were times in the third century when the imperial chief of state was himself a fanatical pontiff of a Syrian sun cult, or even a statesmanly organizer and director of a henotheistic religion. Elagabalus (218-222) was the priestly princeps, named from his own sun god of Emesa. Whatever may be the ultimate and sober rating of the religious activities or eccentricities of Elagabalus, there can be no doubt of the highly deserved respect that history has accorded the Emperor Aurelian (270-275), the conqueror of the fabulous Queen Zenobia of Palmyra. He is recognized as a statesman in imperial religious policy as well as in matters political. In 273, after a triumphal return to Rome from various frontier successes, he built there a magnificent Templum Solis, the remains of which are still under vigorous investigation and discussion. His god Sol was a synthesis of the Graeco-Roman Helius and the Oriental Ba'alim. Here at the imperial center he was officially proclaimed as the dominus imperii Romani and his cult was organized to be an inclusive and unifying Roman paganism, with a special college of Roman senatorial pontifices. Thus an Oriental solar henotheism, established in cultic fashion under imperial auspices at the capital itself, stood out as an immediate antecedent to the ultimate triumph 33 Franz Cumont, The Oriental Religions in Roman Paganism. Chicago: Open Court (1911), pp. 133-134. 88</page><page sequence="34">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE of Christianity in Roman society in the century that followed forthwith. As the matter progressed interrelatedly, solar henotheism turned out to be a long stride in direct line toward Christian monotheism, which finally became the official religion of the Roman state 34 Even as a very minor monument of the highly auspicious and potentially promising henotheistic sun cult, the Tushingham panel possesses a distinctiveness and an interest all its own, far out of proportion to its comparatively small size. Here is a religious association item that is eminently worth knowing for its full import and for its lofty significances, both Oriental theistic and Roman imperial. In a very neat and a rather minute manner, it monu- mentalizes the advance of solar henotheism in the direction of the ultimately triumphant Christian monotheism of the fourth century. Concretely in the middle of the plaque itself this is accomplished by the replacement of a conch by a clear and elaborated and colorful solar symbol. Just exactly here, we reiterate purposefully, is concentrated the chief religious emphasis and import of the Tushing- ham tablet. To make this affirmation concrete and explicit, in detailed interpretation, is the remaining opportunity of this investigation. VI Having classified the Tushingham plaque as a miniature monu- ment of the Oriental-Roman sun cult, thereby we have taken on ourselves the responsibility to state concretely and in detail just what were its religious uses. We have noted the tiny hole in its apex. Where was the panel intended to be hung? Suspended there, what religious value was assigned to it? How were people supposed to deport themselves religiously in relation to it? In attempting to answer questions of this kind we are not indeed lacking present guidance. All the investigation and discussion of other glass disk objects constitute a capital fund of recorded scholarly experience that has more or less of relevance for the special and peculiar problems of the Tushingham panel. Formally 34 Idem, "La Th6ologie solaire du paganisme Romain", Memoires presentes d L'Acaddmie des Inscriptions et Belles-Lettres.

In largest numbers these are Hellenistic-Jewish objects. The Menorahs carved on them accredit their Jewishness. For a period of upward to two decades these have been closely scrutinized, earlier by the formidable duo Mayer and Reifenberg 35, and later by Erwin Goodenough 36. All three of these scholars, two of them Jewish and one of them Christian, agree on the domestic use of architectonic plaques in Jewish homes by Jewish households. One of the three, the Christian scholar, would also emphasize the cemeterial use of such tablets in Jewish tombs as well as in Jewish homes. Arguing from such concrete matters as size, structure, design, and architectonics, it seems altogether probable that the Tushingham panel, formally similar to the Jewish pieces, had like them similar dual functions, domestic and funereal, in its own pagan milieu. It is of course quite true that this line of inference is an extrapolation. Even so, the outcome of it calls for minute and open-minded consideration. There is agreement, then, between leading archaeologists, Jewish and Christian, that a prime domestic utilization of disk tablets was to indicate the direction in which acts of worship should be performed. Hung on the wall of a home, the panel showed in what direction the devotee should face during the enactment of his devotions. Here it is not necessary to labor the importance of liturgical orientation in the major religious systems of mankind. Familiar and large-scale examples are the location of the Christian altar at the "eastern" end of the church, and the placement of the Mihrab, or prayer niche, in the Mohammedan mosque so that it will mark the direction toward Mecca. The Jewish domestic equivalent for this was hanging the so-called Mizrach tablet on the east wall of a room to make explicit the orientation for prayers. Indeed the very name Mizrach meant literally "the rising of the sun" or more generally "the East". It is familiar knowledge that so long as the temple stood in the Holy City, it was the chief determinant of direction in worship for the Sons of Israel. Increasingly from Rabbinic times onward, how- 35 Loc. cit. 36 Goodenough, op. cit., I, 174-177; IV, 124-126. 90</page><page sequence="36">THE RELIGIOUS IMPORT OF THE TUSHINGHAM PLAQUE ever, orthodox practise turned toward the Orient generally as the preferred direction. The purpose of the Mizrach panel was so to specify. The initial proposal of Mayer and Reifenberg was that the Dormition group of disk panels were originally thus utilized. To this nucleus Goodenough most recently added the nobly simple plaque in the Rudolf Jonas Collection in Haifa, a panel that strikingly resembles in its essentials the Tushingham artifact itself (P1. I) 37. Taking the cue from this familiar Jewish usage, we propose that the Tushingham tablet was a Gentile sun-cult equivalent for a Mizrach design, literally a pointer for the orientation of sun-worship. Hung on the wall of a room in a Gentile home it said: "This is the direction of the rising sun! Enact your devotions in this direction!!" The artifact was excellently suited to such a use as this. The central rayed semicircle presented the rising sun in all its poly- chrome splendor. Glass disk medallions above and below ex- emplified the perfect shape of the sun's orb, and its origination of health-giving light. The Jew in the presence of a disk tablet, with shrine-like design and medallions of light, felt himself to be in the presence of the Shekinah itself, the divine light-being that consecrated the very Holy of Holies in the temple, or the Torah niche in the synagogue. Not dissimilar was the experience of the Gentile sun worshipper in the presence of such a miniature sanctuary as the Tushingham panel. Here was represented to him the Divine Sun, the form and embodi- ment of eternal light, the supreme symbol of the ineffable and Most High God. In that presence actions of worship were the appropriate religious procedures. Even more convincingly can the cemeterial function of disk plaques be demonstrated, along with their above-ground and domestic utilization by households. They were suspended in tombs and cenotaphs, surface and subterranean, as well as on the walls of houses. It is a fact already noted that the large majority of disk plaques are modernly recovered from tombs rather than elsewhere. The interpretation of the funereal function of disk plaques has been worked out in reference to the main aspects of these objects that have already been stressed: the sanctuary-like character of their architectural appointments, and the symbolic suggestiveness 87 Idem, Vol. IV, p. 124 f., Fig. 49. 91</page><page sequence="37">HAROLD R. WILLOUGHBY of their glass disks. The shrine proclaimed the religiosity and sanctity of the object shown or the idea symbolized within its structure. Materially this was the glass disk that automatically reflected light, that light being the intimation or suggestion of all the richness and goodness and worthwhileness of life itself. Down in the darkness of the tomb this association was inevitably co- ordinated with the remarkably persistent human hope for a full, eternal, everlasting life for humankind, even after the apparent tragedy of physical death. The Jew in that connection thought of the Shekinah, the divine Light, as the source and guarantor of on-going life for men also. Not less realistic assurance did the pagan sun-cultist have as his very own. To him the glass disks reflected the light of the Divine Sun itself, the source of all health and well- being and goodness and completeness, now and always. Such was the wealth of religious import and implication that the devotee of the Sun could find in a solar plaque like the Tushingham tablet, even or especially in the milieu of a tomb. In relation to the continuing hope for fulness of life after death, as well as in relation to current religious needs and interests and activities and aspirations, the Tushingham panel was effectively designed to serve meaningful functions, particularly in the experien- ce of a Gentile devotee of the Divine Sun. Such in religious terminol- ogy is the singular solar significance of this fascinating plaque from the eastern confines of the Roman Empire in later imperial times 38.
