<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE LITERARY NECESSITY OF ANTHROPOMORPHISM By ALFRED C. SCHLESINGER Oberlin College The anthropomorphism of Homer's gods is familiar to us all.But are we aware that this fundamental trait of epic deity is largely superficial? Outstanding scholars' are aware that the humanity of the gods can, like reports of death, be greatly exaggerated; but amateurs in Homer like the author cannot be sure that all of their elders and betters are sound on this point.2 I present therefore, without pretensions to originality, the following principle to be observed in thinking about Homeric gods: that whenever a writer wants to draw a vivid picture of deity acting specifically in this world, that author must assume deity to be anthropomorphic.3 This assumption has only a distant connection with religious belief ;it is a literary matter, and since, as Solon said, "Bards tell many lies," we must not take such literary anthropomorphism too seriously. We must distinguish between theology and creative imagination. In recent times, few, I suppose, have mistaken Homer for a theo- logian; therefore it is important to look for literary motives in his pictures of the gods, for he must have been an able literary man.4 Now a literary man may believe that the gods transcend all human limitations; but he cannot show the gods in action, unless he makes 1 U. von Wilamowitz-Moellendorff, Der Glaube der Hellenen: Berlin, Weidmann (1931) I, 333; M.

In describing the gods one must discard either concrete- ness or theological accuracy, and Homer kept concreteness. This quality, shown in the minute descriptions of dressing and sacrific- ing, must have been a main principle of composition for the poet; for that matter, was a Greek ever satisfied with vagueness? That such treatment of the gods was not repugnant to him is a signifi- cant point, of course; but if we want to appraise his theology, we may not use as evidence his literary creations. In what instances, then, does Homer, for literary effect, deny his own beliefs about the gods? A neat minor instance will serve as introduction and type. The gods are free from all cares, eSa C~Oovres.5 But how busy, yes, and troubled,6 the gods are while Troy is besieged and later when Odysseus is making his way home! But the busyness of the gods is a literary creation; if we want theology, we must stick to beta ~-Covres and disregard excep- tions. This same procedure serves in the more serious matters. Omni- presence is an attribute of deity which we consider indispensable. It seems also to be the attribute with which Homer's gods are most obviously not equipped. There is a gallery of brilliant action- pictures showing the gods moving from here to there (Apollo's descent from Olympus, A 44-47 will serve for example). An occa- sional vacation among the Ethiopians seems also to be a fixture of the Olympian season. But if we look more closely we find this fixing of the gods in space is really just a literary device of notable effectiveness. For, if we investigate, we find that the gods are seldom limited or hampered by space-restrictions.' A god often conquers space by moving at supernatural speed "like a feather or a thought";8 often he acts at a definite range, but one far beyond that of any mortal.9 The omnipresence of the Muses (B 6 Cf. especially 0~ 525-526, and the picture of Olympus (" 41-46) which fits perfectly into Lucretius' scheme, N. D. II, 18-24. 6 E.g., Thetis' sorrow, 2; 50-64, 02 91, and Zeus's, II 431-438, 459-461. 7 Outstanding exceptions to this statement will be dealt with below. 8 E.g., Athena checks Achilles, A 194 f. 9 As when Apollo oversees the battle from the citadel of Troy (A 507 f.). Long-distance hearing of prayers occurs often, A 43, A 357, I 571 f., 2 35. Cf. also K 274-276, T 48-53.</page><page sequence="3">ANTHROPOMORPHISM 21 485) and of Helios (X109 et al.) is, of course, a special attribute of these particular divinities, but in E 23, we find an excellent example of divine action from afar-Hephaestus, presumably from Olympus, saves a son of his priest from the prowess of Diomedes. But since this is a minor matter, the poet chose not to make a distinct picture out of Hephaestus' intervention. An equally strik- ing example occurs in 0 311 where Apollo, from Olympus, to which the gods are confined by Zeus, turns Teucer's arrow away from Hector. We may say then, that Homer's gods have at least a negative omnipresence, in that they are not kept from acting by considerations of space. For literary purposes they are usually represented as acting so that men can comprehend and picture their actions. Omniscience, too, should be an attribute of deity. We find it so stated in the Odyssey.10 But the poet does not hesitate to limit the knowledge of the gods when it suits his convenience. That Ares does not know instantly of his son's death (N 521) appears to be a device of the poet to remind us that most of the gods are out of the battle at the moment, as Zeus had commanded." But a con- tradiction of more importance is the deceiving of Zeus by Hera.'2 Here too, we can see literary necessity at work. Since Zeus's plans are well known to us, and since their completion will usher in the end of the story, our poet seeks a means to secure suspense through the postponing of these plans. How can that be done? Here we touch on a very difficult problem; viz., how can an omnipotent deity be so slow about fulfilling his purposes? A modern must take refuge in refusing to claim knowledge of God's purposes; but Homer, by taking the gods as characters in his poem, has com- 10 6 379 and 468. Nitzch, followed by Buchholz, Hornm. Realien, III, 28, takes this to mean that the gods know much more than mortals, but not really everything-i.e., it is loosely used as one uses a similar expression about certain encyclopedic individuals. This interpretation will do for the passages in question, but I doubt if the poet in- tended his remark as less than a literal expression of obvious fact. n The debates of the gods, (e.g., H 646-651, X 174) are, of course, also minor literary devices to promote suspense and emphasis. Thetis' question to Achilles (A 362) is due not to ignorance, but to motherliness, as Achilles reminds us (365). Buchholz (III, 27- 28) takes these matters far too seriously. 12  153-165. The story of an earlier tricking of Zeus by Hera, T 95-99. is discussed below.</page><page sequence="4">22 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL mitted himself to the author's duty of knowing why they do as they do; his refuge therefore, is the convenient assumption that one god limits the activity of another. This, of course, is almost a necessity of polytheism; and Plato's principlel3 that no god thwarts another, is well on the way to monotheism-myriadarian, perhaps, but still monotheism. With this we come to a prolific source of superficial anthropomorphism-the problem of divine interrelations. This problem has its difficulties; and for non-theo- logical literary purposes one settles them best by treating the gods as human beings. The other gods are, of course, inferior in rank to Zeus, father of gods and men. Therefore they, obviously, will not surpass him in the unrestricted use of power. Moreover there are numberless gradations in the ranking of the gods and daemones; and when we come to sea-gods and nymphs, we find them perhaps a little higher than the angels, but clearly far from omnipotent. This solution works beautifully as long as we forget the philo- sophical contradictions it creates. Homer's faculty for forgetting such things was excellent, and his readers should follow his lead. Here then we find the root of much of Homer's anthropomorphism -the difficulty of reconciling the actions of the gods with the attri- butes of God. We have now begun a discussion of omnipotence or the lack of omnipotence in these epics. Theologically, the gods are omnipo- tent;14 yet in the course of the stories, we find many exceptions to the rule. The most striking limitations on the power of the gods are, first, that they cannot change the past, (Z 53f.) and, second, that they cannot in the long run keep a man from death (-y 236- 238). How the modern philosopher thinks on these points I do not know; the modern layman must, I suppose, admit that at least the gods never have changed the past, or kept a man from death. Of course, Homer knows of immortality stories,'" but these are literature rather than theology. But Homer does all we can expect of him with these tenebrous problems. 13 Republic nr, 378 C. 14 K 306; cf. T 90, t 445, 6 237. 15 Tithonus, A 1, e 1; cf. in e 135 f., 206-210, Calypso's plan for Odysseus. We cannot expect Homer to avoid the problem of death by regarding it as a blessing; cf. Achilles' remarks, X 488-491.</page><page sequence="5">ANTHROPOMORPHISM 23 In other passages with different difficulties we find quite plainly the key to the apparent helplessness of the gods. Thus, Zeus can- not save his son Sarpedon (II 431-438), Poseidon cannot destroy Odysseus (e 339-341), and the gods cannot steal Hector's body away from Achilles because Thetis is so near to her son ( 9 71-73). Here we see clearly the fundamental distinction. The group of gods is omnipotent; the individual god is not omnipotent against his fellow.'6 Zeus can be omnipotent if he chooses, but he finds it better to be a constitutional monarch and not override that con- sensus of Olympian opinion which is Moira or Aisa.7 Conflicts between the gods subordinate to Zeus are decided in various ways -by seniority in some cases (cf. H 456f., T 105f., ? 329 f.), by letting the attacker overrule the defender in others (cf. A 51-54). This latter principle is invoked by Euripides in a similar dilemma in the Hippolytus (1328-30). These principles are theological; but purely literary motivation is freely used, too. How is Odysseus to be rescued against the will of Poseidon? Why, let Poseidon be away among the Ethiopians, and the trick can be plausibly done. As we saw above, the deceit of Zeus by Hera is purely a literary device-theologians keep out. These instances do not abrogate Homer's real code of divine action-they are passed, for enter- tainment purposes, under suspension of the rules. It is hardly worth while to mention such harmless minor traces of anthropomorphism as the costumes of the gods (, 170 f., E 733-747, etc.) or the fact that they feast (A 601-611) and go to bed (ibid.).18 These things are pure decoration, and necessary deco- ration, too, lest the life of the gods seem more barren than that of men. That Helios shines for gods as well as men is the most strik- 16 In this connection, we should note that one of the weaknesses charged against the gods, namely, their being attacked by men, is a by-product of Olympian disputes (E 383-384). 17 Homer never formally made up his mind that Fate was the agreement of the gods, but he usually follows this hypothesis. Zeus's power is recognized in A 566, O 23-27. In II 440-442, X 178-181 we see him keeping to the plan of the gods to avoid bad feel- ing and confusion. His use of the balances, O 69, X 209, is a superb bit of vividness; and when he wrote this Homer did not stop to distinguish between action appropri- ate to a subordinate and the ways of the ruler of the universe. 1s The debates of the gods are inserted by the poet as natural incidents without con- sideration of the implications. (See n. 10.)</page><page sequence="6">24 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL ing of these bits of divine humanity. But in a geocentric universe one can hardly expect the gods to be "east of the sun and west of the moon"; they will be near the center, and naturally will want the usual furnishings of the firmament for their enjoyment. We must, however, protest against the view'9 that food, or sleep, or sunlight, is necessary to the gods-is as essential to them as it is to mortals. For consider how Apollo20 swoops down from Olympus to send a plague on the Greek camp "and for nine days and nights the shafts of the god went their way through the camp." Where was Apollo then? Unless the great god has suddenly turned into a mere allegory, he was right there on the plains of Troy, shooting those shafts. He took no time out for refreshment. No, the gods are not bound by mortal limitations, even though, for literary effect they may behave like human beings. So far we have considered such literary anthropomorphism as is used for plot-weaving and description. We should not neglect, however, another literary factor, when we are evaluating Homer's religious ideas. This is the influence of characterization. The an- thropomorphic beliefs of Homer's heroes need not be the belief of their creator. A good example is Agamemnon's Ate myth, (T 90-144). Agamemnon is saving his face by blaming Ate, but we know, as the emperor's nobles knew, that the myth he uses to back his excuse is not to be taken seriously-in fact, we are almost required to disbelieve it.21 For as Zeus says elsewhere (a 32-34), men blame the gods for their own obvious failings.22 We may not, then, attribute to the poet the beliefs of his characters unless the context justifies us. Again, we must beware of drawing serious conclusions from 19 Moore, op. cit., 9. 20 A 53. 21 I feel some doubt of Homer's belief in these old tales which he lets his characters rehearse. This particular one is a definitely literary composition, since it belongs to the Heracles cycle, which is folk-tale, not myth. (cf. M. P. Nilsson, The Mycenean Origin of Greek Mythology: Berkeley, Univ. of Cal. Press (1932), Chap. III). 22 Other examples (cf. Buchholz, op. cit., III, 33): r 365; y 159-161; X 555; v 201. Hector's famous speech, M 231-250, does not, as is often thought, argue a disbelief in omens on the part of the poet, but quite the opposite, for this is the beginning of Hec- tor's ate, which leads to his death; he is wrong in not heeding Polydamas. I believe the rebirth of faith in Laertes (w 351) is also in character, but cf. Wilamowitz, op. cit., I, 18, n. 2,</page><page sequence="7">A NTHROPOMORPHISM 25 humorous anthropomorphism. No one doubts, I suppose, that the banquet of the gods at the end of A is intended as comic relief. It is sometimes interpreted as religious decadence-an indication of waning belief in the gods here portrayed. I venture to suggest that quite the opposite is true; that the humorous effect lies pre- cisely in the contrast between the greatness of the gods and the humanity of their remarks and actions. The irreligious humor of Lucian (or the Soviets) is something different. It is well known that a bishop falling down stairs is much funnier than an ordinary person falling down stairs, and precisely because one regards the bishop with a certain amount of awe. The modern version of Sir Walter Raleigh and Queen Elizabeth-said Sir Walter, "Step on it, kid, and let's go"-is in the same category; the effect depends on our belief that the Queen and Sir Walter were people of distinc- tion and dignity. The lay of Demodocus, often considered irreli- gious, and so probably a late interpolation, is also, I think, clearly intended as humor. Ares and Aphrodite come off badly, of course; but they are not first-class divinities,23 and we cannot assume that a lack of awe toward them is a sign that the poet is irreligious. Calypso's outburst (E 118-144) is again a delightful bit of humor; the old tales she hurls at Hermes' luckless head, are not a serious indictment of the gods; we are again being entertained by the ascription to a divinity of a very human foible (a feminine device marked by recent authors as well), for Calypso takes pains to point out that she is a much-put-upon and very obliging person to do what, as a matter of fact, she has no real objection to doing. It really must have been a great relief to her to be compelled to get rid of the lacrymose Odysseus; he was hardly good company, and Zeus saved Calypso from openly failing to hold her man. Obvious belittling of the gods as a means of humor must not be interpreted as revealing Homer's religious views. 23 Cf. Athena's instructions to Diomedes, E 130-132, and the subsequent events in that book; also, perhaps, Helen's outburst, r 399-412. Did Homer begrudge Ares and Aphrodite their place on Olympus because they were foreigners (Wilamowitz, op. cit., I, 321)? Or were they personifications rather than personalities, and so needed not to be respected though they were guarded against? In any case, these two gods do not rank with the greatest gods, Zeus, Athena, and Apollo (B 371, A 288, 11 97), nor with that great (though less great) pair, Hera and Poseidon,</page><page sequence="8">26 THE CLASSICAL JOURNAL What then, are the conclusions in this matter? In writing about the gods, Homer is chiefly guided by literary motives; this is neces- sarily true where details are required. We must, therefore, look below the surface for the true religious ideas of his time, for the most conspicuous passages about the gods are precisely the places where they will not be found in explicit form. When we find these real religious ideas, they are respectable, mature views,24 though the poet and his audience have no objection to naivet" or travesty in the working out of detailed pictures of the gods. Moreover, in these religious views, there is no bar to the theory of the unity of Homer; the contradictions and inadequacies are superficial, and, while theologically shocking, are entirely acceptable as poetry. 24 In appraising the moral failures of Homer's gods we should be sure whether these are really seriously believed, or rather, are mere literary devices, that is, passing whims of the poet's fancy. The poet himself recognized that the gods were often traduced by men (a 33), and would probably have been willing to admit his own guilt in this matter, if Plato had been there to point it out. For the ordinary man, untrained as a thinker, there is a distinction between what he believes and what he does not disbelieve, since his mental attic may harbor much bric-a-brac which he never bothers to clear out. It would be well, then, to distinguish between Homeric failures to reject mistakes about the gods, and the positive religious thinking of the time.</page></plain_text>
