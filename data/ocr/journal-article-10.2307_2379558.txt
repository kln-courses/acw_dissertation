<plain_text><page sequence="1">ROOTS OF REVOLUTION: A HISTORY OF THE POPULIST AND SOCIALIST MOVEMENTS IN NINETEENTH CENTURY RUSSIA. By Franco Venturi. Translated by Francis Haskell. In- troduction by Isaiah Berlin. New York: Al- fred A. Knopf, Inc., 1960. Pp. xxxvi+850. $12.75. The appearance of a smooth and competent English translation of Professor Venturi's two- volume Italian work, II Populismo Russo (1952), is an event of major significance for students of the social and intellectual history of modern Russia. The author, a professor of modern history at Turin University and son of the distinguished art critic Lionello Venturi, completed the bulk of his meticulous research for this book in Moscow and Leningrad librar- ies during an extended tour of duty as Italian cultural attache. His mastery of the Russian sources, both primary and secondary, is un- paralleled. The more than seventeen hundred footnotes grouped at the end of the volume constitute a detailed critical bibliography for the period 1848-81. The 720 closely set pages of Venturi's nar- rative are uniformly clear and interesting; spe- cialists have testified to the accuracy of his retelling of the institutional and personal his- tory of the period. With the minor exceptions noted below, his tracing of the development of religious, ethical, social, and political ideas and attitudes is balanced, comprehensive, scrupu- lous in scholarship, and perceptive in interpre- tation. The heart of the book for students of Russian intellectual history will be the half- dozen chapters devoted in whole or in part to the social and political views of Herzen, Baku- nin, Chernyshevski, Dobrolyubov, Nechayev, Tkachyov, and Lavrov, together with the brief- er discussions of the views of Belinski, Ogar- yov, Pisarev, Kropotkin, et al. Especially il- luminating are the chapters on Nechayev ("the Russian Blanquist") and Tkachyov ("the Rus- sian Jacobin"). The discussion of Chernyshevski, while pro- viding a useful corrective to the near-caricature of certain earlier studies, occasionally goes too far in its effort to present Chernyshevski's so- cial and political philosophy as a reasonable and coherent doctrine. This image is contra- dicted by Chernyshevski's two chief works in philosophy, the violent and doctrinaire Aes- thetic Relation of Art to Reality of 1855 (which Venturi dismisses with the comment that its author was temperamentally unsuited to the study of aesthetics [p. 141]) and the rambling and ill-tempered Anthropological Principle in Philosophy of 1860 (which Venturi simply ignores). Isaiah Berlin partly redresses the balance by emphasizing Chernyshevski's "harsh, flat, dull, humourless, grating" style and the vagueness and inconsistency of his so- cial program (pp. xxii, xxiii). It might be added that the "scientific" grounding of ethics upon which Chernyshevski set such store is particu- larly incoherent. Venturi seems to me unfair to Lavrov's best- known work in social philosophy, the Historical Letters (1868-69) when he says that it "has obviously not worn well" (p. 450). In fact this work-though not brilliant-is much less dated than the two treatises of Chernyshevski just mentioned. However, it remains virtually unknown to present-day Soviet readers, where- as Chernyshevski's essays are required ideologi- cal fare. By failing to distinguish between the earlier and later writings of Pisarev, Venturi gives the misleading impression that Pisarev tried to combine an individualistic ethics of "emanci- pation of the human person" with a calculating social utilitarianism (p. 328). In fact, in his brief career as a literary and social critic, Pisarev moved from the first to the second po- sition. Moreover, he did not adopt the term "nihilism" to identify his own position (early or late), as claimed on page 327. He always called himself a "realist"-though, to be sure, he meant by "realism" what most of his con- temporaries, including Turgenev in Fathers and Sons, called "nihilism." This nihilism, Venturi remarks, was "at the very source of the stream which flowed both into Russian Bakuninism and into Tkachyov's Jacobinism. If we put emphasis on individual revolt and personal 'refractoriness,' we arrive at anarchism; if on the other hand we stress the political function of an enlightened and</page><page sequence="2">148 ETHICS decided [i.e., "resolute"] minority, we arrive at Jacobinism and the theory of a revolutionary elite" (p. 330). Unfortunately, such brief but perceptive generalizations are often submerged in the main stream of Venturi's narrative. To bring them into greater prominence, and to make the book more manageable, it might be helpful to subdivide the extremely long chapters, whose brief headings frequently fail to specify all the individuals and doctrines which they discuss. As Venturi makes clear, the uncritical as- sumption, shared by virtually all of the Popu- lists and Socialists of nineteenth-century Rus- sia-but perhaps insisted upon most by Bakunin namely, that freedom and equality are fully compatible when maximized, found early criti- cism among Russian thinkers. First Danilevski (p. 88) and then Tkachyov and Turski (p. 780), pointed to their incompatibility-the for- mer, like Nietzsche and Berdyaev later, opting for freedom, while the latter placed supreme value on equality. Venturi focuses upon "revolutionary Popu- lism," deliberately neglecting its "legal" coun- terpart, and thus omits discussion of the views of N. K. Mikhailovski. Yet, as Isaiah Berlin reminds us, the individualism and rationalism of both Lavrov and Mikhailovski were at the heart of Populist ideology (p. xix). This omis- sion is particularly regrettable in that the work of Mikhailovski, as Venturi sometimes appears to admit (e.g., p. 694), formed a bridge be- tween the two species of Populism. On the whole, Venturi is admirably impar- tial; but he occasionally seems to identify him- self with the point of view of the revolution- aries, for example, in sharing their impatience with Russian liberals. He characterizes the gen- erally negative response of the Russian public to the murder of Alexander II (1881) as "re- actionary" (p. 713). A certain impersonality of idiom leads now and then to awkward or exaggerated locutions of the form: "Absolutism replied . .. ," "Popu- lism insisted . . . ," "Tsarism showed itself . . . , "Europe was outraged." The "isms" used to define the positions of various Rus- sian revolutionaries-Machiavellism, Jacobin- ism, Blanquism, Babeuvism, etc.-are not themselves defined. The distinction, for exam- ple, between Jacobinism and Blanquism never becomes quite clear. The detailed index of names lists some events and concepts; but it is haphazard in supplying first names or initials, and it does not cover the lively and informative introduc- tion. Mikhailovski, who is referred to at least five times in the text (and twice in the intro- duction) is not listed at all. Lev Tikhomirov has only one page reference, although his name actually appears at least a dozen times in the text. There are a few minor errors, for ex- ample, Historiographie for Historiosophie (p. 41), "anthropomorphism" for "anthropolo- gism" (p. 322), "metaphysicists" for "meta- physicians" (p. 461), "Roger" for "Francis" Bacon (p. 841). For so polyglot a work the number of misprints is gratifyingly small. GEORGE L. KLINE Bryn Mawr College</page></plain_text>
