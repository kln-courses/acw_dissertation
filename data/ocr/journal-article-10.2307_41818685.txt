I].1 The vase was first published by Marina Martelli in 1987 who attributed it to a painter she named the Heptachord Painter.2 Actually, the main scene running around its surface represents five dancers engaged in acrobatic movements led by a smaller-size singer accompanying himself on a seven string instrument. Three of the dancers are armed. This scene was variously interpreted in the literature: Martelli suggested that it shows a ritual performance during a religious celebration;3 Erika Simon identified the musician as Orpheus with the Argonauts;4 Françoise-Hélène Pairault Massa identified the scene as the Dáctyloi Idaioi, consequently connecting the subject with Crete;5 Mauro Menichetti left the question of the subject open but agreed with Pairault Massa in connecting it with the Cretan tradition of the koûroi.6 Very few lines in such an extensive literature about the scene have been dedicated to the unusual shape of the arms of the musical instrument which gave its name to the painter. They have a winding shape with two joint S-curves, similar to inverted guitar outline. This distinctive feature Martelli attributed either to the artisťs poor knowledge of the instrument or his misunderstanding of the instrument's type which could have been introduced in Etruria during the first half of the seventh century BC, only a little before the vase was made.7 Martelli placed the instrument within the tradition of Terpandros,8 a famous musician from the same period who possibly introduced the seven-stringed lyre to Greece.9 The number of strings on the instrument is, however, in our opinion, not a crucial element and we agree with Bo Lawergren who, referring to Ekrem Akurgal's attribution of a dinos fragment from Athena's sanctuary in Smyrna to the same tradition,10 explained that "his belief -that later Greek lyres had seven strings - is not completely justified, for several reasons: (a) string counts on representations can be misleading ... (b) black-figure and red-figure vases show considerable variations in string count, ranging from 3 to 12."11 In addition to these points, some earlier Aegean and Eastern lyres are already showing seven strings and therefore their number, as stated by Lawer- gren, "seem less significant than is sometimes thought".12 In this article we will place this Etruscan depiction on the Würzburg vase in a wider iconographie context and present the evidence suggesting an alternative interpretation of this peculiar arm shape. Our survey starts with a lyre-type instrument showing the same rounded soundbox and a pair of multicurved arms depicted on the well-known Hubbard Amphora from Cyprus,13 where four dancers surround a player car- rying the lyre in his left hand [fig. 2]. Its dating is controversial, but Vassos Karageorghis confirmed Einar Gjerstad's indication to be from the end of the eighth century BC, thus somewhat slightly older than the image by the Heptachord Painter.14 © 2011 Research Center for Music Iconography CUNY 203</page><page sequence="2">Emiliano Li Castro &amp; Placido Scardina, The Double Curve Enigma 1.

An amphora from Kaloriziki (near Curium, Cyprus) depicts another chordophone equipped with two complex arms shown as a linear outline with zigzagging supports inside the instrument [fig. 3] .15 Daniel Paquette considered that these winding profiles of the two instruments had a structural function.16 Number of strings on these instruments varies but whatever their true number was, it would have been difficult for the painters of those sketchy depictions to represent them accurately. Going back in time from the Iron Age in Cyprus to the Late Bronze Age in Greece, arms in the shape similar to the ones painted on the Hubbard Amphora can be found on a jar fragment from Tiryns showing the upper part of a three-stringed lyre [fig. 4]. 17 The term "lyre" is used here in its generic meaning, and in order to distinguish the peculiar type of cor- dophone instrument discussed in this paper, phorminx would be a more convenient term to use.18 As a matter of fact, the latter word is by Homer and in early Greek poetry alternatively used with the term kitharis, indicating a stringed instrument associated with Apollo and played by professional musicians.19 The phorminx with its 204</page><page sequence="3">Music in Art XXXVI/ 1-2 (2011) 2.

Lefkosia, Cyprus Archaeological Museum, 1938/XI-2/3. rounded crescent-shaped soundbox, often with elaborate arms, is represented in iconographical sources dating back to the Aegean Bronze Age.20 Most of these evidence is dated to the Mycenaean period, from LH (Late Helladic) IIIA2 (1410 or 1325 BC21) to LH HIC (ca. 1200 BC)22 on the mainland and from Final Palatial LM (Late Minoic) IIIA1 (1490 or 1400 BC) to Post-Palatial LM HIB (1365 or 1275 BC) in Crete. At least three of them have analogous double curved arms: a wall painting from Nestor's Palace at Pylos [fig. 5], 23 the decorated sarco- phagus from Ayia Triadha [fig. 6], 24 and a wall painting from the same site widely acknowledged to be by the same hand as the sarcophagus.25 In all these representations the instrument's S-shaped arms rise from the soundbox, and they are decorated at the top with bird's head.26 The shorter forearms rise from the top of the finials and meet the yoke. Curiously enough, a comparable stringed instrument appears also in further Etruscan evidences of the sixth century BC,27 besides, the closest comparison to the instrument depicted on the Heptachord Painter's amphora is the miniaturized tridimensional model included in a terracotta group of four figurines from Palaikastro, a site in eastern Crete.28 The instrument is there held by a musician leading a round dance [fig. 7] . An earlier similar group of four dancers, which does not include a musician, was found at Kamilari, in south Crete [fig. 8]. 29 Also three circular buildings of various sizes, constructed in late LM II (ca. 1500 or 1400 BC) and went out of use before the end of LM IIIA2 (1365 or 1275 BC), were unearthed by Peter Warren just west of the Knossos Stratigraphical Museum; he identified these circular structures as dance platforms, connecting them with the passage from the Iliad about the shield which Hephaistos made for Achilles (XVIII:590-592).30 On the shield was depicted a x°P°Ç (dance [-place]) which, Homer says, is like the one that Daidalos once fashioned at Knossos for Ariadne. One of the most complex phorminx is represented on a pyxis by the Khania Workshop from Kalami Apokoro- nou in northwest Crete [fig. 9] .31 The instrument is depicted having two composite arms structurally comparable with those shown on the amphora from Kaloriziki, and the crescent-shaped body with short protrusions at the base of the limbs which continue up forming thin vertical supports for parallel S-shaped arms holding the crossbar. On many of these representations the crescent-shaped soundbox appears suspiciously narrow and thus unable to conveniently amplify the vibrations produced by the strings. Given that our representations are two-dimensional frontal views, we might consider the possibility of a horizontally developed body, virtually invisible in orthogonal views. Such a body could be even a separate resonator, like a wooden or a clay vessel, section of a gourd, shell of a tortoise laying on the back, or else, with or without a skin to cover the opening, that has been adopted to reinforce the sound of the instrument. At least in three cases it would be possible to imagine structure of this kind: the pyxis from Khania, a button sealstone from Knossos [fig. 10], 32 and a cylinder seal from Mardin which is a fairly distant place from Crete [fig. II].33 205</page><page sequence="4">Emiliano Li Castro &amp; Placido Scardina, The Double Curve Enigma 3.

The instrument is imposing despite the fact that the scene is crowded with a (bird-headed?) player, big birds descending from above, horns of consecra- tion, double axes and various fillings. The presence of birds is usually considered as a manifestation of divine epiphany and furthermore they can evoke musical sounds with their singing and flying, but could also suggest an action caught in an open space.34 The two short protrusions on both sides of the instrument's resonator and straight supports paired with tall S-shaped arms suggest a composite structure, with elements assembled in a tricky but functional way. 206</page><page sequence="5">Music in Art XXXVI/ 1-2 (2011) 7.

The Knossos seal, securely dated to the Middle Bronze Age, is the earliest known depiction of this type of instrument in the Aegean area and the only one that does not belong to the Mycenaean period. Structure of the instrument it shows, looking like a phorminx with S-shaped arms inserted into a huge vessel resembling a squat hull, is at first sight comparable to that on the Khania pyxis.35 Moreover, a pair of puzzling elements in this representation might be identified with a strap for holding the instrument beside one arm and a plectrum secured to a band hanging down from the supposed resonator. The cylinder seal of yellow stone kept at the British Museum, presumably found at Mardin, in southeast Turkey, has been first dated to around 1200 BC, and later redated to around 1800 BC.36 No accurate comparison of this puzzling seal has been produced so far. Its style has some faint resemblances with the Anatolian group of seal impressions from the Levels Ib-II of Karum Kanesh in Kültepe37 and also shows some closer relations with the seals of the Siegelgruppe 1 coming from the border area between Anatolia and Syria dating to ca. 1830-1760 BC.38 Impression from the seal shows seven horizontal lines alternating standing birds, undefined signs,39 and horned animals [fig. 11]. An exception from the pattern is an imposing stringed instrument represented in a horizontal position near the raised (wing-like?) hand of the possible player sitting on a stool. The player is the only human-like figure (with a bird-head?) included in the scene. The lyre appears to have a wide soundbox of an odd shape. Its arms have winding profiles similar to those depicted on the Khania 208</page><page sequence="7">Music in Art XXXVI/ 1-2 (2011) 10.

One of the horned animals leaning forward in the upper row is smaller in size and placed just under the instrument. Its horn seems to be taking the place of the instrument's lower arm.40 A clearer example of "morphing" on this seal can be observed in a row of standing birds that suddenly changes into the head of the sitting creature, or in the head and neck of a bird coming out from beyond the yoke and recalling the outline of the instrument's upper arm. The only other depictions of round-based lyres with double curved arms we may take in comparison with that from Mardin are on one cylinder seal [fig. 12], and, perhaps on a seal impression on pottery [fig. 13], both from Tarsus in southern Turkey dating from approximately the same period.41 The two seals from Mardin and Tarsus have some other common elements such as the presence of animals,42 the horizontal position of the instruments, and the heads of anthropomorphic creatures which are bearing them, since the Tarsus player's head is apparently bird-like too.43 A few more seals excavated in the area between Anatolia and Syria dating to the second half of the third millennium show lyres with curved arm but they have square shape soundbox [figs. 14-16]. 44 These instruments are, however, too poorly represented to aid our iconogra- phical survey. An organological analysis of these instruments should be introduced by an outline of characteristics of the musical bow, the instrument which has its place at the origin of the chordophones. Its antiquity and general importance is maintained by ethnomusicolo gists and confirmed by some archaeologists.45 Musical bows are classified into three variants taking into account the relationship between the bow and resonator, which can be (1) kept apart from each other, (2) connected, or (3) having the mouth of performer used as the resonator.46 The last group, known as "mouth bows", can be played either as a rhythmical or a melodic in- strument and it is sometimes used in divination and magical healing.47 Instruments which could be considered direct descendants of the musical bow are the arched harps well known in Near East and Egypt since the third millennium BC.48 In Greek literature the "lyres" are clearly related to the bow used as a weapon. In Odyssey a parallel is drawn between Ulysses handling his bow and a skilled phorminx player; moreover the string of his bow is described to be singing like a swallow (XXII:406-411). Pindar too made comparisons between the phorminx and the bow, describing phorminx to be 209</page><page sequence="8">Emiliano Li Castro &amp; Placido Scardina, The Double Curve Enigma 11.

In the second millennium BC was developed the "composite" weapon bow which had the double curved profile. This efficient innovation not only greatly improved efficiency, but also brought about more resistance to the tension produced by its bending what in turn generated higher energy to propel its throw.52 During Late Bronze and Iron Ages the main production place for such a complex weapon in the eastern Mediterranean area was Crete,53 and the Cretan bowmen were during the Classical period held in greatest esteem.54 In its construction - which re- quired a high level of craftsmanship and much hard work55 - was used a variety of materials including horns of goat, its sinew, and probably a particular kind of palm wood ( phoenix theophr as- ti), which were both available on the island.56 Some of its parts were also made from precious materials.57 210</page><page sequence="9">Music in Art XXXVI/ 1-2 (2011) 12.

The acoustic quality of a stringed instrument could be generally improved in several ways, such as playing it in an adequately resounding space, constructing the instrument with an efficient resonating body, and/ or tightening on the instrument thicker strings producing louder sound. When the thickness of strings rises and their number increases, the tension applied to the instrument's frame tends to break its arms. This problem can be solved only through a static or a dynamic solution able to raise its maximum tensile stress. The static approach plainly implies stronger arms, hence more rigid and heavier, to support the crossbar; alternative is the development of a lighter and more elastic structure which can dynamically reacts to the 211</page><page sequence="10">Emiliano Li Castro &amp; Placido Scardina, The Double Curve Enigma 17.

The technical improvement attested in the "composite and reflex" bow could have been likewise employed to build an instrument equipped with elastic arms of a comparable kind and their actual shapes should have been quite similar to those represented on the above- mentioned depictions. Their winding profiles and sometime the adoption of an enlarged soundbox could demonstrate the various stages of its development aiming at improving the acoustic performance of the instrument and perhaps show how an advanced craftsmanship supported outstanding players when engaged with wider audiences. The concept which seems to start its development in Ancient Near East during the second half of the third millennium BC, become more evident in the Eastern Mediterranean area during the second millennium, and possibly reached its most refined version with the complex structure often depicted inside the arms of the great concert kithara on black- and red-figure Attic vases [fig. 17] ,58 The details of the main stringed instru- ment played by the best professional performers, particularly those shown on red-figure vases, are worth a closer look regarding an organological interpretation since, in our opinion, the elaborate system which is leaning against the inner wall in the lower part of Classical kithara' s arms is the final stage of a very long pro- cess of testing solutions for producing instruments with a louder sound played almost exclusively in musical contests and public performances. 212</page><page sequence="11">Music in Art XXXVI/ 1-2 (2011) 18.

II: Orient-Archäologie 7, 269, Only a few attempts at a reconstruction of this type of kithara were made in the last thirty years and none of them has this complex system fully replicated as an effective working device.59 Daniel Paquette suggested an interesting explanation for the mechanical functionality of this device based on a large collection of vase paintings [fig. 18],60 but some elements were still left unclear or contradicting to other evidence.61 Bo Lawer- gren emphasized repeatedly this device guessing its practical function.62 Stelios Psaroudãkes provided an accurate description of the details forming the lower arm referring to them as the "disc", "tail", "outcrop", and "bow", which in turn is propped up by the elaborate system "capital/ column/ base/ head/ horseshoe/ buttress" [fig. 19]. He concluded that "undoubtedly, the function of this system is to provide reaction in the opposite direction to that of the tension in the string."63 Despite of these converging opinions, we are still lacking a complete reconstruction of the concert kithara equipped with a working model of the fully develop- ed arm's support system. The concert kithara has been an exquisite achievement of acoustical engineering. Its first prototype could have been the real innovation attributed to Terpandros, which was later improved by his disciple Kepion,64 and brought to the perfection by the skillful Greek craftsmen who made further im- provements of stringed instruments during the sixth and fifth centuries BC. The challenging task to reproduce this very specialized instrument should take into consideration a reconstruction of all these elements which could have been contrived in a long-term process completed through ages and places as parts of a well-de- veloped mechanism, possibly adopting the same principles of the "composite" bow [fig. 20]. 213</page><page sequence="12">Emiliano Li Castro &amp; Placido Scardina, The Double Curve Enigma 20.

Franklin, s.v. Phorminx, The Homer Encyc- lopedia , ed. by Margalit Finkelberg (Oxford: Blackwell, in press). 19 The word kitharis probably indicates both the action of playing a string instrument and the instrument itself; it is worth noting that the etymology of the word kitharis might suggest a square body and that only the word phorminx is found connected with the adjective yfaupoprj, hint for a round-based instrument. The word kithara came in use only later on, from the Classical Age onward. On these points see: Susanna Sarti, "Kitharis e khitara : Origine e formazione di uno strumento musicale antico attraverso le fonti letterarie e figurative", Xenia antiqua II (Firenze: «L'Erma» di Bretschneider, 1993), 23-30. 20 For instance, see Younger, Music in Aegean Bronze Age, 18- 27 (s. v.

It is hard to see how so many details could have been independently conceived in Etruria and Crete, and one is reluctantly forced to admit some type of migration."

The four figurines come from a deposit in a storeroom that also in- cludes a fragmentary female figure with her hands on his breasts, three small birds, three larger birds, and several kernoi. A fragmentary circular base on which one of the small birds seems to fit was also considered by Warren in relation with the dancing group but doubt has been expressed about whether the base belongs with it. The hands of two of the dancers are joint; they stand facing inwards at right angles to one another, and forming the half of a hand-in-hand ring. The three dancers, as may be seen from the roughness of their bases, stood on the edge of some sort of clay support, all facing inwards, because their skirts just at the back are pinched over to grip the edge of the probably circular base; the figurines in such a reconstructed group, with the player standing in the middle of the ring, come suitably close together 215</page><page sequence="14">Emiliano Li Castro &amp; Placido Scardina, The Double Curve Enigma and would stand on a base about 16 cm in diameter. 29 Warren, "Circular Platforms at Minoan Knossos,,/ 318- 319, note 28, pl. 34d; Geraldine Cornelia Gesell, Town , Palace , and House Cult in Minoan Crete.

Beside the possible depictions of instrument there is a small figure with arms akimbo (above) and another object, looking like a horned quadruped closely facing the lyre (below). This crude evidence is however hard to evaluate in more detail. Both objects are dated to ca. 1800-1700 BC, but the seal has been alternatively dated to ca. 1000, or 1200-1350 BC; see Schuol, Hethi- tische Kultmusik, 55; Henri Frankfort, Cylinder Seals: A Documentary Essay on the Art and Religion of the Ancient Near East (London: MacMillan &amp; Co., 1939), 291; Goldman, Excavations at Gözlü Kule, Tarsus, vol.

The elasticity of the sinew means that when the bow is drawn it stretches and is put under tension. By contrast the strips of horn are compressed. Both substances there- fore react to propel the arrow. The bow is fitted with horn end- pieces into which the nocks for the string are carved". 53 "pour Y arc composite on faisait sans doute appel à des specialists crétois importés" (during the Mycenean Age and the Geometric period).

Although assuming a progressively stylized appearance, this subject displays another undeniable connection between the horned animal and the instrument's arm; see Marcelle Duchesne- Guillemin, "L'animal sur la cithare: Nouvelle lumière sur l'origi- ne sumérienne de la cithare grecque", Orientalia J.

A further explanation on the system's function is taken from a personal communication: "one of the main structural differences between the horse-shoe kithara and the large kithara is that in the latter instrument the arms consist of two parts, the lower arms and the upper arms. The upper arms are not in line with the lower ones, but are shifted inwardly. Furthermore, the lower arms are not straight, but curve outwards, creating a kind of "bay" with the upper arms. Also, the junction of lower and upper arms is relatively narrow (reduced to zero in two-dimensional iconography), which suggests that some extra structural support should be provided, which would secure the slender mid-arm junctions. This was done, I believe, by inserting the snake-like construction, an element which would act as an "elbow" of the upper arm, resting on the lower arm, in the way that we support our bodies on our elbows when in a reclining position ... the snake-like structure ... is ingeniously designed so as to fill in beautifully the "bay" -like space under the upper arms, but also to direct the forces exerted onto the yoke through the little post at the top ("column") and the horse-shoe/ snake element and the "buttress" to the inner side of the lower arm.". 64 Ps.
