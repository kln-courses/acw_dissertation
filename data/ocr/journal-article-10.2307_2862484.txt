City councils first planned a major rebuilding on 31 March 1294; by September, 1294, work had been begun (Guasti, 1887, docs. I, 6: I-4). On 6 December 1296, the republic formally deliberated to rebuild the cathedral "ad reverentiam et decus omnipotentis Dei et beate virginis Marie matris eius et beate Reparate virginis et ad honorem et decorem Florentine civitatis optatum."

This habit continued, in official state- ments as well as in vernacular conversation, for more than a century of reconstruction and new sculptural decoration, through the year 1411.3 In March 1412, the Florentine government councils of the Popolo and Commune suddenly voted that the dedication of the ca- thedral to the Virgin Mary be actively recognized: the annual feast was to be Annunciation day (25 March-the date also marking the Florentine new year), and the church known in the vernacular as S. Maria del Fiore.4 A month later, 29 April 1412, the priors of the Signoria and their advisory colleges legislated that this be done: their decree states that the cathedral be called S. Maria del Fiore "in perpetuum" and not by any other name, and that the solemn feast of the Annunciation be observed as the principal holy day of the ca- thedral by the Florentine people, the major councils, the Parte Guelfa, the Mercanzia, the guild consuls, the Arte della Lana, and all local clergy-excepting the Servites of SS. Annunziata, who were obliged to celebrate the day at their own church. The operai of the duomo, it was stressed, were to be called "gli operai di Santa Maria del Fiore . . . tam in scriptis quam in verbis."6 In this same April decree, the priors declared that the operai of the cathedral were to have a marble statue of the Virgin Mary, "with a lily in her hands," placed in the front "et in summitate" of the church, presumably intending a location in the upper area of the west faCade.7 We may envision a frontal, iconic figure taking shape 3G.

The wording of the document does not reveal whether the operai were to have a new statue carved 675</page><page sequence="4">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY in the imagination of the priors: seated or standing, holding a stalk of lilies, the figure was intended to be set by itself at the top of the unfinished faCade. The idea of the statue in context would have followed the Tuscan medieval tradition, as in the statue of the Vir- gin and Child at Pisa cathedral or the figure of St. Michael at the Romanesque church of S. Michele in Lucca (fig. 2). Like the St. Michael in Lucca, the image of the Virgin was probably imagined as colossal and something of a composite: the marble statue would probably have been designed to hold before her a lily made of gilded metal.8 The statue was apparently never commissioned, made, or installed. It does not appear in Bernardino Poccetti's drawing of 1587 (fig. 3), nor is it reflected in contemporary documents con- served in the archive of the Opera del Duomo: indeed, the govern- ment decree ("dead letter," as far as the cathedral's sculpture is con- cerned) is our only surviving record of this conception-a figure that would have personified not only the physical and spiritual ca- thedral in its newly affirmed dedication to the Virgin Mary but the city of Florence itself, that is, a personification of the "fiore" (flower) for which the cathedral was named. The decree expressed a collective, official desire for the words "Santa Maria del Fiore" to be spoken and written regarding the ca- thedral of Florence, and to create a focal, monumental work of art which was to personify the commune in a sacred setting. The statue of"Santa Maria del Fiore" would be located in the most prominent position in the city, framed by the largely undecorated west facade of the cathedral, above the Marian sculptural cycle as it then existed, facing the "bel San Giovanni," i.e., the baptistry. The reggimento of 1412 had apparently conceptualized this figure as a principal landmark in the network of Florentine public art: through it and through the verbal dedication that it represented, the government or (less likely) have a pre-existing statue removed from its original location and placed at the top of the facade. By 1412 the second and third stories of the facade were partly encrusted with sculpture, much of it Marian; see Becherucci and Brunetti, I: 245-55, cat. 74-109. The four Evangelists flanking the central portal had been commissioned to Nanni di Banco (St. Luke), Donatello (St. John), Niccolo di Pietro Lamberti (St. Mark), and Bernardo Ciuffagni (St. Matthew), but none of these statues had been com- pleted or installed by 1412; ibid., I: 26-64, cat. I 17-120. For the complex plan of facade sculpture present or underway by 1412, see Poggi, I: XV-LXI, docs. 1-33I. 8Two images of Gothic sculpture which come to mind are the Madonna ofJeanne d'Evreux (Paris, Louvre), who holds the Christ Child and a fleur-de-lis; and the Ma- donna at the church of S.

This paper will discuss the symbolic consolidation of an inter- related cluster of ideas-namely, the identification of the flower or lily with Florence, by reflex the association of the Virgin Mary with Florence as her protector, and the resulting equation between the "Madonna del giglio" and the city of Florence herself-at a rather critical moment in Florentine history. I propose that the theme of Santa Maria del Fiore was taken up in spring I4I2 as a deliberate 678 ; .... .. ... .. ^· :.... ..... ..... :~-'·-- """t '·- I :,'</page><page sequence="7">MARIAN POLITICS IN QUATTROCENTO FLORENCE 679 assertion of the God-given privilege and responsibility of the guelf patriciate as it perceived itself in the Florentine post-Ciompi re- gime. Naming the cathedral "Santa Maria del Fiore" in honor of the state (called "Florentia" or "Fiorenza"), which had as its emblem the Florentine lily (gigliofiorentino), was a gesture of unusually bold civic self-reference. The conceived and subsequently vanished plan for a statue that would have manifested the idea of Santa Maria del Fiore actually consisted of a synthesis in monumental form of var- ious associable strands of thought (legends, names, images, and emblems) that had been in gestation throughout the history of the republican commune. Originally set forth in 1296, the theme was recapitulated with strength of purpose in the deliberations of 1412. Since "Santa Maria del Fiore" was an invented, ad hoc, specif- ically Florentine appellation for the Virgin Mary, a logical feastday was chosen according to religious symbolism of the Florentine sa- cred calendar. Annunciation Day, March 25, marked the first day of the Florentine year; the attribute most commonly associated with that day throughout Europe from the thirteenth century on, was the lilium candidum-a symbol signifying that Mary remained chaste at the Incarnation of her son. 0 The lily became the flower for the feast of Santa Maria "del Fiore", carrying as it did an im- mediate association with the Florentine fleur-de-lis, the giglio fiorentino. THE LILY OF FLORENCE Virtually all legends about the founding of Florence are linked with the sound of her name, "Florentia" or "Fiorenza." A common version is that there were many flowers, especially lilies, in the meadows on the banks of the Arno when the founding Romans ar- rived; another has it that Florence was founded by a soldier named Florinus, who led followers "ex flore hominum Romanorum." Some say the city founded between two rivers (the Arno and Mugnone) was called "Fluentia" for that reason, and because of the "flowering" of the city the name became "Florentia." Others claimed that Florence was so beautiful that she was immediately known as the "flower of all cities that had ever flourished." Yet an- 'See Koch, 114-17.</page><page sequence="8">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY other explanation was that the city was embellished as if she were built of flowers, "con molte delizie. "II The fleur-de-lis of the arms of the commune was visually syn- onymous with the city's name and was similarly associated with natural lilies in the legend of the emblem's first appearance. Chron- iclers explained that the founding Romans sent a plAin red banner to the new Florentines, who themselves came upon a beautiful white lily one morning and embellished their standard with it. Oth- ers suggest that the blossomed lily, as the most noble of all flowers, was adopted because Florence was the flower of all cities. 12 One leg- end credits the symbol to St. Reparata, a virgin martyr who was believed to have appeared on behalf of Florence in a battle against the Goths on her feastday, October 8, in the year 405, carrying a red banner with the device of a white lily: the battle was won and the lily became the city's device. Reparata (sometimes locally known as "Liperata") became Florence's protector saint and the name saint of her major church. I3 In this way, Reparata figures as a surprisingly integral iconographic prototype for S. Maria del Fiore. In her persona we find the qualities of virginity, lilies, and Florentine independence, already pertinent to the dedicatory pro- gram of the cathedral church. The white lily on a red field was the emblem of the commune by 1250, and in I251 guelfs of the primo popolo distinguished them- selves from the ghibellines by reversing their colors to a red lily on a white field: hence Dante's description of the lily "per division fatto vermiglio. "4 When guelf power was definitively restored in 1266 with the help of the Neapolitan house of Anjou, the Angevin fleur-de-lis was psychologically superimposed on the arms of the Parte Guelfa, and so the lily flourished as guelfism came to be re- garded as an established factor in the rhetorical destiny of Florence. The symbolic Florentine lion, the Marzocco, came to be a well- known civic symbol, and from the thirteenth century forward, the "Rubinstein discusses the anonymous mid-thirteenth-century Chronica de' origine civitatis; prevailing legends about the origins of Florence are also found in the following sources: Istoria fiorentina di Marchionne di Coppo Stefani, in Delizie, 7: 124; Leonardo Bruni's History of Florence in Watkins, 31; Dati, 112. Prose and poetry from the thir- teenth century forward imagined a city that "flowered," "flourished," "bore fruit," or could be, in the words of Chiaro Davanzati, "sfiorita"; see Davis, 47. "Marchione di Coppo Stefani in Delizie, 7: 24; Dati, 112, I34. '3Koch, 123-24; Davidsohn, I: 60-63. AS, Octobris 4: 24-41.

This sculptured image was replicated frequently, and placed in politically meaningful sites. I Just as the winged lion of St. Mark was easily understood as a visual stand-in for the dominion of Venice, the representation of the lily or the fleur-de-lis became a symbol for Florence. In addition to the constant presence of the sculptured or painted escutcheons of the commune (including the Marzocco), the "citta del fiore" was filled with different kinds of heraldic versions of the giglio fiorentino throughout the medieval and Renaissance periods. Guelf symbolism links Florentine church to state inextricably, for exam- ple, with the presence of the three-dimensional gilded fleur-de-lis in the staffof the local bishop saint, Zenobius, in an altarpiece from the cathedral attributed to Giovanni del Biondo, where Zenobius is flanked by the civic virtues of Humility and Charity. This theme is continued in a mosaic representation of Zenobius made for the cathedral in 1504 by the artist Monte di Giovanni, known as "il Fora," where Zenobius wears the red fleur-de-lis in a glassfermaglio (fig. 4). 6 The Florentine lily also had expressive iconographic po- tential on its own, as we see, for example, in Luca della Robbia's ceramic tondo made for the Mercanzia at Orsanmichele, which also served as the city's grain hall: here the petals of the blossomed lily are interpreted as pods bursting with seeds, and the flower is sprouting from a bundle of wool (fig. 5).17 A most ubiquitous and far-reaching presence of the giglio fiorentino was its image on the most potent symbol of Florentine prosperity: her coined money. From the mid-thirteenth century, St. John the Baptist was complemented on the reverse side of the gold florin by what Florentine merchants proudly described as the "giglio fiorentino che non e arme, ne segno, ne fu mai di nessuna altra gente" (fig. 6). i8 Florins in foreign commerce would thus au- tomatically refer to the name of the city that was their source-a 15See Weinstein, 1968, 22, and 1970, 36-38, 63.

The lily served as a protagonist in important ceremonial ritual, as is recorded by Goro Dati in his description of the traditional pro- cessional decoration for the most important Florentine feastday, that of St. John the Baptist. Dati tells us in rich detail about a double velvet and brocade palio lined with Russian squirrel fur ("vaio"), and bordered with ermine pelts and gold silk fringe; above this ap- paratus was placed a naturalistic lily made of gilded silver, which presumably stood free, like a trophy.20 A scene of St. John's day on a fifteenth-century cassone at the Bargello (fig. 7) shows the kind of decorative panels and banners carried in such processions, with 0Dati, I06. 684</page><page sequence="13">FIG. 7.

Such metaphorical address was typical of the poetry and prose surrounding the Florentine republic. Writ- ing in the 138os, Fazio degli Uberti implores a fellow exile, "Oh citizen of whose honor / you ought to defend more than life itself, I pray that you will take delight / from your duty to the lily's well- being / if only you cause her to reign in safety."23 This theme, which has been studied by Donald Weinstein in his essays concern- ing the "Myth of Florence," was conserved and its hyperbolic use continued according to the diplomatic circumstances of the occa- sion. Around the turn of the century, under the sway of Savona- rola's vision, Girolamo Benivieni declared: "You will see all the world come to you / devoted and faithful / folk, drawn by the odor of your holy lily."24 The symbol of the lily had a history of effective use in political persuasion. Anselmo di Gioacchino Calderoni sent verses to Filip- po Maria Visconti in behalf of the count of Urbino, exhorting the Milanese ruler to unite himself with Venice and Florence and to de- sist from the "rissa col giglio."25 When Pope Eugenius IV turned against the Florentines and left the city in March, 1443, the court herald of the Signoria, Antonio di Matteo di Meglio, accused the pope in verse: "Foll'e l'agnel pel pasco al lupo gire; foll'e dar fede a chi vive d'errore, foll'e chi brama il frutto e guasta il fiore, ch'e fa contrario l'effeto al desire."26 And the pope's vituperative re- sponse (in a paraphrase of Dante's "cursed flower") continued the 2IAttributed to Jacopo Franchi, Chastel, 13, fig. 3.

Ch'a mezzo il carro e fitto uno stile, Dove e il paglio gentile, E tutto steso si color vermiglio; E in su la cima, d'oro e posto un giglio" (published in full by Guasti, 1908, 9-I7, and I3 for this passage). 22Ser Domenico da Prato, "II tirannico sangue dei Visconti," in Flamini, 80. 23Fazio degli Uberti in Sarteschi, 6; quoted and trans. in Weinstein, 1970, 47. 24Girolamo Benivieni, quoted and trans. in Weinstein, 1970, 30-31. 2SFlamini, 2I3. 26Ibid., I24. 686</page><page sequence="15">MARIAN POLITICS IN QUATTROCENTO FLORENCE metaphor: "Falso e quel fior; che mai fa frutto aprire; falso e quel fiore ch'e bello sanza odore: Falso e chi vuol far pasto di pastore, e'l suo velen di mel fa ricoprire."27 QUESTA NOSTRA FIORENZA Just as the Florentine city-state was visualized as the lily in a kind of symbolic shorthand, it was also imagined-in a figuration that required a more discursive, reifying, anthropomorphic mood-as a woman. The abstract concept of the republican commune was rendered concrete in language by the frequent characterization of Florence as a lovely maiden, a goddess, or a queen. Brunetto Latini declared in the "Tesoretto" that Florence "Fioriva, e fece frutto: / si, ch'ell'era di tutto / La Donna di Toscana."28 Toward the end of the Trecento, the esteemed citizen Guido del Palagio spoke to his city as the lover to his lady, calling forth the same kind of floral im- ages as had characterized the secular love poetry of the dolce stil nuovo: O donna bella mia! O bel paese! O soli, o gigli, o perli, o fiordaliso! lo triemo tutto per la gelosia Di te Madonna mia, che tu non cresca sempre la tua insegna. Ma colui ti sovvegna Che tutto regge, e di te s'innamori Si che Fiorenza sempre si rinfiori.29 Fazio degli Uberti envisioned Florence, "flower of every good root," as a maiden daughter of the matron Rome, who would "make herself empress, as her mother had in past ages.

"32 This metaphor was apparently durable enough to provoke the ironic comment by Pope Pius II, in reference to the fifteenth-century Medici rule, that Flo- rence had no legitimate husband but only a paramour.33 Indeed, the female personification of Florence enjoyed a natural sanction under the Medicean regime, particularly thriving in the age ofLorenzo the Magnificent.

I94v-I98; quoted and discussed by Flamini, 214-15. (Cf. Weinstein, 1970, who attributes it to Anselmo di Gioacchini Calderoni, ca. 1442.) Apropos of "the fruit of her seed," see Luca della Robbia's relief tondo at Orsanmichele, where the lily (= Florence = lady) is full of seeds. Messer An- tonio di Matteo di Meglio, who was cavaliere (court herald) of the Signoria in the middle of the Quattrocento, calls upon his patria as a mother: "Madre mia cara, qual ch'io sia figliuolo," quoted by Flamini, 78. The theme of city as mother and beloved is con- tinued in elegiac tones in some of the more maudlin modern travel literature; see, for example, Louise de la Ramee (pseud.

Liturgical prose of the middle ages ex- tolled Mary as "holy virgin among women, like a lily among thorns," and in thirteenth-century devotional literature, the Virgin was praised as queen of Heaven with the following words: "O an- gelic lily, O celestial flower, O true flower of heaven!"37 The image of Mary as a celestial lily seems to have been strong in the local Flo- rentine tradition, where as early as the thirteenth century the Laudesi gathered at Orsanmichele sang: Donna per qual amore che m'ha avut'el tuo figlio dever' aver en core de dar'mel tuo consiglio Succurrime, aulente giglio Veni e non tardare.38 34The medal is inscribed: TUTELA PATRIE FLORENTIA; Hill, 2: no. 926.

Painted images must also have played a part in propagating the idea of a specifically Florentine Madonna. In an illuminated page from the Biadaiuolo of Domenico Lenzi, the original miraculous image at Orsanmichele (around which the Laudesi gathered) is imagined as a Madonna holding a flower. Similarly, Bernardo Dad- di's large polyptych altarpiece from S. Pancrazio, with its abun- dance of lilies and roses in the central panel and all the protector saints of Florence (including S. Reparata) assembled in the side pan- I, 212, c. 32v) clearly associates the Madonna with the red and white arms of the city: "Croce tegnon bianch'e vermiglia / per esser di vostra famiglia / La biancha a voi si rassomiglia / L'altro allo tuo figlio, virgo pia .. ."

"40 The invention of the name of "Santa Maria del Fiore" for the cathedral of Florence in the age of Dante and Arnolfo di Cambio would clearly have facilitated the osmosis of verbal association between the Virgin Mary and the ab- stract conception of the city-state in the imaginations of Floren- tines. Although it is not clear whether the composition of the Divine Comedy preceded or followed the renaming of S. Reparata, the ca- thedral's new dedication no doubt spawned further associations of the kind.41 In the later fifteenth century, not only was Christ figured as king of Florence, but the Virgin Mary was extolled as her queen. In 1495, with the priors of the Signoria more or less favorably disposed to- ward Savonarola, a procession of thousands of children carried a crucifix and a stendardo of the Madonna, collecting money and jew- els to be deposited at the cathedral for the poor. Triumphant songs of the time not only called upon the Virgin as their guide and queen but actually have Mary address the city using language usually in- voked in prayers to herself, calling Florence "blessed among others on earth," "like a sun among the stars," and "chosen by God": Viva ne' nostri cor, viva o Fiorenza, vivo Cristo il tuo re, viva la Sposa Sua figlia e madre, e la tua guida e regina... Non sai che quando a tanta grazia eletta fosti, in Ciel dalla tua alma e diva Regina dette fur queste parole: 39See the codex "Biadaiuolo" Laurenziana, Tempi 3, fol. 79. For the S. Pancrazio Altarpiece, Offner, Section III, 8: 23-3 I. Offner notes that since the predella was filled with scenes from the life of St. Reparata, that the altarpiece may originally have been made for the cathedral. A study currently in preparation by Paula Spilner will propose that the polyptych originally decorated the high altar of the cathedral. 40Dante, Paradiso, XVI, 148; XXIII, 88; see above, nn. 14, i8. 41It is tantalizing that the naming of "Santa Maria del Fiore" (8 September 1296) coincides with the period of Dante's first active participation in the Reggimento: he served on the prestigious Consiglio dei Cento from the end of May through the end of September, 1296; see Chiminez, 2: 385-451, esp. 2: 398. 69I</page><page sequence="20">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY . : E i.i I : · !~~~~~~~~~. · ,...,...l.:~..

Io).43 Marian allusions are so wholly integrated in this image that at first glance the figure would appear to be a Virgin Annunciate rising from a throne, which is duly ap- pointed with a cloth of honor and a large lily as its finial. The fig- ure's crossed arms conform to the maidenly gesture of humility which visual custom so frequently had Mary assume in her dialogue with Gabriel.44 Significantly, the verse embedded in the central lobe of the fleur-de-lis addresses Florence as a flower: "Flos florum flore Florencia cres[ci]at honore Requi[ri]t virtutis." Such an image is comparable in its intention of simultaneous meanings to representations of Venetiafigurata, such as Filippo Ca- lendario's "Venezia-Maria-Giustizia" relief on the facade of the Ducal Palace, or Jacobello del Fiore's painting of Venice as Justice with the archangels Michael and Gabriel, in which Gabriel enters the picture space as if in an Annunciation scene (fig. I I). As has been shown in a recent study by David Rosand, Venice throughout the centuries habitually metamorphosizes herself into a personification ofJustice with strong allusions to the crowned or Annunciate Vir- gin Mary and to Mary as Ecclesia.45 It appears that the visual idea of "Santa Maria del Fiore" even- tually replaced the image of Santa Reparata in the realm of the ca- thedral itself, but only after a gradual eclipse, whereby the virgin saint became more closely associated with lilies.

I2).47 Indeed, from all that I can gather, the cult of St. Reparata seems to have waned after the rededication of the cathedral to the Virgin Mary in I296.48 Around the middle of the fourteenth century, Mat- teo Villani lamented bitterly at the deceptive trick "ricevuto per la femminile astuzia" of the abbess of Teano, where the body of St. Reparata was entombed. The abbess had given the city of Florence an arm of the saint for the cathedral in 1352, but in 1356 it was dis- covered by a goldsmith who was preparing its expensive reliquary to have been nothing but "un simulacro di legno o di gesso."49 If the efficacy of relics was, as Richard Trexler maintains, determined by their "patronage," namely their setting and ritual use, then this Boccacciesque episode may actually reflect a symptom of the saint's decline in popularity rather than a proper cause.50 46See Offner, 1924. 47Becherucci and Brunetti, 2: 282, cat. 40. 48A statue discovered in the Boboli Gardens, believed by some to be a figure of St. Reparata from the Arnolfian sculptural program, is problematic as to the artist, date, and subject; Becherucci and Brunetti, I: 217-18, cat. 8. The statue's attribute is a burn- ing lamp, appropriate to St. Reparata (AS, 4: 24-41), but more frequently symbolic of the civic virtue Charity.

The cult of the Florentine bishop saint Zenobius, on the other hand, grew in Florence after the discovery of his bones in the cathedral in 1331, an event that was celebrated by ten consecutive days and nights of bell-ringing and rejoicing; Guasti, 1887, 43. Zenobius' sepulchral chapel was singled out for special attention in the early Quattrocento; see below, n. 53. For further discussion of the protection of Florence by St. Reparata and the Virgin Mary, see Trexler, 1981, 4, 66-67, 72, 197. In June 1281 (well in advance of the rededication of the cathedral to the Virgin), a "Compagnia di Sa. Maria di Sa. Reparata" was founded at the cathedral; this group would process to the sanctuary of the cathedral with lighted candles on every feastday of the Virgin, as well as the feasts of St. Reparata, St. John Baptist, St. Philip, and St. Zenobius; Davidsohn, 1908, 4: 432-34.

PATRONAGE OF THE COMMUNE Given the iconographic background sketched above, there seems no doubt that when the priors of the Signoria decreed that a marble statue of the Virgin "cum flore lilii in manibus" be made for the ca- thedral they intended a figuration of "Santa Maria del Fiore," an</page><page sequence="26">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY iconographic equivalent of Florentia, to stand out as a visual sum- mation, set off against the early program of Marian sculpture al- ready present on the west facade. In the linguistic and pictorial ico- nography of S. Maria del Fiore, a synthesis of civic emblems and personifications was immersed so profoundly in the context of tra- ditional, non-local Christian iconography that not only was the city of Florence subsumed under the direct protection of the Virgin Mary as intercessor for the city-state, but the commune as Florentia came to be actually equated with the queen of Heaven. The priors' deliberation of April, 1412, set forth a strong desire for an assertion of the divine nature of the Florentine commune: they actually de- creed the legal enforcement of a complex iconographic theme, a theme whose impact as a whole was many times stronger than the sum of its parts. The symbolic content of the gesture itself is hardly surprising in the age of the Italian city-state-the republics of Siena and Venice had, after all, long claimed the Virgin as their special protectorsI-- but what remains intriguing is the direct nature of the intervention of the priors in the sculptural decoration of the cathedral. Although the Opera del Duomo, which operated under the official trust of the Albizzi-dominated wool guild, was in essence an agency of the communal government, there are few known instances of such overt participation in planning the figurative decoration of the ca- thedral by the Signoria. 2 An earlier, somewhat analogous, episode was the involvement of the priors in the building and decoration of the chapel dedicated to St. Zenobius, whose bones had been found under an altar in the crypt of the cathedral in 133 I. In Feb- ruary, I408-9, the priors, led by the Standard-Bearer of Justice, Bartolommeo di Niccolb di Taldo Valori, instructed the operai of the duomo to choose an appropriate location, as the cathedral neared completion, for the chapel of St. Zenobius, and to have it decorated with sculpture within five years. Almost twenty years later, 15 June 1428, a committee of lanaiuoli and operai, having con- 5iFor the Virgin as intercessor in Venice, see Rosand.

I3). On 2 July 1416, the Signoria, headed by Gherardo di Buo- ninsegna de' Machiavelli, deemed that the figure, which had orig- inally been intended for one of the tribune buttresses, be taken out of storage and sent to the Palazzo della Signoria. 54 Almost immediately-that is, within the two-month term of office of the priors - the David was refinished by the artist and transported to the civic seat where it was installed on marble brackets, embellished with gold and silver leaf and mosaic tesserae, and set against a wall covered with silver lilies of the commune on a blue ground.55 Apropos of this installation in a distinctly civic space, a later source tells that the statue's base was at some point inscribed PRO PA- TRIA FORTITER DIMICANTIBUS ETIAM ADVERSUS TERRIBILISSIMOS HOSTES DII PRAESTANT AUXIL- IUM. 56 Thus the priors of the Florentine government had selected a pre-existing statue of David to be remodelled as a personification 53For the documentary history of the chapel of St. Zenobius, Poggi, ed.

The draping of various rooms, objects, and even outdoor areas with huge blue curtains painted or embroidered with gold fleur-de-lis had a venerable history in Florence. In 1367, the captains of Orsanmichele ordered a huge blue curtain scattered with yellow lilies for outdoor use (ASF, Orsanmichele, Co- dex 56, 1367 June 22, c. 50; citation kindly provided to me by Brendan Cassidy). An anonymous poem of 1407, "La festa di Santo Giovanni Batista," declares that: "L'ono- rabil cappella del Battista / Si chopre intorno a ciascun de' lati / con gigli lavorati /pell' alta tenda che la piazza chiude / a ciascun tenda in corta vista / son del Comune e Popol disegnate / nel mezzo compassate / L'Aquila rossa e' gigli in belle scude" (Guasti, I908, Io). Gregorio Dati records that on the eve of St. John's day, "Tutta la gran piazza di S. Giovanni e parte della Via e coperta di tende azzurre con gigli gialli" (Dati, quoted by Gori, I: I33). The organs of Santa Maria del Fiore were periodically painted with heraldic lilies or draped with blue curtains embellished with gold lilies; see Poggi, ed.

What was it that prompted the government so ardently to revive the theme of"Santa Maria del Fiore"--a theme that located the idea of the divine nature of the state in the sacred precinct of the cathedral -at that particular time after having let it languish for al- most a century and a half? The motivations behind the decree may be understood through examining the political situation of the reggimento as it stood at that time.59 The Albizzi-doininated government faced a regular series of crises, and in the year or so before Giovanni degli Aldobrandini, a key figure in Florentine government, became Standard-Bearer of Justice in March, 1411-12, the republic had been severely bruised by plague, famine, unemployment, and revolution. Gene Brucker has shown that these internal ordeals, along with the seemingly in- terminable war with Genoa, had demoralized the general popula- tion and challenged their faith in the entire office-holding stratum of the Albizzi regime; the self-confidence of this ruling elite of pa- trician guelf citizens was shaken.60 Plague, famine, and economic unbalance in the summer of 141 I caused many Florentines to leave 57Priors of the Signoria for the two-month term of July-August 1416 were: Luca di Piero Fantoni, Antonio di Firenze del Pancia, Giovanni di Francesco Pepi, Luigi di Giovanni Mannini, Mariotto di Piero di Cenni dell'Amorotta, Salvestro di Tommaso Popoleschi, Giovanni di Luigi Viviani, Tommaso d'Andrea di Neri di Lippo, and Standard-Bearer of Justice Gherardo di Buoninsegna de' Machiavelli, who had also been a prior during the term of the spring, 1412, decree (see below, nn. 60, 72); priorate recorded in the chronicle of Giovanni Morelli, in Delizie, 19: 37. 58Janson, 6; Hartt, 124-25. 59The Consulte epratiche contain no evidence of discussion about the cathedral in the month prior to the deliberation: ASF, Consulte epratiche (hereafter CP) 41, cc. 76v-8iv (the month of March 1411-12); sources therefore remain silent as to the identity of the individual citizens who called forth the theme of Santa Maria del Fiore and their ra- tionale for doing so. 60Brucker, 1977, 319-25, 340, 340 n.

As unemployment, food shortage, and the high price of grain were blamed on the government, rebellion fomented among the Florentine poor. The exiled Bindaccio degli Alberti hatched a plot after the fashion of the Ciompi for a small group of rebels to chant slogans in the streets, carrying a flag with the cross of the Popolo, and to attack the priors in their council chambers at the Palazzo della Signoria. 6 After Bindaccio's subsequent betrayal and execution, plans for a second revolution ignited in November, 1411, as if spontaneously from the hunger suffered by the popolo minuto. This band of revolutionaries intended to sack the communal granary, kill Gino Capponi and despoil his house in the neighbor- hood of S. Jacopo Oltrarno, and wind up at the Palazzo della Si- gnoria, where they would depose the priors under threat of death and burn the electoral pouches, thereby putting an end to the re- gime.62 After the conspiracy was betrayed by a participant, the re- sponse of men such as Maso degli Albizzi and Rinaldo Gianfigliazzi, whose oligarchic rule had enjoyed at least a decade of relatively un- disturbed authority, was to strive to maintain unity, harmony, and a status quo in the composition of the governing body. Statesmen who advocated a broad-based government (such as Lorenzo Ridolfi and Niccolo da Uzzano) favored a purge from within the councils and legislated opening up the government through more liberal el- igibility for the holding of minor offices. But aristocratic political conservatives, such as Antonio Alessandri, argued (May, 1412) against any change toward egalitarianism, calling those who would enter government under relaxed requirements "ignorantes et Ciompi. "63 Even as the insecure regime sought to galvanize itself in the spring of 1412, a third major conspiracy was taking shape under the direction of the Alberti family in Bologna. 64 ByJune 1412, the third plot would be quashed, the plague ended, and enough grain har- vested to obliterate hunger;65 but in March-April, 141 I-I2, the reg- 6'Ibid., 326-27. 62Ibid., 327-28.

The oligarchic regime of 1382-1433 was characterized by delib- erate continuity of the old patrician order in government, a ten- dency accompanied by devotion to what Weinstein defines as Flo- rence's mystical destiny to religious and political supremacy.66 Explicit in this system was a belief in the sanctity of the Signoria- sacred in its role as an abstract office as well as an actual group of ruling individuals.67 The idea had venerable roots in Florence, and earlier in the fourteenth century Antonio Pucci's advice to "uno de' priori suo amico" admonishes: "Loda e ringrazia Iddio principal- mente / Difendi il ben comune e'l tuo potere. "68 Great loyalty to the governing patriciate was expressed early in the fifteenth century by Giovanni Morelli, who claimed to have "never thought or de- sired anything more than the honor and exaltation of their re- gime."69 It was long believed that any contempt for the officers of the Signoria would bring about a decline in the spiritual, moral, and physical well-being of the entire populace, instigating division and factionalism. The priors elected in March, 1412, included the following nine men: Antonio diJacopo de' Canigiani; Gherardo di Boninsegna de' Machiavelli; Matteo d'Antonio Martini; Lodovico di Piero di Buonaventura Ricoveri; Iacopo di Monte di Pugio; Simone di Bar- tolo Cambini; Antonio d'Agnolo dal Canto; Ugo d'Andrea di Messer Ugo della Stufa; and Standard-Bearer of Justice Giovanni di Giovanni degli Aldobrandini.70 Several members of the priorate, from illustrious old families with known government profiles, such as Antonio de' Canigiani, Gherardo de' Machiavelli, Matteo Mar- tini, and primus inter pares Giovanni degli Aldobrandini, may well, at this time of debilitation of the regime, have desired that an ardent statement regarding the sacrosanct nature of the Signoria be infused 66See Partner, 1968, 383; Brucker, 1977, 252-55; Weinstein, 1968, 15-44, esp. 20- 2I; idem, I970, 134 and passim. 67Trexler, 1973, 132-33, contends that the Signoria was "exalted ... as a holy ob- ject."

The virtues of good government, of the sacred duty of the guelf oligar- chy, of unity and harmony of purpose under the status quo, needed public affirmation against revolution, discontent, and that age-old dreaded enemy of the Florentine republic, factionalism.72 Such ex- pression might find satisfactory form not least in the legislated rep- etition of the words "Santa Maria del Fiore," in quotidian conver- sation as well as official statements ("sit in vulgari sermone . . . et sic publice omni tempore"), and by the physical personification of S. Maria del Fiore as a monumental apex of the sculptural program of the cathedral. Emblem for emblem, in the iconography of the republic the name "fiore" and the lily held by the projected statue of Mary would have championed the lily of the commune and the Parte Guelfa as opposed to the cross of the Popolo. In fact, it is probably no coincidence that the decree of 1412 was more or less contemporary with the opposite-minded activity of "certain tai- lors" in Bologna, who, in the name of the third Alberti conspiracy, were seen sewing a great banner with the cross of the Popolo in preparation for spring revolution.73 IL LOR' BEL FIORE In the years between 1296 and 1412, the feast of the cathedral had changed from October 8 (S. Reparata) to September 8 (Nativity of the Virgin) to Annunciation Day (March 25). During the five years from 1412 until 1416-I 7 the feastday of the Annunciation was pre- sumably celebrated at the cathedral "cum omnibus tam in tempo- ralibus quam in spiritualibus," as required by the priors in 1412. On I9 February 1416-17, however, the Servite friars of the church of SS. Annunziata petitioned the Florentine government to keep 25 March as their own feastday-and theirs alone-and to transfer S. Maria del Fiore's celebration to elsewhere in the calendar. The 71Giovanni di Giovanni degli Aldobrandini served as Standard-Bearer ofJustice five times between 1395 and 1414, an indication of his prominence in the reggimento; Brucker, 1977, 265, 268. Similarly, the Canigiani, Machiavelli, Martini, and Ricoveri were high-profile families, active in the post-Ciompi regime; ibid., 271, 385, n. 327. 72For the threat of factionalism from the time of Dante through the early Quattro- cento, see Kent, 11-12. 73Brucker, 1977, 337, quoting the testimony ofCionetto Bastari, who betrayed the plot to the authorities. 704</page><page sequence="33">MARIAN POLITICS IN QUATTROCENTO FLORENCE priors granted the request, assigning the Cathedral the Purification of the Virgin, "ea die qua et suam virginitatem in templo represen- tavit," as their official feast, with the cycle of annual celebration to begin on 2 February I4I7-I8.74 Still, throughout these calendar changes, the cathedral remained unchanged in its unique dedication to "Santa Maria del Fiore." A causal relationship may exist between political events in the year 1411-1412 and the iconographic urgency implicit in the April 1412 decree. Such a particularized context of meaning was sur- rounded, however (as if in concentric circles), by the more com- prehensive contexts of local, and then cosmic sacrality. The spir- itual relationship of Florentines to the Christian God carried its own "inner directed" logic in transforming a lesser (St. Reparata) to a greater (Virgin Mary) protector for the city. Thus the "fiore" of S. Maria had a continuing history of its own in the sculptural pro- gram of the duomo. Nanni di Banco's Assumption of the Virgin in the gable of the Porta della Mandorla was commissioned in 1414 and installed soon after the artist's death, in 1421 (fig. I4).75 Nanni's Madonna once handed a silk cintola embellished with gold threads down to St. Thomas; and documents state that a lily, apparently made of painted, polished, or gilded metal (not unlike the triumphal lily de- scribed by Goro Dati) had also been placed in the Virgin's left hand.76 This lily, incorporated into Nanni di Banco's relief of the 7414I6 February I9, ASF, Deliberationi de' signori e collegi, 1416, c. 129, published by Guasti, 1887, 316-18, no. 476. 75For the documentary history of Nanni di Banco's gable relief, see Poggi, ed. Haines, I: 69-72, docs. 375-88, 390, 392. 76For the "cintola di seta," see Poggi, I: 72, doc. 392. On io February 1422, soon after the final installation of Nanni's relief, a payment was made to the sculptor Antonio de' Servi "per ischiarare il giglio tiene Nostra Donna dela porta della Nunziata" (ibid., I: 71, doc. 389). There has been some debate about where this lily was actually located. Brunetti thought the scribe was alluding to a statue of Gabriel, which may have been placed in the lunette of the northeast door in 1409; she assumes that the statues of Ga- briel and Mary in question were the enigmatic Annunciation group in the Museo del- l'Opera del Duomo (Becherucci and Brunetti, I: 255-58, cat. iio-iII) and that the scribe mistook the statue of Gabriel for "nostra Donna" since the angel has a more fem- inine countenance than that of the Virgin (ibid., I: 255-56). I see no reason to believe that this particular pair of statues was ever placed in the lunette of the Porta della Man- dorla and agree with Pope-Hennessy (1980, 17) that the lily was placed in the hand of Nanni di Banco's ascendant Virgin, who was referred to as "Nostra Donna dela porta della Nunziata" (as in Poggi, ed. Haines doc. 385, and passim). The practice of placing metal or gilded objects in the hands of statues was common in Italian art (e. g., Goldner, fig. 57); see above, n. 8. 705</page><page sequence="34">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY i . .:t A FIG.

Assumption of the Virgin, served a double iconographic purpose: it not only symbolized the purity of the Virgin-the incorruptibil- ity of her body as well as her soul, which was appropriate to her 706 A II t.; ' 1!</page><page sequence="35">MARIAN POLITICS IN QUATTROCENTO FLORENCE 707 assumption into heaven-but it identified this particular Virgin as "Santa Maria del Fiore," queen of Heaven and, as it were, queen of Florence. 77 The gilded lily inserted into Nanni's composition was probably intended to substitute-or at least to satisfy an icon- ographic need for-the seemingly defunct project for a statue of Mary "in summitate ... cum flore lilii in manibus" which had been decreed in spring, I4i2.78 Nanni's Madonna served pro ter (and we do not know for how long) as the "Madonna of the Lily" in the outdoor sculpture of the cathedral. The idea of civic self- representation in Nanni di Banco's Virgin of the Porta della Man- dorla as "Santa Maria del Fiore" would have been reinforced by the subject and the composition, derived as it was from Orcagna's As- sumption of the Virgin on the tabernacle at Orsanmichele (fig. 15). Orcagna's work was itself strategically ornamented with commu- nal lilies; and the Madonna of Orsanmichele had been long consid- ered as a special intercessor for the city.79 The idea of Santa Maria del Fiore as assumed into heaven, and crowned as its queen, was continued in the sculptural program in- side the cathedral. The musical angels of Nanni di Banco's Porta della Mandorla Assumption reappear, considerably paganized in 77For the Assumption of the Virgin in Italian art, see Goffen, 91-IO6 and passim. Goffen points out that in Domenico Ghirlandaio's Dormition and Assumption of the Vir- gin in S. Maria Novella, Mary's tomb is inscribed "Ave Maria Gratia," thus linking the Virgin's Dormition and Assumption with the Annunciation (ibid., Ioo-oI). Lilies play a codified part in Assumption scenes, where they typically issue in abundance from the Virgin's sarcophagus; and especially when the Assumption was later brought into connection with the Immaculate Conception of Mary; see Goffen, passim. But lilies were an attribute of Mary's Assumption in earlier images as well, presumably prompted by texts of the Church Fathers and the Song of Songs; see Levi d'Ancona, 212. According to the Golden Legend ofJacopus da Voragine, the Virgin was sur- rounded by red roses and white lilies when she was assumed into heaven; see PL, 177: col. 1219. As early as the seventh century, sermons on the Assumption quoted Can- ticles 7: 2, "et venter tuus acervus tritici, vallatus lilii"; and Isaiah II: I, "radice flos ascendit Christus," "virgo sancta inter filias, ac sit lilii inter spinas," quoted from St. Hildefonsus, Bishop of Toledo, in PL, 96: cols. 240, 246, 412. 78For the installation of the Assurmption relief, Poggi, ed. Haines, I: 71-72, docs. 386-388, 390-391. 79The pinnacle figure of St. Michael on Orcagna's tabernacle has his halo orna- mented with the communal lily; a figure of Fortitude from the frieze holds a shield with the lily (Cassidy, I76, fig. I76b). As early as 1365, the "Madonna of Orsanmichele" was proclaimed advocate of the city (ibid., 179). Cassidy discusses the civic iconog- raphy of Orcagna's tabernacle at Orsanmichele and the special charge carried by the Madonna Assunta in Florence, where the Assumption (rather than the Coronation) of the Virgin was frequently envisioned as the culmination of her life.</page><page sequence="36">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY FIG.

Ac- cording to Kauffmann, the putti and angels specifically praise the assumed and crowned Santa Maria del Fiore to whom the cathedral is dedicated. This is evident in the concentration of floral imagery- lilies, roses, and garlands -in the Cantoria reliefs: the angels gather flowers, pass wreaths to one another, and dance on carpets of blos- soms (figs. I6, I7).81 Here, as in some of the civic poetry discussed above, sacred imagery mirrors the profane Tuscan medieval use of flowers as trophies, garlands, and crowns of love that were custom- arily given to ladies in nuptial dances and games.82 Although the naming of the cathedral was effectively changed to "Santa Maria del Fiore" in prosaic and poetic use throughout Flo- rence by the government decree of 1412, the specifically Florentine image of the Virgin holding a lily failed to become a compelling civic symbol in the visual arts. The idea of the "Madonna del fiore" would never attain the visual currency, for example, enjoyed by that other being traditionally conjoined with the Florentine lily, the frequently replicated image that may be considered her secular counterpart: the Marzocco. Indeed, no monumental image of the personification of Santa Maria del Fiore such as the one that was de- sired in the moment of crisis in spring, I412, exists in the sphere of the cathedral. And the association of the "Madonna del giglio" with the duomo found less iconic (more indirect) expression in im- ages such as the ascendant Virgin ofNanni di Banco and implicitly in the Cantorias. According to the documentation of 1412, a hier- atic image of the personified Santa Maria del Fiore was to have fig- ured as a central, focal element of civic and religious symbolism: it would have stood quite literally as the summation of the sculp- tural cycle of the cathedral, high above the west facade.

A single clear answer may not exist, but I would contend that Brunelleschi's cupola, the grandest symbol of an Italian city-state even today, and a fitting crown for a cathedral dedicated to the Vir- gin, appears to have ultimately replaced and overshadowed the need for a figurative image of Santa Maria del Fiore (fig. 8).

To put it in simplified and compressed terms, the medieval aesthetic was giving way to 712</page><page sequence="41">MARIAN POLITICS IN QUATTROCENTO FLORENCE a consuming focus on Renaissance architectural innovation. Whereas a colossal sculptured personification made to be placed "front and center" would be well suited to the medieval, faqade- dominated churches of Lucca or Pisa-and this is apparently what the priors envisioned in I412-technology now rendered the idea out of style. With Brunelleschi's dome, the structure itself perforce became the city's most present, visible object of civic pride. The iconography of Brunelleschi's dome in context has been explored by Eugenio Battisti, who states that the cupola was seen to have embraced the "celestial city" and even paradise itself--concepts with distinctly civic overtones. Battisti maintains as well, however, that the predominant symbolism of the dome is Marian, and just as the cathedral was dedicated to Mary, the cupola is an equivalent for her crown.83 In a culture that maintained a long-standing tradition of identi- fication between Ecclesia and Maria, frequently envisioning an em- bodiment of the Virgin Mary in the physical construction of a church, it takes no great leap of imagination to perceive of Brunel- leschi's dome as the "fiore di Santa Maria del Fiore," a suitable crown for the queen of Heaven. Long before its completion, the dome was effectively envisioned as a crown for Santa Maria del Fiore and a symbol of the city-state. This attitude is clearly illus- trated by an episode of 1419: inJuly of that year, Brunelleschi made a wooden model of the lantern, which is now lost to us. He had it gilded and embellished with a small banner bearing a highly charged civic emblem, namely, the lily of the commune. The Flo- rentine fleur-de-lis thus "claimed" the cupola of the cathedral for the republican state itself, confirming what modern historians refer to as the "secularization" of sacred space. Indeed, this little ensem- ble worked as if it were a rebus, spelling out the name "Santa Maria del Fiore."84 When Giovanni di Cino Calzaiuolo recorded the oc- casion of the consecration of 1436 in terza rima, he referred to the cathedral as "il lor bel fiore, Santa Maria, ch'e fior la titolaro," call- ing the physical structure directly the "flower of Florence," and "Maria.

Maria Novella toward what one contemporary described as "La chupola volto sanza armadura / del tempio bel santa Maria del fiore / che quanto un grand alpe ell'e d'altura." Inside the cathedral, the natural liturgical focus of Euge- nius' benediction was the domed choir.86 Brunelleschi's dome served at once to frame and describe ritual space, as well as being the object of the benediction enacted within its limits. Although the Cantorias of Donatello and Luca della Robbia were not installed in time for the consecration ceremony, the interior of the cathedral was lavishly decorated with flowers, and painted im- provisations filled spaces where masons or sculptors had not been able to finish their work. 87 Music played a significant part in the cer- emonies: in honor of the consecration, Guillaume Dufay was com- missioned to write the famous Nuper Rosarum Flores, a four-part motet intended to represent the music of heavenly spheres. The Nu- per Rosarum Flores calls freely upon floral images of the Madonna, as did other compositions sung that day, such as the Ave Mater set to music byJohannes de Limburgia, which invokes Mary as "Flos virginitatis .. .lilium et rosa sine spina." In the musical tradition of the Netherlandish Gothic, Dufay's music was perceived as a highly representational "liturgical decoration," created to imitate the singing of angels.88 Listeners on Annunciation Day, 1436, were meant to experience a glimpse of Paradise through this earthly ren- dition of the eternal music of heaven. The Florentine humanist Gianozzo Manetti-present at the benediction of Santa Maria del Fiore, as were all prominent citizens -praised the variety of voices and instruments which could be heard throughout the cathedral and remarked that the angelic music of the beyond had come to earth for the moment.89 Architecture, music, and figurative art, if not fused into a syn- thetic whole, were complementary in producing an ambience of the 86Anonymous poem of 1459, "Fucci il maestro degli architettorj," quoted and trans. in Hyman, 29; original text published by Fabriczy, 80. 87Braunfels, 7-8; Manetti, 313-14. 88Dammann, for full texts of Nuper Rosarum Flores and Ave Mater, 74-75.

Insofar as the "dome of Heaven" had a powerful tradition in ecclesiastical architecture, the spectator would have experienced a symbolic Florentine "Paradise," specif- ically associated with the Assumption and Coronation of Santa Maria del Fiore.90 At the consecration of the duomo in 1436, it was surely the architecture itself- the interior and exterior vision of Brunelleschi's cupola- that contributed to a conceptualization of S. Maria del Fiore in a grand and abstract, active rather than passive, way. The numinous power of architecture had a profound tradition in the history of the Gothic cathedral, beginning, if we like, with the architecture of the Abbott Suger at S. Denis, and its expression of the deity through light: in quattrocento Florence, at the Humanist end of the spectrum, Brunelleschi's dome has been envisioned as a paradigm of the celestial spheres.9s With the suggestive embellish- ment of paradisiacal sounds, the floral and ephemeral, heraldic dec- oration of the inside and outside of the cathedral, and the sacred (guelfic) presence of the pope and the Signoria, the nave, tribunes, choir, and especially the phenomenal dome of the cathedral struc- ture would have evoked a vision of the cathedral as the Virgin Mary and simultaneously suggested the city of Florence as paradise and the domain of the assumed Virgin-such concepts had been deemed clearly interchangeable by her dedicatory name. The holiness of the city was thus sharply underscored by the benediction ceremony, where the presence of the Signoria con- firmed the idea of the divinely inspired state. The dignity of the commune was brought into close ceremonial association with the heavenly, ecclesiastical aspect of the newly finished cathedral dome; the priors of the Signoria were present as a group, alongside the pope and his entourage, corresponding as if a Florentine (secular) counterpart to the papal court.92 The civic message of this ceremo- nial configuration under the dome takes its place in the context of long-standing Florentine tradition. It is appropriate to turn once again to the anonymous writer who addressed an early priorate of 9°See Wittkower, 24-29; Lehmann, 1-27; de Tolnay, 83-104; further bibliography in Battisti, 1981, 359, n. 8. Warren proposed that Dufay's motet was a "deliberate at- tempt to create a sounding model of Brunelleschi's architecture," as though the music sought to mirror the celestial structure and proportion of architecture. 9IVon Simson, 91-141. 92Manetti, 315, 317. 715</page><page sequence="44">RENAISSANCE QUARTERLY the post-Ciompi regime. The author of the Canzone morale com- pares the council of the Dodici Buonuomini with the twelve Apos- tles, declares that the sixteen Gonfalonieri di Compagnia corre- spond to the numbers of hands and feet of the four Evangelists, and even sees the eight priors of the Signoria gathered around the Standard-Bearer of Justice as a terrestrial counterpart to that of the eternal chorus of angels who surround God the Father in heaven.93 At the benediction ceremony, old ideas were enacted once more- but they were reshaped by a new architectural setting. We may conclude, then, that the idea of"Santa Maria del Fiore" as a figuration of the state of Florence was characterized by both change and continuity. On the part of the priors of the spring I412 regime, the sudden need for a monumental, central, iconic image of the Virgin with a lily in her hands may have in some way an- swered political events such as the war with Genoa and civil insur- rection, and those causes issued by God, such as local plague and famine. The cathedral itself as a forum for the expression of the di- vinely ordered state, and the "secularization" of the cathedral by naming it after the state as well as the Virgin Mary ("Santa Maria del Fiore"), belonged to an older and uninterrupted local tradition that was in turn part of a more expansive historical and spiritual continuum.
