"Mad Cow Disease," or Bovine Spongiform Encephalitis has, to date, largely been a European concern. Following the outbreak of BSE in Britain in the late 1990s it quickly reached epidemic proportions. Entire herds were ordered destroyed, devastating the UK beef industry and rural communities. As nations across Europe banned the import of British Beef, a new and more frightening concern emerged. The diagnosis of new variant Creutsfeldt-Jacob Disease (nvCJD) in humans - both in Britain and in France - raised fears that people had contracted the fatal brain-wasting disease from contaminated beef. Over 100 people have since died of nvCJD in Britain alone, and given the lengthy incubation period, epidemiologists speculate that in a worst-case scenario, the total number of British deaths could eventually exceed one hundred thousand. Even if these figures prove wide-of-the-mark, public concern over food safety is clearly justified. In 2003 the first case of BSE was confirmed in a US herd, and despite the fact that the animal's origin was very quickly</page><page sequence="2">420 BOOK REVIEWS and very publicly traced to Canada, subsequent cases in the US, the most recent in March 2006, underline the fact that BSE and nvCJD can no longer be thought of as purely European phenomena. Originally published in 2001, Maxime Schwartz's How the Cows Turned Mad therefore remains a relevant and important study, although it naturally does not include discussion of more recent developments in the US. Schwartz, a molecular biologist at the Institut Pasteur in Paris starts his tale of the origins of Transmissible Subacute Spongiform Encephalopothies (TSSE's) with the mysterious and fatal symptoms in sheep recorded in 18th-century Britain that were only later identified as the various faces of scrapie. In Schwartz's narrative, the quest to un- mask scrapie runs parallel to the investigation of a similar brain-wasting disease amongst the native human population of Papua New Guinea in the 1960s. This disease, called "kuru," was traced to the indigenous practice of cannibalism, a discovery that was to influence subsequent enquiry into the means of transmission of scrapie, BSE and nvCJD, turning the focus of investigation to the long-established British practice of feeding offal-based Meat and Bone Meal (MBM's) to livestock and poultry. With more than a casual nod to the father of his home insti- tution, Schwartz notes that although Louis Pasteur never worked on scrapie, his work on rabies provided the conceptual framework for the study of TSSE's to this day. In telling the story of these developments, Schwartz overtly invokes the narrative of a "detective story" as a literary device. This certainly makes for gripping reading, but some readers may find Schwartz's tendency to imply almost anthropomorphic intent to "The Disease" (his capitalization), somewhat distracting. Nevertheless, this motif allows Schwartz to expose the dramas of chance, accident and luck that inevitably enliven any honest history of scientific discovery. These in- clude the 'near misses' that resulted from the understandable lack of communication between vets and physiologists, as well as the fortuitous 'lucky breaks' that enabled scientists to join hitherto apparently unre- lated dots, as in the "kuru" example outlined above. Central to the detective story is the elusive character of "The Disease" itself. There were - and indeed remain - significant questions regarding the trans- mission of a disease that appeared to be simultaneously both hereditary and contagious - something that flew in the face of accepted analysis, a problem that was exacerbated by initial difficulties in reproducing the disease in the laboratory. It was in 1997 that Stanley B. Prusiner was awarded the Nobel Prize for the development of his controversial "Prion Theory." Prusiner</page><page sequence="3">BOOK REVIEWS 421 suggested that the agent of the disease was a normal protein that had been modified into a pathogenic form that he termed a prion, which could infect and transform other normal proteins into similarly pathogenic form. In this way Prusiner could account for the apparent protease insensitivity of the disease. Significantly, and what remains controversial about Prusiner's theory, however, is that proteins, which contain no nucleic acid, were previously not thought to be infectious on their own, however, Prion Theory has thus been able to offer a convincing expla- nation of the disease's apparent hereditary and contagious nature.
