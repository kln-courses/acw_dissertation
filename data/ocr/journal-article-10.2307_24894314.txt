<plain_text><page sequence="1">King Kong in the Mist Travel, Knowledge, and Emotion Oliver Lubrich/Katja Liebal In the twentieth century, two key texts about the »greatest of the great apes«, the gorilla, shaped our perception of other primates. At the first glance, they could not be more different. While one represents a Active struggle with an aggressive monster (King Kong, 1932), the other is the memoir of a scientist who researches and protects gentle crea tures (Gorillas in the Mist, 1983). When read as travel narratives, however, both reveal surprising similarities. Starting with a journey to a remote, unknown place, they de scribe the humans' conflicting emotions during their encounter with animals. Both books deal with the recognition that we share cognitive and affective traits with the bestial &gt;other&lt;. The article compares the presentation of gorillas in these different and yet similar texts from the interdisciplinary perspective of literature and primatology. It explores the role of emotions in inter-species interaction and in the process of knowl edge production in the field. Apes fascinate. They are objects of fear, but also of care and compassion. They confront us with psychological and existential challenges. How we understand ourselves as humans is tied to our understanding of our closest relatives, non human primates.1 In the 20th century, two key texts were extremely influential in describing the species of the gorilla. They seem to represent a striking oppo sition: one is a work of popular fiction and part of the advance marketing of a Hollywood movie, the other an autobiographical report of a renowned re searcher. The portrayals of the ape could not be more different. On the one hand, we are presented with an image of aggressive monstrousness; on the other, the author's perspective is characterised by sympathetic, peaceful con tentment. The texts in question are Delos W. Lovelaces 1932 novel King Kong1 and Dian Fossey's 1983 account of her African fieldwork, Gorillas in the Mist.3 Adapted to film, both narratives reached broader, international audiences.4 To gether, they have shaped our perceptions of gorillas, primates, and ourselves. 1 This paper was conceived as part of the interdisciplinary project »Die Affekte der Forscher» (The Researchers' Affects), funded by the VolkswagenStiftung (Az 86 783).

She perceives it as the antithesis to the objectivity of her own scientific approach. She emphasizes the supposed innocence of the animals: »The extraordinary gentleness [...] dispels all the King Kong mythology« (GM 64). Gorillas, in her view, are the »maligned« (GM xv) victims of a vicious misrepresentation. But is King Kong really as one-dimensional as Fossey claims? Is her own perspective as a re searcher really more objective? What can we learn about the images of apes by comparing their most popular representations? What especially can be gained by an interdisciplinary reading - i.e., by examining King Kong from the perspective of primatology and Gorillas in the Mist from that of literary and cultural studies?5 How does, in both cases, the narrative of travel in the form of expeditions to unknown places produce knowledge about non-hu man (and human) primates? 1. Colonial Fantasies Closer inspection reveals surprising parallels between the work of popular fiction and the famous researcher's account of her fieldwork. This is true even on the level of genre. King Kong is a tale of colonial fantasies and exotic ad venture. It tells the story of a venture into unexplored wilderness and a love plot between a &gt;black beast&lt; and a white woman. Despite this seemingly racist and sexist configuration, the novel can also be read as the fictional account of an exploratory expedition. It anticipates primatological approaches to the study of apes. The protagonist, who finds herself at the mercy of the gorilla, unintentionally becomes a kind of field researcher. Gorillas in the Mist, on the other hand, combines elements of a field di ary, an autobiography, and a travelogue. Just as in King Kong, however, a colonial narrative is the basis of Fossey's report. Western observers enter the natural habitat of gorillas, assuming custodianship for an alien ecology and presuming to instruct the natives on how best to manage it. Their per sonal relationships with the apes eclipse those formed with the indigenous inhabitants. In this colonial scenario, Gorillas in the Mist rehearses a con ventional sequence of »discover[y]« (GM 20), occupation (»[a]s a pio neer«, GM 25), denomination (»I named«, GM 60), founding (»I estab lished the Karisoke Research Centre«, GM 25), and the enforcement of or der (with »loyal and dedicated assistants«, GM 25) by a white protagonist in a foreign land. King Kong is a mountain gorilla, living on »Skull Moun tain Island«, which certainly resembles Fossey's research area - a zone span 5 Most studies of King Kong refer to the film, while only very few deal with the novel, for example Horst-Jürgen Gerigk, Der Mensch als Affe in der deutschen, französischen, russischen, englischen und amerikanischen Literatur des 19. und 20. Jahrhunderts. Hürt genwald 1989, pp. 148-152.</page><page sequence="3">King Kong in the Mist 51 ning Rwanda, Tanzania, and Zaire - in so far as it is also described as a »man-locked mountain island« (GM 238). Just as a wall demarcates the section of King Kong's island avoided by humans and treated as a reserve, Fossey defends the national park in which she conducts her research as a »heartland« or »last stronghold« of the animals. She seeks to protect this refuge from poachers who track gorillas across its borders in order to kill them or sell them abroad as living trophies. In a similar manner, humans eventually penetrate into King Kong's lair in order to capture him and bring him to America. Without their meddling, his monstrous side would never have come to light. From this perspective, King Kong is an environ mentalist plea, a call for protecting the natural habitat of a rare species. In this respect, the novel is actually very close to Dian Fossey who, as an activist, campaigns against holding and »exhibit[ing]« (GM xvii) apes in cap tivity. Two of her gorillas would later die in the Cologne Zoo, just as King Kong dies in Manhattan.6 She describes how a captive is restrained and »wired on to bamboo poles« (GM 108), evoking the image of the monster in chains. And she admires the gorillas' ability to »break free« from traps (GM 30), much as King Kong does before the spectacular finale of the novel. The image of the &gt;noble savage&lt; seems to seep out of ethnography and into primatology. Fossey uses terms that denote the aristocracy of her charges - »nobility« (GM 139), »majesty« (GM 150) or »regal[ity]« (GM 139) - while their Hol lywood kinsman also bears a royal title: King Kong. Furthermore, just as the journey to the island in King Kong is part of a film expedition, film plays an important role in Fossey's work. From her very first encounters with the animals, her camera arouses their curiosity: »As if com peting for attention, some animals went through a series of actions that in cluded yawning, symbolic-feeding, branch-breaking or chestbeating. After each display the gorillas would look at us quizzically as if trying to determine the effect of their show« (GM 4). While Fossey anthropomorphizes the goril las and regards them as harmless, Lovelace strongly advises against making them an object of media attention. Blinded by the flashbulbs of photogra phers, King Kong bursts from his chains. In both cases, it is a woman who develops an especially close bond with the animal, and in both instances it is a man who initiates her journey. The actress Ann Darrow is brought into the wilderness by the director Carl Denham, while Dian Fossey is encouraged by her mentor Louis Leakey to fly to Africa. Seen as colonial travel narratives, Gorillas in the Mist and King Kong are in fact much more similar than their authors - and their audiences - would have suspected. 6 Unlike lowland gorillas, mountain gorillas are not held in zoos, as they perish in cap tivity.</page><page sequence="4">52 Oliver Lubrich/Katja Liebal 2. The Researchers' Affects The way we understand apes and gain knowledge about them in the field is indivisible from the emotions with which we approach them. How do these two &gt;primatographies&lt; - the popular and the scientific - describe the emo tional reactions of people to primates?7 The question of who terrorizes whom seems to be answered unequivocally, but in two different ways. In King Kong, the ape scares the humans; in Gorillas in the Mist, humans scare the apes. It might be expected that the Hollywood fantasy relies on simple affects while the scientific report might either avoid or critically reflect upon them. But does the scientific perspective really provide an objective perception of reali ty? Dian Fossey repeatedly invokes the postulate of distance and neutrality: »the observer should not interfere« (GM 121). She does acknowledge, how ever, that her emotions challenge this approach: »my scientific detachment dissolved« (GM 182); »my intentions to remain a detached scientific observer dissolved« (GM 225). The field worker's perception is both caused and shaped by her feelings: the proximity to the animal, her loneliness in the wil derness, her anger at the poachers. Even the paratexts indicate that the author has a very emotional relationship with the subjects of her inquiry. The blurbs call the gorillas »shy«, »affectionate« and »beloved«. The »Acknowledgments« extend »deepest gratitude to the gorillas« (GM xi) and the author refers to certain animals warmly by name. Initially Fossey hints at the difficulties of her research in an unknown envi ronment. She recalls disturbing experiences (»traumas in Africa«, GM xi) and their long-lasting consequences (»withdrawal symptoms«, GM xi). The depres sion her assistants suffer in the remoteness of the research center she refers to ironically as »astronaut blues« (GM 156). Most of all, however, they constantly have »feelings« and show a certain »sensitivity« (GM 164) that has an effect on their job. Fossey describes her own research trip as an education sentimentale: her longing for a land of her »dreams« (GM 1), diverse joys, but also worries, disappointments, sadness and grief as well as feelings of guilt.8 The researcher developed an affectionate »friendship« to certain animals (»My beloved Rafiki, a friend for seven years«, GM 149) and even maternal feelings, when she calls a young gorilla »baby« and compares herself to its mother (GM 110,225). The apes become her surrogate family. Her reward is emotional; it consists of un forgettable affections (GM 140f.). Fossey is »touched« by the animals in more 7 For literary &gt;primatography&lt; refer to Roland Borgards, Affen. Von Aristoteles bis Soemmering.

Würzburg 2010, pp. 239-253. 8 The published depiction of affects in Gorillas in the Mist can be compared to Dian Fossey's personal notes.

New York 1987.</page><page sequence="5">King Kong in the Mist 53 than one way. In a sentimental way, she reports of »the first gorilla ever to touch me« (GM 141), and she describes a scene in which his and her hand do actually touch: »[I] extended my hand«, »[he] extended his hand« (GM 141). On the same page she claims with some passion, emphasizing the message in capital letters: »I'VE FINALLY BEEN ACCEPTED BY A GORILLA« (GM 141). The field worker is not so much about to go native than to transgress the line be tween species - which touches her emotionally: »I felt I might have crossed an intangible barrier between human and ape« (GM 141). Thus, the research project described in Gorillas in the Mist is framed as a sentimental journey. The entire plot is depicted in terms of the researcher's emotions. There is, however, one exception: transgressive behaviour on the part of the apes fails to elicit a corresponding reaction. A whole section of the affective spectrum is omitted. During her extensive fieldwork, the primatol ogist also registers kinds of behaviour on the part of her beloved animals that could cause disgust, revulsion, or horror in humans. Apes ingest their excre ments (GM 46, 198), they practice polygamy (GM 64), and they commit in cest (GM 72, 230). Repeatedly Fossey reports outbreaks of violence (»intra group aggression«, GM 86) and observes that individuals are excluded from the group (»social ostracism«, GM 70; »scapegoat«, GM 84,195) or mistreat ed (»abuse«, GM 100, 101). There are also instances of »aggression between groups« (GM xviii), e.g., when rivalry over females or territory is vented in fights and gorillas show hostility or even cruelty towards unknown members of their species (»xenophobia«, GM 228; »xenophobic brutality«, GM 227). Most animals carry the marks of such brutality: wounds, scars, injured eyes, broken teeth. According to Fossey, gorillas desecrate corpses (GM 104), they torture the sick, they seem to relish in sadism (»they wanted to extend her suffering as long as possible for their own sport«, GM 226), and they even torment babies (»torture«, GM 225; »combined attack on the baby«, GM 226). »The brutality of Group 5's two females«, Fossey acknowledges, »was agonizing to watch, the infant's cries unbearable« (GM 225). When gorilla males take over a new group, they often kill the offspring of the previous silverback. In contrast to other great ape species (orangutans, chimpanzees, bonobos),9 there is no direct evidence that gorillas eat slain young. Yet Fossey suspects that this may actually have occurred in isolated instances. »[Ijnfanticide« (GM 150) and »cannibalism« (GM 77) threaten her benevolent image of apes. To deal with these observations, she uses several strategies of affect-avoidance. Initially, she reacts apologetically and simply refuses to recognize cruel behaviour as such: »In my opinion the concept of ' For instance: Andrew Fowler/Gottfried Hohmann, Cannibalism in Wild Bonobos (Pan paniscus) at Lui Kotale.

She offers explanation for violence: »By killing Frito, Beetsme would be destroying an infant sired by a competitor, and Flossie would again become fertile« (GM 218). Most importantly, Fossey attributes the causes of violence to humans (GM 238). Conflicts between groups of go rillas, she argues, were caused by »human encroachment« (GM xviii). Hence Fossey can mourn the disturbing infanticides as results of human actions (»the devastation poachers create by killing the leader of a gorilla group«, GM 218). Only when she can attribute simian cruelty to human crimes, she can permit herself to feel grief and indignation (»To my deepest sorrow, Mwelu, Digit's only offspring, was killed by Nunkie«, GM 220). Ultimately, terror and repulsion always can be traced back to human agency. In order to cope rhetorically with observations of gorilla violence, Fossey changes her stylistic register. She neutralizes the incidences using sober and objective descriptions: »transfers make younger females three times more likely to lose their infants from infanticide« (GM 176); »evolved strategies of transfers between groups, or even infanticide, may serve as means of dissem ination of genetic variability throughout the small remaining population« (GM 238). An elaborate technical vocabulary is used (»infanticidal«, »elimi nated«, »unrelated«, GM 190), and passive voice constructions provide addi tional distance: »infant loss may be strongly associated with new pair-bond ing« (GM 177); »infanticide [...] should [...] be considered as an evolved mechanism functioning for genetic perpetuation« (GM 196). When particularly horrid phenomena have to be mentioned (such as a possible co-occurrence of infanticide and cannibalism), Fossey employs the most elaborate rhetorical distancing devices: »Should another infant disap pear, dung washing must be undertaken immediately. Perhaps then the ques tion of the existence of cannibalism among gorillas might be answered satis factorily« (GM 78). The examination of gorilla feces indeed reveals »slivers of bone and teeth« (GM 77), »one hundred and thirty-three fragments of bone and teeth« in total (GM 78). Nonetheless, at least in this book, Fossey declares the question of cannibalism in gorilla populations to remain unsolved, a ges ture which suggests that the researcher's emotions, such as affection, empathy and shame, have affected her scientific findings. 3. The Affects of Hollywood Before we encounter the giant wild gorilla on the island in King Kong, we are presented with the tame monkey »Ignatz« aboard the ship (KK starting p. 20). He represents the domesticated version of the encounter with nonhuman pri mates. The monkey is being portrayed in humanized terms as »sensitive« (KK 65), »peaceable and friendly« (KK 23), but also as »jealous« (KK 40). In</page><page sequence="7">King Kong in the Mist 55 this way, the protagonist Ann Darrow's affinity to monkeys is being intro duced as early as during the voyage, (KK 21, 24, 27, 40). As in Gorillas in the Mist, intimacy and friendship between human and animal emerge as an un derlying theme in an almost &gt;post-humanist&lt; way. However, King Kong certainly does elicit all shades of »stupor« (KK 70), »hysteria« (KK 45), »panic« (KK 78), and »deadly fear« (KK 37). Yet these affects have a dual origin. The beast attacks the humans only when provoked by them, while the people already dread the animal before any encounter has taken place. Hence, King Kong's brutality is man-made in more than one sense of the word. Where, then, does this fear of the herbivore originate? The novel is remarkably self-reflective in this regard. On the way to the island, the actress rehearses how she is to react to the animal upon encounter (KK 27). The director instructs her in all the phases and facets of fear: »You are amazed. [...] It's horrible. But you are fascinated« (KK 27). As a form of psycho-ped agogic method acting, artificially induced emotions cause real emotions: »Ann was not simulating fear. She was afraid« (KK 27). Thus she already knows the prescribed feelings before meeting the gorilla. The novel presents the fear of the beast as a culturally coded behaviour: as an anticipation which is not based on experience. This affective predisposition is subsequently ac tualized but also exceeded, since in the actual interaction more than just the trained horror comes to the fore. King Kong is by no means merely a figure of terror. The ape is the object of »[w]onder« (KK 137; 45)10 and curiosity (KK 60); he is dangerously ap pealing (KK 107) and at times irresistible (KK 37). He can even evoke sym pathy - both in the readers and in his antagonists. When fighting with other animals, be it dinosaurs, water snakes, or spiders, humans identify with him: »[Ann] wanted Kong to win« (KK 100); »[Jack] was no more than a breath away from a supporting shout«, »the mate could have cried out in thanks« (KK 116). Thus the members of the expedition go through a complex drama turgy of affects: Fear, shock, disgust, as well as aggression, amazement, admi ration, jealously, sympathy, and compassion. Just as varied as the affects towards King Kong are his own. The text spec ifies »rage« (KK 100), »fury« (KK 101), »loathing« (KK 117), an enormous outburst (»cataclysmic emotion which surged from his inmost being«, KK 146), as well as cool self-control (»his rage was in check«, KK 100), »wild ecstasy« (KK 118), and cautious apprehension (»distaste for water«, KK 122), joy (»pleasure«, »satisfaction«, KK 101), and »disappointment« (KK 135). The ape shows a certain desire for his female prey," but also tender care.12 The 10 Stephen Greenblatt, Marvelous Possessions. The Wonder of the New World. Chicago 1991. The »wonderful» is either being aesthetically enjoyed or colonized and destroyed. 11 »Kong [...] touched Ann solicitously» (KK 101); »the inviting whiteness» (KK 118); »he felt it excitedly», »touched the smooth revelation» (KK 118). 12 »Carefully», »anxiously», »gently» (KK 102); »care», »caution» (KK 87); »with Ann's bright head cradled in one arm» (KK 75).</page><page sequence="8">56 Oliver Lubrich/Katja Liebal word »gentle«, which is used to describe the giant gorilla, is the key term employed by Dian Fossey to characterize her own gorillas and to distinguish them from the fictitious King Kong. However, this attribution of tenderness towards the human female raises more questions than it answers. Can Kong's interest in Ann be explained in a merely behavioristic framework? Is the ape drawn to the human »[o]nly as a magpie is attracted by a shining stone«, »only because it was strange« (KK 111)? Or does the ape show a genuine ap preciation of beauty? Does he possess aesthetic emotions? »Beauty softens and attracts and in the end encompasses the destruction of the Beast«, the impre sario Denham explains; »he'll never again be quite the same king of the forest. Brute strength will have yielded to something higher« (KK 111). These words, with which the novel concludes, form the &gt;epitaph&lt; for King Kong: »Beauty killed the Beast« (KK 156). Emotions are transformative, and they might make one vulnerable. This is the essence of this tragic tale of the »beauty« and the »beast«: His &gt;humanity&lt; is Kong's undoing. King Kong and Gorillas in the Mist both employ generic devices to commu nicate knowledge about primates to a broader readership in highly emotional terms. Is the animal even capable of love? Denham is certain that »Ann means something« to King Kong, because »when he looked on her something inside him gave way«. The metaphor of »a spark« igniting in his »huge head« is used (KK 110). In fact, Fossey employs the same term to describe certain cognitive properties in the apes (»a spark of interest«, GM 113). Like a tragic lover, King Kong finally dies when he is - literally and symbolically - shot »into his heart« (KK 155). In Fossey's memoirs, a gorilla with the anthropomorphic name »Uncle Bert« dies the same - sad and significant - death. In the end, the rel evant emotion that Kong has to learn from humans is not love but fear: »He's got something to learn. Something man can teach any animal. That's fear!« (KK 137). Does fear make the man - and humanize the ape? 4. What Can Be Seen in the Mist? The narratives of King Kong and Gorillas in the Mist have defined our rela tionship with gorillas and influenced our affective responses to apes. Which knowledge of apes and humans do they each convey? How is it gained and constructed? Dian Fossey starts from the premise that nature is good, especially that of gorillas (GM 158, xv, 214). Instead of researching in an unbiased manner, she advocates a preconceived belief: »I have always been convinced of the intrin sically gentle nature of gorillas« (GM 56). While the first encounter in King Kong is described - from the perspective of a sacrificial victim - as the menace of a strange monster, Dian Fossey elevates her gorillas from the outset onto a »human-like« plane. She seeks to establish a relationship, which is not char acterized by domination or fear, but rather by respect and understanding.</page><page sequence="9">King Kong in the Mist 57 Gorillas teach humans something, and this predisposition in itself reverses the power dynamics: »From them I learned to accept the animals on their own terms and never to push them beyond the varying levels of tolerance they were willing to give« (GM 14). Increasingly the animals become her confi dants, potentially even members of her own species. Accordingly, the gorillas are given names (starting from chapter 4), in some instances genuinely hu man names (such as Beethoven or Brahms), which bestow on them culture and »personalities« (GM 169). At one point Fossey remarks that she is aware of the dangers of anthropo morphizing: »Humanizing [...], albeit tempting, is a serious error« (GM 105). However, this insight does not have any obvious consequences. Fossey consistently attributes human emotions and qualities to the apes, such as »laughter and smiles« (GM 121), and even »love« (GM 72). In many dif ferent ways Gorillas in the Mist compares apes to humans: they appear, for example, »like a human child« (GM 84), »like children« (GM 118), »spoiled human children« (GM 116), »boys at a summer camp« (GM 145), »similar to that of a human parent« (GM 88), »resembling a gracefully aging old mar ried couple« (GM 140). Anthropomorphic metaphors support such comparisons. In the world of gorillas there are »TV dinners« (GM 46) and an »hors d'oeuvres menu« (GM 129), a »rabble-rouser« (GM 196) and a »summer vacation« (GM 196), »square-dance« (GM 173), »pirouettes« (GM 197) and a »mini-minstrel band« (GM 197). The apes appear as historical figures, scientists, cartoon or movie characters: »Admiral Nelson« (GM 80), »Marie Curie« (GM 80), »Bugs Bunny« (GM 94) or »a young silverback without a cause« (GM 194, see also 205). »Digit« is being elevated to an old-fashioned movie hero: »he gave his life to save his family«, he dies »tragically« (GM 208) in his »last battle« (GM 206). Fossey credits the animals with human thought and expression. Using the rhetorical technique of sermocinatio, she even invents a dialogue in which they ask one another to take a walk: »Okay guys, let's just see what's on the other side of this next little hill!« (GM 51, similarly 97,98). Woman and beast live in an isolated area of idealized co-existence. The mist of the title, meta phorically, erases all differences. 5. Who is King Kong? Reading King Kong as a contribution to primatology may initially appear to be a somewhat far-fetched undertaking. However, there are a sufficient num ber of clues. When Ann Darrow inadvertently becomes a fieldworker, she has to try to understand the behaviour of the dangerous animal and is forced to compare its reactions to her own actions in a manner analogous to an ethol ogist. The other characters also observe the ape and interpret his behaviour</page><page sequence="10">58 Oliver Lubrich/Katja Liebal in order to overpower him. When Jack Driscoll pursues King Kong to rescue the woman he loves, he contemplates how to best manipulate »Kong's tem per«, but »not provoke him« (KK 101). The novel deals with biological facts about gorillas rather casually. King Kong lives near Sumatra (not in Rwanda, Uganda, or the Congo like real mountain gorillas), he sleeps in a cave (not in a hand-made nest), and kills humans (rather than fighting with other apes). Those inaccuracies might be attributed to the fact that, at the time of the conception of novel and film, very little was known about gorillas. The French Africanist Paul Belloni Du Chaillu (1835-1903) was probably the first European to have encountered a wild gorilla during his travels in the late 1850s. After his reports, interest in this species in Europe and the USA steadily grew.13 The first scientific works of George Schaller, however, were not published for another century.14 The portrayal of King Kong does not claim to be accurate or naturalistic. Yet the novel touches upon the central research areas of primatology: behav iour, affective expression, body language, facial gestures, and vocalizations. King Kong is compared to chimpanzees and certain behaviours are described rather aptly, for example, the way gorillas carry their young (as King Kong carries the woman), the avoidance of deep water (King Kong cannot swim),15 and the chest-drumming which King Kong used as an expression of aggres sion or a sign of imminent attack (although gorillas actually use it in a wide variety of often non-aggressive contexts).16 The real features of dominance, however, are missing: King Kong is not a »silverback«. He has no group to lead. He is the last of his kind - his extinction is imminent. The novel repeatedly draws the reader's attention to the precarious status of gorillas. Is he animal, beast and creature, monster or devil, human or a God? He is referred to as »ape« (KK 143), »ogre« (KK 119), »Thing« (KK 76) 13 Paul Belloni Du Chaillu, Explorations and Adventures in Equatorial Africa: With Ac counts of the Manners and Customs of the People, and of the Chase of the Gorilla, the Crocodile, Leopard, Elephant, Hippopotamus, and Other Animals.

Alternatives, questions and vague formulations il lustrate this uncertainty: »Some kind of a gorilla« (KK 139), »neither man nor beast« (KK 37), »If he really is all beast« (KK 126), »more than beast« (KK 110), »almost human« (KK 87). Combinations of words, not only in the title, further emphasize King Kong's hybrid nature - with or without hyphen ation: »beast king« (KK 117), »ape-beast« (KK 116), »beast-god«, »beast god« (KK 75, 80). King Kong is a composite: the missing link between ape and human. The kinship with humans cannot be denied, although chimpanzees are the closest relatives to humans. The sacrificed women are presented to King Kong not explicitly to kill or eat, but as »bride[s]« (KK 55), as if in a forced marriage to a strange man. Even the narrative perspective gives King Kong equal status to humans. The novel takes on - in internal focalization - the perspectives of the human protagonists as well as that of the ape.17 It never takes on the point of view of the other species, such as dinosaurs, insects, or spiders. Other an imals do not possess a narrative consciousness. It is suggested but then immediately retracted that Kong might share cog nitive and affective capacities with humans: »his primitive brain valued this strange possession [= Ann] for reasons it could not understand« (KK 87). The neutral pronoun (»it«) is equivocal here: It could refer both to his brain or to King Kong as a whole. Since he has been referred to by the personal pronoun (»his«) previously, this would now relegate him from a person to a thing. From the point of view of the woman on the altar (KK 73), the beast stepping out of the brush initially appears to be a monster, an »it«. But on closer in spection and considering the cognitive capacities, it becomes a person, »he«. Thus the narrator can proclaim emphatically that he found »the reason«. On ly from the point of view of the male pursuer, the nonhuman primate appears again as an »it« or a »Thing« (KK 76) in the next chapter. As in Dian Fossey's work, the gorilla is granted human-like capacities, while at the same time being set apart from human beings. »Kong [...] is the one thing outside the wall that is something more than a beast. He's one of na ture's errors, like all the others, but he was nearly not an error« (KK 110). The peculiar expression »nearly not« reveals the human fear that other creatures might be or become like them. King Kong must be an error of evolution since it is not acceptable that he might be like us. King Kong's ambivalent position between animality and humanity is emphasized at several points: »as hairy as any simian creatures of an African jungle whom he resembled in all but size, 17 »His primitive brain valued this strange possession for reasons it could not under stand« (KK 87); »to touch the curious, golden crest« (KK 73); »explore the amazing being who drooped across his arm« (KK 74); »his fingers discovered endless mystery« (KK 74); »a challenging figure [...] shot a whistling something past his ear« (KK 74).</page><page sequence="12">60 Oliver Lubrich/Katja Liebal the fact that he picked his way with a slow, almost human caution, made him all the more incredible« (KK 87). In the words of Homi Bhabha, King Kong is »almost the same, but not quite«.18 Ideological opposites seem to organize the popular novel: civilization and nature (New York and Skull Mountain Island), modernity and primitiveness (the neon signs of the metropolis and the torches of indigenous rituals), cold and warmth (snow here and tropical heat there), light and darkness (the lights of the village and the darkness of the forest), purity and dirt, black and white (the blonde American and the black ape), man and woman, human and an imal, good and evil. By pointing out numerous equivalences, however, these antitheses are subtly being challenged. Thus, there seems to be »asphalt« (KK 85) in the wilderness, while planes appear like »humming bird[s]« (KK 155). Just as the gorilla battled flying dinosaurs before, he ends up fight ing flying machines. The Empire State Building replaces his mountain cave (KK 150 and passim), he finds himself in »the same regal loneliness« there (KK 156). In the big city, Ann shares the feeling of »being back there« (KK 148) on the island. In the end, King Kong symbolically stands »high above the civilization which had destroyed him« (KK 156). Just as Carl Denham would have been willing to »kidnap« (KK 11) a wom an himself to bring her to the island, the gorilla is about to capture her to take her to his kingdom. Just as Ann was presented to him on the altar (KK 72, 142), the ape is put on display in a New York theater. Just as he is a »thing« and an »animal« to the humans, they are »man-things« (KK 102) and »man animal[s]« to him (KK 114). Jack Driscoll in particular has much in common with the beast, most no tably his affection for Ann. He carries her just like King Kong (»[sjecurely cradled«, KK 127). As a »mate«, he is not only a sailor or traveler, but also King Kong's counterpart (KK 102) and the woman's as well as the ape's »mat ing partner«. The confusion of opposites is illustrated in the visual paradox of the »white shadow« (KK 125, referring to the white woman's dark silhou ette), or in the borderline phenomenon of »twilight« (KK 3). King Kong thus appears neither in the sharp contrast of black and white, nor in the benevolent soft-focus of the mist, but in an eerie crepuscule. 6. The Beast as a Human, the Human as a Beast In one scene the ambivalent relationship between ape and human is illustrat ed in a particularly disconcerting manner. King Kong undresses Ann Darrow: »he began to pluck her clothes away as a chimpanzee might clumsily undress a doll« (KK 118). Looking back on this event, the escapee recalls in terror: 18 Homi Bhabha, Of Mimicry and Man: The Ambivalence of Colonial Discourse. In: The Location of Culture. London, New York 1994, pp. 85-92; here p. 86.</page><page sequence="13">King Kong in the Mist 61 »Jack! It was horrible being in his hands. You can't imagine such hands, unless they have really touched you ... felt you, as though trying to puzzle you out« (KK 126f.). »And sometimes, from the way he looked at me ... from the way he carried me carefully up in the crook of this arm instead of dragging me along, as he did at the start... I wondered ... I thought...« (KK 127). What do these omissions mean? Do they represent indications of distress or symptoms of repression? In that case, what would be repressed here? Is it King Kong's surprising humanity? Is a rape being suggested? If it is, King Kong's behaviour is still being presented as rather awkward (»clumsily«); in Ann's own words it is cautious (»carefully«). Does Ann misinterpret King Kong's touch? Or is she frightened by her own feelings? Has the animal awak ened an animalistic lust? Ann's report ends in »hysterical terror« (KK 127). But what is she terrified of? Is she scared of the beast or of herself? The fantasy of sex between the black beast and the white woman appears to belong to the human rather than the ape. It almost seems conspicuous that the narrator compares King Kong's be haviour in this situation with that of a chimp: »[H]e began to pluck her clothes away as a chimpanzee might clumsily undress a doll« (KK 118). Sim ilarly, Fossey refers to chimpanzees when investigating the question of canni balism: »such behavior has been recorded among free-living chimpanzees« (GM 77). Is the idea of terrible behaviour being projected onto a different species?19 If that is the case, then why not onto humans? Is what King Kong might do to the woman any different from what men do? By referring to a third species, the difference between human and gorilla is defended precisely where there is none. Is not cruelty the human quality of the beast? If so, the novel would thus anticipate a recent insight in primatology not developed until the 1990s and formulated with reference to chimpanzees.20 Apes are neither evil creatures (a view that corresponds to the popular understanding of King Kong) nor noble savages (in Dian Fossey's sense). It is precisely their »primitive behavior« that we share with them. What is at stake in King Kong is the human-likeness of the ape in his brutality. If we read it psychoanalytically, the terrible animal is not »out there« but »within« us. The nightmarish expedition »beyond the horrors of dreams« (KK 69) leads to King Kong and directly into one's own abysses of consciousness. The island with its mountain shaped like a skull is an allegory. A wall divides it into two sections: totem and taboo, the conscious and the unconscious, neocortex and amygdala. The expedition reveals not the external &gt;other&lt;, but the repressed &gt;self&lt;. 19 A rape of a human female by a male orangutan has been described in Birute M. F.

King Kong represents the human fear of the unknown, dangerous, fantastical. The horrifyingly uncanny (&gt;das Unheimliche^1), however, is the secretly known. King Kong is the monstrous expression of human violence, the distorted im age of human cruelty. The gorilla has been interpreted as an ambiguous alle gory or projective foil for colonial fantasies, racism, fascism and pathological perversion.22 Hence it is no coincidence when the beast »massacres« the na tives in the end, as if it were a European colonial power, committing a kind of pogrom (»Insensate massacre followed«, KK 135), such as that set in mo tion on the largest scale in Europe in 1933, the year of the movie's release. 7. Science and Popular Culture How much gorilla is in King Kong7. How much King Kong is in humans? How objective can and should science be? Dian Fossey emphasizes the animals' positive human qualities while suppressing negative experiences. Gorillas in the Mist disambiguates while also containing descriptions that unintention ally correspond to the rejected King Kong &gt;mythology&lt;. King Kong on the other hand deals with an irritating doubt. The novel, despite obvious gaps of knowl edge regarding the behaviour of gorillas, creates a surprisingly complex char acter that causes a multitude of reactions: as a beast, it has human qualities. Reading both texts from an interdisciplinary perspective and &gt;against the grain&lt; provides insights into the way humans perceive their closest relatives. The popular novel appears to exploit emotions in a sensationalist fashion, but it develops a more contradictory picture of the ape or the relationship to the ape than might be expected. The scientific report, on the other hand, provides a variety of empirical observations of individual gorillas, but proves to be selectively emotional, due to the researcher's identification with her subjects. In order to understand these conceptions of the gorilla, we need to reflect on the affective logic of each travel and text, fieldwork and narrative. Fossey mostly evades such a reflection. King Kong does not. In this light, is the work of fiction a more appropriate account of reality than the work of the scientist? This is of course a provocative question, but the way in which the gorilla is observed, interpreted, and judged in King Kong seems to be more complex and more critical than Dian Fossey's decidedly idealized conception of apes. 21 Sigmund Freud, Das Unheimliche [ 1919].

The members of the film crew in King Kong as well as the field researcher in Gorillas in the Mist find themselves as strangers in an unfamiliar environment where they encounter a species dif ferent from and yet similar to their own. They find out what it means to be »gorilla«, but also what it means to be »human«.
