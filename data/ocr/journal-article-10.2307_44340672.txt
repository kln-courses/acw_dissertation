<plain_text><page sequence="1">MOORTOWN diary Ted Hughes Faber. £3.99 This is one of Ted's best, a reprint of the first third of Moortown (1979), with a new introduction and notes. It was a good idea to isolate these 83 c Ih 3 PQ £ V *&gt;</page><page sequence="2">84 CÄ Ē £ u *&gt; unified reports of a Dartmoor farmer from their very different com- panions. At first the introduction looks an ti- poetic: So these improvised notes are nothing more than this: my own way of getting reasonably close to what is going on, and staying close, and of excluding everything else that might be pressing to interfere with the watching eye. In a sense, the method excludes the poetic process as well. If I missed the moment - which meant letting a night's sleep intervene before I took up pen - the processes of memory, the poetic process, had already started. Though all the details were still absolutely fresh, most of them no longer seemed essential to the new pattern taking control. But this is anti-memory, not anti-poetry. A passion to look and write down what you see is already selection and arrangement, and if the sensibility is Ted Hughes's, iťs art: a poet's attention plus first-class writing. Of course the animal life is anthropomorphic, the creatures osmotic with Hughesosophy, even in the notes: Yet I was more touched by the redwings, who hurried about in smaller, quieter detachments, with secretive cries, the lost stragglers of an army rather than an army. These more diffident foreigners seemed by contrast much more aware of their plight, much more exposed to the ultimate fact: that this was all there was. There are those who do not like like', mixed metaphors and personifi- cations, but Hughes gets away with them 'like' Shakespeare. In New Year gales - . . . the earth Is massaged with roots. The powers of hills Hold their bright faces in the wind-shine. The hills are being honed. The river Thunders like a factory, its weirs Are tremendous engines. Mechanical nature! The descriptions are baroque, craggy, violent as farm-life, and effortlessly witty. In a high wind cows are 'like nails in a tin roof - 'As if their hooves held their field in place'. It is 'their' not 'my' field: sinking to the fetlocks in mud, 'They are ruining their field and they know it'. The attention is microscopic at all points as on a Pre-Raphaelite canvas. Dehorning cows - the wire pulls through The last hinge of hair, the horn is heavy and free, And a water-pistol jet of blood Rains over the one who holds it - a needle jet From the white-rasped and bloody skull-crater. Then tweezers Twiddle the artery nozzle, knotting it enough, And purple antiseptic squirts a cuttlefish cloud over it. The text reminds Hughes of 'what a shattering effect the operation had on me, though I am not squeamish. As if the horns had been repeatedly sawn off me'. It also reminds us of how a water-pistol or any word like 'twiddle' will serve his turn if precise - again like Shakespeare, whom Dr</page><page sequence="3">Johnson condemned for bringing a 'bath' or a 'blanket' into the sublime. While there is much pain in this volume, there is a new tender recognition of tenderness in animals. Reading good Hughes is a training in the art of looking, though his organ-voice is not a good model. Many poems here, like 'Roe Deer', 'Struggle' and 'Last Night', suggestive of Birds, Beast and Flowers , though utterly different, are in that class: high praise, from me. Shakespeare, Lawrence, Frost . . . the dead poets his ancestors raise their heads. Herbert Lomas</page></plain_text>
