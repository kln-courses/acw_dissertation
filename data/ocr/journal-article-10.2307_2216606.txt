<plain_text><page sequence="1">328 THE CRITERIA OF RELIGIOUS IDENTITY 1. RELIGIOUS IDENTIFICATIONS Religious doctrines are often weird, though sometimes we fail to notice this, for familiarity banishes surprise. One of the stranger features of them is the manner in which on occasion one spiritual entity is identified with another. For instance, in the Christian creed three such entities are held to be one; in the Upanisads there is the doctrine that Brahman, the Reality behind the visible world, is identical with the Atman or Self; while in Mahay- ana Buddhism we discover that all Buddhas are united in the dharma-kdya, their Truth-Body which is the same as Absolute Reality (tathatd). At a more primitive level we find such assertions as this: They speak of Indra, Mitra, Varuna and Agni, Also of the heavenly fair-winged Garutman; In various ways they are referring to one Reality: They speak of Agni, Yama and Matarisvan.1 Also it is not uncommon for polytheists to identify foreign gods with their own. With these latter two types of identity-statements, however, I shall not be concerned here, since they are relatively easy to understand: the first kind is a consequence of the urge to be more systematic and ultimately to evolve a doctrine of one God rather than many2; while the second is straightforwardly based upon similarities in mythology-some of which are due in any case to common descent; and these are similarities which obtain between entities of the same type. This kind of identity, incidentally, is exemplified in modern times by such claims as that Christians and Muslims really worship the same God. But one comment on these two kinds is ap- posite : that they also illustrate a feature of doctrinal thinking-to search for identities where in other realms of discourse one might be more inclined to seek classifications. It is, however, the other examples which are of more immediate interest and difficulty. My object is to describe the sort of grounds upon which they rest. But I do not propose to go on to the further question as to whether the sort of grounds described should be considered adequate. 2. THE WEIRDNESS OF THESE IDENTIFICATIONS I shall begin with the most familiar of the three examples mentioned above, namely the identification of Christ with the Father. Its oddness can be brought out as follows : (i) The location of Jesus during his life was .Rg Veda, I. 164. 2This point is unaffected by theories of a primitive High God (with later degeneration into polytheism), since when we meet polytheistic religions, as in early Greece and in Vedism, there seems to be no recollection thereof and the struggle towards a simpler insight still has to be made.</page><page sequence="2">THE CRITERIA OF RELIGIOUS IDENTITY 329 Palestine, whereas the Father has always existed in heaven. Admittedly the latter is no ordinary place, but nevertheless it looks superficially as though the two Persons identified are in different places, and this would, in ordinary identity-statements about people, entail the falsity of the claim. (ii) Jesus possessed personal characteristics in a literal sense, whereas the Father only has them in an analogical sense (and, moreover, Jesus had physical properties). (iii) Jesus was in time, the Father not. And so on. It is true that Christ is held to be the Logos, to sit on the right hand of the Father in heaven, etc., and thus to possess other-worldly attributes. But these are not, so to speak, data upon which an identification could be based, but rather are consequences of such an identification. The problem I wish to discuss is : What are the criteria of such identity-statements in religion ? Clearly, Christ's supra-mundane position (in heaven) is not a ground for asserting that He and the Father are one, but rather, as I have said, a con- sequence (or a part) of that claim. The third example mentioned has some similarities to the Christian case. For a full explication of it, one must advert to the so-called tri-kdya doctrine, namely the doctrine that a Buddha possesses three bodies. First, a Buddha has his nirmdna-kdya or Transformation Body: this is the form in which he appears on earth-the most important instance being that of the historical Buddha Gautama.3 In this form he works for the salvation of all creatures. The name of the Body is due to the belief that the eternal Buddha appears in an unreal physical form for the edification of mankind, this being part of his updya-kausdlya or skilfulness in means (of leading men to salvation): thus the earthly appearance is a kind of magical trans- formation. But although the picture presented here of the historical Buddha is thoroughly infected with docetism, and although the Mahayanist theo- logians rejected the Hindu notion of avatdra or divine descent (i.e. incarna- tion), nevertheless there remain analogies between the Buddhist and Christian beliefs. From the logical point of view there remains the problem of deter- mining the grounds upon which an historical figure is to be counted the Transformation Body of the eternal Buddha. Next, a Buddha possesses a sambhoga-kaya or Bliss Body, in which, for instance, he appears to assemblies of Bodhisattvas (Buddhas-to-be) and which is radiant and glorious. This celestial manifestation of the Supreme Buddha-hood assimilates the Buddhas to Hindu deities and provides the basis for worship of and devotion to a heavenly figure-such as Amitabha in the Pure Land sects. Third, there is the most important aspect of all : the dharma-kdya or Truth Body, which is identical for all Buddhas and is indeed the same as ultimate Reality (tathatd)' This is called the support of the other Bodies and is in fact the fundamental spiritual entity in the world. The problem about identity, then, is how one 3There are many Buddhas besides Gautama of course. In the original Pali tradition he had six predecessors (Digha Nikaya, ii. 2 ff.). Later, in the Buddhavamsa, he had twenty-four. The Buddhist Sanskrit writers piled on the numbers till finally 'The Buddhas are like the sands on the banks of the Ganges ' (Lalita Vistara 376.5; 402 &amp; elsewhere; see Har Dayal, The Bodhisattva Doctrine, London (1932), pp. 24-25 &amp; notes).</page><page sequence="3">330 R. N. SMART could support the claim that certain human beings are in an intimate fashion manifestations of this dharma-kdya. The third example I am going to consider is the more familiar one of the famous identification, in the Upanisads, of Brahman with the Atman. This is summed up in the text Tattvamasi, 'That art thou '4, i.e. that Brah- man is identical with the Self.5 Here Brahman on the one hand is that mysterious Power lying behind or within the visible world6 and upon which the world depends,7 while the Atman is that antah purusa or inward person,8 beyond that empirical self which has a name and ancestors : it is, that is to say, the inner spiritual entity. Now these dark pronouncements will require some illumination later. But already this much is clear, that the divine object of worship lying beyond the world is somehow identical with something lying within the individual; and so we get such seemingly self- contradictory assertions as this: Than whom there is naught else higher, than whom there is naught smaller, naught greater . . .9 And there is here also an apparent difference in location between the two entities asserted to be one. But whereas in the Christian case only one of the places is analogical, in this example both are. These weird identifications, then, are the ones I am going to discuss, with the object of determining what criteria are used to make them. Since, however, these are rarely made explicit, what I say may seem misleading; but they nevertheless appear to be the inner grounds upon which the identity statements are asserted. I intend to discuss first the Brahman-Atman example as being in some ways the easiest, and then the Christian one. With the results thus obtained it may be possible to give an account of the Mahayana Buddhist example. Incidentally, I shall not discuss the Third Person of the Trinity when considering the Christian example, since the status of the Holy Spirit is rather obscure and I am most unsure as to what to say here. 3. WHY IT IS THAT BRAHMAN AND ATMAN ARE SAID TO BE ONE (i) First, what is the nature of Brahman ? The most important point about It is, I think, Its numinousness. This is clear from the meaning of 4Chandogya Upan. VI.8.7. 5There are differing interpretations of this text; but although the non-dualism of Sankara cannot be a correct interpretation of the whole of the thought of the Upanisads, for the simple reason that it is by no means homogeneous, it undoubtedly represents a strong element therein. And it seems quite impossible to interpret Tattvamasi as merely asserting (as some would want to claim) that the spirit in man is of the same nature as Brahman. 6There are different analogies to illustrate the relation of Brahman to the visible world. Thus it is sometimes said that Brahman is beyond the world, sometimes that it is the essence of things (Brhad. Upan., II.1.20-satyasya satyam) and hence the claim that 'Brahman is all this ' (is the world: Brhad. Upan., 1.4.10-11, etc.). At any rate Brahman is hidden. 7Taittiriya Upan. III.1.1, etc. 8Katha Upan., 11.3.17. 9Svetasvatara Upan., III.9.</page><page sequence="4">THE CRITERIA OF RELIGIOUS IDENTITY 331 the word, which can be rendered as 'sacred energy '. This was a concept applied to the power inherent in magic formulae in the Veda, and was then used more generally of the holy power which sustains the world. A conse- quence of Its being numinous is that It is to be treated with awe and circum- spection, and indeed Brahman appears as an object of worship. This is evident in the more theistic Upanisads, such as the Isa, Katha and Svetds- vatara.10 Here there is a tendency to speak of Brahman in more personal terms, as the Lord (Isvara), and it is characteristic of objects of worship to be described thus. The reason for the more impersonal accounts of Brahman elsewhere will later become apparent. Second, Brahman is the Imperishable, the Eternal Reality behind the shifting world about us. To attain Brahman is thus to gain immortality.11 Third, Brahman is in some sense the cause of the world, since the world evolves out of Brahman.12 These three points about Brahman may be linked together as follows. A numinous entity is mysterious and hidden, for ever apart from the profane. Hence its description as the Other.13 And thus, when the belief in a single numen is developed, the primitive arrangement whereby the holy or sacred object is literally screened from the gaze of the profane is extended cosmically, so that now the visible world itself is regarded as a screen concealing the divine Mystery. Thus the numinous acquires the status of the Reality behind appearances. Second, an entity's holiness is reflected in the sinfulness and profanity of the worshipper. These two points rather naturally generate a doctrine about the origin of the world. For first, the reality behind phenomena is likely to exist when phenomena do not (and indeed in being Other is, unlike things we see, immutable), and consequently to be the sole candidate for being the cause of the visible world's having arisen in the first place; and second, abasement felt by the profane when confronted by the holy is well expressed by the notion of dependence on the latter. We need not then be surprised at the type of answer given to that awful question: 'Why does anything exist at all ? ' Similarly, since the object of awe and worship lies beyond phenomena it is timeless, immortal; and the more so because the worshipper wishes to reduce the width of the gap between himself and the divine : for in coming close to the Holy One he overcomes his fears and thereby attains deathless- ness. Thus Brahman corresponds in large measure to the one object of worship with which we are familiar in the Judaeic religions. But this point requires qualification in that, as we shall see, there is another important element in Brahmanism which affects the way Brahman is described: the concept Brahman is woven together, so to speak, out of concepts in different strands of religious discourse, since It is identified with the Atman, which 10Cp.

Upan., III.2; cp. IV.7, and Mundaka Upan., III.1.2.</page><page sequence="5">332 R. N. SMART in origin has a very different flavour. And the conflation of the concepts of two strands involves the modification of each. (ii) What is the nature of the Atman ? First, as I have said, it is the antah purusa, the inward person beyond even the empirical self. This might be a hard saying and it would be easy to dismiss it as sounding like confused metaphysics-and especially so when it is noticed that Indian theologians from the earliest times have on occasion argued for its existence on philo- sophical grounds that would not appear convincing, namely that there is a metaphysical subject beyond anything that can be introspected in the ordinary way, since when I know myself the first I is itself unknown. But the Atman is essentially a spiritual concept and we must view it in its proper setting, just as we must view the concept God in its proper setting and not in its unfortunate appearances in conclusions of metaphysical arguments. Now the main setting for the notion of the Atman or Self is that of mysticism. By 'mysticism ' here I mean something more precise than is often meant: namely, a method of achieving an inner spiritual goal. On this usage, St. John of the Cross, Eckhart, Gotama Buddha and countless Indian yogis would count as typical examples of mystics, for they have practised a certain sort of physical and mental training during their lives, and the treading of this path has brought them to an inner attainment. There is, of course, obscurity in the word 'inner' here; but its meaning will later become clearer. Now the goal which the mystic attains is, putting it roughly, a state of bliss ; and this is: Not that which knows external objects, not that which knows internal objects, not that which knows both sorts, not a mass of cognition, not cognitive. It is unseen, incapable of being spoken of, without any distinctive marks, unthinkable, unnameable, the essence of the knowledge of the one Self, that into which the world is resolved, the peaceful, the auspicious, the non-dual .. .14 By this is meant : in the mystical state one neither perceives objects around one nor does one visualise any such objects (' internal objects ' here are, in our jargon, mental images). Hence also it is said to be unseen. Its unthink- ability arises from the fact that in mystical meditation one does not think (i.e. cogitate or day-dream) and also from its ineffability. The latter springs from two causes, first its indescribability (i.e. it is not describable the way a dream or a perceptual experience is describable), and second its utter exaltation (it is unspeakable the way gratitude and joy are sometimes unspeakable). And it is non-dual because here there is-to put it in an old- fashioned way, no distinction of subject and object. That is to say, it is not a sort of observation (where you are aware of being in one spot seeing something which is a distinct entity from yourself). (It is true that mystics sometimes speak of seeing God or Brahman, etc.; but this is, briefly, a concession to the mixed nature of their doctrinal systems, for a numinous '4Mandukya Upan., 7 (Radhakrishnan's translation modified).</page><page sequence="6">THE CRITERIA OF RELIGIOUS IDENTITY 333 entity is separated from the worshipper. And, of course, it is no ordinary seeing.) It is now possible to see why this experience of the Self generates a doctrine that this Self is beyond the empirical self. For the mystical state lies outside all ordinary experience (the flow of which constitutes the empirical self): it lies beyond mere seeing or touching or imagining or feeling angry and pleased. The contrast between the Atman and the person does not wither away through the Atman's being beyond all experience whatsoever; just as the idealism commonly associated with mysticism does not wither away through there being nothing to contrast the unreal or impermanent world with : all life is a dream-all life, that is, save the spiritual life. In this respect, spiritual idealism differs from its philosophical counterpart. Again, we can see why the Atman is held to be within. For first, the search to realise the Atman involves a mystical discipline which leads one away from interest in the world about one and more particularly which has as its core meditative practices wherein one banishes unwanted perceptions, visualisations, cogitations, etc., thereby attaining the right spiritual void- ness of mind. A second reason for the picture of the Atman as lying within is that in the mystical experience there is ineffable bliss. Now joy, bliss, remorse, etc., are often in common parlance said to be within one, because (a) the joy, etc., belongs to the experiencer thereof in a way it can belong to no-one else; (b) behaviour, though it reveals feelings, also masks them (hence the model of their lying beyond the surface of the organism) ; (c) they could not in any intelligible sense be said to lie outside the organism. And also, of course, in some cases the having of certain feelings is accompanied by our being aware of events happening which occur literally inside (heart- beats, etc.). But it must be noted that the interiorness of the Atman is deeper than that of mere joy, since it lies beyond, as we have said, certain events like visualisations which are also pictured as occurring within. Further, it must be added that (a) the mystical experience is timeless: hence such peculiar utterances as Vaughan's 'I saw Eternity the other night .15 It is timeless because there is in the mystical state no awareness of time passing (how, under the circumstances, could there be ?), and it has, so to speak, its own time-scale as dreams too have their own. Moreover, the surpassing peace attained banishes all fear of mortality. One has arrived at the immortal.16 And (b) the effect of the divine vision is an establishment of holiness and purity of character; and the behaviour of the mystic betrays a strange power and other-worldliness. (iii) Now we are in a better position to answer the main question, viz., What plausibility is there in the famous identification of Brahman and At- man ? Why should it be asserted that This is my Self within the heart, smaller than a grain of rice, smaller 'From The World. 16Note that this (amata) is one of the epithets of nirvana even in the Pali canon, where there is no concept of a deity.</page><page sequence="7">334 R. N. SMART than a barley corn, than a mustard seed, than a grain of millet or than the kernel of a grain of millet. This is my Self within the heart, greater than the earth, greater than the atmosphere, greater than the sky, greater than these worlds. Containing all works, containing all desires, containing all odours, containing all tastes, encompassing the whole world, without speech, without concern, this is the Self of mine within the heart; this is Brahman ?17 First, we must point to some general facts about spiritual discourse. It appears to be the case that systems of doctrine18 arise from different strands of discourse and in some cases are woven together out of these strands. Thus, propositions about a God are generated out of the numinous strand, i.e. that segment of religious language which expresses awe and abasement before the intimations of divinity in the world, language which has its central place in the activity of worship : the doctrines of early Islam are very largely drawn from this strand, for example. On the other hand, propositions about the attainment of nirvana, about release, about inner bliss, are expressive of mysticism, the practice of which is rather a different sort of spiritual activity from that of worship: Hinayana Buddhist doctrines, for example, are drawn largely from this strand, and the numinous belief in a God is absent. In some cases it turns out-as in the Brahman-Atman instance that a doctrinal scheme contains strong elements of both strands, woven together. Similarly, the logical bases of propositions about an incarnate deity are different from those about a transcendent God, and so we have a third strand. (This way of presenting doctrinal schemes is, of course, very crude and highly schematic, but it can be used, I think, to throw a little light on their structure.) A second general point about religious discourse is this : because it tends to possess a capacity appropriate to the numinous, because one of its chief functions is expression and thus must be loosely moulded to fit the expressive utterance of diverse people, because there is an intrusive ineffability in religion, and because many key religious expres- sions are used in an analogical rather than a literal sense,19 spiritual discourse tends to be somewhat imprecise. This imprecision and analogicality allows of an interweaving between different strands of discourse which would be merely absurd in precise discourse. For on the one hand, imprecision ob- viously leaves room for manoeuvre, and on the other the analogical use of expressions mitigates the paradoxes which we discover and which are con- sequences of the interweaving of the initially disparate. The paradox, for instance, that Brahman is both far and near,20 that it 17Chandogya Upan., III.14.3-4 (Radhakrishnan's translation modified). 18Which I shall henceforth refer to as 'doctrinal schemes', since 'system' suggests a logical rigidity not possessed by doctrines; while 'scheme' aptly suggests com- position. 19By ' analogical 'uses I mean simply non-literal yet untranslateable uses, as opposed to 'metaphorical ' uses, which are non-literal but dispensable. It is of course difficult to draw a sharp line between the two, as it is also hard to draw such a line between the literal and the non-literal. 20Isa Upan. 5, etc.</page><page sequence="8">THE CRITERIA OF RELIGIOUS IDENTITY 335 lies beyond the visible world and yet within the person. How do we justify this saying ? Our general remarks above merely prepare the ground, but give no positive reason for the identity-statement. There exist, however, certain similarities between Brahman and the Self. (a) Both are unseen, imperceptible, veiled: and indeed the picture often generated by the mystical goal, of the world as insubstantial and un- real in comparison with the deathlessness within, fits in also with the model of the divine lying the other side of the visible world. Moreover, to gain the mystical bliss is like travelling to the other shore, crossing over, going beyond (to use a simile popular in Buddhism21). Thus both Brahman and the Atman are 'outside' phenomena. (b) Brahman is immortal and un- shifting; while similarly the mystical experience is timeless and a release from the bonds of mortality. (c) Brahman is holy; but also the mystic's character is (albeit in a secondary sense) holy and it is pure-the attainment of release is regarded often as the source of this unshakeable power of charac- ter ; and thus the mystical state is like the divine in being a source of holiness and salvation (for in the worshipper's religion the object of worship is not only holy but the source of holiness: hence doctrines of grace-for any other ascription of the capacity to uplift the sinner would be presumptuous). (d) Brahman has supreme mystery-value, is, in being the supreme numinous entity, utterly glorious; so too the mystical goal overwhelms the saint in its fulness, and is only palely conveyed by the words summum bonum. (e) Connectedly, both Brahman and the realisation of the Atman are in- effable in some degree (Brahman, since one can never fully express the wonder to be displayed before a Supreme Being and can never adequately express the praise due, the Atman, since the mystical experience is both void of content, so to speak, and unutterably eirenic). Briefly, then, both are imperceptible, transcendent, timeless, liberating, supreme and ineffable. These provide the justifications for weaving together the two concepts (though I do not wish to suggest that having these points explicitly in mind led spiritual teachers such as Yajnavalkya to formulate the identity; and indeed most often such points as I have made can only be made ex post dicto-here the critic of spiritual doctrines and the theologian are in some measure parasites upon revelation). The effect of the identification can be described as follows. (i) The con- cept of deity is a good deal more impersonal than it would be in a doctrinal scheme built largely round the numinous strand. Thus in Sankara's inter- pretation of Brahmanism a distinction is made between the nirgunam and the sagunam Brahman, Brahman, that is, without and with attributes. The latter corresponds to the Creator in Judaeic religions and is similarly described in personal terms, as having a will, as being omnipotent, etc., and as having created the visible world. But the former is largely ineffable and is without those attributes ascribed to the sagunam Brahman-the Isvara or Lord. According to Sankara, the impersonal Absolute is prior, and the 2lSamyutta Nikaya, 360 ff., etc.</page><page sequence="9">336 R. N. SMART Lord is infected, as is the world, by illusion. The picture of God as Isvara is not the highest truth. For this distinction compare the similar one made by Eckhart between Godhead and God (Deitas and Deus).22 We may note that the mystical aspect of Brahman is described very much ontologically (for ontological terms play a central part in much mystical discourse).23 (ii) The creation of the world is less 'contingent' in the Upanisads than it is in the monotheistic religions of the West, where the existence of the world is due to a clear-cut divine decision controlled by a general purpose. The impression of necessity, of logical evolution, in cosmic events is more characteristic of the mystically-minded.24 (iii) As the divine becomes more like the mystical entity, so the Self becomes more divine : thus, the Atman is regarded as the World Soul. So much then for the first example. 4. WHY ARE CHRIST AND THE FATHER DECLARED TO BE ONE ? This example is a harder one, in that many of the statements about Christ which appear inconsistent with statements about the Father with Whom He is held to be one, are not analogical. First, some remarks on what I term the incarnation strand of spiritual discourse. An incarnate deity is in some respects merely a limiting case of the saintly prophet : that is, he possesses in a pre-eminent degree two gifts found in lesser degree elsewhere, namely (i) that holiness we also expect to see in the saint's life; and (ii) the spiritual wisdom with which the prophet or religious teacher is endowed. Regarding the former, it tends to include not merely strength and depth of character born of religious experience, but also marvellous powers associated therewith, the capacity to work miracles. However, these characteristics are hardly sufficient by themselves to establish a claim to be identical with God; at any rate where the require- ments for such an identification are at all stringent. For, of course, religions vary in the number of incarnations which they allow. In Mahayana Budd- hism as we have seen there are many Buddhas and in Vaisnavite Hinduism there are many avatdras of Visnu; while Christianity cleaves fast to the principle that there should be but one such incarnation. This principle may be defended on the grounds of simplicity and propriety-for on the one hand, though the doctrinal scheme containing the incarnation strand is more complex than that which is strictly unitarian, like Islam, the case of a unique incarnation is, so to speak, the spiritually most elegant; while on the other hand, the wrench that has to be made in allowing that anyone of human form should be one with the Supreme Being causes less offence at the seeming blasnhemv if but one incarnation is allowed- However. it is 22See R. Otto's fine comparison between Eckhart and Sankara in Mysticism East and West, Eng. Trans., London (1932). 23I have attempted to give an account of the reasons for this in an article Being and the Bible, Review of Metaphysics, June 1956. 24This is connected with the ontologism referred to above, but it would take us too far afield to give the full reasons for the mystical liking for cosmic necessity.</page><page sequence="10">THE CRITERIA OF RELIGIOUS IDENTITY 337 not in place here to press any defence or attack of the principle; but to point out the consequences flowing from its application. Briefly, they amount to this: that the emphasis placed upon one human being's life requires that very special attention be paid to the historical circumstances of that career. To this we shall return after making a further preliminary point. One of the principles of spiritual reasoning (if we may call it such), is that, as we have mentioned in another connection, saving power flows from the divine (for it is a fitting expression of the wonder and marvellousness of That which is numinous to ascribe thereto the power to release the wor- shipper from his reflected sinfulness). Now, it would not seem unlikely that a candidate for divinity25 should also have to possess this power. This can be displayed in two main ways-first, by saving teaching (together with conduct illustrating that teaching)-as in the case of the historical Buddha as according, e.g., to the Lotus Sutra,26 and as in the case of Christ as in the exemplarist interpretation of, say, Abelard; or more mysteriously, for instance, through providing an adequate expiation for the sins of mankind (as according to the so-called 'objective' theory of Anselm). And this latter inasmuch as the appropriate response on the part of sinful man to the holiness of the divine is abasement and contrition. Now the expression of such abasement linguistically (as also often with, say, gratitude) appears most inadequate: more is required, namely a gesture. Nevertheless the supreme exaltedness of the Godhead in a monotheistic and morally con- ditioned faith27 is such that even although the concept of expiatory gestures is extended to daily conduct, so that: The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit. . . . Then shalt Thou be pleased with the sacrifices of righteousness, with burnt offering and whole burnt offering.28 yet the enormous yawning gap between the divine and the human remains intolerable, despite these gestures. On the Christian view the gap can only be closed by God: only He can perform a sufficient gesture-through His sacrificing Himself (again, in an extended sense of 'sacrifice '). But of course a gesture is of no value for the human race unless it is made on its behalf: unless the performer thereof is identified with the human race. Hence the point upon which Christianity is centrally based : the gap between God and man can only be made tolerable for man by an adequate sacrifice, and this can only be performed by God in a state of solidarity with man. This, it is held, is done by Christ, being both God and man, in his self-sacrifice on the Cross. 26' Candidate ' is not here meant irreverently, nor in the normal adoptionist sense. But an incarnate Deity has to be judged by us to be such, in accordance with some criteria. This is so to speak 'logical adoptionism', and does not imply that if anyone is correctly identified with the Father he was not with the Father from the beginning. 26Saddharmapundarika, 136.4. 270ne, i.e., where moral beliefs have affected doctrines. 28Ps. 51, vs. 17,19.</page><page sequence="11">338 R. N. SMART But this raises the point that the saving of mankind (i.e. making the gap tolerable and providing the possibility of salvation for those who have faith in Christ) can only be thought plausibly to have occurred at a suitable juncture of history, and it is mainly hence that springs the importance of the historical facts both of the incarnate human's career and of the previous setting thereof. Do they present a convincing pattern ? We may now sum up the grounds for counting Christ as identical with the Father. To be divine (if this is allowed about any human) the candidate ought to be similar to the Creator in certain respects and can be so in the following ways. (i) In being morally pure and so sinless, unlike the ordinary wor- shipper; (ii) in displaying power of character and the capacity to perform miracles : these are intimations of omnipotence (a special case is the Resur- rection, which as well as being supremely wondrous, also has a doctrinal setting as being a demonstration that man is freed from death); (iii) in possessing deep spiritual knowledge and the power to convey this : here are intimations of omniscience; (iv) in having the power to save, first as under (iii) through the teaching and the conduct illuminating it, but second per- formatively, for instance in constituting an adequate expiatory sacrifice which will make the gap between man and God tolerable. It is to be noted too that all these points must be fitted together into a convincing pattern of divine conduct set in an appropriate historical environment. The consequences of the identification are that Christ is now considered the Logos and so having creative powers; and as sitting on the right hand of the Father and so dwelling in that divine place beyond the world that well expresses the otherness of the numinous. But the Father's nature too undergoes a change, so to speak : it is seen that God is Love, etc. 5. ON THE TRI-KAYA DOCTRINE In the Buddhist examples we meet elements which we have already examined. First, the historical Buddha possesses some of the marks of an incarnate deity (though it may be mentioned that in the Pali Canon, where there is of course no Tri-Kdya doctrine, since the Hinayana, like early Buddhism, is agnostic-there is little distinction between the arhat or saint (one who achieves nibbdna) and the Buddha, except that the latter is the originator of the Path).29 (i) Gautama was possessed of something close to omniscience ;30 (ii) he was free from error and full of compassion (karund)- thus being morally perfect ;31 (iii) he taught men the road to salvation and founded an order and so is in one respect (though not performatively) a saviour ;32 (iv) he had wondrous powers.33 So in these respects he has affin- 29See E.

However, even in Mahayana the numinous other-worldly beings have a restricted function, for in Budd- hism there is no ordinary doctrine of creation. For the question whether the world was eternal or not (i.e. whether it was created or not) was pro- nounced by the Buddha to be an undetermined question.34 On the other hand, there was a doctrine of a sort of evolution of phenomena from an original Reality: for instance, the latter is described (by the Vijnidnvadin school) as the alaya-vijnana or store-consciousness, for the world is nothing but mind (cittamdtra). But an apparent world arises through transformation of this original consciousness into individual minds, a move which causes individuals to conceive of the external world as really existing.35 However, the more obviously numinous entities in the Mahayana are such Buddhas as Amitabha and such Bodhisattvas as Avalokitesvara. Amitabha, for instance, is the object of worship and devotion for countless adherents, and dwells in another world, his famous Pure Land in the West which gave its name to the Pure Land sects. This land was in effect created by him, being his Buddha-ksetra or Buddha-field-it being a belief that Buddhas are capable of such creative activity36 (it is of course limited, in that no Buddha created the whole universe). Hence, the weaving together of the concept appearing in his nirmana-kaya upon earth with that of a celestial lord to be addressed with words of praise and petition is not dissimilar to that occurring in the Christian example-with two modifications : (i) the capacity to save performatively is reserved, for historical reasons, for the Bodhisattvas, who by putting off their nirvana use the merit acquired hitherto in coming close to this final tranquillity to raise up the sinners who have no merit (thus we have the story in the Lotus Sutra of the famous Bodhisattva Avalokitesvara who undergoes the direst afflictions and the most strenuous labours and who uses the merit so acquired on behalf of others out of deep compassion for them : he is a divine example of compassion and humility for the edifica- tion of the faithful) ; (ii) there are countless Buddhas, so far as the sambhoga- kdya and the nirmdna-kdya are concerned-though they are ultimately all one in their dharma-kdya. And this last point reminds us that the dharma- kaya or Absolute is held to be the ultimate basis for the other two bodies. This is very similar in part to the two-aspect doctrine of Sankara. For the personal deity is held to be posterior to the impersonal Absolute lying behind. This expresses in effect two things, first that the blending of mystical and numinous discourse is not perfect (how indeed could it be expected to be ?), so that the more anthropomorphic characteristics of the Godhead may be detached, so to speak, and regarded as a separate aspect thereof. And second, it expresses a priority decision, that in substance one kind of spiritual activity is superior to another, that the mystical path is more important than worship. Compare with this the rather different arrangement in the 34Majjh. Nik. 1.157, etc. 35E. J. Thomas, op. cit., pp. 241 ff. 36See. e.g., Sukhavati Vyuha, Sacred Books of the East, xlix, p. 15 ff.</page><page sequence="13">340 R. N. SMART Bhagavad- Gitd, where attaining Brahman is coming close to God, but yet remaining apart from him.37 And indeed it is this priority decision as ex- pressed doctrinally that allows the most extravagantly evangelistic forms of Buddhism, such as the Amida-Buddhism of the Judo sect, to stay within the fold. For even if the sambhoga-kdya of Amida Buddha is regarded in certain sects as revealing something essential to the Buddha-nature, yet the idealistic and mystical structure of doctrine remains. But it needs to be pointed out that the doctrine of an Absolute, as we saw in the Brahman-Atman example, is not a purely mystical one: it is already some of the distance towards a numinous doctrine; and it is by no means fortuitous that the evolution of Buddhist idealism by the Mad- hyamika and Yogacara Schools coincided with the revulsion of ordinary adherents away from the pure and austerely mystical teachings of the early religion. For it paved the way, through the notion of an eternal, unchange- able, pure, all-pervading, undifferentiated reality, for the appending thereto the concept of personal beings whom one could worship and to whom one might pray-a concept spun forth from the intimations of the numinous among ordinary folk. For the properties ascribed to the dharma-kdya are reminiscent of those ascribed to numinous entities: Buddhas also are im- mortal, unchanging, pure and beyond our immediate range of vision. And there is the further point that the non-dual nature of the mystical experience leads to language such as this : that one becomes Brahman, one is united with God, etc.; so the Buddhas through their Enlightenment become the dharma-kdya. Also, of course, in so becoming they lose their individuality -all Buddhas are in reality but one.38 6. TENSIONS WITHIN THE IDENTITIES It is, however, clear that though there are grounds for the sorts of identity- statements we have been here considering, there remain conflicts neverthe- less. For first, differing strands of discourse, having different flavours and different epistemological bases, are being woven together; and each possesses unaccommodated segments. For example, though it is appropriate to worship Christ since it is appropriate to worship the Father, and though Christ too is Creator of the world, not all propositions are such that references to the Father may be indifferently replaced by references to the Son. Thus there is a continual element of paradox in such complex doctrinal schemes. Second, there is a specific spiritual conflict between the numinous and the mystical strand, which can be illustrated as follows: the mystical goal is non-dual-the mystic would wish if allowed to say that he becomes united with God or Allah or Brahman, since he has been in a state where there is no distinction between subject and object.39 But on the other hand dualism 37See F. Edgerton, The Bhagavad-Gita translated and interpreted, Cambridge (Mass. 1952), p. 49; and see Bhag. Gita, xiv.27, etc. 38Mahayana Sutralankara, 18.11. 39Kena Upan., i.4.10.</page><page sequence="14">THE CRITERIA OF RELIGIOUS IDENTITY 341 between God and man is of the very essence of numinous discourse. It is the Other that we worship. God is pure where man is sinful, exalted where he is abased, screened, immortal, invisible. Consequently, the history of mysticism within the theistic religions has not always been happy; and there have been serious conflicts, especially in the Christian Church, between mystics such as Eckhart and the upholders of orthodoxy. Moreover, the immediate vision vouchsafed to the mystic tends to persuade him that he has found the highest truth lying beyond doctrinal formulae and so to ride loosely by the revealed truths that have had conferred upon them some of the sacred immutability of their Author. Third, there is some conflict be- tween the numinous and incarnation strands since it does not seem to every- one in consonance with the terrible majesty of the Supreme Being that any human should be identical with him. It is prima facie a great blasphemy. Finally, there is the general point that the identifications depend upon perceiving certain similarities ; but these similarities would not, it seems, be sufficient in another sort of context to justify identity statements. The weaving together of concepts is undoubtedly loose, though sometimes the pattern produced seems to fit nicely. But whether the identifications are allowable or not is a hard question. We may say that certain doctrinal pictures have a good composition and we may back our judgment by pointing to analogies between parts that make them hang together and may appeal to certain spiritual principles here and there. Even so, some may think that doctrinal schemes are over-poetical. Are we to be like those who declare that no bullfinch is purple, let alone in a lilac-tree ? Or are we to follow Aristotle in reckoning it to be the mark of an educated man to seek that degree of precision which the subject-matter allows ? R. N.
