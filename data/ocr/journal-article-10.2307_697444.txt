Turin, Milan, etc.: Paravia. 1928. Paper, 20 lire. THERE can be no doubt that Frazer's Fasti is the most important full edition of a Latin classic published in England since the war. An edition of the Fasti, in which the subject-matter might be con- sidered in the light of the modern study of anthropology and comparative religion, has long been wanted, and from no editor could it have been more welcome than from Sir James. He has attacked his task with all his wonted vigour and thoroughness of method, and it pro- vides scope for his scholarship and his archaeology as well as for his wide- flung knowledge of anthropology. If a critic must criticise, he may say firmly at the outset that the greatly prepon- derating feeling is one of admiration and gratitude. The plan of the work is simple: Vol. I. contains a short introduction on</page><page sequence="2">236 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW MSS., editions, and authorities, the text with critical apparatus, and a translation; Vols. II., III., and IV. are occupied with the commentary, each containing two books; Vol. V. contains indices, illustrations, and plans. It is interesting to compare Sir James's text with that of C. Landi published in the Paravia series a few months earlier. The latter follows in the tradition of recent texts and bears a strong family resemblance to the Ehwald-Levy Teubner text of 1924, to which the editor handsomely acknow- ledges his debt. Mr. Landi has availed himself of recent recensions of the more important MSS. and has himself done much work in collation. He holds to the belief in the supremacy of A (Petavianus), but is inclined to attach more importance than earlier editors to U (Ursinianus); D (Mallers- dorfiensis) be believes to be a much interpolated school-text. Useful read- ings are also to be found in other early texts, both Transalpine and Italian, of which Mr. Landi has examined large numbers. On the vexed question of the relation of the Gemblacensis and Mazarinianus and the citations in Lac- tantius Mr. Landi follows the view of E. H. Alton (Herinathena XLIV, 1926) and thinks that they may all go back to a less corrupted archetype. The text constructed on this basis is an attempt to follow the indications of modern criticism without slavish ad- herence, and is on the whole sound. A few of the editor's own emendations are introduced, but are not convincing. In II. 669 invictus for inventus AUDM is gratuitous; in IV. 709 degere captaam would explain the variants uiuere U and dicere A, but in spite of the parallels quoted it is awkward Latin; in II. 638 sub sacra verba seems no better than the many other suggested emendations; in VI. 757 the text has Lachesis Clymen- usque, which comes from Levy's note, but in the apparatus we find Lachesis Climemesque (sic), of which I can make nothing. Not the least valuable part of the edition is the full list of authorities in the introduction (pp. xxxiii-xxxix), and in particular the bibliography of articles on special festivals and deities of the Roman religion. Sir James Frazer's attitude to the text is, as might be expected, indepen- dent and original. Having procured rotagraphs of the six principal MSS., A, U, D, X (Gemblacensis), M (Mazarin- ianus), and m (Oxoniensis), he has based his recension on his own reading of them and, as he tells us (I. xxvi.), has only on rare occasions been obliged to go outside of them. He is fully cog- nizant of the work of previous editors and critics, but has taken his own line. The result is what may fairly be de- scribed as an eclectic text with a hardly concealed leaning towards U (see the note on III. 462), except-oddly enough -after V. 24, where A ceases, when U is apt to be supplanted in Sir James's preference by D. I have not space to deal fully with the resulting text, but certain salient points may be noticed. In several places Sir James has in my view suc- cessfully vindicated the MS. text: e.g. I. 148 fauca AUDM as against many conjectures designed to make the phrase consistent with multis in 161; I. 387 triplici ADM against the geminae usually adopted from the inferior MSS., triflici being due to the same confusion of Diana with the'triple' Hecate already made by Ovid in I. 141. Among the passages where U is preferred to A may be noted III. 219 passis (scissis A) capillis, which a valuable note on the respective significance of dishevelled and torn hair shows to be right. Simi- larly in III. 462 a common-sense note proves U's legenda against A's regenda. In IV. 295 I am convinced by the note that nataeque (D) nurusque (U) is right as against the generally accepted natique (AUXM) virique (ADXM). In the last two books, after A stops, may be noted the restoration (VI. 582) of ducis (UDXMm) as against the traditional senis, which Frazer states has no MS. authority. But this general belief in U does not prevent Sir James from deserting both it and A when he thinks he can get better sense from the inferior MSS. It appears to me that he has so im- proved the traditional text in many places: e.g. II. 93 urbes (DXm2) is far</page><page sequence="3">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 237 better sense than undas (AUMml); IV. 45 recidiva (Dml) is a much stronger reading than repetita (AUXMm2) (and it is incidentally supported by Virgil's recidiva Pergama in Aen. IV. 344); IV. 724 festa (Xm') is an attrac- tive change from Jacta (AUDMm2); V. 427 somno ... praebet (DXMm') has really the weight of authority against somnos . . praebent (Um2). But in several places the editor seems less happy in throwing over the higher authority of A and U. I. 210 summos . . . deos is not justified by the parallels quoted in the commentary; IV. 709 dicere certa is not, as stated in the note, the 'text of the great majority of MSS.,' which have dicere certam, and, while certa is feeble, dicere is question- able in the sense of 'to name'; in IV. 755 the subjunctive degrandinet (D) is unnecessary, the indicative being idiomatic in this sense (cf. Virg. Ecl. IX. 23), and in VI. 434 erituisset is definitely bad grammar-there is no reason for a subjunctive-and earn very weak; in V. 335 it is true that tota (UDXMm) is feeble, but pota (one MS. and Heinsius) tempora in the sense of ebriorum tempora is surely impos- sible. The editor does not print any con- jectures of his own in the text, but makes several suggestions in the critical notes, which are all interesting, but none to my mind convincing. In II. 575 a desire for ritual consistency with passages in other authors has prompted tria for cum; secessit for recessit in V. 12 is an unfortunate sug- gestion; medium . . locum for sedem . . . suam in VI. 268 is much too re- mote; in VI. 4or hic would no doubt be an improvement on hoc, but tremuere (UXm2) is strained even in Ovid; the suggestions on IV. 441 multi et, V. 21 texit, and VI. 75 nomine all appear to me gratuitous. A few small blemishes may also be noted: in IV. 451 and VI. 598 the critical notes do not correspond to the text, the rejected reading being placed first; in II. 533 the translation quoted in the commentary (Vol. II., p. 431) does not correspond to the translation in Vol. I. or to the text (extinctas); and in VI. 652 there is an odd misprint in the critical apparatus, flavae ravae for flava . . . rava. The translation, which faces the text in Vol. I., gives an adequate interpre- tation of the meaning, but can hardly be regarded as a finally satisfactory English rendering. Ovid no doubt presents special difficulties to the translator; he is at times prosily archaeological or argumentative, at times genuinely poetical, and again mock-heroic and slyly cynical. Yet the Fasti does give the impression of a uniform style, and Sir James's at- tempt to represent the differing moods produces a patchy effect: his jumps are too sudden, his lapses into the colloquial or prosaic diction too marked. The following passage from the story of Arion (II. III ff.) may be taken as characteristic : 'Straightway, with all his finery on, he leaped plump down into the waves: the refluent water splashed the azure poop. Thereupon they say (it sounds past credence) a dolphin did submit his arched back to the unusual weight; seated there Arion grasped his lyre and paid his fare in song, and with his chant he charmed the ocean waves.' There are many brilliant renderings of individual phrases: e.g. IV. 554 'the burden of humanity' (humanum onus), V. 333 'strait-laced' (severum), V. 351 'high-flown' (magna professis), VI. og9 'to scour the countryside' (rura sequi). Opinions may differ on the 'billy-goat' of I. 354 and the 'nanny-goats' of IV. 511. The use of words or phrases with strong modern associations also raises questions: ' All Souls' Days' is perhaps a legitimate equivalent for Parentales dies (II. 548), but 'parish,' which represents pagus in I. 669 and vicus in V. 146, has too definite a tinge, and so have'the Prime Warden' (curio II. 527) and 'colonel' (tribunus IV. 381). In a few places the accuracy of the translation may be questioned. In I. 322 'Shall I proceed?' loses the ritual force of agone; in I. 598 virtus is not 'goodness' but 'prowess'; in I. 649 rebus not 'life' but ' fortune'; in III. 97 hos omnes ut vinceret ordine does not mean 'that he might take precedence of all these,' but 'that he</page><page sequence="4">238 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW might do better in the ordering of the year'; and neither in III. 623 nor anywhere else can nil non mean 'something.' If the translation leaves one with a feeling of slight disappointment, it is because in spite of many lumina ingenii, it seems a little lacking in ars. To the great majority of readers the main interest of Sir James Frazer's edition will lie in the three volumes of the Commentary. It is perhaps to be regretted that these notes were originally designed to accompany a volume in the Loeb series and are therefore written not on the Latin text, but on the English translation. The result is that discussion of points of text or scholar- ship has little place in them, and when it does occur, it is made somewhat clumsy by the necessity of adapting it to the English reader. But of every other kind of comment on history, on archaeology and art, on religion, folk- lore and anthropology there is an un- stinted wealth: only in the field of astronomy the editor does not trust himself and takes his lead from Ideler's still valuable disquisition Uber den astronomischen Theil der Fasti des Ovid (Berlin, 1825). Of the accuracy of the many fascin- ating archaeological notes on architec- ture, sculpture, coins and topography I am not qualified to speak, but there can be no doubt that taken together with the admirable photographs and plans in Volume V. they add greatly to the reality and vitality of a reading of the Fasti and not infrequently clear up points of obscurity in the text. As instances may be quoted the illumin- ating note on the successive Temples of Concord (on I. 637), a valuable discus- sion of Laurentum and Lavinium (on II. 679), a long discussion of the Temple of Vesta (on VI. 257), and as an example of a topographical exposition on an obscure point the note on the Nova Via on VI. 395. It is in notes like these that we feel the editor of Pausanias among us again. The main bulk of the 1,286 pages of commentary is occupied with the dis- cussion and explanation of Roman customs and of the rites and concep- tions of Roman religion. Many new and valuable suggestions are made and almost every point is illustrated from Sir James's great anthropological store- house, examples being taken from peoples in all parts of the world and in almost every stage of cultural develop- ment. We meet the Esquimaux, the Maoris, the tribes of Borneo, the Ban- yankole and Banyoro of Uganda, the Germany of Tacitus and the Germany of yesterday. The validity of all this wealth of illustration depends of course on the ultimate postulate of Sir James's anthropology, that 'human nature is much the same all the world over and in all ages' (Vol. II., p. 431). A more sceptical mind finds itself here, as in the reading of The Golden Bough, inclined to urge firstly, that known racial kinship greatly increases the probability of similarity of motive in action, and that there is therefore greater likelihood in the explanation of the Romans by the Greeks, or the Banyoro by the Banyan- kole, than there is in that of the Greeks by the Banyoro; and secondly, that, except in matters of simple and primi- tive custom of known universality, it is dangerous to argue from resemblance of practice to similarity of motive, unless we can be very sure of the similarity of circumstances and thought. Thus on the one hand one feels confidence in the illustration of the Parilia by the rites observed in Eastern Europe on St. George's Day, because, as Sir James himself says (Vol. III., p. 339), 'they may well be connected by descent from a common festival observed by pastoral Aryan peoples in the spring.' Or again Sir James's theory that a blank winter period in the agricultural year is the true explanation of the old ten-month calendar receives strong support from the cus- toms of certain primitive tribes in Africa and elsewhere (Vol. II., pp. 16 ff.), because we are dealing with circum- stances which are necessarily the same ' all the world over.' But on the other hand it is difficult to feel that the ritual of re-birth from a goat practised by the Kikuyu of Mont Kenya (Vol. II., pp. 341 ff.) helps in any real degree towards the understanding of the Luper- calia, for the circumstances are too unlike, and the coincidence that this 'goat-birth' took place under a fig-tree</page><page sequence="5">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 239 (p. 343) cannot seriously be thought to throw light on the caprificus under which Romulus and Remus were suckled by the wolf. No doubt Sir James would be the first to recognise varying degrees of relevance in his anthropological parallels, and would not be surprised if his readers feel some of them far- fetched, such as the suggestion of totemism and exogamy in the myths of Lycaon and Callisto (Vol. II., p. 319), or of the origin of the chastity of the Vestal Virgins in a sex interpretation of the fire- drill held by the Loango of Western Africa and the Djakuns of the Malay Peninsula (Vol. IV., pp. 208, 9). And even if we accept the view of the fundamental similarity of mankind, there is yet a corollary which the anthropologist is apt to overlook-- namely, that every people, whatever its starting-point, has its own psycho- logy and its own characteristic develop- ment. If there is one general com- plaint which might be brought against Sir James's commentary, it is that it does not sufficiently recognise the essential character of the Roman re- ligion or distinguish between its various stages of development. The Roman religion as embodied in the Calendars, the religion of Numa, was an animism, retaining traces of more primitive magical rites, and in process of develop- ment into anthropomorphism: some of the 'spirits' had attained names and something of personality, but the characteristic title is numen and not deus. Sir James, still unrepentant since his earlier days, speaks consistently of the Roman religion as if it were a full- blown anthropomorphism. The word numen does not occur in the index to the Commentary, nor, to the best of my belief, is it anywhere mentioned in the notes, and in II. 642, when Ovid uses it of Terminus in just the old Roman sense-tu quoque numen habes-it is translated 'thou too hast been deified.' In a similar spirit the Roman deities are throughout spoken of as 'gods' in as complete a sense as the Greek gods, and the typically Roman divinity-pairs, representing the male and female prin- ciple, are described as husband and wife or brother and sister (Vol. II., pp. 208, 367; Vol. III., p. 121I). So Saturnus is regarded as an immigrant foreign deity (Vol. II., p. 122), an idea that could not have existed till after his identification with Kronos; Liber is spoken of as 'the Latin equivalent ot Dionysus' (Vol. II., p. 146), which he cer- tainly was not in origin; and we are told that the Genius 'was, properly speak- ing, a man's guardian god' (Vol. II., p. 438). These are all ideas expressed no doubt in Latin writers, but dating from the period after the influx of Greek anthropomorphism and not typical of the true Roman religion. Again, a student of Roman religion will some- times find Sir James's notes inadequate on points of great interest in themselves, but not suggesting anthropological parallels: he is apt to be content to recite the later legends without attempt- ing to penetrate behind them; one might cite the notes on Tarpeia (Vol. II., p. 128), Hercules and the Ara Maxima (Vol. II., pp. 213 ff.), Castor and Pollux (Vol. II., pp. 261 ff.), Minerva (Vol. III., p. 146) and the Lacus Curtius (Vol. IV., p. 243 ff.). Nor is this want of sympathy with the Roman attitude of mind merely a regrettable lack, but it sometimes vitiates the writer's argument on im- portant points. Thus in a long and important note on Janus (Vol. II., pp. 90go ff.) Sir James argues powerfully against the connexion of the name with ianua and in favour of an original Dianus. This may be a tenable posi- tion, but it can hardly be supported by the argument (p. 92) that 'a god who figured so constantly and so conspicu- ously in litanies and ritual was an im- portant divinity, and it would be strange if a mere janitor or hall-porter among the gods had been promoted to this proud position.' Possibly, if we think of him as a developed god; but in the early Italian hut the 'spirit' of the door, its most vulnerable point, is at least as important as the spirits of the hearth (Vesta) and the store-cupboard (Penates), and it is not at all strange that in the family litany, on which that of the State was based, he should come first and Vesta last. Or again, in his note on Fortuna Primigenia (Vol. III., pp. 257 ff.) Sir James simply sweeps away the objections raised by Mr.</page><page sequence="6">240 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW Warde Fowler and Professor Rose to the belief that she was from the first the 'first-born daughter' of Jupiter, because he does not contemplate the numen period at all or realise the ultimate grounds of objection to conceiving family relationships among divinities in the old Roman religion. But these are the whinings of the specialist, and indeed such weak spots make a very small show amid the mass of valuable material and criticism which Sir James has given us. The book is full of new suggestions, many of which show a freshness of outlook which the specialist too often lacks, and will need careful weighing and consideration. Possibly the most important of these are contained in the long and valuable note (Vol. IV., pp. 74 ff.) on the much disputed ceremony of the Argeorum sacra, where in my opinion Sir James disposes of the Mannhardt theory, which has lately held the ground in England, that the puppets represent the dying spirit of vegetation, on the grounds that the date (May 15) is late, that there is no suggestion of a vegeta- tion rite in the ceremony, that the puppets are made of rushes, not straw, and that the ritual was conducted by the Vestals, who have no other trace of connexion with vegetation. He pro- pounds two alternative theories, both new, that the ceremony was an expulsion of ghosts (Argei-the 'white' people), and that it was an offering for the safety of the Pons Sublicius. Both of these views will have to be examined care- fully. The former is connected with his general view of the attitude of the Romans towards the dead, which is ex- pounded in equally valuable and sugges- tive notes on the Lares and the Com- pitalia (Vol. II., pp. 453 ff., cf. p. 479; and Vol. III., pp. 14 ff. on Acca Larentia, the Mother of the Lares), where he strongly supports the view that the Lares were the spirits of the dead: there is much new material here for the reconsideration of an old contro- versy. Not less important is the sug- gestion of the possible connexion of the Nonae Caprotinae as a ceremony of 'caprification' with the Lupercalia (Vol. II., pp. 347 ff.) and with the Poplifugia and death of Romulus (pp. 415 ff.), though here a first impres- sion is that the ground is less secure. There are many other passages in the commentary to which attention might be drawn, and indeed there are very few of the notes on points of custom and religion which are not suggestive. To any student of Roman religion these volumes must for the future be a store- house of material, all the more valuable for the wide sweep from which its illus- trations are drawn, and a fountain-head of new views, many of which are likely to be accepted. The achievement is one which could have been accomplished by no one but Sir James Frazer. It remains to note that Volume V. contains two valuable indices to the translation and the commentary besides the excellent plates and plans to which reference has already been made. It is to be regretted that there are no re- ferences to the plates embodied in the commentary, but they follow very nearly the sequence of subjects in the notes, and a reader who has the plates open before him will have no difficulty in finding the pictures he needs. The volumes are beautifully printed and got up in the manner which Messrs. Mac- millan have led us to expect, and mis- prints are very rare, the most noticeable being a strange occasional absence of full-stops in the Latin text. CYRIL BAILEY.
