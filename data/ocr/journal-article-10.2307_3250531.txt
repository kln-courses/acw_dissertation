There seems to be aslip in 'the date ofassimilation of this culture into Saiva theme'. (a) "By the mid sixth century the early auspieces Uttanapad, 'pot-Goddess' in a new anthropomorphic form, seems to have become identified as a Sakti of Siva" (p. 40, contra see p. 48). "There is no doubt that at least by the fourth century Lajja Gauri had become accepted into the Hindu Pantheon as a Sakti of Siva." There is a gap of two centuries between these two dates. Perhaps it is a slip. (8.) That Kartikeya carries a trident in his hand is not irreconcilable (p. 46). It is in fact the earlier form of Sakti, and Kartikeya is Saktidhara. In the South Indian context two tridents, one inverted and joined, are called Sakti in later times. These are some of the questions that I would like to raise for purpose of clarity. But I must hasten to add that all my comments are peripheral in nature and this is a masterly treatise, the main thrust of which is unassailable. I am extremely happy to record that this book is absolutely scholarly and will remain a standard reference text on the subject. R.

Project for Indian Cultural Studies, III, Bombay, Ip99, 252 pp., site plan, Io + 26drawings, and 24 + 2II colour and black-and-white photographs. In ca. A.D. Io64, Queen Udayamati of the Solanki dynasty of Gujarat, in western India, ordered that a giant step-well be built near the great Sahasralifiga reservoir in Anahillapataka (Anhilwad-Patan) to memorialize the death of her husband Bhimadeva. During its construction, the scale of the project required structural compromises such as bolstering cross-bridges and buttressing walls, and within two centuries of its completion a great flood of its neighboring Sarasvati river had silted in this remarkable example of India's royal water-architecture. Of seven, only the upper three storeys of this "Ranki Vav" ("the Queen's Stepwell") remained visible above the silt and stagnant pond. These exposed portions, over the centuries, were subject both to incessant weathering as well as to plunder.I The many hundreds of sculptures of its lower four storeys, however, had been returned by nature to a watery grave within India's rich alluvial soil. There they remained safe even from the Islamic forces who took power in the region by ca. A.D. I3oo00. From this womb they only recently have been reborn - still remarkably intact - under the supervision of a team of excavators from the Archaeological Survey of India.2 Over the past decade, Mr. Michel Postel of Franco- Indian Research Pvt. Ltd., Bombay, has substantially promoted and encouraged scholarship on the art of India through a series of publications under the auspices of the "Project for Indian Cultural Studies." Two previous publications, on Antiquities of Hizmachal and Ear Ornaments of A ncient India, have preceded the present one. Each of these monographs has been lavishly produced at Bombay's leading art-printers, Vakil &amp; Sons, Ltd., using a large double-columned format with interspersed color and black-and-white plates. The entirety of each volume has been printed on art paper. No other scholarly monographs in India can compare with this high quality of production and few art books in the world exceed them in level of scholarly conviction. It is a credit to India that a project of such high seriousness has been so successfully initiated in the private sector. If Queen Udayamati's great act of patronage was forever memorialized by her enormous stepwell, so also has Mr. Postel's in this series of publications. A cosmology rooted in water has informed most monumental architecture in India, seeing the source of fertility and parturition first on earth rather than in the heavens. In so agriculturally oriented a world, it should be no surprise to us that the major structures were made that gave access to water or that, as "negative" architecture, these excavations were given a monu- mental frame. Tanks and wells have survived from a very early period in India and continued to be built - still as symbolic as much as functional monuments - after the coming of Islam to India. Perhaps the most famous and widely visited stepwells in the Ahmedabad area, in fact, were built under Islamic patronage.3 No other structure, however, can match the impact of Udayamati's stepwell at Patan. Its seven storeys were originally lined by over 500 images, making one's descent toward water an entry into the cosmos unequalled by any other Indian monument (and the flooding and reflooding cycles of water a cycle of cosmic birth and rebirth). The first stage of this descent was marked by images of the Regents of the Quarters and their consorts. A 496</page><page sequence="2">ARTIBUS ASIAE LIII, 3/4 (I993), BOOK REVIEWS series of steps, corridors, and three stages with stacked pavilions lead to a circular well-shaft. This had three lower levels of images that, on axis, show Visnu reclining on Sesa, the snake representing cosmic water. As the actual water level rose and declined, therefore, one or the other of these images would have always faced the officiant. In rings around each level of the well-shaft, images of nagas (snake deities), Vasus (bovine-headed figures born of the river Gafiga), Dikpalas (Guardians of the Quarters), Saptamatrkas (Seven Mothers), twelve Gauris (who were "the center of a cult exclusive to women," p. 90), and other protecting divinities. Along the walls of the entering corridors and pavilions was a wide pantheon of deities, including the Great Goddess; Visnu's ten avataras; the trinity of Visnu, Brahma, and Siva; and a variety of Saivite deities that included images of Parvati performing penance for which the author, Kirit Mankodi, proposes a particular explanation (p. 235): perhaps they are not merely some amongst the hundreds of sculptures which decorate the monument, but the goddess separated by death from her consort and practising austerities to win reunion with him was deliberately portrayed to express Udayamati's own tragic widowed condition, and her own yearning to be reunited with her departed husband. The goddess serves as the archetype for the queen, the act of the grieving queen being assimilated to that of the goddess. In the bulk of this volume, Dr. Mankodi has given a detailed iconographic outline of each of the niched images in this stepwell and discussed the full range of other ornament - a thoroughness of treatment to which no other single monument in India has so far been exposed in print. The incomplete nature of some parts of the stepwell and its disruption, however, has made a full iconology of the monument impossible. While Dr. Mankodi suggests that the third and fourth stages in the well seem to have been reserved for Visnu and Devi, he still concludes that "no definite scheme emerges..., no clear pattern can be detected, either within the images on a particular terrace or amongst the different terraces as a whole." (p. 9z). Dr. Mankodi's analysis does raise points about three specific iconographic issues: the omnipresence of Visnu in his twenty-four forms;4 the presence of the twelve Gauris and of Uma performing the "five-fire" penance along with their relationship to the dedication of the stepwell; and the use of"images of conjunction" on the pavilion-stages which bond one part of the monument to another.5 In addition to such iconographic issues, Dr. Mankodi provides an analysis of the "date, authorship and style of the Ranki Vav" in his final chapter. This both elaborates on and complements the discussion provided by Michel Postel in his Introductory Remarks. Dr. Mankodi elaborates on the variety of styles present in this wide a body of sculpture and makes chronological links to such dated or dateable monuments as the Sun temple at Modhera (ca. A.D. Io27) and its rangaman.dapa, with a different sculptural style, added half a century later.6 A major virtue of this volume are the many fold-out architectural plans, sections, and elevations prepared by students at the School of Architecture, Ahmedabad, under the supervision of Professor R. J. Vasavada. An elaborate debate on the nature ofthe well's construction is recorded in the Introduction, with sketches and discussion drawn from surviving well-builders in Gujarat. Such ethnohistorical data require careful application, as evinced by disagreements concerning how and why the stepwell was abandoned recorded in this volume, but I consider the use of such evidence rare in Indian scholarship and a significant contribution here. In short, this volume represents a major contribution to the development of scholarly publication on art in India. The elegance of the volume - as well as of its focus, Udayamati's excavation - should make it also a contribution to a popular perception of this insuffi- ciently known aspect of India's heritage.7 I might, in closing, suggest some improvements that could be made in the layout offuture volumes. The description ofthe Ranki Vav stepwell and its sculpture has been organized from bottom to top but the large fold-out plans have been interleaved in a sequence from top to bottom. The use of art paper throughout could have made it possible for plates more often to be on the page where they are first discussed; the complexity of color and black-and-white illustrations in this volume, however, has made this happen rarely in this instance. The reader, as a result, must shuffle pages somewhat uncomfortably to follow an argument visually as well as verbally. Captions have been set inconsistently in both single and double columns (cf. figs. 32-38); they sometimes are under a plate or, with an arrow, on an opposite page (at times in conflict with footnotes in the same column). One caption is missing (fig. 92). These are minor quibbles, however, for a book that 497</page><page sequence="3">ARTIBUS ASIAE LIII, 3/4 (I993), BOOK REVIEWS i '.*, --- .
