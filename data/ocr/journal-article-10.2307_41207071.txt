<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Despairing Optimist, ,,,,,,,,,,, RENÉ DUBOS I am of two minds whenever I try to imagine what the earth would be like without men. On the one hand, I am awed by the extent of the damage we have done by our propensity to desecrate and spoil nature. Many of man's alterations of nature have been catastrophic; history is replete with ecological disasters caused by agricul- tural and industrial mismanagement. But on the other hand, I am cheered by the evidence that we can enrich and improve the earth by transforming it either for profit or for love; and this is the optimistic view of man's relation to nature that I wish to emphasize here. My belief that man can improve on na- ture was expressed recently - in a symbolic manner so to speak - by the American painter Richard Bogart, discussing his phi- losophy of art: "I don't really feel that nature is that good in itself. It needs a painter's help. . . . The thing itself is ter- rific but I can help it. ... I can exercise discipline where nature cannot. All it can do is to go through the cycle." What Rich- ard Bogart said of painting can also apply to other types of human activities. Nature has endless potentialities, but most remain hidden until man brings them out by his reason, imagination and fantasy. It is possible that we overstate our ability to change the surface of the earth either for better or for worse. In fact, nature does not need men to cause fantastic destruc- tion, or to generate loveliness out of the O RENÉ DUBOS, microbiologist and experi- mental pathologist, is professor emeritus at Rockefeller University. His most recent book is A God Within. most dreary environments. Earthquakes, volcanoes, drought, floods, hurricanes, hail- storms, locusts and countless parasites can have destructive powers that greatly exceed those of man. But on the other hand, flow- ering plants and showy birds eventually give charm and color even to the grayest fields of lava. The destructiveness of nature and also its phenomenal creativeness were illus- trated in a spectacular manner by the vol- canic eruption of 1883, which destroyed two-thirds of Krakatau Island, situated in the Malay Archipelago between Sumatra and Java. Experts have estimated that the explosion had the violence of a million H-bombs! What is certain in any case is that its sound traveled 3,000 miles in all directions. The seismic wave it generated reached up to 135 feet above sea level, traveled over most of the world, and was still noticeable in the English Channel. Ash and gases rose 50 miles into the sky, block- ing out sunlight for a 150-mile radius. Vast quantities of pumice hurtled through the air, defoliating trees and clogging harbors. The airborne dust particles gradually spread over the whole earth's atmosphere and persisted in high altitudes for some two years; unusual sky glows and spectac- ular sunsets caused by the fine dust could be seen in much of the world, including the United States, for several months after the explosion. The seismic wave, traveling at more than 50 miles an hour, destroyed seaside villages in Java, Sumatra and neighboring islands; it carried ships with their dead crews miles inland. More than 37,000 persons are known to have been killed by the disaster, 8</page><page sequence="2">THE DESPAIRING OPTIMIST and all living things were destroyed on Krakatau itself as well as in all places in the direct path of the volcanic dust and the tidal wave. When the eruption ended in 1883, Kra- katau was covered by a thick layer of lava and completely lifeless. But progressively, wind and sea brought plants and animals to its shores and life once more took hold. By 1886, thirty-four species of plants were recognized. By 1920, there were some three hundred plant species and six hundred animal species including birds, bats, liz- ards, crocodiles, pythons and, of course, the ubiquitous rats. Today, less than ninety years after the great eruption, the plant communities on Krakatau are approaching the composition of the climax forests that prevail through the Malay Archipel- ago. To use Richard Bogart's expression, nature is once more going through its automatic cycles. An experience I had last summer while visiting the Aegean Islands suddenly made me realize how much man's presence can diversify and enrich the creativeness of nature. Our ship had stopped at Thira (Santorin) late at night, and my first view of the island was in the early morning, as I stepped out of my cabin. There, in front of me, was the incredibly perpendicular cliff, 1,000 feet high and plunging abruptly into water 1,200 feet deep. On the very upper edge of the cliff, gleaming white houses and colorful church domes were silhouetted against the luminous sky. I knew that the cliff was the outcome of a tremendous volcanic eruption, which had split the island 3,500 years ago and had buried its remnants under a thick layer of pumice, in places 200 feet deep. Pro- fessor Spyridos Marinatos has estimated that the explosion was some four times more violent than that of Krakatau, so violent indeed that the heavy volcanic fallout and especially the tidal wave reached Crete 70 miles south and in a few minutes' time destroyed the Minoan civil- ization. I knew that Thira had been dev- astated by other eruptions during historical times, even as late as July 9, 1956, when 2,400 houses - half of the town - were dam- aged and 53 persons killed. I knew that there was no source of water on the island except for the rainwater stored in large cisterns. Yet today the white houses and the colorful churches are glowing in the sun on the upper edge of the cliff; and some of the best wine and tomatoes of Greece are being produced from fields of volcanic pumice that are so poor that only a few trees and shrubs would natur- ally take root. The volcanic eruption of 1500 b.c. with the accompanying earthquake had com- pletely buried Thira's urban civilization, which archaeologists only now are digging from under the thick layers of pumice. Na- ture, left undisturbed, eventually would have brought back the usual Aegean flora and fauna on the island. But men have returned and in the course of time they have created on it several consecutive civil- izations. These in turn have had their ordeals, but nevertheless, they have con- tinued to generate from the tormented Aegean rock a wealth of riches that could not possibly have emerged without man's imagination, order and perseverance. The vastly different types of transforma- tions undergone by the landscape follow- ing the volcanic cataclysms in Krakatau and in Thira bring out in sharp relief the contrast between the automatic processes of nature and the changes guided by man. When left undisturbed, all environments tend toward an equilibrium state. This mature or climax state - as it is called by ecologists - is spontaneously brought about by natural forces and evolutionary adapta- tion. The feedbacks that universally oper- ate in nature always result in coherent equilibrated systems. Paul Valéry's remark, "There are no problems in nature, there are only solutions," expresses the sophisti- cated biological truth that so-called natural environments are adaptive solutions to a given set of circumstances. But the equi- librium states achieved by nature are not necessarily the best or the most interesting states. After the 1883 explosion, Krakatau would have evolved into a different eco- logical equilibrium if winds and tides had 9</page><page sequence="3">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR brought plants and animals different from those that actually landed - and especially if man had decided to colonize the island. Without man, Thira would also have ac- quired a varied flora and fauna; but it would not have produced the small, tasty tomatoes and the heady wine for which it is now famous - let alone the spectacular skyline of gleaming houses and church domes on the edge of the cliff. The claim that human intervention has made modern Thira a place more interest- ing than it would have become if nature had operated without man is admittedly the expression of an anthropomorphic atti- tude. In fact, it implies that man occupies a special place in the biosphere - that he is in it but not of it - and consequently has the right to alter it as an object accord- ing to his own criteria and for his own ends. In my judgment it is a delusion to believe that we can avoid taking an an- thropomorphic attitude toward nature. When ecologists criticize certain environ- mental practices because they will trans- form the earth into a place fit only for rats, roaches and ragweed, they clearly express human feelings and concerns in their eco- logical judgments, and not the preferences of rats, roaches and ragweeds. In evaluating what nature .would be without men, we cannot avoid judgments of values - human values. On his first trip from India to Europe, R. Tagore marveled at "that continent flowing with richness under the age-long attention of her chivalrous lover, western humanity." For him the richness and beauty of the European countryside was a loving creation of the peasantry, the result of an active wooing of the earth. While traveling in Greece last summer, I too deeply experienced once more that the intimate and long association between landscape and man generates new values, perhaps best expressed by the Moslem word baraka, which, according to Robert Graves, is the sense of blessedness that attaches it- self to places and objects after years of loving use. On a late afternoon of mid-July, I visited the ancient Byzantine monastery of Moni Kaisarianis, a few miles southeast of Athens. The monastery is nestled on the slopes of Mount Hymettus at 1,100 feet elevation; from it a trail meanders through an almost treeless landscape among thyme, lavender, sage, mint and other aromatic plants. The marblelike rock formations of Hymettus are denuded, but the luminous sky gives them an architectural quality that is particularly bewitching under the violet light at sunset. Within a short distance of the monastery, the trail reaches an outcrop of rocks that affords a sudden view of the Acropolis, Mt. Lycabettus, and the whole city of Athens. As is so often the case in Greece, the build- ings - whether dedicated to pagan deities, the Christian God, or urban life - derive from their placement in nature a dramatic quality that is independent of their archi- tectural merit. And nature itself has been humanized by several thousand years of use. The grounds associated with the mon- astery have the traditional almond and olive trees of the Greek landscape, but these trees originated long ago in south central or southeastern Asia. The road that leads from Athens to the Kaisarianis mon- astery is shaded with eucalyptus trees, but these were introduced from Australia. Along the trail beyond the monastery the Hymettus is stark and luminous, but its rocks became clearly visible only after de- forestation had led to erosion during historical times. The writers of the classical, Hellenistic and Roman periods were aware of the transformations in the Greek landscape that had been brought about by deforesta- tion. In Critias, Plato compared the land of Attica to the bones of a wasted body ". . . the richer and softer parts of the soil having fallen away, and the mere skele- ton being left." In preclassical times, ac- cording to Plato, the roofs of dwellings were made of timber "cut from trees . . . which were of a size sufficient to cover the largest house." Because of deforestation, however, "the mountains only afford sus- tenance to bees." The famous honey of Hymettus is thus linked to deforestation, 10</page><page sequence="4">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR which favored the multiplication of the bees and the growth of sun-loving aromatic plants. Whereas the land used to be enriched by the rainfall when the mountain slopes were wooded, now, still according to Plato, erosion allows the water to "flow off the bare earth into the sea. . . ." The sacred groves and other sanctuaries are located in places where springs and streams once ex- isted; but most springs and streams pro- gressively dried up in the course of time as a consequence of deforestation. The Ilissus River, which has its source on Mount Hymettus and runs through Athens, was still a lively stream in Plato's time. On a hot day of midsummer, Soc- rates and Phaedrus walked toward a tall plane tree on the banks of the Ilissus, a short distance from the Agora. As reported in the famous dialogue, they discussed rhetoric, philosophy, creativeness and love while cooling their feet in the water of the stream, which they found "delightfully clear and bright." Today, the Ilissus is dry much of the year, and serves as a sewer covered by a noisy roadway. There could not be a more painful symbol of the damage done to the human quality of life by the misman- agement of urbanization and technology. The deforestation of the Greek mainland and islands is now far advanced, but the trend is not irreversible. In fact, trees and wild flowers reappear spontaneously on the denuded slopes wherever a serious effort is made to stop lumbering and prevent grazing. This has been achieved on a fairly large scale near Serrai in northern Greece. In Attica, the protection of limited areas by fencing has been sufficient to allow the spontaneous and rapid development of wild flowers and native trees. With proper écologie management, the Greek mainland and islands could once more be wooded as they were before the classical era, and reforestation would cer- tainly result in improvements in climate and agriculture. As Henry Miller says in The Colossus of Maronssi, "The tree brings water, fodder, cattle, produce . . . shade, leisure, song. . . . Greece does not need archeologists- she needs horticulturists." But reforestation would make the land- scape very different from the classical image we now have of it. For the Greek poet Kostes Palamas (1859-1943) in his poem "The Satyr or the Naked Song," the stark eroded structures of the present landscape triumphantly symbolize the "divine nu- dity" in Greece. And Henry Miller also, a few pages before and after the passage quoted above advocating reforestation, marveled at the rocks that "have been lying for centuries exposed to this divine illumination . . . nestling amid dancing colored shrubs in a blood-stained soil. . . . The very rocks ... are symbols of life eternal." Beyond the Moni Kaisarianis monastery an area on the slopes of Mount Hymettus has been reforested with pines. This patch of forest appears as an inkblot on the luminous landscape, especially at sunset when a subtle violet atmosphere suf- fuses the bare rocks throughout the moun- tain range. The "divine nudity" and the "divine illumination" seem to lose their magic in the shade of the pine trees. The Greek mountains probably were frightening and difficult to penetrate when they were completely wooded. After defor- estation and erosion, in contrast, they ac- quired some of the qualities of a park; the traveler could move on their opened surfaces, his vision floating into a distance of golden light. I have wondered whether the dark and tormented divinities of the preclassical period did not become more playful and reasonably human precisely after they emerged from the forests into the open landscape. Would logic have flourished so well if Greece had remained covered with an opaque mantle of trees? In Nordic countries, also, the attractive- ness of the natural environment can be greatly improved by human intervention. During historical times, a large percentage of the coniferous forest in southern and central Sweden was cleared and converted into fields and pastures. The traveler driv- ing or flying from the north toward Stock- holm experiences a sense of relief when the monotonous mantle of trees begins to be broken by cultivated areas and smiling meadows. Increasingly, however, the small 12</page><page sequence="5">THE AMERICAN SCHOLAR farms of Sweden are becoming uneconom- ical and are abandoned. The openings in the forest, which used to support oats, rye, or other cultivated crops, as well as graz- ing cattle, are being taken over by spruce and pine planted in dull, straight lines. Even worse, the land that is left fallow is quickly invaded by juniper, briar and other unattractive brush. Thus one of the problems of conserva- tion in Sweden is to find ways to preserve the open landscape. Several experimental programs are being tested - subsidies to farmers for the continuation of grazing by cattle and sheep, or mechanical mowing for keeping the brush down. In either case, public funds are being spent to preserve the open countryside, which is a man-made landscape. Instead of being valued for its agricultural productiveness, farmland is considered an aesthetic asset - for a visual quality that used to be hidden under the natural mantle of trees and had to be revealed by human intervention. There is nothing final about a given environment. Sweden and Vermont can be completely wooded, or some of their valleys and slopes can be converted into farm- lands. The white rocks of Greece and the gray boulders of the Hudson River Valley can be covered with soil and trees, or they can be exposed and reveal the geologic architecture of the landscape, as on Mount Hymettus or in Central Park. Men have always recognized or imagined orderly patterns in the bewildering opu- lence of nature. In fact, they have always humanized the earth to fit the patterns they perceive. Early in the Middle Ages, the Benedictine monks believed that, by transforming the chaotic and disordered wilderness, they were working as partners of God and completing His creation. I have used other words to express the same faith. We can manipulate the raw stuff of external nature to shape it into environ- ments that are ecologically sound, econom- ically profitable, aesthetically rewarding and favorable to man's nature. We can in- sert our dreams into ecological determinism and thus enrich the earth and diversify its manifestations by bringing out its hidden potentialities.
