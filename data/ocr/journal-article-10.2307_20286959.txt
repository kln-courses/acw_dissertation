A DISCUSSION ON OCCUPATION AND ENVIRONMENT AS CAUSA TIVE FACTORS OF INSANITY. By Theo. B. Hyslop, M.D., Medical Superintendent, Beth lern Royal Hospital ; Lecturer on Mental Diseases, St. Mary's Hospital ; Vice-Pr?sident of the Section. My task to day is one of great difficulty, and it has occasioned me not a little anxiety as to how best to present to you this complex subject for consideration. At first I was prompted to deal seriatim with various trades and occupations as causative factors of insanity ; but, when I began to search the records available for statistics, I found that my observations would have to depend mainly upon the records of those who were under official cognizance as certified lunatics. A little thought, moreover, convinced me that such observations would not be of sufficient value unless supplemented by observations based upon records of those who are not under official cognizance, yet who are incapable by reason of mental perversion or defect from taking active part as citizens. It also appeared essential to take account of those who remain as citizens, yet who are incapable of aiding in their own survival, or of adding to the vigour of the race, and those who by reason of mental hebetude or other psychological factors are unable to support either themselves or their progeny, and who fall into the category of the " unemployed " or "unemployable." An almost insuperable difficulty rests in the fact that it is wellnigh impossible to obtain a complete census of the physical and mental states of the people. Statistics are, as you are aware, so full of fallacies that, in the present instance, I have treated them with extreme diffidence and even distrust. For present purposes, therefore, I prefer to deal with broad issues, and in order to facilitate discussion I shall confine my remarks to the consideration of a few of those larger problems which seem to have direct bearings upon the mental health of the community. Now, in dealing with the factors of causation of the insani ties, we must always take into account, and allow for, those which are internal?that is, either due to inheritance, or to the existence of some fundamental capacity which cannot be explained as the result of immediate ancestry. It is also necessary that we should form clear conceptions as to what may be traceable to various sociological factors, or, in other words, to the social environment, ana those which have their origin in physical causes either affecting the physical organism or having their seat in the physical mechanism itself. At a quarterly meeting of the Medico-Psychological Associa tion, held at York this year, I read a paper on the relation ship of pauperism, overcrowding, and insanity. I the a endeavoured to deal with such subjects as rural and urban life, the influence of trades, overcrowding, pauperism, crime, alien immigration, emigration, ergo phobia (or work shyness), the unemployed, and the unemployable, the residuum of social wreckage, the vagrant, education and its influence for good or ill, and trades-unionism with its influence on the working unit. Each of these ?troblems has a psychological aspect and significance in the ife-history of our race as yet but imperfectly understood. With these problems I have now little to do, except to repeat that, when we come to take an actual survey of the welfare of the British race, we see that a remarkable transformation has taken place. We have passed from our natural state to an artificial one of enforced brain activity with all its atten dant evils. The effects of rural and urban life have never been accurately or comprehensively determined. On comparing various reports upon this question, it appears to be certain that education is responsible for im proving the people off the face of the country districts, inas much as it sets alight an ambition to migrate to the cities where the struggle for life is continued under circumstances totally at variance with what has been destined for some both by habit and heredity. For such people, the stress and strain of city life is disastrous, and the step from country to town is but one of the commonest of all the steps towards mental and physical deterioration ; the accidents of civilization, such as alcohol disease, and incidental stress and strain, finding in them merely the readiest victims. The necessity of this migration, as determined by the state of agriculture, makes it none the less an evil, and it is a symptom in the evolution of an essentially agricultural race wnich is fraught with extreme danger to the maintenance of its nervous and mental stability. This migration also leaves its stamp upon the rural districts, where the residuum may not only be weak or even degenerate, but there is apt to be intermarriage of near relations and the production of a relatively greater number of lunatics. To the various aspects of education?to its objects and aims, to its false notions as to the economic management of brain power, to its often ridiculous waste of nervous energy, and to its results as evidenced by the mental condition of the people, both inside and outside our asylums?I have nothing to add to what I said in my opening address at the Winchester Diocesan Conference held last year. I then said: "The policy of endeavouring to raise the people and improve their capacity for resistance and survival by an enforced and often useless method of education is not always true economy in the management of the available nervous and mental force of the nation. The transplantation of pauper children from the gutter or the field to the Board echoDl at sun. age when their little lives cry out for freedom and expansion, while suggested as being necessitous, is not in itself an unmixed good. The gutter of the pauper child is its parentage, and a heritage of disease brought about, in part, by the abuse of alcohol and other things. The mere transplantation in such instances only too otten serves but to expose the corruptions of the soil, and the sins of the parents are but paid for in lull by the ratepayers who contribute to the maintenance of our asylums." This question was dealt with at some length in a discuesion on Brain Fag in Children held at the recent Sanitary Congress in London, ?md the key to the whole situation would appear to be, not that education wisely directed is in itself an evil, but that ever since the Education Act of 1870 we have been with faulty methods striving after the unattainable. With the increase in the impositions of every grade of education from the Board school to the highest university curriculum the brain tax on the people has become more and more irksome, and, instead of ameliorating their distress, the amount of pauperism, overcrowding, and insanity has but increased by leaps and bounds far beyond anything ever before known in the history of our empire. Nowadays we are faced with the grave question as to whether the physical and mental health of the rising generation is not of more practical moment than that of mere accumulation of know ledge, and I speak with no uncertain voice when I claim for methods of faulty and over-education a grave responsibility in the bringing about an exposure of the barrenness of our brain-soil and an ever-increasing residuum of failures. Everywhere throughout the land we hear the same cry, 11 Educate ! educate !" and the results have been wide and far reaching. Pupils and teachers have increased a thousand fold; standards have been raised; competition as determined by examination, has become more than ever a test of memory of acquired; knowledge. Everywhere we meet the same struggle for mental culture, until we have become brainy and unstable to a degree that threatens the possibility of a reversion. The public mind is at present much agitated by the alleged prevalence of physical deterioration, by the diminished birth rate, and by the increase in infantile mortality. In the House of Lords, not long ago, the Bishop of Ripon gave it as his opinion that the lacts revealed in the report of the Inter departmental Commission on Physical Deterioration were pregnant with danger to the empire. He contended that, unless some steps were taken, the British race would no longer be able to maintain its position as a colonizing and as a ruling power. He specially referred to the decline in the birth-rate, and to the large increase in infantile mortality, and he pointed out that as many as 144,000 infants were lost every year through preventable causes. He also noticed the remarkable decline in the birth-rate in British Colonies. On several occasions I have urged that whereas education and the requirements of this age necessitate a constantly increasing output of mental energy so as to enable all to reach the highest possible standard, the output of physical energy is undergoing a constant diminution in a downward direction, owing to the standardization of labour at the very lowest possible standard of labour, be it skilled or otherwise. This appears to be a melancholy fact, and we are faced, on the one hand, by the problem of over-education and the possibility of</page><page sequence="2">942 M^Slw^^l_SECTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINE._fooT. m, 1005 a false economy in the brain system of the nation, and, on the other hand, the problem of the trades-unions and other ! agencies as affecting the vital energies of the people. I am fully aware that I lay down a challenge when I state that on considering the diminution of the hours, of labour, and all the . various impositions and shackles of trades unionisrn, there is, or appears to be, no escape from the melancholy conclusion that the process whereby the standard of physical and mental energy is turned to the level of the j least fit does much to vitiate and render inert the vitality of i the British unit. According to the Registrar-General the j agricultural industry is the most important in the united Kingdom. In 1881 there were of the agricultural class ? 2,362,331 males; in 1891 the number had fallen to 2,109,812, ahowing a decrease of 6.2 per cent. The proportion borne by ! male agriculturists to the total population of the United j Kingdom aged 10 years and upwards had fallen from 188 per 1,000 in 1881 to 136 per i,coo in 1901. * The decline in the numbers engaged in this industry, which amounted to over a quarter of a million of men in the twenty years, does not by any means represent the fluctuation from the fields to the streets, inasmuch as no cognizance is taken of the wives and families. The numbers employed in building trades show an increase ! o* 35.6 per cent, in the last decennium. Metal trades and milling industries also show an increase by 26.1 per cent, and 24.4 per cent, respectively. Many other employments show an increase, but for present purposes I prefer to refer to them in connexion with the movements of the female population. From the census of 1901 we learn that the population of the United Kingdom was 41,458,721, of whom the mentally deranged numbered 177,995, and of whom 84 936 were men, but the larger number?93,059?were women. The total shows a proportion of 1 in every 233. These figures show a serious increase in every year since 1S71. The statistics for England and Wales show that of the total insane under care on January ist, 1904, 54.2 per cent, were of the female sex, a proportion in excess of that obtaining in the male popula- j tion ; for, according to the census return in 1901, the females were 51.6 per cent, of the total population. The causes of this increase amongst females are interesting. Alcoholic intemperance more readily affects their nervous systems. The numbers of those who bave had previous attacks are greater, and heredity forms a more important factor than formerly. Pregnancy, parturition, the puerperal State, and other conditions incidental to the female sex, are greater sources of danger in the new modes of life, and the females are less fitted to withstand the strains upon their systems. Similarly, worry, overwork, adverse circumstances, domestic troubles, and other mental and moral factors more readily upset constitutions fashioned in a more nervous mould. In a word, the removal of woman from her natural sphere of domesticity to that of mental labour not only renders her less fit to maintain the virility of the race, but it renders her prone to degenerate and initiate a downward tendency which gathers impetus in her progeny. Max O'Rell has stated that "so long as there is one woman left on the face of the earth and one man left to observe her. thev world will be able to hear something new about women." Woman's mission in this world is, according to Napoleon, that of breeding as many children as possible. Moralists are more generous, however, and assign her a double r?le of wife and mother. We may go further still and recognize that her mission is not only familial but social also, with a duty to perform toward her fellow-creatures and to help the destiny for which she was created. We grant her the rignt of being a great civilizing agent as well as an ornament, but, intending woman to be mother, Nature fashioned her destiny for her. . The departure of woman from her natural state to an artificial one involves a brain struggle which is deleterious to the virility of the race. Nowadays the average female child?at the period of greatest susceptibility to mental, moral, and physical influences?is subjected to the pressure of modern methods of education ill calculated to prepare her for any thing but a mental or nervous r?le in life. The physiological processes of puberty make greater demands on girls than on boys, and girls are handicapped by considerations which ought to make them realize the futility of forcing education and undertaking work which only too frequently renders them neurotic and sexually incompetent. When we look the facts in the face and note the divergence of our women from the life-r?le entrusted to them by Nature, are we inspired with confidence as to the results for future genera tions? It is true that the more our women aspire to exercising their nervous and mental functions so they become not only less virile, but also less capable of generating healthy stock. Now not only is this a question concerning the virility of the race, but it has very direct bearings upon the increase of our nervous instability. In fact, the higher women strive to hold the torch of intellect the dimmer are the rays of light for the vision of their progeny. In the ten years 1891-1901 there was a decrease by 6.2 pet cent, of women engaged in domestic service, whereas the number of female workers and dealers in dress?comprising dressmakers, milliners, sbirtmakers, seamstresses, machinists, etc., increased by 3.8 per cent, in England and Wales. In England and Wales there has been an increase in the number of females engaged in the textile industries, but Scotland and Ireland show a decrease. When we consider the number of schoolmistresses, teachers, and lecturers, however, we see that they have increased from 146,014 in 1881 to 170,377 in 1891, or by 16.7 per cent. ; and the number has further increased to 201,716 in 1901, or by 18.4 per cent, in the ten years 1891-1901. It is of interest to note that in England and Wales there was in 1901 one schoolmistress for every thirty-four females at ages from 3 to 20 years ; in Scotland there was one for every forty-seven ; and in Ireland one for every 61. In the ten years 1891-1901 male teachers increased by 15 9 per cent., as jcompared with 18.9 per cent, of females. At the census of 1871, which practically corresponds with the introduction of compulsory elementary education, there was one teacher enumerated, on the average, for every sixty-seven persons living at ages from 3 to 20 years. This proportion has changed to one in fifty in 1901. I would ask you to note also, that, according to the returns of the Board of Education, there were 36,207 male and 113,597 female teachers in elementary day-schools in 1901, the male teachers having increased since 1891 by 15.1 percent, and the females by no less than 50.5 per cent. ; and, whereas there were 240 j female to 100 male teachers in the earlier year, the ratio in 1901 had increased to 314 to 100. Literary and scientidc pursuits (including authors, editors, journalists, reporters, and shorthand writers) are represented by an increase of 31.1 per cent, among males, and 58.7 per cent, among females. Under the headings, "merchants, agents, accountants, business and other clerks," a considerable increase is shown. Those concerned as merchants, salesmen and buyers show an increase by 36.6 per cent, on the males and 200.2 per cent, on the females. I might enumerate many more facts derived from statistics, but I have given sufficient to demonstrate that the female population is gradually drift ing to modes of life incompatible with the proper maintenance of the functions designed for woman by Nature. The outcome of this drifting process has been prejudicial to the coming race, and although much has been done by Miss A. M. Anderson, H.M. Principal Lady Inspector of Factories, and others to improve the physical fitness of factory girls to become housewives and mothers, yet right throughout the whole range of womankind and womanhood the obligation to Nature is becoming more and more perverted. It is not alone the freeing of mothers from factories which calls for help, but there is required a universal recognition by woman that she does more than half to fashion the destiny of our race, and that her obligations begin with childhood, reach their crises in childbirth, and only er d when she has nourished her young and imparted to them a vigour and impetus which cannot be obtained by any artificial methods of feeding so much in vogue at the present day. These are indeed important questions, and the human race would benefit more by the return of woman to her place in Nature than by the realization of any system of universal suffrage. Miss Marie Corelli has granted in her Free Opinions that ** it seems to be a rule of Nature that if we gain in one direction we must lose in another." She then goes on to say, "One of the most remarkable changes, perhaps, that has taken place in the passing of the years is the different position assigned to Woman from that which she occupied when Dickens and Thackeray wrote their wonderful novels .... but as time has progressed, and women have arisen one after another in the various departments of Art and Literature, men have begun to fall back and look askance, and somewhat threateningly, on the fair trespassers in their hitherto guarded domains. And the falling back, and the looking askance con tinue in exact proportion to the swift and steady onward march of the white-robed Amazons into the Battle of Life. Braced with the golden shield of Courage, helmeted with Patience, and armed with the sword of Faith, the Women-warriors</page><page sequence="3">Oct. 14, 1905.I_OCCUPAT.ON AND INSANITY. _l*???s?S** 943 are taking the field, and are to be seen now in massed ranks, daily marshalling themselves in more compact order, firm footed and fearless, prepared to fight for intellectual freedom, and die rather than yield. They, too, will earn the right to live; they too, will be something greater than the mere vessels of man's desire-whether maids, wives, or mothers, they will prove themselves worthy to be all these three, and more than these, to the very utmost extent of their moral and intellectual being.There is one thing that women generally, in the struggle for intellectual free life, should always remember?one that they too often are apt to forget, namely, that the laws as they at present exist are made by men for men." Such are the "free opinions" of this champion of the female sex. If woman is to attain to the sublime heights claimed for her by Miss Marie Corelli, it is an unfor tunate thing for the human race that man is prevented, by circumstances over which he has no control, from undertaking for himself unaided the exclusive privilege of gestation. Natural laws must be obeyed, and with Nature the great biological laws of evolution must take precedence over the aspirations of even the most vain of her ornaments. Certain it is that Nature has designed motherhood to nourish the young, and departures from the claims of Nature are not due to faults in Nature but to perversions of womanhood. In making these statements I am fully aware that there is trouble ahead, and. belonging as I do to the male sex, I also know that the last word has not been said. Doubtless my criticisms will raise a storm of angry protest, and the ques tion will be asked why men do not make it unnecessary for women to work ! The reply is obvious. Men will be better able to support their wives and families if not handicapped by female competition, and by giving up many of the so called claims of society?personal adornment, and a restless demand for amusement ; or, in other words, by being content with a simpler life, women will make the task of man much easier of accomplishment. In conclusion, I would say that it is a miserable travesty of the scheme of evolution that the brains of our babes should be State-fed by mental arith metic whilst their little bodies are nurtured by artificial food stuffs derived from every available source other than their own mothers. Moral Environment, I now pass to the consideration of certain moral factors which are well worthy of our consideration, and I propose to speak upon the influence of our religious life as affecting the welfare of the people. Religious excitement is not infrequently assigned as a cause of insanity. I have stated elsewhere my belief that the philosophy of the infinite, far from being a source of aberrations of thought which may be deemed insane, is the ultimate point of our mental evolution, and I here repeat that a true and philosophical religion raises the mind above a mere incidental emotionalism, and gives stability. With no religion and no moral obligation the organism is apt to become a prey to the lusts of the flesh and their consequences. Gasquet observes that religion may either produce or tend to hinder unsoundness of mind ; that it may cause certain symptoms of insanity or modify them ; and, lastly, that it may be employed as a means of moral prevention and treatment. He believes that every form of religion, however widely it may differ from our standard of the truth, if it enforces the precepts of morality, is a source of strength to the sound mind that sincerely accepts it. Clouston has justly observed that far more depends upon the brain that goes to Church than upon what it may obtain in the Church. That is to say, there must be the predisposi tion to break down? the religious influence being often merely an accident. It must also be remembered that religious over enthusiasm may be merely a symptom and not a cause. The relationship of religion to insanity suggests two ques tions which must always be of great interest, namely: (i) Religious functions in connexion with sane life ; (2) religious excitement and enthusiasm as a cause or symptom of insanity. In regard to the former, I believe that, from a general point of view, if religion under determined conditions is found useful or essential for the sane, it is likely to be so under con ditions otherwise determined and arranged for the insane. Many insane patients, of course, are totally incapable of attending any religious function. Some must be prohibited ; others may be encouraged. I may state my opinion, as an asylum physician, that a generic case of religious excitement or enthusiasm may most advisedly be restrained from religious .functions until at least the acute symptoms have subsided. I presume there can belittle doubt that no religious officer j will be likely to succeed in accomplishing much for patient? j without accurate knowledge of insanity and the mental ex I periences of those whom he seeks to influence. The fact that I mental aberration forms a special study and phase of life of I course increases his difficulties and limits his possibilities. Otherwise, where there is apparent failure both inside asylum? I and without, such failures may very possibly be attributed to I the deficiencies of the doctrine, the discipline of the religion itself, the organizations peculiar to it, or the functionaries associated with it in our day. Nor will I seek to add more to what I have stated upon this point than a saying I have heard somewhere, that the Christian religion, rightly understood, is the truest piece of philosophy which is ! If so, I doubt not we shall be told that it is the duty of all who profess Christianity to assist in the practical application of its pre cepts where such can be judiciously and safely applied, taking I religious things perforce as they find them, and utilizing their own special knowledge to the best possible advantage I according to the conditions they find. In stating that " a true and philosophical religion raise? the mind above a mere incidental emotionalism," I used the word "religion" in its literal sense, as derived from re and lego, to gather and consider, as opposed to negligens. I have in no way extended its connotation so as to include fanaticism. When witnessing the outbursts of fanaticism in Morocco and in the East, I regarded the demonstrations a? examples of "incidental emotionalism," but I have expressed no opinion upon the question of the sanity of such emotional outbursts. So far as I am personally concerned. I disdain* any plea on behalf of religious superstition. Religion and moral obligation I take to be almost convertible terms, and to me both are equally compatible with intuitionalism, utilitarianism, or any other " ism " derived from the study of the laws of life and mind. Moral laws are generally principles I of action which an intelligent being must apply for himself in the guidance of his conduct, and the translation of such general principles (expressed either in general abstract form or in the form of a command) into particular actions. Con formity with such precepts of morality I take to be the safe guard against the " lustB of the fiesh." In regard to the second point, a study of the phenomena of insanity has taught me one thing?that great care must be exerciBed not to form rash or prejudicial conclusions? I apprehend that religious enthusiasm in itself cannot justly be called an evil. Rather, I suppose, does it embody the most healthy and preservative development of our seeial forces. Like many other tendencies of the mind, it is subject to exaggeration, misapplication, and a predominance of the emotional over the intellectual. As a matter of fact, the typical cases of religious insanity directly developable fron? sectarian or even undenominational religious enthusiasm* from religious meditations, exercises, devotions or supersti tions, are by no means bo common as they are supposed to be by the uninitiated observer. The true point lies in this?that very many mental cases bear a strongly-marked religions, or at least moral, appect. The psychology of the subject will show, for example, that acute depression?a predominant phase of abnormal emotional life?leads almost necessarily to a religious interpretation. And this is even more the case with many actual sense perversions. Such, I mean, as have ever been associated with the ideas of the supernatural. These are not necessarily caused by religious over-excitement or enthusiasm. They may assume the appearance of it, because, being the deepest and most real feelings, desires, and convictions of the perverted organic life or of the moral reaction which accompanies it, they cannot well be expressed or described except in strong moral terms. Over and over again does this appear, and often among those least likely to be suspected of any religious predisposition. That these feelings should be clothed according to the prevailing ideas and creed of the patient is an essential reproduction of the mind. But, after all, this only relates to the form of their appearance, and there are many things which lie deeper. In a paper read before the Society for the Study of Child hood I urged that the mental hygiene o? childhood was not to be determined by any special denominational method. Such limited methods may result in the fixity of an idea or belief quite compatible with usefulness in any sphere of activity, bat they do not deal with the broader and deeper question of the preservation of the mental health of the individual. The exaggerated importance of the denominational question which has engendered passive resistance ought to give Way to the question of mental health, and engender a strong and active</page><page sequence="4">944 -?SR.'SSSj_SECTION OF PSYCHOLOGICAL MEDICINF._[Oct. 14, 190$. resistance to all that tends to narrow or circumscribe the mental life of the infant. I believe it to be our object as teachers and physicians to fight against all those influences which tend to produce either religious indifference or intem perance, and to subscribe as best we may to that form of religious belief, so far as we can find it practically embodied or effective, which believes in "the larger hope," though it condemns unreservedly the demonstrable superstition and sentimentality which impede its progress and power. As an alienist, and as one whose whole life has been concerned with the sufferings of the human mind. I would state that of all the hygienic measures to counteract disturbed sleep, depres sion of spirits, and all the miserable sequelae of a distrait mind, I would undoubtedly give the first place to the simple habit of prayer. Let the child be taught to believe in an anthropomorphic God the Father, or in an all-pervading medium of guidance and control, or in the integrity of a cosmic whole, with its transmutations, evolutions, and indestructibilities. It matters little, for they all lead in the same direction. Let there but be a habit of nightly communion, not as a mendicant, or repeater of words more adapted to the tongue of a sage, but as a humble individual who submerges or asserts his individuality as an integral part of a greater whole. Such a habit does more to clean the spirit and strengthen the soul to overcome mere incidental emotionalism than any other therapeutic agent known to me. Our schools are as gardens for the cultivating, judicious pruning and sustaining young life by gardeners who have, or who ought to have, full knowledge of the tender plants under their care. Our churches are to the moral welfare of the com muai ty as our schools are to the intellectual. The church has been aptly termed " God's Garden," where the art of living good lives and the making of character is helped by specially appointed gardeners. It is needless to say, however, that the light of reason or sanity, as bestowed upon us by Nature, is the light to which all other considerations must give way lest we in our turn too soon pass the borderland of knowing things as they are. In view of the fact that we have to face so many problems of vital interest to the welfare of our race, it seems strange that the medical faculty should be numerically so poorly represents d in Parliament. Individual efforts can Eometimes modify public opinion, but the protesting voice of even the whole medical faculty is only too frequently utterly ignored in a Chamber where the health and sanity of the people ought at all times to be regarded, not only as of paramount importance, but also as urgent and imperative. Until the medical faculty is more fully represented in Parliament and has a medical authority in the Cabinet at the head of a State Department of Public Health the country must suffer from the want of legislation in matters of urgent necessity, and it is needless to say that in no department of medicine is there more desperate necessity for immediate help than that to which we belong. Dr. Robert Jonbs referred to the influence of mental over pressure in the production of insanity, and as supporting this the statistics of insanity in governesses were referred to, which showed a higher percentage of insanity in this class than in the class of licensed victuallers and barmaids. These statistics could be obtained in the Report of the Lunacy Commissioners to the Lord Chancellor of a few years ago, when the numerical lists of employment and employed weie published after the last census. He agreed that there was a considerable migration of the inhabitants from rural into urban districts, and that marriage of the residue probably produced a deficient offspring, but there was now a higher rural population than existed half a century ago ; the propos tion of increase was, however, much higher in urban districts than rural, but the environment in the latter tended to natural health and vigour, and the inhabitants of country districts were not subject to fluctuations of occupation suchas occurred inevitably among town industries from various economic causes. Dr. Robert Jones did not agree with the general strictures passed upon women by Dr. Hyslop, hut he did heartily agree with him in the necessity, where possible, to encourage mothers to bring up their own children. The birth-rate was a matter of the utmost importance, and cer tainly did bear a definite relation to occupation, as was shown by Dr. Shadwell in his interesting investigations into this aspect of health and vigour in cities and towns where textile .industries were carried out. The emotional aspect relating to religion discussed by Dr. Hyslop had the hearty concurrence of Dr. Jon?i, as he thought everybody would admit the influence of high ideals in enabLng persons to preserve mental and physical health. Dr. W. Lloyd Andriezhn said that the vast increase of lunatics, idiots and imbeciles, tramps, vagrants, and pro stitutes required serious consideration. These were all examples of mental (cerebral) degeneration. The census of 1900 and his own observation bore this out. They were failures of evolution such as were inevitable in the progress of life and of races. A comforting factor in regard to the hereditary transmission of evil traits was the "regression tendency" expounded by Gallon. On the other hand, the tendencies for evil might assume such prepotency as to constitute what would be called a " true pathogenic mutation." The Jukes family was cited by the author, and its development through five or six generations pointed out as a classical example. In four to five generations the descendants of such degenerate stocks ended in extinction, the stray survivals being but a very small number, while the victims exhibited all the most varied developments of vice, crime, insanity, and neurotic disease. Migration was also shown (added Dr. Andriezen) to be a cause of decay and degeneration in the land depleted thus of its best blood yearly and for decades, as witness Ireland. Woman by long aeons of evolution had been the mother?the bearer of offspring. Neglecting, by choice in some cases and by force of necessity in others, the bearing and upbringing of children, and entering into fierce com petition with men?underselling his labour, and promoting abuses like sweating by the small wages she accepted?woman had benefited herself but little, and had neglected her duty of ! motherhood by this unwise rivalry against man. She had crowded him out from the labour market, not content with the feminine occupations which had hitherto satisfied her sex?namely, nursing, cooking, domestic duties, the care of children, music and the drama. But entering into the strenuous life, she had grown exhausted and prematurely worn-out. neurasthenic, thin and spare, and with a tendency to sterility. Engelmann's observations, based on gynaeco logical experience at Boston, were then cited iulJy. Dr. Andriezen concluded with remarks on religion as the embodi ment of cosmic law and the tendency of the Eternal to righteousness, a view developed by the writings of Matthew Arnold and Herbert Spencer. Dr. A. T. Schofield rose to comment on two points in Dr. Hy slop's paper : the one wa s the position of women and the other that of religion. Referring to women, it had been laid down that employment was bad for them, and that they should better qualify themselves for motherhood. Was Dr. Hyslop aware that women had not the choice of marriage ? Dr. Hyslop had pointed out how the physique of men was deteriorating, but he had not pointed out that women were not only rapidly evolving mentally but physically ; and there could be no doubt that women as a race were improving faster than men. There were now thousands of matured, strong women fitted in every way to become mothers of a noble race who were condemned to an enforced sterility. No week passed but that he saw lamentable cases of nervous and sometimes mental disease due to this enforced sterility. Was Dr. Hyslop aware that the employment of women was a self-protective measure instinctively adopted on account of i their enforced celibacy? He considered personally that it had saved thousands of women from nervous disease. So far from condemning professional life as a bar to matrimony, Dr. Hyslop should look on it as a wise measure for preserving to women a healthy and profitable existence till married life could begin. He considered that much that had been said against women as to professional life was not borne out by facts. They laboured under great disadvantages, and were often disgracefully underpaid owing to their want of trade unions. Dr. Andriezen had given figures in American sterility. But nowadays a small family was no proof of partial sterility. In North Paddington, where the poor live, the average size of a family was six ; in South Paddington it was three. If he took these figures as representing the relative sterility of the parish of Paddington he would be greatly misled. Turn ing now for one moment to religion, he thought all realized I that the cause of much functional nerve disease was due to such a weakening of the higher mental centres that they were unable to exercise their usual inhibition over the emotions. Now, religion and love were two most powerful emotional excitants, and it need excite no surprise that these often I appeared as factors in neurasthenia. As Dr. Hyslop said, religious enthusiasm was not primarily an evil, but it often I was secondarily in nerve disease. At the same time, true re I ligion was an important factor in health, as Professor Jamea</page><page sequence="5">Opt. 14, 1905?]_LUNACY IN LEICESTERSHIRE_[m^^SS?? 945 had pointed out in his Gifford Lecture. The beneficial factor in religion, psychologically, was no doubt due to the harmony it produced in the organism. If there was, as he believed, a God?a personality, a law?above them, no man could be in perfect health who wa9 not in harmony with it in every part of his personality. Health, wholeness, and holiness were all words from one root, and had a similar meaning. With regard to their own profession, this was pointed out by the late lamented Professor Nothnagel, when he said, " Only a good man can be a good physician." Dr. Johnstons (Leeds) said that the question of environ ment might be divided into three; (0 Physical surrounding*, (2) social and educational ; and (3) mental conceptions drawn from surroundings, and after being reflected upon committed to paper in their writings, and which were still affecting man kind. He quoted examples from Homer, Virgil, Lord Byron, Lord Tennyson, and three examples from Horace. And quo tations were given from Gray, Mark Twain, and Dry den. Then a comparison was instituted between the three profes sions?divinity, law, and medicine?showing the advantage in a lifetime of medicine on the general character of the physician, the result being induced by the sympathies of the doctor being continually and entirely utilized for the benefit and welfare of mankind. Dr. Morrison (Hereford) said that two years ago he very pointedly drew the attention of the local authority to the effect that continous emigration from the rural and urban districts of the county of Hereford had on the production of congenital insanity in the county. They had, he believed, a larger proportion to population of congenital insane than any county in England and Wales, and if there was one that was higher he did not at this moment remember. One-tenth of the total population had been emigrating annually for a number of past years, taking away the fit mentally and physically, and leaving behind the unfit to reproduce a family of a standard distinctly inferior in the aggregate to the parental standard. This deterioration was so marked, and revealed with such prominence, that the unusual proportion of insane in the county with a diminishing population was and had been the puzzle of the local authority. Whether subsidized industry established in such counties would help to check this deteriora tion was a subject for national investigation and pronounce ment, and might well be incorporated within the purview of the larger question of social reform. As one would expect, with few industries beyond that of agriculture, crime took the form in a larger proportion of instances of offences against the person rather than against honest industrial speculations and dealings. Alcoholism also played a prominent part in the habits of the people, and cretinism was not unknown. Thyroid disease was on the increase, adolescent dementia was abundant, and he ventured to think that malignant disease was now more frequently seen in the asylum population than before?all the foregoing being evidence of hereditary degenera tion. Tuberculosis, which was almost unknown among the asylum population, was now more prevalent. In short, all the evidences of hereditary degeneration shown in the character of the ailments was found to be more in evidence, and could only be regretted, both from the local economic standpoint and the larger national issues of race and empire, and on this association rested the duty of awakening the nation's consciousness to the evils and calamities likely to overtake the equivalents of racial prosperity. Dr. Fletcher Beach said it seemed to have been forgotten by the author of this paper and by the various speakers that there was a great excess of women over men that came into the world. Now, many of these women never could marry, and as they were better educated than the parents, they forsook domestic service, and became teachers, typewriters, and so on, The great increase in the number of teachers was, of course, due to the great increase in the number of children that had to be taught. O f course a great deal depended upon the way in which the child was taught. Teachers were now joining societies, such as the British Child Study Association, and were studying the children they had to teach, and more interest was taken in them. A large number of women, it was quite true, did not nurse their children because they had to go out to work to earn their own living. Many men were unemployed, and the wives had to earn wages to feed their families. A speaker mentioned that there were a larger number of governesses who became insane than barmaids. That, no doubt, was due to the anxiety which many governesses had as to whether or no they would earn their living, but the remark did not apply to the large number of teachers of elementary schools throughout the country, who were, as a rule, well nourished, well educated, and well trained. Mr. James Stewart (Clifton) said that the number of men who entertained the idea of matrimony was decreasing, partly because the young women of the present day engaged in gymnastic exercises to such an extent that their mammary development was reducing their figure to the flatness of the male. A man is more naturally drawn to a womanly woman than to one who tries to reduce to a minimum the difference between the two sexes. He (Mr. Stewart) agreed fully with Dr. Hyslop as to the value of religious influence in arresting degeneracy. Dr. Hyslop replied that he had derived his information from the Registrar-General, the Commissioners in Lunacy, and the Interdepartmental Committee on Physical Deteriora tion, and that it did not advance the matter to merely regard his statements as evidences of pessimism. He agreed that greater numbers of governesses broke down mentally, and he attributed this mainly to the increased stringency of exami nations and competition. After thanking the various mem bers who had contributed to the debate, he urged the neces sity of compulsory service as a means to avert some of the, distressing problems of the unemployed and unemployable.</page></plain_text>
