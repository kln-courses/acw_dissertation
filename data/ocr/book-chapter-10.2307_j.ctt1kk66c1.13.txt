<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> Chapter 9 Rice and Revolution Agrarian Life and Global Food Policy  on the Upper Guinea Coast Joanna Davidson Introduction Along the Upper Guinea Coast, rice has played a signifi cant role in shaping land  and livelihoods, persons and population fl ows, desires, dreams, disappointments,  spiritual and moral life, and interactions and transactions for many hundreds  of years, or perhaps even a few thousand. For several centuries this area of West  Africa was known to Europeans as the Grain or Rice Coast, signalling their rec- ognition of the importance, abundance and defi ning aspect of rice in this region  (or, more selfi shly, their own interest in securing this rice in their trade along the  coast). But both before and after European dominance in this area, rice played  a defi ning role in residents’ interactions with each other and with the various  outsiders who traded, raided and invaded in their midst. Rice in this region has  been linked to the rise of the great precolonial West African states of Ghana, Mali  and Songhai (Grist 1959; Osseo-Asare 2005). Th e rice-growing landscape – es- pecially the mangrove swamps – that evokes the topographical imaginary of this  region has often served as a refuge from various external forces and foes, from  centuries-old Islamic incursions (Paulme 1963; Linares 1981) to more recent  iconoclasts (Sarró 2009), and from Atlantic slavers (Hawthorne 2003) to more  recent civil strife (Richards 2006). Th is chapter provides a broad view of the history and interpenetration of  rice in social, political, religious and ecological domains across the Upper Guinea  Coast, chronicling also the current diffi  culties of residents in this region who are  no longer able to grow enough of it. I have divided the chapter into two parts.  Part One, in addition to synthesizing the general history of rice in the region,  focuses on a specifi c population of Upper Guinea Coast residents – the Diola  of Guinea-Bissau – as they confront the challenges of a dramatically altered en- vironmental and economic landscape. Th eir experiences are unfolding at a time  of revitalized attention to agricultural development in Africa, particularly under  </page> <page sequence="2"> Rice and Revolution  175 the auspices of the New Green Revolution for Africa. Part Two then examines  this resuscitated eff ort to address the plight of African farmers. By fi rst setting the  stage with an ethnographic portrayal of a rice-based society coming to terms with  profound changes in its natural, social and religious world, I hope to give readers  a sense of the severe limitations of high modernist and antipolitical development  approaches to addressing the complexities of agrarian change and rural poverty  in postcolonial Africa.1 Part One: Sacred Rice After a few months of residency in a Diola village in north-western Guinea-Bissau,  I was deeply immersed in a life where rice dominates one’s actions, preoccupa- tions, even dreams. I had harvested ripe rice at the height of the dry season,  lugged baskets laden with freshly cut rice from the paddies to the village, helped  pound and winnow rice at my adopted family’s home, and cooked rice over wood  fi res in large pots of heavily salted water. I had eaten rice at least three times a day,  every day, sometimes served with small fi sh or a sauce of boiled hibiscus leaves,  but mostly plain rice – kutangu, as it is called in Crioulo – morning, afternoon  and night. I had eaten such rice not just in my daily meals but also in ceremo- nial contexts, when it was prepared in enormous pots and distributed among  participants who gathered in small groups around a shared tin bowl. I had seen  unhusked rice used to decorate funeral grounds, strung on cords connecting gi- gantic cottonwood trees and hung in bouquets around the central platform where  the corpse was seated. Small sachets of rice often encircled a young girl’s waist  at a neighbourhood dance, and celebrants at intervillage wrestling matches wore  delicately balanced bundles as headdresses. I had discussed rice with my neigh- bours and friends, or rather, listened as they spoke endlessly of rice, sometimes in  technical terms (seed variations, irrigation methods, transplantation practices),  sometimes in worried tones (‘there’s not enough rice to go around anymore’; ‘our  granaries are empty’) and sometimes in metaphorical tropes (‘our money is rice’;  ‘rice is our life’). Rice is omnipresent in Diola economic, social and symbolic life.  It is the centre of social gossip; people regularly discuss whose supply is abun- dant and whose is depleted. Rice is the medium of exchange during life-cycle  redistributive processes such as weddings, funerals and initiations. And rice is the  ticket to ritual power, as spirit shine ceremonies require abundant expenditures of  one’s crop. Diola lives, like those of most rice-growing people in this region, are  permeated by rice. Growing, eating, displaying, wearing, discussing and revering  rice. It was ubiquitous. When I closed my eyes at night, panicles of rice swayed  behind my eyelids. Scholars of the Diola have consistently off ered rich portrayals of this rice- oriented society. Even when rice is not their intended subject, its presence still  pervades their pages (see e.g. Almada 1964 [1594]; Baum 1999; Coelho 1953  </page> <page sequence="3"> 176  Joanna Davidson [1669]; Lauer 1969; Linares 1970, 1981, 1985, 1992; Mark 1985; Pélissier  1966; Th omas 1959, 1963). As Linares sums up, ‘Rice is the symbol of ethnicity,  of continuity, of all that is traditionally Diola. ... Rice keeps men tied to the  land, village-bound, and wholeheartedly peasant’ (Linares 1970: 223). I myself  did not go to the Diola region of northwest Guinea-Bissau to study rice. And yet,  ten years after my fi rst Diola rice harvest, I still fi nd myself returning again and  again to rice, not only as a central organizing feature of Diola social life but as the  ‘thing’ that mediates their encounters and exchanges with others, as well as their  refl ections and reassessments of themselves. Diola see rice as part of a covenant with their supreme deity, Emitai, in which  they work hard to cultivate the crop and Emitai sends rain to nourish it (see Baum  1999). Th roughout my fi eldwork in 2001–2003 and during my return visits over  the past eight years, I saw this covenant in action in Diola farmers’ arduous eff orts  in the rice paddies, their commitment to well-organized work groups at crucial  moments in the agricultural cycle, their regular libations – and occasional costly  sacrifi ces – at spirit shrines to propitiate their gods and bargain for rain, and their  careful child-rearing practices that socialize young people into an ethical life of  hard work and no theft (see Davidson 2007, 2009). I also heard these sentiments  regularly expressed in anthropomorphic and deistic references to rice. ‘Th e rice is  pregnant’, my work associates would note as we walked through a paddy. ‘Rice’,  my neighbours would tell me, ‘is sacred’.2 Th is concept of sacred rice is the centrepiece of Senegalese fi lmmaker Ous- mane Sembene’s portrayal of French colonial brutality in southern Senegal in  his 1971 fi lm Emitai. After conscripting young Diola men to fi ght in the French  army in World War II, colonial offi  cials demanded locally produced rice as a tax  from the Casamance Diola villagers so adept at producing a surplus. Despite the  otherwise caricatured portrayal of Diola religious life – elders sit amongst human  skulls and sacrifi ce animal after animal in order to appease their gods, while their  wives are held at gunpoint under a scorching sun until they hand over their rice  – Sembene did, I think, capture a central dilemma in Diola (and probably other  rice-cultivating peoples’) social and spiritual life. In addition to quite accurately  portraying the physical rhythms of rice cultivation, Sembene shows Diola strug- gling (and divided) over a thorny conundrum: How can they give away their rice,  which is sacred to them? And how could their gods abandon them – the humans  that propitiate them – for the sake of rice? Th is is encapsulated in perhaps the  most problematic scene, when the dying ‘chief ’ argues with the gods about what  is more valuable: Rice? Th e people? Th e gods themselves? Th ese questions never get answered and might still be asked today, although  under very diff erent circumstances. In Sembene’s fi lm, Diola were pressured to  give their surplus rice to the French colonial authorities, which they insisted  was a violation of their principle of ‘sacred rice’. In contemporary Diola-land in  Guinea-Bissau, the main problem is that Diola can no longer grow enough rice –  </page> <page sequence="4"> Rice and Revolution  177 not only to meet their ceremonial needs, or to have surplus for a potential tax,  but even to feed their families. Diola villagers are on the frontlines of global  climate change. Within the past thirty years, declining rainfall, desertifi cation  and widespread erosion in northern Guinea-Bissau have increasingly challenged  Diola villagers’ ability to provision themselves through the wet rice cultivation  practices that have long defi ned them as a people. Th ese environmental fac- tors have combined with neglectful and disadvantageous government policies  and programmes regarding rural development, diffi  cult marketing conditions,  and diminished labour capacity due to out-migration of youth, which all have  worsened conditions in rural rice-growing regions of the country. By the time  I arrived in Guinea-Bissau in 2001, most Diola villagers’ granaries were empty.  Many people regularly told me ‘We used to be able to do this’, referring to the  complex technical, social and ritual system by which Diola produce, consume  and revere rice. ‘Now we cannot.’ Rice as a Total Social Phenomenon Sacred rice is, above all, the idiom through which Diola talk about rice. Trans- lated into anthropological terms, rice for Diola is a total social phenomenon in  the classic Maussian sense. It mediates all social spheres and holds together the  contradictions across them. It is the means through which people present them- selves to themselves and others. In some senses, rice as a total social phenom- enon could refl ect one of the hallmarks of African agriculture more generally:  the ‘intense dependence of a people on a single crop’ whatever that crop may be  (Harlan, De Wet and Stemler 1976). Th at is, whether it is yams, sorghum, mil- let, or rice, the people cultivating these crops tend to be singularly and intensely  focused on them. African agriculture is characterized by a rather unusual number of dom- inant crops. In Arabic ’aish means ‘life,’ and in the Sudanic savanna the  word is applied to sorghum – the staff  of life, the source of sustenance.  Life without sorghum is unthinkable. To the north in the Sahel, ’aish  means ‘pearl millet.’ Life itself depends on pearl millet and pearl millet  alone, in that ecological zone. To the west around the Bend of the Niger,  the word may be applied to rice by some Arabic speakers. Certainly in  West Africa, from Senegambia to central Ivory Coast, a meal without  rice is considered no meal at all. Th e same intense dependence of a peo- ple on a single crop is found in the yam zone. Existence itself depends  on yams. In diff erent parts of the continent other dominant crops are  ensete, tef, and fonio. ... Th e current dependence of some people on  maize and others on cassava indicates that dependence on single crops  does not take long to establish. (Harlan et al. 1976: 14; see McCann  2005 for more on maize in Africa) </page> <page sequence="5"> 178  Joanna Davidson Diola villagers regularly invoke a recent past in which their mode of pro- duction yielded an abundance of surplus paddy rice, often stored for decades  and used in great quantities for ceremonial purposes. Th e decrease in rice stores  has already had signifi cant consequences for Diola ritual activities. Most shrine  ceremonies require copious paddy rice expenditures: ‘sack rice’ (as Diola call im- ported rice), even if it could be purchased in suffi  cient quantities, would not be  acceptable in most ritual contexts. Beyond its impact on ritual life, diminishing  crop yield has led to changes in what might be called the Diola social security sys- tem, particularly with regard to vulnerable segments of Diola society like widows.  Given the already strained situation of monogamous households providing for  their members, the levirate (botunabu) practice in which a widow and her chil- dren are customarily absorbed into her husband’s brother’s household has all but  disappeared, leaving increasing numbers of widows to fend for themselves on the  margins of society.3 And at the most basic level, decreased rice in Diola-land has  contributed to increased anxiety around sustenance, so that many Diola villagers  face a worrisome quotidian experience and a more intense working life in what  was already a taxing labour regime. In some ways, questions about Diola and their dominant crop are in the  same scholarly vein as other studies of the rise of particular crops and the way  they shape desires and dramatically shift economic and political structures (Mintz  1985; Kurlansky 2002; McCann 2005).4 Th ese writers focus on the role of a  single crop and its power to transform social, economic and cultural conditions  across vast and previously less connected parts of the globe.5 Other scholars have  provided rich portrayals not just of sugar, salt and maize, but also of the power  of rice in particular, both across the globe and within specifi c regions. Th e his- tory of rice is often told with a focus on its abundance and adaptation across  various ecological and political landscapes. Within West Africa too, scholars have  focused on the importance and innovation of rice in enabling societies in this  region to survive and often thrive (Carney 2001; Hawthorne 2003; Fields-Black  2008). Such accounts solidify the historic roots of rice in the Upper Guinea  Coast and attest to the sophisticated technology that supported its growth as  the region’s dominant crop. Th ey are, for the most part, rice success stories. Th e  Upper Guinea Coast is cast as a site of agricultural and social innovation, whether  in Hawthorne’s (2003) account of how, in the face of the Atlantic slave trade, a  stateless society had the resilience to develop the internal social institutions that  enabled it to increase rice production; or in Carney’s (2001) epic portrayal of the  contribution of West Africans – especially women – to the Americas through  their ‘rice knowledge system.’ It is now well established that West Africans domesticated and cultivated  rice for thousands of years, long before the arrival of the Europeans who were  assumed to have brought both the seeds and know-how of rice agriculture to  West African coastal peoples. Th e last several decades have seen a fl ourishing of  </page> <page sequence="6"> Rice and Revolution  179 infl uential studies of rice in Africa and in Atlantic studies more broadly, rectifying  many of the biased assumptions in previous understandings – both scholarly and  popular – of rice’s origins and importance as located exclusively in Asia. A consid- erable literature now attests to rice’s important role in shaping societies on both  sides of the Atlantic. Th e weight of evidence – historical (Pélessier 1966; Lauer  1969; Alpern 2008), botanical (Portères 1970, 1976; Harlan et al. 1976), clima- tological (G. Brooks 1985), geographical (Cormier-Salem 1999), archaeological  (Linares 1971, 2002), linguistic (Fields-Black 2008), political-ecological (Rich- ards 1985, 1986) and genealogical (Carney 2001, 2004)  – restores rice history  to its proper place in West Africa, even if the extension of such accounts across  the Atlantic into New World systems continues to be debated (Eltis, Morgan and  Richardson 2007). Th at rice was grown 3,500 years ago in the Niger delta; that it  diff used to two secondary centres; that both the plant and the people adapted to  particular saline, insalubrious, unpredictable conditions to thrive in a challenging  landscape and develop a range of rice planting methods; that rice production  even increased, in some cases, in spite of the ravages of the Atlantic slave trade  (Hawthorne 2003) – all of this is now, unlike the semiaquatic rice plant itself,  on terra fi rma. Carney’s (2001) watershed study consolidates such evidence to demonstrate  Africans’ roles in developing both the domesticated rice plant, Oryza glaberrima,  and the highly sophisticated water management systems, cultivation techniques  and trademark tools involved in successfully growing the crop in a tricky and  unpredictable environment, long before European infl uence in the area. Building  on Wood (1974) and Littlefi eld (1981), Carney breaks the narrative of African  rice out of its relegated confi nement to West Africa as something of ‘local im- portance and antiquarian interest’ (Sauer 1993), and provides African rice with a  travel narrative as compelling as the more familiar accounts charted for the Asian  cultigen. As in Asia, African people moving across the oceans to diff erent ecosys- tems – whether of their own volition or not – brought with them both the seeds  and the skills to transform environments, economies and societies anywhere they  went (and anywhere they left behind). Putting aside her more controversial extension of this argument, which fo- cuses on the infl uence of this indigenous African ‘rice knowledge system’ in the  Americas via the Atlantic slave trade,6 I want to take up a point emphasized by  Carney and others writing in her wake regarding the development of rice ag- riculture in West Africa, and ask about its implications today. Carney (2001),  Hawthorne (2003) and Fields-Black (2008) each emphasize the innovative qual- ities of rice cultivation in the Upper Guinea Coast as a technologically ingen- ious approach in a challenging mangrove ecosystem, particularly in terms of its  sophisticated crue/décrue method of water management (Carney 2001: 40–46;  Fields-Black 2008), and its socially innovative responses to the pressures of the  Atlantic slave trade (Hawthorne 2003). Whereas these authors aimed to establish  </page> <page sequence="7"> 180  Joanna Davidson a solid historical basis for rice-oriented cultures and their continual adaptation  to myriad challenges – Mandinga expansion, European slave raiding, colonially  enforced cash cropping, shaky transitions to independence and throughout all, a  fl uctuating set of environmental conditions and unpredictable pattern of rainfall  – my experience as an ethnographer among Diola rice cultivators in postcolonial  Guinea-Bissau leads me to ask: what now? For the past ten years I have seen Diola respond to the decrease in rain and  rice in varied, mostly highly individualized ways. Th e average household is able  to produce only enough rice to last three months, and when you ask most Di- ola how they get by, they respond by saying ‘kuji-kuji, son’, referring to what  chickens do to fi nd insects and grubs for their day-to-day survival. Th ey scrape  together what they can to buy a kilo of imported Asian rice, which, though it  cannot be used for ceremonial purposes, has become acceptable to eat. Another  common strategy among adult Diola – those with families to care for – is to work  harder and to scold (and often punish) those who shift their primary allegiance  away from rice cultivation and towards other livelihood strategies (see Davidson  2009). Some Diola have invested in spirit shrine ceremonies to contract for more  rain. Others have sought new religious identities and institutions – Catholic and  Protestant are the two options available in the area – that enable both access to  new resources and a religiously sanctioned opt-out from ‘traditional’ strictures  that require exclusive devotion to rice.  Increasingly, Diola families invest in schooling for their children and pin  their hopes for the future on their children’s academic success. But in Guinea- Bissau, school is a fragile thing to pin one’s hopes to. Some unexpected hurdles  have complicated the practice of sending adolescent girls to schools outside the  village: most have come back as pregnant drop-outs. Meanwhile, boys’ studies  are often interrupted by political turmoil or lack of economic wherewithal, and  as they wait around in the capital for a resumption they not only cannot con- tribute their much-needed labour back home but also become far more likely to  lead precarious lives, particularly in a nation where drug traffi  cking is ever more  entrenched and off ers one of the only viable economic alternatives to an arduous  (and food-insecure) rural life and a paralyzed (and unfulfi lled) postsecondary  school urban life. All of these strategies refl ect eff orts among the Diola to confront their collec- tive dilemma: who are we without our rice? For now, Diola are hungry – some  of them literally so, as they struggle to feed themselves and their families; oth- ers more metaphorically, as they search for new paths to social security through  schooling, new religious institutions and escape. Comprehending this hunger as  it connects the physical body to the social body contributes to our understanding  of the complex dynamics of agrarian life. But beyond a mere academic exercise,  this understanding has implications for development policies and practices tar- geted at Diola and other agrarian populations on the Upper Guinea Coast and  </page> <page sequence="8"> Rice and Revolution  181 beyond. Th e interpenetration of rice across all social domains requires any devel- opment response – particularly in increasingly food-insecure regions – to take  into account the totalizing quality of rice agriculture. Th e concomitant challenge  for scholars is not just to articulate this complexity, but to do so while pragmat- ically engaging both the anxieties of present-day rice farmers and an agricul- tural development discourse that is disproportionately focused on effi  ciency and  quantity. Part Two: Th e Institutional History of  Rice Science and Agricultural Development Th e outlook on the future of rice in West Africa must, of course, go hand in hand  with a historical view of the decreasing self-suffi  ciency of what was once called  the Rice Coast, which leads to an examination of the shift from staple to cash  crops during the colonial era in Africa, and the continued de-emphasis on agri- cultural development in the postcolonial period. Once defi ned by its abundant  rice production, the Upper Guinea Coast has seen a dramatic increase in rice  imports over the past half century. Colonial policies shifted African agricultural  eff orts away from food crops for local sustenance towards cash crops for Euro- pean consumption. Newly independent African nations in the 1960s and 1970s  declared their intention to attain self-suffi  ciency in food production, framing  such a goal as a pragmatic approach to meet the demands of population growth  and address Africa’s marginal position in the international market on the one  hand, and as a political and symbolic reversal of the colonial project on the other.  But since independence, the increased infl uence of the cash economy, combined  with rapid demographic shifts and a concomitant focus on urban development,  have conspired to keep rural development eff orts in a marginalized position vis- à-vis large-scale improvement schemes, and food imports have only increased.  Th e trend of importing basic staples, especially rice, accelerated rapidly in the  early 1970s owing to two main factors: the Sahelian drought, and the availability  of cheaper rice on the international market due to surplus yields in Asia – the  fruit of the new intensive approaches and high-yield seed varieties of the Green  Revolution. Th us, in the independence era, ‘the amount of rice imported into  West Africa increased from 276,000 tons/year in 1960–1964 to 496,000 tons/ year in 1970–1974, an increase of 80%, at a time when total world rice exports  were unchanged’ (Aw 1978: 71). Despite Guinea-Bissau’s stated commitment to  boost rice self-suffi  ciency (Da Silva 1978), its rice imports have steadily increased  since independence (Temudo 2011).7 To answer post-independence Africa’s call for self-suffi  ciency in rice produc- tion, the West African Rice Development Association (WARDA), based in Mon- rovia, Liberia, was established in 1971 and later joined the Consultative Group  for International Agricultural Research (CGIAR). WARDA, one of several agri- </page> <page sequence="9"> 182  Joanna Davidson cultural research and development centres dedicated to improving the yields of  African farmers, was the only one focused exclusively on rice. Since its establish- ment in 1971, WARDA has been a moveable feast, relocating from Liberia to  Côte d’Ivoire to Mali and fi nally to Benin in response to the eruption of violent  confl icts across this swath of West Africa. In 2009 it offi  cially changed its name  to Africa Rice Centre (AfricaRice). Tracing WARDA’s movements across West  Africa, as well as its shifting position within the wider world of international ag- ricultural development, would illuminate much about the politics of postcolonial  development in West Africa, although such an exploration is beyond the scope  of this chapter. Th ough conscious of the particularities of the environmental, political and  cultural factors that condition rural development work in West Africa, WARDA  largely follows the model of other agricultural research and development entities  by focusing on the technical aspects of growing rice. Th e characteristic approach  of agricultural development since the Green Revolution, and even before, has  been to apply the latest innovations in agricultural science – especially plant  breeding, fertilizers and irrigation – to impoverished rural communities across  the world, and move agricultural production from sustenance to surplus to sale.  Generally couched in the development discourse of poverty eradication and food  security, the goals are primarily quantitative – higher yields, more crop per drop –  and even though the latest iteration of the Green Revolution for Africa has incor- porated the language of sustainability and gender into its rhetoric, the creation of  high-yield seeds continues to be the holy grail of rural development. WARDA’s chief contribution in this vein has been the development of New  Rice for Africa (NERICA) varieties – the fi rst successful hybrids of Oryza sativa  and Oryza glaberrima – which are being distributed to rice cultivating popula- tions across the continent. NERICA was fi rst named ‘wide crossing’ to high- light the achievement of bringing together two rice species from widely divergent  sources (Walsh 2001). It also refl ects a shift in attitudes towards African indige- nous rice, long considered inferior and marginal by rice breeding programmes.  As Walsh explains, looking back on several decades of rice breeding eff orts,  WARDA scientists realized that their gains had been limited by the concentra- tion on imported grains, so they began to ‘reclaim glaberrima’ – analysing the  long-ignored indigenous rice species to see what could be learned from its long  history and adaptation to West African conditions (Walsh 2001). A senior plant  geneticist at WARDA described the process as ‘time consuming, but ... worth  doing because eventually we are going to get an interspecifi c hybrid that will  combine important traits between glaberrima and sativa’ (Walsh 2001: 65). And  it did indeed pay off , at least in terms of scientifi c recognition, when WARDA  won the prestigious King Baudouin International Agriculture Research Award for  NERICA in 2000. Hopes began to soar regarding the possibility of revitalizing  rice production across the continent. </page> <page sequence="10"> Rice and Revolution  183 In some senses, NERICA brings the epic journey of rice full circle. It is now  generally accepted that Oryza sativa and Oryza glaberrima shared a common pro- genitor, and that the genus Oryza originated on the Gondwanaland superconti- nent before becoming widely distributed across the tropics. From this image of  a common origin in a geologically conjoined world, followed by a long history  of independent domestication and cultivation to the point of attempted crosses  between the two species – O. sativa and O. glaberrima – that proved sterile, and  to a subsequent ‘colonization’ of African rice by the Asian variety in glaberrima’s  homeland, we have fi nally circled back to a conjoining (though of a diff erent  kind, conjured in the laboratory) that brings Asia and Africa together again in  the microcosm of a single grain, rhetorically touted as the ‘best of Africa mixed  with the best of Asia’, on which hopes of feeding a hungry world are pinned. ‘Th e  NERICA rice varieties,’ states a recent comprehensive publication on rice, ‘off er  great hope to the next generation in Africa’ (Badawi et al. 2010: 404). It is precisely this hope that is fuelling a major set of international devel- opment initiatives directed squarely at rural Africa: the New Green Revolution  for Africa. Th e remainder of this chapter will explore some of the premises, pro- grammes and players that constitute this reincarnation of the Green Revolution.8  Drawing on the previous sections that developed a Maussian understanding of  rice in Diola and other agrarian societies, I will outline some of my concerns  about this new – and rapidly expanding – trend in development policy and prac- tice for postcolonial Africa. Th e recent revitalized focus on agriculture is framed as a corrective to the  largely failed urban-based rapid-modernization approach that has dominated in- ternational donor policy and practice for many decades. Spearheaded by former  UN Secretary General Kofi  Annan and funded by philanthropy giants such as  the Gates Foundation, the architects and planners of the New Green Revolution  for Africa seek to fulfi l Africa’s post-independence promise of self-suffi  ciency and  turn Africa’s image around from a ‘basket case to a breadbasket’ (Cartridge and  Leraand 2006: 109). Gates programme offi  cers and Alliance for a Green Revolution in Africa  (AGRA) offi  cials speak enthusiastically about this New Green Revolution’s po- tential to succeed in Africa, where so many other development eff orts have failed  (AGRA-Alliance 2014). In one AGRA plant geneticist’s recent summation: ‘For  a long time, I don’t think we knew how to solve Africa’s agricultural problems.  But the answer is a second green revolution’ (Rieff  2008: 30). African Green Rev- olution planners have attended to some of the more egregious errors of the last  Green Revolution and integrated some general changes in public consciousness  and development practice since the 1960s and 1970s into its goals and methods.  For instance, far more attention is paid to environmentally sustainable practices,  the stated objective of focusing on women and the stated intention to ‘learn from  farmers’. Almost every document and speech on the Green Revolution in Africa  </page> <page sequence="11"> 184  Joanna Davidson is careful to point out the ‘specifi cally African’ challenges in undertaking such  eff orts, often emphasizing Africa’s ‘diversity’ and ‘complexity’ of seeds, soil and  climate. Other ‘uniquely African’ challenges are often compiled into a laundry  list featuring drought, global warming, water shortages, lack of fi nance, local  confl icts, political neglect, unfavourable trade conditions, unstable governments,  fragile economies and infrastructure, technological stagnation, a weak private  sector, the HIV/AIDS epidemic, a harsh and often inhospitable climate and en- vironment, and low levels of foreign investment and aid. Despite this long (albeit  incomplete) list and the repeated recognition that Africa’s challenges are ‘extraor- dinarily complex and profoundly diff erent’ from those that confronted Asia and  Latin America, the core principles and models of the previous Green Revolution  remain intact for the ‘genuinely African’ Green Revolution: high-yield seeds, bet- ter and more fertilizer, access to markets (AGRA-Alliance 2009). I am concerned about this substantial investment in Green Revolution pro- jects in Africa on a number of levels. On the surface, I am hopeful that renewed  attention to rural Africans could be benefi cial, especially given the increasing  challenges I presented at the beginning of this essay and the long-standing ne- glect of African smallholders in national, international and NGO development  priorities. But I am worried that much of the New Green Revolution rhetoric  echoes some of the more problematic (and ultimately dangerous) assumptions of  past Green Revolutions and other attempts at agricultural change in Africa and  elsewhere. At the most basic level, African Green Revolution documents tend to treat  rural development in Africa as a tabula rasa and demonstrate very little concern  with (or even knowledge of ) the abundant analyses and attempted (and largely  failed) interventions into African rural poverty in the past. Only negligibly do  they acknowledge the wealth of scholarship – concentrated in the 1980s – on  how post-World War II Africa lost its capacity to feed itself, and more generally  on how larger colonial and postcolonial international economic and political sys- tems were among the causes of Africa’s current agricultural problems. Quite the  contrary, leaders of the New Green Revolution come across as impatient with  such ‘background information’. Jeff rey Sachs and Pedro Sanchez of the Earth  Institute – called on by AGRA to develop some of the intellectual muscle for the  African Green Revolution – have continually pressed for urgent action rather  than deliberate and methodical discussion. Sachs emphasized recently that ‘Africa  needs its Green Revolution and it can’t wait. Africa can feed itself if farmers get  the inputs they need – what theory are we waiting for? ... We have the tools to  get the job done’ (Cartridge and Leraand 2006: 122). Th is general impatience is reminiscent of an earlier era of agricultural devel- opment work. Buttressed by the belief that rapid widespread action not bogged  down by generative criticism or participatory methodologies was justifi ed, given  the otherwise imminent starvation of a rapidly increasing population, previous  </page> <page sequence="12"> Rice and Revolution  185 agricultural development experts were dismissive of the particularity and com- plexity of farmers’ expressed needs and desires, often retorting that ‘beggars ought  not to be choosers’ (Richards 1985: 124). But rural Africa is littered with the  failed schemes of such hurried approaches to agricultural development. Teleological Development, Again Besides failing to do their homework and dismissing critical perspectives, African  Green Revolution adherents repeat a faulty teleological understanding of devel- opment. Th e premise behind Green Revolution programmes is that a productive  agricultural sector will lead to national economic growth. Th is is often bolstered  with historical evidence from eighteenth-century England, nineteenth-century  Japan and twentieth-century India (Hazell and Diao 2005; Båge 2008). Kofi  Annan emphasized this point in his speech to the delegates at the 2007 Afri- can Green Revolution conference in Oslo: ‘Virtually no country in history has  achieved economic progress and improved the lives of its people without fi rst  advancing agriculture. Th at certainly applies to our continent’ (Annan 2007).  Th e proceedings from the fi rst Oslo conference put it even more starkly: Africa  is ‘Trapped’ (in poverty) and in ‘Trouble’ (cannot feed its people), and its ‘Time  has come. After decades of failed attempts at economic and social development,  agriculture has been declared the engine of economic growth and poverty reduc- tion in Africa ... Africa has no time to waste’ (Cartridge and Leraand 2006: 28;  capital letters in original). Th e argument, then, is that every successful society has had to pass through  some kind of agricultural transformation, and that previous development eff orts  in Africa failed because they played leapfrog over agriculture and attended to in- dustrial and urban development before their time. In the 2006 Oslo proceedings,  a caption underneath a photograph of two African men driving a tractor through  a large cultivated fi eld reads: ‘Agriculture is commonly considered a locomotive  for economic growth in Africa...’ (Cartridge and Leraand 2006: 42). Africa re- mains ‘a predominantly agricultural continent’, and ‘neglecting this overarching  importance of agriculture’ accounts for Africa’s status as the worst-off  continent  on the planet (ibid.: 41). So, the thinking goes, if you get agriculture right, the  rest (ending hunger and poverty, modernization, economic growth, etc.) will fol- low. New Green Revolution advocates criticize previous development eff orts that  have tried to ‘impose a post-agricultural revolution strategy on Africa before its  own agricultural revolution has happened. ... Th e lessons from Asia and else- where seem clear: Africa needs a concerted eff ort to accelerate smallholder-led  agricultural development ... only then can the transition to industrialization be  expected to succeed’ (Hazell and Diao 2005: 25). Th is teleological approach reinforces an evolutionary development narra- tive in which each society must pass through the phases that supposedly more  ‘advanced’ ones withstood on the road to progress. Not only is this historically  </page> <page sequence="13"> 186  Joanna Davidson inaccurate, but it misrepresents Africa as an entire continent ‘not ready, not yet,  not quite’ for other kinds of development eff orts. Instead of recognizing a ‘full  house’ of variation (Ferguson 1999), New Green Revolution leaders insist that ‘as  African countries develop and diversify, the other sectors will become important  sources of tradables output and agriculture’s role as the primary engine of growth  will diminish. But other sectors are not yet ready to play that role on the scale  required’ (Hazell and Diao 2005: 29). Africa must therefore stick to the linear  progression of social change: agriculture fi rst, then industry. ‘As countries develop  and labor becomes scarcer relative to land and capital, [this leads to] a natural  transition towards larger farms and an exodus of small farm workers to towns and  nonfarm jobs’ (Hazell and Diao 2005: 29; emphasis added). Th ere is nothing ‘natural’ about this transition. Such thinking not only re- peats outmoded clichés of the move from traditional to modern, rural to urban,  subsistence to monetized economy, but also ignores a recent trend in the so-called  advanced or ‘post-agricultural’ societies that challenges this linear development  model. Faced with increasing evidence that ‘natural’ transitions from small-scale  farming to large-scale industrial and commercial agribusiness contribute signif- icantly to environmental degradation, food scares and public health epidemics  of obesity and other chronic diseases, Europeans and North Americans are ever  more dissatisfi ed with large-scale food production. A spreading movement to  return to alternative agriculture is visible in the growth of community-supported  agriculture, the Slow Food movement, locavores, the celebrity-like popularity of  Michael Pollan and other such trends. Perhaps this is an agricultural revolution in  the other sense of the word; that is, coming full circle to an appreciation of local  tastes and practices, environmentally sensitive farming and other characteristics  that have long been prominent among the rural African peasantry. Means and Ends; Techniques and Contexts Another problematic aspect of the ‘agriculture-led economic development’ par- adigm is that it subsumes agriculture as a means to a more desirable end, deni- grating the value of agriculture in and of itself. A more productive agricultural  sector supposedly paves the way to a post-agricultural world (as if such a thing  could really exist). As a USAID offi  cial noted: ‘If a process like an agriculture  revolution works, it explicitly gets people to leave agriculture. It does! You are  creating jobs that are more attractive...’ (quoted in Cartridge and Leraand 2006:  103). To be sure, many farmers in Africa and around the world have hopes for  their children that include nonfarm jobs. But why preclude the possibility that  agriculture itself can be desirable? Th e assumption that agriculture is something  to be left behind on the road to progress – something you work your way out of  – reinforces agriculture’s low status on the evolutionary ladder and recapitulates  the very image that for so long made rural smallholder concerns look ‘unsexy’ to  global development agendas (a view that New Green Revolution advocates claim  </page> <page sequence="14"> Rice and Revolution  187 they are trying to reverse). From my own work among Diola rice cultivators, it is  clear that although Diola farmers often complain about their declining capacity  to sustain their households, they are proud of their continued hard work in the  rice paddies. Even those with supposedly more desirable jobs, like teachers, iden- tify fi rst and foremost (and proudly) as farmers. By regarding food production  as ‘unspectacular’, Green Revolution proponents continue to ‘misunderstand the  nature of both the agriculture and the politics of communities where food pro- duction is a major interest’ (Richards 1985: 116). Agriculture is not only devalued as a means to an end but reduced to a set  of techniques, as something to be tinkered with and fi xed. Although not sexy  to developers, agriculture is like sex in the Foucauldian sense of the care of the  self: it is a practice that can be practised (i.e. improved). With the right inputs  – science and technology, seeds and fertilizers – agriculture can be transformed.  Th e overriding approach of the Green Revolution (past and present) is primarily  biological and technological, and operates under the assumption that agricultural  processes can be extracted from their political and social contexts. Th is view is  encoded in Green Revolution discourse, institutions and practices. Most of its  leaders – donors and practitioners alike – are economists or agricultural experts  (or both); there are few if any social scientists (let alone anthropologists, let alone  small-scale farmers) in their ranks.9 Th eir approach to agricultural transformation  ignores the long history of social and political circumstances that help explain  why African agriculture is experiencing diffi  culties, even as it occludes a picture  of agriculture embedded in complex modes of social organization, moral econo- mies, arrangements of power and religious beliefs and practices. As we have seen  for Diola – and as has been documented for other agrarian groups – agricultural  work is not simply a means of sustenance but is integrally tied to conceptions of  personhood, social relations, ritual obligations and collective cultural identity.  Tinkering with any piece of their cultivation practices has signifi cant ramifi ca- tions for all of these realms. Agriculture is necessarily a biological and social process, but the Green Revo- lution’s exclusive emphasis on research and technology sets the social side of this  equation aside. Th is bias is built into the elitist research culture of the Green Rev- olution. In the Asian and Latin American iterations, International Agricultural  Research Centers concentrated the brightest talents in a single place equipped  with the best research facilities, and in so doing removed them from exactly the  geographical and sociological contexts where they would be most connected to  the needs and realities of farmers, and in which they were meant to implement  their scientifi c discoveries. Such practices are replicated in Gates’s support of Cor- nell and other seed research centres and even showcased on AGRA’s website in  images of African scientists surrounded by the accoutrements of modern, high- tech scientifi c legitimacy: white lab coats, safety goggles and pristine laborato- ries lined with neatly labelled beakers. But these environments insulate Green  </page> <page sequence="15"> 188  Joanna Davidson Revolution practitioners from the real-time agricultural environment and on- farm knowledge, practice and experience (both biological and social). Th ey also  obfuscate the social and political aspects of agrarian change (e.g. land reform, the  social organization of labour and national price setting, to name just a few). Th is  may have the unfortunate consequence of repeating the problems and failures of  previous applications of ‘pure science’ to agricultural challenges. Beyond seed science, one of the innovations New Green Revolution leaders  are most excited about is the development of a corps of agro-dealers to bring  high-yield seeds and improved fertilizer – what used to be called the biological  package – to isolated, rural farmers.10 Replacing the infamous extension agent  as the travelling salesman of the Green Revolution, these agro-dealers would be  culled from the existing merchants who peddle their wares in outlying villages,  thus solving (or at least circumventing) the problems presented by the lack of  an African transportation infrastructure. But the assumption that the existing  petty-merchant class can sell new seeds and other agricultural products (and even  train farmers how to use them) exposes a serious misunderstanding of social and  ethnic relations in parts of rural Africa. In the Upper Guinea Coast, farming  populations generally regard the petty traders who would be recruited into the  agro-dealer corps with deep misgivings and mistrust, and certainly do not rec- ognize them for their knowledge of agriculture. I was often told a well-known  rural legend about sneaky peddlers (they are always Fula in the Guinea-Bissau  version of this story) who sold glass marbles to gullible rice cultivators, claiming  that if they were planted and tended to, they would grow into coveted glass  bottles after the rainy season. Th is anecdote is often told to highlight the naiveté  of ‘traditional’ and ‘backward’ farmers, or to explain the roots of the enduring  animosity between landowning farmers and itinerant merchants, or to prove that  such merchants are inherently untrustworthy – or, usually, some combination of  these. Many similar stories abound, testifying that relations between farmers and  would-be agro-dealers are already tense. Any investment of funding and expecta- tions in agro-dealers as the conduits through which newly developed high-yield  seeds, fertilizer and agricultural know-how will reach rural farmers and transform  agricultural productivity further exposes the naiveté – or at least the lack of atten- tion to on-the-ground social relations – of Green Revolution architects. Scientifi c and Indigenous Knowledge One of the key resolutions of the fi rst African Green Revolution conference in  Oslo is to ensure ‘targeted research and transfer of Science and Technology to  farmers’ (Oslo Conference 2006; capital letters in original). Other resolutions, re- dressing previous Green Revolution gaps, include commitments to crop diversity  and the role of women in agriculture. But the emphasis is unmistakably on bring- ing science and technology to the ‘unknowing’ African smallholder. Again, such  an approach carries forward the perspective in which African farmers occupy  </page> <page sequence="16"> Rice and Revolution  189 an earlier stage of evolutionary history, and claims that ‘the key to agricultural  development in Africa lies in “technology transfer” – the importation of “appro- priate” agricultural inputs from tropical regions held to be more “advanced” on  the evolutionary scale’ (Richards 1985: 43). Along with the prejudicial implications of such a view, the continued belief  that laboratory science leads agricultural innovation is countered by countless  examples of agricultural researchers reinventing traditional African agriculture  by, for instance, ‘discovering’ the value of West African farming techniques like  ‘bush burning’, integrated use of valley and upland holdings, intercropping and  land-rotation fallowing. Science has often followed such innovations rather than  led them. As Paul Richards notes, ‘high technology’ initiatives throughout the  colonial and postcolonial era had minimal and often counterproductive impact,  and their failures were remedied – in numerous cases from Nigeria, Sierra Le- one, Liberia, the Gambia and Senegal – by reinstating local cultivation practices  (Richards 1985; see also Richards et al. 2009; Nuijten et al. 2009; Off ei et al.  2010). Th e reincarnation of the Green Revolution for Africa has attended to some  of the previous biases against indigenous knowledge in its commitment to ‘listen  to farmers’. As an AGRA programme offi  cer states, Th ere is also a lot to be learned from the farmer. You develop ideas about  what you think the farmer should do to solve their problem, but maybe  that is not the farmer’s problem. ... So, for us agriculturists, we may be  telling the farmers what chemical to use or how to control the storage  pests or how we can develop a resistant variety, but the farmers know  what they have been doing and they may have abandoned a method that  works. ... So if you have an interaction between you and the farmer, you  will come to learn what the farmer really wants. (AGRA-Alliance 2009) While these lessons learned from the hubris of the previous Green Revolution  refl ect what I believe are sincere intentions to incorporate indigenous knowl- edge and smallholders’ concerns into agricultural development projects (even  though, as mentioned above, other dynamics of Green Revolution culture and  practice militate against this very process), such a bland and general intention to  ‘learn from farmers’ exposes yet another naïve assumption on the part of Green  Revolution agro-economists: that indigenous knowledge is ripe for the picking,  readily available to whichever plant geneticist or grant portfolio manager might  ask about it. But one of the reasons behind the continuing stereotype and misrep- resentation of the ‘conservative risk-averse farmer’ is that agrarian communities  have ‘often misled outsiders into thinking that not much was going on’ (Richards  1985: 111). It is often to farmers’ advantage to keep a low profi le and maintain  the image of a subsistence backwater: such a projected image fends off  the tax  </page> <page sequence="17"> 190  Joanna Davidson collector and others interested in taking a share of what is often a thriving trade  in foodstuff s (see Richards 1985). Even more so, some agrarian societies have deeply ingrained formal and in- formal communicative strategies that make access to agricultural knowledge –  or really any relevant knowledge regarding farmers’ circumstances – extremely  diffi  cult to obtain. Various rice farming groups expend a great deal of time and  energy managing knowledge about themselves and about the natural and super- natural world (Ferme 2001; Sarró 2009; Davidson 2010). Th eir commitment to  a particular scheme of information fl ow – based largely on secrecy, evasion and  restraint – challenges even the most culturally sensitive development policies and  practices, and certainly makes ‘learning from farmers’ more complicated than the  AGRA programme offi  cer would lead us believe. Conclusions My goal in outlining some of my concerns with the New Green Revolution for  Africa is not to dismiss eff orts to reach out to African farmers or, more broadly,  address pressing problems of entrenched rural poverty in Africa. Rather, I want  to point out some ways in which current well-funded, powerful eff orts to shape  the agenda for accomplishing these aims might benefi t from a closer analysis of  the assumptions underlying such endeavours, whether encased in the rhetori- cal, institutional or programmatic aspects of African Green Revolution initia- tives. Although the language is more sophisticated, these New Green Revolution  approaches smuggle in many of the last Green Revolution’s teleological and  evolutionary models of social change, and – despite regular references to ‘local  knowledge’ and ‘political will’ – continue to treat agriculture as a set of tech- niques outside complex social, political and religious contexts. As Pedro Sanchez from the Earth Institute confi rmed: ‘Th e African Green  Revolution is not a proposal, it’s on, it’s happening now. Agriculture is back on  donors’ and governments’ agendas and it is being acknowledged as one of the key  factors in Africa’s future’ (Cartridge and Leraand 2006: 109). Given that the train  has already left the station, the question then becomes how anthropologists and  others concerned about the more problematic aspects of Green Revolutionary  practice can engage it constructively – particularly when interlocutors are resis- tant to criticism and eager to claim the moral high ground of poverty eradication  – without being either relegated to the role of naysayers or mired in the ‘ineff ec- tive particularities of ethnographic detail’ that continue to make anthropologists  ‘bystanders in the wider arena of discussions about “Africa”’ (Ferguson 2006: 3).  Will social scientists once again be consigned to the task of documenting the  validity of indigenous knowledge for an audience that is enamoured with (and  has the resources and power to bring about) change through technology, ‘pure  science’ and market access? How can we best bring anthropological and historical  </page> <page sequence="18"> Rice and Revolution  191 knowledge to bear on what will be signifi cant changes – and perhaps major op- portunities or high-stakes follies – for rural Africans? Th e story of rice and rice-oriented societies on the Upper Guinea Coast in- vites us to take a very long view of historical change. Rice was domesticated 3,500  years ago as an innovative response to a drying climate. Mangrove rice cultivation  in particular represents an ingenious way to engineer an otherwise inhospitable  landscape. Even the pressures of the Atlantic slave trade catalysed – in some cases  – the consolidation of otherwise dispersed populations and led to an increase in  output of rice. As Ohnuki-Tierney notes for the Japanese, ‘rice paddies objec- tify time’ (1993: 133). Th ey evoke seasonality in the rhythms of planting and  harvesting, they speak to cyclical patterns of rain and drought, and they express  the history and memories of ancestors in their lineage-based tenure and their  well-maintained ridges. What they will look like and represent in the future is  unclear, especially given the odds of climate change, geopolitical marginality and  a skewed globalized economy. As stated above, one of the goals of the African Green Revolution is to turn  Africa from a ‘basket case to a breadbasket’ (Cartridge and Leraand 2006: 109).  Rather than being ‘genuinely African’, this aims to make Africa more like Iowa.  An immediate countermeasure would involve shifting our attention away from  old chestnuts like the impressive ‘adaptive’ strategies of rural smallholders and to- wards a better understanding of the conditions in which agricultural innovation  thrives, by building on Paul Richards’s call to ‘stimulate vigorous “indigenous sci- ence” and “indigenous technology”’ (Richards 1985: 12). But a next step would  involve moving beyond a science narrowly conceived on the basis of the origin  of the scientist. A ‘genuinely African’ Green Revolution is not about enabling  Africans to occupy positions in pristine laboratories, but it could be about recon- ceptualizing the character of science itself.  Th e nature of the science that has undergirded Green Revolutions from  eighteenth-century Europe to 1970s Latin America and Asia is a classic example  of Scott’s (1998) notion of high modernism in science. It is characterized not  only by its constant confi dence that science and technology (and resolute reliance  on the expertise of scientists and bureaucrats) will attend to problems in the nat- ural and social world, but also by its indiff erence to cultural, historical and social  complexities and particularities. By narrowly focusing on a single problem (ag- ricultural production), black-boxing uncertainty and complexity, and generally  overlooking or externalizing negative by-products, high-modernist science has  continually shown itself to be irrelevant, inapplicable and ultimately resulting in  failure more often than not (see S. Brooks 2010). It is also a deeply antipolitical  approach to agricultural development (Ferguson 1994). If we opt not to follow  that script for another chapter in Africa, perhaps Scott’s call for a ‘métis’ vision  of practical knowledge points us in the right direction. Th e experiences of Diola  rice farmers and the totalizing quality of rice in their societies remind us that Af- </page> <page sequence="19"> 192  Joanna Davidson rican agricultural transformation requires a commitment to engage in agriculture  not as a means to an end, but as a practice integrally linked to and informed by  culture, ecology, politics, social organization and other dimensions of agrarian  life not readily encapsulated by the tunnel-vision goals of a high-modernist and  antipolitical approach to development. Joanna Davidson is an assistant professor in the Department of Anthropology  at Boston University. Her research in Guinea-Bissau has focused on Diola rice  cultivators and their responses to environmental and economic change. She is the  author of Sacred Rice: An Ethnography of Identity, Environment, and Development  in Rural West Africa (Oxford University Press, 2016). Notes  1. Th is essay is a revised version of an article published in June 2012 as ‘Basket Cases and  Breadbaskets: Sacred Rice and Agricultural Development in Postcolonial Africa’, Culture,  Agriculture, Food and Environment (CAFÉ) 34(1): 15–32.  2. Many rice-cultivating people consider rice sacred in diff erent ways (see Grist 1959;  Ohnuki-Tierney 1993; United Nations Offi  ce at Geneva 2004).  3. Th e dynamics around shifting levirate practices and the status of widows are quite com- plex, and I do not have room in this chapter to detail them. For now, what is important  is to acknowledge that decreasing rice supplies play an important part in the changes in  social organization concerning widows.  4. McCann’s (2005) study of maize provides further evidence in support of the observation  that a hallmark feature of African agriculture is its loyalty to a single crop, even one of  recent provenance.  5. I am inspired by, and hopefully building upon, such works. But my similar focus on a sin- gle crop – rice, in this case – does not lead me to the same type of dramatic, far-reaching  arguments about the transformation of civilizations and geopolitical order across multiple  continents. Although my background discussion of rice – its origins, travels, widespread  use and future expectations – does touch upon some of these themes, my aims are perhaps  less ambitious and more intimate by comparison.  6. Eltis et al. argue against Judith Carney’s ‘black rice’ thesis (and against Peter Wood’s and  Daniel Littlefi eld’s work, on which Carney’s builds) by insisting that ‘there is no compel- ling evidence that African slaves transferred whole agricultural systems to the New World;  nor were they the primary players in creating and maintaining rice regimes in the Amer- icas.... Furthermore, a close look at the slave trade from an Atlantic perspective suggests  no evidence that the rice culture of South Carolina, Georgia and Amazonia was any more  dependent on skills imported from Africa than were its tobacco and sugar counterparts  in the Chesapeake, the Caribbean, and Brazil. Th e evolving transatlantic connections,  the age and sex composition of the slave trade, the broad shifts over time in transatlantic  slaving patterns, and the structure of slave prices are all largely explained without refer- ence to a supposed desire on the part of rice planters for slaves with rice-growing expertise  developed in Africa’ (Eltis et al. 2007: 1335, 1357).  7. As Temudo (2011: 309) notes, ‘In recent years, rice imports in the sub-region have been  increasing from an annual growth rate of 5.54 per cent in 1991–2000 up to 10.51 per  </page> <page sequence="20"> Rice and Revolution  193 cent in 2001–2005. Despite research and development eff orts focused on the selection  and diff usion of modern varieties, rice consumption has been increasing faster than pro- duction and the self-suffi  ciency ratio decreased from 0.78 in the 1990s to 0.58 from 2001  to 2005’.  8. Much of the agricultural research on tropical food crops for the Latin American and Asian  Green Revolution was carried out under the auspices of an international research network  coordinated by CGIAR and funded largely by the Rockefeller and Ford Foundations,  with additional fi nancing from the World Bank and multinational corporations. Known  as the CG System, it comprised ten International Agricultural Research Centers, some  of which are continuing their work with new injections of fi nancing and purpose for the  African Green Revolution.  9. See Cernea (2005) for an excellent analysis of the ‘uphill battle for social research’ in  CGIAR centres, as well as the lively discussion (‘Special Section’ 2006; Fernando 2007)  in the wake of Cernea’s article. 10.
