<plain_text><page sequence="1">July-December ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS' NOTES ON RECENT EXCAVATIONS AND DISCOVERIES; OTHER NEWS WILLIAM N. BATES, Editor 220, St. Mark's Square, Philadelphia, Pa. GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS BULGARIA. -Recent Archaeological Work.- Notes on some re- cent discoveries in Bulgaria and on recent publications of earlier work, by B. FILOW, are given in Arch. Anz. 1912, cols. 558-576 (17 figs.). In the church of S. Sophia, in Sofia, the two mosaic pavements found, one above the other, about g m. apart, are now dated by coins in the d6bris filling the space between them, as of the beginning of the fourth and fifth centuries respectively. With the earlier and finer one, which belonged to a one-naved church about 10 m. long, the picture mosaic discovered ill the apse of the church in 1896 is to be classed. The second floor, with geometric patterns, is that of a somewhat larger church. Both were much injured in antiquity when the present church was built. The graves and tombs found in and about the church are not earlier than the fourth century. Late Roman mosaics, similar to the upper one at Sofia, were found at Stara Zagora, at Saparevska Bania (ancient Germania) and at Kostendil (Pautalia). The last, with a vase and a large snake in addition to the geometric designs, may show the site of the local worship of Asclepius. In a village near Kostendil the site of an extensive sanctuary of Zeus and Hera has been identified by the statues of the divinities, of good Roman work, and the statuettes, votive reliefs, and other offerings. A smaller building, two-celled like the first, and some granite capitals and a column from a third belong to the same sanctuary, which was destroyed by violence. The coins are of about 150-300 A.D. The prehistoric sites in- clude a palaeolithic settlement near Tirnova, the first found in Bulgaria; 1 The departments of Archaeological News and Discussions and of Bibliography of Archaeological Books are conducted by Professor BATES, Editor-in-charge, assisted by Professor C.

XVII, 1913 a hill near Shumen, from which comes pottery, not yet adequately pub- lished, and very interesting figurines of clay and bone; and a line of settle- ments along the Danube, some of which were reoccupied in Roman times. The pottery is of some interest, especially pieces from Kutovo and Vidbol. A Greek slab grave near Misivri (Mesambria) on the coast contained as ossuary a bronze hydria of the fourth century B.C., with a handle relief of Boreas and Orithyia. Other objects from various sites, that are now in the National Museum or in private possession, include a relief of the Thracian god TtX.o Sr , thought to resemble the Roman Silvanus; an altar to I. O. M. TAM ITENU S; one end of a sarcophagus cover which has the Thracian Horseman with symbolic accompaniments and two Heracles scenes, carved in great detail; other reliefs of the Horseman, one with Asclepius and Hygieia and one, inscribed rFiTLs opov; a marble female portrait head of the third century A.D., remarkable for the round shape of the skull and the close-lying hair; a bronze statuette of a barbarian warrior or gladiator, made with movable head; a bronze weight in the form of a bust filled with lead; several gold and silver rings; a dozen late Roman plain silver bowls with pointed bases; two toy horses on wheels, of clay; silver and bronze coins of the Roman period, gold and copper Byzalltine coins, and Bulgarian silver groschen of tile Czar Ivan Alexander, 1331-1365. KIRK KILISSE. - A Tholos Tomb.--In B.S.A. XVII, session of 1910-11, pp. 76-79 (pl.; 2 figs.), F. W. HASLUCK describes a tholos tomb near Kirk Kilisse, some thirty-five miles east of Adrianople. This was one of three. It was opened in 1891 and its conteits are in the museum at Constantinople, Nos. 163, 164, 175, 195, 267, 273, and 310 in the Bronze Room. All are of silver, or bronze, or bronze-gilt, and (except a thin silver double axe) evidently of Hellenistic date. The circular tholos is built of horizontal courses of large, cut stones, elaborately dressed within, but left rough outside, where they were covered with earth. The moulding above the door cannot, according to Mr. Dinsmoor, be earlier than the fourth century B.c. The tomb represents a late survival of a primitive technique. NECROLOGY. - E. W. Moes. - E. W. Moes, director of the Print- Cabinet of Amsterdam, died on the 30th of October, 1912. Born September 5, 1864, he was appointed in 1886 assistant archivist at Rotterdam, then assistant librarian of the University of Amsterdam in 1890. In 1898 he became assistant director of the Print-Cabinet, and in 1903, director. Among other works, he was the author of Iconografia Batava, of an important book on Frans Hals (1909), and of many articles in the Netherlandish reviews. He was regarded as an authority on the Dutch engraving of the seventeenth century, on which subject he com- posed a monumental work, which has been continued by C. P. Burger. (Chron. Arts, 1912, p. 283.) George Niemann. - The architect George Niemann died at Vienna, February 19, 1912, at the age of 72 years. He was a friend of Benndorf, and studied with him the monuments of Samothrace, Lycia and Caria, Gjalbaschi, Adam-Klissi, and Ephesus. (S. R., R. Arch. XIX, 1912, p. 431.) SERVIA.-- Recent Discoveries. - A sketch of excavations and dis- coveries in Servia, in the years 1907-1911, by N. VULIt, is given in Arch.</page><page sequence="3">EGYPT] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 97 Arnz. 1912, cols. 546-558 (8 figs.). Prehistoric sites at ?uto Brdo (Yellow Hill) and Vinba on the Danube and Gradac in southeastern Servia yielded flint, obsidian and bone implements, bronzes, terra-cotta idols and statuettes, chiefly female, and animnal figures, marble figurines, pottery, and single finds in iron, glass, etc., most of which have gone to the National Museum at Belgrade. The pottery is mostly hand-shaped, sometimes with red or bluish slip, and simple decorations of incised and sometimes color-filled outline or stamped patterns, or with black glaze paint on a whitish ground. At Vinia the remains of houses were found in several overlying strata. They are square, with wattle walls, and have hearth and oven inside. They are set down without any regard to streets. Two skeletons were found in graves, one in a crouching position. A large Roman camp (200 by 200 m.) has been excavated at Stojnik, south of Belgrade. It has the main entrance on the south side, toward the citizen settlement, and contains one long building (46 by 16 m.) with a row of piers down the middle, and a com- plex of apartments, one of which has an apse at the west end, a well in the southeast corner, and a row of heating arrangements along the axis. The small finds include a number of coins, mostly of the third and fourth centu- ries, with one Greek coin of Galerius Antoninius, the son of Marcus. THRACE. - Greek and Latin Inscriptions. - In R. Arch. XX, 1912, pp. 255-276 (6 figs.), GEORGES SEURE gives the text of twenty-seven inscriptions from Thrace. Two are Latin, the rest Greek. Eighteen are funerary, one is from a vase, the rest are fragmentary or illegible. This is the fourth article in the series (cf. A.J.A. XVI, 1912, pp. 113 and 435). EGYPT EXCAVATIONS OF THE EGYPTIAN RESEARCH STU- DENTS' ASSOCIATION. - The Egyptian Research Students' Asso- ciation, during the winter of 1911-12, carried on excavations at the Roman fort at Shurafa, identified with Scenas *Mandras. At Kafr Ammar, 50 km. south of Cairo, a cemetery from the prehistoric period to the time of the pyramid builders was found, and pieces of cloth, bits of wooden sarcophagi, bedsteads, etc., were brought to light. Three hundred ala- baster vases and dishes and numerous pots of terra-cotta were found, including one large jar with part of a zebra upon it. A seal of Narmer- Mena was also discovered. At Heliopolis traces of a second obelisk were found; and at Memphis an alabaster sphinx weighing eighty tons. (Kunstchr., June 28, 1912, col. 503.) EXCAVATIONS OF THE METROPOLITAN MUSEUM.- In B. Metr. Mus. VII, 1912, pp. 184-190, H. E. W(INLOCK) reports upon the recent work of the Metropolitan Museum of New York in Egypt. Little was done at the temple of Hibis at Kharga, and no attempt will be made to clear the temenos until the restorations now in progress are completed. Rows of sphinxes were discovered flanking the approach from the east; also new pieces of the portico of Nectanebo. On the new concessions opposite Luxor, near the modern villages of Gurneh and El Ba'arat, excavations were carried on, especially at the palace of Amenhotep III, south of the temple of Medinet Habu. This building was under construction from about 1400 to 1375 B.C., and consisted of a series of rambling one-story</page><page sequence="4">98 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 structures erected from time to time. There were dwellings for the use of officials and houses and shops for workmen. The whole aggregate of buildings was enclosed by a brick wall, with a gateway to the west and probably others to the north and east. The harem was separated from the rest of the palace by a wall in which was a single door. One passed through this into a vestibule which opened into a pillared antechamber. Passages led to the sides, and a stairway to the roof. The royal dining- room with apartments for the king was in this part of the palace, and eight suites for the ladies of the harem. The sun-dried bricks of which the palace was built bear the name of the king, in one place the name of the palace, Neb-mraat-re, "house of rejoicing," and in the latest part the names of the king and his queen Tiy. The floors were of brick; the roof was supported by palm logs. Floors, walls, and ceilings were covered with plaster made of mud and chopped straw, which, in the principal rooms, was covered with frescoes. In one room the ceiling de- sign consisted of spirals surrounding cows' heads which have rosettes between the horns; in another, pigeons and ducks (Fig. 1). Many small objects were unearthed, some of them in the process of manufacture. At the north end of the hill of Sheik abd el Gurneh the tomb of an official of the eleventh dynasty with remarkably good sculp- tures was cleared. In the seventh cen- tury it was occupied by an anchorite, Apa Epiphanios, who founded a small monastery there. A considerable num- ber of papyri of this date were found, as well as a codex in which a hymn is given in Greek and Coptic. ABYDOS.- The Recent Excavations. - A year ago the excava- tions of the Egypt Exploration Fund at Abydos were reported as centring about a sloping passage lying in an axis passing through the subterranean chamber in the temenos of Seti's temple, the temple itself, and so out to the desert (Fig. 2). The past season has brought to light the buried remains of a colony of predynastic Egyptians. Beneath the wind-swept sand, a few inches deep, is a thick, dark stratum-sand, mingled with burnt wood, potsherds, animal bones, and decaying vegetable matter. This rubbish, accumulated until decency or circumstances compelled a re- moval, yielded objects of interest. Two hearths, each about 20 feet in diameter, were buried in ashes, from which came arrow-heads, borers, scrapers, knives, and saws. A cylindrical seal shows four animal forms, one of them possibly an elephant. A small copper chisel was found. Grain was ground on flat slabs of stone. The abundance of bones attests a meat diet, the bones cracked to extract the marrow. Traces of buildings M --~cr~ ~ L 6 FIGURE 1.- CEILING IN PALACE OF AMENHOTEP III.

In one corner was a primitive furnace, 23 jars, arranged 12 and 11, packed close together 'I LI_ II I I I I I I C~r FIGURE 2. - ABYDOS. PLAN OF THE OSIREION. and bolstered up by vertical fire-bricks. Masses of charred logs suggest a slow-heat furnace for keeping things warm a long time. (W. N. STEARNS.) MEIR. - Recent Discoveries. - A. M. Blackman has excavated at Meir in Upper Egypt six decorated tombs. The earliest belonged to the sixth dynasty and the others to the Middle Kingdom. The latter formed a group by themselves and belonged to five successive generations of princes. Complete records were also made of two tomb-chapels, the earliest and latest of the Middle Kingdom group. (Nation, November 28, 1912, p. 519.) MEMPHIS. - Third Dynasty Tombs.- During the past two winters 'J. E. Quibell has excavated in a small part of the cemetery at Mem- phis more than four hundred tombs. These are uniform in type, and covering but a small period of time, mostly of the second and third</page><page sequence="6">100 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 dynasties. The excavations showed that the burial chambers were in the form of a house, complete in every respect, even to the bathroom, indicating that the provision which it was thought necessary to make for the dead was more thoughtful and complete in this early age than in the later epochs. In all these underground chambers the antiquities found were somewhat disappointing. This was due to the fact that the tombs had been opened by ancient robbers. However, a great number of bowls and dishes were obtained, also ewers and copper basins, and fragments from a wooden draughts-board. The seals on the vases were in three tombs inscribed with kings' names, thereby giving assured dates for the cemetery. The walls of the underground passages in these tombs were covered with paintings. (Nation, November 28, 1912, p. 519.) MEROE.- Recent Excavations. - In Ann. Arch. Anthr. V, 1912, pp. 73-83 (3 pls.; 3 plans), J. GARSTANG summarizes the results of the last expedition to Meroe. In the northeastern part of the Royal City a postern gate was found in the north wall, and what was probably a stairway leading to the ramparts. In this part of the city were remains of Roman baths, with a stone bathtub of modern shape, and heating apparatus. To the northwest a small prostyle temple of irregular shape was found, and to the southwest the royal baths. These included a frigidarium and a tepidarium with ornamental seats. The swimming bath was two metres deep, and adorned with glazed tiles and sculptured decoration between the water spouts. There were frescoes above. Several statues were found, including a reclining figure like the Vatican Nile. The original building was erected in the third or second century B.c. and reconstructed a century later. The sculptures are all of local execution. All the buildings in the Royal City fall into three periods. (1) 700 to 300 B.c., when the city was established, the great stone buildings erected, alld Egyptian influence prevailed. (2) 300 B.c. to 100 A.D., period of Greek influence. Objects of pure Meroitic origin belong to this time. (3) 200 to 700 A.D., Roman influence. City destroyed about 700. MINYEH. - Recent Excavations. - In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1912, pp. 484-490, R. NEILL reports upon his excavations at two sites near Minyeh during the winter of 1911-12. At Tuneh considerable work was done in the cemetery of Hermopolis, which dates from the eigh- teenth to the twentieth dynasties. The tombs were rectangular pits hollowed out in the rock, and originally had superstructures. At the bottom of the pits were usually three rooms, one at the right, one at the left, and one between. The usual funeral furniture of the period was found in abundance, and great quantities of figurines. As many as four hundred were found in a single tomb. Few historical inscriptions were discovered, and these came chiefly from a demolished temple of Amenophis IV. A very fine sarcophagus of black granite was taken to Paris. At ZAwiyet el-M6tin a cemetery of the Old Empire was discovered beneath the remains of a Roman village. A small stepped pyramid of the second or third dynasty was partly cleared. Some sculp- tured blocks of an eighteenth dynasty building were also found.</page><page sequence="7">SYRIA AND PALESTINE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1919 101 BABYLONIA AND ASSYRIA ASSHUR. - The German Excavations. - In S. S. Times, December 28, 1912, pp. 829 f., E.J. BANKs describes a visit to Asshur, the original capital of the Assyrian Empire. At the present moment the workmen are employed in excavating the ancient graves. The cemetery is yielding valuable re- sults. The tombs are large monuments of well-dressed stone worthy of adorning any American cemetery. In them only the kings or nobles could have been buried. They are found not without the city walls, as one might expect, but within the city, where they might be protected from the enemy. They are rectangular in shape, enclosing a chamber about eight feet long and half as wide. At one end, but raised from the ground, is a door of stone which still turns in its sockets. The walls are about ten feet high, and roofed above by a curving arch. SYRIA AND PALESTINE 'AIN SHEMS. - The Recent Excavations.- In the Annual for 1911 of the Pal. Ex. Fund, pp. 41-94 (8 pls.; 28 figs.), D. MACKENZIE reports the results of the excavations at 'Ain Shems during the year 1911; and in Pal. Ex. Fund, October, 1912, pp. 171-178, he describes the further progress of the work during the summer of 1912. The main results are as follows: first, there is the earliest period, when a Canaanite population in contact with some indigenous race founded the earliest settlement, represented by the deposits next the rock, which have a depth of from four to five feet. Fairly high up in this stratum the Semitic (Canaanite) deposits give distinctive in- dications of contact with foreign countries, including Egypt, Cyprus, and the islands of the Aegean archipelago. The Egyptian relations show a strong culminating domination, corresponding to the period of the eighteenth dynasty. The second stratum at Beth-Shemesh, which is from five to six feet in thickness, is that which contained the painted Philistine pottery. The culmination of this period of Philistine influence may be sought in the era about 1200-1100 B.c. In the third stratum, i.e. that nearest to the present surface of the ground, the Canaanite types of pottery maintain their old prominence, but there is no more of the painted Philistine pottery and the Philistine influence seems to be conspicuous by its absence. It may fairly be asumed that the third and last period in the history of Beth- Shemesh was one of Israelite influence and domination and that it extended from the eleventh to the eighth or seventh century B.c. There is every reason to think that it was the people of Israel who were the victors in the great siege represented by the burnt debris of the sacred city of Beth-Shemesh, as we see it encumbering the south gate of the city. The last era of the city would thus coincide with the period of the kings of Judah, and its final ex- tinction may have fallen in the time of the Assyrian invasions about the seventh century B.C. AMMAN. - The Megalithic Monuments - TIn the Annual for 1911 of the Pal. Ex. Fund, pp. 1-40 (6 pls.; 11 figs.), D. MACKENZIE reports the results of his excavations of the megalithic monuments at ancient Rabbath Ammon. Tombs of simple dolmen type may be taken as representing the first and earliest phase of megalithic civilization at Rabat Ammon. The second period in the megalithic civilization is not represented at Amman</page><page sequence="8">102 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 by monuments discernible above ground. But later investigations may tend to show that it has ample illustration at other sites. Its characteristic mark is the elongated type of dolmenic tomb with orthostatic slabs forming the cella, like that at Kosseir. The third or culminating period in the mega- lithic civilization is represented at Arnmman by a whole series of monu- ments. Its most characteristic marks are the dolmenic tomb and round towers with splayed masonry of Rujmn-el-Melfif. BEIRUT. - A Latin Inscription. - In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1912, pp. 248- 256 (fig.), L. JALABERT publishes a Latin inscription recently found at Beirut dating from the second century A.D. It is a dedication in honor of C. Valerius Rufus and records the fact that he was sent with a body of men to Cyprus, evidently to suppress the revolt of the Jews in 116-117. OPHEL. - Recent English Excavations. - In R. Bibl. IX, 1912, pp. 424-45:3, 544-574 (7 pls.; 9 figs.), H. VINCENT describes the results of the recent English excavations in the Siloam Tunnel and the Hill of Ophel at Jerusalem in continuation of the report given in previous numbers of the same journal. SAKJE GEUZI. - The Excavations of 1911. - In Ann. Arch. Anthr. V, 1912, pp. 63-72 (3 pls.), J. GARSTANG gives some additional details of his excavations at Sakje Geuzi in 1911 (see A.J.A. XVI, pp. 439 f.). The large mound, called Songrus Eyuk, was almost entirely artificial, al- though 160 feet high, about 600 feet long, and 500 feet wide. On the highest part was an almost complete building, of the first or second century B.C. made of sun-dried bricks upon a stone foundation. There was no perma- nent occupation of the site after Seleucid times. Hittite remains were found at a depth of twenty feet and were still being unearthed at a depth of forty feet. The lowest buildings were contemporary with the eighteenth dynasty in Egypt, but there are outer defensive walls which are much earlier. These cannot be definitely dated. But remains of two other periods belong to the eighteenth and twenty-sixth Egyptian dynasties. A deposit of Syro-Hittite vases was discovered between the main walls of the eighteenth dynasty. The smaller mound of Jobba Eyuk, where the sculptured gateway was found in 1898, was completely excavated. The main wall enclosed a quadrangular space about 130 m. by 190 m. There was but one gateway, which had once been adorned with sculptures, and fragments of a lion hunt like the one in Berlin, came to light. Inside the outer portico of the palace on the right was a stairway with sculptured decorations consisting of rosettes and other conventional patterns. Two doors led from the portico into other rooms. The one in the middle was adorned with sculptured slabs. A third door at the left led to a court paved with cobble-stones from which a stair- way led to the main wall. The buildings and offices of the palace seem to have been arranged in a double row inside the main walls. Potsherds were found in an unbroken series from neolithic times to the time of the palace; that is, to about the ninth century B.c. ASIA MINOR ANTIOCH IN PISIDIA. - Further Discoveries in the Sanctuary of Men.--In Athen. August 10, 1912, p. 149, W. M. RAMSAY reports the discovery in the sanctuary of Men at Pisidian Antioch (see A.J.A. XVI,</page><page sequence="9">ASIA MINOR] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 103 p. 117) of an important inscription on the base of a statue of a certain C. Caristanius Fronto Cassianus, the praefect of P. Septimius Quirinius when he was Triumvir of Antioch. It proves what Mommsen and others argued that Quirinius was twice governor, once in 6-7 A.D. and once earlier, and that his name should be restored in the Tibur inscription. According to Luke he was governor of Syria when Jesus was born. The war against the Homonades was fought in 8 B.c. Ibid. August 31, 1912, p. 226, he shows that the hieron was an irregular quadrilateral surrounded by a wall 19 feet thick on the southwest and 5 feet thick on the other side. There were two main entrances, on the southwest and southeast sides. The sanctuary was completely wrecked in the fifth century, probably by Christians. No coins later than the fourth century were found. A fine statue of a certain Cornelia Antonia was unearthed. It seems to have been made early in the first cen- tury A.D. and later altered. It is almost perfect. Ibid. September 7, 1912, p. 252, he shows that the architectural character of the central sanctuary of Men is obscure, but it was probably a small temple. The great cistern, which is later than the enclosing wall, was full of late inscriptions of little value. There was an anti-Christian movement in Antioch under Maximian II and Maximin. Associated with Men was a goddess who is referred to in Greek as Demeter. A general account of the excavations is published by M. M. HARDIE in J.H.S. XXXII, 1912, pp. 111-150 (18 figs.); and additional de- tails by Sir W. M. RAMSAY, ibid. pp. 151-170, and by F. W. HASLUCK, ibid. p. 390. CNIDUS.- Bronze and Iron. - In 1911 a deposit of eleven lance-heads (six of which were of bronze and five of iron, all of the same type), a small iron knife, and a whetstone was found at Cnidus. The coexistence of the two metals, as at Hallstatt and in the Homeric civilization, was emphasized by W. Ridgeway at the meeting of the British Association at Dundee in 1912. (S. R., R. Arch. XX, 1912, p. 296.) PAMPHYLIA. - Notes and Inscriptions.- In B.S.A. XVII, session of 1910-11, pp. 215-249 (2 figs.), H. A. ORMEROD and E. S. G. ROBINSON contribute notes on the topography of Pamphylia (Bazar-ghediyi 5renlik and neighborhood, Indjik, and the coast near Idalia) and the text (with commentary) of thirty-nine inscriptions, one of which is in Latin, the rest in Greek. Most of them are from sarcophagi. One conveys a life right in cer- tain property to a man named Harmax, after whose death it is to pass to Apollo, the income to be devoted to sacrifices and an annual feast. Another is of similar import. The Latin inscription is apparently a duplicate of one found at Euyukkeui and published by Mr. Woodward - a dedication to Diocletian, Maximnianus, and the two Caesares (see under Pisidia). The article closes with a list of proper names. In J.H.S. XXXII, 1912, pp. 270-276, H. A. ORMEROD publishes a stone inscribed on four faces with the names of the different throws with astragali and with quatrains giving the fortunes which they portend, found about six hours to the northeast of Adalia in Pam- phylia. It was badly damaged by the natives before it could be fully copied, but 29 quatrains are more or less preserved, and much might still be done to complete the readings. PERGAMON. - Discoveries in 1911.- In giving an account of the autumn campaign of 1911 at Pergamon, at the February (1912) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society, W. Doerpfeld described the sanctuary of</page><page sequence="10">104 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 Demeter and Core, built by the brothers Philetaerus and Eumenes, and the newly discovered temple of Hera, built by Attalus II, with cella of trachyte and marble pronaos, apparently the earliest marble building in the city. This would indicate that marble was not used there before the time of Attalus, and that the Great Altar belongs to him and not to Eumenes II. Doerpfeld defended his former interpretations of Strabo as to the geography of the coast of this region, assigning various names to places with which they are not usually identified. In this, A. Conze agreed with him only partially. The sculptures and inscriptions were described by A. Ippel. The brokeit male statue found in the temple of Hera, formerly called Zeus, is rather a portrait cult statue of Attalus II. (Arch. Anz. 1912, cols. 71-75.) PISIDIA. - Inscriptions. - In B.S.A. XVII, session of 1910-11, pp. 205-214, ARTHUR M. WOODWARD gives the text of eleven inscriptions from western Pisidia and notes on others previously published. Four are dedications to emperors: Antoninus Plus, Caracalla, D)iocletian, and Max- imnianus (with the Caesares Constantius and Maximianus; this is for the most part in Latin), and (apparently, as the inscription is nearly illegible) Constantine. Two inscriptions are agonistic, the others dedicatory. GREECE ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREECE, 1911-1912.--A survey of the ar- chaeological work in Greek lands for the year 1911-12, derived largely from the unpublished notes of the excavators, is given by F. W. HASLUCK in J.H.S. XXXII, 1912, pp. 385-390. He attributes the most striking results of the year to the American excavations at Sardis, although very important and significant work has been accomplished also in Boeotia, Thessaly, Crete, and elsewhere. The occasional juxtaposition of inhumation and cremation suggests questions that are not yet answered. A somewhat fuller r4sum6, including Corfu, Delos, Melos, and Thasos, also Asia Minor and Crete, by G. KARO, is published in Arch. Anz. 1912, cols. 235-270. ANAVYSOS. - Recent Excavations.- In IIpaKTLKd for 1911, pp. 110- 131 (15 figs.), P. KASTRIOTES and A. PHILADELPHEUS describe their excava- tions at Anavysos (the ancient Anaphlystus) during August and Septem- ber, 1911. Many tombs were opened and more than one hundred vases of geometric style found. In the same tombs with them were a number of hand-made, monochrome vases with incised decoration, similar to those found at Troy and on other prehistoric sites. No trace of Mycenaean ware was found, although Anaphlystus was a very old deme. The writers argue as a result of their excavations that the geometric style of vase painting must go back to Mycenaean times. ARGOS. - Discoveries of the Dutch Expedition.- Since 1902 W. Vollgraff of the University of Groningen has been carrying on excava- tions at Argos. He began work on the low hill known as the shield and in successive annual campaigns laid bare an important prehistoric settlement of about 2000 B.c. with heavy fortifications; then at the foot of the hill, a num- ber of large Mycenaean rock-tombs of the fifteenth and fourteenth centuries B.C., the contents of which are now in the National Museum at Athens. Pro- fessor Vollgraff then succeeded, by experimental trench-cutting, in getting a clear outline of the topography of ancient Argos, discoveritig among other</page><page sequence="11">GREECE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 105 objects of special interest the stadium, the gymnasium, the sanctuaries of Apollo Pythius and Athena Oxyderces, a round temple of unknown age and dedication, the Roman aqueduct, the Nymnphaeum, and a large stone terrace, which in all probability is the kritirion, or ancient place of judgment, men- tioned by Pausanias. The chief interest, however, lay in identifyiing the agora, an immense rectangular area of some 3000 square metres, which was partly roofed in and was surrounded on all sides by walls, temples, and col- onnades. On the north side, which is above 109 metres in length, the colon- nade has been unearthed almost intact, the columns still standing to a, height of several metres, while most of the capitals are lying about near by. This colonnade apparently dates back to the fourth century B.c. An agora belonging to classical times of these dimensions and such arrangement is thus far unique in Greece or Asia Minor. Pausanias describes the Argive agora quite elaborately, and names no fewer than seventeen temples abut- ting on it. One of these temples has already been unearthed by Professor Vollgraff; it is 32 m. long by 15? m. broad, and was built of fine white limestone. The substructure and numerous fragments of the superstructure are preserved, as well as the shattered statue of the goddess, whose name may, perhaps, be determined when the pieces are put together. Excava- tions are to be continued, and one may confidently hope for even more im- portant discoveries. (Nation, October 3, 1912, pp. 316-317, based on London Times.) ATHENS..- Geometric Graves. - In IIpaKTLK&amp; for 1911, pp. 97-104; 358 (4 figs.; plan), P. KASTRIOTES describes his excavations near the church of Hagios Daniel in Athens, in which little of importance came to light ex- cept two large geometric amphorae containing unburnt bones of children. The vases had been broken in antiquity and fastened together with lead. Grave Monuments from the Dipylon. - In Ath. Mitt. XXXVII, 1912, pp. 226-232 (4 figs.), G. P. OIKONOMOS publishes (1) the inscription on a stele recently removed from a wall in the northern part of the Dipylon; (2) the basis of a trapeza standing near by; (3) a stele from the Eridanus. Recent Discoveries at the Piraeus. .-- The finding of a marble statuette of Aphrodite in the llXaraa rG&amp;v'Y/'X&amp;iv 'A)Awvyov at the Piraeus when the square was being paved led to excavation which revealed water channels be- longing to baths of the time of Augustus. A terra-cotta statuette of the type of the Farnese Heracles, and some coins were brought to light. (N. KYPARISSES, IIpaKcLKr for 1911, pp. 244-246.) CHALCIS. - Mycenaean Tombs. - In IIpaKrLKu for 1911, pp. 236-241 (2 figs.), G. A. PAPAVASILEIOU reports that during 1911 several Mycenaean tombs containing vase fragments and a few small objects of no particular importance were excavated at Chalcis; also tombs of the classical period, as well as a few dating from Christian times. An ancient reservoir which con- tinued in use until the fourth century B.c. was found; also a potter's oven of Roman date and near it a small bronze bell inscribed CYTYXC I NIKA. CORFU.- Recent Excavations.- The results of the excavations car- ried on at Corfu during the last season have proved of great interest. An ancient temple, identified as that of Asclepius, has been completely laid bare. It is about 8) metres wide by 11? metres long. A large number of the columns have been found, and some of them have been retrected in their original places. In the middle of the temple was found the pedestal on which</page><page sequence="12">106 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XVII, 1913 the cult statue stood. The excavations in the temple where the relief of a Gorgon was discovered last year have also been completed. The space between the temple and the altar was cleared and a number of interesting objects found, among them the painted tiles from the roof of the temple. The altar itself is of an interesting type, being decorated on the outside with a Doric frieze of metopes and triglyphs. (Nation, October 10, 1912, p. 342.) CYNURIA. - The Temple of Apollo Tyritus. - In IIpaK7Kw for 1911, pp. 253-279 (14 figs.), K. A. RHOMAIOs describes his excavations on the hill of Hagios Elias in eastern Laconia. A few architectural fragments belonging to a sixth century temple were found but its exact site could not be located. The foundations of a fourth century temple and of an altar of the same date were uncovered. The small objects dated from the fifth century and earlier. The more important of them are two small bronze bulls dating from the sixth century B.C., one of them inscribed AF EAON KA E, the last three letters not yet interpreted; two small bronze lions which were used as brooches, one of them inscribed; a dedication to Apollo from the interior of a cylix; piece of a bronze bowl inscribed AFEAONTVPIT, which identifies the site. The modern town of NrEp', where about 400 m. of the ancient walls have long been known, preserves the ancient name. Other finds were a bronze stat- uette of Heracles, a bronze horse, a siren, a few terra-cotta figurines of a seated and of a standing goddess, many iron spear points as well as swords, darts, and a trident, about ten lead crowns and a number of aryballi. The writer also points out that Polichna is the modern Poulithra, one hour south of Leonidi; that the Glympeis of Polybias is the modern Lynkia which should be Lympia; that the location of Prasiae near the little harbor of Leonidi is confirmed. CYPARISSIAE. - Recent Discoveries. - Tentative excavations at Cyparissiae have revealed the remains of a large building with columns. Other walls seem to have belonged to colonnades. It is suggested that these are oni the site of the Roman forum, but nothing more definite can be stated until further excavations are made. A few tombs were found and 122 coins. (N. KYPARISSES, llpaKrLKd for 1911, pp. 247-252.) DELPHI. --Discoveries in 1910.-In Berl. Phil. W. July 20, 1912, cols. 923-927 (2 figs.), H. POMTOW continues to present the results of his discoveries at Delphi in 1910 (see A.J.A. XVI, pp. 123 fT.; 441 ff.). The architect of the Colonnade of Lysander was careless, and the materials which he used poor. Ibid. July 27, 1912, cols. 959-968 (2 figs.), he shows that Martinaud's restoration of the fagade with eight columns and two triglyphs to the column is improbable. There were more likely twelve columns. Ibid. August 10, 1912, cols. 1010-1016 (2 figs.), he attempts a restoration of the Colonnade of Craterus in front of the theatre. It probably had four Ionic columns in front, and at the back on a pedestal Craterus hastening to the assistance of Alexander, who is hunting a lion. Ibid. August 17, 1912, cols. 1042-1048 (5 figs.), he contends that several fragments of an archaic Ionic column with palmette capitals belonged to the Treasury of Clazomrenae, which was erected about the middle of the sixth century B.c. It was a short distance east of the Treasury of Cnidus. Ibid. August 24,1912, cols. 1077-1080 (2 figs.), he assigns to this building various archaic offerings. Just below the temple, and between it and the polygonal wall, was another terrace, upon which stood a number of statues. Reference is made to this in an</page><page sequence="13">GREECE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 107 inscription copied by O. Miiller and E. Curtius in 1837 (Curtius, Anecd. Delph. p. 83, No. 67). Ibid. August 31, 1912, cols. 1108-1111, he shows that another inscription (Inv. 4216) proves that 4 rrvXk was the official name of the east gate of the temenos. Ibid. September 7, 1912, cols. 1140-1143, he points out that the line of the wall of the upper terrace can be traced. It was irregular, and ran outside the large rock below the temple. Ibid. September 14, 1912, cols. 1170-1176 (plan), he gives a plan of the sacred precinct, with the location of all the monuments and lists of those mentioned by Plutarch and Pausanias. Ibid. September 21 and 28, 1912, cols. 1206-1208 and 1238-1240, he discusses the giro of Plutarch. Ibid. October 5, 1912, cols. 1268-1272, he discusses the giro of Pausanias. Ibid. October 12, 1912, cols. 1301-1304 (fig.), he suggests an arrangement for the statues in the twelve niches within the cella of the temple. Ibid. October 19 and 26, 1912, cols. 1335-1336 and 1365-1368, he summarizes his conclusions as to the large Tholos. In Klio, XII, 1912, pp. 281-307 (2 figs.), he argues that this building, the temple of Asclepius, and the Thymele at Epidaurus were all the work of one architect, Theodotus of Phocaea. The Tholos was built about 380-375 B.c. It had the same sima as the temple of Asclepius at Epidaurus; and the Amazon frieze on both buildings was the work of the same sculptor, Timotheus. Polyclitus probably took dip the work of the Thymele after the death of Theodotus. The great Tholos, like the little one of poros which preceded it and was the oldest round building in Greece, was a prytaneumn, a Koutn (rnt'a for the town fire. The raised platform inside the great Tholos was for use at dinners. In Berl. Phil. W. November 2, 1912, cols. 1393-1399, he comments upon the hymn to Hestia by Aristoxenus, and makes a few corrections to his series of papers. HAGIA MARINA. - The Prehistoric Settlement. - In IIpaKTLKd for 1911, pp. 205-235, G. SOTERIADES describes his excavations at Hagia Marina in Phocis, where he found, one half metre below the surface, a layer of Mycenaean remains 1 m. thick, below which was a pre-Mycenaean stratum 3! m. thick, and below that a neolithic stratum 3? m. thick. The houses of the neolithic period were apparently made of mud and straw, and those of the pre-Mycenaean period of stone, but the size and shape of neither can be determined. The writer discusses at length the pottery and the chronology of the different periods, concluding that the pre- Mycenaean stratum was contemporary with Early Minoan III in Crete. The neolithic settlement must be as early as 3000 B.c. NAXOS. - Pre-Mycenaean Tombs.-- In IIpaKTLKa for 1911, p. 357, K. STEPHANOS reports opening about one hundred pre-Mycenaean tombs near Phyrrogais in Naxos. He also made a plan of the small prehistoric acropolis at Polichni, excavated last year. PHYLAKOPI. - Excavations in 1910. - Excavations were carried on by the British School at Athens for two months in the spring of 1910 at Phylakopi, on the island of Melos. The results of t1e excavations of 1896-99 were confirmed. Several intramural burials (in pithoi) of infants were found. They belong to the period of the First City. The manufacture of the native "Red and Black" ware was in part earlier than the imported Late Minoan II vases from Crete, but did not cease when the importation began. No certain pieces of Cretan Late Minoan III ware were</page><page sequence="14">108 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 found. Some "Minyan" pottery shows relations with the mainland. Late Mycenaean ware shows that Phylakopi was inhabited to the end of the Mycenaean period, ca. 1000 B.c. (R. M. DAWKINS and J. P. DROOP, B.S.A. XVII, session of 1910-11, pp. 1-22; 14 pls.; 2 figs.) SAMOS.-- Miscellaneous Antiquities.--In Ath. Mitt. XXXVII, 1912, pp. 199-218 (pl.; 10 figs.) M. SCHEDE publishes a fragment of an archaic Ionic crowning moulding, thirteen pieces of sculpture, and six inscriptions from Samos. TANAGRA. - Excavations in 1911.--In IIpaKTLKad for 1911, pp. 132-142, N. G. PAPPADAKIS reports upon his excavations carried on at five different places in the vicinity of Tanagra in 1911. In all 152 tombs of different types were opened, dating from the first six centuries B.C. The men's graves contained drinking cups of different shapes and strigils, but no arms except one dagger; the women's graves had a few brooches and pins, boxes for cosmetics, etc. About 800 complete vases were found, chiefly black, without painted figures or plastic decoration. One tomb alone contained 175 aryballi; and another about 70 canthari and 30 lecythi. About 100 terra-cotta figurines, none of them important, were found, chiefly horsemen, sileni, sirens, and animals of early date. The commonest types of the fifth and fourth centuries were a seated woman and a nude youth. At Dritsa seven tombs were opened, in one of which was a black- figured skyphos with a flute-player standing upon a thymele between two judges. At Hagios Nicolaos, south of the present town of Thebes, some Mycenaean remains came to light. THEBES.- The Palace of Cadmus.--In HpIIaKTK7Kd for 1911, pp. 143-152, A. D. KERAMOPOULLOS describes his excavations in the Mycenaean palace at Thebes in the summer of 1911. The room with the wall-paintings, partly excavated in 1906, was completely cleared, as were two small rooms to the south of it. In one of the latter was a potter's firing oven and some unfinished Mycenaean vases. The floor was covered with a hard layer of powdered lime in which were bits of painted stucco. Below this pavement was a layer of sand and pieces of fine stucco and vases. Lower down were pre-Mycenaean sherds. A few bronze arrowheads and a spear- head were found, as well as many small objects of gold and three remark- able fragments of rock crystal. Remains of an aqueduct appear to go back to Mycenaean times. THESPIAE. - Excavations in the Necropolis. - In IIpaKTLKd for 1911, pp. 153-163 (4 figs.), A. D. KERAMOPOULLOS reports that in 1911 he continued the excavations in the cemetery east of Thespiae, where in 1882 Stamatakes found an ancient road and the graves of some of the men of Thespiae who fell in the battle of Delium. Several graves were opened, in some of which the bodies had been burnt before burial. Remains of the stone lion which was probably the prototype of the lion of Chaeronea were rediscovered. THESSALY. - Discoveries in 1911.-In IIpaKTLKd for 1911, pp. 280-356 (15 plans), A. S. ARVANITOPOULLOS records the discoveries in Thessaly in 1911. At Porta, three quarters of an hour from Trikkala, the Byzantine church was examined, and plans made for its preservation. At Homolium the temple lay a short distance below the summit of the acropolis. Many tiles and fragments of terra-cotta belonging to it were</page><page sequence="15">GREECE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 109 found. East of the acropolis are geometric tombs. The ancient Aloium is probably to be located where remains of houses, town walls, etc. have been found on the right bank of the Peneus, north of Paliokklesi. Otl top of the mountain near by probably stood the famous temple of Pythian Apollo, to which the embassy from Delphi came for the bay every eight years. At Lestiane, on Mount Pelion, three tombs of the geometric period, which he calls pseudo-tholos tombs, were opened; and five more near Sesklos. Many others of the same style were discovered, but not ex- cavated. On a mountain called Spartia, above Latomneion, considerable neolithic remains were found. Part of the ancient paved road from Pagasae to Pherae was discovered, and at Iolcus a great necropolis dating from classical and prehistoric times. On the summit of Mount Pelion were two walled enclosures, in the larger of which were twotemples. One seems to have been round, perhaps like the temple of Athena Polias at Gonnus (A.J.A. XVI, p. 128), but the remains of it are very scanty. In the eastern part of the precinct was probably a stoa. In the second enclosure were two other buildings, neither of which has yet been ex- cavated. One was perhaps the temple of Zeus Acraeus. At Gonnus the temple of Athena Polias was completely cleared. There was no earlier building on the site. About forty decrees, one in the Thessalian dialect, various architectural fragments, etc., have come to light. A Doric capital of poros seems to prove that two Doric columns stood at the entrance. Below the acropolis to the west, near the gate, was a small building, perhaps a temple of Artemis. He locates Gonnocondulon between Duo Dendron and Kastori. At Olympias several grave stelae were discovered, as well as remains of three buildings not yet cleared, of which one was perhaps a mausoleum. Near Baxilar are remains of an ancient city; and near Chatzombasi was the ancient Elatea (Livy, 42, 54), with remains of a temple and other structures. One hour to the south- east, near Mikro Kaserli, are remains of a larger town, identified by an inscription as the ancient Mopsion. Near Bakraina on the Peneus are powerful walls about an acropolis apparently dating from the sixth century B.C., as well as the walls of a lower town. There are also remains of a building on the acropolis. This was probably the ancient Gyrtone. At Metropolis four more tombs of the first or second century were opened, containing many pieces of gold leaf and various small articles. The architectural remains on an elevation to the north perhaps belonged to the temple of Castnia Aphrodite, but the site has been plundered for bIuilding stone. At Kileler, near Larissa, slight remains indicate an ancient town near by, perhaps Armenium. At Agoriane the greater part of the acropolis wall still stands, and there are some traces of a lower wall. At Dranista, too, there is an acropolis wall, and slight remains of a lower city wall. In a pseudo-tholos tomb were thirty-one burnt bodies, and many small objects, including engraved gems. Many other sites in Dolopia were located, but have not yet been carefully ex- amined. In B.S.A. XVII, session of 1910-11, pp. 193-204 (map), A. J. B. WTACE and M. S. THOMPSON publish an inscription of the year 101 A.D. recording the settlement of the boundary between Doliche and Elemiotis. The inscription lies in the ruined church of the Holy Trinity, on the high road, some three hours north of Elassona. Doliche was probably at Kastri.</page><page sequence="16">110 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 Other sites are tentatively identified. The boundary is determined on the basis of a decree of Amyntas III (390-371 B.c.). THASOS.--Recent Excavations.--In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1912, pp. 193-221 (10 figs.), C. PICARD describes the excavations at Thasos in 1911. The south gate with the relief of Zeus and Iris was cleared, and another gate discovered near the road from Limenas to Panagia. The gate of Heracles was also cleared. On the left side was a marble slab 2.54 m. long, 1.70 m. wide, and 0.65 m. thick, with a badly mutilated Silenus holding a cantharus in his right hand carved upon it. It dates from the sixth century B.C. Near by was a necropolis dating from the fifth or fourth century B.c. where a number of grave stelae, some of which had been painted, and twenty-three inscriptions were found. The temple on the acropolis was dedicated to Apollo Pythius. Within the terrace in which it stood were remains of a circular structure with a dromos, and in front of the temple the foundations of a great altar. Many small objects were found, including numerous pre-Jonian terra-cottas similar in type to statues from Asia Minor, also many female figures resembling the seated statues of Branchidae, and a very old statuette of a lyre player. Vase fragments were abundant and were chiefly Ionian, but some belong to BRhlau's Lesbo-Aeolian style. One vase was decorated plastically with a head. The temple was 37.40 m. long and 15.80 m. wide, but had no peripteros. The walls were covered with inscriptions. It is probable that there was a row of columns inside. Among the sculptures found were a mutilated marble head of fourth century date, a draped torso, and a bas-relief of two female figures approaching a third who is seated. The triumphal arch of Caracalla was excavated, and parts of the dedicatory inscription found. It dates between the end of 213 and April, 217 A.D., and probably stood in front of the temple of Rome and Augustus. Ibid. pp. 222-225 (fig.) A.-J. REINACH discusses the inscribed bases found with the seven life-size female statues in 1910. They were dedications to Artemis Polo. The attempts to find the temple precinct to which they belonged were unsuccessful. ITALY ARCHAEOLOGY IN ITALY IN 1911.- A summary and discussion of recent archaeological publications and discoveries in Italy, by R. DEL- BRUECK, appears in Arch. Anz. 1912, cols. 270-322 (35 figs.). Architectural terra-cottas, especially roof-members, have received much attention, the material coming from Nemi, Conca (ca. 500 n.c.), Falerii, and Campania, especially Capua (from the sixth century down). Some important tombs are described: that at Canosa, of the early third century B.c.; that of Trebius Julius on the Via Latina at Rome, of the end of the third century A.D., with paintings of much historical interest for their subjects as well as the style and execution; and that of St. Julian at Rimini, of the fourth century, from which figured silk fabrics with human and animal designs and geometric patterns were taken. The pottery of Cumae is discussed, from the geometric (Chalcidian ?) ware of the first settlers down through the time when Cumaean vases were exported to many other parts of Italy. The Etruscan stelae in the museum at Bologna, dated about 500-350 B.c., contain, among other things, the earliest known representations of combats</page><page sequence="17">ITALY] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 111 with Gauls. * At Rome, the removal of modern encumbrances from important sites and the excavation of the palace of Domitian in the Villa Mills on the Palatine are mentioned. Attention is called to the admirable museums at Bari, Tarentumrn, and Lecce, and to the rearrangement of the collections in the Ducal Palace in Venice and the Villa Papa Giulia at Rome. An em- bossed and engraved silver plate at Bari is especially beautiful. Work in Ostia, Capri, Sicily, and Sardinia is described. BRESCIA.- Recent Discoveries.- A tomb of the Gallo-Roman period was found at Brescia, containing a large nuinber of iron implements, and a few vases and lamps. Near the Porta Venezia a stone urn of rough workmanship was unearthed, containing a number of bronze objects, among them two mirrors, one circular and the other rectangular; also vases of glass and clay, lamps, and coins of Vespasian, Titus, and Domitian. Near by were found two Latin inscriptions. At Mompiano, a suburb of Brescia, were found a handsome glass ampulla and an inscribed cippus. (G. PATRONI, Not. Scac. IX, 1912, pp. 10-12.) CROTON. - Excavations in the Sanctuary of Hera Lacinia. - The first campaign of excavation in the sanctuary of Hera Lacinia was devoted to determining the form and character of the peribolus. Architectural fragments were brought to light in considerable numbers, together with ornaments in bronze, bone or ivory, and glass, and a few inscriptions. A number of architectural members in terra-cotta were found, representing various periods, and showing the transition from decoration in color to that in relief, with various intermediate stages. The marbles discovered under the sea near the Heraeum, and supposed to belong to a cargo coming from Greece or carried off by the Romans from the sanctuary, were shown by an inscription to belong to a period as late as 206 A.D. The presence of three large labra of Luna marble seems to show that the Romans of this late epoch continued to make offerings to the shrine, unless the labra were intended for some villa in the neighborhood. (P. ORSI, Not. Scar. VIII, Suppl., 1912, pp. 77-124.) PALERIA PICENA. - Hoard of Roman Coins. - A hoard of 7400 silver and bronze coins of the third century A.D. (Alexander Severus, Gor- dian, Gallienus) was found in a terra-cotta vessel at Faleria Picena while work was being carried on in a vineyard. Professor DALL' OSSO of the museum at Ancona announces that the hoard contains some rare and important coins. (Boll. Num. X, 1912, p. 43.) FALERII. - Excavations at Monte Cerreto. - The excavations at Monte Cerreto disclosed some ancient tombs which had been rifled in antiquity, but contained some funerary offerings abandoned or overlooked by the robbers, including bucchero ware of the fifth century and a cylix of local manufacture of the fourth century, preserving the Attic form of the sixth century. This was decorated with the group of Bacchus and Ariadne which appears on an Etruscan mirror (Gerhard, I, 83), but inferior to this in artistic merit. (E. GXBRIcI, Not. Scav. IX, 1912, pp. 73-74.) PANO. -Roman Victoriates. - A discovery at Fano in 1911 of 88 victoriates, all but one in mint state, is described by LORENZINA CESANO, who proceeds on the text of this and other enumerated finds of victoriates to a full discussion of the history of this class of coinage. (R. Ital. Num. XXV, 1912, pp. 299-348; pl.)</page><page sequence="18">112 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 PIUMICINO. - Discoveries in the Isola Sacra.- In the IsolalSacra, near S. Ippolito, Fiumicino, foundations were discovered which showed the existence of large warehouses opposite the harbor of Claudius, with a court with colonnades at the landing place. In the course of the excavations there were found weights, brick stamps, fragments of sculpture, and other small objects. (E. GATTI, Not. Scar. VIII, 1911, pp. 410-416.) PUNDI.- An Early Christian Shrine. - About 5 km. northeast of FIndi, on a hill called Villa, an ancient Christian shrine was uncovered, with paintings of the sixth or seventh century, representing horses, female heads, and the like. There were also found a considerable number of pagan inscriptions, one of 337 A.D., and in the collection in the former convent of S. Francisco in Fundi some inscriptions which were unpublished or incorrectly published in Count Colino's History of Fundi, 1902. Other unpublished inscriptions were found in the Church of S. Pietro Apostolo in Fundi. (S. AUPIGEMMA, Not. Scav. IX, 1912, pp. 53-61.) LOCRI EPIZEPHYRII.- A Report on the Excavations.-- The preliminary report of the excavations at Locri Epizephyrii records the dis- covery of 266 tombs of various kinds in the necropolis, arranged from north to south. Both cremation and inhumation were employed, but the latter predominated. The tombs date from the sixth to the fifth century B.c. A num- ber of vases were found, including white lecythi of somewhat poor workman- ship, as well as other funer- ary objects. A very few gold and silver ornaments were found, but no less than 26 bronze mirrors, or about one to every ten tombs. One of these, a standing mirror, had for its handle an archaic ephe- bus, whose head and up- lifted arms supported the disk of the mirror. Others had handles richly orna- mented with Ionic volutes and palmettes. The Doric temple at Casa Marafioti was uncovered and its plan determined. In the course of the excavations a number of interesting fragments of architecture and sculpture were unearthed, of which the most striking was a winged sphinx with human arms ending in paws like those of an animal. According to the restoration of a large number of fragments by Sig. Rosario Carta (Fig. 3), this sphinx supported with its upraised arms the feet of a mounted rider, the belly of whose horse rested on the back of the sphinx, forming a unique group, which is believed to have been one of the acroteria of the temple. Two tiles were found in the excavations, bear- ing in Greek the name of Clodius Pulcher, but without a praenomen, besides a fragment in archaic Greek letters. The small temple of Athena was also FIGURE 3. - LOCRI EPIZEPHYRII. TERRA-COTTA ACROTERION. RESTORED. ~i ~ .??:K</page><page sequence="19">ITALY] ARCHA4EOLOGICAL NEWS, 191? 113 examined and a number of terra-cotta statuettes of the goddess found, in a fragmentary condition. The exploration of the sanctuary of Persephone yielded a considerable number of fragments of vases and sculptures in terra- cotta. (P. ORsI, Not. Scav. VIII, Suppl., 1912, pp. 3-76.) MOLTENO. - Coins in Roman Tombs.- Among other objects found in ten Roman tombs opened in a private garden at Molteno (Brianza) were a dozen coins belonging to the period of Constantine, etc. They are of no numismatic importance, but serve to date the tombs. (R. Ital. Num. XXV, 1912, pp. 287-288.) MOUNT CAVO. - A Second Century Cemetery.- During some ex- cavations undertaken at Mount Cavo, in the Roman Campagna, the diggers struck upon an extensive cemetery belonging to the second century A.D. A gladiator, clad in iron armor, was discovered in one of the tombs, which was covered with big tiles taken from the temple of Tiberius. There were also found a number of bronze coins bearing the head of the Empress Faustina, a quantity of rings and safety pins, the head of an elephant in terra-cotta, and a fragmentary vase with inscription. (Nation, November 28, 1912, p. 518.) NAPLES.- An Inscription naming Cumae.- In the Naples museum an unpublished inscription naming Cumae was found, discovered in 1905 in the fondo Origlia. (S. AURIGEMMA, Not. Scar. IX, 1912, p. 61.) NAZZANO. - Recent Discoveries.-- In the district called Santa Lucia, on the south slope of Monte San Pietro, a number of interesting funerary offerings were found, portions of an amber necklace, bronze fibulae with rings suspended from them, and other small objects assigned to the first Iron Age, besides some coins of the Roman period. Excavations con- ducted by the Museo Nazionale di Villa Giulia resulted in the discovery of a grave containing the corpse of a woman, with vases and rich bronze orna- ments, resembling those found in the necropolis of the Esquiline. (E. STEFANI, Not. Scav. VIII, 1911, pp. 433-442.) OSTIA. -- Excavations in the Barracks of the Vigiles.-- In the course of the excavations in the barracks of the Vigiles a number of frag- ments of Arretine vases with inscriptions were found, and a list of soldiers of the third cohort of the century of Claudius, from the Ides of August to the Ides of December, 166 A.D. Rare names are Cassienus and Laesina. Each name is followed by the letters K. C. Although there is but one freed- man in the list, the parentage is given in only two cases. A number of lamps and fragments of sculpture also came to light. (D. VAGLIERI, Not. Scar. VIII, 1911, pp. 403-410.) On the left and right of the entrance to the barracks were found mosaics in black and white, signed in Latin and in Greek respectively by Proclus. On the south side of the Via dei Vigili, op- posite the front of the barracks, were found a number of inscribed lead pipes, one of Gallienus, 251-253, as well as stamped bricks and small objects. In the small market was found an antefix with a lotus bud between two serpents, according to Professor Marini the symbols of Sobku. (D. VAGLIERI, ibid. IX, 1912, pp. 127-134.) Excavations beneath the Via dei Vigili prove that this street was cut through previously existing buildings. One of these contained a large black and white mosaic, 13 metres by 9, dating probably from the middle of the first century A.D. Of special interest are the squares containing representations of four provinces, Sicily, Africa, Egypt, and ap-</page><page sequence="20">114 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 parently Spain; and four of the winds. The whole has an obvious relation to the maritime importance of Ostia. (G. CALZA, B. Com. Rom. XL, 1912, pp. 103-112; pl.; 2 figs.) Excavations in the Via dei Sepolcri. - On the road connecting the Via Ostiensis with the Via dei Sepolcri at Ostia were found various small objects, also a tomb ornamented with sculptured heads. In the latter was found a Boeotian coin assigned by Head (Hist. Num. p. 299) to the years 244-197 B.c. In the Via dei Vigili numerous inscriptions were found, including lists of vigiles, stamped bricks, etc. (D. VAGLIERI, Not. Scav. VIII, 1911, pp. 447- 454; IX, 1912, pp. 22-26.) Under the road joining the Via Ostiensis with the Via dei Sepolcri was found a mass of marble fragments, destined for the limekiln, or to be used as building material. Among them were some inter- esting fragments of sculpture. The gate of the barracks of the Vigiles was uncovered and found to be 3.95 m. in width, with a threshold of travertine on which there were no traces of wheels. The pilasters on the outside con- tained some graffiti. There is a vestibule, 6 by 4.25 m. with a pavement of teguli bipedales, and on the right, as one enters, a portico 11.90 by 4.25 m. with a mosaic pavement in black and white. In a tomb on the north side of the barracks two tabulae lusoriae were found and a tabula defixionis. On the south side of the small market were found some small terra-cotta and bronze objects, including a bronze bell. (D. VAGLIERI, ibid. IX, 1912, pp. 47-52.) In a republican tomb on the Via dei Sepolcri were found a. large number of fragments of bones with figures in relief, probably used as the decoration of urns or caskets. According to L. Marini, such decorations were frequent in late republican times in tombs found in Pentima and Ancona. Some recall the Etrusco-Ionic ones published by Pollak in Rnm. Mitt. XXI, 1906, pp. 314 ff., pls. XV-XVI, but are much later. Some, per- haps, formed the decoration of musical instruments. (D. VAGLIERI, ibid. IX, 1912, pp. 95-101.) PAVIA.- Minor Discoveries.- Excavations in the vicolo S. Gregorio yielded scanty results, although one tomb was found which was the oldest datable yet discovered in that locality. A few coins and other small objects were found. In the piazza Castello a Christian tomb was unearthed, with an inscription and a few small objects. (G. PATRONI, Not. Scav. IX, 1912,. pp. 3-6.) POMIPEII.-- The Excavations in the Via dell' Abbondanza.- In the excavations on the east side of the Via dell' Abbondanza, at the crossing of the roads between Ins. vI and vI of Reg. I, and vii and xI of Ix, there was found a shrine with a painted frieze, representing the twelve Dei consentes or Penates publici of Pompeii (Fig. 4). These are in their order: Jupiter, Juno, Mars, Minerva, Hercules, Venus, Mercury, Proserpina, Vulcan, Ceres, Apollo, and Diana, while in the similar painting in the Vicolo dei XII Dei Vesta and Neptune appear in place of Hercules and Proserpina. The order, too, is different in the new painting, and the Capitoline triad, with the addition of Mars, appear at the ends, instead of in the centre. On one of the sides of the shrine is a painting, representing a sacrifice by the vici magistri and the ministri vici et compiti, while an inscription preserves the names of the four members of the collegium compiti for a year not much earlier than 79. The street between Ins. vI and vii was closed by a wooden door, while the passage through it of carriages was prevented by</page><page sequence="21">ITALY] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 115 three blocks of tufa. A large number of election notices were found in the vicinity, including one distich, some of which are of special interest; and two abecedaria. Outside the Porta Nolana a skeleton was found, from which a cast has been made, of a man lying on his back with legs upraised and hold- ing in his grasp the branches of a tree. (M. DELLA CORTE, Not. Scay. VIII, 1911, pp. 417-432; 455-460.) In the fauces of No.7 onl the north side of the road two paintings were found, one of a nude male figure, perhaps Hercules; the other of a nude Hercules with the lion skin and club, leading a white pig with a large red fillet about its body; also several election notices. Directly to the east of this was found a second-story cenaculumn, the front of which projects over riiiiiii i""'-:; ;:~U? :::i : : ::::? % FIGURE 4. -POMPEII. TIHE TWELVE GoDS. the street. In front are columns with grooves for inserting wooden shutters, to close the openings between the columns. Numerous brick-stamps were found, including one in Oscan. On the south side of the road the continu- ance of the excavations yielded various bronze objects, including scales, glass vases, etc.; dried figs and dates, iron implements, and the remains of a wooden cask with a spigot; also a few election notices. In the excavations at the end of the same street the hanging balconies were further uncovered and some graffiti found. (M. DELLA CORTE, ibid. IX, 1912, pp. 27-32; 62-71.) The cenaculum mentioned above proved to have under it two passageways, one the entrance to a shop, while the other probably opened oni a stairway leading to the cenaculum, on the floor of which were found many fragments of drinking vessels for birds, suggesting that at one end of the room there was a large aviary. Fragments of lamps were also found. Beyond is a second cenaculum, not so well preserved. On the opposite side of the street the passageway at No. 7 of Reg. I, Ins. iv was cleared out and several elec- tion notices found on the pilasters at its entrance. In Reg. ix, Ins. x was a hanging balcony, and to the left of it, at a lower level, four rectangular blocks of stuccoed stone, adorned with paintings, which although separated by nar- row spaces, were supported by a wooden structure and formed the architrave of the passageway below. The four blocks of stone were ornamented with paintings of four divinities : Sol, Jupiter, Mercury, and Luna. The pilasters at the side of the passageway were also decorated with paintings, the one on the right of a sacred procession, which has halted to perform a sacri- fice; the other of a large female figure identified as Venus Pompeiana. (G. SPANO, ibid. IX, 1912, pp. 102-120.) The goddess is richly adorned,</page><page sequence="22">116 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XVI, 1913 wearing a golden diadem with a large ruby, on her right hand a ring set with a ruby and on her left five set with emeralds, a necklace, and pearl earrings. She carries in her right hand a five-branched spray of olive. The picture contains also three cupids, one standing on a stool by the side of the goddess and holding a large mirror; the others flying towards her from the right and left. The hanging balcony was to slope slightly from east to west, where there were two openings. One of these conducted the rain water by a lead pipe into a cistern within the shop, while the other carried it to the street. Thus the structure, while a genuine balcony, served also as impluvium pensile. On the other side of the street were found numerous election no- tices, a handsome bronze lamp, and a beautiful couch-back in bronze, orna- mented with the head of a mule or the ass of Silenus, since the head is crowned with a garland of ivy leaves and berries. A large number of elec- tion notices came to light at different points, some of which are of special interest. One mentions a college of quactiliari (coactiliarii); another infec- tores. (M. DELLA CORTE, ibid. IX, 1912, pp. 135-148.) ROME. - Recent Discoveries in the Forum. - Interesting discoveries have lately been made in the Roman Forum, where the south end of the nave of the Basilica Aemilia has been cleared. Three different strata were found: (1) a thin layer of ashes, with coins and remains of wood and iron (the latter belonging probably to the roof) lying on the pavement; (2) a stratum of earth, 3 feet thick, with marble fragments of the architectural mem- bers of the building lying upon it; (3) the west wall of the nave, which fell inward, probably in the eighth century A.D. From this it seems to follow that the building was not restored after the fire of the fifth century A.D., as has been hitherto supposed, with a row of red granite columns along the facade in place of the arcades that had hitherto existed, but that these col- umns had some other use; and that it was not totally destroyed by fire, but lay abandoned until the collapse of the nave wall already mentioned. (Nation, October 24, 1912, p. 393.) Excavations in the Forum of Nerva.- Excavations made in the Forum of Nerva have led to the discovery of the base of the western of the two standing columns, the so-called Colonnacce, the only remnants of the portico of the famous temple of Minerva. These columns had long remained half- buried in the ground; the total depth of the western column below the surface was shown to be no less than 16 feet 4 inches. Other excavations are being carried on at the foot of the celebrated Torre delle Milizie, commonly known as the " Tower of Nero," though it was not erected till about the year 1200. It has now been shown, however, that this mediaeval tower rests partly upon ancient Roman ruins and partly upon an ancient paved street. (Nation, August 29, 1912, p. 199.) Recent Excavations on the Palatine.- Recent excavations on the Palatine have brought to light the representation of a camel at a consider- able depth, a marble head of a woman, a piece of gilt stucco from the dining room of Domnitian, some fragments of mother-of-pearl and a number of writing styli. A piece of pavement proves that opus. Alexandrinum existed before the time of Alexander Severus, probably as early as Nero. (Nation, August 29, 1912, p. 199.) The excavations will soon be opened to the pub- lic. When the clearing of the ddbris from the atrium of Domitian's palace has been completed, a good view will be obtained of the vast impluvium of</page><page sequence="23">ITALY] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 117 the palace of the Caesars. This colossal fountain had a capacity of a thousand cubic metres. The water was distributed in lead pipes from Nero's acqueduct, fifteen feet below the impluvium. The foundations of the Golden House and earlier Caesarian dwellings have been laid bare. Below these have been found some interesting remains, including twelve ancient lifts. One of these lifts, which descends into the earliest known city, is be- ing cleared and put into working order. (Ibid. October 3, 1912, p. 317.) The Excavation at the Baths of Caracalla.- The results of the exten- sive and important excavations on the north side of the Baths of Caracalla are summarized, by G. GATTI in B. Comrn. Rom. XL, 1912, pp. 158-159. The Horrea Seiana.--During the continuation of the Via Giovanni Branca there were found, in the area included between this road, the Via Beniamnino Franklin and the Tiber, remains of walls and several inscriptions (see A. J. A. XVI, p. 446). Among the latter is a dedication to Silvanus by the vilici horreorum (Seianorum), and one by a collegium thuraniorum et un- guentariorum. There was also found a hoard of 770 coins, from Antoninus Pius to Gallienus, so badly damaged by fire that 115 were wholly illegible. Since the walls probably belong to the horrea Seiana, these must have been nearer the river than has been supposed, south of the street leading from the Marmorata to the Tiber. (E. GmISLAZONI, Not. Scav. VIII, 1911, pp. 444-447.) The Horrea Galbiana. - In laying the foundations of a building in the space bounded by the Vie Amerigo Vespucci, della Marmorata, Giovanni Branca, and Cristoforo Colombo numerous walls were discovered, forming a part of the horrea Galbiana. A handsome column base in marble, a metre in diameter, was also found, which was taken to the Capitoline Museum. This seems to have come from the shop of a worker in marble, since with it were found a number of blocks of precious marbles (mainly cippolino and serpen- tine), chips of various kinds of alabaster, and two female heads in ala- baster. (E. GHISLANZONI, Not. Scav. IX, 1912, pp. 121-122.) A Large Tomb.- Near the eighth milestone, on the right of the Via Anagnina, was found a large tomb. Near it was a fine portrait head of a triumphator in Luna marble, ascribed to the end of the first or the begin- ning of the second century, and another head, badly damaged, of the same person or of his wife. These seem to have formed a part of the external decoration of the monument. There were also found fragments of a large and richly decorated sarcophagus, ascribed to the middle of the second cen- tury of the empire, and near by the traces of a road running from west to east on the left of the Via Latina. (G. MANcINIs, Not. Scav. IX, 1912, pp. 34-38.) Ancient Roads. - In constructing the new Via dei Parioli, 60 m. from its junction with the Via di Porta Pinciana, were found the remains of an ancient road running in the same direction as the Via dei Parioli. A num- her of tombs and inscriptions were discovered, including one slab inscribed on both sides and a Christian inscription with z for consonant i (huzus= huius). (O. MANCINI, Not. Scar. IX, 1912, pp. 43-47.) Excavations for a church on the Via Sicilia, at the corner of the Via Toscana, at a depth of 2.40 m., brought to light an ancient paved road running from north to south, (E. GHISLANZONI, ibid. VIII, 1911, p. 443.) At the corner of the Via Porta Maggiore and the Via Principessa Margherita a road was found running</page><page sequence="24">118 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XVII, 1913 north and south, and near by a columbariumn and two sepulchral chambers. Several inscriptions and pieces of sculpture were also discovered. (E. GHISLANZONI, ibid. VIII, 1911, pp. 393-403; fig.) A Marble Group.--At Tre Fontane was found a statue of a youth in Luna marble, lying on a couch without supports, but provided with pillows and stragula. At his right are the feet of another person, and a part of the legs and arms; at his left a serpent, which is approaching to eat an egg, which the youth holds in his left hand. The group is assigned to the first part of the first century of our era. (E. GHISLABNZONI, Not. Scav. IX, 1912, pp. 38-42.) Pragments of Sculpture.- Near the seventh milestone, and about 600 m. from the Via Salaria, traces of a small bridge were found, besides numerous fragments of marble. Among the latter was a female torso, probably a Diana; a fragment of a marble dog, probably forming part of a group with the latter; a Doric capital with a fragmentary in- scription; and part of an inscribed cippus. (A. PASQUI, Not. Scav. IX, 1912, pp. 21-22.) Inscriptions.- At the corner of the Via Tre Madonne and the Vicolo Sachetti remains of tombs were found with several inscriptions, one of which is noteworthy as recording the day of a child's death. (E. GHISLANZONI, Not. Scav. IX, 1912, pp. 15-16.) At No. 219 of the Via Casilia, about 3 km. from the Porta Maggiore, were found a sepulchral chamber containing a sarcophagus in Luna marble, and in and near it a number of inscriptions, including a fragment of Acta ad sepulcra spectantia (cf. C.LL. VI, pp. 1355 and 3502). (E. GHIZLANZONI, Not. Scav. IX, 1912, pp. 16-21.) Forty-five inscriptions were found in a columbarium on the Via Labicana, and a few others in the Via Portuense. (E. GHIS- LAXZONI, ibid. pp. 122-127.) Other recently found inscriptions are published by G. GATTI, B. Comrn. Rom. XL, 1912, pp. 160-175. A Temple of Mithra. - One of the largest, most complete, and most important temples of Mithra is being unearthed in the vast excava- tions now proceeding at the Baths of Caracalla at Rome. The temple proper underlies the stadium, which consists of a central nave 75 feet long, flanked on either side by an aisle. Many relics of Mithra worship are coming to light, among them a number of valuable inscriptions. (Nation, October 3, 1912, p. 317.) Changes in the Capitoline Museum. - The Egyptian and Christian monuments in the Capitoline Museum have been recently rearranged. Of the former the most important were discovered in the excavation of thle large temple of Isis anid Serapis, near the church of S. Maria sopra Minerva, in 1883. (0. MARUCCHI, B. Comn. Rom. XL, 1912, pp. 3-14.) The International Congress of Archaeology. - In the Nation, November 14, 1912, pp. 467-468, is a brief account of the third Interna- tional Congress of Archaeology, held at Rome, October 9 to 16, 1912. SPAIN AND PORTUGAL DISCOVERIES IN SPAIN AND PORTUGAL. - The biennial review of work in the Iberian peninsula, by P. PARIS, occupies cols. 403-468 of Arch. Anz. 1912 (56 figs.). He mentions, with frequent reference to the</page><page sequence="25">SPAIN AND PORTUGAL] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 119 original publications, the grottoes and rock-shelters of the Asturias, Aragon, and Andalusia; the Iberian city of Numantia underneath the Roman remains; the native, Greek, and Roman settlements at Emporiae; and the Roman Merida; and illustrates their art, both native and imported. Among the objects to be noted are the palaeolithic rock-paintings of the grottoes, which display an extraordinary life and vigor; some primitive anthropomorphic stelae from Portugal, which are equally remarkable for their infantile lack of skill; some fragments of Iberian sculpture, of varying degrees of merit; the native pottery of Aragon and Catalonia, with some idols and a terra-cotta from Numantia, all extremely crude; an Iberian vase from Ampurias (Emporiae), in which the vivifying effect of Greek influence is seen; Greek vases and Arretine and Gallic terra sigillata, with one doubtful little amphora having a raised design; a beautiful marble head of a goddess, suggestive of the school of Scopas; a Graeco-Roman colossal statue of Asclepius; a fine archaic statuette of Demeter; two plaques from bronze-coated coffers, one a Dioscurus, the other a complicated Mithraic composition, - these, too, all from Ampurias; a colossal seated statue of Demeter which vividly recalls the Demeter of Cnidus; some incredibly primitive native stelae of the Roman period; and two Greek bas-reliefs, the Dioscuri from Javea and a puteal from Cordova, which represents the rivalry of Athena and Poseidon on the Acropolis. Among the inscriptions the most interesting are those which give the names of native divinities--the Lucoves, Jupiter Ahoparalio- megus, a goddess Reva (patroness of the Arevaces?), the god Aernus, and the goddess Stelatesa. AGUILAR DE ANGUITA. - The Excavations of the Marquis of Cerralbo.--In C. R. Acad. lnsc. 1912, pp. 433-443, J. D1CHELETTE describes the excavations of the Marquis of Cerralbo in Spain. At Torralba he has uncovered an elephant hunters' camp. At Aguilar de Anguita (Guadalajara) he has opened about 2200 graves, and at Luzaga, 6 km. to the southeast, 1813 more, and in addition 30() other graves at Arcobriga. The bodies in all of these had been burned and the ashes deposited in urns. In the women's graves were bracelets, etc., and in the men's graves weapons. They were chiefly of iron, consisting of daggers and lances; but bronze disks, adorned with simple geometric designs and fastened together by means of bands, were used to protect the chest and back. A curious iron object resembling a collar was perhaps used to support a woman's headdress. Many pieces of harness were found, and nine iron horseshoes. Another iron horseshoe has recently been found on a Hallstatt site near Nancy. The graves probably date from the fourth century B.C. and later. The weapons show Greek influence, but no im- ported objects were found. MADRID. - An Iberian Lion. - In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1912, pp. 162-164 (fig.), E. ALBERTINI publishes a lion from Cerro del Minguillar recently acquired by the museum in Madrid. It is 1.07 m. long, carved out of a soft calcareous stone and carefully polished. It is an interesting specimen of early Iberian art. NUMANTIA. - The Seventh Campaign. - The seventh campaign of the German excavations, that of 1911, is reported by A. SCHULTEN in Arch. Anz. 1912, cols. 82-89 (2 plans; 6 figs.). The work was chiefly on</page><page sequence="26">120 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 the five overlapping camps on the hill of Renieblas, to the east of the city, completing the outlines and adding many details of the inner con- structions, especially of Camp III, by which the dates and purposes of the different enclosures may be learned. Nos. I-III are of quite irregular shapes, adapted to the contour of the hill. Camp II is now held to be an in- dependent work, near to I in date, and not an enlargement of III. The last- mentioned camp, assigned to Nobilior in the year 153, received the greatest amount of attention. It presents interesting variations from the normal arrangements for that epoch as given by Polybius, resembling, in the position of the forum and quaestorium, behind the praetorium, the older plans of the period 294-178, described by Livy. The number of victoriati found in this camp is noticeable, as these coins were all stamped before 217 B.c. It is evident in the plan that the Roman citizen troops took much the best positions in the camp, leaving the steep and exposed parts for the Italian allies. Camps IV and V, both quadrangular in shape, appear to be a summer and a winter camp, and of the same epoch, perhaps of the same year. One of the gates, on the plan of the Porta Praetoria at Aosta, of the time of Augustus, having a court flanked by two strong towers, is of interest for the early date. We see here a bracchium, a wall running from a corner of the camp down to the river, as a means of secur- ing the water supply. The tribunes' quarters have a tricliniumn and other evidences of some luxury. Two other camps, also apparently belonging to the Celtiberian War, have been found at Soria and Almazan. The latter, which is 40 km., or two days' march, from both Numantia and Ocilis, where the Romans had their stores in 153, probably marks a stopping place of Nobilior on this road, and the intermediate stations on both sides of it are still to be sought. Much other important work, at these places and at Renieblas and elsewhere in the region, including the site of Numantia itself, is urgently needed to complete our knowledge of this war. In the Journal of Roman Studies, I, 1911, pp. 180-186 (pl.; 3 figs.), G. L. CHEESMAN gives an account of the excavations at Numantia to date. FRANCE ARCHAEOLOGY IN FRANCE IN 1911. - Among the discoveries, most of which have been published, the following may be mentioned: A cast of the Venus of Arles, made before the restoration by Girardon, in a school at Arles; at Merveille (Nord), three bronze figures (A.J.A. XVI, p. 134); at Alesia, parts of the fortifications, in the Gallic timber and stone construction, a large atrium, 26-20 m., with porticoes supported by square pillars, and the first example found on Mont Auxois of a grave-stone with portrait of the dead; at Nantes, in the foundations of the ancient church of St. John, two basins, one of them certainly Roman, which are thought to be the fonts of the original fourth-century Baptistery; on the hill Fourvibre near Lyons, the somewhat elaborate mausoleum of a boy or young man, erected by his parents, and a large mosaic floor, 14 m. square, with a picture of Bacchus riding on the panther, a very fine specimen of the style of the Antonine period; at Vaison (Vaucluse), a double herm and other objects in the theatre, where also some investigations of impor- tance for the architecture of ancient theatres have been made; at Castel-</page><page sequence="27">FRANCE] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 121 Rousillon (Eastern Pyrenees), the dimensions of the ancient forum, ca. 48-33 m., and forty large pedestals arranged about the sides, one of which bears the name of P. Memmius Regulus, consul suffectus in 31 A.D., who was intrusted by Tiberius with the arrest of Sejanus in the Senate; at Vaugines (Vaucluse), an altar table carved with Christian symbols, which is perhaps later than those of the fifth or sixth centuries, but still ancient. (E. MICHON, Arch. Anz. 1912, cols. 469-477; 4 figs.) DORDOGNE. --Prehistoric Skeletons. --In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1912, pp. 449-454, Dr. CAPITAN and M. PEYRONY call attention to two skeletons of children recently found in graves in the lower part of the Mousterian level at La Ferrassie; and another skeleton dating from the Magdalenian epoch found at Cap Blanc. The last mentioned lay on its left side with elbow touching the knee. Both sites are in Dordogne. LYONS. - Recent Discoveries. - B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1912, pp. 283-286, A. HERON DE VILLEFOSSE calls attention to the excavations of S. de Mon- tauzan and P. Fabia at Lyons last winter. Among the objects found were an ivory mask of Pan, some marbles, clay moulds for making money, and some pieces of pottery. One of the vase fragments has an erotic scene known from the other examples and inscribed tene[o te]. MONTELS. - A Primitive Figure in Relief. - In Bul. de la Soc. Arch. du Midi de la France, No. 40, 1912, pp. 141-143 (fig.), Abbd HERMET pub- lishes a stone 80 cm. high, 60 cm. wide, and 12 to 15 cm. thick, upon one side of which is carved a very primitive human figure. It was found at Montels, Commune of la Serre, in 1907, and has recently been removed to Toulouse. PARIS. - A Glass Cup. - In R. Arch. XX, 1912, p. 172 (4 figs.), S. R. briefly describes a glass cup from Heraclea on the Pontus which was sold at the H6tel Drouot for 64,000 francs to Mr. Sambon. The real purchaser is, perhaps, Mr. J. P. Morgan. The cup is blue, with white figures. The subjects are related to the cult of Priapus. REIMS. - Gallic Vases.--In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1912, pp. 279-283, L. DEMAISON calls attention to two Gallic vases found in the commune of B4theny and recently acquired by the museum at Reimns. One is urn- shaped and decorated with horses in light on a dark ground. The second vase, which is badly broken, had a similar decoration. He also publishes three small Latin inscriptions. SAINT-MICAUD.- A Menhir with Decoration. - In 1871 a menhir at Saint-Micaud (Saine-et-Loire) which had long been known was thrown down. This has now been set up again and upon it has been discovered a carved decoration consisting of several figures: One of these evidently represents a horned serpent, which proves that the figures were added to the stone in Gallo-Roman times. (J. DECHELETTE, M. Soc. Ant. Fr. LXXI, 1911, pp. 1-13; 4 figs.) TOULOUSE. - The Roman Town Wall.- In Bul. de la Soc. Arch. du Midi de la France, No. 40, 1912, pp. 57-62 (plan), J. CHALANDE describes two pieces of the Roman town wall recently discovered at Toulouse. They are about 25 m. long and apparently date from the reign of D)iocletian. A Horned Deity. - In Bul. de la Soc.

XVII, 1913 BELGIUM AND HOLLAND ARCHAEOLOGY IN BELGIUM IN 1911. - The chief event of the year, important for prehistoric chronology, was the discovery near Lidge of worked flints underneath certain geological strata five metres or more in depth. Neolithic stations have been found in East Flanders, and at Vaux- et-Borset (Hainaut) sixteen new hut floors have been examined. The numerous small objects found here include fragments of two remarkable jars of fine black clay, and with geometrical ornament incised or punched. The foundations of an important Belgo-Roman villa were found (A.J.A. XVI, p. 448) at Haulchin (Hainaut). A stairway leads down to an under- ground story, with niches in the walls. Another at Try Solet (Namur) shows the now well-known type, with wings projecting forward from both ends of the long building behind which is the court or farmyard. Excava- tions carried on outside the gates of Tongres (Limburg) have produced a variety of objects from Belgo-Roman graves, including coins of Antoninus and Marcus Aurelius. Outside the gate of St. Trond was found a huge jar of gray earthenware, measuring 90 cm. in height and perhaps 2 mn. in girth. Merovingian burial places were examined at Vyle-Tharoul and at Barse (Lihge) and at Brecht (Anvers). Opposite the last was found one belonging to the Hallstatt period. (L. RENARD-GRENSON, Arch.

DE LoiE reports the discovery of another hearth at Vaux-et-Borset (Province of Lihge). Stone implements and potsherds were found in abundance. Ancient re- mains of little importance were unearthed at Wenduyne, Renaix, Fur- fooz, Ciney, and Goyet; and a small circular fort probably of Belgo-Roman date near Heinstert. VORBURG.- A Roman Fort. - In Ram.-Germ. Kb. V, 1912, pp. 71- 75, J. H. HOLWERDA reports on the results of excavations conducted during a period of two years on the Arentsburg, an estate at Vorburg, Holland. The wall of a Roman fort was traced on the north and west sides; one of the gates was located and remains were found of wooden barracks, belonging to different periods. Judging from the pottery, the fort was originally gar- risoned by native troops; the later barracks date from the middle of the second century. Most interesting results were obtained on the south side, where it developed that the wall, resting on piles, continued into tile water of the canal. The fort was evidently a naval station. SWITZERLAND ARCHAEOLOGY IN SWITZERLAND IN 1911-1912.- An account of the work done and results reached by various societies and individuals excavating in Switzerland in 1911 and 1912, with especial atten- tion to Vindonissa, is given by O. SCHULTHESS in Arch. Anz. 1912, cols. 496-525. At La TBne the arms of a warrior and remains of the ox cart with which he must have been drowned were found in the river. At Basle, on the bank of the Rhine, a number of round Gallic house floors or pits were found. A decorated vase from here is of the late La Thne period, about 50 A.D. In Lake Neuch&amp;tel a massive oak rudder, 34 feet long, was</page><page sequence="29">SWITZERLAND] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 19192 123 found, the date of which is uncertain. At Avenches (Aventicum) were found some interesting underground waterworks, with a vaulted reservoir and a fine marble basin or labrum; also a fragment of a bronze inscription, which seems to mention the vicani. At Grenchen (Solothurn) a villa rustica with hypocaust, frescoed walls, and abundant remains of roof tiles, appears to belong to a series of Roman country estates which were founded along the valley of the Aire, on the Vindonissa-Aventicum road, in the third century. At Geneva, a fine female head of Carrara marble, said to have come from Martigny, is of the first century A.D., and illustrates the taste of the Roman ladies for archaistic styles in hair dressing. At Vindonissa, the date of the so-called Celtic moat or ditch on the east side of the camp is still uncertain. It was apparently open and used by the Romans as part of the defences, when they had their first earth-and-timber fort there, and was then reenforced by two smaller parallel ditches. The wider ditch was filled up and built over at the time that their stone camp was built, about 47 A.D. The Biiel tower is judged to be part of the first-century stone fortifications. The Roman road in the Steinacker, which has been followed for some distance, is not earlier than Tiberius. An imposing grave monu- ment (2.90 by 2.60 m.) and other remains indicate the existence of a road and a bridge over the Aare at the Black Tower near Brugg. Other graves belong to a burial place on the road leading to the amphitheatre. At Steinacker are two square buildings with carefully prepared floors, one of which was a wine cellar, and the larger and more pretentious may have served a similar purpose. They are of the first century A.D., and were reduced to their ruined condition in antiquity. An inscription found in the larger building, not in situ, may belong to the later occupation of Vindonissa, before 260 A.D. It gives the name cives Romani to the inhabitants, and has the name of an emperor erased. Some fifty types of the brick stamps of the XXI and XI legions, which are found here and in many other parts of the site of Vindonissa, have been published by V. Jahn. The clay pits and kilns for their manufacture are between Rupperswil and Hunzenschwil. The pre-Roman refugiumn at Obergi5sgen on the Aar is found to have been occupied in the time of Marcus Aurelius, as well as in mediaeval times. Burgundian graves were found at Lausanne, at Cressier (Neuchftel), and probably at St. Maurice; an Allemannic cemetery at Beringen (Schaff- hausen), and an Allemannic skull with earrings at Oberkirch near Frauen- feld. A Celtic and Roman burial field was explored at Gudo, south of Bellinzona. The burial ground at Kaiseraugst (Augusta Rauraca) is barbarian, but contains many Roman coins, especially in the graves of children, and other imported objects, besides those of the Bronze Age. The Roman and other foreign objects found in the Celtic graves of the early La Thne period at Darvella (Eastern Switzerland), and at many other places in this region, indicate a trade route from the south through S, Bernadino, Vals, and Rheinwald.

K1jSTER publishes a red-figured lecythus recently presented to the Berlin museum. It has represented upon it a bearded man wearing chlamys and petasus and holding two spears, seated upon a rock. In front of him stands Heracles who grasps him by the hand and tries to raise him from his seat. The artist evidently had in mind the story of the rescue of Theseus or Peirithous by Heracles in Hades. The vase resembles in style the work of the "Meister mit dem Kahlkopfe," but also shows dif- ferences. An Etruscan Helmet.- In Ber. Kunsts. XXXIII, 1912, cols. 244-250 (3 figs.), B. SCHRODER publishes an Etruscan helmet from Lombardy recently acquired by the Berlin museum. On top of the helmet is the head and neck of a swan which supported the crest, while below, covering either side, is a swan's wing. In front, below a moulding, are two large eyes with eyebrows, and between them a mask with what looks like wings attached. At the back is another mask. The helmet dates from the end of the sixth or beginning of the fifth century. The writer also calls attention to another recent acquisi- tion, - a Roman legionary helmet from Egypt. Reminiscences of Eduard Gerhard.- The tribute paid to his old teacher, Eduard Gerhard, by the late R. Kekulb von Stradonitz, at the last meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society at which he was present and presided (Winckelsmannsfest, December, 1910), has been printed as a separate pamphlet by G. Reimer of Berlin. The speaker gave his personal reminiscences of the founder of the society together with an account of his other services to archaeology, including the organization of the German Institute at Rome.

ESCHWEILER HOF.- A Roman Pottery.- A factory for the manufacture of sigilla ware with a very well preserved kiln was recently discovered at Eschweiler Hof (near St. Ingbert). The pottery was placed in the Pfalz museum at Speyer. (F. SPRATER, Rim.-Germ. Kb. V, 1912, p. 78.) FRANKFORT. - The Gans Collection.- F. Gans, of Frankfort-on- the-Main, has presented to the Antiquarium at Berlin his entire collection, amounting to 643 numbers, of specimens of the minor arts of antiquity, con- sisting chiefly of gold objects and glass. The collection is valued at more than a million and a half marks. (Arch. Anz. 1912, col. 144.) HALBERSTADT. - Origin of the " Spool" Handle. - A curious parallel in clay to the spool-shaped handles of the silver dove-vase from Mycenae, the gold cups from Vaphio, and other contemporary silver cups, whether from the graves at Mycenae or on Egyptian tomb paintings of about 1500 B.c., has appeared in the museum of Halberstadt. It came from an early bronze-age burial field at Nienhagen, in Saxony, and perhaps from the same grave as a handled pot which is of the type called Aunjetite, prob- ably as early as 2000 B.c. This circumstance and a study of the form itself suggest that the handle of the clay cup is not modelled after a similar one in metal, but both are copied from an original in wood. (H.

SIEVEKING, and illustrated in Arch. Anz. 1912, cols. 104-110 (11 figs.). Among the works of sculpture are a nearly perfect though badly weathered Apollo statue some- what later than the Apollo of Tenea; the gravestone of Mnesarete, a piece worthy to stand beside that of Hegeso, but slightly later; a funeral lecythus with figures in half relief, giving a plastic rather than the pictorial effect of earlier vases of the kind; a female head from an Attic relief, showing the earliest attempt to vary the traditional type by marks of age; a female panther, which apparently stood as a single figure on a funeral monument. There are five bronzes, including a pair of connected mirrors for giving double reflection; sixteen terra-cottas from Athens, Boeotia, Asia Minor, and Rome, consisting of heads, statuettes, vessels, and one relief; also a curious lead relief from Rome; and fourteen vases from Athens, Aegina, Boeotia, Corinth, Rhodes, and Crete.

AUSTRIA-H UN GARY ARCHAEOLOGY IN HUNGARY IN 1911.- A summary of recent work in the Roman provinces of Dacia and Pannonia, by G. v. FINALY, is published in Arch. Anz. 1912, cols. 526-546 (7 figs.). In Transylvania, at Carlsburg (Apulum), the Roman remains are now divided into four sections, the garrison camp, the earlier and later civil settlements (Municipium Apulense and Colonia Apulensis), and the street of tombs between these. Pottery found in the kilns is Roman in shape but of La Thne technique, hence is earlier than the occupation by Marcus Aurelius. A study of the capitals from Pannonia and Dacia in the museum at Apulum shows Doric and Tuscan, Corinthian and Egyptian styles, with Oriental influence, but no examples of Ionic or Composite. In the mining town of Zalatna (Ampe- lum) remains of the Roman mine shafts and a water reservoir were found. Further north, the garrison camp at Szamosujv.r is identified as Congri. The foundations of round buildings found at Thorda (Potaissa) probably belong to wooden watch towers. A Roman villa at Klausenburg (Napoca) shows how the Romanization of the country had spread outside of the province. Of twenty Latin inscriptions from Dacia, about a third come from north of Klausenburg (dedications by Aelius Julius and P. Aelius Maximus) and the same number from in or near Varhily (Sarmizegetusa, capital of Dacia). Among the latter is a dedication to the moon-god Men and one to Caelestis Virgo, both new in Dacia. Others are dedications by Roman officers who are already known epigraphically. A number of medallion-shaped Roman gravestones from Dacia have been published. They have one or more portrait heads on a concave circular surface. In Pannonia a plan of the ruins at Dunapentele (Intercisa) has been made, but is somewhat incomplete owing to the depredations of plunderers. It shows that the military camp was on the north side and the necropolis on the south side of the hill, Oreghegy. The inscriptions include two</page><page sequence="33">RUSSIA] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 127 milestones, of Elagabalus and Gordian. A bronze statuette of a river-god belonging to a group of which the other figure is lost, may be the river Danube with the Tyche of Intercisa, after the model of the Antiochia and Orontes of Eutychides. Among the reliefs from some fourth-century graves, one gives a detailed rendering of the Pannonian woman's costume. Some bronze helmets found at Intercisa are made in halves joined by a ridge or crest which shows Greek rather than Roman models. Three reliefs with the Thracian horseman, one of them with a Greek inscription, are evidence of the wide range of this cult. Various Roman remains were found at Oedenburg, on the Neusiedler See (Scarbantia), and include dedications by three veterans of Italian, probably Campanian, birth. A very delicately carved gravestone bears the names of the wife and three children of C. Sextilius Senecio. Inscriptions, coins, etc., were found at Fiinf-Kirchen (Sopranae), in southern Pannonia, and objects found in the barbarian tract between the )Danube and the Theiss show an active Roman trade in this extra-provincial region. A study of the gold coinage of these provinces distinguishes several classes, of native, Bohemian, and imported impressions. The nations to the northwest imitated the gold coinage of Alexander, while the peoples of Hungary followed the earlier silver coinage of Phillip. The gold used for minting in the Danubian lands was taken as booty, as none is mined there. CSOKLOVINA. - Diluvial Remains.-- In Dolgozatok az Erde'lyi Nemzeti Mdizeum, III, 1912, pp. 201-249 (36 figs.), M. ROSKA describes his recent excavations in the cave of Cholnoky at Csoklovina, Hungary. Many stone implements, some objects of bone, and numerous remains of the cave: bear were found. The objects belong to a transition period between Mousterian and Aurignacian. RUSSIA ARCHAEOLOGY IN RUSSIA IN 1911.- The results of excavations in Southern Russia in 1911, together with some acquisitions of the Imperial Museums from other sources, are described by B. PHARMAKOWSKY in A rch. Anz. 1912, cols. 323-381 (74 figs.). The excavations were conducted in the Kuban region and at Kertch (Panticapaeum) by W. W. Shkorpil; at. Chersonesus by R. C. Loeper and M. M. Petchowkin; in Tanais by W. W. Miller; in the interior of Tauris by N. J. Wesselowsky, and in Olbia by the writer. The cemetery on the peninsula of Taman, in the Kuban District, consists of simple shaft graves dating from the sixth century to Roman times. Many of them contain remains of food and almost all some of the small glass vessels known as Phoenician, which were a favorite article with Ionian colonists on the Pontus. The pottery is Corinthian, Ionian, and Attic, of all periods and shapes. A high-footed cylix, with simple decoration of bands and a rosette in dark glaze, has a double-axe irregularly painted in red on the outside. Other objects from Taman are a terra-cotta doll with movable arms and legs, and a spray of gold oak leaves and acorns, dated by a stater of Alexander the Great. Some elaborate gold objects, perhaps used as cas- ings for glass vessels, are of the R6man period, about the first century A.D. They are supposed to have been found in the Kuban region. That the site of New Chersonesus was occupied as early as the sixth century is shown by the archaic terra-cottas found there. Other objects are a Megarian bowl, Hellenistic figurines, a Roman relief bowl, and Byzantine glazed vessels.</page><page sequence="34">128 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XVII, 1913 The remains on the site of Old Chersonesus give a good picture of the ap- pearance of a Greek cleruchy. Three small bronze painter's tools, a sort of spoon and a blunt-pointed instrument in a bronze case, and another object like the second, with wooden handle and silver ornamentation, were found at Chersonesus. Objects from Panticapaeum were found chiefly in graves, most of which belong to thle archaic period following 550 B.c.; but some are of Hellenistic date. Among them are a terra-cotta relief of an elephant, a small vase of Egyptian porcelain in the form of a bear with her young, a car- nelian ring-bezel with a fine ittaglio figure of a standing lion, dated by a pelice in the same grave as of the period 550-500 B.C.; several reliefs from the bottoms of cylices, one showing the head of a Silenus with thyrsus and cantharus, another the head of Selene; also several marble and limestone stelae with gables and panels in relief, one of them of colossal size. Two Panathenaic amphorae, one from Panticapaeum of the end of the sixth cen- tury and one from Tanais of the second half of the fifth, have pictures of musical contests on the reverse, an evidence that such contests received prizes. Branchitsch's chronology of the prize amphorae, which excludes the fifth century, seems to be faulty. At Olbia, a second area was carefully exca- vated and the relations of the various strata studied. A square well at this spot belongs to the sixth layer from the top. The house of the fifth stratum had two periods, with floors at slightly different levels. The walls of the house of the fourth stratum rest directly on the upper of these pavements. The third stratum is dated by an inscription of the time of Alexander Severus, dedicating a temple to three pairs of divinities, Sarapis and Isis, Asclepius and Hygieia, and Poseidon and Amphitrite. There were probably three cellae. The earliest graves in the necropolis are of about 600 B.c. Before this time, as at Berezany, the dead were burned and the bones buried in jars among the houses. One grave contained seventeen pointed amphorae arranged in a circle around the ash-urn, the points inward. The grave of a little girl, with rich furnishings of ornaments and small vases, is dated at about 560 B.C. A circular space in the cemetery, surrounded with masonry and containing no graves, was probably a place for religious services. A set of four bronze goat's feet, found at Olbia, must have belonged to somle piece of wooden furniture. An amulet of glass paste, in the form of a ram's head with a scorpion outlined on the flat end, suggests that the ram's head was apotropaic. A curious object found in a woman's grave is a sprinkler vase, from which, when filled by immersion, a shower could be dropped through the perforated bottom by unstopping the opening in the hollow handle. Some tumuli were opened in the Taurian Government. The horses here were not buried alive, as has been supposed by some to have been the custom. Bronze and silver horse trappings with plastic and incised decora- tion were found here and at other places. Two small bronze implements enclosed in wooden cases which fitted them exactly were found in the Gov- ernment of Kiev. They may be primitive surgical instruments. The bodies in the graves of this region show signs of partial burning and seem to have been wrapped in a pelt. A vast quantity of imported pottery of all kinds was found on all sites, some of it being of great value and interest. Much of the Ionian pottery may have been made in Samos. Among the small articles are many beautiful pieces of Greek and Roman goldsmith's work, the earrings being especially numerous.</page><page sequence="35">GREAT BRITAIN] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1916 129 GREAT BRITAIN ARCHAEOLOGY IN GREAT BRITAIN IN 1911-1912.- Excava- tions were carried on in 1911-1912 in Scotland at Cappuck, Corbridge, and Birdoswald; on the Yorkshire coast; and at Cartle Collen in Wales. Cap- puck, on the Roman road formerly called Deer Street, running from York through Corbridge to Newstead on the Tweed, is about twenty-six miles from the latter place at the north foot of the Cheviot Hills. It has a small fort 60-70 metres, surrounded by an earth wall on stone foundation and a moat, these defences being strengthened on the east side where the entrance was. The enclosure contained a granary, a bath, a central building and apparently barracks. A corner has been washed away by the river Oxnam. The place seems to have been occupied first under Agricola and again in the latter half of the second century and abandoned about 180 A.D. At Corbridge (Corstopitum) a horde of 159 gold coins, from Nero to Marcus Aurelius, was found buried in a court or house, and is now in the British Museum (A.J.A. XVI, p. 141). It is the largest find of the kind made in Great Britain except one at Cleeve Priory, about a hundred years ago. It must have been buried at the time of an uprising in North Britain soon after 160 A.D., when the place was plundered and burnt, and it gives a date for the sherds found in the ruins of a pottery about five years ago. Of the two inscriptions found this year at Corbridge, one is a simple gravestone for Barathes of Palmyra, already known by the lavishly decorated monu- ment that he erected for his wife, a British woman, at South Shields, some twenty-four miles away. He is now seen to have been a soldier and not a Syrian merchant. The other inscription is a military dedication to Sol Invictus, of about 160-165, with the name of the god erased, possibly at the time of the fall of Elagabalus in 222. Among the sculptures are a relief of a woman churning, in the attitude of a goddess pouring a libation on an altar, which is possibly a gravestone; part of a panel carved with a grape- vine, and two badly injured slabs, with a satyr playing the double flutes and the wolf and twins. The road body in which they were found will be further searched. At Birdoswald (Amboglanna), in that section of Hadrian's Wall where a turf wall running near the river Irthing seems to have been replaced by a later stone wall on a different line, it has been assumed that the two periods were those of Hadrian and Septimius Severus, but objects found in the towers and stations of the outer wall are much earlier than Severus, and the question of date is again unsettled. The fort at the eastern end of Hadrian's Wall and one in the Wall of Antoninus have been found where they were supposed to be. On a cliff high above the sea near Saltburn, on the north coast of Yorkshire, a small stone fort, half of which has fallen into the sea with the wearing away of the cliff, has been excavated, and from the coins and sherds found is seen to belong to the last years of the fourth century. Similar fortified posts at Peak on Robin- Hood's Bay, at Filey and near Whitby, evidently were parts of a guard system for watching the approach of a foe by sea. Excavations at Collen in Wales were not very profitable because not scientifically carried on. Better results are expected from the complete and systematic excavation of the Roman-British settlement of Viroconium at Wroxeter, near Shrewsbury.

The inner wall does not completely surround the island but bends back on the south side. In the middle of the island a number of squared pillars with masons' marks upon them were found. These belonged to the foundations of Carthaginian buildings as the Phoe- nician letters on some of them show. The other remains unearthed were very scanty. A Corinthian Amphora. - In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1912, pp. 341-344 (fig.), D. ANZIANI publishes a Corinthian amphora 35 cm. high recently found in a tomb dating from the sixth century B.c. in the cemetery of Bordj-Djedid at Carthage. This is the only large Corinthian vase yet found at Carthage. HENCHIR-BELLONE. - A Latin Inscription. - In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1912, pp. 236-237, P. DE LESSERT publishes a Latin inscription dating from the year 228 A.D. in which the formula dedicata ex VI kal. jan. occurs.</page><page sequence="37">UNITED STATES] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1916 131 MEDEINA. - Recent Excavations. - In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1912, pp. 417-426, A. MERLIN reports upon the excavations made last spring at Medeina, the ancient Althiburos. In the northeast part of the forum a series of small buildings was uncovered. To the southwest a road with a monumental gateway at each end led to the capitol. An inscription shows that one of the gates was erected in honor of Hadrian. About 30 m. south of the forum was a large structure, which was, perhaps, a fountain. SAHEL. -A Recent Expedition. - In Arch. Miss. N.S. 4, 1911, pp. 17-52, F. DE ZELTNER reports upon an expedition made by him in the country between Kayes and Timbuctoo. Starting from the colony of Haut- S66gal-Niger, he went to Nioro, then to Goumbou, Sokolo, and Niafunk6, and by boat to Timbuctoo. He calls attention to the prehistoric remains, especially the cave paintings in the valley of the Senegal. They are in the front part of the caves and consist of scenes in red ochre representing men and horses; also squares and dots. Jackals or dogs are found painted in white, and hallds in silhouette. Dark blue, black, and, rarely, pink were also used. The writer discusses the anthropology of the region, the various local industries, dress, ornaments, etc. THAPSUS. - Phoenician Cemeteries.- In Mel. Arch. Hist. XXXII, 1912, pp. 245-303, D. ANZIANI describes his recent excavations in the Phoenician cemeteries on the Tunisian coast between Thapsus and Acholla, the most important group of Phoenician tombs after that of Carthage. He supplements earlier incomplete reports, and is able to arrive at some definite conclusions with respect to the historical development of this district. THUBURBO MAJUS. - Recent Discoveries.- In C. R. A cad. Insc. 1912, pp. 347-360 (3 figs.), A. MEERLIN reports upon the recent excavations of L. Drappier at Henchir Kasbat, the ancient Thuburbo Majus. Building G was a temnple of Saturn as an inscription shows. It stood within an en- closed precinct. Building F, at a distance of about 150 mn., was more conm- pletely excavated. It was originally a temple, probably dedicated to Baal- Saturn and Tanit-Ceres, and in later times transformed into a Christian church. There was an open court with Doric porticoes on three sides, and at the back a chamber 6 m. square which was the sanctuary. An interest- ing ex-voto was found in the form of a small temple, Hellenic and Oriental in character. On the fagade was a Phoenician inscription in three lines, now almost wholly destroyed. In front of the entrance to the church were four column bases arranged in a square, and within, a woman's tomb. A necklace of gold pendants and glass beads alternating, two earrings, a ring, and two fibulae were found in the tomb. UNITED STATES BOSTON. - An Exhibition of Electrum Coins.- In B. Mus. F. A. X, 1912, pp. 38-41 (46 figs.), L. D. C(ASKEY) gives a general account of elec- trumn coinage in calling attention to 367 electrum coins recently put on ex- hibition in the Boston Museum of Fine Arts. They are chiefly from Cyzicus, Lydia, Lesbos, alld Phocaea. The majority came from the Warren collec- tion, of which 1432 specimens were acquired by the Museum.</page><page sequence="38">132 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL.

A. BEY publishes new readings for fifty Christian and Byzantine inscriptions. CAPPADOCIA. -Byzantine Churches and their Iconography. - G. D. JERPHANION contributes to C. R. Acad. Insc. 1912, pp. 320-326, an account of his archaeological exploration of Cappadocia, enumerating the unknown churches which he visited, and describing their frescoes, one of which, a Crucifixion at Soghanle, he is inclined to ascribe to the eighth century. Ibid. pp. 326-336, G. MILLET points out the importance of these discoveries from the point of view of the historian of Byzantine art and iconography, showing that the art of Cappadocia up to ca. 1000 was impreg- nated with the Oriental style, which was gradually supplanted by the Hel- lenistic art of Constantinople in consequence of the Byzantine conquests in Asia in the tenth century. CONSTANTINOPLE. - A Byzantine Temple.- Some Turkish work- men, while digging a canal near the mosque of Mohammed the Conqueror, in Stamboul, unearthed a number of remains which have been identified as belonging to a Byzantine temple. Well-preserved capitals with reliefs of Greek crosses were found, as well as a number of columns, and parts of the walls of the temple. The digging went on for a number of days without competent supervision, and when the director of the museum was at last in- formed of the discoveries, it was found that a number of valuable objects had already disappeared. (Nation, October 17, 1912, p. 368.) SAMARRA. - Early Mohammedan Art. - The history and remains of Samarra on the Tigris, two days' journey north of Bagdad, were described and pictured at the April (1912) meeting of the Berlin Archaeological Society, by E. Herzfeld and F. Sarre, who carried on explorations there in 1907-1908 and 1911. The city was founded in 836, by the second son of Harun-al-Rashid, who got into difficulties with the populace of Bagdad, and after a phenomenal growth and an equally rapid decay under his suc- cessors, it was abandoned in 876. Thus its material remains, belonging to a single period of forty years, must present an unmixed picture of early Is- lamic art and customs, from which the degree of Hellenistic influence at that period can be studied. They form the largest ruined site known. The work of excavation in 1911 was spent upon the great mosque, the largest in exist- ence (fiat roof, mosaic floors, walls covered with glass mosaic on gold ground); on some twenty private houses, a fortress on the river bank with the tombs of three of the Caliphs; and a huge palace, in the southern part of the city, which was a sort of camp-palace, modelled after a Roman cohort's quarters in a legionary camp, like the palaces of the earliest Islamic times, near Babylon and elsewhere. (Arch. Anz. 1912, cols. 135-139.) WORKS OF NICCOLO ALUNNO. - In Boll. Arte, VI, 1912, pp. 248- 262, U. GNOLI describes a number of unknown or undetected works of Niccolo Alunno. He points out that two panels of the predella of Niccolo's triptych in the Pinacoteca Vaticana are to be found in a little Ascension in</page><page sequence="39">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 133 the museum of Compidgne and a "Presepio" in Moulins. The panels which originally adorned the lateral pinacles are in the museum of Tours. Other decorative panels of the triptych are to be found in Caen and elsewhere. The writer adds to the euvre of Niccolo a "Pentecost" in the episcopal palace of Camerino, a standard in the possession of the Contessa Crivelli in Snase- verino (Marche), and another standard in S. Maria Maggiore at BIettona. The article closes with a list of lost works by the painter.

The picture in time came into the possession of Pius VI, a copy by Constantini being left in Citth di Castello. At the taking of Rome by the French in 1798 the picture, which was already in fragments, was lost. Raphael's drawings for various figures of the picture are pre- served in Lille, Oxford, and the British Museum, and have long been known. It is not known, however, that portions of the original still exist, viz. the figure of God holding the crown at the top of the picture, which is in the ~ ~b~y~lh~ ~ " FIGURE 6.- RAPHAEL.

Kunsts. XXXIII, 1912, pp. 105-121.) Further articles supplement- ing Fischel's discovery are contributed to Boll. Arte, VI, 1912, pp. 329-339, by CORRADO RICCI, G. ZAPPA, and V. SPINAZZOLA. The picture in Brescia was cleaned in consequence of Fischel's article, and as a result the wings of the angel may now be seen, and in the upper left-hand corner a portion of</page><page sequence="41">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 135 S.

The recovered fragments may be seen in the accompanying illustrations (Figs. 5 and 6). Ricci points out that the lack of distinctively Peruginesque quali- ties bears out the theory that Raphael worked first with Timoteo Viti. BOLSENA.--A Barbarian Cemetery.--Behind the church of S. Cristina there was recently brought to light a series of tombs of the fifth or sixth century, forming a cemetery the limits of which were marked by columnar cippi, of which fragments were also discovered. The tombs are constructed of blocks of tufa cemented with plaster and paved with tiles. The bodies were oriented with the feet towards the east. Some weapons and ornaments were found, among them gold earrings with filagree decorations. (E. GALLI, Boll. Arte, VI, 1912, pp. 345-353.) BOVILLE ERNICA (BAUTCO).- Fragments from Old St. Peter's.- A. MuToz, in a supplementary article to his discussion of the fragments of monuments of Old St. Peter's existing in this locality (cf. A.J.A. XVI, 1912, p. 147), points out that the statue of St. Andrew now in the Metro- politan Museum in New York once formned part of the altar erected in the basilica by Guglielino Perrier in 1491. The Madonna and two angels existing in the Simoncelli chapel at Bauco belonged originally to the tomb of Ardicino Della Porta (d. 1493) in St. Peter's. (Boll. Arte, VI, 1912, pp. 239-245.) CARPI. --The Frescoes of the Cappella Pio.--The history of the erection and spoliation of the Cappella Pio at Carpi forms the subject of an article by P. FORESTI in Boll. Arte, VI, 1912, pp. 303-322. He describes at length the frescoes of the chapel, which represent scenes from the life of Christ and the Virgin, shows that they are clearly the work of Loschi, the court painter of Prince Alberto Pio, the builder of the chapel, and reconstructs the biography and the oeure of this Parmesan painter. DOVERA.- A Langobardic Tomb. - A Langobardic tomb has been discovered at Dovera, with iron weapons and a round shield; also a Gallic tomb, with vases and small bronze and glass ornaments. (G.

FERRI publishes the series of niello proofs or imitations thereof existing in the R. Biblioteca Marucelliana at Florence. Newly Discovered Frescoes.- Frescoes of the fourteenth century have recently been discovered in the church of S. Agostino at Florence. One represents the Birth of the Virgin, another the Annunciation. (Rass. d'Arte, XII, 1912, Aug.-Sept., p. 1.) FOLIGNO. -- La Maest Bella. - In Gaz. B.-A. VIII, 1912, pp. 131-136, P. POUZET publishes a description and some good reproductions of the fresco in the wayside shrine at Foligno, which passes under the name of the "Maesti bella." It represents the Madonna between Saints John Baptist and the Evangelist. The author is Pier Antonio de Mezzastis, who was a pupil of Benozzo Gozzoli.

Antonio Abbate. (Rass. d'Arte, XII, 1912, July, p. I.) A Portrait of Borso d'Este.--A portrait in the Trivulzio collection, Milan, is identified as the likeness of the Duke of Ferrara by F. MALA- GUZZI VALERI (Rass. d'Arte, XII, 1912, pp. 101-103), by comparison with the portrait of the duke in the frescoes of the Palazzo Schifanoia at Ferrara, and the painter of the picture is, according to the writer, the court painter Baldassare da Reggio. The Identity of the Pseudo-Boccaoino Discovered. - In Rass. d'Arte, XII, 1912, pp. 99-100, F. MALAGUZZI VALERI publishes a small panel with the heads of two. apostles in the collection of Carlo Bazzero in Milan, which shows an evident relation with the works of the Pseudo- Boccacino, and is the original of the copy in Niirnberg published by Frizzoni (ibid. 1909). The panel, moreover, is signed: IOHES AVGVSTINVS LAVDESIS. P. (Iohannes Augustinus Laudensis pinxit). The painter, thus baptized into Giovanni Agostino of Lodi, shows an evident derivation from Bramante. Acquisition of the Poldi-Pezzoli. - The Poldi-Pezzoli gallery has recently placed in its Venetian room a beautiful Madonna by Cavazzola. The picture is described by G. FRIzzoNI in Rass. d'Arte, XII, 1912, pp. 117-122. The writer adds a brief account of the other paintings of this department of the gallery. NORCIA. - An Annunciation by Giovanni della Robbia. - Two glazed terra-cotta figures of the Virgin and an Angel, in the Church of the Annunziata, near Norcia, are assigned on internal evidence to Giovanni della Robbia, by F. MASON PERKINS in Rass. d'Arte, XII, 1912, pp. 78-79. RAVENNA.- A Porphyry Statue and a Head in Venice. - In Burl. 2Mag. XXII, 1912, pp. 147-153, Sir MARTIN CONWAY publishes a headless porphyry statue in the Archbishop's Museum at Ravenna, repre- senting some personage of the time of Constantine, which he believes to be an Eastern emperor. A head, also of porphyry, crowned with a gem- studded diadem, adorns the corner of a balustrade of St. Mark's at Venice, where it is commonly known by the epithet "Carmagnola's Head." The proportions seem to be those of the Ravenna torso, and it is quite possible that the fitting of a cast of the head to the shoulders of the statue would restore a valuable portrait statue of the later Empire. RIVIERA DI CASTELFIUMANESE.--A Madonna by Iacopo Bellini.--The painting of a Madonna by Jacopo Bellini in Riviera di Castelfiumanese (Fig. 7), in tempera on canvas applied to a panel, is signed with an inscription in hexameter verse which was only recently noticed. It reads: HAS DEDIT INGENVAS BELINVS MENTE FIGVRAS. The apse of the local church, in which the picture is now kept, has a fresco representing the Visitation, by the painter Pier Paolo Agabiti. (C. Ricci, Boll. Arte, VI, 1912, pp. 289-290.) ROME. - A Third-century Baptistery.- In demolishing a portion of the old Palazzo Costa, close to the Church of St. Marcellus, workmen have brought to light many fragments of inscriptions, among them one attributed to Pope St. Damasus. Considerably below the level of the city,</page><page sequence="43">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHIAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 13T walls were discovered which appear to date from the third century A.D., and perhaps belonged to a baptistery.

POLO DEI CAVALIERI.- A Mediaeval Madonna.- In the campanile of the local church at S. Polo dei Cavalieri was recently discovered a Madonna and Child carved in wood, which was afterward covered with canvas and painted, traces of the paint still remaining on the dress of the Child. The statue dates in the early thirteenth century and shows evidence of French derivation. (E. EGE, Boll. Arte, VI, 1912, pp. 342-344.) S. SEVERINA IN CALABRIA. - Unpublished Monuments. - In Boll. Arte, VI, 1912, pp. 181-198, 217-230, 263-284, P. ORSI publishes a mono- graph on the monuments of the little-known village of S. Severina in Calabria. After sketching the history of the place, which seems to begin with the eighth century, the writer describes the baptistery, an interesting and well- preserved rotonda of the eighth or ninth century, the old cathedral, which appears, in the light of a Byzantine inscription hitherto unknown, to have been dedicated by a certain bishop, Ambrosius, in the year 1036, the new cathedral, with its pulpit ornamented with a fifteenth-century relief repre- sentiing Christ among the Doctors, and minor edifices and works of sculpture. SARDINIA. - Artistic Monuments.- W. BIEHL contributes to Z. Bild. K. XXIV, 1912, pp. 17-24 and 26-32, a rather summary description of the monuments of Sardinia which are of interest to the student of art. The most important are: the churches of S. Nicola di Silanus, S. Giusta at Oris- tano, SS. Trinith di Saccargia near Codrougianus, S. Pietro di Immagini near Bulzi, and S. Pietro at Zuri; a relief of Daniel in the Den of Lions of the twelfth century from the cathedral of Oristano, the carved chancels of the cathedral of Cagliari, originally in Pisa, another chancel in the portico of S. Michele at Cagliari, a Pisan polyptych of the fourteenth century in the Cagliari museum, another in the choir of the church of S. Maria del Regno at Ardara (by Giovanni Muru, 1515), another in Castel Sardo, and a marble tabernacle in the church of S. Giusta at Oristano. SIENA.- The Mostra di Duccio.- An account of the exhibition of the works of Duccio and of his followers which was held recently in Siena is given by G. DE NICOLA in Burl. Mag. XXII, 1912, pp. 138-147, in the course of which the writer makes some interesting attributions. Of the works at the Exposition he gives but one new one to Duccio - a Madonna in the church of S. Maria at Montepulciano. Three works appeared in the collection which may be classified as of Duccio's school: a Madonna from Asciano, a " Mater Misericordiae" of the Pieve of Vertine, and the fine trip- tych representing the Madonna with Saints, the Coronation, Annunciation, and three scenes from the Life of Christ, which is in the Galleria di Siena. To Ugolino the writer ascribes a Madonna in the possession of the Conm- pagnia della Misericordia of S. Casciano, while assigning a number of paint- ings to his school. SPAIN DRAWINGS BY SPANISH ARCHITECTS. - The King of Spain has recently donated to the Pedagogical Bureau of the Museums and Libra- ries of Spain a set of drawings which disappeared at the time of the burn- ing of the old Alcazar of Madrid in 1734. The majority are plans for the</page><page sequence="45">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 139 Escurial, but two are of particular interest. They are the work of the architect of Charles V, Pedro Machuca, and furnish us with a detailed plan of the Alhambra at least two hundred and fifty years earlier than any other plan known. (H. SAINT-EDME, Chron. Arts, 1912, p. 171.) BARCELONA. - A Byzantine Statue.-- A fisherman of Barceloneta, near Barcelona, recently found in his net a magnificent marble statue of the Virgin, represented as protecting three children, of Byzantine workmanship. It is believed that the statue is one of those brought to Spain by the soldiers of I)on Juan of Austria after his expedition against the Turks. (Rass. d'Arte, XII, 1912, p. II, Aug.-Sept.) FRANCE TWO SIGNED PAINTINGS OF CORNEILLE DE LYON. -In Mon. Piot, XVIII, 1910, pp. 125-144 (2 pls.; 14 figs.), F. DE MILY publishes two paintings of which several replicas are known, one representing a Banker and his Wife, now in the collection of Prince Hohenzollern-Sigmaringen; and the other an Accountant in the collection of Baron Oppenheimn of Cologne. They have been attributed to Quentin Matsys and Marinus. The first bears the name Cornelis van der Capella, and the second Corneille de la Chapelle. This was the famous Corneille de Lyon, painter to Henri II, Frangois II, Charles IX, and Catherine de Medicis, of whom no painting was definitely known to exist. BOURBON-LANCY. - A MIerovingian Cemetery. - Recent excava- tions at Bourbon-Lancy (Sa6ne-et-Loire) have brought to light sixteen sarcophagi of the Merovingian epoch, of which two only were intact and contained skeletons. A number of gold and silver ornaments were found, together with some coins, among them a fine piece of Faustina Augusta. (Chron. Arts, 1912, pp. 214-215.) PARIS.- Newr Acquisitions of the Louvre.--A. MICHEL continues his discussion of the sculptures recently added to the collections of the Louvre in Gaz. B.-A. VIII, 1912, pp. 17-34 and 295-318 (see A.J.A. XVI, 1912, p. 457). The most important pieces mentioned are: a polychrome stone Virgin of the Annunciation from the south of France, of the fifteenth centulry; a stone bas-relief representing the Combat of St. George and the Dragon, Nivernais of the fifteenth century; a polychrome stone Virgin and Child, from the east of France, ca. 1550; another marble Madonna of the same period from St. Florentin; a medallion in marbIe representing Charles IX or Henri III, from the atelier of Germain Pilon; and a series of portrait and other statues of the modern epoch. A Virgin and Child of the Fourteenth Century. -In Mon. Plot, XVIII, 1910, pp. 117-124 (2 pls.; 3 figs.), A. MICHEL publishes a seated figure of the Virgin and Child recently acquired by the Louvre. The Virgin is crowned, and with her left hand supports the Child, who, attired in a long dress, is standing on her knee. With his right hand he caresses his mother's chin, and with his left takes a bird which she offers him. The group is said to have come from the vicinity of Joigny. He also publishes a standing Virgin and Child, acquired by the Louvre in 1905, which retains some of its original color. Both are charming pieces of French sculpture of the early part of the fourteenth century.</page><page sequence="46">140 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VOL. XVII, 1913 SAINT-ARMAND. - A Portrait of Charles d'Amboise.- There was recently discovered in an out of the way corner of the Mairie of Saint- Armand (Cher) a portrait on wood of a personage who seems to be identical with the Charles d'Amboise, governor of Milan under Louis XII, whose portrait by Andrea Solario hangs in the Louvre. The new portrait is signed: Bernardinus de Comite, pinxit, 1500, 18 aug. This Lombard painter was born at Pavia, and his career can be traced from 1499 to 1522. A portrait of a Cardinal by him is in the Berlin gallery. (Chron. Arts, 1912, pp. 214 and 246.) BELGIUM BRUSSELS. - Acquisitions of the Museum. - The Brussels gallery has recently acquired: a Temptation of St. Anthony, by Lucas of Leyden; an Apollo and Diana, by Cranach the Elder; an Adoration of the Magi, by Peter Brueghel thle Elder; an Annunciation, by the Maitre de Flmalle; and other later paintings of minor importance. (P. BAUTIER, Rass. d'Arte, XII, 1912, pp. 107-111.) GERMANY BERLIN.- A New Rembrandt Drawing. - L. BURCHARD publishes in Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXIII, 1912, pp. 173-175, a drawing recently acquired by the Berlin museum, which is a study for the famous Rembrandt Susanna and the Elders, in the Berlin gallery. A Picture by Goosen van der Weyden.- In Burl. Mag. XXII, 1912, pp. 26-32, G. H. DE Loo gives a r6sum6 of his researches on the subject of Goosen van der Weyden, grandson of Roger, which will be published later in extenso in Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. He has succeeded in identifying one picture by this artist, a Madonna with Donors in the Kaiser Friedrich Museum. It was painted between 1511 and 1515 to commemo- rate the donation of the estate of Calmpthout to the abbey of Tongerloo. Affinity in style between this picture and the great altarpiece representing the legend of St. Dymphna, recently in this abbey, convince the writer that the latter work is also by the artist. This work, painted in 1505, is the first work of certain date produced in Antwerp in the sixteenth century, and, therefore, of prime importance for the history of the Antwerp school. A New Donatello. - In Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXIII, 1912, pp. 225-228, W. BODE suggests that the Madonna and Child, a statue of three-quarters life size, acquired by the Kaiser Friedrich Museum in Florence in 1893, is a youthful work by Donatello. For comparison he cites two of the prophets on the Duomo, and the David in the Bargello. Papal Busts by Bastiano Torrigiani.--In Jb. Preuss. Kunsts. XXXIII, 1912, pp. 252-274, G. SOBOTKA solves the riddle of the authorship of the well-known bust of Gregory XIII in the Berlin museum, by establishing its community of origin with a bust of Sixtus V in the Royal Palace. This in turn is clearly by the same hand as another portrait bust of the same Pope in the cathedral of Treja Macerata, whose authentic history may be traced back to the hand of Bastiano Torrigiani. Acquisitions of the Kaiser Friedrich Museum.--The Kaiser Fried- rich Museum has recently added to its collection: an early seventeenth- century copy of a Crucifixion by Griinewald (Ber. Kunsts. XXXIII, 1912,</page><page sequence="47">CHRISTIAN ART] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1912 141 cols. 137-142); a number of Italian plaquettes, among them a Doubting of Thomas by Valerio Belli; a Christ statuette in bronze by Andrea Pisano (?) (ibid. cols. 239-244); fragments of early mediaeval Italian decorative sculpture; a twelfth-century relief from Italy, representing a Pope; a fourteenth-century Cosmatesque reclining Madonna and Child in marble; a late fourteenth-century double capital in marble, Italian Gothic, with scenes from the life of Mary (ibid. cols. 261-279); a Burgundian triptych, ca. 1400, representing the Trinity and the Four Evangelists; a diptych from the Weber collection, the Martyrdom of St. Sebastian, German, ca. 1490; a-d a series of gifts to the museum by friends of Dr. Bode on the fortieth anniversary of his appointment to the museum staff, viz. a polychrome Madonna in stucco, Sienese of the second half of the fifteenth century, an early six- teenth-century bronze statuette of David, a Wedding Procession by Magnasco, a male portrait by a pupil of Diirer, a Trophies of the Chase by Albert Cuyp, an Abraham and Hagar by Nicolaes Maes, a relief of the Madonna, terra-cotta, by Niccolo dell' Arca, a fifteenth-century terra-cotta statuette of the Madonna of the Sienese school, three painted stucco replicas of German bronze reliefs of the fifteenth century, a bronze statuette of the Madonna, probably by Ercole Ferrata, etc. (ibid. cols. 285-312). BURG LICHTENBERG. - Repairs to the Castle. - The ruins of the very extensive castle of Lichtenberg, near St. Wendel, some distance southeast of Trier, have recently been carefully strengthened and secured against further decay. (v. BEHR, Bonn. Jb. 1911, pp. 9-28 of the Bericht; 3 pls.; 19 figs.) LEIPZIG. - A Drawing by the Hausbuchmeister. -In the Kunst- gewerbemrnuseum at Berlin is a series of four painted glass panes, each displaying a coat of arms surrounded by four lunettes adorned with little scenes. The cartoon for one of these is in the collection of F. Becker in Leipzig, and shows clearly the style of the Hausbuchmeister. The drawing, some details of which have been changed in the glass, dates from about 1485. (F. BECKER, Z. Bild. K. XXIII, 1912, pp. 219-222.) M1UNICH.--A New Velasquez.- The picture now in the possession of Julius Bbhler in Munich, which bears the title "Young Woman of Madrid," was originally in a private collection in Milan, and assigned to an "unknown master." A. L. MAYER, in Z. Bild. K. XXIV, 1912, p. 41, assigns it on internal evidence to Velasquez. AUSTRIA-HUNGARY VIENNA. - Identification of a Portrait in the Imperial Gal- lery.-A portrait of a Niirnberg patrician, dated 1520 and signed with the monogram HB, is identified by E. REICKE, Jb. Kunsth. Samrnm. 1912, pp. 228-255, as the likeness of Hans Pirkel, the painter being Brosamer. A replica of the picture in the library of Niirnberg, signed with the Diirer monogram, is a forgery of about 1600. RUSSIA PULTAVA. - Byzantine Treasure.- At Molaja Bereshtshabina, a village of the district of Pultava, Russia, some children discovered in the summer of 1912 a great treasure of gold and silver. The gold objects alone</page><page sequence="48">142 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 weigh over 50 kilograms, and number over 400. A silver plate with Sassanide decoration belongs to the fourth century, a necklace of gold pieces to the seventh. The treasure was probably plundered from the sack of some Greek city. (S. R., R. Arch. XX, 1912, p. 297, after the Neue Freie Presse, Sep- tember 13, 1912.) GREAT BRITAIN TWO FLORENTINE CASSONE-FRONTS.- These panels are now in the possession of Sir Hugh Lane. They were evidently painted by the same master, and represent respectively the Battle of Anghiari and the Taking of Pisa by the Florentines. Details of the latter picture show that the panels were done toward the middle of the fifteenth century. P. SCHU- BRING, who describes them in Burl. Mag. XXII, 1912, pp. 158-165, does not attempt to define very closely their artistic position, contenting himself with pointing out analogies to the work of Ucello Baldovinetti, Lorenzo Monaco, and the Sienese school. A PICTURE BY SASSETTA.--In Burl. Mag. XXII, 1912, p. 131, R. FiY publishes a very interesting panel in the collection of the Marchioness of Crewe, representing the "Journey of the Three Kings." The picture has been ascribed traditionally to Ucello, but in the opinion of the writer is better given to the Sienese. LONDON. - Italian Sculpture at the Burlington Club.--A brief account of the Spring Exhibition of Italian Sculpture at the Burlington Fine Arts Club appears in the Burl. Mag. XXI, 1912, pp. 278-284, con- tributed by A. M. DANIEL. The chief works noted are: a stucco replica from Birmingham of Donatello's relief of the Crucifixion in the Bargello; a marble relief of the Virgin and Child with Angels, perhaps an early work of Agostino di Duccio ; a terra-cotta relief of the Madonna with Six Angels in the Morgan collection, ascribed to Luca della Robbia; a stucco Madonna in the collection of Mr. Diblee; two bronze putti of the school of Donatello; and a Nude Slave in terra-cotta, in the collection of Mr. Oppenheimer, evidently done under the influence of Michelangelo. Further notes on the exhibition are given by P. SCHUBRING, Z. Bild. K. XXIII, 1912, pp. 301- 308. REPTON. - Remains of a Norman Building. - In A then. August 17, 1912, p. 170, J. C. Cox reports the partial excavation of a building of Norman date at Repton. Potsherds were found to prove the Roman occu- pation of the site. AFRICA CARTHAGE. - Excavations at Damous-el-Karita. - In C. R. Acad. Insc. 1912, pp. 460-476 (12 figs.), Father DELATTRE reports upon the recent excavations at the basilica of Damous-el-Karita, Carthage. In the wall facing the road which runs through the ruins was a series of chapels, of which two were opened. They contained sarcophagi with women's remains. A large vaulted tomb approached by a stairway had the floor divided into seven compartments. A circular structure, 9.15 mi. in diameter, was cleared. It had, surrounding it, columns, sixteen in all, alternating with niches, and a floor of mosaic with large slabs about it. There were corridors on opposite sides connecting with it by stairways of nine steps. This rotunda was,</page><page sequence="49">AMERICAN ARCH.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 1919 143 perhaps, originally a baptistery. A number of inscriptions, one in mosaic, were discovered. DRA-BEN-JOUDER. - An Epitaph. - In B. Soc. Ant. Fr. 1912, pp. 237-239, P. MONCEAUX publishes .a fragmentary epitaph recently found at Dra-Ben-Jouder, Tunis, beginning, Gloria in [ex]selsis (sic) deo. The beginning of the song of the angels has often been found on architectural fragments, but not before on a tombstone. UNITED STATES BOSTON. - Acquisitions of the Museum of Fine Arts. - The Mu- seum of Fine Arts has recently acquired: a collection of Russian crucifixes and icons; a Portrait of a Lady by Maes (B. MIus. F. A. X, 1912, pp. 21- 23; a triptych of 1511 by the Master of St. Severin, of the Cologne school (ibid. pp. 25-27); and a Portrait of a Lady by Lucas Cranach the Elder (ibid. p. 10). NEW YORK. - Acquisitions of the Metropolitan Museum. - Recent acquisitions of the Metropolitan Museum include: a Pieth by Moretto da Brescia (B. Metr. Mus. VII, 1912, pp. 112-113); a polyptych, ca. 1500, of the Bruges school representing scenes from the life of St. GodeliBve; a relief by Donatello representing the Madonna and Child (ibid. pp. 126-130); a Portrait of a Man by Conrad von Creuznach; a German Altar-shrine with painted doors, ca. 1500 (ibid. p. 136); a painting by Ribera, "Lucretia"; a Millefleurs tapestry of the latter half of the fifteenth century; two stone reliefs of adoring angels, Florentine of the second half of the fifteenth cen- tury (ibid. pp. 150-152); and a marble niche and statue of St. Andrew, at- tributed to Andrea Bregno (ibid. pp. 165-167). The last-mentioned work once formed part of the altar erected in Old St. Peter's in 1491 by Guglielmo Perrier (cf. A. MuRoz, Boll. Arte, VI, 1912, pp. 239 ft.). Further acces- sions are: a series of stained glass panels of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries (ibid. pp. 212-214); an early sixteenth-century Descent from the Cross (ibid. p. 216); and two wooden statues of the Virgin and St. John, Italian (?) late thirteenth century (ibid. pp. 230-231). Byzantine Enamels in J. P. Morgan's Collection.-- O. M. DALTON continues his account of the Byzantine enamels in Mr. Morgan's collection in Burl. Mag. XXI, 1912, pp. 219-224 (see A.J.A. XVI, 1912, p. 460). This last article is concerned with the description of the two triptychs, probably of the twelfth century, which are mounted in the great triptych made by Godefroid de St. Claire, or one of his school, for the Abbey of Stavelot. The larger triptych is a reliquary of the True Cross. The inner panel contains the cavity for the relic, busts of the archangels Gabriel and Michael above the arms of the cross, and figures of Constantine and Helena below. The wings are ornamented with figures and busts of Saints. The smaller triptych displays a Crucifixion, and an Annunciation on the wings. AMERICAN ARCHAEOLOGY GENERAL AND MISCELLANEOUS COLORADO. - Ruins at Pesedeuinge. - In Rec. Past, XT, 1912, pp. 28-37 (10 figs.), J. A. JEANCON gives the results of explorations, in 1911, at.</page><page sequence="50">144 AMERICAN JOURNAL OF ARCHAEOLOGY [VoL. XVII, 1913 the Pajaritan settlement of Pesedeuinge on the south bank of the Rio Oso, where eight barrels of pottery, implements of bone and stone, etc., were found. LOWER CALIFORNIA. - New Petroglyphs. - In Rev. Anthrop. XXII, 1912, pp. 200-211 (16 figs.), J. ENGERRAND describes and figures new petroglyphs discovered by him in 1911 at San Fernando, La Sierrita, San Julio, etc., in Lower California. These petroglyphs are in white, red, red and yellow, and brown-red; and the figures occurring are human and animal (very much conventionalized), circles, linear and other geometrical forms. According to the writer, only the Sierrita paintings have real analogies with those of American California. The same data are published in Spanish in the author's article in Bol. Mus. Nac. (Mexico), I, 1912, pp. 197-201 (13 figs.). Other petroglyphs from Lower California were described by A. W. North in the Am. Anthr. 1908. NEW MEXICO. - Ruins of Tyuonyi. - In Journal de la Socie'te des Ame'ricanistes de Paris, N.S. IX, 1912, pp. 111-115 (3 pls.; fig.), H. ALLIOT describes briefly the explorations of the American School of Archaeology during 1911 in the ancient Tewa pueblo of Tyuonyi, New Mexico. Cave- dwellings, a large kiva, etc., were investigated. MEXICO. - Discovery of an Important Manuscript. - In Amer. Anthr. N.S. XIV, 1912, pp. 582-583, mention is made of the discovery by Mrs. ZELIA NUTTALL, in the department of manuscripts of the National Library at Madrid of Francisco Cervantes de Salasar's Cr'nica de la Nueva Espaiia (a manuscript of 885 closely written pages, - it has been freely censored with fortunately no destruction of the text). The many harangues or rhetori- cal speeches, which it records as having been delivered by Montezuma, Cuahtemoc, and the cacique of Tlaxcalla, Texcoeo, etc., are a noteworthy feature of it. The manuscript is anonymous, but Mrs. Nuttall has identi- fied the author beyond question. De Salazar began to write his Cro'nica in 1559. PERUT. - Prehistoric Human Remains near Cuzco.- In Amer. J. Sci. 4th S., XXXIII, 1912, pp. 297-305 (2 pls.; 7 figs.), H. BINGHAM writes of the discovery of prehistoric human remains (fragment of a cranium, long bones, etc.), with bones of animals (dog or wolf, bos, llama), under from 75 to 100 feet of gravel in a gulch near Cuzco, representing, presumably, remote pre-Inca man; also a "pre-Inca" stone wall. Ibid. pp. 306-325 (6 figs.), ISAIAH BOWMAN discusses the geologic relations of the Cuzco remains, reaching the conclusion that "a conservative statement is that the bones appear to be from 20,000 to 40,000 years old, that they have been buried from three to six times longer than the historical period." The bison (?) bone found with the human bones must be, however, more exactly identified before certainty can be reached. Ibid. pp. 325-333 (2 figs.), G. F. EATON makes a report on the human bones and those of the lower animals, concluding that the human bones per se furnish no evidence of any great antiquity,-" agreeing, as they do, in all essential respects, with the bones of a recent people." The Canis tibia closely resembles that of C. occidentalis; the llama bone may belong to L. guanacus, the wild ancestor of the llama and the alpaca; the fragmentary bovine rib seems to be that of a bison, but pre-Hispanic bisons have not yet been reported from South America. Ibid. XXXIV, 1912, pp. 497-509 (6 figs.), I. BOWMAN concludes that the buried wall at Cuzco "not only is pre-Inca; but the possibility exists that it</page><page sequence="51">AMERICAN ARCH.] ARCHAEOLOGICAL NEWS, 191? 145 may antedate the period in which ruled the legendary pre-Inca kings." Moreover, it represents "the earliest type of architecture at present known in the Cuzco basin." The geological data are treated with some detail. Pre-Columbian Remains.--In Arch. Miss. N.S. 4, 1911, pp. 53-126 (24 pls., of which 8 are in colors; 20 figs.), P. BERTHON reports upon his explorations in the vicinity of Lima, Peru, covering a period of more than five years. The burials, mummies, funeral furniture, relative dates of the burials, and orientation of tombs are examined, as well as the motifs found on the pottery, its religious character, the antiquity of Nazca, etc. The writer divides the pre-Columbian epoch into six periods. He describes his excavations at Ancon, Chorrillos, Pachacamac, the Plain of Lima, etc., and concludes with a discussion of the manufacture of the pottery and the orna- mentation of the huacos of Nazca.</page><page sequence="52">ABBREVIATIONS Abh.: Abhandlungen.
