<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Sun-disc in Akhenaten's Program: Its Worship and Antecedents, I Donald B. Redford It is easier to describe the cult of the Disc which Akhenaten introduced in terms of what it is not, rather than what it is. Akhenaten, in a word, consigned to the rubbish heap far more than he creat- ed. No mythology surrounds his god; apart from a brief period at the beginning of his reign, no anthropomorphic depiction is permitted. The rich potential of mythological symbolism in art, cult, and magic can no longer be realized, as it is everywhere interdicted.1 Thus, the ever-growing and creative thought of an intelligent polytheism is repressed. The subtle and profound syncretism of Egyptian religion which produced the Memphite Theology is viewed with suspicion and hostility: Akhenaten's god does not absorb; he excludes and annihilates! No truth can come from anyone but the king; no teaching but his is to be accepted. The multifarious and mysterious world of the Beyond, so central to Egyptian religious lore, is swept away at a stroke. There is no further need for the age- old traditions of the mortuary cult, for the welfare of the deceased depends only on hearkening to the king's teaching. The complexity of the cultus, depending as it does on actualized myth and its symbols, becomes a thing of the past. No cultic acts beyond the simple offering are permitted. Gone are the elaborate temples where such cultic acts were carried on. Gone, too, are the cult images, the focal points of those cults. The multiplicity of divine names and the concept of divine forms as a sequence of voluntary or necessary modes of existence are both foreign to Akhenaten: the only designation of the deity that is tolerated is the time-honored solar one, which has, however, been reduced to the status of a mere epithet. One may well ask, what is left? What was Akhenaten trying to do? The answer from his own lips may well have been: to teach men the truth. But what was Akhenaten's truth? He would have poured scorn on the commonly-held notion that he wished only to reveal a god who was loving, beneficent and universal. Amun-re had been all of that, and he was in the process of being purged! The Sun Disc in Egyptian Religion Before Akhenaten While for the reign of Akhenaten the word itn is often left untranslated, as though it had achieved the status of a personal name,2 the morpheme itself was originally a common noun, meaning "circle/1 "disc/1 and soon came to mean "solar disc."3 Since it was also used of those circular objects made in imitation of the sun and set upon the heads of deities,4 it became necessary to specify the celestial object as itn n hrw, "sun disc of the day"; and this in fact is the definition given to the common hieroglyphic sign for sun-disc in the Hieroglyphic Papyrus.6 The oldest example of itn known to the author is in an inventory text among the Abusir Papyri.6 It is listed as one of five parts of a wh-emblem (along with such others as id, "stand," dst "body," i'wty, "two uraei," etc.), inspected in the mortuary temple of Neferirkare in the twenty-first or twenty-second year of either Unas or Isesi. 47</page><page sequence="2">48 JARCE XIII (1976) The earliest well-defined group of texts in which the word occurs is the Coffin Texts (CT).6a Here, although examples are fairly rare, the uses of the term fall into clear categories : (a) the disc as a vehicle or manifestation in which a god or person can reside, and which can be "opened" to that person; (b) the tangible disc ornament which is used as a headdress; (c) the Disc as an individualized 'Tower/' a hierophany in its own right. The first use involves phrases in which a god is said to be "in" or "in the midst of" his disc.7 Thus, in CT I, 226 f., some unruly denizens of the world of the gods are made to say: "hail to thee, 0 thou who art in the (var. his) disc, who rulest over the gods;"8 and in CT I, 230: "he has instructed me in the midst of the disc!"9 The sun god is addressed as "0 Re who is in his egg, who shinest in his disc !"10 The parallelism between the disc and the egg is of some interest, as it might suggest a connec- tion between the Disc and the pre-existent substance from which Re emerges.11 The metaphor, however, is probably devoid of real significance, as the Disc is also found in parallelism with the sun-boat: "I have made my way at the prow of his barque, I shine in his Disc."12 The devotee himself, as this last example makes clear, can sit in the Disc as though it were literally a vehicle: indeed he can have "plenty of room in the midst of the Disc,"13 and avers "my place is in the Disc, my place is in the Disc! Indeed how firm is my place in the Disc!"14 If the Disc, like the sun-boat, is a conveyance, the concept of opening it to passengers is not remote; and thus one finds the occa- sional reference to "that Power of heaven that opens the Disc."15 In all these examples, the Disc is treated as an inanimate, but potent, symbol or agent, in which or through which a divine power works. The latter is usually, and understandably, the sun-god.16 Pursuant thereto texts speak of "Re who is in his Disc,"17 "the lord of the Disc,"18 and "Re and his Disc."19 But in all cases, Re is never confused with his Disc; the two are separate entities. The ele- ment of concreteness that seems inherent in the concept of the tin was perpetuated by the second use referred to above, as the term for the disc-headdress, equipped with horns, and worn by Hathor.20 But, as in the case of other potent symbols, the sun-disc already in the CT shows signs of the ability to graduate to the status of individualized deity. One might formulate a rule that, in Egyptian religion, deities are distinct from merely potent hierophanies by the complete subordination of the latter to the former as non-personalized agents through whom the gods work. As soon as the Egyp- tian feels that the potency with which a religious object is imbued emanates from the object itself, and not a god behind the scenes, he treats it as a "Power," and automatically thinks of it as having the attributes of a person. A cult object is "personalized" to the extent that it is deemed to exercise its own will. While the word itn is sometimes followed by the seated god in the CT, which might be taken as indicating a tendency towards personification, rarely is it addressed as a person. Spell 463, designed to "present a man to the council," is addressed to "the great Disc which is in its moment, who guides Re through difficult paths."21 Again, the distinction between the sun-god and his visible disc is plain, even though the latter seems here to be treated as a separate god. A few passages in the CT associate the word tin with the word for "sunshine," //to, a connection which is certainly to be expected. A passage referring to "that great Power of heaven that opens the Disc" is followed by a reference to "Re, the lord of ruddiness (or wrath?), who opens //to."22 Else- where, the uraeus is alluded to in the locution "mistress of fire, the great one who is on the brow of the disc of //to";23 and in a passage in which the "opening out [wh) of the Disc" is mentioned, the speaker identifies with the cognate term ihhw, the sunlight of dusk.24 The authors of the CT were fascinated, if a little mystified, by the idea of sunlight, or beams of light,25 which they or their ancestors had abstracted from experience. There was a "Power within the sunlight (//to),"26 and a "light as (that of?) faience at the front of the //to,"27 both to be identified with. Re was the "lord of //to," as he was the lord of the Disc, and with him, too, identification could be sought.28 Sunbeams were closely allied with fiery heat,29 which, however, would not harm the deceased because of his</page><page sequence="3">THE SUN-DISC IN AKHENATEN'S PROGRAM 49 identity with Sfg-irw within the i?hw;zo and they were so all-pervasive that the initiate could hope to take possession of the sky by means of them.31 Some of the most curious passages, understandable if the metaphor is to be extended, are those which presuppose the concreteness of the ishw. Thus, iihw may be traversed, just as heaven can be crossed;32 like the light (sw), the sunbeams may be climbed.33 They may also be trod upon, or their footsteps followed,34 or the stairs of the iihw sat upon.35 In the light of the fact that the only two concrete images Akhenaten was to allow his new cult were the Disc and its ubiquitous sunbeams, this early fixation with itn and iskw as concrete objects in the CT is of some interest. The Weltanschauung of the CT is not concerned with putting Egypt as a state in a cosmic con- text; but, beginning in the Middle Kingdom, the word itn comes to be used in two stereotyped phrases which betoken a universalism which dominates Egyptian imperial thinking. First, the sun-disc is referred to in a phrase denoting the universal dominion of the king: "to him (Senwosret I) belongs that which the sun-disc encircles daily, to him is brought 'the Eye' in the form of that which is in her, the Mistress of Being, in the form of what she creates."36 To the same king, Sinuhe says: "thou hast subdued what the sun-disc encircles/'37 The term "ruler (hki) of that which the sun-disc encircles" has, by the Eighteenth Dynasty, become firmly established as indicating Pha- raoh's worldwide dominion.38 The choice of the sun as a symbol betokening the aegis under which the universal dominion is enjoyed leads naturally into the concept of the physical disc of the sun being the king's progenitor. And hence, the second stereotyped phrase which first appears in the Middle Kingdom to denote, in high-flown style, the passing of the monarch: "the god (i.e., he king) ascended to his horizon . . . uniting with the sun-disc, the divine limbs coalescing with him that begat him."39 Since, to prolong the metaphor logically, this world-king emanated from the world-symbol, he must be like the thing that produced him. The scintillating splendor of the king in all his glory is likened to the shining of the Disc. Thus, of Amenemhet III, the poet says: "He is Re by whose beams people see, he is the one that brightens the Two Lands more than the sun-disc."40 Ahmose is "glimpsed like Re when he rises, as when the sun-disc shines, as when Khepry appears to view."41 Similarly, the chiefs of Pwenet address Hatshepsut as follows: "Hail to thee, thou king of Egypt, Racet who shinest like the sun-disc, our mistress!"42 And Amenophis III is one who "illumines the Two Lands like him-of-the-horizon, lord of visible sunrays, like the Disc."43 And, as the Disc is permanent and his lifetime without end, so will the king enjoy an unending existence. "To thee belongs the kingship of Re in heaven, thy lifetime being as that of the sun-disc in it."44 Naturally, the Disc will look down with favor and will shine upon the monuments the world-king has erected;45 and those monuments will themselves "provide illumination for the Two Lands like the sun-disc."46 The universal symbol of the monarch's world -rule was also the sign under which that rule was won in battle. It is not surprising that the Disc should sometimes be spoken of in contexts of a military or bellicose nature; for already in the CT, the Disc is associated with that savage, feline deity of the Sekhmet or Hathor type. The uraeus, for example, is spoken of as "the mistress of fire, the great one, who is on the brow of the Disc . . . ;"47 a feminine nisbe, derived from itn, is in existence as early as the CT as an epithet of the same goddess: "the disced one of Re, his uraeus - lo! she is on his brow!"48 As the Eye of Re, the fierce uraeus goddess is associated with the Disc, or actually identified with it. "The Eye of Re which is upon his Disc" is found in a Ramesside text,49 and, in the Sphinx Stela of Amenophis II, "what his Eye encircles" is paralleled by "what the sun-disc of the day illumines."50 Since "the uraeus which is in front of him (the king) quells the rebellious-hearted,"51 and, since "it is the fiery one that overthrows his enemies,"52 the image of the disc in battle is not far removed. The king is "like the Disc, a Horus beloved of his army,"53 "with a sharp spear like Anhur, shining brightly in the eyes like the Disc,"54 and "a runner like the Disc when he moves, a</page><page sequence="4">50 JARCE XIII (1976) star of electrum when he shines in a chariot . . . !"55 From here it is but a step to complete identifica- tion. Although the image of the king as the sun-disc never achieved wide currency, it clearly arose out of the related themes of conquest and universal dominion. The king is "the sun-disc of all lands,"56 he is Re under whose guidance people live ... he illumines (the earth) more than the sun- disc ;"57 he is "a dazzling sun-disc at the head of his army, their hearts being confident in the great- ness of his strength/'58 The sun-disc as a symbol closely related to the empire is part of the broader connection between the sun-god and the monarch, which obtained under the Eighteenth Dynasty. Whether the uni- versalist outlook forced on the Egyptians by the Hyksos domination produced a heightened awa- reness of the role the sun might play in Egypt's dominion of the world is difficult to say. Never- theless under the Eighteenth Dynasty, kingship and its bestowal are more intimately connected with Re than ever before.59 And a concomitant of this royal alliance is the published desire of private individuals to see the sun-disc throughout all eternity, a wish the Eighteenth Dynasty tomb owners express so frequently on the outermost parts of their tombs.60 During the Eighteenth Dynasty, the growing popularity of the sun cult is attested by the appear- ance of the hymn to the sun, a popular, literary-cultic genre, expressive of personal piety.61 The locus classicus of the text is on the two sides of the entrance to the typical Theban tomb of the period, where the deceased is depicted, facing east, in the act of greeting the rising sun.62 By the reign of Tuthmosis III, demand for fuller texts had led, not only to the inclusion of additional hymnic literature in the tomb, but also to the development of a squatting statue holding a stela with a paean to Re, placed probably on the superstructure of the tomb.63 While a new universalist strain is discernible in some of this literature, the vast majority of the imagery is more familiar. The recurrent themes include the light-bearing attributes of the god; his divine associates and his supremacy over them; his defeat of Apophis; and his daily journey in the sun-boat. "The adoration of Re when he rises on the eastern horizon of heaven by N. He says : "Hail to thee, Reharakhty, who art Khepry, coming into being of thyself ! How beautiful is thy rising upon the horizon, when thou brightenest the Two Lands with thy rays ! The gods exult when they behold thee as king of heaven, risen as Harakhty-Atum whose body is unknown . . . . "64 And again: "Hail to thee, Re, at thy rising, Atum at thy beautiful setting ! Thou risest and shinest upon the back of thy mother, arisen as king of the Ennead. Nut does obeisance before thee, and Ma'at embraces thee at all times. Thou crossest heaven with happy heart, and the Sea of Knives is tranquil, the rebel is fallen, his arms are tied, and knives sever his vertebrae. Re is in the day-barque: the night- barque has doomed him who attacked it. The southerners, northerners, westerners, and eastern- ers tow thee in adoration of thee, O thou primeval one, coming into being of thyself! Sovereign, lord of what thou hast created, who emerged from Nun worked (hkw) in forms, who casts forth his voice and the earth falls silent ! O sole one, who came into being between heaven and earth, when earth and underworld existed not. . . !"65 During the early Eighteenth Dynasty, prior to Akhenaten, one can occasionally detect a tendency to think of the sun-god Re (or Amun-re) in terms of his visible disc, and to predicate of the latter the creative and sustaining powers elsewhere assigned to Atum, Khepry, and others. The Disc with whom Hatshepsut identifies66 is described as "one who created all Being, who shaped the earth, who completed its creation/' acts habitually attributed to a named sun-god; the Disc whom Suty and Hor hail is "one who created everyone and made their life."67 The sun-god who reveals himself to mankind's gaze at dawn and brightens heaven every day is the sun-disc as manifestation or birth-form of Re, Atum, or Amun-re, now a Power in his own right. "Thou art come as the Disc, the Power of heaven" says a hymn in Kheruef's tomb;68 and "thou (the sun-god) hast filled the Two Lands with thy beauty, like heaven shot through with dazzling light(?), inasmuch as thou art born</page><page sequence="5">THE SUN-DISC IN AKHENATEN'S PROGRAM 51 as the Disc in heaven/'69 The Disc is also the avatar of Amun: the latter is "the godly god, whose being came to be of itself . . . who made everything that is, emerging from Nun and rising as the sun-disc."70 The common motif of the anthropomorphic sun-god riding in his daj'-barque can now be adjusted to accommodate a Disc born in the same conveyance.71 One senses that the old solar symbol and vehicle, the Disc, is in process of graduating to the status of an independent Power, a god of the same rank as other solar deities; and it is, therefore, not surprising to find an address to "thou Disc full of sunlight, who shinest every day/' among similar invocations to Ptah, Amun, Wennefer, Hapy, and Nepry.72 With Tuthmosis IV73 and Amenophis III, the link between the sun-disc and the king is made even more explicit. If the historical scarab of the former king is genuine,74 its content underscores in a striking way the instrumentality of the Disc in winning the battle, and puts the empire thus won at the service of the Disc alone. But even without the evidence of this doubtful piece, Tuthmosis IV stands out as a monarch identified with the Disc and other solar imagery. One of his courtiers unequivocally refers to him as the sun-disc: Tjaneny calls himself "a trusted one of the Good God, who enters before the lord &lt;in&gt; holiness in the palace, who glimpses the Disc [in] his [horijzon [from] moment to moment/'76 A graphic illustration is vouchsafed us in an ivory armlet from a statue of Tuthmosis IV which shows the king, in a tightly-curled bag wig with a large and prominent sun-disc on top, smiting an Asiatic before Montu.76 The same king's gratitude to the solar deity is made plain by the Sphinx Stela and his attachment to various sun gods indicated by continued use of current epithets such as "chosen of Re," "image of Re," "one who rises over every foreign country," "one who rises over Thebes,"77 "propitiating Re in the morning-barque, adoring Atum in the evening-barque."78 Once in a series of statues depicted on a block from the third pylon at Karaak, Tuthmosis IV is even shown with falcon wings and tail surmounted by his human head wearing the double crown!79 The closest approach to permanent popularity of the image of the king as disc was made under Amenophis III. During his reign was coined the name Nb-tn?H-rc 'Itn thn, which was applied variously to the palace atMalkata,80 to the royal barge,81 and to a company in the army.82 Quite literally, the term can only be rendered "Nebmare is the Dazzling Sun-disc," not "Nebmare is the dazzlingness of the At en," as has occasionally been suggested.83 The evidence in favor of the former rendering is as follows: (1) The phrase is written with 'Itn before thn, and the prima facie probability is that it is to be read in the same order. To reverse the order would presuppose honorific transposition, and this is not attested with the common noun itn. (2) the rebus used in some sealings from Malkata is a graphic rendering of the identity of the king and Disc that the name conveys. If itn is in honorific transposition in the name, it would be separated in speech from Nb-tn;H-rc by the intervening thn, and the collocation of signs evidenced in the rebus would not have suggested itself. (3) As we have seen, the trend in the Eighteenth Dynasty up to this reign has been to identify the monarch with the Disc itself, not with one of its attributes. (4) The expression Nb-msH-r* 'Itn thn hc fast nbt conjures up an image best suited to the translation "Nebmare, the dazzling Sun-disc, arises (over) every land." It is not "dazzlingness" that arises, but the sun itself. (5) In Ramesside times, the phrase 'Itn thn was certainly read in the same order in which it was written, and was a direct reference to the Disc. In the Karnak stela of his first year, Sety I is called "a dazzling sun-disc over his army, their hearts are confident in the greatness of his might."84 And Ramesses II is "the Moon of Egypt, the dazzling Sun-disc of the commons, by whose rays they see."85 Although it is true that Reharakhty and other solar deities enjoy a new prominence in the mor- tuary and offering cult during Amenophis Ill's reign,86 there is no evidence that this king built any temple or established a cult for Reharakhty under the guise of the Disc. Maspero long ago stated,87 with an assurance that was a little puzzling, that Amenophis III had constructed a temple</page><page sequence="6">52 JARCE XIII (1976) to the Disc at Memphis.88 and another in his 10th year at Karnak, south of the Eighth pylon. But in his accompanying note,89 where one would have expected the evidence to be cited, he contents himself with merely expressing his belief that the shrine in question was erected near the site of Amenophis II's temple. Several German scholars, basing themselves on the secondary modifications of the inscription on Berlin 2072,90 believe that Amenophis III planned such a shrine, or actually lived to see it built.91 In actual fact, to anyone familiar with the Akhenaten material at Karnak, the Berlin block is not so unusual : the figure is that of Akhenaten surely, and as in the vast majority of cases, the original cartouche has undergone modification.92 Of a different sort is the evidence from Theban Tomb no. 46,93 the Deir el-Medina tomb of Se- tau,94 and the burial of Hatiay in the same area.95 The owner of tomb no. 46, Ramose, was "steward of the Mansion of the Disc/' and Hatiay was "scribe, overseer of granaries" in the same institution. While Setau's burial shows traditional elements, one of his shawabtis contains an expurgated text and calls for ' 'cool water from the materials that come forth on the altar in the presence of the Disc. ' '96 None of these gentlemen showed any aversion to including non-Atenist elements of a mythological nature in his interment, and this fact has led some to conclude that the three burials date to a time before Akhenaten came to the throne. As there is, however, ample evidence that the interdiction of mythological symbolism did not follow directly the accession of the new king, Ramose, Setau and Hatiay could have died and been laid to rest during the early years of the new monarch. Alter- natively, one could opt for the close of the "Amarna Period/' viz. those years intervening between the death of Akhenaten and the accession of Haremheb, when we know that temples of the Disc and the restored cults of other gods co-existed.97 Perhaps favoring the former alternative is the evidence of the names of two of Hatiay's relatives,98 which might point to the close of the Fifteenth Century rather than to the third quarter of the Fourteenth. On the other hand, the name of the temple wherein the two men functioned poses problems for both views. A priori it would seem likely that an official buried at Thebes would have lived his mature life in that city, and ipso facto would have fulfilled a function connected with Thebes or the Thebaid. Yet, nowhere in the texts from Amenophis Ill's reign, nor in any of the plenteous inscrip- tional material from the first five years of his successor, does hwt itn occur as the designation of a Theban temple. There was a temple of that name under Akhenaten at Memphis,99 and a far more famous one at Amarna;100 but, if Hatiay and Ramose functioned in either of these, why were they buried at Thebes? Four possibilities suggest themselves for the Mansion of the Disc: (1) a temple of Amenophis III built late in his reign; (2) a short-lived and otherwise unattested temple (perhaps a mortuary temple on the west bank) at Thebes, abandoned after the court moved to Amarna; (3), the Amarna temple, already planned early in the reign, to which Hatiay and Ramose, two old men, were attached in anticipation of its completion; (4) an otherwise unattested temple of Smenkhkare, Tutankhamun, or Ay, begun at Thebes shortly before Horemheb brought the Amarna interlude to a close. Of the four, we have already given reasons for rejecting (1), and (3) smacks of ingenuity; but between the remaining two, the choice is difficult. To sum up the evidence examined to this point : there is a bifurcation in the role played by the Disc in Egyptian thought. Already in the C T, the sun-disc occurs as an object or vehicle wherein the god or devotee could appear or ride, very much as in the sun-boat. It is distinct from the deity that possesses it, even though the deity can be born in its form. As a "Power of heaven" in its own right, the Disc is spoken of more rarely, but usually in association with the sun-god, and, at least on the eve of Akhenaten's reign, more or less on a par with such established names as Atum and Khepry. Side by side with the Disc as potent symbol of the mysteries was the paler image of the Disc as royal icon and symbol of Egypt's dominion. Enhanced by the association of uraeus with Disc, and also by the age-old concept of the paternity of Re vis-d-vis the king, the Disc was a simple but</page><page sequence="7">THE SUN-DISC IN AKHENATEN's PROGRAM 53 powerful hypostasis of the imperial idea, visible to and easily interpreted by everyone. During the Eighteenth Dynasty, the Disc is spoken of in contexts where the king is described as a universal conqueror. The monarch, in his regalia of world ruler, is likened to the sun-disc; his monuments are more dazzling than the sun-disc; and the sun disc looks down with favor upon his exploits. The monarch in fact is identified with the sun-disc: he is the sun-disc of all lands; a dazzling sun-disc at the head of his army; the sun-disc in his horizon; etc. It is interesting to note that this stream of development arises out of an extended metaphor and smacks of literary imagery. The "dazzling Disc" as appelative of the monarch is a concept having no historical or logical derivation from the sun-disc of the esoteric mortuary literature. Even less is it connected with the figure or cult of Reharakhty, even though evidence is not lacking from the reign of Tuthmosis IV, for example, of the king's obsession with the idea of the divine falcon.101 If the image of the "dazzling Disc/1 coming from the reign of Akhenaten's father, were the only stream in the development which produced Akhenaten's deity, we should fully expect to find what in other cultures and times would be termed a purely secular image. But Akhenaten introduces from the outset an unexpected element in the person and name of the falcon Reharakhty. The Iconography of Akhenaten* s God: Earliest Stage In no text known to the writer prior to the reign of Akhenaten is Reharakhty associated unequi- vocally with the sun-disc;102 but, from the inception of the new reign, the falcon-headed figure, standing or seated,103 is everywhere in evidence. The disc on his head is usually very large, and is equipped with a uraeus which hangs down and protrudes in front.104 The god's pose is traditional, as is his kilt. In one hand he grasps a large wss sceptre which he holds vertically in front of him. The most frequent scene comes from the large blocks in pylon io105 and shows the king offering to this falcon-headed god. Then the liquid contents of vessels (pl. IV :i), a tray of edibles,106 or vegetables.107 An offering stand is sometimes depicted between them, in one case holding bunches of flowers draped over three ewers (pl. IV: 2), in another the vegetables alone.108 The falcon-headed god is not the only one invoked or worshipped during this period. He may be grouped with Atum and Hathor, as in the tomb of Kheruef ;109 with Amun and Khonsu, as in the tomb of Ramose;110 or with Osiris, Anubis and Amun, as on the statue of an official in Brooklyn.111 On private monuments his concomitant epithet differs from the one which is usually called the "di- dactic name/' In the tombs of Kheruef,112 Parennefer,113 and on Berlin 2072 he is ntr U nb pt, "the great lord, lord of heaven/'114 and in Parennefer's tomb he also is hry ib[. . .], "who resides in [. . .]." On a fragment of a door jamb in Tubingen, he is "the august god of the primordial moment,"115 on the Brooklyn statue "Reharakhte the primordial, creator of all that is,"116 and on the stela of the chief sculptor Bek he is "the living Disc, who brightens the land with his beauty."117 On the stela of Amenmose from Heliopolis, he is called "Reharakhte- Atum, the Lord of the Two Lands, the Heliopolitan, the great sun-disc, the fashioner of brightness, the great god, lord of heaven."118 In like vein, a door jamb fragment now in the Sheikh Labib storeroom119 at Karnak links Amunre in the htp-dl-nsw formula with "Horakhty, the great sun-disc, the fashioner of brightness," followed by "the ka of the king, the Lord of the Two Lands."120 Thus, already at the outset of the reign, although grouped indiscriminately with other deities, the Disc is singled out for emphasis on three of its basic characteristics : (1) his creatorial nature, (2) his primordial existence, and (3) his relation- ship with the sunlight. In the new offering list from the Ninth Pylon,121 though the Disc is named with the standard "didactic name," the offerings and the altars are ascribed to Re. The offerings(?) to(?) "the Disc (are) upon the offering stands of Re," and "the King of Upper and Lower Egypt Neferkheperure</page><page sequence="8">54 JARCE XIII (1976) Wa-en-re [institutes the offerings] for his father Re, as an offering menu for every day in Memphis/' The altars in question are qualified as being located(?) "from [Memjphis as far as Sm?-nhdt." Thus, early in the reign, before the standardization of the cultus had restricted the god's epithets and discriminated against other deities, there was a strong move to set up a standard offering to the sun-god, called variously Re, the Disc, or referred to by the "didactic name/' and to enhance, if not inaugurate, the solar cult over wide stretches of the Delta. On the few royal monuments preserved from this earliest period,122 the standard epithet following the name Reharakhty (usually, if not always, in vertical columns) is hcy m sht m rn-f m sw nty m tin. To this epithet, a great deal of study has been devoted.123 The meaning probably cannot be precisely rendered, although the final element undoubtedly attempts to express an identification between "light" or "heat"124 which comes from125 the Disc, and Reharakhty himself. This, in itself, is an approach to an abstract idea: Re-the-horizon-falcon is in reality nought but the fiery heat which emanates from the sun-disc.126 The first element in the epithet was apparently not deemed as essential to the message conveyed by the whole as was the final m rn-f, etc., as it is once omitted.127 The correct understanding of this first part of the name depends on the precise nuance and the semantic subject of hcy. Most translations have rendered the form as an active participle whose antecedent and semantic subject is Reharakhty.128 While this is probably correct, I cannot disasso- ciate the component terms from the nuances current during the middle of the Eighteenth Dynasty. On the eve of the Amarna Period, during the last decade of Amenophis Ill's reign, Pr-hly had come to be used as a name for part, if not the whole, of the palace complex thrown up at Malkata for the celebration of the jubilees.129 In the second year of Akhenaten's reign, we encounter the expanded form bhn H'y-ni-tht,1*0 which can only be rendered as "the castle of him who rejoices in the horizon." That iht can be used metaphorically to designate the palace is already evident from its use in the tomb of Tjaneny, quoted above.131 On the basis of the meaning, then, the most obvious candidate for the epithet "He who rejoices in the horizon" is the king himself. On this understanding of the term, the divine epithet takes on new meaning. "Reharakhty is he who rejoices in the horizon" connotes a close proximity, if not identity, between the anthropo- morphic falcon deity and the king. Consonant with the thesis here propounded is the fact that, in representations of the new god from this early period in the reign, the god has a potbelly, like the royal celebrant who faces him. Except for the head, it could be Akhenaten himself! If the form of Reharakhty which Akhenaten came early to espouse is in reality but a projection of himself, a sort of alter ego, the name which ends the epithet added to the name of the solar deity must, mutatis mutandis, have likewise been inspired by the king. "Sunlight which is in the Disc" is a most fitting appellative of Akhenaten, who later at Amarna was to refer to himself as having emerged from the Disc's rays.132 The Iconography of Akhenaten's God: Intermediate Stage While Akhenaten did not subsequently condemn the hawk-headed image of the deity to deface- ment, it is occasionally found at Karnak with the name and epithet enclosed within two cartouches (i.e. the form of the name so intimately connceted with the later Disc representation). The falcon god was thus a bona fide supernal king, paralleling in the heavens the earthly king, his mirror image. Only a few examples of the anthropomorphic god combined with the cartouches are to be found at Karnak (cf. pl. VIII 12). Most are on the large sandstone blocks133 from the Tenth pylon, and on one at least (cf. pl. IV 13) the cartouches, incised on a small scale, were clearly added later to a larger scene in relief in which the name of the god was already present in vertical columns ! One cannot help but entertain a suspicion, then, that no anthropomorphic depiction of the god bore as its original designation the didactic name enclosed in cartouches.</page><page sequence="9">THE SUN-DISC IN AKHENATEN's PROGRAM 55 The exact date of the introduction of the cartouches into the name cannot be ascertained with certainty. Nor is it sure that the writing of the name in cartouches immediately and totally re- placed the older practice of writing it in columns or horizontal registers. One piece of linen from the tomb of Tutankhamun, dated in year 3 of Akhenaten, still writes the name in a column;134 while another piece with the same provenience, dated to year 4, second month of rsdmu1 (?) (or ftroyet?), employs the cartouches.135 This evidence might, with due caution, be advanced in support of the contention that the change from the hypothetical intermediate stage to the final stage of the icono- graphy is to be dated no later than the end of year 3.136 Some effort to represent the god by an abstract symbol, before the familiar icon was devised, is evidenced by Berlin 2072. Here, while on the left of the central panel the falcon-headed god appears, on the right, the lower curve of a large disc is seen over the king's head. Two uraei flank the disc on either side, and from them are suspended two large 'nhs. Three smaller cnhs hover beneath the disc without visible means of suspension. This latter omission, along with the absence of any graphic and direct relationship between the disc and the king, renders this particular form of the symbol less satisfying than the final result of experimentation. The Iconography of Akhenateris God: Final Stage131 The ultimate stage in the development of a non-cultic representation, towards which Akhenaten's thought seems to have been moving, is represented by the following revolutionary changes : (1) The falcon-headed man, as a mythopoeic representation of "Light which is in the Disc/' is replaced by a series of long, straight, stick-like arms which splay down and terminate in human hands. (2) The Disc is retained, but has suffered a quarter turn, so that now the uraeus is seen face-on. (3) The cartouches, which formerly belonged to the Reharakhty falcon-figure, now apparently qualify the Disc, and are placed on either side of it. (4) A new epithet is placed between the cartouches and the Disc and designates the latter as "the great living Disc which is in jubilee, lord of heaven and earth, who resides in (temple name)." The following observations are in order. First, Reharakhty, who formerly was depicted wearing the Disc on his head, and was thus distinct from it, has now witnessed the arrogation of his cartouches by the Disc itself. Second, in all subsequent patterns of scene in which the king performs the cultic act, he can no longer be portrayed as celebrating before a god. The Disc is above him, not before him, and, moreover, is now shown full-face. The effect is to make the celebrant, the king, the focal point of attention. Third, the new epithet, with its pointed reference to the jubilee, would seem to prove that the stage in the iconographic development under discussion coincided with the first si-festival.138 A block from the Tenth Pylon, and, to judge by certain features of its decoration, coming from the beginning of the final iconographic stage,139 makes the point (rather crudely) that it is the si-festival that the Disc vouchsafes to the king: the stunted outside arms of the arc of limbs clumsily hold out a si-pavilion hieroglyph and seated M-figures to the nose of the monarch. Fourth, the use of hry-ib, in preference to m or some other locution,140 suggests that the Disc is not a permanent resident in any of the structures named, but only a transient guest. His home is not in any structure, nor in art is he depicted in a shrine: he is always above it, shining down upon it, in graphic illustration of the dictum "heaven is thy temple."141 Fifth, the reduction of the god's emblem to a simple, non- tangible form provides a counterblast to the prevailing involvement of magician and craftsman in the manufacture of the god's earthly "body," his cult-image. Rather pointedly Akhenaten refers to the Disc as "the one who built himself by himself, with his (own) hands - no craftsman knows hini!"li2 Sixth, decoration employing the new iconography was mainly used on buildings constructed of talatat; but construction and decoration in the larger sandstone blocks was not</page><page sequence="10">56 JARCE XIII (1976) halted with the introduction of the new style. Buried still within the Tenth Pylon are large blocks, deeply incised and showing traces of colour, in which sun-ray arms are depicted descending upon the royal head, delineated in a manner suggesting the exaggeration of the new style. The supreme innovation of the new icon are the sun arms.143 In general, in Karnak art these perform three functions : they extend life and prosperity to the nasal and oral orifices of the royal celebrant, as well as to sundry other parts of his (or her) body; (pls. VII, IX :i, X:i, XI '.4) they caress, shelter and support the celebrant, and those accoutrements which partake of monarchic symbolism (e.g., the uraeus) ; and they take possession of the offerings that are rendered. Bestowal of life, prosperity, and dominion is symbolized by the cnh and ze&gt;/s-signs held out by the sunray hands (pls. VII, X). These need not always be directed towards the king's or queen's face; sometimes the arms holding them descend to the figure's waist, (pl. 3:1) as though endowing the torso with the physical well-being thus symbolized. While riding, the king can be surrounded by the arms and hands of his celestial father. 143a The sunray hands do not always grasp the symbols they proffer; rather the cnh and w;s are poised between thumb and forefinger, almost as though they are in the process of being released (pl. XI: 8). The manner in which the rays fondle and protect the celebrant constitutes a graphic illustration of the close tie between the king and queen and the heavenly father. The hands of the rays extend down into the king's open palm, as though about to caress the king's flesh;144 as the king extends his hand towards and touches the cartouches of his father, the sunray hands descend all along the outline of his arm in a gesture of approval (pl. IX : 2) ; as the monarch promenades the sunrays descend in front of him, as though protecting the path he is about to take (pls. VI: 2, VII). A very common arrangement of elements in the offering scene shows the sunray hands actually grasping and supporting the upper arms of the king and queen as they elevate the offerings (pl. X:2, XI: 2). Even more common is the motif in which the sunray hands are depicted enclosing the heads of the uraei on the royal headdress in protecting fashion (pls. X : 1, XI : 1, 3, 4, 5, 7, 2, 4). Occasionally they even hold the sign of dominion to the nose of the serpent (pl. XI: 4), or caress the wig the figure is wearing (pl. X:2). Even though the arrangement of elements in the typical offering scene suggest that Akhenaten is offering to a blank wall, there can be no doubt as to the identity of the intended recipient. The Disc often extends a great number of its stick-like arms in a wide arc over the offerings, engulfing them, possessing them, debarring them from outsiders (cf. pls. VII, XII :i, 3). When it is a burnt offering that is an artist's subject, the Disc's hands may be shown descending right down into the flames of the brazier, undaunted by the intense heat (pl. VII, XI: 6).

Sethe, NGW 1921, 106, 108 n. 1. To the writer's mind, by occasionally em- ploying the definite article with the word, Akhenaten emphasized that he was describing the object he worshipped, not suggesting a mysterious and latent essence betokened by a formal name. The word itn would have been classified by the Egyptians as neither rn nor nhbt. One wonders, in fact, whether it is not somewhat misleading to speak of "der alten einfachen Bedeutung 'Sonnenscheibe' " in contrast to "der Gott Jati" (so G. Fecht, ZAS 94 [1967], 48, n. 47). Generically, Akhenaten's god was the Disc; his name was Reharakhte. 3 Wb. I, 145 : 1. Examples of its basic use are legion, but some stress its physical (as opposed to its mystical) aspect more than others. In Urk. IV, 1948:14, for example, it is used in parallelism with the moon, as the two celestial orbs one desires to see in the Here- after. When solar and lunar eclipses are referred to,</page><page sequence="11">THE SUN-DISC IN AKHENATEN'S PROGRAM 57 itn is employed with respect to the former: Urk. VI, 123 (E. Hornung, ZAS 86 [1961], 114; R. A. Caminos, The Chronicle of Prince Osorkon [Rome, J958], 89). The astronomer Hor says that "I know the course (taken by) the Disc every morning to his point of touching'' (Berlin 14085: Agyptische Inschriften aud den Koniglichen Museen zu Berlin, vol. 2, 309), whereby he undoubtedly means that the varying path of the sun through the heavens during the course of the year is familiar to him. Cf. also the Prophecy of Neferty (W. Helck, Die Prophezeiung des Nfr'tj [Wiesbaden, 1970], 21 f.): "the sun-disc is clouded over and does not shine so that men may see. People cannot live when storm clouds cover it ... ." To judge from the determinative, itn could also be used of the moon's disc: cf. L. Habachi, JNES 11 (1952), pl. 33 (upper left). 4 Cf. CT III, 240, "Hathor with her prominent disc;" CT IV, 181, "that day of turmoil before necks had been tied and gods' heads had been copied, before the sun-disc had been implanted on the horns, or the face of Bat modelled" (the word-picture is clearly that of the horn and disc headdress). A Sekh- met statue from Karnak is called "Sekhmet of the disc" (with undoubted reference to the proclivity of such feline deities to wear this ornament), P. E. Newberry, PSBA 25 (1903), 221, no. 55; cf. also "Hathor . . . the Eye of Re, without peer, she with the beautiful face, who resides in his disc:" J.

"I have made my way in the prow of the barque of him who shines in his disc." 13 CT I, 209c. 14 CT VII, 2O7e-h. It is interesting to observe that the rebus with which the name Nb-miH-r* itn thn is written in the Malkata jar sealings shows a seated king with the sun-disc on his head holding the miH- feather, seated inside a simple disc conveyed on a boat: W.G.Hayes, JNES 10 (1951), 170, ftg. 25, E-F. 15 CT V, 187; it is also possible that "to open" here means a creative or inaugural act, rather than to throw open a thing previously closed. 16 It is also at times the god Thoth who, from at least as early as the First Intermediate Period, enjoyed a relationship of sorts with the disc as a symbol. In CT I, 230L, it is Thoth who, as son of Horus and grandson of Osiris ("son of your son"), is both pupil and teacher "within the disc." The passage hovers on the periphery of, but nonetheless is already aware of, the myth of Horus's begetting Thoth through sodomy with Seth (cf. Chester Beatty I, 12, 5ff, where the disc itself is the product of the impregnation). The motif of Thoth, as the disc itself, emerging from the god's brow to take its pi ce a at headdress, is reflected also in Thoth's epithet "he who emerged from the brow" (cf. C. J. Bleeker, Hathor and Thoth [Leiden, 1973], 112), a punning aetiology on Thoth's role as judge (wpi) of Horus and Seth. Whether there is a cosmic element in the myth, the moon (Thoth) being a product of the union of light (Horus) with darkness (Seth) (cf. J. Spiegel, Die Erzdhlung vom Streite des Horus und Seth [Gliick- stadt, 1937], 58) is difficult to say. 17 Litany of Re, columns 41, 48.

M. and J. Do- resse, JA 233 [1941-42], 181 ff.), is based largely on the material of this king from the region of the Sphinx. It is probably just by chance, however, that more of Amenophis IFs inscriptions than of his predecessors have come to light there, since it is known that the royal court used Memphis as a more or less permanent residence at least as early as Tuthmosis I (Urk. IV, 91), and, as this reference indicates, heirs apparent were even at that early date promenading near the Giza pyramids. The cult of the Sphinx, in its guise as Harmakhis, was only a local one under the early 1 8th Dynasty, as Tuthmosis IV's "Sphinx-stela" makes plain: "to him (the Sphinx) came Memphis and every town which was in its environs, bearing great gifts to his ku" (Urk. TV, 1542:5-9). Never- theless there are a few isolated examples of Amenophis II 's devotion to the solar deity that might be construed as harbingers of things to come. For one thing, an early representation of a sort of (two) -armed sun-disc dates to his reign (cf. Doresse, loc. cit.), and a curious statuette from the reign shows the king enveloped by a large Re-harakhty falcon (cf.

Badawy (ZAS 87, 86) has compared the enclosure wall of the hwt ps itn at Amarna with the butressed temenos at Medinet Habu; and, in private conversation, my colleague Dr. Nicholas B. Millett has plausibly suggested a mortuary nuance in the expression involving hwt. 101 Cf. the motif of the king in the costume of the falcon (bik) which was popular among the Thut- mosids: H. Brunner, ZAS 83 (1958), 74 f.; idem, ZAS 87 (1962), 76 f.; P. Krieger, RdE 12 (i960), 37ft.; Sauneron, BIFAO 70 (1971), pl. 69; D. Wildung, LA II, 1 (1975), 96 f. See also above, n. 79. 102 The hymn of Suty and Hor, characterized as an "adoration of Amun when he rises as Harakhty," balances rl nfr n r( nb against itn n hrw in two formulae beginning ind hrk, apparently dividing the hymn into two sections: I. E. S. Edwards, Hieroglyphic Texts from Egyptian Stelae etc. in the British Museum, pt. 8, pl. 21. I see no precursor of the alleged Reha- rakhty-Aten theologizing of Amarna (pace G. Fecht,</page><page sequence="14">6o JARCE XIII (1976) ZAS 94 [1967], 35ff.)&gt; and I see no necessity for considering the divine names following itn as "dem Jati untergeordnet" {ibid., 36). Moreover, it is deba- table whether the allusion to Horus and the "sturdy shepherd'* are to be understood as referring to the king {ibid., 37 ff.). Rather than presaging Amarna, the hymn to my mind looks backwards to the tendency of the early 18th Dynasty of addressing solar gods and conceiving them in terms of the visible sun, the disc of the daytime. 103 Aldred, JEA 45 (1959), 19^, pl. 3- 104 I.e. the group which the Hieroglyphic Papyrus calls "the sundisc of Re": Griffith, Tanis Papyri, xiii, 11. Exceptionally, the uraeus seems to be absent: cf . pl. VIII : 1 (unless this block be Ramesside, which is possible in view of its provenience, viz. Luxor temple). 105 These large sandstone blocks, which come from the interior of the 10th Pylon and belonged to one of the earliest structures of the new reign, will be treated in more detail in a forthcoming publication. 106 See pl. VIII: 2. The small-scale scene shows Akhenaten facing left in a sndyt, with only a slight paunch in evidence. Just visible on the farther side of the offering stand is an extended arm holding the wts. The whole is fairly traditional. 107 See JARCE 12 (1975), pl. ib. The accom- panying formula reads "giving various herbs." In an adjacent scene the king, wearing the white crown, waves the ^/^-scepter over three small, trussed bulls. Except for a trace of obesity in the abdomen, and a slight bulge of thigh, the king's figure is not a far cry from the traditional. Cf . also pl. VIII : 3 (where the feet in the register above suggest that a wall surface with scenes in panels is being depicted) . In pl. VIII : 4, 5 the scene of offering to Reharakhty seems to be used to adorn the sides of a ship's cabin. 108 The fact that on the talatat most depictions of the falcon-headed god are in a small scale may find an explanation if such representations are supposed to be of relief or painted decoration on walls or other surfaces already standing when the talatat structure in question was put up. If this be the case, the first stage in the iconography may not be directly repre- sented at all in the talatat. 109 A. Fakhry, ASAE 42 (1943), 459, 463. 110 Davies, Ramose, pls. 30, 31. 111 James, Corpus Brooklyn, pl. 74, no. 287. 112 Fakhry, ASAE 42, 459. 113 Davies, JEA 9 (1923), pl. 23. 114 Cf. H.

Kaiser, Agyptisches Museum Berlin (Berlin, 1967), no. 766. 118 Cairo 34146. 119 See pl. V:3 (block, no. 0713 03201; 29.5 x 70 cm.). That it is in fact part of a door jamb is suggested, not only by the smooth surface on the right side, but also by its similarity to two other fragments which almost certainly come from jambs, viz. 0714 03201 and 0713 03900 (see pl. V: 1,2; both are in the Sheikh Labib storehouse). These showed columns of text comprising the cartouches of the Disc, and the titulary and cartouches of Akhenaten. 120 The second column, also a htp-di-nsw formula, invokes "Montu, Lord of Thebes, the very strong, King of the Gods" and again "the ks of the king ..." 121 R. Saad, JEA 57 (1971), pl. 21, lines 12-13. It is unclear whether the "offering stands of Re," located between Memphis and the northern extremities of the Delta, are all to be the recipients of the offering- menu which follows. Certainly, the first part of the list details the offering which the king instituted in Memphis; perhaps this was deemed an inaugural celebration, and a prototype for the local cult centers of the Delta to follow. 122 por occurrences of the epithet in columns, i.e. before being enclosed in cartouches, see Davies, Ramose, pl. 30; idem, JEA 9 (1923), pl. 27I1; Berlin 2072; G. Legrain, ASAE 3 (1902), 260L; Urk.IV, 1962; M. Sandman, Texts from the Time of Akhenaten, 147:6; R. Saad, JEA 57 (1971), pl. 21, lines 12-13. For small objects see R. Anthes, ZAS 90 (1963), 3, n. 1 ; this format is common in the Reharakhty blocks; for the talatat cf. pl. VIII 17. 123 See Sethe, NGW 1921, io6ff.; B. Gunn, JEA 9 (1923), 168 ff.; Bonnet, Reallexikon, 60; G. Fecht, ZAS 85 (i960), iooff.; Anthes, ZAS 90 (1963), 36.; W. Westendorf, Studia Aegyptiaca I (Budapest, 1974), 392!; J. Assman, LA I, 526ff. 124 Anthes, ibid., 4-5. 125 Not "which is in the Disc," as this would almost certainly be rendered by imy itn. 126 Anthes' rendering (ZAS 90, 4L), which reduces m rn'f and m $w to coordinated phrases depending on hy, founders on the variant alluded to in the following note: ... r irt pi bnbn '/ n R^-hr-My m rn'f m $w nty m itn. This would seem to clinch the understanding of what follows the second m as the name itself. 127 Silsileh Quarry inscription: Urk. IV, 1962. 128 Theoretically, hy could be construed as passive participle with resumptive rn-f, thus "(Reharakhty is) one at whose name they rejoice in the horizon." 129 Hayes, JNES 10 (1951), 163!, 177! 130 Ibid., 180. 131 Above, n. 75. 132 A passage in Anii (vii, 16) smacks of the trans- cendence of "sunlight" {pi sw): "the god of this land is the Sunlight in the horizon; his images are upon earth" (A. Volten, Studien zum Weisheitsbuch des Anii [Copenhagen, 1937], I][I)- The context of the passage, which is a series of admonitions on how to</page><page sequence="15">THE SUN-DISC IN AKHENATEN's PROGRAM 6l behave before one's god, has a curious equivocal ring : mutatis mutandis it could be a set of instructions on how to comport oneself before the king. In this passage the deity is the object of offering and censing; so was the Amarna pharaoh. The god is said to have abominations; so did Akhenaten. He appears (hy) and is carried in a portable conveyance; a king could also be the semantic subject. He displays his power and exalts him who exalts him-all possible predications of a monarch of the Amarna age. Rather than being an anticipation of the latter, as some think (Volten, op. cit., 60 ff., 116; S. Morenz, Die Heraufkunft des transzendenten Gottes in Agypten, 36), it seems to me the passage in Anii lies in the wake of Akhenaten. 133 See above, n. 105; cf. also JARCE 12 (1975), pl. Ib. 134 Cairo display no. 1229. 135 Cairo display no. 1230. 136 On the assumption that Akhenaten's regnal years began on the first month of proyet: Redford, JNES 25 (1966), 122. 137 To try to refine our understanding of the incep- tion of the new art form by postulating more stages and sub-stages than the three isolated here is quite frankly tantamount to introducing fantasy, at least on the basis of the evidence presently at hand. Such attempts as have been made to this end have usually relied heavily on the scenes in the Theban tombs of Parennefer, Ramose and Kheruef, along with a handful of talatat and other fragments long known. Private tomb art cannot be said to be a reliable guide, as it does not reflect directly the tastes and persuasions of the setters of fashion, being on the periphery of the world of royal art as represented in the temples. We should not expect, then, the three tombs in question clearly to reflect evolutionary stages in the style of art with which the king was decorating his structures in Thebes ; and their private nature, together with the possibility of a time-lag renders them very dangerous to use as evidence. 138 It is doubtful whether the stock phrases on one of the Reharakhty blocks (no. 101) should be inter- preted as a specific reference to the king's first jubilee: " Utterance: 'I grant thee a s&lt;2-festival [....]» I cause thy name to be established [....]; I1 grant thee my lifetime in heaven . . .'" The weight of the Karnak evidence, however, is strongly in favor of a sd -festival relatively early in the reign. See the writer in JA RCE 12 (1975), PP. 9#. 139 Aldred, Akhenaten, pl. 46. The following features link this relief to the "revolutionary" period of the art of Akhenaten: the exaggerated paunch of the king, the Disc with its arms, the Disc's name within cartouches. But the gesture of the arms in censing, and the chubby face are in contrast to the vast majo- rity of talatat decoration. I am grateful to Dr. Charles F. Nims for his discussions with me on this and other subjects. 140 M is only rarely found in the talatat : cf . pl. VIII : 6. 141 Sandman, Texts, 71:8; hence no cult image and no need for axial processional temples : A. Badawy, ZAS 102 (1975), 79. On one block (0106 07706) the Disc is said to "shine in the House of the Disc." Cf. also J. Assman, JNES 31 (1972), 147. 142 Boundary stela K, line 30; Urk. IV, 1971 : 12-13 (or "no craftsman is capable of it"?). 143 See pl. XII: 2. On the sunray arms see M. and J. Doresse, JA (1941-2), 183 n. 7; E. Hornung, ZAS 97 (1971), 74L Sun-discs are farely shown equipped with arms in other periods: for an example from the reign of Amenophis II, see Doresse, op. cit., p. 188. The temple of Hibis at el-Kharga contains a curious example of a sun-disc provided with two clumsy arms which swing an ankh towards the nose of the king (Persian period : Porter and Moss, Topographical Bibliography, 7 (Oxford, 1951), p. 276 at 59). 143a JARCE 10 (1973), pl. 9:1. 144 PL X:3. The fact that, in pl. IX: 2, the king's hand actually extends over, and touches, the Disc's cartouche, suggests that the latter is to be construed as something concrete, and therefore distinct from the usual epitheta which flank the Disc in every scene. Could we be dealing here with an actual "cult object"? In this regard one is reminded of the curious limestone block discovered in the first court at Karnak (cf. R. Saad, C. Traunecker, Kemi 20 (1970), 124, fig. 106) in which the face is almost entirely occupied by the two large upright cartouches of the Disc, the top conforming to the curvature. (The sides show the names of the king below the Disc's names.) The scholars who published this text wondered whether it was "la representation en ronde bosse du dieu, sym- bolist par son nom, lie* a celui de son promoteur" (ibid., 171).</page><page sequence="16">DONALD B.
