<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEMETER, ERINYS, ARTEMIS The purpose of this article is, to examine the Demeter Erinys cults in Arca- dia as well as the cult associations between Demeter, Erinys, Artemis and Poseidon, in order to throw some light, if possible, on some important aspects of the early development of the figure of Erinys. Pausanias tells us' that Demeter was violated by Poseidon in Phigalia, and that she gave birth to a daughter, named by the Arcadians Despoina. Demeter afterwards, wroth with Poseidon and mourning the rape of Persephone, put on a black robe and retired to a cave which was about thirty furlongs distant from the town of Phigalia. For this Demeter, whom the Phigalians called Melaina because of the colour of her dress, they fashioned a wooden image in the likeness of a woman but with the head of a horse encircled with figlures of snakes and of other animals. In one hand this figure carried a dolphin and in the other a dove. This image was lost, and the Phigalians at the command of the Delphic Oracle had another image made by the sculptor Onatas who again is said to have been guided in his work by a painting or a copy of the old statue, as well as by visions in his dreams 2. This statue, too, was no longer there when Pausanias visited the cave. At the entrance to this cave of Demeter Melaina the Phigalians had built an altar on which they laid their offerings consisting of fruits from trees, honeycombs, unspun wool and oil. In the beginning of the same chapter Pausanias says that the legend of the love of Poseidon and Demeter in Phigalia is identical with that told in Thelpusa. There, according to Pausanias3, Demeter in search of her daughter was pursued by Poseidon who wished to win her favour. To elude him she changed into a mare and grazed with the horses of Oncius. But Poseidon, who could see through her deception, took the form of a horse also and so violated the goddess. Demeter, wrathful at first, relented eventually and bathed in the river Ladon, wherefore she received two names, Erinys and Lusia. In her temple, then, were two statues, one of Erinys, and a smaller of Lusia, both fashioned of wood with the faces, feet and hands of marble. Demeter Erinys held in her right hand the torch, and in her left the cista. Pausanias discounts the belief that the smaller image represented Themis and not Lusia4. From her alliance was born the horse .1 Paus. 8, 42. 2 Paus. 8, 42,7. 3 Paus. 8, 25,4if.- ' Cf. U. v. WILAMOWITZ-MOELLENDORFF, Der Glaube der Hellenen, repr. Basel 1956, I 394.

Before examining these cults more closely, however, we will take note of the Erinys in Tilphusa, Boeotia, where Poseidon, too, changed into the shape of a horse, did violence to the Tilphossan Erinys-who had the shape of a mare- and upon her begat the horse Arion.2. The resemblance between the Arcadian and the Boeotian myth is striking, as are the names of the localities of Posei- don's amorous adventures: Oncae3 in Boeotia, and Onceum4 in Arcadia, and Tilphusa and Thelpusa5. Accordingly, it was realized some time ago6 that both cults have a common origin, and it has been supposed that one cult, or part of it, was virtually bodily transferred to the other locality; a confusion which can at times be discerned from careless references'. Pausanias' description of the Phigalian cult has caused much trouble to some scholars; the shape of the old image of Demeter in the cave in particular seemed unusual even in Arcadia, the home of many archaic cults. Pausanias in fact had never seen the ancient xoanon nor Onatas' copy, so that it has occa- sionally been believed that he fell victim to an elaborate hoax8. On comparing, however, the important part played by the horse in the related cults described above, as well as the close association of this type of Demeter with Artemis- which will be discussed below-it appears that Pausanias' information about the horse-headed goddess probably was reliable9. Indeed, the common feature which connects these cults is the important part played by the horse. Even 1 PAULY-WIssowA,Realencyclopadie der klassischen Altertumswissenschaft, Suppl.VIII 'Erinys' (WtST), 100. WUST sees in the figure of Lusia, Themis, because the latter was = Ge in Delphi according to Aesch. Prom. Vinct. 2II f., and Pausanias who follows Aeschylus (IO, 5, 6). Regarding Demeter's daughter at Thelpusa, WtST maintains, op. cit.99, that Pausa- nias did not give her name either because he did not know it, or because he wished to avoid the obvious contradiction. 2 Schol. on Hom.

Both in Phigalia and in Thelpusa the fruit of the union was a daughter-Des- poina-while in the latter cult locality Demeter also is said to have given birth to the horse Arion. The figure of the daughter in both these cults at first sight seems disturbing in a legend which obviously describes an old theriomorphic deity2, and may perhaps be attributed to the influence exerted on this myth by the Eleusinian Demeter, for we can in no other way satisfactorily account for the presence of the torch and cista in the hands of the Demeter Erinys statue at Thelpusa. Another addition to the original legend must have been the story of Demeter's search for Kore at the time when Poseidon conceived his love for her. Similarly, the daughter Despoina at Phigalia and the 'anony- mous' daughter at Thelpusa may have been identified with the Kore of the Eleusinian mysteries; and this seems to be borne out by Pausanias' statement3 that the name of Demeter's daughter at Thelpusa was not revealed to the uninitiated. While it is unlikely, however, that WtST is right in suggesting that Pausanias did not disclose the name in order to avoid an obvious contra- diction 4, it is probable that the cult-followers of the Thelpusan Demeter Erinys in Pausanias' time had forgotten the true significance of Demeter Erinys and Despoina in that locality and were celebrating mysteries in honour of the god- desses along the lines of Eleusis5. We are dealing here with a rather different type of Demeter than that com- monly known in pan-Hellenic cult, although both types have in common their chthonic nature and their concern for the growth and fertility of nature, which in the case of the latter type, however, is confined to the growth of corn. The chthonic nature of the Arcadian Demeter at Phigalia and Thelpusa is apparent from her titles and cult associations 6. The chthonic origin of the figure of Erinys need no longer be discussed in detail: it is evident from the nature of her cult, from her offerings, and from the cult localities which frequently lay beside an entrance to Hades-e.g. at Athens by the Areopagus, Colonus Hippius, and Tilphossion-as well as from her genealogy in literature 7.

Cithaeron in honour of the Melainai whom WtST equates with the Erinyes'. We are also reminded of the figure of the earth goddess Aphrodite Melainis who had cults in the vicinity of Mantinea, Arcadia2, in Thespiae 3, and in Corinth4 and whom, together with Aphrodite Apostrophia, IMMERWAHR connects with the Tilphossan Erinys5. The true nature of the Arcadian Demeter Melaina at Phigalia and the Demeter Erinys at Thelpusa6 emerges from a closer examination of the latter cult. Pausanias says7 that the goddess at Thelpusa ))received two surnames: that of Fury 'Eetvvg on account of her wrath, because the Arcadians call a fit of anger Etvv'Etv; and that of Lusia, because she bathed (Aov'oraaoiat) in the Ladon((8. This patent attempt to explain the connexion of Demeter and Erinys by means of the Thelpusan myth has been recognized some time ago 9. The presence of Erinys in Thelpusa has nothing to do with Demeter's anger 10, but marks out the chthonic nature of her cult there as well as her connexion with the Tilphossan Erinys. As mentioned above, it has been supposed that this cult had at one time been bodily transferred from one locality to the other. It is undecided, however, whether Tilphusa or Thelpusa can lay claim to being the first to practise Demeter Erinys worship, although most scholars come down in favour of Boeotia as the original cult locality, mainly on the ground that in Tilphusa Erinys already was in the shape of a mare when Poseidon sought her favours"l. It is doubtful whether the question of priority will ever be satisfac- 1 op. cit. I30. For the story of the annual duel of the Boeotian Xanthus and the Athenian Melanthus see schol. on Arist.

In any case, tradition makes no mention of a Demeter in Tilphusa. Poseidon there violated Erinys who al- ready had the shape of a horse, and from this union the horse Arion was born. According to legend, Demeter in Thelpusa only assumed the shape of a horse to escape Poseidon's attention, and therefore it might be argued that the figure of the horse in the Arcadian cult was due to Boeotian influence. FARNELL1 argues that it was probably in association with Poseidon that Demeter and Erinys temporarily assumed the shape of a horse. But this is out of keeping with the cult at Tilphusa and Phigalia at least, where the horse-shape must have been an original element that did not arise out of an association with Poseidon; in fact, the figures of Demeter and Erinys at Tilphusa were associated with the horse quite independently of Poseidon 2. Poseidon Hippius played an im- portant part in Greek religion 3, and it is as Hippius that he came into contact with Demeter and Erinys 4, so closely indeed that Demeter and Poseidon have justly been called avvvaot5, for they shared a number of cults, on the road from Athens to Eleusis 6, in Eleusis at the Haloa 7, at Myconus8, and at Troezen9. Erinys, too, was at times associated with this Poseidon, mainly perhaps because of the cult connexion in Tilphusa, Boeotia (above p. I30). Once Poseidon and Erinys are associated in myth, perhaps derived from a Theban saga, which BERT, Berlin I894, I 59I; KRAPPE, RhM 8i, 1932, 312; cf. IMMERWAHR, Kulte u. Myth.

I 447 n. 5, argue that the Tilphossan Erinys was confused with the Arcadian Demeter Erinys. FARNELL, Cults III 52f., believes that the 'identity of cult, legend, and name proves identity, whole or partial, of race'. He, ibid. 53 f., is inclined to think that the Boeotian figure of Erinys was introduced to Arcadia, but that their junction in Arcadia as Demeter Erinys shows 'a community of divine nature'. O Op. cit. III 62. 2 Cf. FARNELL, Op. cit. III, 58 on this point. 3 FARNELL, Op. cit. IV I4-26. 4 FARNELL'S attempt at showing that this Poseidon hailed from the North of Greece and notably Thessaly, has failed mainly owing to the fact that this cult was predominantly centred in the Peloponnese. #Der Versuch, die peloponnesischen Kulte des Poseidon aus Thessalien herzuleiten, ist hoffnungslos; wenn man den Ursprung eines Kultes fiiglich dort sucht, wo er am starksten ist, wiirde dies entschieden auf den Peloponnes hinweisen(i (NILSSON, Gesch. I 449). But NILSsoN agrees that the Boeotian, Thessalian, and Pelo- ponnesian cults of Poseidon Hippius originated from the same ethnic root, ))da13 der Kult in Thessalien, Boeotien und auf dem Peloponnes, der sich durch die enge Verbindung mit dem Pferd auszeichnet, auf ein gemeinsames ethnisches Substrat zurilckgeht#.

DIETRICH tells of an alliance between the two out of which was born the horse Arion'. Hesychius 2 mentions that Arion's parents were Poseidon and one of the Erinyes, while Apollodorus3 speaks of Poseidon who begat Arion on Demeter in the shape of Erinys4. Now, legend probably was responsible for a number of the Poseidon-Erinys alliances, which may accordingly in some parts have been later inventions and given rise to further elaborations5; therefore caution is advisable in using the above cited sources on the Poseidon-Erinys connexion, because they are but secondary evidence for the myth, and they cannot be assumed to reflect the actual cult connexion of Erinys and Poseidon. One con- clusion, however, may be safely drawn from these notices: that the frequent recurrence in different versions of the myths, dealing with the association of Poseidon and Erinys, indicates its great popularity. Furthermore, to this same group we may add the alliance between Poseidon and Medusa which produced the horse Pegasus6. Medusa, an early deity of the underworld7, whose possible early significance in religion has been lost in her gruesome development, closely resembled this Erinys8. The essential factor of the horse in all these cults, whether it appeared as the fruit of the Poseidon alliance, or in the image of Melaina, poses the ques- tion of its significance in connexion with Erinys and Demeter. It exposes the root 1 See schol. on Hom. Il. 23, 347, who says that this myth appeared in the Cyclic epics, while ot vecTreewo say that Arion was bon from Poseidon and a Harpy. See WILAMOWITZ, op. cit. I 393. On the similarity of Harpy and Erinys and their identical functions see below P. I47- 2 S. v. 'Aeldev. a 3, 6, 8. 4 One may note in this connexion the remark of the schol. on Soph. Antig. I26, cf. WtST, P.-W. Suppl. VIII s. v. *Erinys# I30; WILAMOWITZ, Op. cit. I 394, according to which Ares and the Tilphossan Erinys bore the dragon that was subsequently slain by Cadmus. WILAMOWITZ, ibid., sees in this an example of the transference of an Arcadian cult in which Poseidon and Demeter were the parents of Arion. In fact, Ares was a later addition to the Greek pantheon, see below p. I40 n. 8, and may have come to be asso- ciated with Erinys via Arion with whom he was in later times occasionally connected, see below ibid. HEDEN, Hom. G6tt. 138 n. I, believes Ares to have been Arion's father; but this is unlikely, because the myth of Arion in connexion with Poseidon, Demeter, Erinys, must antedate that of Ares. 6 E.g. the Ares-Erinys alliance which was connected with Theban saga, see TtMPEL, P.-W. S. v. )&gt;Areion# 622. 6 Hes. Theog. 28I, who is followed by the schol. on Pind. 01. I3, 89, and others. Hryyaaog derives from nqy , the horse is therefore virtually identical with Poseidon as the god of fountains, see NILSSON, Gesch. I 45I. This aspect of Poseidon is very important in eva- luating the figure of Demeter Erinys with whom the former was closely connected, see below pp. 135 f. WILAMOWITZ, Op.

Poseidon was a god of horses and of streams, fountains, rivers, and water in general, a function 1 which he retained in Homer. Of his many epithets of primary importance were Hippius, Pelagius, and Phy- talmius-of vegetation.2. As the god of horses he was intimately connected with the deities of rivers, at times usurping their functions. For the horse, while, as FARNELL justly points out 3, it was not associated with the harvesting of the fields-since it was not employed by the Greeks for agricultural purposes-did have affinities with deities of vegetation and nature, by virtue of its close con- nexion with the water of founts and rivers. For this reason beings of the water in European belief to this day are frequently pictured as possessing the shapes of horses, just as in Greece numerous founts and streams bore the names of horses4; and the deities associated with them occasionally appeared in the form of horses 5. Accordingly, to them were sacrificed horses which were cast in the sea or water of the cult locality6. We have seen above the association of Poseidon and Demeter in cult, and in the sphere of water and general vegetation further connexions must have been evolved7. This very important connexion between Demeter and the river 1 Together with that of an earth deity in the capacity of &amp;vvorlyatog, strangely enough. But see NILSSON, Op. cit. I 4sof. 2 This epithet he has in Athens where his cult was very old, and where he was originally perhaps joined with Erechtheus, see NILSSON, Op. cit. I 448 ff. 3 Cults III 59. 4 E.g. Hippocrene, Aganippe, Callippia, etc., see NILSSON, Op. cit. I 242, who gives the relevant sources; cf. L.

DELEBECQUE, Le cheval dans l'Iliade, Paris 195I, 241 f. 5Therefore we may assume that Poseidon could readily be imagined in this shape which he assumed in the Demeter Erinys legend. For European parallels see W. MANNHARDT, Antike Wald- und Feldkulte aus nordeuropaischer Vberlieferung, Berlin I877, II 203 (*WasserroB3); FRAZER'S ed. of Pausanias, London 19I3, on 2, 5, I. Cf. M.

Cf. his Griechische Feste 72 n. i, where he explains the comparative rarity of this sacrifice as being due to its great expense. Significant is the notice of Polemon in Athenaeus, I I, 462 b, c, which describes a similar offering at Syracuse, and enumerates the sacrificial objects which consisted of honey and flowers-in a cup- precisely the same as to the underworld deities, as for instance the Erinyes. Cf. DELE- BECQUE, Op. cit. 239. 7 As often, so in this case etymology is not particularly helpful. Poseidon = Zeus in the water (toat, noTtCo), =oTauwg), where AIa'v according to Herodian (NILSSON, Op. cit. I 445 n. 2) is a Boeotian form of Zeus. This derivation was originally followed by A. B. COOK, Classical Review I7, I903, I75f., and by H. L. AHRENS, Philologus 23, i866, Iff.; I93ff., cited by NILSSON, ibid. A later etymology has it that Poseidon = husband of Demeter (to'aog Aa) which is largely followed by P. KRETSCHMER, Glotta I, I909, 27f.; K. BRUG- MANN, GrundriB d. vergleichenden Grammat. d. indogerm. Sprachen2, I911, II 135; and by WILAMOWITZ, Op. cit.

DIETRICH and thus the horse god can be seen from a note in an Oxyrhynchus Papyrus which tells us that many sacrificed to the river god Achelous before Demeter, and indeed the association between the water and earth deities was a common feature in Greek religion 2. Thus although Poseidon cannot without some doubt be called a chthonic deity, his close junction with Demeter-whether it was an original feature or not-makes him a deity of vegetation also, a fact which be- comes plain from the by no means infrequent epithet of Phytalmius 3. As Phytal- mius he received offerings similar to those of Demeter4, and, of course, was associated with her vegetation rites in Eleusis 5. The horse, then, in an association between Demeter and Poseidon would not be out of place; but beyond this Demeter herself had an entirely independent claim to this shape, as did the Erinys in Boeotia 6. How much j ustification is there for considering the horse a chthonic beast in Greek religion? The scholar who first explored this subject scientifically and on a large scale was A. B. COOK7, when he tried to show, unsuccessfully on the evidence, that Greek religion in its first stages, lhke most primitive creeds, was totemistic. FARNELL8 has pointed out that a large portion of COOK's evidence was too slight to support his theory for Greece at any rate, quoting as he did only one cult in Sparta which is de- scribed by Pausanias9 where the sacrifice of horses might have obtained, and which therefore could be considered to have a positive bearing on this question 1. He, therefore, rejects the chthonic connexions in favour of this theory of the invasion of this type of cult from the northern regions of Greece. Nevertheless-apart from the llnk with vegetation-there may be some slight justification for believing that the horse was a chthonic animal, though the evidence in its favour is perhaps not overwhelming. L. MALTEN11 discusses who latterly came over to this opinion. For a discussion of this whole question see NILSSON, ibid. While neither etymology is perhaps conclusive, both still serve to point to the im- portant spheres in the Poseidon cult. Cf. F.

Berlin 1956, 62. 6 It is interesting in this connexion to note HEDEN'S theory (Hom. Gott. I37) who claims that the Arcadian Demeter was a horse originally as a chthonic deity. If HEDEN'S theory is correct one could perhaps extend it to include the figure of Erinys, who was a chthonic deity closely connected with the horse. 7 In his long article, )&gt;Animal Worship in the Mycenaean Age., in Journal of Hellenic Studies (I894). 8 Cults III 59. 3, 20, 9. 10 But see above p. 135 n. 6. 11 Jahrb. 29, I86; where there is a complete discussion of this connexion.</page><page sequence="9">Demeter, Erinys, Artemis I37 the popular concept of Hades with horse and chariot receiving the souls of the dead and conveying them to his realm below and he believes it to have been responsible for the epithet - xAvTro'roAog - well known in Homer. He further maintains that this was the original form ('Urform') of the myth of the rape of Kore 1. In support of this NILSSON quotes the relief of Echelus and Basile 2, and two similar reliefs from Rhodes and Chios without inscriptions, in addition to the relief from Trieste dedicated to Zeuxippus and Basilea3. Furthermore the figure of the horse in the Demeter Erinys cults by virtue of its association with water and streams provides a link between Demeter and Artemis. The second statue in Thelpusa bore the name Lusia. The duality has been recognized to be analogous to the Great Goddesses, but this does not explain the title Lusia4. An answer must be thought of which applies to both the Phigalian and the Thelpusan Demeter, because they must have been inti- mately connected5; and it is extremely likely that this answer lies in the close association of Demeter with Artemis. By the alliance with Poseidon it has been seen that Demeter was thought of in this locality not only as a deity responsible for the growth of corn 6, but for fertility in general coming from the founts and streams in the country. It is this aspect, indeed, which accounts for the title of Lusia, also held by Artemis at Lusoi7, where Melampus healed the daughters of Proteus of their madness8. Pausanias mentions that as well as 1 In modern popular belief in Greece, Charos-the god of death-is still imagined as riding away to fetch his prey which he suspends from his saddle, see NILSSON, Gesch. I 454 and n. I for the relevant sources. 2 For reading of BacitAt possibly 'IaatAr see NILSSON, OP. cit. I 453 n. 5. 3 Perhaps some geometric vessels from Camirus give supporting evidence of the horse = a symbol of death. On this point see C. PICARD, Les religions pr6hell6niques, Paris 1948, I34; cf. I7If. etc. In Etrurian art representations, too, the horse frequently was connected with death, see F. DE RUYT, Charun, d6mon dtrusque de la mort, Bruxelles I934, I99. But DB RUYT, Op. Cit. i98ff., suggests that this association of horse with death arose from the fact that the horse in popular imagination was fancied to convey the dead to the underworld. 4 The difference in size between the images-nine and six feet (Paus. 8, 25, 7)-is not of great importance, but marked an association in which the Demeter Erinys was of foremost importance. 5 FARNELL, OP. cit. III 50 calls these *sisterworships((. 8 The myth at Phigalia clearly being an aetiological superimposition, whose inconsis- tency is still obvious in the lines of Pausanias. 7 Compare with this FARNELL, Op. cit. II 63, who comes near to this belief, but fails to see all its possible implications. He says, ))But the word may be more naturally explained as an ordinary local adjective, designating Demeter of Aovarofx. Lusoi was outstanding because of the abundance of water in that locality. For this reason Strabo 8, 343, remarks on the many temples for deities of water in that area. Therefore it must be considered an important indication of the significance of the horse in Greek religion when we are told of the presence of the type of goddess on horse-back in that area-for this point see below. 8 Paus. 8, I8, 8.</page><page sequence="10">I38 BERNARD C. DIETRICH Lusia, Artemis was also styled Thermia in this locality, a point that greatly supports WiUST'S etymology of Oc')Aovaa as derived from 0d2rio 'to warm', 'grow warm' 1. Indeed, because Artemis is closely connected with this type of vegetation cult, she quite naturally-like Demeter-is also associated with the horse and meets in cult with Poseidon. In Pheneus, Arcadia, Artemis with the title of Ei3'nrxa is associated with Poseidon `I.urtoq in cult 2. Altogether Artemis' association with Poseidon was common. Thus they had a common cult in e.g. Eleusis3, Hermion 4, Corinth5, at Caphyae6, Orchomenus 7, in Sparta8, Nau- pactus9, and a probably late one atAmyclae'0. Artemis' connexion with horses, moreover, becomes clear from a number of striking finds-especially in Sparta- of ivory, terracotta, and lead pendant type offerings which belong to the seventh and sixth centuries. These commonly consist of a human head between two horses. Occasionally, however, the whole figure is shown holding two horses by either hand. The figure has been reliably identified with Artemis by M. S. THOMPSON". THOMPSON also-although less certainly-identifies with Artemis a number of terracotta figurines on horseback from Sparta'2. Still more instruc- tive are some terracottas from the Artemision at Lusoi 13 showing female figures seated sideways on horseback. THOMPSON quite rightly sees in them types of Artemis, too, (op. cit. 30I) because-as he says-this type occurs especially at shrines of Artemis. Thus it is reasonable to assume that on this plane Artemis' sphere of influence comes close to that of the goddess Demeter in Thelpusa, and also in Phigalia presumably, because the latter had similar associations with water, exemplified by Poseidon, and perhaps by the cult locality, for close to the cave at Phigalia, was the fount of a cold water stream. Moreover, Artemis Lusia or Thermia at Lusoi in all likelihood exercises functions similar to those of Demeter Lusia at Thelpusa: functions which probably derive from chthonic and general vegetation cult. The chthonic origin, however, only partly accounts for the presence of the horse, or for that of the other animals, snakes, doves, 'P.-W. Suppl. VIII s. v. *Erinys4 96. 2 Paus. 8, I4, 5. Cf.

Again, an explanation of this problem may reveal itself in an Arcadian cult of Artemis at Lycosura. Artemis, particularly in Arcadia, but probably in other parts of Greece also, had many affinities with the Great Goddesses, and these are most evident in the Demeter Despoina cult at Lycosura, Arcadia. Here was a famous sanctuary of Despoina, also thought to be Poseidon's daughter as in Thelpusa and Phigalia as was clearly shown by the altar of Poseidon Hippius situated above the grove 1. The most interesting feature of the sanctuary is the acrolithic group described by Pausanias2 who names as its sculptor the Messenian artist Demo- phon 3. Depicted on it is Demeter carrying a torch in her right hand, her left resting on Despoina who in turn is holding a sceptre and carrying the cista on her knees, supporting it with her right hand. On Demeter's side stands Artemis wearing a deerskin and a quiver on her shoulder, in one hand the torch and in the other two snakes. Beside her a hunting dog is lying down, while on the side of Despoina Anytus is represented in armour. A number of fragments of this statuary have been preserved, chiefly by the Greek excavations at the end of the last century. Among the most notable is the veil which belonged either to Despoina or Demeter. On it are shown a number of figures with animal heads or possibly masks4 performing a dance, which calls to mind the Kidaris5, probably in honour of Demeter Kidaria at Pheneus in Arcadia 6, another closely related chthonic type of goddess. Furthermore, these figures-particularly one of a female figure with the head of a horse-distinctly call to mind the image of Demeter Melaina. Also significant in this connexion are the two snakes in the hand of the Artemis statue at Lycosura . The question arises what the significance of the animals may be, not only of the horse-for that was partially due to the Poseidon association-but also of the snakes, the dove, and dolphin in the hands of the Phigalian image, and the other beasts about her head. The answer may be found in Demeter's asso- ciation with Artemis which came about through her functions as a promoter, or perhaps representative, of vegetation and life with all that implies. Indeed, the link imagined in this particular instance is evident from the dress and attributes of Artemis in the Lycosura group. She is wearing a deerskin, and in her hands she holds the quiver, while at her feet lies the huntsman's dog. She 1 Paus. 8, 37, 9; IO- 2 8, 37, 3f. 3 For a discussion of the date of the sculptor and therefore of the sculpture, at one time believed to have been of the fourth century, see FRAZER in his ed. of Paus. on 8, 37, 3.

DIETRICH is akin to the Minoan Potnia Theron to whom Artemis was connected with many strong ties'. Of course, no conclusive evidence is extant to explain the common bond of Artemis and Demeter at Lycosura. However, it is reasonable to suppose-to judge from the animals on Demeter's or Despoina's veil-that Demeter possesses functions here which approach those of Artemis as Mistress of Animals 2. Such an association would go a long way to account for the nature of Demeter and Erinys in the Phigalian and Thelpusan cults discussed above. Demeter's claim to a connexion with the figure of the Potnia Theron, moreover, is strengthened by the find of several votive offerings to Demeter as well as Persephone in the form of terracotta statuettes representing draped women with the heads of cows, sheep, and other animals 3. The sacrifice performed at Lycosura and described by Pausanias4 recalls a similar type of sacrifice in honour of the Mistress of Animals 5, an example of which can be seen on an Boeotian fibula in the Louvre, and on a Boeotian geometric vase 6 both depicting the goddess surrounded by complete animals and severed limbs 7. All the evidence points to a unity of Demeter and Artemis in this capacity, and Erinys, the horse shaped, in Boeotia. Therefore the latter cannot be really said to have assumed the shape of a horse, in order to establish an alliance with Poseidon; and perhaps some confirmation of this can be found in the name Arion, the horse that sprang from the alliance and which was so completely absorbed in mythology. A number of derivations of the word 'AeEdwcov have been proposed none of which is necessarily conclusive. The most attractive, however, is that derived from 'Eetvvg; and this appears to be strengthened by the find in Thelpusa of some fourth century coins on which the name is written 'Eetotv8. 1 See NILSSON, Op. cit.

The connexion in</page><page sequence="13">Demeter, Erinys, Artemis I4I Although the horse born to Demeter in Thelpusa appears as a somewhat alien feature, the reason for the Poseidon alliance very probably goes back to the same source in the Boeotian as well as the Arcadian cult, namely that of vege- tation or more generally of the chthonic functions of earth deities. We have noted a probable source for the manifold animals in the Arcadian cults and traced it to an aspect related to the Mistress of Animals. It is only natural that identical elements should be found in the Erinys cult. Firstly, the two animals that recurred most commonly in the Erinys cult were the horse and the snake, both of whom have frequently been put forward as representing the original form or symbol, as it were, of the Erinys or Erinyes. The evidence for neither theory, however, is particularly convincing, although one or two strong points emerge. The shape of Demeter Erinys has been made to serve as an ex- ample of the early horse form of Erinys1, but the many associations with the Arcadian Demeter and with Poseidon Hippius do not allow a definite conclu- sion to be drawn, while on the other hand, as noticed above, they vouch for the close connexion of the horse with the Erinys cult. Most of the other evidence has been based, rather sanguinely, on allusions in Homer and the tragedianS2 mythology is clear, but cannot be assumed for the beginning of the figure, certainly not on the evidence of Quintus Smyrnaeus who makes Erinys bear four horses to Boreas with whom Ares goes to battle (8, 243). In any case this legend would seem to have a more plausible explanation in the alliance of Erinys with the wind god. Notwithstanding these objections, this theory had previously found a few supporters on the strength of two other points (a) the assumed association with the Erinyes on the Areopagus (GRUPPE, Gr. Myth. u. Rel. II 764 n. I), because of Ares' sanctuary there close to the images of Enyo, Heracles, Theseus, Apollo, and others (Paus. I, 8, 4), and (b) the myth quoted by the scholiast on Soph. Antig. I26 that the Tilphossan Erinys bore a dragon to Ares. MANNHARDT, Mythol. Forsch. 252 ('Aeseiov = nickname for 'AQeiog which = dedicated to Ares), among others, supposes this origin for Arion the fighting horse. The argument against this supposition rests chiefly on the nature of the god Ares who was ranked among the Olympians by Homer only. Yet this is true also of other divinities of greater import. Coupled with this, however, is the shadowy existence Ares probably had in popular imagination before Homer, and the paucity of cults, which again is not conclusive on its own. But the com- parative absence of cult offerings or inscriptions, has led scholars to doubt whether Ares figures in popular religion at all, and whether he did not owe the few cults he had to epic influence, see NILSSON, op. cit. I 5I7-5i9. Nevertheless a rich stock of myth was attached to his figure, as can be expected, so that it may not cause much surprise that the horse Arion, so frequently recurring in time of war in Theban legend, should have become associated with him. It can hardly be doubted, though, that an original connexion between Arion and Ares did not exist beyond the similarity in names. For a detailed discussion of the numerous derivations of Arion with all relevant sources, see WtST, OP. cit. 97f. 1 See EITREM, D. g6ttl. Zwill. 62, who mentions the Demeter Erinys of Thelpusa, although the Tilphossan Erinys would certainly have been more apposite. Cf. KRAPPE, Rh. Mus. 8I, 1932, 315 Iff., who also calls the horse a 'Todesdamon'. 2 Not counting EITREM'S proposal, ibid., that Colonus Hippius, the scene of an im- portant Erinys cult, should afford proof of this theory, see WtST, P.-W. Suppl. VIII 92.</page><page sequence="14">I42 BERNARD C. DIETRICH which in some instances are quite vague I. On the other hand, two outstanding scholars who assume the original form of the Erinys to have been that of a snake are Miss HARRISON 2, and KUSTER 3. Their arguments, however, are mainly based on the assumption that the Erinyes were the souls of the dead in primitive belief 4 which has in no way been conclusively shown. The remaining evidence comes from Aeschylus and Euripides 5 and this cannot be anything but Aeschy- lus' own influence 6, and that of the later art forms. We cannot deny the possi- bility that the Erinyes originally may have been thought of in the shape of some animal associated with their cult; indeed, to judge from the important part played by the horse shape of the Tilphossan Erinys, it is likely that the goddess was closely associated with and occasionally appeared as an animal, rather than that this aspect of her should have been due primarily to Arcadian influence. No evidence hitherto brought to light, however, is conclusive, even though the figures on the veil of Despoina or Demeter, whether they are wearing masks or not do seem to represent a certain stage of evolution from a theriomorphic conception. The most that can be said is that the association of certain animals, particularly the snake and the horse, qualify some original func- tion of the goddesses. The snake could stand for certain chthonic qualities7 and it was also the symbol of fertility8. So too the horse would indirectly stand for fertility and general vegetation 9, as perhaps for the soul in popular belief 10, and on analogy with the Etruscan cults, the horse did come to be thought of as an agent of death"1. Thus it has been compared with the Indian and Germanic horse daemons (Acvins, Valcyri) that exercised the same power and stood for deities of inescapable Fate, death 2.

It is in this figure of the Ho'Tvta that Demeter, Erinys, Artemis, and Despoina find a common bond. Indeed this bond often connects these deities so closely that scholars have at times been misled into identifying them2. Of course, the best known aspect in Greek religion of Ho'vta is that of Mistress of Animals, as which she is usually identified with Artemis 3. There are extant, however, some notices which may give evidence of ancient cults of a TIo'rvta or the Horvtat. In fact, the Io' rvwat were identified with Demeter and Kore in Athens 4. The same applied to their two cult localities (a) in Boeotia, and (b) on the peninsula Mycale in Asia Minor 5. The plural Ho'-rvtat is paralleled by the Aazlovat which also is used to describe the figures of Demeter and Kore. The Agrdotvat had a cult in Olympia6, and they occur in an inscription from Cyzicus 7. It is only because of Despoina's affinity with Demeter, however, that she occurs in the plural number representing that goddess and Kore; more often, of course, Despoina retains her separate identity. This becomes clear from notices of cult which describe offerings made to Despoina, Demeter and Persephone; or to Despoina, Demeter and Artemis at Lycosura8. In the case of Potnia, however, it seems clear that she tended to become identified with Demeter and in particular with the Erinyes 9. USENER10 claims that in Athens the later name of Semnae was given to the Potniae who were revered in the sanctuary close by the Areopagus. Whether this claim, that this was a more recent collective title of both the Eleusinian deities and the Eume- nides at Athens, can be accepted, is still debatable, especially since he supposes this to have taken place after the middle of the third century 11. In some measure, however, USENER already remarks on the close connexion, if not identity, of Despoina, Potnia and the Eleusinian deities. It must be made quite clear at this stage that as yet there exists little definite knowledge regarding Potnia's early history. Indeed, the word 7o'Tvta in Greek literature is usually no more than a common poetical epithet which 1 With the veil at Lycosura compare the winged goddess on a vase in 'Bucchero nero' in the Ashmolean Museum, Ashm.

On the other hand, Ho'rvta, lIolrvcat, as has been seen above2 served as cult epithets of Demeter, Kore, and of the Erinyes at Athens. The Potniae were identified with Demeter and Kore and perhaps even with Artemis 3. It is not impossible that there existed a pre-Greek goddess con- cerned with nature who was at some time given the Greek name of IlHo-vta, and who exercised functions similar to those of Demeter and in certain respects- e.g. as Mistress of Animals-to those of Artemis. But it has yet to be decided whether such a goddess would be of Cretan extraction 4, or whether she came to Crete from Asia5. Certain aspects, then, of Potnia or the Potniae related them closely to De- meter, Artemis and Erinys. The same holds true in the case of Despoina, a figure that also occasionally appears in the plural6 when connected with the Eleusinian deities. Despoina's close relationship with Demeter and Erinys is particularly evident from the part she plays in the Arcadian Demeter Erinys cult. Despoina's connexion with Artemis, especially in Arcadia, is well known 7, in fact it has at times led scholars into the error of calling these two figures identical 8, because Despoina and Artemis, as well as Demeter, are frequently 1 See P.-W. 'Potnia' (KRUSE) Ii86f. for examples. 2 Cf. also P.-W. ibid. 3 Compare e.g. the Demeter cult in Potniae, Boeotia - Paus. 9, 8, I f.; and see NILSSON, Gesch. I I I9; 15 I with sources; cf. the description in FRAZER'S ed. of Pausanias ad loc. For further connexions between Demeter, Artemis and Potnia, see NILSSON, Op. cit. I 480 f. NILSSON, ibid., believes that this concept of Demeter is older than that of Artemis. Perhaps this old association of these two goddesses gave rise to the genealogy which makes Artemis a daughter of Demeter, Aesch. in Paus. 9, 37, 6; compare Herod. 2, I56, who makes Deme- ter = Isis and Artemis = Bubastis. 4 PICARD, Les rel. pr6h. 78; 245. 5 PICARD, OP. cit. 78, already notes the similarity between the Asiatic Isthar and Pot- nia. There does not yet exist an exhaustive discussion of the figure of Potnia. Since the Linear B script has been deciphered in recent years, the name noTvta (po-ti-ni-j a) has been found on a number of Minoan tablets. The striking fact is that in the majority of instances this word stands alone, and not in association with other deities. Once it is found together with what might be the equivalent of Athene, M. VENTRIS - J. CHADWICK, Documents in Mycenaean Greek, Three Hundred Selected Tablets from Knossos, Pylos and Mycenae with Commentary and Vocabulary, Cambridge I956, KN V 52, I, a-ta-na- po-ti-ni-ja. It has been suggested, however, that a-ta-na represents the genitive of a cult place, L. R. PALMER, 'Minoan Linear B Seminar', Institute of Classical Studies, London 7th November I956 (see also J. CHADWICK, 'Potnia', Minos 5, 1958, fasc. 2, I17-I29). So far, unfortunately, one can draw only few conclusions from what has been found, and it must remain doubtful wether CHADWICK'S ibid., belief in Potnia = a 'manifestation of the pre-Olympic mother goddess' can be substantiated. One fragment, however, No. 1206 may possibly refer to an Asian Potnia (in E. L. BENNETT, The Olive Oil Tablets of Pylos, texts of inscriptions found, I955, Suplementos a Minos Ndim. 2, Universidad de Salamanca, I958, 45).

This is also apparent in the Arcadian Lycosura where Despoina, Demeter and Artemis meet in cult. Fur- thermore, this particular cult affords a clear indication that it is the figure of the Mistress of Animals that provides the bond which mutually unites the goddesses: not only Despoina, Potnia, Artemis and Demeter, but also the figure of Erinys. In fact, this natural relationship-apart from Eleusinian influence2-was responsible for Despoina's genealogical connexion with Deme- ter and Erinys in Phigalia and Thelpusa, although it produced the odd incon- sistencies mentioned above. The first striking similarity between the Erinys cult and that at Lycosura is the sanctity of the pomegranate, the only tree fruit not used on either oc- casion 3. Next, the hunting Artemis holds two snakes in one hand. This animal allies her not only to the Phigalian figure, but also to the Erinys since it played a significant part in this type of chthonic cult. An important animal, too, of the Mistress of Animals was the bird, often depicted together with the goddess in art, which is the best source for comparisons between her and certain interesting aspects of the Erinyes. Indeed, the Mistress of Animals is very frequently shown with wings herself, as can be seen from a number of representations of Potnia to be discussed below. Of special interest in this connexion is the figure of a winged goddess holding birds, lions and other animals shown on votive offerings which are mostly in the form of ivory plaques or lead figurines which date from the beginning of the eighth century onwards. A great number of these have been uncovered in Sparta, but examples have also been found throughout the Greek mainland, as well as in Italy, on some Aegean islands- e.g. Thera and Rhodes-and in Asia Minor4. This goddess obviously is a Mistress of Animals 5, and THOMPSON identifies her with Artemis and the figure of Artemis Orthia in particular. Certainly, Artemis' domination of the animal world may well have been an important feature of her Spartan cult6; but whether it was here that this winged 'Mistress' first occurred in Greece, is another matter which it is difficult to decide without further evidence; and so is the problem of her provenance-it is sufficient for our purposes to notice that she shows traces of Eastern as well as Minoan influence 7. Of greater interest at present is the fact that this goddess shows an affinity with that aspect of Artemis which is 1 Cf. USENER, Op. cit. 223. 2 See above p. I31. 3 Philostrat. Imag. 384 (KAYSER), I7ff.; in Lycosura Paus. 8, 37, 4, and the explana- tion in Paus. 9, 25, I, when it grows on the tomb of Menoeceus in Boeotia. 4These figures have been excellently discussed by M. S. THOMPSON in his article on 'The Asiatic or Winged Artemis' J. H. S. 29, 1909, 286ff. 6 Occassionally the votive offerings consist only of animals, such as a horse, lion, goat, or fish, see THOMPSON, Op. cit. fig. 9. 6 Cf. the winged Artemis holding a leopard and a lion on the Cypselus Chest, Paus. 5, 19, 5. HARRISON, Prolegomena, 266, does not believe that one can identify this 'Mistress' with Artemis. 7 See THOMPSON, ibid. Hermes 90,2 10</page><page sequence="18">I46 BERNARD C. DIETRICH concerned with founts and general vegetation, a fact which becomes apparent not only from the frequent occurrence of water birds-e.g. swans-on the pla- ques cited by Thompson, but especially from the significant part played by the horse here which was discussed above. THOMPSON points out that this 'Mistress' tends to lose her wings in art during about the fifth and sixth centuries, so that the original winged type was often forgotten 1. Apart from these eighth to sixth century plaques, we possess a number of other representations of this Mistress- shown with or occasionally without wings-which also helps to connect her with the figure of Erinys. The archaic type of Potnia can be seen on a Boeotian geometric vase2, significant, as mentioned before 3, because of the severed animal limbs. A typical development can be seen in another Potnia on a Rhodian plate4. Here the goddess has wings, unlike the Boeotian example; furthermore she wears a Gor- gon mask, important because it immediately brings her into close relationship with the type of earth deities which are almost identical with the Erinyes". The wings, too, must have encouraged association with another figure-more familiar in connexion with the Erinys-the Snatcher, or Harpy, and the wind daemon. Two well known representations, both dealing with the slaying of the Gor- gon, bring out this relationship clearly. One is on an archaic Boeotian vase in the Louvre6 showing Perseus beheading the Gorgon. The interesting fact is that the Gorgon is shown with the trunk of a horse and the torso of a woman with the Gorgon head, displaying clearly once more the chthonic capacity of that animal. The second is a design on another vase in the Vienna Museum 7, where the Gorgon woman with wings on back and ankles, attached to the hunting boots, is seen clasping a snake in both hands, and presumably about to be slain by Perseus with the assistance of Athene in full armour, and a nymph 8. Now, this winged Gorgon type or Snatcher appears in art quite frequently in bird form, as Siren for instance or Sphinx9, or even in human form, as on the sixth century black figure amphora in the Vatican Museum 10, and on fragments found in the Acro- polis excavations". The popular conception of the winged Snatcher, and the Gorgon type with snake, may have helped to shape the Erinyes for the tragic 1 Cf. Pausanias' confession - 5, 19, 5 - that he cannot explain why the Artemis on the Cypselus Chest should be shown with wings. 2 NILSSON, Gesch. I, Taf. 30, 3. 3 See above p. I40. 4 NILSSON, op. cit.

The winged female figure, at times with the Gorgon head, a Harpy, perhaps also the Bird Woman, the Sphinx, or to a certain extent probably the Siren, may be traced back to a figure, such as the Mistress of Animals, a type akin to Artemis, as she appeared in Lycosura for instance2. The Erinyes, too, manifested similar characteristics mainly through their identity with the wind daemons and the Harpies. Indeed the figure of the horse-because of its importance in the concept of the Harpies, wind daemons, and the Erinyes 3-played a consistently noticeable role in relating them to one another, particularly in later versions of the Arion myth, and in legends derived from the myth. The story of the birth of Achilles' horses from Zephyrus and a Harpy 4, is well known, and their myth has much in common with that of Arion 5, whose mother in later versions is believed to have been a Harpy6. The literary evidence supporting the harmony between these agents is fairly plentiful, but outside Aeschylus mostly late', and can only attest that still on the level of bogeys the Erinyes8 retained this strong link with the powers that seized their prey while roaming in the air above the earth9. This concept of the swooping down on their prey of these destructive agents'0 is not confined strictly to Greek religion but finds an analogy in the German Valcyri and Idisi, the Gallic Cathubodua, the Irish Badb, and the Indian Kheacaric ". 1 Aeschylus likened them to the Gorgon, but made them wingless: Eum. 48 f.; 5I; 250; Choeph. Io48ff. 2 Occasionally a snake is shown with the winged Mistress of Animals: - e. g. on a Boeotian coffer from Thebes (7th cent.) FURTWANGLER, Ant. Gemm. pp. 39f.; on an ivory plaque from Sparta, THOMPSON, Op. Cit. 288 fig. 3; on the handle of a bronze bowl from Graeschwyl (6th cent.), A. BERTRAND, Arch6ologie celtique et gauloise2, i889, PP. 333ff. HARRISON, J. H. S. I9, I899, 2 I9, is wrong when she says that the Erinyes took their wings from the es&amp;o2ov which was always thought winged. 3 See for instance Quint. Smyrn. 8, 242f. - Boreas and Erinys are the parents of the four horses of Ares.

DIETRICH, Demeter, Erinys, Artemis In conclusion we can state the following findings from a discussion of the ar- chaic and difficult Demeter Erinys cults in Arcadia. Demeter Erinys in Arcadia as well as the related Erinys in Tilphusa, Boeotia, emerge as chthonic deities concerned with vegetation in general and with water in particular. Corrobora- tive evidence of this is furnished by the important part played by the horse in these cults. Indeed, the horse is such a vital element in the myths that surround Demeter and Erinys in Tilphusa, Thelpusa as well as in Phigalia, that these goddesses have at times been supposed-and this has been claimed especially strongly for Arcadia-originally to have had the shape of a horse before becoming anthropomorphic. Unfortunately this cannot be substantiated beyond doubt; on the other hand, the presence of the horse possibly points to the chthonic nature of Demeter Erinys, and certainly to her connexion with water. Furthermore, the horse provides a useful link between this aspect of Demeter and the type of Artemis we meet with at Lusoi -also connected with water-and the Mistress of Animals as we have met her on a number of pendant type ornaments on which she is associated with the horse. In fact, it is the function of Mistress of Animals-the HoIrvta &amp;4QCo&amp;v-which relates this type of Demeter with Artemis and Despoina in the interesting cult at Lycosura. In this connexion, too, this 'Mistress' is an illuminating guide to a little known part of Erinys' early history, in which the latter is on a common level with other de- structive agents, like the Harpies and the Sirens. The cult epithet Potniae of the Erinyes-Eumenides at Athens suggests that the latter at one time may have exercised functions related to those of the Ho-rvta &amp;qeC6v, especially if we are to judge by numerous art representations where both figures have often a closely resembling appearance and the same attributes. It is important, then, to bear in mind that in the Demeter and Erinys cults in Arcadia and Boeotia we have some evidence of an early type of Erinys which differs from that com- monly found in the tragedians of Erinys = avenging spirit of crimes committed within a family and particularly against a mother. Scholars have often assumed this to have constituted Erinys' original function (see e.g. above p. I42), and in support of their claim they cite Homer Il. 9, 57I and Od. II, 280. It must be remembered, however, that of the twelve instances when Eetv'g occurs in Homer only six distinctly refer to Eetvv'g as a curse or vengeance within a family. In the other six instances Erinys is seen as exercising functions which are at times incompatible with those she has in Greek tragedy. In fact, the part the Erinyes play in the Pandareus myth ' may well hint at an early association of the Erinyes with the Harpies. Mona BERNARD C.
