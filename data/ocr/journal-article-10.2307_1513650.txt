He fills a gap in our col- lection of Bellange's rare and much-sought-after oeuvre.

Classical themes and images fill Carpioni's work-both his paintings and etchings. No Venetian artist could be unaware of the early paintings of Titian, the "Bacchanals." Although these were no longer in Venice in the early seventeenth century, the compositions of the paintings were available in etchings of the late 1630s by Giovanni Andrea Podesti. The etchings of the Roman Pietro Testa, who worked in the circle of Nicolas Poussin, the greatest classical painter of the century, were also well known to Carpioni. As in Titian's painting The Offering to Venus (Prado, Madrid), which Car- pioni had copied in painting, Testa's prints were filled to over- flowing with putti gamboling among classical statuary and monuments. Carpioni's etching technique, however, owed much more to his contemporary the painter-etcher Simone Cantarini, in the delicacy of the line and the clean, crisp sparkle of white paper. Phyllis Massar has suggested another artist whose influence on Carpioni can be seen in relation espe- cially to our etching; the Genoese Giovanni Battista Casti- glione filled his etchings with antique vases, statues, satyrs, and nymphs (Massar, P. D. "Giulio Carpioni: Light Classical Overture" [unpublished article]: 7). Among the bacchanalian subjects he etched in the 1640s are two with Pan and/or satyrs reclining against classical statuary (a herm or a vase). Both compositions are horizontal in format, as is our etching by Carpioni, who etched another bacchanalian scene with young musical putti and satyrs that, although somewhat smaller, is probably a pendant to ours. Although Carpioni drew from the work of all these artists, he alone set his putti and satyrs danc- ing to music. Music-making putti and satyrs are, of course, drawn from antique sources and were not new in Italian art, but only Carpioni among the seventeenth-century print- makers discussed here added the charm and grace of music to his scenes.

Though less well known today than his brothers Gabriel and Augustin, Charles-Germain was reputedly a "tres galant" favorite of Mme de Pompadour, who ordered special paints from China for him and made him gifts of porcelain fromJapan. Charles-Germain's son-in-law described him as witty, satir- ical, and given to making caustic remarks. The album of cari- catures he left, including drawings of Richelieu in the guise of a monkey and the Prince of Soubise as an ass, demonstrate the anthropomorphic turn his satire often took. --i)Jr ; 47'f -^ r^ W ; * +. w . 51</page><page sequence="3">There are less than thirty known etchings from this St.- Aubin's hand, and these are almost equally divided between the subjects of flowers and fanciful butterflies. In two sets of etchings called Papillonneries Humaines, St.-Aubin made fun of human frailty by showing insects in the pursuit of popular pastimes. The social butterflies play amid latticework, gar- lands, and other wedding-cake decorations styled after Wat- teau and Pillement. The suite of six etchings the Museum recently acquired in- cludes a peek into the dressing room of a "lady," who is coif- fed by one maidservant, as another heats curling irons with sun rays. A cleric is seated nearby, elbow propped on the dress- ing table while he reads, probably to inspire madame. Other plates in our set mimic a duel, an outdoor ballet, the French theater, and the Italians' commedia dell'arte. The title page displays attributes of folly and vanity encircling a pyramid that is surmounted by a rat. In 1924, when Francois Courboin, then curator of prints at the Bibliotheque Nationale in Paris, wrote a history of French engraving, he declared these etchings works "of great rarity." We know of only two other complete sets in this country, and not more than that abroad. Our lively impressions were printed before St.-Aubin's name was replaced with that of a publisher, Fessard.

EUGENE EMMANUEL VIOLLET-LE-DUC French, 1814-1879 PERSPECTIVE SECTION OF A VENETIAN PALACE Drawing, pen and brush with grayed ink, 93/4 x 13 /4" (24.6 x 33.6 cm). Purchase, Anne Stern Gift. 1982.1152 ne of the most exciting results of the exhibitions staged in 1979-80 to commemorate the death of Eugene Em- manuel Viollet-le-Duc was an introduction for many of us to his drawings. These really beautiful works had been unknown in America because most of them are in European collections. When these were reproduced in his many books on architec- ture they had been reduced to spidery black lines without their original colors and tones. The original drawings are eye-openers to the generations of American students conditioned to dismiss Viollet-le-Duc as a Romantic architectural restorer with little respect for archae- ological accuracy. He was also known to us as the author of an enervating ten-volume historical dictionary of early French architecture. Now, thanks to the well-illustrated publications connected with the centennial exhibitions, we see that his studies of buildings and ruins in France, Italy, and Switzerland (they run the gamut from meticulous pencil renderings of or- namental sculptural details, through architectural construc- tions, to finished watercolor and gouache perspective views) are as archaeologically correct as any photograph. Whether they are exteriors filled with Italian sunlight and strong shadows, or dim enclosures of vast, mysterious ecclesiastical space, there is never anything ambiguous about the architec- ture. Although of prodigious detail, sometimes including a de- lineation of every brick or stone, the buildings Viollet-le-Duc drew are complete entities: they are seen as architecture should be-as structures, before the details are noticed. Viollet-le-Duc the architect is still relatively unknown. He did indeed start as a restorer, a natural beginning for a young art student living in the Tuilleries Palace because his father, a conservator of royal residences, had the title "Gouverneur au Palais des Tuilleries." The young artist studied with the ar- I chitect Huve and later with Achille Leclere; before studying at the Ecole des Beaux-Arts, Viollet-le-Duc traveled through France studying buildings and making drawings. In 1836 and 1837 he was in Italy and, ecstatic about Venice, wrote home that, although he had studied Palladio, now that he was con- fronted with Palladian buildings he was bored. Further, he found Sansovino and Vignola a melange of antique and Rococo-cold and without character. Toward the end of his life, in 1871, Viollet-le-Duc was again in Venice, and he may have made sketches that led to our drawing, which he had ap- parently planned to use as a book illustration, since he labeled it COURS D'ARCHITECTURE, PL.

Gift of Lila Acheson Wallace. 1983.1009 atisse worked onJazz in his seventies-at an age that often signals the end of an artist's creativity, the slacken- ing of artistic production, and the loss of the urge to experi- ment with new artistic methods. This was not Matisse's case. Faced with the limitations of illness and old age, he turned to an exploration of cut paper. Why cut paper? Matisse realized that the action of cutting shapes from colored sheets of paper united drawing and the use of color in one movement; as such, the cutouts represent the culmination of a lifetime of artistic investigation. Jazz documents the vitality of Matisse's experimentation. The twenty boldly colored plates were made from an equal number of the new paper cutouts, or decoupages. To preserve the flat and uneven quality of the colored papers and the vib- rancy of the "drawn" line created by the precise meeting of colors, Matisse turned to pochoir, a printmaking process in- 52 .,</page><page sequence="4">volving the use of stencils. It was quite daring to use pochoir, which was not accepted in artistic circles; it was the process fa- vored by fashion and design publishers for book illustration. While the vibrant colors and shapes do have the vitality of jazz music, the title most likely refers to the French verb "to gab." Matisse provided a rambling commentary for the book; like the autobiographical reminiscences of one's grandfather, the plates and text recall the shapes and events of Matisse's work and life and combine them in a new and even more exuberant form that is one of the great illustrated books of our century. DWK The title is poetic and abstract rather than specific. The na- tional symbol, the eagle, grips with its talons, and the space voyages, if not always literally made at night, arejourneys into darkness. The print, the only one Rauschenberg made in 1966, was done for the New Lincoln School, which Rauschen- berg's son Christopher was attending at the time.

Singer 1982.1154.1 ight Grip is a typical Rauschenberg work of the 1960s, using superimposed images that relate to reality in dif- ferent ways. Since 1962 Rauschenberg had been using photo- graphs in his paintings and prints; in fact, the bald eagle used here can be spotted in paintings of 1963 and 1964. The photo- graphs, mostly from contemporary magazines, are ready- made images that already are a number of things: real objects, works of art, depictions of something, and symbols for an event or series of events. The photographic images in Night Grip -the bald eagle, the ocean, the lunar landing module, the various spacecraft with their relative dimensions and their voyages named from classical mythology-now exist in a new juxtaposition and are subordinate to the new work of art. They also coexist with shapes that are holes or tears in paper and others made with hand-drawn lines. Rauschenberg began this work by making a collage taped to the back of an en- velope; its metal fastener can be seen to the left of the eagle. 3 I- I uf 1 -. . . * 53</page><page sequence="5">York, which was begun in 1957 by Tatyana Grosman and flourished under her direction until her death last year.

L.83.11 (1-101) he transformation of San Francisco from a sparsely settled outpost into a regional hub was spurred by the 1849 Gold Rush. The city's period of early vigorous growth coincided exactly with the rise of photography and with the presence in California of Carleton E. Watkins, one of the most significant talents in the history of photography. Only this year, long after several of his contemporaries were so acknowledged, has Watkins become the subject of a monographic exhibition in an art museum. He became the subject of serious research as the result of the Museum's 1975 exhibition Era of Exploration: The Rise of Landscape Photog- raphy in the American West, 1860-1885, in which his photo- graphs were seen for the first time in the context of work by Timothy O'Sullivan, Eadweard Muybridge, A.J. Russell, and William H.Jackson. Watkins's photographs stood out for their B subtlety rather than for their drama or two-dimensional de- signs; his carpenter-like compositions were built on a network of relationships between foreground and background and sur- face elements. His style was, to a surprising degree for his time, free of the literal-minded references to the painter's rulebook found in many contemporary "art" photographs. Watkins became an artist of the camera by observing his sub- jects closely and by following extremely thoughtful proce- dures to make his pictures. In addition to being a significant artistic accomplishment, the Bernard album is also an important historical document. The photographs are a survey of some of the principal towns and cities of California, along with landscapes of central California and western Nevada. In these often remote loca- tions Watkins distinguished himself by having the patience to wait for the perfect light and to prospect for the point of view that, for his camera, would most successfully reveal the sub- ject. Watkins had more productive years than most of his con- temporaries. He began to photograph in the mid-1850s and continued doing so until the 1890s, with the most fertile dec- ade between 1867 and 1877. The photographs commissioned by Charles Bernard for his brother date from 1875 to 1877 and represent Watkins at the height of his classicizing phase, just before he took a more reportorial direction. In this work the photographer is still touched by the pantheistic vision of na- ture as the handiwork of a perfect creator and demonstrates his belief that the photographer had unique power to depict the divine order of nature.
