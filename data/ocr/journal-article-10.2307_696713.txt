<plain_text><page sequence="1">DILL'S ROMAN SOCIETY. Roman Society from NVero to Marcus Aurelius. By SAMUEL DILL, M.A. Macmillan. Pp. xxii + 639. Price 15s. net. IT will be seen from the title of this im- portant work that it does not, in point of time, quite join on to Dr. Dill's earlier study of Roman affairs, his Roman Society in the Last Century of the Western Empire. There is room for an intermediate volume, and we hope that some day Dr. Dill will give it to us. In the meanwhile, what is the plan of his present work? This is divided into four books. It is not altogether easy to make out what links bind the four together, or bind the contents of some of the books singly ; but, so far as we can see, Books I, II deal with Social Life; III with the Philo- sophic Director; and IV with the Revival of Paganism. Books I and II differ in that I handles 'the worst of [Roman] society, whether crushed by the tyranny of the Caesars or corrupted and vulgarized by sudden elevation from ignominious poverty to wealth and luxury,' while Book IJ ' will reveal a different life' because 'there were great numbers, both among the nobles and the masses, who maintained the traditions of old Roman soberness and virtue.' The chapters of the First Book deal with The Aristocracy under the Terror, The World of the Satirist, and The Society of the Freedmen. The Second Book, looking most at the happier days inaugurated by Nerva, takes up The Circle of the Younger Pliny-that is to say, well-to-do and culti- vated men, who lived now in Rome, now on their estates-Municipal Life, with its cul- tivated or uncultivated freedmen, its petty ambitions, its generous gifts to fellow- citizens; and Plebeian Life in many parts of the Roman world, under which head we find much to read about collegia, whether they were for social, religious, or business purposes. To Books III and IV we shall return presently. It must be clear from the head- ings of chapters already quoted that these studies might be made to mean or cover either much or little. Dr. Dill makes them mean much, and the chapters deal very fully with their respective subjects, and even contain in many cases more than they di- rectly promise. The work is as thorough and solid as readers would expect who know the companion volume. But the arrange- ment of the books and chapters is not per- haps quite an ideal one, and it leads to some overlapping. Book 1. c. 3 and Book II. c. 3 are not very sharply distinguishable in topic; and even within the limits of one chapter cases of overlapping or repetition may be found, as on p. 2 compared with p. 6, or on p. 597 compared with p. 604. Apart from this drawback, one which is hard to exclude where wide and far-reach- ing matters are concerned, the author's style is agreeable, smooth, and yet unmonotonous and well fitted to keep up the attention of his readers. This stout volume is not ex- actly one which will, like the Stoic books known to Horace, lie about on ladies' sofas or dressing-tables; but it is as readable as such topics can be made. The literature and history of long-dead peoples can never be studied without an effort; but the effort is here made an easy one. The treatment is not repellent: we see always where we are going, and very soon learn confidence in our guide. A large part of the book too is taken up by what we may call essays on the views and surroundings of the authors of the age: each comes up in turn; and this</page><page sequence="2">132 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. method of treatment relieves the strain of tary questions, at least so far as the compo- study, and divides the whole into natural sition of the armies goes: these things need sections.

Nowhere is the divergence of different strata of society more striking than in religious matters. As it is in the United Kingdom at the present moment (Jan. 1905), so was it in ancient Italy and, more or less, throughout the contemporary world. 'We are amazed at the prolongation for ages of religious ideas which the Roman mind might appear to have outgrown. . . The masses were probably never so superstitious as in the second century ... And the singular thing is that the influx of foreign religions, due to the wide conquests of Rome, never to the end seems to have shaken the supreme attachment of the people to their ancient gods. . . A more difficult problem is presented by the attitude of the cultivated class to the old mythologies.' It is a most curious picture of the re- ligious world which Dr. Dill draws for us in his Book IV. The Antonine Age was ' an age of spiritual contradictions. On the one hand, not only was the old ritual of classical poly- theism scrupulously observed even by men like Plut- arch and M. Aurelius, but religious imagination was appropriating the deities of every province [the Jews 1], almost of every canton, embraced by the Roman power. At the same time the fecundity of superstition created hosts of new divinities and genii who peopled every scene of human life. On the other hand, syncretism was in the air. Amid all the confused fervour of devotion a certain principle of unity and comprehension was asserting itself, even in popular religion.' From this bird's-eye view, as well as from the closer study, Dr. Dill excludes Judaism and Christianity-and perhaps he is wise; but even without those elements of discord, the subject is sufficiently compli- cated, full of cross-currents, and obscured by the coexistence of many different re- ligious levels or standpoints. The grossest superstition, anthropomorphism, and magic, stand side by side with scepticism and with the efforts of the highest thought of the age to keep within the established, or some established, religious framework and yet make a reasonable scheme. The lower stages too at that time did not hide them- selves as they do now-a-days. We know something, and suspect more, of strange survivals of religious belief or practice in Great Britain and in other progressive Western nations; but in Rome it was not necessary to suspect: men could see most of what went on. There was little need of disguise, in or out of Rome. Druidism, magic, and Christianity were dangerous to touch and therefore obscure; but, apart from these, most kinds of belief or practice were absolutely open and often energetically pushed in the capital, while in the provinces an Arcadian thought it no shame to beat his god, or an Egyptian to keep up the divine honours of animals. Through the labyrinth of this subject our author finds his way largely by one clue. He is strongly impressed by the idea of a religious and moral reform then on foot. 'Maximus of Tyre, along with Plutarch, shows us paganism at its best, striving to reform itself, grasping after new sources of spiritual strength, trying to wed new and purer spiritual ideals to the worn-out mythology of the past' (p. 349). ' It is one great object of this book to show how the later Stoicism and the new Platonism, working in eclectic harmony, strove to supply a rule of conduct and a higher vision of the Divine world' (p. vi). 'The love of wealth was strong, but a spirit of benevolence was in the air, even in the days of Ju- venal; and the constant invectives of poet or philo- sopher against wealth and luxury are not so much the sign of a growing selfishness, as of a spreading sense of the duty of the fortunate to the miserable' (p. 98). But, possessed as. he is by the idea of this 'great onward sweep of humanity to a spiritual reconstruction,' he has to admit that it did not go very far, at least above ground, and that the actual practice of the world was not greatly improved. Perhaps time was too short. 'Whether there was any corresponding elevation of conduct or moral tone in the mass of men may well be doubted.' A more certain point is the emotional value of those new religions to which Dr. Dill assigns chapters, e.g. the worships of Isis or of Mithra. The consideration of ancient religious systems, oracles, or divina- tions, as explanations of the world or as guides to conduct on definite occasions, has been carried far by students; while the other aspects of the cults as comforting, soothing, full of tenderness and cheer, are comparatively- overlooked. (See however Mr. L. Dyer's StudieB of the Gods in Greece.) But Dr. Dill has rightly seen how much Mithra and Isis had to offer to unhappy humanity where Jupiter had nothing. They held out hopes of another and a happier life; and even in this world, Mithra is the friend and consoler of the poor, while, as to Isis-- ' Women especially saw in the divine mother and mourner a glorified type of their sex, in all its troubles, such as their daughters in coming ages were destined to find in the Virgin Mother. .. The lonely, the weak, and the desolate found in the holy guilds succour and consolation, with a place in the ritual of her solemn seasons, which bound each to each in the love of a Divine Mother.' As the old religions of the Mediterranean</page><page sequence="4">134 THE CLASSICAL REVIEW. world decayed, or spread out into circles too wide for exact control, we find that they produced an inclination to syncretism and even monotheism, or allowed the rise of superstitions, or developed and modified the views of philosophers. On all these three tendencies the author has much to tell us. But perhaps his Third Book may be found the most generally interesting. Its motto is, Nec philosophia sine virtute est, nec sine philosophia virtus. Its material finds less parallel in modern times than the chapters of Books 1, II, or IV. We can- not easily point to modern philosophic directors or missionaries. We have had priest-directors, who were philosophers, just as we have missionaries who are medical men; but neither medicine nor philosophy has taken the first place with these teachers; whereas the philosophic interest and the moral interest filled nearly all the horizon with Seneca or Plutarch. The estimate of the position of philosophy under the early Roman empire takes us into many strange places. Philosophy on the throne, philo- sophy in opposition to the throne; philo- sophy limited to ethics, philosophy trying to rationalize religion and silence all obsti- nate questionings :-into all these branches of the subject Dr. Dill leads us, although he divides the ground somewhat differently, into The Philosophic Director, Missionary, and Theologian. Not least striking is the second portrait of his gallery. 'The philosophy of conduct was no longer the pursuit merely of an intellectual aristocracy. Com- mon, ignorant folk have caught the passion for apostleship. Everywhere might be met the familiar figure, with long cloak and staff and scrip, haranguing in the squares or lanes to unlettered crowds. And the preacher is often as unlearned as they, having left the forge or the carpenter's bench or the slave- prison, to proclaim his simple gospel of renunciation with more or less sincerity.' To this type we can obviously find analo- gies, but nothing really identical. The reforming spirit, then, was there, in that wavering Roman world, but it was really more moral than religious. When it was the latter, it hovered always over the gulf of superstition, and we hesitate to recognize reform. As moral, it was indeed offered to the poor; but we shall never know how far it was accepted by them, or how far any feeling so created turned to the profit of Christianity or Mithraism. Either of those systems might be for- warded among the poor and simple by a sense that the philosophic reformation preached was cold without religion, and unsatisfactory with the religions usually offered, and that something more personal, near, and kindly was wanted. Here then is another link, from the other end, as it were, between Books III and IV. We close the volume with the sense that we have been listening to a man of great learning, but equal power and judgment. To see, to estimate, to combine, are no small qualifications for a historian.
