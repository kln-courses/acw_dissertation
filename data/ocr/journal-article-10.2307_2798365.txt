The first of these is around 3000 B.C., when the makers of Japanese J6mon ware introduced the art of potting into Ecuador. Valdivia pottery looks uncannily like J6mon, and both its early date and its geographical isolation in America support the author's interpretation. It is worth remembering, however, that pottery (admittedly of quite different appearance) was in use on the Caribbean coast of Colombia at roughly the same date and that the isolation of Valdivia may turn out to be more apparent than real. At about 500 B.C. the Bahia phase begins and several new traits are introduced. Among tllem are models of houses with saddle roofs, pottery head-rests, anthropomorphic tusk- shaped pendants, 'golf-tee' earplugs, figurines with legs crossed one over the other, and Pan-pipes graduated towards the centre. An Asiatic origin is suggested for this complex, but although the case is worth making it is spoilt by overstatement. Tusk pendants are an unspecialised type, and the cross-legged posture recurs independently on Quimbaya figurines from Colombia. Sagged roofs and Pan-pipes are known only from pottery models; it is dangerous to infer their absence from times and places where such models were not made; and, given the idea of gradu- ated pipes, there are only three possible ways of arranging them symmetrically. A higher standard of proof is needed before this argument can be regarded as setded. WARWICK BRAY</page></plain_text>
