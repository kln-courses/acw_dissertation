<plain_text><page sequence="1">Four American Traditions By WILLIAM BEST HESSELTINE The Presidential Address' tRADITION, SAYS THE LEXICOGRAPHER, IS THE HANDING DOWN of statements, beliefs, legends, customs, etc., from generation to generation, especially by word of mouth or by practice." Or, as a minor poet put it, "Man yields to custom as he bows to fate. In all things ruled-mind, body, and estate." Throughout the course of American history, tradition has play- ed a major role-and one that commentators, searching for ex- planations of the phenomena of American development, have often ignored. More popular as a touchstone to test and explain the American story has been the popular political myth that the central function of the United States has been the evolution of personal liberty and civil rights, through a persistent conflict between Darkness and Light, a never ceasing clash between a so-called liberalism and a pre-defined conservatism. Equally popular, and often related to the political myth, is the dogma that the rivalry of opposing economic forces has given form and color to American life. Thus Charles A. Beard could see the American story as a basic conflict between a rising industrial order and a steadily declining agricultural society. Frederick Jackson Turner perceived the perennial re-creation of new so- cieties on the frontier, and counted their reactions upon the older and established orders. Others, borrowing consciously or unconsciously from Karl Marx, and bolstering their arguments with James Madison's remarks anent economic factionalism, have found a long enduring warfare between the rich and the poor, the "Haves" and the "Have-Nots." For the most part, the commentators on the American past have attended to the con- flicts, real and imagined, to the clash of verbal issues, or to the resounding rhetoric of rival partisans, while they have neglected to examine and assess the unifying forces of American life. iDelivered at the annual meeting of the Southern Historical Association at Tulsa, Oklahoma, on November 10, 1960.</page><page sequence="2">4 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY From the American Revolution to the present, the American people have demonstrated a capacity for conciliation and com- promise to a degree remarkable among the nations of the world. The 'Civil War, by virtue of its singularity, illustrates the per- sistence of the traditive methods of unity rather than supports the supposition that clash and conflict have been the primary characteristics of America. Moreover, those who have sought to resolve the problems of the United States, and to organize the data of the American past in terms of contending dichotomies, have frequently become bemused in the pathetic fallacy of ascribing anthropomorphic characteristics to capital and labor, to agriculture and industry, and have emerged incoherent in their effort to distinguish between progressive and conservative, radical and reactionary. Whatever validity the political terms "right" and "left" may 'have had in describing the seating arrange- ments of a French assembly, and however useful they may have been in the rhetorical arsenal of modem pundits and partisans, they have proved defective as viable concepts for examining the history of the American people. Rather than conflict and clash, the American story has been one of concert and concurrence. The search for the elements of American unity may constitute a more intriguing intellectual challenge 'than -the reporting of pseudodramatic contests or reciting bygone exhibitions of forensic skill. In a land without the geographical unity which has sometimes been the basis of nationalism, without a discrete language or literature, yet con- taining a multitude of economic activities, the problem of politi- cal, social, and 'cultural unity has been ever-present, and its achievement, with a comparatively minor amount of violence and coercion, a notable accomplishment. To a large extent, the American story is the result of the per- sistence of four basic traditions. From the first settlements in the new world, to the latest political contest, there have been developing and changing among the American people at least four bodies of traditional statements, beliefs, legends, customary modes of behavior, and concepts of society. If they have not "in all things ruled-mind, body, and estate," they have infused most aspects of American life and entered deeply into the national</page><page sequence="3">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 5 character. Described in terms of their exponents, the four basic American traditions are those of the Trustees, the Squires, the Artisans, and the Yeomen. Each of these basic traditions had its origins in England and came to America with the early English settlements. Time and experience produced divergence from the British models, and gave each tradition new and distinctively American character- istics. The trustee tradition carried echoes of the rise of the English middle classes and drew strength from British Calvinism and the Puritan strain in British thought. The squires of the new world consciously imitated and sometimes overtly imported the concepts of the manorial system. The artisan tradition per- petuated in ;a new environment some of the legends, sentiments, and customs of the medieval gilds, while the tradition of the sturdy yeomen who stood at Crecy and Agincourt had not passed entirely from the memory of the landless city dwellers who made up the bulk of the earlier migrants to the colonies. In America, and under American conditions, these traditions merged, took on new forms, ceased to be the particular philosophies of severely separated classes, and became the common heritage of 'the American people. Although by no means the exclusive philosophies of particular social or economic groups, each of the four traditions at various times in 'the nineteenth century found its characteristic expression in one or another dominant group in some region of the country. Yet the traditions were never sectional, and they never furnished convenient categories for the arbitrary classification of individual's or groups in the American past. Throughout the nineteenth century, men lived sometimes as manorial lords, and were even addressed as "Squire," yet shared the beliefs and legends of the 'trustee tradition. The exponents of the artisan tradition could be found on corporation boards, in the manager's office of rail- roads, as well as in the bicycle shops where tinkering mechanics dreamed of revolutionizing transportation. The traditions, in fact, transcended politico-economic categories to permeate all orders of society and to give significant unity to the American scene.</page><page sequence="4">6 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY In nineteenth-century America, the most coherent and often the most aggressive groups were those who adhered to a tradi- tion that described them as Stewards of the Lord, weighted with a tremendous responsibility for properly ordering society. The trustee tradition drew its rationale from Calvinist theology and found its fullest manifestation in New England's Puritan com- monwealths. The dogma of election lay at the base of the tradi- tion. Explicit in it was the belief that God's Elect should guide their fellow men in the paths of righteousness. The Elect should so order society that it conformed to the will of the Creator and glorified the Lord. Fortunately, those whom the Almighty elected for salvation, He also prospered. But their prosperity, whether counted in the wealth of the world, the powers of the intellect, or in elevation of spirit, belonged not to men but to their Creator. They were but stewards obliged to use their wealth and their talents to effect a social order which would conform to moral law. Professor Clifford Griffin has traced the evolution of the con- cept of stewardship from the Puritan fathers to the end of the American Civil War. The Puritan commonwealths of New Eng- land illustrated the theory of 'the state held 'by men who con- ceived of themselves as Their Brothers' Keepers. Griffin has shown, as well, that the trustees were adaptable to new con- ditions and could maintain their objectives in a changing eco- nomic world and adopt even a new vocabulary without altering their basic premises. When a growing population in colonial Massachusetts forced a reconsideration of representative govern- ment, the trustees accepted a Halfway Covenant and continued to direct society along the paths of righteousness. When Deism threatened the foundations of the old Calvinism, the trustees adopted what Professor Griffin calls a "stewardship of ethics" which posited the doctrine that new men of the Enlightenment- successors of the predestined Elect-understood the laws of nature and should guide men toward a perfect state. So, too, when Federalism lost power to Republicanism, the trustees turned to moral suasion and formed a host of benevolent societies devoted to Sabbath observance, education of ministers, the spread of religious literature, peace, temperance, and the abolition of slavery-all designed to bring society into conformity to the</page><page sequence="5">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 7 moral law. And then, when moral suasion made slow progress, the men of the trustee tradition turned once more to the state and demanded Sunday closing laws, compulsory education, the prohibition of alcohol, and the abolition of slavery. They gave allegiance to a higher law than the Constitution. The Civil War saw the men with the beliefs and legends of the trustees assuming direction of the conflict and diverting it into a moral crusade. At the war's end, they proposed to reorganize the South's economic, social, and political 'system-"to infuse," as one religious paper put it, the South "with a purer, more liberty- loving civilization." As America passed into the Gilded Age, men adapted the trustee tradition to new economic realities, yet never lost from sight the goal of a society which would conform to God's will for man. The new rationale of the Stewards of the Lord substituted the possession of special traits of character for the older dogmas of election. The democratic concept of self-made man found a new theoretical basis in Social Darwinism, a new rationale in the so- called Social Gospel, while the possession of wealth was both a testimony of God's favor and an evidence of the social operation of the laws of natural selection. "The way to success," said a writer in the Baptist Quarterly in 1873, "lies through competence, industry, enterprise, and honesty." And wealth, when "wielded by educated intelligence, puts in a ... definite and positive claim for rulership and authority." Yet not even in the Gilded Age did men forget that wealth implied responsibility. Ministers of the gospel reminded men of means that they must give an account of their stewardship. "How does it become us, being the stewards of God, to use what His bounty has intrusted to us?" asked one of them. And, as in the pre-Civil War days, when societies for moral improvement insisted upon a doctrine of benevolence, the custodians of the trustee tradition advocated philanthropy. Henry Ward Beecher pro- claimed that God blessed the man who built a library or a hos- pital, who established a 'savings bank, or who taught the gospel of thrift to the people. John D. Rockefeller put the teaching into practice, asserting that it was a man's duty to accumulate wealth in order to use it in good works. In 1859, his donations to charity</page><page sequence="6">8 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY were $28.37, a decade later, $5,489.62. In the end they amounted to millions. There was more than pious benevolence in the trustee tradition in the last decade of the nineteenth and the first years of the twentieth century. The men of the trustee tradition never for long pinned their hopes for a moral society upon voluntary institutions. They were in the forefront of movements for social reformation through the coercive power of the state. They sponsored force bills to make the South accord full political rights to Negroes. They fought the Demon Rum with local option laws and with state and national prohibition. They advocated pure food and drug acts. They policed private morals with local ordinances against prurient literature, and public morals ;through congres- sional investigations. They tried to stamp out interstate prostitu- tion and the use of narcotics. They were national humanitarians, calling themselves Progressives, who believed that the govern- ment, under their direction, should make a society which would eliminate evil. "My observation and reasoning as I study these problems at home and abroad," said Frank Munsey to Theodore Roosevelt, "leads unerringly to the conclusion that the state has got to swing back a bit from our vaunted Republicanism and take on a more parental guardianship" of the people. "The people," he continued, "need safeguarding in their investments, their savings, their application of conservation. They need en- couragement, the sustaining and guiding hand of the state .... It is the work of the state 'to think for the people, and plan for the people-to teach them how to do, what to do, and to sustain them in the doing." The plans for Utopia were still in the making. In the vocabulary of their spiritual ancestors among the Puritan Fathers, they would make a society which would glorify God. The society, of course, would be world-wide. Late in the nine- teenth century Josiah Strong called the nation's attention to its duty as a trustee in world society. Under the direction of men of the trustee tradition, the United States rescued Cuba and inaugurated a new empire with a model colonial system. Under the leadership of men of the trustee tradition, it prepared to fight 'to make the world safe for democracy. The concept of the trustees that the Elect should rule society, that wealth in money,</page><page sequence="7">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 9 skills, and talents should be used for the general good, have dominated American participation in world affairs. The twentieth century would see the World Court, the League of Nations, and the United Nations, each an embodiment of the principles of the trustee tradition, while the U.S.I.S., the Point Four Program, and the manifold "aid" activities under the I.C.A. were counter- parts of -the tract societies, the Bible and missionary societies, and ithe educational societies of the nineteenth century. Of the four basic traditions of America, the statements, beliefs, legends, and customs of the trustees were the most oriented to government and the most politically dynamic. The trustee tradi- tion was, essentially, a tradition of leadership, and its devotees and adherents were committed to leading the nation into paths of a preconceived righteousness. Yet the trustees were not alone as leaders. Another tradition, that of the squires, also embodied the concepts of leadership, and its exponents assumed an obli- gation to guide the people. In their basic compulsions, the squires were less guided by theology-or, at least, less prone to resort to a theological rhetoric to define and defend their position. Rather than presuming to act as the agents of the Lord, the squires found their rationale in the concepts of gentlemanly behavior, in the doctrine of noblesse oblige, in the realization that men favored by wealth, or by talents, had the duty to guide their neighbors. While the obligation of the trustees was to mold society, the squire's duty was to guide the morals and the be- havior of the individuals in his care. The model of the squire was 'the manorial lord of England whose people-his tenants, his neighbors, and his family-were 'his personal responsibility. The concept had its origins in feudal- ism, its examples in the baronial courts. Transferred to America, it was associated with the ownership of land, and with the regu- lation of the affairs of men in accordance with law. Where the trustee relied upon Divine guidance, upon the correct interpre- tation of the Scriptures, upon the Protestant ethic, and ultimately upon the higher law, the squire was guided by the ways of the barons, the customs of the manor, the legends of the nobility. He was concerned with the relations of man to man; he devoted himself to the maintenance of law and order and ultimately gave</page><page sequence="8">10 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY his allegiance to the fundamental law of the Constitution. The law of landlord and tenant derived from the traditions of the squires; John Marshall's decisions wrote the squire's concepts of land into the Constitution of the United States. Fundamentally, the squire's responsibilities were both to man and to the land. He had a respect for the land and for its use, and gave time and energy to agricultural experiments. Thomas Jeffer- son tested new plants and improved seeds, John Jay at Bedford worked to "resuscitate agriculture" with gypsum, Edmund Ruffin explored the uses of calcareous manures. John Steele watched with interest German efforts to cross the ass and the ox. John Taylor's Arator recited his experiments with new implements, fertilizers, and breeds of livestock. Agricultural societies, farm journals, and agricultural fairs served to emphasize the squire's concern with the good use of the earth, and to instill among his yeoman neighbors his own devotion to the soil. John C. Calhoun declared that there was no better way to advance the nation than to contribute to the improvement of agriculture. Above all, the tradition of the squires was an apologetic for agriculture. The whole economic structure of the nation, declared John Taylor, depended on the well-being of agriculture; "if the cultivation of land flourishes, all other occupations prosper; if it languishes, they decay." All the virtues were the products of the country-truth, refinement, and culture were, cried a writer in the Literary Messenger in 1858, products of the countryside. "Learn the speech of the elements," he advised. "It will be of more benefit than the language of barbarous people." Moreover, agriculture stimulated the mind by giving an insight into the "real affairs of life, with a necessity for investigating the arena of nature." It was, too, said Abel P. Upshur, "the best school of both public and private virtue." And, since landholders were ever ready to defend their country, it was the source of patriotism. On the other hand, as all squires knew, cities were the breeding places of vice and corruption. Abel P. Upshur was sure that big cities were the birthplace of sedition, riot, disorder, and a threat to rational, regulated liberty. Thomas Jefferson deplored the necessity for sending his grandson to school in Philadelphia. "I am not a friend to placing growing men in populous cities,</page><page sequence="9">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 11 because they acquire there habits and partialities which do not contribute to the happiness of their after life." George Fitzhugh catalogued the evils of the cities-the police reports, calendars of crime, ignorance, atheism, destitution and starvation, trade unions, mobs, unemployment, disease, gambling hells, noisome factories. The country, sighed Dolly Madison, provided "the happiest and most true life." As much as 'he owed an obligation to the land, the squire owed more to his people. He lived among them and was in daily contact with them, and the sense of noblesse oblige guided his conduct. He defined himself as a gentleman and instructed his children in the ways of gentle folk. The gentleman was charac- terized by truth, courtesy, bravery, and generosity. John Ran- dolph scorned the criteria of wealth, but placed an emphasis on discriminating taste and judgment. He told the War Hawks of 1811 to "go talk to the good old planters" and learn standards of judgment. In bucolic images he sought for "the better hawk," the "dog with the deeper mouth," the horse which bore its rider best, and the girl with the "merrier eye." Thomas Ruffin's father instructed him in the duty of a gentleman to check unruly pas- sions and sinful desires and to develop the qualities of meekness, gentleness, charity, and good will toward others. Thomas Jeffer- son advised his grandson that honesty, disinterestedness, and, above all, good humor were requisites for success. The tradition of the squires was a tradition of leadership, but positions of leadership must be deserved. Jefferson told his grandson to apply himself to his studies in order that he might some day become a useful member of society. John Randolph reminded his nephew that "it follows that the richer, the wiser, the more powerful a man is, the greater is the obligation upon him to employ his gifts in the lessening of the sum of human misery." The duty and responsibilities of a gentleman imposed a code of etiquette upon the men of the squire tradition. Instead of the divine precepts which regulated, at least in theory, the daily lives of the trustees, the squire's relations with his fellow man were defined in rules of etiquette. He prided himself on good manners, on the punctilio of polite society, on behaving as a man of honor. He defended his honor, when need arose, with pistols</page><page sequence="10">12 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY at dawn. He placed stress on courtesy, on respect for women, on politeness. He expected politeness in return. A code of etiquette prescribed the relations of man and man, of father to son, of master to servant. He expected young men to address their elders in phrases of respect, young women to curtsy, the lesser ranks of men to touch their caps as they passed by and to come bare- headed into the presence of their betters. In a society in which good manners were the highest virtue, bad manners were the greatest sin. Perhaps nothing in the post-Civil War South was more offensive than the ill manners which the freedmen displayed toward their former masters. The former slave, signalizing his new found freedom by impudence and discourtesy, sinned against the fundamentals of social order. The code of good manners extended to entertainment and to hospitality. The squire's house was open, his table free to visitors who shared his traditions. He erected entertainment into a fine art. With an interest in sports, games, athletic contests, and trials of skill, he endowed them with rules of etiquette and the concepts of good sportsmanship. The tradition of the squires enjoined reading-not for moral profit, but for enjoyment-and he collected books and lined his shelves with volumes of classics in many languages. He patronized music and even art. He culti- vated the arts of oratory and of conversation. The tradition of the squire required the assumption of responsi- bility for the well-being and the good conduct of his people. The squire who was a slaveholder frequently placed the happiness of his slaves above his own material prosperity. Thomas Dabney, moving from Virginia to Louisiana in the 1830's, refused to put part of his slaves on another plantation because he would no longer be able to attend the welfare of each bondsman. John A. Quitman, faced with bankruptcy, refused to part with his slaves. "I would rather," he declared, "be reduced to abject penury than to sell one of them." The nonslaveholding squire bore the same responsibility to his neighbors and, when in public life, to his constituents. It was a patriarchal tradition, and it took cognizance of the duties as well as the privileges of the patriarchs. Part of the obligation was the duty of public service. The</page><page sequence="11">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 13 squire participated in the activities of the county courts, the vestry, the legislature, and the Congress. Calhoun was firm in the belief that men of education and leisure must take part in government. Only by 'the influence of gentlemen could dignity enter public affairs. "If !the capable and worthy retire," he wrote, "the designing, or worthless will take their place." The squire derived his ideas of government from the classics and applied them in his politics. The form of government most to be admired was a republic ruled by an aristocracy of worth, and kept small enough to be both comprehended and controlled. "An overgrown state, like an overgrown man," thought George Fitzhugh, was "not generally equal in wisdom or strength to one of moderate size." Moreover, as his own affairs were regulated by a code of etiquette which had the authority of statutes, public affairs should be regulated by law. It was the duty of a citizen to obey the laws, and- above all, the law of the Constitution. Speculation about a "higher law" might be an interesting intellectual exercise, but action based on higher law mandates was treason. Perhaps, indeed, thought James Fenimore 'Cooper, it would be best if the state had a limited suffrage. The shifting population of the United States caused men to lose their roots and their sense of community responsibility, while the steadily increasing flow of immigrants brought in new elements unadjusted to the American heritage. Cooper found that Connecticut's government by a tight patrician clique was one of the purest democratic com- munities in the world! "A system must be radically wrong, when the keeper of a tavern . . . can command more votes than a man of the highest attainments, or of the highest character," thought Squire Cooper. The role of 'the men of the squire tradition was long in Ameri- can history. In the beginning there were the planters of the South and the patroons of the Hudson Valley. In the tradition have lived the cattle kings, the wheat kings, the citrus growers of the Rio Grande, the vineyardists of Cincinnati and California, apple men of the Yakimra and the Shenandoah. There have been Van Cortlandts and De Lanceys, Masons, 'and Kings, Middletons and Carters, Livingstons, and Heywards. On the national scene there were George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, James Madison</page><page sequence="12">14 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY and James Monroe, Andrew Jackson, Zachary Taylor, and Jeffer- son Davis. In the states the names of the squires who assumed the duty of participating in public affairs was legion. They were the members of colonial councils, of county courts, of state legislatures. They maintained a code of etiquette on the frontier, made and enforced the laws which protected property, and established rules of behavior in new communities. They were bishops of the Episcopal Church and officers in the army. They served on the boards of colleges, on the vestries of the churches, on countless committees for social betterment. They were in the forefront of movements for civic improvement. Fit representative of the squire tradition was the Tennessee 'historian, J. G. M. Ramsey, whose varied activities ranged from the practice of medicine to the financing of railroads. He defined himself as a patriot and as an aristocrat. Patriotism, he defined as "something else than party zeal or a selfish scrabble for offices." Aristocracy, he defined more elaborately as being of four kinds. First there was the aristocracy of birth and family, and such aristocrats "can never be brought to believe that because an indi- vidual has had a grandfather or an ancester of elevated character, unquestioned integrity, high-souled honor, stainless reputation, etc., that he is thus placed on a level with the son of a thief, a defamer, or a blackguard." A second kind of aristocracy was one of virtue-"a love of truth, probity, sincerity, candor, justice, humanity, honor, and public and private virtue." And, he re- marked, "if to these attributes is added a becoming deference to age, to character, to position, to sex and to private worth the possessor is deservedly esteemed the superior of the ignoble, the supercilious, the vulgar, the rude, the selfish upstart and pre- tender." In fact, thought Dr. Ramsey, the aristocrat of virtue had "a title o'f nobility which even the disciples of Black Republican- ism would be unwilling avowedly to discard or openly to in- validate." Then, said Dr. Ramsey, there was an aristocracy of intellect-"well cultivated intellect, a well disciplined mind, well balanced thinking power, the ability to investigate, to dis- criminate, to analyse, to sublimate, to elucidate, to philosophize, to generalize-this ability gives the individual possessing it a genuine claim to true nobility." And finally, Dr. Ramsey admitted,</page><page sequence="13">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 15 there was an aristocracy of wealth. Now wealth acquired by honest industry was praiseworthy-especially if its possessor "be generous in his public and private benefaction, unselfish and liberal in his charities, a patron of learning and science and the material improvement of the country." But wealth acquired dis- honestly "'makes the owner purse-proud, arrogant, supercilious and pretentious, intolerant and overbearing to the poorer classes, sycophantic or envious of those superior to them in rank or public esteem." By his standards of aristocracy and patriotism, Dr. Ramsey raised his children and served his community. His pride in his family led him into the study of history, and his Annals of Tennes- see was one result. He was a devout Presbyterian, serving on 'the boards of trustees of church colleges and academies. He made his house into a house of prayer. He made it, too, into a house of culture. At Mecklenburg, which he built exactly at the point where the French Broad and the Holston Rivers converge, he gathered a library of four thousand volumes and documents and manuscripts of Tennessee history. There he entertained statesmen and clergymen, scholars and men of letters. His patriotism, his duty to his community, led him into other activi- ties. He served as a canal commissioner; he promoted railroad connections between the Tennessee mountains and the outside world; he was president of a bank, a school commissioner, the president of the Tennessee Historical Society. He wrote poetry. He was a postmaster. He operated a ferry. He owned and man- aged a plantation with its slaves. Hle practiced medicine. In politics he was a states rights Democrat. When the Civil War came, he became a treasury agent and served as a volunteer surgeon on the battlefields of the Confederacy. The war swept away the world of Dr. Ramsey. Mecklenburg with its library and manuscripts was burned to the ground; the colleges which he had served passed into alien hands; his rail- road became in time a part of a Yankee-owned system. At the age of sixty-eight he borrowed a horse and a doctor's saddlebags, and with thirty-five cents worth of drugs, he resumed the prac- tice of medicine. Once he returned to Knoxville only to find that its society had changed. There was more commerce, more manu-</page><page sequence="14">16 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY factures, and more business, but with it there was less social stability. "There was an undercurrent of discordant material," he noted. "Antagonisms were visible everywhere and in all pursuits .. . .There was less hospitality, less of the generous emotions and manly passions, more of the sordid love of money, less cul- ture, much less refinement, a more vulgar taste. Less evangelical piety-more religious pretention. Less patriotism, and, of course, more selfishness. Less of learning and, of course, more of pedantry. Less deference for age, character, and worth and more boastful effrontery and upstart consequence. The people were ruder and coarser, less gentle, less amiable." Sadly, Dr. Ramsey turned his thoughts to history and dwelt again on the glories of his an- cestors. But though Dr. Ramsey ended in disillusionment and distress, the tradition which he represented did not disappear from Ameri- can life. Even Dr. Ramsey recognized the possibility. There were, in the Knoxville which distressed him, "some model gentlemen," and he hoped that in time the "passion for money" could "be cultivated into an enlarged public spirit and thus come up to the dimension and proportion of a lofty patriotism." In the gen- erations which followed him, 'the tradition of the squires received new life and new manifestations. Newer men took up the old tradition and guided their lives by the precepts which Dr. Ram- sey embodied. Some of them sought out the old columned houses or modeled new dwellings upon them as symbols of the tradition. Some of them sought to emulate and perpetuate the codes of etiquette by which gentlemen lived. Some of them gave their time and energies to civic improvements-to adhere to Dr. Ram- sey's ideals of public and private virtue. The men of the squire tradition had not lived exclusively in the South, and from New England to California, in communities new as well as old, the sense of noblesse oblige, and the concepts of community service, continued to inspire men to assume the responsibilities of leader- ship. The tradition of the squires, like that of the trustees, was one of leadership. The squire prepared himself for civic responsibility, rationalized his acts and his ambitions in terms of his duty to his people, his community, and his constituents, prided himself on</page><page sequence="15">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 17 his public services, and was deeply offended when his people rejected his leadership. His people, all too often for his happiness, adhered to a different tradition and guided themselves by the statements, beliefs, legends, and customs which were handed down from generation to generation of yeomen and artisans. The yeoman and artisan traditions, unlike those of the trustees and the squires, were traditions of producers rather than of leaders. Neither yeomen nor artisans labored under either a feudal or a Calvinist compulsion to regenerate society or to impose either a moral code or a code of etiquette upon mankind. They were, instead, consoled and uplifted by the knowledge that they fed and clothed the world. They were willing enough to follow squires or trustees, to accept the rules of conduct of the squires or to adhere to the moral code and enlist in the benevolent cru- sades of the trustees, so long as the leaders pointed the pathway to increased production, to profitable markets, and to progress. They were equally willing to rebel, to riot, and to strike when the leaders inhibited production or the enjoyment of the fruits of their labor. The yeoman tradition in America had evolved, under American circumstances, from the ways of life of the freeholders of Eng- land. Yeomen of England were "plain honest men," and the term was in common use in colonial America. From England the yeo- men inherited a tradition of sturdy independence, and they car- ried it with them across the continent. The yeoman tradition was in no sense a peasant tradition. The American yeoman was de- voted to agriculture and to the processing of agricultural pro- ducts, but he was never content with subsistence farming. His independence may, indeed, have been a myth, for he was never able to take his gaze from the market place. The value of land, the price of produce, and the cost of supplies were ever present realities to the American farmer, but the yeoman tradition rested firmly on the belief that the tiller of the soil was the primary source of American wealth, that all other ways of life were de- pendent upon him, and that he who was surrounded by his own farm and enjoyed the fruits of his own industry owed no man anything but love and good will. "There is not another deplart- ment of society which enables so many men to live as independ-</page><page sequence="16">18 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY ent principals," intoned Henry Ward Beecher, and the agricul- tural journals quoted him with approval and rang the changes upon it. Surrounded by the friends I love, And free from every fetter I am an independent man And wish for nothing better. Out of the staunch independence of the yeoman sprang the defense of the country's soil. "There is one class of men on whom we can yet rely," said the Tennessee Review. "It is the same class that stood on the green at Lexington-that gathered on the heights of Bunker Hill, and poured down from the hills of New England." And the Prairie Farmer found place for a poem re- counting how, in "Seventy-Six," What heroes from the woodland sprung When through the fresh-awakened land, The thrilling cry of freedom rung, And to the work of warfare strung The yeoman's iron hand! Next to the belief that the yeomen were independent stood the firm conviction (that the agrarian was happy, healthy, re- ligious, and moral. However much the outside observer, be he a Squire Byrd running a boundary line or a Trustee Dwight scream- ing his fears of a growing Western power, might find the yeomen uncouth and write scornfully of their cultural attainments, the yeomen took pride in their simplicity and pointed the finger of scorn at the followers of "fashion." They condemned the immoral- ity of cities, the cringing life of the merchants, and the decep- tions of politicians. They were following a divinely instituted calling, and their every act was one of worship of God and nature. No glory I covet, no riches I want, Ambition is nothing to me: The one thing I beg kind heaven to grant, Is a mind independent and free. Inherent in the agrarian tradition was the belief in the moral value of hard work. Farm journals repeatedly urged their readers</page><page sequence="17">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 19 to "'teach the rising generation that industry is the surest road to respectability." Work was divinely ordained, and only by the sweat of one's brow should he eat bread. Labor prevented moral evils, subdued the passions, promoted individuality of character, and increased the wealth of society. "Oh, there is good in labor," said a Wisconsin poet: Oh, there is good in labor If we labor but aright, That gives vigor to the daytime And a sweeter sleep at night A good that bringeth pleasure Even to the toiling hours- For the duty cheers the spirit, As the dew revives the flowers. With such concepts, the American yeomen were primarily in- terested in production and in the preservation of their independ- ence from all outside interference. They were opposed to every limitation upon their free use of the land. They opposed quitrents, direct taxes, proclamation lines, grants to speculators, to land companies, and to railroads. They favored homesteads, free trade, farm-to-market roads and canals. In defense of their tradition they rioted against the landed families of New York in the 1760's, stood embattled at Lexington and Concord, joined Ethan Allen's Green Mountain Boys, or marched with Campbell and Shelby to turn back the British at King's Mountain. They were the men of Bacon's Rebellion, of Shay's Rebellion, of the Whiskey Rebel- lion. Jefferson marshaled them in his Republican party; Benton and Jackson led them in the Democratic party. They voted themselves a farm in 1860, fought for it on Seminary Ridge and Missionary Ridge in 1863, and homesteaded it in the 1870's. Despite their asseverations of sturdy independence and of greater happiness, the men of the agrarian tradition firmly be- lieved that they were the victims of discrimination and stood always on the defensive. Liberal theologians attacked the yeo- man's fundamentalist religious beliefs, and conservatives con- demned the excesses of his evangelical practices. Educational leaders insisted upon foisting a nonfunctional curriculum upon the</page><page sequence="18">20 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY rural schools and waged a winning battle against the one-room country school. And although musicologists collected the folk songs of the yeoman, an effete pseudo culture affected to scorn hillbilly songs, revival tunes, and country music. More serious by far was the long line of discriminations placed upon the men of the yeoman tradition. Governments of the colonial period, more concerned with British mercantile interests than with colonial producers, levied taxes, fixed prices, and restricted set- tlements with no regard for agrarian interests. The Founding Fathers, acting in accordance with the traditions of squires and trustees, drafted a constitution which aroused the suspicions of the yeomen. The Federalists were oriented toward the enemies of the farmers. Squire Jefferson, ever mindful of their votes and conscious of his duty, compromised their interests, and his suc- cessors stepped away from them. The West was theirs-but only with a struggle. Whether the discriminations were real or imagi- nary, the belief that farmers were despised, ignored, or exploited became a part of the agrarian tradition, and yeomen considered themselves weak in the government and fighting a losing battle with the forces and groups which clung to other American tradi- tions. Although men of the squire tradition assumed the responsibility for voicing the concepts, beliefs, and legends of the yeoman, the agricultural journals became the principal medium for car- rying on the tradition and adapting it to changing circumstance. A constant refrain of the farm papers, repeated by the publica- tions of the agricultural societies, and emphasized by orators at state and county fairs was that the farmer was not accorded the respect in society to which his virtue and his contributions en- titled him. The American Agriculturalist, the Ploughboy, the New England Farmer, and the Ohio Cultivator dwelt at length on the lowly state of the farmer and the low repute of agricultural labor. "There is a belief in this country,"% moaned the Farmer's Almanac, "that agriculture is a vulgar occupation." One result of this belief, thought the farm journalists, was that their young people were leaving the farm. Against the widespread denigration of the farmer, the journals waged a many-sided campaign. They used, in fact, the real or</page><page sequence="19">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 21 the alleged lowly state of the agrarian to strengthen the tradition and to bring ideological unity to farming groups. Over and over they recited the virtues of farm life, reiterated the dogmas of the agrarian's independence and moral superiority, and glorified agricultural labor. At the same time they attacked the city dwellers, the bankers, and the politicians. They urged youth to stay on the farm, praised simplicity, and derided "fashion." But above all, they were the exponents of education. Sharing the common American belief that the schoolroom was the entrance hall to the house of prosperity, they demanded agricultural schools, research into better methods of farming, scientific ex- perimentation, and, of course, the reading of books and agricul- tural journals. In the 1870's a new agency essayed the task of strengthening the yeoman tradition. The Patrons of Husbandry gathered the farmers to reiterate the dogma that, as the Worcester, Massa- chusetts, Grange put it in its constitution, "the soil is the source from whence we derive all that constitutes wealth .... The art of agriculture is the parent and precourser of all arts, and its products the foundation of aill wealth." The songbooks of the Grangers told again how 'Tis toil that over nature Gives man his proud control And purifies and hallows The temple of his soul. It startles foul diseases, With all their ghastly train; Puts iron in the muscle And crystal in the brain. They repeated that The farmer's the chief of the nation- The oldest of nobles is he; How blest beyond others his station, From want and from envy how free! and were sure that "the true and honest husbandman" was "the noblest work of God." God, in fact, conferred the obligation to till the soil:</page><page sequence="20">22 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY Awake! Awake! The world must be fed, And Heaven gives the power To the hand that holds the bread. Against the temptations of the city, the yeomen in the Granges could sing advice to their youth: Come, boys, I have something to tell you Come near, I would whisper it low; You're thinking of leaving the homestead- Don't be in a hurry to go. The city has many attractions, But think of its vices and sins; But once in the vortex of fashion How soon our destruction begins. The farm is the best and the safest, And certainly surest to pay; You're free as the air of the mountain, And monarch of all you survey. Then stay on the farm a while longer, Though profits come in rather slow, Remember you've nothing to risk, boys,- Don't be in a hurry to go. By the days of the Grange movement, the men of the yeoman tradition had come to confront the usury of the bankers and had fallen into debt. In measured numbers the Grange songbooks gave simple advice: See that your right to the homestead Is not encumbered by debt; Strictest economy practice And toil with a vigorous arm, Make it your strong resolution, Never to mortgage the farm. It was better indeed 'to wear old clothes: Friends, don't run in debt; never mind, never mind, If your clothes are some faded and torn;</page><page sequence="21">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 23 Fix them up, make them do, it is better by far, Than the heart be weary and worn. Who will love you the more for the set of your hat, Or your ruff or the tie of your shoe, Or the shape of your vest, or your boots, or cravat, If they know you're in debt for the new? It was the concepts of the yeoman tradition, often enough expressed in homely verse, that gave basis for the Granger legis- lation in the states and furnished the background for the Populisit movement in politics. The yeomen of America believed, indeed, with William Jennings Bryan that the cities rested upon the broad and fertile prairies and that the destruction of the farm would cause the grass to grow in the city streets. The yeoman tradition was a tradition of production. It bolstered the legend of independence, stressed the dignity of toil, and found virtue in simplicity. It was not a tradition of leadership-the yeoman had no compulsive drive to reform, regenerate, or guide society. It was, however, a tradition of criticism, and men of the yeoman tradition judged the adts of squires and trustees by criteria de- rived from the soil. For the most part those Who would lead the American people paid lip service, at least, to the criteria and the values of the yeoman tradition. But one orator, appearing at the Wisconsin State Fair in 1859, made short shrift of the yeoman tradition. "I presume," he began, "I am not expected to employ the time assigned to me, in the mere flattery of the farmers as a class. My opinion of them is that, in proportion to numbers, they are neither better nor worse than other people." The speaker was Abraham Lincoln, and he devoted his time to talking about inventions and the application of machinery to the farm. He spent, in fact, considerable time speculating about how a stationary engine could operate a plow. Abraham Lincoln was no yeoman. His interests stemmed from the artisan tradition, and his approach to the problems of the farm, as to all other problems before the country, were in terms of craftsmanship, mechanical skills, and material progress. The artisan tradition was also a tradition of work and of pro-</page><page sequence="22">24 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY duction. It was the tradition of those jacks-of-all-trades who amazed European travelers and American observers alike. There was an element of craftsmanship in it, and of the pride of silver- smiths and cabinetmakers who signed their work. But more than craftsmanship which a European worker might stress the Ameri- can boasted of his ingenuity. An English visitor was amazed when a general mended the broken wheel of his wagon, but such versatility was commonplace in America. In Fond Du Lac, Wis- consin, far out on the frontier, lived an "Uncle Dexter" whose nephew remembered how he was a carpenter and joiner and carried on a shop for general repairing and "all sorts of tinkering." He would undertake anything, "from a piano to a penny whistle." In New England the village blacksmith made farm implements, household utensils, cutlery, hardware, ship anchors and fittings. In the country villages and in the growing cities, the artisan tradition inspired men to develop skills, but most of all it inspired them to invent new gadgets, perfect new devices, and improve the methods of work. The men of the artisan tradition prided themselves on the name "mechanic." Horace Greeley never let it be forgotten that he was a printer and looked back upon the greatest of printers, Benjamin Franklin, as a patron saint. In the line of mechanics were Roger Sherman the shoemaker, General Henry Knox the bookbinder, General Nathanael Greene the blacksmith. Abraham Lincoln asserted that he was "in no sense a farmer" and recounted his days as a craftsman, a sawmill worker, and a railsplitter. An- drew Johnson bored hi's associates in the United States Senate with tales of his days in a tailor shop and as President could remember that he always made a good fit and got the work out on time. Spokesmen for the artisan tradition found deep meanings in the labor of the mechanic. Man's superiority over the other ani- mals, said one, "is attributable solely to the influence of the mechanic arts." He went on to elaborate: "The culture of the mechanic arts are not only calculated to elicit, expand, and in- vigorate the inventive faculties of man, to strengthen his natural imbecility, inform his natural ignorance, and enrich his natural poverty, but also to advance his morals, refine his manners, and</page><page sequence="23">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 2-5 elevate his character." When, early in the century, Philadelphia workmen faced trial for conspiracy, they had no hesitancy about proclaiming that "the principle is undeniable that labour consti- tutes the real wealth of a country." The "real patriots," asserted the Workingman's Advocate in 1830, are "the mechanics, who have produced this vast national wealth." If the laboring classes were to decline, intoned the Mechanic's Free Press, all other classes would fade away. "Aristocracy,"X echoed the Advocate, "will then have to hide its head, and those who produced the wealth of the nation-the farmers, mechanics, and other working men-will rank, as they should do, as the most useful classes of society, and be respected in proportion to their usefulness." From the beginning, the great problem of America was engi- neering, and the mechanics knew full well that they were build- ing the land, that they were creating a new heaven on the earth. They looked upon the devices they invented and which they knew how to operate, and told the tale of American progress in terms of new and better machinery. Progress was their most important product. They were the true prophets of progress, and sometimes they looked with skepticism upon the Puritan reformism of the trustees which frequently called itself "pro- gressive." "We plan," said the poet Whittier, "to raise, beyond the all Thy great Cathedral, sacred Industry-no tomb, A keep for life for practical invention .... Mark-mark the spirit of invention everywhere- Thy rapid patents Thy continual workshops, foundries, risen or rising. Inherent in the concepts of the artisan tradition were theories of society and of social organization. When the Poet Longfellow invited Elihu Burritt to visit him, the learned blacksmith asked if he could bring his hammer with him. "I can assure you that my hammer is as much predisposed to swim on the top of all my ideas, as was the axe to float on the surface of the water at 'the touch of the prophet." The hammer, in fact, swam on top of all the ideas of the artisan tradition. The social concepts of the artisans were more complex than those of the yeomen, the squires,</page><page sequence="24">26"n THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY or the trustees. They ranged from simple demands for the recog- nition of the importance of labor, through apologetics for a capitalistic society, to grandiose schemes for social reform. Burritt wanted "no higher human reward for any attainment I may make in literature or science, than the satisfaction of having stood in the lot of the laboring man." The Workingman's Advo- cate was sure it would be better to have state legislatures com- posed of farmers and mechanics who could make laws intelligible rather than of "lawyers who involve us in perplexity and mischief." The common people should "therefore, trust in nobody but them- solves, and be divinely or charitably and equitably impelled by true nobleness of spirit." The Mechanic's Free Press called for the unity of the productive classes for the preservation of Ameri- can free institutions and argued that "whatever is conducive to the real prosperity of the greatest numbers, must in the nature of things conduce to the happiness of all." When workmen won political victories in Philadelphia, the paper rejoiced that "the balance of power has at length got into the hands of the working people, where it properly belongs, and it will be used, in the future, for the public weal." Not only were spokesmen for the artisan tradition sure that the mechanics made the wealth of America, they were also con- vinced that artisans were intent upon the general welfare. They had only contempt for those who would freeze the workingman in his lot or who would separate workers from capitalists. Elihu Burritt visited la co-operative colony and pronounced it a "demonstration how utterly impracticable, unnatural, visionary, and absurd was this chimerical species of Association. Never did I see a place where more self denial and sacrifice of personal com- fort, right, and privilege seemed requisite than here .... Here, aloof from the world, they flatter themselves that they are going to develop a new character in human nature and society . With no practicable ideas of business or mechanical arts, they are going to compete with shrewd individual genius and enter- prise." More attuned to the tradition was Abraham Lincoln who was himself an inventor and a lawyer for inventors. He lectured on inventions and argued that invention was the source of American supremacy. And the inventions came from labor, from</page><page sequence="25">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 27 which all human comforts and necessities were drawn. There existed-and rightly so-a "certain relation between capital and labor .... That men who are industrious, and sober, and honest in the pursuit of their own interests should after a while accumu- late capital, and after that should be allowed to enjoy it in peace, and also if they should choose when they have accumulated it to use it to save themselves from actual labor and hire other people to labor for them is right." There was, said Lincoln, no permanent class of hired laborers: "The hired laborer of yester- day, labors on his own account today, and will hire others to labor for him tomorrow. Advancement-improvement in condi- tion-is the order of things in a society of equals." Industrial capitalists, who were themselves exponents of and proponents of the artisan tradition, were willing to place their entire reliance on the social theory which Lincoln advanced, and believed that the reorganization and regeneration of society could spring from more and better machines. They sponsored inven- tions and, in time, subsidized scientific research in universities in hopes that the processes of invention and mechanization would be speeded. Yet, at the same time, other men of the artisan tradi- tion turned to other forms of social reform-with the hammer still swimming on the top of all their ideas. The Poet Whittier found a German in Pennsylvania who was "possessed with the belief that the world was to be restored to its Paradisial state by the sole agency of mechanics." He proposed to create huge steam engines, "Niagaras of waterpower, windmills with sail- broad oars like those of Satan in Chaos," with which he would level out hills and valleys, uproot forests, drain swamps, cool the tropics with ice from the poles, and dot the ocean with artificial islands. All he needed was three thousand dollars and ten years' time! Human happiness would inevitably follow upon this geo- graphical rearrangement. For some groups in the artisan tradition, faith in the automatic regeneration of society through mechanization dimmed in the decades after the Civil War. By virtue of the very tools which they invented, some mechanics became capitalists, and others found themselves unable to rise through individual merit. Under the analysis of the dispossessed, it seemed that obstacles of law,</page><page sequence="26">28 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY of social structure, and of the organization of industry blocked their progress. The panacea seemed to be group action against the system and group ownership of the tools of production. They began to organize. Group activity had long furnished a kind of spiritual and emotional satisfaction to mechanics. Essentially they were men of the cities, and they congregated, partly by necessity but also in part by choice, in their own communities. They lived in Little Itally, the Irish wards, or clustered about the openings of the mine shafts. The saloon was, from choice, the poor man's club. Their games, often of chance, were played around tables. They danced in dance halls, took outings at congested beaches. They joined in groups for social activities and for political action. They were often in gangs in childhood and in their adult years in Tammany, in the Ancient Order of Hibernian's, in marching clubs, 'and in labor unions. Andrew Jdhnson enjoyed gathering fellow tailors, apprentices, and companions in his tailor shop. Samuel Gompers looked back with nostalgic reminiscence to the fellow- ship of the shop wherein he rolled cigars. "I loved the freedom of that work, for I had earned the mind-freedom that accom- panied skill as a craftsman." The way of life of the artisans was communal. Their modes of thought made them respond to ap- peals for the Workers of the World to arise. They could be per- suaded to believe that there was a universal brotherhood of the working class. In the last quarter of the nineteenth century, the organization which embodied the hopes and grievances of the mechanics was the Noble Order of the Knights of Labor. Before it collapsed after the Eight Hour demonstration in 1886, it had done much to formulate in idealistic terms one aspect of the artisan tradition. The Order proposed to "make industrial worth, not wealth, the true standard of individual and national greatness" and to "secure for workers the full enjoyment of the wealth they create." Their enemy was capitalism and the capitalists. Their program called for putting a check "upon the unjust accumulation and the power for evil of aggregated wealth." Their specific demands called for national laws favoring labor and the abrogation of laws and practices benefiting capitalists. In their general political orienta-</page><page sequence="27">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 29 tion they were nationalists. They proposed national income and inheritances taxes, national postal savings banks, ownership by the national government of telegraphs and railroads. They advo- cated abolishing the national bank system, but not the substitu- tion of state banks. They envisioned a future economic system in which the tools of production and the control of the markets would be in the hands of producers' and consumers' co-operatives. Perhaps, indeed, the Knights of Labor was too noble an order for the crude and hard-bitten days of the Robber Barons. Its co-operatives failed to win a share of the national market, and its leaders, perhaps, gave too much attention to accomplishing the Order's idealistic political program. It found skilled workers not yet ready to co-operate with the unskilled. The Knights disap- peared, but they left behind a legacy of no small importance. They had given a new emphasis to one phase of the artisan tradi- tion, and they had attracted a host of liberal and humanitarian intellectuals to the idealistic cause. Even though the Knights gave way to the job conscious and realistic American Federation of Labor, a body of intellectuals, college professors of the social studies, journalists, and preachers, continued to apologize for labor, to rationalize its acts, and to clothe the tradition of the artisans in a new and idealistic rhetoric. Yet this was only one phase of the artisan tradition. Essentially, the tradition of work and of production, the belief that society could be saved by the practice of the mechanical arts, the legends of invention which were supported by the statistics of the patent office, and the established custom of looking to industrial achieve- ment for spiritual satisfaction continued. The artisan tradition was an essential part of the American heritage. Even though the artisan tradition became, in the hands of labor unions and their apologists, almost an ideological weapon of a social and economic class, these four traditions never became crystallized as embodying the social, political, or economic posi- tion of rigid economic classes in American society. Whatever their origins may have been, the traditions of the yeoman, squire, trustee, and artisan were held by rich and poor, by intellectuals and by the uneducated. They were not monolithic, or even mutually exclusive. They were traditions-ways of life and atti-</page><page sequence="28">30 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY tudes of mind-and embodied statements, beliefs, legends, and customs to which generation after generation of Americans ad- hered. Men shifted freely, almost unconsciously, from one to an- other as economic circumstance, cultural development, or even marriage and age might dictate. They had, indeed, much in com- mon-a common language (if not always a common vocabulary), common roots in Western civilization, a common literature, com- mon family institutions, and a common law. If yeomen and squires seemed to place an excessive emphasis on individual freedom, it was balanced by the group consciousness, almost the group dynamics, of artisans and trustees. The artisan glorifi- cation of inventors compared favorably with the trustee's assertion that society should be guided toward perfection by stewards of wealth and talent. Trustees and squires were committed to lead- ership, but there was no commitment in the artisan and yeoman traditions that imposed a dogma of subservience. Yeomen fol- lowed squires so long as the squires led them toward yeoman objectives; and artisans, with a belief in social betterment through mechanical progress, might follow easily the trustees in the miti- gation of social evils but could balk at the imposition of puri- tanical rules of conduct. In the long run the areas of concord between the four traditions proved to be greater than the differ- ences, and each body of legends, beliefs, statements, and customs made its distinctive contribution to American life. The process, of course, was not simple. Throughout the nine- teenth century, the medley of contention and communion pro- duced a recurrent dilemma and challenge to the American poli- tician. Since no group, representing a single tradition, had a ma- jority of the electorate, politicians sought means of appealing to groups which adhered to two or more traditions. Political par- ties, combining regional interests, faced the problem of appealing to yeomen, trustees, squires, and artisans. Jefferson and Jackson successfully united squires, yeomen, and artisans against the Federalists who lung to the trustee tradition. The Republicans appealed to the artisan, yeoman, and trustee traditions to unite against squires. The Bourbon-ridden Democrats of the 1880's united the interests of trustees and squires and regarded artisans and yeomen alike with suspicion. Populism, a movement of the</page><page sequence="29">FOUR AMERICAN TRADITIONS 31 agrarian tradition, appealed to artisans by adopting the slogans and the program of the Knights of Labor. The problem of the politician was clear: He had to appeal to men of several tradi- tions, combine them against a common enemy, and resolve the conflicts between men of different traditions among his own cohorts. Each political party became an exponent of conciliation, each party platform a formulation of compromises. The years around the beginning of the twentieth century were years of ferment and contention within each of the four traditions. Perhaps the exponents of the squire tradition were less articulate than they had been, but new writers were beginning to empha- size again the values of the squires and to justify their ways of life. The Populist movement, which sprang out of the yeoman tradition, had proved a political failure, but it continued as Bryanism in the Democratic party and La Follettism among the Republicans. The basic grievances which occa- sioned the farmers' revolt remained, and protests against them grew in number. Out of the artisan tradition, at the same time, came protests and panaceas as divergent as the writings of Henry George, Edward Bellamy, Gustavus Meyer, and Upton Sinclair, but out of it, too, came the glorification of industrial progress embodied in the social theories of Andrew Carnegie, Thomas Edison, and Henry Ford. In the line of the trustee tradition stood muckraking Puritans who were horrified that men were waxing wealthy without benevolence and with no evidence of divine election, while others among the trustees were indeed looking beyond the muck to perceive that industrial wealth was making it possible and imperative that the elected stewards should extend their horizons and create a world society which would glorify God. The twentieth century inherited the traditions of the trustees, the yeomen, the artisans, and the squires. The concepts and be- liefs, the legends and the customs of the traditions infused the institutions of America. The educational structure of the country reflected the influence of the traditions. Exponents of each tradi- tion had long insisted upon the values and virtues of education. The squires had defined the education suitable for gentlemen; the trustees had dotted the land with Calvinistic colleges to in-</page><page sequence="30">32 THE JOURNAL OF SOUTHERN HISTORY doctrinate the people with proper Protestant principles. The yeomen had echoed the squire demand for agricultural research and experimentation. The artisans had believed that education in the mechanical arts would elevate individual men and save society. By the middle of the twentieth century the schools of the United States had incorporated each demand; and the con- fusion of vocational courses, the humanities, research in physics and soils, animal husbandry, medieval history, theology, inter- national relations, law, commerce, and photography bore testi- mony to the American capacity to make adjustments and com- promises and to synthesize the traditions which entered the American heritage. The political institutions of the twentieth century gave the same reflection of the four traditions. The so-called progressive movement, which sometimes showed little regard for industrial and mechanical progress, was partly a voice of the yeoman protest and partly an expression of the trustees' compulsion to reform society. Its rhetoric and its specific panaceas were vote catch- ing devices designed to appeal to the workingmen who adhered to one phase of the artisan tradition. The New Deal enlisted the sense of personal responsibility of the squires and the reformism of the trustees. The programs of individual politicians and of political parties have sought, as did the politics of the nineteenth century, to incorporate the demands and the ideals of the four basic American traditions. The story of America has not been solely a story of political and economic conflict. Conflicts there have been, but though they have produced much violence there has been little revolu- tion. Essentially, the storv of America is the story how men of different traditions have approached the problems and the oppor- tunities of their regions, their states, and their nation. The study of their intellectual achievement is the essential problem of American history. The statements, legends, beliefs, and customs of yeomen, artisans, squires, and trustees have not only infused our institutions but have also entered into the minds of each American until we are, as Jefferson once said, all Federalists, all Republicans. We are, indeed, all yeomen, squires, artisans, and trustees.</page></plain_text>
