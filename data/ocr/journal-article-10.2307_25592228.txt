La Tour d'Aigu?s : Editions de l'Aube, 2007. Pp. 254. ISBN 9-782752-602305. 20.00 (paperback). doi:10.1017/S0007087409002064 Although historians of science try to avoid teleological accounts, the narrative of professionali zation is hard to resist. Is it not the case that, at some time in the early twentieth century at the latest, the processes of discipline-building, institutionalization, university formation and reliance on specific skills and apparatus separated professional scientists and amateurs for good? Des Sciences citoyennes? rejects this notion in a very convincing and thought-provoking way. Con centrating on natural history as a site of 'citizen science', this multidisciplinary volume, including perspectives from history and sociology of science as well as anthropological approaches, shows that the amateur has a secure place in the pursuit of scientific knowledge, even in the twenty-first century. Arguably, the issues most insistently present in the volume are to do with local knowledge. It is the specific and often unique knowledge of the plants and animals in his or her own region that sets the amateur natural historian apart from the data-collecting expert in the metropolis. Tightly linked to the issue of amateurs gathering data is the issue of trust, in particular how to control the contributions of amateurs to large fieldwork projects. Mark Barrow tells the story of the enormously successful 'Christmas Count' in the United States in the early twentieth century. Professional ornithologists trying to track the paths of migratory birds depended on the infor mation of thousands of amateurs. Where the evidence had previously taken the form of shot birds, it now shifted, thanks to the use of field glasses, to observation de visu. Yet this made it much more difficult for the professionals to determine how reliable the data gathered by the amateur ornithologists actually were. Several case studies point out that amateurs have been far more than an army of helping hands. Patrick Matagne shows how French amateur botanists around 1900 created a wealth of</page><page sequence="2">Book reviews 141 knowledge through a vast network, pursuing the ideal of a 'democratic' and 'decentralized' science. These efforts materialized in H. Coste's Flore fran?aise (1901), a magisterial work that became both very popular and a standard textbook. Covering a later period, Jenny Beckman describes the 'Linn? project' which mobilized thousands of Swedish botanists in the 1970s and 1980s. In a sense, these botanists filled the gap left by biologists increasingly moving from the field to the lab, 'deserting' natural history. Contributors also consider amateurs who pursued their own versions of what the investigation of nature should be about. It was their astrological interests which drove English artisans in the early nineteenth century to study plants with the greatest exactitude. As Anne Secord shows, they tried to 'read' the plants in order to determine their medicinal value. The precise information gathered was most valuable for the learned botanists of the time. And Lynn Nyhart identifies a 'reform movement' in natural history in Germany in the second half of the nineteenth century which became a decisive force in establishing zoos and natural-history museums. Their rep resentatives saw themselves as challenging an academic zoology which was interested only in dissecting corpses, lacking any sense of connection with the living animal. These ethologists and ecologists avant la lettre claimed to give nature back to 'the people'. Amateur discussion of how to study animals continues into the present. Looking at research on the otter, Elisabeth R?my ponders the question of what role spatial and emotional distance or closeness play in that research. The amateur observer in the field might not even get to see this extremely elusive animal and yet can build a strong personal bond. At the zoo, the animal keeper is the 'amateur', benefiting from his permanent contact with the otter. In a similar vein, Vinciane Despret looks at the animals that Konrad Lorenz (an amateur when he started his ethological studies) doted on, notably a goose and a jackdaw. Generalizing from Lorenz's successes, she argues that both affection and anthropomorphism might be useful heuristic tools. Shunned by behaviourists as unscientific, the building of a 'personal' relationship might, as both R?my and Despret argue, yield insights that could never be achieved by mere disengaged observation. Other topics are also addressed. Christophe Bonneuil and Elise Demeulenaere describe how nowadays a seed-exchanging network of French farmers breeds new lines of wheat out of old and often rare ones. This participatory plant breeding seems to be quite a successful countermodel to the spread of monocultures by the big agricultural companies, because the variety of their seeds adapts better to specific local circumstances. A counterpoint of sorts is provided, however, by Florian Charvolin's article on the recent ' Feederwatch ' programme in the United States. He reminds us that the interaction between experts and amateurs should not exclusively be seen in terms of competition or of the former imposing some kind of epistemological regime on the latter by streamlining their input. All the bird watching and botanizing in Sweden, France and the US is about spending one's leisure time in a nice way. For Mexican campesinos - the subject of a wake-up-call final chapter by Gabriela Soto-Laveaga - it is about economic survival. Her account of their search for med icinal plants in a very poor rural area of south-west Mexico shows how researchers depend on the knowledge of their local guides to lead them in the field or, more precisely, the forest. Soto Laveaga even claims that only through science do the campesinos experience how their land is being valued. So class issues are represented in the volume. Gender issues, unfortunately, fare less well. Only Pamela Henson's article on the US-based American naturalist Anna Botsford Comstock (1854-1930) - an extremely successful author, illustrator, teacher and networker who animated thousands of adults and children to study nature - deals with a female actor. Inevitably, given the volume's amateur-friendly tone, the rhetoric of participation, rectifying the balance and granting the amateurs their due has proved hard to avoid. Nevertheless this volume makes for very rewarding reading, as it raises a number of new issues, takes interesting</page><page sequence="3">142 Book reviews angles throughout and presents much original material.
