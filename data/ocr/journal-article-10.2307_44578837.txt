<plain_text><page sequence="1">DEICTIC AMBIGUITY AND AUTO-REFERENTIALITY: SOME EXAMPLES FROM GREEK POETICS CLAUDE CALAME ( Jenny Strauss Clay , translator ) The linguistic phenomenon of deixis renders possible verbal references to the space and time of, as well as to the participants in, the act of communica- tion. Deixis thus is a process belonging to the "enactment into discourse" (mise en discours ); it renders possible an extra-discursive reference that is conveyed by discursive means. The linguistic forms, mostly pronouns or adverbs, that facilitate such extra-discursive references correspond to what Emile Benveniste called "the formal apparatus of enunciation": spatial forms of "here," temporal forms of "now," and pronominal forms of "I" and "you." This means that, from the point of view of linguistics, deixis is related not only to the transition from the intra-discursive to the extra- discursive, but also to the distinction, also outlined by Benveniste, between histoire (or preferably récit) and discours. Thus while the use of forms of "F7"you" and of "here" and "now" serves to mark discours , récit , by contrast, would be characterized by the presence of forms of "he"/"she," by "there," and by the aorist. 1 We will have to return later to the relevance of this second distinction. But extra-discursive reference via deictic forms can also 1 Benveniste 1974.79-88; see also Benveniste 1966.258-66 and 237-57 for the distinction between histoire and récit. Notice, however, from the outset, that the distinction between histoire (corresponding to narrative) and discours (characterized by markers like "I," "you," "here," and "now") requires some serious qualification: see Adam, Lugrin, and Revaz 1998. 415 Arethusa 37 (2004) 415-443 © 2004 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">416 Claude Calarne have content; the pronominal designation may also be linked to indications related to the object of the enunciation itself, that is to say, the act of enunciation may be presented as a speech-act and thereby assume a pro- grammatic character. This is the case in Greek literature, especially when a poem corresponds to an act of singing and when, as a consequence, poetic recitation corresponds to the function of the poem with its contents in the "performance" itself, within the situation of an "enactment into discourse" through its execution in a song of ritual or cultic character. These strategies of enunciative auto-designation are not, however, limited exclusively to ritual poems (which are improperly classified as "lyric" poetry). In epic, for example, the introductory invocation to the Muse is frequently linked to certain auto-referential indications referring to the act of communication itself, in addition to the narrative contents commu- nicated, as, for instance, in the opening of the Iliad: "Sing, goddess, the wrath of Achilles, son of Peleus, the cursed wrath that brought innumerable griefs upon the Achaeans." The description of the general theme of the bardic recitation (the wrath of Achilles, evidently to be the unifying subject of the story to come) is accompanied by an indication of its manner of communication through an allusion to the singing of the ocoiSóç, äeiSe. Similarly, the beginning of Hesiod's Theogony ("Let us begin to sing the Muses who inhabit Helicon") describes the verbal action of singing at the very moment it is being realized. Through the coincidence of discourse and song, the invocation presents itself as a speech-act - or, rather, a song-act; it announces, through the reference to the Muses, the theme of the lengthy hymn to these goddesses. This hymn to the Muses itself forms the prelude to the théogonie poem that follows. The incipit of the Homeric Hymn to Apollo ("I will remember and not forget Apollo, the archer, who makes the gods tremble in fear") also constitutes a genuine speech-act. While announcing that the subject of the hymn is praise of Apollo, the "I" of the speaker-bard here adopts the function of poetic memory usually attributed to Mnemosyne, the mother of the Muses. Although it uses Homeric diction to introduce a number of important episodes from the biography of the god, this utterance is no less "performative" than the poetic and self-referential expression of the "I" in those compositions (improperly labeled "lyric") that belong to the genre of melic poetry.2 2 For the different types of openings in Homeric poetry, see Caíame 1995.49-86.

PRELUDE: THE PRACTICAL DEIXIS OF HESIOD'S WORKS AND DAYS This point concerning the performativity of programmatic deixis can be illustrated by an example that is more complex than it appears at first sight. In the beginning of the Works and Days of Hesiod, the narrator- speaker of the poem places the words he addresses to Perses under the patronage of the Muses and the straightening of crooked legal judgments under the control of Zeus; before addressing Perses directly, he calls on these divinities in the second person. He then abandons the mode of what Benveniste calls discours (where such addresses are required) and adopts the mode of récit. In this descriptive mode, he sketches a distinction be- tween the Eris that one ought to praise and the blameworthy Eris that one must reject (11-26).3 But through the evocation of a series of artisans engaged in a positive rivalry - which also embraces bards - the positive affirmation of the good Strife introduces a contrary verbal movement: from an assertion in the third person within a descriptive-narrative mode, to a direct address in an enunciative mode to the addressee of the poem, Perses (27).4 This new enunciative anchoring of the discourse sung by the poet links the question of Eris with the conflict that sets the narrator-speaker, probably Hesiod, in opposition to his addressee, Perses. Their quarrel must be resolved here and now (ocuGi, 35) by the two participants in the enuncia- tion, who are linked by the "we" of the verb form in the imperative subjunctive: "let's decide our quarrel" (ôiccKpivcopeGoc, 35);5 and they must resolve it through straight judgments directly inspired by the Zeus, who was evoked, then invoked, in the proem. The reference is to a situation in the past when, after the division of their inheritance between a "me" and a "you," the latter got more by flattering the kings who are always ready to "recognize this cause here" and to give their pronouncement (xfjvóe 8íkt)v éGéXouai ôiKÓaaai, 39). In reference to that past situation, the issue is, for the time being at least, about settling a dispute through poetic speech. The deictic markers presented by the sequence of poetic statements reveal that this 3 For an enunciative analysis of the prelude to the Works and Days , see Caíame 1996. 4 The generic character of the addressee of the Works and Days - although perhaps based on an historical and biographical reality - is demonstrated by Pucci 1996.200-06. Rousseau 1996.93-115, 133-42 recognizes the enunciative implications of the transitions indicated here. 5 The local sense of a')0i is explained by West 1978.150. See also Rousseau 1996.149.</page><page sequence="4">418 Claude Calarne poetic speech of settlement corresponds to the present poem, sung hic et nunc in relation to a speaker "I" and an addressee "you." With its performative value derived from the coincidence between the invitation to a judicial judgment and the poetic speech with which the speaker and his addressee are associated here and now, the poem itself represents that judgment. The direct presence and the active realization of this poetic pronouncement is reinforced by the opening invitation to the Muses to intervene "here" (ôeuxe, 2), a deictic marker involving a spatial presence, which is also found in the openings of many melic poems. In addition to the pragmatic dimension related to the practical and social effects that also play a role in narrative poems like epic, the specifically performative character of melic poems as acts of singing scarcely needs emphasis.6 Given the fact that the speaker ends by directly addressing the kings in what follows, the speech produced by the poet - which coincides with the Works and Days itself - could offer a substitute for the judgment that the kings are supposed to pronounce. However that may be, the poem does constitute the necessary foundation for such a judgment.7 Attached to the situation of enunciation by various deictic forms that define the "here," the "now," and the persons engaged in the exchange, the first part of the Works and Days , before the lengthy "myths," also points by means of deictic markers to its enunciative content: the performance of the poem. Its "utter- ance" corresponds to a 8íkt| and amounts to "pronouncing a verdict" (39).8 The poetic function of the Works and Days thus fulfills itself in this (sung) juridical sentence. AÍKT1 is modified by oôe (rrļvSe 8íkt1v); the function of this deictic marker is not limited to pointing to the poem itself as a juridical sentence corresponding to a judgment in the case at hand. In addition to this extra- discursive sense, there is also an intra-discursive reference through the use of anaphora: the demonstrative rrļvSe also refers to the performative speech act of the verdict itself (ôiaicpivcbpeGa, 35), which is supposed to settle the dispute with one of the straight judgments inspired by Zeus. This mode of 6 For the deictic sense of Ôeôxe and for its use in melic poetry, see Caíame 1998a. We will here adhere to the strict definition of the "performative" elaborated, from the point of view of the "utterance," by Benveniste 1966.267-76; for Greek poetics, the reader can also refer to the additional remarks in Calarne 1999.125-28. 7 See also the interpretations, in part divergent, in Nagy 1990a.63-67 and Rousseau 1996.149-50. 8 On this sense of xf|vôe ôíktjv ôiráaaai, see West 1978.152.</page><page sequence="5">Deictic Ambiguity and Auto-Referentiality: Some Examples 419 reference within the discourse is already actualized at the beginning of the poem by the expression "Epiç îj8e (24); it refers to the good Strife, whose operation the poem has already described, and to the practical conditions for its realization. On the other hand, the reference through the use of a&gt;8e to the disputes and unjust acts that Perses will not be able to repeat (ooi 8' oukéxi Seúxepov ëoxai á&gt;8' ëpSeiv, 34-35) evidently refers to a reality external to the one constructed within the text. Nevertheless, in a secondary sense, the deictic marker that modifies the good Eris also seems to refer to the positive rivalry - the good Eris - toward which Perses is urged in the situation of communication; and inversely, "to act in this manner here" refers to the description and reproaches that precede within the text itself. Later, when the discourse is again addressed directly to Perses after the three narratives, 8iicr| is viewed in more general terms as justice in opposition to immoderation (ußpiv, 213): in some cases, this notion of moderation is left undefined (8íkt1 8' urcèp üßpioq ïa%ei, 217); in others, it corresponds to an anthropomorphic figure (xf1ç 8è Aíicriç pó0oç, 220); or, on occasion, it surfaces in the plural to represent straight (or crooked) judg- ments (okoàit1ç 8è 8íiqiç, 221); or, finally, it is reduced to an adjective, sometimes also in the neuter plural, that represents the concept (SimíoD, 226). So when the speaker's commands concerning the means of realizing 8ÍKT1 are no longer addressed to Perses but to the kings, the deictic xr|v8e, referring to the justice that they, too, must take into consideration (KaTcuppócÇeoGe, 248), refers intra-discursively to 8íkt|'s just-described general functioning. At the end of the discussion, however, after a fresh invitation to the kings to consider everything that has been said (xauxa, 263), the use of xf|v8£ (269) to designate the 8(ioļ controlled by the omniscient gaze of Zeus can also refer to the present state of justice. The extra-discursive reference to the communicative situation, emphasized by the particularizing particle Kai ("this justice here as well," 269), is rendered more likely by the speaker's forceful interruption in the first person, with a direct reference to the present situation (vûv Sf| éyco, 270). This is followed by a fresh appeal to Perses (274) summarizing the argument for justice, "by far the greatest good," and a lengthy discussion of its corollary: prosperity through work. The realiza- tion of justice has its proper place: the city (rcótaç, 269), which is well represented by the return to "this justice here" in the hie et nunc of the enunciative communication. With its double (intra- and extra-discursive) reference to what has been constructed within the poetic discourse and to the actual circumstances</page><page sequence="6">420 Claude Calarne of communication, the first section of the Works and Days is self-enclosed. Through the medium of poetry, the speech-act possesses a content: poetic speech promotes the realization of S(kt| within the polis, specifically within the exact circumstances under which it is formulated. Within the dialectic between its effective realization as a concrete judgment in the present situation and the more general discussion concerning the realization of the justice of Zeus in the human city, the poem, despite its Homeric diction, nevertheless fully inscribes itself within the didactic genre.9 As we will see, because of such programmatic and self-referential deixis between intra- and extra-discursive levels, the traditional distinction between histoire/récit and discours will turn out to be especially porous. II. SELF-REFERENCE AND PROGRAMMATIC DEIXIS Actually, the essential distinction is not exactly between the "I/ you /hic/nunc" of the discours and the "he/she/there/then" of the narrative, but between demonstratio ad oculos and Deixis am Phantasma. The distinc- tion goes back to the German linguist Karl BUhler. If the first defines the Zeigfeld of language from the point of origin represented by "here," "now," and "I," {das Hier-Jetz-Ich System , apparently equivalent to discours ), the second, in appealing psychologically to the inner eye and ear of the reader and hence to his imagination {Phantasie), defines the symbolic field {das Symbolfeld) of all language (apparently a more general equivalent of histoire). The phenomena of anaphora and cataphora, whereby a deictic marker may also refer to something already mentioned or about to be mentioned within an enunciation, however, adds the possibility of symbolic reference to the (extra-discursive) reality of the act of enunciation. Bühler notes that, in referring to what has already been mentioned within a discourse, the deictic pronouns used are generally those also employed in demonstratio ad oculos : "Ich kann ad oculos demonstrieren und in der situationsfernen Rede dieselben Zeigwörter anaphorisch gebrauchen."10 This means that, especially in the Indo-European languages, the demonstratives appropriate to demonstratio ad oculos (in the domain of discours) can also refer to that which is internal 9 For the Works and Days as a didactic poem, see West 1978.33-40. One may note that, at line 276, for example, xóvÔe vópov has a cataphoric function. 10 Bühler 1965 [1934].79-82, 107-13, 121-40, and 385-92 (pages 80 and 286 for the quotations).

It is worth recalling here that, in the section of his Syntax that dealt with pronouns, the second century a.D. grammarian Apollonius Dyscolus already distinguished between pronouns with an anaphoric function and those with a deictic function. While the former resemble the article and are identified with pronominal forms of the third person, the latter tend espe- cially to employ pronouns of the first and second person. Whether or not we are dealing here with a double assimilation that appears to anticipate the distinction between histoire/récit and discours , Apollonius does recognize that third-person pronouns like éiceîvo ç, outoç, and oôe may have either an anaphoric or a deictic function. This fundamental distinction led the Greek grammarian to outline a clear separation between visual deixis or "deixis of sight" (ôeî^iç TT1Ç oyecoç) and mental deixis or "deixis of the mind" (ôeî^iç TOU VOÎ)).11 It is precisely this double possibility of external and internal refer- ence that is exploited through the use of o6e in the first section of Hesiod's Works and Days. Even while pointing to what is external to the discourse, the process of demonstratio ad oculos can also refer both to what precedes in the discourse itself as well as to what follows, that is, to what has been constructed within the text, thanks to Deixis am Phantasma. Thus the distinction outlined by Benveniste between histoire/récit and discours has to be understood from the perspective of reference: that is, reference can be simultaneously intra- and extra-discursive for the discours as well as for the histoire/récit. Such ambiguity reveals the porousness of a distinction whose character is essentially operational. Thus from the perspective of deixis and the use of deictic markers, the distinction between reference to the situation of enunciation and refer- ence to the internal context becomes essential: the first involves a link to the extra-discursive situation of the communicative discourse, while the other offers the possibility of intra-discursive reference to the features presented within the utterance itself (whether in the category of récit or of discours). The anaphoric use of certain deictic forms situates the enunciation at the 1 1 Apollonius Dyscolus Syntax 1.96, 2.1 1-17, and the commentary of Mársico 2000.82-92.

Once again, we find that discours and récit constitute essentially permeable categories. By means, moreover, of a deictic marker such as oôe in Greek that simultaneously embraces contextual proximity and situational reference, a speech-act may acquire a double referential function. Thus "these" words may refer anaphorically or cataphorically to the situation constructed within the text (whether oral or written); but "these" statements, whether a poem, a hymn, a choral song, or a judgment, insofar as they are performative statements, may also refer to the immediate performance situation - as is, in fact, the case in the first part of Hesiod's Works and Days. As the deictic of Hierheit , of nearness, oôe implies a focalization on the "I" of the speaker, that is, on the moment of enunciation as the point of transition between the intra- and extra-discursive.13 Hence, when the poetic enunciation is under- taken by an "I," it constitutes an "auto-reference." But such self-referentiality also functions with regard to the enunciative sphere that is constructed within the discourse, i.e., Deixis am Phantasma , and in reference to the act of singing in the situation of the extra-discursive enunciation through demonstratio ad oculos.u 12 Nyckees 1998.242-50 carefully distinguishes the situational and the contextual references of a certain number of pronouns, depending on their deictic or anaphoric use. In these cases, Adam 1990.52-61 prefers to oppose the contextual use ("deictic referentialisation") to the co-textual use (demonstrative anaphora) of certain demonstratives. 13 While affirming that oôe designates an object as near and forming part of the " sphere of interest" of the speaker , Humbert 1960.29-31 places more emphasis on the deictic character rather than on the anaphoric or cataphoric function of this demonstrative pronoun or adjective; see also Biraud 1991.190-92. 14 For the double dimension, contextual and situational, intra- and extra-discursive, of, for example, choral auto-reference, see Calarne 1999.130-32 and Bierl 2001.37-64, after Henrichs 1994-95.56-73. In distinguishing "exophoric" reference (extra-linguistic) from "endophoric" reference (anaphoric), Danielewicz 1990.9-17 recognizes the deictic spatio- temporal role of oôe in choral "lyric." Felson 1999.1-5 gives a good summary of this issue.</page><page sequence="9">Deictic Ambiguity and Auto-Referentiality: Some Examples 423 It is this ambiguity of reference that I intend to explore in the programmatic and self-referential designation of poems that constitute com- municative acts of song. I begin, then, with some examples drawn from the performative poetry par excellence, Greek melic poetry. III. MELIC POEMS AND ELEGIAC COMPOSITIONS: "PERFORMATIVE" EFFECTS Despite a problematic text, Aleman, fragment 39 (Page-Davies), can provide our first example of an apparent double reference - anaphoric (or cataphoric) and deictic - of the demonstrative oSe accompanied by a programmatic reference and hence performative.15 In the famous "signa- ture" where he presents himself with his name in the third person, the Spartan poet lays claim to inventing (eupe) two of the three traditional components of melic poetry in archaic Greece: song and music (to which one must add dance).16 If the musical dimension of pé^oç derives its mimetic source of inspiration in the song of the partridge, the verbal component is perhaps alluded to in the phrase pénr' xá8e, referring both to what has just been sung (or is about to be sung) and to its poetic enunciation as a speech-act: an act of singing, presumably choral singing. By joining the TotSe, which can function both anaphorically and deicticly, to the term f ércri, which designates rhythmic speech in general, Aleman asserts the poetic character of his "invention" in the performative mode. But the sentence containing that assertion is not only formulated in the third person but also in the aorist (eupe, "he found"), in accordance with the tradition of the G(ppr|YÍç, "seal" or "signature." The gesture of "enactment into discourse" is uttered in the mode of histoire/récit - a first sign of the permeability of both of Benveniste's categories. IILi. Theognis and Authorial Self-Designation But this phenomenon can be more precisely defined. In a well- known sequence of elegiac couplets placed within the earlier sections that 15 In the light of oôe in both its ana- and cataphoric usage, I would be inclined to reconsider the reading I proposed in Caíame 1983.480-81 and affirm the attractiveness of the correction xáÔe proposed by Emperius in 1835 in place of ye ôe (probably Ôé ye) of MS A of Athenaeus. Cf. the ap. crit of fragment 91 in Calarne 1983.116-17. 16 On the use of ocppriyíç, see Van Groningen 1966.19 and 446-49; also Calarne 1995.25 and 49-50.</page><page sequence="10">424 Claude Calarne make up the collection of the Theognidea, the Megarian poet explicitly demonstrates the functioning of the "signature." In turning to his young addressee and recipient Cyrnos, the elegiac poet not only demands - in an impersonal passive construction - that a seal (otppTiyíç, 19) be placed on the present verses (xoîoô' ërceoiv, 20) to prevent their modification; he also quotes the contents of the oíppíiyíç itself so as to insert this text into the mouth of anyone who enunciates it. He thereby exploits a strategy reminis- cent of those inscriptions that invite the passer-by to read their contents aloud:17 "Thus (cbôe) anyone can assert: 'Here are (coxiv, 22) the enrri, the rhythmic words, of Theognis of Megara, famous among all men.'"18 The controversy surrounding these lines, which are especially dense and complex from an enunciative perspective, has focused on the meaning and referent of the oípprjyíç. Readers have taken it to refer either to the name Cyrnos itself - whose name in the vocative would presumably guarantee authenticity - or to the whole eight-line passage that forms the context of the quotation identifying Theognis; or, more generally, to the elegiac style or the political teaching characteristic of the poet. But in any case, it has usually been taken as a reference to the name of the Megarian poet. He is, in fact, presented within the passage through his civic identity, that is, precisely by his name joined to his birthplace and city of residence. As a "seal of authenticity" and mark of "authorship," the G(ppr)yíç may, as has recently been suggested, refer to the book produced by the written transcription of Theognis' verses that were originally intended for oral performance at the symposium. Perhaps then the "signature" lays claim to ownership of the verses inscribed on the papyrus roll intended for publica- tion, or it signals the dedication in a temple of a copy thus identified and, in some sense, transformed into a pviļļioc.19 Now in tracing the enunciative progress of this elegiac collection, we must first realize that the anaphoric and deictic o8e does not modify the verses (£7rr|, 22) mentioned in the otppriyię, but, instead, the verses (erceoiv, 20) on which the seal is to be placed. Since the elegiac couplet in lines 19-20 represents the beginning of a poem, xoîoô' must, on the basis of context, 17 Cf. Svenbro 1988.13-33 and 53-73. 18 The expression ëaxiv simply indicates the presence, and hence the existence, of the verses of Theognis: cf. Kühner and Gerth 1898.1.3 and 38. 19 For these different interpretations, see Edmunds 1997.30-33; see, in addition, the references in Cerri 1991.21-22, who mentions several examples of poetic compositions consecrated at sanctuaries. Cf. also Ford 1985.92-95.</page><page sequence="11">Deictic Ambiguity and Auto-Referentiality: Some Examples 425 here have a cataphoric sense and thus designate the lines that immediately follow. These lines embrace not only the statement of the otppîiyiç (which would be tautological), but also the elegiac couplets that introduce and comment on it, including those that follow and formulate (in a fresh address to Cyrnos) the pedagogical mission of the speaker. By using the performative future, "I will teach you (the things I learned while still an adolescent") (')7īo0fļaoļLiai, 27), the speaker offers a fresh indication of the programmatic contents of a poetic progression embraced by the term etch, but from which nothing must be omitted or modified.20 In addition, however, to the cataphoric use of the expression xoîcô' erceoiv, there is a possible deictic reference to the situation of enunciation. Such a usage frequently occurs at the beginning of other groups of lines within the same collection. For example, the city in which both the speaker and his addressee Cyrnos are located is designated by tcóAaç qôe ("this city here," 39), with a repetition in ring composition at the end of the section at line 52; it stands in opposition to Keivrļv rcóAiv, "that city there," i.e., the unjust city of line 47. Similarly, line 53 (ttóXei xpôe, cf. 56) is taken up again by xcovSe ocoxcov, ("these citizens here," 61). The focus is more on the city that constitutes the political and pragmatic framework for the poetic and pedagogical advice of Theognis to Cyrnos (an extra-discursive reference) than on the polis that the lines describe (an intra-discursive reference). From this perspective, it is worth emphasizing that the placing of a o(ppîiyiç generally serves the interests of the speaker: the speaker refers to himself in this present exercise of his poetic skill (ooípiÇopévcp èpoí, 19).21 This actualization of the poetic skill of the speaker provides a pragmatic definition of "these verses" (xoîoô' ërceoiv, 20), while creating an opposi- tion between the present moment of poetic activity and a future one when the verses could be modified. It is in that proximate future that "anyone" (and not only Cyrnos) will be obliged to pronounce the words of the ocppriYÍç, introduced by the cataphoric and deictic o8e (22). At that point, the 20 For parallels for the use of imoGfiaopai, see Van Groningen 1966.21-22.

Spoken together in the present of a sung performance and rendered objective as text, these lines are the ones that will be able to confer on Theognis, henceforth identified extra- discursively, the fame among men that he deserves at each performance of the poem. The acppriyíç gives the elegiac couplets the authority of a poet's voice and name. The words of the ocppriyíç itself, however, situated between histoire / récit and discours , give no indication of the written or oral status of the enr' of Theognis. We only know that the statement's realization - and hence the fame of the poet - will depend on who pronounces it.22 For now, in his renewed address to Cyrnos-Polypaides and by referring to the particular situation it implies, the speaker begins again (ourcco Sóvapai, 24) by indi- cating that, like Zeus with his rain, he, too, cannot "please all the citizens." The movement from the universal - mankind in general (mvxaç kocx' àvGpcojcouç, 23) - to particular citizens (àaxoíow rcaoiv, 24; cf. oi)0' . . . mvxeaa', 26) indicates a return from an ideal (imagined?) future to the reality of the present political situation. Under these special enunciative and deictic conditions, the atppriyíç seems to entail a poetic strategy that is, in the final analysis, quite different from the one that endows funerary monuments or votive dedications with speech. But the metaphoric character of the o&lt;ppr|yíç does not preclude the possibility that, in opposition to the enunciative situation of the lines that cite it at the very beginning of the Theognidea , a concrete realization may be assigned to it a posteriori through the written transcription of the collection and its ritual dedication in a sanctuary. Just like the end of the poetic encomium of Polycrates (frag.

Pindar and the Choral Performance of the Komos At the end of the opening strophe of Olympian 4 celebrating the Olympic victory of Psaumis of Camarina in Sicily, the speaker asks Zeus, who was invoked at the beginning of the ode, to receive "this procession" (xóvôe Kcopov, 9): the victorious procession at Olympia, "venerable light of mighty exploits." This statement sets up the programmatic content of the poem. Through the use of the deictic o8e, this festive procession is linked not only to the song of Olympian 4 in the hie et nunc of the communicative situation, but also, by means of anaphora, to the speaker who presents himself as the messenger and witness to the greatest rewards of victory (p' ejcepvļ/av / biļiTļ^otaiiov pápxup' àéGXxov, 2-3).24 There is an obvious contradiction between a poem that is presented enunciatively as a processional song enacted in the hie et nunc of its performance by a group of dancers with the accompaniment of the Charités and one in which a speaker presents himself in the singular as witness and messenger of the Hours, whom Zeus has roused to action. This remarkable enunciative polyphony is situated between intra- and extra-discursive dis- course. The linking of the Hours to the Graces in the celebration of a processional and, apparently, choral song is not surprising to a reader of archaic Greek poetry. The daughters of Zeus and Themis, who represent the seasons, collaborate with their cousins, the Graces, in the retinue of Aphrodite in order to deck out Hesiod's Pandora or to create the seductive garments worn by Aphrodite herself in the Cypria. Moreover, in the Homeric Hymn to Apollo , they, along with Harmonia, Hebe, and Aphrodite, take part in the choral dances (opxeûvx', "they dance," 196) that accompany the songs of the Muses.25 23 Pace Rosier 1983. 24 For the different modes of the reception of the kcojxoç presented by Pindar, cf. Mullen 1982.27-31, who concluded: "There is, then, a kind of centripetal force drawing everything into the absolute present of the ode." 25 Cf. Hesiod Works and Days 72-76 (also Theogony 901-11), Cypria frag. 4 Bernabé, and the Homeric Hymn to Apollo 189-96 (see also the much later Orphic Hymn 43.5-9: KUKÂÁoiat xopoîç).

Sung by the poet himself (or his local representative), or by a group of young men or girls of the city of the victor? Without getting involved in the details of this complex issue, we note that those who support the solo performance of the Pindaric ode generally invoke the meaning of kôjioç in the classical period. Iconography, the texts of comedy, and Plato's Symposium offer numerous examples of the different forms adopted by the nocturnal processions where the citizen- guests, more or less inebriated, concluded their ritual gatherings at the symposium with music and satyr-like dancing. By means of an apparent parallel with, for example, the elegiac couplet of Theognis that states that "one of these" (tiç tcovÔe, 1045, i.e., one of the guests to whom these lines are addressed) will receive "our procession" (rļpitepov KÔpov ôé^eioci, 1046), even if he should be fast asleep, the speaker of Olympian 4 is presumed to be inviting Zeus to receive the present kÔ|lioç.26 According to this hypothesis, while performing Olympian 4 solo, the speaker, whom the supporters of monodie performance generally identify with the poet, be- comes the spokesman to Zeus of the wishes of a group of youths, perhaps the companions of Psaumis of Camarina, eager to participate in an im- promptu manner in the celebration signaled by the more formal song of the ode itself. By taking the vocabulary and the syntax of Pindar literally, such a hypothesis ignores several features related to the fictional effects of all forms of poetry, more particularly to the nature of the double reference - demonstratio ad oculos and Deixis am Phantasma - of deictic markers like bôe. First, those who advocate solo performance, generally by the poet himself who would evoke a KĆopoę for the most part external to the perform- ance of the epinician under discussion, are inclined to ignore - even while mentioning it - the use of the KĆopoę in contexts that are not sympotic but 26 Cf. especially Eubulus frag. 93 Kassel-Austin, Plato Symposium 176a-e, 212c-e, and 223b, and the references in Heath 1988.180-82; for Olympian 4, cf. 189-90. Significantly, the special situation of this ode is not discussed in the restatement by Heath and Lefkowitz 1991.</page><page sequence="15">Deictic Ambiguity and Auto-Referentiality : Some Examples 429 ritual. For example, at the beginning of Euripides' Hippolytos , Aphrodite herself identifies the famous processional song of invocation that Hippolytos and his companions dedicate to Artemis as a KĆopoę. Adopting the part of choregos, Hippolytos sings the prelude, directing his companions (erceaG' aiôovxeç . . . "Apxepiv, "follow, while celebrating . . . Artemis," 58-60) to join in a song, accompanied by dance, and performed by the "we" of the collective group (petaSpeaOa, 60). Marked by the choral "I," and in a complex Aeolic rhythm that is surely not improvised, this short ritual hymn accompanies the ritual gesture of a dedication of a garland of flowers to Artemis (xóvôe rcXeicxóv, 73).27 At the end of the Bacchae , however, it is the chorus itself, while hymning Dionysos in unison (ava^opeuacoļiEv Bcxkxiov, 1153), that invites its own members - with a self-referential gesture com- mon to the choral songs of tragedy - to receive the KĆopoę of the god of euoî. In a performative mode signaled by the use of the future, the followers of Dionysos do, in fact, receive (ôé^ojiai, 1 172) Agave, who, as a participant in the KĆopoę (aúyKcopov, 1 172), divides her lines, sung in dochmiacs, between an "I" and a "we."28 With its parody of a most accomplished hymnie choral song, the Thesmophoriazousai provides corroborating evidence from comedy. In Aristophanes' staging, the tragic author of this ritual choral song of praise for Apollo, Artemis, and their mother Leto performs the role of chorodida- skalos. Disguised as a woman, Agathon urges the young xopeuxoci to sing and dance as a chorus (%ope')oaa0e, 103) "this" hymn, which he designates by the Homeric deictic ó, as a KĆopoę (104). Then in the role of Koptxpocîoç, he sings, along with the young Trojan women, a hymnie song that he is supposed to have composed in choriambic rhythm. Finally, the Muses are invoked to lend their voices to the execution of this hymn before the Xopeuxai themselves take up the song, alternating between forms of "I" and "we."29 In this parody of a ritual song, the comic genre may invite us to discern the most unbridled development of the sympotic KĆopoę, to which the choral songs of comedy are often assimilated. Nevertheless, the same term 27 See the relevant comments of Barrett 1964.167-71, who expresses no doubts about the choral character of the hymn for which Hippolytus plays the role of e^apxeov. 28 Cf. Henrichs 1994-95.73-85 for additional examples of a tragic chorus using an auto- referential designation to indicate the activity of the cult song in which the chorus members are engaged. 29 See Bierl 2001.162-74 for a detailed analysis of this parodie song, as well as Bierl 2001.140-50 for lines 969-1000, and 31 1-14, on the comic KĆopoę.</page><page sequence="16">430 Claude Calarne KÔpoç reappears at the end of the play, in the mouth of the chorus of women celebrating the Thesmophoria, to designate, in a self-referential and per- formative manner, their own choral dances in honor of Dionysos (syci) 8e Kcopoiç / oe (piXoxópoioi petaļ/co, 987-88). It is thus not at all surprising to see the Alexandrian commentators, and consequently the scholiasts to Pindar, regularly gloss the term KĆopoę and its compounds by the term %opóç and its derivatives. Such a definition is particularly relevant to Nemean 9, which begins with a request to the Muses to come from Sicyon to Etna and join the speaker, designated as "we." The latter is identical to the choral processional group that arrives at the house of the victor to perform a "sweet hymn" (eke cdv y^uKÙv opvov rcpáaaexe, 3). As a result, presumably because it links the Muses in the act of singing to the performative future in the first-person plural, the form Kcopaaopev that begins the ode (1) is interpreted by the ancient commentators as a synonym of %opet&gt;ocopev and upveoocopev. Moreover, even in Olympian 4, the reception in Camarina (or perhaps still in Olympia?) of the messenger-poet by the "better men" (eotan, 5) on the occasion of the victory of the athlete (who has become the host of the speaker), is interpreted by the scholiast in terms of a choral celebration Ocopco Tļ8exai). "This komos here," which Zeus himself is asked to receive, corresponds to this same celebration.30 The most decisive argument, however, against solo performance as far as Olympian 4 is concerned can doubtlessly be made on the basis of the double reference implied by the use of the deictic xóv5e modifying KÔpov in Olympian 4.9. From an extra-discursive perspective, the situational refer- ence of this deictic marker can only be the song composed by Pindar and performed in the hie et nunc of the victory celebration at Camarina (or perhaps Olympia).31 But on the intra-discursive level, the anaphoric and hence contextual usage of the same phrase, xóvSe KÔpov, can refer to the processional aspect of the present KĆopoę via two convergent trajectories: the journey of the speaker, sent (p' ērcepiļ/av, 2; note the aorist) by the Hours, daughters of Zeus, as a witness to accompany the Graces to Zeus himself, the host par excellence (ôe^ai, 9, in the present imperative); and the arrival 30 Cf. scholia ad Pindar Nemean 9. lab (III. 150 Drachmann) and ad Olympian 4.7b (1.131 Drachmann). Despite their skepticism about the equivalence of KĆopoę and x°póç, Heath and Lefkowitz 1991.175 cite the corresponding passages from the scholia. For the "performative" character of forms of the auto-referential future, see Slater 1969b. 31 For the controversial question concerning the place of performance of Olympian 4, see Gerber 1987.7-9; for the metrical structure of the poem, see Lomiento 1999.</page><page sequence="17">Deictic Ambiguity and Auto-Refe rentiality: Some Examples 43 1 (iK£i, 10, in the present) of the victor, crowned at Olympia (axetpavcoGeíç, 11, aorist participle) and now eager (arceuóei, 12, in the present) to deck the city of Camarina with glory. Because of the confluence of this double trajectory, the KÔpoç can transform itself into the truthful praise of both the great accomplishment and the hospitality of the victor.32 To refer the performatives of the first-person singular of this sec- ond strophe of Olympian 4 not only to a solo performance but also to the biographic and historical Pindar himself would entail ignoring the enunciative density that poetic creativity constructs through its own fictional capacities. Endowed with an existence that is at first glance textual, the "I" of the performative "I praise" (aiveco, 14) and "I will not tinge my praise with falsehood" (oí) 'j/eu8eï xey^co Àóyov, 17-18) corresponds first and foremost to an idealized textual figure. This moment of enunciation is activated by a poetic and polyphonic voice through which the voices of the Hours, the Graces, and, also, the voice of the kcû|lioç in its collective character converge. This moment is prior to the extra-discursive reference to the person of the poet, who presumably does not himself make the journey to Camarina to sing the song he has composed. In ascribing the textual fiction constructed around the moment of enunciation directly to the person of the poet while, at the same time, identifying him with the performance of his composition, we overlook the subtle play of "choral delegation." This complex interplay constitutes the defining characteristic of the enunciation uttered in the various genres of melic poetry as well as its transference to the tragic stage, both in reference to the discursive and enunciative reality of a poem and in the social reality of its "performance."33 IILiii. Some Additional Examples Additional evidence is provided by the second epinician composed by Pindar for the same Sicilian athlete, probably on the occasion of a second Olympic victory in the mule race (this one certainly celebrated at Camarina). 32 For the complex interactions of hospitality in Pindar's epinicians, see Kurke 1991.135-59 and 203-1 1; also the parallels in Mader 1990.35-41.

Through the dual function of oôe, it is first the citizen body (xóvôe ôapov aaxcov, 14) that Athena, invoked in the vocative, will engulf with the light emanating from the praise sung on the heights of the city. Secondly, with the help of Zeus Soter, the city itself (noXxv . . . xávôe, 20) will be adorned by the presence of glorious men. The deictic oôe, simultaneously anaphoric and referential, involves the whole of the city in the effects of the song with which, in the hie et nunc of its enunciation, the victor himself is linked. To hear only the single voice of Pindar in his identity as a Theban poet, adopting the role of a suppliant of Zeus to the accompaniment of Lydian flutes (iicéxaç aeGev ëpxopai Auôíoiç árcúcov év aùÀxnç, 19), is to miss the complex enunciative polyphony whereby Psaumis appears simultaneously (indirectly) in the role of the speaker and (directly) in the role of addressee.34 Used, then, like a genuine formula in the manner of Homer, the invitation, "receive this KĆopoę," can even be addressed to the site of Olym- pia itself, transformed into "the mother of games" (Maxep . . . àéGAcov, OuA/opma . . . xóvôe kcojiov . . . ôé^ai, 1-10) in Olympian 8. But despite this opening, the progress of the ode, composed for an Aeginetan wrestler, distances us from the sanctuary by the Alpheus and transports us to the island of Aegina, designated deictically on two occasions (xcxvô' . . . %cópocv, "this place," 25; ôeôp', "here," 51). Offered to Olympia in exchange for the prize of victory and hence for the glory conferred by this "mistress of truth," the ode, accompanied by a oxeqxxvotpopia and probably by a chorus, is performed at the victor's homeland.35 Similarly, in Pythian 5, the addressee of the poem, King Arcesilas IV of Cyrene, who financed the victorious chariot, receives the processional song in Cyrene; here, the kôjioç includes the group of men who perform it (ôeôe^ai xóvôe kcojiov ávepcov, "receive this KCÒ1IOÇ of men," 22). Performing at Cyrene itself, beside the garden of Aphrodite, the young men (év àoiôa vécov, 103) celebrate the legendary history of their prosperous colony. The poem itself turns out to be dedicated to Apollo, worshiped both in Delphi and at Cyrene, probably on the occa- 34 Cf. Danielewicz 1990.13-14.

With its enunciative shift from an "I" to a "we" that unites the voice of the poet, in his Theban identity, with the voices of the young men celebrating Apollo Carneios at a feast held in Cyrene itself, Pythian 5 provides one of the most subtle examples of the lyric, and subsequently tragic, phenomenon of "choral delegation."36 It is, however, Olympian 14 that offers the most convincing ex- ample of the phrase xóv8e Kcopov in what is apparently a choral context. Composed for the victory in the footrace of an athlete from Orchomenos, this poem has the form of a prayer spoken by a speaker "I" (eū%oļioci, 5) and addressed to the Graces. These three "much-sung queens" (ocoíóipoi ßocoitaioci, 3) were venerated in this small town with its famous cult.37 With the tri-partite structure ( invocado , epica lausy preces) characteristic of every cult hymn, the poem emphasizes the musical character of the three sisters, whose redende Namen are linked to two epithets containing peAji- (&lt;piÀr|aí|iotai£, 14; épaaípoÀjce, 16). Without their presence, the gods could not conduct their feasts or their choral dances (%opo'&gt;ç, 9). It is within this context that, in the transition from epic praise to the prayer itself, the present poem, designated as xóvSe KÓopov, is offered to the sight and hearing of the Graces. Although it refers to the epinician - probably sung by a chorus on the occasion of one of the festivals for the local Graces - the term encapsu- lates the musical skills of the daughters of Zeus even as it endows the performative act of singing with a processional character. This is confirmed by the expression, "I have come to sing" (oceíôcov ejio^ov, 18), that seems to unite both the poet and the performers in a single choral voice. The programmatic dimension of the act of singing, in conjunction with the deictic gesture implied by the use of o8e, draws attention to the topos of "choral preparation," especially when the poem designated by o8e forms the object of an invitation to receive (ôé^ai, etc.) the chorus. As early as Aleman, the chorus frequently situates the performance of its song in the 36 The cultic occasion of the performance of Pythian 5 can be reconstructed with reasonable certainty: cf. Gentili, Angeli-Bernardini, Cingano, and Giannini 1995.59-64, 517-18, and 521-23, with bibliography concerning the identity of the "F7"we" speaker of this epinician.

But it also constitutes a means of indicating both the preparations for, and the destination of, the epinician ode. As for the poet himself, he evidently did not on every occasion have the opportunity to travel in order to assume in person - as chorodidaskalos or choregos - the rehearsal and di- rection of the chorus. Even though it is incorrect to refer the "I" of the speaker to Pindar in a biographical sense, the supporters of solo perform- ance are to a certain extent justified in drawing attention to the possibilities of the execution of the song by the equivalent of a choregos or Kopixpocîoç accompanied by a chorus in the manner, for example, of a KiGapcoôía.39 The essential point is to distinguish the enunciative figures constructed within the text, especially through an implied analogy, from historical characters taking on, in the plural and in its different phases, the sung performance of the ritual. IV. INTERLUDE: CHORAL DEIXIS AND TRAGEDY From Aleman to the tragedians - but especially in Anacreon and Sappho - the activation of programmatic deixis, linked to a self-referential or performative verbal gesture, refers to the contents of the poem itself. This is particularly true when the composition begins with an expression like brjuxe. In its deictic function, the 8fļ anchors the poetic speech act - usually self-referential - in the hie et nunc of the performance, while the ocuxe, for its part, refers anaphorically to a repeated situation. The gesture of enunciative auto-referentiality is a double one, a double movement of extra-discursive 38 In addition to the passages mentioned, see also Pindar Olympian 6.98 and 13.29, Pythian 8.18-20 (cf. Martin in this volume), and Nemtan 4.11. For the Pindaric sense of compounds of KĆopoę, see Heath 1988.187, along with the remarks of Bremer 1990.50-57, who argues for an overall choral interpretation of the epinicians. 39 Cf. Heath 1988.197: "Commissioned processionals may have been sung on occasion, sometimes solo, and sometimes perhaps by the kômos as a whole"; and Lefkowitz 1995.149: "But Pindar uses the language of the games to describe his own poetic skill . . . For that reason he can seem at times to be a member of the victory kômos or virtually a citizen of communities." Note, however, the much more emphatic position expressed by Heath and Lefkowitz in their joint statement of 1991.191: "The victory ode is sung by the poet to the lyre." For the odes of Bacchylides, see D'Alessio in this volume.</page><page sequence="21">Deictic Ambiguity and Auto-Referentiality: Some Examples 435 reference and of intra-discursive anaphora. This repetition, in the sense of a "re-enactment," usually refers to the intervention of Eros with his frequently contradictory effects upon the speaking "I This deictic and anaphoric usage gives the poem that is being sung its programmatic function; simulta- neously, through this double verbal gesture, the poem assumes a pragmatic dimension, often achieved in the performative act of singing that its execu- tion represents. Thus one of the choral groups taught by the Spartan poet Aleman sings: "Once again, here and now, Eros, by the will of the Cyprian, warms my heart that he softly penetrates."40 In the choral parts of tragedy, when different kinds of péAoç are enacted and dramatized on the skene of the theater of Dionysos, the combi- nations of anaphora/cataphora and deictic markers become more complex insofar as the sphere of reference is doubled. In effect, deictic forms can refer to the action enacted on the stage and the space and time of the historic ritual performance involving both author and audience. Thus in the Eumênides of Aeschylus, the use of o8e to refer cataphorically and programmatically to the hymn intended to bind Orestes (upvov S' ccKoócrri xóvôe ôéopiov aé0ev, 306) is immediately followed by a performative act: the choral song that is intended to function as a spell is introduced by the performative phrase, "come now, let's form the chorus" (aye 5q ^opov aiļ/eopev, 307). This deictic gesture, simultaneously contextual and situational, is enacted on the stage in the hie et nunc of the dramatic action. Addressed to the mother of the goddesses of revenge, this "magic hymn" (cf. upvoç . . . ôéopioç, 331-32 = 343-44) becomes in its very performance "this song" (xóôe péXoç, 329 = 341) that, as an expiatory offering to Night, offers a substitute for Orestes himself, who is under Apollo's protection.41 In this instance, the situational reference is completely subsumed in the action dramatized on stage. In the Oedipus at Colonus of Sophocles, however, the chorus chants the famous hymn to the flourishing fertility of Attica with a deictic reference that shifts from Colonus (a place represented within the drama: T&amp;oôe %cí&gt;paç, 668) of the chorus's song to the territory of Attica, which is also the space contain- ing the spectators. From a spatial perspective, the whole play from start to finish is characterized by this deictic movement from the named locations of 40 See in this connection the examples in Caíame 1998a.2 16-22, especially Aleman frag. 59(a) Page-Davies. 41 Cf.

To be sure, the funeral speech reworked by Thucydides and placed in the mouth of Pericles at the end of the first year of the Peloponnesian war contains a prelude whose enunciative mode is completely centered on the "I" of the speaker. Con- fronting the "you" of the audience viewed as each individual who makes up the whole (òjluov xfļq ekcxotod ßonAxioccix; xe Kai 8ói;r|ç xu^eiv, "to satisfy the wishes and opinions of each of you," 2.35.3), the "I" situates itself "here" (évGáôe, 2.35.1) on the podium described within the introduction to the speech, at a precise time (pe%pi . . . xoûôe, 2.35.2): "I, too, must respect the custom and try to satisfy the wishes and opinions of each of you as best I can" (ujjxov xqç emcrcoi) ßooXxioEcix; te Kai ôó^nç xu^cív, 2.35.3). The present speech is programmatically linked to the kind of speech that custom demands in these circumstances (xòv rcpooGévxa x5&gt; vópco xòv ÀxSyov xóvSc, "this speech here presented in accordance with the custom," cf. Kai épè èrcópcvov xćo vópcp, "and for me following the custom," 2.35.1 and 3). The performative effect is immediate and similar to the proem of the Theogony , but here without an invocation to the Muses: "I will begin first of all with the ancestors" (ap^opai Se arcò xcov rcpoyóvcov rcpœxov, 2.36.1). The use of the performative future with the verb that traditionally indicates an invocation in poetry recalls the introductory utterances of epic mentioned earlier. To be sure, in the sequel to the speech, the ancestors turn into "our fathers" (oi rcaxépcç fipœv, 2.36.2 and 4), in an expression that is related deictically and temporally to "we here, who are now alive" (auxoi Tipriç oïôe oí vuv £xi ovx£ç, 2.36.3). In these utterances, however, the space of the enunciation is simply designated as "the city" (xqv rcóAav, 2.36.3).43 42 xfļa6' ëôpaç (36) or xó8' aAxroç (98) at the beginning of the play designate the places on stage where Oedipus hopes to find refuge, but xfļa8e yrjç (294) or xfļa8e xrjç x®PaÇ (296) designate Attica with its àoxu (297), that is, Athens where the play is being presented. M. Vamvouri-Ruffy, in a forthcoming article, gives other examples of deictic ambivalence in the Persians. 43 Cf. Thucydides 2.38.2, 41.1, 42.2, etc. up to 46. 1 . See also the phrasing at 2.36. 1 . The self- referential praise of Athens and of the "we" of her citizens is ultimately conceived as a hymn sung by an "I" (ix yctp xrļv nóXiv upvrjaa, in the aorist, 2.42.2).</page><page sequence="23">Deictic Ambiguity and Auto-Referentiality: Some Examples 437 The funeral speech and the political juridical speech are so focused on Athens that, from a spatial perspective, whoever adopts the authoritative voice within them can dispense with deictic indicators and hence, paradoxi- cally, with the demonstratio ad oculos.

Theocritus: Pastoral Self-Reference In Idyll 18, Theocritus presents a poem whose title assigns it to the melic and ritual genre of the epithalamium, here understood in the general sense of a hymenaios , wedding song. Nevertheless, this title along with its variants (e.g., fEA,évr|ç èrciGa^ápioç, è7ci0a^ápioç 'EÀivriç Kal MeveAaoo, 'EyKcopiov 'E^évrjç) links this composition to the legendary wedding of Helen and Menelaos. In fact, despite its coloring of Doric dialect, Theocritus's epithalamium is narrative and descriptive in character, as its composition in dactylic hexameters confirms. More precisely, first addressed to "the be- loved and happy groom" (co (pita yapßpe, öAßie yapßp', 9 and 16) who turns out to be named Menelaos, and then to the charming young girl, Helen (38), the text of the epithalamium itself becomes the object of an introduc- tory narrative: once upon a time (tcok', 1) in Sparta, in the house of Menelaos, twelve young Spartan girls, the flower of the city, formed a chorus (%opòv èaxáoavxo, in the aorist, 3) to dance and sing in unison (éç ëv pétaç, 7) the marriage song, traditionally called the hymenaios. With re- spect to the descriptive and narrative setting, beginning with the speaker "we," the deictic oôe brings about a shift in the focalization from the young groom, whose deep sleep the young girls mock, to their former companion, Helen: "Menelaos, she is yours, this young bride" (xeà voòç cxôe, 15). And here again the self-designated speaker "we" employs a deictic marker inspired by Homeric diction at the very moment when the praise of Helen, the daughter of Zeus, is transformed into an aetiological tale. This transfor- mation is accomplished through a shift from the past, when the choristers, "all of us age-mates" (appeç 8 ai nàcai auvopxxtaKeç, 22), competed in speed and grace by the banks of the Eurotas, to a moment in the proximate</page><page sequence="24">438 Claude Caíame future when these same young girls will celebrate in ritual the adolescence of their former companion at the Platanistas, where the bark of a tree will be inscribed with Helen's name (in Doric! epyeupeç, "we shall go," 40; oxocÇeôpeç, "we will pour," 46, etc.). It is not until the very end of the young girls' song that they invoke the eponymous patron of marriage with the phrase (Tptļv co Tpévaie, 58) that normally punctuates the genre of the hymenaios like a refrain. With this line that also concludes the Idyll, the xopeuxai invoke the presence of the youthful marriage-hero "upon this marriage" (yápco érci xcpôe).44 While referring anaphorically to the union that the %opeuxai of Theocritus's imagi- nation have just praised, the deictic oôe retains its use as the self-referential designation of the context. But it has lost its pragmatic extra-discursive dimension; through the creation within the poem itself of a scene incorporat- ing enunciative acts, the referential relation of the deictic marker oôe to the communicative situation of the composition as a whole is henceforth sun- dered. More precisely, the extra-discursive situation has become the reality represented within the discourse, presented am Phantasma and no longer ad oculos. The absence of a deictic shift, particularly of a programmatic order that points to the enunciative situation of the poem, is even more palpable in those compositions in which Theocritus does not exploit hetero-diegetic and anonymous narration to signal the distance between the fiction constructed within the poem and its performance context. For instance, in Idyll 7, the poet, by choosing a homo-diegetic and hence autobiographical narrative, situates himself and his companion in an indeterminate moment in the past Cnç Xpóvoç ócvÍk' éycóv, 1) leaving a city which is not named (eiprcopeę èie rcótaoç, 2) in the direction of a supposed place that the scholia set on Cos. In other cases, as in Idyll 3 entitled "Komos," the speaker refers in the present to the musical activity in which he is engaged as he makes his way to the lovely Amaryllis (Kcopáaôco rcoxi xàv 'ApapuÀÀíôa, 1), while his goats, tended by Tityrus, graze near a nameless spring on an equally nameless mountain. Or again, in Idyll 6 addressed to Aratus, the bucolic setting of the dramatic dialogue with its amoebaean singing situates the two shepherd poets in a totally indeterminate place and time (eiç èva %cí&gt;pov . . . tcok', 1-2), while the single deictic marker (xoiáô', 4) refers internally to their alternat- 44 See the discussion of Hunter 1996.149-66, which includes references to the wedding songs of Sappho.</page><page sequence="25">Deictic Ambiguity and Auto-Refe rentiality: Some Examples 439 ing songs.45 Finally, in a completely dramatic and mimetic composition such as Idyll 1, the two shepherds who are the protagonists in the pastoral exchange refer - via demonstratives denoting distance - to the rustling of the pine tree (oc niv uç . . . ifļva . . . peÀioôetai, 1-2) and the sound of the water (to Karolę xf|v' . . . úôcop, 7-8) while metaphorically referring to their own songs (tú aupíoôeç, tò tcòv pé^oç, 2-3, 7). It is only later that the place and time of the action are referred to anaphorically by deictic markers (xeîôe, 12; èv TcpSe, 14; ôeúp', 21, etc.) after the spatial framework has been constructed and represented within the discourse.46 The demonstratio ad oculos has been transformed into Deixis am Phantasma. V.ii. Callimachus: Intra-Discursive Deixis The poetic shift toward a self-enclosed fictional construct through the dramatic creation within the discourse itself of its own conditions of enunciation seems to become even more marked in the extant remains of the varied poetic output of Callimachus. In at least four of the six hymnie compositions whose complete text has come down to us, the voice of the bard appears to sing in a polyphony adopted successively by different speakers - all of them choral in character. Such subtle enunciative games involve the construction through poetic mimesis of a complex communica- tive situation at once completely representational and fictive.47 This development also marks some other poems for which we have complete texts. Thus, for example, Epigram 47 adopts the strategies of narrative in order to recount, in the metaphoric guise of an adventure at sea, the rescue of the dedicatee who was up to his ears in debt. Instead of referring extra-discursively to the object dedicated to the gods of Samothrace for their favor in rescuing the speaker from shipwreck, the deictic oôe refers to the vow (rrļvSe koct' eu^fļv, 3) pronounced by the man at the moment of 45 For an analysis of the openings of Idylls 7, 3, and 6, see Hunter 1999.151-54, 110, and 248-50; see also Goldhill 1991.225-58, who nicely describes the air of "remoteness" that hangs over the spatial framework contructed in Idyll 7, despite the presence of place names. 46 Only the acppiryiç that Thyrsis affixes to his song (Oupoiç oõ' coç Aixvaç, "this here Thyrsis from Etna," 65) has the possibility of providing an extra-discursive localization to this poetic space. Cf. Calarne 1992.77-85 for a study of the spaces constructed in this poem with its complex enunciative structure. 47 See the important study of Falivene 1990.</page><page sequence="26">440 Claude Caíame danger. By using indirect discourse, which subordinates the act of dedica- tion (coôe e'Gexo, 4) to the speech of the dedicatee, all the while addressing that speech to the passers-by and the devotees of the Cabiroi, this vow, through the force of its anaphoric reference, corresponds, in fact, to the text of the story that explains the causes and results of the rescue.48 The use of indirect discourse thus has the purpose of cutting xrjvôe and coôe off from any extra-discursive deictic reference. And in Epigram 58, while the spatial reference refers to the tomb that covers the dead man found "here" (èvGótôe, 1), and which is also directly indicated (xcpôe xcxípco, 2), it addresses a nameless shipwrecked sailor found on the shore by a passer-by who only mourns his own fate like a gull adrift. Elsewhere, the Hellenistic poet exploits the "crossing of genres" in praising the panhellenic victories won by Sosibius (later an official under Ptolemy IV) in elegiac couplets. This fragmentary poem (384 Pfeiffer) presents the song celebrating the victory of the young athlete from Alexan- dria in a wrestling contest at the Panathenaia as an opportunity for the choral group performing the processional song (kcojiov ayovxi xopcp, 38) to sing the famous victory refrain (vikcxîov eqmpviov, 39) composed by Archilochus (frag. 324 West) and quoted by Pindar himself at the beginning of Olympian 9.49 In addition to offering an unexpected confirmation of the choral charac- ter of the KĆopoę and an example of the embedded literary allusions charac- teristic of Alexandrian poetics, the poem describes the various nocturnal festivals organized to celebrate in private the athletic victories of Sosibius, which are designated both anaphoracally and deictically by the use of oôe (xcovSe Tcavqyupicov, 30). But if the allusion to the choral KĆopoę is, in all probability, put in the mouth of Sosibius, the reference to the festivities are spoken by the Nile, who, in his role as nurse of the young athlete, expresses himself in the poem through direct discourse. This means that the deictic designation of the celebrations in which Sosibius participated refers intra- discursively to the victories that have just been mentioned in the narrative mode, within the diegesis itself. Finally, while Callimachus combines multiple formulas appropri- ate to the invocations in prayer form that conclude the Homeric Hymns , only 48 Compare with the text of the "real" epigram ( OG1S 69 Dittenberger): Geoîç peyâtanç, EapoGpot^i 'AtcoMxovioç Xcooißiou 0T|paîoç riyepwv xcov e^co tó^ecov oíoGeíç èy pEyátaov KivÔúvcov EKnXextoac èk tīk 'EpoGpaç Gataxaariç EÍ&gt;yrjv. 49 Concerning this learned allusion and the debate it already provoked in antiquity, cf. the scholia to Pindar 01. 9.1k and 3g-l (1.268-69 Drachmann) and Fuhrer 1993.83-89.</page><page sequence="27">Deictic Ambiguity and Auto-Referentiality: Some Examples 44 1 the close of his Hymn to Demeter seems to offer an example of extra- discursive deixis and hence of demonstratio ad oculos. With essentially the same phrasing that concludes the short Homeric Hymn 13 (also addressed to Demeter), the goddess is asked to take pleasure (in the present song) before being asked to ensure the safety of "this" city (%aîpe, 0£(x, kocì xcxvSe oaco nóXiv, 134). If, however, we attribute an extra-discursive sense to this gesture of deictic monstration, it means ignoring its basis in the enunciative focalization. The body of the poem is, in fact, conceived as a sequence of utterances addressed to the young girls imagined to be celebrating Demeter through their songs (£7ii(p08Y^aa0e, y-ovaíiceç, 1; rcap0£viKai, Kai £7üi(p0£Y^aa08, 118). But by a subtle assimilation of the choristers to the speaker through a generalizing "we" (ócpív, 121), the address to Demeter, while placed in the mouth of this chorus of young girls, finally becomes an invitation to the goddess to be propitious spoken by the speaker himself, on his own behalf (i'Aa0i poi, 138).50 This appropriation of the voice of the chorus by the poet is a self-conscious move that distances the text from any situational reference. Moreover, unlike the Homeric Hymns , the Hymn to Demeter does not culminate in a performative introduction to another song: the hymnie compositions of the critic-poet are not Ttpooipia: they do not form preludes to the rhapsodic and ritual recitation of the Homeric poems on the occasion of a particular cultic celebration. Henceforth, they are literary productions, constituted by Deixis am Phantasma even in their deployment of the strategies of demonstratio ad oculos. On the basis of the foregoing, the £7iTļ making up the Hymn to Pan , included in "this" learned and written text (Ypcc&lt;piļ tÍ1Ô£, 3) composed by Castorion of Soloi ( Suppl .

CONCLUSION: CODA If the learned poets of Alexandria at the court of the Ptolemies continued to employ forms of the deictic marker of presence o8e - all the while mixing the traditional inherited genres - they generally did so only by using them as intra-discursive references of an anaphoric or cataphoric kind. Tied to their focalization on the speaking "I" and the formal framework of enunciation, these forms of o8e lost their deictic function, particularly their programmatic reference to the present poem in relation to its preparation and the actual process of its performance. Stripped of its reference to an extra-discursive hie et nunc through the medium of writing, a poem could now be composed for the distant actualization represented by reading. Henceforth, poetic self-referentiality appears entirely limited to Deixis am Phantasma and to the possibilities of fictional realization charac- teristic of that poetic mode: the fictional becomes "fictive." In turn, stripped of its anchor in the performative dimension of poetic practice, the demonstratio ad oculos is placed in the service of a purely rhetorical èvápyeia, as is the case in most kinds of modern poetry, but as is also true of Homeric narrative poetry, however "archaic" it may be. Thus, despite ap- pearances, the appeal to Deixis am Phantasma does not depend on the shift from oral to written; likewise demonstratio ad oculos should not be consid- ered an "innovation" introduced by the "lyric" poets.52 The different configurations arising from the combinations of these two phenomena are based on generic rules that may vary according to historical and institutional circumstances. As the fictional character of heroic Homeric poetry demon- strates, the use of writing plays only a secondary role in these variations. What is essential is the part played by the pragmatic function of their respective poetic genres. 51 Translation by Bing 1988.23; see also his comments on this text. 52 As maintained by Rosier 1983.26-28 and Danielewicz 1990.16-17, respectively. There is, then, no one-to-one relation between the movement from the mode of demonstratio ad oculos to that of Deixis am Phantasma and the change between an oral tradition to a culture of writing. See the discussion in Bakker 1998.65-77 and Calarne 1995.25-26.</page><page sequence="29">Deictic Ambiguity and Auto-Referentiality : Some Examples 443 Thus the pragmatic element in a discourse altogether focused on producing a result (e.g., a forensic speech), entails the diminution of some of the indications of deixis found particularly in melic poetry. Doubtless, by way of conclusion, the distinction made by Aristotle between poetry and rhetoric should be mentioned here. If the latter is connected to practice, the former arises from mimesis. As representation, and hence as fabrication, poetry can only fulfill its ritual function enunciatively through demonstratio ad oculos. But to the extent that such indispensable deictic markers cannot themselves be divorced from Deixis am Phantasma , discours cannot be separated from récit. Hence, without dispensing with its pragmatic utility, the initial distinction between histoire/récit and discours outlined by Benveniste according to precise linguistic criteria turns out to be completely porous with respect to the practical analysis of Greek discourse. Which brings us back, appropriately enough, to reflect on the applications of linguistic theory and the concepts that may be able to restore texts in their anthropological dimensions to literary analysis.
