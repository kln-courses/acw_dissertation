In 1923 Arthur 0. Lovejoy, Gilbert Chinard, and George Boas formed at Johns Hopkins the History of Ideas Club, bringing to- gether such scholars as Marjorie H. Nicolson, W. F. Albright, and later Ludwig Edelstein, Harold Cherniss, Bentley Glass, and Owsei Temkin. From such auspicious beginnings stems the special type of historical inquiry that in 1940, on the initiative of Philip P. Wiener, acquired a periodical, the Journal of the History of Ideas, and has developed into a distinctive method of intellectual history. Lovejoy himself made clear how he conceived "ideas" and their history in various writings, perhaps most fully in the first of his William James Lectures of 1933 on The Great Chain of Being, "The Study of the History of Ideas," and in the first of his Essays in the History of Ideas of 1948, "The Historiography of Ideas." The present popular introduction to the discipline by George Boas scarcely adds much to or differs greatly from Lovejoy's earlier de- termination, though it comes from a scholar who can say, "For forty years I have done little else than write articles and books in this area." This volume appears to have grown out of talks to a lay audience. Its author seems not to take it too seriously, for he has not bothered to provide it even with an index. Boas hardly deals with the points in Lovejoy's program that have always seemed to need clarifying. He seems to accept Lovejoy's no- tion of "unit ideas": he says, "The history of ideas is not the history of a science or a philosophy. Sciences and philosophies are clusters of ideas, each of which has its own history. . . . Hence it is clear that before one can write the history of an idea one must disentan- gle it from all the ambiguities it has acquired in the course of time." This leaves the vexed problems, just what is "an idea"? How are we to arrive at an irreducible unit? And how much does an idea have to change before it becomes another idea? Moreover, Boas leaves us as much in the dark as did Lovejoy him- self as to historical causation in the history of ideas. Why and how do they change in the particular way they do? Boas counsels, "The writer must be patient about historical causation and not commit himself either to materialism or spiritualism while he is writing. ... I shall be told that I, too, have a philosophy of history, and the charge is inescapable. I have one. It recognizes the real existence of chance and is willing to settle for the probable and not seek the</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 139 absolutely true. It also assumes that the human mind is an active force in the course of history and not an inert patient upon which economic, erotic, or even social causes operate." Marx and Freud are out. Boas calls his, approach "a benevolent skepticism." Most of what Boas has to say would come under the head of ways in which the human mind is an "active force." He has many wise and witty remarks and observations on the psychology that lies be- hind what he defines as "the history of beliefs, assertions of either fact or policy." These might be taken as elaborations of what Love- joy called the "metaphysical pathos" of ideas. He emphasizes the ex- tent to which basic metaphors generalize ideas, especially those taken from human experience. Men's conceptions seem naturally (which sense of 'natural'?) to start by being anthropomorphic. Hence Boas, like Lovejoy, is concerned with unwarranted ideas. "The person who would study the history of ideas must have a kind of curiosity about the human mind and its workings that is not common. He must be willing to treat ideas that seem silly or super- stitious and that are perhaps obsolete with the same care as he would give to established truths. For the history of ideas tells us among other things how we got to think the way we do-and if that is not of importance, one wonders what is." Indeed, though Boas does not emphasize or even mention this function of the history of ideas, one suspects that he takes this historical criticism much as Wittgenstein took linguistic criticism, as basically a therapeutic function. I remember once asking Lovejoy why he was so much interested in German intellectual history. "Why," he replied, "the Germans have thought up ten times as many crazy ideas as the rest of them put together." In the light of his French experience and his French wife, Boas has shown a greater predilection for the intellectual his- tory of France than did Lovejoy. But one suspects that his interest in crazy ideas springs in part at least from his benevolent skepticism. A third of the present volume takes as illustrations of the history of ideas that of the ideas of "the people," of monotheism, and of man as a microcosm, in the tracing of which Boas exhibits his cus- tomary virtuosity and learning. The microcosm idea is clearly one of the crazy ones. Monotheism Boas sees as the result of merging the metaphysical "God" with the religious God. The former was a natural development of the active force of the human mind. "The compulsion to make sense out of what one believes is the impetus of all philosophy and science." Listing the major metaphysical Gods of the Protestant era, those of Rousseau, Voltaire, Kant, Hegel,</page><page sequence="3">I40 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY Royce, Whitehead, and Tillich, Boas concludes: "These are all metaphysical Gods, not religious Gods. No man could pray to any of them. None of them could have delivered the Decalogue.... In short, God had become a name for whatever principle of unity a philosopher could discover in the universe. The outcome of all this was the announcement that God was dead, as indeed He was if he was one of the gods constructed by metaphysical dialectic.... The philosophic transformation of the one God of the Old Testa- ment into a multiplicity of metaphysical gods has had the effect of denying the reality of that which the procedure was supposed to prove." After tracing the history of "the people," Boas concludes: "The primary meaning [of the people] will be the political meaning and no value will be associated with it. The People will be the name simply for that group entitled to vote in elections for public of- fice." I recall a remark of Morris Cohen's: "The Marxists talk of the masses; the liberals talk of the people; conservatives speak of the country." On one point Boas carries his skepticism too far. He has no use for the idea of natural teleology, or indeed for that of causation. "No one today would explain motion as purposive." "To speak of a cause producing its effect is to talk in anthropomorphic terms, however refined, just as it is to say, for instance, that trees have leaves in order to effect photosynthesis." Boas rules out means as well as ends. The "ancient concepts of purpose and cause" were anthropomorphic projections of human characters. In this he con- tinues to misread Aristotle, construing the latter's telos and hou heneka as "purpose," and taking them as implying conscious pur- pose; he continues to identify all ends with "ends in view," where Aristotle limited consciously entertained ends to human action and art. Thus in his suggestive "Some Assumptions of Aristotle" 1 he even said: "Purpose must be deliberate, conscious purpose, not a purpose achieved as a by-product of an event. In introducing God, Aristotle emphasizes the anthropomorphic side of purpose" (50). But Aristotle makes clear that his God has no such conscious, delib- erate purposes. And in his arguments for natural teleology-for ends or outcomes as one of the factors whose understanding is a necessary condition for understanding a natural process-in chap- ter 8 of Book II of the Physics, he specifically says, "It is absurd to think that we do not see a thing being generated heneka tou if we see that the mover is not deliberating" (199b27-29).

The customary accurate scholarship of Boas seems to desert him when he encounters Aristotle. Like Lovejoy, he still shares the prejudices of a generation of evolutionists. JOHN HERMAN RANDALL, JR.
