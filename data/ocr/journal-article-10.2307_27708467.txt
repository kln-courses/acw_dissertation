Zimansky, Gambier, Ohio "When Shelley went to the Continent with Godwin's daughter in 1814 they sailed down certain great rivers in an open boat. . . . He may have seen some cave that was the bed of a rivulet by some river side, or have followed some mountain stream to its source in a cave, for from his return to England rivers and streams and wells, flowing through caves or rising in them, came into every poem of his that was of any length, and always with the precision of symbols," so William Butler Yeats tells us in his elegant and scholarly essay "The Philosophy of Shelley's Poetry."1 Yeats adds that "so good a Platonist as Shelley" could not have employed the cave as a symbol without thinking of Plato's cave and, perhaps, Porphyry's essay on "the Cave of the Nymphs" (Yeats, pp. 81-82). Much Shelley criticism has been hard on Yeats's claim that Shelley's poetry is systematically symbolic and that the key to that symbolism rests with philosophy.2 I am going to argue, however, that Yeats's sense of Shelley's poetry is still very much on the mark. Shelley after 1814 is systematically symbolic and his symbolism is philosophically grounded. Nevertheless, I do dispute Yeats's claim that the philosophic ground is Platonic, for, as C. E. Pulos has shown convincingly in The Deep Truth: A Study of Shelley's Scepticism, the core of Shelley's mature thought, that is, his thought after 1814, derives from the En i William Butler Yeats, Essays and Introductions (New York: Collier Books, Macmillan, 1968), p. 80. 2 See especially G. M. Matthews, "A Volcano's Voice in Shelley," ELH, 27 (1957), 191-93. Matthews is particularly interested in denying symbolic precision to the very objects Yeats finds most exemplify it?Shelley's caves and fountains. For my interpretation of these objects, see Section IV below. Both Harold Bloom, in Shel ley's Mythmaking (New Haven: Yale Univ. Press, [1959], esp. pp. 1-10), and Stuart Curran, in Shelley's Annus Mirabilis: The Maturing of an Epic Vision (San Marino, Calif.: Huntington Library, 1975), find Shelley more mythic than symbolic. And though Earl Wasserman, in Shelley: A Critical Reading (Baltimore: Johns Hopkins Univ. Press, 1971), thinks there is in Shelley "a radical character of mind that is constant and unfolds in coherently related patterns," his "objective is . . . the interpretation of the individual poem, not an anatomy of the Shelleyan 'mind' or an analysis of anything that cuts across or lies behind the collective works" (pp. viii-ix). Thus, the nature of these "coherently related patterns," for instance the degree to which they may be symbolic, remains unspoken. 209</page><page sequence="2">2io Zimansky lightenment skepticism of David Hume and his little-known follower, Sir William Drummond, rather than from Plato, Platonism, or Neo platonismo Several critics since Pulos?most notably Earl Wasserman4 ?have come to accept Shelley's skepticism and to apply it to the poetry; here I will do the same, using it to unlock its symbolism. In presenting a symbolic system of Yeatsian intensity for Shelley's poetry, I think it helpful to begin with a few caveats. First, a thorough explication of the system is a book-length task. I offer here only the skeleton of such a book, and one missing some major articulations and appendages at that, for I forgo consideration of the relationship between Shelley's symbolic poetry and his juvenilia and also of the development of that poetry between Alastor (1815) and Prometheus Unbound (1818-19), both complex and interesting topics.5 Further more, my outline of the symbolism that Shelley's mature poems share with each other comes at the expense of an accounting of those poems' individual richness, a richness which there is no space to tally here. Finally, since Shelley's symbolism is highly philosophical, this essay necessarily begins with an outline of his philosophy. This outline I borrow largely from Pulos but make my own additions, particularly the chain of causes. Shelley wrote only fragmentary essays on philoso phy, never a complete treatise, so of course any outline of Shelley's philosophy is an abstraction. 1 In Academical Questions William Drummond was largely content to argue for the validity of skepticism by systematically and tediously arguing against the validity of all other philosophies, or at least 3 C. E. Pulos, The Deep Truth: A Study of Shelley's Scepticism (Lincoln: Univ. of Nebraska Press, 1954). Recent Platonic interpretations of Shelley can be found in James A. Notopoulos, The Platonism of Shelley: A Study of Platonism and the Poetic Mind (Durham, N.C.: Duke Univ. Press, 1949), and Neville Rogers, Shelley at Work: A Critical Inquiry (Oxford: Oxford Univ. Press, 1956; 2nd ed. 1967). An exception to those denying Shelley symbolic precision is Donald Reiman {Shelley's "The Triumph of Life" [Urbana: Univ. of Illinois Press, 1965], esp. pp. 8-18). As if in response to Matthews, Reiman cites Yeats's essay approvingly and asserts that Shelley "transmits his meaning partly through a system of symbols that remain relatively consistent from poem to poem" (p. 8). He is also aware of the limitations of Yeats's reliance on Plato, noting that "Shelley syncretized symbolic overtones from many sources" into his poetry (my italics, p. 12). The outlines of Shelley's symbolism that Reiman gives dovetails with my outline in this essay but is not as thoroughly grounded in Shelley's philosophy. 4 Wasserman, in Shelley: A Critical Reading. 5 Dates given for Shelley's poems are dates of composition, from Shelley: Poetical Works, ed.

In these essays, particularly "Speculations on Metaphysics," "On Life," and the "Essay on a Future State," Shelley argues that our only certain perception, and therefore our only certain knowledge, is of effects and that, though men almost universally believe they have certain perception of cause, what they have in fact is only the logical inference of cause from its effect(s). This is not to say that cause does not exist?it most certainly does?but only that it is always unknowable. As Shelley says in the fragment "On Polytheism," "what cause is, no philosopher has succeeded in explain ing, and the triumph of the acutest metaphysician has been confined to demonstrating it to be inexplicable. All we know of cause is that one event, or to speak more correctly, one sensation follows another attended with a conviction derived from experience that these sen sations will hereafter be similarly connected."7 In Shelley's hands, as in Hume's, this skeptical epistemology is turned against dogmatic belief in God. Since we can have no direct knowledge of cause, we can have no direct knowledge of the cause of causes, God, and rather than use so charged a word as "God" Shelley prefers to call him (or it) "the Power" or "Unknown Cause." However, unlike his mentor Hume, Shelley's tendency is to see Unknown Cause as a mystery rather than a blank. For example, in the "Essay on Chris tianity," in which Shelley ascribes to Jesus beliefs that clearly are his own, he places God, or Unknown Cause, beyond vulgar conceptions of divine person and power?refuses him a local habitation and a name but still has him in sight: We can distinctly trace in the tissue of his [Jesus'] doctrines the per suasion that God is some universal being, differing both from man and from the mind of man.?According to Jesus Christ, God is neither the Jupiter who sends rain upon the earth, nor the Venus thro whom all living things are produced, nor the Vulcan who presides over the ter restrial element of fire, nor the Vesta that preserves the light which is inshrined in the sun and moon and stars. He is neither the Proteus or the Pan of the material world. But the word God, according to the ac 6 William Drummond, Academical Questions (London: W. Bulmer, 1805). The adjective "academical" refers to skepticism, not Platonism. See Pulos, pp. 9-13 and 28; also the OED. t The Complete Works of Percy Bysshe Shelley, ed. Roger Ingpen and Walter E.

Apparently his senses also tell him that some causes are superior to others, for he sees the world not simply as a random collection of cause and effect relationships watched over by an inscrutable Unknown Cause, but rather as a hierarchical pyramid of causes, a pyramid crowned by Unknown Cause. Since Shelley's Un known Cause is the cause of causes, the rest of his universe is a col lection of its effects. Those effects closest to Unknown Cause?we can call them primary effects?receive all their causal energy from it and by this transfer become causes in their own right second in power only to the Unknown Cause. These primary effects, in turn, are the prin cipal causes of secondary effects, which, in turn, receive enough energy from Unknown Cause and its primary effects to be the principal causes of tertiary effects, and so on. Thus, Shelley's universe is composed of Unknown Cause and its ranked subsidiary effects and causes. Strangely, there is very little evidence for this pyramid of cause/ effect relationships in the philosophical essays, although in a passage of the "Essay on Christianity" Shelley clearly describes man, though not any other being, as a subsidiary of Unknown Cause: "There is a Power by which we are surrounded, like the atmosphere in which some motionless lyre is suspended, which visits with its breath our silent chords, at will. Our most imperial and stupendous qualities? those on which the majesty and the power of humanity is erected?are, relatively to the inferior portion of its mechanism, indeed active and imperial; but they are the passive slaves of some higher and more omnipresent Power. This Power is God" (Julian, vi, 231). But in Shelley's major poetry the pyramid of causes is often present, and in deed we find two versions of it, versions distinguishable first and fore most by whether evil in them is a contrary or a negation. In the former instance the universe is governed by a Fate-like Unknown 8 Julian, vi, 229-30. Horace Smith, recollecting Shelley's beliefs in 1817, the last time he saw him, could be summarizing this passage: "Any attempt at an impersona tion of the Deity, or any conception of Him otherwise than as the pervading spirit of the whole illimitable universe, he [Shelley] held to be presumptuous; for the finite cannot grasp the infinite" (see Arthur H. Beavan, James and Horace Smith [London, 1899], pp. 172-74, as quoted in Newman I. White, Shelley [New York: Alfred Knopf, 1940], 1, 746-47, n. 89).</page><page sequence="5">A Symbolism for Shelley's Poetry 213 Cause which, though perhaps secretly or ultimately benevolent is in general morally neutral and has as its main occupation standing by while morally contrary and decidedly unneutral subsidiary causes war over earthly life. In the latter instance Unknown Cause and its sub sidiaries are all benevolent: there are no malevolent Powers. Unknown Cause, however, has always been opposed by dead matter; as a result, the universe, though it contains no positive evil, is full of imperfection. These two versions of the pyramid of causes are essentially cosmolo gies. The first, in which evil is a contrary, is basically Zoroastrian; the second, in which it is a negation, is basically Neoplatonic. The Zo roastrian cosmology dominates The Revolt of Islam (1817) and Pro metheus Unbound. In The Revolt " 'inessential Nought' " (1. 351), a particularly vacuous representation of Unknown Cause, is the source of the Spirit of the Good (Oromazes) and its enemy and opposite, the Spirit of Evil (Ahriman). The moral condition of life on earth is de termined by the outcome of these spirits' battles, battles responsible for the fate of human heroes and tyrants, who are in turn responsible for the fate of men and women in the mass. In Prometheus Unbound Demogorgon, associated with Destiny ("The snake-like Doom coiled underneath his throne" [II.iii.96]), looks on while Prometheus and Jupiter, immortal but time-bound Oromazes and Ahriman respectively, struggle for control of the world. The Neoplatonic cosmology finds its strongest expression in The Witch of Atlas (1820), Epipsychidion (1821) and the last third of Adonais (1821). In these poems Unknown Cause is likened to a demi urge or light, or both, and this Cause continually tries to mold a dead universe of resistant, chaotic matter into perfect form. In the words of Adonais: the one Spirit's plastic stress Sweeps through the dull dense world, compelling there, All new successions to the forms they wear; Torturing th' unwilling dross that checks its flight To its own likeness, as each mass may bear. . . . (11. 381-85) In this essay I use the term Zoroastrian and Neoplatonic as labeling adjectives for two kinds of cosmologies abstractly distinguishable in Shelley's poetry, but they have something of a concrete historical validity as well. As a consequence of his friendship with John Frank Newton and Thomas Love Peacock, Shelley in his middle twenties (the period of Mont Blanc, The Revolt, and Prometheus Unbound) became very much interested in Eastern lore generally and Zoroastrian ism in particular; while with the move to Italy in 1818 he seems to have shifted these interests to the study of Plato, though not, I hasten</page><page sequence="6">214 Zimansky to add, to Neoplatonism. The shift in interests was by no means com plete, however, for though Shelley may have abandoned the study of Zoroastrianism after his exile, he did not completely pack away the Zoroastrian schema. Thus, the first two-thirds of A don?is, the frag mentary (and posthumously published) "Prologue to Hellas' (1821), and perhaps even The Triumph of Life (unfinished at Shelley's death in 1822) personify evil, thereby implying it is a contrary. Incidentally, the presence in Shelley's work of Zoroastrian and Neoplatonic cos mologies side by side or alternated from poem to poem (the exact extent of which is a topic for further study) is skeptically sound, for its tendency is to maintain both cosmologies, and hence the whole question of evil's nature, in the status of speculation.9 11 This outline of Shelley's skeptical philosophy is important in its own right as an interpretation of the poet's philosophy and as an indication of Hume's influence on early nineteenth-century thought, but it is also important to an understanding of Shelley's poetic imagery, for, with the notable exception of The Cenci (1819), almost all of Shelley's work after 1815 symbolizes cause and effect. Most of the lyrics are as symbolic of it as the longer poems, but they are too short to provide extended examples. For this reason most of my examples here come from The Revolt, Prometheus Unbound, The Witch of Atlas, Epi psychidion, and A don?is. In these poems Shelley symbolizes the re lationship between cause and its effects either by personifying cause and its effects or by imaging cause as the source of natural force (most commonly as the source of a "stream" of light, fire, water, or air) and the effects of cause as the natural elements upon which this natural force acts. Personification being the more traditional of these two symbolizations, I describe it first. I use the term "personification" in a very broad sense. Read sym bolically, almost every animate being in Shelley's mature poems, in cluding man, "personifies" either Unknown or subsidiary cause. Usu ally cause is represented by a single being, which in sex may be male, female, androgyne, or hermaphrodite. However, some of Shelley's char acters are so tightly bound to each other that, to alter Plato's parable 9 Stuart Curran, in Shelley's Annus Mirabilis, most recently and thoroughly explores Shelley's Asiatic researches and friendships. For a summary of Neoplatonism emphasizing its vision of evil as a negation, see M. H. Abrams, "The Great Circle: Pagan and Christian Neoplatonism," Natural Sup er naturalism (New York: Norton, 1971), pp. 146-54.</page><page sequence="7">A Symbolism for Shelley's Poetry 215 once again, we can take them as representing two halves of a single cause. The bond is almost always love; the two characters, lovers. In Prometheus Unbound Prometheus and Asia are such joint personifica tions, as are Jupiter and Thetis, though with the latter couple mutual hate rather than mutual love forms the bond. Shelley's most usual name for cause, a name he found in eighteenth century philosophers including Hume, is "Power." Although the term suggests cause is energy, Shelley commonly uses it to designate per sonifications of cause as well, a practice of some ingenuity since, at the very moment he calls a personified cause "Power," he hints that it may not be a personification at all, simply a bundle of energy. Every Power has three characteristics. First, it has a territory or sphere of influence. The larger its territory, the greater its power. Unknown Cause's territory is the whole universe; subsidiary cause can rule anything from stars, like the "inheritors of unfulfilled re nown" (1. 397) in A don?is, to fields or woods, like the fauns and night ingales in Act II, Scene ii, of Prometheus Unbound. Second, every Power has a home, and this home is an enclosure at the center of the Power's territory. The more powerful the cause, the more sublime its home. The greatest Powers live in temples, less great Powers live in caves, and minor Powers live in still smaller enclosures. The delicate forest spirits that interest the fauns in Prometheus Unbound live in "bubbles" or Under pink blossoms or within the bells Of meadow flowers, or folded violets deep, Or in the sunlight of the sphered dew. (My italics, II.ii.71 and 84-87) Third, every Power, including Unknown Cause, influences inferior Powers, and these, though they sometimes chafe, accept the dominance. Thus, in A don?is Urania is not simply the Muse of tradition, but the governing Power of living poets; and, more darkly, in The Triumph of Life "Life" forces "a captive multitude" (1. 119) to dance around her triumphal chariot in a debased and debilitating frenzy. For aesthetic reasons Shelley may fail to describe one or more of a Power's three characteristics. Usually the reader can supply the missing trait(s) with his imagination. For example, in A don?is Shelley does not describe Urania's home much more than to call it a "Paradise" (1. 14), but since in power, sphere of influence, and general responsibilities Urania resembles the Witch of Atlas, it is likely her dwelling, too, resembles the Witch's. Shelley has devoted about a hundred lines to the latter, so he has given our imaginations a good start.</page><page sequence="8">216 Zimansky The general tenor of Shelley's Powers and the nature of their dominions indicate whether they represent benevolent or malevolent cause. Characteristically, benevolent Powers smile and rule a won drous territory full of love and freedom. Malevolent Powers, on the other hand, are tyrants of horrid visage who spread hate, oppression, and disease throughout the land. The Witch of Atlas is an example of the former, Ozymandias and the Tyrant of the Golden City in The Revolt are examples of the latter. As a general rule Shelley personifies malevolent cause only in poems using the Zoroastrian cosmology, presumably because only in these poems can evil be said to be a cause. In the Neoplatonic cosmology all cause is benevolent, and evil exists only because, in the language of Carlyle, there are some crannies and dogholes of the universe that the Torch, Rush-light, and Sulphur match of cause have not yet illuminated. Personified Unknown Cause has several characteristics that prevent us from confusing it with its subsidiaries. It has no superior; it is the ruler of the universe; and it is largely inscrutable. However, the nature of the Power's inscrutability varies with the cosmology in which it appears. In the Zoroastrian schema (e.g., in The Revolt and Pro metheus Unbound) it is too dark to see, while in the Neoplatonic (e.g., Epipsychidion and Adonais) it is too light. This difference in brightness follows from the imagistic requirements of the two schemata. In the Zoroastrian cosmology the moral state of the universe is the result of the warfare of Oromazian (good) and Ahrimanian (evil) Powers at all levels of the causal pyramid except Unknown Cause. Shelley associates Oromazian Powers with light and Ahrimanian with darkness, traditional uses of light and dark imagery. Were he also to associate with light the unitary Unknown Cause standing above this universal conflict, he would imply the ultimate triumph of Oro mazian Power, and such a portrayal would not be skeptical. The as sociation of Unknown Cause with darkness is not as suggestive. Darkness indicates ignorance as well as evil, and, while many of us equate the two, Shelley does not. The darkness of Unknown Cause in the Zoroastrian cosmology is the darkness of ignorance?our ignorance of Unknown Cause?while the darkness of any subsidiary of this Un known Cause is the darkness of evil and tells us that that subsidiary is a malevolent Power. Thus, in Prometheus Unbound both Demo gorgon and Jupiter, his subsidiary, are associated with darkness, but only Jupiter is evil. Demogorgon's darkness is darkness to non-eternals only?"a mighty darkness" (II.iv.2), a "gloom divine" (II.ii.22) that hides the "deep truth" (II.iv.116) from Asia, Prometheus, and Jupiter as well as the humanity they govern. In the Zoroastrian scheme the</page><page sequence="9">A Symbolism for Shelley's Poetry 217 darkness of Unknown Cause bears all the characteristics of the in scrutable darkness of Greek Fate, a concept Shelley knew well. In the Neoplatonic cosmology all Power is benevolent, and Shelley associates it with light. Unknown Cause is represented by the sun, whose dazzle, hiding much more than it reveals, suggests benevolence at the same time as inscrutability. Ignoring natural philosophy, Shelley follows the tradition that the sun is supreme among the stars, even to the point of declaring it the source of all their light. In Adonais the sun's light "kindles the Universe" (1. 478) and in the "Hymn of Apollo" Apollo, the sun-god, says: Whatever lamps on Earth or Heaven may shine Are portions of one power, which is mine. (11. 23-24) Shelley exercises the same care in presenting subsidiary Powers as he does in presenting Unknown ones, so much so that a subsidiary Pow er's territory, home, subjects, and allegiances reveal its rank in the pyramid of causes. Rather than go through these subsidiary Powers one by one I have cast them and their identifying characteristics into a table along with Shelley's two versions of Unknown Cause already discussed. The table combines Neoplatonic and Zoroastrian schemata, and the reader should note (1) that in the former only one Power, Unknown Cause, governs all of eternity, whereas in the latter three Powers?Unknown Cause and its two primary subsidiaries?do so; (2) that out of context Neoplatonic and benevolent Zoroastrian (i.e., Oromazian) Powers of the same energy are indistinguishable and so can be properly classified Neoplatonic or Zoroastrian only by reference to the cosmology of the work in which they occur; and, (3) that the Neoplatonic schema is what is left of the Zoroastrian schema when we subtract from it Zoroastrian Unknown Cause and all the Ahrimanian Powers (terming the first Oromazian Power "Unknown Cause" and renumbering the remaining Oromazian Powers). Of course, the table is an abstraction. Shelley's personifications do not always neatly fit the categories the table sets out, and he certainly never numbered the hierarchy. Nevertheless, it should be helpful in delineating the general shape of the universe of Shelley's poetry, a universe of Powers and their territories. The table may suggest that Shelley's two cosmologies form only the setting of his poetry. This is not the case; especially in the longer poems, they account for plot. Individual Powers become cheered, some times even elevated to a higher rank, when they are touched by a supe rior, benevolent Power, infused with its energy, made its more immedi ate subsidiary. Individuals become depressed whenever the benevolent</page><page sequence="10">shelley's powers RANK OF POWER (Unknown Cause = o, primary subsidiary = 1, etc.) PERSONIFICATION TERRITORY o Zoroastrian A Fate or Fate-like Universe Power, always dark Throne in Eternitya ist Zoroastrian Eternal Oromazian Universe &amp; Ahrimanian Powers o Neoplatonic Sun (personified) Universe fej Throne in Eternity Sun (presumably with throne &amp; temple for the Power residing there) 2nd Zoroastrian ist Neoplatonic Earthly heroesb be fore birth and after death (no Ahri manian Powers described) Star Throne on star 3rd Zoroastrian 2nd Neoplatonic Oromazian &amp; Ahri manian immortal gods (i.e., gods chained to time, not eternal gods) Benevolent immor tal gods Planet (usually earth) Rural cave (Oro mazian); mountain top, perhaps with palace (Ahrimanian) Rural cave 4th Zoroastrian g 3rd Neoplatonic Earthly heroes (Oromazian) &amp; tyrants (Ahri manian) while alive Earthly heroes while alive Some portion of earth (country, city, or rural neighbor hood) Rural caves, bowers (heroes); urban palace (tyrants) Rural caves, bowersc 5th Zoroastrian 4th Neoplatonic Friendly helpers of hero; lackeys of tyrant Friendly helpers of hero A portion of earth less than their hero or tyrant superior's A portion of earth less than their superior's Cave, bower, or house less than their superior's Cave or bower less than their superior's 6th Zoroastrian Mass of mankind 5th Neoplatonic Lesser portion of earth than the above Lesser dwelling than the above a Shelley's vision tends to cloud over in Eternity with the result that he seldom gives a precise account of the sublime dwelling?usually a palace or temple?enclosing the throne.

It was "grown / Out of the mountains, from the living stone" (11. 495-96) and so is as much cave as house.</page><page sequence="11">A Symbolism for Shelley's Poetry 219 Power they serve either reduces its influence, thereby adding to exis tence a measure of darkness (Neoplatonic schema), or yields them to an Ahrimanian Power (Zoroastrian schema). The entire autobiographi cal midsection of Epipsychidion (11. 190-387) bears witness to the dra matic fluctuations of mood that a Shelley character, in this case Shelley himself, can suffer as the result of the presence or absence of other Powers. The contest between benevolent Powers on the one hand and malevolent Powers or darkness on the other also accounts for the history of cities, countries, and the world. This subject is too- large to treat fully here, but, in outline, whenever benevolent Powers are in the ascendant, men progress toward the Millennium and freedom; whenever these Powers are absent, they are enslaved. According to the Zoroastrian schema the Millennium will occur when Ahrimanian power is totally defeated. At this time, as in Act III of Prometheus Unbound, cities will no longer be ruled from the central thrones of palaces, and the buildings and the trappings of empire will stand unregarded or covered with vegetation (man's renewal is also nature's). Benevolent Power, whose territory Shelley usually restricts to that portion of the countryside Ahrimanian Power can't control, will have conquered the city. In the Neoplatonic schema the Millennium will occur when light (or other causal power) sufficient to repudiate all darkness visits the earth, hence the celebration of the "one Spirit's plastic stress" in Adonais. Finally, both schemata explain what happens to heroes (and perhaps other benevolent mortals) when they die. According to the Zoroastrian schema the death of a hero indicates that Oromazian Power has com manded his appearance at his temple in eternity (as we learn of Laon and Cythna in Cantos I and XII of The Revolt). According to the Neoplatonic schema it occurs when Unknown Cause commands the living hero to attend him as a star (as in the conclusion of Adonais). In both The Revolt and Adonais earthly heroes are born, not made (the Romantic cult of genius); they pre-existed in eternity and to eternity they return. However, as a skeptic Shelley knew he did not know either where genius came from or where it went, and his dis cussions, whether in poetry or prose, of prenatal and postmortal exis tence are always speculative.10 10 Both Shelley's prose and his poetry show such clear-cut separation of skeptical and optimistic arguments about the existence of an afterlife that it is obvious that he was aware of the difference. "On a Future State" and "Essay on the Punishment of Death" are rigorously logical and hence agnostic. In contrast, the rhapsodic "Essay on Christianity" contains a brief but impassioned description of immortality. No trustworthy spokesman in the historical cantos of The Revolt (II through the</page><page sequence="12">220 Zimansky ni In Shelley's other major symbolization of the cause/effect relationship, he images cause as the source of some natural force or energy and its effect(s) as the natural element(s) this force acts upon. By "natural force," potentially a term of wide application, I refer to Shelley's rather peculiar notions of the forces operating in nature. Although, as in Prometheus Unbound, gravitation and volcanic eruption are among these forces,11 Shelley's favorites are light, fire, water, and air. He images them as streams flowing from an appropriate source and going to and affecting other natural objects, including, in the case of light and fire, celestial objects.12 Thus, as Yeats noted, Shelley's wells and fountains are the sources of streams; these streams nourish the surrounding landscape. Like water, fire and light flow in "streams" connecting their source, often a celes tial body, to other objects. The breeze, too, acts like a stream of water, but Shelley usually gives it a personified source, a spirit, rather than a natural source, probably for the simple reason that the wind (e.g., The West Wind), while it may come from a compass point, does not come from a point source. As the reader can see, the source of the natural force symbolizes cause; the objects the force operates on sym bolize the effects of cause. When Shelley uses personification, the nod of the head or verbal command of a superior Power symbolizes the me ans-by-which cause acts on its effects; when Shelley uses natural force imagery, then the force itself (the stream of light, fire, water, or air) has this value. Phrased another way, Shelley's stream images represent the flow of energy from cause to effect. In Shelley's use of two imagistic systems instead of one, we see yet again his fidelity to skepticism. A single system would have suggested he was certain about the nature of cause; two systems reduce both to the status of surmise and even suggest he stopped at two for con venience. But the two images of cause he chose, the anthropomorphic and the energetic, represent extremes and so summarize man's view of cause. Specifically, personified cause looks back to religion, to cause first half of XII) claims life exists after death, but the mythological frame cantos (I and the last half of XII) clearly state that it does. 11 The latter is the main subject of Matthews' article. 12 In "The Correspondent Breeze: A Romantic Metaphor" (in Abrams, ed., English Romantic Poets [New York: Oxford Univ. Press, i960], pp. 37-54, rev. from Kenyon Review, 19 [1957], pp. 113-30), M. H. Abrams demonstrates that wind is a Romantic symbol of divine afflatus and cites "Ode to the West Wind" as a prime example. In Shelley light, fire, and water are also correspondent media.</page><page sequence="13">A Symbolism for Shelley's Poetry 221 as God. Cause as force or energy (I use the terms interchangeably) looks forward to modernism, to cause as will acting on idea, id on superego, energy on matter. For clarity, I illustrated Shelley's use of personification separately, but the two imagistic systems, personification and energy, are always woven together in a manner analogous to synesthesia. This blending, a blending some readers find maddening, is evident in the examples of natural force imagery that follow. In Mont Blanc the peak of Europe's highest mountain represents Unknown Cause. At two im portant points in the poem Shelley addresses this Cause as "thou" (1. 80 and 1. 142), but he otherwise presents it as a physical source of natural force. In what is at once a celebration and an interpretation of the water-cycle, he sings the mountain's influence on the world below. The snows from the peak of Mont Blanc descend first as glaciers, then as mountain torrents, and then, these torrents flowing together, as the Arve, "one majestic River, / The breath and blood of distant lands" (11. 123-24). The snowy peak, the source of all this water, represents cause; the life in the valley oi the Arve and the distant lands, its effects; and the waters, both frozen and liquid, the means-by-which cause operates on its effects. Here water flows from a snowcap and not a well or fountain, a variation on Shelley's usual practice when dealing with water. Like Mont Blanc, "Ode to the West Wind" makes liberal use of natural force imagery, and the alternation of this imagery with per sonification is extensive. The source of West Wind the breeze is West Wind the personified Spirit. This Spirit represents causal energy, spe cifically the energy by which Power, through its subaltern the West Wind, cancels the year. The West Wind's breath or breeze (Shelley plays on the double meaning of "spirit") is the means-by-which cause reaches it effects literally. The leaves, clouds, waves (i.e., natural ob jects) are the physical effects of this cause. But the breeze is also an intellectual breeze operating on the thoughts of men, particularly on the thoughts of Shelley's persona; the leaves are "Pestilence-stricken multitudes" (1. 5); the clouds are the hair "Of some fierce Maenad" (1. 21); and the Mediterranean Sea is an awakened giant. Does autumn come because the West Wind invades the land or because a spirit commands the spirits of the land? Shelley says both, and either way cause acts upon effects. At the conclusion of Adonais Shelley apostrophizes the One Spirit, his name for the Unknown Cause in this poem, as "That Light whose smile kindles the Universe" (1. 478). That is, the One Spirit, a per sonification of the source of all, is equated with the sun, the physical</page><page sequence="14">222 Zimansky source of all light. And in this passage, as in many others, Shelley combines not only images of personification and energy, but also different images of energy, for example, light and fire. The Light of the Universe is the source of all fire. The Light "kindles" the Universe. Elsewhere in Adonais we find fiery fountains, and there are so many /?g/? ?-radiating fountains in the poetry that they do not require illus tration. But neither the blending of different kinds of energy nor the blending of energy and personification ever obscures the meaning of the symbolism?source image can only be substituted for source image, effect image for effect image, agency of cause image for agency of cause image. There is a tremendous amount of surface variation in Shelley's imagery, but its underlying pattern is simple. Two more examples of Shelley's use of natural force imagery: In The Witch of Atlas we know that the Witch is a personified subsidiary cause because the forest creatures acknowledge her a ruling Power. They are her effects. But to them, she is also like the sun. Her beauty makes "The bright world dim" (1. 138), and she must weave a veil (11. 145-52) to moderate the intensity of the light she casts on those around her. In Adonais Adonais' Splendours are compared to "flocks, whom near the living streams / Of his young spirit he fed" (11. 75-76). The source (cause) of this stream of energy, here a stream of water, is Adonais: the sheep/Splendours the "stream" nourishes are Adonais' effects. Often, as here and in the other line from Adonais discussed above, Shelley presents a complete image of cause acting on effects in only a few words. Images of effects are harder to recognize than images of cause, so in interpreting passages it is best to determine first what images represent the "stream" and what the Power or the source of the "stream," or all three, and only then what they are acting upon. Effects tend to be discrete objects or persons occupying the periphery, or at least not the center, of a subsidiary Power's sphere of influence, but in the two examples just given we find effects as diverse as the forest spirits and animals surrounding the Witch of Atlas and the metaphoric sheep fed by Adonais' streams. Among Shelley's favorite images for effects are stars, flowers, leaves, buds, trees, fruit, odors, and visions. However, since the effects of a cause are themselves the causes of a lesser order of effects, some of these images can also be used as images of cause. A star in Shelley is the effect of the sun, but the cause of much else. Only by paying attention to the context in which an image is used can the reader safely tell whether in that context it primarily represents cause, effect, or both. On occasion Shelley so combines his two imagistic systems that</page><page sequence="15">A Symbolism for Shelley's Poetry 223 we find Powers riding the stream of energy. In order to alter the lives of her Egyptian subjects, the Witch of Atlas sails down the Nile in a boat and delivers her message in person. Here the stream imagery still serves to show the connection between higher and lower Power but has been supplemented by the actual journey of the superior Power: journeying Witch is symbolically equivalent to flowing Nile. Similarly, in Epipsychidion the sudden illumination of the dark, Dantean wood around Shelley's persona is supplemented by the Bea trice-like appearance of Emilia Viviani. Though Emilia is so radiant that she herself can be said to produce the light, we can also think of her as a superior Power that has ridden the sunbeams to earth. Downward journeys represent descents of the pyramid of causes, upward journeys ascents. Because the flow of causal energy is down ward, descent is easy but ascent difficult. For a Power to descend it need only commit itself to the stream of energy?sometimes, like the Witch, making use of a vehicle?but to ascend it must use its own energy to go against the current. Powers usually descend the pyramid of causes in order to transact important business?symbolically the delivery of energy to a subsidiary?and, having done so, return home. Like the Witch, whose hermaphrodite powers her upstream (11. 385-408), they make the return journey wondrously, often using a magic boat or magic chariot piloted by a winged subsidiary Power. No ordinary means of locomotion suffices to go against the stream of energy. These returning Powers ascend in much the same manner as those more ordinary Powers who, otherwise incapable of change of level, suddenly receive a large amount of energy from above, except that the latter, if they use a vehicle, must get it, like their energy, from the higher Power that commanded the journey. The shallop which takes the poet in Alastor to the strange realm above "the abyss" (1. 395) of death materializes from nowhere, a gift from above.13 13 Alone of Shelley's works Prometheus Unbound locates Unknown Cause (Demo gorgon and whatever unnamed associates he might have) at the center of the earth rather than at the edge of the sky, with the result that down is up and up is down. Thus, Asia's journey to Demogorgon's throne is a journey up the pyramid of causes and her return to the surface of the earth a journey down it. The first of these journeys is very difficult, requiring the aid of Spirits presumably sent by Demo gorgon?("We have bound thee, we guide thee; / Down, down!" [II.iii.90-91])?be cause she is going up the stream of energy. The second is very easy because, like a boat to the sea, she is going down it: My soul is an enchanted boat, Borne to the ocean, I float down, around, Into a sea profound, of ever-spreading sound. (II.v.72-84)</page><page sequence="16">224 Zimansky IV I conclude with the symbolic significance of Power's dwelling. In "Speculations on Metaphysics" Shelley compares the mind to a cave and proclaims the difficulty of truly knowing its contents: . . . thought can with difficulty visit the intricate and winding chambers which it inhabits. It is like a river whose rapid and perpetual stream flows outwards;?like one in dread who speeds through the recesses of some haunted pile, and dares not look behind. The caverns of the mind are obscure, and shadowy; or pervaded with a lustre, beautifully bright indeed, but shining not beyond their portals. If it were possible to be where we have been, vitally and indeed?if, at the moment of our presence there, we could define the results of our experience,?if the passage from sensation to reflection?from a state of [passive perception]14 to voluntary contemplation, were not so dizzying and so tumultuous, this attempt would be less difficult. (Julian, vn, 64) We have here an essential clue to the symbolism of the dwelling. The temple, palace, cave, flower-bell, bubble, or other enclosure a Power inhabits represents its sensorium, the size and character of this en closure reflecting the nature of the Power. Given Shelley's emphasis on the difficulty that attends any conscious journey we might attempt into the cave of our own mind (all that think do dwell there un consciously: "thought can with difficulty visit the intricate and winding chambers which it inhabits"), it may seem odd that in his poetry so many Powers (for example, the Tyrant of the Golden City in Canto V of The Revolt, Prometheus and Asia in Acts III and IV of Pro metheus Unbound, and the Witch of Atlas in the first half of her poem) not only have access to their dwellings, but live in them. But it is precisely the mentally aware, the mentally heroic?characters strong for good or evil?who are the central subjects of Shelley's poetry. Sym bolically, these Powers know the contents of their minds. Alternatively, we can read these accounts of Power in its dwelling as poetic visions in which the poet sees the Power's mind and its contents clearly whatever the Power's own perception of them. In the center of almost all of the enclosures Shelley describes in detail is, in the case of temples and palaces, a throne, and, in the case of caves, a well or fountain (he uses the terms "well" and "fountain" interchangeably). Both these items represent the inhabiting Power's 14 The brackets, which are not found in Julian, I take from E. B. Murray ("An notated Manuscript Corrections of Shelley's Prose Essays," K-SJ, 26 [1977], 15) where Murray uses them to indicate a conjectural addition, probably by Mary. He explains: "Mary could have supplied this very likely insert from another note or MS, as well as from her own memory of S's insistence that the mind is passive in perception."</page><page sequence="17">A Symbolism for Shelley's Poetry 225 causal energy, the throne by metonymy with the Power?who often sits on it?the well or fountain because energetic waters are collected in it or flow out from it, or both. All the other objects native to the dwelling, objects more on its circumference than at its center, are effects of this energy, effects which, as the "Speculations" passage im plies, are usually termed thoughts. Objects native to the outside of the cave are things. The Power usually has a measure of control over these as well, especially the object:; most immediately surrounding its dwell ing?objects such as fruit trees or evergreen forests and their spirit and animal inhabitants. Thus, for Shelley things are less in our power than thoughts, the externally originating less in our power than the internally originating, but both classes of objects are subject to the causal energy we mysteriously receive from higher Powers; both classes can become our effects. The Witch of Atlas' cave provides good examples of the symbolic aspects of a Power's dwelling. In its floor is "a secret fountain" (1. 56) which reflects the Witch's moods, growing "dark and azure" when she weeps and yet bright enough for her to spell out "scrolls of dread antiquity" or embroider "pictured poesy" (11. 241-52) when she chooses to perform these, her principal domestic activities. At night the Witch slumbers in the fountain; in winter, she hibernates in a second foun tain (a displacement of the first) in the sacred wood outside. As for circumferential objects, the cave contains "wondrous works of sub stances unknown . . . Carved lamps and chalices, and vials" (11. 201 206), all infused with divine energy and several specifically held to have their own sphere of causal influence: sheaths encase "Visions . . . Some eager to burst forth, some weak and faint / With the soft burthen of intensest bliss"; "odours in a kind of aviary" are "each . . . an adept, / When loosed and missioned" at stirring "sweet thoughts or sad, in destined minds" and, though not personified as are the visions and odors, her "crystal vials" of medicinal liquors can cure men's sick souls (11. 161-84). Outside the cave less personal, less essen tial instruments of the Witch?camelopards, elephants, serpents, lions ?inhabit the wood of the magic mountain she governs. In addition to The Witch of Atlas, extended descriptions of caves and wells occur in Prometheus Unbound (III.iii. 10-63) and Epipsychidion (11. 483 572), and there is a detailed description of a temple with a throne in The Revolt (Canto I, 11. 556-666). All these dwellings, and of course many others, are surrounded by the Power's territory with its fruit trees, evergreen forests, anc spirit and animal inhabitants, all repre senting that portion of the universe of things over which the Power holds sway. Two final notes: First, since the radiant (or, in the case of tyrants,</page><page sequence="18">226 Zimansky tawdry) objects filling the dwelling or covering its walls largely serve to characterize the mind of the inhabiting Power, it is not always neces sary for Shelley to include a throne or a well to suggest the Power's energy. Still he usually does so. Second, the boundaries of a Power's territory are usually implied rather than specified and represent that portion of the external world it is most able to influence. These bound aries expand and contract in sympathy with changes in the Power's energy when they occur. v Though we can save Yeats's essay only by ignoring his reliance on Plato and Porphyry, once we do so the magic of his scholarship re turns. The symbolism I have outlined begins in Shelley's poetry only with Alastor (albeit rather obscurely), Mont Blanc, and "The Hymn to Intellectual Beauty," which is to say after his return from the Continent with Mary Godwin. For the most part Shelley's caves are the source of rivers and streams, yet in some cases?for instance, Rous seau's cave in The Triumph of Life?water does flow through them, suggesting that the stream or river is connected with some higher Power or that the Power inhabiting the cave has descended that stream from some higher level. Obviously, in order to show the cause and effect symbolism of Shelley's images I have had to ignore their diversity and their in genuity. Shelley is a monist (everything is ultimately Power) and, like others of this tribe, a reductionist, but his poetry celebrates the variety of the universe even as it reduces it. In the end we must see both surface and symbol at once; we must see Adonais as both Keats and a Power; must see Shelley's caves as caves, but also as minds containing thoughts. Shelley had tremendous doubts about himself and his poetry. Both were unpopular; and yet he continued to write in the same way, with only a few exceptions, from 1815 until his death in 1822. It may well have been the excitement of his continual discovery that the diversity of the visible world concealed the underlying relationship of cause and effect that held him to this reckless course, but whatever the reason, we must rank him one of the most systematically symbolic of English poets.</page></plain_text>
