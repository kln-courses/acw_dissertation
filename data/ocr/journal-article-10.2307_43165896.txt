<plain_text><page sequence="1">Song of the Sea Otter. Edith T. Hurd. 40pp. $8.95. Pantheon Books, 201 E. 50th St., New York, NY 10022. 1983. (Early ele- mentary) The story of the sea otter from birth to adulthood is told in a gentle, informative, though anthropomorphic, manner. The spe- cial adaptations of the sea otter to life in the water are illustrated as the otter encounters gulls, dolphins, and other creatures of the sea and shore. Soft gray drawings enhance the otter's adventures. The story is suitable for young children as an introductory book about sea otters. However, presenting the sea otter's "dreams" of life on land as a remnant of the animal's evolutionary past may stretch the anthro- pomorphism a bit too far. Mary H. Cordier</page></plain_text>
