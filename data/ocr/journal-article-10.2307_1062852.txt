According to Aboriginal traditions this song records the Dulingbara response to seeing HMS Endeavour passing Australia's coast. The date would have been Sunday, May 20, 1770. Such a claim would be disconcerting to those who maintain that Aborigines were initially incapable of cognitively grasping Western cultural phenomena.2 This, however, is not an exceptional case.

For a people who buried their dead in the sand, the self-inhuming crew must have constituted a powerful image. Indeed the suggestion that the sighting may have been interpreted as a portent is intriguingly appropriate.5 Less than two decades later death had landed. The year after the arrival of the First Fleet the initial lethal epidemic erupted. Collins gave an eyewitness account of the horror of the event. In the year 1789 they were visited by a disorder which raged among them with all the appearance and virulence of the smallpox. The number that it swept off, by their own accounts, was incredible. At that time a native was living with us and on our taking him down to the harbour to look for his former companions those who witnessed his expression of agony can never forget either. He looked anxiously around him in the different caves we visited: not a vestige on the sand was to be found of human foot; the excavations in the rocks were filled with the putrid bodies of those who had fallen victims to the disorder; not a living person was anywhere to be met with. It seemed as if, flying from the contagion, they had left the dead to bury the dead. He lifted up his hands and eyes in silent agony for some time: at last he exclaimed "All dead! All dead!"6 I. INTRODUCTION: DEATH AS AN ETHNOGRAPHIC CONTEXT In this article I reinterpret early accounts of Aboriginal religion in southeast Australia in their ethnographic context. That context was death and dispossession. Everything we know of this region comes from records made after the titanic population declines that followed 3 I. M.

Even in Collins's account, which is our only significant eighteenth-century source, we read of one "tribe," reduced to three people, "compelled to unite with some other tribe, not only for their personal protection, but to prevent the extinction of their tribe."7 By the 1830s, when missionaries and explorers began to compile their hasty and superficial reports of Aboriginal religious life, only one-third of the quarter of a million people in New South Wales and Victoria survived. By 1850, ten thousand people-4 percent of the 1788 population-were alive.8 And it was yet another generation before the first serious account of the region was provided by Smyth in his The Aborigines of Victoria ... (1876). Works of the standard of Howitt's The Native Tribes of South-East Australia and R. H. Mathews's numerous articles, themselves severely wanting by current ethnographic standards, were the best part of half a century away.9 To massive population declines caused by disease we must add the fact that these early accounts appeared in the wake of dispossession of traditional lands through either pastoral pressures or the effects of blatant racial hatred. This was not an issue in the immediate vicinity of Sydney and by the 1830s only about five hundred Aborigines remained within a radius of two hundred kilometers of the town. Thus, for example, the first mission to Aborigines, founded in 1826 at Lake Macquarie, was forced to close in 1837 because only three inmates had survived.'? Such diminution, coupled with a rapidly growing White population, led to the assertion that this region had been "pacified."" Farther afield, however, hostilities continued as intensive pastoral activity spread, using primarily convict labor. Under these conditions, Aborigines were compelled to leave their homelands and form new social aggregates on the outskirts of towns, on the few benign sta- tions, or on mission settlements. Those refusing to comply were 7 Ibid., p. 497. 8 N. Butlin, Our Original Aggression: Aboriginal Populations of Southeastern Aus- tralia, 1788-1850 (Sydney: Allen &amp; Unwin, 1983), p. 147.

As early as 1825 Baron Field made the melancholy prediction that "in a few years, perhaps, the corrobory will be no more."15 This became the catchcry of the nineteenth- and early twentieth-century studies of Aboriginal religions and the sworn duty of investigators was to salvage remnants of traditions that were seen as being no more than the shattered ruins of the glory that was pre- colonial religious life. What has rarely been seriously entertained is the possibility that the southeast Australian religious heritage could have been adapted so as to accommodate the devastating effects upon social and territorial organization. My thesis is not only that Aboriginal worldviews were restructured but also that Aboriginal people responded, as Koepping has suggested, "with great, and almost feverish speed to new chal- lenges."16 I contend that the major changes had already occurred by the 1830s when the initial reports on Aboriginal religions were being prepared. Indeed, even at a prima facie level, it is virtually impossible to conceive how Aboriginal traditions in this region could have sur- vived had it been otherwise. Needless to say this is a radical interpretation of the religious life of southeast Australia. With the exception of one paragraph and one footnote, I am unaware of any mention of the possibility of major 12 Reece, pp. 21 ff. 13 C. D.

The dynamics of religious adjustment were entirely beyond their re- search programs, and change was considered by them to be sympto- matic of forgetfulness, loss, degradation, and, ultimately, extinction.19 It is a simple matter to employ the wisdom of hindsight to criticize early scholars. As far as possible I wish to avoid this pointless exercise, but one ethnographer receives careful scrutiny in the fol- lowing pages. Alfred Howitt's classic study of southeast Australia, after the best part of a century, retains its authoritative status. Sig- nificantly, Howitt is the only Australianist to receive a separate entry in the recent Encyclopedia of Religion.20 His seamless presentation belies a rather ruthless tendency to edit from his writing data contra- dictory to his general thesis. As John Mathew wrote to R. H. Mathews the latter a fine researcher whose studies rivaled Howitt's and which were consequently totally ignored in his magnum opus- "The trouble with Howitt is that European writers seem to take him as the sole and absolute authority on South East Australia whose ipse decit [sic] is final. He is leading several of them astray on important points."21 As a passionate advocate of the unchanging nature of religion in the southeast he has, I believe, led all of us astray. My exposition is in two parts. The first part documents major changes in the relationship between people and places consequent to depopulation and dislocation. I show that following the failure of initial overtures to locate White invaders within the preexistent struc- tures of space, Aboriginal people subsumed key elements of Western 17 E. Kolig, "Post-Contact Religious Movements in Australian Aboriginal Society," Anthropos 82 (1987): 255-56 and n. 7. Kolig does not explore the significance of the changes he hints at but simply dubs them "syncretisms," which he relegates to the position of "the most facile method of reforming a belief system" (p. 255). 18 For an overview, see Swain, Interpreting Aboriginal Religion (n. 9 above), pp. 30-39, 79-85, and 93-98.

This was linked to a notion of cosmic instability and the possibility that the reestablishment of moral equi- librium might only be attainable by purging the world of intrinsically bad (evil) elements. I argue, however, that Aboriginal people resisted allowing that possibility to become a desideratum. The first part (Sec. II), which I call "Utopia," is about a revolution in the Aboriginal understanding of space. Section III concerns time. I show that balance, instead of being a ritually maintained reality, became increasingly articulated as a radical and somewhat threaten- ing future event. I discuss innovative ritual practice and, in particular, those that appear to have "millennial" and "cargoistic" elements. I suggest, however, that these terms prejudice our understanding of Aboriginal religion in postcolonial southeast Australia. I call the second part (Sec. III) "Eschatogony," which I define to encapsulate the essence of these peoples' temporal predicament-"the origin of the end of this world." II. UTOPIA LOCATION AND UTOPIA We must accept the limitation that we will never be able to satisfac- torily reconstruct precolonial religious life in southeast Australia. To pretend otherwise is delusion. What we have to work with are fre- quently contradictory reports recorded following devastation, death, and dispossession. While ethnographic contradictions are the bane of scholarship and at times the hallmark of confused research, textual analysis suggests another source of these "inconsistencies." I consider many of them to be reasonably faithful records of Aboriginal peoples' presentations of a range of beliefs at variance with each other. Let me unambiguously state that I am not advocating a version of Levy-Bruhl's thesis of a prelogical mentality. Certainly Aboriginal people maintain contradictory beliefs, but from my experience they are quite aware of the paradox this creates. Far from ignoring contradic- tion, they savor its expressive chromatic tension. Indeed, recent analysis indicates that Aboriginal societies expend considerable energy in actually forestalling the possibility of resolving opposition and paradox.23 22 "White," as I use the term, refers to colonial racial classification and not to skin color. The capital W indicates this usage. 23 See especially D. H. Turner, Life before Genesis: A Conclusion (New York: Lang, 1985); see also B. Glowczewski, "Australian Aborigines, Topology and Cross-Cultural 200</page><page sequence="7">History of Religions My own field research in central Australia confirms this opinion. The Warlpiri with whom I worked have been in contact with White Australians for approximately the same period of time (although with less devastating results) as the Aboriginal peoples of southeast Aus- tralia had been when the first reports on their culture were being written. I encountered two opinions concerning the fate of Warlpiri patri-spirits. In the more traditional version the spirit returned to the local site from which it had emanated. In the other version, inspired by both their social and intellectual encounter with Whites, the spirit ascended to an unspecified place in heaven. Individual people held both views simultaneously, perceived the contradiction, and for the time being at least, had no intention of resolving it. As I have argued elsewhere, such assertions articulated far more evocatively their ex- periences of the dilemmas of invasion than any form of syllogistic or synthetic logic.24 When discussing the two opposed orientations of Warlpiri religious thought, I employed J. Z. Smith's distinction between locative and utopian visions of the world, the latter being used in its strict sense to mean a valuation of being in no place (Gk. ou, "not"; topos, "place").25 It was the recent experience of applying these categories to a con- temporary religious tradition in a state of transition that made the ethnographies of the southeast suddenly appear to me in a very different light. My reading of these texts indicates the coexistence of locative and utopian cosmologies in New South Wales and Victoria in the nine- teenth century. Readers of Howitt's classic study will not detect this dual religious orientation as he has judiciously edited one scenario from the work. He concludes his survey of beliefs in the afterlife, for example, by asserting the "universal" belief that the spirit "finds its way to the sky-country, where it lives in a land like the earth, only more fertile, better watered, and plentifully supplied with game."26 It is surely noteworthy that, with a few significant exceptions (which support rather than counter my general thesis),27 this under- standing radically opposes Aboriginal opinion in the rest of the Analysis" (paper presented at the Fifth International Conference on Hunting and Gathering Societies, Darwin, Australia, August-September 1988). 24 T.

In a sequel to this article, entitled "The Earth Mother from Northern Waters," I will explore the 201</page><page sequence="8">A New Sky Hero continent, but more intriguing is its variance with other reports from the southeast. Howitt's shunned rival Mathews, for instance, main- tained that Kamilaroi spirits or gundhaddyiba followed the Barwon river upstream to live beneath the mountains at its source.28 Other people on the southern Victorian coast are said to locate spirits on islands off the coast and to bury the dead with their heads toward their "clan/phratrie" island.29 The Dhu:rga of southern New South Wales, according to Mathews, direct spirits toward the country of the deceased's mother. Indeed, Howitt himself, with no indication as to its significance, produces an illustration of burial procedures in which the corpse's head is pointed toward the land of its "clan and totem."30 This again suggests greater significance being attributed to the loca- tion of spirits than Howitt's conclusion would allow. In fact, if the fickle evidence of archaeology is employed, we might even suspect that the relationship between the dead and territory played a more central role in the southeast than elsewhere in Australia.31 The origin of human spirits is an equally divided issue. Montagu concludes his survey of the literature for this region by highlighting the anomalous lack of "reincarnation" beliefs, yet Mathews wrote of localized spirits waiting to be "reincarnated."32 Although early eth- nographies are devoid of references to spirit essences residing in the land, a late survey conducted by Radcliffe-Brown revealed that, by formulating appropriate research orientations, one could uncover information concerning "increase" rites and ceremonies in northern New South Wales, including several places for the increase of djadjam or human babies.33 Such data, like the reference to the return of the influence of Macassan and "Baijini" contacts on north Australian traditions; here it must suffice to note that the presences of utopian lands of the dead seems to be coterminous with the occurrence of what K. Maddock calls "transcendental powers, i.e. The All-Father of the southeast and the All-Mother of the north" (The Australian Aborigines: A Portrait of Their Society [Harmondsworth: Penguin, 1974], pp. 112 ff.). The connection between a supreme ancestral being transcending specific social affilia- tions and nonlocative spirit abodes is developed below. Finally, northern beliefs, like those of the southeast, also reveal internal contradictions. Thus, e.g., the single Yolngu term birimbir denotes a spirit that both returns to a waterhole to await rebirth yet travels to a distant land of the dead (see R. M. Berndi, Australian Aboriginal Religion [Leiden: Brill, 1974], fasc. 2, p. 24). 28 R. H.

Calley, "Aboriginal 202</page><page sequence="9">History of Religions deceased's spirit to specific earthly sites, suggests the presence of a locative tradition at odds with Howitt's utopian model of a vaguely defined heaven-dominated cosmology. Another textual contradiction concerns what Nancy Munn very aptly called "the transformation of subjects into objects."34 In some accounts from the southeast there is a preponderance of transforma- tions of subjects into other subjects (e.g., humans into birds), which, in comparison with myths from other regions, have a rather impov- erished "just-so" story quality. Even more atypical is the dominance of transformations of ancestral beings into nonlocated sky dwellers.35 R. M. Berndt claims, mistakenly I think, that "in Wuradjeri belief, all 'totemic' beings went to a place named Wantanggangura 'beyond the clouds and sky."'36 In other accounts, however, and in particular those associated with increase sites, we do encounter abundant refer- ences to ancestral beings transforming into identifiable places in the landscape.37 My interpretation of these contradictions, some of which are ap- parent in the works of eminent anthropologists, is that they reflect a twofold cosmological orientation. The locative tradition, which seems to approximate traditional beliefs found elsewhere in Australia, em- phasizes the association between creative powers and sites, and the affiliation of human spiritual essences with these places. It stresses ubiety and earth-based powers. The utopian tradition, on the other hand, removes both human and ancestral spirits to an otiose sky realm and, as I will show, consequently defines the sacred realm as standing in a single, ubiquitous relationship with all people. The coexistence of dual cosmologies in postcolonial Aboriginal Australia is a widely spread and well-documented phenomenon.38 It is a major component of what Aboriginal people today consider to be Pentecostalism: A Study in Change in Religion, North Coast, NSW" (M.A. thesis, University of Sydney, 1955), pt. 2, p. 25. 34 N.

In most Aboriginal cosmologies specific regions of the sky also have a locative mythic nature, although sky- and earth- dwelling ancestors may belong to discrete linguistic categories. The sky does, however, lend itself to becoming the region of unlocatable ancestors. 36 R. M.

What is peculiar to the early southeast is not the plurality of cosmologies per se but the dominant position that utopian vision ultimately achieved. While locative elements, as I have shown, persisted into the twentieth century, they were no longer central to religious activities. This, I will suggest, reflects the life experiences of people in this region. Unlike Aborigines in remote Australia, invasion was for them a reality so devastating as to render impossible the maintenance of a locative religious life.39 At the same time, the utopian understanding of the cosmos, for reasons that will become apparent, increasingly articulated their existential condition. I will discuss this matter presently, but proceed initially by briefly considering some of the tragically unsuccessful attempts by Aboriginal people to ally colonists with their place-based religious traditions. LOCATING INVASION In a penetrating analysis of Aboriginal appropriation of White Aus- tralian myth, Deborah Rose has identified a central intellectual con- cern to come to grips with a dilemma of colonization: "that of locating conquest in any sort of moral order."40 One attempted resolution of this dilemma was reported frequently from frontier situations, but does not appear to have persisted long as a significant factor in structuring colonial ethnic relations. It is symptomatic of a general poverty of scholarship in this area that these conciliatory overtures have typically been misunderstood as no more than a quaint instance of Aboriginal failure to comprehend novel events. I refer, of course, to the frequently noted classification of Whites as deceased Aboriginal people. It is a serious misrepresentation to suggest that Aborigines saw their invaders as "ghosts" or "spirits." Certainly there may have been initial perceptual errors on both sides of the frontier, but, like the European ethnoclassification of Aborigines with subhuman species, the identification of Whites with deceased relatives was a conceptual equation. Unlike White Australian taxonomy, however, the social implications of the Aboriginal construct were generous to a fault.41 Christianity into Traditional Aboriginal Religion" (B.A. honors thesis, University of Queensland, 1987). 39 Elsewhere in Aboriginal Australia, less severe dislocation has given rise to strate- gies for maintaining spiritual contact with homelands from which people have been separated (see R. Tonkinson, "Aboriginal Dream-Spirit Beliefs in a Contact Situa- tion," in Berndt, ed., Australian Aboriginal Studies, pp. 277-91). 40 D. B. Rose, "Jesus and the Dingo," in Swain and Rose, eds. (n. 5 above), p. 361. 41 I have discussed some European racial taxonomies and their location of Aus- tralian Aborigines in Interpreting Aboriginal Religion (n. 9 above), esp. chaps. 1 and 2. 204</page><page sequence="11">History of Religions In the Sydney region alone there was initially a wider range of interpretations of Whites. While at Port Stephens they were identified as previous "countrymen," there was no such tradition at Port Jack- son.42 Mahroot, the last survivor from the Botany Bay district, on the other hand, said of Phillip's crew: "They thought they was the devil when they landed first."43 Other models were also explored.44 It seems, however, that the "deceased kin" classification was felt to be the most satisfying, and it subsequently dispersed from region to region, often in advance of the Whites themselves.45 The value of defining intruders as deceased kinsfolk was that it provided a mechanism for expanding the preexistent cosmologically and morally established social order to accommodate alien people. While a "malevolent spirit" category would have an inherent logical attraction, it would place White Australians outside the domain of sanctioned human relationships.46 The generosity and genius of equat- ing invaders with departed relatives was that it invited them to modify their behavior and (re)establish morally acceptable interactions with their former kin. This explains the impassioned concerns, frequently reported in mocking tones, of Aborigines to identify their specific relationships with Whites.47 The "recognition" of Buckley and Grey as kin are cases too well known to need retelling.48 A quotation from Eyre, empha- sizing both kinship and location, reveals the persistence of Aboriginal people in this regard and the frustrations they experienced: "It is a general belief among almost all the Aborigines, that Europeans, or white people, are resuscitated natives, who have changed their colour, and who are supposed to return to the same localities they had Whatever his excesses may be, I think Levi-Strauss must be credited with bringing to our attention the conceptual orientations of The Savage Mind (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1970). 42 Collins (n. 6 above), p. 454. 43 Cited by K.

The most puzzling point, however, with this theory, appears to be that they cannot make out how it is that the returned natives do not know their former friends and relatives. I have often been asked, with seriousness and earnestness, who, among the Europeans, were their fathers, their mothers, and their other relatives."49 Such offers to affiliate were, at a broader level, offers to accept small parties of Whites as cohabiters of land under the charter of the principle of an Aboriginal spatial ontology. To be socially related to members of a locative religious tradition, such as those I maintain to have existed in precolonial southeast Australia, was to be geographi- cally placed, on the one hand, and spiritually linked to site-based ancestral powers, on the other. More accurately, social groups, places, and mythic beings were but various interrelated manifestations of an all-embracing Law. The reasons for the failure of attempts to locate invasion are as obvious as the results were tragic. There are records indicating that Aborigines anticipated the impossibility of Lawful territorial coexis- tence with Whites and thus adopted ritual practices traditionally reserved for removing spirits living in the wrong place. Mitchell, for instance, reports an encounter with Aborigines who made ritual over- tures "to induce us to go back, whence we had come, and as I felt we were rather unceremonious invaders of their country, it was certainly my duty to conciliate them by every possible means." To this end he took out his pistol and fired a shot. "As if they had previously suspected we were evil demons [?] and had at length a clear proof of it, they repeated their gesticulations and defiance with tenfold fury, and accompanied their action with demonic looks, hideous shouts and a war-song crouching, jumping, springing with a spear, and throwing dust at us as they slowly retired."50 That this ritual practice was not merely the result of perceptual error is substantiated by the persistence of these practices well after close communications with Whites had been established. Ridley, for instance, having noted Whites were classified as deceased relatives immediately proceeded to refer to elaborate all-night ceremonies "to drive away the spirits of the dead."51 But the spirits of the dead did not leave. Nor would they establish sanctioned relationships with Aboriginal people. Offers of alliance 49 E. J. Eyre, Journals of Expeditions of Discovery into Central Australia (London: T. &amp; W.

In 1845 Bishop Polding reported to the Parliamentary Committee on the conditions of the Aborigines that "there is established in the mind of the black population a sentiment that the whites are essentially un- just ... founded on the fact of the whites coming to take possession of their lands." J. D. Lang disbelievingly questioned: "Do you think they have such an idea of the value of land, as to lead them to the view its settlement is an act of aggressions?" Polding replied: "I am convinced of it, and I think that it is the root of the evil."52 It was rapidly realized that, by the standards of an Aboriginal land- based Law, White Law was indeed "unjust" in essence. The challenge could not, in the last analysis, be met by locating the invaders within the existing order. Rather it was necessary to establish a means of accommodating what were seen as fundamentally immoral people. In the remainder of this article I will argue that the Aborigines of southeast Australia were left with no other genuine option than sub- suming some of the ontological principles of the invader's own cos- mology. I am not referring to syncretisms or mythic borrowings, although these did occur, but to a major reformulation of their understanding of the nature of existence. My argument is that in this area there occurred what Rose presents as, to date, a tentatively entertained possibility for Aboriginal people in northern Australia. She writes of the appeal of Pentecostal cosmology: "It encapsulates conquest, providing a moral frame for brutality. And it mirrors social processes of invasion and conquest, offering a larger frame in which conquest, undertaken through immoral means, is granted moral values. It thus offers at least the illusion of resolution to the paradox of conquest through a radical reforming of cosmic principles."53 In the following pages I suggest that southeast Australian religious life, as portrayed in the bulk of the records we have, reveals precisely the hallmark of restructured cosmological principles fashioned to mirror processes of invasion. THE UTOPIAN VISION It should be made quite clear that Aborigines in early colonial southeast Australia were not in any conventional sense becoming 52 "Report of the 1845 Parliamentary Committee on the Condition of the Abori- gines," reprinted in Aboriginal Land Rights: A Submission to the Federal Ministerfor Aboriginal Affairs on the Preferred National Land Rights Model, Catholic Commis- sion for Justice and Peace (CCJP) Issues, no. 4 (Sydney: CCJP, 1985), app. 1, p. 19, emphasis added. 53 Rose, "Jesus and the Dingo" (n. 40 above), p. 373. 207</page><page sequence="14">A New Sky Hero Christians. This did not occur. At best, by mission standards, "success" was superficial and short-lived.54 More common were reports that Aborigines disdained the new teachings and institutions and enjoyed the opportunity to gently, but very humorously, ridicule their proselytizers.55 It was, furthermore, not until the mid-twentieth century that eth- nographers began to produce evidence that Aboriginal people in this area had equated the "old Law" with Christian myth, although un- published documents do suggest a link extending these syncretistic developments back to the time of Mathews's and Howitt's field re- search.56 The only explicit identification of Aboriginal and Christian beliefs in the nineteenth century was noted, much to his later chagrin, in Howitt's own writing.57 His sensitivity as a student of religious dynamics is clearly revealed in the following passage: "Being desirous of learning what Brewin, Bullumolut, and Baukan were supposed by the Kurnai to be, I questioned two of the most intelligent men. Both were Tatungolung-one, a member of the Church of England, the other an intelligent savage and a scamp. I said, 'What is Brewin?' They consulted, and after a few minutes one of them said, 'We think he is Jesus Christ.' I said 'Well, I think you had better consult again.' ,58 While Aborigines avoided aligning themselves with Christian insti- tutions and mythic traditions, they nevertheless extrapolated from the 54 See J.

Some investigators claimed that "upon cross-examination" Aborigines confessed that "they had learned [cer- tain beliefs] from a missionary or some resident in the district,"59 but if this was so it merely underscores their reluctance to identify with the established forms of their conqueror's creed. On the other hand, the restricted nature of these beliefs does not, as Eliade and others suggest,60 indicate that they were autochthonous but only that Abori- ginal religious innovation had subverted these elements into the secret realm-a process that has been unambiguously documented elsewhere in Australia.61 The principles, which I believe Aboriginal people in southeast Australia adapted from White discourse and society, postulated a radical and unbalanced dualism that was poised to achieve stability by resolving into a singularity.62 Unlike the pluralistic premise of their locative cosmology, which rests on the discrete yet affiliated site- based socioreligious units (sometimes federated into balanced recip- rocal pairs), the eccentric dualistic orientation disempowers places and deprecates this world, which stands in impoverished opposition to the utopian skyworld. This opposition contained a momentum 59 This statement was made by J. F. Mann in response to J. Manning's "Notes on the Aborigines of New Holland," Journal and Proceedings of the Royal Society of New South Wales 16 (1882): 255. 60 M. Eliade, Australian Religions (n. 18 above), p. 7; A. Lang, "Australian Gods: A Reply," Folk-Lore 10, no. 1 (1899): 31-32. Eliade is also mistaken in claiming that "the belief [in the All-Father] was witnessed before the installation of Christian missions" (p. 7). The earliest reference to Baiami in fact comes from the second mission to Aborigines at Wellington. The first, as I have noted, was established at Lake Mac- quarie in 1826. We should not, however, confine Christian influence to missions. Marsden's school at Parramatta began in 1814 and had a substantial proselytizing role. Even in the eighteenth century Collins wrote, "The young people who reside among our houses were very desirous of going to church" ([n. 6 above], p. 455). A variation of this argument, used by Howitt and others, depends on finding All-Father beliefs in isolated pockets where missions had not penetrated. My thesis, elaborated below, is, however, that we are dealing with a cult spreading in advance of missions. C. G. Seligman's "An Australian Bible Story," Man 16 (1916): 44-45, provides a nice example of how this occurred in Cape York Peninsula. 61 I was explicitly told by Warlpiri people of central Australia that a secret cult recently imported from the West contained Christian and Islamic mythemes. While their accounts do not fully document this element, see E. Kolig, "Djuluru: Ein Syn- kretistischer Kult Nordwes Australiens," Baessler-Archiv 27 (1979): 419-48; and B. Glowczewski, "Manifestations symboliques d'une transition economique: Le 'Juluru' culte intertribal du 'cargo,'" L'Homme 23 (1984): 7-35. Also see R. M. Berndt and C. H.

The specifically Aboriginal contribution to this worldview was, as I will later argue, to deny it its fulfillment. Utopian cosmology in the southeast of Australia begins with a single creator. This again suggests a mythic contradiction as there are well- documented narratives for this region explaining how a multiplicity of ancestral beings transformed the country.63 As Kolig suggests, "All that was essentially required was to place this [monotheistic] figure outside and above the totemic and kinship order, thus elevating him to a status more exalted than the other beings of the theorimorphic pantheon who remained tied to the order to which the whole universe was thought to be subject."64 The consequences of this deceptively simple move were, however, monumental. Residing with the All-Father were the total potentiality and re- sponsibility for establishing moral, social, and geographic order. Our earliest reference to the All-Father comes from the Wellington Valley Mission. Reverend James Gunther says of the Wiradjuri, "There is no doubt in my mind that the name Baia-mai... refers to the Supreme Being; and the ideas held concerning Him by some of the more thoughtful Aborigines are a remnant of original traditions prevalent among the ancients of the Deity."65 He proceeds to argue that Baiami has three of the attributes of the biblical God-eternity, omnipotence, and goodness. He had created the entire world but long ago decided to leave this earth. From his heavenly realm he rewards and punishes people and through mediatory son Daramulun he knows all things. A similar account, based on notes written in 1844-45, was provided by James Manning. Several critics have accused this author of em- bellishing his report with Christian details, although they were in accord with the underlying cosmic principles he proposes (they are, for instance, identical with those suggested by Howitt).66 I find these ontological principles every bit as alien as the specific details and hence see no prima facie reason to dismiss them. As Manning himself suspected some White influence, and subsequently checked his infor- mation to ensure its accuracy, I am further inclined to believe that he faithfully reported what he was told by Aboriginal people.67 63 Some clear examples can be found in Radcliffe-Brown (n. 33 above), passim. 64 Kolig, "Post-Contact Religious Movements in Australian Aboriginal Society" (n. 17 above), p. 256. 65 Cited by W. Ridley, Kamilaroi and Other Australian Languages...

Out of his loneliness he creates his son Grogorogally who mediates between heaven and earth. "The son's spirit they represent as being in every part of the habitable world, spreading-as was expressed to me-over the sup- posed distance of England to Sydney."68 Another intermediary, Moodgeegally, was the first human who now lives in an earthly paradise and periodically ascends by a path called Dallambangel, complete with ladders and steps, on a three-day journey to heaven. Leaving the anachronistic details to one side for the time being, the theme of a single creator who leaves the earth is solidly supported by the ethnographies for this region. Instead of the more usual Aborigi- nal cosmogony in which a host of transformative agencies come ultimately to reside at myriad earthbound localities, there is only one source of spiritual vitality dwelling beyond the world. As R. M. Berndt says, "All power, whether religious or magical, emanates from Baiami."69 Power, in brief, has been displaced to become utopian. From the All-Father's oneness, however, emerges a duality caused by his departure from the world. Sky and earth stand opposed and the latter is impoverished. I have already quoted Howitt's opinion that there was a "universal" belief that the spirits of the deceased ascended to a paradisical heaven. When a Wellington Valley woman was asked where she would go at death she replied "to Heaven, I believe."70 In this utopian scenario spirits do not return to the earth. Eyre's exceptional account only proves the rule: "One old native informed me, that all blacks, when dead, go up to the clouds, where they have plenty to eat and drink; fish, birds, and game of all kinds, with weapons and implements to take there. He then told me, that occasionally individuals came back, but that such instances were very rare."7' That the fate of the human spirit denies the possibility of returning fertile essence to ancestral localities is, by Aboriginal standards, anomalous enough, but even more disconcerting is the frequently reported claim, supported by Howitt, that the earth was depreciated by Aborigines in the southeast. This is already evident in previous passages in this article. To them I add Ridley's account: "As for a 68 Ibid., p. 160. 69 R.

Many of them die with a cheerful expectation of being soon in a 'better country.'2 Little imagination is required to understand why Aboriginal people in this region were predisposed to supplement and to some extent replace their locative religious traditions with another that tran- scended specific social affiliations with sites. As Maddock observes, the All-Father undermines kin-based affiliation with ancestral beings by asserting that all people stand in an identical relationship with the single cosmic power. This, he notes, sits comfortably with the Christian tradition's assertion of the brother/sisterhood of all people, but in Aboriginal societies produces a distortion between social and cos- mological realms.73 Why this tension was tolerated and, indeed, en- couraged is understandable if we see the All-Father not as an aberration in a locative site-kin religious tradition but as a dislocated utopian innovation developed as a response to the destruction of the relationship between people and their countries. In a region where death devastated traditional social networks, and dispossession broke ties with the land, there could be little hope of maintaining the cosmos through a locative tradition. In a single move the All-Father created a new, potentially pan-Aboriginal, social base and removed the cosmo- logical center of gravity beyond known places to an unspecified realm in the sky. This, however, is only the first level of analysis, for the spatial structure of the cosmos has a moral counterpart. THE MORAL STRUCTURE OF SPACE A central feature of traditional Aboriginal Law was the concern to maintain a stable balance of spiritual, social, and environmental elements. "The cosmos," Rose suggests, "can be seen as a closed, self- regulating system which seeks a steady state in which all life is maintained at optimum levels of productivity, knowledge, and so on."74 Homeostasis is achieved through a pluralistic network in which specific people take responsibility for regenerating the spiritual poten- cies residing at localities with which they are identified. In such a religious ecology nothing is dispensable. An ideology of unchanging balance demands the constant regulation of the temporal world so that it conforms to the Law. What this cosmology cannot accom- modate is nonregeneration or, so to speak, system leaks. 72 W. Ridley, "The Aboriginal 'Murri' Race of Australia," Nature 10 (1874): 521-22. Sometimes the "better country" is equated with England. A Tasmanian example of this can be found in Ling Roth (n. 46 above), p. 55. 73 Maddock, The Australian Aborigines (n. 27 above), p. 127. 74 Rose, "The Saga of Captain Cook" (n. 5 above), p. 29. 212</page><page sequence="19">History of Religions The removal of spiritual essences from the earth that I have docu- mented was, of course, one notable disruption to the equilibrium of this worldview. Essentially it postulated that the world could not maintain itself but rather was dependent upon another largely un- known and otiose domain. The moral counterpart to this view was the concept of evil. The idea of evil is usually, and quite rightly, said to be absent from traditional Aboriginal thought.75 Unlike the notions of "wrong" and "bad," evil postulates an intrinsic corruption. To be evil is not to disobey the Law but to be incapable of being restored to a Lawful state. A cosmology that admits evil can no longer achieve balance through regeneration alone, and typically the understanding is that ultimately there is no option but to purge the world of its irredeem- ably immoral components. From my discussion earlier of the failure of Aborigines to persuade Whites to enter into sanctioned relationships with them, we can deduce that Aboriginal people felt their invaders were beyond the Law and hence, from their perspective, evil. This encounter, I believe, was the experience that induced Aboriginal cosmology to admit the concept of evil. While in some contexts, as I will later document, Whites are specifically identified as the elements that must be abolished, it would be simplistic and, in a perverse way, somewhat vain to suggest that evil was a concept confined to the area of interethnic relations. Although invasion provided the conditions under which evil became a necessary ontological postulant, Aboriginal people were concerned less with Whites per se than with the broader problem of reestablishing some kind of existentially relevant Law. Evil thus emerged as a fundamental feature of the cosmos attributable to Aboriginal people as well as the colonists. The view that there are intrinsically immoral beings takes three forms. First, there are many references in the literature on southeast Australia to the All-Father having an adversary. In at least one account this is a subterranean creature with long horns and a tail-a striking image for a country with no indigenous horned animals.76 In many versions it is the All-Father's relative who takes on the malevo- lent role. In an early report of this kind Strzelecki wrote: "They do not dread the Deity; all their fears are reserved for the evil spirit, who contrasts the doing of the 'Great Master'; and consequently it is to the 75 See R. M. Berndt, A Profile of Good and Bad in Australian Aboriginal Religion (Adelaide: Charles Strong Memorial Trust, 1979). 76 Augustus Oldfield, cited by Tylor, "On the Limits of Savage Religion," Journal of the Anthropological Institute 21 (1891): 292; cf. Manning (n. 59 above), p. 162, where the reference to a bullock head is more ambiguous. 213</page><page sequence="20">evil spirit that religious worship is directed."77 In another version Baiami's brother who lives in the far west is prone to irrational and immoral behavior, sending smallpox epidemics for no other reason than he was vexed that he did not have a tomahawk.78 Because of the ease with which Western researchers can project the notion of evil onto Aboriginal beliefs I am reluctant to rely too heavily on this first category, although in the wider context of reports from this area they do not seem anomalous. The second category, while ambiguous, is more telling. The ambiguity is that it is uncertain whether evil resides with humans or the All-Father himself. It is frequently stated in the descriptions of the Sky Hero that his creative goodness and wrathful fury are somewhat at odds with each other.79 He is particularly associated with introduced epidemic diseases such as tuberculosis, pneumonia, and smallpox.80 In one early reference to initiation ceremonies in the Hastings River district the All-Father is asked to spare the neophytes from smallpox.81 Is the omnipotent Sky- Father himself prone to unprovoked Lawless fury? Or is his action a just response to the evilness of humans? We are not unequivocally told. Manning describes Baiami as a "benevolent though dreaded being. When any recover from sickness or other calamity, it is sup- posed their guilt has not been too great to pardon."82 In other accounts, however, the god's anger does not seem to have been reasonably provoked. Although I have found no evidence establishing a direct link I am inclined to suspect that Aborigines inherited this ambiguity from the god of their conquerors. Thus when Threlkeld reflected on the closing of the first mission to Aborigines he said that although many had died while resisting invasion "most died by the act of God."83 The same man, who was liberal for his time, attributed the Tasmanian population devastation to "the will of God."84 In the third category that establishes the notion of evil, it is quite clear that it is a human attribute. Although there are constant refer- 77 P. E. Strzelecki, Physical Description of New South Wales and Van Diemens Land (London: Longman, Brown, Green &amp; Longman, 1845), p. 339. 78 H.

There was, apparently, a need to judge the dead in order to free heaven of earthly imperfections. Cameron, a reliable reporter, took pains to verify the authenticity of what he suspected as Christian doctrine.85 While these are clearly notions alien to traditional Aboriginal thought his infor- mant flatly denied any foreign influence. Upon death the released spirit confronts two roads. The cleaner one, maintained by malevo- lent entities, leads to an unhappy fate. Other tests are presented, including a challenge of strength against the All-Father himself. Those who fail are thrown to a fiery destructive pit.86 Assistant Protector Parker wrote of Bunjil subjecting the spirits to an ordeal of fires to determine whether they were good or bad. The good are liberated, but the bad suffer for an indefinite time.87 Before proceeding to pull together the arguments of this section I must comment on some of the mythic details in the data I have just presented. Clearly there are elements of Christian doctrine here, and I have deliberately chosen examples revealing these details. Since the nineteenth century, scholars have been aware of their presence. E. S. Hartland, who lists more examples than I have space to include, suggested such details only crept in long after colonization.88 Andrew Lang, in turn, correctly pointed out that they were present in even the earliest records-a claim Hartland was forced to accept.89 My cita- tions are all very early and underscore Lang's point. What neither of these early anthropologists noted, however, was that identifiable Christian mythemes actually progressively decrease until by the turn of the century, they had all but vanished. The radical ontological dualism (sky vs. earth, good vs. evil), on the other hand, persisted. What I believe we see in the earlier more conspicuously Christian versions is therefore not, primarily, a case of mythic borrowings but, rather, the appropriation of fundamental cosmological principles to which certain mythic elements initially and rather incidentally ad- hered. Once the structure of the postcolonial Law was established, Christian narrative segments were replaced by those that were more authentically Aboriginal. 85 Berndt, in "Wuradjeri Magic and 'Clever Men'" (n. 69 above), uses A. L. P.

The most conspicuous features of this cos- mology, which I have detailed, can now be summarized in four points. 1. All existence and all power derives from a single source. 2. From that singularity a duality emerged between earth and heaven. Ultimate significance and Law resides in the latter, non- locative or utopian domain. 3. The earth is consequently depreciated in comparison with the sky realm, and its maintenance as a closed system is undermined by a dependency upon the potency of the heavens. 4. Morally, the earth again loses its capacity for self-regulation, and the future of a homeostatic process of regeneration becomes problematic as parts of the world are intrinsically Lawless or evil. I suggested earlier that these religious innovations emerged to render colonial life meaningful by mirroring the process of invasion. I have argued that the idea of evil arose out of (although was not confined to) the Aboriginal understanding of Whites as an immoral and unLawful people. Conquest simultaneously fractured the living spiritual relationship of people with their lands, although I have shown that knowledge of locative beliefs persisted in a secondary capacity into the twentieth century. The impoverishment of the earth was indeed the experience of dispossessed Aboriginal people for whom religious identity shifted from place to utopia. Finally the notion of unequal duality is, as Turner has so insightfully shown, the fundamental premise for conquest which, rather than accepting a plurality of socioreligious units, proceeds by subsuming the other into the one, resulting ultimately, and often eschatologically, in a reestab- lished monism.90 Given this summary of the new Aboriginal cosmology we might suspect that their vision of the eschaton anticipated and welcomed an imminent millennium. It is precisely here, however, that Aboriginal thought diverges from our expectations. For while Aborigines were willing to accept an image of the world informed by an ontology of invasion, their soteriology largely denied monistic solutions. Such a stance, in a sense, rejected their new cosmology's right to fulfill itself. Why this should be so, and how it was ritually possible is the subject of the next section of this article. 90 For a discussion of these principles, see Turner, Life before Genesis (n. 23 above), and "Transcending War" (n. 62 above). 216</page><page sequence="23">History of Religions III. ESCHATOGONY MILLENNIANISM It has become something of an anthropological truism that Aborigi- nes do not envisage the end of their world order. Thus, for example, Berndt writes as follows about the lack of Aboriginal eschatological themes: "They may become emotionally upset owing to physical circumstances, and see their culture toppling around them; but as far as we know they cannot really envisage complete destruction, the cessation of the 'eternal dream time' stream, and the life they know, even under the most intensive and disastrous form of contact."91 While Berndt has quite correctly highlighted the rarity of references to an eschaton he has, I believe, misrepresented Aboriginal thought by suggesting this possibility "cannot" be envisaged. Burridge cor- rectly counters this stereotype by asserting that "from the moment they perceived [Cook's] ship ... millenarian activities among Aus- tralian aborigines became possible," and the following data indicate that southeast Australian Aborigines clearly articulated the likelihood of an imminent end to their world.92 Given their inability to continue the maintenance of the balance of the cosmos through the spatially discrete rituals of a locative tradi- tion, and given the simultaneous emergence of the notion that some parts of the world possibly could not be made Lawful and hence might need to be withdrawn from the socioreligious ecology, it is not difficult to appreciate why Aboriginal thought was directed toward the future. In a sense the emphasis on temporal change and futurity emerged as a consequence of the disequilibrium of space.93 Postcolonial southeast Australian religious life focused on forth- coming events. One of the notable features of the "clever man" of this region was his ability to "thrust his mind forward into the future."94 The vision, however, was unclear. On the one hand there appears the promise of the millennium in which Whites are destroyed. On the other there is the looming threat of an end to Aborigines themselves. I will examine these possibilities in turn, examining particularly their respective capacity to resolve the dilemma of unequal dualism. 91 R. M.

Lang reported: "The native spectators groaned whenever a blackfellow fell, but cheered lustily when a white bit the dust; and at length, after the ground had been fought over and over again, the whites were ignominiously driven from the field, amidst the frantic delight of the natives."96 While this appears to have been an open ceremony or corroboree, this does not negate the importance of the performance. The general disposition toward Whites was, furthermore, identical to that found in ritual intended to have very tangible consequences. The earliest reference that I have encountered hinting at millennial expectations comes, appropriately enough, from the Sydney region. Collins wrote in the late eighteenth century of an Aboriginal woman who lived in the clergyman's home and who predicted Whites were soon to encounter major misfortune. The portent was a shooting star. "To the shooting of a star they attach a degree of importance, and once, on an occasion of this kind I saw the girl Boo-roong greatly agitated and prophesying much evil to befall all the white men and their habitation."97 Collins does not mention the suggested cause of the stellar activity, but it would be reasonable to infer that, in keeping with information collected from a later period, it was understood to be due to the activities of the "clever men." A similar case was witnessed by the explorer Eyre. He observed a comet on March 2, 1843, and an Aboriginal informant interpreted it as "the harbinger of all kinds of calamities, and more especially to the white people. It was to overthrow Adelaide, destroy all Europeans and their houses, and then taking a course up the Murray, and past 95 Reproduced in A.

It was sent, he said, by the northern natives, who were powerful sorcerers." 98 The major millennial movement of the nineteenth century was the clever man-controlled Molonga cult. I have not found direct evidence of it spreading into the region I am discussing, although it was documented skirting its entire boundary from north to southwest.99 Howitt, who extends his survey of southeast Australia into the Lake Eyre basin, does include reference to Molonga, which he illustrates with three photographic plates.100 Like Roth and Bates, however, he totally failed to comprehend its significance. According to the mis- sionary Siebert the cult's focus was a future war between Aborigines and Whites that climaxes with the appearance of Ka'nini, the spirit of "The Great Mother of the Water" who swallows all the colonial Australians.101 Returning eastward into Victoria we do find details of at least one form of millenarian practice. In unpublished notes Howitt briefly describes a ritual in which one large and two small (serpentine?) figures are cut in bark and painted. Men, and often women also, danced in single file holding aloft small "wands" of tufts of feathers, and then proceeded to reverently touch the carvings. The purpose of this practice was to get the great serpent Mindi to destroy their enemies.102 Mindi, says Smyth, was concomitant with epidemic diseases. When Mindi is active, people do not stop to bury their dead but leave the district fleeing for their lives.103 The association of the serpent with what were almost certainly diseases introduced at the time of coloni- zation was particularly appropriate, for according to both W. Thomas and E. S. Parker, Mindi was about to take the lives of all Whites in the southeastern Victoria area irrespective of their attitudes toward Aborigines.104 The incantations and rituals were, however, not ad- dressed to Mindi but to Bunjil, as the serpent acted only on the All- Father's command. Parker wrote: "It is believed to be in the power of 98 Eyre (n. 49 above), p. 358. 99 To the north, see W. E.

Given the track record ethnographers in nineteenth-century Aus- tralia had for missing new religious movements, we might reasonably expect there were many other millennial and nativistic developments that passed unnoticed. Even if their presence was substantially larger than my sample suggests, however, I do not feel they would have achieved the type of major religious reorientation necessitated by the emergence of the imbalanced cosmos that I documented in Section II of this article. The examples I have cited were, furthermore, oriented toward rectifying concrete and relatively transitory injustices-speci- fically, the arrest and imprisonment of members of their community.'06 To some extent these expectations of the demise of Whites were homologous with earlier practices in frontier contexts designed to remove territorial invaders (supra), but in the later cases there could be no genuine hope for the preservation of the precolonial locative traditions. Thus although I have labeled these beliefs "millenarian," and in doing so have merely replicated a common academic tendency to abuse the term,107 I know of no evidence that Aboriginal people saw the removal of Whites as itself adequate to ensure the salvation of the earth. While the promise of the millennium may have held some attrac- tion for Aboriginal people, and while they perhaps at times embraced its redemptive offer, I would suggest that what, in the final analysis, preserved the major Aboriginal response as a truly Aboriginal re- sponse was the fact that it resisted the temptation to resolve an imbalanced socioreligious dualism into a monism. To remove Whites and bring the utopian sky realm to earth would have produced a homogeneity even more divorced from pluralistic traditions than postcolonial life itself. I will argue in the remainder of this paper that the dominant and persistent Aboriginal orientation was not to over- throw earth with heaven or Whites with Aborigines but, rather, to 105 Cited in ibid. 106 This was emphasized both by Thomas in Smyth; and by Eyre (n. 49 above), pp. 358-59. 107 See G.

THE ESCHATON In contrast to the momentary upsurge of hope in a future without Whites, the persisting and starkly realistic view of the eschaton was one that comminated the extinction of Aboriginal life. The failure to regenerate the Law, and perhaps the presence of Lawless beings, threatened the cosmos itself. In one graphically vivid apocalyptic expectation the heavens and earth were about to merge into a formless, flooded mass. The belief, which bears a striking similarity to those associated with the innovative Kimberley Kurrangara cult,108 was recorded that unless tomahawks were sent to the old man at the end of the earth who tended the pillars that propped up the sky, the heavens would fall, bursting the oceans, and causing a flood in which all people would be drowned.109 In another documentation it is noted that European materials-axes, saws, ropes, and tiers of dray wheels-had been stolen from settlers and passed from community to community in the hope of reaching the guardian of the posts. Fearing their efforts may have been too late they began to calculate which of the mountains in the district would provide them with the greatest chance of escaping the rising waters.110 We are not told who the old man at the earth's end is, but in a Kamilaroi story that also foretells the end of the Aboriginal world, it is Baiami who dwells in the distant west instead of his more usual sky home."' As Baiami is, as I shall presently explain, often cited as the cause of the eschatological flood, there is a possibility that the two traditions are mythically related. The incompleteness of the records makes a certain evaluation on this matter impossible. The Baiami of the west is described in a rather unusual narrative published by R. H. Mathews. The hero of the story is Yooneeara, a Kamilaroi "chief" who decides to travel to Baiami's home. The chron- icle has, by Aboriginal standards, a disconcerting historicity to it, and there is nothing to suggest that Yooneeara's journey was anything other than a this-worldly event. On reaching the far west he finds 108 A comprehensive summary of ethnographies of the Kurrangara is provided by Koepping (n. 16 above).

The more significant point is not earth vs. sky but location vs. utopia. 221</page><page sequence="28">A New Sky Hero Baiami is asleep, shares a meal with the god's daughter, and returns home only to die from the effects of sorcery encountered during his ordeal-ridden trip.112 All this seems pointless enough, but Mathews's informant police officer, C. A. Brewster, wrote to Mathews to the effect that the published version was incomplete.13 After the meal, he asks about Baiami's brother, and Baiami, who is now awake, replies that he and his brother had caught a large cod fish which foretold "the fall of our dynasty." To avert disaster they caught the fish and, supposedly to prove it was harmless, Baiami cooked and ate the cod. His brother, however, thought this an act of greediness and left for the east; he "had gone away from Australia, and... even [Baiami] did not know where to." This enigmatic end to a prophecy of disaster for Aboriginal people is frustratingly obscure. While the strong utopian emphasis is in keeping with the ethnographies of this region, we do not know the significance of the brotherly schism or the brother's departure to an unknown place beyond the vision of even the all-seeing Baiami. The hero of the journey nonetheless leaves, telling the god he will relate to his people all he has heard. If, however, Baiami was associated with the possibility of imminent disaster, we would be justified in expecting this to have a major ritual manifestation. This, I suspect, raises what will be the most contro- versial aspect of my exposition. I believe we have a great deal of documentation for the relevant cult, but have once again mistaken innovation for unchanged tradition. The ceremonies I refer to are most commonly known as Bora. Such a claim will no doubt extract cries of disbelief from scholars committed to the notion that Aboriginal religious traditions are in- herently conservative. I am not, of course, suggesting that initiation ceremonies did not exist in southeast Australia prior to 1788. That would be a patently absurd claim. There is, notwithstanding, evidence that the rituals of initiation took on new forms and meaning fol- lowing colonization. Indeed, I cannot conceive how they could have maintained their relevance had this not occurred. In the following passage, K. L. Parker makes it abundantly clear that the Bora was the primary Yualyai vehicle for preventing the eventuation of the envisioned eschaton. 112 R. H.

The reason of this must surely be that the tribes fell away from the Boorah rites, and in his wrath Byamee stirred from his crystal seat in Bullimah. He had said that as long as the blacks kept his sacred laws, so long should he stay in his crystal seat, and the blacks live on earth; but if they failed to keep up the Boorah rites as he had taught them, then he would move and their end would come, and only the Wundah ... be in their country."4 To understand how the Bora could prevent Baiami "stirring"-an act that is in some sources said to cause the final flood and maintain the Aboriginal place in the world order, it will be necessary to examine the symbolic structure of the rite. BORA In his unpublished notes Howitt refers to a myth in which Bunjil initially created two men. One of them was light and had straight hair. The other was dark and had curly hair."5 If the All-Father had made both Aborigines and Whites it would logically follow that he was ultimately responsible for their respective life-styles, cultures, and Laws. The Bora grounds, which are in part manifestations of the All- Father's first camp, do in fact reveal this dual creation. The documentation we have of Bora and cognate ceremonies is, unfortunately, very poor. Although we have many truncated descrip- tions of the physical attributes of the grounds and performances, there is virtually no exegesis at all as to their significance or meaning. R. H. Mathews claimed to possess a "mass of information" of this kind that he planned to publish, but the work never eventuated and the notes have not survived.I"6 While we will therefore never be able to genuinely penetrate the depths of these cults, the incomplete data we have is enough to demand we reevaluate some of our academic preconceptions about their cosmological message. To begin with a minor example, the glass plates made by Kerry of a Bora ceremony contain photographs of ground sculptures of two 114 K. L.

Some interpreters might simply dismiss this as "magical" prac- tices extended to new food sources, but there are several reasons why this would be an overly hasty understanding. First, comparative studies of initiation symbolism, and especially the use of "increase"- type rituals in such contexts, indicates that their significance does not primarily reside with their ability to procure foodstuffs but rather in their meaningful affiliations with the neophytes.'18 Second, pork was apparently unpalatable to Aborigines; a fact that was frequently reported while noting the "similarity" with Jewish and Muslim cus- toms. Third, although cattle were eaten, they were often killed in numbers exceeding those dictated by survival strategies. It was, for one, a way of hindering settlement without risking the repercussions from killing Whites themselves. And prized sections of the animals were used in ritual. The Sydney Morning Herald for October 3, 1842, reports that in the Namoi district Aborigines had been driving cattle, killing many of them, and removing for the most part only their tongues and fat. It continues: "The blacks had a bora, as they call it, which signifies a meeting, and they danced with fat on their heads and beef upon their spears. Unless the stockholders make some effort to prevent them they will lose all their cattle: the blacks tell the men they are afraid to shoot them as the Commissioner will hang them." Mathews makes related observations. He records the Bora repre- sentation of a bullock formed by logs covered with earth. A dried skull was placed at the sculpture's head, while sticks were used to represent the tail. He found this icon on more than one occasion."9 We are never told why cattle are included in the ritual designs, but a passage in an early publication of Howitt's indicates that they do indeed belong in the representation of the All-Father's camp. Ac- cording to an old informant, Bunjil "possessed great numbers of cattle."120 Cattle were, of course, central to White settlement and were the raison d'tre for the colonial presence in much of southeast Australia. This is, I believe, the reason they were contextualized in Bora-type ritual. The "figures on the ground and on the marked trees are 117 Reproduced in R. M.

I will say more of this presently, but I must first proceed to show that cattle, while an apt symbol, were but one of a range of Baiami's gifts. Mathews, whose training as a surveyor inclined him at times to an almost compulsive measuring and recording of the layout of Bora grounds, is our best source for discovering references to components that are at odds with the research paradigms of the time. Even Mathews plays down such phenomena, noting them only in his more exhaustive surveys and even then neglecting to include them in dia- grams and speaking of them disparagingly as indications of "imitative faculties." That their symbolism was deliberate must have been un- thinkable. I will quote at length some of his descriptions: "At one ground there was a representation of a horse and parts of a vehicle, outlined by carving in the soil. . . and near a stump which was naturally in that place, was the effigy of a blackfellow of sticks and old clothes, like a scarecrow, having round his neck a string from which was suspended a crescent shaped piece of tin resembling the brass plate sometimes given by Europeans to aboriginal kings."122 At this ground was also a representation of a bullock and a grave containing old clothes. At another ground was "an effigy made by filling an old pair of trousers and a coat with grass so as to resemble a man and a bundle of something being used for the head. This figure was then propped up against a small tree and represented a white fellow."123 A range of more traditional figures are then described although some of these, such as the codfish, quite possibly had a reference to postcolonial life (supra). More unexpected are the fol- lowing items: The imitative faculties of the natives were displayed in a few drawings, copied from scenes in the life of the white men, which were intermixed with the others. At one place an attempt had been made to represent a railway train, the carriages with their windows, the numerous wheels, and the two rails on which they were running. At another place a native artist had drawn a chain like those used when working bullocks in a dray. The links of the chain were on a colossal scale, being four feet nine inches long, and one foot three inches wide. The chain was close to the raised figure of the bullock previously 121 Mathews, "Aboriginal Bora Held at Gundabloui in 1894," p. 114. 122 Ibid., pp. 1 10-11. "King" was the title given by colonists to Aborigines who wore the brass plates. 123 Mathews, "The Bora of the Kamilaroi Tribes," p. 142. 225</page><page sequence="32">A New Sky Hero described. Another draftsman, apparently a poker player, had succeeded in representing the four aces. Four rectangular spaces, about two feet long and eighteen inches wide, were first made side by side to indicate four cards, and on the middle of each of them one of the aces was delineated.124 The dendroglyphs or carved trees of the Bora grounds were also said to represent the All-Father's camp and gifts. These highly geo- metric designs are mostly undecipherable without the help of Abori- ginal interpreters. Some initiated Aboriginal men this century have associated the designs with Christian symbolism, but even as early as 1858 there were references to European cultural items depicted on the trees.'25 Thomas Hall wrote of a Gidabal Bora ground just over the Queensland border in which one of the trees revealed a ship in full sail.126 IV. CONCLUSION Given the range of European items-cattle, horses, pigs, cards, trains, ships, and even effigies of Whites themselves-that appear in Bora sculptures, and are thus represented as the benefaction of the All- Father, we might be tempted to dub the Bora an initiatory version of a cargo cult and interpret it in terms of a general theory of cargoism. But this will not do. "Cargo," as Trompf states, "implies a totality of material, organizational and spiritual welfare, collectively desired as a replacement for current inadequacy, and projected into the imminent future as a coming 'salvation.'""27 Cargoism is not defined by the symbolic presence of European goods per se, but by the message communicated by those objects. Even in Melanesian contexts, as Burridge so perceptively reveals, it is not only a desire for com- modities that attracts but their symbolic moral significance as well.128 In Aboriginal Australia, where cultural objects are attributed a very different value to that ascribed to them in Melanesia, we should anticipate that the ritual meaning of White goods will be equally unique.129 124 Ibid., p. 146. 125 K.

While, as I have shown, there was some quasi- millennial activity in southeast Australia, it was of a transitory, almost pragmatic, nature. Bora, on the other hand, was oversha- dowed by a threatening apocalypse. I have already detailed examples of this mood, but no clearer statement of it is to be found than the central sculpture of the ceremony, the All-Father himself. Our earliest description comes from Henderson who writes, "The figure . . . repre- sents him in a recumbent position, as he is at present considered to be asleep. There is however a tradition, that once he awoke, and having turned himself on his side, the flood-gates of the salt ocean were immediately thrown open, and the hills and valleys disappeared be- neath the rolling waters. It is also reported, that when he next awakes, a similar catastrophe may be expected."130 Far from antici- pating total salvation or a millennium in which the heaven redemp- tively descends to earth, White cultural items are contextualized in a cult apprehensive of the eschaton and bent on (to use the apt Aborigi- nal image) propping up the sky whose collapse would only cause disastrous flooding. How, then, do we interpret the cultic innovations of southeastern Australia? I confess that the inadequacies of the data mean that any tidy answer must presume as much as it can prove, but I offer the following as the interpretation that I find most convincing. As I have shown, there were two options explored by Aborigines of the southeast in response to the emergent unbalanced dualism created by the dislocation of the traditional locative cosmology. Both focused on the future. The "millennial" vision of an end to Whites, while understandably having some attractions, was less prominent than the cults concerned to ward off an imminent and disastrous eschaton. Although the literature will not allow us to specify exactly how these two orientations were historically and sociologically related,'31 we can at least assert that the difference between them was that while the former orientation saw Whites as the central cause of specific worldly problems the latter, while clearly addressing issues of interethnic relations, conceptualized the problem in broader cosmological terms. Burridge expressed this succinctly when he wrote: "The problem is more urgent and more personal than whether they should be ruled by 130 J. Henderson, Observations on the Colonies of New South Wales and Van Diemen's Land (Calcutta: Baptist Mission Press, 1832), p. 147. 131 Koepping (n. 16 above), p. 402, distinguishes various social groups coming to the fore at different periods of Kimberley religious history. The texts of the southeast do not allow such detailed discrimination. 227</page><page sequence="34">A New Sky Hero white men. They want to know where they stand in the world as men. And they know that they can only do this with the help of Europeans- moral Europeans."132 Burridge proceeded to show that in Papua New Guinea access to European goods was in fact access to moral relationships.133 It seems that Aboriginal people also used symbols of European power and culture in attempts not to eradicate Whites or even to merely overthrow their hegemony but, rather, to reestablish moral relationships within an increasingly immoral world. In contrast to Melanesian cases, however, goods were not understood as indications of status or merit in Aboriginal Australia. Nor is there any evidence that Aborigines particularly prized the prospect of enhanced access to European commodities. I see no compelling reason to interpret icons of introduced animals and cultural objects as anything other than what they clearly were-symbols of central components of White life and Law. Bora designs thus brought what I have categorized as the origin of unLawfulness, immorality, and "evil" in Aboriginal thought within the confines of a new, broader Law. Baiami had introduced both Aboriginal and White culture and hence both were by definition Lawful. The aim of these ceremonies was not to naively return to a pristine precolonial life by destroying Whites but to maintain Abori- ginal identity within the cosmos by demarcating its place within postcolonial society. In brief, it aimed to define invasion as a morally controllable act. This was a precarious worldview; the threatened eschaton under- scored the dangers. The peril was tolerated because of the promise of the new cosmology. It did not resolve dualism into monism as mil- lennial hopes did. It did not overcome imbalance by having the one subsume the other. Rather, there was an attempt to simultaneously establish ethnic and cosmological balance, to allocate space to both Aboriginal and White Law, and in the face of total destruction, to shore up and demarcate the domain that can most deservedly be considered to have remained authentically Aboriginal. At the end of Section II of this article I listed four summary points which encapsulated the new order of the universe. I argued that the emergence of an unequal dualism from an original, single creative principle was an ontology replicating the process of invasion itself. I also suggested that the internal dynamics of such an understanding of 132 Burridge, Mambu, p. 243. 133 Ibid., chap 8, passim. 228</page><page sequence="35">History of Religions the world established a momentum that sought its place of rest and balance in a radically restructured future. I have shown that Aborigi- nal people of southeast Australia envisioned that future, on occasions welcomed its coming, but for the most part resisted the cosmos's urge to roll its eschatological waves over their land. The new Aboriginal ontology shared many features with that of their invaders. The central difference was their respective dreams for the future. Whereas in colonial Christian thought the world required the scouring intervention of the second coming, Aboriginal people trusted, as they still trust, in the powers of regeneration. V. POSTSCRIPT The sheer bulk of data anomalous to the thesis that Aboriginal reli- gion in this area was essentially conservative surely demands that we begin to reevaluate our presuppositions. I hope to have made a beginning to that process. We can at the very least be certain the new religious orientations diffused rapidly through colonial Australia. According to Bates, the Molonga cult (supra) spread from the Diamantina district in central Queensland to Penong on the central-south coast of Australia in just eleven years.134 Even if this figure is slightly exaggerated it clearlv reveals the effectiveness of cultic exchange between Aboriginal soci- eties. Howitt at times wished to deny that Gippsland initiations (Jeraeil), and particularly the representations of the All-Father, could have been influenced by more northerly peoples, yet on other occa- sions provided evidence that postcolonial innovation reached the area before Whites themselves had arrived.135 Indeed he actually notes institutionalized gatherings where the clever men came "to introduce such new beliefs or procedures as may have recommended itself [sic] to them."36 Others write of new songs and ritual that were communi- cated from the main regions of first settlement to distant communities of the southeast of Australia.137 Was the cult of Baiami itself a recent innovation? Our earliest record of it comes from the Wellington Valley mission. According to Horatio Hale, the first professional ethnographer in Australia, the cult had only reached the area in the late 1820s. "When the mission- aries first came to Wellington, the natives used to assemble once a 134 Bates (n. 99 above), p. 165. 135 Howitt (n. 26 above), pp. 505, 444. 136 Ibid., p. 641. 137 N.

This song was brought there from a distance by strange natives, who went about teaching it. Those who refused to join in the ceremony were supposed to incur the displeasure of the god."138 We have no written documentation of Baiami preceding the obser- vations at Wellington Valley and, thus, cannot establish where the "strange natives" came from. My thesis would suggest they came from a region closer to the Sydney frontier, and there is some, admittedly ambiguous, evidence that points in that direction. Accord- ing to McCarthy the iconography of the well-known "Devil's Rock" engravings depict the mythological motifs found in the ground sculp- tures of the Bora. Other observers, including Mathews, himself, did not make this connection, and it is far from a conclusive interpreta- tion.139 If McCarthy is correct, however, the truly interesting fact is, once again, the ethnographic editing in the published descriptions of designs. For among the other mythic representations, and equally weathered, is a representation of a sailing vessel that probably dates the engraving to the late eighteenth century.'40 Even more telling is an ochre painting that Macintosh claims to represent the same class of figures as the rock engravings of Baiami. Like the engravings, it depicts a male anthropomorph with out- stretched limbs and having eyes but no nose or mouth. It differs most conspicuously from the engravings, however, in one important respect. On the painted figure is a prominent pair of horns unambiguously announcing it a postcolonial mythic configuration.14' I cannot discern the thread of the Baiami cult back any further than this. What is clear is that whenever it is encountered, no matter how early, it is in association with change, innovation, and either the ontological principles or the cultural objects of White Australians. While producing a precise interpretation of its meaning is a task fraught with pitfalls, there seems to be abundant evidence that, whatever it once may have been, by the time reports of it were written, the Bora had become a cult adapted to colonial existence. The All- Father ceremony, if it was not a Wanderkult, then at the very least contained a "wandering" cultic component that transformed the ceremonial significance of the performances. 138 Hale (n. 78 above), pp. 110-II. 139 J.

For, so long as Aboriginal studies has existed, scholars have known that here was a phenomenon demanding explication. Howitt and his evolutionary colleagues did not hesitate to declare that the fertile climate of the southeast had allowed these Aborigines to advance in their religious development.'42 Both the evolutionism and environmental determinism of this claim were considered dubi- ous even when the thesis was first pronounced.'43 I also postulate an environmental causality, but one that is easily substantiated. It was the suitability of the southeast of Australia for European agriculture that established this region as the center of colonization. In his doctoral dissertation, A. P. Elkin offered a diffusionary explanation for the peculiarity of the southeastern beliefs that he maintained were historically connected with Twenty-first Dynasty Egypt.144 This pan-Egyptianism, while given far less prominence, persisted in his later writings on Aboriginal religion.145 Again, I have also employed "diffusionary" arguments (although I reject the passive connotations of the word) but see no reason to search beyond the period of the most radical event in the history of Aboriginal Australia-invasion. The most promising interpretation to date was given in Durkheim's classic study of Aboriginal religion. When he briefly focused his attention on the High Gods of southeast Australia, he intuitively grasped many of the most salient features of this cosmology. Tanta- lizing, inspired, and probably now totally beyond proof was his suggestion that a single sky-dwelling All-Father was an emergent transformation of one of the mythically paired birds heading moi- ties.'46 This he correctly identified as a shift from balanced, reciprocal "tribal" cults to a tradition stressing a single creative principle linked to an essentially "international" socioreligious base.'47 What induced 142 Howitt, pp. 499-500. 143 I have documented this in Swain, Interpreting Aboriginal Religion (n. 9 above), pp. 93-98. 144 A.

Durkheim, The Elementary Forms of the Religious Life (New York: Free Press, 1915), pp. 330-31. I suspect Durkheim first came across the idea of the All-Father as a metamorphosed moiety-linked ancestral being in N. W. Thomas's article "Baiame and the Bell-Bird," Man 5 (1905): 49-52. 147 Durkheim, pp. 331-32. The pan-Aboriginal quality of religious change in post- colonial Australia is emphasized in E. Kolig's The Silent Revolution: The Effects of 231</page><page sequence="38">A New Sky Hero these people to define themselves as "one," and against what their collective identity was demarcated, was something Durkheim should have preeminently been in a position to detect. He balked at the obvious answer, however, diverted by a totally inaccurate preconcep- tion about the dynamic flexibility of Aboriginal religions and the degree of European mission influence in the southeast.148 I welcome Durkheim's informed guess that the monistic sky-dwelling All-Father had transmutated from the balanced duality of once earthbound moiety-linked ancestral beings. And I have proposed the social envi- ronment that Durkheim required to explain why these Aborigines would feel compelled to abandon a view of a homeostatic and re- ciprocally ordered cosmos for one stressing instability and a single yet eccentric notion of power. Other explanations for the aberrant southeastern traditions could no doubt be fabricated by those with a taste for speculating into the distant past. If, however, we once admit the possibility that Aborigi- nal religions can rapidly adjust to a changing world, then surely we would do well to explore first the decidedly conspicuous climate for socioreligious innovation created by the processes of conquest. A statement made by a Wiradjuri man initiated at around the time Howitt and Mathews were undertaking their field research encapsu- lates the mood, if not the detail, of my position. His words were these: "He was always amongst the people long ago . . when the white people came out to Australia, Baiami heard that they were coming. He then got 'frightened,' and cleared away."149 Although we each use a language appropriate to our own cultures and to the audiences we respectively address, I like to believe that we are both expressing different facets of a common understanding. If so, then I am content that I am keeping good theoretical company.
