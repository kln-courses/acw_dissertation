Harry Austryn Wolfson is a scholar of extraordinary merit. A teacher and profes- sor at Harvard from 1915-1958, he has worked significantly and productively in 145</page><page sequence="2">146 JEWISH SOCIAL STUDIES the fields of philosophy and religious phil- osophy for most of this century. In Dr. Wolfson's honor, and for his seventieth birthday, the American Academy for Jewish Research planned to issue a Jubi- lee Volume. Unfortunately, the project was delayed several years, and the Jubi- lee Volume finally appeared as a tribute to Dr. Wolfson on the occasion of his seventy-fifth birthday. It is a formidable achievement, and consists actually of three volumes, two written in English and one in Hebrew, containing forty-nine articles and essays in all. In the opening paper, Leo Schwarz presents "A Bibliographical Essay," which is partially biographical as well. Dr. Wolf- son's writing career is traced from his earliest known public efforts, which were creative and poetic, through his monu- mental scholarly works on philosophy and religious thought. The essay con- cludes with a definitive bibliography of Dr. Wolfson's writings covering the period between 1912 and January, 1963. Mr. Schwarz's paper dwells primarilv on the literary and imaginative aspects of Dr. Wolfson's writing rather than on the technical philosophic contribution, citing various passages from his works that dis- play literary excellence. Dr. Wolfson's scholarly work is certainly rare in this re- gard; not only is he a master of substan- tially all philosophic and religious writing from the pre-Socratics through Spinoza, including Greek, Roman, Muslim, Jew- ish, and Christian texts, but his writing possesses literary value in itself. Among the selections Mr. Schwarz cites are sev- eral taken from Dr. Wolfson's occasional personal reflections on the religious phi- losophers he has studied. For someone (like this reviewer) who works within the Jewish community and is concerned with the adequate expression of its religious strivings in the present revolutionary age, these selections, added to others they call to mind, produce a certain feeling of un- easiness. When Dr. Wolfson steps out of his role as interpreter of other minds, and speaks as himself, we find a basic antagon- ism to philosophic religion barely con- cealed under a mask of deft irony and elegant style. The master of philosophic texts appears not to like what these texts say. Those philosophers of yesterday and today who attempt to rationalize and de- mythologize the anthropomorphic and supernatural religion of Scriptures are the target of derisive asides and evalua- tions that question their purposes as well as their accomplishments. Yet Dr. Wolf- son, who seems not to be a literal tradi- tionalist, never provides an alternative to the philosophic enterprise as the in- strument for coping rationally with the meaning of religion or Judaism, particu- larly in our time, an age so advanced that even the most scientific and rational in- terpretations of Scriptures and the universe in the Middle Ages appear themselves as so much fantasy and mythology. It is not possible within the brief com- pass of this review to discuss individual contributions to the Jubilee Volume. A few general remarks may be offered as a guide to interested readers. As is often the case regarding a Festschrift, there is no intrinsic connection uniting the various papers. Dr. Wolfson's work was relevant and important in many fields, and the varied contributions, which came from colleagues, fellow scholars, and former students, reflect this wide influence. One may say the Jubilee Volume is concerned generally with philosophy and religion. Aside from perhaps two papers, the aforementioned essay by Leo Schwarz, and one entitled "Secularism, God and Freedom," by Horace Kallen, the Fest- schrift is not for the general reader. It was written by specialists for fellow special- ists. By far the greatest number of articles are in the field of philosophy. Primarily these concern medieval philosophy, Jew- ish, Muslim, and Christian, (and discuss such philosophers as Ibn Bajja, Avicenna, Maimonides, Averroes, and St. Thomas); several relate to ancient (Aristotle and Plato) and modern (Spinoza and Mai- mon) philosophy; and one deals with con- temporary ethical theory. The next largest grouping of papers is in rabbinic studies, talmudic and gaonic, covering historical, dogmatic, and halachic problems. Among the remaining papers, Christian history and religious thought receive the greatest attention. Sundry other articles discuss</page><page sequence="3">Book Reviews 147 Yiddish philology, Hasidism, Jewish mys- ticism, Jewish folklore, and the Septu- agint. The many papers of high quality in the Jubilee Volume make it a memorable tribute to Dr. Wolfson, whose exceptional accomplishments have already earned for him a host of academic honors and awards. The Editorial Committee consist- ing of Saul Lieberman (Editor-in-Chief), Shalom Spiegel, Leo Strauss, and Arthur Hyman is to be commended for a task well done. Toward the conclusion of his essay, Leo Schwarz writes "His energy is demonic, and more wonderful still, it shows no signs of diminishing. Retired since July, 1958, he has not changed his way of living. He is still the first person to enter the Widener Library in the morn- ing and the last to leave it at night. There Harry Wolfson, the high priest of his craft, continues to fashion a contribution to philosophic literature unique in our time." May we long continue to reap benefits from this rare intellect.
