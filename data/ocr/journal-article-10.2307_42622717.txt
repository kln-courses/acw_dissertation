Those who study the Inca and their predecessors necessarily confront art without writing.1 South of Central Amer- ica, there was no tradition of alphabetic writing before the arrival of Europeans in the sixteenth century, nor were there glyphs or pictographs of the type seen in the manu- scripts of ancient Mexico. The absence of texts, however, does not foreclose interpre- tation,- it simply pushes us to explore other approaches for understanding the meanings embedded in materials and their forms. In this essay I use architectural sculpture from ancient Peru as a springboard for generating interpretative models. To a certain degree, both Elizabeth Boone and I are fundamentally concerned with the analysis of structure and form, but our distinct data sets prompt different questions and ways of answering them. As Elizabeth shows, the compara- tively abundant sources for Mexico allow an exploration of the historical particulars of Aztec graphic communication and develop- ment of a nuanced understanding of this type of expression within a cross-cultural context. By contrast, the absence of histor- ical particulars for ancient Peru encourages a focus on formal choices and their potential associated meanings. For those who concentrate on the Andean region, one of the methodological challenges arising from the absence of writing is how to study the art history of pre-Columbian cul- tures where there are no contemporary texts. It is one problem for the study of the Inca, who, despite being relative newcomers to political power, were dominant in the region at the time of the arrival of the first Spaniards in 1532 and thus were the subjects of eye- witness commentary. It is another for their predecessors, the cultures that flourished centuries, or even millennia, earlier. Though colonial-era texts occasionally mention a few earlier cultures, one may rightly question scholarly dependence on them, given the cultural upheavals, discontinuities, and inter- ruptions that characterized the region over the centuries.2 Andean art history is younger than the field known as Mesoamerican, the general term for the area once inhabited by the Aztecs, the Maya, and other groups. Until recently, Andean art was also less intensely studied, in part because of the absence of con- temporary texts. There are no major illus- trated manuscripts from Peru until the turn of the seventeenth century, several genera- tions after the fall of the Inca Empire. Instead of texts and illustrated manuscripts, the Inca used sophisticated recording devices known as khipu. Using these knotted-string bundles, the Inca managed to keep track of a sur- prisingly varied range of data, including accounting information and narratives. Despite some excellent recent studies on 73</page><page sequence="3">khipus, however, they remain of limited use for the sort of investigations art historians generally pursue.3 The absence of texts has restricted research in this field, for we tend to place a high value on texts and the cultures that produced them. Judgments aside, however, the absence of texts has also scared away the faint of heart for methodological reasons. Texts are considered critical to understanding emic views of history and culture. To be without them is to be at sea on an interpretive level. It is no surprise, then, that most art histor- ical studies of Andean material hover around the contact period, when the presence of colonial texts offers at least the appearance of direct observation and commentary.4 But how do we approach the visual culture of societies that existed earlier than the peri- conquest period? Let us consider the ancient city of Chan Chan as a case study. Chan Chan was the capital of the empire of Chi- mor, also known as the Chimú culture, and it flourished on the north coast of Peru between the tenth and fifteenth centuries C.E. (fig. i).5 Chimor was conquered first by the Inca in the fifteenth century, and then the Inca themselves were overthrown by Spaniards in the sixteenth century.6 The value of these colonial-era texts for under- standing Chan Chan is, therefore, necessar- ily circumscribed. Nevertheless, one short account provides a king list, and others more frequently mention the urban walled palaces that were the most striking architectural legacy of the Chimú.7 The descriptions of these palaces, however, are disappointingly brief and uninformative. Archaeology has told us far more about the nature of these palaces. Chan Chan is located in the Moche Valley, on a desert plain at the edge of the Pacific Ocean (fig. 2). The cold Humboldt Current off the coast gives rise to one of the world's richest marine biomasses, capable of supporting the development of complex societies well before the introduc- tion of agriculture.8 Under normal condi- tions, there is little or no rainfall in this area, although this aridity is interrupted periodically by El Niño-Southern Oscillation (ENSO) events. The city was founded across the Moche River from an earlier site, known simply as Moche or Huacas de Moche. Moche, the type site for the culture of the same name, was a major center in the Early Intermediate Period. This period is generally measured as starting at the beginning of the Common Era and ending c. 650, although recent research suggests that it may have lasted perhaps another hundred years.9 The Chimú culture rose in the same general area as the Moche, and in certain ways it can be considered a continuation of Moche culture in the Late Intermediate Period (1000-1450).10 The city of Chan Chan is an unusual one in that there is no central urban focus or plaza (fig. 3). Rather, the core of the city is dominated by ten monumental enclosures thought to be the palaces of the lords of Chi- mor.11 These in turn are surrounded by the houses of the lesser nobility, accommoda- tions for the many craft specialists who lived in the city, workshops, and other struc- tures.12 Ten palaces might seem excessive in a city of perhaps only forty thousand inhab- itants, but the Chimú, like the Inca, are believed to have practiced a system of split inheritance, so that the family of a deceased king retained the rights to the palace but not necessarily the right to rule. The new king inherited the right to rule but not the palace: each new king, therefore, had to build his i.

The palaces would therefore have been built sequentially, spread out across the landscape.13 The palaces are characterized by extremely limited access (fig. 4), with perimeter walls that once reached a height of eight to ten meters. Despite erosion from El Niño rains, the high walls are still impressive (fig. 5). Each palace has a single entrance to the north, and progress into the compound is impeded by a system of baffled entries. The interior spaces are of considerable size, with the smallest measuring some 87,900 square meters and the largest 22 1,000. 14 The palaces contained grand courtyards that could have held hundreds of people, extensive storage facilities, U-shaped structures known as audiencias, walk-in wells, and, usually at the southern end, a funerary platform, as the royal palace ultimately became the royal mausoleum. Salvage archaeology of one funerary platform suggests that perhaps three hundred young women were sacrificed to be buried with the king.15 My own work has focused on the archi- tectural sculpture of the site.16 The walls of Chan Chan are of sun-dried mud brick, and the reliefs were sculpted over these in a fine earthen plaster. Over the years, portions of the walls have disintegrated from the rains, leaving few reliefs visible today. One palace, called Tschudi, has been reconstructed for tourists, but otherwise the remaining palaces and their architectural sculpture are entombed through the wall-fall.17 Among the goals of our project were the survey, exca- vation, documentation, and conservation of a sampling of friezes from the palaces (fig. 6). At Chan Chan, relief ornamentation is very closely associated with the palaces, piLLSBURY 75</page><page sequence="5">3. Simplified plan of Chan Chan Drawing by Karen Rasmussen, after Michael E.

For example, architectural reliefs are known from several huacas at the edge of the city.18 It appears likely that at least some of these structures were burial platforms, similar to those in the palaces proper.19 There is some evidence for a modest amount of relief sculp- ture outside the palaces, in what are pre- sumed to be accommodations of the lesser nobility (referred to in the archaeological literature as "elite compounds").20 Although these structures have been less intensively studied than the palaces, from the available evidence it appears that the relief sculpture is very simple (consisting of bands or block designs) and used sparingly. Turning to the architectural sculpture of the palaces, it appears that the Chan Chan reliefs diverge from earlier traditions of archi- tectural sculpture in two significant ways: they appear exclusively in the interiors, and they were rarely painted.21 Earlier Moche friezes, by contrast, were brightly poly- chromatic and were sculpted on both the facades and the interiors of buildings. From the evidence of our survey at Chan Chan, the reliefs appear only on the interiors of the palaces,- the exteriors were left unadorned. These reliefs are remarkably consistent in their form, and the range of imagery is extremely limited, particularly given the space available and the five-hundred-year history of the city. The compositions are based on repetitions of small geometric and zoomorphic motifs covering large expanses of wall (figs. 7 and 8). The zoomorphic forms are resolutely maritime in theme, with sea birds and a wide variety of fishes, crus- taceans, and mollusks represented. Anthro- pomorphic forms are also seen, but they are worlds away from anything suggesting royal portraiture. When humans (or supernatural figures with human traits) do appear, they are generally small and form only one element in a constantly repeating theme. The subject matter of the Chan Chan reliefs also represents a distinct departure from earlier Moche traditions. Moche art is more narrative in character and exhibits more interest in the human form. Large- scale representations of aggressive super- natural beings are a favorite subject, as are parades of prisoners. On the facade of a temple structure at Huaca Cao Viejo (fig. 9), war captives are shown stripped of their clothing and paraded behind their keeper, who leads them by a rope attached to their necks. The figures are painted in bright colors, visible to the populace from afar. At Chan Chan, by contrast, there are very few compositions even approaching narra- tive. In the few instances where the imagery is suggestive of narrative, this quality is counteracted by a repetition of the imagery dozens of times across a space. For example, figure 10 is a detail of a relief we excavated some years ago in the Uhle Palace. The frieze, which probably dates to c. 1200, was found in a courtyard leading to a U-shaped structure and storage facilities. One of the most complex compositions at the site, it was named Los buceadores (The divers) for the shell divers depicted. The imagery shows a pair of figures, back-to-back with knees drawn up inside a five-sided structure, with two figures facing each other beneath them with what look like tails but which are actu- ally representations of ropes attached to their waists. Interspersed along the wavy ropes are triangular, pronged motifs repre- senting the marine bivalve Spondylus. The figures are in pursuit of this highly valued shell, generally found in tropical waters at depths of more than fifteen meters.22 The five-sided structure is either a structure fixed 5 .

View of excavations, Laberinto Palace Author photograph to a raft on the surface of the water or some sort of diving bell. As suggestive as this imagery may be of narrative, this quality is undermined by the fact that this scene and its variations were repeated perhaps dozens of times across the courtyard, making the imagery more trope than narrative.23 Another example of this repetition is found in a courtyard of a palace of the late four- teenth or early fifteenth century known as Velarde (fig. n). The relief was named the Tuie Boat Frieze in the 1970s for the depic- tion of traditional reed watercraft in several places in the composition. In addition to the reed boats (usually with two paddlers aboard), a rich variety of fishes is shown, along with square and rectangular forms indicating nets (fig. 12). This work stands apart from other compositions at Chan Chan. There is a wider diversity of forms, and they are rendered in the loosest, most informal composition at the site. Yet even here, the same cluster of motifs is repeated up to six times on each wall. The repetition was dif- ficult to distinguish at first, as the clusters were created by different hands and are in varying states of preservation, but when the entire court was opened and analyzed, the patterning became clear. The majority of the compositions at Chan Chan are defined by their adherence to repet- itive arrangements of small geometric and zoomorphic forms contained within bor- ders. There is a rigidity to the Chan Chan friezes that belies the material of which they are made. Particularly in comparison with the liveliness of the earlier Moche murals and 7.

Facade of Huaca Cao Viejo, El Brujo Complex, seventh/eighth century Author photograph reliefs, Chan Chan appears like a repetition on a grand scale of imagery that was once part of the decorative border vocabulary of Moche art. To the degree to which scale, position, and uniqueness convey conceptual signifi- cance, the Chimú friezes largely illustrate a collective idea rather than individual fig- ures.24 Single figures are rarely given promi- nence, either through absolute scale or central placement in a composition. There is hierarchy in some compositions, such as the Burr Frieze, where the anthropomorphic figure with the wave or crescent headdress 80 PILLSBURY</page><page sequence="10">io. Detail of relief, Uhle Palace, twelfth/ thirteenth century Author photograph PILLSBURY 8l</page><page sequence="11">is larger, and frontal, as opposed to the flank- ing profile figures (figs. 13-15).25 Even this hierarchy, however, is subverted by the insis- tent repetition of the figure. The one-meter section of the Burr Frieze shown in figure 14 is but a small surviving portion of what once was a composition completely covering all sides of the platform, which measures 23.6 by 28.9 meters (see fig. 13).26 Uniqueness, which serves to identify and elevate certain imagery, is extremely rare at Chan Chan. The impact of the friezes lies not in the presen- tation of narrative or unique imagery, but in the entirety of the work - the great expanse of relief sculpture in the interior space. The compositions of the architectural reliefs at Chan Chan follow a structure of infinity patterns within borders: that is, the motifs are repeated over and over, this expanse halted only by the decorative bands along the sides, tops and bottoms of the walls. Such compositions create a distancing effect. The reliefs do not inspire close inspec- tion, and indeed the infinity patterns with borders impart an ornamental quality to the works.27 What was once a decorative border of Moche imagery became the backdrop for Chimú performances in the space it sur- rounds. The Chimú lords themselves pro- vided the narrative in the processions and rituals of the palace. How do we interpret this imagery? In terms of iconography, the historical texts are not very helpful. For example, Garcilaso de la Vega, El Inca, writing in 1609, said the Chimú worshipped fish; Antonio de la Calancha, writing in 1638, was emphatic that they did not.28 Even if the writers had agreed about the Chimú and fish, it is not clear how this information would enhance our ability to interpret these specific, isolated motifs. One might even argue that drawing mean- ing out of specific motifs was not the inten- tion of the designers. Indeed, some years ago, Elizabeth Boone was central in drawing my attention to the overall effect of the reliefs. That exchange, including her brief but insightful characterization of the architec- tural sculpture at Chan Chan as "wallpaper," was, for me, a short but important dialogue. The very wallpaper-like aspect of the Chan Chan reliefs - the complete coverage, indeed saturation, of the vast expanses of wall space 82 PILLSBURY</page><page sequence="12">1 1 . View of the Tuie Boat Court, Velarde Palace, fourteenth/fifteenth century Photograph Fernando Castro 12. Detail of the Tule Boat Frieze, fourteenth/ fifteenth century Photograph Fernando Castro in repetitive patterns - conveys meaning in itself. The specific motifs are less impor- tant than the overall effect. The scale of the Chan Chan palaces is critical to understanding the affective aspect of the reliefs.29 The palaces are vast. Even in their ruined state, the conception is still massive in scope and instills a sense of awe, wonder, and mystery. Particularly if one bears in mind the exclusivity of the space - as evidenced from the extreme control of access - one can well imagine the impact on an observer finally allowed to enter the grand first courtyard of the palace from the arid, inert landscape of the desert. From the massive interior wells to the architectural reliefs brimming with life through imagery of a mackerel-crowded sea, the sight must have offered a potent visual experience. But is it possible to understand how this imagery might have been appreciated with- out knowing the specific associations of the motifs? I suggest that an interpretation of individual forms is of little importance, and probably was so even in antiquity. Thus the "meaning" of individual motifs may well be an interpretative red herring. Rather, with the Chan Chan reliefs, the medium is the message, or more precisely, the imagery is about medium. The key imagery invoked is not the individual motifs but the entire com- position, and that composition is evocative of a different medium altogether: the exquis- ite woven textiles of the Andes. The reliefs are formed of a malleable earthen plaster, yet their forms are planar and angular. The sharply cut forms echo not the earlier large- scale modeled representations of divine beings and prisoners, but the rigidity of woven textiles. The Hall of Arabesques (fig. 16), an entry- way to a burial platform in the Gran Chimú Palace, exemplifies many of the composi- tional aspects of the Chan Chan friezes.30 Gran Chimú, the largest palace at Chan Chan, dates from the middle period of the city's history (c. 1300). Its massive burial platform was thoroughly looted, yet exten- sive sections of wall ornament have sur- vived. The major motif is a pelican, doubled and repeated upside down and above, joining the right-side-up form at the tail (figs. 17 and 18). A creature with a head and two appendages is found in its belly. This com- posite image is linked with others by a ver- tical band. The completed form is repeated but reversed, thus knitting together the imagery and creating an overall pattern of bifold rotational symmetry (see fig. 17). This pattern of relief extends from the floor to an upper border composed of repetitions of a zoomorphic form with a crescent head- dress. The composition is repeated across the entire expanse of at least four walls of this entryway. Turning from this type of patterning in wall decoration to look at textiles, we dis- cover that the Chan Chan reliefs and textiles share similar iconography and compositions, with an emphasis on infinity patterns and borders (fig. 19). There is also a high degree of correspondence between the symmetries used in both media. To a certain degree this is expected: cultures certainly have prefer- ences.31 Only in textiles and the architectural reliefs does Chimú art exhibit such symme- tries as translation, glide reflection, and bifold rotation.32 Such compositions are not found in other media, such as pottery or silver.33 This correspondence between textiles and architecture, although not new or unique to Chan Chan, is seen here at unprecedented levels. But why this homage to textiles on the adobe walls of Chan Chan? In the nine- teenth century, Gottfried Semper argued that most of the decorative symbols used in Western architecture were derived from the textile arts.34 Semper saw the textile "dress- ing" of the architecture as an evolutionary 13.

In Peru, however, there is no evidence for such a change over time. Rather, I suggest that the textile pattern- ing in adobe reliefs is explicit and inten- tional, and that it is related both to a tradition of hanging elaborate textiles in architectural interiors and to the inherent value and func- tion of textiles in Andean cultures. Textiles can be seen as the first art form in the Andes. They were highly developed on the coast of Peru from the second millennium B.C.E., well before the introduction of pottery. The best evidence for these early textiles comes from Huaca Prieta, a site not far from Chan Chan.35 Textiles continued to be valued over the centuries, and by the Inca period they were counted among the most precious items of the empire. Fine tapestries were used for imperial gifts and ritual sacrifice. The Inca royal crown itself was not of gold or silver, but of red textile fibers.36 Furthermore, the sixteenth-century chron- icles contain several references to the use of luxurious textiles on the interiors of palaces and temples.37 Adobe relief is a relatively inexpensive and quick way to transform the appearance of structures. The lords of Chimor were expanding their empire and their city at a fast pace, and they required a rapid and cost-efficient means of embel- lishing their constructions. The sculpted friezes may have been an efficient way to achieve the effect of luxurious woven textiles on the walls. In some ways this is an art of illusion, a way in which things could be made to look different from what they are. From a distance, the reliefs have an appear- ance of elegant regularity that in many ways belies the haste in which many of them were created. These "adobe tapestries" were, however, probably about more than just ornament. The textile medium itself may have been seen as sacred or precious. From the pre- Hispanic period until the present day in the Andes, sacrifices and precious things have been wrapped in finely woven textiles.38 This emphasis on textile imagery may have served a votive or even protective purpose, conveying certain properties to the archi- tecture. In this light, the walls of the palaces are metaphorically tightly wrapped in a pre- cious and sacred material. 14.

In several cases we were able to doc- ument multiple layers of "dressing": layers of adobe reliefs were sculpted over each other (see fig. 8). Such layers may have under- scored the relative importance of an indi- vidual, whether the layers were created immediately following death or, as is more likely, they were created over time, each layer constituting a record of a veneration.39 While the specific meanings of the reliefs may ultimately elude us, the study of art in ancient cultures without texts is not a PILLSBURY 85</page><page sequence="15">1 8.

Indeed, the absence of texts can lead to a greater concentration on other types of data that we might overlook in text- rich contexts. In the architectural reliefs of Chan Chan, the focus on the formal, in its broadest sense, has led us to some potentially significant insights. But it may also reflect specific imperial strategies. The lords of Chi- mor made a conscious decision to avoid the threatening supernatural figures and pris- oner parades and replace them with patterns of familiar, decorative imagery relating to ideas of material abundance. We can deduce from this choice that the contentious ele- ments of a previous regime were dropped, and a new visual program was instituted. This new program was built on new combina- tions of traditional and deeply meaningful forms. As with many cultures, distinction and innovation were introduced, but wrapped in the comforting associations of the past.40 At Chan Chan, continuity was made man- ifest by covering the walls of the interior cer- emonial spaces of grand new palaces with relief sculpture that intentionally invoked one of the most ancient and precious mate- rials for the Chimú - cloth. In making the traditional forms and patterns of textile design central to the visual experience of the courtyards, the Chimú elite were com- mitting themselves to the perpetuation of abiding cultural values in a time of changing political fortunes. 86 PILLSBURY</page><page sequence="16">NOTES I thank Elizabeth Boone, Jesús Briceño, Tom Cum- mins, César Gálvez, Edward Harwood, Pat Hewitt, Steven Hooper, Ana Maria Hoyle, Julie Jones, Heidi King, Carol Mackey, Michael Moseley, Esther Pasz- tory, Jeffrey Quilter, and Santiago Uceda for their kind assistance with this research over the years, and Elizabeth Cropper and Irene Winter for their excel- lent suggestions on an early version of this essay.

I am thinking primarily of the Moche architec- tural reliefs and even Initial Period manifestations on the central coast. One exception to this would be the lesser-known Gallinazo tradition, which bears some interesting resemblances to the later Chimú reliefs. 22.

Although we excavated only several meters of the court, shell-diver motifs were repeated again and again. It became a commonplace on the project that limited testing of only a meter or so would reveal the general extent of the iconography. 24. See, for example, David Summers, "The 'Visual Arts' and the Problem of Art Historical Description," Art Journal 42 (1982): 301-310. 25. The frieze was named after Samuel H. Burr, a member of the Chan Chan-Moche Valley Project, who excavated it in 1969. 26. The frieze, first excavated around 1907, was left uncovered and was almost completely destroyed in the El Niño rains of 1925-26. Fortunately, the exca- vators did not remove the entire outer layer of con- struction protecting the Burr Frieze, and small sections still remain. 27. In this sense, the composition and symmetry of the reliefs at Chan Chan are based on what Carol Bier has called "infinity bounded by finiteness," which is found so often in Roman mosaics and Islamic textiles. See her "Elements of Plane Symme- try in Oriental Carpets," Textile Museum Journal 31 (1992): 53-70. See also Meyer Schapiro, "On Some Problems in the Semiotics of Visual Art: Field and Vehicle Image Signs," Semiotica 1 (1969): 223-242. The frame is a finding and focusing device placed between the observer and the image. The perceptual effect of these devices is one of extreme order and control. 28.

According to George E. Squier, this area was excavated by Colonel La Rosa in the mid-nineteenth century. Squier named it the Hall of Arabesques for the intertwining character of the relief ornamenta- tion.

The layers may also have been created as part of an addition of burials to the structure. The additional burials in themselves can be considered a variation in the veneration of the original individual. 40. See, for example, Oleg Grabar, The Formation of Islamic Art, rev. and enlarged ed.
