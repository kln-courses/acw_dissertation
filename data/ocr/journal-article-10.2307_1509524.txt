Stroumsa Hebrew University of Jerusalem For Shlomo Pines Although the importance of anthropomorphic conceptions in rabbinic thought is widely recognized, their original nature and significance are still in need of clarification.' A major difficulty in this task stems from the scarcity and the obscurity of some of the most important texts, which, moreover, cannot be dated with any precision. The purpose of this article is to call attention to some early Chris- tian and Gnostic texts which bear upon Jewish conceptions of the Divine Body or of the Hypostasis, or both, and might shed new light on the origin and evolution of these conceptions. I wish to emphasize that in the present state of research, only tentative conclusions can be reached, and that there will be no attempt here to deal with all sides of the problem. A tendency to attribute to God not only human feelings, but also a body of gigantic or cosmic dimensions is not, of course, a specifically Jewish phenomenon in Antiquity. Indeed, such representations, which had been current in Greek thought for a very long time, find their probable origin in pre-Platonic Orphic conceptions. Inside the Greek world, representations of the cosmos as a macranthropos, with a head (the heaven), a belly or a body (the sea or the ether), feet (the earth), and eyes (the sun and the moon) are found, with some variations, in the Greek Magical Papyri, the Oracle of Sarapis in Macrobius, the 'An earlier version of this paper was read at the Eighth World Congress of Jewish Studies (Jerusalem, August 1981).

Prestige, God in Patristic Thought (2d ed.; London: SPCK, 1950) chap. 1. The most notorious exceptions to the prevalent belief in God's incorporeality are, on the one hand, Tertullian's view, based on the Stoic conception that there can be no incorporeal being (see, e.g., Adv. Prax. 7) and, on the other, the Audians and the Anthropomorphist monks of the Egyptian desert, who insisted on a literal reading of Gen 1:26. See H.-C. Puech, "Audianer," RAC 1, 910-15, and A.

STROUMSA development or the increased importance, inside Judaism, of macro- cosmic representations of the Divinity. It must first be noted that Jewish anthropomorphism seems to have been notorious in the first centuries C.E.: Patristic literature retains traces of Christian rejection of such conceptions. In this regard, the best-known testimony is probably that of Justin Martyr, who refers, in his Dialogue with Trypho, to the belief of the Jewish teachers who imag- ine "that the Father of all, the unengendered God, has hands, feet, fingers and a soul, just as a composite being."8 A rejoinder to this text is provided by Origen, who notes, in his Homilies on Genesis, that the Jews-as well as some Christians- conceive God in human terms, when they imagine him to possess members and faculties just like a man. Origen adds that they claim to establish this fancy on biblical verses, such as Isa 66:1: "The Heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool."9 According to such a con- ception, God's body would be of cosmic dimensions: seated in heaven, he would touch the earth with his feet. The value of this testimony has been unduly belittled in recent research.10 Origen's knowledge of Juda- ism was based not only upon Jewish Alexandrian traditions transmitted through Christian writings, but also on third-century Palestinian rab- binic thought. There is little doubt that Origen's remark reflects a rab- binic conception known to him. That this Jewish macrocosmic anthropomorphism was well known to, and attacked by, Christian theologians is emphasized by the testimony-hitherto ignored-of two fourth-century Patristic writers, who are usually far away from Jewish matters. The value of these two texts is strengthened by the very fact that they seem to reflect stock arguments of the adversus Judaeos literature: it shows how widespread these arguments, and the termini used, were. In the first of his Homilies on the Origin of Man, Basil the Great inquires about the real meaning of "the image and the similitude of God" (Gen 1:26), and rejects the "vulgar perception" and the "stupid conceptions" of God, according to which he would have the same form as us: a body. Empty from your heart all misplaced imagination, throw away from yourself a conception which is unfitting of God's greatness. God has no form 8Dial. 114; Justin refers to anthropomorphic interpretations of Ps 8:4. 91n Gen. hor. 1.13 (GCS 6. 15-17) and ibid. 3.1 (6. 39). 10See, e.g., N.

Do not imagine a form (gopriu) for Him, do not belittle Him, who is great, in Jewish fashion (lovadiKs); do not enclose God in corporeal concepts, do not delimit,Him according t6 the meas- ure of your mind. Since God is in no way comparable to us, it is not our body which represents his image: the corruptible, concludes Basilius in true Pla- tonic fashion, is not the image (?dKWv) of the incorruptible.11 Arnobius of Sicca also accuses the Jews of anthropomorphism. In order to refute a pagan argument against Christian conceptions, he writes: And let no one, here, oppose to us the Jewish fables and those of the sect of the Sadduccees, as if we too give forms (formas) to God-for this is said to be taught in their books, and to be affirmed therein as certain, in a peremptory way.12 I have dealt elsewhere with Arnobius' mention of Sadduccean anthropomorphism.13 In the present context, what is significant, in both his and Basil's testimony, is the use of the word form, or forms, of God as a terminus technicus.14 This expression recalls the Hellenistic notion of uaop4b OEov, which is well known and has been studied at length.15 "lBasil of Caesarea Horn. de hominis struc. 1.5 (SC 160. 176-78). 12Adv. nationes 3.12 (CSEL 4. 119-20). 13See "Le couple de l'Ange et de l'Esprit: traditions juives et chr6tiennes," RB 88 (1981) 42-61. 14It should be noted that the same ambiguous use of the "form" or "forms" of God is also found in Medieval Jewish texts. For instance, in the Sefer ha-Bahir (the very first writing of Medieval Kabbalah, which first appears in late twelfth-century Provence, but no doubt retains many earlier traditions), the "Holy Forms" (ha-surot ha qedoshot) refer sometimes to the angels, and sometimes to the manifestations of God himself in the members of Primordial Man. See G. Scholem, Les Origines de la Kabbale (Paris: Aubier, 1966) 64 n. 10. One of the central symbols developed in the Sefer ha-Bahir and in later kabbalistic literature, the Cosmic Tree, can also be found in Gnostic teachings, as A. J. Welburn has pointed out: "The Identity of the Archons in the 'Apocryphon Johannis,'" VC 32 (1978) 245-46. Related, no doubt, to the same ancient speculations is Sa'adia Gaon's notion of "Created Glory," superior to the angels, supreme revelation of God and the figure seen by the prophets in their visions. This "Created Glory" (ha-kavod ha nivra) is said to have "a human form." See A. Altmann's discussion, "Saadya's Theory of Revelation: its Origin and Background," in Studies in Religious Philosophy (Ithaca, NY: Cornell University, 1969) 140-60, esp. 157. Similarly, R. Judah ben Barzilai (eleventh century) states that when R. Ismael had seen one of the forms of the primordial light, he had in fact seen the angel Akhatriel; see Sh. Halberstam, ed., R. Judah b. Barzilai, Perush Sefer Yesirah (Jerusalem: Maqor Reprints, 1971) 20-21. On Akhatriel, cf.

STROUMSA 273 My intent here is to focus on one of its aspects which may give a clue to the origin and nature of this Jewish anthropomorphism. In order to do so, I shall first review some Hermetic and Gnostic texts that seem to contain traces of early Jewish conceptions. The Poimandres, the first text of the Corpus Hermeticum, "that grab-bag of Graeco-Roman spirituality,"'6 stands at the confluence of various traditions. On the one hand, it represents the mythical expres- sion of pessimistic conceptions close to Gnosticism and originally related to popular Platonism. On the other, its Jewish affinities have long been noted. Its cosmogony, in particular, shows close contacts with the Genesis account, and points to Jewish Hellenistic connec- tions.17 Moreover, the Poimandres has recently been shown to display some remarkable parallels with the Slavonic Enoch,'8 a work in which Scholem has found the exact translation of the notion of shi'ur qoma, the expression used in Hebrew texts of the rabbinic period to refer to God's body.19 Now in the anthropogonic myth of the Poimandres, one reads that: The Nois, Father of all beings, being himself life and light, gave birth to an Anthropos similar to Himself, whom He loved as his own child. For the Anthropos was very handsome, since he possessed the image of his Father (riv roV rarTpO; EtK6va ExoOv)' indeed, it is his own form (rniS 18a1 a op46j;) that God loved.20 thus "almost reach an independent existence of [their] own" (Die hellenistischen Mys- terienreligionen [2d ed.; Leipzig: Teubner, 1926] 357-58). 16W.

See his Elements of the Kabbalah and its Symbolism (Jerusalem: Mossad Bialik, 1977) 165 (in Hebrew). The expression itself, denoting a tall structure, is also found in Ps. 151a from Qumran, as S. Talmon has convincingly argued. See J. A. Sanders, The Psalms Scroll of Qumr&amp;n Cave 11 (11 QPsa) (DJD 4; Oxford: Clarendon, 1965) 55, 11. 8-10, and S.

Schenke distinguishes between two types of Gnostic concep- tions of the God-Man; in the first one, mainly represented by the Apocryphon of John, the earthly Adam is the direct image of the God-"Man"; the other type, to which the Poi-</page><page sequence="6">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW This Anthropos, then, piercing the envelope of the heavenly spheres, is reflected below in the water, and thus reveals himself to Physis: "he shows to the Physis from below the beautiful form of God" (rr)v KaX7,v TOV feov mjLopf 'v).21 This grop'i O8eov, with which Nature immediately falls in love, is then explicitly identified with "the beautiful form of the Anthropos" (rj1 Ka , OAArrY lTop4rs roV 'AvOpOTrov).22 In other words, the Poimandres' myth makes it clear that there is a basic difference, an essential duality, between two divine entities: Nous, the supreme God, who remains invisible and formless, and his hypostatic Form, who is his Son, the Primordial Man. According to the language of the Poimandres, moreover, EiKWv seems to be equivalent to uwop4/r: the form of God is also his image. We shall find elsewhere this identification between the two words in Hellenistic usage.23 In any case, the same ontological differentiation between God and his hypostatic image, or form, also occurs, with some variations, in other Hermetic treatises. These contexts emphasize the theological problem which this conception seeks to solve. In one of the texts, for instance, the world, which is God, is called the "pleroma of life," "the image of the All," and of the Greatest God.24 More precisely, a fragment of the Pseudo-Anthimus points out the difference between the Supreme God and his image: "The Son of God, although he possesses all qualities similar to his Father, is nevertheless defective on two points, in that he has a body and in that he is visible."25 The basic problem behind these various formulations is best expressed in the subtitle of Corp. Herm. 5: "that God is both non- apparent and most apparent." Although God is invisible, according to Platonic theology, a way to see him must nevertheless be found-and this way is the very essence of Hermetic initiation. Indeed, the possibility of the supreme God to reveal himself, which leads to this duality of the invisible God and his form or image, seems to have been a major preoccupation in various Gnostic trends, and the same basic structure also appears in Gnostic mythology. Such a hierarchical duality is of course very different from what is usually con- sidered to be the typical Gnostic dualism, which implies not only a mandres belongs, adds an intermediary figure, and implies a Jewish allegorical exegesis of Gen 1:26 as its basis. 21Corp.

This opposition is supposed to answer another major problem of Gnos- tic thought: its intense desire to solve the problem of evil, that is, to discover its source. It is reasonable to assume, however, that a genetic study of Gnostic dualism should point out some relationship between these two different kinds of break in the Godhead. As in the Poimandres, so also in some of the other texts the image of God is said to appear in the water. Thus, in the Apocryphon of John, the Son of Man reveals upon the water the appearance in human (a&amp;Speov) form (rTv7ro) "of Anthropos, the invisible Father of the All."26 In the Hypostasis of the Archons, the image of Incorruptibility revealed upon the water is explicitly called the image of God.27 In the Origin of the World, it is Pistis who reveals the likeness of her greatness (m'ntno) upon the water.28 The same duality appears in Eugnostos, where God, who has no human form, is revealed in his form, a great power, or a light, who is an immortal and androgynous man.29 This perfect and true man is called Adamas in Irenaeus' account of Barbeloite doctrines.30 In another Nag Hammadi text, Zostrianos, the revelation of the hidden God plays a central role. Ephesech, "the child of the child," is the messenger who reveals his invisible Father. For he is called both the Son of God and the Perfect Man.31 26CG II, 14:20-24; text in M. Krause and P.

It is worth noticing that, under a veneer of Christian language, basically the same non-Christian structure is also carried by the Valentinian traditions. In those texts, too, the image of the invisi- ble God is his Son. The Tripartite Tractate speaks about "the Son of the unknown God," about whom one did not speak previously, and who could not be seen."32 This image, adds the same text, is corporeal: "The Savior was a corporeal image of the Holy One. He is the Totality in corporeal form."33 Similarly, in the Extracts of Theodotos, the Son is called uop4q rwv alvivwv, and Christ, EiKWv V TOV' 7rXp'rp roq:34 the corporeal image of God is, here again, his form. The most clearly anthropomorphic, or rather, macrocosmic concep- tions of the deity in late antique Judaism are expressed in the book Shi'ur Qomah ("Measurement of the [divine] stature"), which is extant only in fragmentary form.35 This work, which has been called "the most obnoxious text of Jewish mysticism,"36 claims, on the basis of an exegesis of Song of Songs 5:11-16, to give the measurements of the limbs of the divine figure, who is identified with the Beloved.37 Such extreme representations were to have a tremendous echo in Jewish thought: the medieval polemics between Rabbinites and Qaraites, as its Aramaic equivalent, adam qadmaia.

STROUMSA well as Maimonides' preoccupation with the subject testify to their per- sistence.38 The almost complete lack of internal criteria for the dating of this text has strongly impeded the proper understanding of its abstruse con- ceptions. In opposition to those scholars for whom the Shi'ur Qomah book stemmed from the Gaonic period, the late Gershom Scholem, who devoted much attention to this text over an extended period of time, reached the conclusion that it was probably redacted in "either the Tannaitic or the early Amoraic period."39 More precisely, J. Dan tends to accept the alleged authorship of the document (Rabbi Aqiva and Rabbi Ishmael) as an indication of the milieux in which the mystical exegesis of Song of Songs was first developed.40 This assessment stands to reason. No claims will be made here, however, about the dating of the Shi'ur Qomah book itself. Our present interest is not in the textual problem, but in the origins of the mythologoumenon. In that respect, it would seem that some of those elements integrated and developed by Palestinian Rabbis of the early second century were already present in first-century Judaism, at least in nuce. In other words, there is strong reason to presume that the origi- nal Jewish speculation on the macrocosmic divine body is pre-Christian. One should point out that even the most basic question, the iden- tity of the divine figure whose dimensions are given in the Shi'ur Qomah, seems to remain unanswered. In this regard, some remarks of Scholem deserve more attention than they have received until now. He writes: We may ask whether there did not exist ... a belief in a fundamental distinc- tion between the appearance of God the Creator, the Demiurge, i.e. one of His aspects, and His indefinable essence? There is no denying the fact that it is precisely the "primordial man" on the throne of the Merkabah whom the Shiur Komah calls Yotser Bereshith.41 and adds, a little further: The Shiur Komah referred not to the "dimensions" of the divinity but to those 38Cf. Altmann's article cited above (n. 36).

This is clearly the interpretation of the original texts.42 Scholem's conclusion was founded upon the analysis of the Hebrew traditions, and in particular upon the description of Yahoel, the angel with the twice-theophoric name who appears first in the Apo- calypse of Abraham (chap. 10), then to become Metatron in Merkavah and Talmudic literature.43 There is no doubt that Yahoel-Metatron, whose name is said to be identical to his Master's name,44 is conceived as God's archangelic hypostasis. It comes as no surprise, therefore, when the Shi'ur Qomah attributes cosmic dimensions to Metatron's body.45 The scarcity of Hebrew sources, however, and their relatively late dating require an appeal to outside testimonies and parallel tradi- tions in order to unveil more precisely the original place and function of such conceptions and their evolution. An unambiguous testimony exists about the probable existence of a strikingly similar conception of a divine archangelic hypostasis in first-century Judaism. We know from the reports about the sect of the Maghariya and their doctrines (one of Qirqisani in the name of el Muqammis and another by Shahrastani) that in opposition to Sadduc- cean anthropomorphism, Maghariya theology, "four hundred years before Arius," referred all anthropomorphic biblical verses to an angel, whom it considered to be the creator of the world.46 This angel, more- over, was said to bear God's name, while his appearance among men was presented as God's own appearance.47 A text from the fringes of early Christianity provides us with another parallel to the Shi'ur Qomah material. The Jewish-Christian book of Elchasai, which can be dated to the end of the first century,48 42Ibid., 66. 43Cf. ibid., 68-69, and Jewish Gnosticism, 41-42. 4Metatron, se-semo ke-sem rabbo, b.

STROUMSA gave the huge dimensions of a couple of angels, male and female, the Son of God and the Holy Spirit. This Elchasaite representation, which reflects Jewish esoteric traditions, turns that angelic hypostasis of God, which is elsewhere described as single and androgynous, into two.49 Yet this duplication does not change the basic structure of the original con- ception, which attributed a human form and gigantic dimensions to an angelic being, while God himself remained unseen and formless. The various traditions about God's hypostatic form seem to con- verge upon the Judaism of the first Christian century. The cumulative evidence leads to the tentative conclusion that there existed then a cluster of mythologoumena about the archangelic hypostasis of God, also identified with the First Adam (and therefore the true image of God), whose body possessed cosmic dimensions. This figure, more- over, who bore God's name, had created the world at his command. Perhaps traces of these mythologoumena may also be discerned beneath some traits of Philo's theology, in particular his complex con- ception of the Logos as God's intermediary in the creation of man.50 Although the Philonic Logos is the invisible, intelligible, and incorpo- real image of God, some of the metaphorical descriptions of him might point to origins in mythological traditions: he is called God's name, his image, the Beginning, and also "Man after the Image." Ruler of the Angels, he is also identified with Wisdom and Israel; like Israel, he is called "he who sees God," and, like Wisdom, "vision of God."51 Finally, it should be noted that the idea of a divine intermediary, playing an active role in creation, is even present in rabbinic literature. As S. Liebermann has pointed out, the notion that heaven and earth were created by "the likeness on high"-the same notion developed at length in Gnostic sources-is also found in an important rabbinic text.52 M. Smith, "Observations on Hekhalot Rabbati," in A. Altmann, ed., Biblical and Other Studies (Philip W.

This parallel has been noted long ago by Moses Gaster, who called attention, in particular, to the Marcosian conception of "the Body of Truth,"53 According to Markos, "the first Father, unbegotten, unthinkable, and unsubstantial (avovco-Lo), neither male nor female, wanted to bring forth what is ineffable to Him and give form to the invisible (Ka t TO aoparov u.op4oFjirvaL); He opened His mouth, and sent forth a Word (logos) similar to Himself, who, stand- ing, showed Him who He was, revealing Himself as the form of the invisible (avtrb Tro aop&amp;rov ,iopbr] OaavE?i)."54 It is this Logos that will then become the Body of Truth (o-crla rTrj aAi7hqEa,), a divine figure also called Anthropos whose twelve members are composed of the twenty-four letters of the alphabet, grouped in symmetrical couples of opposite letters.55 The text leaves no doubt that the body composed of these letters, or elements (o-roLXELa), is macrocosmic since each letter is spelled by other letters, in an unlim- ited process.56 Now the letters which build the body of Truth are also called its forms, more precisely those "which the Lord has called angels, and which continually behold the face of the Father."57 For Markos, then, God does not have in the Body of Truth only one form, but many. In other contexts, too, form is closely connected to angel: in the Extracts of Theodotos, it is said that "spiritual and intelligible beings, as well as archangels, have each one his own form and his own body."58 Similarly, the Nag Hammadi tractate On the Origin of the World mentions the seventy-two forms (opor') of the divine Chariot (the Merkavah of Ezechiel and of early Jewish Mysticism), the "Cherub," and the seven archangels.59 8vv4a?uAs, Irenaeus Adv. haer. 1.18.1 (1. 170 Harvey). 53M.

STROUMSA Its polymorphy is a major aspect of the Metatron figure in the Shi'ur Qomah fragments and in Merkavah texts. I have analyzed else- where this two-fold polymorphy, pointing out its striking similarity to the polymorphy of Christ in both Gnostic and early Christian texts.60 Like Christ, Me Da Dron appears both as a child and an old man (na'ar-zaqen = puer-senex) and both as in the form of God and in the form of a servant (compare Phil 2:6-11). I cannot rehearse my argu- ment here, but would like to call attention to a puzzling detail, hitherto unnoticed, which proves to my mind a genetic relationship between the two traditions. In the longest preserved passage of the Shi'ur Qomah, Metatron is said to possess two names, the first in twenty-four letters, the other in only six (mttrwn).61 Markos Gnostikos, similarly, conceived Christ as bearing two names: one exoteric, in twenty-four letters, and the other esoteric, in six letters (L7-1ov) !62 It is more reasonable to assume that the Gnostic conception here retains traces of a Jewish tradition, rather than to postulate an influence from Valentinian circles upon the Hebrew milieu in which the Shi'ur Qomah conceptions were first developed. There is no reason, however, to assume a direct link between Mar- kos and esoteric (?) Jewish circles. Further references to the cosmic divine hypostasis might help us in tracing the proximate channels through which such Jewish conceptions could have reached Markos. In particular, would it be possible to go back from the second to the first century, and find in the New Testament itself traces of this very con- ception? Scholem once made a random suggestion that the notion of the guf ha-kavod, or guf ha-shekhina, which appears in the Shi'ur Qomah, might be related to the Pauline or deutero-Pauline notion of Christ's "body of glory" (c-&amp;rua r4j" 860'v [Phil 3:21]).63 Oddly enough, however, the possibility has not been investigated that Paul (and the writers of the deutero-Pauline letters) knew of such conceptions of the cosmic body of the divine hypostasis, which he would have radically transformed and spiritualized when he developed his new and very personal concep- tion of the mystical "Body of Christ" (cr4xga XpLo-roV) as 60"Polymorphie divine et transformation d'un mytholog6me," cited above n. 45. 61Merkavah Shelemah, 39b. 62Irenaeus Adv. haer. 1.15.1 (1. 145-46 Harvey).

Yet arguments have been adduced either for a postulated pre-Christian Gnostic Urmensch (Paul's conception being then a reaction against this Urmensch)65 or for the possible Jewish origin of Paul's "categories of thought."66 It would seem that New Testament scholars have not hitherto seriously con- sidered the possibility of a Jewish pre-Christian macranthropos.67 Since, however, Paul's conception of the acrc'La Xptcrrov is so radi- cally new and spiritualized, any argument in favor of such a link must remain speculative. Rather, I would like to suggest other possible traces of the Jewish mythologoumenon in the New Testament, particu- larly to the two christological hymns incorporated into the Pauline corpus: Phil 2:6-11 and Col 1:15-20. Both hymns stem from the very first stratum of Palestinian Christianity and retain in all probability Jewish teachings. This Jewish background is by far more obvious than a problematic appeal to Gnostic myth. About Phil 2:6-11, which con- tains the oldest christology of the New Testament, Dieter Georgi has argued that the "form of the servant" is a reference to Isaiah's suffering servant. Georgi concludes that such traditions point to hel- lenistic Judaism, and more particularly to what he calls "speculative wisdom mysticism."68 64The theme also plays a major role in other writings of the Pauline and deutero- Pauline corpus, particularly in Eph 4:12-16. For a bibliography of research between 1930 and 1960, see C. Colpe, "Zur Leib-Christi-Vorstellung im Epheserbrief," in Juden- tum, Urchristentum und Kirche, Festschrifi ifr J. Jeremias (BZNW 26; Berlin: Topelmann, 1964) 172-87. 65See, e.g., H. Schlier, Christus und die Kirche im Epheserbrief (Tubingen: Mohr, 1930); or, more recently, P. Pok6rny's studies, such as Der Epheserbrief und die Gnosis: die Bedeutung des Haupt-Glieder-Gedankens in der entstehenden Kirche (Berlin: Evangelische Verlagenstalt, 1965). The obvious problem with such an approach is the purely hypothet- ical character of this pre-Christian Gnosticism; it often implies understanding Pauline concepts through the prism of second-century technical Valentinian meanings, as Father Benoit points out. See P. Benoit, O.P., "L'hymne christologique de Col. 1:15-20: Juge- ment critique sur l'6tat des recherches," in J. Neusner, ed., Christianity, Judaism and Other Greco-Roman Cults: Studies for M. Smith (SJLA 12; Leiden: Brill, 1975) 1. 226-63. 66See, e.g., P. Benoit, "Corps, tate et plerome dans les Epitres de la Captivite," RB 63 (1956) 5-44, esp. 17-18. 67This seems to be true even of those scholars who recognized traces of a "Jewish," or "Jewish-Christian," Gnosis in the Pauline corpus; see, e.g., H.-M. Schenke, "Der Widerstreit gnostischer und kirchlicher Christologie im Spiegel des Kolosserbriefes," ZThK 61 (1964) 391-403, esp. 399. See also E. Lohse, Colossians and Philemon (Her- meneia; Philadelphia: Fortress, 1971) 52 nn. 151-52 (on Col 1:18). Lohse cites parallel conceptions of the cosmic body of the divinity from Pahlavi literature, the Mahabarata, the Timaeus, the Orphic fragments and Magic Papyri, but makes no reference to Jewish texts. 68"Der vorpaulinische Hymnus Phil. 2:6-11," in E. Dinkler, ed., Zeit und Geschichte, 282</page><page sequence="15">GEDALIAHU G. STROUMSA In this hymn, Christ is first described as having been "in the form of God" (iv Iuopt, 0eovG vT7rapXopv [vs 6]). The incarnation is then presented as taking the form of a servant (zop6v 6ovikov XafSiv [vs 7]). In order to achieve this metamorphosis, Christ is said to have emptied himself (eavrwv eKE'VO(EV [vs 7]). Despite numerous studies, this kenosis of Christ has remained rather obscure. Does it refer not to the incarnation, but rather to the cross, as Jeremias holds? Does it mean that Christ divested himself from his divine privileges?69 In my opinion, the notion can be best understood as reflecting an original mythical conception, rather than being simply metaphorical. We may assume that according to this original conception, when Christ was "in the form of God," his cosmic body filled the whole world and was identical to the pleroma. Incarnation, therefore, literally implied that Christ emptied the world (or the pleroma) that is, in a sense, himself. The hymn adds that Christ was given by God "the Name which is above every name" (vs 9), in other words, the divine Name. This for- mula is strikingly similar to the tradition about Yahoel-Metatron, according to which he received his Master's name.70 A related conception might be reflected in that puzzling work of early Christian literature, the Odes of Solomon: For there is a Helper for me, the Lord He has generously shown Himself to me in his simplicity because His kindness has diminished his rabita (Odes Sol. 7:3). I suggest that rabuta should be understood here literally, as "great- ness," "size"-and not "dreadfulness," as the editor J. Charlesworth, translates.71 The verse would thus be understood as reflecting the kenosis of the hymn in Philippians: incarnation implies for Christ giving up the great- ness of his previous gigantic dimensions. This interpretation must remain hypothetical, but one should note that it is strengthened by the Dankesgabe an Rudolf Bultmann (Tubingen: Mohr, 1964) 263-93, esp. 291.

The hymn incorporated in Col 1:15-20, which might have been chanted in the liturgy of the first Christian communities,72 is directly relevant to us. Christ is not said here to be in the form of God, but is called "image of the invisible God" (eLK&amp;V TOVi OEov aopaTov [vs 15]). Now ELiKCv is, as we have already seen, and as most commentators point out, very close to /opfr73 Christ who is the first creature of God (TrpcuroroKo 7Tra&amp;or KTtioE'e [vs 15]), is also the Creator of the world: "since it is in him that all things have been created . . . all has been created through him and for him" (vs 16). Now the immediate evocation of the First Adam and the Yoser Bereshit provided by these traits is much strengthened by the corporeal metaphor: "And He is also the Head of the Body" (vs 18),74 and by the following description of the whole pleroma in Him (vs 19). Such an imagery clearly suggests the macrocosmic conception of Christ as the image, or form, of the invisible God. The hypothesis developed above-that Jewish conceptions about the archangelic divine hypostasis were reinterpreted and attributed to Christ in some trends of earliest Christianity-can be proven, I think, from a passage in the Gnostic Gospel of Philip. This most interesting text reflects, as is known, some Semitic traditions. Moreover, it obvi- ously stems from a milieu with a great interest, or stake, in Jewish iden- tity, Jewish traditions, or both. "A Hebrew makes another Hebrew," so begins the Gos. Phil. It would seem that the text originated in a Jewish-Christian milieu, or among gnosticized Jewish Christians: "When we were Hebrews, we were orphans . . . but when we became Christians, we had both father and mother."75 It is noteworthy that the theme of God's name given to his Son also appears in Gos. Phil.: 72See, e.g., J. Murphy O'Connor, Colossians: a Scripture Discussion Outline (London/Sidney: Sheed and Ward, 1968) 17. 73See, e.g., R. P.

STROUMSA One single name is not uttered in the world, the name which the Father gave to the Son, the name above all things: the name of the Father.76 Similarly to Markos, moreover, Gos. Phil. differentiates between the exoteric and esoteric name of the Savior: "'Jesus' is a hidden name, 'Christ' is a revealed name."77 Among some other interesting Semitic etymologies of the Savior's name we read: "Messiah" has two meanings, both "the Christ" and "the measured." "Jesus" in Hebrew is "the redemption." "Nazara" is "the truth." "Christ" has been measured. "The Nazarene" and "Jesus" are they who have been measured.78 This strange passage has already received some attention. H.-M. Schenke, and after him W. C. van Unnik, have noted the existence of two different isomorphic roots mgh, in both Aramaic and Hebrew, meaning respectively "to oint" and "to measure."79 Pointing out the Semitic original form of the word-play does not in itself bring us closer to a proper understanding of the intention that it obviously carried in its original form (and that Gos. Phil. may no longer understand). So far as I know, such a play on the two isomorphic roots is not found in rabbinic literature. The pun would thus seem to have originated within Hebrew- or Aramaic-speaking early Christian com- munities, that is, among Jewish-Christians. This supposition is strengthened by the other allusions in the text, referred to above, to such a background. It is difficult to make sense of this word-play if we do not suppose that its inventor(s) knew Jewish traditions about the figure of the divine hypostasis which was, in contradistinction to God himself, measurable and which had, in other words, a shi'ur qomah. These Jewish-Christians seem to have applied to Christ conceptions previously attributed to Yahoel. They did so without changing the structure of the relation between God and his hypostasis. In his note on the passage in Gos. Phil., van Unnik refers to an interesting tradition reported by Irenaeus and possibly related by "the 76CG II, 3; 54,5-8; cf. nn. 44 and 70 above. 77CG II, 3; 56,3-4; cf. n. 62 above. 78CG II, 3; 62,11-17. 79See W.

In Greek, the last sentence reads: ,tErpov yap rov orarpoq 6 Yi6o, ETre KaL XwpEt a,6v.81 avrov.1 The last clause is difficult to understand. From parallel uses of Xoppeiv-for instance, in Adv. haer. 1.15.5, where Irenaeus describes the Father as he "who contains all things, and is not contained," it would appear that the clause reflects Irenaeus' gloss on the citation "the Son is the measure of the Father," and that the subject of XWope7 is God. The verb, moreover, should be understood in a topological sense. This use of Xowpei and its equivalents in regard to God, who contains all, in early Christian and Gnostic literature has been remarkably analyzed by W. Schoedel, who has shown its ultimate Platonic origins.82 Elsewhere in his magnum opus, Irenaeus insists that since God is "of infinite greatness," he cannot be measured, and remains unknown with respect to this greatness. It is only through Christ, that is, through his love, that God can be known.83 The mythologoumenon reported in Gos. Phil. is indeed the same as that reinterpreted by Irenaeus: being infinite, and including all things, God cannot in any way be known, or measured. Only his Hypostasis, his Son, can be measured. The Son is, therefore, the Er.Tpov of the Father.84 Here again, the structural paral- lelism between this conception and that of the relationship between Yahoel-Metatron and God in the Jewish sources is striking.

Actually the etymology metator &gt; metatron is already referred to in Genesis Rabba.86 These attempts, however, have lacked persuasive strength, as long as one could not point out that Yahoel-Metatron did not only carry God's name, but also measured Him-was His shi'ur qomah. In the light of the preceding pages, renewed attention should be given to LcrTpov and/or metator (a conflation of the two terms should not be excluded) as a possible etymology of metatron-a name which does not appear before the Talmudic period.87 Such a suggestion obviously implies some links between Christian and Jewish traditions in the first or second century, the nature of which has not yet been deciphered. Scholem argued that the Shi'ur Qomah represented "an attempt to give a new turn" to Gnostic dualism, through its insistence upon the identity of the demiurge and the "true" God.88 The results of the present inquiry strengthen the presumption that the direction of the influence might rather have been the opposite. It was Jewish specula- tions about the cosmic size of the demiurgic angel, the hypostatic form 85There is no way to know whether the Tkrpov of God would have been, in Hebrew, his shi'ur rather than his midda. Both words would seem possible; see, however, Irenaeus Adv. haer. 2.35.3 (1. 386 Harvey): "Eodem modo et Jaoth . . . mensuram praefinitam manifestat." In his note, Harvey postulates jus&amp;pov (for mensuram) in the lost Greek text, and suggests that the term might be a mistranslation of midda, which means, in its abstract sense, attribute of God (although he refers to a certain middat ha-gezera unknown in rabbinic theology). One should also refer to the seventeenth Pseudo-Clementine homily, which teaches that God, despite his invisibility, has a form-the most beautiful form (KaaXiTriv ,Loptiv ieXe) -according to which he has modelled man. See B. Rehm, ed., Die Pseudoklementinen, vol. 1: Homilien (GCS 42) 17. 7.2, 232. Cf. ibid., 10. 6, 11. 4 and 16. 19, where the same conception is expressed. This doctrine, which is no doubt to be attributed to the Jewish-Christian background of the Pseudo-Clementine literature, has already been referred to in relation to the Shi'ur Qomah traditions. See Scholem, Jewish Gnosticism, 41. 86The various attempts to find the origin of the word metatron are listed and discussed by H. Odeberg, 3 Enoch or the Hebrew Book of Enoch reprinted with a Prolegomenon by J. C. Greenfield (New York: Ktav, 1973) 125-34. Odeberg reports that A. Jellinek had suggested ,/xTpov as an etymology "on the assumption that Metatron was identical with Horos" (134). S. Liebermann has recently offered a contribution to the subject in an Appendix to I. Gruenwald, Apocalyptic and Merkavah Mysticism (cited n. 35 above): "Metatron, the Meaning of His Name and His Functions," 235-41. 87When I discussed with him the passage of Irenaeus Adv. haer. 4.4.2, Prof. Pines sug- gested jcerpov as a possible etymology of Metatron. 88Major Trends, 65.</page><page sequence="20">HARVARD THEOLOGICAL REVIEW of God, that both Christians and Gnostics adopted and transformed, each in their own way. While the Christians tended to spiritualize these doctrines by incorporating them into christology, the Gnostics, on the contrary, consciously developed their mythological side, thus opening a gap between God and the demiurge who revolted against his Master.89 The deep ambiguity of the Shi'ur Qomah fragments about the iden- tity of the divine figure whose dimensions are given might well stem from this absorption of the Jewish doctrines on the forms of God by both Christians and Gnostics. To the most serious challenge each posed to Jewish monotheistic theology, the Shi'ur Qomah preferred the dangers of crude anthropomorphism, those same dangers which, para- doxically enough, the earliest doctrine of the hypostatic form of God had tried to overcome. Rabbinic macrocosmic conceptions of God, indeed, testify to the same dialectic confrontation of problems raised by the biblical text as do some of the earliest strata of christology and of Gnostic dualism. 89This parallelism between Christianity and Gnosticism is well emphasized by G. W. MacRae: "The Gnosticism of the Nag Hammadi documents is not a Christian heresy but if anything a Jewish heresy, just as primitive Christianity itself should be regarded as a Jewish heresy or a set of Jewish heresies" ("Nag Hammadi and the New Testament," in B. Aland, ed., Gnosis: Festschrifi fiir Hans Jonas [Gottingen: Vandenhoeck &amp; Ruprecht, 1978] 150). 288</page></plain_text>
