<plain_text><page sequence="1">Preface Long Island's salt marshes play an important ecological role as nursery grounds for finf√¨sh, shellfish and marine plankton, as well as providing a buffer against ocean storms. Approximately half of the marshes that originally existed in the northeastern United States have been lost, and the remaining marshes have been significantly altered by anthropomorphic and natural causes. Some of the more obvious imprints of human influence include the filling of marshlands with trash and concrete, the development of waterfront property, the reconfiguration and dredging of waterways through marshlands for boat channels, the altering of freshwater seepage into marshes, and the disruption of natural flushing processes by restricting tidal flow. Additionally, as the recent disaster in the Gulf Coast states has shown, the threat of a devastating oil spill is just an ocean current away. Other major impacts on our salt marshes have been committed in the name of mosquito control. During the early 1900s, extensive networks of linear ditches were dug out of pristine marshlands to inhibit mosquito reproduction, and in the 1950s salt marshes were saturated with DDT. Not only did the ditching fail to control salt marsh mosquito populations, but the structure and composition of the marshes were negatively impacted. Currently, some local government agencies are beginning to implement a "new" method of mosquito control known as Open Marsh Water Management (OMWM); this method is also being presented as a marsh restoration and management technique. With predictions of accelerated rates of sea-level rise and increased potential for submergence of salt marshes, it is counterintuitive to implement OMWM and other "restoration" efforts that would likely exacerbate marsh drowning. The salt marshes of Long Island are now showing signs of a century of stress; they are collapsing, subsiding, and disappearing as rising sea level consumes them. Before further, irreversible damage is incurred, policy makers need to curb activities that alter salt marsh ecology. The objectives of this publication are to present a basic background about tidal wetlands and to offer benign alternatives to help protect and salvage surviving salt marshes. New York State intervened in the 1970s to prevent the wanton destruction of salt marshes with the pas- sage of tidal wetlands laws (Weinberg, p. 2). But these laws did not anticipate future efforts to alter marsh- lands in an attempt to control nuisance mosquito populations. Long Island salt marshes support a wide diversity of ecological communities (Sneddon &amp; Lamont, p. 14). These marshlands are built on sediments that were deposi tied during the time of the last glacial episode (Hanson, p. 6). The plant communities, in turn, provide marsh nursery grounds and feeding stations for finfish (Kritzer &amp; Hughes, p. 34); shellfish; waterfowl; and marine plankton. The nutritional support for resident and visiting estuarine life is provided by complex food webs (Greller, p. 102). In contrast to past expansion of estuaries and migration landward, salt marshes in New York State are now showing signs of retreat and disappearance (Mushacke, p. 42). Salt marshes must develop a peat cushion to withstand tides, and they require upland acreage for migration as sea level rises. Anthropomorphic alterations have made it increasingly difficult for tidal wetlands to accommodate these ongoing, natural forces (Gedan &amp; Bertness, p. 94). The natural processes of the salt marshes began to break down when humans began dredging channels and installing ditches (Koch &amp; Gobler, p. 60). The ditching for mosquito control began in the early 1900s (Riepe, p. 72), and it continues today with the added impact of pond excavations in the form of OMWM (Potente, p. 122). What choices are available to correct the harmful impacts that have been inflicted on our salt marshes? Undersized and insufficient culverts under roads can be enlarged and enhanced, which will allow better tidal flow to the sequestered marsh areas (Dionne &amp;Vincent, p. 112). Ditches can be eliminated or minimized in a number of nonaggressive ways: the peat mounds beside ditches can be returned into ditches, or ditches can be blocked with modified barriers such as layers of sand bags to promote natural accretion (Penny, p. 154). More simply, they may be allowed to proceed with natural reversion. The passive restoration approach adopt- ed by the National Park Service at Fire Island National Seashore is allowing marsh areas to heal themselves. Today, reducing human impacts on our salt marshes is imperative because so much marshland already has been irreversibly lost. The recent effort in Suffolk County to avert further marsh manipulations was mounted with much vigor and environmental solidarity (Atkinson, p. 162). Only after acquiring a genuine respect for the inherent complexity of the salt marsh can humans begin to withdraw their need to interfere. ix</page></plain_text>
