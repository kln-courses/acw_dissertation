However, unless an author insists on a particular transliteration in all circumstances, place names and words from languages written in non-Roman alphabets which have entered English or French in a particular form (e.g. Mecca/ la Mecque, Mocha, Dhofar, qadi, wadi, imam/iman), are reproduced in that form when they are part of an English or French sentence, rather than part of a quotation in the original language or of a strictly transliterated name or phrase. For example: 1 . "the settlement was built in the wadi bed" BUT "the settlement in Wad! Mayfacah 2. 'Timan alla à Médine" BUT "Imam cAlï vint de al-Madïnat al-Munawwarah" The transliteration systems are as follows: (a) Arabie * £ j * d [dh] и* š [sh] Já z ò q òn ч* b Z b J r &lt;-к» s t c ^ к * h ^ t t h[kh] j z u± d i gfghj J / j w ¿&gt; t [th] * d o* s Ja / ^ f ? m Lß y Vowels: a i u ã T ü. Diphthongs aw ay. Note: From the next issue (PSAS 39) onwards, a modified transliteration system will be in operation. The new transliterations are shown in square brackets in the table above. Authors should note these changes when preparing their manuscripts for submission. Initial hamzah is omitted The lãm of the article is not assimilated before the "sun letters", thus al-shams not ash-shams. The hamzat al-wasl of the article is shown after vowels except after the preposition //-, as in the Arabic script, e.g. wa-4-wazlr, ß H-bayt, but li-l-wazir. To* marbufah (*) is rendered -ah in pause, e.g. birkah, zakãh, and -at before a vowel, e.g. birkat al-sibãhah, zakãt al- fitr. (b) Ancient North and South Arabian °btthghddrzsls2s3sdtzcgfqklmnhwy. (c) Other Semitic languages appear in the transliteration systems outlined in the Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research 226 (1986), p. 3.
