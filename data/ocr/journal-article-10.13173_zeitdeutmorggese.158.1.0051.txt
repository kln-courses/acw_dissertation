<plain_text> <page sequence="1"> The Intention of Expression (vivakṣā), the Expounding  (vyākhyā) of a Text, and the Authorlessness of the Veda 1 By Kiyotaka Yoshimizu, Sendai As the most orthodox group of brahmin scholars, the Mīmāṃsakas, namely,  the scholars occupied with the exegesis (mīmāṃsā) of Vedic scriptures, con- sider the Veda as a revealed corpus without human origin (apauruṣeya). They  reject the possibilities assumed by other schools that the Veda was composed  by a certain author. The Mīmāṃsakas refuse to admit any kind of author for  the Veda because of their skepticism towards the trustworthiness of the state- ments made by human beings. Nevertheless, the Mīmāṃsakas discuss about  what is intended to be expressed (vivakṣyate) in the Vedic injunctions (vidhi)  they quote as example sentences. In this case, one can hardly imagine ascer- taining what is intended to be expressed without assuming an author who  signifies an intention by composing the injunction. In this article, I would  like to elucidate how Kumārila (ca. 600 ad), in a section of his Tantravārttika,  makes the Mīmāṃsā thesis that the Veda has no human origin compatible  with the reading of the intention (vivakṣā) expressed in a Vedic text. The re- sult of my investigation will additionally contribute towards the understand- ing of the opening verse of Kumārila’s first work, the Ślokavārttika. 2 1. Intention and human statements In the Ślokavārttika, Kumārila finds the reason for the untrustworthiness  of the statements made by human beings, on the one hand, in their inabil- ity to become omniscient (sarvajña) 3 and, on the other hand, in the false- hood of human statements due to the nature of “intention of expression”, or  briefly, “intention” (vivakṣā). 4 When one has a communication with others,  1 I wish to thank Dr. Laurence McCrea for reading through a previous version of  this article, correcting English expressions and giving valuable suggestions. 2 For the chronological sequence of Kumārila’s works, see Yoshimizu 2007, section 2. 3 ŚV Codanāsūtra vv. 110 cd–155. 4 The speaker’s intention of expression is called “tātparya” by later Naiyāyikas. Along  with syntactic expectation (ākāṅkṣā), semantic suitability (yogyatā) and temporal conti- guity (saṃnidhi), which Mīmāṃsakas enumerate as requisites for the  comprehension of  </page> <page sequence="2"> 52 Kiyotaka Yoshimizu one makes a statement by putting words together (racanā), whereby one  takes care to signify one’s intention. 5 As regards human statements, how- ever, it is alleged that one sometimes becomes dishonest and intentionally  gives distorted information that does not represent what one really knows. 6  Even if one has a mind to tell the truth, the statement does not signify one’s  intention enough when one’s mind is confused at the time of utterance. 7 Ad- mitting these possibilities of falsehood in human statements, Kumārila says  that what is known through the statement of an honest person is only the  intention, in other words, the thought of the speaker (vaktṛdhī). 8 Even if the  hearer knows that the speaker is honest, the hearer understands from the  speaker’s statement merely “This is what the speaker knows,” but not “This  is the case.” 9 The truth of the statement is established only when it is empiri- cally proved that the thought of the speaker is based on the reality. 10 sentence meaning, they hold “tātparya” as the fourth requisite. Cf. Raja 1977, pp. 176–187.  T. Fujii (2001, n. 9) points out that Jayanta Bhaṭṭa ascribes tātparyaśakti not to the speaker  but to each word in a sentence. This may be influenced by the Mīmāṃsā usage of the  Bahuvrīhi compound “tat-para” to indicate a subsidiary element (śeṣa) related to a pri- mary in the structure of a sacrifice. The hierarchical relation defined in MmS 3.1.2 “śeṣaḥ  parārthatvāt” is ascertained within a text by means of exegetic devices without reference  to its author.  5 ŚV, Codanāsūtra v. 163: “The comprehension of the meaning of a sentence is formed  [in the consciousness of the hearer] in accordance with the arrangement of the meanings of  words, and the effort of arrangement is influenced by [the speaker’s] knowledge based on in- tention.” (padārtharacanāyatto vākyārthapratyayodbhavaḥ / vivakṣāpūrvavijñānavaśāc  ca racanākṛtiḥ //)  6 ŚV, Codanāsūtra v. 160: “Despite noticing one thing, one occasionally intends to  tell something else. A human statement, therefore, does not necessarily give [us] access to  the thought of the (speaker)” (anyathā saṃvidāno ’pi vivakṣaty anyathā yataḥ / tasmād  ekāntato nāsti puṃvākyāt taddhiyāṃ gatiḥ //)  7 ŚV, Codanāsūtra v. 161: “We observe that someone who is in a state of confusion says  one thing despite intending something else. There is also such a case that [one speaks] in  conformity with one’s intention. Therefore one never takes action [complying with oth- er’s statements].” (bhrāntasyānyavivakṣāyām anyad vākyaṃ ca dṛśyate / yathāvivakṣam  apy etat tasmān naiva pravartate //)  8 ŚV, Codanāsūtra v. 162 ab: “The thought of the speaker is comprehended if hu- man statements originate from trustworthy persons; otherwise a confusion would arise.”  (vaktṛdhīr āptavākyeṣu (ŚV as printed in ŚVṬ: āptavākyena) gamyate ’nyatra viplutiḥ /)  9 ŚV, Codanāsūtra v. 165: “Therefore, even if the hearer becomes aware that information  about something (arthapratyaya) has been derived from a statement, [the hearer] would at- tain [only] the comprehension of the speaker’s knowledge like ‘Thus he knows’.” (tenārtha- pratyayotpāde śrotur jāte ’pi vākyataḥ / jñāto nūnam aneneti vaktur jñāne matir bhavet //) 10 ŚV, Codanāsūtra v. 167: “The statements [of human origin] remain neutral [on va- lidity] at first because [their reference] is confined to the [speaker’s] knowledge. Their  validity, however, would be confirmed if it is proved that the thought of the speaker has  a basis.” (tajjñānāntaritatvāc ca śabdās tāvad udāsate / prāmāṇyasthāpanaṃ tu syād (ŚV  as printed in ŚVṬ: tasmād) vaktṛdhīhetusaṃbhavāt) </page> <page sequence="3">  The Intention of Expression ... and the Authorlessness of the Veda 53 Thus the trustworthiness of a human statement is restricted due to the in- tention of the speaker no matter whether the speaker is honest or dishonest.  When one attempts to know something from a statement made by someone  else, the intention of the speaker intervenes between the given statement and  the comprehension of the reality to be described thereby. In the case of the  Veda, however, there is no possibility of this kind of intervention because  the Veda has no human origin. From the Mīmāṃsā viewpoint, the Veda is  entirely free from the influence of human defects because of its authorless- ness, and thus one can directly recognize the reality by textual comprehen- sion of Vedic statements alone. 11 2. Three ways of explaining the intention expressed  in a Vedic injunction In spite of the negative evaluation of “intention” of a human statement,  Mīmāṃ sakas occasionally take up the problem of how to find the exact  meaning “intended” in a Vedic injunction. For example, Śabarasvāmin con- siders, in his commentary on the seventh section of the Mīmāṃsāsūtra 3.1,  whether the grammatical number of the singular noun “graham” is intended  (vivakṣyate, vivakṣita) in a Vedic injunction, “He wipes a goblet” (grahaṃ  saṃmārṣṭi), which describes a scene of the handling of several goblets to be  used for the soma offerings in the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice. 12 In the introduction  to this section, Kumārila investigates why it is possible to ask the “intention”  (vivakṣā) of a Vedic injunction although the Veda is held to be an authorless  corpus, by offering the following three explanations. 13 11 ŚV, Codanāsūtra v. 170: “Because there is no intervention (antaraya) by the thought  of a (speaker) [when one hears a Vedic injunction], one grasps the reality through the  meanings [of the words that form the injunction]. Thus [the Veda] neither presupposes the  thought [of a speaker] as its foundation nor has any inconformity with the reality.” (tad- buddhyantarayo (ŚV as printed in ŚVṬ; ŚV and ŚV as printed in ŚVK: antarayor)* nāstīty  artho ’rthaiś ca pratīyate / ato na jñānapūrvatvam apekṣyaṃ nāyathārthatā //) *Cf. NR p. 71,31: vaktṛbuddhyantarāyābhāvāt; ŚVK p. 149,17: vaktṛbuddhyantarayor  vyavadhānam api nāstīti. Because Sucaritamiśra glosses “antaraya” with “vyavadhāna”,  the “r” after “antarayo” should be deleted. 12 ŚBh p. 716,15–16: ŚBh’ pt. 4, p. 86,13–14: tasmān naitat kiṃcid api kartuṃ  vivakṣyata iti sarveṣāṃ grahādīnāṃ saṃmārgādi kartavyam iti; ŚBh p. 723,6–7: ŚBh’  pt. 4, p. 94,6–7: avivakṣita ekatve kārakasaṃbandhārtham asyoccāraṇaṃ bhaviṣyati;  ŚBh p. 724,14–15: ŚBh’ pt. 4, p. 4–6: satyaṃ, yatra śrauto ’bhisaṃbandho vivakṣyate.  avivakṣyamāṇe ca vākyāvagataḥ sann aparyudastavyo bhavati. 13 L. McCrea (2000, n. 61) concisely summarizes three explanations. U. Jha (2002,  pp. 36–41; 2003, pp. 26–31) talks about the first two with her own free words. </page> <page sequence="4"> 54 Kiyotaka Yoshimizu In the first explanation, Kumārila appeals to the figurative usage of the de- siderative expression “vivakṣā” adducing a secular sentence, “The riverbank  is about to collapse” (kūlaṃ pipatiṣati). This sentence was already adduced by  Patañjali in his explanation of desiderative conjugation. The desiderative suffix,  saN, is attached to a verbal root that denotes an action that the agent (kartṛ)  desires (icchā) to do. 14 In addition, Kātyāyana admits that one can add saN to  a verbal root that expresses an action of an inanimate being (acetana) if the  speaker has some expectation (ākāṅkṣā), and Patañjali quotes “The riverbank  is about to collapse” (kūlaṃ pipatiṣati) as an instance for this usage. 15 If the  speaker wants to express the expectation that a riverbank is about to collapse  on account of erosion caused by heavy rain, it is allowed to use desiderative  conjugation. Furthermore, Kātyāyana admits that one can use desiderative  conjugation when one describes the action of an inanimate being comparing  (upamāna) to the action of a living being. 16 From this point of view, Kumārila  explains, “The riverbank is about to collapse” (kūlaṃ pipatiṣati) figuratively  (upacarya) describes the collapse of a riverbank as if it desires the collapse by  itself because the time of the collapse is drawing near (pātakālapratyāsatti)  just as a living being is about to take an action on an urgent need. 17 The expression, “The Vedic injunction has such and such intention  (vivakṣā),” too, can be an example of desiderative conjugation based on  a comparison. Kumārila explains this comparison as follows: When the  speaker intends to express the meaning of a word, the speaker composes a  statement that would comprise (parigraha) that meaning. When the speaker,  however, does not intend that, the speaker composes another statement  that does not comprise (aparigraha), in other words, rejects (parityāga) that  meaning. What is brought about as a result of the intention of the speaker,  after all, is a textual structure focused on the meaning of a particular word. 18  14 A 3.1.7: “[The desiderative suffix ‘saN’] is occasionally attached to a verbal root in  order to denote desire, whereby [the action denoted by the verbal root] is the object [of  desire] and has the same agent [as that of desire].” (dhātoḥ karmaṇaḥ samānakartṛkād  icchāyāṃ vā) 15 Vt 12: āśaṅkāyām acetaneṣūpasaṃkhyānam; VMBh pt. 2, p. 14,14: āśaṅkāyām  acetaneṣūpasaṃkhyānaṃ kartavyam. aśmā luluṭiṣati kūlaṃ pipatiṣatīti. 16 Vt 14: upamānād vā siddham; VMBh pt. 2, p. 14,25–26: upamānād vā siddham etat.  katham. luluṭiṣata iva luluṭiṣate. pipatiṣatīva pipatiṣati. 17 TV p. 700,20–21: TV’ pt. 4, p. 67,13–14: “For example, one utters ‘The riverbank  is about to collapse’ attributing the desire [to the riverbank] figuratively on account  of the proximity of the time of the collapse.” (yathaiva kūlaṃ pipatiṣatīty evamādau  pātakālapratyāsatter icchām upacaryaivaṃ vyapadeśo bhavati.) 18 TV p. 700,21–22: TV’ pt. 4, p. 67,14–15: “In the case of the statements that have hu- man origin, too, whether or not [the meaning of a word] is comprised [in an injunction]  is recognized to be the result of whether or not it is intended [by the speaker].” (tathā  pauruṣeyeṣu vākyeṣu parigrahāparigrahau vivakṣāvivakṣayoḥ phalatvena prajñātau.) </page> <page sequence="5">  The Intention of Expression ... and the Authorlessness of the Veda 55 Then, we can assume this causal relation in the process of the comprehension  of a Vedic injunction, too. Even if we cannot find anyone who composed a  Vedic injunction, we find in the injunction a textual structure focused on the  meaning of a particular word. In this case, if we speak as if this structure  were a result of the utterance by someone in ancient times, we could figura- tively say that the meaning of the word is intended (vivakṣita). 19 Kumārila finds it convenient to figuratively use the term “intention” on ac- count of the difficulty in making ordinary people comprehend a Vedic text in a  manner unaccustomed to them. Because ordinary people can hardly imagine a  text without its author, it is necessary to assume an author of the Veda for them.  Kumārila says: The scholars make figurative explanation based on a compari- son (upamānagauṇavṛtti) to everyday discourse in order to make the Veda  accessible to their students of less brilliant intelligence (maṇḍabuddhiśiṣya). 20  If one compares a Vedic injunction to everyday discourse, one can speak as if  the verbal suffix in the optative and the like were a speaker and the enjoinment  issued thereby were the intention of the speaker. 21 19 TV p. 700,18–19: TV’ pt. 4, p. 67,11–12: “Because it is established that whether [the  meaning of a word is] comprised or rejected [in a secular sentence] is the result of whether  or not [the speaker] desires [it], whether or not [the meaning of a word] is intended here  (i.e., in a Vedic injunction) must be indicated by that (i.e., the comprising or the rejection  within the text).” (parigrahaparityāgāv icchānicchāphale sthite / tallakṣaṇārthatā tv atra  syād vivakṣāvivakṣayoḥ //) 20 TV p. 701,13–17: TV’ pt. 4, p. 68,13–16: “Because, indeed, it is impossible to explain  the meaning of a Vedic injunction in an unfamiliar manner that goes beyond the custom  (alaukika), it is necessary to indicate a similarity to the expounding of a human state- ment. For this reason, we find a similarity of the result [of utterance between a Vedic  injunction and a human statement] having recourse to the figurative expression based on  comparison. The authors of [ritual] works and the expounders of [the Vedic scriptures]  utter the expressions, ‘This is intended’ or ‘This is not intended,’ only with reference to  the [textual] comprising or rejection, which are dependent on the fact whether or not [the  referent] is enjoined. [They use figurative expressions] in order to make their students of  less brilliant intelligence understand [what is enjoined in a Vedic injunction].” (tad etad ap- rasiddhālaukikavedavākyārthavyākhyānaprakārakaraṇāśakteḥ pauruṣeyavākyavyākhy- āsādṛśyāpādanārtham antarṇītopamānagauṇavṛttyāśrayaṇena phalasāmānyadarśanād  vidhiśaktyaśaktyadhīnaparigrahāparigrahayor eva vivakṣitāvivakṣitavācoyuktyuccāraṇ- aṃ maṇḍabuddhiśiṣyapratipādanārthaṃ granthakārāṇāṃ vyākhyātṝṇāṃ ca.) 21 TV p. 700,24–26: TV’ pt. 4, p. 67,17–19: “Just as in the case of human statements  it is the person (i.e., the speaker) that urges [the hearer] to the performance of what is  told [to do], so here [in the case of Vedic injunctions] the optative and some other [verbal  endings urge the hearer] due to the denotative power of enjoinment. In the Veda, indeed,  [the verbal endings that have the denotative power] of enjoinment take the position of the  person [i.e., the speaker, in the case of a human statement]; and the enjoinment [issued  from the optative and some other verbal endings] takes the position of the desire of the  person.” (yathaiva pauruṣeyeṣu puruṣo hi pravartakaḥ / ukte ’py arthe tathaiveha liṅādir  vidhiśaktitaḥ // puruṣasthānīyo hi vede vidhāyakaḥ. puruṣecchāsthānīyaṃ vidhitvam.) </page> <page sequence="6"> 56 Kiyotaka Yoshimizu In the first explanation, a Vedic injunction is only figuratively spoken of  as an agent who expresses an intention although there is, in fact, no such  an agent. Although the speaker’s intention to express something brings  about a textual structure focused on that thing, the latter is not necessarily  brought about by the former. In the second explanation, however, Kumārila  affirms the existence of the agent, who is the teacher in the study of the Veda,  namely, ritual specialists expounding (vyākhyā) the Veda. He thereby sepa- rates the origin of the Veda from human beings granting that the Veda has  been handed down only through the generations of teachers and students. 22  Among the expounders of the Veda, exegetes (mīmāṃsaka) and ritualists  (yājñika) are to be distinguished. The exegetes explain the Veda by means of  reasoning while the ritualists do by tradition. 23 But both of them desire to  give their students some information comprised by the denotative power of  injunction and also not to explain anything rejected by it. 24 Thus, if the stu- 22 The distinction between the composer and the expounder of a text was already men- tioned in A 4.3.101: “[The taddhita suffixes introduced from 4.1.83 onwards occur after  a nominal stem that ends in the instrumental] to denote [a text] promulgated by him.”  (tena proktam) and 4.3.116: “[The taddhita suffixes introduced from 4.1.83 onwards oc- cur after a nominal stem that ends in the instrumental] to denote a text composed [by  him].” (kṛte granthe). Patañjali distinguishes two types of intention, namely, “the speak- er’s intention” (prayoktrī vivakṣā) expressed in an utterance of a person who deliber- ately chooses suitable words and “the public intention” (laukikī vivakṣā) expressed in  a statement generally accepted (yatra prāyasya saṃpratyayaḥ) in the world (loka). See  VMBh pt. 2, pp. 342,26–343,3 (on A 5.1.16); van Nooten 1983, p. 50. The Nyāya school  of the post-Kumārila times asserts that scriptures have authority because they are ac- cepted by major people (mahājana) who represent various classes, ages and districts (NM  p. 638,10–11). For the Nyāya concept “mahājana”, see Chemparathy 1983, pp. 58–64.  The term “mahājanaparigraha” is used in ŚV Codanāsūtra v. 98. Kumārila, however, op- poses the authority of social rules as based on the custom adopted by Aryan people. He  thereby takes precautions against the ethical relativism. According to him, social rules  must be based on the Vedic scriptures (vedamūla/ śāstramūla). See ŚV, Autpattikasūtra  vv. 6 cd–7; TV p. 194,27–28: TV’ pt. 2, p. 113,11–12; TV p. 195,1–2: TV’ pt. 2, p. 113,16–18;  Halbfass 1991, p. 111. As regards the authority of the Veda itself, Kumārila expresses his  distrust of the proof of the Vedic authority based on its acceptance by successive genera- tions of human beings appealing to the maxim of a succession of the blind’s testimony  (andhaparamparānyāya; cf. ŚBh pp. 162,4–163,1: ŚBh’ pt. 2, pp. 73,1–74,2; Harikai 1974,  p. 46) in TV p. 113,9: TV’ pt. 2, p. 11,3–4 (cf. Harikai 1990, pp. 111, 325). For another ver- sion of the andhaparaṃparā tale, see TvS 15; PVSV p. 167,4–5; Wakahara 1900, p. n.5. 23 TV p. 701,18–19: TV’ pt. 4, p. 68,18–19: “Or, these (expressions ‘being intended’ and  ‘not being intended’) are used with reference to the intention of those exegetes and ritual- ists who respectively expound the Veda by means of reasoning or in accordance with tra- ditions.” (nyāyena saṃpradāyād vā ye mīmāṃsakayājñikāḥ / vedaṃ vyācakṣate teṣām  abhiprāyo ’yam ucyate //). Cf. PVSV p. 168,3–4: na saṃpradāyān na yukter na lokād iti. 24 TV p. 701,20–22: TV’ pt. 4, pp. 68,20–69,1: “They make explanations of a Vedic  injunction in conformity with the denotative power of words.

A student has to learn  how to interpret a Vedic text from his teacher, who also previously, as a stu- dent, learned the interpretation from the teacher’s own teacher. Thus every  expounder has a preceding expounder from whom he inherits the method of  how to interpret the text. 26 Therefore, it is possible to say that the intention  that a person signifies in expounding a Vedic text is, contrary to the inten- tion of the speaker in everyday discourse, not the cause that establishes the  meaning of the text, but the effect evoked by the self-determining text of  the Veda. Expounders may make an earnest effort to inform their students  of the sentence meaning, which was, however, already established within  the text in advance. In the third explanation, contrastively, Kumārila asserts the existence of  an agent who signifies his own intention in a Vedic injunction. According  to this explanation, a supreme self (paramātman) has its body in the sphere  of space (vyoman). 27 Sounds (śabda) are the quality (guṇa) characteristic of  to expound those meanings that are left by their denotative power (śabdaśaktyanusāreṇa  vākyārthaṃ gamayanti te / tatra yaḥ śaktyupārūḍhaḥ sa tair vyākhyātum iṣyate // yas tu  śaktyā parityakto na vyācikhyāsyate sa taiḥ /) 25 TV p. 701,23–24: TV’ pt. 4, p. 69,2–5: “Therefore, the meaning [of a word] they want  to expound is said to be intended, whereas [the meaning of a word] they do not want [to  expound] is said not to be intended for the reason that [the sentence] does not afford [the  expression of it]. Thus, what is called ‘intended’ [in a Vedic injunction] is that which  was desired [to be expounded] by those expounders who graduated [the course of study]  (samāvṛtta, cf. Mn 3.4) in earlier times, whereas what is called ‘not intended’ is that which  was not desired [to be expounded] by them.” (tena vyākhyātum iṣṭo ’rtho yas teṣāṃ sa  vivakṣitaḥ // aniṣṭo yas tv aśaktitvād avivakṣita eva saḥ / ataḥ pūrvasamāvṛttavyākhy- ātriṣṭaṃ (TV’: pūrta-) vivakṣitam // tenocyeta tathā teṣāṃ tv aniṣṭaṃ tv avivakṣitam/);  TV p. 702,3: TV’ pt. 4, p. 69,6–7: tasmād vyākhyātṛgatam eva vivakṣitāvivakṣitatvam  upanyasya vicāraṇād vede ’py avirodhaḥ. 26 It is a standard method for Mīmāṃsakas to distinguish the user of a language  from its originator and thereby to prove its eternity for the reason of its beginning- less usage in the society.

Mayrhofer, Bd. II, p. 594),  Kumārila identifies vyoman with space (ākāśa). In a verse of the Vyākaraṇādhikaraṇa, he  refers to vyoman as an example of eternal (nitya) entities, which he, in its prose explanation,  enumerates in the style of Vaiśeṣika, namely, space (ākāśa), direction (diś), time (kāla),  the self (ātman) and atoms (paramāṇu) (TV p. 285,10–12: TV’ pt. 2, pp. 223,25–224,2).  In a section on ātman as the abode of apūrva, he uses “vyoman” in the sense of the all- pervading space: “[Opponent:] If the ātman is all-pervading, there could be only one  ātman common to all bodies, just like space. [Proponent:] There is no such a fault.”  </page> <page sequence="8"> 58 Kiyotaka Yoshimizu space, and the Veda is a scripture consisting of sounds that have orally been  handed down forever. Kumarila, accordingly, imagines that one and the same  supreme self is embodied in all of the oral scriptures of the Veda. 28 What this  supreme self intends to instruct is comprised by a Vedic injunction, whereas  what he does not intend to instruct is rejected by it. 29 The term “intention”,  in this case, is applied not figuratively but primarily (mukhyavṛtti). 30 For  this remarkable idea that the Veda is the body (deha, śarīra) of the supreme  self, see another article of mine. 31 3. The formation of a textual structure centered on the enjoinment No matter how the Vedic agent is considered, it remains unchanged that the  structure of a Vedic injunction is focused on the meaning of a particular word  by its own denotative power (svaśakti). That means, we are not allowed to in- terpret the text arbitrarily according to our own convenience (asmadicchā). 32  With this, however, Kumārila only puts off the solving of the problem be- cause it remains to be explained why a Vedic injunction does not comprise,  in other words, rejects the meaning of a certain word although all of its com- ponent words equally denote their own meanings. 33 Because each section in  the third volume (adhyāya) of the Mīmāṃsāsūtra deals with the structure of  an example sentence, Kumārila, here, confines the discussion to the general  relation between the enjoinment (vidhātrī śrutiḥ) and other functions of the  words that constitute a Vedic injunction. 34 These functions (śruti) are classi- (TV p. 403,20–21: TV’ pt. 2, p. 376,21–22: nanu ca sarvagatatve vyomavat sarvaśarīreṣv  eka evātmā prāpnoti. naiṣa doṣaḥ). Mahābhārata (MBh) 12.211.47 ab includes vyoman  in the enumeration of the constituents of a body along with other four material elements  (bhūvyomatoyānalavāyavo hi sadā śarīraṃ paripālayanti /). 28 TV pp. 702,23–703,9: TV’ pt. 4, pp. 69,8–70,10.  29 TV p. 703,12–15: TV’ pt. 4, p. 70,13–16. 30 TV p. 703,16–17: TV’ pt. 4, p. 70,17–18. 31 See Yoshimizu 2007, sections 3, 4 and 5. 32 TV p. 701,3–4: TV’ pt. 4, p. 68,1–2: “For the sake of enjoinment, it is only by means  of their own denotative power that the words of enjoinment [in Vedic injunctions] are  directed to those meanings carried by suitable words; they are not [directed] to every- thing in accordance with our wish.” (vidhānāya pravartante svaśaktyaiva vidhāyakāḥ /  yogyaśabdopanīte ’rthe sarvasmin nāsmadicchayā //) 33 TV p. 700,22–23: TV’ pt. 4, p. 67,21–22: “[Question:] How could there be non-com- prising of what is directly expressed?

The  other two kinds of functions, namely, the direct denotation and the assign- ment, cannot urge the hearer to perform an action. The direct denotation  (abhidhātrī) of a word makes one notice “This exists here” (idam ihāsti),  whereas the assignment (viniyoktrī) of case-suffixes makes one notice “This  is subsidiary to that” (asyedam). However, insofar as the direct denotation  and the assignment are not related to the enjoinment, the reader does not be- come aware of the obligation to take an action that deals with their referent  (tadviṣayakartavyatābuddhi). 36 Whether the meaning of a word is intended  depends on the fact whether the enjoinment is focused on that meaning  ( vidhitsita-avidhitsita). 37 Moreover, the function of enjoinment is not brought to completion  within a single injunction. Instead, it repeatedly makes a transition from  one object to another within a Vedic text that consists of an aggregate of sen- tences. 38 First, the optative ending of the verb in the fundamental injunction  (codanā) of a Vedic sacrifice, for example, “One who desires heaven should  perform (yajeta) the Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice,” issues an enjoinment focused on  the “bringing into being” (bhāvanā) of the hearer. 39 “Bringing into being”  is the general form of intentional action of human beings.

When one performs an action (kriyā) of offering, however,  one needs various necessities called “formative factors” (kāraka) without  which one cannot perform an action. On the side of the Veda, the funda- mental injunction requires subsidiary injunctions called “injunctions of as- signment” (viniyogavidhi), in which the enjoinment of “bringing into being”  becomes redirected into the formative factors (kāraka) denoted by various  nouns within the context of the sacrifice. 40 In this way, the Vedic text forms  an autonomous structure in which each of many injunctions is respectively  focused on the meaning of a particular word. 4. The texts named after a person: Were they revealed or composed? Kumārila’s first explanation is that one can figuratively use the term “inten- tion” for the expounding of an injunction of the authorless Veda. He may  offer this explanation from expediency to counter the criticism that one has  to assume a human author of the Veda insofar as a Vedic injunction causes  the comprehension of an intention. 41 Because he restricts the figurative use  of the term “intention” to the scene of education where a teacher instructs  students of less brilliant intelligence (maṇḍabuddhiśiṣya), 42 he seems to ad- mit that this is not a convincing rejoinder but just a provisional one. Owing  to this figurative explanation, the student might be inclined to believe the  existence of a person who composed the Veda in ancient times. This expla- nation is, therefore, disadvantageous to the Mīmāṃsā standpoint and thus  should be given up by other ways of explanation. 43 40 TV p. 701,9: TV’ pt. 4, p. 68,8–9: “The formative factors other than [the meaning of  the verbal root] are, however, indirectly [enjoined] for the reason that it (i.e., the bringing  of the purpose into being) would not be otherwise established.” (tadanyathānupapattes  tv arthāt kārakāntarāṇi); TV p. 701,12–13: TV’ pt. 4, p. 68,11–13: “If the singleness and  other [qualities of a substance] qualify the ‘bringing into being’ by working as a formative  factor, then they turn to be intended because they are touched by the enjoinment. If, how- ever, they [only] qualify a substance, then they do not turn to be intended” (tatra yady  ekatvādi kārakatvena bhāvanāviśeṣaṇam tato vidhisaṃsparśād vivakṣitaṃ bhaviṣyati.  atha dravyaviśeṣaṇaṃ tato na vivakṣitam iti.) 41 As a reason for the human origin of the Veda, Bhāviveka points out that the Veda  produces in the hearer the comprehension of the meaning intended by a speaker (vivakṣit- ārthadhījanmakāraṇatva). See MT v. 30. 42 Cf. footnote 20. 43 Dharmakīrti accuses Jaimini of deceitfully (tadvyājena) ascribing (samāropa) his  own views to the Veda (PVSV p. 171,20–22) adding an ironical remark in PV I v. 325:  </page> <page sequence="11">  The Intention of Expression ... and the Authorlessness of the Veda 61 The second explanation is that it is the expounder (vyākhyātṛ) of the Veda  who expresses his intention through a Vedic injunction. With this explana- tion, Kumārila adopts a traditional method, whereby the Mīmāṃsā school  defended the authorlessness of the Veda against the criticism that some scrip- tures of the Veda, for example, the Kāṭhaka, are named after an individual  person such as Kaṭha. 44 Mīmāṃsāsūtra 1.1.30 states that what the person  whose name is prefixed to a Vedic text did is only to promulgate (pravacana)  a particular text among the vast Vedic corpus. 45 In the last section of the  Ślokavārttika, the Vedanityatādhikaraṇa, Kumārila tries to strengthen the  traditional differentiation between the expounder and the composer. 46 He  defends this theory against an opponent who argues that the text called  “Kāṭhaka” was expounded not only by Kaṭha but also by other scholars and  thus Kaṭha must be the author of the Kāṭhaka. Kumārila answers: Although  “[Asked for direction,] someone answers ‘This post says that this is the way [you should  go].’ Another person answers ‘[After having confirmed the way] by myself, I will tell  you.’ You should investigate the difference between these two persons.” (eṣa sthāṇur ayaṃ  mārga iti vaktīti kaścana / anyaḥ svayaṃ bravīmīti tayor bhedaḥ parīkṣyatām //). Cf.  Wakahara 1990, pp. 21–22. Dharmakīrti’s criticism is based on a figurative explanation  from the opposite standpoint, whereby it is pointed out that the Veda appears as if it is  revealed without its author although it is, in fact, nothing but camouflaged statements of  someone with wicked intention. This criticism might have some relation to TvS 14, where  Buddha criticizes some brahmins acquainted with the three Vedas for instructing a way  (magga) to Brahmā although they have never seen him. 44 The name “Kaṭha” is mentioned together with “Caraka” in A 4.3.107. According to  Patañjali, Kaṭha is a disciple of Vaiśampāyana and the teacher of Khāḍāyana. Cf. VMBh  pt. 2, p. 316,4–5; Weber 1973 b, pp. 437–438; Tsuji 1982, p. 36; Gonda 1975, p. 326. 45 MmS 1.1.30: “[Some scriptures of the Veda are] named after a person because of  promulgation.” (ākhyā pravacanāt); ŚBh p. 102,5–8: ŚBh’ pt. 1, pp. 122,6–123,3: “Even  without assuming any author, indeed, it is possible to explain the fact that [a certain  Vedic scripture is named after a person like Kaṭha]. It may be the case that Kaṭha and  others so prominently promulgated [a particular scripture] as matched by nobody else;  such being the case, indeed, they are expounders. They say that Vaiśampāyana stud- ied [the Vedic scriptures] of all branches, whereas Kaṭha instructed only this particu- lar branch.” (akartṛbhir api hy enām (= samākhyā) ācakṣīran. prakarṣeṇa vacanam  ananyasādhāraṇaṃ kaṭhādibhir anuṣṭhitaṃ syāt, tathāpi hi samākhyātāro bhavanti.  smaryate ca vaiśampāyanaḥ sarvaśākhādhyāyī, kaṭhaḥ punar imāṃ kevalāṃ śākhām  adhyāpayāṃbabhūveti).

For the teacher-student  relationship between Vaiśampāyana and Kaṭha, see footnote 44. 46 ŚV, Vedanityatādhikaraṇa v. 4: “Because this [name like ‘Kaṭha’ prefixed to a Vedic  scripture] may be explained otherwise, that is, as a result of [Kaṭha’s] promulgation, it can- not become the reason for his being the author. And it is traditionally established [in gram- mar (A 4.3.101: tena proktam) that the suffix vuÑ (A 4.3.126: gotracaraṇād vuÑ, cf. 7.1.1  and 7.2.115) in ‘Kāṭhaka’] denotes a promulgated text.” (anyathāpy upapannatvād iyaṃ  pravacanādinā / na śaktā kartṛmūlāya prokte ca smaraṇaṃ sthitam //). For A 4.3.101, see  footnote 22. </page> <page sequence="12"> 62 Kiyotaka Yoshimizu there may be many expounders of a text, it can be named after a particular  person (eka iṣyate) on behalf of others (pārārthya) who also have expounded  the text. 47 He adduces some cases of such a representation. 48 The differentiation of the expounder from the composer, however, is  not convincing on the authorlessness of the Veda because there is another  genre of ritual literature, called “kalpasūtra,” 49 each of which is not only  a detailed description of Vedic sacrifices but also named after a person. If  the Kāṭhaka is accepted as a revealed scripture (śruti) in spite of the per- sonal name “Kaṭha” prefixed to the title, one cannot but admit that all the  kalpasūtras, too, are revealed scriptures because they are, in the same man- ner as the Kāṭhaka, named after particular persons, such as Maśaka, 50 who  we could say did nothing but the explanation of a revealed scripture. 51 The  47 ŚV, Vedanityatādhikaraṇa v. 9. 48 The Jyotiṣṭoma sacrifice is called “vairūpasāmā,” although many other sāmans are  chanted in the sacrifice (v. 7). A woman is called “mother of Ḍittha” even if she has not  only Ḍittha but also other children (v. 8). A place of pilgrimage (tīrtha) is named after a  particular person although many people visit there (v. 10). 49 In TV p. 229,10–20: TV’ pt. 2, p. 155,8–18, Kumārila distinguishes kalpa and sūtra.  Kalpas are those treatises that follow the fixed procedure of sacrifices (siddharūpaḥ prayogo  yaiḥ karmaṇām anugamyate / te kalpāḥ). Because of laying down (kalpana) the proce- dure, they are used as means for the performance of a sacrifice (anuṣṭhānasādhana). The  works of Baudhāyana, Varāha and Maśaka are enumerated as examples of kalpa (baudhā- yanīyavārāhamāśakādiprabandhavat). Sūtras are, on the other hand, those treatises that  systematically describe the sacrifices (lakṣaṇārtha). They describe them applying their  own technical terms and metarules (svasaṃjñāparibhāṣā), differentiating general rules  and exceptions (utsargāpavādana) and adducing reasons and examples (hetudṛṣṭāntavat)  for rules. The works of Aśvalāyana, Baijavāpa (Tsuji 1982, pp. 81–82; Gonda 1977,  p. 603), Drāhyāyana, Lātīya and Kātyāyana are enumerated as examples of sūtras. Later,  Kumārila adds Āpastamba to the list of the authors of kalpasūtras (TV p. 239,24: TV’  pt. 2, p. 167,8; TV p. 240,4: TV’ pt. 2, p. 167,15). The Baudhāyanaśrautasūtra (Tsuji 1982,  p. 17; Gonda 1977, p. 514) and the Ārṣeyakalpa (Gonda 1977, p. 535) are recognized as  old kalpasūtras. Moreover, the method of description Kumārila finds in sūtras is system- atical as if influenced by the Pāṇinian school of grammar. Thus, except for the VārŚS  included in kalpas, the kalpas and the sūtras Kumārila enumerates can be held as forming  an old group and a new group of śrautasūtras. Kumārila might consider the traditional  appellations “pravacanakāra” given to Baudhāyana and “sūtrakāra” to Āpastamba. Cf.  Bodhāyanagṛhyasūtra 3.9.6 (ed. Shama Sastri); Gonda 1977, p. 514. It is, however, hard  to understand why Kumārila does not classify the Vārāhaśrautasūtra (VārŚS) into sūtras  although VārŚS 1.1.1 is a paribhāṣā section. Does Kumārila refer to a version of the VārŚS  totally different from the existent one, or, could it be the Vādhūlaśrautasūtra, namely,  the Taittirīya śrautasūtra being as old as the Baudhāyana (Tsuji 1982, p. 30; Gonda 1977,  p. 522)? 50 For Maśaka as the author of the Ārṣeyakalpa, see Gonda 1977, pp. 534–535. Accord- ing to LŚS 7.9.14, Maśaka is Gārgya, i.e., a descendent of Garga. Cf. Weber 1973 a, p. 384;  Caland 1908, p. VII. 51 TV p. 230,29–30: TV’ pt. 2, p. 157,7–8. </page> <page sequence="13">  The Intention of Expression ... and the Authorlessness of the Veda 63 Mīmāṃsāsūtra 1.3.11–14 forms a section called “Kalpasūtrādhikaraṇa,” on  which Śabara wrote only a brief gloss. 52 Kumārila, however, writes a large  sub-commentary on it to demonstrate that the kalpasūtras are not to be held  as revealed scriptures. According to Kumārila, what distinguishes kalpasūtras from the author- less Veda and makes them man-made compositions in spite of the common  feature as ritual texts is “the firmness of the memory of the author” 53 or,  in other words, “the firm memory of the author” 54 among Aryan people.  It has been fixed in the memory of many generations (puruṣaparaṃparā)  of teachers and students that the text is a work composed by a person. 55  52 The proponent sūtras are MmS 1.3.12 “nāsaṃniyamāt”, 13 “avākyaśeṣāc ca” and  14 “sarvatra ca prayogāt saṃnidhānaśāstrāc ca.” Śabara glosses “asanniyama” as “naitat  saṃyagnibandhanam” and explains that kalpasūtras are not accentuated (svarābhāva).  Kumārila, however, points out that even the eight brāhmaṇas of the Chandogas (cf. Gonda  1975, pp. 320, 347) are not accentuated, and he asserts that no-restriction (asaṃniyama)  in this case indicates that the study of kalpasūtras is not prohibited (anadhyāya, cf.  Mn 2.107–106; 4.101–127) on account of ominous incidents (TV p. 240,6–16: TV’ pt. 2,  p. 167,17–26). Śabara considers the “rest of a sentence” (vākyaśeṣa) as arthavāda. Kumārila  adduces some examples of Vedic myths and declares that one who would compose and  teach those tales would be treated like an idiot (TV p. 240,16–24: TV’ pt. 2, p. 168,4–11).  He remarks that no kalpasūtra contains such vākyaśeṣas ignoring the fact that some older  śrautasūtras, e.g., the Baudhāyana (Tsuji 1982, p. 17; n. 131; Gonda 1977, p. 515), contain  myths. According to Śabara, MmS 1.3.14 refers to the case that a rule prescribed in a  kalpasūtra is contradicted by an existent injunction of the Veda. It is, therefore, Kumārila  who introduced into the Kalpasūtrādhikaraṇa the discussion about the significance of the  personal names prefixed to the titles of ritual texts. 53 TV p. 239,18: TV’ pt. 2, p. 167,2: kartṛsmṛtidraḍhimnaḥ (IO 2151; Ānandāśrama ed.:  -dṛḍhimnaḥ). 54 TV p. 239,22: TV’ pt. 2,p. 167,6: dṛḍhakartṛsmṛtes.

[The main  reason for their being authors of the kalpasūtras is that] they are fixed as the authors by a  series of human generations in memory. It is only when this reason is given that their name  [prefixed to the title of the texts] is brought forward as an additional reason.” (na caiṣāṃ  samākhyāmātrabalād eva kartṛmattvam (IO 2151; Ānandāśrama ed.: kartṛtvam) ucy- ate, yenākhyā pravacanād ity uttaram ucyate. puruṣaparamparayaiva hi smṛteṣu kartṛṣu  samākhyābhyuccayahetutvena jñāyate.) </page> <page sequence="14"> 64 Kiyotaka Yoshimizu Compared with this main reason, the title of a kalpasūtra named after a  person is nothing more than an additional reason (abhyuccayahetu) for the  kalpasūtra having been composed by the person. 56 The “firmness of the memory of the author,” however, cannot be the  sufficient reason for making kalpasūtras ancillary to the revealed Veda  because, Kumārila admits, there are actually some schools that recog- nize a particular kalpasūtra as an authority equal to the Veda. 57 Within  these schools, such a kalpasūtra is handed down as a text the valid- ity of which does not need to assume (anumāna) a corresponding Vedic  text. 58 Nevertheless, Kumārila assigns foremost priority to the Veda. If  there is a coincidence (saṃvāda) between a kalpasūtra and a brāhmaṇa  text of the Veda, he categorically says, the former must be a reiteration  (anuvāda) of the latter because the latter exclusively consists of injunctions  (aikāntikavidhitva) 59; and thus the kalpasūtra cannot have independent  authority (na svatantrapramāṇatā). 60 Then, we should ask: Does Kumārila  have any good reason to assert that only the Veda is the authorless scrip- ture that has independent authority? 56 Kumārila additionally makes a conjecture that “Kaṭha” is the name of a subdivi- sion (caraṇa) of a Vedic school rather than the name of an individual. (M. Witzel [1997,  n. 217] points out that Patañjali [on A 6.3.42] mentions Kaṭha as a tribe. See VMBh  pt. 3, p. 157,14: “a woman of Kaṭha tribe, a woman of Kaṭha district” [kaṭhajātīyā  kaṭhadeśīyā].) The text called “Kāṭhaka” is thus proved to be perpetual because of  the perpetuity of the Vedic branch that preserves the text (TV p. 239,28–29: TV’ pt. 2,  p. 167,13–14, cf. ŚV, Vedanityatādhikaraṇa v. 12). “Maśaka” and other names prefixed  to kalpasūtras, on the other hand, respectively designate a person who has a beginning,  namely, a birth (ādimadekadravya). It is therefore impossible to use these names in the  title of revealed texts that have no beginning (anādigrantha) (TV pp. 239,29–240,5: TV’  pt. 2, p. 167,14–16). 57 The opponent points out that Lāṭa (i.e., Lāṭyāyana), Drāhyāyana and Kātyāyana at- tach more importance to the Ārṣeyakalpa of Maśaka than to brāhmaṇas (TV p. 231,17–29:  TV’ pt. 2, pp. 157,26–158,13). Cf.

According to MmS 1.3.3, The authority of a smṛti text is denied if the smṛti text is sup- posed to be based on an assumed Vedic text which is, however, proved to be incompatible  with an existent Vedic text. Moreover, because kalpasūtras have a more detailed descrip- tion of a sacrifice than the Veda, it is impossible to perform a sacrifice following the Veda  alone without the help of kalpasūtras (TV p. 232,13–14: TV’ pt. 2, p. 158,23–24). 59 TV p. 241,26–27: TV’ pt. 2, p. 169,21–22. 60 TV p. 241,21–22: TV’ pt. 2, p. 169,16–17. </page> <page sequence="15">  The Intention of Expression ... and the Authorlessness of the Veda 65 5. The Vedic impression convincing the authorlessness What really makes Kumārila convinced of the authorlessness of the Veda  and of its clear distinction from kalpasūtras is not any kind of reasoning, but  a profound emotion evoked by the recitation of Vedic mantras. 61 He asserts  that owing to this excitement one would cease to suspect the human origin  of the Veda if one listens only to the beginning of the saṃhitās of the three  Vedas. 62 In the world, poets compose verses connecting words and phrases  in accordance with one’s own experience of events (dṛṣṭārthavyavahāra). 63  What a Vedic mantra does, however, is to illustrate an event inaccessible  for human beings with a brilliantly impressive literary language. 64 Quot- ing Ṛgvedasaṃhitā 1.1.1 “I glorify Agni as the foremost in rank, as the  god who timely performs a sacrifice, as the main priest who brings about  the best treasure” (agním īḷe puróhitaṃ yajñásya devám ṛtvíjam / hótāraṃ  ratnadhtamam), Kumārila repeats to say that no one can observe the  state of affairs illustrated by each part of this verse. 65 Turning then to the  first three parts of the Yajurveda mantras, “For a draft you” (iṣé tvā), “for  strength you” (ūrjé tvā) 66 and “You are winds” (vāyáva[s] stha), 67 Kumārila  emphasizes that no one can hit upon these phrases to illustrate the respective  61 K. Harikai (1994, pp. 157–158) refers to the following comments by Kumārila on  the beginnings of the saṃhitās of the three Vedas. 62 TV p. 237,11–15: TV’ pt. 2, p. 164,17–21: “For the pseudo-reasons, for example,  that the Vedas consist of an aggregate of words and sentences [just like human state- ments], there may, at first, arise a fallacy that [the Veda] is something created so long  as one does not perceive the own form of the Veda owing to one’s heretical position.  No sooner, however, one perceives the own form of a ṛc, a sāman and other [mantras]  than this fallacy disappears. If one listens only to the beginnings of the [three] Vedas,  nobody who has intelligence would in the least consider that they have human origin.”  (vedeṣu hi tāvad eva padavākyasaṃghātātmakatvādihetvābhāsaiḥ kṛtakatvabhrāntir  bhavati. yāvad (IO 2151; Ānandāśrama ed.: yā tad) bahiravasthānād vedarūpaṃ na  dṛśyate / ṛgsāmādisvarūpe tu dṛṣṭe bhrāntir nivartate // ādimātram api śrutvā vedānāṃ  pauruṣeyatā / na śakyādhyavasātuṃ hi manāg api sacetanaiḥ //) 63 TV p. 237,16–17: TV’ pt. 2, p. 164,22–23. 64 TV p. 237,18–19: TV’ pt. 2, p. 164,24–25: “Who could compose the Ṛgveda with  those words that are [organized into] sixty-four lectures,* endowed with fixed accents  and mostly not found in the ordinary language?” (prapāṭhakacatuḥṣaṣṭiniyatasvarakaiḥ  padaiḥ / lokeṣv apy aśrutaprāyair ṛgvedaṃ kaḥ kariṣyati //). * Sixty-four prapāṭhakas result from the mechanical division of the Ṛgveda into eight  aṣṭakas each of which is subdivided into eight adhyāyas. Cf. Gonda 1975, p. 9. 65 TV pp. 237,20–238,3: TV’ pt. 2, p. 165,1–12. 66 According to Someśvara (NSu p. 236,33), Kumārila quotes “ūrjeti” (TV p. 228,7:  TV’ pt. 2, p. 165,16: evam ūrjety ayaṃ mantraḥ) instead of “ūrja ity” (Someśvara: ūrjay  iti) for fear of the excess of syllables in a verse (ślokākṣarātirekāpattibhītyā). 67 TS 1.1.1, KS 1.1, KapS 1.1 and VS 1.1 coincide with each other in the form of these  three parts whereas MS 1.1 has “subhūtya” as the second part. Cf. Keith 1967, p. 1, n. 2;  </page> <page sequence="16"> 66 Kiyotaka Yoshimizu scenes of the preparation of the dairy oblation (sāṃnāyya) in the new moon  sacrifice, namely, the cutting of a twig (śākhāccheda), the rubbing of the  twig (śākhānumārjana) 68 and the  driving away of calves (vatsāpākaraṇa)  by the twig. 69 Lastly, with regard to the beginning of Sāmavedasaṃhitā  1.1.1, “Come, Agni, to the feast” (ágna  yāhi vītáye), which is quoted  from Ṛgveda 6.16.10, Kumārila rhetorically wonders how any intelligent  person (buddhipūrvakārin) could devise the extraordinary method of  chanting sāmans by pronouncing a ṛc verse with excessive transformation  of vowels in a manner based neither on common usage nor on grammar  (lokavyākaraṇādiṣv anavagatapūrvam). 70 From these examples of the three  Vedas, Kumārila concludes that for anyone who has ever appreciated the  actual texts of the Veda it is totally self-evident (svasaṃvedyam eva) that the  Veda has no human origin 71 and only the autonomous (svatantra) Veda can  create such hymns. 72 Let us return to Kumārila’s explanations about the “intention” (vivakṣā)  signified in a Vedic injunction. Elucidating the difference between kalpasūtras  and the Veda, he displays a surprise at the brilliance of Vedic hymns. Judg- ing from his exaltation of Vedic hymns, Kumārila seems deliberately to put  the three explanations in an order. He thereby gradually leads us from a  provisional rejoinder based on figurative expression to the traditional dif- MŚS 1.1.1.15: subhūtāyeti saṃnamayati; VārŚS 1.2.1.3: subhūtāyeti saṃnamati. Does the  quotation of “ūrjé tvā” suggest that Kumārila does not belong to the Maitrāyaṇī school? 68 Unlike Kumārila, the relevant brāhmaṇas of the Yajurveda (cf. Keith 1967, p. 1, n. 1),  i.e., Taittirīyabrāhmaṇa 3.2.1.3 (ed. Mahadeva Sastri), KS 30.10: p. 192,14, KapS 45.8,  Śatapathabrāhmaṇa 1.7.1.2 (ed. Weber), and some śrautasūtras (ŚS), i.e., BaudhāyanaŚS  1.1 (ed. Caland, pp. 1, 10), ĀpastambaŚS 1.1.10 (ed. Garbe) and KātyāyanaŚS 4.2.1–2 (ed.  Weber), assign both “iṣe tvā” and “ūrje tvā” to the  cutting of a twig. U. Rustagi (1981,  p. 65, n. 5), however, enumerates some śrautasūtras that assign “ūrje tvā” to the straighten- ing (saṃnamayati) or the rubbing (anumārṣṭi) of the twig, namely, BhāradvājaŚS 1.2.10 (ed.  Kashikar), ĀpastambaŚS 1.1.11 (an alternative to 1.1.10), HiraṇyakeśiŚS 1.2 (Ānandāśrama  ed.: p. 76) and VaikhānasaŚS 3.3 (ed. Caland), to which VādhūlaŚS 2.1.9 (ed. Chaubey)  and BaudhāyanaŚS 20.1 (Dvaidhasūtra, p. 5; cf. Nishimura 2006, p. 100) are to be added.  KātyāyanaŚS 4.2.3 mentions a view of uttering “ūrje tvā” at the straightening. 69 TV p. 238,5–10: TV’ pt. 2, p. 165,14–19. With this explanation, Someśvara points out  (NSu p. 236,30–31), the Yajurveda brāhmaṇa that assigns (viniyojaka) the utterance of a  yajus to a particular action is also said by Kumārila to have no human origin. 70 TV p. 238,13–19: TV’ pt. 2, pp. 165,22–166,1. Cf. Gonda 1975, p. 316, n. 29. 71 TV p. 238,23–24: TV’ pt. 2, p. 166,5–6,: “Thus, whenever students, teachers or by- standers appreciate the form of Vedic words, Vedic injunctions and their meanings, they  self-evidently feel convinced that [the Veda] has no human origin.” (evaṃ ca yadā yadā- (IO 2151; Ānandāśrama ed.: yadā-)adhyetāro ’dhyāpayitārāḥ pārśvasthā vā vedapadavāk- yatadartharūpāṇy ālocayanti tadā tadā (IO 2151; Ānandāśrama ed.: tadā) svasaṃvedyam  evāpauruṣeyatvam adhyavasyanti.) 72 TV p. 238,4: TV’ pt. 2, p. 165,13: svatantro veda evaitat kevalo vaktum arhati / </page> <page sequence="17">  The Intention of Expression ... and the Authorlessness of the Veda 67 ferentiation of the expounder from the composer, and finally to his own  view that reflects his inner conviction. 73 The Veda constructs an autono- mous structure in an aggregate of injunctions by repeatedly comprising the  meaning of a word. This structure may make one think of the organism of  an extraordinary body, which the supreme self (paramātman) intentionally  sets in motion to give ritual instructions far beyond human creativity. The final explanation reminds us of the very first verse of the Ślokavārttika:  “Reverence to him who is embodied in the purified knowledge, him whose  eyes are the three Vedas, him who is the efficient cause for the attainment of  bliss and who bears a part of the moon.” 74 Here Kumārila confesses to his  adoration for Śiva who wears the crescent moon (somārdhadhārin) 75 and il- lustrates Śiva’s three divine eyes as being the three Vedas (trivedīdivyacakṣus).  This illustration seems to be more than a metaphor that would praise Śiva’s  omniscience. Because the attainment of bliss (śreyaḥprāpti) is the aim in per- forming Vedic sacrifices, 76 Śiva who is said to be its “efficient cause” (nimitta)  must have a close connection with the Vedic sacrifices. We may say that here  Kumārila praises Śiva as a personification of the Veda, because Kumārila  characterizes him as having a body (deha) made of “purified knowledge”  (viśuddhajñāna), 77 which we can etymologically construe as the essence  73 Kumārila concludes his introduction with the third explanation and then begins to  take up the main theme of the seventh section, namely, the theorem of the singleness of a  goblet (grahaikatvanyāya). 74 ŚV, Pratijñāsūtra v. 1: viśuddhajñānadehāya trivedīdivyacakṣuṣe / śreyaḥprāptini- mittāya namaḥ somārdhadhāriṇe // Cf. Shastri, Pashupatinath 1980, pp. 151–153. This  verse seems to be the genuine opening verse because Umbeka (8 c.), the earliest commenta- tor on the ŚV, comments on it. In ŚVK p. 1,21–22, Sucaritamiśra points out that Kumārila’s  making of reverence to Śiva does not contradict the Mīmāṃsā anti- anthropomorphism  (MmS 9.1.6–10) for the reason that Kumārila thereby follows the exegetic rule that the  making of reverence to deities by stotras is to be considered as a primary action (pradhāna)  of a soma sacrifice (MmS 2.1.13–29). It should be noted, however, that Kumārila men- tions pāśupata, the representative group of Śaiva renouncers, in a list of the heterodox  sects to be reproached due to their perverse secular motivations. See TV p. 194,10–11:  TV’ pt. 2, p. 112,19–20: sāmkhyayoga-pāñcarātra-pāśupata-śākya- nirgrantha(IO 2151;  Ānandāśrama ed.: grantha)-parigṛhītadharmādharmanibandhanāni. 75 Grammatically, “ardhagrāma” derived from “ardham grāmasya” denotes the half  of the village (samapravibhāge napuṃsakaliṅgaḥ) whereas “grāmārdha” derived from  “grāmasya ardhaḥ” denotes a part of the village (avayavavācī puṃliṅgaḥ). Cf. VMBh pt. 1,  p. 407,2–4 on A 2.2.2. Thus we may take “somārdha” as a part of the moon, that is, the  crescent moon on Śiva’s head. 76 Dharma, which is described by the Vedic injunction (MmS 1.1.2: codanālakṣaṇa), is  said to be the cause of the attainment of bliss. Cf. ŚBh(F) p. 16,6: sa (=dharma) hi niḥśreya- sena puruṣaṃ saṃyunakti; ŚV, Pratijñāsūtra v. 125 ab: jijñāsyaḥ saṃśayād dharmaḥ  śreyaskaratayāpi ca / 77 Sucaritamiśra holds “jñānadeha” as a Dvandva compound whereas Pārthasārathi  does as a Karmadhāraya.

Pārthasārathi’s  interpretation seems to be better because what is coupled with body is soul, rather than  knowledge. 78 In a part (vv. 3198–3210) of the Bṛhaṭṭīkā fragments quoted by Śāntarakṣita in TSg  vv. 3127–3245, Kumārila accepts the omniscience of Brahmā, Viṣṇu and Śiva (v. 3198:  brahmādi; v. 3208: devottamatraya; v. 3209: brahmāditraya). He states that they are  praised as omniscient in itihāsapurāṇas (TSg v. 3198) and they can be omniscient because  they are embodied in the Veda (vedadeha) that consists of omniscience (sarvajñānamaya)  in TSg v. 3207: athāpi vedadehatvād brahmaviṣṇumaheśvarāḥ / sarvajñānamayād vedāt  sarvajñā mānuṣasya kim // See Kawasaki 1992, p. 310.

Among the three gods, Kumārila es- pecially refers to Śaṅkara, i.e., Śiva, who is described as possessing ten imperishable quali- ties (daśāvyaya) such as jñāna, vairāgya and aiśvarya (TSg v. 3205).
