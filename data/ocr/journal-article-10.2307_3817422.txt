<plain_text><page sequence="1">Shelley at Play: A Study of Sketch and Text in his Prometheus Notebooks by Nancy Moore Goslee Shelley's own analogy of developing his finished poems from verbal "sketches" in his notebooks is strikingly confirmed by a glance at the notebooks themselves.1 Page after page of the pocket-sized books con- tains fragmentary lines and scrawled phrases, punctuated by roughly drawn treetops or diagrammatic sailboats. Occasionally these visual sket- ches develop into finished, full page landscapes in the notebooks; more consistently, the verbal lines and phrases develop into stanzas, songs, and-as we move from notebook to notebook-whole poems. The notebooks containing drafts of Prometheus Unbound are particularly fascinating to study because they seem to answer Demogorgon's cryptic words, uttered from his dark abyss, that "the deep truth is imageless." Instead, their pages suggest a version of Prometheus' own prophecy, an act later, that images which are "shapes" as well as "sounds" may be redemptive. The "progeny immortal / Of Painting, Sculpture and rapt Poesy," such images will mediate between human minds and the torch- lit cave Prometheus and Asia withdraw into, so that "veil by veil evil and error fall . . ." (III. iii. 54ff.).2 As Shelley drafts the lyrics for Acts II and IV of Prometheus, the visual sketches that surround his words, or are surrounded by them, seem to have a generative virtue like that "place around" Prometheus' cave (III. iii. 63). Whether meditative counters which stimulate thought, kinetic rituals to keep the ink and his thoughts flowing, direct or symbolic illustrations of thoughts or lines already writ- ten, or illustrations which suggest new symbolic directions for adjacent drafts, Shelley's visual sketches in the Prometheus notebooks show a com- plex, fascinating range of interdependence with the developing verbal texts. Published studies of Shelley's notebooks have made available only a few reproductions of his notebook drawings and a limited sense of the relationship of verbal to visual sketch on the same page. Lawrence Zillman's The Complete Known Drafts of Shelley's "Prometheus Un- bound" draws together almost all notebook material and prints the various drafts of individual passages in order of composition.3 For my purposes 211 Huntington Library Quarterly 48(1985) 210-255</page><page sequence="2">Az~~A HM 2177, 8r (Huntington Library)</page><page sequence="3">212 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY here, his study is valuable less for its occasional references to the sket- ches than for its transcribing and chronological ordering of passages from all extant notebooks. Although both transcription and chronology must include a margin of error, using Zillman as a guide makes possible an analysis of sketches as a further way to test relationships among drafts. Unlike Zillman's, each of the other studies draws upon a more limited group of notebooks. H. Buxton Forman's 1911 description of the three Bixby notebooks which are now at the Huntington reproduces only a few of the sketches, though his descriptions of the texts mention many of the drawings on the pages.4 Because he organizes his discussion by completed poems, he very helpfully surveys all of the Prometheus drafts together; these are in HM 2176 and HM 2177. Yet he gives only passing attention to the interplay of drawing and verbal draft. Furthermore, his procedure entails jumping from page to page, front to reverse order, and notebook to notebook, as Shelley himself did in composing even a single lyric-and Forman's page references to the notebooks are sometimes hard to find. In The Shelley Circle VI Donald H. Reiman reproduces two pages containing Prometheus drafts from the Pforzheimer Philosophical Reform notebook (page 1073), one of which also contains a sketch; on page 1005 he also reproduces the front cover of the notebook, which is a finished sketch of trees, lakes, and mountains, and the front pasted-down end paper, full of profiles and one full face. Also included in the Pforzheimer collection are three leaves torn from HM 2177; Reiman reproduces the two of these which have lines from Act II of Prometheus (page 867), and one of them also includes a sketch.5 For these few passages we can see both oracular words and "the place around." In Shelley at Work, by far the fullest treatment of the relationship be- tween visual and verbal sketches, Neville Rogers traces their interplay in fascinating detail. Several aspects of his stddy require supplementing, however, in order to examine the manuscript matrices for Prometheus. First, he too reproduces only a few sketches, none closely associated with the Prometheus drafts. Second, he works only with the Bodleian notebooks-enormously rich in themselves but excluding the Prometheus material in the Huntington and Pforzheimer notebooks. Third, his thematic approach leads him from draft to fragment, sketch to stanza, poem to poem. His analyses seldom trace the development of a single poem, but concentrate on the ways in which images, themes, and motifs may generate a series of artistic or intellectual manifestations. Fourth, because Rogers begins from Platonic passages in the notebooks, it is understandable that the "Ariadne's thread" of concepts, lines, and im- ages he pursues through the notebooks reveals a Platonic pattern.6 There is, of course, much evidence both inside and outside the notebooks for Shelley's deep interest in Plato, particularly from 1817 on.7 Yet</page><page sequence="4">SHELLEY AT PLAY 213 Rogers' assumptions lead him, I think, into simultaneously overvaluing and undervaluing the relationship of the visual sketches to verbal con- cepts. That is, with a more neoplatonic than Platonic emphasis, he tends to read the visual sketches as consistent signs or symbols for conceptual meanings, thus overvaluing their reliability as signs and undervaluing their flexibility to function as symbols for several different concepts, or even as gestures instead of signs for concepts. This approach also under- values, though in a somewhat different sense, a Platonic, but not neoplatonic, skepticism about the value of art. If much of Shelley's skep- ticism about the stability of sense data came from the empiricists, it was surely reinforced by Plato's use of visual distortion as the decisive analogy for arguing that all art is a distortion of philosophical thought.8 However, any discussion of these notebooks which attempts to organize their wilderness-like complexity by thematic or conceptual patterns will almost necessarily reduce the skeptical play between Shelley's two mutual- ly generative arts. The approach I have taken may also run the risk of overvaluing the visual sketches, because it begins with a direct descrip- tion and grouping of those sketches in the notebooks containing the drafts of Prometheus Unbound. Working from these groupings I have then turn- ed to the individual pages and facing pages, which contain both verbal passages from the play and visual sketches, to see what relationship ex- ists beyond their spatial neighboring. Of the thirteen notebooks examined, seven contain substantial Pro- metheus material: Bod. MSS. Shelley adds. e. 11,12; Shelley e. 1-3; Hun- tington manuscripts (HM, formerly Bixby) 2176 and 2177. The eighth (the Pforzheimer Philosophical Reform notebook) contains only two passages, though the Pforzheimer collection includes a third passage, and the ninth (Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 6) only a line. I have also looked at Bod. MS. Shelley e. 4, which contains a passage related to Prometheus Unbound, II. v, and the facsimile of the British Library Mask of Anar- chy notebook. Further, I have examined the third Shelley notebook at the Huntington, HM 2178 ("Cyprian"), though Shelley apparently did not use it until 1821; and Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 6, another notebook used in 1818-1819 but containing no lines from Prometheus.9 Because of their reiterated patterns it is possible both to venture some hypotheses about the relation of verbal to visual sketch in his composing, and to set up a loose catalog of motifs. This broad survey draws upon all thir- teen notebooks and does not limit its observations only to pages including passages from Prometheus Unbound. A second stage of the analysis is limited to those pages, or to facing pages, in order to examine more closely the interplay of this visual and verbal sketching. From the greater frequency of sketches in the rough-draft as compared to the fair-copy notebooks, and from the evidence of simultaneity in visual</page><page sequence="5">214 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY and verbal sketches in the draft notebooks, it can be argued that these sketches frequently form a part of the drafting process. Because Shelley wrote, revised, and drew both in pencil and in ink, we can sometimes relate drawings to earlier poetic drafts, sometimes to revisions. Moreover, because the drawings appear far more frequently when Shelley drafts poetry than when he drafts prose, they seem associated with the more concentrated rhythms and metaphors of poetry. Their frequency seems higher still in the lyrical than in the dramatic poetry; on the other hand, since the surviving notebooks contain more material from Acts II and IV than from the more dramatic I and III, it is possible to weight this point too heavily. One might of course argue that prose drafts-or even blank verse drafts-leave less white space on the notebook page for sket- ching; but more often than not the white space seems deliberately created for the sketch. Evaluated at the simplest level, these drawings keep the ink flowing as the poet works out lines in his head. The process of draw- ing is a kinetic action which parallels the impulses and pulses of the poetry. At the same time, as actual writing stops, the creation of a space and a spatial drawing accompanies "temporal" but mental exploration of rhyme, rhythm, and meter. These temporal and musical qualities of the verse are also of course formal qualities which shape and limit the fiery coal of inspiration and which lead, to use the language of the later Defence, both to its later fading and to its becoming known. Yet though many of the sketches may have begun as kinetic gestures, empty of conscious' content, the mutual respect between drawing space and text space sug- gests that at some point in this process Shelley becomes conscious of these drawings and their relationship to text. He would be confronted by the differences between his two arts and the senses they are most closely associated with: "the temples high/ Of man's ear &amp; eye." Though more marked by opposition and contrast, the interplay of his two modes of sketching on the page resembles the synaesthesia which permeates his verbal texts. If they show an interplay of senses, however, they also reflect an interplay or tension between sense-perception and sense as significance. More specifically, from the examples of drawings which both mirror and prompt verbal revisions, Shelley must also have become conscious of the sketches as motifs which reveal symbolic content. This significance, like the processes which create it, seems to explore the polarities of energy and regeneration on the one hand, and formal or legislative limit on the other. In this group of thirteen notebooks, four main clusters of subjects il- lustrate these polarities. The first of these, versions of landscape, moves from a simple scrawled treetop through single trees, some abstract and some naturalistically sketched, to trees along a foreground line, to fully finished sketches of trees, lakes, and distanced mountains (see fig. 1).</page><page sequence="6">SH EL L EY A T P L AY 215 -7^4~ ~ ~~~~~~. .1 0 ^ %,' VA pt. i i ( &gt; 0-t'7 Fi.1*H_17,*9 (Hningo Libary</page><page sequence="7">216 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Fig. 2: VM 2177, 16r (Huntington Library)</page><page sequence="8">SHELLEY AT PLAY 217 ifn i'N O~~~~~~ f-O N. *: Fig. 3: HM 2177, *ix(a) (Huntington Library)</page><page sequence="9">218 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY t0::~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ M~~~~~~~~~~ Fig. 4: HM 2176, *33v (Huntington Library)</page><page sequence="10">SHELLEY AT PLAY 219 This cluster forms by far the largest group of sketches. Linked to this group by the lake is a cluster of boat sketches, many of realistic sailing sloops, some of Henry Reveley's paddle boat,10 and several more vi- sionary sketches of crescent-moon hulls bearing an orb-sun, or full moon, or the pupil of an eye (see fig. 2). These in turn often merge, on the same page, into one subdivision of Shelley's fragmentary, but recurrent, representations of the human figure: haunting eyes that stare directly out of the notebooks. His most frequent representation of the human form is a leftward-facing, linear profile-usually of the face alone, not the en- tire head (see fig. 3). Only in tiny, distanced sketches of boatmen or gon- doliers does he represent the entire human figure; in one case he careful- ly draws a pair of legs at the edge of the page-the rest of the body has evidently already escaped. A fourth broad category includes architec- tural sketches, though these are scarcer and less finished, even if they are sometimes as large as the landscapes (see fig. 4). Other designs fit none of these categories and occur only once or twice. The style of the drawings varies from diagrammatic and abstract outline scrawls to the realistic shading and compositional perspectives of con- ventional landscapists: his finished landscape sketches follow, not un- skilfully, the tradition of Claude, Ruysdael, and Gainsborough-and thus also the countless picturesque sketchers such as Gilpin who converted the language of foreground, frame or screen, middle ground, and background into a formulaic chant."1 Shelley's landscape sketches tend to separate fairly consistently into these three planes, with a lake form- ing an indeterminate middle zone and the darker, continuous curved outlines and diagonally sketched-in masses of the trees in the foreground forming a frame and parallel plane with the viewer. We are not drawn in by a diagonal, as in a Gainsborough sketch, but stand still and look through the trees into the far distance. Yet the effect of framing is far less strong than in the letters describing Italian scenes which he writes to Peacock. Also, because of the framing function of the notebooks' pages, he does not follow the letters' pattern of a circular focussing and a radiating series of outward views. Picturesque cottages, castles, or temples rarely intrude as closer objects of attention though, as Rogers notes, islands in these middle-distance lakes serve a similar function (114). The less com- plete natural landscapes limit themselves to this front plane, although Shelley often sketches treetops or bushes along a high ground line, so that we look up as if to a ridge. In general, the rougher the sketch, the firmer and more continuous is the "bounding line" so passionately cham- pioned by Blake. Shelley's "finishing," his polishing of rougher sketches, uses a series of short strokes to provide shading and detail-a technique analogous to that of his multiple similes for single, indescribable objects. Short, rather tentative strokes also characterize his boats and architec-</page><page sequence="11">220 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY tural sketches, and even the moon-boats. In contrast, the profiles are each usually a single strong, curved stroke; they look as if meant to illustrate Lavater's discussions of physiognomy as a basis for expression.'2 Yet to some extent these differences in style may derive from his drawing tool as much as from his subject; almost all the profiles and many of the diagrammatic trees are in ink, the more feathery landscapes usually in pencil or else begun in pencil. Out of this realistic, if conventional, style of the larger landscapes (larger only relatively, since the notebooks are approximately 4" x 5") rises the question of whether Shelley is describing a particular place or places. The trees (in their full shapes like oaks) seem English or north Italian; and the lake scenes look sometimes, with their craggy mountain backdrops, like the English Lake District. Even more though they suggest the Italian lakes with the rockier Dolomites behind them. One scene at least includes both an Italian-looking church and a classical ruin (Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 6, page 121). Yet this speculation about specific location raises again the original question: are all of these sketches mimetic-and if so, of what sort of reality? Several of the faintly drawn townscapes look, with their bridges and towers, like Florence or Venice; and a few arched buildings look something like square coliseums, a suggestion reinforced by a position close to the prose "Colosseum" fragment (in Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12, between 201-187). This question emerges dramatically in a landscape such as the one in Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 11, page 65 (fig. 5), in the midst of Julian and Maddalo drafts. Here we see a naturalistic wooded ravine, with pyramids set into the woods, and eyes which, though floating above, are still set into the composition. Another composition, which is less jolting because its style is less realistic, shows a small cres- cent boat bearing a globe. It sails through abstract, undefined space, in a single pictorial plane, toward a stylized mountain, above which hangs a star-a foreshadowing of Adonais (HM 2177, lr, fig. 6, at top of page)." In his discussion of several similar landscapes, Rogers shows how the visionary scenes that seem drawn from the symbolic landscapes of "Kubla Khan" move into Shelley's poetry of symbolic voyages from Alastor to Epipsychidion to Adonais (91ff., 113ff.). Given the obvious mythic, emblematic, or visionary qualities of these landscapes, so well mapped by Rogers, it seems petty to ask about exact earthly cor- respondences. Yet because their repetition begins to suggest an underly- ing psychological pattern (a use of these sketches almost as meditative beads or counters) it also seems too externally programmatic to suggest they they correspond exactly to Platonic concepts. There seem, then, at least three different ways to interpret these draw- ings. First, they may directly imitate this world, or this world as describ- ed in the poetry. Second, they may be more symbolically imitative of</page><page sequence="12">SHELLEY AT PLAY 221 ' ~~~~~~~~~~' /t ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ Fig. 5: od MS S elly d 1,pd, Fig. 5: Bod. MS.

Third, they may be non- mimetic reiterated expressions of some psychological force. In some sket- ches, of course, all of these levels of emphasis may operate at once. Of the larger, more finished landscapes, only the two I have cited above con- tain explicitly antinaturalistic elements. Yet many smaller, more diagram- matic drawings are explicitly symbolic, even emblematic. In exception to most of the drawings is the cluster of sketches that metamorphose, even in adjoining scrawls, from crescent moons to diagrammatic boats to boats containing eggs or eyes. This probably reflects two strands of a mythological and emblematic tradition which attemp- ted to synthesize the lore of Egypt and that of other ancient Mediterra- nean and eastern cultures. With only limited historical accuracy, the Florentine neoplatonists traced the first of these two strands back to Egyp- tian hieroglyphics. Thought to be the knowledge of Hermes and also the signs of a transcendent order, these symbolic pictures which were also words continued to influence hermetic societies, both speculative and political, through the eighteenth century. Rosicrucians, Masons, and political revolutionaries adopted these symbols for their often different purposes.14 The second strand was a more recent syncretism stimulated both by eighteenth-century archaeology and by its religious speculations. Stuart Curran has already shown the influence of speculative mythographers such as Jacob Bryant, Edward Moor, and George Stanley Faber on the poetic text of Prometheus Unbound;`5 a similar influence appears in this group of Shelley's drawings. Although the Alexandrian conquest of Egypt seems to have marked the end of the Egyptian use of hieroglyphs, they experienced a renaissance when a fourth-century A.D. Greek text attributed to an otherwise unknown Horapollo was discovered on Andros and taken to Florence in 1419. In George Boas' modern translation, Horapollo's second entry described the hieroglyph of the uroboros as a symbol for "the universe."" Shelley does not sketch this symbol, though of course he uses it with great complexity in his verbal text, nor does anything else in Horapollo directly bear upon his sketches. Both Boas' notes and Renaissance manuals of hieroglyphics however trace the growth of the tradition to include other emblems or hieroglyphs. Although Horapollo mentions eyes only briefly, the eye was an obvious hieroglyph on actual Egyptian temples and obelisks; its interpretations, from classical to Renaissance to Romantic writers, however, were remarkably varied.17 Valeriano's Hieroglyphica, an important transmitter of the Horapollo- nian tradition for the neoplatonists, explains a gradation of emblematic interpretations for another element in some of Shelley's less simply</page><page sequence="15">224 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY naturalistic sketches, those of the pyramid. In Valeriano's print, the pyramid has apparently outlasted two broken classical buildings that flank it; on its side is a flaming tripod and possibly an uroboros. Its Latin text offers three successive interpretations for the pyramid; the material ex- istence of natural things, the soul of man, and fire.18 As Ronald Paulson notes in Emblem and Expression, this range of interpretation continued to be employed in the eighteenth-century English garden."9 If the first strand of this Egyptian syncretism sought through hieroglyphs to prove that the things of this world are symbols of a transcendent neoplatonic order, the second attempted to trace biblical and other myths to a common source. Though none of these mythographers agreed com- pletely on that source, the ones considered here all attempted to base their claims on scientific or historical data. In his Oedipus Judaicus, William Drummond argued that the Old Testament, particularly Genesis, should be interpreted through a knowledge of astronomy and particularly of the Egyptian zodiac. In this book, which Shelley had read by early 1813, Drummond's illustrations of zodiacs excavated by earlier Egyptologists include a winged amphisbaena, a winged solar disc, and a number of Isis figures crowned with crescent moons. Drummond's text also includes references to several of the emblems sketched by Shelley. Interpreting the hieroglyph of an eye, he follows Plutarch more than the Horapollo- nian and Renaissance tradition, though he claims he is following both. He also refers in his text to an uroboros.Y Both Jacob Bryant and George Stanley Faber base their comparative mythology on the story of Noah, and Faber especially relates that story of symbolic death and rebirth to images and myths of fertility. Because the uroboros is both a phallic serpent and a circle, he argues in The Origins of Pagan Idolatry (1816) that it symbolizes Noah's life, "marked by a great renovating time and by the commencement of a new mundane period." It also, he argues, symbolizes the "hermaphroditic great father."'2' His interpretation of the pyramids is similarly phallic (3: fron- tispiece, xxvii, 118, 202, 207), and thus rather different from the transcen- dent impulse of the metaphysical emblem tradition. While both emblematic serpents, amphisbaena and uroboros, appear in Shelley's text of Prometheus Unbound, it is the Isis-figure in Drum- mond, in Bryant, and in Faber which seems the fertile source of many of Shelley's more diagrammatic visual sketches. In his New System . . . of Antient Mythology, Bryant shows how, even in Egyptian myth and ritual alone, the crescent moon of the fertility goddess Isis also becomes the floating chest in which Typhon imprisons Osiris and the papyrus boat in which she searches for the fragments of his body.22 To these myths, reenacted in ritual processions, Bryant connects Noah's ark, the worship of Demeter at Eleusis (3:37), and also the "Orphic egg" (3: 160). In his</page><page sequence="16">SHELLEY AT PLAY 225 Origin of Pagan Idolatry, Faber also relates Isis to the moon, to the fer- tile earth, and to the birth of the hero from an ark.23 Although it is less closely associated with his Noachic thesis, Bryant, like Drummond, il- lustrates an image of a winged sun which he associates with Zoroaster (Curran reproduces this plate on page 72; and see fig. 13 later). This winged solar disc, sometimes flanked by serpents, also appears on almost every Egyptian temple portal illustrated in Norden's Antiquities . . . of Egypt, Nubia, and Thebes, one of numerous factual reports of travelers during the eighteenth and early nineteenth centuries. The disc represents Horus, the sun-god who is also a falcon.24 Another source for Shelley's sketches, like Drummond's Oedipus Judaicus a proponent of the astronomical origin of all mythologies, is Volney's Ruins. In the course of his demythologizing, Volney becomes a syncretist, citing earlier mythographers' symbolic equations of the "or- phic Egg" with the sun, and "a great round serpent (representing the heavens . . . ) devouring his tail, that is, folding and unfolding himself eternally, like the revolutions of the spheres."25 Speculating that "all cir- cular [things represent] the world," he also goes on to identify semicir- cular images, such as the boat Argo, with the moon. "Fire and the gods of Olympus," he explains, "they represent by pyramids and obelisks." A plate from Athanasius Kircher's Oedipus Aegypticus (Rome, 1653) shows an obelisk designed for a Renaissance patron, on the pyramidal top segment of which is an eye, perhaps representing justice (Iverson, The Myth of Egypt, pl. XIX). It is just such obelisks, however, that Volney sees as emblems of unjust, exploitative rulers and conquerors, that he attacks in the first part of his Ruins, and that will molder forgotten once Prometheus is freed in Act III of Shelley's play. It thus seems clear that some of Shelley's visual sketches, particularly those I describe as visionary, draw upon a symbolic vocabulary of great antiquity and great, though often contradictory, significance. The tendency of both the hermetic, neoplatonic tradition deriving from Horapollo and that of each of the mythographers discussed here was to reduce much richness of meaning to a single scheme. Yet it also seems clear, as Cur- ran and Hartley have shown, that Shelley uses such symbolism eclec- tically and skeptically in his poetry. A similar wide-ranging flexibility seems likely in his visual sketches, as if the poet's eye, suddenly become aware of what the idling hand has drawn, may reawaken an ancient emblem to fresh meaning. Because these two strands of an "Egyptian" tradition suggest such a wide range of meaning, and because so many of the other sketches rein- force some of their suggestions for the regeneration of this world, they also call for a revision of Rogers' emphasis upon a Platonic interpreta- tion of the sketches, at least as far as Prometheus Unbound is concern-</page><page sequence="17">226 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY ed. If the sketches from these notebooks in which Shelley composes Pro- metheus show a relatively naturalistic basis-and this is all the more strik- ing since most of the drafts are of the more "metaphysical" Acts II and IV, as Reiman calls them-then how are they related to the generation of the text, and to its significance? The simplest way to begin answering this question is to test the broad hypothesis that these drawings in some way illustrate the verbal texts that share their pages. Because of the enor- mous problem of reading the texts, I have limited analysis of the non- Prometheus pages in these notebooks to a few examples in which some sort of illustration is obvious, without searching for a more complete pat- tern or assessment. With the help of Lawrence Zillman's, H. Buxton For- man's, and Donald Reiman's transcriptions, a more complex analysis of the matrix of Prometheus Unbound sketches, both verbal and visual, is possible. One cluster of more or less illustrative sketches occurs in the drafts of Julian and Maddalo, included in Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 11.26 An unusually stark though still leafy tree suggests the bleak landscape of the poem's opening, though it is not quite a "bare stake" or "one sharp tree," since several with fuller foliage appear at the top of the page (page 62). A small round sun on page 66 seems to suggest, though with far less glory than the lines themselves, the sunset to which the two speakers respond so differently. Several pages later, still in the context of Julian and Mad- dalo, Shelley apparently began to sketch a sailboat and then worked over it to convert it into a gondola (page 79). On the other hand, in the midst of these down-to-earth illustrations is the landscape of the more visionary type described above: trees in a ravine, with a pyramid carefully set in the scene and shaded, and three pairs of eyes-one pair staring fiercely out, one pair looking hypnotic or meditative, and one in the middle, buried in a tree but inked in so darkly that it emerges as one stares at the sketch (see fig. 5). The lines above it on page 65 go up to 1. 30 of Julian and Maddalo, then skip to 1. 65 and through at least 1. 87 (numbers from Reiman text). Two descriptions in these lines interchange architectural and natural images: the Euganean hills, "which bear / As seen from Lido through the harbour piles / The likeness of a clump of peaked isles," and the city on whose isles "temples and . . . palaces did seem / Like fabrics of enchantment piled to Heaven." Yet neither of these fully accounts for the drawing. We might speculate, given the opposing views of human nature Shelley goes on to develop in the poem, that the fierce, frowning eyes represent a more Byronic spirit, the meditative ones Shelley's own, and that the eyes in the tree and the pyramid must choose, to escape a Rousseau-like metamorphosis into a stump. The eyes in the tree and the pyramid in the ravine may somehow represent the problems of relating art and consciousness to natural process. This is clearly no direct illustra-</page><page sequence="18">SHELLEY AT PLAY 227 tion. Yet in these notebooks its visionary stance is the exception rather than the rule. A repeated image, that of the fiercely arrogant, linear profile, looks at first like an illustration to The Cenci. Censorious and threatening, these profiles appear in greatest number in HM 2177, in which Shelley begins his abstract of the Cenci history and thus his work on the play. Some of them look a little like Godwin; others look sinister enough to be car- toon images of Count Cenci himself. This may well be so; yet the pro- files also appear in other contexts. Pencil versions appear under the ink draft of Shelley's Ion translation in Bod. MS. Shelley e. 1, the notebook in which his fair copy of Prometheus also begins (for example, on pages 37-41). Because Shelley seems to have kept the right-hand pages of these fair-copy notebooks for corrections and for sketches made as he proofread in pencil, this pattern confirms that the Ion translation was indeed later27 and that the profiles were probably drawn as he proofread his analysis of tyranny in Act I of Prometheus. The profiles are not all equally menacing, however, since the first one, on page 37, shows an attractive woman wearing her curly hair in a kind of Greek topknot. Probably less coincidentally, clusters of these profiles also appear on the covers of the Pforzheimer notebook, which contains the long draft of Shelley's prose answer to tyranny, A Philosophical View of Reform. On a page of HM 2177 (*21r) a similar verbal theme of tyranny from a stanza of The Mask of Anarchy may have prompted three or four profiles; since some lines from Prometheus appear on the same page, these will be discussed in more detail below. ii In the context of the Prometheus drafts themselves-that is, in the sket- ches on the same pages as these drafts, or on facing pages-the variety of visual sketches is more limited than in the notebooks as a whole. Not only are there no large landscape sketches with visionary elements; there are no larger landscape sketches at all, unless we include the covers and end papers of the notebooks as available for any verbal context within them. The drafts do contain many smaller, more fragmentary sketches of landscape or of trees; sketches of boats ranging from realistic sloops to visionary moon-boats; additional profiles; a variety of vaguely subar- chitectural diagrams; and a few drawings less readily categorized. This relative visual poverty, in comparison to material elsewhere in these notebooks and the sketches Rogers represents and discusses from still other notebooks, appears to confirm the nonvisual qualities of Prometheus- or, rather, to confirm the nonlinear, nonsketchable Turneresque qualities of light, color, and rapid motion which, though present in his other works,</page><page sequence="19">228 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY are particularly evident in Prometheus.28 It also tends to confirm the lack of stability in his verbal vocabulary of "shape" and "form," since no human figures appear. Even the rather concrete elements of architec- ture and landscape, what we might call the stage scenery, are almost totally unrepresented in these pages, yet drawings in other notebooks show the way he reworks certain symbolic settings again and again. Shelley sket- ches no temples, obelisks, or triumphal arches, the cultural furniture of Jupiter's reign as described in Act III, nor, on the other hand, does he sketch the positive counterimage of well or lake, temple or cave. Because these notebooks are drafts and not fully-intentional, completed works of art like Blake's illuminated books, this argument about what is not illustrated in sketches is inconclusive. Yet its inconclusiveness shows that Shelley follows no simple policy of illustrating the shallow truth with images. In fact, the positive evidence of these sketches suggests that even the deep truth is not wholly imageless. One end paper sketch seems to show a clear physical association with Prometheus, though its chronological relationship would be difficult to determine. On a back end paper of Bod. MS. Shelley e. 3, the third of the fair-copy notebooks, and opposite a draft of the preface, is a full-page sketch of a lake with distant Alpine mountains. Midway in the lake is a small, shrub-crowned and vertically- sided island, with a large cave mouth. Toward it sail several boats; large boulders, instead of the usual trees or bushes, mark the foreground plane of the shore, but a break in the boulders opens toward the island and cave. Though the scene does not illustrate exactly the configuration of spring, temple, and cave in Act III, it does suggest the cave as a source of creativity or vision-even, in its basaltic look, a source of power like Demogorgon's cave. The facing passage from the preface bears on this, as it debates the relationship of originality and influence among contem- porary poets; and this notebook includes the fair copy of Act III, with its two descriptions of caves. Such an interpretation draws upon a natural landscape without overt visionary elements and reads it as enclosing the source of vision. The "reading" thus comes from the verbal text, though the compositional domination of that islanded cave is almost haunting enough on its own merits to suggest such ideas: the island not only focuses the scene, but overwhelms everything in it with almost centripetal force. Of the forty to fifty smaller sketches, roughly twenty-seven appear to illustrate directly, or illuminate more symbolically the neighboring texts from Prometheus. Increasing the difficulty of this analysis is the fact that illustrative and nonillustrative sketches share many of the same repeated motifs. Thus one possibility we cannot fully dismiss is that random meditative repetitions of Shelley's favorite motifs occasionally coincide with the text. A more detailed look at the interplay between sketch and</page><page sequence="20">SHELLEY AT PLAY 229 verbal context suggests that the sketches are sometimes consciously chosen and sometimes almost subconsciously kinetic or meditative. Frequently, however, sketches which may begin meditatively and randomly begin to generate their own verbal context. Analyzing the relationship between each sketch and its content would probably be to lose the forest for the trees; examining the context of these recurrent visual motifs offers a more focused pattern. In fact, individual trees or fragmentary landscapes are the most recur- rent motif; and the little rounded treetop scrawls suggest by their simplicity and frequency a highly meditative or kinetic element. A tiny treetop in HM 2177, 6v, accompanies a draft of the lyric, "To the deep, to the deep. ... No actual reference to trees or woods occurs in the passage, and it is tempting to read the treetop as a cloud, tying it to "the cloudy strife / Of death and of Life" on 6r, except that such scrawls are also part of the usual building blocks for Shelley's trees. The Pforzheimer pages torn from HM 2177 between pages 6 and 7 also show tree sketches, with the lines from the Prometheus draft written right across them and develop- ing no organic imagery from them (Shelley Circle VI, 867). Other ex- amples of tree sketches with no apparent relationship to the text occur in Bod. MS. Shelley e. 1, pages 20, 23; Bod. MS. Shelley e. 2, pages 8, 9v, and 26; Bod. MS. Shelley e. 12, page 95, which also contains unused lines Zillman sees as preceding IV. 117-122 (57); and Bod. MS. Shelley e. 12, pages 96, 98. Several other tree sketches, all linked to drafts of Earth's dialogue with the moon in HM 2176, also seem connected by the fact that Earth is speaking to celebrate its regeneration (on *19v, *18r, and *22r). Accompanying several passages physically and textually close to these in HM 2176, and textually close in Bod. MS. Shelley e. 12, tree sketches are more obviously illustrative. In HM 2176, *20r, the page facing *19v, a small rounded clump of low trees, seen from below, fills in a corner in the same ink as the draft of Earth's speech. Though destructively apocalyptic in most of its images, the speech includes the regenerative phrases "green &amp; azure Universe" and also the more metaphorical references to trees in "[My Oceans] / [The wildemesses of] . . . the abysses / Of the deep Air's unmeased [sic] wildernesses" (Z, 77). On HM 2176, sea like *21r, a second draft develops the image: "My [mighty] forests . . . every blade and blossom," and is illustrated by ink tree sketches on the top of the page. In Bod. MS. Shelley e. 12, page 53, a final draft of these lines (now 11. 347ff. in Reiman's edition) surrounds a pencil tree apparently already on the page, since the lines make room for it. A completed illustrative interplay of text and sketch emerges on *18v and *19r (HM 2176), as Shelley drafts and redrafts lines 370-381 (fig.</page><page sequence="21">230 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY 7). In pencil at the bottom of *19r is the apparent first draft of 11. 370-375: It interpenetrates my granite mass tangled trodden [And] through hard roots &amp; lifeless clay doth pass Into the utmost leaves &amp; delicatest flowers Upon the winds, among the clouds tis spread It gives a life to the forgotten dead They breathe a spirit up from their obscurest bowers (Z, 83) Just above these lines is a spiky tree which indeed serves as a tiny emblem for these lines that seem midway between Milton and Dylan Thomas. The sketch however is in ink and was evidently drawn as Shelley revis- ed, in ink, lines 376-381 at the top of the page. Those lines, though they develop the same "interpenetrating" regenerative power, use more violent storm and volcano images to show the explosive, accelerated psychological regeneration of the "forgotten dead" in their once obscure bowers; and they seem to follow the ink draft of the similarly volcanic lines 319-327 on the facing page (*18v). Yet because the last ink line of the passage at the top of *19r is corrected in pencil, Shelley must have been rereading these earlier ink lines and seeing the ink-drawn tree as he recast the earlier part of the stanza. We can thus see this unusual spiky, almost explosive tree as a visual image which not only suggests the organic impulses of lines 370*-375, but also links the two patterns of verbal images, volcanic and organic. A similar but less complex example occurs on Bod. MS. Shelley e.12, 100 (see Z, 63-64 for text). As there are fewer remaining drafts of Act IL than of Act IV, so there are fewer sketches. Among these drafts of Act II, however, sketches of trees appear to illustrate the forests through which Asia and Panthea are to travel, as in Bod. MS. Shelley e. 11, pages 110, 112-113, illustrating drafts of II.i. 162-205 (Z, 18-22) and in Bod. MS. Shelley e. 12, pages 33 (overlapping the pencil draft of II.ii.5-23), and 43-44. Still another sketch, a more complete landscape on the first page (1) of the fair-copy notebook Bod. MS. Shelley e. 2, illustrates the concrete vehicle of a metaphor which seems like a fragmentary draft of Asia's song at the end of Act II. Shelley adds a fuller version of that song on Bod. MS. Shelley e. 3, pages 11-12, apparently copying it from HM 2176, *26r and *25v, on to the blank right-hand pages he usually left open, in the fair-copy books, for such additions. On Bod. MS. Shelley e. 2, page 1, also a recto page, the preliminary lines are: "Down through the lampless deep of song/ I am drawn and driven along." Above the lines are two ink treetops. Sketched below these lines and occupying about two-thirds</page><page sequence="22">SHELLEY AT PLAY 231 9 ' ~~~&lt;'' '%'X. ,YJ, *~~~~~~~~~~~~Ar~~~ ~~~~~~* Fig. 7: HM 2176, *18v and *19r (Huntington Library)</page><page sequence="23">232 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY - 44 ~~~v4~~~~ .. . 1* Fig. 8: HM 2176, 15r (Huntington Library)</page><page sequence="24">SHELLEY AT PLAY 233 of the page is a steep hillside almost like a rainbow's arc, with a droop- ing penciled tree and a series of inked trees growing down along the slope of this ravine. If not quite a "lampless deep," this ravine suggests the im- pulse toward descent which shapes most of the second act. One of the few drafts of Act III also shows this interplay between tree sketch and growing text: at the top of Bod. MS. Shelley e. 11, page 49, a pencil sketch shows trees set on a flat ground-plane, with yucca-like clumps of spiky grass in the foreground. Running right across pages 48*49, the long blank verse lines come from the final speech in Act III (iv. 190-199). Written in pencil they seem to cover an earlier ink draft of "Wine of the Fairies" on page 49 (Z, 43). Because this ink draft men- tions "hyacinth buds" and "summer earth," the original, rough tree sketch, which seems to be in ink, probably arose from it. Shelley seems to have added the ground line and the yucca clumps in pencil as he turned to complete his speech for the Spirit of the Hour. The connection of sketch to that speech can thus be explained as accidental, and the speech itself has none of the organic "green fuse" imagery which characterizes many of the verbal contexts for these tree drawings. Instead, the lines univer- salize and conceptualize the fall of Jupiter: "The painted veil, by those who were called life, / Which mimicked, as with colours idly spread / All men believed or hoped was torn aside / The loathsome mask had fallen...." On the face of it these lines have nothing to do with man's natural existence and everything to do with his structure of social and communal beliefs. Yet its Platonic imagery has led earlier critics to argue that Jupiter embodied the false, Urizenic limitations of both natural and conceptual worlds. Thus the tree sketch would suggest the "life" of this world, now rejected or cast off-the "painted veil" of Maya, to use the eastern terms Nietzsche later uses. However, as the sketches and their verbal context for Acts II and IV suggest, the organic natural world seems valuable both in itself and as a means of regeneration, and the tree sketch would become more symbolically illustrative of the renewal-the redefined life-behind the mask. The relationship of sketch to text thus poses, in a more precise way than before, the problem of Jupiter's meaning. Two other draft passages and their accompanying sketches give fur- ther insight into possible links between Shelley's tree sketches and his symbolic interpretation of landscape. First, in a draft of the preface (Bod. MS. Shelley e. 11, pages 59-60), Shelley argues that after Prometheus' "sufferings and endurance" any reconciliation with Jupiter would be fee- ble. On the bottom half of page 59, he sketches an oak tree on a precipice, flanked by the diagonally-written phrases, "do not speak" and "like a death." Both the phrases and the position of the tree suggest Prometheus' position as stoic, resisting sufferer. The tree endures, even flourishes, on the crag. Further, a similar sketch in the fair-copy notebook Bod. MS.</page><page sequence="25">234 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Shelley e. 2, page 10, may also recall Prometheus' mountain torture, as it is sketched in pencil opposite the final fury's exit line in Act I, when Prometheus calmly converts its torture to a humanizing though painful education. Second, as noted earlier, the tree sketches on *18r in HM 2176 are thematically related to the lines on the page, as the spirit of Earth an- nounces regeneration. Yet the draft also includes lines, later omitted, which may well point toward a way to interpret those larger sketches, scattered through the notebooks, which use mountains as a background-for ex- ample, the one on 15r in the same notebook (see fig. 8). Lines 376-381, the second stanza of Earth's joyous lyric, included in this earlier draft a less abstract and more grounded version in which love, un secret caves of mans imagined being Out of the [caverns of the caves of thought] [It] With earthquake shock &amp; swiftness making shiver Thoughts stagnant chaos unremoved forever The base chaos [Thoughts craglike bases] base, immoveable forever The [worlds deep base] (Z, 83) Love, then, reforms and recasts the "craglike bases" of the intellect, the tenor of Shelley's metaphor; does love also recast the craglike bases of what we perceive as the external world, the vehicle of that figure? As the final version of the next stanza suggests, both seem possible for "Man, who was a many-sided mirror / Which could distort to many a shape of error / This true fair world of things-." Thoughts which had seemed "immoveable forever," as immovable as our sense of an objective, in- flexible, external world, are now revealed as only provisional, and ab- solute belief in them revealed as "error." In these verbal sketches for the preface and for the draft lines from Act IV, the crag opposes the force of regenerative love. Yet in the fully scenic landscape sketches of moun- tains seen across lakes, they seem more positive, as images of transcendence. That positive visual image may have caused Shelley to turn toward the abstract and more clearly negative image of "thoughts stagnant chaos;' as he revises the passage in Act IV. Yet the ambiguity of crag or mountain even as images of transcendence remains in Pro-</page><page sequence="26">SHELLEY AT PLAY 235 .-'- :o~~~~~~~.a .4 0 XA ~~~~~~ 'ra? - t ak.*24,&lt;, I~~~~W z t? at *'~v '%S'' t At Fi ct Fig. 9: Bod.

Though these profiles appear far less frequently than trees and landscapes, a maze of connections links them to other visual motifs. The most explicitly Jupiter-like of these profiles appears in Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 11, page 51, linked to a draft of III.iv 172-179 (Z, 42): "Of those who were their conquerors crumbling round/ [And] Which once to priests &amp; kings imaged forth [a[n] sunless power]" (see fig. 9). Of several ink pro- files on the page, four are finished in detail and sport sets of Napoleonic bangs, suggesting a specific political interpretation of those idols dis- carded at Prometheus' unbinding. Several pages earlier in the same notebook, however, a very different sketch illustrates an earlier draft of the same passage (Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 11, page 47, see fig. 10). One might categorize it as a visionary landscape, or perhaps only as a landscape with an abstract diagram near it on the page: a very rough pencil sketch of trees on a hillside, and above them what looks like a sun enclosing an acorn. The lines of poetry are also in very rough pencil. Is that peculiar sun in eclipse, and thus a "a sunless power, a dark year mighty faith"? If the landscape illustrates Shelley's alternate is the world phrases, 'A ruin wide as [where man] dwells" (Z, 42), it thus points toward an extension of the definition of Jupiter to that entire world- a world of trees as well as temples. A cluster of faces less easy to relate to verbal context occurs in Bod. MS. Shelley e. 12, pages 27-28. There threatening profiles appear with more tranquil full-face sketches, one of a woman. Moreover, they are in pencil, and the lines from Prometheus II. ii. 14-23 below them are in ink, though with pencil emendations.29 On the most fully-drawn fron- tal face, that of a woman, a group of ink lines radiates from the mouth, as if a seamstress holds a batch of pins. Though the sketch is hardly ade- quate to the passage, one might speculate that the lines radiating from the face are a kind of animate starlight, "beams of golden light / Which stream in lines that ne'er unite" (Z, 26), which guide Asia's descent.0 Another cluster of profiles, in HM 2177, shows how these sketches act as bridges from one draft to another, or even from one work to another. This Huntington notebook contains recurrent clusters of profiles, with</page><page sequence="29">238 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY particularly dense clusters on both end papers (see fig. 3). As Shelley reverses the notebook to begin working on The Cenci (*indicates page numbering in reverse), many of these profiles may be associated with the central tyrant of that play. The original front cover and end paper (Ixa, lr) also contain profiles, including one heavy-featured military type, but also some faceless visionary eyes and some diagrammatic boats which seem to develop from the eyes or from a moon-chariot. Only one passage from Prometheus is found on a page (*21r, see fig. 11) with these sket- ches of profiles, and those profiles appear to have been drawn at the time Shelley was drafting a stanza of The Mask of Anarchy, since they are in the same ink and follow the same direction; the lines from Prometheus are written with notebook reversed and are thus upside-down as the pro- files and Anarchy lines are right side up. All are in ink, however, and both passages of poetry seem written with a similar pen-point. The pro- files look slightly heavier, but he may have been drawing just after dip- ping or filling the pen. On the facing page (*20v) is a large profile in pen- cil, again drawn in the Anarchy or * direction, and several ink paddle wheels. On *21v is a full-page profile, originally sketched in pencil but gone over in ink, of a fierce armed knight; the profile under his circular segmented helmet seems of the same menacing family as the others. Both texts, too, have possible links to the profiles. The lines from the Mask are spoken by Hope: "Men of England-Sons of Glory / Heroes of un- written story/ Nurslings of one Mighty Mother/ Hopes of her &amp; one another/ Rise like" (my transcription). These profiles might indeed be the men of England, since the one on the right, with fully sketched eye and hair, looks less menacing tian usual; but the other three look more like the tyrants who must be overthrown. The lines from Prometheus are an early draft of Earth's lines from IV. 397-399: "Yon sun, who rules gaze as with a tyrants frown/ The unquiet republic of the spheres/ Of ever wandering Planets/ comets are his/ ministers." According to Zillman (88), the draft of these three lines in the Pforzheimer notebook (139v, published in Shelley Circle VI, page 1073) is a first draft, and it also contains the "tyrant gaze." The front pasted-down end paper of the Pforzheimer notebook, as already mentioned, is covered with such profiles. Thus the page we are now considering (HM 2177, *21r), with its tyrant-like pro- files, did not actually prompt the verbal image of the tyrant's gaze in the Prometheus passage. The profiles may well have prompted the tem- porary elaboration of the image, however, as Shelley experiments with "frown" and with the added phrase about the comets as ministers. To test the thesis that these profiles suggest tyranny, we may turn in three possible directions: back to preceding pages of profile sketches and prose notes in HM 2177, forward to later drafts of Earth's lines in this</page><page sequence="30">SHELLEY AT PLAY 239 4 1, Fig. 11: HM 2177, *21r (Huntington Library)</page><page sequence="31">240 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY ~~~~o 0_ Fig. 12: Bod.

All of these point out the difficulties in reading these sketches as simplistic allegorical counters, but I will consider here only the latter two. In the full stanza from Earth's speech of which lines 397-399 were drafted on *21r, "tyranny" is converted into a happily ironic echo of Jupiter's cast-off role: Man, oh, not men! a chain of linked thought, Of love and might to be divided not, Compelling the elements with adamantine stress- As the Sun rules, even with a tyrant's gaze, The unquiet Republic of the maze Of Planets, struggling fierce towards Heaven's free wilderness. (1820 text, Reiman and Powers' edition) In this final version, the stanza suggests that man's compelling of the elements is analogous, yet superior to the sun's benevolent tyranny over the planets, and far superior by implication to Jupiter's tyranny. Five suc- cessive drafts of the last three lines of the stanza exist in these notebooks; four of them are accompanied by sketches. By following these drafts and evaluating the interplay between visual and verbal sketches, we may ex- plore further the significance of this "tyranny." As noted above, the Pforzheimer "Reform" notebook apparently con- tains the earliest draft, since in this one the sun's tyranny appears in the third instead of the first line of the three, and in a more subordinated sentence structure. Below the lines, which are written fairly neatly across the top of the page (139v; reproduced in Shelley Circle VI, page 1073) is a neatly-centered, but small ink tree sketch in Shelley's firecracker or explosive style, not in the more rounded, dome-like style. Without a ground line and almost without a trunk, it floats in a space made more dislocated by some pencilled sums that fill up the rest of the page. Though it seems to illustrate nothing in these lines, one might see the foliage as star-like or planet-like. Its explosive upward style, however, may either echo or point toward a pair of lines Shelley drafts on 140r, which even- tually go earlier in Earth's same lyrical speech: "And like a wind bursting its rocky prison / With earthquake &amp; with lightning-it has risen...." (also reproduced on Shelley Circle VI, page 1073). In the second draft, the passage in HM 2177, *21r already discussed (see fig. 11), the profiles sketched on that page and on those preceding and following may dictate both a testing of "frown" instead of "gaze" and the more prominent placing of the sun. The sun's increased prominence comes both from the reordering of the lines and from its position as subject of the main clause: "Yon Sun,</page><page sequence="33">242 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY gaze who rules as with a tyrant's frown...." In the third draft (Bod. MS. Shelley e. 12, page 72), two significant changes occur: Shelley returns to "gaze," evidently as he finds its rhyme-word "maze"; and he proposes, then cancels, a shift in the position of the simile "[As the sun rules]/ The great Sun rules as with a tyrants gaze/ The unquiet republic of the maze/ Of ever wandering Planets-" (Z, 89). In this draft the sketch, also in ink, seems roughly illustrative of the new rhyme: a triangular box like a rack for pool balls encloses a single, large pool ball (see fig. 12). Though that ball looks more trapped than ruling with its gaze, the diagram may well represent the sun within an abstract maze. It also bears some resemblance to the boat or chariot enclosing a sphere which follows on page 75 as it illustrates "a chariot like the thinnest boat" from earlier in Act IV. The fourth and fifth drafts are both in HM 2176-the fourth on *22r, the fifth on *24v. In the fourth draft, Shelley incorporates his earlier scratch-through and makes the entire passage an analogy, and he moves toward completing the third-ultimately the sixth-line: [So] even [As] the Sun rules, [as] with a tyrants gaze The unquiet republic of the maze Of even wandering Planets, [round] revolving in their spheres (Z, 89) The tiny tree sketches below these lines are in pencil and thus share neither subject matter nor writing implement with the lines; but those trees and an ink-sketched tree set on a hillside between earlier stanzas of the same speech on *25r may have led to the fifth version of line 6 on *24, since for the first time the word "wilderness" appears: As the Sun rules even with a tyrants gaze The unquiet Republic of the maze world Of [everw-wandering] keepless wilderness [strug Planets], struggling whilst [woul] Heaven struggling to seek In the sixth and final draft, for which no notebook copy exists, the sixth line reads, ". . . Of Planets, struggling fierce towards Heaven's free wilderness" (Reiman and Powers' edition). Although in this sequence of</page><page sequence="34">SHELLEY AT PLAY 243 drafts, Shelley seems to alternate casually, almost unconsciously, bet- ween two of his favorite meditative motifs for sketches, these two motifs both reflect and suggest the meanings he explores. Between them they define the difficult paradox he develops in Earth's speech. A freedom which is fiercely, organically energetic yet not a fully anarchic "wilderness" is patterned in a "tyranny" whose chains are "linked thought, / Of love and might to be divided not." In Act I the final fury describes a division between "power" and love-a division which creates Jupiter and thus Pro- metheus' own chains. Here the Earth-spirit joins power and love in the positive image of the "maze" which redefines both "tyrant's gaze" and "wilderness." iv Most of the remaining sketches may be classified as boats, as architec- tural sketches or diagrams, and as a mixed group of quasi-human fragments or smaller artifacts. Though the landscapes and profiles describ- ed earlier run through the Prometheus drafts in all the notebooks, these less frequently repeated motifs are limited to Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12 and the fair-copy notebooks, Bod. MS. Shelley e. 1-3. Because there are far fewer of these sketches, any speculation about their symbolic significance in context must remain tentative. Yet Shelley's fascination with both actual and symbolic boats, and their repeated appearance in his poetry, seems to make their appearance in an otherwise unconnected context significant of some visionary voyage. In Bod. MS. Shelley e. 2, page 16, a detailed pencil-sketch of a sloop- rigged boat drawn with keel parallel to the notebook spine may freely illustrate the shipwreck described by the second spirit who comes to com- fort Prometheus at the end of Act I; the lines are on 14v, the preceding page of Shelley's fair copy. On page 42 of Bod. MS. Shelley e. 2, op- posite II. iv. 19-32, three penciled triangles might be sloop sails. As Shelley revises in ink, he writes right over them, so caught up in his vision as to ignore the beginnings of its visual symbol. The added lines are II. iv. 24-25, and also a new final version of the musical, Aeolian force that draws Asia passively downward to Demorgorgon's cave. In Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12, many of the variant sketches are clustered near drafts of the semi-choruses that open Act IV. On page 59 of Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12, an incomplete gondola hull shows Shelley's exploring of an oceanic image for a first draft of IV. 1-8: waves gone The bright [stars] are [flashing]</page><page sequence="35">244 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY The Thier [The sea] [Where] In the depths of the dawn [They are there] sea(?) (Z, 44-45) About ten pages earlier in the same notebook come drafts of lines that eventually become lines 30-39 in Act IV. These are the first lines from Act IV that appear in the notebooks as we read from the front cover, so we might conjecture that these pages (48-51) show the genesis of Act IV. On page 48, along with a draft of a letter concerning financial mat- ters, are a tyrannical bald profile in the style of the Cenci drafts, a very smudged pencil tree trunk with some possible leaves, an ink ground line with two eggs or moons on it and, floating above it, a moon with a tiny, smiling face inside it. Below these are more ink drawings: a winged helmet or hemisphere; a winged globe, with a plant or flower drawn in pencil underneath; and a penciled tree trunk with a moon (see fig. 13). Because the facing page (49) contains the notebook's first lines from Act IV of Prometheus, this page suggests the talismanic quality of these sketches as Shelley begins to work out a complex stanzaic pattern-and possibly a new act for the drama he once thought complete. If these motifs come from Bryant or Faber, the mythologists' fascination with symbols of cosmic regeneration would support his own development of Act IV. A more developed scene, in which Shelley evidently first sketched a gondola with a tiny man standing in the stern poling, then transformed it to a sail boat, occupies some carefully written-around white space on page 49 itself (see fig. 14). The draft of IV. 30-39, on the page, describes how the past hours "outspeed the blast." This sketch also seems closely connected to the text on pages 50-51 in which Shelley reworks several lines describing the "waves . . . in Ocean." The flying, lightly stationed heavenly bodies sketched on page 48-globes, earths, moons-also point toward the central vision of the fourth act, the chariots of moon and earth and the dancelike dialogue of their spirits. So do some additional lines drafted on pages 50-51-abandoned, perhaps, because Shelley decides to use the image in a more developed way later in the act, and further on in this notebook. "Written vertically in the margin," as Zillman described them (Z, 48), the lines are: "The thin moon is hanging/ In the whiteness/ [As one weak &amp; dying] waning of brightness/ [With With pleasure]/ On." All of these visual and verbal images fuse on page 74, as Shelley drafts Ione's speech describing "A chariot like that thinnest boat/ In which the Mother</page><page sequence="36">SHELLEY AT PLAY 245 't,:;'t3 Ct- O, ' I0 4- S % \ *.... &gt;o.00 A~A Fig. 13: Bod.

As her speech continues on the facing page (75), Shelley sketches just above the lines [fairer than] "And in it sits a [winged child] Infant, white," a tiny moon-boat holding a globe or sphere-the crescent moon holding the old moon (Z, 67), or the moon-goddess in her boat. One verbal model for these lines is of course Coleridge's "Dejection Ode."31 A closer visual model than anything in Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12 comes from the back cover and end page of HM 2177 (see fig. 6). Containing only one passage from Act IV, the variant of the "tyrant's gaze" passage already described, this notebook seem to have been in fre- quent use earlier in 1819.32 The back cover of Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 11, a notebook also in heavy use earlier in 1819, shows another ver- sion of Shelley's fascination with variations of this moon-boat design: three crescent moons, one with three small figures in it set on a ground plane. These playful earlier visual sketches are verbally-and sublimely- magnified in lone's description. Significantly, Panthea's similar but more complex account of the earth's "whirlwind harmony" has no accompa- nying sketch (Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12, pages 76-79). The architectural sketches are few and faint. A rough pencil sketch of a crag-like tower, or perhaps a boat, on Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12, page 52, has no bearing on the penciled lines from IV. 4-8; but it may reflect the ink lines from IV. 342-349 on page 53, facing it, which describe "each craglike tower &amp; storied column." A second, far rougher yet architectural sketch on Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12, page 89, seems unrelated to its text, a draft of IV. 75ff. Otherwise, the only architec- tural sketches adjacent to the Prometheus drafts are in the fair-copy notebooks. This fact is particularly surprising when one considers the importance of architecture in the play and in the letters as an organizing spatial and historical framework. Even in the fair-copy notebooks, only two of the four "architectural" sketches clearly represent buildings: the other two are quasi-architectural diagrams. All four are in pencil, on the recto pages Shelley was leaving blank for revisions, and the two more explicitly architectural ones use the outside long edge of the page as their base, so that sketching and copying would necessarily be separated both by a turning of the notebook and by a change of writing implement. In Bod. MS. Shelley e. 3, page 8, he uses the full page for a lightly outlined, unshaded drawing of a Venetian or possibly Florentine scene. An arched bridge dominates the foreground leading toward building fronts and a bell or clock tower. Facing this drawing are the lines in which Panthea recognizes Asia's radiant transformation. Although it may predate the fair-copy text, this scene of river or canal quai might have prompted the most lyrical boat image in the play: three pages later Shelley adds, begin-</page><page sequence="39">248 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY ning on the blank page 11, Asia's lyric, "My soul is an enchanted boat." The sketch is not drawn and redrawn, however, as those in the draft notebooks frequently are; and it shows neither boat nor river, much less the paradisal wilderness of which Asia sings. In the second explicitly architectural sketch, natural and artificial blend in a way that resembles Shelley's descriptions to Peacock in the letters. On 16 in Bod. MS. Shelley e. 2, as noted earlier, a sloop sails with its hull parallel to the notebook spine. On the same page, but with its base to the long right margin, is a small but carefully sketched tower, with vines growing over its ruined top. Such a watchtower might suit either the sage or the poet which the comforting spirits describe to Prometheus in I. 723ff., although neither stanza refers explicitly to a tower. More tentative in execution and far more difficult to relate to adjoining texts are diagrams in the fair-copy notebooks. The first, in Bod. MS. Shelley e. 2, page 23, a pyramid on a cube set in a grove of treetops, might epitomize the clash between Shelley's frequent verbal treatment of the natural scene as geometric-pyramidal or obelisk in shape-and his more usual visual treatment of it as rounded and organic. The second inscrutable pencil sketch, an encircled "x" or kite in a swirl of rough concentric lines resembling a cave, might represent the unknown force in the volcanic cave, since it faces a part of Asia's interview with Demorgorgon (Bod. MS. Shelley e. 3, page 3). One would hesitate, though, to call this rough sketch an image or even an antiimage of the "deep truth" to which Demogorgon refuses to give verbal, even conceptual definition. A clearer case for sketches as images of concepts in adjoining verbal texts can be based on a group of otherwise almost unclassifiable drawings-all from Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12. One of these further illustrates the opening choruses from Act IV already discussed. These passages which celebrate the procession of dead hours are marked over, on page 88, with a rough hourglass design in pencil.33 Yet the design shares less of that mutual respect for text and sketch than is usual in Shelley's notebooks. Like a scrawled deletion mark, this measure of time cancels part of the chorus celebrating the cancellation of time. An eccentric drawing on page 37 of Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12 may illustrate the lines from Apollo's speech in III. ii, describing Jupiter's fall: ... his tempest baffled wings/ Entangled in the whirlwind, [while] and undazzling blinded his eyes/ Which gazed [undazzled on] the sun, now [saw] / by the white lightning, while the ponderous hail/ Beats on his struggling form, which sinks at length/ Prone, and the aerial ice clings over it" (Z, 39). Resembling a winged helmet, or a set of rabbit's ears, the drawing may be a sort of visual pun showing Jupiter's shift from heroic to cowardly. An even more puzzling pair of sketches on page 94, a temple column</page><page sequence="40">SHELLEY AT PLAY 249 without capital or base, and a tree with carefully finished foliage but with ear- or wing-like projections sprouting from its trunk, seem to echo, though scarcely to illuminate, the second stanza on the page: "From the temples high/ Of man's ear &amp; eye/ Roofed over Sculpture &amp; Poesy/ From the springs Where [Science] is dewily Daedal wings." If these drawings are indeed linked to the text, they suggest an almost cartoonlike mockery of the complex metaphorical levels in the lyric (Z, 56). A final and similarly self-mocking sketch appears on Bod. MS. Shelley adds. e. 12, page 81. A pair of striding legs, drawn in pencil, may illustrate lines IV. 315ff. on that page:" . or some [Spirit]/ Wore deluge like God a [robe, or some] [angel] / Gasped, yelled &amp;/ Whose throne was robe, . in a comet, past" (Z, 74-75). On the next page (82), the verso of this one, Shelley drafts a passage which eventually becomes IV. 382-388 and which might have developed its images from the sketch. Addressing man, the spirit of the earth calls him [Thou mightiest] [perfect *] [at whose feet Pain &amp; Hate &amp; Error] Through whom [I conquer] fear &amp; error forever(?) [Are like slaves chained] (Z, 86) These rising, leaping legs might well leave pain and hate and error at their feet. The sketch then acts as a kind of focus both for this verbal image of human regeneration and for the description of a superhuman but anthropomorphic destroyer. It also suggests the nearly apocalyptic interplay of human and cosmic forces which Shelley works out in Act IV. v Finally, these pages show both the limited range and the suggestive quality of Shelley as visual artist. In the interplay between visual and verbal sketches we can also begin to see an interplay between impulse and form, energy and stasis. Yet this interplay does not correspond exactly to Lessing's distinction between the dynamic movement of poetry and music, and the static form of the visual and sculptural arts. Compared to the brilliant flexibility of perception and of symbolic value in the verbal texts which surround them, these sketches can appear static in meaning as well as medium. Yet in their recurrent motifs of regeneration and limit, in</page><page sequence="41">250 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY Shelley's constant acknowledgement of their visual presence as both physically limiting and yet symbolic, and in the temporal and visual rhythms we can sense in his processes of giving form to impulse, they lead us toward a similar exploration of binding and freedom in Prometheus Unbound. Both in expression and in their verbal context, the profiles suggest a tyranny which must be transformed from an externally imposed to an internally generated form. The architectural images might suggest a similar conversion to a positive, humanized, and humanly expressive definition of form-as do the temples of ruined Rome and regenerative Greece in Act III-but there are too few of them to support adequate generaliza- tion. Apparently at the opposite pole are his reiterative sketches of trees and woodland landscapes. Obviously natural, organic, and generative, these sketches in their very frequency also seem closest to the processes of poetic generation. As noted earlier, Rogers calls these trees symbols of regeneration; and in describing the dome as symbolic of imagination for Shelley, G. Wilson Knight might also have been describing these round- ed tree-tops that spring up between stanzas of his choruses.34 Yet the energy of the natural world is problematic in Prometheus Un- bound. As spatial interruptions in the temporal sequence of writing out his drafts, interruptions in which Shelley hears the musical rhythm of his lines, these drawings point to this ambiguous significance. For the repeated drawings of trees seem to return to the English landscapes of Shelley's childhood. They also evoke a Wordsworthian source of energy and power that at times lies within natural phenomena and at times mysteriously behind and distanced from them. Finally, they suggest a paradisal place. Yet if these drawings point toward both a personal and a mythical Eden, they also raise that characteristic Romantic protest that Eden is a static and unconscious world. Asia makes this claim to Demorgorgon in II. iv. 34ff. Though sharing the "calm joy of flowers and living leaves / Before the wind or sun has withered them," the primal humans ruled by Saturn were denied "The birthright of their being, knowledge, power, ... thought ... Self-empire and the majesty of love." Is this static if paradisal state the consequence of timelessness? Further, does it in any way reflect that state of the individual mind before it at- tempts to create in time-before it casts prophetic vision into verse, or even before such prophecy comes to explicit consciousness? Not only the tree sketches but all the sketches to the extent that they halt time may mark two borderlines: first, between an unthinking Saturnian or Edenic "indolence," to use Keats' word, and the consciousness of temporal pro- cess; and second, between that world of temporal process and a Pro- methean paradise restored through verbal music. In such a formulation, Shelley's individual creative process parallels the mythic process of</page><page sequence="42">SHELLEY AT PLAY 251 regeneration enacted in his play. The drawings which come closest to suggesting the dynamic process of conveying creative impulse into poetic expression are those of boats and of chariots like boats. Driven by the impulse of the wind, the sailboat also shows which way the wind is blowing.35 The very literalness of these drawings of sailboats, in counterpoint both to their embedding in surrounding verbal texts and to the verbal images of boats in those texts, makes them mediators which present invisible forces to us. The more visionary emblematic sketches of crescent moons as boats or chariots, or sometimes as eyelids that enclose staring eyes, mediate through a more complex web of visual and verbal allusion. Like the lines describing a "chariot like that thinnest boat / In which the Mother of the Months is borne," these sketches signal a rising storm of energy either from within the self or from some natural or spiritual power outside the self. The eyed chariot in the sketches, developing from but moving beyond the moon- boats of Bryant and Faber, also reinforces the resemblance of the Earth- spirit's whirling spheres to Ezekiel's visionary chariot of divine power. Although such images help us to see past the unthinking "dull round" of merely natural cycles, they also help us recognize the grounding of imaginative vision in the sights of this world. Shelley underscores this ambiguity between visual sight and visionary transformation with his characteristic playful irony. At the beginning of Act IV, Panthea and lone watch a shadowy, confused triumphal proces- sion in which the "dark forms" of past hours are led off captive. Unseen choruses then begin to celebrate this triumph over time. Hearing their voices, Ione asks, "What charioteers are these?" For a moment we assume that she sees these figures in their visionary chariots and needs only to know their specific powers of renewal. Because of the roles of the Oceanides earlier in the play, we are prepared to accept lone's role as a presenter of these transforming energies which have become newly manifest. Then, in the next line, Panthea asks, "Where are their chariots?" Her further question suddenly jolts us from our symbolic interpretations back to the question of whether the literal sign or image is there at all, and whether it need be. Her question works in two ways. By not yet see- ing the chariots, she denies the visual sign that should support our sym- bolic readings, and those readings begin to seem wildly speculative or merely potential; but that image which she denies seeing-the chariot-is itself a symbol for the communication of power from one realm to another. Just at the moment when a visionary, timeless realm seems to triumph over ordinary spatial and temporal reality, Panthea reminds us of the complex, precarious, yet continued relationship between the language of visual image and of visionary symbol. With this heuristic skepticism as guide, we can recognize the complex importance of these visual sket-</page><page sequence="43">252 HUNTINGTON LIBRARY QUARTERLY ches in Shelley's creative process. Finally, in all the sketches, we can also recognize the complex importance of this world and its visual images as the ground for his poetry's Promethean transformations.

Moore, in Iconography of Religions: An Introduction (Philadelphia, 1977), speculates that the eye is associated with Isis and with the moon (68). In spite of Moore's suggestion, I have not yet found a specific illustration that might serve as a direct model of Shelley's moon-boat that carries the orb of an eye, though many which carry the orb of a moon or a sun. His drawings themselves might have suggested the image. In the discussion of possible sources that follows, I have indicated specific evidence for Shelley's reading when is it available; in other cases, I borrow Curran's argument for Shelley's acquaintance with the intellectual mainstream of his time (Annus Mirabilis, xvii). Further, I have not attempted here to investigate every possible source for these symbolic images, since the two strands I describe are themselves so complex, but only to show availability and range of interpretation.

The three intermediate fair-copy notebooks (Bodleian MSS. Shelley e. 1, e. 2, and e. 3) evidently were first used for copying-and revising, in a limited way-Acts I-III; Act IV is squeezed in, as if unplanned for, on the recto pages which had originally been saved for additions and corrections to the first three acts. The pages of Ion transla- tion also occupy the recto pages, approximately pp. 16-23 of Bod. MS. Shelley e. 1; on page 25, Act IV begins. See Notopoulos, The Platonism of Shelley, 463-464, for discussion of the date of the Ion translation as 1821; he does not mention these pages in Bod. MS.
