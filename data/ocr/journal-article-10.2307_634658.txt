Edited by Derek Ratcliffe. 2 vols. Cambridge University Press, for the Natural Environment Research Council and the Nature Conservancy Council, 1977. xvi, 401 p. (vol. 1); viii, 320 p. (vol. 2). Maps, tab., ///., bibliogr., ind. 28 cm. ?35 (vol. 1); ?25 (vol. 2) lt is clearly not easy to do justice to this massive, two-volume publication, in a brief review?particularly since conservation of wild life involves many different philo- sophical considerations. These are in fact very fully discussed in vol. I, and this dis? cussion can be considered to be the most valuable part of the two volumes. The Nature Conservancy (which is now separated into the Nature Conservancy Council, under the Department of Environment, and the Institute of Terrestrial Ecology, under the Natural Environment Research Council) was set up in 1949, with a remit to study generally the conservation of wild life and its habitats?and also the habitats per se?and, in connection with this, to institute and manage nature reserves. As additions to the latter, it was also to schedule sites of special scientific interest which could not, for various reasons, be declared as nature reserves. The present publi? cation can be described as an account of what the Conservancy has done?and is still doing?under these remits. It has now been found convenient to classify sites in five grades according to an, inevitably partly subjective, scale of scientific values, ranging from nature reserves of international significance to sites of local interest. Those in the highest categories are declared as de jure nature reserves as opportunity occurs to acquire them as Crown Land for the purpose. In the second part of vol. 1 they are discussed, broadly by habitat types, and in vol. 2 their features, as at present known, are discussed one by one. The second volume could be described as a reference book for those concerned in the maintenance of sites?whether they be the Conservancy's staff, or others who ask, or are commissioned, to work in them. In the above framework these volumes can scarcely be faulted, except as regards price?which makes one wonder whether a digest, of more modest proportions and cost, would not be more generally useful. An omission, which is admitted, is the discussion and list of sites of geological and geomorphological interest, per se, which was a task included in the Conservancy's original charter. Its former Chief Geologist did produce a volume for south-west England, Geological highlights ofthe West Country by W. A. Macfadyen (Butterworth, 1970), which has proved a very useful work of reference, but it has not been followed up for other parts of Britain. In the light of history, it may eventually come to be thought that conservation of threatened areas of wild life interest was a necessary stage in the conservation of natural resources, but that reconciliation of conservation and other interests (agricultural and extractive industry, for example) was the ultimate aim. One has a feeling that, in the setting of a developed country like Britain, it is now time to devote rather more at? tention to this aim. True, the Nature Conservancy is not unmindful of this; but, to be</page><page sequence="2">REVIEWS 129 successful, it may be necessary for it to be less dominated than at present by 'biological ecologists', who, while recognizing the importance ofthe physical and anthropomorphic settings, do not in general find the study of these as much to their taste as that of the wild life itself. These things are being more and more considered by people outside the Nature Conservancy, but to reinvigorate the movement, as the Director of NCC, R. E. Boote, recently stated to be necessary, in Scientific aspects of nature conservation in Great Britain (Royal Society, 1977), it is probably desirable to give still more weight to these matters. Meanwhile, it has to be said that the NCC disbanded its climatological section, and seems to give 'poor relation' treatment to its geological and physio- graphical section. To reiterate what was said at the beginning of this short review, one simply cannot, in a few words, do justice to this publication, and one may end by recommending as many people as possible at least to read the general discussion in vol. 1. It seems unfortunate that the indices, in each volume, are only for sites (by name) and not for subjects. F. H. W. Green</page></plain_text>
