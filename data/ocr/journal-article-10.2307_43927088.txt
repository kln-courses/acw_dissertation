<plain_text><page sequence="1">SURVIVAL AND CHRISTIANIZATION OF THE GILGAMESH QUEST FOR IMMORTALITY IN THE TALE OF ALEXANDER AND THE FOUNTAIN OF LIFE Tommaso Tesei Scholars generally agree that the legend of Alexander and the fountain of life has its roots in the ancient theme of Gilgamesh's quest for immortality. The two tales share the broad outlines of the narration and it is probable that the Alexander legend some- how depends on the ancient Babylonian epic. However, when compared to each other, the tales present also two main differences. The first one concerns the object sought by the two heros: on the one hand we have the Gilgamesh plant of youth, on the other hand the Alexander water of life. The second difference concerns the replacement of the snake's shed skin motif, which occurs in the Gilgamesh epic, by that of the resur- rection of the fish found in the Alexander legend. These differences arise because of the conformation of the ancient Gilgamesh tale to the new Christian symbolism and morality, which spread in Late Antiquity. In fact, the Alexander motif of the fish resur- recting when washed in the water of life implies a strong Christian allegorical dimen- sion, in which the theme of baptism as way of salvation is central. The ancient story of Gilgamesh quest for immortality persisted in Late Antiquity, under the form of the tale of Alexander and the water of life. However, within this tradition some elements of in- novation were added, which conferred on the tale the character of Christian legend. In Gilgamos,1 1894 Bruno in which Meissner he drew published the attention a brief to study a number entitled of common Alexander points und Gilgamos,1 in which he drew the attention to a number of common points between Gilgamesh's quest for immortality, told in tablets ix, x and xi of the Babylonian Epic , and the Alexander search of the fountain of life, found in Ps.-Callisthenes' Alexander Romance (recension ß, 4th /5th c. CE). Beside the common theme of the quest for immortality, Meissner pointed out a consid- erable number of motifs issued from the ancient Gilgamesh epic, which also occur in the Greek Alexander tale and in its related versions found in Hebrew, Syriac and Arabic literature. The same topic was discussed in the early years of the past century by a number of German scholars, who studied the rela- tionship between the episode of Alexander at the source of life and the relat- ed tale of Moses' journey to the Magma ' al-bahrayn ("the confluence of the two seas"), told in Qur ān i8:6o-82.2 While the modalities of transmission 1 B.

On the contrary, in this paper I would like to draw the attention to two main differences between them, since in my opinion the points of interest between two related texts are found in their mutual differences as well as in their similarities. As it will be shown, these differences arise because of the conformation of the ancient Gilgamesh tale to the new Christian symbolism and morality, which spread in Late Antiquity The first difference is concerned with the object sought by the two heros: on the one hand we have the Gilgamesh plant of youth, on the other hand the Alexander water of life. The second difference concerns the replacement of the snake's shed skin motif, which occurs in the Gilgamesh epic, by that of the resurrection of the fish found in the Alexander Romance. In both cases, I'll draw the attention mostly to the symbolic value of the two new elements within the episode of the source of life, trying to show what they could rep- resent to the eyes of a reader of late antiquity It will be clear that the motif of the fish washed in the source - which results from the combination of the two new elements - implies a strong allegorical dimension, in which the Christian theme of baptism as way of salvation is central. I will deliberately avoid to discuss in detail the Jewish and Islamic versions of the Alexander tale, which are related to that found in the Ps.-Callisthenes. In fact, while these two versions contain a number of Gilgamesh elements Die Chadhirlegende und der Alexanderroman, s.e., Leipzing-Berlin, 1913; Idem, "Zur Geschichte der Chad- hirlegende", Archiv für Religionswissenschaft 13, 1910, pp. 92-110; Idem, "Alexanders Zug nach dem Lebens- quell und die Chadhirlegende", ibid., pp. 319-27. As shown by Arent Wensinck, the Quranic story con- tains further elements proceeding from the Gilgamesh Epic that do not occur in the Alexander tale (A. J. Wensinck, "al-Khadir", Encyclopédie de l'Islam2, E.J. Brill, Leiden, 1986, pp. 935-39). 3 The presence of many Gilgamesh elements scattered around Syriac, Hebrew and Arabic versions of the tale suggests the existence of an Aramaic version of the Epic of Gilgamesh. As suggested by Kevin van Bladel, "there seems to have been an oral tradition of the Gilgamesh story that became associated at an unknown time with Alexander [. . .] a Late Antique Aramaic oral tradition of Gilgamesh in which the name Alexander replaced the more ancient hero's name" (K. van Bladel, "The Alexander Legend in the Qur ān 18:83-102", in G. S. Reynolds (ed.), The Qur'än in Its Historical Context, Routledge, New York, 2007, pp. 197-198, n. 8). The existence of an Aramaic version of the Babylonian poem has been al- so suggested by John C. Reeves to explain the occurrence of the names of Gilgamesh, Humbaba and perhaps Utnapištim in some traditions of the Book of Giants found in the Manichaean fragments of the work and in those found in the Qumran manuscripts (J. C. Reeves, Jewish Lore in Manichaean Cosmogony: Studies in the Book of Giants Traditions, Hebrew Union College Press, Cincinnati, 1992, p. 126). 4 F.

The present paper will mainly address the most ancient ver- sion of the tale, found in the Greek Alexander Romance, and the Syriac version of the episode, which is found in the so-called Syriac Alexander Song (630-40 CE).5 However, sporadic references to the Jewish and Islamic versions will be done in conformity with the present purpose, that is to show how in Late An- tiquity the Gilgamesh story of the quest for immortality persisted in the Alexander tale, becoming a Christian legend. Gilgamesh and Alexander Storie s Compared Gilgamesh's quest for immortality is told in tablets ix, x and xi of the Baby- lonian Epic. Here the hero, shattered because of the passing of his compan- ion Enkidu, undertakes a journey in quest of a manner to flee the death. He travels in direction of the ina pí nãrãti ,6 "the Mouth of the Rivers", dwelling place of Utnapištim, the hero of the flood who gained immortality. After hav- ing traveled into the darkness of Mount Masu and having crossed the encir- cling Ocean (tâmtu) and the waters of death (mê mūti ), the hero joins the ina pí nãrãti. Utnapištim informs Gilgamesh that only the gods can confer im- mortality to human beings and he exhorts the hero not to sleep for six days and seven nights. However, Gilgamesh fails the test and Utnapištim can only disclose the secret concerning a plant, which will restore his aspect worn by grief and the long wandering. Then Gilgamesh plunges into the sea and opens a tunnel (rātu) leading through the sweet waters of the Apsu, where he picks the miraculous plant. However, on the way of return, Gilgamesh is robbed of the plant by a snake issued from the waters of a well where he is having a bath. At the contact with the plant the snake loses his old skin, while Gilgamesh must accept this second failure. The Alexander tale of the water of life has been preserved in four versions found in: Ree. ß of Ps.-Callisthenes (11. 39-41); Babylonian Talmud (Tamid, 32a-32b); the xviii Qur anie sura w. 60-82; the so-called Syriac Alexander Song of the Ps. Jacob of Sarùg. As said above, in the present paper I will discuss on- ly the first and the last versions. 5 The poem was translated by Wallis-Budge and published among other Syriac texts concerning Alexander (E. A. Wallis-Budge, The History of Alexander the Great, being the Syriac Version of the Pseudo- Callisthenes, Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 1889, 566 pp.). The Syriac text was firstly edited by Hunnius (C. Hunnius, "Das Syrische Alexanderlied", Zeitschrift der Deutschen Morgenländischen Gesell- schaft, 60, 1906, pp. 169-209, with German translation) and reedited by Reinink, who admirably studied the work in all its three recensions (G. J. Reinink, Das Syrische Alexanderlied, Die drei Rezensionen, csco 454, 455, Script. Syri 195, 196, Louvain, 1983, 2 voli.). Recently George Bohas has published a French trans- lation of the work (G. Bohas, Alexandre syriaque, iloam, Lyon, 2009, pp. 45-87)- Concerning the compo- sition and the dating of the work see: G. J.

From here he wants to reach the Land of Blessed (yj xaXoujxevY) (xaxápcov x^Pa)i dien he starts a march through the darkness. During a pause, hungry, he asks his cook to pre- pare something to eat. The cook washes a salt fish ( TÁpiypc ;) in the water of a flashing source (7r7)y7¡ StauyTjç to uScop 7ļ&lt;JTpa7TTev ax; á(rrpa7nj). Mirac- ulously the fish comes back to life, but the cook does not inform Alexander. The journey goes on until Alexander reaches the Land of Blessed, where - however - two anthropomorphic birds orders him to turn back. At the exit of the Land of Darkness, Alexander discovers the fish's resurrection episode, but it is too late to reach the miraculous source of water. The Syriac Alexander Song presents an extended version of the tale.7 Alexan- der and his troops venture in the Land of Darkness ( hmwt 8 d-hsk '), where the king wants to find the "source of the living water" ( lyri d-my' hy' also referred to as lyri d-hy', "source of life"). An old man informs him that the region is full of sources and suggests to Alexander a strategy to identify the miraculous wa- ter. His cook shall wash a salt fish (nwn') in every waterway that he meets and inform him when the fish comes back to life. The stratagem works but Alexan- der cannot join the source because of the deep darkness, which forbids him to find the way. At the end of the story the old man comforts Alexander explain- ing that it was not the divine will that he acquires immortality As the reader can see, the two stories share the broad outlines of the nar- ration. A king starts a journey through an utter darkness looking for immor- tality. In Gilgamesh Epic and Ree. ß this is linked to a specific place (i.e., Ut- napistim's abode and the Land of Blessed), in the Alexander Song to a magical object (i.e., the source of life). It is important to remark that the Gilgamesh Epic and the Ps.-Callisthenes text share the same narrative structure concern- ing the hero's "double failure". In other words, Gilgamesh first fails the occa- sion to gain the immortality and later misses the possibility to keep the plant of youth. In the same way, in the Ps.-Callisthenes Alexander loses both the opportunity to bath into the source and the possibility to stay in the Land of Blessed. On the contrary, in the Syriac version Alexander fails only one time, because the episode of the Land of Blessed does not appear. Both tales pres- ent a magical object: a rejuvenating plant or a miraculous water. In both cas- es hero's failure is connected with the incredible regeneration of an animal: a snake which changes the skin at the contact with the plant; a fish which comes back to life because of the power of the magical water. 7 For the criticism to the idea that the Song contains a version of the tale more original that the one found in the Romance, see: G.J. Reinink, "Alexander der Große und der Lebensquell im Syrischen Alexan- derlied", in E. A.

The first differ- ence between the stories concerns the object sought by the two heroes: the plant of youth in the Gilgamesh Epic , the water of life in the Alexander tale. The second difference on which I will focus the attention concerns the pres- ence of a fish instead of a snake in the Alexander tale. The Plant of Youth and the Water of Life The motif of the water of life does not occur in the Gilgamesh story. Then it appears as an innovation of the Alexander tale. The magical plant found in the Gilgamesh Epic differs from the miraculous source also for its properties. Contrary to the water of life, the plant of youth has not the power of giving back life. While often scholars erroneously speak of "plant of life", the im- mortality sought by Gilgamesh is closely linked to Utnapistim's abode. As shown by Clark, ina pí nārāti not only represents a mythical distant land, but also an eschatological alternative to the Netherworld, a kind of very exclu- sive Paradise reserved to few people.9 In a different way - as outlined by Dur- ing Caspers - the plant of youth possesses only "rejuvenating power, not im- mortality, as sometimes thought".10 The confusion between magical objects granting immortality and those giving eternal youth goes back to very ancient times. Syriac literature offers a good example: the expression my ' hy' "living water", may designate either the miraculous drink which grants eternal life or that with healing and reju- venating properties. In fact, if in the Alexander Song the magical water raises dead and defeats death, another legend concerning Constantine's baptism (datable to 5th /6th c. C.E) credits the source with the power of curing the em- peror of leprosy. However, the miraculous water can only rejuvenate Con- stantine's skin, not give him eternal life!11 9 R.J. Clark, "Origins: New Light on Eschatology in Gilgamesh's Mortuary Journey", inj. Maier (ed.), Gilgamesh: A Reader, 199 7, pp. 131-47. This conception first appears in Sumerian eschatology; as out- lined by J. E. Wright, "There was an idea of paradise, but this was not the destiny of most people [. . .] There was a Sumerian paradise of sorts, and according to some myths this was located on earth in the land of Dilmun [...] The Sumerians called their paradise the Land of the Living, and this is where su- permortals like Ziusudra and Utnapishtim lived, the Noah-like heroes of the Sumerian and Babylonian versions of the Flood myth." (J. E. Wright, The Early History of Heaven, Oxford University Press, New York, 1990, pp. 29-30). 10 E. C. L.

For example, at contact with the magical water the emperor's old skin falls like fish scales, being replaced by a new one similar to that of a newborn baby. The motif makes a correspondence with the snake s shedding at contact with the plant of youth which occurs in the Gilgamesh story. Moreover, in Constantine tale the emperor may reach the source with the help of pope Silvester. As outlined by Mario Casari, the name Sylvester, meaning "syl- van", may be related to that of al-Hidr, meaning "the green one", by which Quranic commentators des- ignate the mysterious character met by Moses in the islamic version of the Alexander tale found in Q</page><page sequence="6">422 TOMMASO TESEI [6] The hesitations about the properties of the magical water are probably due to the idea that the assumption of an unlimited quantity of a rejuvenating substance may grant the eternal youth and thus the eternal life. It is also reasonable to explain the different properties attributed to the source of life by considering that such an object does not exist, and therefore it is subject to the action of fantasy This situation obviously confers on the storyteller a full free- dom of adding new elements to the motif, often taken from other tales. In the case of the Alexander story, this is particular evident by observing the extend- ed version of the tale found in the so-called Ms. L. of Ree. ß. In this developed version - apparently drawn out from the myth of Glaucon, found in Oviďs Metamorphosis - the cook, named Andreas, intentionally hides from Alexander the discovery of the source. Moreover, he keeps some magical water and offers it to Alexander's daughter Kale. Both become immortals but the king, furious at what happened, chases away Kale and throws Andreas into the depth of the sea. 12ģ By comparing the two versions of the tale, it appears that Ms. L adds the idea that the magical water can grant immortality. Such idea is absent in the Ps. Callisthenes text, where all we can learn about the properties of the magical water is that it has the power to make a salt fish come back to life. At the same time we can observe a sort of restriction opposed by the rea- son to the creative action of fantasy. In other words, it is not an accident if Alexander cannot bathe in the source. In fact as a real historical character, he is not susceptible of acquiring immortality because of the difficulties of an- swering the consequential, unavoidable questions: "If Alexander has become immortal where is he now? Why hasn t he accomplished his propose of con- quering the entire world and why at present is he not the king?". On the con- trary, unhistorical characters like Utnapištim, Andreas or Kale do not set the same problem, thus they offered full freedom to the action of fantasy. In fact Utnapistim's residing in an immortal land situated at the far edges of the world fully answers the spontaneous question: "If immortal people exist, why do not they live between us?". Immortality is reserved to legendary characters. The impossibility of granting immortality to an historical character offers also the occasion to reflect on the human existence and to confer on the tale a moral lesson: immortality is not for humans, who must accept their fate 18:60-82 (M.

This strong morality is already present in the Gilgamesh tale, when the hero must accept the following Utnapistim's words: Man is one whose progeny is snapped off like a reed in the canebrake: the comely young man, the pretty young woman, all [ too soon in] their very [pńme] Death abducts (them).13 The Syńac Alexander Song maintains this moral lesson by adapting it to the Christian conceptions. This appears clearly from the words by which the old man tries to comfort Alexander, when he realises that he cannot reach the source: "The Lord hath not turned His face away from thee, O king". The old man said, "Let us turn our beasts and let us go forth from here; For the Lord does not wish thee to bathe in the source and live forever".14 In sum, the replacement of the plant of youth by the water of life does not distort the structure of the tale: as said above, independently from the spe- cific magical substance, its use would quarrel with the possibility of making an historical character benefit of their miraculous properties. From the Plant of Youth to the Water of Life The Greco-Roman world knew a great variety of magical waters from which the author of Ree. ß could draw inspiration. In his Histories , Herodotus re- ports about a source located in the land of the Ethiopians, whose waters grant longevity (in. 22-24). Another example is represented by the ist century Ro- man poet Statius, who mentions the well-known motif of Achilles' invulner- ability caused by the hero's dipping in the waters of Styx (. Achilleid , 1. 133-34; 268-70; 480-81). 15 Moreover, in the Metamorphosis Apuleius speaks of a source of black waters flowing into the Styx, which has the incredible faculty of speaking (vi. 13-15). However, it is remarkable that before the tale of the source of life found in the Ps. Callisthenes, the Greco-Roman world appar- ently did not know the motif of a magical water capable of making dead come back to life and of granting immortality. According to Goppelt, "the Gk. world does not speak of a water of Ufe which makes possible life in the hereafter or which brings back from the un- derworld. [...] In Hell, (i.e., Hellenism) there arose the legend of Alexander's campaign for the water of life which confers immortality".16 It is important to point out that, contrarily to Goppelťs statement, no documentation sup- 13 Quoted from: A.

In fact, the story first occurs in the Ree. ß of Ps.-Callisthenes, which is usually dated between 4th and 5th c. C.E. The only earlier mention of the Alexander quest for immortality is in the words of Teles (ca. 240 B.C.), re- ported by Stobaeus, which state that men wish, like Alexander, to become im- mortals (oiGizzp 'AXéÇocvSpoç, á0ávaToç yevéaOat).17 Therefore, as Tarn ob- serves, it is possible that the story of Alexander's quest for immortality was already known in in the middle of the 3d c. B.C.18 However, unfortunately Teles does not mention neither the water of life nor the motif of the fish's resurrection, which first occur in the Ree. ß. As I will discuss later, it is very likely that these two features were added in the Late Antiquity by a Christian author, who wished to allude to the themes of baptism and resurrection. In every case, it is very revealing that the motif concerning the magical wa- ter arose during or after Hellenism, namely when the Greek world met the Ori- ental culture. In fact, the presence of the motif of the water of life in the Near Eastern literature goes back to very ancient times. In the Akkadian myth known as Ishtar's Descent to the Underworld , the goddess Ishtar can leave the Underworld only after having been sprinkled with the water of life. The par- allel is very close with the dynamic of the Alexander tale. In fact, in both cas- es the water has the power to bring a death back to life, a dead goddess in Akkadian myth, a salt fish in the Alexander story. The water of life also oc- curs in another ancient Near-Eastern myth, namely the story of Adapa. Here the hero ascends to heaven, where Anu offers him the possibility to acquire immortality by drinking the water of life (mê baiati). However, Adapa refus- es for he mistakes water of life for water of death (mê müti).19 Another interesting occurrence of the water of life is found in a more re- cent Jewish apocalyptic work, namely the Book of Enoch (1 Enoch).20 This ex- 17 T eles, Teletis Reliquiae, O.

There is a little clue which suggest that the Greek literature knew this Near Eastern motif concerning the water of life. In his Geography, Strabo reports a tradition concerning the mythical Land of Cimmerians, according to which in this country there is a sweet water source (nr¡yy¡); however, nobody draws from it for fear that it is the water of the infernal river Styx. Here one can find the same motif concerning the confusion between two kinds of water told in the story of Adapa. In fact, on the one hand, the sweet water source corresponds to the water of life, on the other hand, the river Styx has a close similarity with the waters of death. Moreover, while this tradition identifies the location of the Land of Cimmerians in the Italic peninsula, other views going back at least to Homer (Od., xi, 14-19) place this mythical country near the entrance of the Netherworld. Finally, this country is often described as a land of deep darkness, something that approaches it to the Land of Darkness in which Alexander finds the source of life. 20 For the Ethiopie version of lEnoch see: R.

Here the first journey of Enoch's cosmic tour to the edges of the Earth (chap. 17-19) is described, during which the protagonist is led by an angel to the "living waters" (v. 17:4). The Ethiopie expression that denotes these waters, mãyãt heyãwãn , clearly corresponds to the Syriac my ' hy ' which occurs in the Syriac Alexander Song. In the same way - as I will show later - the expression úScmov Ço&gt;vt&lt;úv, occurring in the Greek version of the work, can be related to the water accidentally found by Alexander's cook in the Ro- mance. Moreover, as shown by Coblentz Bautch the scenario of 1 Enoch 17:4-8 corresponds to the realm of the dead.22 It seems then that the living waters met by Enoch are located in the Netherworld, as the water of life occurring in the Ishtar's Descent to the Underworld.23 Now it is very important to stress that the same location can be assigned to Alexander's source of life. In fact, many elements suggest that the Land of Darkness where the miraculous water is found corresponds to the realm of the dead. In the Alexander Song the source of life is found in the Land of Dark- ness, which is referred to as hmwt d-hsk' The substantive for "land" differs in the three recensions of the Syriac text. While in Rec. 1 the word hmwt occurs, Rec. ii presents the three variations of hmty , hmt and yhmt. In contrast with the two previous recensions, Rec. iii glosses this difficult term in ymť, "marshland". According to Reinink, hmt and its variations are related to the term hmn, which occurs in Jacob of Sarūg and Ephrem the Syrian s works and denotes the realm of death.24 In the same way, the Land of Darkness of the Alexander Song may be relat- ed to Netherworld by the second term, hsk' which denotes darkness. This 21 For example, Enoch comes "to a dark place and to a mountain whose summit reached into the heavens" (17:2) that has a close similarity with the mount Masu. Then he meets a "river of fire" (17:5), which according to Grelot corresponds to the waters of death or to Pyriphlegethon, another infernal riv- er. Morover, Enoch sees "the mouth of all the rivers" (17:8), which reminds of ina pí nãrãti, "the mouth of the rivers". On the correspondences between Epic of Gilgamesh and 1 Enoch see: P.

As remarked by Mitchel Ringgren, "The ultimate calamity to befall mankind is death. The abode of the dead, se'ol , is a realm of darkness and gloom. "Darkness" thus becomes a poetic name for Sheol".25 The same term occurs in the Jewish version of the Alexander tale found in the Babylonian Talmud. Here Alexander must cross the Mounts of Darkness, called hãrê hošek. According to the tale, beneath this mountain is located the Gehenna; then the Mounts of Darkness too are related to the Netherworld. In summary, it seems possible that Alexander's journey to the Land of Darkness may have been understood as a visit to Netherworld.26 In fact, the water of life is often located in the realm of the dead in Babylonian literature as well as in an influent Jewish apocalypse like the Book of Enoch. The same location in the Syriac and Hebrew versions of the Alexander tale points to a contamination of the story by elements related to the theme of the descent to the Underworld.27 A Terminological Enlightenment About the Water of Life Before proceeding with our analysis it is expedient to provide some insight in- to the terminology designating the source met by Alexander's cook in the Land of Darkness. As argued above, it is possible that the Greek world inher- ited the water of life motif from Middle Eastern literatures. However, a ter- minological analysis will show how in Late Antiquity this motif was under- stood and revised in Christian terms. While modern scholars often refer to the magical source with a variety of expressions like "water of life", "fountain of life" or "source of immortality", 25 M. Ringgren, "hāšak", in Theological Dictionary of the Old Testament, William B. Eerdmans Pub- lishing Company, Grand Rapids, Michigan, 1977-2003, vol. V, pp. 255-56. 26 The idea of the Netherworld as location of the water of life has been preserved only in the ver- sions of the tale found in Semitic languages, while it is absent in the Greek Romance. As Mario Casari sug- gested, the Ps. Callisthenes locates the Land of Darkness in the northern lands (M. Casari, "Il viaggio a settentrione: mitografia e geografia dall'età classica al medioevo arabo-persiano", in M. Cassarino, G. Lalomia (eds.), Medioevo Romando e Orientale. Il viaggio nelle letterature romance e orientali, Atti del v Colloquio Internationale Medioevo Romando e Orientale - vii Convegno della Società Italiana di Filologia Romança, Catania-Ragusa, 24-27 settembre 2003, Soveria Mannelli, Rubbettino, pp. 214-215; Idem, "Tramonto settentrionale: glossa a Cor. xviii, 85-86", in M. Bernardini, N. Tornesello (eds.), Studi in onore di Giovanni D'Erme, Napoli, Università di Napoli 'l'Orientale', 2005, pp. 233-243). As I will show else- where, the Land of Darkness is related to the conceptions about the Sun's night course. The ancient lit- eratures possessed essentially two visions concerning the way through which the Sun came back from the setting to the rising place. The first one located it in the Underworld, the second one in the northern lands. This couple of conceptions influenced later traditions about Alexander's journey in the Land of Darkness, which the sources relate either to the realm of the dead or to the northern lands. 27 We can observe the same phenomenon in the tale of Bulüqiyyä, found in the Arabian Nights, which, like the Alexander story, shares some motifs with the old Gilgamesh journey in quest of immor- tality (S. Dalley, "Gilgamesh in the Arabian Nights", JRAS 1 (1991), Royal Asiatic Society, London, pp. 1- 17). In fact, the Arabic tale seems to absorb some motifs which occur in the old myth of Ishtar's Descent to the Underworld (D. Bodi, "Les Milles et Une Nuits et l'Epopée de Gilgamesh", in A. Chraïbi (ed.), Les Milles et Une Nuits en partage, Sinbad/ Actes Sud, Paris, 2004, pp. 407-8).</page><page sequence="11">[il] GILGAMESH QUEST FOR IMMORTALITY 427 none of these expressions does occur in the Greek Romance. In fact, Ree. ß de- scribes the miraculous source as "a source whose waters gleam like light- ning". The only association of this source with the idea of eternal life is due to the fish's resurrection motif which occurs in the tale. The textual associa- tion between the source and the concept of immortality occurs only in the Alexander Song , where the source is referred to as ' yri d-hy '28 "source of life", and ' yri d-my' hy' "source of living water".29 These two expressions are clear- ly derived from the biblical terminology. In fact, both appears in the Hebrew Bible as meqor hayyim ("source of life") and meqor mayim hayyim ("source of living water"), which lxx translates as 7T7]y7ļ Ķc oî)ç and 7ty]Y7) u&amp;octoç Çoîjç. As shown in detail in the following section, similar expressions occur in several passages of the New Testament. It is precisely from the NT that the expres- sion ' yri d-my 9 hy ' apparently derives. In fact, it is by these words that the Peshitta translates the expression "source of the water of life" (nrjyri tou uSoctoç TÎjç Çcúyjç) occurring in Rev. 21:6. Moreover, the Peshitta always trans- lates the biblical common expression "living water" (mayim hayyim/ ii Scop Ç&amp;v) as my ' hy' which in the Syńac Alexander Song designates the water flow- ing out of the source.30 The employ of these specific terms is remarkable, for it shows that in his adaptation of the Greek Alexander tale the author deliberately chooses to use a biblical terminology. This reveals the fact that he understood the tale of the source of life in Christian terms. As a matter of fact, it is not surprising to find a biblical terminology in the Syńac Alexander Song , which is a Christian hom- ily The extant problem concerns the Greek Alexander Romance. In fact, it is not clear whether the "source" found in the Ps. Callisthenes may be related to the "source of living water" occurring in lxx. The problem is to establish if the Greek text intentionally employs the term 7rr¡yy¡ in reference to a Chris- tian imaginary. A basic problem concerns the effective dating of the tale. In fact, whereas its first occurrence is represented by Ree. ß, nothing prevents an 28 The expression is related to the ' ayn al-hayyãt or ma' al-hayyat, which occurs in the Arabic versions of the Alexander tale. For example, see: Tābari, Gãmi ' al-bavãti, Beirut, 1988, p. 289. 29 G.J. Reinink, Das Syrische Alexanderlied, op. cit, pp. 44-47. 30 In the Hebrew Bible and in the NT, "living water" is used both in literal and metaphorical way. Both in Hebrew and Greek, "living water" literally designates a running or moving water, which in the Bible is often connected to purification rituals. In the Moralia, Plutarch explains the reason of such ex- pression: "we commonly say that those waters are 'living' which have most motion and the strongest current" (M or., 957 D). In NT, the expression "living water" - literally meaning running /moving water - is often replaced by that of "water of life" (uScop ty¡&lt; ; Çtoyjç). The two expressions may be considered synonymous. As outlined by Onwundi William, "The expression uScop Çwv implies two concepts: 'water' and 'life'. This is why John alternatively calls living water 'the water of life'". (O. William, The Dialogue on Living Water in John 4:7-15, Extrattum ex Dissertatione ad Doctoratum in Facúltate Theologiae, Pontificia Universitas Urbaniana, Facultas Theologiae, Rome, 1999, p. 3). This explains why Rec. iii of Syriac Alexander Song refers to the magical source both as "source of living water" and "source of the water of life" Cyn' d-my' d-hy') (G.J. Reinink, Das Syrische Alexanderlied, op. cit., p. 45). For an analysis of the relationship between the two expressions "living water" and "water of life", see: J. E.

However, as I will discuss later, combining the motif of the washing in- to the source with that of the fish resurrection confers on the tale a strong symbolic value, which points at least in direction of a Late Antique Christian interpretation of the matter, in relation to the theme of renovation through baptism. Water of Life in the Hebrew Bible and in the New Testament In the Hebrew Bible, the expressions meqor mayim hayyim, "source of living water", and meqor hayyim , "source of life", are used allegorically to indicate both God and wisdom. In Jer. 2:13, Yahweh is just described as a "source of living water" (Peshitta translates: mbw" d-my' hy') opposed to broken cisterns unable to hold water, which represent idols. The same association occurs in Jer. 17:13 (Pesh: ut supra). The expression meqor hayyim occurs four times in Proverbs (10:11; 13:14; 14:27; 16:22. Pesh. always translates as mbw" d-hy'), where it is employed as an allegorical way to designate wisdom. "Source of life" or of "living water" are features also occurring in the NT. In the story of the encounter between Jesus and the woman of Samaria, found in John 4:7-26. At v. 4:10 Jesus speaks first of a "living water" (uScop Ç&amp;v; Pesh: my ' hy'), then at v. 4:14 of "a source of water springing up into eternal life". By these two expressions Jesus intends to make a clear distinction be- tween the water of Jacob's well, from which the woman usually draws on, and the water which He can grant. According to Jesus' words whoever drinks the latter will never be thirsty. In the same way, in John 7:38 Jesus promises that "rivers of living water" shall flow from the belly of the faithfuls. The water of life motif occurs above all in the Book of Revelation, where it has a strong eschatological connotation. As outlined by Goppelt, "while the dwellers on the earth (8:13; 11:10 etc.) are deprived of necessary water, those redeemed from the earth (14:3) are given the water of life to drink in the con- summation".31 According to Rev. 7:17, martyrs will be lead by the Lamb "to sources of living water". The same promise of the water of life as reward for righteous is renewed in Rev. 21:6, which states that God will freely give to drink from the source of the water of life (ex ttjç 7ry)Y7jç tou uSoctoç tt¡&lt;; Çcoîjç; Pesh: mn 'yn' d-my ' hy') to him who is thirsty. In the same way Rev. 22:17 claims: "And he who is thirsty, let him come. And whosoever will, let him take of the water of life (uScop Çwîjç; Pesh: my ' hy') freely". Finally, Rev. 22:1 states that a river of water of life (7tot&lt;x(xÓ&lt;; uSoctoç Çcoîjç; Pesh: nhr' d-my ' hy') flows from the throne of God. 31 L. Goppelt, "u&amp;cop", op. cit., p. 325.</page><page sequence="13">[l3] GILGAMESH QUEST FOR IMMORTALITY 429 Water of Life in Extra-Biblical Literature Water of life frequently features in extra-biblical literature, where it is often employed metaphorically to designate two main concepts: knowledge and baptism.32 Concerning the first point, in many texts occurs the idea that drinking from the source of living water means to acquire wisdom. In the Odes of Solomon , which are linked to the Jewish sapiential milieu , living water (my' hy') represents just divine knowledge.33 Not surprisingly, a similar con- ception is present in some Gnostic ambients. In Heracleon s commentary on the Gospel of John, quoted by Origen, the living water mentioned in John 4:7- 26 represents the knowledge which God offers to the Samaritan woman.34 Moreover, some Gnostic sects identified this water with the waters that are above the firmament described in Gen. 1:1. 35 In many cases living water was considered the way to reach gnosis.36 However, in early Christianity and in Late Antiquity the expression "living water" is mostly employed in reference to baptism. For example, Chap. 7 of Didache prescribes living water to accomplish the baptismal ceremony (7u).37 This association is particularly interesting for the present study. In fact, as al- ready observed by Reinink, in the Syriac Alexander Song the act by which Alexander intends to acquire immortality is always designated by the verb sh' 32 However, in one of the manuscripts of Qumran (lQHa xvi 4-23) the expressions "spring of life" (mqwr hyym) and "spring of living water" ( mbw ' mym hyym ) occur as part of a complex of images de- scribing a garden of deliciousnesses, which clearly recalls the Eden. The description is probably due to the association between the "spring of living water" and the fountain watering the whole earth, which - according to Gen 2:6 - is located into the Eden. This idea is confirmed by the fact that in this descrip- tion another feature of Gen 2:9 appears, namely the tree of life, that in Qumran text takes roots from the living waters (F. G. Martínez, E. J. C. Tigchelaar (eds.), The Dead Sea Scrolls Study Edition, Brill, Leiden-Boston-Köln, 1997, vol. 1, pp 180-83). This description anticipates the well-known iconographie representation of the fountain of life, which is often portrayed as a spring from which flow the four rivers proceeding out of Eden (Gen. 2:10). These conceptions partially explain why in the Jewish version of the Alexander tale, Alexander s quest is not for the source of immortality but for the Eden, which he reach- es by following the course of a river. 33 For example Ode 11 affirms: "And speaking waters touched my lips - From the fountain of the Lord generously - And so I drank and became intoxicated - From the living water that does not die - And my intoxication was not with ignorance - But I abandoned vanity - And turned towards the Most High, my God - And was enriched by His favours". The same association between living water and knowledge appears also in odes 6 and 30 (J. H. Charlesworth (ed.), The Odes of Solomon. The Syriac Texts, Schol- ars Press, Missoula, 1977, pp. 28-33, 49-59» 113-15)- 34 E. Corsini, Origene, Commento al Vangelo di Giovanni, Utet, Torino, 1968, pp. 74-83. 35 L.

It looks possible that this replacement is somehow related to the conception of a source of life as source of wisdom ob- served in Proverbs and in extra-biblical literature. 37 P.

For ex- ample it often occurs in the work of Ephrem the Syrian.39 An occurrence of the verb sh' significant for the present study is repre- sented by the above mentioned legend of the baptism of Constantine. Here the Emperor, suffering from leprosy, has a dream during which the Apostles tell him: "Sylvester will show you the source of life ( m'yn ' d-hy') and will clean you with the living water ( my ' hy'), which will heal your body and your soul".40 Sylvester submits the Emperor to the baptismal ritual, which restores him to health and provides him with a new skin. As in the tale of Alexander, the Constantine legend accords to the living water curative and regenerating properties.41 In another version of the legend found in Eusebius' Life of Costantine, Constantine wishes to be baptised in his last days. Here the bap- tismal ceremony is significantly called "the seal which brings immortality" (iv. 61-64).42 In the perspective of the baptismal symbolism, the association between liv- ing water and immortality appears more and more clear. In fact, as men- tioned above, in extra-biblical literature living water is constantly associated to baptism, namely the ritual ceremony which according to many writings grants immortality. Commenting the above mentioned passage of the Di- dache , Everett Ferguson appropriately observes: Baptize has its normal meaning of "immerse". This was to be done "in living (running or moving) water" [. . .] Running water was called "living" because it had motion. Such water was the appropriate place for an act that imparted life (spiritual). "Living" or "life" is an important concept for the compiler of the work. Christians serve a living God (6.3) by walking in the way of life (1-4) and giving thanks for life and immortality (eternal life) made known through Jesus (9:3; 10-3).43 A direct association between living water and regeneration occurs in the Pseudo-Clementine literature. It is in the living water of a river or of a spring that, according to the Epistle of Peter to James , the regeneration of the right- 38 G. J.

How- ever, Justin does not employ the expression "water of life" in reference to God, but rather to baptism; similarly the broken cisterns do not describe idols, as in Jer. 2:13, but the Jewish ablutions which can clean only the body. Blaming this practice, Justin claims the necessity of a baptism in the water of life, which can grant a full regeneration (14). 46 The gnostic Gospel of Philip contains a very interesting passage concerning baptism: People who say they will first die and then arise are mistaken. If they do not first re- ceive resurrection while they are alive, once they have died they will receive nothing. Just so it is said of baptism, "Great is baptism!" For if one receives it, one will live (79). 47 As the reader can see, here the baptismal act is expressly linked to the resur- rection. This association is very significant for the present study. In fact, whereas the text does not mention the living water, it attributes to the bap- tismal water the capacity of granting the resurrection. In the work called On the Holy Theophany, the baptism is referred to as "the fountain of life". The baptismal doctrine expressed here is very interesting: God has sent his Son to wash the World with the water and the Spirit [...] If, therefore, man has become immortal, he will al- so be God. And if he is made God by water and the Holy Spirit after the regeneration of the laver he is found to be also joint-heir with Christ after the resurrection from the dead.48 For the present purpose, it is crucial to observe that the text confers some kind of magical properties on the baptismal water, allegorically called "the fountain of life". This water is linked with the Holy Spirit and has the power of making men become immortal, similar to God and joint with Christ after the resurrection. To conclude this section concerning the relation between water of life and baptism, it is opportune to produce two examples from Syriac literature. The 44 Trans, in: A. Robert, J.

At v. 5 of Hymn xii Ephraem claims: "Baptism is the well-spring of life ( b'r' d-hy' m'mwdyt'), - which the Son of God opened by His Life".49 This verse certifi- cates that Syriac literature knew the use of the fountain of life as metaphor of baptism. This conception appears also in the work of Narsai. In fact in Homily xxi the poet states: "Our Lord has opened up for us the sweet spring of Baptism, and has given our race to drink of the sweetness of life immor- tal".50 As the reader can see, here the idea occurs that baptismal water can grants immortality. To sum up, "living water", "source of life" etc. are common features oc- curring in late antique extra-biblical literature. As shown above, they may be related to diverse concepts. However, the most common association appears to be that with baptismal ritual. In the perspective of the present study this association is very important, since it recalls two main points occurring in the Alexander tale. Firstly, the common idea that baptism has the power of grant- ing immortality may be related to the same properties attributed to the source of living water met by Alexander's cook. Secondly, the action of the immersion into the source, which should confer the immortality to Alexan- der, appears to be related to the baptismal ceremony. Even if the motif of the water with immortal properties has some an- tecedents in the ancient Near-Eastern literatures, there is no doubt that a Christian reader of 4th-5th c. would probably have understood it in relation to baptism. The use of the motif in relation with Christian themes is likely if we consider the character of Ree. ß. Differently from Ree. a, which has a strong Egyptian character and includes many references to the cult of Ammon, Rec. ß presents clear traces of Christian censure. Corinne Jouanno has appropriately observed: Le narrateur s'est en effet efforcé d'éliminer du Roman les éléments le plus ostensible- ment païens [...] Que l'auteur de cette version nouvelle des aventures d'Alexandre ait été chrétien, l'époque même de composition du texte aurait suffit à le laisser présumer, et la phrase finale de l'œuvre nous en offre confirmation: [. . .] "De la mort d'Alexandre à l'incarnation du Verbe de Dieu par la Vierge, trois cent vingt-quatre années se sont écoulées" (ni. 35). 51 Therefore, the author of Rec. ß is likely to have been a Christian, who wrote for Christian readers, as it appears from his censure of the elements connect- ed to pagan cults.

In the next sections I will show that similar considerations can be done concerning the fish resurrection motif. From the Snake's Shed Skin to the Fish's Resurrection In the Babylonian epic, Gilgamesh fails to keep the plant of youth because of the intervention of a snake, which takes the plant away. The magical proper- ties of the plant of youth make the snake slough its skin and accomplish its regeneration. Ancient cultures often regard the snake as a symbol of immor- tality, a conception that is evidently linked to its properties of skin regenera- tion.52 Therefore, it is not surprising to find such motif in the story of Gil- gamesh quest for immortality In view of its symbolic value, the presence of a salt fish instead of a serpent in the Alexander tale does not set any problem. In fact, ancient liter- atures often employ fishes, as well as snakes, as symbols of immortality.53 Such idea is present in Egypt, Mesopotamia and Syria from very ancient times. On the contrary, a large diffusion of the fish as symbol of immortali- ty arose in the Greek world only after Hellenism and with the rising of the Roman Empire. Finally the symbol was adopted by early Christianity and was largely employed in early Christian literature and art as symbol of Jesus or of the faithful.54 It is well known that in Patristic writings the employ of the Greek term LX0ÚÇ ("fish") is related to the acronym Tyjcrouç Xpicrróç 0eou fYióç Sconfļp (Jesus Christ, God's Son, Saviour), as stated by Augustine (De civitate Dei , xviii. 23) in reference to the similar acrostic occurring in the Oracula Sibylli- na. The symbol is often associated to a number of concepts, among which the most frequent are baptism and Eucharist. Previous scholars, as Dölger55 and Cumont,56 argued that Christianity inherited the fish symbolism from paganism. Others, like Scheftelowitz,57 Eisler,58 Goodenough59 and more re- 52 K. R.

Another problematic discussed by previous scholars is whether this symbolism was originally used in reference to bap- tism. While refraining from resuming such discussions, in this section I will draw the attention to those texts which show a large diffusion of the fish symbol in the early years of Christianity and in Late Antiquity. In accordance with the purpose of the present study, I will principally focus on those sources in which the fish symbolism is related to baptism, because of the possible connection with the motif of the fish washed into the source de- scribed in the Alexander tale. Some early rabbinical texts describe the faithful as a fish swimming in the waters of Torah. The well known sentence of Tertullian: "But we little fish, according to our Ichthys Jesus Christ, are born in the water, nor are we saved in any other manner than by remaining in the water"61 is probably to be re- ferred to this Jewish symbolism. Central in Tertullians statement is the idea that the salvation is associated to water; this water evidently refers to baptism. In fact, as remarked by Morey, Tertullian s theological intent is to show the necessity of baptism.62 In agreement with his own purpose, the fish symbol- ism is here associated both to Christians (referred to as pisciculi) and Christ (called In his work named De Schismate Donatistarum, Optatus Milevitanus states: This is the fish, which in baptism is put into the waters of the font by the invocation, so that what had been water is called also piscina from piseis. The name of this fish in its Greek form contains in one appellation by virtue of its single letters a host of sacred names, 1X0 YE, which is in Latin, Jesus Christus deifilius Salvator.63 The etymology that Optatus provides for the Latin term piscina (which according to him derives from the term piseis because of the link between the baptismal source and the fish as symbol of Christ) is obviously wrong. However, it denotes the strong conceptual link that an early Christian author established between the two elements. A similar direct association occurs in a work called Explanatio nominum Domini by Orientus. The author gives the following explanation for the attribution to Jesus of the epithet piseis: Piseis , natus aquis, actor baptismatis ipse est , "The Fish, born from water, is Himself the founder of baptism". To summarize, it seems that in Late Antiquity the use of the term fish in reference to Christ, or to Christians, was often connected with the baptismal 60 G. G.

It is possible to find such connexion both in lit- erature and art. In the first case a good example is in the words of Paulino of Nola ( Epist . xiii. 2), who refers to Christ as "the true bread and the fish of the living water".65 The Latin expression aqua viva, which designates living wa- ter, has a parallel in the Latin Bible translation by Paulino's contemporary Jerome. In fact, it is exactly by this expression that the Vulgate translates many of the above-mentioned passages concerning living waters. Concerning the association between fish symbolism and living water in art, Lois Drewer has suggested that in the iconography of Early Christian church- es and baptisteries fishes were used to identify the living water. Drewer com- pares what he calls "the fish pond" with two others iconographie representa- tions of the living water: the fountain of life and the four rivers of Paradise.66 Therefore, it may be assumed that the idea connecting fishes with baptismal living waters was fairly common in early years of Christianity and in Late Antiquity. To sum up, considering the strong allegorical value of both elements of the fish and the living water, we can clearly perceive what the motif of a salt fish coming back to life when washed in a miraculous source could represent at the eyes of a Late Antiquity reader. The Fish's Resurrection: Previous Occurrences The motif of the salt fish which comes back to life, occurring in the Alexan- der tale, can be considered as referred twice to Jesus figure, through the fish symbol itself and through the motif of the resurrection. It is clear that in Late Antiquity the fish's resurrection motif had a strong symbolical connotation for a Christian reader. In this perspective it is not inappropriate to quote the so-called Sermo Sancti Sevenani Episcopi , which contains this mysterious state- ment: "For if Christ were not the fish, He would never have risen from the dead".67 It is important to remark that the occurrence of the fish's resurrec- tion motif is not specific of the Alexander tale, but has at least three clear an- tecedents. The first occurrence of the motif goes back to the Greek classical litera- ture, specifically to Herodotus' Histońes. Herodotus reports that the Persian satrap of the Cherosonesus, Aracteus, plunged the votive offerings from the tomb of the Greek hero Protesilaos at Elaious (ix. 116). Later, when the Athe- nians captured Aracteus, a miracle appeared to his jailer: the salt fishes that he was roasting began to squirm. Then Aracteus himself explained the sign: 64 Ibid.., p. 423. 65 Ibid.., p. 412. 66 L.

(Hist., ix, 120)68 Obviously, Christian symbolism cannot play any role in Herodotus' work. However, it is significant that in this passage of the Histońes the same term occurs, which designates the salt fish in the Alexander tale: Tapfyoę. At the same time, it is important to note that here the salt fishes do not resuscitate at contact with the water. On the contrary, this dynamic appears in the apocryphal work named Trac- tatu de Pueńtia lesu Secundum Thomam. Here we find the description of a mirac- ulous act performed by Jesus during his childhood (1.4). According to the tale, when he was three years old Jesus made a salt fish (piscem unum aridum) come back to life, by plunging it into a basin and ordering it to cast up salt and to walk into the water (Reiecta sal tuum quod h abes, et ambula in aqua).69 It is difficult to avoid the idea that the purpose of the author is to make intention- al reference to Christian symbols, such as Christ's resurrection and baptism. The same intention clearly appears in the so-called Actus Vercellenses.70 At the end of the work we find the apostle Peter trying to persuade a crowd that he is a minister of the living God (ministro dei vivi). People ask him a sign and Peter takes a salt fish (sarda) and plunges it into a fishpond saying: "Live and swim like a fish". Suddenly, the fish comes back to life and starts swimming (vixit et natare coepit). As outlined by Janet E. Spittler, the episode clearly al- ludes to some Christian themes: The resurrection of the dead is represented in the resurrection of the fish; Peter's first career as fisherman and second life as "fisher of men" are referenced; the bath of bap- tism has its counterpart in the revivifying plunge taken by the sarda; and the use of the fish as a symbol of both Christ and Christians is surely at play.71 Comparing the above passages it clearly appears that their common feature is the motif of the salt fish which comes back to life. However, it is possible to establish a clear distinction between them by considering the presence - or the absence - of the water motif. In this case, Herodotus' tale is different from those found in the Tractatu de Pueńtia lesu Secundum Thomam and in the Actus 68 Translation by J. E. Spittler, Animals in the Apocryphal Acts of the Apostles , Mohr Siebeck, Tübin- gen, 2008, p. 150. 69 Latin text in: C. de Tischendorf, Evangelia Apocrypha, Hermann Mendelssohn, Lipsiae, 1876, p. 164-65. 70 The name, meaning "the Acts from Vercelli", derives from the fact that the work is extant in a codex found in the Chapter Library (Biblioteca Capitolare) in Vercelli (manuscript n. clviii). The work is often referred to as the apocryphal Acts of Peter. On the history of the work see: M.

It appears possible that the element of the water as an active com- ponent in the fish's resurrection dynamic was added to emphasize the Chris- tian allegorical value of the tale. As discussed above, water, as central compo- nent of baptismal ceremony, was often considered to have renovation properties. This suggestion presupposes that Herodotus' story concerning Protesilaus was known in Late Antiquity. As suggested by Spittler, this possi- bility is fairly probable. In fact, the character of Protesilaus enjoyed a literary revivification in the first centuries of the Christian Era.72 Water of Life and Fish's Resurrection in the Alexander Tale The texts exploited in the previous section show that the fish's resurrection motif was fairly common in Late Antiquity. Moreover, fish and living water were perceived as two elements with a strong Christian connotation. Is it correct to search in this context the origins of the episode told in the Alexan- der tale? A possible objection to this suggestion is that both motifs of the magical water and the fish's resurrection have antecedents going back to the pre-Christian period. In fact, on the one hand, ancient Near Eastern litera- tures knew the idea of a water with the power of raising dead, on the other hand, the fish's resurrection motif already occurs in Herodotus' work. The crucial point is to establish when the two motifs have been joined together, giving birth to the dynamic of the salt fish resurrecting when washed in the source of life. As said above, such combination first appears in the Christian literature, probably with the intention of adding emphasis on the theme of baptism as a way to renovation. Therefore, it seems reasonable to assume that the episode occurring in the Alexander tale is an original product of Christianity. Even if Christians probably inherited by Judaism both elements of the living water and of the fish, the dynamic told in the Alexander tale is comprehensible only if read in Christian terms. In fact, the reasons of the combination of the two motifs would remain obscure, if not considered in the perspective of an author who wishes to allude to Christian themes. Moreover, except for the Alexander tale, the dynamic of the fish resurrecting when sprinkled with the water of life only appears in the above mentioned Christian texts. The reference to Christian themes is particularly emphasized in the Syriac Alexander Song. In fact, the author deliberately makes use of a Biblical termi- nology to designate the magical water of the source. Moreover, the use of the verb sh' to describe the act which should grant immortality clearly shows the intention of the author to allude to the baptismal ceremony. It looks clear that the Syriac author wished to emphasize the allegorical dimension of the tale found in Ree. ß. The Syńac Alexander Song represents a very explicit proof 72 Ibid., pp. 150-51.</page><page sequence="22">438 TOMMASO TESEI [22] of the fact that in Late Antiquity the Alexander tale was understood in Chris- tian terms. However, it is not necessary to await the 7th c. to find such prove. In fact, our suggestion is indirectly corroborated by the Jewish literature, and name- ly by the Babylonian Talmud. As previously mentioned, Tamid 32a-32b con- tains a version of the tale of Alexander's quest for immortality which depends upon that found in Ps. Callisthenes.73 The talmudic version presents some dif- ferences as for the tale found in the Alexander Romance. Among these one is very interesting for the present study, namely the absence of the fish's resur- rection motif. In fact, in Tamid 32a-32b Alexander himself washes a fish in the waters of a pit. However, the fish does not come back to life, but its fragrance indicates to Alexander that he is in presence of a water directly coming from Eden. The tale goes on with the hero's failure of the attempt to enter the Eden. Significantly this Jewish version of the tale does not mention the res- urrection of the fish. Given the strong symbolic value of the motif, it is al- most impossible not to consider its absence within the Talmudic version of the tale as the result of a deliberate censure of the Christian element. Later evidence strengthens this suggestion: in fact, in a Hebrew version of the Alexander Romance edited by Gasper it is not a fish that comes back to life, but rather some birds caught by Alexander's hunters.74 The substitution of the fish by the birds may be explained by the exigence of removing an element too explicitly evoking the theme of Christ's resurrection. To sum up, the episode told in the Alexander tale presents a motif fairily known in Late Antiquity, which reflects some Christian conceptions widely spread in this historical period. As in the Tractatu de Pueritia lesu Secundum Thomam and in the Actus Vercellenses , the episode of the water of life must be understood as alluding to the Christian themes of baptism and resurrection. In this view, the reasons which caused the replacement of the snake's shed skin motif by that of the fish's resurrection appear more and more clear. While the modalities of transmission of the elements from the ancient Babylonian epic to the legends concerning Alexander have never been exten- sively studied, some scholars have suggested the existence of a late antique version of the Gilgamesh Epic.75 In the absence of a thorough study concern- ing the matter, we can suppose that if the story of the Gilgamesh quest for immortality was known in Late Antiquity, perhaps as "an oral tradition in which the name Alexander replaced the more ancient hero's name" as van Bladel suggests,76 it is quite clear the interest of a storyteller in replacing the snake's shed skin motif by that of the fish's resurrection.

In fact, as said before, noth- ing prevents a diffusion of the tale before the redaction of Ree. ß. However, the interest of introducing in the tale the fish's resurrection motif is compre- hensible only if considered as an attempt to allude to Christian themes, through the use of symbols largely diffused in Late Antiquity. Then it is rea- sonable to consider the water of life episode, at least in the form we know, as a product of the Late Antique Christian literature. Conclusions While Occidental world "discovered" the Epic of Gilgamesh only in the second half of 19th c., elements deriving from the ancient Babylonian saga steadily occurred in Eastern Mediterranean and Near Eastern literatures. Here, the name of Gilgamesh occurs several time until the Middle-Ages. For example, we find it in the work of the Greek naturalist Aelian (3th c. CE) under the form of nXyocfxoç;77 then in the writings of the Nestorian bishop Theodore bar Konai (9th c CE);78 and finally in the Kitab al-rahmafi al-tibb wa-al-hikma of the Arab writer al-Suyūtī (15th c. CE), where the name of G.lģ.mīš appears.79 Since the study of Bruno Meissner concerning the points of contact be- tween Gilgamesh and Alexander stories, several scholars have pointed out some evidences which strengthen the possibility that an Aramaic version of the Ancient Babylonian Epic circulated in the Middle East until Late Antiqui- ty. In 1958 Grelot published a paper, where he pointed out several correspon- dences between the cosmographie features appearing both in the Gilgamesh and in the Enoch journeys.80 In 1971, Milik discovered a version of the Book of the Giants among the Aramaic fragments of 1 Enoch recovered from the Dead Sea Scrolls. In these fragments the names of hwbbš (Humbaba) and of glgmys (Gilgamesh) appeared.81 In 1993, John C. Reeves suggested that the name of Atamblsh, occurring in the fragments of the Manichaean version of the Book of the Giants published by Sundermann, corresponds to that of Utnapish- tim.82 More recently, Stephanie Dalley has published several works concern- ing the presence of some correspondence between the story of Gilgamesh and the tale of Bulüqiyyä found in the Arabian Nights.83 77 Aelian, On Animáis, xii, 21. 78 M.

Therefore, the case of the tale of Alexander and the source of life is not isolated. Significantly for the present study, the motifs coming from the ancient Epic have almost always been adapted to the own scope of the text in which they are found. For ex- ample, in the Dead Sea Scrolls fragments, Gilgamesh is identified as a Giant, which means that the ancient hero's name was inserted in a vision of human history based on Biblical conceptions. Likely, Theodore bar Konai inserts the name of Gilgamesh in a list of antediluvian kings, chronologically based on the time elapsing between Peleg and Abraham. The tale of Alexander and the fountain of life analysed in this paper does not represent an exception. As I have shown, the replacement of the the snake's shed skin motif by that of the fish's resurrection must be understood as an insertion of Christian elements in the tale. This replacement does not alter the structure of the story, which maintains on the broad outlines of the ancient Gilgamesh quest for immortality. However, the introduction of the new elements of the fish and the water of life confers the tale a new allegor- ical dimension. The reference to the Christian themes of baptism and resur- rection implies also a new moral dimension within the Alexander tale. As ar- gued above, both tales share the same moral teaching: immortality is not reserved to humans, who must accept the divine will. However, the refer- ence to baptism and to Christ's resurrection introduces in the tale the hope for a future life, something that was unknown to the Babylonian epic. This is particularly evident in the Syńac Alexander Song , which represents a real Christian homily. As remarked by Reinink, the author's purpose is to demon- strate that immortality must not be sought in this world, namely in the Land of Darkness, but rather in the hope of a future life in the heavenly king- dom.84 In conclusion, it appears that the ancient story of Gilgamesh quest for immortality persisted in Late Antiquity, under the form of the tale of Alexander and the water of life. However, within this tradition some ele- ments of innovation were added, which conferred on the tale the character of Christian legend.85 84 G. J.
