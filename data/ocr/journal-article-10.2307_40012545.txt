<plain_text><page sequence="1">RELIGIOUS SYMBOLS AND THE VOYAGE OF ANALOGY ROBIN ATTFIELD University College, Cardiff Religious language, if it is to be comprehensible, must navigate the narrows between twin disasters, the Scylla of using terms in a sense appropriate to humans, or anthropomorphism, and the Charybdis of using terms in an unrecognisable sense, or equivocation. Drifting against the Scylla of anthropomorphism it fails to be appropriate to its transcendent object, and thus to be religious; sucked into Charybdis' pool it loses all relation to the ordinary meanings of terms, and fails to be language. Intent on charting a secure middle passage, philosophers of religion from Aquinas onwards have developed a theory of analogy, on which the meanings of religious symbols are neither ordinary nor extraordinary, but bear a knowable relation to ordinary meanings. On this theory the love of God is to the nature of God as human love is to human nature; understood like this, it is held, expressions like "the love of God" carry a sense both clear and symbolic, and can play a significant role in the language of belief, devotion and doctrine. This theory has always been thought to have its difficulties, and some have thought them insuperable. Thus if we have no understanding of God's nature there are two unknowns, not one, the symbol to be decoded (the love of God) and the nature of God. If so, the theory is no help, the love of God is irredeemably incomprehensible, and those who talk of it capsize in a whirlpool of mysticism, unless they can undergird the theory. Others, finding believers constantly to change their tack when challenged over unfavourable evidence, ask what possible state of affairs, if any, would be incompatible with their claims; for, if there were no such state of affairs, the claims of all believers would drift towards Charybdis' vortex, dying the "death of a thousand qualifications". And yet others, such as the positivists, have required terms to be so understood as to connote everyday observable items or qualities only; if so, the theory serves no purpose, terms cannot bear a special sense, and there is no alternative to shipwreck on Scylla.

Printed in the Netherlands.</page><page sequence="2">226 Robin Attfield In a recent book,1 Humphrey Palmer presents a theory of analogy in an extended form. In this form, he holds, the theory is acceptable, and indeed rescues from incoherence the language of devotion: at the same time it proves fatal to all theological reasoning and to efforts to expound, to oneself or to others, a system of doctrine. I am, however, constrained to contest these conclusions. The extended theory seems rather to be fatal to the language of liturgy, prayer and devotion as well as to that of theology, and thus to fail to make sense of religious language. It is my conviction, however, that some religious beliefs and indeed some religious doctrines are intelligible and coherent, and that the traditional theory can after all assist those who sail these waters. So indeed can many of the insights of Dr. Palmer's engaging book, to which my indebtedness will be evident. I begin by recording agreement with Dr. Palmer over the weakness both of an objection to the theory of analogy and of an argument often propounded in its defence. I then consider whether all language about God can have a qualified and analogical sense and whether none of it can be known to be literal, and conclude that there must be some known literal statement(s) if we are to follow the analogical ones. I investigate how far statements about God as creator help, and how the traditional theory can perform its intended function. Finally, I explore the implications for philosophy of religion, for the discourse of various religions, and for various theological doctrines. The problem of religious language, let it be granted, is insistent and universal. It is universal because it affects not only Christians and other theists, but also those (like some Hindus) who ascribe ordinary predicates to the Absolute, and those (such as Buddhists) who do so to Nirvana; and not only those such as students of literature who wish to comprehend religious usage, but also those who, like atheists, need a clear idea of what it is they reject. It is insistent because it is most unlikely that language about transcendent items such as God, the Absolute or Nirvana, can, on the whole, carry the sense it covers when used of everyday objects, and because if its special sense is inexplicable it conveys no meaning whether to devotees or to outsiders. To use ordinary terms in a special sense that cannot be explained is to talk nonsense; as Dr. Palmer remarks (p. 34), "It is the possibility of explaining, to oneself or another, that shows we have a meaning for the term." As he goes on to say, "Language is public. It is a vehicle for communication from one to another. A private, indefinable, 'mystical' language would not be a language at all." To avod such a conclusion about religious language, as he points out, a theory is needed to explain the special sense which terms acquire in religious use.</page><page sequence="3">Religious Symbols and the Voyage of Analogy 227 Some followers of Wittgenstein, however, hold that the special sense is explained enough by remarking its special religious context. To discover the meaning of a word, they say, we need to attend to its use; and that is all we need to attend to. For if a term is used in the Language Game of religion, that Language Game will supply us with its meaning and its logic. We need not find, and we cannot find, some meaning which terms have irrespective of their use in a Language Game or have outside of Language Games, which is then qualified when the term is put to a special use. The meanings which terms carry when used in a Language Game which is actually played cannot be discredited en masse, so the perils of Scylla and Charybdis as depicted in this essay are illusory. The theory of analogy is hence redundant, as there is no problem; and also unacceptable, as religious language does not carry a qualified or analogical sense. Put like this, the Wittgensteinian objection to the theory of analogy does not rest on an analysis of "meaning" in terms of "use", though it is consonant with such an analysis. With Mr. Michael Durrant I have contended elsewhere2 that such &amp;n analysis cannot succeed, and that the concept of the meaning of a sentence is independent of that of its use. Nevertheless it could still be true that meanings vary in some rough and approximate way with use, and are learned from their use. As Dr. Palmer acknowledges (p. 118), they are seldom learned from definitions. This would not show, however, that there is a separate sense for each type of use, or that the senses are unrelated. Nor would it show that all or even most of the uses to which terms are put are in order. There would only be separate and unrelated senses for words used in more than one linguistic activity where those activities constituted separate systems of life and thought unrelated to each other. But science and religion, for example, as Dr. Palmer aptly puts it, are not separate worlds "circling in empty logical space at unbridgeable distances from the other worlds": "the traffic between them all is heavy and continuous. None of the departments of life could exist entirely on its own" (p. 115). Both science and religion may be granted their specialised vocabulary, but only if it can be explained by its links with "everyday language already understood." If so, then there are, often enough, external checks on the usage of a given Language Game; terms used in a special sense in religion, such as "father", "pray", and "love", bear a sense related to their ordinary sense outside religion, and there is a risk that, if they do not, religious language is systematically out of order. So a theory of the special sense remains needed, and one at that which can explain in what ways the ordinary sense needs to be qualified when the special sense is employed. Moreover those Language Game theorists who suppose otherwise are prone to steer so wide of the ordinary sense of terms in the name of preserving their special religious sense that they are swallowed into equivocation and its attendant vortex.</page><page sequence="4">228 Robin Attfield Now Dr. Palmer's rejection of the position of the Language Game theorists embodies reasons (the relatedness of linguistic activities and the way terms in religion are often borrowed from everyday language) for adopting the conclusion that religious terms carry special and qualified senses which are neither identical with common and garden senses nor wholly unrelated to them. Accordingly, another argument for this conclusion, which he also considers, may fortunately be regarded as redundant. That argument (let us call it the Imperfection Argument) runs as follows: "God, it is argued, is infinite and perfect in every way, whereas the world we live in is imperfect and very limited. We are part of that world, and share its limitations, and it is on our experience of that world that all our knowledge and ideas are originally based. Human thought therefore is finite and imperfect too; ... a fatal flaw when humans think about the infinite, the all-perfect, the divine. Here their conceptions must have an intrinsic inadequacy. God cannot be comprehended properly in ordinary human terms" (p. 26). This argument is, as Dr. Palmer points out, invalid. Not everything finite is imperfect; a limited being might have adequate ideas, at least on occasion, and hence, possibly, in religion. Besides, it will not do to say that the idea of something infinite must itself be infinite, any more than to say that the idea of a mile must itself have length. Indeed as far as the argument goes, people might sometimes have an adequate idea of God's nature. The Imperfection Argument, then, does not establish that religious terms have a qualified sense, nor can it begin to show that the theory of analogy expounds this sense, though this does not prevent Dr. Palmer describing it as "the only known reason for accepting the theory of analogy" (pp. 65, 81). If it were successful, it would prove that we can know that God understands his own attributes (this must be granted if the premises are to be relied on), but that we ourselves, express it as we may, can never understand the true sense in which they apply to him (for this is the supposed conclusion). But no argument can prove all this, for the two propositions apparently proved are inconsistent. For if we can never understand the predicates which apply to God, we cannot in the first place understand the claim that God is infinite and perfect, or anything that follows about what God understands. If, on the other hand, we can grasp some of these things, then our understanding cannot be imperfect in every way. Certainly Dr. Palmer is mistaken in holding that the Imperfection Argument is the only reason for holding a theory on which religious language carries a qualified sense; for his own reply to the Language Game theorists make it clear that many religious terms are borrowed from everyday language and adapted to fit their new use, while he rejects the</page><page sequence="5">Religious Symbols and the Voyage of Analogy 229 view that such a qualified use cannot be explained. I also believe that he is mistaken in holding that the Imperfection Argument is the only ground for accepting the theory of analogy in particular. Nevertheless the above critique of its weaknesses is derived, in all but its details, from his own (pp. 61, 70f.). As he puts it, "to state the deficiencies of human reasoning so strongly is actually to claim to know a lot about divinity, a claim which undercuts itself." We should, however, remember that the claim is only known to undercut itself if the premise about human finitude is allowed to show that all our ideas in theology are defective. The wielder of the Imperfection Argument does indeed undermine his own position: those who reject it can still, for all that we have so far seen, consistently claim to know a little about God's nature. As we have seen, the theory of analogy is an attempt to explain the sense of the predicates used in referring to God by invoking three other items: God's nature, human qualities and human nature. We have already seen that, if God's nature is unknown, the theory is nullified, as it would then be a device to explain the unknown by the unknown. To this it should be added that the same applies if remarks about God's nature bear only a qualified sense. For, on the theory, these are the remarks which tell us what is special and qualified about other remarks about God, and how they are accordingly to be taken. So if they are themselves qualified, then short of some other standard-setting proposition being presented we cannot understand the sense either of these remarks about God's nature or of any of the others about his qualities. The theory, then, depends on some statements about God being unqualified and literal: if all statements about God are analogical, the theory of analogy collapses. This is pointed out by Dr. Palmer as an objection to the Imperfection Argument (p. 61); it can only start if at least one statement about God is known to be literally true. Dr. Palmer himself believes that there may be some literal statements about God, and that they may be the ones employed in setting up the theory of analogy; but he does not think that we can tell which ones the literal statements are (p. 71). But if we cannot tell which statements, if any, are unqualified and literal, we cannot rely on any statement to set up the theory or to set the standard for understanding such statements as carry a qualified sense. So the theory would be, at best, of no use to us in this present life; we cannot use it to discover the sense of religious symbols. Moreover, since without an explanatory theory, as Dr. Palmer acknowledges elsewhere, religious language is of uncertain sense, and since the theory would be useless unless at least one religious predicate has a known sense, it follows that either we can identify such a predicate or religious language is in fact</page><page sequence="6">230 Robin Attfield incomprehensible. But if it is incomprehensible it is no language at all. For its users cannot expound it either to others or to themselves, and do not know what they mean. Why, then, can we not identify unqualified and literal statements about God? In the first place, some language about God is metaphorical in such a way that it can be re-expressed without metaphor. Deeds performed "with a mighty hand and an outstretched arm" need not be thought of as involving muscularity or punch; they are rather supposed to exhibit God's power or strength. Accordingly, a great many remarks can be expounded within religious language. There are images and images; and at least some are dispensable, at any rate where information is to be conveyed (cf. pp. 68-70). Clearly we should not look to these remarks to find basic statements capable of being taken literally. But what of the less obviously metaphorical statements that remain? Are they all analogical and symbolic? Of these statements, the ones which are negative may be true and literal but are of no use for setting up the theory of analogy. As Dr. Palmer reminds us, it is no use describing a pillar-box as "what an elephant is not". Negative predicates such as "non-spatial' and "non-temporal" could be of help to someone who already had a concept of God's nature; they cannot, however, supply the basis on which to start. However true it may be to remark that God is invisible and inscrutable, nothing can be learned from these remarks alone about how statements about his deeds are to be taken (cf. pp. 53f.). The search for literal predicates about God now takes us to relational ones. Some of these, as Dr. Palmer observes (p. 62), only serve to tell us how dissimilar God is from everything else; and where this is so the same difficulty about negative information applies again (though we may wonder whether, if claims about dissimilarity are really information, there must not be some positive information to rest them on). Dr. Palmer at this point decides to look for wow-relational literal predicates, and, finding none, despairs of finding any literal predicates at all. There is, however, one statement about God on which Dr. Palmer himself is prepared to base one revision of the theory of analogy, a statement which might be construed as concerning both God's nature and his relations with other things: namely that God is creator. Dr. Palmer does not require this statement to be believed for the theory to take flight; he rather suggests, if I take him aright, that //the nature of God is thought of as that of creator, then the sense of the other predicates ascribed to God can be understood. At this stage all I wish to point out is that, if this claim about God's nature and relations could not be taken literally, the revised theory (p. 59) would not begin to look plausible. Some standard-setting statement is required, as Dr. Palmer agrees; and we do need to know which one it is if a</page><page sequence="7">Religious Symbols and the Voyage of Analogy 231 theory of analogy is to work. Within Dr. Palmer's revised account of the theory, it is the treatment of the divine nature as that of creator which supplies the deficiency. The difficulties and the benefits of so treating God's nature are discussed later in this paper. Before embarking on that discussion, however, I should add that all believers in God (and all religious sceptics) must have supposed that there was at least one literal truth about God, and that they could know which it was (even if different ones would identify different statements as literal truths). For the alternative is that none of them has ever been able to explain to others or themselves what they meant by "God". This, however, is too paradoxical to credit; for there would be no point in introducing, borrowing or persisting in the use of a term if there was no role which it could be known to fill. People must, accordingly, always have had some idea of the nature of God, even if some of the accounts they would have given issue in inconsistency or confusion. So if we pretend that all predicates about God are to be taken as analogical, or that even if some are literal we cannot tell which they are, the whole of religious discourse is dislocated in consequence. But the consequence is quite unnecessary. Just which statement about God is taken as a literal truth will depend on what is taken as essential to God, and thus on what "God" is taken to mean. Aquinas, the author of the theory of analogy (his "analogy of proportionality"), also expounded the "analogy of attribution" by which God, as cause of his creatures' qualities, himself bears those qualities. The way in which he bears them will be discussed below; but the present point is that, if we regard God as creator, we must remember this fact about him when uncovering the meaning of his attributes, or we shall misrepresent the level at which they apply. Whatever the deficiencies of the analogy of attribution may be, Aquinas was fully justified in introducing it at the outset. For only those whose notion of God is incompatible with regarding God as creator can afford a theory of analogy which ignores his creative role; and even they may be hard-pressed to find another literal statement on which to erect the scaffolding of their theory. Dr. Palmer for his part is willing to eke out the theory of analogy with an interpretation of the sense in which a creator would bear his creatures' qualities. On this interpretation (p. 59) "God as creator must 'have in him' all his creation's perfections; e.g. if some creatures are wise then God must be wise too, though not in their way of being wise but appropriately, i.e. there must be something not unlike wisdom in God to account for some of his creatures being wise. For lack of any better name we had better apply the term Wisdom to this facet of divinity."</page><page sequence="8">232 Robin Attfield This interpretation, as he sees, has its difficulties. Thus we seem to have no ground for selecting only the desirable qualities of creatures to ascribe them to God, and for refraining from doing as some Hindu theologians do and ascribing to God undesirable qualities such as destruction, as well as desirable ones such as wisdom. If, however, we reject this approach as inappropriate, we need to have revealed to us some new and extra criterion to authorise the rejection of qualities which might otherwise have seemed applicable. To do duty as this basis of selectivity, and to tell us what is really appropriate to God, Dr. Palmer invokes the traditional claim that each attribute of God is "true of what is meant but inadequate in the meaning it conveys to us" (p. 76). Our meanings are, on this view, always inadequate to the reality of God, but are the best available, and dimly correspond to those qualities as they really are. Thus nothing would count as our ex- pressing them better, and what we can express is not useless; but it is nevertheless inappropriate, and does not allow any conclusions about the real truth to be drawn. Dr. Palmer rightly concludes that this theory is fatal to argumentative theology though he believes that it is consistent with the language of devotion and (perhaps) of belief. He also accepts it, and the theory of analogy as thus interpreted. If so, as he would acknowledge, different believers would be free to hold different qualities to be inappropriate to the divine reality and none could expect to persuade the others of the propriety of their own selection. Now I have already concluded on separate grounds that if we cannot tell which statements about God are literal and unqualified, then the theory of analogy becomes null and void, and, in consequence, religious language must be regarded as nonsense; and as this agnosticism about which statements are literal is a feature of Dr. Palmer's revised theory, those grounds already suggest that it should be rejected. Here, however, I have a distinct twofold difficulty to raise. For what sense can be made of the claim that God really has inexpressible qualities? And how can we know that, try as we may, our best expression of the divine qualities fails to be appropriate to them? The answer to the second question appears, at first sight, to be "only through the (fallacious) Imperfection Argument". And, if so, we could not know this systematic deficiency in our language, or rely on it in selecting from and qualifying creatures' qualities when speaking of God. But the trouble in facts lies deeper, for the second question is surely incoherent. The word "them" in the second question refers not just to God's real qualities (to which the Imperfection Argument might have been relevant) but to his inexpressible qualities; but if the answer to the first question is that he cannot significantly be supposed to have such qualities, then the</page><page sequence="9">Religious Symbols and the Voyage of Analogy 233 second question cannot arise. Now inexpressible qualities are not just immeasurable or even undetectable ones; they are qualities of which we could not even form an idea. But in fact we cannot as much as refer or allude to qualities of which we could not form an idea, nor therefore can we have any idea what we mean when we say that they are true of God. So the claim that various inexpressible qualities truly hold good of God is incoherent, as is the distinction between their truth and the inadequacy of our mode of signifying them. Accordingly, if the theory of analogy is so revised as to include this account of the divine qualities, it becomes incoherent itself. Moreover the language of devotion and belief, which the revised theory is supposed to uphold, itself becomes meaningless, as it consists in poor approximations to talk about the incoherent. The consequences, then, of Dr. Palmer's interpretation of the sense in which a creator would bear his creatures' qualities are disastrous for theology, religion and the theory of analogy. It is time to question that interpretation. I propose to do so with the aid of a suggestion of Professor E.L. Mascall. On Professor Mascall's account, all that the analogy of attribution really says is not what God's goodness is like, but that God can cause goodness in his creatures.3 So we could not infer, from the supposed fact that God is the source of all good things, that God is inexpressibly good; all that would follow is that he can bring into existence what is good. He can also, of course, bring about what is evil, but this does not make him inexpressibly evil. If, therefore, there is any problem of selection, it crops up somewhere else, at the stage where we may happen to infer from the particular qualities and relations of God's creatures that he has one or another will or attitude towards them. But as creator he would simply be able to bring about the existence both of the actual creation and of any alternative one which it would be logically possible to create. He would not have to bear his creatures' qualities somehow multiplied so as to befit his own status. None of this, of course, gets us very far since, as Aquinas himself observed,4 we mean a good deal more when we speak of God's wisdom than just that he causes wisdom. The analogy of attribution is insufficient alone. But it does permit us not to regard the creator of what is wise as thereby inexpressibly wise himself, and thus not to adopt Dr. Palmer's interpretation of the main theory of analogy. It is unnecessary to regard all God's qualities as inexpressible just because he is, or is believed to be, the creator. Now if Professor Mascall's alternative account is pursued further, a different understanding of the theory of analogy presents itself. Certainly the analogy of attribution does not get us very far, but it is still of help in interpreting the main theory of analogy (the "analogy of proportionality' '). On this theory the love of God is to the nature of God as human love is to</page><page sequence="10">234 Robin Attfield human nature. The problem, not yet fully solved, is how to construe "the nature of God", and the solution is, I suggest, to understand God as essentially able to create. (We should not treat God as essentially the creator, as this forecloses the possibility that God has choice about whether to create. I have discussed such matters and their resolution in greater detail elsewhere).5 Accordingly, if God is wise, it will be with the wisdom of a potential creator; and so on, through all the other qualities which he may be supposed to have. How much would this tell us? It certainly would not tell us which qualities God actually has, for this must hang on the evidence, and no theory of meaning can supply that evidence. The role of a theory of meaning is to show in what sense to take "God is wise", whether or not that proposition is true. It would nevertheless tell us quite a good deal. Thus a potential creator would necessarily be omnipotent, so whatever he does will be done with almighty power at his command. A potential creator must be purposive or his productions would, contrary to what we mean by "creation", be merely random; and, as he would be able to envisage alternative creations in their full cosmic proportions, he must be omniscient. So his wisdom, if he is wise, will be a creator's wisdom expressed in purposive applications of this knowledge and power, or in revelations about his creatures' good. Certainly we cannot imagine the divine counsels; but the theory of analogy enables us, despite our limits in knowledge and imagination, to know what we mean when we speak of divine wisdom. The theory does not, of course, convey any factual information which we would not have had without it; if it did, it would exceed its brief. What it does is to enable us to give an account of at least some religious usage, and hence to confute the charge of not knowing what we mean when we employ it. It cannot be defended fully within the confines of the present essay; nevertheless there are already grounds for believing that at least some religious language is after all intelligible, and that the pledges of those who deal in it can be redeemed. I therefore believe that a form of the theory of analogy, shorn of Dr. Palmer's revisions, will carry out the role for which it was devised. This is because we can know at least one literal truth about God: he is essentially able to create whatever can be created. The literal statement required for the theory to work had to be non- negative, and such this statement is. It is certainly also a relational statement, for to be able to bring something about is to be related, or at least potentially to be related, to that something. But the statement's relational nature does not disqualify it from serving to explain the level at which talk about God is to be understood, for it also tells us something</page><page sequence="11">Religious Symbols and the Voyage of Analogy 235 about God's nature or essence, the very feature required of a statement if it is to make the theory an operative one. But can the claim that this statement is to be taken literally be sustained? Is it not itself just as qualified in sense as any other theological remark? If so, the theory of analogy collapses again. Yet do we not borrow the idea of creation from everyday language about the activities of painters, sculptors and potters? It is not in fact the case that words meaning * 'create" were in general originally borrowed from more everyday language; in Hebrew, at any rate, there is a separate term for "create" when God is being spoken of. But the matter is not to be settled by an etymological discussion of the origins of the word "create" and its counterparts used in the various scriptures of mankind. For the issue is whether in current language expressions such as "God creates" bear an analogical sense or a literal one. On this issue my contention is that such expressions bear a distinctive and unqualified sense, closely resembling that of Genesis, Expressions such as these convey that God brings something into existence out of nothing. By contrast, when "create" is used of the making of something unprecedented in form but out of existing materials, it seems to carry a watered-down sense, or sometimes even a jocular one; and when it is used to mean nothing more than "produce" or "generate", the sense is so analogical and so remote from the word's central contexts as to appear trite and almost evacuated of content. Even when "create" is used of plastic art, music and literature, it is used by way of a metaphor grounded in the creative activity of God. These are the considerations based on ordinary language for holding that "God creates" is capable of being taken literally. There is also a more theoretical consideration to adduce. If "create" does not have a literal sense when applied to God, then if that sense can be understood at all there must be some other literal truth about God's nature or what it is to be God For if there is not, not only does the theory of analogy collapse, but also those who talk about God have not the slightest idea what they are talking about. But if this other literal truth about God's nature requires "God creates" to be so qualified in sense as not to mean "God brings into existence out of nothing", then the central doctrine of theistic religions ceases to be recognisable as such; and if this happens to the doctrine of creation, then it also happens to those doctrines of theistic religions which depend on the doctrine of creation, i.e. to most theistic doctrines. So if theistic religions are to be expressible in any recognisable way, "create" (and equivalent expressions in other languages) must be allowed a literal sense; and if they are allowed a literal sense, then some statement in which one of them figures can serve as the requisite unqualified statement needed for the theory of analogy, and there is no need to look for another.</page><page sequence="12">236 Robin Attfield But the claim that religious expressions can bear an unqualified sense, it may now be objected, was surely itself precluded by the reply to the Language Game theorists given by Dr. Palmer and endorsed by myself. There it was contended that religious language involves terms borrowed from everyday usage and supplied with a special sense; indeed this was the very reason for which it was held that the external relations holding between religious and other usage must be expounded. So indeed they must; but to accept this is not to grant that all religious terms are to be expounded in this way. Plausibly "revelation", "righteous", "pray" and "forgive" are among many other terms which, when used in religion, are to be expounded in just this sort of way; just as plausibly "worship", "bless", "grace" and "glory" cannot. Plausibly these terms can only be expounded as concerning transactions between God and his creatures, and either have no non-religious, everyday use, or a borrowed and analogical one. If "creator" has a sense, so do they; but it is not a sense arrived at by qualifying a non-religious everyday sense. Nor, I suggest, is that of "create" itself. Whatever equivalent expressions we may employ to ex- pound its sense, that sense is not a qualified one. What, it may now be asked, are the implications of the theory of analogy for Buddhist talk of Nirvana and for Hindu talk of God or the Absolute? Except where Hindus (e.g. disciples of some of the Upanishads) or Buddhists (e.g. Mahayana Buddhists) employ some notion of creation resembling that delineated above, the statement that God is essentially able to create will clearly be of no assistance in expounding their religious language. Nevertheless the logic of the theory of analogy still holds. Thus so long as Buddhists treat as a necessary truth the proposition that Nirvana is a state of desirelessness, the stage has been duly set for the ascription of qualities to Nirvana; for we have a rule for working out how to understand them. The same would hold for Hindu language, so long as any one positive proposition is accepted as a necessary and literal truth about the nature of the Absolute. (In my own experience, however, the necessary truths acknowledged by Hindus about the Absolute are all negative, qualified or both; and in the absence of a positive and unqualified one it is hard to see what is meant at all. Nor does it help to be offered a spiritual path towards contemplation of the Absolute, unless talk of the Absolute can be explained and understood.) It should not be thought, however, that the theory shows all the language of theistic religions to be coherent either, though it does seem to do this for the ascription of at least most positive, non-relational predicates to God. Nevertheless, like Dr. Palmer I find a good deal of Christian and other theology (and, I should add, belief) to be incoherent; and this for reasons not unrelated to the theory of analogy.</page><page sequence="13">Religious Symbols and the Voyage of Analogy 237 As Dr. Palmer appositely observes (pp. 18, 103f.), it is impermissible to adhere to (or, we might add, rely on) the theory and then act as if one does not. But this occurs whenever a theist applies to God predicates which, however qualified, cannot intelligibly apply to an omnipotent creator. Can God change his mind? Not if he is either unchanging or timeless. There again, * 'being Three in One" conflicts with omnipotence: how could more than one agent be omnipotent, and thus able to frustrate the actions of the others? Similarly "becoming human" raises kindred difficulties; for if, as is plausible, to be human is necessarily to be subject to change without one's own consent, and to be omnipotent is necessarily not to be changeable without one's own consent, then becoming human is impossible without ceasing to be omnipotent, and therefore ceasing to be God (in the sense of "God" used above). When religious language deviates in this kind of way from anything which the theory of analogy can expound, it has released itself thereby from all the requirements of consistency. But, as usual, there are corresponding liabilities; people who speak like this cannot say what they mean, and have to appeal to mystery, and to their hearers' loyalty to the doctrine that the divine attributes are inexpressible. But this doctrine is, as we have seen, incoherent. Recently, in face of attacks similar to the above on the doctrine of Incarnation, one of its defenders came close to acknowledging much of this.6 How can we have any ground for holding, he asked, that God cannot become man, when we scarcely know what it is to be human, and have at best an inadequate grasp of the divine nature? Such a defence seems to undermine itself. It is not just that on this showing we cannot know that God can become man either. Rather this agnosticism about the divine nature leaves its adherents unable to give an account of the meaning of the terms applied by themselves to God, and thus of the meaning of the very doctrine which they are trying to defend. Such a defence amounts to the admission that the doctrine in question is not so much incredible as incomprehensible. Dr. Palmer for his part supposes that his own account of the theory of analogy might encourage a view of theology as non-descriptive, and an understanding of religion as consisting of affirmations rather than assertions. But affirmations are only likely to be taken seriously either by those who affirm them or by others if they are at least believed to have a basis in truth. If so, a philosophical theory is needed which allows for the possibility of reasoning and of doctrine in theology, as well as of affirmations. For such a philosophical theory, and for intelligible religious language, the theory of analogy, understood in something like the form presented above, constitutes an indispensable foundation. I suspect, however, that Dr. Palmer has a deep-rooted objection to any</page><page sequence="14">238 Robin Attfield language about a creator. At p. 40 he asks, "What sort of strength is appropriate to an infinite and eternal being?" and answers, "We simply do not know, for we have no experience to go upon" (my italics). But we have no experience either of what it is to bring things into existence out of nothing. There can be no experience of the bringing about of the conditions which make experience possible. Indeed in a later passage (pp. 101 f.) the view of Hume is endorsed that "we could not trust reasoning outside the spheres of which we had experience." Taken together these passages suggest a belief that there are systematic flaws in all reasoning about whatever transcends possible experience, creation included. Now if the claim is that such reasoning is seldom demonstrative, I should agree. But the claim seems rather to concern the comprehensibility of the language employed in such reasoning, as if language is only reliable when used in senses relating to human experience. But if so, language used about God must after all carry only the everyday senses of the terms employed (makes, loves, reveals, forgives). In other words, no language is properly applicable to God. Thus the strict empiricist is, as ever, shipwrecked on the rock of anthropomorphism. Elsewhere Dr. Palmer holds (pp. 28, 144) that the very positivism of which this approach is a manifest version despairs of religious symbols prematurely; and granted a workable theory of analogy this verdict seems to have been the correct one. If we identify the limits of meaning with those of experience, we are already caught in Scylla's unrelenting grasp; if we observe no limits in our language we are trapped in Charybdis' whirlpool of ineffable doom. But if we launch out resolutely onto the waters charted by the theory of analogy we can ply a safe middle passage. NOTES 1.
