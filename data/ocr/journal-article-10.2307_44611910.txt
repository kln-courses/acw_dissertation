To compliment that empirical approach the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) initiated a full scale commuter category airplane vertical impact test program. Those airplane vertical impact tests were structured to evaluate the airframe's capability to maintain its structural integrity and provide a protective shell for its occupants, to quantify the acceleration impact response characteristics of the airframe, and to evaluate the means necessary to provide occupant pelvic/lumbar column load injury protection up to the limits of survivable impact conditions. This paper presents the results of the FAA's full scale commuter category airplane vertical impact tests which indicate that occupant impact protection can be provided for the levels of impact conditions evaluated in the test program. INTRODUCTION SMALL AIRPLANE IMPACT TEST PROGRAM - In the 1970's the FAA and the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) embarked on a full scale small airplane impact test program. Those impact tests were conducted at the NASA Langley Impact Dynamics Research Facility which is a gantry test facility that can subject the test aircraft to both vertical and longitudinal velocity changes (see figure 1). Some of the objectives of that test program were to determine and quantify the dynamic response of airplane structures, seats, and occupants during a crash, and to determine the effect of flight parameters at impact on loads and on structural damage. The results of those tests provided the framework for a number of additional impact test programs for small general aviation airplanes, rotorcraft, and transport category airplanes. They also provided the basis for the seat dynamic performance standards for small general aviation airplanes [2] [3]. NASA COMPOSITE MATERIALS AIRPLANE IMPACT TEST PROGRAM - NASA has continued to investigate the crash impact response of airplane structures by A ... pr Movable PuHback PldK A ... 7 / Cameras Figure 1 : NASA Drop Tower Facility initiating a research program that is directed to determine the impact response characteristics of composite material airplane structures. This latest program uses a building block approach that investigates in a logical order the basic impact response characteristics of composite materials, evaluates those composite materials in subcomponent structures considering scale effects, and finally evaluates the full scale impact response characteristics of complete airplane structures [4] [5] [6]. The FAA's commuter category airplane vertical impact test program and NASA's composite materials airplane impact test program compliment each other in that they are evaluating the crash impact response characteristics of similar size airplane structures and the results of both those test programs should enable one to make direct comparisons between metallic and composite materials airframes. FAA VERTICAL IMPACT TEST PROGRAM - The FAA has recently proposed seat dynamic performance standards for 14 CFR Part 23 commuter category airplanes shown in table 1 [7]. Those standards were established empirically using the 138</page><page sequence="2">results of prior airplane crash impact test programs. In development of those standards it was noted that the full scale airplane impact test data base did not include airplanes representative in size of commuter category airplanes. To provide data for those size airplanes that would also compliment the NASA composite materials airplanes impact tests data base of similar size airplanes the FAA initiated a fall scale vertical impact test program of 14 CFR Part 23 commuter category airplanes. The vertical impact tests described in this paper were conducted at the FAA's Technical Center. They were structured to assess the impact response characteristics of airframe structures, seats, and the potential for occupant impact injury.

An electrically powered winch, mounted on the platform, is used to raise or lower the test article and is controlled from the base of one of the tower legs. The lifting capacity of the winch is rated at 13,600 pounds. Attached to the winch is a reeved hoisting cable which is used raise the test article. A sheave block assembly hanging from the free end of the reeved cable is engaged to a solenoid operated release hook. The release hook is connected to, the airframe by a cable/turnbuckle assembly with hooks bolted to the fuselage section at four locations. Located below the winch cable assembly and between the tower legs is a 15- foot by 36-foot wooden platform which rests upon I-beams and is supported by 12 independent load cells. SMALL AIRPLANE IMPACT TESTS TEST OBJECTIVES AND CONDITIONS SUMMARY - The purpose of these tests was to measure the impact response of the fuselage, cabin floor, cabin furnishings (including standard and modified seats) and anthropomorphic test dummies. These tests were conducted to simulate the vertical velocity component of a potentially survivable crash impact condition.

Acceleration and load data were recorded throughout the test. TEST SPECIMENS - The test specimens used in this program were selected to be representative of 14 CFR Part 23 commuter category airplanes. Currently two airplanes have been tested and other tests are planned. A brief description of the two tested airplanes follows: Cessna Golden Eagle 421ВГ81 - This airplane is a six to ten place, all metal , low wing airplane that can be operated as a small commuter airplane. The fuselage and wing structures were complete. Ballast weights were added to represent the weights of the engines, fuel, baggage, and empennage (see figure 3). Five seats and instrumented anthropomorphic test dummies were installed on the airplane for the test (see figure 4). The test was conducted with the landing gear retracted. The test specimen was initially configured for a test weight of 5200 pounds. Subsequent to the first impact test the airplane was subjected to a second impact test at a test weight of 7200 pounds which is equal to the maximum landing weight of the airplane.

The fuselage and wing box structure were complete. The wing panels, engines and nacelles, and landing gear were not included as part of the test specimen. Ballast weights were added to represent the weights of the baggage and empennage. Sixteen seats were installed on the airplane where each seat was occupied with an instrumented anthropomorphic test dummy or an Armstrong Medical dummy (ballast) for the test. The test specimen was configured for a test weight of 7347 pounds which is consistent with the fuselage shell loading that simulates a configuration that is approximately 1450 pounds less than the maximum zero fuel weight (13100 pounds) of the airplane with a 14100 pounds maximum takeoff weight.

Table 2 is a list of the instrumentation and their location used for the Metro III test, which is typical of any commuter test. The instrumentation complied with SAE J21 1 [10] practices for impact tests and all data channels were typically prefiltered with a SAE J211 Channel Class 1000 filter. The analog data were digitized at a sampling rate of 5000 samples per second. The test specimens were instrumented with thirty to forty-four data channels as required to meet the test objectives. 140</page><page sequence="4">Table 2: Instrumentation Location Channel Description locations * iOÏ Pilot Side Wall Accel. -31,121,26 102 Pilot Side Roor Accel. - 12,121,0 103 Co-Pilot Side Wall Accel. +3 1 ,121 ,26 104 Co-Pilot Side Roor Accel. +12,121,0 105 Co-Pilot Dummy Accel. #1 +14.5,121,13 106 Co-Pilot Dummy Accel. #2 +14.5,121,13 107 Left Side Wall Accel. -32,174,29.5 108 Left Side Outboard Track Accel. -26,174,6 109 Left Side Inboard Seat Track Accel. -8, 174,0 110 Right Side Wall Accel. +32,174,29 111 Right Side Outboard Seat Track Accel. +26, 1 74,6 1 12 Right Side Inboard Seat Track Accel. +8,174,0 113 Roor String Pot #1 -3,217,-6 114 Roor String Pot #2 +3,217,-6 1 15 Left Side Inboard Seat Track String Pot -8,217,0 201 Pilot Dummy Load Cell -12,121,13 202 Pilot Dummy Accel. #1 -12, 121, 13 203 Pilot Dummy Accel. #2 -12,121,13 204 CAMI Seat Dummy Load Cell +0,235, 14 205 CAMI Seat Dummy Accel. #1 +0,235, 14 206 CAMI Seat Dummy Accel. #2 +0,235, 14 207 Beechcraft Seat Load Cell +0,266,14 208 Standard Metro Seat Dummy Load Cel + 1 7,297, 1 3 209 Standard Metro Seat Dummy Accel. + 1 7,297, 1 3 210 Left Side Wall Accel. -32,422,28 211 Left Side Outboard Seat Track Accel. -26,422,6 212 Left Side Inboard Seat Track Accel. -8,422,0 213 Right Side Wall Accel. +32,3 17,30 214 Right Side Outboard Seat Track Accel. +26,3 17,6 215 Right Side Inboard Seat Track Accel. +8,3 17,0 216 Left Side Wall Accel. -32,317,30 217 Left Side Outboard Seat Track Accel. -26,3 1 7,6 218 Left Side Inboard Seat Track Accel. -8,317,0 219 Right Side Wall Accel. +32,422,28.5 220 Right Side Outboard Seat Track Accel. +26,422,6 221 Right Side Inboard Seat Track Accel. +8,422,0 * Locations represent Buttline, Fuselage Station, and Waterline respectively Airframe - Accelerometers were typically located on the cabin floor and sidewall of the fuselage distributed along the length of the cabin in order to measure the structural response throughout the airframe (see figure 7).

Figure 8: Loadcell Location PHOTOGRAPHIC DOCUMENTATION - High speed (500 feet/second) color film and real time video coverage were used to record the impact tests. A number of 16 millimeter high speed color film cameras were located strategically around the airplanes to record frontal , rearward, side view and quarter views of the airplanes during the impact (see figure 9). Two high speed color film cameras were also located within the cabin of the airplanes to provide views of the response of the cabin interior and the anthropomorphic test dummies during the impact. Additionally 35 millimeter still photographs were taken to document any significant post test structural damage or observations. □Э 0D FRONT AFT 8 q| ' □ °D □ О VIDEO FILM 30 FRAMES/EC 500 FRAMES/SEC Figure 9: Typical Camera Locations TESTS RESULTS SUMMARY AIRFRAME ACCELERATION DATA - Typical airframe acceleration time history data are illustrated herein along with normalized peak acceleration values (see figures 10, 11 and table 3). The airframe acceleration data were normalized using a symmetrical triangular impact pulse shape as the basis. Triangular impact pulse shapes are typically recorded in full scale airplane impact tests and they are generally accepted as being representative of the airplane acceleration pulse shape for typical airplane structures. In the normalization procedure the acceleration time history in the area of the primary impact and peak response is first integrated. The resultant velocity change is then doubled and divided by the integration time interval to obtain the normalized peak acceleration value. The normalized acceleration data provides a simple and a more consistent means of quantifying and comparing the airframe acceleration data. 20-j -10- к •ю- ļi j -20- ļlļ / с л / ° -30- / "4°- I Floor Accel., _50_ il Impact, Filtered 60 Hz, U В.

Two typical pelvic area acceleration time histories are shown, a standard seat in figure 12, and an energy absorbing seat in figure 13. The peak pelvic accelerations measured in the ATD's ranged from 30 to 45 G's. The magnitudes of the pelvic accelerations cannot be readily used as a measure of the potential of occupant pelvic/lumbar column injury but they serve as comparative indicators of the relative severity of the acceleration levels experienced by occupants seated in different locations in the airplane cabin and in different seat types. The measured pelvic acceleration levels can also provide an indication of the amplification or attenuation of the airframe acceleration environment provided by the airplane seats. The measured pelvic/lumbar column loads presented in the following section of this paper provide a better measure of the potential of occupant injury. 10.0 -10.0 л i w -20.0- V ò -зо.о. _4Q g Standard Metro Seat, Dummy, Accel., у Impact, Filtered 60Hz, -50.0.

One of the objectives of this test program was to demonstrate that the pelvic/lumbar column load limitation of 1500 pounds could be achieved with use of an energy absorbing seat. For the vertical impact tests described in this paper a number of ATDs were instrumented with pelvicflumbar column load cells and placed onboard the airplanes to measure the impact loads in the ATDs on both standard and energy absorbing airplane seats. The energy absorbing seat used in this test program was developed by the FAA's CAMI facility[12] (see figure 14). The results of dynamic sled tests conducted at the CAMI test facility have indicated that their energy absorbing seat design could limit the ATD's pelvic/lumbar column load to 1500 pounds or less for test conditions with impact velocities equal to those planned for the FAA's commuter category airplane vertical impact test program. The performance of the CAMI energy absorbing seat in the full scale commuter category airplane tests was comparable to that observed in the CAMI sled tests. Figure 14: CAMI Seat These airplane vertical impact tests have demonstrated that the 14 CFR Part 23, Section 23.562(c)(2) pelvic/lumbar column load limits can be achieved for airplane impact severity levels equal to the impact conditions tested. It was also shown that another standard onboard airplane seat that was not specifically designed to be energy absorbing could withstand the vertical impact test conditions without collapse while also minimizing the ATD's pelvic/lumbar column load to 143</page><page sequence="7">Ievels somewhat in excess (1700 - 1800 pounds) of the desired 1500 pounds limitation: The ATD's pelvic/lumbar column loads measured in this vertical impact test program are tabulated in table 4, along with typical examples of a pelvic/lumbar column load time history, for a standard seat in figure 15 and a energy absorbing seat figure in figure 16.

The CAMI energy absorbing seat pan strokes during impact by pivoting about its forward edge while attenuating the impact energy with a wire bending device at the aft edge of the seat pan. The seat strokes measured during these tests were between 3 - 4.5 inches which are consistent with those measured during the CAMI seat dynamic sled tests. The seat strokes measured during these vertical impact tests for the CAMI energy absorbing seat are shown below in table 5.

The airframes tested maintained their structural integrity and provided a protective structural shell for the airplane's occupants. Underfloor structural deformations were measured and found to be 1.5 to 2.5 inches maximum for the two airplanes tested. Structural damage was limited to some bucking or crushing of the underfloor frames as shown in the following post test photograph (see figure 17 &amp; 18). The only other structural damage noted was some buckling in the sidewall at fuselage station 312 in the Metro III airplane as shown below in figure 19. Figure 17: Cessna Underfloor Crush OTHER TESTS COMPARISONS FAA/NASA COMPARISONS - As previously described in this paper, the FAA's Technical Center's test facility is a vertical drop tower. At times questions arise regarding the test results and their comparability with those obtained at sling 144</page><page sequence="8">Figure 18: Metro Underfloor Crush, Aft of Wing Section Figure 19: Side Wall Buckling tower test facilities that can simultaneously expose the test specimen to both vertical and longitudinal impact velocities. To address those questions the results of the commuter category airplane vertical impact tests presented in this paper are compared to similar tests conducted at NASA Langley's Impact Dynamics Research Facility (see table 6). In 1984 NASA had conducted three full scale airplane impact tests as part of their research on underfloor load-limiting structural concepts applicable to metal airframe structures of general aviation airplanes[13]. These tests are of interest in that their impact conditions are comparable to those used in the FAA's commuter category airplane impact tests program. AIRFRAME ACCELERATIONS - The airframe peak vertical acceleration levels measured in the above NASA full scale airplane impact test series ranged from a low of 25 G's for the modified underfloor structures to 55 G's maximum for the unmodified airplane. The airframe peak vertical acceleration levels measured for the unmodified airplane is comparable to the 45 - 59 G's range measured in the FAA's commuter category airplane vertical impact tests program (see figure 20).

The NASA test airplane with the unmodified subfloor structure experienced minimal underfloor structural deformation that is again comparable to that found in the FAA's commuter category airplane vertical impact tests program. The airframe behavior with respect to both the vertical acceleration levels and the type and magnitude of airframe structural damage are comparable between the FAA's commuter category airplane tests and the NASA test series used for comparison. It appears as if the drop test methodology does simulate the vertical impact and structural response of an actual airplane crash impact. ADDITIONAL FAA TESTS The FAA plans to continue its research to quantify the impact response characteristics for a range of commuter category airplane sizes. Future tests will also be conducted at level airplane attitude impact conditions with a vertical impact velocity of 26 - 27 feet/second. The measurement of the airframe acceleration levels and the resultant structural deformation will again be objectives of future tests along with demonstrations of the effectiveness of energy absorbing seat designs in providing occupant impact injury protection. 145</page><page sequence="9">RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS The FAA has completed two of a series of commuter category airplane vertical impact tests that are structured to evaluate the structural impact response characteristics of those airplanes. Those two tests demonstrated that the structural integrity of the airframe and the occupant livable volume was maintained for vertical impact conditions in excess of 26 feet/second. The airframe acceleration response measured at the cabin floor was found to range between 45 to 59 G's for the impact conditions tested. The corresponding underfloor structural deformations measured for both tests were found to be less than 2.5 inches. Onboard energy absorbing seat and instrumented anthropomorphic test dummies were successfully used in these tests to demonstrate that the pelvic/lumbar column load could be limited to less than the 1500 pounds potential for injury level found in 14 CFR, Part 23.562. The overall results of the FAA's commuter category airplane vertical impact tests compare with those obtained for similar test conditions at NASA's airplane impact test facility where the test airplanes are exposed to both longitudinal and vertical impact velocities.
