<plain_text><page sequence="1">212] Recent Literature Bird-Banding human ignorance, and worse, greed, makes these chapters gloomy reading, yet their authors "feel some cautious optimism" over recent progress in marsh and pothole conservation. Such developments are also a part of the next chapters on various sorts of water impoundments. Other problems discussed include water- fowl crop depredations, water polution, the currently topical danger of insecticides, and the special threat of lead poisoning. Further on, after a group of chapters on refuges and sanctuaries, another section deals with the multifarious activities of waterfowl management; water level manipulation, soil chemistry, planting of aquatic vegetation, use of herbi- cides and fire, and techniques of crop farming, grazing, and mowing to improve habitat. Carp control, nest boxes, and salvage of waste places also claim chapters. At times the text reads like a do-it-yourself manual, but a wealth of useful informa- tion and advice is presented. The final section discusses the title theme, Waterfowl Tomorrow. This is something of a miscellany, and includes material which duplicates, or could better have been placed with, earlier chapters. However, it is redeemed by R. C. Clem- ents' thoughtful analysis, and forecast of the future. Of present drainage, polution and environmental exploitation, he says ". . . these destructive tendencies are currently built into the fabric of our society. It is the manufacturers of earth- moving equipment ... who lobby drainage and road-building schemes the rest of us don't need or don't want .... It is greed, shortsightedness, and ruinous economic competition that puts off solutions to the scandalous pollution of our environ- ment." But for the future he forsees that ". . . tomorrow's American citizen is likely to be much more perceptive of a wider range of outdoor values because he has already progressed so far in this direction. If, however, he fails, for one reason or another, to achieve that higher awareness that alone can allow him to continue enjoying the rich wildlife resources of America, he will quickly lose everything." The format will be familiar to anyone who has used the U. S. Department of Agriculture's Yearbook series, which this volume complements in some respects. The double column format, abundant photographs, and sketches by the talented Bob Hines combine to produce a handsome book. Maps are the only major de- ficiency; a large fold-out endpaper map locates many names and places but is awkward to use in conjunction with the text. Outline maps of the United States and Canada in the section on breeding distribution contribute nothing, and a good map of breeding and wintering duck abundance appears far too late, in the book's last section. There are a few species maps, but about 85% of North American waterfowl are not represented; maps for each species would have been very useful, and their omission cannot be argued on grounds of space economy in a book as large and as lavishly illustrated as this one.-Robert S. Hoffmann. 52. Grouse Management Symposium. T. G. Scott, ed. 1963. J. Wildl. Mgmt., 27(4): 527-895. This issue of the Journal is entirely devoted to North American tetraonids. The editor's introduction indicates the need for special re- views, so that the wildlife biologist may be kept up-to-date on advances in specific fields, and hoped that this symposium would provide a broad survey of grouse biology and management. Whereas the papers are diverse and informative, few are actually review papers, and the symposium as a whole falls somex-hat short of the editor's goal in this respect. However, a great deal of new research, and some old, has been brought together, and the results are of real interest to orni- thologists. Among the reviews is the lead paper, by J. W. Aldrich, "Geographic orientation of American Tetraonidae." The distribution of each grouse species is discussed and illustrated with maps. Geographic variation is discussed, and cor- related with ecological variation and geographic isolation, although in a few cases Aldrich seems to over-reach his data in attempting to find such correlations. Following this, the symposium papers are arranged by species; Blue Grouse are first. "Blue grouse brood cover selection and land-use implications," by T. W. Mussehl, shows that brood cover of adequate height and coverage may be seriously reduced by livestock grazing in Montana. "Significance of location, year, sex, and age to the autumn diet of blue grouse," by D. A. Boag, indicates that autumn diet in Washington is quite varied, and that food availability may influence sub- sequent reproduction. Three other papers consider age, plumage, census, harvest and trapping. Spruce Grouse, with a distribution second only to Ruffed Grouse, have re- ceived very little attention from biologists, and the papers assembled here reflect</page><page sequence="2">Vol. XXXVI Recent Literature [213 1965 this. Two are brief food habits studies from Montana and Ontario. "Status of Spruce Grouse in Michigan," by G. A. Ammann, reviews past and present distri- bution and abundance; he believes the species is usually associated with jack pines, near small clearings. "Notes on the harvest of spruce grouse," by H. G. Lumsden and R. B. Weeden, surveys hunting regulations and harvest, and sum- marizes sex and age differences in plumage. Eleven papers concern Ruffed Grouse. The majority deal with various aspects of population dynamics. "Grouse abundance and June temperatures in Wells Gray Park, British Columbia," by R. W. Ritcey and R. Y. Edwards, correlates above average spring temperatures with high grouse harvest the following fall. "Sex and age structure of Wisconsin ruffed grouse populations," by R. S. Dorney, is based on analysis of wings and tails collected from hunters. Significantly higher proportions of juveniles occur in the bag in the northern part of the state than elsewhere, and the adult sex ratio is male-favored in the west. Several hypotheses are offered concerning this geographic variation in population structure. In "Seasonal movements of ruffed grouse in Wisconsin," by J. B. Hale and R. S. Dorney, data on 615 individual movements of 441 birds are given. They generalize that Ruffed Grouse in the fall have relatively small ranges, though juveniles are more mobile than adults, and some wander far. Winter movements are shorter than fall, and show no age or sex difference. Drumming males in spring are seden- tary, but females are more mobile. The three North American species of ptarmigan are practically unutilized by sportsmen. Biologists, too, have neglected them on this continent and only three papers are presented. "Habitat and population dynamics of white-tailed ptarmi- gan in Montana," by T. S. Choate, is the first major study of this species. The low adult mortality rate (29%), low productivity, and maximum longevity of per- haps 15 years are very unusual for a galliform population. "Management of ptarmigan in North America," by R. B. Weeden, considers the Rock and Willow ptarmigan. A review of characteristics of the species and their environment, and population dynamics, is followed by discussion of present utilization and manage- ment. The prairie chickens are in the most precarious state of all North American grouse. Of the four original taxa, one race is extinct and another nearly so. The presently threatened population is discussed in "Status of Attwater's prairie chicken," by V. W. Lehmann and R. G. Mauermann. In the last 25 years the population has declined about 85%, due principally to habitat deterioration, and only 1,335 remained in 1963. The greater prairie chicken has also suffered from land use changes, as documented in R. E. Yeatter's "Population responses of prairie chickens to land-use changes in Illinois." The gradual decline is attributed to more intensive cultivation, and the replacement of redtop grass seed crops by legume hay crops. Two other papers discuss raptor predation and winter census. The lesser prairie chicken, with much smaller range, has had a somewhat different history than its congener. In "The lesser prairie chicken in Colorado," D. M. Hoffman indicates that from 1959-63, the species has increased steadily, due to pasture rotation, moderate grazing, grass reseeding programs, and, not the least, better moisture conditions. However, another paper chronicles different condi- tions in the Texas panhandle. "Identification and analysis of lesser and greater prairie chicken habitat," by R. E. Jones, is a study of the two species where their ranges met in Oklahoma. Habitat differences (lessers use small units of shortgrass intermixed with larger units of shrubs or half-shrubs, and greater use small units of short or midgrass intermixed with larger units of tallgrass) and food differences are analyzed. Sharp-tailed grouse are among the better studied species, and it is a surprise to find only two papers on them in the symposium. "Status and management of sharp-tailed grouse in Michigan," by G. A. Ammann, reviews changes in that state's populations since the author published his major study seven years ago. The species has decreased somewhat on the Upper, and increased on the Lower Peninsula, largely as a result of habitat changes. Habitat development by con- trolled burning and herbicide spraying is practical, but expensive. The other paper analyzes sharptail brood habitat. The sage grouse, most stenotopic of the tetraonids, has retreated very little from its original range. However, it is potentially vulnerable to the increasing practice of herbicide spraying of sagebrush, and a major study such as "Ecology,</page><page sequence="3">214] Recent Literature Bird-Banding productivity, and management of sage grouse in Idaho," by P. D. Dalke and others in therefore timely. The population studied was highly mobile, moving 13-27 miles to brood range from strutting grounds, and 30-50 miles to winter range, for an annual round trip of 50-100 miles. Counts of strutting cocks, and brood censuses in early July, are useful. Sex, age, and reproductive criteria are discussed. These latter points are also considered in the other two papers. The final two papers are reviews "Disease and infection in the Tetraonidae," by C. M. Herman. cautions against the tenacious assumption that a single "grouse disease" is a cause of grouse mortality, and calls for new tools and techniques to attack problems in wildlife diseases. Gardiner Bump's "History and analysis of tetraonid introductions into North America," recounts unsuccessful attempts to stock capercaille, black, hazel, and willow grouse. He also makes a case for the possibility of successfully introducing the first two species, though without con- sidering possible effects on native species. The symposium is closed by an ex- cellent evaluation of the constituent papers by Frederick and Frances Hamer- strom, who served as its assistant editors. Those wishing informative summaries of the contents should turn here first. In such a heterogeneous array of contributions it is not possible to point out minor errors or points of disagreement in individual papers and I shall make in- stead only a few general comments. The photographs do not indicate sex of the birds illustrated, and in some cases this is not evident by inspection.. Usage of common names is somewhat confusing; in some papers both racial names (ex. dusky, sooty grouse) and species name (blue grouse) are used. Finally, a more representative survey of work currently in progress might have been possible had a longer time (say, several years) been allotted to assembling the contributions. This is said in full appreciation of the difficulties faced by editors of such a sym- posium, but a better volume could have resulted from the elimination of certain minor papers and the inclusion of more reviews and major papers. It is to be hoped that The Wildlife Society will continue to publish symposia, and in the future more frequently than once every ten years.-Robert S. Hoffmann. 53. Argen the Gull. Franklin Russel. 1965. Alfred A. Knopf, Inc. New York, 239 pp. 9 photographs by the author, 1 map (the coast of Atlantis or per- haps Shangri-la). Price $4.95 Mr. Russell is a fine professional writer but he reminds me of the so-called Very Important Persons who came to Japan during the American occupation for a visit of five days or perhaps five weeks. When they returned to the United States, they felt qualified to write a book about Japanese life and thought. It is possible after a brief visit to describe superficially Japanese geisha girls, a shrine, and Fujiyama, but not even after five years of daily associa- tion with Japanese in their homes would a student of far eastern mores feel com- petent to write of Japanese life and thought. Franklin Russell dares to put thoughts and emotions into a Herring Gull's brain and heart that a lifelong student of animal behavior would hesitate to presume existed. He has even endowed Argen the Gull with the ability to dream. Mr. Russell makes a very exciting story of the evolution of gulls and the life of a Herring Gull from egg to senility. In his first chapter he introduces a theory new to science when he suggests that perhaps feathers developed to keep primitive birds warm and were later found useful for flight. The book contains some factual Herring Gull behavior, probably adopted from Tinbergen's The Herring Gull's World. Certainly much of the story of Argen's first mating came from the section entitled "The Formation of New Pairs" in that fine work. But Russell takes no notice of Tinbergen's theory that can- nibalism among gulls occurs only in overcrowded colonies. If one can overlook scientific inaccuracy, anthropomorphism, and the author's over-active imagination, Argen the Gull may be labeled "Leisure Time Reading." The pictures are more "Art Photography" than bird illustrations. The jacket design is pleasing.-Elizabeth S. Austin. 54. Rare and Exotic Birds. Robert Cushman Murphy. 1964. The Odessy Press, New York. 45 pp., 75 color photographs by Arthur Singer. Price $0.95. This beautiful little book is a delightful combination of the lesser known abilities of two very gifted men. Robert Cushman Murphy, outstanding as a scientist, demonstrates his fund of bird folklore and his gift for story telling. Arthur Singer,</page></plain_text>
