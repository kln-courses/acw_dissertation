<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Other Kaiser: Wilhelm I and British Cartoonists, 1861-1914 RICHARD SCULLY The cartoon version of Germany's Kaiser Wilhelm II (1859-1941) is among the most significant creations in the history of British political satire. He appeared in over 160 Victorian and Edwardian-period cartoons in Punch alone, and more than twice that number during the 1914-1918 war.1 Wil helm was the subject of perhaps the most celebrated and widely recognized of all cartoons: "Dropping the Pilot," by master Punch cartoonist and "artist of Wonderland," Sir John Tenniel.1 Before and during the Great War, Wilhelm's image became ubiquitous, as an entire genre of Kaiser cartoons emerged to depict him as the epitome of the despised enemy, the "Horrible Hun."3 Such has been the attention attracted by Wilhelm II and his cartoon like ness, that the history-reading public has largely forgotten that there was another Kaiser before the Kaiser. While Wilhelm II has been the subject of numerous biographies, the focus of a major school of German histori ography, and several studies devoted to his cartoon guise, his grandfather Wilhelm I (1797-1888) has been neglected across all these same modes of historical enquiry.4 Only a few accessible biographies, and nothing like the attention from historians garnered by Wilhelm II, exist for the first Wilhelm.5 There has been no dedicated study in German or English of Wil helm I as represented in political cartoons save for a few mentions in the odd edited collection or article.6 However this Other Kaiser attracted just as much attention from British cartoonists as his grandson and successor, making the relative obscurity of such images surprising and problematic. In this paper I take a chronological approach in order to draw out the changing nature of cartoon Wilhelm in the three major Victorian comic periodicals, Punch (1841-1992, 1996-2002), Fun (1861-1901) and ]udy (1867-1906). Political cartoons are valuable graphic texts which "catch the spirit of the age" and contributed in a significant way to shaping that Zeitgeist.7 In the period under examination, Punch had become more con ©2011 The Research Society for Victorian Periodicals</page><page sequence="2">Victorian Periodicals Review 44:1 Spring 2011 servative after its early radicalism, but generally preferred to adopt no party-political stand.8 Fun and Judy were both founded as alternatives to Punch, Fun taking the Liberal (and often radical) end of the spectrum, while Judy campaigned for "Conservatism of the truest and bluest."9 The three journals also marketed themselves at distinctly different sections of society, with Fun and Judy (priced at a full penny cheaper than Punch) appeal ing to the lower-middle classes, while the senior comic weekly catered for those higher on the social ladder.10 During the 1860s, the journals also circulated widely, with 40,000 recorded for Punch, 20,000 for Fun·, and while we possess no reliable figures for Judy, it can reasonably estimated at somewhere in the middle." Circulation figures are a crude measure of a periodical's influence, and the presence of Punch, Fun, and Judy in public spaces-the communal libraries of gentlemen's clubs, doctors' and lawyers' practices, as well as the Parliament at Westminster itself-indicate their actual readership was well beyond conservative estimates of circulation.12 The three periods thus serve as a good guide to Victorian opinion of all shades, and in their cartoons of Wilhelm I are reflected a quarter-century of British attitudes towards Prussia and Germany in a pivotal period of European history. Those attitudes are often far more ambivalent than cur sory study allows for, or would be apparent from a mere comparison of the negative imagery of wartime. Cartoons of Wilhelm I need to be read for their subtleties. In such complex texts, "yesterday's friend often becomes tomorrow's enemy," with all the permutations in between those extremes. Just like his grandson, the cartoon Wilhelm was not always imagined as the Horrible Hun of 1914-1918 (or indeed of 1864 or 1870-1871), and the cartoons reflect a fascinating variety of opinion.13 As well as shedding light on their worth as sources for British attitudes towards Prussia-Germany, here I seek to suggest reasons for the myopia regarding cartoons of Wilhelm I. I propose that the chief reason for their obscurity is also the reason for Wilhelm I being largely forgotten by biog raphers and other historians. The Other Kaiser has been caught between two towering personalities: his aforementioned grandson Wilhelm II and his "over-mighty subject" Otto von Bismarck.14 Wilhelm I was from 1888, primarily used as an ideal type against which to measure the failings of his more prominent grandson, literally confining him to the background in cartoons.15 But it has been a focus on the rise of Bismarck in real political terms (Minister-President of Prussia from 1862, and German Reichskan zler after 1871), and also as a representative character that has obscured the important role played by Wilhelm I in British cartoons.16 Because Bis marck, enjoying the monarch's confidence, came quickly to wield effective power in Prussia-Germany during his period in office, Wilhelm is remem bered simply as the puppet of his chancellor, as in cartoons like "The Three Emperors" by Tenniel (fig 1).17 Given Wilhelm's historical lack of influence</page><page sequence="3">Richard Scully 71 PUNOH.

But the apparent imbalance of power between emperor and chancellor was evidently of little importance to British cartoonists until relatively late in Wilhelm's reign. The impres sion given by the images from 1863-1871 in particular is of Wilhelm as the dominant symbol of Prussia and Germany, not the Iron Chancellor. Only thereafter does Bismarck attain his position of cartoon supremacy. While this does not imply that cartoonists like Tenniel and his rivals at Fun and Judy imagined the real Wilhelm and not Bismarck to be the origi nator of Prussian policy, it is significant that the Prussian king remained prominent as the epitome of his country and its policies. Indeed it is in the cartoons and caricatures of Wilhelm that the origins of the 1914 1918 Kaiser Cartoon can be said to lie. During the long reign of Wilhelm</page><page sequence="4">72 Victorian Periodicals Review 44:i Spring 2011 I (1861-1888) and particularly during the Wars of German Unification (1864-1871), British cartoonists developed a specific set of metaphors and tropes for criticizing Prussia's military monarchy that would surface again in 1914, after a prolonged period of ambivalence.18 Exactly as in the Great War period, these focused upon the Kaiser regardless of the actual power exercised by the monarch relative to his chancellor, ministers or command ers. What was important for the cartoonists was that as "the Supreme War Lord, whose name was signed to every order of OHL," the Kaiser "seemed to be the author of all German acts," and hence the ideal target for such barbs.19 The artistic devices designed to turn the Kaiser into a partisan of Satan are evident in these earlier images, many of which first appeared in Punch and were reprinted by that iconic publication during the war years. Yet the relative dominance of Punch, and the relative obscurity of the Kaiser car toons of Fun's Matthew "Matt" Morgan (1836-1890) and Judy's William Boucher (fl. 1868-1906), may be counted as another reason for the myopia regarding images of Wilhelm I more generally, and reason enough for their analysis here. The careers of non-Punch cartoonists of the nineteenth cen tury have been notoriously difficult to track, and while Morgan is perhaps the best known (largely owing to his brilliant work for the radical paper The Tomahawk in Britain, and Frank Leslie's Illustrated Newspaper in the USA.), many of the other cartoonists dealt with here remain frustratingly elusive figures.10 That Morgan is now widely regarded as the most imagi native of 18 60s cartoonists; and that Boucher, in imagining Wilhelm I as a monster, created some of the "most powerful exemplars of the cartoonist's art," only reinforces the need for a close examination of this first genera tion of Kaiser cartoons.11 Of course, the original Kaiser cartoons were developed before Wilhelm actually attained the imperial title. This earlier genre was initially con cerned with his activities as King of Prussia, Wilhelm succeeding his late brother Friedrich Wilhelm IV on 2 January 1861. The broadly middle class readership of Punch, Fun and Judy, were already acquainted with the character of Wilhelm 1 by the time his cartoon self began to appear in the comic weeklies. Wilhelm, The "grape-shot prince" (Kartätschen prinz), was well known as a reactionary militarist. He was active in the counter-revolutionary campaigns of 1848, having been sent to London out of harm's way-during Prussia's brief flirtation with liberal government. Prince Wilhelm had also been at the helm of the Prussian state since Janu ary 1858 as Prince Regent for his mentally unfit brother. Upon accession in τ861 Wilhelm was therefore already associated with the militarism at the heart of the Prussian state, an aspect of power which he publicly professed was also closest to his heart. Accordingly, his cartoon self was bedecked in</page><page sequence="5">Richard Scully outrageously overstated versions of the spiked pickelhaube helmet exem plified in John Leech's (1817-1864) cartoon referring to "The Warsaw Conference" between Prince Regent Wilhelm, the Russian Tsar Alexander II and Austrian Kaiser Franz Joseph.12 The association of Wilhelm with militarism was made all stronger because he had inherited from his brother a conflict between the crown and Landtag over funding for the military. Striving as Wilhelm was to maintain the Hohenzollern dynasty's stranglehold on military policy, it is not surprising that Matt Morgan of Fun imagined him as "Stubborn Billy Pipeclay," an asinine despot refusing the counsel of his supposedly more enlightened wife and her British friends.13 That the donkey-eared king is called "Billy Pipeclay" is significant, as pipeclay is a substance used to pol ish weaponry and military regalia in preparation for the parade ground and drilling practice. Thus Morgan was pouring scorn upon the king him self as well as the Prussian fondness for the cosmetic aspects of militarism and the mere trappings of power. For Britons these were emblematic of an archaic system of government out of step with the modernizing world. This disdain for the semi-absolutist pretensions of the Hohenzollerns was a theme that would persist in British cartoons right down to 1914, when criticism of Prussianism reached its apogee in the new generation of Kaiser cartoons. The image of the stubborn Wilhelm was one which Morgan and Fun both established and maintained, though the imagery of the donkey was soon altered to the pig. "The Prussian Pig" (fig. 2), is a comment upon the situation in Germany more generally, and is significant for British under standings of the constitutional system of the German Confederation (of which Prussia was an influential member-state).14 The cartoon focused directly upon the efforts of Austria in the summer of 1863, to draw the disparate states of the loose Confederation into a tighter and more central ized union.15 Prussia had been engaged in a struggle to restrict Austria's influence within the Confederation since its foundation in 1815, and not unexpectedly, Prussian intransigence defeated the proposals of 1863. It was in fact King Wilhelm's new Minister-President Bismarck who was most active in Prussia's resistance; however these machinations were not apparent to British observers.16 Cartoonists like Morgan saw in Wilhelm's refusal to budge (or even attend the Frankfurt Conference to discuss the proposal) the decisive element in continued German disunity. Thus the porcine Wilhelm sits tight in the middle of the parlour, despite the efforts of the old maid "Vaterland" to initiate a chain reaction by setting fire ("Patriotism") to her stick ("Von Werther," the Prussian delegate to the Frankfurt Diet), which should beat the dog ("Bismarck"), causing it to bite the pig and scare it from the parlor. In Morgan's tortuous (and to mod</page><page sequence="6">74 Victorian Periodicals Review 44:i Spring 201 i Figure 2: Matt Morgan, "The Prussian Pig," Fun (5 September 1863) 245.

However, he appears as a faithful hound, far from the arch-manipulator and puppet-master he would become in later iterations. While the Minister-President would undergo considerable change in coming years, the "Prussian Pig" became a fixed point of refer ence for Morgan in the crisis that was to become the Second Schleswig Holstein War (1864), and came to represent for his readers not merely the person of Wilhelm I, but also the system and the state of which Wilhelm was the epitome. Lord Palmerston famously said of the Schleswig-Holstein question that it was so complicated, only three people had ever really understood it: "the</page><page sequence="7">Richard Scully Prince Consort, who is dead-a German professor, who has gone mad-and I, who ha[ve] forgotten all about it."18 The decision of King Christian IX of Denmark to annex the duchies of Schleswig and Holstein to his king dom was generally received with equanimity in Britain, but subsequent events produced consternation at a major European crisis on Britain's very doorstep. While the original Prussian Pig was merely stubborn and irri table, and subsequently a passive victim of Napoleon III or a player along side other caricatured powers, the Austro-Prussian invasion of Denmark (under the cloak of the German Confederation and German nationalism), transformed him rapidly into a more aggressive creature.1' In "Plucky Pigmy," Morgan showed the beginnings of a grossly uneven duel between the diminutive Christian IX and the towering, pig-headed Wilhelm, with Kaiser Franz Josef of Austria about to enter the fray.'° In succeeding weeks, as the war became more serious, Morgan used an ever more grotesque pig to depict events in Denmark, making the sympathies of his magazine perfectly clear. First, in "Old and True," Morgan focused upon the apparently cyni cal manner in which Austria and Prussia could patch up their differences when faced with an opportunity for easy territorial gain.31 The features of Wilhelm I, identifiable in previous cartoons despite his anthropomorphic appearance, were now totally subsumed beneath those of a tusked boar in a parody of a scene from Shakespeare's King John. But it was the siege and fall of Dybbol (or Düppel) to Prussian troops in mid April 1864 that led to Morgan venting his full anger at the aggressive policy of Wilhelm I and his government. Dedicated, "with every feeling of disgust to that enlight ened monarch," "The Pig-Headed Ghoul" (fig. 3) showed a gruesome boar toasting his victory with a goblet (half a skull) of blood.31 Around him Morgan placed evidence of the boar's unending thirst for "Blood" and "Dane Blood," with empty and full bottles of the stuff strewn at his feet, while a terrified footman approaches with a tray-full more for his mas ter's delectation. The evolution of Wilhelm I from the slightly ridiculous, stubborn pig of 1863 into the slavering monster of 1864 was complete by this stage. Such was the general disgust at Prussia's actions in Denmark that Fun's great competitor Punch also turned its ire on Wilhelm. In "The Reward of (De) Merit" (fig. 4), John Tenniel showed the pantomime char acter "King Punch" dangling a hangman's gibbet before a shocked Wil helm.33 This is a clear indication that with the new character of the war, the generally more moderate (even conservative) editors and readers of Punch shared the feelings of the more liberal Fun. After the high point of anti-Prussian feeling in the wake of Dybbol, rep resentations of Wilhelm remained firmly negative as the serious business of peacemaking got under way.

For Tenniel as for Morgan, there was a grim sense of satisfaction that the month-long armistice and accom panying peace negotiations represented a chance to thwart Austro-Prussian plans for conquest and, indeed, an opportunity for Britain to assert itself as the arbiter of Europe's balance of power. Notably, Morgan abandoned his Prussian Pig trope and joined Tenniel in the new convention of depicting Wilhelm and Franz Josef as thieves and butchers.34 However, in subsequent months, as the London Conference (April 25-June 2.5) failed to bring a negotiated end to the war, criticism of the belligerents became almost secondary to the issue of Britain's own responsibility. Strenuous debate ensued over whether Britain should intervene in the conflict, with Prime Minister Palmerston and Foreign Secretary Russell meeting opposition to an intervention from within the cabinet, as well as from Queen Victoria herself.35 The different sides of politics also divided on the issue, and as a result, the brief meeting of minds between the more conservative Punch and the liberal Fun ended. While Tenniel sought to divert attention from Britain's humiliating loss of diplomatic face (in accordance with Punch's editorial policy), Morgan found this unacceptable, and he turned his ire on a scrawny, louche-looking British lion in "The Lion and the Jackass."36 In a return to the imagery of the pre-war period, King Wilhelm appeared again as a stupid donkey, taunting Britain while trampling a paper labeled "Denmark" without fear of reprisal. The months and years following the conclusion of the Second Schleswig Holstein War can be seen as marking the end of the first phase of Wil helm I's depiction in British political cartoons. The shift towards a new manner of representation was a gradual one, however, and elements of the 1861-1864 period remained apparent as Europe entered an uncertain post-war lull. The image of the thief or brigand initially endured in repre sentations of the Prussian monarch and his Austrian counterpart. Morgan and his successors at Fun saw in the further round of peace negotiations (for what eventually became the Peace of Vienna) evidence of the Prus sian and Austrian highway robbery of Denmark. Morgan continued to pin ultimate responsibility on "Billy, the Bandit of Berlin" and a cynical Franz Josef; and this imagery lent itself well to subsequent depictions, as the gulf between Prussia and Austria widened, and Punch and Fun expressed their satisfaction at the consequences "When Rogues Fall Out."37 The coming of the Austro-Prussian or (Seven Weeks) War in 1866 led British cartoonists to reflect not only upon the justice of war between the two aggressors of 1864, but also to return to an earlier theme from 1864. The earlier scuffle between Denmark and the Prussian Pig was seen as a</page><page sequence="10">78 Victorian Periodicals Review 44:i Spring 2.011 necessary context for what Britons arguably feared most from the crisis, the opportunity for Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, to acquire influ ence and territory. So too during 1866 it was not exclusively Prussian mili tarism, but fear of French opportunism that occupied the minds of Tenniel and others. "When Rogues Fall Out" shows Napoleon (and his off-sider King Victor Emmanuel II of Italy) standing ready to snatch the bags of loot labeled "Rhine Provinces" and "Venetia," in an echo of Napoleon's mak ing off with the "Rhine Provinces" in Morgan's "The Bone of Contention" two years earlier.38 An awareness of Napoleon as the real danger in any squabble between Prussia and Austria seems to have inhibited a return to the vicious imagery of the Prussian Pig in depictions of Wilhelm I during 1866. Other factors also prevented a return to full-blown anti-Prussianism. When the contours of the war became clear, Italy allying with Prussia to gain the lrridenta of Venetia from Austria, an equal share of the blame was given by cartoonists to the Austrian and Italian monarchs, with Wilhelm only one of several aggressors. Indeed the outbreak of the war itself was treated in ironic form by Morgan's successor as Fun's cartoonist, with the three as armor-clad knights in "A Peace Demonstration," and all profess ing only the most chivalrous motivations.39 Tellingly, in the centre back ground of the image the cartoonist showed the real threat: Napoleon III, as a rather ridiculous (though faintly menacing) arbiter of the coming joust. Wilhelm was therefore seen as no more or less guilty of hypocrisy and war mongering than the others involved in the "wicked war," and this was a view shared across the political spectrum.40 Tenniel's allusion to Macbeth's "Three Witches," showed Wilhelm as the personification of a calculating evil-doer, with still only one of a trio of Shakespearean hags, brewing the foul broth of "War" (with a miasma of "Fire," 'Crime," "Ruin," "Pesti lence," "Famine" and "Slaughter" emanating from their cauldron).4' As the war progressed and Prussian successes against Austria's other German allies mounted, a further shift back in imagery occurred to focus on Wilhelm as aggressor, but this was not a straightforward return to the styles of 1864. By contrast with 1864, in which Punch was more reserved in its criticism than its liberal rival, it was Tenniel who came to express the most damning criticism of the Prussians. "Check to the King" showed a grim-faced Wilhelm scoffing at the suggestion that his subjects "object to be[ing] slaughtered," as reported by Bismarck, his equally dour Minister President.42 "Check to the King" also signaled another set of significant shifts in the manner in which Wilhelm I was depicted by British cartoon ists. Not only was Punch now taking the lead in criticizing Prussia directly, but also in the changing understanding of Prussian, and European, politi cal realities. From the commencement of Punch's Seven Weeks' War, the</page><page sequence="11">Richard Scully figure of Bismarck, previously little more than a faithful mutt, yapping at the heels of Wilhelm, now began to assume a stature (literally) of equal proportions to his royal master. Indeed, for the remainder of the Seven Weeks' War, Bismarck and Wilhelm were used interchangeably by the car toonists of Fun and Punch when characterizing the policies of Prussia. There is a pattern to be discerned in the cartoonists' choice of either Wilhelm or the now-popular figure of Bismarck. It seems that when Wil helm was presented, the cartoonist intended him to act as a cipher for Prussia itself, while the use of Bismarck reflected that individual's talents as a statesman. For some months Fun continued to present Wilhelm as a representative figure for a Prussia still in danger from French pressure, but Tenniel saw Bismarck as a statesman of such great influence as to be one of the "Rival Arbiters" of European peace (alongside the Emperor of the French).43 Tenniel and Punch were so taken with the Minister-President's personal influence that he was shown as the frustrator of Napoleon Ill's personal ambition to profit from the upheavals in Germany. This was a role for which no statesman (outside of Britain) had previously been imag ined capable. Indeed the emperor was reduced to little more than a chif fonier or rag-picker in "Peace—and No Pieces," turned away from the avenues of power by a Bismarck exuding control and ironic deference.44 By contrast, Fun saw France (represented by Napoleon) still in a position to threaten Prussia (in the form of Wilhelm I) in "Peaceful Persuasion" (fig. 5).45 Initially, therefore, Punch was happy to laud the talents of Bismarck, but the more liberal Fun could not bring itself to adopt such an attitude. That the meaning of Wilhelm's cartoon self had shifted from represent ing the person of the Prussian king to the nation he ruled can be seen in other cartoons from 1866 and 1867. "A Pause in the Game" shows the nations of Europe represented by their respective sovereigns, engaged in a game of roulette (and at which Wilhelmine Prussia is the chief player).46 The outcome of peace negotiations between the powers (not the individual monarchs) seemed to Britons to be akin to a gamble, in which Prussia's vic tories gave it an advantage, but the "house" (France) threatened to profit as well. Similarly, "The Latest Move On" refers to the towering figure with Wilhelm's features as "P. C. Prussia," not the person of the king himself, while the hirsute and bespectacled members of the German brass band he is dispersing are representative of the different German states and not their individual sovereigns.47 The cartoon is a bad pun on the dissolution of the German bund (Confederation) by Prussia, which effectively ended Austrian influence over the German states. Though concerns at increased Prussian military and diplomatic power had prompted a backlash in 1864, it seems that the latest European reshuffle occasioned no immediate con cerns from British cartoonists. Indeed the dispersal of a noisy, irritating</page><page sequence="12">8o Victorian Periodicals Review 44:1 Spring 2011 SI2 OF ONE—HALF-A-DOZEN OF THE OTHER Figure 5: [George and Edward Dalziel], "Peaceful Persuasion," Futi (21 July 1866) 191. Image courtesy Monash University Library, Rare Books Collection. German-style brass band (still a recent import to Britain in the 1860s) by a fine upstanding constable would most likely have elicited chuckles of concurrence from Fun's readership. "To Be Sold," Tenniel's later comment on the continued Prussian occupation of Luxembourg by a towering Wil helm, was likewise a joke at the expense of a diminutive Napoleon III and stereotypical Dutchman.48 If the period of the Austro-Prussian War saw Wilhelm I increasingly used as an emblematic figure for Prussia and all that Prussia was believed to stand, this underwent consolidation and further evolution during the last great conflict to disturb Western Europe before 1914. The Franco-Prussian War not only saw Wilhelm retain his position as the epitome of Prussian ism, but also, from early 1871, his transformation into an emblematic fig ure for the new German Reich. In this the cartoons mimicked reality, as the King of Prussia assumed the title of German Kaiser after 18 January 1871, but in many ways British cartoonists pre-empted this transforma tion, imagining Wilhelm as the archetypal German emperor well before the real foundation of the empire took place. Wilhelm therefore became not only a representative figure for the real King of Prussia and German Kaiser and a representative of Prussia and Germany as European states, but also a metaphorical figure for the historic spirit and destiny of the Ger</page><page sequence="13">Richard Scully man nation. In this, cartoonists anticipated the role ascribed to Wilhelm's grandson in the second generation of Kaiser cartoons, but it is worth not ing just how ambivalent were many of the attitudes expressed during the 1870-1871 conflict. Britons observed with mixed feelings the shattering of French hegemony (or at least the threat thereof) and its replacement by the new power of Germany in what Benjamin Disraeli famously claimed was a greater watershed for modern history than the French Revolution.49 Given that it was Napoleonic France which declared war and took the first offensive action, it is unsurprising that some sympathy should initially have been directed to the German states. Frederick Barnard's (1846-1896) first comment in Fun on the conflict showed the castle-cragged Rhine as the backdrop for an imagined production of "The Modern Caesar."50 Despite this sympathy for the German side, in Queen Victoria's words "most unjustifiably attacked, fighting for hearth &amp; Home," the earliest references to the war also established a general ambivalence of feeling.SI Punch's first rhyme on the subject spoke of "Prussian Pot and French Kettle," and of "exactly equal" feelings towards the belligerent parties.52 Likewise the first Punch cartoon of the war to depict Wilhelm I showed him as an upstand ing gentleman about to engage in a personal duel with Napoleon, with nei ther figure in caricature, but realistically and neutrally depicted.55 A week later, both John Tenniel in Punch and William Boucher in Judy chose the most impartial of metaphors from the many available to them, imagining Napoleon III and Wilhelm I as on equal footing before John Bull. Remark ably, both cartoonists settled upon the same proverbial "Six of One, Haif a-Dozen of the Other" when detailing their respective papers' attitudes towards the war (though it must be said the Boucher offering contains considerably more artistic merit than Tenniel's (fig. 6).54 A lack of favorit ism was emphasized by Barnard in Fun also, the cartoonist imagining a Prussian and French cat fighting outside the window of a sleep-deprived John Bull, and thus equally to blame for the commotion.55 This shows a remarkable sense of cross-party consensus, as Judy; or, the Serio-Comic Weekly positioned itself to the right of politics and sought to cater for a more solidly conservative readership than its moderate (Punch) and liberal (Fun) rivals. Punch's anonymously authored (and untitled) rhyme decry ing France and Prussia as "blackguards both!," but still harboring feelings "for them that rise for Fatherland," may be taken as illustrative of the general mood.56 As the war escalated, however, and continued beyond the apparently logical end-point of the crushing French defeat at Sedan, opinions began to change. While Punch, Judy, and Fun had begun the war united in their nonpartisan attitudes, between September and October 1870 they began to diverge, each in the process seeking out a position which they were to</page><page sequence="14">82.

Each idiom, one serious, but ambivalent; one cynical and satirical; one hostile in the extreme, was significant for the development of the cartoon Wilhelm. Punch remained largely detached, and though increasingly critical of Prussian-German actions, it continued to depict Wilhelm I in an honorable fashion as the main Prussian protago nist. Fun initially returned to the theme of French culpability, but as the Siege of Paris took hold, it increasingly adopted a critical attitude towards Prussia, though expressing this in relatively playful form. At Judy the tone adopted was extreme in its Prussophobia, and for the first time since Matt Morgan's "Prussian Pig" of 1864 (anticipating the Kaiser cartoons of</page><page sequence="15">Richard Scully i9I4-i9i8), a British cartoonist blatantly demonized Wilhelm I as a bes tial and demonic figure, hell-bent on conquest and bloodshed. Just as Tenniel had initially portrayed Punch's neutrality by representing the French and Prussian monarchs as upstanding gentlemen engaged in a duel, at its conclusion, he retained that sense of impartiality, providing the sequel "The Duel Decided" without any trace of caricature or bias.57 For some weeks thereafter, Tenniel and his editors were largely content to com ment on the epic nature of the continuing battle between France and Prus sia-Germany, eschewed open demonization of the Prussians, and instead simply urged a peace settlement. Indeed the Wilhelm I who appeared (alongside his son Friedrich) in "A Word to the Wise" continued as a noble figure, the classical Ulysses, betraying a flattering attitude not before seen in the pages of Punch.$s After September, Punch's imagining of the con flict often now included the feminized figure of "Germania" in place of Wilhelm, but still displaying the satisfaction of Tenniel and his editors to avoid an overly judgmental stance, while shifting subtly towards sympathy for the French.59 Interestingly, Winston Churchill later attributed his atti tudes towards France and Germany to these cartoons, partially inspired it seems by an adolescent preference for the more attractive figure of the French "Amazon."60 Germania aside, it is notable that for Punch, Wilhelm continued to be the central emblematic figure for Prussia-Germany, and the preference in 1866 for depicting Bismarck did not resurface until after the Franco-Prussian War had ended. By the onset of winter, and with the German siege showing no signs of abating, Tenniel shifted to a depiction of Wilhelm I as a mighty Teutonic warlord and medieval emperor, even before the real Wilhelm adopted the title of Kaiser on 18 January 1871. The series of Tenniel's Punch cartoons from "Demand Thy Life!," to "Vae Vietisi", form something of a progres sive narrative, as first the noble French chevalier refuses to surrender to the terrible demi-god Wilhelm, despite his position of weakness.61 In "Gaul to the New Caesar," the French figure has been feminized, but still refuses to surrender to a Wilhelm now possessed of imperial robes.61 This cartoon in particular is a curious amalgam of classical and medieval-romantic allu sions, as France is imagined as the defiant barbarian (though clad in Clas sical garb) and Wilhelm as the civilizing emperor (though he wears the iron crown and robes of a barbarian, or Floly Roman Emperor). By February's "Call off the Dogs!" the female figure (now labeled "Paris," not "France") is no longer defiant, but in despair; and Wilhelm's serene gaze from the earlier cartoon has been replaced by a grim determi nation.6' Interestingly, Tenniel positions Bismarck at the ear of the now more obviously barbaric Kaiser (though it is unclear whether the now Reichskanzler is urging a cessation or prolongation of hostilities). With</page><page sequence="16">84 Victorian Periodicals Review 44:i Spring 20ii "Vae Victis!" Tenniel's sequence concludes. The cowering figure of Paris (as evidenced by her discarded civic coronet) threatens to be trampled by the hooves of Wilhelm's horse. The Kaiser's headgear harks back to that in "Demand Thy Life!," and the title of the cartoon is an allusion to the victory of the barbarian Celts over Rome in 387 BCE, marking a further transition in the figure of Wilhelm 1.64 These images are difficult to read, as they show the Prussian King-cum-German Kaiser as a barbaric figure, but also one possessed of a certain Wagnerian grandeur. Though Churchill was understandably drawn in sympathy to the French figure in the cartoons, Wilhelm's depiction as the historical embodiment of German nationhood gives the impression of an ambivalent rather than straightforward attitude on the part of Punch. This becomes clearer when contrasted with the atti tudes expressed by Tenniel's rivals over the same period. Unlike Punch, Fun's cartoons did not maintain the magazine's early ambivalent position, nor indeed did Wilhelm I ever really appear as the sole source of Prussian-German policy as he had done in 1864 and 1866. J. Gordon Thompson's (1840-1893) Wilhelm was more often imagined as just one of three actors, alongside Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke, and the increasingly common Bismarck.65 In many ways, the replacement of Wilhelm by Bismarck as Fun's representative figure for Prussia, noted earlier, reached its natural conclusion in 1870-1. Thompson replaced Fred erick Barnard as chief cartoonist at Fun in September (remaining there for the next twenty years), taking up the same themes as his predecessor.66 Both cartoonists focused on the magazine's initial wartime theme, portray ing Napoleon III as the villain of the piece and taking pleasure in imagining him swept away by a tide of blood or suffering the fate of his great-uncle as "History Repeats Itself."67 Thompson's first cartoon in which Wilhelm featured as the key figure, "The Uplifted Sword" may in fact have provided something of an inspiration for Tenniel's "Word to the Wise," as they bear striking similarities in style and theme.68 The Fun cartoonist adopted a Classical allusion simultaneously acknowledging Wilhelm as the victor in an honorable contest, but also advocating the end of violence, as in an ancient gladiatorial bout. Though expressing similar sentiments, Thompson's cartoon was more satirical than Tenniel's (lampooning rather than flattering its subject) and that element of satire characterized all his subsequent cartoons of the war. One suspects he enjoyed working in this playful format, as he was simul taneously penning much more serious and realistic illustrations of the war for the weekly Graphic.69 Thompson by turns imagined Bismarck, then Wilhelm, as semi-ridiculous figures or as arch-manipulators of events. He depicted the Iron Chancellor deliberately exacerbating the turmoil in Paris in "German Cookery," but then acting as the intermediary between</page><page sequence="17">Richard Scully a feminized France and his own omniscient royal master in "Spenlow and Jorkins-German Translation."70 However, the most significant of Thom son's cartoons detailing Bismarck's position relative to the new Kaiser appears in "Vaterlanders," a collection of various images of stereotypical Germans.71 In the top left hand corner, Thomson produced the first repre sentation of Wilhelm as the puppet of his chancellor, an image which came to dominate cartoons of the Kaiser post-1871. Wilhelm as a background figure, or as one exhibiting unrealistic pretentions was thus the final form of Fun's Kaiser, and not as the representative figure he was for Prussia Germany in Punch. In Thomson's most serious cartoon, "The Demon Suc cess: Germany's Peril," it is not Wilhelm but a diabolical Bismarck who has swept the fearful young maiden Germania off on a Walpurgis-Night ride across battlefields strewn with skeletons.71 While despite its sobering subject matter, Fun maintained an almost playful cynicism over the events of the war, Judy in contrast adopted a much more serious attitude. Unlike Punch's subtle shift, tinged with persis tent ambivalence, at Judy, the transformation from the unbiased position of July-August was absolute and shocking. Following Sedan, in a series of "highly serious, indignant cartoons," William Boucher expressed a disgust at Prussian militarism not seen since 1864 and which was not to be equaled in savagery until 1914.73 In the first of these, Boucher showed a repul sive, pickelhaube-wear'mg ape, running amok in the palace of European civilization. The ape of "Modern Warfare" (fig. 7) bears the unmistakable features of the Prussian king, and though he was never again to be imag ined in this simian form, Boucher's Wilhelm was successively re-imagined as a demonic character, at home only in a war-ravaged wasteland.74 Thus Boucher's Wilhelm may be regarded as the true heir to Matt Morgan's "Prussian Pig," and the most important development in the Kaiser Car toon genre before the Great War. That "Modern Warfare" appeared so soon after Sedan, when Punch and even Fun were imagining Wilhelm as a noble figure, shows just how varied the attitudes of British cartoonists were towards Prussia-Germany in this period. Boucher persisted in his damning portrayal of Wilhelm, imagining ever more complex diabolical forms for him to embody. From the ape of "Modern Warfare," Boucher's Wilhelm became a demon riding a double-headed eagle, its maw dripping blood as it terrorizes the allegori cal population of France below (threatening even the infant Republic in its cradle).75 Thereafter he is (along with Bismarck) a bandit come to plunder the figure of France and ravish a feminized Paris, in imagery reminiscent of the 1864-1866 period referred to above (fig. 8).76 Boucher even imagined Wilhelm as the demon Sheikh-al-Bahr (the Old Man of the Sea) of Sinbad fame, riding on the back of a Phrygian-capped "French Sinbad," through a wasteland of death and destruction.77</page><page sequence="18">86 Victorian Periodicals Review 44:i Spring 2011 Figure 7: William Boucher, "Modem Warfare," Judy (7 September 1870) 196-97.

Image courtesy Monash University Library, Rare Books Collection.</page><page sequence="19">Richard Scully Boucher's cartoons were undoubtedly the most powerful of the Franco Prussian War years, but not all his motifs were entirely original, and he in fact employed certain artistic details taken from the work of his con temporaries. In "About Time!" Boucher argued for British and Russian intervention to stop a wide-eyed Wilhelmine Prussia beating a wounded Frenchman (fig. 9).78 Not only was Boucher's Wilhelm possessed of a John Leech-inspired over-sized pickelhaube (see above), but he was also wearing around his neck the "Order of St Gibbet" awarded by Tenniel and King Punch in May of 1864. This shows a not insignificant degree of cross-fer tilization occurring between the comic weeklies and strengthens the notion of the Kaiser cartoons as a self-reflexive genre. If the comic weeklies had spent most of the war producing contrasting images of Prussia-Germany and its rulers, then the peace terms dictated by the victors again prompted them to unify their stance. Contemporaries were appalled by the massive indemnity demanded of France (5 billion francs to be paid over three years), and Boucher in Judy saw little need to stray from a workable metaphor, continuing as he had for much of the war to depict Wilhelm I as a robber and brigand. Almost as soon as the armi stice was signed, he was convinced that looting was now the Germans' aim and depicted the Kaiser "flush'd with greed of gain" as a crowned thief, a sack of "plunder" over his shoulder and now the holder of a decoration of two crossed gibbets in place of the one bestowed by "King Punch" in 1864.79 In "Fallen Among Thieves," Wilhelm is joined by Bismarck and Moltke, all dressed in pantomime highwayman's garb, while pickelhaube wearing minions spirit away bags labeled "Plunder for Fatherland," "20 Years Revenue of France," and "f4oo,ooo,ooo,ooo."8° In Fun, Thomson showed Wilhelm sitting smugly on a pile of money bags in "Peace at a Price," while Tenniel in Punch also condemned the severity of the terms though, in keeping with Punch's more restrained atti tude, he depicted Bismarck as an attorney having demanded an "Excessive Bail" relative to the assault of his client.81 Interestingly, Tenniel's figure of Justice does accept part of Bismarck's claim, illustrating that, even after a war whose events had threatened to sunder completely any feelings of closeness to Germany, Punch could at least recognize that Prussia (and by extension Germany) was the wronged party. Indeed, the attitude of Punch was to swing even further back towards the Prussian-German side in the aftermath of the war, as in the illustrations for the Preface to Volume 61 of the magazine. Here the eponymous Mr. Punch is depicted enjoying the triumphal celebrations in Berlin, riding alongside Kaiser Wilhelm and the Crown Prince.82 The end of the Franco-Prussian War also saw the end of cartoon Wil helm's dominant role as the focus of German politics. Save for a Tenniel</page><page sequence="20">88 Victorian Periodicals Review 44:1 Spring 2011 Figure 9: William Boucher, "About Time!" Judy ( 1870). Image courtesy Monash University Library, Rare Books Collection. large-cut showing him as the antagonist of Pius IX during the first stages of the Prussian Kulturkampf against organized Catholicism, few cartoons in Fun, Judy, or Punch used Wilhelm in the same way as they had before 1871.83 It was Bismarck who was now firmly in the ascendant, not merely as a satirical representation of the Iron Chancellor himself, but more and more as a representative character for Germany and German politics. Wil helm did make some brief appearances. Significantly for later depictions of Wilhelm II, Linley Sambourne imagined Wilhelm I as a child (surrounded by toy soldiers, broken swords, and drums) attempting to swallow the world and sure to meet with an uncomfortable end.84 Wilhelm also appeared as the epitome of semi-absolute monarchy (alongside Kaiser Franz Joseph and Tsar Alexander III) in Fun's "The Meeting of the Emperors."85 But as noted above, even as a representative of untrammelled monarchy, over at Punch Tenniel imagined Wilhelm as a puppet of Bismarck, forced into making</page><page sequence="21">Richard Scully public assertions of monarchical privilege by a devious and cruel chancel lor. In addition, one notable example emphasizes an aspect of the Kaiser's real self which had not featured in previous cartoons, his age. "The Old 'Business'" by Tenniel shows Wilhelm as a feeble old man about to grasp the hot poker of "Absolutism" proffered by Bismarck (as the pantomime clown Pantaloon).86 Wilhelm was now not energetic enough to compete on equal terms with his chancellor, even in the cartoon world. By the last years of his life, Wilhelm I's cartoon self underwent one penultimate transformation into a venerable monarch and symbol of Ger man nationhood above reproach. Tenniel's commemorative cartoon for the Kaiser's ninetieth birthday epitomizes this new deference, with "Father William" seated in his parlor and wearing the garb of a merry medieval monarch.87 Significantly, the arms and armor previously worn by Wilhelm in "Demand Thy Life!" and "Vae Victis!" are now hung up as monuments to a glorious career, with no hint from Tenniel of the mixed feelings such warlike accessories elicited in the 1870s. The absence of Bismarck also served to downplay Wilhelm's recent history as a puppet of the Iron Chan cellor, focusing only on the Kaiser as one deserving of Mr Punch's warm est congratulations (delivered rather presumptuously "on behalf of the world"). Less than a year later the praise of British cartoonists was again forthcoming as Wilhelm's reign finally came to an end on 9 March 1888. Tom Carrington in Fun depicted the late Kaiser's bust strewn with memo rial wreaths, those of England prominent among them.88 The unsigned cartoonist of Judy adopted the same scenario, though rather than show merely the tokens of British regard for Wilhelm, he had Britannia herself garland the Kaiser's bust with a laurel crown of victory.89 For Punch and Tenniel, the image of a hopeless, disheveled German eagle served to epito mize the loss of a beloved ruler and guarantor of stability.90 It was also as a paragon of monarchical virtues that Wilhelm initially spent his cartoon afterlife. As I noted at the beginning of this paper, he was reconstructed as an ideal type in order to more clearly portray the defi ciencies of the new Kaiser, Wilhelm II, who succeeded to the throne after the ninety-nine day reign of Kaiser Friedrich.'1 However, the comfortable retirement of Wilhelm I was disturbed in 1914, when his cartoon self was mobilized one last time, in order to establish an image of Germany as a longstanding threat to world peace and British liberty. In Punch, along side other cartoons of Germany from the Victorian and Edwardian eras, images of Wilhelm originally highly ambivalent in tone were re-cast and simplified with very different connotations. "Gaul to the New Caesar" was removed from its original context and instead used to show that "The Prussian Bully" had had "no pity for France" in 1870, just as it had none in 1914.92 That France was refusing to surrender at the time of the car</page><page sequence="22">9o Victorian Periodicals Review 44:i Spring 201 i toon's first appearance was immaterial for the new audience, as well as for a magazine which wished to show off its supposedly prophetic knowl edge of German ambitions. The original Kaiser cartoons thus formed an important foundation and extension of the new, far more pervasive, genre, as the supposed nefarious plans of Wilhelm II were imagined as merely an extension of his grandfather's earlier warmongering. Punch prided itself on the "lucid intervals of foresight" in its relationship with the cartoon Wilhelm but regretted having been deceived by the "treach ery of Germany's false pretences" for over fifty years.9' By 1914 Fun and Judy were defunct (and hence unable to remind the British public of their own contribution to awareness of successive Kaisers' plans for world domi nation), but a great many of those who saw or read these images in their original form must have been reminded of their power. Though Winston Churchill later paid particular tribute to the work of Tenniel in the 1870-1 period, he acknowledged the impact "other famous cartoonists" had in forming his sympathy for France over Prussia-Germany, which was rekin dled in 1914. So many of the tropes established by Morgan, Boucher, Bar nard and Thomson reappeared in the new Kaiser cartoons that it is difficult to believe that a new generation of cartoonists did not have some knowledge of what had gone before. The outright demonization pioneered by Morgan and Boucher, as well as Thomson-like satire, now worked in tandem to serve the needs of a British public fighting against all that the figure of The Kaiser stood for. Though he appeared in an age when there was no military confron tation between Britain and Prussia-Germany, the Other Kaiser played just as important a role in shaping British attitudes towards Germany as his better known cartoon successor. Further study of his appearance in European and New World cartoons (notably those of his native Prussia-Germany) will only serve to add to our understanding of the Other Kaiser.
