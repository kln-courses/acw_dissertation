The Causes of War: Economic, Industrial, Racial, Religious, Scientific, and Political. EDITED BY ARTHUR PORRITT (New York: The Macmillan Company. 1932. Pp. xxix, 235.) Problems of Peace, Sixth Series; Lectures Delivered at the Geneva Institute of International Relations, 1931. BY H. J. LASKI, A. E. ZIMMERN, AND OTHERS. (New York: Oxford University Press. 1932. Pp. xv, 301.) Three books could scarcely be found to demonstrate more forcibly the wide range of approach which characterizes the current attention to what is broadly called "peace." The first assumes the existence of a body of standards sufficiently accepted and sufficiently certain to warrant police action in their defense. The second examines the areas of human friction with special reference to their mollification. The third varies in quality and standpoint, but discusses some real questions raised by the present regime of the human race attempting to function without having its political machinery blow up under it. The political scientist may be inter- ested in the first two approaches; he can get something out of the third. Boycotts and Peace is a collective study initiated by the Twentieth Century Fund and competently executed. The job is really done twice in two ways, and it is a matter of judgment which direction the reader se- lects. The book is a contribution, rather than a conclusion, to the subject. The economic research findings bring together the largest amount of per- tinent information as to the operation of embargo and sanction yet col- lected; they leave much uncertain as to efficacy and methodical efficiency. The political research findings concentrate attention upon the position which the United States would take, or be left in, if sanctions were de- cided upon by the League of Nations. The report of the Committee on Economic Sanctions precedes these findings, and is not derived from them. Apparently, none of it is based on the economic findings, and the legal and political proposals are definitely passed over. It deals persua- sively with the heinousness of "trading with the treaty breaker," with special reference to the Pact of Paris. The committee suggests a supple- mentary protocol by which parties to it, "in the event of hostilities, ac- tual or threatened," should consult and determine "upon measures of non-intercourse." Boycotts and Peace clarifies a part of the problem, but</page><page sequence="2">130 THE AMERICAN POLITICAL SCIENCE REVIEW still fails to place sanctions in the scheme of things. Some people object to sanctions as a use of "force"; others seem to believe in nothing else. As a matter of fact, a large mechanism, delicate and resourceful, exists to handle problems too hot for the disputants. It gets into motion promptly, unless both parties are equally bent on starting a fracas. The real problem of sanctions is where in that mechanism they should be introduced. The Twentieth Century Fund might continue its work by seeking the answer. The Causes of War is a series of reports, as indicated by the subtitle, by rapporteurs of Commission No. 1 of the coming World Conference for International Peace through Religion. When the reviewer first looked at the book, he thought it was another of those anthropomorphic products in which special writers were going to argue that war originates in their particular interests. It is not, and no writer claims that his subject is the nucleus of the world's trouble. In the seven chapters, economic, religious, cultural, and political factors are regarded as "causes"; industrial, labor, and racial conditions are regarded as "influences"; while the papers on science and the press discuss their relation to international disturbance. Each essay precisely describes circumstances within its field which create frictions between peoples. A broad sanity lies in these helpful papers, which throughout respond to Sir Arthur Salter's remark: "If explosions are to be prevented, the peoples of the world must work positively and cooperatively at finding a safety valve for the explosive forces, and not merely defensively at national policies designed to direct the explosion elsewhere." The Problems of Peace preserves, for the sixth time, lectures delivered annually at the Geneva Institute of International Relations. There are now seventy-eight of these papers in volume form, counting in the present twelve. It is only in monographs that the newest features and problems of international relations can be found, until the slower process of book- making digests crowding developments. The best analytical paper in 1931 was on "The Codification of International Law," by John J. Hearne. There were six of quite even merit dealing with "The World Commu- nity": "Public Opinion," by Paul Scott Mowrer; "Labor," by George A. Johnston; "Europe," by Alfred E. Zimmern; "Russia," by Sherwood Eddy; "America," by James W. Garner; and "The British Empire," by E. J. Phelan. After an excellent introduction, Paul H. Douglas, in "World Unemployment and its Reduction through International Cooperation," reaches conclusions that can be debated. Henri Rolin constructively views the disarmament problem. Paul Leverkuehn gives a well-ordered account of international financial relations. Robert Redslob is rather light on "The League as a Confederation." Finally, Harold J. Laski has some success in developing "The Theory of an International Society." DENYS P. MYERS. World Peace Foundation.</page></plain_text>
