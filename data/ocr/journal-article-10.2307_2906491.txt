<plain_text><page sequence="1">Crossing Over: Kafka's Metatextual Parable Charles Bernheimer Post-structuralist poetics has invented a new kind of pastoral paradise. In this deconstructed dia-verse, freeplay is king. Wholes are out, pieces in; centers are displaced into margins; bricolage is the model for creation; the book itself, as a fiction of unity and coherence, is subverted by the corrosive action of its own textuality; the "self" is a comforting delusion, identity a mirage, the ego a slippery double agent; the father is more important as metaphor than as biological progenitor; language is not a medium of subjec- tive expression and mastery but the instrument of the subject's "beneficent expropriation"' by an alien, metaphorical structure. It seems as if the so-called "uncanny critics"2 had managed to remove all anxiety from the fantasy prevalent among schizophrenics of the body fragmented into pieces. Their practice of assimilating every- thing to textuality makes of the human psyche a kind of avoidance machine, constantly displacing, substituting, replacing, sliding and slipping away. A-void-dance, a dance around the void. Nietzsche is, of course, the thinker most often cited to support the possibility of a joyfully affirmative attitude towards the abysmal world of freeplay. This attitude, Derrida claims in a now famous passage, "is no longer turned toward the origin, affirms freeplay and tries to pass beyond man and humanism, the name man being the name of that being who, throughout the history of metaphysics or of ontotheology-in other words, through the history of all of his history-has dreamed of full presence, the reassuring founda- tion, the origin and the end of the game."3 Note that Derrida says MLN Vol. 95 Pp. 1254-1268 0026-7910/80/0955-1254 $01.00 ? 1980 by The Johns Hopkins University Press</page><page sequence="2">M L N 1255 the Nietzschean path "tries to pass beyond man and humanism," not that it actually does. Nietzsche was, in fact, by no means as ready as are some of his putative disciples to dismiss the unifying and binding functions of Eros. Thus he declares on numerous occasions that man cannot live without a belief in some essential ground for knowledge. For example, in The Will to Power, he writes: "To make even the tiniest degree of knowledge possible an unreal and erroneous world had to be born: beings who believed in the permanent, in individuals, etc. It was necessary first of all that an imaginary world be born that was the contrary of the eternal flux. Then, on this foundation some knowledge could be built. In short one can well see the fundamental error on which all is based (be- cause antinomies can be thought) but this error can only be de- stroyed with life itself; the final truth, which is the eternal flux of all things, does not allow itself to be incorporated into us; our organs (which serve life) are made for error."4 Permanence, identity, "man," these are, says Nietzsche, erroneous illusions built on a purely invented structure of opposition. But since they are nevertheless necessary for the continuance of life, their illusory quality must be forgotten, at least a good part of the time. Life must be sustained, even at the expense of a loss of lucidity and the preservation of illusions that, because we forget their error, gen- erate knowledge that appears as true. Contemporary critical theory tends to interpret the text as a structure defined by its unforgetting lucidity. Such a definition privileges those textual strategies that subvert the difference be- tween inside and outside, subject and object, and thereby block any possible incorporation of the literary illusion. The specifically tex- tual is seen as a fluctuating movement of metaphoricity, a flux hostile to the existential basis of daily life. The psychoanalysts D. W. Winnicott and Marion Milner have argued that this basis is formed through the mother's initial adap- tation to the infant's needs, an adaptation which, when good enough, is so complete that the infant has the illusion that external reality corresponds to its own capacity to conceive of it.5 This illu- sion of merger or fusion, according to Winnicott, creates the foun- dation for a sense of being in terms of identity and self, and this reassuring trust in permanence and individuality eventually ena- bles the baby to move away from the mother into the potential space of play. This description of creative play as generated by an essential confidence in the continuity and stability of a supportive context is</page><page sequence="3">1256 CHARLES BERNHEIMER antithetical to Derrida's idea of centerless freeplay. Winnicott's biological model, with its insistence on maternal origin and the ontological value of illusion, is far too normative and linguistically naive to be acceptable to Derrida. But I want to argue here, through a close reading of Kafka's short text "On Parables," that textual structure engages both the Derridean void-dance and the Winnicottian fusion-illusion. Kafka's parable, in my view, dramatizes the complex interaction of these two psychopoetic orientations and demonstrates in exemplary fashion the necessary existence of both as structural poles between which the text is sus- pended. Here is Kafka's text, written in 1922 or 1923, in my translation.6 On Parables Many complain that again and again the words of the wise are merely parables [Gleichnisse] but useless in daily life, and this alone is all we have. When the wise man says: "Go across" ["Gehe hiniiber"] he does not mean that one should go across to the other side, which one could accomplish without further ado if the result were worth the journey; but he means some fabulous beyond [sagenhaftes Drdiben], something un- known to us, something which even he cannot designate more precisely [ndher], and which therefore cannot help us here at all. Actually, all these parables are merely saying that the incomprehensible is incomprehensi- ble, and that we knew already. But what we have to struggle with every day, those are other things. Thereupon someone said: Why do you resist? Should you follow the parables, then you would yourselves become parables and with that already free of your daily labors. Another said: I bet that is also a parable. The first said: You have won. The second said: But unfortunately only in parable. The first said: No, in reality; in parable you have lost. The complaint of "the many" concerns the question of the right use of language. These pragmatists have a clear sense of how words should function. They should be transparent vehicles of designa- tion, unproblematic tools helping man to act more efficiently in his daily struggle with things. Linguistic signs should dissolve in favor of the objects they signify; they should refer precisely and unam- biguously to the world we "have," the world present to us through sensual apprehension. Taken to its logical conclusion, the demand of the many is for a language that would radicalize the "natural"</page><page sequence="4">M L N 1257 connection inherent in symbolic structure by covering each sepa- rate, heterogeneous object in the world with a word signifying that object and it alone. Such a language would be almost entirely metonymic, dependent on the spatio-temporal continuum of the outside world.7 The reason the many distrust the words of the wise is that these words do not convey an immediately identifiable referential meaning. They do not designate the familiar world where the self struggles to master things, but suggest instead a movement towards a fabulous beyond, towards some unknown and unspecifiable ab- sence. Not that the sage uses words that are in themselves fabulous and incomprehensible; his hortatory enunciation is obscure not because of its exotic vocabulary but because it lacks an intentional object. The many are told neither what to cross over nor to where; nor is the outcome of the suggested crossing elucidated. Without such clear designations, the many cannot judge the value of dis- placing themselves into a sphere outside their own empirical ac- quaintance. For them, "the other side" presents no epistemological or ontological problems. It exists in proximity and could be gone over to without difficulty, if the result could be shown to be worth the effort. Otherness is defined in terms of empirical differences, differences measurable, for instance, in terms of distance to be traversed and time to be spent in transit. Thus, instead of being a guide to action, the sage's words per- form a certain unsettling deviation in the many's relation to reality and to truth. They begin with a postulate: the man who says "Go across" is recognized to be a sage who speaks the parabolic lan- guage of wisdom. Yet this language subverts the many's sense that truth is immanent in the things of this world and that words are true insofar as they function mimetically to make those things in- telligible and subject to order. The words of the wise, paradoxi- cally, are wise precisely insofar as they allude to a meaning ir- recuperable within the many's predominantly metonymic framework, the framework of Eros. Otherness, in the discourse of the wise man, escapes designation, cannot be thought of as "near" or "close." It is always elsewhere, always beyond, in the realm of myth, legend or fable. This realm acts as an unknowable supple- ment to the world the many assume as given. As the etymology of sagenhaft implies (related to saying, to story), the constitution of this fabulous excess derives from the freedom of language to posit any referent regardless of its presence or absence. The sagenhaft</page><page sequence="5">1258 CHARLES BERNHEIMER exploits the metaphoricity of language, its irresponsible fictionality; hence the many's irritation at its uselessness in their daily struggle with things. The difference between the many and the wise may be eluci- dated in terms of Nietzsche's distinction, in "On Truth and Lie in an Extra-Moral Sense," between the reasonable man and the intui- tive man. Both, says Nietzsche, desire to rule over life, "the first by knowing how to obviate the principle difficulties through foresight, cleverness and regularity, the second, as an 'overly joyful hero,' by not seeing those difficulties and taking as real only life dissimulated as illusion [Schein] and beauty."8 Nietzsche differentiates these two classes of men primarily through their attitudes to the fundamen- tally metaphoric quality of language. For as Nietzsche describes its genesis, language is at least doubly metaphoric: first a nerve im- pulse is transferred into an image, then that image is transformed into a sound. Each "crossing-over" involves "a complete leaping over spheres right into a totally other and new one" (p. 373). In fact, Nietzsche finds that images, which he calls perceptual metaphors, are most often themselves submitted to further metaphorization before their transformation into sound. This happens because social training teaches us to condense potentially artistic and individualized first impressions into pre-existent con- ceptual molds that bear the stamp of recognized truths. These truths are then no longer apprehended as metaphors, for their generation through a process of multiple transfers and leaps over gaps has been forgotten. The reasonable man collaborates in this strategy of forgetting. "Only by forgetting that primitive world of metaphor," Nietzsche writes, "only by the hardening and numbing of a mass of images that originally streamed forth in ardent fluidity from the primal capacity of human fantasy, only through the unconquerable belief that this sun, this window, this table, is a truth in itself, in short only insofar as man forgets himself as subject, and indeed as artistically creating subject, does he live with some peace, security and conse- quence" (p. 377). The reasonable man, like the many in Kafka's parable, wishes to live according to these values, the values of Eros. He does not want to question the status of his language or of the world designated in that language. Language for him performs the role of what Winnicott calls a "transitional object." Such an object, typically a blanket or teddy bear, symbolizes simultaneously the child's unsayable feeling of identity with the mother and his/her sense of difference and separation from her. It functions to link the</page><page sequence="6">M L N 1259 inner and the outer, the created and the found, but only so long as its own position in relation to these oppositions is not challenged. The many's reasonable confidence that a language of truth could symbolically "cover" the world derives from their trust in the nec- essary and proper link between words and things and in the stable identities of both subject and object. Consequently they believe that there is such a thing as "correct perception, which would mean," says Nietzsche, "the adequate expression of the object in the sub- ject" (p. 378). The intuitive man, on the other hand, not only does not forget the metaphorical derivation of language but exploits its indepen- dence from the bonds of reference in order to exuberantly create new forms and ideas in the realm of myth and art. This man con- siders language to be entirely rhetorical, entirely figural, and hence, from the point of view of the truth-expectations of the rea- sonable man, entirely deceitful. Language does not provide a tran- sitional bridge from a subjective inside to an objective outside. Rather it establishes a free aesthetic relation in which both subject and object are created as loci of metaphoric transfers: "For between two absolutely different spheres," comments Nietzsche, "as be- tween subject and object, there is no causality, no correctness, no expression, but rather, at best, an aesthetic relation, I mean an allu- sive transfer [andeutende Ubertragung], a translation which stammers after in a completely foreign language-for which it would, how- ever, in any case need a freely composing and freely inventing middle-sphere and middle-force" (p. 378). Language is a dis- simulating in-between that makes any supposed "knowledge" of self or other purely allusive and alien. The "overly joyful hero" celebrates this liberating ignorance by tearing apart the spatio- temporal continuities and the stable identities dear to the man of Eros: "The liberated intellect destroys [the scaffold of concepts], throws it into confusion, ironically puts it together again, pairing that which is most foreign and separating that which is closest" (p. 382). By making all signifiers into interchangeable pieces free from any constraining context of reference, the intuitive man metaphorizes metonymy. Nietzsche seems to recognize the relation of this process to the death instinct when he remarks that the intui- tive man "suffers more intensely [than the stoic man who governs himself with concepts] when he suffers; and indeed he suffers more often, because he does not understand how to learn from experi- ence and always falls again into the same trap [pit] he fell into before" (pp. 383-384). Whereas the reasonable man searches to</page><page sequence="7">1260 CHARLES BERNHEIMER attain "peace, security and consequence" by putting faith in the cognitive value of his own experience, the intuitive man has no such faith, experience for him being a constantly renewable play of aesthetic possibilities. This play may be the radical truth of art, but it is dangerous to the life that sustains art. Commenting on the above passage in Nietzsche, Paul de Man links it to an aphorism written at the same period: "Truth kills, indeed kills itself (insofar as it realizes its own foundation in error)."9 The intuitive man is self-destructive exactly to the degree that he metaphorizes the life-sustaining structures of Eros. Let us return now to Kafka's parable. It remains to be demon- strated that the wise man in the parable is homologous to the intui- tive man in "On Truth and Lie." An analysis of the closing dialogi- cal section of the parable will, I think, justify the homology. The first speaker in this section appears to have taken upon himself the task of explaining the meaning of the wise man's exhortation to "Go across." His explanation, however, is itself in parabolic form, and hence just as useless in the daily life of the many as was the statement it purports to elucidate. This, in effect, is what the sec- ond speaker, a representative of the many, maintains, even stating his conviction in the form of a bet. The first agrees-yes, my state- ment is parabolic, you win. But only in your terms, that is, from the point of view of reality, from the point of view that insists on the referential function of words and encourages one to forget the free-floating metaphoricity of language. From the point of view of parable, the substitution of one metaphoric discourse for another does no more than reveal the very principle of parabolic structure. So the individual who imagines he can deconstruct parable by pointing to its lack of grounding in reality is a loser ignorant of parable's irresponsible independence from the world of reference. Not only does the one parable substitute for the other, it also repeats that other. The first speaker's advice to follow the parables repeats the wise man's advice to go across to what the many con- ceive as a "fabulous beyond." The exigency of parable seems to remain the same no matter what the form of its expression. The speaker simply identifies what is sagenhaft as parable itself and interprets the result of crossing over into that undefinable realm "beyond" as actually becoming parable. Thus the goal of the Gleichnis is to promote gleich-werden, the dissolution of conscious difference into the self-expression of words. Such a dissolution would do away with language as a stammering translation, aesthetic transfer or allusive crossing. The sign in this state would be entirely</page><page sequence="8">M L N 1261 enclosed within its own self-reflective system, self and world as- similated into the abstract metaphoricity of language. Such an as- similation, as the dialogic structure opposing win and loss indicates, signifies pure loss in terms of reality, i.e. death. To follow the parable is to fuse into language is to die to the world and thus be free of one's daily labors. Clearly, neither the wise man nor his avatar, the first speaker, have taken their own advice, for had they done so they would themselves have become sagenhaft and hence no longer able to "say." Thereby they would have radicalized the aesthetic activity of Nietzsche's intuitive man to the point of dissimulating life entirely into the realm of rhetorical illusion. And, as Kafka remarked, "one cannot express that which one is, since that is precisely what one is; one can only communicate that which one is not, i.e. the lie."'0 In effect, it is only because the wise have refused their own exhorta- tion to become parable that they can be represented in the textual world, where the only truth is that of the lie. Their textual existence belies their advice and signifies the successful resistance of Eros to the urges of Thanatos. It should be clear now that the goals both of the many and of the wise lie outside the reach of language. The many want words to signify things purely metonymically, the wise want words to signify other words purely metaphorically. But language can only exist as a constant process of crossing between these two unattainable limits, to which it can at most allude in what Nietzsche calls an an- deutende Ubertragung. Hence the wise man's saying "Go across" may be read reflexively as defining the very structure of the text that inscribes it. This text mediates between the "here" of metonymic dependence and the "there" of metaphoric independence. This allusive mediation un- dermines the apparently clear-cut opposition between reality and parable. For "reality," as the many wish it to be signified, is based on the same kind of setting-at-equality that characterizes the telos of parable. In the one case words are set as equal to things, in the other as equal to themselves. The first operation is described by Nietzsche as follows: "All thought, judgment, perception as Ver- gleichen [comparison] has as its precondition a Gleich-setzen [positing of equality] and earlier still a Gleich-machen [making equal]."" The second operation absorbs whatever lies outside per- ception and judgment. Its effect is suggested by Zarathustra's parodic reversal of the famous closing lines of the mystical chorus in Faust: "Alles das 'Unvergangliche'-das ist auch nur ein</page><page sequence="9">1262 CHARLES BERNHEIMER Gleichnis"' 2 (All that is permanent, unchangeable, that too is merely a parable). So the text may be seen as mediating between two modes of Gleichnis, one directed towards a metonymic positing-of-equality with reality (das Vergingliche), the other to- wards a metaphoric positing-of-equality with parable (das Unver- giingliche). The positions adopted by the two speakers at the close of Kafka's text can be articulated within a structure of mutual contradiction only because each speaker ignores the impossibility of the Gleich- machen that defines his own claim to truth. Each asserts that he stands on a firm basis from the perspective of which the grounding of the other appears fictional, mystified, illusory. But actually the ground of each is fictional from the outset. It is subject only to Andeutung, to approximate approach, but never to the perfect capture of self-coincidence or of antithetical contradiction. "My repugnance for antitheses is certain," Kafka wrote in his diary. "It is true that they make for thoroughness, fullness, completeness [Gritndlichkeit, Fille, Lfickenlosigkeit], but only like a figure on the wheel of life; we have chased our little idea around the circle. [Antitheses] are as lacking in nuances as they may be different, they grow under one's hand as though bloated by water, beginning with a prospect of the unlimited, they always end up in the same medium size."' 3 Liickenlosigkeit (literally, "being without gaps") is the goal of Gleich-machen. Hence it motivates both speakers in the text and determines the structure of their opposition. That opposition dramatizes the conflict between the two poles of textual structure, both of which may be thought of as belonging to a parabolic sagenhaftes Driiben. This conflict, however, is staged within a text that implicitly develops a quite different notion of parabolic structure. In effect, Kafka's text does not advocate a Gleich-machen either in the Erotic sense of the many, or in the Thanatotic sense of the wise. Kafka's text goes across without advancing any goal to the crossing and without choosing between the opposed modes of otherness proposed by the many and the wise. In this sense, his text never "arrives." It articulates, as he says about antitheses, a middle or medium sphere of suspended significance. Unable to attach it- self either to a subject or an object, a presence or an absence, it composes an aesthetic structure by transferring and translating in-between. It is metatextual not in the sense that it comments on an earlier text or scriptive act that it inscribes. Rather the metatext is meta in that it is structured as a dramatization of the conflict</page><page sequence="10">M L N 1263 between the psycho-textual orientations that constitute it. If pur- sued exclusively, either one of these orientations becomes parabolic. Hence Kafka's text can be termed a parable of metatex- tuality only if it is understood that metatextual structure undoes the concept of parable advanced within the text itself. Nevertheless, the suggested existence of both parabolic poles is necessary to en- sure the metatextual suspension that excludes them. This explains why, despite Kafka's distaste for antitheses, his texts are so often structured in terms of conflict, confrontation, battle. Critics have repeatedly misread these texts by trying to de- fine the goal of the struggle. But the goal is entirely structural: what is at issue is whether the struggle can be maintained, whether a confrontation is at all possible, whether lucidity will not destroy the life-sustaining organs that make for error. The struggles of Joseph K. in The Trial and K. in The Castle are not battles against overwhelming paternal authorities but rather futile efforts to con- struct such authorities so that confrontation and battle can take place. Both K.'s strive to invest unity, presence and unequivocal meaning in what is dispersed, fragmented, duplicitous.'4 Antithesis is a structure of error, Kafka recognizes, but one closely related to the wheel of life and capable generating a ground for being on the basis of the Erotically charged attributes of Griindlichkeit, FEille, Liickenlosigkeit. Thus, although both the mutually exclusive op- positions of the many to the wise (in Kafka) and of the rational to the intuitive man (in Nietzsche) are deluded in their antithetical structure, this delusion reflects the texts' truth to life as error. Kafka would agree with Nietzsche's declaration, in Beyond Good and Evil, that "without accepting the fictions of logic, without measur- ing reality against the purely invented world of the unconditional and self-identical [the world of the Gleichnis], without a constant falsification of the world by means of numbers, man could not live."'5 Thus Nietzsche denies the possibility, evoked by Derrida in his name, of a complete break with human history and a celebration of the freeplay of metaphoricity. This freeplay, which would do away with the erroneous logical and metaphysical structures of opposi- tion, contradiction and antithesis, constitutes an unreachable limit that Nietzsche, like the wise man in Kafka's text, can imagine, but that only a superman, a being somehow always awaited in the fic- tional future, could embody. So despite Nietzsche's statement, in The Gay Science, that "one could conceive of such a pleasure and power of self-determination, such afreedom of the will that the spirit</page><page sequence="11">1264 CHARLES BERNHEIMER would take leave of all faith and every wish for certainty, being practiced in maintaining himself on insubstantial ropes and pos- sibilities and dancing even near abysses,"' 6 this conception defines an "overly joyful" utopia which falsely pretends that the truth of flux can be incorporated into man. "Truth is indivisible," declares Kafka in one of his aphorisms, "therefore cannot know itself. Anyone who desires to know it must be a lie.'7 At the one pole of textual structure is the indivisibility of flux, death-oriented truth of the wise, at the other the indivisibility of individual objects, life-oriented truth of the many. The metatext treats this polar opposition as a lie necessary to life and to knowl- edge, and hence to its own generation. Yet it does not allow this structural lie to appear as its own truth. It recuperates that truth allusively by collapsing the opposition between truth and lie that seemed to constitute its ground, leaving a middle-sphere limited to the irresolvable process of Andeutung. The notion of Andeutung is related to the etymological meaning of the English word "parable." Deuten in German means to interpret, explain, signify, while an as prefix refers to a temporal future or spatial remove. "Parable" derives from the Greek paraballein, to compare. This word in turn is composed of the prefix para which has a variety of meanings when employed in compounds, among them beside, beyond, subsidiary to, faulty, harmful, plus the verb ballein, to throw.'8 So parable is a throwing to the side of or in front of, with the implication that this act, performed in order to compare, is somehow faulty or wrongful. Etymologically it is closely related to diabellein, literally to throw across but figuratively to slander, and hence to diabolus, slanderer, devil. Thus the parable, which presents itself as a story illustrating a truth, suggests through its etymology that no truth can be illus- trated, that any comparison is a diabolic throwing-across whose very figuration is a slanderous distortion. "Writing," Kafka told Max Brod, "is the reward for serving the devil."'9 Andeutung, I want to stress, operates in both directions of semantic structure, the metonymic and the metaphoric. But I would not be true to Kafka's intense spiritual exigency, if I did not grant that the crucial going-across, for him as for the wise man, is to the metaphoric pole. Thus in an aphorism he uses the word an- deuten to describe the only possible mode of writing about what is subjective or transcendent: "For all things outside the phenomenal world," Kafka declares, "language can be employed only in the manner of an allusion [andeutungsweise] but never even approxi-</page><page sequence="12">M L N 1265 mately in the manner of a comparison [vergleichsweise] since in ac- cordance with the phenomenal world it is concerned with property and its relations."20 The Vergleich, like the Gleichnis, works to equalize, to make the same. Only whereas the Gleichnis attempts to do this by excluding the opposed pole of psycho-textual structure, the aim of the Vergleich is to appropriate the metaphorical in terms of the metonymic, that is, to end the play of crossings and transla- tions by binding the polar modes into one stable semantic union. In contrast, Andeutung respects and encourages this play. Thus, for Kafka, both the inward, psychological realm and the metaphysical world beyond can only be intimated as an always-elsewhere to which one can never cross over and to which no comparative structure can be thrown across.2' But language is just as ineffectual and deceitful when dealing with the property relations to which it is, nevertheless, restricted. This is brought out in Kafka's diary entry for December 6, 1921: "Metaphors are one among many things that make me despair of writing. Writing's lack of independence, its dependence on the maid who tends the fire, on the cat warming itself by the stove, even on the poor old human being warming himself. All these are inde- pendent activities ruled by their own laws; only writing is helpless, cannot live in itself, is ajoke and a despair."22 Here Kafka bemoans the inevitable contamination of metaphor by metonymy. Metonymic structure forces language to be dependent on the jux- tapositions given in the world (maid tending the fire by which lies the cat and next to which sits the man). Yet this very dependence keeps language at a distance from the self-determining status of the givens themselves. On the other hand, when writing attempts to liberate itself from the limitations of reference by adopting the over-reaching structure of metaphor, it is inevitably brought back to the realization of its necessary reliance on the phenomenal world. It is this dependence on the context of daily life ("and this alone is all we have") that deconstructive criticism tends to dismiss as naive, nostalgic and mystified. Derrida attacks the notion of a con- straining context for meaning, whether real or linguistic, by as- serting that all writing is subject to being lifted out of its intentional framework and grafted onto any number of different signifying chains.23 This structural possibility, he argues, means that any con- textual presence is arbitrary and that any apparent communication enabled by reference to a context can have no privileged cognitive function. But the logic of Kafka's parable suggests that Derrida's</page><page sequence="13">1266 CHARLES BERNHEIMER entire enterprise itself has an all-engulfing context: the death in- stinct, that process by which all of human experience is absorbed into the groundless freeplay of metaphoric substitutions. The motivating fantasy here seems to be one of physical invulnerability, the image of the text as an organically unified body being displaced by an iconoclastic conception of an unending process of textual production, a kind of mechanical performance.24 In contrast to the sophisticated appeal of this "fabulous beyond," the many's attach- ment to the immediate experiential context of their daily labors may well seem unimaginative and limiting, even regressive if it is linked to the infantile experience of identification with the mother. But Kafka, unlike the contemporary advocates of the abyss, admits his vulnerability to the exigencies of this limit and does not pretend that either life or a text is conceivable apart from the structuring function of Eros. The many's need to trust the referentiality of language and their acknowledgement of dependence on a world rendered intelligible through perception and experience make them the representatives of what Roland Barthes would call the text's lisibilit6. These days it is more fashionable to insist on the breaks, gaps, ruptures, fissures, maimings, dismemberments, etc., that undo the text's meaningful coherence, as if that coherence were a naive illusion born of an essentially extra-textual imperative, an immature and unreflective need to believe in identity and permanence. I have tried to dem- onstrate that this naivete is as much a part of textual structure as is the disseminating force that frustrates its demands. So, textually speaking, the opposition of naive and disillusioned readings may be yet another erroneous distortion produced by the devil within the parable.

Coleridge in The Statesman's Manual: "[The symbol] always partakes of the reality which it renders intelligible, and while it enunciates the whole, abides itself as a living part in that unity of which it is the representative") and the psychoanalytic description of the early infant-mother relationship (cf. Heinz Lichtenstein: "Just as an organ within an organism is both 'separate' and 'symbiotic,' the infant is one with the mother, but simultaneously there is a primary relatedness of a part to a whole"-"Identity and Sexuality: A Study of their Interrelationship in Man," Journal of the American Psychoanalytic Association, 9 [1961], p. 202). In this connection it is interesting to note that Roman Jacobson's analysis of the polar structures of language (in Fundamentals of Language, The Hague: Mouton, 1956) suggests that metonymy is the semantic structure of dependence. The utter- ances of aphasic patients unable to think in terms of similarity and metaphor are entirely dependent on the verbal or physical context. These patients cannot utter words except in reference to presence and cannot understand the exis- tence of synonyms since for them no one word is substitutable for any other, each thing having only one word bound to designate it properly in a given context. I have examined the psychopoetics of metonymy and metaphor at some length in the theoretical introduction to my book Flaubert and Kafka: Studies in Psychopoetic Structure to be published by Yale Press in the fall of 1981. The present article will appear in somewhat different form in this book. 8 Friedrich Nietzsche, "Uber Wahrheit und Luge im aussermoralischen Sinne," in Nachgelassene Schriften 1870-1873; Vol. III, 2 of Nietzsche Werke, ed.

At least descriptive psychology is probably in its entirety an anthropomorphism, a projection out- side the limits. The inner world can only be lived, not described." Then he goes on to suggest that psychology is a failed metaphysics: "Psychology is the de- scription of the reflection of the earthly world in the heavenly plane, or more correctly: the description of a reflection such as we, nurslings of the earth, imagine it to ourselves, since a reflection does not occur at all, we see only the earth wherever we turn" (Hochzeitsvorbereitungen, p. 72). 22 Tagebiicher, pp. 550- 1.

De Man suggests that "as soon as the text is said not to be a figural body but a machine, . . . the possibility now arises that the entire construction of drives, substitutions, repressions, and representations is the aberrant, metaphorical correlative of the absolute randomness of language, prior to any figuration or meaning" (p. 299). De Man argues that, whereas the chain of substitutive figures has a bodily analogy in mutilation, the text's performative rhetoric is entirely mechanical and arbitrary.</page></plain_text>
