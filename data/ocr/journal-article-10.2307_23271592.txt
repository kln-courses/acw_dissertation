ISBN 9780521879750 Hbk. £55/$90; ISBN 9780521705615 Pbk. £19.99/$30) The changing body, the latest volume in the Economic History Society's 'New Approaches to Economic and Social History' series, provides a fascinating synthesis of a great body of work, much undertaken by the authors, but also incorporating the research of, at least, demographers, economists, nutritionists, and historians. It will change the way we view historical populations. It is not, however, a book that will be absorbed easily; several re-readings will be necessary to grasp all the nuances of interpretation encapsulated both in the text and in the many tables, graphs, statistics, and appendices. The first chapter outlines the book's principal aim: to link growth in childhood, mor tality (and morbidity), adult living standards, labour productivity, food, and manufacturing output. It is a model of how to introduce concepts to be used and explored, highlighting caveats and making sure definitions are clear, and also warning that the bringing together © Economic History Society 2012 Economic History Review, 65, 3 (2012)</page><page sequence="2">1204 BOOK REVIEWS of perspectives from different disciplines will 'link phenomena and findings of previous studies which are simultaneously obvious or taken for granted by some, and a revelation to others' (p. 2). One of the concepts introduced is that of 'technophysio evolution', a (hopefully) virtuous circle whereby the nutritional status of one generation, along with the technology at their disposal, influences their capacity for work and thus their output which dictates their standard of living, and, in turn, along with fertility and the distribution of wealth, affects the nutritional status of the next generation. The authors' contention is that technophysio evolution over the last 300 years has led to humans gaining 'an unprec edented degree of control over their environment'—a very different scenario from that of previous generations. The second and third chapters form the 'technical core' of the book, discussing how to measure or estimate such phenomena as height, food consumption, calorie intake, and energy expenditure from fragmentary historic evidence, and then analysing, in consider able detail, long-term trends in these factors across the societies and centuries under study. Chapters 4 to 6 consider technophysio evolution and human health in, respec tively, England and Wales, continental Europe, and the US. They contain a plethora of statistics, drawn from various ranges of time between 1700 and the present, which will be eagerly pored over by many scholars from diverse disciplines and will surely be the basis of much future research in a wide range of fields. The arguments are presented on a variety of levels of detail; however, in short, demographic and anthropomorphic evidence is produced which suggests that the population of England and Wales was, on average, better fed, both in terms of the number of calories consumed and also with regards to the type of food eaten, some foods being easier to absorb and producing fewer 'unused' calories in the form of waste. This resulted in the English and Welsh being taller than most populations in the rest of Europe, with a greater proportion of their number being sufficiently fit to undertake 'a day's work', which may have allowed the industrial revo lution to flourish earlier in Britain. A great many urban workers in continental Europe, in contrast, had to wait until the later nineteenth century before they could consistently expect to be fed adequately in terms of nutrition. It is instructive to consider the pro portion of the various populations which would have been so malnourished that they would have been unable to manage more than a few hours 'strolling' each day (thought to represent the 'begging population'), and to consider the implications for pre-1700 communities. In the eighteenth and early nineteenth century, US technology was well behind that found in either England and Wales or Europe, but there appears to have been more food available per capita and, until large cities developed, the population was rather less prone to infectious diseases because of the sparsely distributed population. Ameri cans appear to have been taller and longer-lived than Europeans at this time. Chapter 7 moves on to the late twentieth and early twenty-first centuries and carries the arguments forward to consider 'recent trends and future prospects' and to unpack the reasons for the epidemics of 'obesity' or 'over nutrition' currently holding sway in many parts of Europe and, in particular, the US. Space precludes a detailed examination of the many nuanced points and arguments presented to make the authors' case for the complex, and tangled, pathways between nutrition, health, and economic development that are 'technophysio evolution'.The reader is left with many questions, the answers to some of which are to be found through a patient delving deeper into the text. However, as a culmination of many years' work, this publi cation presents scholars from a wide range of disciplines with a 'state of the art' overview of current understanding of the interaction between a population's nutritional status, physical stature, health, and economic well-being which will undoubtedly be a cornerstone text for many years to come.
