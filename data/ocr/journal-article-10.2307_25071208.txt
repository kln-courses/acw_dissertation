<plain_text><page sequence="1">17 The 'Jupiter' Symphony in C, K. 551 New Perspectives on the Dramatic Finale and its Stylistic Significance in Mozart's Orchestral uvre* Simon P. Keefe The Queen's University of Belfast, UK Few works in the western music tradition have received more lavish praise than Mozart's 'Jupiter' Symphony. Although periodically criticized at the end of the 18th century and in the 19th century for its over-abundance of 'harmonic riches,' erudition and 'laborious technical procedures,' in short for '[pushing] things a little far,'1 the 'Jupiter' quickly established itself as a classic, a symphony perceived as shattering, exalted and 'wholly above discussion,' featuring a last movement that is 'without doubt the most successful masterpiece' in the symphonic medium.2 While down to earth 20th-century analytical studies of the 'Jupiter' Symphony inevitably set deified views of the work into welcome relief, they cannot obscure the fact that a large proportion of 20th-century commentators are to all intents and purposes in awe of it, especially its famous finale.3 * Earlier versions of this article were read at the University of California at Berkeley, 7 Sept. 2001, the University of Oregon, 18 Sept. 2001, the Conference on the Music of the 'Classical' Period, King's College London, I Dec. 2001 and the 14th Annual Meeting of the Royal Musical Association, Irish Chapter, 4 May 2002.

Keefe Influential critics from the first half of the century lace their writings with free-wheeling superlatives. For Georges de Saint-Foix, for example, the 'Jupiter' is not only 'the veri table symphonic testament of Mozart' but also a decisive, climactic moment in sweeping historical terms, Mozart '[revealing] to us all that music has achieved up to this time, and what it will do nearly a hundred years later.'4 Eric Blom is scarcely more circumspect than Saint-Foix, deeming extended commentary superfluous in light of Mozart's achievement: 'The dizzy culmination comes in the coda [to the finale], where all five themes appear together in various juxtapositions.... We may leave the Symphony at that, I think. What more could be said?'5 Even in the more sanguine, post-war musicological climate, critical hyperbole has continued to infiltrate scholarly discourse: Robert Dearling, admitting to a kind of critical impotence where the extraordinary finale is concerned, explains that '[a]ll a writer can do is to list the themes that are involved and point out a landmark or two,' and ends with a highfalutin description of the movement's coda as 'a grand sum mation, a fugal apotheosis that combines all six subjects in a transcendental display of polyphony to form a magnificent peroration'; Hugh Ottoway explains the finale as 'one of the marvels of Classical music,' Wilhelm Spohr as a 'triumphant exaltation' (sieghafte Erhebung) and Jean-Victor Hocquard as a religious movement with connotations of Assumption,' 'glory' and 'a light atmosphere of heavenly peace, as imponderable as an ancient mystery'; Heinrich Eduard Jacob claims for the symphony as a whole 'the allure of a God, who idly opens his hand to release it from a world'; Stanley Sadie describes the Finale's coda as 'an apotheosis of invertible five-part counterpoint without parallel in the symphonic literature'; and, most recently, Robert Gutman writes that the finale is 'a movement of unexcelled diversity and intellectual power... in which an astonishing E.

Mozart delivers forcefully on Sulzer's and Schulz's requirements that the 'allegros of the best chamber symphonies contain profound and clever ideas..., an apparent disorder in the melody and harmony [e.g. mm. 233-53], strongly marked rhythms of different types ?passim]... free imitations of a theme (often in fugal style) ?passim], sudden modulations and digressions from one key to another [mm. 158-224], strong gradations of loud and soft ?passim]... [and the combination of] all the voices with one another such that the resulting sound seems almost like a single melody that is in need of no accompaniment [especially mm. 372-401].'9 To be sure, Sulzer's and Schulz's theoretical prescriptions are realized in numerous late 18th-century symphonic movements. Their invocations of the aesthetics of the sublime, however?the high, exalted style to which the symphony should aim?appear, at an initial glance, especially appropriate to the 'Jupiter' finale.10 As Elaine Sisman has recently argued with considerable scholarly panache, the fugal writing and learned style manifest in the finale characterize an elevated style opening access to the sublime."

Keefe end of the section (mm. 326-32) and the double fugue and canon in five-part invertible counterpoint in the famous coda (mm. 371-401)?embody, in Sisman's formulation, 'an ecstatic trajectory, identifying a sublime turn, creating bafflement and blockage, and finally exultation.'12 The 'contrapuntal chaos' of the coda, moreover, captures the overwhelm ing nature of Immanuel Kant's mathematical sublime, '[revealing] vistas of contrapuntal infinity' and creating 'a cognitive exhaustion born of sheer magnitude.'13 To some extent, Sisman's reading of the sublime in the Jupiter finale renders explicit in historical and aesthetic terms the innumerable expressions of awe in the critical literature. For in order to appreciate the sublime a listener or reader must experience bewilder ment; as Horace explains 'we are excited and exalted and overwhelmed by its speed and energy, it is useless to argue and analyse, we are swept away as soon as we begin to read.'14 In addition, the mathematical sublime involves, in Neal Hertz's formulation, 'the fear of losing count or of being reduced to nothing but counting... with no hope of bringing a long series or a vast scattering under some kind of conceptual unity'15 thus accounting for the bafflement of critics who feel that prose is an inadequate mechanism for conveying the extraordinary qualities of the movement. Whether in the coda to the 'Jupiter' finale Mozart actually crosses the line between on the one hand counterpoint that can be fully absorbed by a cultivated listener cognizant of contemporary musical and aesthetic trends, and on the other hand 'vistas of con trapuntal infinity' revealing a 'mass of simultaneously writhing fragments, at all rhythmic levels and in all instruments... [that] cannot be taken in,'16 is difficult to judge. But it is certainly possible that 'ideal' late 18th-century listeners?say Heinrich Christoph Koch's intelligent listeners 'who come entirely dispassionate to the place where music will be performed'17?could have 'taken in' the musical sophistication of this section, at least in such ways as to have been able to process their experience in a sanguine rather than an exalted and reverential fashion. To be sure, early 19th-century references to the 'Jupiter' as a 'fearful symphony' and a 'great, all-powerful and shattering' work by Rochlitz and Carl Maria von Weber, respectively, allude to the sublime.18 In the absence of specific references to the overwhelming, sublime-orientated nature of the contrapuntal segments of the finale's recapitulation and coda, however, Sisman's interpretation of the function of this section remains, at least from an historical perspective, open to question. 12 Sisman, Jupiter' Symphony, p. 78. 13 Sisman, Jupiter' Symphony, p. 79. 14 Quoted in Sisman, Jupiter' Symphony, p. 14. 15 Hertz, The End of the Line: Essays on Psychoanalysis and the Sublime, New York, 1985, p. 40; also quoted in Sisman, Jupiter' Symphony, p. 19. 16 Sisman, Jupiter' Symphony, p. 79. 17 Koch, Versuch einer Anleitung zur Composition, Leipzig, 1782-93, 3 vols., vol. 2, p. 19; quoted in Aesthetics and the Art of Musical Composition, p. 146. 18 See Gernot Gr?ber, Mozart and Posterity, trans.

It would be very difficult not to conceive of the last movement as an 'apo theosis finale' given the thorough synthesis of learned and galant styles, as James Webster points out,19 and therefore not to hear the movement in general terms as a denouement with considerable dramatic import. Moreover, it would be equally difficult to interpret the finale's own conclusion (the contrapuntal segment of the coda) as anything other than the movement's climax, given the prevalence of fugal and imitative counterpoint in the main body of the movement and the intensification of these contrapuntal procedures in the coda. Although generalized notions of drama and the dramatic in late 18th-century orchestral music reflect a long-standing critical preoccupation with its anthropomorphic qualities, their use in an a-historical fashion is unlikely to cast late 18th-century works in sharp critical perspective.20 Historical contexts, however, alert us to the possibility of approach ing Mozart's symphonic drama in a more detailed and informed fashion than hitherto. Stylistic features of several of Haydn's so-called Sturm und Drang symphonies, for example, closely parallel events and plot-related activities in plays performed in close temporal and physical proximity to the composition of the symphonies. The recognition among late 18th-century writers that symphonies can embody the 'theatre style' in addition to the church and chamber styles, also adds grist to the hermeneutic mill.21 Furthermore, Mozart's own piano concertos have a deep theoretical and practical affinity with con temporary operatic and spoken theatre, arguably rivalling?in the intensity of both dramatic process and of relations among 'characters'?the very best on offer on the late 18th-century stage.22 While specific references to the dramatic qualities of classical symphonies proliferate in the early 19th-century writings of Jean Paul, Ludwig Tieck and ET. A. Hoffmann, for example,23 they are also in evidence in late 18th-century symphonic criticism, as we shall see. In short, our critical understanding of a movement such as the 'Jupiter' finale will ben efit greatly from a systematic evaluation of its drama, carried out in light of historical 19 Webster, Haydn's 'Farewell' Symphony and the Idea of Classical Style: Through-Composition and Cyclic Integration in His Instrumental Music, Cambridge, 1991, p. 185. 20 Witness Charles Rosen's influential and otherwise insightful book The Classical Style. Rosen refers freely to drama and to dramatic processes?indeed they are central to his appreciation of this style?but without evaluating the significance of these concepts in historical terms. 21 On both of these points, see Elaine R. Sisman, 'Haydn's Theater Symphonies', Journal of the American Musicological Society, 43 (1990), pp. 292-352. 22 See Simon P. Keefe, Mozart's Piano Concertos: Dramatic Dialogue in the Age of Enlightenment, Woodbridge and Rochester, New York, 2001. 23 See Gr?ber, Mozart and Posterity, p. 79, and Bellamy Hosler, Changing Aesthetic Views of Instrumental Music in 18th Century Germany, Ann Arbor, 1981, pp. 190, 227.</page><page sequence="6">22 Simon P. Keefe considerations. Moreover, our investigation will be best served by focussing on the concept of dialogue?one frequently discussed by late 18th-century commentators on the symphony and neo-classical writers on drama (albeit not writers on opera)?since imitative and fugal counterpoint dominate Mozart's finale to a degree unprecedented in his orchestral works and both feature prominently in late 18th- and early 19th-century understandings of the concept24 (As will become clear, musical dialogue is not under stood as a synonym for counterpoint, in spite of characteristics that overlap with it, and possesses technically specific qualities.) After explaining the relevance of late 18th-century discussions of dramatic dialogue to our appreciation of classical symphonies, I shall probe the nature and structure of dramatic dialogue in the 'Jupiter' finale. This new historical perspective will, in turn, cast fresh light on the stylistic significance of this movement in Mozart's orchestral uvre. Dramatic Dialogue and the Late I8th-Century Symphony In 1785, three years before the composition of Mozart's 'Jupiter' Symphony, the promi nent French aesthetician Bernard Germain, Comte de Lac?p?de renders explicit the dramatic characteristics of the late 18th-century symphony. While Lac?p?de is unlikely to have written with Mozart's works uppermost in his mind, his admiration for purport edly 'progressive' late 18th-century German symphonists such as Franz Ignaz Beck and Johann Franz Xavier Sterkel reveals a cosmopolitan outlook on the genre, an outlook not limited to works by his French compatriots.25 The symphonic composer should be, in Lac?p?de's words: considering them [symphonies] as just three great acts in a play, to be thinking that he was working on a tragedy, or a comedy or a pastoral... The first piece, the one that we call the allegro of the symphony would present so to speak the overture and the first scenes; in the andante or second piece, the musician would place the depiction of the tremendous events, the fearful passions, or the agreeable objects which were to constitute the basic content of the piece; and the last piece, which we usually call the presto, would offer the last effects of these frightful or touching passions; the d?nouement would also show itself there, and 24 Late 18th-century theoretical discussion of the multi-faceted nature of dialogue in opera?literal and musical alike?is much less common than corresponding discussion of theatrical dialogue. In any case, late 18th-century symphonies (and chamber works), while no less immune than contemporary concertos to expressive and topical links with opera, are texturally dissimilar at a basic level to operatic numbers (equal-voice texture, paradigmatically, as opposed to soloist(s)/orchestra). As a result, parallels between the interaction of symphonic and operatic 'characters' do not form part of this study. 25 Lac?p?de recommends for study the concertos, symphonies and symphonies concertantes of Beck and Sterkel, alongside those by the French composers Jean-Baptiste Davaux, Jean-Baptiste-Aim? Janson and his teacher Fran?ois-Joseph Gossec. See Lac?p?de, 'Des symphonies, des concertos etc.', in La po?tique de la musique, Paris, 1785, 2 vols., vol. 2, p. 341. Lac?p?de, who moved to Paris in 1776, probably encountered Haydn's symphonies while writing his treatise, given Haydn's surge to symphonic prominence in the French capital in the early 1780s. On the latter point, see Bernard Harrison, Haydn: the 'Paris' Symphonies, Cambridge, 1998, especially pp. 5-25.</page><page sequence="7">The 'Jupiter' Symphony in C, K. 551 23 we would see following it the pain, terror and consternation that a fateful catastrophe inspires, or the joy, happiness and frenzy to which pleasant and happy events give rise.26 Although Lac?p?de's comments?indeed those of all French late 18th-century critics who write positively about instrumental music?must be regarded in part as a response to the prevailing French scepticism about the meaningfulness of instrumental music,27 his suggestion that the symphonic composer puts himself in the mindset of a playwright strikes a chord with Sulzer's earlier suggestion that the composer of a work should draw on quasi dramatic inspiration in orderto reach an appropriate emotional state: The best thing to do would be to imagine some event, situation, or state which highlights most naturally what he wishes to present.'28 But Lac?p?de goes further than other contem porary writers in bringing the issue of drama in the symphony into close relation with late 18th-century preoccupations about the genre in general, most importantly in the textural domain. Shortly after outlining the dramatic shape of the symphony, for example, Lac?p?de explains how individual segments of the drama might be formulated: In order to distinguish, as it were, between different interlocutors, we would choose the most prominent instruments in the orchestra, those whose nature best matched the characters we had imagined. We would use them to create a kind of dialogue accompanied by the rest of the orchestra; sometimes a single instrument would, as it were, speak, and we would have a kind of monologue; sometimes by joining together they would form a kind of scene with several characters; and when one needed to introduce choruses into the drama, the whole orchestra would play in a noisier and more emphatic way, representing a multitude adding its roars to the cries of passion of the most interesting characters.29 26 Lac?p?de, La po?tique de la musique, vol. 2, pp. 331 -32. 'Mais ensuite il faudrait qu'il ne les consid?r?t que comme trois grands actes d'une pi?ce de th??tre, qu'il cr?t travailler ? une trag?die, ? une com?die, ou ? une pastorale...' 'Le premier morceau, celui que l'on appelle lb//egro de la symphonie, en pr?senterait pour ainsi dire l'ouverture &amp; les premi?res sc?nes; dans fondante ou le second morceau, le musicien placerait la peinture des ?v?nemens terribles, des passions redoubtables, ou des objets agr?ables qui devraient faire le fonds de la pi?ce; &amp; le dernier morceau, auquel on donne commun?ment le nom de presto, offrirait les derniers efforts de ces passions affreuses ou touchantes; le d?nouement s'y montrerait aussi, &amp; l'on verrait ? sa suite la douleur, l'effroi &amp; la consternation qu'inspire une catastrophe funeste, ou la joie, le bonheur &amp; le d?lire que seraient na?tre des ?v?nemens agr?ables &amp; heureux'. 27 On fundamental trends in writings on French musical aesthetics from this period, see Maria Rika Maniates, '"Sonate, que me veux-tu?"

I, p. 273, given in Aesthetics and the Art of Musical Composition, p. 53. 29 Lac?p?de, La po?tique de la musique, vol. 2, pp. 332-33. 'Pour qu'on put en quelques sorte y distinguer diff?rens interlocuteurs, on choisirait dans l'orchestre les instrumens les plus saillans, et dont la nature conviendrait le mieux au caract?res qu'on aurait feints; on s'en servirait pour former des esp?ces de dialogues accompagn?s par tout le reste de l'orchestre; tant?t un seul instrument parlerait, pour ainsi dire, et l'on verrait une sorte de monologue; et tant?t en se r?unissant ils formeraient des esp?ces de sc?nes ? plusieurs personages; &amp; lorsqu'on aurait besoin d'introduire des ch urs dans le drame, tout l'orchestre jouant d'une mani?re plus bruyante &amp; plus marqu?e, repr?senterait une multitude qui joindrait ses clameurs aux cris des passions des personages les plus int?ressans'.</page><page sequence="8">24 Simon P. Keefe By describing dialogue among orchestral 'characters', Lac?p?de highlights one of the most popular metaphors for instrumental interaction in the symphony. In a similar fashion to Lac?p?de, Jean Fran?ois de Chastellux explains in 1765 that the works of German symphonists 'are a type of Concerto, in which the instruments shine in turn, in which they provoke each other and respond; they dispute and reconcile among themselves. It is a lively and sustained conversation.'30 Moreover, J.J. O. de Meude-Monpas?in praising the works of Gossec?cites dialogue as an illustration of 'the good way to write' (la bonne mani?re d'?crire) in the symphonic genre.31 In the context of theoretical writings on the late 18th-century symphony, references to dialogue often reflect prevalent critical assumptions that symphonies should aspire to textural equality among instrumental parts. Classical theorists citing connections between the string quartet and symphonic genres reinforce the primacy of participatory equality, since the quartet was widely acknowledged at the end of the 18th century as a metaphorical paradigm of intelligent conversation among equal interlocutors.32 Francesco Galeazzi states, for example, that the symphony is similar to the string quartet 'with the sole difference of a quite extensive interlacing that must emanate from the various parts.'33 In addition, a writer for the Allgemeine musikalische Zeitung in October 1800 finds Mozart's symphonies similar in tendency and spirit to his quartets, albeit richer and more energetic.34 Critical references to the prominent role of all instrumental parts in symphonies imply equality of participation even when not invoking dialogue. Johann Karl Friedrich Triest, writing in 1801, follows Lac?p?de in implicitly recognizing the move towards participatory equality in the symphony as dramatic. He explains that composers such as Haydn and Mozart 'took advantage of the more developed internal and external tonal mechanism to transform voices that had been mere accompaniments into more obbligato parts. This was done both in works for solo instruments... and in combinations of several instruments, for example in symphonies, quartets etc., where the intent was to achieve a result more or less the same as that produced by beautiful groups of figures... on 30 Chastellux, Essai sur l'union de la po?sie &amp; de la musique, Paris, 1765, pp. 49-50; as given in Mark Evan Bonds, The Symphony as Pindaric Ode', in Hoydn and His World, ed.

Mozart is the great master of instrumentation in this respect. In his symphonies... the controlled passing from one class of instruments to another has often struck me as a dramatic interplay of dialogue of the most varied kind.38 The finale of the 'Jupiter' is a particularly good example of the process Hegel describes.39 It illustrates in an effective fashion Mozart's 'controlled passing from one class of instru ments to another,' the fugal exposition in the strings (mm. 36-52), for example, leading to imitation between the first violin and cello (mm. 56-64), a stretto in the strings and winds (mm. 64-73), a contrapuntal combination of thematic material in the first violin and winds in the secondary theme (mm. 74-86) and a flute/bassoon imitation on the same motif as the earlier first violin/cello imitation (mm. 86-94).

Keefe reliance on fugal counterpoint, on standard fugal procedures such as stretto entries and on imitation (strict and informal), for example, ties his movement closely to contempo rary discussions of musical dialogue. For the late 18th-century fugue is often likened to dialogue among a group of people. In Johann Nikolaus Forkel's formulation (1788), the fugue constitutes statements and responses of a passionate nature: Let us imagine a people made emotional by the account of a great event, envisaging initially a single member of this group, perhaps through the intensity of his feelings, being driven to make a short powerful statement as the expression of his feelings. Will not this emotional outpouring gradually grip the collective members of this people and will he not be followed by first one, then several, then the majority, each singing the same song with him, modifying it according to his own way of feeling to be sure, but on the whole concording with him as to the basic feeling?40 Similarly, Georg Joseph Vogler draws attention in the 1790s to the conversational nature of fugue, in the process stressing an equality of participation also prescribed by writers on the symphony: 'the fugue is a conversation among a multitude of singers... a musical artwork where no one accompanies, no one submits, where nobody plays a secondary role, but each a principal part.'41 Musical imitation of a less formal nature also falls under the auspices of late 18th-century dialogue and constitutes the third of Antoine Reicha's four definitions of dialogue in his important codification of the concept in 1814.42 A case in point is the style dialogu?, a style characterized by the imitation of motivic material evenly distributed?in paradigmatic form?among individual instruments, again bringing to mind the equality of participation required in the symphony and the fugue.43 The specifically dramatic attributes of instrumental dialogue in Mozart's 'Jupiter' finale are best viewed through the lens of contemporary theoretical writings on dramatic dialogue. The most significant late 18th-century French writers on drama, for example, emphasize that brevity, liveliness and concision are essential qualities of successful dialogue. Cailhava (1786) advises the writer of comedy in unambiguous fashion: 'When the author is free to cut or not cut his dialogue, I exhort him not to hesitate. A shortened dialogue gives much more movement to the scene.'44 As a result, the writing for individual characters 40 Forkel, Allgemeine Geschichte der Musik, Leipzig, 1788, 1801, 2 vols., vol.

The art of giving it this quality consists not only in shortening it appropriately, in making it more or less rapid, according to circumstances: it also consists in not making a character speak when he has nothing to say.'46 Joseph de Laporte (1776) adopts a similar position to Cailhava. Explaining that 'the principles of dialogue' are the same for comedy as for tragedy, he argues that '[o]ne of the greatest perfections of dialogue is liveliness.'47 Like Denis Diderot, Cailhava and Louis S?bastien Mercier, Laporte is especially enamoured by dialogue in Pierre Corneille's plays, describing it as 'lively and sharp' (vif et coup?).48 In contrast, these writers find Racine's dialogues unsatisfactory, the considerable length of each statement rendering them 'less lively' (moins vives) in the theatre than on the page (Laporte) and indicating that Racine?unlike Corneille?does not understand the importance of 'liveliness' (vivacit?) in dialogue (Mercier).49 The idea?frequently articu lated in theoretical circles?that dramatic dialogues should be 'natural' also assumes the dialogic qualities prescribed by French classical writers. The influential Austrian intellectual Joseph von Sonnenfels, for example, identifies dialogue as a stumbling block for many 18th-century dramatists. Railing against long and meandering successions of verses that swell with emotion and become incomprehensible, Sonnenfels explains that dialogue should be natural, implicitly advocating clarity through concision.50 At the heart of insistences on brevity and concision in dramatic dialogue is the concept of rapidit?.51 Laporte demonstrates its relevance to dramatic dialogue in his comparison of Moli?re's dialogue to that of the less illustrious succeeding generation of playwrights. Dialogue in comedy 'must flow naturally. This is one of the great merits of Moli?re. We do not see, in any of his plays, a single example of an out-of-place reply. His successors multiplied the tirades, the portraits etc. Nothing is more contrary to the rapidit? of dialogue.'52 Friedrich Melchior (Baron von) Grimm, the eminent aesthetician who was 45 Cailhava, 'Du dialogue', p. 186.

Keefe Mozart's landlord during his stay in Paris in 1778, was an especially enthusiastic advocate of rapidit?. As he explains in an article in the monumental Encyclop?die, rapidit? is obliga tory in an opera, both as 'a quality inseparable from music and one of the principal causes of its marvellous effects' and as an essential component of a libretto in which 'long and extraneous dialogues are nowhere more out of place.'53 Mozart?having presumably discussed the concept with Grimm in Paris?amply demonstrates his own commitment to the concision characteristic of rapidit? in letters to his father from Munich in 1780-81 in which he fastidiously details cuts and shortenings in Idomeneo.54 Moreover, Mozart's plan in September 1778 to shorten his violin concertos?'In Germany we rather like length, but after all it is better to be short and good'?attests to the relevance of rapidit? to his orchestral music as well as his operas.55 The preference for concision, brevity and liveliness in late 18th-century writings on theatrical dialogue relates in part to the critical predilection for short and sharp dialogic confrontations between characters. While late 18th-century discussions of confronta tion in plays are directly relevant to the interaction of Mozart's soloist and orchestra in several piano concertos, they are less relevant to the finale of the 'Jupiter,' especially because the movement's voluminous fugal and imitative dialogues engender a spirit of instrumental equality and since the symphony in general lacks the concerto's opposition of soloist and orchestra.56 Nevertheless, musical dialogue in general, like its dramatic counterpart, benefits from concision, brevity and intensity even if not illustrating con frontation. J?r?me-Joseph de Momigny acknowledges these dialogic qualities?albeit not in the specific context of symphonic dialogue?in comparing a segment of the first movement of Mozart's String Quartet in D minor, K. 421 to the standard practice of a less experienced and less talented composer: A student would have put all these imitations of the same subject [i.e. mm. 53-8 in the development section] in the same part. Then we would no longer have heard anything but a kind of scale in place of this dialogue that is so compressed, so pressing, and so admirable.'57 propos.

As Laporte explains, dialogue in a play must fulfil a teleological function: It is desirable that the arrangement of the subject should be such that in each scene we set out from one point in order to arrive at another determined point... that the dialogue should only serve the development of the action. Each step would be a new step towards the denouement, a new link in the plot; in a word a means of weaving or developing, of preparing a situation, or of moving to a new situation.58 In a similar vein, Hegel's 'dramatic interplay of dialogue' in Mozart's symphonies, while not necessarily understanding dialogue in specific technical terms (imitation etc.), nonethe less highlights its directional quality. Immediately after the passage quoted above, Hegel clarifies how Mozart's symphonic dialogue can enact a goal-orientated process: In one aspect of this [the dramatic interplay of dialogue in Mozart's symphonies], the character of one variety of instruments is developed musically to the point where it anticipates and prepares the way for the character of another; or, approaching it from another side, the impression is that one kind of instrument is replying to another or is introducing something which could not have been adequately expressed by the sound of the preceding instrument; so that what arises out of all of this is a truly captivating colloquy, made up of sounds, with beginnings, progressions, and completions.59 It is reasonable to suggest that a symphonic movement such as the 'Jupiter' finale will need to embrace a philosophy analogous in musical terms to the ideas described above if it is to justify a 'dramatic' epithet in line with neo-classical thought. In any case musi cal dialogue (instrumental alone, and instrumental and textual combined) in Le nozze di Figaro (1786) and Don Giovanni (1787)?Mozart's two great operas preceding the 'Jupiter'?demonstrates the close relationship between theoretical positions outlined above and Mozart's dramatic practice, confirming the pursuit of musical-dramatic cor respondences in Mozart's symphonic repertory as a legitimate hermeneutic exercise. Numbers such as the Act 2 trio, Act 3 sextet, 'Letter duet' ('Che soave zeffiretto') and aria 'Deh vieni' from Figaro, and 'La ci darem', 'Batti, batti' and the Act 2 trio from Don Giovanni present succinct, concise and systematic dialogue supporting in practical terms Mozart's theoretical subscription to the idea of rapidit?.60 In many instances, moreover, 58 Laporte, Dictionnaire dramatique, vol. I, p. 394. 'Il serait ? souhaiter que la disposition du sujet f?t telle, qu'? chaque sc?ne on parte d'un point pour arriver ? un point d?termin?... que le Dialogue ne d?t servir qu'aux progress de l'action.

Keefe the accumulation of dialogue and resulting teleology across a number fulfils a function similar to that argued for theatrical dialogue by Laporte. Such musical processes often support a development in the operatic plot?progressively succinct and intricate dia logue among Don Giovanni, Zerlina and the accompanying orchestra in 'La ci darem' represents Don Giovanni's seduction, and among the Count, Countess and Susanna in the Act 2 trio from Figaro the shared belief at the end of the number that scandal must be avoided?and/or correspond to standard practices in late 18th-century opera buffa such as the uniting of interlocutors in the concluding stages of a dialogued duet and the typical progressions from dialogue to tutti sections in finales.61 Dramatic Dialogue in the 'Jupiter' Finale The virtues of dialogic conciseness and equality of participation articulated by dramatic theorists and music theorists are more in evidence in the finale of Mozart's 'Jupiter' Symphony than in any of his preceding symphonic movements. This is due in part at least to Mozart's almost exclusive reliance on imitative dialogue. In a definition of dialogue from 1814 that is significant in historical terms for its synthesis of relatively informal theoretical understandings of the concept from the 18th century, Antoine Reicha outlines only four possible manifestations of musical dialogue: 'first by executing the full periods alternately; second by distributing the phrases (or members of the periods) among the different voices that are to execute the melody; third by motives [dess/'ns], that is to say, by little imitations; fourth by starting a phrase with one voice and finishing it with another.'62 Since Reicha's first, second, and fourth types of dialogue imply less frequent exchange from one instrument or voice to another than the third, they would be ostensibly less likely to reveal the qualities of brevity, concision and vivacity cited by dramatic theorists. More important, Mozart's imitations in the 'Jupiter' finale are terse and brisk?in the exposition, for example, strettos, rapid combinations of motifs, imitations at a distance of one measure, and succinct fugal entries. (For a representation of dialogue in the entire finale, see Figure I.) Moreover, the active participation of all instrumental parts in the finale?a laudable stylistic trait in Mozart's music as recognized by his contemporaries?is immediately obvious. Although the initial two dialogues in both the exposition and recapitulation are carried out by the strings, wind instruments are equally as involved as their string counterparts in subsequent exchanges. 61 On 'La ci darem' and the Act 2 trio from Figaro, see Keefe, Mozart's Piano Concertos, pp. 116-17. The dialogued duet is discussed in Elisabeth Cook, Duet and Ensemble in the Early Op?ra Comique, London, 1995, especially pp. 228-45, and its relevance to 18th- and early 19th-century technical understandings of dialogue explained in Keefe, Mozart's Piano Concertos, pp. 30-32 and Keefe, 'Reicha's Dialogue', pp. 50 52.

The exposition, for example, features a rudimentary dialogic 'balance,' while also reveal ing a marked increase in dialogic intensity from beginning to end. The midpoint of the exposition?the presentation of the second theme at mm. 74-86 in a section of 157 measures?is both preceded and followed by an immediate succession of one-measure imitations (theme 3) and strettos; in addition, the first instance of dialogue in the exposi tion, which involves only strings, is balanced by the final one, which features only winds. From a teleological perspective, however, Mozart progresses towards greater dialogic complexity in the second half of the section. After the second theme, the one-measure imitations of theme 3 are combined not with straightforward repeated eighth-notes (as in mm. 56-64) but with sequentially descending eighth-notes in the violins that derive ultimately from the sequentially descending eighth-notes in themes 2 and 4; the stretto in mm, 98-110 is a four-entry stretto, taken through two further sequential repeats, as opposed to a three-entry stretto repeated only once (as in mm. 64-73); and the stretto on theme 2 in mm. 135-45 also intensifies the earlier stretto on the same theme by featuring two sequential repeats and by combining both the theme and its inversion.63 63 The fact that the exposition and the development/recapitulation sections are marked for repeat in K. 551/iv does not detract from the dramatic import of Mozart's movement. Since late 18th-century theorists of drama cited above?as well as other influential writers such as Lessing, Diderot and Goethe?extol the virtues of systematic, logical and clear dramatic procedures while denigrating stereotypically 'dramatic' qualities of surprise and suspense, the repetition of specific dialogic patterns and processes in Mozart's movement will not in itself challenge their status as dramatic.</page><page sequence="18">34 Simon P. Keefe Like the exposition, the development section demonstrates forward momentum in dialogic terms. While two distinct procedures occur in the first half of the sec tion?themes I and 2 are alternated in mm. 158-72 and theme 2 heard in stretto in mm. 172-86?these two procedures are directly juxtaposed in the ensuing passage (mm. 186-207). In line with Reicha's writings on dialogue, the opposition of themes I and 2 in mm. 158-72 and 186-207 imply the type of dialogic confrontation between strings and wind protagonists (especially in the later passage where opposing dynamics, rhythms, note values etc. accentuate the contrast between alternated material) that is witnessed between the soloist and the orchestra in the development sections of several of Mozart's piano concerto first movements.64 Any remnants of confrontation between the strings (theme I) and the winds (theme 2) are cancelled out decisively, however, in the con cluding measures of the section (mm. 2l9ff); the dotted rhythm beginning theme 2 is passed from the bassoons (mm. 219-20), to the horn (m. 221) and finally to the first violin (m. 222) which states theme 2 in its entirety to merge a statement of theme 2 (the end of the development) mellifluously into the reprise of theme I (the beginning of the recapitulation) and thus to negate the opposition of the two themes. The crowning glory of dialogic procedures initiated in the 'Jupiter' Finale's exposition and development sections comes in the recapitulation, where Mozart intensifies his goal orientated processes. Alterations and additions to dialogue from the exposition provide the means to this end. For example, the first and last dialogic passages in the section as a whole?the stretto on I in the secondary development (mm. 241-52) and the double fugue and five-part invertible counterpoint in the coda (mm. 372-402)?are both new to the movement and stretch the extremities of the recapitulation's teleological process beyond the corresponding extremities of the exposition; Mozart now progresses from entries of theme I in the terse secondary development that are concealed by the continu ous whole-note movement in the violins (mm. 241-52) to the overt contrapuntal zenith of the coda where each of the five principal motifs is simultaneously dialogued from one instrumental part to another in four-bar units (in mm. 372-91, for example, theme 2 from viola - 2nd violin - 1st violin - bass - cello and theme I from the cello - viola - 2nd violin - 1st violin - bass). The interpolation of dotted rhythms in the flutes, oboes, trumpets and timpani (mm. 332-33) after the climactic sequential rise of mm. 328-32 (itself a re-composed version of the exposition) pre-empts the dotted rhythms prevalent in the ensuing stretto on theme 2, thus intensifying this juncture of the recapitulation in relation to the corresponding passage in the exposition (mm. I30ff.) by creating a direct dialogic link between material not linked in the exposition. The re-orchestrated version of the second theme in the recapitulation is also of significance to the section's 64 On Reicha's explanation of confrontational dialogue, see Keefe, Mozart's Piano Concertos, pp. 32-34 and Keefe, 'Reicha's Dialogue', pp. 52-54.</page><page sequence="19">The 'Jupiter' Symphony in C, K. 551 35 teleological focus. While the repeated statement of the second theme in the exposition features identical scoring to the initial statement (see mm. 74-86), the repeat of the second theme in the recapitulation re-scores the wind presentations of themes 5, 3 and 2 so as to illustrate the contrapuntal invertibility of the themes (see mm. 272-84) and thus to foreshadow the invertible counterpoint of the coda. As well as intensifying the teleological structure of the recapitulation and coda, added dialogue in this section also retains (in re-shaped form) the interactional 'balance' of the exposition. The first and last dialogues from the recapitulation again square exclu sive string participation (in the former) with exclusive wind involvement (in the latter). Equilibrium is further reinforced in the thematic domain by the stretto on theme I in original and inverted forms at the beginning of the coda (mm. 360-71). The only other sustained passage of theme I semibreve writing in more than one part is the second ary development passage. As a result, there is an even stronger affinity between the beginning and end of the final section than between the corresponding junctures of the exposition. Moreover, the presence of a pseudo inversion of theme I in the cello in the secondary development passage (mm. 243-50)?the only such occurrence before the coda?foreshadows the more overt manifestations of the inverted theme I in the later passage (mm. 360-67). Irrespective of whether we regard the entire recapitulation and coda, or the coda by itself, as the denouement of Mozart's 'Jupiter' finale, we will acknowledge the dramatic intensity of the movement's dialogic procedures. Just as Joseph Laporte argues that each reply in theatrical dialogue 'would be a new step towards the denouement... in a word a means of weaving or developing, of preparing a situation, or of passing to a new situ ation,' so the nature, organization and structure of Mozart's dialogues in the exposition and development pave the way for the recapitulation and coda. Moreover, by preparing the listener so thoroughly in the exposition and development sections for the forceful drive, terse structure and intricate technique of the recapitulation and coda, Mozart writes individual dialogues that are, at one and the same time, inherently striking in themselves and powerfully directed towards even greater fulfilment. Goethe makes this very point in explaining what a theatrical piece requires in order to be fit for the stage: 'each incident must be significant in itself, and lead to another still more important. The Tartuffe of Moli?re is, in this respect, a great example. Only think what an introduction is the first scene! From the beginning everything is highly significant, and leads us to expect something still more important.'65 Indeed, Mozart's initial dialogue 'scenes'?the fugal exposition, protracted imitation and stretto in quick succession in the transition, for example?are striking as they stand, but quickly precipitate an even more remark 65 Goethe, Conversations with Eckermann (1823-32), trans. John Oxenford, San Francisco, 1984, p. 105.</page><page sequence="20">36 Simon P. Keefe able chain of events - a goal-directed dialogic process in the exposition, an exposition and development that come to a climax in procedural terms in the recapitulation, and a recapitulation that itself culminates in the glorious dialogue of the coda. The pre-eminent dramatic theorists of the Enlightenment often remark upon the importance of plays propelling themselves forward from beginning to end in a manner akin to the forward propulsion witnessed in the 'Jupiter' finale. Denis Diderot outlines in unambiguous fashion the kind of procedural rigour and dramatic impetus that must be incorporated into a play: 'It [the incident beginning the action] will naturally lead to the second, the second scene to the third, and the act will be filled out. The important point is for the action to gather momentum and to be very clear.'66 Goethe, in contrast ing the role of the principal character in a novel and in a drama, argues a similar point: 'The novel must go slowly forward; and the sentiments of the hero, by some means or another, must restrain the tendency of the whole to unfold itself and to conclude. The drama, on the other hand, must hasten, and the character of the hero must press forward to the end.'67 These pronouncements are exemplified by dialogue in Mozart's 'Jupiter' finale. What is more, the consistency and clarity of dramatic procedure stipulated by late 18th-century dramatic theorists is realized at several levels in Mozart's movement. The 'tone' of the dialogue?brisk imitation?is consistent throughout; and the make-up and structure of individual dialogues points relentlessly forward, as we have seen. Even the interactional balance identified in the separate sections extends in a general way to the structure of the movement as a whole. Just as Mozart opens his finale in galant style with orchestral tuttis and an absence of imitation and follows this with a fugal exposition, so he closes his movement with the reverse - a double fugue and five-part invertible counterpoint (mm. 372-402) followed by a galant tutti.68 In addition, the middle sec tion?the development?adds to the rudimentary sense of symmetry by dividing into two approximately equal segments, the first looking back primarily to procedures in the exposition and the second looking forward above all to the recapitulation and coda. By including a stretto on theme 2 that is treated sequentially and that features the entire orchestra, the first half (mm. 158-86) invokes mm. 64-73 and, in particular, mm. 135-45 from the preceding exposition; in contrast, the second half (mm. 186-224), with both its abrasive sequence (186-206) and its smooth integration of distinct themes (222ff), foreshadows the harsh sequences of the secondary development and the fluidic thematic exchange of the coda respectively. 66 As quoted in M. J. Sidnell, ed. and trans., Sources of Dramatic Theory: 2.

While every string and wind part in mm. 388-402 presents one of the five principal themes of the movement creating elaborate five-part invertible counterpoint and a rich tapestry of imitative dialogue, the horns and trumpets are conspicuously absent from this process. To be sure, late 18th-century horn and trumpet instruments would have been physically incapable of playing the unadulterated versions of themes 2-5 offered by the strings and winds, but had he so desired Mozart could certainly have made their material more closely related to the melodic and rhythmic elements of these themes.70 As it stands, the material of the horns and trumpets could be heard either as pan-motivic or as non-motivic. We could argue, for example, that the dotted quarter-note - eighth note - half-note rhythm in mm. 3883-892 derives from the opening of theme 2, that the subsequent three half-notes (3893-90) originate in the opening of theme 4, and that the four quarter-notes in m. 391 loosely invert theme 5; we might maintain with equal justification, however, that the trumpets and horns offer ostensibly 'new' material, to all intents and purposes unrelated to the principal thematic argument of the movement Irrespective of how we channel our interpretation, we will acknowledge that the horns and trumpets stand clear of the dialogic melee all around (even though they unambigu ously partake in dialogic activity earlier in the movement), and that?even accounting for the limited nature of late 18th-century brass instruments?the straightforward sim plicity of their lines contrasts sharply with material presented by every other orchestral instrument (timpani excluded).71 69 Sisman, Jupiter' Symphony, pp. 19-20, 79. 70 Witness, for example, the statement of theme I in the horns earlier in the coda (mm. 372-75). The brass, moreover, play a direct role in the presentation of motivic material earlier in the finale. In the development, for example, the horns and trumpets participate in a rigorously motivic fashion throughout the section, repeatedly contributing the opening of theme 2 to successions of stretto entries in the strings/winds (mm. 172-86) and strings (mm. 186-202). While the same cannot be said for the entire exposition and recapitulation sections, the horns and trumpets frequently play prominent roles in motivic presentations. (See Figure I) 71 Overt contrast between brass and wind/strings involvement is, of course, evident elsewhere in the finale (e.g. mm. 136-45 from the exposition). Such contrasts between material presented by the brass and the winds/strings are less marked earlier in the movement, however, since the winds' and strings' counterpoint is less intricate than corresponding counterpoint in the coda.</page><page sequence="22">38 Simon P. Keefe Due recognition that the brass steer clear of the contrapuntal fray in mm. 388-402 necessarily entails a re-evaluation of the function of Mozart's coda. It is significant, for example, that the horns and trumpets perform a straightforward march; the military and ceremonial qualities so often associated with this topic, together with the characteristic participation of the brass, lend it an air of authority72 Just as 18th-century aestheticians regard the march as 'a primitive specimen from which to trace the evolution of compara tive artifices like the social dances,'73 so Mozart's 'primitive' march in the brass provides a foundation for demarcating the contrapuntal intricacies of the strings and winds. The triumphant appearance of a brass march in the finale's climactic passage, moreover, is an entirely appropriate conclusion to a movement highlighting the ceremonial and trumpet ing qualities of the 18th-century Viennese trumpet symphony tradition.74 By offsetting the spiral of contrapuntal complexity with a simple and comprehensible musical reference point at the very moment that the counterpoint would have seemed most likely to run away with itself (i.e. in m. 388, the first simultaneous participation of every string and woodwind instrument in five-part invertible counterpoint), Mozart shields his listener from the overwhelming sight of contrapuntal infinity. Instead, he encourages his listener to contemplate the forceful rigour and intelligibility of his dramatic process, providing a fitting illustration of the extraordinary type of instrumental music that will, according to Adam Smith in 1795, 'occupy, and as it were fill up completely the whole capacity of the mind, so as to leave no part of its attention vacant for thinking of anything else.'75 The Stylistic Significance of the Jupiter' Finale in Mozart's uvre The dramatic and stylistic ingenuity of the finale of Mozart's 'Jupiter' Symphony must not obscure the fact that, adopting Reicha's four-fold technical definition of dialogue quoted above, the emphasis on teleological and symmetrical structuring of dialogue, on equality of participation in dialogue and on the forceful rigor of dialogic procedures is foreshadowed in Mozart's earlier Viennese symphonies (No. 35 in D, 'Haffner', K. 385; No. 36 in C, 'Linz', K. 425; No. 38 in D, 'Prague', K. 504; No. 39 in Eb, K. 543; and No. 40 in G minor, K. 550). Dialogic rigor in the dramatic domain also characterizes arias and ensembles from Mozart's earlier Viennese operas, as mentioned above; however, the 72 For accounts of typical musical qualities of the march topic, see Wye Jamison Allanbrook, Rhythmic Gesture in Mozart: Le nozze di Figaro and Don Giovanni, Chicago, 1983, pp. 45-48 and V.

Peter Brown, 'The Trumpet Overture and Sinfon?a in Vienna (1715-1822): Rise, Decline and Reformulation', in Music in Eighteenth-Century Austria, ed. David Wyn Jones, Cambridge, 1996, pp. 13-69. Brown argues that Mozart drew upon the trumpet symphony tradition only in his Viennese works, including the first and last movements of the 'Jupiter'. In the finale, the fanfare-like quality of theme 2 represents 'an effort to recapture the effect of multi-choired groups of trumpets responding to proclamations', (p. 65) 75 Adam Smith, 'Ofthe Nature ofthat Imitation which takes place in what are called the Imitative Arts', (1795) in Essays on Philosophical Subjects, ed.

Bryce, Oxford, 1980, p. 205.</page><page sequence="23">The 'Jupiter' Symphony in C, K. 551 39 fundamental textural discrepancy between the 'Jupiter' finale and these operatic num bers, and the late 18th-century theoretical association of vocal/instrumental interaction in opera with instrumental interaction in the concerto (not the symphony), renders specific dialogic connections between K. 551 and Mozart's operas less historically significant than dialogic connections between K. 551 and Mozart's earlier Viennese symphonies.76 In the first movement of the 'Linz' (1783), for example, the coda fulfils a function similar to the coda of the 'Jupiter' finale, acting as the defining moment in a dialogic process that stretches across the movement. Towards the end of each of the principal sections of K. 425/i Mozart highlights dialogue in one- and two-measure imitative units (see mm. 8 17 [slow introduction], 105-10 [exposition], 158-61 [development], 251-55 [recapitula tion]), taking this procedure further in the coda. Here, Mozart revisits the beginning of the development section (as is not uncommon in his sonata form codas in general77), featuring strings-wind dialogue similarto that of mm. 131-39, while rendering the dialogue itself more succinct and procedurally significant. Mm. 274-80 alternate one-measure units in the strings and winds: the use of one-measure imitation to bring individual sections to a close now extends to the close of the entire movement. In addition, mm. 274-78 combine one-measure alternations with a split-theme dialogue (winds - strings; winds - strings), thus concisely integrating at the end of the movement the principle dialogic trait of imitation with the secondary trait of thematic dialogue split between wind and strings (see exposition, mm. 75-79; recapitulation, mm. 221-25). The finale of the 'Prague' Symphony (1786) goes one step further than the first move ment of the 'Linz' by predicting both the concise teleological design and rudimentary symmetrical organization of dialogue in the 'Jupiter' finale. For example, the midpoint of the 151-measure exposition?the presentation of the secondary theme in mm. 66-98 ?provides the single most balanced dialogue of the section, a repeated theme (66-81; 82-98) whose participation is split between the strings and the winds. In turn, this pas sage is framed at the beginning and end of the section by alternating presentations of the movement's principal thematic material in the strings and wind (see mm. 1-30, 31-46, 47-63 and 110-20, 120-38, 138-51). Interactional symmetry between these fram ing passages is reinforced, moreover, by the presence of tutti, forte material (mm. 47-63, 110-20) immediately before and immediately after the secondary theme. Mozart retains his broad symmetrical arrangement in the recapitulation, but also renders his dialogue 76 On systematic dialogic procedures in numbers such as 'Martern aller Arten' and the Act 2 Quartet from Entf?hrung, the Act 2 Trio, Act 2 Finale, Act 3 Sextet, 'Letter Duet' and 'Den vieni' from Figaro, and 'L? ci darem', 'Batti, batti', the Act I Finale, Act 2 Trio and Act 2 Finale of Don Giovanni as they compare to corresponding procedures in Mozart's Viennese piano concertos, see Keefe, Mozart's Piano Concertos, pp. 101-46. Correspondences between the organization of dialogue in the 'Jupiter' finale and in one concerto movement, K. 491/i, are discussed below. 77 See Esther Cavett-Dunsby, 'Mozart's Codas', Music Analysis, 7/1 (1988), p. 47.</page><page sequence="24">40 Simon P. Keefe more concise by shortening considerably the initial, pre-secondary-theme exchange. In addition to cutting the strings' opening presentation of the principal thematic material from 30 measures to 8 (mm. 216-23), Mozart re-introduces full-orchestral forte minims (tremolo in the violins) into the subsequent wind presentation (see mm. 228-31, 236-39) that correspond closely to full-orchestral forte passages interrupting very similar wind presentations at the beginning of the development (see mm. I56ff). By compressing his initial strings-wind-strings exchange, by connecting it to a passage from the develop ment section, and by predicting the forte outcry of m. 244 with the interpolation of the preceding forte interruptions, Mozart, in the recapitulation of K. 504/iv, not only follows those late 18th-century dramatic theorists who advise cutting dialogue at every possible opportunity?'When the author is free to cut or not cut his dialogue I exhort him hardly to hesitate'?but also realizes in practical terms the theoretical maxim that a 'shortened dialogue gives much more movement to the scene,' by accentuating the fluid continuity and goal-orientated nature of his dialogic process.78 While other movements from Mozart's Viennese symphonies foreshadow dialogue in the 'Jupiter' finale less directly than K. 425/i and K. 504/iv, they often prefigure in a general way K. 551/iv's drive towards the coda by progressively striving for dialogic equality between strings and winds. In K. 550/i, for example, the dialogic balance in the two exquisite pre sentations of the secondary theme (mm. 44-57)?the initial statement is passed from strings to winds to strings and the repeat from winds to strings to winds?precipitates greater equality in the presentation of the principal thematic material in the remainder of the movement than witnessed hitherto. The end of the exposition twice features state ments of the head motif passed from wind to strings (mm. 73-80, 81-88); the end of the development includes protracted strings-wind imitation of the head motif (mm. 139-52) and a graceful segue into the recapitulation as sequentially descending dialogue in the winds finally embraces the beginning of the 1st violin's restatement of the main theme (mm. 160-66); and the coda highlights a succession of imitative entries on the head motif in the strings and winds (mm. 286-93). During its exposition section, K. 543/iv progres sively increases the involvement of the winds in dialogue. While the strings dominate the presentation of the main theme and quickly intervene when the wind attempt to treat the secondary theme as a split-theme dialogue (see mm. 43-4 and 49-50), the winds subsequently present the head motif of the main theme first in imitation between flute and bassoon (mm. 55-61) and then among the flute, clarinet and bassoon (mm. 80-85), whereupon the strings finally take notice as it were of the winds and continue to dialogue the head motif themselves (mm. 86-95). Confident about asserting their rights as full 78 For the quoted material on dramatic dialogue see Cailhava, De l'art de la com?die, vol. I, p. 181.

Ultimately, the 'Jupiter' finale, although foreshadowed by earlier movements in Mozart's symphonic canon, transcends its predecessors in dialogic intensity and ingenuity. The 'Jupiter' coda is a more powerful and concentrated dramatic climax to its finale than the K. 425 coda is to its first movement; and the 'Jupiter' finale in its entirety demonstrates far greaterteleological thrust than, say, K. 504/iv, 550/i and 543/iv. In short, the cumulative dramatic process succinctly described by John Gregory in 1766 as 'artful construction, in which one part gives strength to another, and gradually works the Mind up to those sentiments and passions, which it was the design of the author to produce'79 is nowhere more evident in Mozart's symphonic uvre than in the 'Jupiter' finale. The movement in Mozart's orchestral repertory to which K. 551/iv is most closely akin is not from a symphony, rather from a piano concerto -the first movement of the C minor concerto, K. 491 (I786).80 Like K. 551/iv, K. 491/i organizes dialogues in a rudimentarily symmetrical fashion, especially in the solo exposition, where three-way exchanges among the winds, strings and piano at the beginning and end of the section (mm. 118-30, 241-55) frame two-way, piano-winds and winds-piano exchanges in the middle (see mm. 147-64 and 200-220). Similarly, K. 491/i introduces a forceful dialogic opposition of interlocutors (piano and orchestra) into the second half of the development section (mm. 330-45), as does K. 551/iv (strings/brass and winds, mm. 186-207). Above all, the recapitulation of K. 491/i provides a dialogic tour de force rivalling that of the corresponding section of K. 551/iv: both manipulate and intensify dialogic procedures and organizations from the exposition (orchestral and solo expositions in the case of K. 491) to effect decisive climaxes to the interaction in the two movements. Moreover, just as the 'Jupiter' finale intensifies dialogic procedures from Mozart's preceding Viennese symphonies, so K. 491/i intensifies the standard pattern of dialogic interaction from the first movements of Mozart's earlier Viennese piano concertos (K. 413-488), rendering his intimate dialogue (exposition) - conflict (development) - intimate dialogue (recapitulation) paradigm more taut and compelling than ever before. In contrast to K. 491, K. 551 is, of course, Mozart's final essay in its genre. While predict ing what Mozart might have done in the symphonic medium had he lived beyond 1791 79 Gregory, A Comparative View of the State and Faculties of Man, with those of the Animal World, London, 1766 (2nd edition), pp. 116-17. 80 Discussion of K. 49 l/i in this paragraph is drawn from Simon P. Keefe, The Stylistic Significance of the First Movement of Mozart's Piano Concerto No. 24 in C Minor, K. 491: A Dialogic Apotheosis', Journal of Musicological Research, 18/3 (1999), pp. 225-61, and Keefe, Mozart's Piano Concertos, pp. 75-100.</page><page sequence="26">42 Simon P. Keefe is dangerously speculative, we might very tentatively propose?given K. 491/i's status in relation to the three remaining piano concertos?that he would have engaged in acts of stylistic re-invention in the symphony similar to those undertaken in the final three piano concertos. In the first movements of K. 503, 537 and 595 patterns of dialogue and relational development from the preceding Viennese piano concertos (K. 413-491) are set aside in favour of new designs; Mozart presumably felt that he had exhausted his relational paradigm from 1782-86 with his almighty effort in K. 491/i.81 Since dialogic equality and teleology of dialogic design are such pronounced features of the 'Jupiter' finale, it is difficult to see how Mozart could have continued towards greater participa tory equality and more intense goal-orientated structure in a subsequent symphony, even had he so desired. A perspective on dramatic dialogue in the finale of the 'Jupiter' Symphony, although incapable of legitimising stylistic predictions, sheds light on the movement's relationship to one strand of late 18th-century thought. While frequent analogies in the secondary literature between Mozart's use of counterpoint and the invocation of social equality sometimes seem trite?Nicholas Till's statement that 'counterpoint becomes analogous to the interrelationship of free and equal individuals in society' is a case in point82?it would appear that one of Mozart's most compelling manifestations of contrapuntal ingenuity in his entire uvre is, in fact, fundamentally positive in outlook, endorsing Adam Smith's claim in 1795 that music 'can best imitate... those [sentiments and pas sions] which unite and bind men in society such as 'the social, the decent, the virtuous, the interesting and affecting... the noble, elevating and commanding passions'.83 The metaphorical representation of equality that emerges from the 'Jupiter' finale could be regarded as both a realistic and a pragmatic one. Reflecting a common theme among 18th-century intellectuals, the prominent Enlightenment philosopher Christoph Wieland, whose work was known to Mozart, argues for equality in the eyes of the law rather than 'absolute equality, which overthrows all distinctions in civil society between classes and estates, between rich and poor, educated and raw';84 similarly Mozart steps back from advocating complete and unrestrained contrapuntal equality with the introduction of his strident brass march in m. 388 of the coda, the precise moment at which the contrapuntal 81 See Keefe, 'Dialogic Apotheosis', pp. 248-55, and Mozart's Piano Concertos, pp. 94-100. 82 Till, Mozart and the Enlightenment: Truth, Beauty and Virtue in Mozart's Operas, New York, 1992, p. 176. 83 See Smith, Essays, p. 192. From a different perspective Rose Rosengard Subotnik argues that sensuous and illogical elements in Mozart's last three symphonies represent 'an incipient philosophical outlook' that compromises reason and rationality, limiting her investigation to harmonic and tonal procedures. See Subotnik, Developing Variations, pp. 98-111. An emphasis on the continuity of Mozart's thought in regard to dialogic procedures in his Viennese symphonies (No. 35-41) would counter Subotnik's claim. In any case, Subotnik offers no explanation as to why Mozart's 'philosophical outlook' would have changed in 1788. 84 As given in Till, Mozart and the Enlightenment, p. 146. Mozart owned copies ofWieland's Die Dialoge des Diogenes von Sinope, Leipzig, 1770, and Oberon: ein Gedicht, Reutlingen, 1781 ; see Otto Erich Deutsch, Mozart A Documentary Biography, trans. Eric Blom, Peter Branscombe and Jeremy Noble, Stanford, 1965, p. 602.</page><page sequence="27">The 'Jupiter Symphony in C, K. 551 43 involvement of the entire woodwind section without the intervention of the brass would have pointed in this direction. Just as at the end of the quintessential^ enlightened Le nozze di Figaro (1786), social divisions and hierarchies are ultimately maintained (in spite of being severely put to the test), so in the 'Jupiter' coda Mozart affirms, even rejoices in, the distinctions between his groups of instruments (winds/strings and brass), keeping these groups musically separate at this important concluding stage of the movement. Irrespective of where precisely Mozart's 'Jupiter' finale stands in relation to late 18th century social values, it encapsulates the spirit of neo-classical dramatic criticism. To be sure, the finale could have had considerable personal significance to Mozart, possibly reflecting?according to Neal Zaslaw?a combination of religious concerns, homage to Leopold, and a desire to escape past oppression.85 The personal dimension in Mozart's finale is further reinforced by the air of self-consciousness pervading musical processes, especially the contrapuntal combination of themes in the coda.86 But neither feature detracts from the movement's dramatic import. In fact, since the late 18th-century theatre is 'by nature a model of human self-consciousness,'87 and since one of the most ostensibly 'dramatic' passages in all of Mozart's operas, the Act 2 Finale of Don Giovanni, is certainly self-conscious?in particular the extended quotation of 'Non pi? Andrai' from Figaro to which Leporello adds 'Questa poi la conosco purtroppo!' ('I know that tune only too well!')?an element of self-consciousness might even enhance the dramatic significance of the movement. In any case, the 'Jupiter' finale simultaneously represents a supreme model of dramatic endeavour in the late 18th-century orchestral repertory and a movement sui generis in the intricacy and intensity of its dramatic dialogue. 85 See Zaslaw, Mozart's Symphonies, pp. 541-44. 86 Simon Sechter's remark in 1843 that the 'five themes that combine contrapuntally in the final section must unquestionably have been worked together in counterpoint right from the start' recognizes a degree of self-consciousness on Mozart's part. Sechter's statement is quoted in Sisman, Jupiter, p. 24. Recently Daniel Chua described the coda as 'the contrapuntal apotheosis that ingeniously intertwines the disparate fragments into a single texture... a self-reflexive move that reveals the chemical make up of the movement; the music comes into contrapuntal self-consciousness; it suddenly knows itself as the intellectual force that activates the structure of the work', in 'Haydn as Romantic: a Chemical Experiment with Instrumental Music', Haydn Studies, ed. W. Dean Sutcliffe, Cambridge, 1998, p. 138. 87 See Benjamin Bennett, Modern Drama and German Classicism: Renaissance from Lessing to Brecht, Ithaca, 1979, p. 94. Bennett refers on numerous occasions to the self-conscious nature of drama; see, for example, Modern Drama, pp. 54-5, 56, 94.</page></plain_text>
