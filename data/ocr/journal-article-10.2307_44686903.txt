Copyright © 2000 Society of Automotive Engineers, Inc. ABSTRACT In this paper a detailed analysis of a staged two-vehicle impact is conducted. The staged impact consisted of two moving vehicles impacting in a left front corner-to-right front corner configuration. Both vehicles were outfitted with an array of triaxial accelerometers. An Anthropo- morphic Test Device (ATD) was located in the driver posi- tion in one of the test vehicles. High-speed film cameras were installed on the vehicle, documenting the test dummy motion during the impact. The impact and sub- sequent vehicle motions were documented with offboard real-time video and high-speed film cameras. The accel- erometer data from both vehicles are analyzed. This analysis demonstrates the effects of yaw motion on the determination of Delta-V and on occupant kinematics. The notion of a Principal Direction of Force (PDOF) in a yawing vehicle is also discussed. Common analytical accident reconstruction methods are applied to the post- impact information (rest positions, residual crush profiles, etc.) in an attempt to recreate the initial impact configura- tion. Popular accident simulation programs are also employed for the same purpose. The appropriateness and limitations of these methods are examined. INTRODUCTION Many thousands of full-scale automobile crash tests have been conducted for various purposes over the years. Most of the tests available to accident reconstructionists have been conducted under the auspices of the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) for vehi- cle safety compliance purposes. The protocols for these tests call for either a moving vehicle striking a fixed bar- rier, or a moving barrier striking a stationary vehicle. While these tests are very informative and quite useful, they do not provide insightful information for many of the impact modes observed in real-world accidents. For instance, many vehicle-to-vehicle real-world accidents occur with both of the vehicles in motion. There are very few resources publicly available in which two-moving vehicle impacts are fully documented. Testing conducted in the 1960's by Severy [1] and the 1970's RICSAC test- ing [2] are two of the more well-known sources providing useful documentation. In fact, the RICSAC tests have been used by several researchers for use in the validation of accident reconstruction simulation computer pro- grams. In this paper a staged two-moving vehicle impact, or crash test, will be described and analyzed. We will begin with a description of the crash test set-up including the test condition of the vehicles and the speeds and geome- try of the impact configuration. The results of this test will be reviewed. This will include a description of the vehicle kinematics, rest positions, accelerometer data plots, residual crush profiles, and a review of the crash test dummy motion and seat belt performance. The acceler- ometer data recorded during the event will be analyzed in detail. From this data velocity histories and Delta-V's will be determined. This information will be discussed as it relates to occupant kinematics and PDOF. Finally, the post-impact information from this test will be used in an effort to reconstruct the initial conditions of the impact. The application of various accident reconstruction meth- ods to the post-test information will be reviewed. These methods include conservation of momentum and energy, and the use of commercially available accident simulation software programs. CRASH TEST DESCRIPTION The crash test analyzed in this paper is a unique two- vehicle impact in which both of the vehicles were moving. It is unique in that the set-up parameters for this test were based on the reconstruction of a specific real-world acci- dent. In this section the set-up parameters of the test are presented as well as the test results. The test vehicles involved in the subject crash test were a 1986 Subaru XL GT and a 1978 Ford LTD. The tested axle weights and ride heights are presented in Tables 1 and 2, respectively. The ride heights were measured at the top of the wheel well opening in line with the center- line of the axles. The test weights and ride heights were measured with all of the test equipment installed in the vehicles. The test equipment included instrumentation and data acquisition equipment, high-speed film cam- eras, controllers, power supplies, an ATD in the Subaru, and ballast weight to obtain the desired test weight and distribution. 577</page><page sequence="2">Table 1 .

Three accelerometer sets were installed in the Subaru XL; one each at the base of the left and right B-pillars and one at the base of the left A-pillar. Two accelerometer sets were installed on the Ford LTD; one each at the base of the left and right B-pil- lars. The locations of these accelerometer sets, relative to the center-of-gravity of the test vehicles, are shown in Table 3. The measurements indicated in this table are consistent with the coordinate system described in SAE Recommended Practice J670e [3]. Table 3. Accelerometer Set Locations.

The relative angle between these test vehicles was 90 degrees. At impact the longi- tudinal centerline of the Subaru was 5.0 feet forward of the LTD front axle centerline. The intended vehicle speeds at impact were 47 mph for the Subaru and 38 for the LTD. The impact geometry is depicted in Figure 1 . The crash test was documented with two ground-based real-time video cameras along with six 16mm ground- based high-speed film cameras and a high-speed video camera providing a slow motion playback capability nec- essary for impact analysis. In addition to the ground-based cameras, two 16mm high-speed film cameras were installed on the Subaru to document the motion of the ATD located in the driver seat. The crash dummy used in this test was a Hybrid III 50th-percentile male modified to simulate a person with a stature of 5' 9" and a weight of 156 lbs. The dummy was restrained with the available restraint system provided with the vehicle. This restraint system consisted of a Type 2 three-point seat belt with continuous webbing, a sliding latch plate, a B-pillar mounted D-ring, and an Emergency-Locking Retractor (ELR). The locking mech- anism was activated through a vehicle-sensitive mass and was further equipped with a web-grabbing feature. For this test the vehicle-sensitive mass and lockup mech- anism were removed from the retractor to observe the restraint system performance without this component. Two high-speed film cameras were installed on the vehi- cle documenting the seat belt webbing as it exits the retractor housing. The driver seat was located in the rearmost position. Figure 1 . Crash Test Impact Geometry. CRASH TEST RESULTS VEHICLE MOTION -The actual impact speeds, mea- sured with an electronic speed trap, were 46.8 mph for the Subaru and 38.0 mph for the LTD. After the initial contact and during the crushing phase of the impact the test vehicles began to yaw. The Subaru yawed counter- clockwise and the LTD yawed clockwise, when viewed from above. Subsequent to the initial impact, and after the vehicles had separated, a secondary impact occurred with the right rear fender and bumper of the Subaru strik- ing the left rear fender of the LTD. The secondary impact began at approximately 260 milliseconds after initial vehi- cle contact. Following the secondary vehicle separation the vehicles continued to yaw as they traveled to their respective rest positions. At approximately 1 .5 seconds after the initial vehicle contact, the brakes on the Subaru were remotely activated bringing the vehicle to its final rest position under the influence of full locked-wheel braking. Like- wise, for the LTD, the brakes were activated at approxi- mately 1 .5 seconds after initial contact. In Figure 2 the rest positions of the test vehicles are shown relative to the initial impact location. 578</page><page sequence="3">Figure 2. Test Vehicle Rest Positions. VEHICLE DAMAGE - The resulting residual crush dam- age for both of the test vehicles are shown in Figures 3 and 4. The residual damage to the Subaru as a result of this impact was primarily located at the right front of the vehicle. There was significant longitudinal and lateral deformation to the right front bumper and right front fender components. The right front wheel was locked as a result of impact damage. Furthermore, the right rear fender area around the wheel well was damaged as a result of the secondary impact. The damage to the LTD was mostly concentrated on the left front fender with sig- nificant lateral displacement of the fender and front bumper. The left front tire was locked as a result of impact damage. The secondary impact caused some deformation to the left rear fender around the wheel well area. ACCELEROMETER DATA - The x- and y-axis data from each accelerometer set on both test vehicles are pre- sented in Figures 5 through 9. This data was recorded at 10,000 Hz and each channel was filtered prior to digital conversion with a low-pass anti-aliasing filter. This data was then digitally filtered according to the SAE Recom- mended Practice J21 1 [4]. Thus, the accelerometer data displayed in Figures 5 through 9 has been filtered using a Class 60 filter. Figure 3. 1986 Subaru XL GT Residual Crush Damage. Figure 4. 1978 Ford LTD Residual Crush Damage. A review of Figures 5 through 7 indicate differences in the acceleration responses recorded at the various acceler- ometer set locations on the Subaru. Different responses are also noted for the LTD accelerometer data in Figures 8 and 9. These differences are due to angular accelera- tion and angular velocity effects, which are governed by the following vector expression. ap = acg +«X1, + wxwx^ (1) This vector equation can be expressed in component form as the following two scalar equations. ^px ^cgx ®py ® ^px ^ «Tpy ^cgy ^®px ® *py (^) 579</page><page sequence="4">Figure 5. Subaru Left A-Pillar Accelerometer Data. Figure 6. Subaru Left B-Pillar Accelerometer Data. Figure 7. Subaru Right B-Pillar Accelerometer Data. 580</page><page sequence="5">Figure 8. LTD Left B-Pillar Accelerometer Data. Figure 9. LTD Right B-Pillar Accelerometer Data. It can be seen from equations (2) and (3) and the accel- erometer locations in Table 3 that the longitudinal responses of the left A- and B-pillar accelerometer sets, because of their similar lateral locations, will be very much alike. However, they will not be identical because of the co2r (centripetal acceleration) term, which is a func- tion of the longitudinal location of the accelerometer sets. Additionally, because of the difference in longitudinal location, the lateral responses of these two accelerome- ter sets will be significantly different. Correspondingly, the left and right B-pillar accelerometer sets of the Sub- aru will respond similarly in the lateral direction, differing only in the centripetal acceleration component. There will, however, be significant differences in their longitudi- nal responses. The B-pillar accelerometer sets of the LTD will be subject to the same effects as described for the Subaru. It should be noted that differences in accel- erometer responses will also exist due to local vibrational responses and transducer accuracies. DUMMY KINEMATICS - The general motion of the test dummy head and upper torso was that of a curved path relative to the interior of the Subaru. In the early part of the primary impact the principal dummy motion is forward and slightly to the right. As the impact develops, as well as the counter-clockwise angular acceleration and angu- lar velocity, the upper torso and head of the dummy begin to move more laterally. The lower torso (pelvis and legs) of the dummy also initially move forward and to the right in the vehicle with subsequent lateral motion. However, as the lateral motion develops the lower torso is restrained by the lap belt portion of the restraint system and the console structure located between the two front seats of the test vehicle. Ultimately, the dummy head and upper torso end up leaning over into the right front pas- senger seat area. When the second impact occurs, the dummy moves further to the right (lateral) in the vehicle. No head contacts with the vehicle interior were observed during the primary impact. After the secondary impact occurred, the aft portion of the test dummy head con- tacted the passenger seat back. SEAT BELT PERFORMANCE A review of the high-speed film cameras indicates that during the primary impact, and at the time the web grab- ber became fully engaged, approximately 2.0 inches of webbing had been withdrawn from the retractor spool. After the web grabber became engaged no further web- bing was withdrawn from the spool. From the timing marks on the high-speed film it was determined that the web grabber became fully engaged at 49 milliseconds after initial contact between the test vehicles. The lap 581</page><page sequence="6">belt, as indicated above, was significantly loaded by the test dummy. The torso belt was loaded in the early por- tion of the primary impact. However, as the motion of the dummy became more lateral relative to the vehicle, the dummy ultimately moved away from torso belt. Tension was still present in the torso portion of the webbing as this is a continuous webbing system with a sliding latch plate. A post-test inspection of the restraint system revealed very clear indications of occupant induced load- ing on the latch plate guide loop, on the D-ring guide and on the webbing which was in contact with these compo- nents. Additionally, there were clear markings on the webbing caused by the engagement of the web grabber mechanism. An example of the seat belt marks is shown in Figures 10 and 11. Figure 1 0. Webbing Mark from Latchplate. Figure 1 1 . Mark Made from Web Grabber. ACCELEROMETER DATA ANALYSIS There was significant yaw motion developed during the impact phase of this crash test for both vehicles. As mentioned previously, this yaw motion had a profound effect on the accelerations measured by the accelerome- ters installed on the test vehicles. These effects were discussed in detail by Bundorf [5], and Marine and Werner [6]. For vehicle motions that take place primarily in the yaw plane (i.e. little vehicle roll and pitch motion), the methodology described in Reference [6] can be used to determine the test vehicle yaw angular acceleration time history. This is accomplished through the use of the X- and y-axis accelerometer data from two locations on a given test vehicle to develop the following equation. (^ax - ^bx )(*by *ay ) (^ay ^ by X*bx ^ax ) ¡ a ' a= ( - *ay w-r1 by ' W ¡ a ' Vbx *ax / vbv ray ) Where the subscripts a and b denote two different accel- erometer sets, and r^, ray, rbx and rby specify the longitu- dinal and lateral location of the accelerometer sets relative to the e.g. of the vehicle. This equation can then be numerically integrated to determine the vehicle yaw angular velocity (or yaw rate) history. Using this approach, the yaw angular accelera- tion and yaw angular velocity for both of the test vehicles were determined. The results of this analysis are shown in Figures 12 and 13. As can be seen from these figures, very high yaw angular accelerations were developed during both the primary and secondary impacts. The yaw rates for these angular accelerations are correspondingly high. The peak yaw rate during the primary impact reaches approximately 270 deg/sec for both the Subaru and the LTD. Upon the secondary impact the yaw rate magnitudes decrease rapidly for both vehicles. However the data indicates that, after final separation, both vehicles continue to possess a small yaw rate in the same direction as before the sec- ondary impact. A review of the high-speed film confirms this yaw motion. Continuing with the methodology of reference [6]: the yaw angular acceleration and yaw rate data derived from the off-e.g. accelerometers can be used, along with equa- tions (2) and (3), to resolve the acceleration response at the e.g. of the test vehicles. This analysis can be per- formed with any one of the accelerometers located on a given test vehicle. In this case we used the left A-pillar accelerometer location on the Subaru and the right B-pil- lar accelerometer for the LTD. The results are presented in Figures 14 and 15. 582</page><page sequence="7">Figure 1 2. Subaru Yaw Angular Acceleration and Yaw Rate Data. Figure 13. LTD Yaw Angular Acceleration and Yaw Rate Data. Figure 14. Subaru C.G. Acceleration Data. 583</page><page sequence="8">Figure 15. LTD C.G. Acceleration Data. With the e.g. acceleration data determined above, we now possess sufficient information to determine the e.g. velocity and the change in velocity (or Delta-V) time histo- ries. The e.g. acceleration data calculated above is expressed in a vehicle-fixed coordinate system that is changing orientation (rotating) with respect to the ground (an inertial-fixed coordinate system). Thus, to determine the vehicle velocity components expressed in the vehicle- fixed system, we make use of the following relationships for acceleration in a rotating reference frame. du ax=- -vco (5) dv ay = ļļT+UC0 Where u is the longitudinal velocity, v is the lateral veloc- ity and to is the yaw rate. Using the data from this test, these equations were inte- grated to determine the vehicle-fixed velocity (u and v) time histories for the test vehicles. The results of this analysis appear in Figures 16 and 17. Figure 1 6. Subaru C.G. Velocity Components. Figure 1 7. LTD C.G. Velocity Components. With the e.g. velocity histories, the Delta-V for the test vehicles can be determined. Delta-V is a vector quantity determined through the subtraction of two velocity vec- tors. The e.g. velocity components determined above are expressed in a vehicle-fixed system. Therefore, to deter- mine the Delta-V (relative to the initial velocity) in a vehi- cle-fixed system, the initial velocity vector must be transformed onto the vehicle-fixed coordinate system at every time increment. Generally speaking, the Delta-V in the vehicle-fixed frame of reference is expressed as, AV = (u(t) - u0 cos 0(t) - v0 sin 0(t))ej + (v(t) + u0 sin 0(t) - v0 cos 0(t))e2 (7) Where u0 and v0 are the initial velocity components, u(t) and v(t) are the velocity components at some discrete time after impact, and 0(t) is the yaw angle through whscf the vehicle has rotated after impact. Additionally, e&lt;t and e2 are unit vectors aligned with the longitudinal and lat- eral vehicle-fixed coordinate system axes, respectively. In order to perform the calculations using equation (7), the yaw angle time history must be determined. This can be found through a second integration of the yaw angular acceleration data. Integrating data twice can sometimes produce unreliable information as bias offsets in the orig- inal data can significantly affect the integration output. 584</page><page sequence="9">For this analysis the high-speed film was reviewed and confirmed the reliability of the yaw angle data. Alterna- tively, the Delta-V calculations can be determined in a space-fixed coordinate system. This is done by trans- forming the velocity components onto the space-fixed system at each time-step, then subtracting the initial velocity components from this data. The results of the e.g. Delta-V analysis, applied to the crash test data for both vehicles, are shown in Figures 1 8 and 19. Of special consideration in the data presented in Figures 16 and 17 is the Delta-V calculated during the secondary impact, which occurs between 250 millisec- onds and 300 milliseconds. The data indicates that the Delta-V's after the second impact are approximately 45 mph for the Subaru and 28 mph for the LTD. These val- ues represent the vector difference between the velocity after the second impact and the velocity at initial vehicle contact. Care should be taken in reviewing this data as the second impact does not produce such large Delta- V's. To determine the Delta-V specific to the secondary impact, an initial impact velocity should be chosen at a time just prior to the second impact and subsequent Delta-V's should be determined relative to this initial vec- tor. In fact, the Delta-V for the Subaru during the second impact is approximately 10 mph (primarily lateral) and approximately 6 mph for the LTD (again, primarily lateral). Figure 18. Subaru C.G. Delta-V. Figure 1 9. LTD C.G. Delta-V. Of more importance in understanding the occupant kine- matics relative to the vehicle and the potential for injury is the determination of the Delta-V's experienced at the var- ious seating locations. With knowledge of the e.g. veloc- ity and yaw rate history, the velocity at any seat location is easily determined through the following equations, Up^cg-ÛMy (8) Vp = Vcg+(ūrx (9) Where rx and ry are the longitudinal and lateral seating locations relative to the vehicle e.g. The seat position Delta-V's are then calculated using equation (7) with the same initial velocity vector since there was no initial yaw motion. This approach was applied to the driver seat position of the Subaru and is shown in Figure 20. A close examina- tion of the data in Figure 20 and that of the Subaru c.g Delta-V reveal slight differences in the longitudinal and lateral components. The longitudinal component at the driver location is slightly larger in magnitude than at the c.g. and the lateral component is less at the driver posi- tion that at the c.g. Considering the counterclockwise yaw motion and with the driver position aft and to the left of the vehicle e.g., this is the expected response. Figure 20. Subaru Driver Location Delta-V Data. An alternative method for displaying this data is to plot the Delta-V vectors over a drawing of a vehicle. This lends itself to an improved visualization of the way the Delta-V changes in magnitude and orientation as the impact develops. The driver location Delta-V has been plotted up to 200 milliseconds in this manner in Figure 21 (the Delta-V vectors for the other Subaru seat positions and those of the LTD are included in the Appendix at the end of this paper). This diagram indicates that early in the impact the Delta-V vector is mostly longitudinal and is oriented approximately 200 degrees relative to the vehi- cle-fixed coordinates with a magnitude of about 9 mph. At approximately 150 milliseconds after initial vehicle contact, the primary crash pulse is over and the vehicles are separating. At this time the Delta-V vector is oriented at approximately 230 degrees with a magnitude of about 33 mph. 585</page><page sequence="10">Often an accident ^constructionist is asked to determine the Principal Direction of Force (PDOF) of an impact. The PDOF can be useful to those who are interested in occupant kinematics in that it is usually considered to be the direction that the occupant(s) will tend to move rela- tive to the vehicle interior. The reconstructionist will usu- ally be able to define the pre- and post-impact velocity vectors and a Delta-V can then be determined. Subse- quently the angle defining the orientation of the Delta-V vector relative to the ground (or inertial-fixed coordinates) can be defined. This is typically done without the yaw motion time history available to resolve the Delta-V in vehicle coordinates. In impacts like this crash test, with significant impact induced yaw motion, the notion of a single PDOF value for the accident is somewhat ambiguous. As Figure 21 indicates the Delta-V vector is changing, both in magni- tude and orientation, relative to the vehicle as the impact progresses. During the primary impact the Delta-V vec- tor has swept through an angle of approximately 30 degrees. What this means is that an uncoupled mass within the occupant compartment will move in a curved path relative to the vehicle interior. This is illustrated in Figure 22 where the path of an uncoupled mass, origi- nally located at the driver position of the Subaru and trav- elling at the same initial velocity, is shown relative to the vehicle.

The uncoupled mass motion depicted in Figure 22 resembles that of the dummy head in the crash test in that the initial motion is forward and to the right, becom- ing more lateral as the impact develops. This is espe- cially true in the early portion of the crash pulse. However, seat belt loads and interaction with the center console alters the dummy path relative to the uncoupled mass motion resulting in less forward and rightward excursion. ACCIDENT RECONSTRUCTION EXERCISE CRUSH ENERGY ANALYSIS - The energy absorbed by the test vehicles during the impact can be estimated by using their residual crush profiles and the appropriate crush model. In this test the Subaru sustained damage from the initial impact to the front bumper and right front quarter panel. The LTD sustained damage to the front bumper and left front quarter panel. Both vehicles also sustained damage to the right rear and left rear, respec- tively, during a second impact or side slap. FTT' I UlJ Ljí I UlJ - Ljí M I [ f • 75ms ļ 50 ms V / l' - 1 o j a Figure 22. Path of an Uncoupled Mass in the Subaru. The vehicle crush energy is often found through the use of the CRASH3 vehicle stiffness coefficients A and B in the Campbell model. These stiffness coefficients are usu- ally found from rigid barrier crash test data. Frontal stiff- ness coefficients are most often found from Federal Motor Vehicle Safety Standard (FMVSS) 208 30-mph frontal barrier tests and New Car Assessment Program (NCAP) 35-mph frontal barrier tests. For the interested reader, references [7] - [10] provide excellent discus- sions on vehicle crush energy analysis. For non-uniform crush profiles a piecewise-linear crush energy formula- tion has been suggested and is discussed in [10]. In this test both vehicles sustained damage best described as a front corner impact. An angled barrier test most closely resembles this damage and such a test was available for the Subaru. The crush stiffness values derived from this test are 262 lb/in and 71 lb/in/in for A and B, respectively. This compares with values of 243 lb/in and 60 lb/in/in for A and B, respectively, derived from an average of five flat faced barrier tests. No angled bar- rier tests were available for the LTD. Values of 227 lb/in and 53 lb/in/in for A and B, respectively, were derived from an average of six flat faced barrier tests. Using these crush stiffness values, the vehicle crush energies 586</page><page sequence="11">for the above test were found by including the damage across the front corner of each vehicle. Factors were included to account for the angle of the crush and the reduction in the swept width of the crush [11], The calcu- lated total crush energy was 1 62,00 foot-pounds. Using the accelerometer data, the kinetic energy dissipated during the initial impact was calculated to be 150,000 foot-pounds at separation. The difference of 8% is due in part to the uncertainty in dealing with the unusual dam- age pattern. The remainder of the difference may be due to inaccuracy in the stiffness values. Reliable stiffness values for the second impact were not available. Calculations were done using the frontal stiff- ness values and yielded a damage energy loss of 27,400 foot-pounds. Thus the total predicted for the entire colli- sion was 189,400 foot-pounds. This compares with 204,000 foot-pounds of kinetic energy dissipated during both impacts as calculated from the accelerometer data. The difference of 7% is due to the reasons stated above and to frictional losses during the impact. The vehicles moved about 13 feet during the impact sequence which would result in frictional losses between the tires and the ground. The difference in energies would be accounted for by a friction loss using an effective friction coefficient of only 0.16. An indication of the severity of the impact can be obtained from the crush energy by calculating the Equiv- alent Barrier Speed (EBS), which is the speed of impact with a fixed barrier that would result in the same crush energy absorption. The EBS values for the first impact are 27.8 mph and 25.9 mph for the Subaru and LTD respectively. These are roughly comparable to the Delta- V's calculated from the acceleration data of 34 mph and 20.6 mph, respectively. MOMENTUM ANALYSIS - The impact and rest positions of the two test vehicles were measured and are shown in Figures 1 and 2. Using these positions a simple two dimensional momentum analysis was done to predict the initial velocities and the Delta-V's of the vehicles. The velocities were adjusted to balance pre and post-impact momentum and to approximate the frictional energy lost during run-out to rest. Additionally, an attempt was made to match a target damage energy loss of 200,000 foot- pounds. This was an approximation of the energy loss for both impacts. The impact angles were -90° and 180° for the Subaru and LTD, respectively. Although these angles would not normally be known with certainty, they were used in the analysis assuming a 90° intersection with no pre-impact steering. The departure angles of the test vehicles after the second impact, as derived from the data and overhead camera were -156° and -134° for the Subaru and LTD, respectively. These angles must be estimated by the reconstructionist. For example, if tire marks are present immediately after the point of impact they can be used to estimate the departure angles. The angles from impact position directly to rest positions were -161° and -101° for the Subaru and LTD, respectively. A mistaken use of these values can lead to impact veloci- ties that are incorrect by over 20%. Using departure angles of -1 53° and -1 32° for the Subaru and LTD, which are estimates near the actual values, and matching the damage energy yields initial speeds esti- mates of 49.0 mph and 37.4 mph for the Subaru and LTD, respectively. These speeds are in error by less than 2 mph. The Delta-V values were calculated and represent the combined effect of both impacts. The values from the momentum analysis are 44.9 mph and 28.0 mph for the Subaru and LTD, respectively. These are within 1 mph of the values from the accelerometer date of 45.0 mph and 28.7 mph. SIMULATION PROGRAMS EDSMAC AND EDCRASH - Engineering Dynamics Corporation's version of the Cal- span reconstruction program SMAC [12] was used to simulate the test. The vehicle physical parameters and initial conditions were set to agree with the known values from the crash test. The program was run in an iterative fashion by changing the post-impact drag factors and matching the rest positions, damage energy, and in a general way the damage profiles. With initial velocities of 47 mph and 38 mph for the Sub- aru and LTD, respectively the EDSMAC simulation yields results very close to the test results. The program pre- dicts both impacts and the profiles match in a general way. Figure 23 shows the path and rest positions from the crash test and the EDSMAC simulation. The pre- dicted rest positions from EDSMAC agree with the test positions to within one foot and 14° in linear and angular position for both vehicles. Figure 23. EDSMAC Simulation Trajectory. A comparison of the energy loss during the crash test with the EDSMAC calculation is shown in Figure 24. Separation after the first impact occurs at approximately 0.125 seconds. Again the accelerometer data indicates that the kinetic energy dissipated during the initial impact was 150,000 foot-pounds. The EDSMAC program pre- dicts an energy loss of 1 54,000 foot-pounds for the first 587</page><page sequence="12">impact, a difference of only 3%. Separation after the sec- ond impact occurs at 0.309 seconds. The total energy lost during the collisions was measured to be 204,000 foot-pounds; the EDSMAC simulation predicts separation at 0.300 seconds with an energy loss of 203,900 foot- pounds, an effectively identical result. Figure 24. EDSMAC/Crash Test Energy Comparison. The Delta-V for both vehicles during the entire collision phase is predicted very well by EDSMAC in both magni- tude and direction. Figures 25 and 26 show a compari- son of the velocity change for the Subaru and the LTD. At separation after the first impact the Delta-V's are 33.9 mph and 20.9 mph with angles of 217° and 129° in vehi- cle coordinates for the Subaru and LTD, respectively. The acceleration data yields values of 34.0 mph and 20.6 mph with angles of 215° and 120°, respectively. The EDSMAC predictions are within 1 mph and 1 0° of the test data. The Delta-V values for the entire event are similarly close. Figure 25. Subaru Delta-V Comparison. Engineering Dynamics Corporation's version of the Cal- span reconstruction program CRASH, called EDCRASH [13] was also used to analyze the test. An immediate dif- ficulty in using the program is encountered when describ- ing the damage profiles. The program employs the Collision Damage Classification [14] that requires the profile to be described as damage along one side or the front or the back. A corner profile where the side and front are damaged requires some compromise in the description. Choosing to describe the damage of the Subaru as frontal and the LTD as a side impact and using the stiffnesses listed above, damage based Delta-V val- ues were calculated. The Delta-V values for the first impact were calculated to be 27.3 mph and 16.9 mph for the Subaru and Ford, respectively. These are 6.7 mph and 3.7 mph below the Delta-V's calculated from the acceleration data of 34.0 mph and 20.6 mph, respec- tively. The trajectory analysis option in EDCRASH was also employed. The resulting impact speeds and Delta-V values were found to be within 2 mph of those of the crash test. However the damage and momentum solu- tions did not converge. Figure 26. LTD Delta-V Comparison. CONCLUSION In this paper a detailed analysis of a staged two-vehicle impact was presented. Accelerometer data from the vehicles was presented and analyzed to determine veloc- ity components at the vehicle c.g.'s and the change in velocity or Delta-V's. This data was used to determine the Delta-V at the driver location. It was demonstrated that, in an impact such as this, the yaw motion of the vehicle must be accounted for when discussing the occu- pant motion within a vehicle. During the impact the ATD in the driver position moved forward and to the right as expected based on the impact direction and yaw motion. The ATD was successfully restrained by the available three-point seat belt system without the benefit of the vehicle-sensitive lock-up mech- anism. There was no significant "second impact" between the occupant and the vehicle interior despite the violent and unusual nature of the collision. This collision resulted in a complex pattern of damage to the test vehicles. Using common reconstruction meth- ods, values for the damage energy were calculated that were within 10% of the actual kinetic energy lost. The analysis highlights the difficulty in treating "corner" impacts where both the side and front of a vehicle are damaged. Performance of additional staged collisions of 588</page><page sequence="13">this type could be conducted to allow the development of a protocol for treating this type of profile. Also because of the complex nature of the collision the calculated Equivalent Barrier Speeds were significantly different than the calculated test vehicle Delta-V's. Careful application of simple momentum analysis resulted in fairly accurate determination of the Initial velocities and overall Delta-V's. This method did not pro- duce detailed information about the separate impacts. However, treating the two impacts as a lumped event resulted In a good estimation of Impact velocities and Delta-V's. The use of the popular accident simulation program EDS- MAC also resulted in very accurate determination of the initial velocities and overall Delta-V's. In addition, the detailed time-history information of the total energy loss and Delta-V's obtained from EDSMAC closely matched the actual crash test data. REFERENCES 1. Severy, D. M., Mathewson, J.
