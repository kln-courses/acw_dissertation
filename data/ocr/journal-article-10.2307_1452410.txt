<plain_text><page sequence="1">CONTRIBUTIONS TO THE TEXTUAL CRITICISM OF JUDAH HA-LEVI'S KITAB AL-KHAZARI By LEON NEMOY Yale University Library THE Treatise on the differences between the Rabbanites and the Karaites,I composed by Sa'd ibn Mansur ibn Kam- muna (circa 1300)2 and preserved in a unique manuscript at Berlin,3 was recognized already by its discoverer, Moritz Steinschneider,4 as a compilation containing large extracts from the Arabic original of the Kitab al-Khazari. Its importance for the textual criticism of Judah ha-Levi's masterpiece is further enhanced by the fact that the manu- script of Ibn Kammfna's Treatise is over 120 years older than the Oxford manuscript of the Kitab al-Khazari,s which served as a basis for Dr. Hirschfeld's edition of the latter Edited (unfortunately, with many errors) by Dr. Hirschfeld, in his Arabic Chrestomathy in Hebrew Characters, London, 1892, pp. 69-103. Cf. Bacher, in the REJ, XXV, 151 ff.; XXVI, 310 ff. 2Steinschneider's theory, that the Treatise was a Karaite forgery and that Ibn Kammfina had been converted to Islam, has been con- clusively shown to be untenable by Dr. D. H. Baneth, in the MGWJ, LXIX, 295 ff. I believe there is good reason to assume that the Treatise is actually an apologia pro domo rabbinica and a direct appeal to the Karaites, inviting them to come back to the orthodox fold. Only in this light can we explain the fact that Ibn Kammfna devotes twice as much space to the defense of the Rabbanites as to that of the Karaites, and that he steers clear of such troublesome matters as the laws of marriage and inheritance. 3 Berlin Oeffentliche (formerly K6nigliche) Bibliothek, Codex Or.

To be sure, the al-Khazari pas- sages quoted by Ibn Kammina, taken together, form only a small part of the entire bulk of Judah ha-Levi's work. Nevertheless, they furnish ample evidence to prove that the al-Khazari text used by Ibn Kammfna, while not perfect,8 was superior to that represented by the Oxford manuscript. Moreover, in one case,9 a lacuna left empty in Dr. Hirsch- feld's edition could have been entirely restored by a refer- ence to the corresponding paragraph in the Treatise. The following list of corrections, culled from Ibn Kam- muna's Treatise, is arranged in the order of Dr. Hirschfeld's text of the Kitab al-Khazari. The Arabic part of it is designated "Kh," Judah ibn Tibbon's Hebrew translation "KhH," Ibn Kammuna's Treatise "Kam". All citations are by page and line. 176,20 Rnm,Dpnl is confirmed by Kam 97,16; KhH's 6npn;l (177,22) seems to be based upon a reading nriD'pnl (cf. Kh 178,26, where however KhH translates lyni-n (179,25) ). 178,18 Hirschfeld's emendation Iw'zr i;nt is entirely unnecessary, as the Oxford Ms. reads, correctly enough, ll"tvrmn% (Kh p. xiv), which is a lapsus calami for ',wD,:)1N, Kam. 97,24, thus confirming Goldziher's correction.
