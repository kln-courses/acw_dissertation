<plain_text><page sequence="1">Wordsworth, the One Life, and The Ruined Cottage by William A. Ulmer O NE of the most respected accounts of Wordsworth's early intel- lectual development centers on his acceptance, revision, and eventual abandonment of Coleridge's notion of the One Life. This pantheist notion was implicated in Wordsworth's initial concep- tion of The Recluse, in the great achievement of The Ruined Cottage, and in those Pedlar passages which, looking ahead to the retrospective writing done at Goslar, look ahead ultimately to The Prelude.2 Because the One Life proved so important for Wordsworth's career, it is impor- tant to consider the problems raised by available accounts of Words- worth's pantheism. One such problem involves the inability to explain why Wordsworth lost his pantheist convictions-"for some reason that we cannot know," Jonathan Wordsworth remarks, "the system lost its hold"-and another, excessive dissociation of the One Life and The Ruined Cottage.3 I believe these interrelated problems follow from the 'This view was introduced by Jonathan Wordsworth in three studies published in 1969-1970: 7he Music of Humanity: A Critical Study of Wordsworth's "Ruined Cottage" Incor- porating Texts from a Manuscript of 1799-1800 (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1969); "Words- worth's Bcrderers" (1969), repr. in English Romantic Poets: Modern Essays in Criticism, ed. M. H. Abrams, 2nd ed. (New York: Oxford University Press, 1975), 170-87; and "The Two-Part Prelude of 1799" (1970), repr. in The Prelude 1799, 1805, 1850, ed. Jonathan Wordsworth, M. H. Abrams, and Stephen Gill (New York: Norton, 1979), 567-85. These studies present the poet's pantheist conversion as thoroughgoing and certain; they refer, for instance, to the "brief period in which [Wordsworth] was totally convinced of the One Life" and to "the certainty of Wordsworth's belief in the One Life" (The Music of Humanity, 202, 216). Most Wordsworthians seemingly agree that the Pedlar drafts of early 1798 reveal the poet's personal convictions. 2 In his discussion of Wordsworth's account of the Pedlar's experiences of the One Life, James K. Chandler remarks that "[n]othing else he wrote compares with the power of these 25 9-odd lines to feed Wordsworth's future years," in Wordsworth 's Second Nature: A Study of the Poetry and Politics (Chicago: University of Chicago Press, 1984), 95. 3 Jonathan Wordsworth, "The Two-Part Prelude," 575.

Ulmer 305 very supposition of a Wordsworthian pantheist phase. Efforts to ex- plain Wordsworth's 1798 poetry on the One Life as an expression of personal conviction, and therefore as evidence of a philosophic phase, finally depend upon a dissemination of pantheist statements among several texts. I will argue that Wordsworth's few indisputable affirma- tions of the One Life occur exclusively in the Pedlar material written for The Ruined Cottage. They remain specific not to a developmental phase, in short, but to a particular poetic project: his 1798 attempt to give The Ruined Cottage a consoling pantheist conclusion. Because Wordsworth's imaginative engagement with pantheism was localized in The Ruined Cottage, the text's compositional history decisively clarifies the poet's reception and abandonment of pantheist theory. The poem suggests that Wordsworth's growing reservations about the One Life rested on the idea of Necessity as an especially powerful expression of panthe- istic holism.4 But it also suggests that his assent to the One Life was always less confident and complete than critics often contend. I. WORDSWORTH'S PANTHEIST PHASE Any reconsideration of Wordsworth's pantheist phase must address questions of chronology and doctrine. According to the prevailing view, Wordsworth acquired his commitment to the One Life under plication the One Life, "has almost no bearing on The Ruined Cottage proper"-for him, T7he Ruined Cottage MS D (The Music of Humanity, xiii). Regarding the poet's dissatisfac- tion with pantheism, Jonathan Wordsworth tacitly reconstructs the grounds for Words- worth's turn from the One Life by noting the humanist perspective and "flirtation with the transcendental" in the two-part Prelude of 1798-1799 ("The Two-part Prelude," 576). More recently, John A. Hodgson has argued that Wordsworth renounced the One Life because "the immortality it promises comes ... at the expense of human individuality, awareness, and intelligence," but this claim, as compelling as I find it, has not elicited much response from Wordsworthians (Wordsworth's Philosophical Poetry, 1797-1814 [Lin- coln: University of Nebraska Press, 1980], xv). 4 The primary evidence concerning Wordsworth's view of Necessity-which I dis- cuss in the second section of this essay-is conveniently gathered by Melvin Rader in Wordsworth: A Philosophical Approach (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967), 17-21, 6o-62. I have found no warrant for accepting Rader's particular claims about Wordsworth's re- jection of Necessity, a rejection Rader credits to Coleridge's influence, attributed to the breakdown of Wordsworth's conversion to Spinoza (who supposedly offered the poet a temporarily persuasive reconciliation of determinism and freedom), and dates as late as 1804. My view of Wordsworth's presentation of Necessity in The Ruined Cottage does draw on Paul D. Sheats's account of the conflict of naturalism and humanism in the poem, especially his comment that the poet-figure's "human compassion for Margaret ... im- plicitly compensates for the 'chearful' necessitarianism of the pedlar," in The Making of Wordsworth's Poetry, 1785-1798 (Cambridge, Mass.: Harvard University Press, 1973), 179.</page><page sequence="3">306 Wordsworth and the One Life Coleridge's tutelage in late 1797, felt doubt by July 1798-when the "new hesitation" and darkened tone of "Tintern Abbey" trouble its pantheist joyfulness-and discarded pantheism by the year's close.5 After July 1798, Wordsworth wrote verse which expresses vaguely pan- theist sentiments at times. More significantly, in the Peter Bell MS 2, dated approximately February 1799, he described "that one interior life" In which all beings live with God, themselves Are God, existing in one mighty whole, As undistinguishable as the cloudless east At noon is from the cloudless west, when all The hemisphere is one cerulean blue.6 These lines unarguably celebrate the One Life; yet on that score they are also quite uncharacteristic of the pOst-1798 Wordsworth. Harking back to an earlier mood, they may well have been left fragmentary precisely because their "extreme pantheist viewpoint" left them thematically in- congruous and artistically unserviceable.7 The case for Wordsworth's continuing allegiance to the One Life after 1798 depends not on newly composed material but on his habit of relocating 1798 passages describ- ing the One Life in later texts. Yet such relocations will not support claims for Wordsworth's later Jonathan Vordsworth, The Music of Humanity, 213. Hodgson writes that "by late 1798 Wordsworth was coming to regard his belief in the one life as simply inadequate to sus- tain and console him in the face of inevitable human loss" (49). 6 Cited from The Prelude 1799, i8o5, i850, 496 n. 2.

As Jonathan Words- worth notes, this passage was actually deemed serviceable for a brief time: it was in- serted into MS RV of the two-part Prelude after the "sentiment of being" lines (2.446-64), but removed when "the completion of RV was followed at once by the transcription in MSS V and LI of the full text of 1799" (The Prelude 1799, 1805, 1850, 514). I would explain these lines as an effort to make progress on The Recluse by summoning up the philoso- phy on which the projected poem had largely been predicated.</page><page sequence="4">William A. Ulmer 307 pantheism. His careful revision of reused Pedlar material emerges clearly, for example, even in the two-part Prelude written just a few months after the height of his pantheist enthusiasm. Wordsworth trans- ferred two Pedlar passages to the 1799 Prelude. The first, concerning the legacy of "possible sublimity" left by visionary intimations prompted by sound (2.351-71), makes no specific reference to the One Life. In the second, however, Wordsworth recounts the "bliss ineffable" with which he supposedly "felt the sentiment of being spread / O'er all that moves," and ends, "in all things / I saw one life, and felt that it was joy" (2.446-64). This later announcement of the One Life-it is a point we will return to-is introduced with telling disclaimers. Recollecting his habit of observing "affinities / In objects where no brotherhood exists" (2.433-34), Wordsworth reflects, And, whether from this habit rooted now So deeply in my mind, or from excess Of the great social principle of life Coercing all things into sympathy, To unorganic natures I transferred My own enjoyments, or, the power of truth Coming in revelation, I conversed With things that really are, I at this time Saw blessings spread around me like a sea. (2.436-44) So introduced, what had been an unclouded affirmation of the One Life becomes an affirmation of emotionally powerful experiences with ambiguous ontological implications. The "sentiment of being," Words- worth forthrightly allows, may have been an illusory projection rather than a perceptual "conversation" with "things that really are." The poem accepts the power of the speaker's experience without favoring either of the interpretations tentatively assigned it. Jonathan Words- worth's claim that Wordsworth's "pantheist assertions, though some found their way into The Prelude, some even into 7he Excursion, go back with very few exceptions to the first half of 1798" is consequently truer than he may intend.8 For Pedlar materials included in later texts in- variably prove so reworked that they can hardly be termed "pantheist assertions." 9 8 Jonathan Wordsworth, The Music of Hunanity, 213. 9 The focus of my argument precludes consideration of all of Wordsworth's later re- locations of Pedlar passages, but see the discussion of "Not useless do I deem" in its later Excursion form in part 2 of this essay.</page><page sequence="5">308 Wordsworth and the One Life In reconsidering Wordsworth's period of dedication to the One Life we are dealing, then, with the brief period extending from late 1797 to mid or late 1798. We are also dealing with a complex of highly defined doctrines. No pleas on behalf of the conceptually unsystematic charac- ter of the poet's mind, no emphasis on his interest in pantheist philoso- phy principally for its poetic usefulness, can alter this point. The pre- vailing account of Wordsworth and the One Life necessarily credits him with beliefs of a highly particularized cast. Without these claims of doc- trinal particularity, Wordsworth's pantheist poetry drifts toward the unexceptional and conventional-toward appearing merely a poetic variation on "the pervasive fictions of natural sentiment which imbued English poetry as the eighteenth century wore on," or a philosophical variation on that "postulation of an animate universe [which] was no novelty" in the thought of the time.'0 Most Wordsworthians concede that the poet's intimations of a spiritual force in nature possess vaguely pantheist affinities. Interpretations of Wordsworth's early intellectual development which stress his faith in the One Life make significant claims only in invoking a pantheism markedly different from the liter- ary "pantheism" prominent in his contemporary cultural milieu. No reworked commonplace, Wordsworth's belief in the One Life fol- lows upon Coleridge's rigorous accommodation of a specific tradition of materialist pantheism, the belief in animated matter, to a radical Christianity which envisioned the universal life force as the "one Mind, one omnipresent Mind" of God (Religious Musings, 105). Wordsworth rejected the Unitarian understructure of Coleridgean pantheism, but otherwise embraced it. Intimating the One Life, the Pedlar traces "an ebbing and a flowing mind" in ostensibly inanimate objects, the "fixed and steady lineaments" of rocks, and stones, and trees (RC&amp;P, pp. 153, 155). As a convert to the One Life, Wordsworth would have believed in an immanent divinity and in the living consciousness of all natural forms as modulations of the Universal Mind. But he would have also believed in the gradual approximation of all things to ultimate good- ness. Thus, in Wordsworth's important "Not Useless Do I Deem" lines, love of nature leads unavoidably to love of man. For awareness of "the sentiment of being" inspires virtue by promoting appreciation of the moral harmony of all existence. So, in early 1798 Wordsworth "not only 10 My quoted phrases are borrowed from Kenneth R. Johnston, Wordsworth and "The Recluse" (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1984), 20; and from M. H.

Ulmer 309 believed that 'There [was] an active principle alive / In all things,'" Jonathan Wordsworth sununarily remarks, "but went on from this quite ordinary position to assert a universe of blessedness and love, based on the assumption that the individual could perceive as well as share 'the life of things.'"1I To credit Wordsworth with faith in the One Life we must credit him with just this morally exalted vision of moral and ontological har- mony. The task imposes certain difficulties. For in Wordsworth as in all "Romantic poetry concerned with the 'active universe,'" H. W. Piper cautions, "careful reading is sometimes needed to distinguish between the core of doctrine and the Platonic colouring which came so easily.""2 In seeking poetic evidence of Wordsworth's 1797-98 pantheism, we must preserve the distinction between the One Life as a "core of doc- trine" and the sentimental, undoctrinaire "pantheism" of the period. So Jonathan Wordsworth does in declaring Coleridge the inspiration be- hind Wordsworth's belief: he challenges Piper's dismissal of the claim that "Coleridge was the source of Wordsworth's ideas on the life in Nature," for example, by insisting on the "distinction between a quasi- scientific belief in animated matter on the one hand, and on the other, a belief in a universe permeated by the One Life," and by denying that Wordsworth's 1794 poetry supposedly substantiating Piper's position refers specifically to the One Life.'3 The passage adduced by Piper comes from Wordsworth's 1794 revisions of An Evening Walk: A heart that vibrates evermore, awake To feeling for all forms that Life can take, That wider still its sympathy extends, And sees not any line where being ends; Sees sense, through Nature's rudest forms betrayed, Tremble obscure in fountain, rock, and shade; And while a secret power those forms endears Their social accents never vainly hears. (125-30) Jonathan Wordsworth's denial that this passage refers to the One Life has been widely accepted, and I have no intention of challenging the majority opinion. In their attribution of sensation ("sense") to inani- mate objects, however, the lines verge closely on statements made in 11 Jonathan Wordsworth, "Wordsworth's Borderers," 176. 12 H. W.

Clearly, they resemble the Pedlar poetry enough to permit misreadings of their philosophical assump- tions-and the mere possibility of misreading becomes instructive. If the Evening Walk revisions can appear indebted to the One Life when no such debts truly exist, then how many of Wordsworth's ostensibly pantheist poems may similarly owe little to the One Life? The question involves seven texts. While presenting The Pedlar nar- rative and 'Tintern Abbey" as its chief exhibits, The Music of Humanity obliquely characterizes "The Old Cumberland Beggar" and "Lines Written in Early Spring" as poems which refer to the One Life, and mentions "Nutting," "Hart-Leap Well," and a Prelude passage as be- lated reminiscences of Wordsworth's pantheist enthusiasm. In 'The Old Cumberland Beggar," to begin with it, Wordsworth avows that 'Tis Nature's law That none, the meanest of created things, Of forms created the most vile and brute, The dullest or most noxious, should exist Divorced from good-a spirit and pulse of good, A life and soul, to every mode of being Inseparably linked. (73-79) Do these lines demonstrate a faith in the One Life? I suggest that Wordsworth's description of the comprehensive harmony decreed by "nature's lawv" is not clearly or powerfully pantheistic. His later ref- erence to 'the benignant law of Heaven" his readers would probably have taken as a conventional allusion to the Christian God. Just so, the lines quoted above describe a providential universality common to traditional beliefs that life-down to the least sparrow's fall-mani- fested a moral design. In "Lines Written in Early Spring," similarly, the speaker's "faith that every flower / Enjoys the air it breathes" (11-12) differs little from commonplace fictions of natural sentiment and sym- pathy: "Blows not a Zephyr but it whispers joy," exclaims the poet of the 1793 Descriptive Sketches" (i8). The other texts involved provide little more evidence of pantheism. The Prelude passage supposedly indebted to theories about the One Life follows the stolen boat incident in Book i: Wisdom and spirit of the universe, Thou soul that art the eternity of thought,</page><page sequence="8">William A. Ulmer 311 That giv'st to forms and images a breath And everlasting motion- (1805, 1.427-430) This apostrophe presumably appeared related to the One Life because, first, it characterizes the universal spirit as "thought" and, second, de- clares that spirit present in natural "forms and images" as an energiz- ing presence: thus, in lines reminiscent of "Tintern Abbey," we have a divine mind diffused throughout the natural world. But surely none of these implications specifically presupposes the One Life. The charac- terization of divinity and the reference to divine inspiration-as in God breathing life into Adam-appear thoroughly conventional and are certainly reconcilable with Christian tradition. The gentleness toward nature counseled in "Nutting"-on the grounds that "there is a spirit in the woods" (56)-also seems conventionally pious. Equally general- ized and conventional is the pantheist ambience of "Hart-Leap Well": "The Being, that is in the clouds and air, That is in the green leaves among the groves, Maintains a deep and reverential care For the unoffending creatures whom he loves." (165-68) This personified "Being" ("whom he loves") could conceivably figure the caring yet transcendent God of Christian tradition. He hardly ap- pears a wholly immanent presence: in "Hart-Leap Well" the divine Being is in-yet not identical with- the clouds, air, and leaves. Noth- ing in "Hart-Leap Well" seems radically incompatible with doctrines specific to the idea of the One Life. At the same time, nothing in the poem seems incompatible with a Christian transcendentalism, or with Platonic naturalism, or with a sentimentally tinged nature-morality centered on the suffering of animals.14 Similar ambiguities recur in "Tintern Abbey." The poem has been declared "Wordsworth's most successful statement of his belief in the One Life."'75 Yet "Tintern Abbey" renders the issue of belief problem- 14 The problems involved in determining a One Life canon appear when Hodgson, despite endorsing the idea of Wordsworth's conversion to faith in the One Life, discerns in 'Hart-Leap Well" the poet's "new vision of a Being beyond nature" (Wordsworth's Philosophical Poetry, 50). But readers should also note that only four of the seven texts in question fall within the agreed-upon chronological limits of Wordsworth's acceptance of the One Life. 15 Mary Jacobus, Tradition and Experiment in Wordsworth's "Lyrical Ballads" (1798) (Ox- ford: Clarendon Press, 1976), 129.</page><page sequence="9">312 Wordsworth and the One Life atic by ignoring doctrine to concentrate on the mysteries of individual experience. Recalling the intensities of vision, Wordsworth claims only to have "felt / A presence," an elevating "sense sublime / Of some- thing" (93-96). Such locutions refuse the reductiveness of systematic formulations while allowing for a broad range of implication. As a re- sult, the poem's philosophical vision can seem extraordinarily eclectic. While drawing on Hartley, Locke, and the tradition of British empiri- cism, "Tintern Abbey" also assimilates idealist and transcendentalist ideas.16 At the same time, the text retains its ties to conventional reli- gion: Sheats justly remarks that "to assert that a 'spirit. . . rolls through all things' is, strictly speaking, no more or less pantheistic than to as- sert that the 'spirit of God moved upon the face of the waters' "-and Wordsworth certainly avoids the strictly pantheistic.'7 When his ac- count of the visionary trance relents to further definition, the doubled locution-"motion and a spirit" (ioo)-tacitly refuses any identifica- tion of the natural and supernatural. What he felt registered like a "motion," a term connoting the physical world of measurable proper- ties, and yet like a "spirit" too: and so his feelings, requiring both terms, reconfirm the difference between them."' That reconfirmation hardly denies the philosophical vision of "Tin- tern Abbey" a pantheist ambience. Neither Grob nor Thomas wholly banishes the One Life from Wordsworth's poem.'9 At one point even 16 Arthur Beatty established Wordsworth's debts to empiricism in William Wordsworth: His Doctrine and Art in Their Historical Relations (Madison: University of Wisconsin Press, 1922). Alan Grob reads "Tintern Abbey" as an idealist adaptation of Lockean empiricism in The Philosophic Mind: A Study of Wordsworth's Poetry and Thought, 1797-1805 (Colum- bus: Ohio State University Press, 1973), 13-45. Keith G. Thomas stresses the eclecticism of "Tintern Abbey" in Wordsworth and Philosophy: Empiricism and Transcendentalism in the Poetry (Ann Arbor: UMI Research Press, 1989), but see pages 78-80 for discussion of the poem's idealist implications. 17Sheats, The Making of Wordsworth's Poetry, 211-12. Before agreeing that the philo- sophic reflections of "Tintern Abbey" announced any distinctive or innovative doctrine, we should probably recall Robert Mayo's contention that "Tintern Abbey is one of the most conventional poems in the whole [Lyrical Ballads] volume," in "The Contempora- neity of the 'Lyrical Ballads,"' PMLA 69 (1954): 493. 18 See Marjorie Levinson's reading of the "doublets" in "Tintern Abbey" in Words- worth's Great Period Poems (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1986), 38-39. While Levinson reads Wordsworth's doublets as a stylistic means of suppressing social refer- ence, I merely borrow her point that, typically, one of the referents in question connotes material and the other immaterial realities. 19 Regarding the pantheist interpretation of "Tintern Abbey," Grob merely states that "the reduction of the metaphysics to this single doctrine" -which he terms "the panvital- istic theory of the 'One Life'"-results in too narrow a focus, . . . substituting a part for the whole in treating Wordsworth's characterization of the physical universe" (The Philo-</page><page sequence="10">William A. Ulmer 313 Coleridge apparently construed "Tintern Abbey" as a pantheist effu- sion. For his i82o castigation of Wordsworth's "vague, misty, rather than mystic, Confusion of God with the World &amp; the accompanying Nature-worship" allusively invokes Wordsworth's description of him- self as "A worshipper of Nature" in 'Tintern Abbey" (152).2 In a later comment on "Tintern Abbey," however, Coleridge attributed a pan- theistic quality merely to "the language, but not the sense or purpose of the great poet of our age"-and the distinction retains a heuris- tic usefulness.2' "Tintern Abbey" reveals Wordsworth returning to the language of the Pedlar poetry, exploring the further potential of an ex- citing poetic idiom. Mediated by the Pedlar materials, the connection of "Tintern Abbey" to the One Life marks an instance of intertextuality within the compass of an individual writer's career, and may reflect a compositional logic rather than a personal conviction. We can actually observe "Tintern Abbey" borrowing the phrasing but not the convic- tions of the Pedlar narrative, when Wordsworth undercuts his descrip- tion of seeing "into the life of things" with the conditional qualification, "If this / Be but a vain belief" (49-50)-a disclaimer which renders his faith in the One Life self-consciously tentative. By leaving its pantheist commitments so uncertain, "Tintern Abbey" manifests the same evidential problem surrounding the poems dis- cussed above. Like them, "Tintern Abbey" can provide only shadowy, secondary illustration of beliefs which must be otherwise established. With scholarship on Wordsworth and the One Life ready to hand, we can always read the celebration of universal harmony in "Tintern Abbey" as a personal variation on the Pedlar's faith. But we hardly need that scholarship to explain the poem. Arguments for Words- worth's 1797-1798 conversion to pantheism could surely never rest on the evidence of "Tintern Abbey" alone. Poetry written for The Ruined Cottage-chiefly Wordsworth's Pedlar narrative and "Not useless do I deem" meditation-has always served as the main exhibit of the case for Wordsworth's belief in the One Life. If we employ even moderately rigorous standards of discrimination, those passages emerge as Words- sophic Mind, 129 n. 3). Thomas believes that Wordsworth's "writing half-compromnises the One Life from the start" (Wordsworth and Philosophy, 23). 20 Collected Letters of Samuel Taylor Coleridge, ed. E. L. Griggs, 6 vols.

When the poet's pantheist claims occur in a single poetic project, in- stead of being distributed among various texts, we need not hypothe- size a phase to explain the statements. We may not be dealing with a discrete period of time in which Wordsworth's certainty of the One Life produced a chronological grouping of interrelated texts. Instead, we may be dealing with a discrete poetic project-the characterization of the Pedlar-which secondarily restricted Wordsworth's affirmations of the One Life to early 1798, because those months happened to com- prise the time spent on revising the Pedlar. The claim that Wordsworth's recourse to the One Life was restricted to the Pedlar material, I noted in beginning, has important implications for the poet's philosophical orientation in 1798. For the moment, how- ever, I would merely emphasize the crucial importance of The Ruined Cottage for his reception of the One Life. The question of Wordsworth's pantheism must be referred to The Ruined Cottage because The Ruined Cottage provided the context in which he dramatized and explored pan- theist ideas. Wordsworth's "conversion" to the One Life was textually mediated and localized. Instead of contemplating a poet first affirm- ing and then distancing himself from One Life ideas, we should reflect upon the movement of certain passages into and out of a particular text-all the more so since, in my judgment, we can plausibly recon- struct the logic of those movements. In using pantheism for The Ruined Cottage, Wordsworth looked to the One Life for a solution to specific moral problems in his poem's narrative situation. In later removing his text's One Life insertions, he reversed himself on the issue of pan- theism's contextual usefulness. The ebb and flow of the One Life into and out of The Ruined Cottage testifies to a failed experiment. Buried in the poem's compositional history lies the detailed history of Words- worth's changing attitude towards the One Life. II. NECESSARY EVILS Critics interested in the philosophical and religious implications of The Ruined Cottage have ordinarily read the poem's later 1798 version as an expression of optimism based on the One Life. The Ruined Cottage read to Coleridge at Racedown in 1797 was a starkly tragic narrative without any final consolation. In early 1798 Wordsworth revised this</page><page sequence="12">William A. Ulmer 315 version to produce The Ruined Cottage MS B, and then wrote an addi- tional 500 lines for it, most of which comprise the Pedlar narrative and the "Not useless do I deem" lines often referred to as the "reconcil- ing addendum." ' These passages contain the pantheist material subse- quently deleted from the text. Oddly, these deletions have rarely been studied in depth as evidence of Wordsworth's dissatisfaction with the One Life. Convinced with Jonathan Wordsworth of the irrelevance of Wordsworth's 1798 Pedlar poetry to the MS D Ruined Cottage of 1799, critics have largely dissociated the question of the poet's pantheism from the poem's compositional history. Instead of comparing MSS B and D of The Ruined Cottage, they have compared MS B with the Goslar poetry of 1798-1799 to measure changes in the poet's philosophical interests. Here too the approach to Wordsworth's intellectual develop- ment follows from the assumption of a Wordsworthian pantheist phase. Sometime in 1798, the prevailing argument has it, Wordsworth out- grew pantheism, and the absence of One Life passages from the 1799 Ruined Cottage simply reflects an antecedent intellectual reorientation. Seen from this perspective, Wordsworth's elimination of the One Life from The Ruined Cottage MS D has been viewed as an incidental consequence of compositional decisions based on other considerations, on Wordsworth's vacillating sense of narrative coherence above all. In expanding his poem in the light of the One Life, Wordsworth also in- creased the role and presence of the narrator. He thereby divided his poem between two foci-making "the story told about the Pedlar ... almost as important as the story he himself tells," in Geoffrey Hart- man's phrase-and then alternately separated and recombined those stories in struggling with the problem of narrative unity.23 But this ex- planation of Wordsworth's revisions poses problems. Wordsworth re- combined the stories of Margaret and the Pedlar (in a conventionally religious form) in Book 1 of The Excursion. The truly enduring change made to the text, then, was not ceding it to Margaret but exorcising the One Life from it. Moreover, critics acknowledge that constructing a consolation based pointedly on the One Life was a primary con- sideration-arguably the leading motive-behind the expansion of The 22 Butler, 'Introduction" to "The Ruined Cottage" and "The Pedlar," 20. My synopsis of the poem's compositional history relies principally on Butler's "Introduction," espe- cially 14-21, but also draws on John Alban Finch's "The Ruined Cottage Restored: Three Stages of Composition," in Bicentenary Wordsworth Studies in Memory of John Alban Finch, ed. Jonathan Wordsworth (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1970), 29-49. 23 Geoffrey H.

If the poem was later recast due to formal con- siderations alone, the same passages were first inserted in the text and then removed from it on utterly (or largely) unrelated grounds. But there is no reason to embrace exclusionary explanations. By no means need Wordsworth's revisions of The Ruined Cottage be ascribed to formal considerations alone.24 Those revisions testify in part to a cri- tique of pantheism born of the attempt to use it poetically. The fact that Wordsworth's 1799 changes to The Ruined Cottage can- cel or drastically minimize its evocation of the One Life brings MS D within the compass of Wordsworth's 1798 intellectual outlook, I sug- gest, despite the MS D text's 1799 date of revision. Insofar as the alter- ations which resulted in 7he Ruined Cottage MS D were undertaken to remove the One Life from it, they were necessarily prompted by re- flections dating back to 1798, the time in which critics locate Words- worth's disenchantment with pantheism. Rewriting The Ruined Cottage sometime between February and December of 1799, Wordsworth pro- duced a version different from any he would have produced in 1798, no doubt. But surely we are justified in correlating the objections to pan- theism underlying Wordsworth's 1798 abandonment of the One Life with the objections to pantheism underlying his 1799 excision of pas- sages about the One Life from The Ruined Cottage MS D. Instead of look- ing to Goslar for a perspective on Wordsworth's growing restiveness with pantheism, I propose a comparative analysis limited to The Ruined Cottage and focused on the MS B and D versions. The absence in MS D of pantheist passages composed for MS B should not be read as evi- dence of a textually ungrounded philosophical reorientation. Whatever their relation to Wordsworth's personal convictions, those absences re- main textually specific reversals signifying the poet's dissatisfaction with particular pantheist themes in their particular poetic contexts. Wordsworth removed the One Life from The Ruined Cottage due prin- cipally to his conviction that pantheism could not realize the purpose motivating its original incorporation in the poem. Apparently, his dis- satisfaction centered on the issue of closure and, consequently, on "Not useless do I deem." Darbishire presented "Not useless" as merely an "Addendum to MS B," which her notes on The Excursion print in a form 24 As Peter J. Manning argued, in "Wordsworth, Margaret, and the Pedlar," SIR 15 (1976): 216. Manning speculates that one likely motive "in Wordsworth's decision to separate the extended portrait of the Pedlar from the story of Margaret was his rec- ognition that despite the asserted consolation of the new ending the barren narrative overshadowed the joy in the One Life declared through the Pedlar" (216).</page><page sequence="14">William A. Ulmer 317 including a version of the Pedlar sequence (P W 5.379-404). These edi- torial decisions tended to make the Pedlar narrative the chief exhibit for Wordsworth's inclusion of material on the One Life in the 1798 Ruined Cottage and to demote "Not useless" to ancillary status-a mere addendum. By providing a reading text of only the shorter, earlier MS B version of The Ruined Cottage, Butler insists on the distinction be- tween the 528-line fair copy of The Ruined Cottage MS B and later draft additions and insertions. Yet he also shows that "Not useless" was in- cluded in a coherent revision of The Ruined Cottage written-even if it never achieved the status of a formally complete poem -in early March of 1798. Citing Dorothy's March 5 letter to Mary Hutchinson and the line tabulation-evidence on MS B 43r, Butler describes a version of The Ruined Cottage conceived as an expansion of his 528-line MS B version?l This 905-line version embodied Wordsworth's first effort to conclhde his poem on a reconciling note-an effort to make the One Life pro- duce an ending in which "the Pedlar, like Wordsworth, could view Margaret's tragedy from a different background and in a wider con- text, since 'in all things / He saw one life, &amp; felt that it was joy."'26 If "Wordsworth never wrote more important lines than these," as Stephen Gill remarks of "Not useless," that reflects their importance for his reconceived resolution of Margaret's story?7 While "the order of composition of the Pedlar expansion and the reconciling adden- dum ... remains doubtful," Butler contends that they must have been written at roughly the same time28-and understandably so, since they represent interdependent parts of a single reconception of the poem. Certainly the optimistic conclusion Wordsworth wrote for his expan- sion of The Ruined Cottage MS B depended crucially on "Not useless." Wordsworth's narrative of the Pedlar's development intellectually pre- supposes "Not useless," which he used to introduce the spear-grass passage, now repositioned at the conclusion. Hence the poem's cele- bratory ending followed directly from "Not useless," which provided the philosophical rationale of the closing cheerfulness, and the Pedlar narrative sketched the religious experiences by which Wordsworth's 25 Butler, "Introduction," 19-20. 26 Ibid., i6. 27 William Wordsworth: A Life (New York: Oxford University Press, 1990), 135. My understanding of "Not useless" relies on the thorough discussion in James H. Averill's Wordsworth and the Poetry of Human Suffering (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1980), 138-43, 125-26; and on Chandler, Wordsworth's Second Nature, 124-30. 28 Butler, "Introduction," 21.</page><page sequence="15">318 Wordsworth and the One Life natural philosopher gained the wisdom his concluding discourse sum- marizes. What then was the particular contribution of "Not useless"? "Not useless do I deem" sets forth a meliorist optimism embracing both Margaret and the men who review her life and death. Here, in Gill's incisive summary, the Pedlar spells out the argument, not as an intuition but as a demonstrable truth, that love of Nature, which demands intense participation in the life of "this majestic imagery, the cloud, / The ocean, and the firmament of heaven," must lead both to a perception of the harmony of all things and to acceptance "of human suf- fering or of human joy." The Pedlar's exhortation to the poet, "no longer read / The forms of things with an unworthy eye," and his concluding words of rec- onciling wisdom do not diminish Margaret's tragedy. By absorbing it into a larger whole the Pedlar enables the poet to pass beyond impotent grief and thus justifies the telling of her story?9 The metaphysics of the One Life offer consolation for Margaret's death by denying that death should prove an occasion for mourning. They make awareness of an eternal spirit immanent in nature-symbolized by the dramatic "stillness" of organic processes, spear-grass studded with raindrops- the basis of belief in an ultimate transcendence of human mutability and finitude. In fact, the human problem of tempo- rality, the pain born "From ruin and from change," ends by seeming almost illusory, "an idle dream" occasioned by the passing "shews" (semblances) of life (The Ruined Cottage, MS D, 521-23). What is real is the One Life, and to that all-healing force Margaret has been assimi- lated by death. The One Life thus justifies the poet's attention to the Pedlar's commentary on the cottage and its former inhabitant. For "Not useless" affirms a moral evolution whereby empathy for inanimate ob- jects- the ruins of a dwelling, the remnants of a garden -promotes an inherently progressive capacity for moral love. Certain problems latent in this pantheistic consolation emerge in the very passage which provides it definitive expression: Thus deeply drinking in the soul of things We shall be wise perforce &amp; we shall move From strict necessity along the path Of order &amp; of good. Whate'er we see Whate'er we feel by agency direct Or indirect shall tend to feed &amp; nurse 29 Gill, William Wordsworth: A Life, 135.</page><page sequence="16">William A. Ulmer 319 Our faculties &amp; raise to loftier heights Our intellectual soul. (RC&amp;P, pp. 271, 275) The moral progression these lines envision will occur "From strict ne- cessity." As Piper notes, Wordsworth's phrase alludes to the doctrine of Necessity central to eighteenth-century materialist pantheism, to God- winian radicalism, and to the philosophical Unitarianism of both Priest- ley and Coleridge-0 Coleridge had described himself to Southey as "a compleat Necessitarian" in 1796, and he retained important Necessi- tarian allegiances at least until 1799. ' In Wordsworth's day the much- discussed idea of Necessity took on different associations in different intellectual contexts. Hartley treated it principally as a law of psycho- logical association. But empirical theories of the One Life stressed the millennial implications of Necessity by elevating it to the motive-force behind events-a "Mother of the World," as Shelley termed it in Queen Mab-and as such it underlies the providential vision of Religious Mus- ings. Wordsworth may have felt a residual attraction to Necessity as an expression of faith in progress, then, after he rejected Hartleyan asso- ciationism as overly mechanistic. Certainly he believed in the idea of Necessity for a time. Whether or not Wordsworth was ever "even to Extravagance a Necessitarian"-as Coleridge described him to Poole in an 1804 letter (CLSTC 2:1037) - "Not useless do I deem" sufficiently indicates his commitment to the idea. If the attractions of Coleridgean pantheism included a joyful optimism confident of moral progress, the One Life, for Wordsworth, included a Necessitarian faith. Unfortunately, "the problem which such a system raises," Piper points out, "is that of the existence of evil," and with it the related 30 Piper, The Active Universe, 120. 31 Coleridge's ii December 1794 letter (CLSTC 1:137). While Coleridge expressed passing reservations about Necessity well before 1797-1798, his final break with the idea may have come as late as 18o0, at which time he claimed to have "overthrown. . . the doctrine of Necessity" in his 16 March 1i8o letter to Thomas Poole (CLSTC 2:706). I as- sume Coleridge's allegiance to Necessity until at least 1799 on the authority of Lewis Patton and Peter Mann, who conclude that "by 1799 [Coleridge's] disenchantment with the doctrine of necessity was virtually complete," in their introduction to Lectures 1795 on Politics and Religion, ed. Lewis Patton and Peter Mann The Collected Works of Samuel Tay- lor Coleridge, gen. ed. Kathleen Coburn, 16 vols. (Princeton: Princeton University Press, 1971), 1 :lxvi. For Necessity as the causal principle of events, an ontological or historical rather than merely psychological principle, see the discussion in Piper, The Active Uni- verse, 22-27; and Kenneth Neill Cameron, The Young Shelley: Genesis of a Radical (New York: MacMillan, 1950), 272-73.</page><page sequence="17">320 Wordsworth and the One Life question of moral responsibility.32 Because they understood events as predetermined reflexes of a benevolent power, strict Necessitarians admitted no guilt: "Guilt is out of the Question," Coleridge informed Thelwall; "I am a Necessarian, and of course deny the possibility of it" (CLSTC 1:213). Wordsworth's decision to provide The Ruined Cottage a pantheist reconciliation meant providing Necessitarian assurances that all partial evil was universal good. He tried with "Not useless" and re- tracted it, I argue, because his effort produced results he finally deemed morally unsatisfying. If we are to ascribe Wordsworth's deletions of the One Life from The Ruined Cottage partly to philosophical considerations, we must read his withdrawal of "Not useless" as a disavowal of the Necessitarian reflections central to the passage. Wordsworth's removal of "Not useless" records his conviction that a Necessitarian pantheism could not adequately justify Margaret's slow descent to death. The meliorist argument of "Not useless" encourages acceptance of Mar- garet's suffering and death as vehicles of the One Life's plastic stress- instances of an encompassing moral order progressively assimilating human restlessness to its own nature. I suggest that Wordsworth ulti- mately could not regard such assimilation as sufficient recompense for individual human suffering and for the annihilation of the individual human personality in death. In demoting the moral importance of individual suffering and death, the concept of Necessity opened 7he Ruined Cottage to questions funda- mental to the eighteenth-century reception of Spinozistic pantheism. Enlightenment debates over Spinozism inevitably addressed the com- peting claims of self-premised and world-premised philosophical sys- tems. "As the hypothetically complete form of 'it is' thinking," Thomas McFarland remarks, pantheism "wages mortal war with the sense of 'I am.' "33 In the eighteenth century that war included campaigns against traditional anthropomorphic ideas of God as well as traditional ideas of human identity and morality, as McFarland summarily notes: Spinozism, with all its logical and emotional rightness ... involved, as we have seen, a dreadful set of corollaries, that not only subverted orthodox religion but struck at the very roots of man's emotional sense of self. For if God is imma- 32 Piper, The Active Universe, 46. `3 Thomas McFarland, Coleridge and the Pantheist Tradition (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1969), 88. Because Spinoza provided pantheism its most comprehensive and incisive con- ceptualization, his system and its critical legacy reflect problems latent in Coleridgean pantheism despite both Priestley's and Coleridge's dissociation of their views from Spi- noza's.</page><page sequence="18">William A. Ulmer 321 nent (causa immanens) in the world, rather than transcendent (causa transiens) or essentially separate from the world, man will have no personal identity, but will only be a finite mode of the world-substance that Spinoza calls God.... The corollary of pantheism would be the destruction of man's freedom and man's responsibility; for if everything is God all responsibility must be God's; there can be no right or wrong, for both right and wrong would be equally aspects of God.... And finally, there would be no Christian eschatology of a personal life after death, for at death man would merely be reabsorbed by the world-substance.34 If "the great Romantic philosophical controversy over pantheism" in- volved, "in its ethical and eschatological implications, a struggle be- tween Spinoza and Christianity," that derived from the democratic individualism of Christianity, its insistence on the moral value of indi- vidual lives and souls0 The allness of pantheism tends to devalue individuality and, in consequence, to render individual pain and death nearly meaningless from a cosmic perspective. The determinism im- plicit in pantheistic Necessity reduces human action to similar mean- inglessness, undermining traditional ethical standards. Wordsworthians will hardly need to be reminded that objections to a pantheistic moral perspective have recurred in the critical reception of The Ruined Cottage. Commenting on the "Not useless" conclusion of the expanded version of MS B, Edward Bostetter argued that Wordsworth, by denying the necessity of actively intervening in human suffering, "in effect repudiated the story as he ... told it."36 Questioning the rationale of the Pedlar's closing cheerfulness, Cleanth Brooks found one explana- tion in the idea that 'Margaret with her sorrows is simply one detail of an all-encompassing and harmonious pattern"-and then added, "One shrinks from concluding that such an interpretation as this is Words- worth's own."37 Bostetter and Brooks direct their objections to a conso- latory logic they recognize as pantheistic. But other critical objections 34 Ibid., 87-88. 3 Ibid., 53. 36 Edward E. Bostetter, The Romantic Ventriloquists (Seattle: University of Washington Press, 1963), 65. Bostetter's comments are especially instructive because they pointedly address "Not useless"; but see Averill's summary of critical dissatisfaction with the con- clusion of The Ruined Cottage (Wordsworth and the Poetry of Human Suffering, 55-56). 37 Cleanth Brooks, 'Wordsworth and Human Suffering: Notes on Two Early Poems," in From Sensibility to Romanticism, ed. Frederick W. Hilles and Harold Bloom (New York: Oxford University Press, 1965), 385 and 386. Brooks implicitly concedes the pantheis- tic quality of the Pedlar's consoling vision-which he considers powerfully religious but not Christian-when he observes that "even in the text of 7he Excursion in i850 the earlier, more pantheistic notions are still present" (385).</page><page sequence="19">322 Wordsworth and the One Life can be similarly construed as rejections of pantheism. In the MS D ver- sion of The Ruined Cottage, the Pedlar's references to "natural wisdom" and "natural comfort," his fancy that Margaret's spring feels sadness at her absence, his closing account of Margaret assimilated to a serenely harmonious natural order-all these touches and more bequeath the shortened Ruined Cottage of 1799 a holistic natural perspective power- fully pantheistic in mood. Critics decline a displaced but uneradicated pantheism whenever they find Margaret's decline into death and the Pedlar's contented detachment incongruous. The spectulation that Wordsworth, like so many critics, felt ultimately unconvinced by his poem's pantheistic conclusion seems plausible on several grounds. Certainly the compositional history of The Ruined Cot- tage reveals a progressive diminishment of the Pedlar's effectiveness as an advocate for the One Life. In Wordsworth's first two attempts to de- velop his poem's conclusion beyond the stark statement of Margaret's death, he stressed the Pedlar's tutelary authority: "I [the Poet] lookd and looked again [at the scene], &amp; to myself / I seemed a better and a wiser man"; "And for the tale which you have told I think / I am a better and a wiser man" (RC&amp;P, pp. 257, 259). In the "Not useless" addendum upon which he settled as an ending for his expansion of The Ruined Cot- tage MS B, Wordsworth again emphasized successful moral instruction: The old man ceased The words he uttered shall not pass away They had sunk into me, but not as sounds To be expressed by visible characters For while he spake my spirit had obeyed The presence of his eye, my ear had drunk The meanings of his voice. He had discoursed Like one who in the slow &amp; silent works The manifold conclusions of his thought, Had brooded till Imagination's power Condensed them to a passion whence she drew Herself, new energies, resistless force. (RC&amp;P, p. 275) As Wordsworth's diction makes clear, this passage presents the Pedlar's discourse as a formal incarnation of the Necessitarian energy he ex- perienced as a youth and has just finished describing. His words reg- ister with his auditor not as "sounds / To be expressed by visible char- acters" precisely because they illustrate a sympathy "with things that hold / An articulate language"; the Poet drinks the Pedlar's meanings</page><page sequence="20">William A. Ulmer 323 much as the Pedlar's "spirit drank / The spectacle" of the rising sun ex- perienced as a "visitation from the living God"; the Pedlar's language suggests an imaginatively intensifying brooding just as, in his child- hood reflections on natural images, he "Intensely brooded, even till they acquired / The liveliness of dreams" (RC&amp;P, pp. 261, 157, 153); his discourses assume the "new energies, resistless force" which Words- worth mentions in concluding, because his words embody the resist- less betterment ordained "From strict necessity." This narrative power and moral authority does not forestall mourn- ing gestures on the part of the Poet of the "Not useless" conclusion: Yet still towards the cottage did I turn Fondly, &amp; trace with nearer interest That secret spirit of humanity Which 'mid the calm oblivious tendencies Of Nature, 'mid her plants, her weeds &amp; flowers, And silent overgrowings still survived. (RC&amp;P, pp. 275, 277) But here the Pedlar resumes talking after line 1i6, quickly reclaiming the Poet from his elegiac nostalgia. In The Ruined Cottage MS D, con- versely, the Pedlar's skill in narration goes entirely unpraised, and the Narrator's recalcitrant sorrow over Margaret expands to thirteen lines: From that low Bench, rising instinctively, I turned aside in weakness, nor had the power To thank him for the tale which he had told. I stood, and leaning o'er the garden-gate Reviewed that Woman's suff'rings, and it seemed To comfort me while with a brother's love I blessed her in the impotence of grief. Atlength [ I the 1 I Fondly, and traced with milder interest That secret spirit of humanity Which, 'mid the calm oblivious tendencies Of nature, 'mid her plants, her weeds, and flowers, And silent overgrowings, still survived. (494-506) Here MS D shows the Poet turning as a brother to mourn for Mar- garet, his "nearer interest" transformed into a "grief" he cannot dis- claim despite knowing its impotence. The changes are hardly dramatic but, again, they occur in conjunction with Wordsworth's deletion of the praise accorded the Pedlar at the end of the "Not useless" adden-</page><page sequence="21">324 Wordsworth and the One Life dum. Moving from the expanded version of MS B to MS D, we see the Pedlar's prestige as a pedagogue declining and the Poet's need to mourn Margaret's death given greater development and pathos. Re- sponding to various states of the text, many critics have sensed an in- complete commitment to the Wanderer's viewpoint in Wordsworth's story of Margaret. If "the pathos of Margaret's blind but heroic self- destruction, recorded in the narrator's own voice, persists to argue the limitations of [the wanderer's] wisdom," as Reeve Parker contends,38 then that persistence gains in strength as we move from Wordsworth's projected expansion of The Ruined Cottage MS B, to the MS D version, and on to Book 1 of The Excursion. The inference that Wordsworth came to share his critics' reserva- tions about the pantheistic consolation of The Ruined Cottage remains an inference. But it also explains other changes made in both "Not use- less" and The Ruined Cottage MS D. When "not useless" appeared in Book 4 of The Excursion in 1814, it appeared in a variant form indicating Wordsworth's specific rejection of Necessitarian determinism. Com- pare the first four lines of the "Not useless" passage cited above with this Excursion passage: Thus deeply drinking-in the soul of things, We shall be wise perforce; and, while inspired By choice, and conscious that the Will is free, Shall move unswerving, even as if impelled By strict necessity, along the path Of order and of good. (4.1265-70) Wordsworth's emphasis on freely willed choice and relegation of ne- cessity's causal power to a conditional analogy ("as if impelled by strict necessity"') remove the specific notion of pantheistic Necessity from the 3 Reeve Parker, "'Finer Distance': The Narrative Art of Wordsworth's 'The Wan- derer,'" ELH 39 (1972): 110. Sheats also insists on the poem's differentiation of the Pedlar's and poet-narrator's viewpoints and reads that differentiation as a compensa- tion for "the paradoxical inhumanity of the pedlar's optimism" (Sheats, The Making of Wordsworth's Poetry, i8o). In modern academic criticism, the differentiation of Pedlar and poet-narrator, now frequently noticed, was first stressed by F. R. Leavis, in Revaluation (London: Chatto &amp; Windus, 1936), 179-80. Some critics, let me add, notice the Pedlar's own susceptibility to grief and interpret it as evidence of his philosophy's inadequate power of consolation. But the Pedlar's grief was present in Wordsworth's projected ex- pansion of The Ruined Cottage MS B-the version of the poem predicated on One Life optimism-and arose probably as an effort to increase his moral authority by making him appear humanely sympathetic.</page><page sequence="22">William A. Ulmer 325 Wanderer's speech, which no longer envisions a predetermined moral progress.39 On a similar note, Wordsworth's dissatisfaction with death conceived as assimilation to an immanent Universal mind explains changes he made in the 1799 Ruined Cottage. There, he not only deleted "Not useless" and the Pedlar narrative but inserted these reflections: my spirit clings To that poor woman: so familiarly Do I perceive her manner, and her look And presence, and so deeply do I feel Her goodness, that not seldom in my walks A momentary trance comes over me; And to myself I seem to muse on one By sorrow laid asleep or borne away, A human being destined to awake To human life, or something very near To human life, when he shall come again For whom she suffered. (364-75) "The associations of suffering and a second coming might seem to be Christian," Jonathan Wordsworth writes, even as James Averill credits the Pedlar with here "calling up a version of Christian immortality," and Susan J. Wolfson remarks that Wordsworth's "phrasing glimmers with a Christian promise." 40 Jonathan Wordsworth and Averill are right to caution that this passage hardly represents a Christian affirmation; Wolfson is similarly right in noting that the Pedlar's momentary trance "scarcely contains [his] recognition of its illusory nature."4 Yet all three critics read responsively in sensing the Christian palimpsest in these lines. In its generality, the passage avoids lies by professing nothing; it makes no claims and obligates Wordsworth to no dogmas. But it com- plicates any residual pantheism in the text with its Christian associa- tions. These additions to the 1799 text complemented Wordsworth's exci- sion of "Not Useless" and helped to pry The Ruined Cottage away from the pantheist doctrines on which the newfound optimism of its 1798 conclusion had originally been predicated. After Wordsworth com- 39 Helen Darbishire observes the modifying addition of free will to the idea of Neces- sity in this passage, in The Poet Wordsworth (Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1950), 163. 40 Jonathan Wordsworth, The Music of Humanity, 138; Averill, Wordsworth and the Poetry of Human Suffering, 133; Wolfson, The Questioning Presence: Wordsworth, Keats, and the In- terrogative Mode in Romantic Poetry (Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1986), 1o8. 41 Wolfson, The Questioning Presence, io8.</page><page sequence="23">326 Wordsworth and the One Life mitted himself to an optimistic ending for The Ruined Cottage in early 1798, he never looked back. Through all subsequent revisions, culmi- nating in Book 1 of The Excursion, he remained committed to a rec- onciling ending. For The Excursion, he placed "Not useless" in Book 4 and kept a revised and suitably Christianized version of the Pedlar narrative in Book 1. For the 1799 MS D version of The Ruined Cottage, however, he relied merely on the motif of morally educative storytell- ing and on a philosophically vague mood of closing serenity to carry the poem's optimism. Seeking to have it both ways, Wordsworth tried to preserve the emotional resolution projected for the expanded MS B text while deleting the philosophical understructure on which that resolution had originally been based -and critics have questioned the rationale of the Pedlar's elegiac serenity ever since. III. WORDSWORTH AND THE ONE LIFE To this point I have argued, first, that Wordsworth's affirmations of the One Life occur only in The Ruined Cottage and in Pedlar passages associated with it, and, second, that the compositional history of The Ruined Cottaige suggests that the poet's reservations about the One Life centered on the idea of pantheistic Necessity. In closing, I want to dis- cuss one additional implication of Wordsworth's restriction of the One Life to his Ruined Cottage project: the implication that his dedication to pantheism was always limited and tentative. Wordsworth's interest in the One Life seems entirely clear. Such inter- est just as clearly implies at least a selective and conditional assent. My reconstruction of Wordsworth's motives for writing pantheism into The Ruined Cottage, and for subsequently writing it out, presupposes absolutely his personal investment in the ideas at stake. Poets usually want their poems to be intellectually convincing and consult their own responses as indices to the prospective responses of readers. If Words- worth removed "Not useless" from The Ruined Cottage due to personal dissatisfaction with pantheist theory, he surely added it to begin with because he found Coleridgean pantheism credible and compelling. The question before us, however, is how compelling he found it. For with the One Life, as Jonathan Wordsworth allows, it is "not so much the fact as the quality of Wordsworth's belief that had such far-reaching effects and implications."42 Did Wordsworth joyfully accept the existence of an immanent, universal mind as a certain truth? Wordsworth's belief 42 Jonathan Wordsworth, "Wordsworth's Borderers," 176.</page><page sequence="24">William A. Ulmer 327 in the One Life has been directly challenged in only one commentary known to me: some passing remarks by James Averill in a 1982 re- view.43 Averill's skepticism seems eminently justified nonetheless. The case for Wordsworth's commitment to the One Life has always relied on two strategies: reading the vaguely pantheistic sentiments of some six poems as references to a particular, highly defined form of pan- theism, and reading the Pedlar as a surrogate Wordsworth. When we restrict Wordsworth's affirmations of the One Life to his Ruined Cottage materials, that case rests entirely with the Pedlar. It is consequently no coincidence that Averill's doubts about Wordsworth's pantheism come accompanied by criticism of the "tendency to treat the Pedlar as equivalent to the historical Wordsworth."" No one denies that Wordsworth depicts "his own development through the figure of the Pedlar."4 But, clearly, Wordsworth and his fic- tional self-projection cannot be categorically identified. Their mutual resemblance Wordsworth himself stressed: in his Fenwick note to The Excursion he declared of the Pedlar, "I am here called upon freely to ac- knowledge that the character I have represented in his person is chiefly an idea of what I fancied my own character might have become in his circumstances" (PW 5.373). Yet the need to qualify identifications of Wordsworth and the Pedlar emerges in this very note. For if Words- worth declares the Pedlar a projection of himself, he also mentions the Pedlar's lower social class and limited formal education. We should recognize the compounded qualifications of Wordsworth's statement that the Pedlar is chiefly a dramatization of how he, Wordsworth, might have grown up in the Pedlar's circumstances. We should then read on and note Wordsworth's accounts of James Patrick and the Hawkshead Packman as additional, and additionally complicating, Pedlar proto- types. Even with The Excursion, the later text to which Wordsworth's Fenwick statement in fact pertains, one cannot simply take the Wan- derer as Wordsworth's spokesman. Hazlitt justly observed that several characters in the poem act as authorial personae." Addressing the com- 43 Review of John A. Hodgson's Wordsworth's Philosophical Poetry, 1797-1814 and Charles Sherry's Wordsworth's Poetry of the Imagination, in JEGP 81 (1982): 119. Noting that "Hodgson follows Jonathan Wordsworth in hypothesizing the poet's enthusiastic conversion to the One Life," Averill grants that "probably Wordsworth would have liked to believe in the One Life" before adding, "certainly he talked a good deal on the subject, but that is not the same thing as actual belief." 44 Ibid. 45 Richard E. Matlack's phrase, from "Classical Argument and Romantic Persuasion in 'Tintern Abbey,'" SIR 25 (1986): 107. 46"Even the dialogues introduced in the present volume are soliloquies of the same</page><page sequence="25">328 Wordsworth and the One Life plaint that The Excursion failed to distinguish "between nature as the work of God and God himself," Wordsworth was similarly justified in stressing "the dramatic propriety" of one of the poem's ostensibly pantheistic passages-for, dramatic situation aside, he was justified in insisting on the Wanderer as a dramatic character.4' Reading Wordsworth's Fenwick note carefully, we must approach the Pedlar as a construct with a distanced, complexly mediated rela- tion to the irrecoverable ground of the poet's "own" experience. The Prelude itself sanctions no other approach. Noting that Wordsworth's struggles with The Ruined Cottage "produced a Pedlar sequence which is, in fact, the poet's first autobiographical work," Butler observes in consequence that "it is not surprising that feelings here attributed to the Pedlar were later transferred to The Prelude"-to The Prelude, that is, construed as personal revelation on an epic scale.4 But Wordsworth's relocation of Pedlar materials to The Prelude-he was equally prepared to place them in The Excursion -cannot by itself establish the status of the Pedlar poetry as a transcription of Wordsworth's own convictions. Relocations of that sort cut both ways as evidence. After all, The Pre- lude retrospectively restructures certain events in Wordsworth's life and provides accounts of others that cannot be independently veri- fied. Remarking that "many scholars have expressed great difficulty in locating in Wordsworth's mid-twenties a crisis of precisely the same description as the one we find in The Prelude," Chandler points out that the organizing crisis of Wordsworth's crisis autobiography may itself be an after-the-fact Burkean reconstruction.49 The fact that the Pedlar poetry and The Prelude once shared lines in common can, depending on one's perspective, alternately nudge the Pedlar closer to fact or The Prelude closer to fiction. The Pedlar, in short, cannot independently establish Wordsworth's own faith in the One Life. Actually, if we consider the evidence that could conceivably exist-testimony of acquaintances, statements made in the poet's letters, assertions of outright belief in several poems-we character, taking different views of the subject," Hazlitt quipped, adding that "the re- cluse, the pastor, and the pedlar are three persons in one poet," in "On Mr Wordsworth's Excursion," in 7he Complete Works of William Hazlitt, Centenary Edition, ed.

Ulmer 329 should notice how little evidence supports the case for Wordsworth's certainty of the One Life. The poet remained a pantheist convert, sup- posedly, for nearly a year at least. Despite the distractions of practical affairs and other poetic endeavors, why, if he accepted Coleridgean pantheism so enthusiastically, don't we have more poems which un- ambiguously proclaim the truth of the One Life? The fact that such proclamations occur in The Ruined Cottage alone bespeaks a limited sympathy for pantheism. Certainly Wordsworth could have undergone an impassioned pantheist conversion at a time when The Ruined Cot- tage was occupying him to the virtual exclusion of other projects. He could have employed The Ruined Cottage as his sole outlet for celebrat- ing the One Life. But surely his affirmation of the One Life only in the Pedlar additions to The Ruined Cottage strongly implies that the One Life served him more as a text-specific construction than a personal creed. When Coleridge arrived at Racedown in 1797, Wordsworth had been working on The Borderers as well as The Ruined Cottage, and was grappling with problems of dramatic and narrative characterization. His decision to recast The Ruined Cottage demanded a recasting of the Pedlar, who needed a history to explain his newfound wisdom, and who consequently became one of the poet's main character studies: a rustic visionary accorded a sense of prophetic election at certain reve- latory moments, and then left to draw the moral lesson of those mo- ments without much exposure to intellectual culture beyond Milton and the Bible. How would such a man conceptualize his experiences? Wordsworth's answer to that question was the One Life, the phi- losophy of a particular fictional character and the texts he inhabits. In developing that answer, the poet could test and clarify ideas through the displacements of story. If his difference from the Pedlar "was no doubt helpful in allowing Wordsworth to draw on his own experience at this trial stage without risking the charge of self-aggrandizement," as Chandler observes,50 the converse is also true: the figure of the Pedlar freed Wordsworth from "his own experience" and allowed him imagi- native exploration without the obligations of belief. Wordsworth's re- spect for complexity made him cautious about philosophical systems. The Wordsworthian visionary experiences with the most pronounced affinities to the One Life do not settle easily into certainty. I remarked above that the description of seeing "into the Life of things" in "Tintern Abbey" relents to the tentative "If this be but a vain belief" (49-50). In 50 Ibid., 96.</page><page sequence="27">330 Wordsworth and the One Life the two-part Prelude, the assertion, "in all things / I saw one life, and felt that it was joy," gives way to similar doubts: "If this be error, and another faith / Find easier access to the pious mind" (2.459-60, 465- 66). When speaking of himself, Wordsworth speaks typically of times when his intimation of a divine presence in nature intensified into the perception of consciousness in ostensibly inanimate objects: "the life of things," "in all things." With the lapsing of such moments, he professes gratitude for their redemptive influence but doubts about their cogni- tive validity. This dual response arose from his belief, as Gene W. Ruoff argues, that the intuitions born of imaginative or mystical experience must be referred to other faculties, to complementary rational and in- stitutional standards, to establish their truth.5' The Pedlar's mystical experiences largely determine both his life and beliefs: at the site of Margaret's cottage he expounds upon ideas bequeathed him by his first encounters with the universal harmony. Those moments of pantheistic communion may represent a consider- able heightening of any similar moments in Wordsworth's experiences -and we hear nothing of them, significantly, until the Pedlar narrative is composed. I suggest that Wordsworth's acceptance of the One Life remained provisional even during March 1798. Such tentative accep- tance would explain his distancing of the Poet from the Pedlar- the Poet's "Yet still towards the cottage did I turn"-in the lines following "Not useless do I deem" at the conclusion of the pantheistic expansion of The Ruined Cottage MS B. The speculation that the notion of the One Life satisfied him incompletely even as he incorporated it into his nar- rative, or that he grew restive with it shortly thereafter, would also ex- plain why no fair copy of the expanded Ruined Cottage MS B was ever made.52 Despite the press of business, Wordsworth could have had his 5l Gene W. Ruoff, "Religious Implications of Wordsworth's Imagination," SIR 12 (1973): 688-89. 52 Here we should note that Coleridge's 13 March letter offering the poem to Cottle (CLSTC 1:399-400) does not establish Wordsworth's belief that The Ruined Cottage had reached the form of a completed "poem" in March 1798. The letter establishes merely the poet's confidence that a finished product could be dispatched soon enough if Cottle proved interested. Coleridge's letter offers Cottle Osorio and The Borderers "to be deliv- ered to you within a week of the date of your answer to this letter" or "Wordsworth's Salisbury Plain &amp; Tale of a Woman [The Ruined Cottage] . . . to be delivered to you within 3 weeks of the date of your answer" (CLSTC 1:400). This discrepancy in delivery time suggests Wordsworth's conviction of the unreadiness of one or perhaps both texts. He certainly deemed "Salisbury Plain" unfinished; his 9 May 1798 letter to Cottle refers to his determination "to finish it" (Letters, vol. 1: The Early Years, 1787-1805, ed. De Selin- court, 2nd ed. rev. by Chester L. Shaver [Oxford: Clarendon Press, 1967], 218), but he</page><page sequence="28">William A. Ulmer 331 latest version of The Ruined Cottage transcribed as a fair copy during or shortly after March 1798. Any residual dissatisfaction he may have felt with his revised text would surely have involved the Pedlar addi- tions, and in part the philosophy they introduced into the text. Even in early 1798, Wordsworth's recourse to the One Life may reflect less an outright conversion to the Pedlar's viewpoint than his writerly will- ingness, in Gill's phrase, "to take whatever philosophical formulations seemed to help" 53-and the absence of a fair copy his prompt realiza- tion that the formulations taken had solved some problems only by creating others, and that the text needed further work. Critics commonly agree that Wordsworth's early years reveal him celebrating a spirituality seemingly immanent in nature, while his later years increasingly reveal him looking beyond nature for spiritual con- solation. I object neither to this view nor to its implication of the early Wordsworth's "pantheistic" sensibility. It remains true, however, that Wordsworth wrote "a poetry that is guided to its objects by feeling, and not by the methods of systematic exposition."54 It also remains true that only a certain "systematic exposition" can distinguish the phi- losophy of the One Life from the fanciful "pantheism" prevalent in the cultural idiom of the day. Nowhere does Wordsworth's poetry display his sympathy with pantheism evolving into his own certain conviction of the truth of the One Life. In fact, Wordsworth's struggles with the ending of The Ruined Cottage indicate his humanistic awareness, even in 1798, that oneness with nature was no unequivocal good. University of Alabama may have felt that The Ruined Cottage also needed at least some further attention.
