This interesting memoir by Claparede was published on the occasion of the jubilee celebrating the three hundred and fiftieth anniversary of the founding of the University of Geneva. The debt which philosophy and science owe to Charles Bonnet (Geneva, 1720-1793) is by no means small. " His name figures in the history of philosophy beside those of Condillac and Hartley, whose contemporary he</page><page sequence="2">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 609 was, and with whose doctrines his ' Analytical Essay on the Faculties of the Soul' is analogous. Psychological works mention him as one of the first authors who held a physiological theory of memory, recognition, and attention. Zoologists recognize him for his observations on the insects and the worms, their reproduction and regeneration, and especially for his discovery of parthenogenesis. Biologists still cite his theory of the encasement (emboitement) of germs; and for his 'scale of beings,' they count him among the precursors of transformism. The botanists have not forgotten his researches, still classic, on the functions of leaves, and finally psychiaters are indebted to him for the first detailed observation of a case of conscious hallucination," now called pseudo-hallucination. " In justice physiologists should also recognize him as the author of the theory of the specific energy of nerves." Bonnet had a predilection for the study of insects, which term in- cluded spiders, worms, and polyps in his time. Curiously enough, this study led him to the pursuit of psychology and even of metaphysics. At the age of sixteen, this interest in the insects was kindled by his reading the " Story of Formica Leo " in a popular book. " I felt at the moment," he says, " a sensation which I can compare only to that which Malebranche experienced in reading the 'Traite de l'homme' of Descartes. I did not read the book. I devoured it." Besides observing some of the most inter- esting behavior of ants, bees, worms, caterpillars, and spiders, he discov- ered parthenogenesis in plant-lice and made experiments on regeneration in annelids. While Bonnet, in the spirit of the Cartesian philosophy, criticizes the naYve anthropomorphism so often employed in the interpretation of animal activities, and, instead, would ascribe their " industries " to some mechan- ism within the organism, yet he believes that animals have mind (and, in the "Palingenesis " at least, that animals possess a soul in essence like that of man). The analogy between our organization and that of the higher animals makes this probable, and if it is probable that the higher animals have mind, it is probable that all animals have it. Other reasons adduced in support of this opinion are: (1) while the animals are incapable of reflection, properly speaking, yet they "judge" in the sense that they feel the difference between sensations, and act in consequence of this feeling; (2) there is disproportion between stimulus and reaction (this argument is cited with some hesitation); (3) that the animals vary their procedure according to circumstances is one of the strongest argu- ments against the opinion which transforms them into pure machines, and (4) that beings are continuous, as described by Leibnitz, is a strong the- oretical reason for the presence of mind in animals. In his study of instinct the Geneva philosopher exhibited three tenden- cies: a tendency against finalism and anthropomorphism, a tendency to employ the simplest and most economical explanations possible, and finally, an attempt to render an account of behavior in terms of the structure of the body. The perfection of instinct in young animals is due, he main- tained, not to innate ideas, but to innate fibers in the brain. The animal</page><page sequence="3">610 THE JOURNAL OF PHILOSOPHY has a certain kind of life " because that kind of life is the necessary result of its structure." So Claparede remarks that if, in Bonnet's statement, we replace the word fiber by " fibrilla," or by " constellation of neurones," we have the contemporary formula for the organic foundation of instinct. The stimulus or " motive cause " which acts on the nervous system of the animal is the pleasure experienced in satisfying a need. This pleasure is the " voice of nature," a subjective fact which depends on the mind, and it intervenes in the most stereotyped acts of animals. Yet the mind has not the virtue of a first cause. The impulse which the soul gives to the body is itself strictly determined by the organism. Pleasure is founded on need, need on the machine or organism. " The author of nature has subordinated the activity of the soul to its sensibility, its sensibility to the play of fibers, the play of fibers to the action of objects." Although Bonnet does not use the phrase " adaptation to novel cir- cumstances," the fact of such adaptation on the part of animals leads him to reject the doctrine of automatism and to affirm that "there is in the animal an immaterial substance which receives impressions of sense and acts in consequence of these impressions." Thus the soul is twice invoked, first to establish agreement between need and representation, and again to establish agreement between representation and act. In keeping the phe- nomenal union of unitary consciousness and organism, he could not purify his psychology from metaphysical blemish. "In spite of his desire to explain everything by the fibers of the brain, Bonnet met, on his way, the soul to which it was necessary to give a role." On the other hand, he felt himself incapable of rendering an account, by means of simple mechanism, of the agreement between act and need; his intellectual loyalty prevented him from affirming what he could not conceive clearly. Yet in giving the soul only the limited role of a coordinate agent and in constantly submit- ting its verdicts to determinations of the body, he has shown himself, thinks Claparede, the valiant champion of psycho-physiological positivism. The Geneva philosopher denies to animals any trace of maternal love or insight into the result of the several acts of fostering and feeding the young. These acts are all due to the pleasurable sensations which the mother derives fromn them. Claparede shows that originally the comparison of human and animal faculties had for its object the justification or refutation of some meta- physical or theological opinion. It was Bonnet who inaugurated the mod- ern conception. He was the first to admit the community of nature of the human and animal mind. This done, it remained only to point out the differences between the two. The chief difference Bonnet finds in the absence in animals of the ability to form abstract notions and to gen- eralize. " The beasts can have only particular and purely sensible ideas -do not reason. They have not our mediating ideas because they have not our signs." Locke had already taken this position, and Leibnitz had proclaimed that " knowledge of necessary and eternal truths is what dis- tinguishes us from the animals." In 1741 Bonnet began repeating, on annelids, the curious observations</page><page sequence="4">PSYCHOLOGY AND SCIENTIFIC METHODS 611 of Trembly on regeneration in the fresh-water hydra. lHe observed with much interest the production of two or three perfect worms from one by cutting it into parts. At once the question suggested itself, "Where, then, is located the mind of the worm? or is it merely a machine? " The latter view, thought Bonnet, would free us from many difficulties, but would lead us into others equally serious. He preferred, therefore, to face the difficulties with which the experiments confronted him. Philosophy declared the mind to be simple. It could not, then, be divided by the scalpel; yet philosophy was not ready to deny mind, or feeling of some sort, to regenerated polyps and worms. The result was long discussions of the uncertainty of our knowledge in metaphysics. " Before trying to discover how detached parts of the worm acquire a mind, we must first discover how they acquire a head and brain." This leads Bonnet to a theory of which present biological theories are little more than a develop- ment. Along the whole length of the animal's body are scattered germs in each of which preexists the whole body of the animal. But if these germs contain all the essential parts of the animal, they contain the mind. It is not philosophical to believe that God sends a mind into the germ only when it has developed to a certain point. When the brain can trans- mit impressions from the outer world, the mind can manifest its presence. Before that time, the organs being " without functions," the soul is " with- out ideas." Bonnet thus reduced the special problem of the rebirth of mental life in regenerated pieces to the general question of the genesis of mind in individuals. In one of his later works the Geneva philosopher almost anticipates the modern doctrine of stereotropism, but, with rare wisdom, he finally concludes that this is not the explanation which seems preferable. " In the mind of Bonnet, then, there met and battled with each other the two tend- encies, psychological and physiological, which divide biologists into two warring camps to-day." Our author's chief work is his "Essai analytique sur les facultes de l'ame." His memoir on plant-lice brought him, at twenty years of age, the title of corresponding member of the Paris Academy of Sciences, and later he was made a member of the Berlin Academy. The brilliant discussions of Claparede grace every page of his memoir and kindle the reader's interest in the thought aroused by early biology which now, after Kant's interruption of it, makes steady progress once more.
