INTRODUCTION During the period of greatest public concern for environmental protection, the late 1960's and early 1970's, pollution control and development constraint seemed to be the paramount issues. Natural area preservation and the protection of endangered species, the major concern of older conservation organizations, such as the National Audubon Society, was considered to be a relatively minor aspect of a broader problem. Conservation was too narrow a theme for a move- ment which gave the word "environment" a new meaning. At the present time however, there are signs of a return to the older concern of conservationists, the preservation of natural diversi- ty. This has been stimulated by the rpali7ation that, despite recent governmental and public attention to the problem of environmental protection, an increasing number of areas important for their natural values have been modified and degraded; recent studies have shown that not only are many higher species of birds and mammals on the verge of extinction, but one-tenth of certain lower animal species as well as one-tenth of North American plant species are presently endangered.l It has been proposed2 that action be taken to identify and protect natural areas representing the full range of biological communities, ecosystems, habitat and natural features of the United States. The purpose of such an effort would be to ensure the survival of natural diversity, to preserve endangered and threatened species * Professor of Law, University of North Carolina.

A parallel development is occurring on the international level. The Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program of UNESCO3 was established to create a world-wide system of "biosphere reserves," permanently protected areas chosen as representatives of biomes, their major subdivisions and transition zones, in order to preserve genetic diversity and to provide areas for environmental research and educa- tion.4 Twenty-nine nations have agreed to participate in this pro- gram, including the United States, which has formally designated twenty "biosphere reserves."5 The Soviet Union, which has experienced the same types of environmental problems that have affected western countries,6 has 3.

Despite the fact that art. 14 of the USSR Constitution declares all natural resources, lands, waters, minerals and forests to be the property of the state, incapable of private ownership and exploitation, the Soviet Union has experienced environmental problems caused by increased urbanization, industrialization and development of natural resources. Many of the rivers of the European part of the Soviet Union are polluted; vast water diversion projects have altered the ecological character of the Lower Volga and ad- versely affected the water levels of the Caspian Sea and the Aral Sea; pollu- tion of Lake Baikal, the largest body of fresh water in the world, has been a source of controversy in the Soviet Union, and its ultimate fate is still undecided. See generally Goldman, The Spoils of Progress: Environmental Pollution in the Soviet Union (1972). However, the Soviet Union has also participated in the concern evident in recent years for protection of the envi- ronment. New laws dealing with most aspects of the problem have been promulgated. The centerpiece of recent legislative activity is Decree 898 of 29 December 1972, jointly issued by the Central Committee of the Communist Party and the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R. Decree No. 898 of 29 Decem- ber 1972, On the Reenforcement of Nature and the Better Use of Natural Resources, No. 2, p. 19 [1973] Sob. post. S.S.S.R. (Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R.) [hereafter cited as Decree 898]. Soviet writers refer to it as a "comprehensive program of action." Kolbasov, Priroda pod ochranoy za- kona (Nature Under the Protection of the Law) 20 (1975) [hereafter cited as Kolbasov]. This decree admits past neglect of environmental protection and attempts to state general policies relating to all aspects of environmental quality, allocating jurisdictional responsibility for carrying out these policies to the appropriate union and republic-level ministries, departments and or- ganizations. Since this law attempts to integrate environmental considerations with economic planning (Gosplan is ordered to form a department of environ- mental protection), to set a national environmental policy and to confer juris- diction for environmental protection on all important developmental agencies and groups in the Soviet Union, it may be considered as roughly analogous to the National Environmental Policy Act in the United States. The Soviet Union has also recently enacted legislation regarding the use of particular resources. A comprehensive decree setting a national land use policy and elaborating principles of land use was issued in 1968. Law of 13 Dec. 1968, 522 [Vol. 24</page><page sequence="3">also exhibited concern for the establishment of a national system of natural areas. This is important because, as Professor A. Dan Tar- lock stated in a recent article,7 although problems of pollution of shared resources have long been matters of international concern, a nation's land use policies have been regarded as outside the scope of international cooperation. Yet the need for cooperation exists be- cause the destruction of physical and biological wonders such as Lake Baikal in central Asia or the Serengeti Plain in Africa may be a concern of many nations; moreover, large scale development projects may adversely affect the global environment. In addition to being important in itself, the fact that two nations with radically different political and economic systems, like the United States and the Soviet Union, have independently developed institutions for the protection of natural areas, presents an opportunity for international cooperation and a degree of hope for a minimal consensus between sovereign states regarding land use policy. II. MAJOR AREAS WlrrtnAWN FROM EXPLOITATION IN THE USSR Under the 1968 Land Legislation,8 the lands of the Soviet Union are divided into six different primary use designations: agricultural lands,9 settlement lands,10 lands occupied by industry, transportation, Fundamental Land Legislation of the U.S.S.R. and the Soviet Republics, No. 51, p. 48 [1968] Ved. Verkh. Sov. S.S.S.R. (Supreme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.). [hereafter cited as Fundamental Land Legislation]. A new law regulating water use and controlling water pollution was passed in 1970, and air pollu- tion legislation dates from 1969.

(Su- preme Soviet of the U.S.S.R.). In addition, pursuant to the order of the Coun- cil of Ministers of the U.S.S.R., all fifteen Soviet republics have issued conser- vation decrees dealing with the preservation of certain lands and waters and conservation practices to be employed in the use of lands, waters and forests. The decrees of the fifteen republics are almost identical. For the text of the decree of the Russian Federation, see Law of 27 Oct. 1960, On the Protec- tion of Nature in the Russian Federation, No. 40, p. 586 [1960] Ved. Verkh. Sov. RSFSR (Supreme Soviet of the Russian Federation) [hereafter cited as Nature Conservation Law of the Russian Federation]. Whether these new laws and decrees are effective is, of course, another matter; it can be con- cluded however that, despite their differing political and economic systems, decision-makers in the United States and Soviet Union face analogous prob- lems of environmental protection. 7.

State Forest Reserve Over one-half of the area of the Soviet Union is nominally designated as the State Forest Reserve. A significant portion of these lands (170 million hectares) are officially categorized as "group-one" forests that are withdrawn from commercial timber production.'6 These forests comprise lands in the populous areas of European Russia, areas along highways and waterways as well as extensive tracts bordering on the tundra.17 Many of these areas are open to recreation, and cutting or disturbance of trees is allowed only for the removal of diseased and dead trees, fire protection, forest regenera- tion and improvement.'8 No mechanism exists under Soviet law, however, to assure the permanence of group-one forests. They are under the jurisdiction of the State Committee of Forest Management, whose task is assuring the fulfillment of the economic plans for timber production.19 Par- ticular areas of group-one forest lands may easily be administratively reassigned to categories allowing exploitation. Moreover, Soviet wri- ters have criticized the forest management practices that are applied 11. This is a miscellaneous category of special purpose lands. 12. This category includes not only forested land but also lands designated for forestry use. Fundamental Land Legislation, supra n. 6, art. 43. 13. These Lands include submerged lands as well as those areas used for water resources projects. Fundamental Land Legislation, supra n. 6, art. 44. 14.

No English term is adequate to translate the Russian word zapovednik. Its literal meaning is "forbidden area." However, "ecological reserve" seems to be the emerging English term and this will be used here. 16. Soviet forests are divided into three groups or categories. Group I forests are not to be used for commercial harvesting of timber. Group II forests are designated open to commercial cutting, but the annual cut in any given tract must not exceed the annual forest growth. Group III forests are open to intensive timber harvesting.

Green Belt Areas Land surrounding major cities in the Soviet Union, to a radius of up to fifty kilometers22 in the case of the largest city, Moscow, is officially designated as the suburban and green belt zone.23 In practice, however, these lands are used for transportation corridors, recreational facilities and small, satellite towns. Each district of the urban area is given responsibility and funding to set up a recreational area within this zone, and permission can be given for the construc- tion of private "dachas."24 The forested area that exists within these areas is apparently managed according to group-one specifications,25 and some lands cannot be entered except along certain prescribed paths.26 According to Soviet authorities, expansion of the urban area into such zones can occur only through the process of annexing parts of these zones into the city itself and thus will occur only as required by the growth of population.27 C. Nature Reserves and Natural Monuments Nature reserves and natural monuments are categories of pre- serve land given protected status under Article 40 of the 1968 Land Legislation Act;28 there is no clear legal distinction between the two 20.

Responsi- bility for maintaining the areas is left to local executive committees or is delegated to other local organizations, such as collective and state farms, cities or scientific organizations.31 Each individual area has its own rules of management, but, in general, economic activity that would impair the natural condition of the monument is prohibited.32 Many nature reserves are administered as hunting areas, however.33 Some natural monuments and nature reserves are established for the permanent preservation of an area, while many afford protection for a shorter period, usually ten years, merely to allow the restoration of a particular stock of birds or animals.34 The numbers of reserves and natural monuments thus fluctuates widely, but the total land area given protected status may be substantial. According to one Soviet writer, the Lithuanian Soviet Republic, for instance, contains 91 nature reserves totaling over 320,000 acres, as well as over 600 natural monuments.35 These areas are elassified according to the primary object of protection, as botanical, geological, lake and zoo- logical reserves.36 D. National Parks The creation of a national park system is still in its infancy in the Soviet Union. There is as yet no legislation on the union level, although Soviet authorities express the hope that this defect will be corrected by newly proposed legislation regulating natural areas in the Soviet Union.37 In the 1970's, however, under the authority of a 1921 decree,38 three national parks were created in the Baltic repub- 29: Natural monuments are usually smaller in area than nature reserves, sometimes consisting merely of individual trees or rock formations. 30.

Several more are planned, including a controversial national park at Lake Baikal.39 The influence of American practice is readily apparent in the emerging Soviet national park system. It is founded on the dual purposes of supplying human recreational needs and nature protec- tion. According to Soviet writers, national parks in the U.S.S.R. are divided into differing use zones, and hunting and fishing are allowed in certain areas; there are hotels, restaurants and tourist facilities, and auto traffic is allowed along prescribed roadways.40 Lands around the parks are restricted as to use to provide a buffer zone for the protection of the park.41 Under the auspices of the US-USSR Envi- ronmental Protection Agreement,42 Soviet authorities are presently studying American experience with the administration of the national park system, apparently in order to gain ideas for possible implemen- tation in the U.S.S.R. E. Ecological Reserves Ecological reserves are the most important type of Soviet pro- tected areas under section 40 of the 1968 Land Legislation Act.43 This institution has no real counterpart in American law. Soviet ecological reserves are, at least in principle, areas completely with- drawn from economic exploitations and dedicated to scientific re- search on the functioning of ecological systems. A permanent scien- tific staff is assigned the task of collecting data concerning geological, hydrological and other physical processes as well as monitoring flora and wildlife resources as they exist in their natural state. According to Soviet authorities, such reserves are being established in all the differing biomes and ecological zones of the Soviet Union in order to preserve "standards of nature" for various ecological types.44 These are intended to function as ecological baseline areas against which the influence of human activity in unprotected areas of the same original ecological character can be compared in order to establish and define Monuments, Gardens and Parks."

For an account of the Lake Baikal controversy see Goldman, supra n. 6 at 178-209; see also Pryde, supra n. 16 at 63, 147-150. Whether the plans of some Soviet scientists for the creation of an extensive national park system in the Soviet Union will be realized is highly questionable. The national parks designated in the Baltic Republics seem to be only a concession to the demands of these peoples for cultural autonomy. A projected national park for the "Russian Forest" area south of Moscow has been indefinitely delayed. 40.

Only very minor differences exist between the laws of the various union-republics, however, since the current republic-level legislation was passed pursuant to a 1961 order of the Council of Ministers of the U.S.S.R.60 Impetus for the crea- tion of a reserve usually comes from influential scientific groups such as the Academy of Sciences on the union or union-republic levels; very little role is played by the public or conservation organizations.51 Formal application is made to the Council of Ministers at the union- republic level, who are designated by law as having the authority to decree the establishment of an ecological reserve; in fact, however, approval must be obtained from both Gosplan, which is in charge of economic planning on the union level, as well as from the Ministry of Agriculture of the U.S.S.R.52 Once established, Soviet ecological reserves are under the juris- 45.

In some republics, such as the Russian Socialist Federated Socialist Republic and Geor- gia, they are under the Council of Ministers; in others such as Latvia, Estonia and Kazakh S.S.R., they are within the Committee on Forest- ry; in still other republics (Azerbaidjan), they are under a Committee for Nature Protection.53 In addition, there are fourteen union-level ecological reserves run by the Ministry of Agriculture of the U.S.S.R.,54 and many in Siberia are under the Soviet Academy of Sciences. Altogether, about twenty different departments are respon- sible for administering the national system of ecological reserves in fifteen different republics. This has created a serious problem of coordination of research efforts, despite the fact that the Central Laboratory on Nature Conservation and the U.S.S.R. Ministry of Agriculture exercise oversight functions.55 The present number of ecological reserves in the Soviet Union totals 110 covering about 7.5 million hectares, or 0.3 percent of the area of the country.56 In the last five years, thirteen new reserves protecting 500,000 hectares have been created, and about forty addi- tional reserves are planned.57 Soviet administrators distinguish two principal types of ecological reserves. First, about forty reserves are wilderness tracts never significantly altered by man. Here the em- phasis is apparently on ecological baseline studies. Second, some reserves are islands of restored natural environments surrounded by agricultural and urban lands. These are established to provide a stock of wildlife and genetic material to enrich the surrounding areas and to provide a place of refuge for native plants and animals.58 Although some ecological reserves have their own individual regulations, general rules apply to all such areas. Hunting, fishing, economic and commercial activity are forbidden. Tourism, when permitted, is limited to specified zones.59 On the other hand, fire prevention methods and control of plant diseases through the limited application of pesticides are permitted. Tree-cutting for forest regen- eration and for maintenance is allowed in certain zones of forested ecological reserves.60 The taking of animals, birds and plants is permitted in order to regulate overpopulation and for scientific pur- poses;61 moreover, many areas have stringently controlled predators, especially wolves.62 53.

Administration of a Wilderness Ecological Reserve: Caucasus The Caucasus Ecological Reserve is one of the largest natural areas in the Soviet Union. It includes about 266,000 hectares of land, much of which is virgin wilderness, and it is surrounded by a buffer zone of about 50,000 hectares; it is thus an example of a type- one, wilderness reserve. The major area of the Caucasus reserve sprawls across the northern Caucasus mountain region near the Black Sea resort cities of Sochi, Gagra and Pitsunda. Encompassing a varied area of river valleys and glacier-covered mountain peaks, it preserves the diverse fauna and flora of a mountain area that serves as the transition between the sub-tropical climate of the Black Sea coast and the continental area to the north.63 The reserve is under the direct administration of the Department of Nature Protection, Reserves and Hunting of the Ministry of Agri- culture of the U.S.S.R., although the legal authority for its establish- ment and administration is the republic-level law on ecological re- serves of the Russian Federation.64 Despite the fact that it is thus nominally under the administration of a republic-level agency, in practice both long and short-term scientific research plans are pre- pared according to guidelines set at the union level, and the plans themselves must be approved by the union-level agency.65 This direct supervision and the fact that the reserve itself is a union-level state agency appear to be major reasons for the fact that it is a showpiece of the Soviet reserve system. A director and a scientific council are in charge of the over-all administration of the reserve. According to the director, the work of the reserve is divided among six separate divisions: (1) a Bookkeep- ing Office to keep the accounts, (2) an Office of Buffer Zones to supervise hunting and other activities permitted in the buffer areas established to protect the reserve from human activity, (3) a Forest Protection Section, whose seventy rangers enforce reserve regulations, (4) an Internal Economics Office, which repairs reserve facilities, (5) an Office of Experimental Economic Activity, which sells souve- nirs and operates tourist facilities, and (6) a Scientific Office con- sisting of twenty scientists of different fields who conduct and super- vise the scientific research work of the reserve. All the divisions except the Office of Experimental Economic Activity receive annual operating funds from the state.66 The work of the scientific staff of the preserve consists of extensive field work, laboratory work67 and the writing of scientific 63. The Russian name of the reserve is Kavkaz zapovednik. 64. Krinitsky Interview, supra n. 37. 65. Interview with A. I.

According to the director, monitoring stations have been established throughout the reserve in order to inventory, classify and monitor the flora and fauna of the reserve as well as to study the ecological interrelationship of different species. The physical proper- ties of the reserve such as the hydrology, meteorology, air quality and soil properties are extensively monitored also. The optimum popu- lation level of certain higher animals is scientifically determined, and the numbers of some, such as wolves and hoofed animals, are kept within the population limits determined.68 The reserve is a refuge and a center for research on several endangered species, such as the European Bison,69 and scientific studies are made of the impact of man on different ecosystems as well as of the restoration and increase of the biological productivity of natural complexes. Much of the scientific work seems to have direct economic application, such as studies of the optimum conditions for the growing of certain types of trees.70 According to the director, the reserve also has a very important tourist and educational function, and, because of its location near the Black Sea resort cities, it is one of the most visited Soviet ecological reserves, accommodating 500,000 visitors yearly. Tourists and visi- tors are carefully confined to specific areas, however. About 80 percent of the visitors come to a noncontiguous 300 hectare portion of the reserve situated close to the Black Sea coast. Excursions are encouraged to the Khosta Grove, a stand of unusually rich Caucasus mountain vegetation, including oak, beech, boxwood and yew trees that are stated to be several hundred years old; here a visitor center, zoo, nature trails, the reserve headquarters and scientific laboratories are located.7" A second road has been built into the reserve to the top of Mount Akhun, the highest point along the Black Sea coast, where commercial facilities for visitors have been constructed.72 In the major portion of the reserve, which lies about 50 miles inland, two extensive unpaved roads have been designated as open to hikers: the one, about 125 miles in length, bisects the reserve from northeast to southwest; and the other covers about 40 miles in the northern section of the reserve. Visitors here, as in the other sections 68. Id. There may be a changing attitude in the Soviet Union toward predators and especially wolves. In 1971, Professor Pryde, supra n. 16 at 60, reported an effort to exterminate wolves in Soviet reserves. The Director of the Caucasus Ecological Reserve reports, however, that Soviet authorities now recognize the necessity to protect wolves and other predators within some reserves. but believe that it is necessary to scientifically control their numbers. 69.

This attempt was blocked through the efforts of the Academy of Sciences and the All Russian Society for the Protection of Nature, but it was decided to put the road through the northern section of the reserve following the route of the second open hiking road. An increase in commercial facilities for visitors is expected to result from this decision.74 The reserve is thus apparent- ly without any significant protection from administrative actions by development-oriented ministries that can affect its resources. 2. Administration of a Restored-Environment Reserve: Voronezh The Voronezh Ecological Reserve is situated in the center of the European part of the Soviet Union about 400 miles south of Moscow. It preserves a 31,000 hectare island of the original fauna and flora of this region, which is now almost completely devoted to agricultural, industrial and commercial activity. Several extremely rich forest ecosystems are represented, including, according to reserve officials, some 133 species of trees and shrubs, 900 species of plants, 187 types of birds and 54 species of mammals including elk, deer, moose, wild pig and beaver.75 In contrast to the Caucasus Ecologicial Reserve, Voronezh is too small to serve as a "standard of nature," a virgin wilderness area relatively free from outside influences. Instead, it is designed to be a refuge for animals and plants that would otherwise totally disappear because of the influence of man. It is also a reservoir of natural systems from which wildlife can spread out to populate existing suitable habitat in the surrounding area. In some instances, especial- ly as to beaver and deer, the work of the reserve is to reintroduce certain species of wildlife to former parts of their range where they have been eliminated. Populations of many animals are heavily managed, and wolves have been completely exterminated because of the proximity of the reserve to settled areas.76 The scientific research of the reserve centers on beaver propaga- tion. According to reserve scientists, a carefully managed popula- 73. Id. Despite the existence of large buffer zones where only hunting and some commercial logging is permitted, some parts of the reserve appear to be adversely affected by industrial activity. The river that forms the boundary of the Khosta grove appears to be highly polluted by sedimentation that perhaps has its source in the operations of a quarry located on the oppo- site bank of the river. The noise emanating from the quarry operations can be heard in many parts of the Khosta grove. Observations by the author, 9 July 1975. 74. Barabanshchikov Interview, supra n. 65. 75.

Other divisions of the reserve conduct research on the relationship between forest soils and forest productivity, mammalian diseases, the biological con- trol of insect pests and techniques for the temporary immobilization of animals. A staff of fourteen scientists is permanently assigned to the reserve.78 The natural systems of the Voronezh reserve, despite their rich- ness, are adversely affected by the fact that there is no buffer zone surrounding the reserve. Although no pesticides have ever been used on the reserve, they are extensively used on the surrounding agricul- tural areas. Water pollution that has its source outside the reserve is a problem. According to the reserve director, about 30,000 tourists are accommodated each year; they are encouraged to visit a museum and nature center, the beaver farm and three short trails along which group tours can be conducted, but they are not allowed in other areas of the reserve.79 The rules of the reserve are enforced by fifty forest rangers. Although the use regulations are substantially identical to the norms contained in the Russian Federation law,80 special rules allow hay- cutting in certain areas as well as other activities, such as harvesting wild fruits and berries.81 IIL A CRITIQUE OF THE SOVIET ECOLOGICAL RESERVE SYSTEM The Soviet Ecological Reserve System has advanced the cause of environmental protection in the U.S.S.R. This institution has been successful not only in protecting rich samples of the natural diversity of the U.S.S.R., including many endangered and rare species, but also in generating most of the wildlife and ecological research being done in that country. The importance of preserving natural diversity is recognized as an important goal apart from the need to provide for human recreational needs. On the other hand, there are many problems in the administra- tion of the reserve system. A principal defect is the multiplicity of bureaucracies in charge of their administration. Furthermore, direct control of the reserves is vested in republic-level agencies, such as forestry committees, whose main task is the fulfillment of economic 77. The experimental beaver farm has a capacity of about 100 beaver. Interview with N. Lavrova, Head of Beaver Laboratory, Voronezh Reserve, at the reserve on 14 July 1975. 78.

This has resulted in two further problems: pres- ervation and research is often sacrificed to timber and agricultural production, hunting and fishing interests;83 there is great pressure for research to have direct application to increased timber production or exploitation of resources.84 In addition, research is often uncoordi- nated and Soviet writers complain of non-standardized and conflict- ing methodologies, classification systems and nomenclature.85 Difficulties have also been experienced in the creation of new ecological reserves as well as in assuring their permanent status. The process of creating new reserves is unregulated by law,86 and the key authorization is needed from two union-level agencies concerned almost completely with economic production, Gosplan and the Minis- try of Agriculture.87 Thus the realization of proposals to protect large, additional tracts representative of all the ecosystems of the U.S.S.R. has been an extremely slow process. In addition, under the present system there seems to be no real impediment to simple administrative abolition of ecological reserves or radical changes in their boundaries. In both 1951 and 1961, large numbers of reserves were simply abolished.88 There is no legal requirement for the permanent maintenance of ecological reserves, and the lack of a ministry for environmental protection in the Soviet Union means that there is no powerful administrative arm that can resist the economic planners' designs on the resources of particular areas. Another problem stems from the fact that the legal norms and rules governing zapovedniki are very vague and often difficult to enforce. There is no union-level legislation, and the republic-level laws merely restrict certain activities, such as tree cutting, hunting, fishing and economic activity, and allow the administrators of individ- 82.

For example, the law of the Latvian Union Republic states that abolition or changes in status of ecological reserves is up to the discretion of the Latvian Council of Ministers. Decree No. 826 of 29 Dec. 1961, On State Ecological Reserves, No. 6 art. 30 [1962] Ved. Verkh. Sov. i Prav. LSSR (Supreme Soviet of the Latvian Socialist Republic). Soviet scholars claim, however, that the abolition of reserves is now impossible be- cause of increased awareness by governmental authorities of the necessity of environmental piotetion.

[Vol. 24 534</page><page sequence="15">ual reserves and the relevant supervisory state committee the freedom to make exceptions to the general norms and standards.89 This leads to wide variations in the management of reserves that are subject to the same legal standards. For example, while most reserves do not provide tourist facilities, some accommodate hundreds of thousands of tourists per year and operate as "de facto" national parks.90 Moreover, the programs to eliminate wolves and other predators in Soviet Reserves are inconsistent with the legal requirement that the natural ecosystems be undisturbed by man. Reserves are also insuffi- ciently protected from outside influences that may infringe on the protected environment.91 The law provides for the maintenance of buffer zones and reserves but does not define either their extent or the permissible activity within such buffer zones.92 In addition, difficul- ties of enforcement of the standards and rules of reserves have been encountered because present law merely subjects the violator to sanc- tions under the general laws against unauthorized hunting, fishing and felling of trees.93 In the case of violation of a standard particular to a reserve that is not applicable in territories outside reserves, there is no enforcement mechanism.94 According to Soviet authorities, efforts are underway to correct some of these defects. A new proposed union-level law is being discussed that is an attempt to provide a comprehensive regulatory structure and legal basis for all types of Soviet natural areas.96 The final shape of this legislation is unclear, but several areas of reform are being discussed. First, a new agency would be created on the union level that would act as a supervisory authority for Soviet natu- ral areas and especially for ecological reserves. Soviet administrators consider it essential that this agency be independent of and, if possi- ble, superior to the ministries concerned with economic exploitation of particular resources, but it would still be subordinate to Gosplan, the economic planning agency.96 The new agency would have wide powers to coordinate the wildlife research activities of ecological reserves, and a specific process would be provided for the creation of new reserves as well as for the addition to the system of areas representing all the different ecological zones of the Soviet Union.97 Second, although day-to-day administration would remain in the republic-level agencies, the union-level law would provide a legal framework for the different categories of Soviet natural areas, an 89.

IV. NATURAL AREA Pn;SBMVATION IN THE U.S.A. In the United States there are many federal and state agencies whose programs involve natural area preservation. On the federal level, the most important agencies having such responsibilities are the National Park Service, Fish and Wildlife Service, Forest Service, and the Bureau of Land Management. All these agencies, however, have management reponsibilities that go considerably beyond and are sometimes inconsistent with the preservation of ecological diversity. The Forest Service and the Bureau of Land Management together administer about 87 percent'02 of the extensive landholdings of the federal government under a multiple-use system103 that includes wat- ershed and timber production,104 outdoor recreation and grazing,105 as well as industrial development and mineral production.106 The Fish and Wildlife Service in the Department of the Interior manages the National Wildlife Refuge System,'07 but this program was estab- lished principally to protect migratory wildfowl, game animals and 98.

The organic act under which the Forest Service in the Department of Agriculture operates is the Multiple-Use, Sustained-Yield Act of 1960, 16 U.S.C. ??528-31 (1970); The Bureau of Land Management's organic act, the Classification and Multiple-Use Act of 1964, 43 U.S.C. ?? 1411-18 (1970), has expired according to its terms, 43 U.S.C. ??1394(b), 1418, but the Department of the Interior has ruled that the secretary's authority under this act continues indefinitely with respect to multiple-use management until Congress passes new organic legislation. Multiple-Use is defined as "the management of all the various surface and subsurface resources so that they are utilized in the combination that will best meet the present and future needs of the American people. . ." 43 U.S.C. ?1415(b) (1970) [Bureau of Land Management]. A sim- ilar definition applies to lands managed by the Forest Service. 16 U.S.C. ?531 (1970).

The National Park System, which is administered by the National Park Service, emphasizes public recrea- tion in addition to the preservation of natural areas.108 Because of the rpali.ation that no one federal agency presently exercises jurisdiction over natural area preservation, an inter-agency group, the Federal Committee on Ecological Reserves,109 has been established to coordinate the development of a system of research natural areas cutting across the jurisdictional lines of different govern- mental agencies. They are encouraged to identify and give special protection to areas that qualify under the definition of natural areas.110 Almost all the natural area designations have thus been made administratively under several different agency programs. The Bu- reau of Land Management, under the aegis of multiple-use, has established an Outstanding Natural Areas Program1ll and a Primitive Areas Program.112 The Forest Service formally designates and pro- tects Special Interest Areas, which are lands within their jurisdiction having special scenic, paleontological, geological, botanical or zoolog- ical value.l13 The National Park Service has administratively elassi- fied 74 of its 287 areas as natural areas.ll4 In 1962, a National Natural Landmarks Program was established to encourage the preser- vation of sites illustrating the nation's geological and ecological char- acter and having education and scientific value.15 The Forest Service, Fish and Wildlife Service and the Bureau of Land Management have all designated areas under this program,ll" and landowners are 108. 16 U.S.C. ?1 (1970).

This committee was established in July 1974 by the Chairman of the Council on Environmental Quality to develop a national system of ecological reserves. Fifth Annual Report of the Council on Environmental Quality 204 (1974). It is the successor to the Federal Committee on Research Natural areas, which worked for the establishment of restricted-use natural areas and by 1968 had influenced seven federal agencies to establish 336 research natural areas. See The Preservation of Natural Diversity: A Survey and Recommen- dations 114-115 (The Nature Conservancy 1975). 110. The committee adopted the following definition of research natural areas: A physical or biological unit where natural conditions are main- tained insofar as possible and which is reserved for the primary pur- pose of research and education. These conditions are achieved by allowing ordinary physical and biological processes to operate without human intervention. However, under specific circumstances, on cer- tain areas, deliberate manipulation intended to maintain the unique factors that the Research Natural Area was established.

The need for a system of natural areas that ensures the preserva- tion of the physical and ecological processes of diverse regions of the United States has thus been recognized, but it is a largely uncoordi- nated effort by many different federal and state agencies. Moreover, the agencies involved are primarily concerned with other natural resource problems, and the creation and preservation of natural areas is a subordinate activity. Furthermore, there is no recognized set of minimal requirements or standards for natural areas, and the protec- tion afforded designated areas is primarily administrative.'20 117.

For a survey of such state laws see Preservation of Natural Diversity, supra n. 109 at Appendix 2. 120. The National Wilderness Preservation System, which was created by the Wilderness Act of 1964, 16 U.S.C. ?1131 et seq. (1970), might be viewed by some as creating a statutory basis for a national system of natural areas, but upon closer analysis, this conception fails. Although this act has resulted in the statutory designation of areas previously designated as "wild," "wilder- ness," or "canoe" by the Forest Service [16 U.S.C. ?1132(a) (1970)], certain roadless areas (after study of the National Park and National Wildlife Refuge systems [16 U.S.C. ?1132(c) (1970)] as well as important "eastern wilderness" areas [16 U.S.C. ?1132 (Supp. No. 1, 1975)], there are important limitations to this system as a basis for the preservation of a national system of natural areas. First, the primary concern of such a system is for the survival of "wil- derness," not ecological diversity. The concept of "wilderness" is, in the last analysis, a relatively subjective, anthropomorphic statement of a certain mood or feeling. See Robinson, 'Wilderness: The Last Frontier," 59 Minn. L. Rev. 1, 2-5, 28 (1974). Second, the statutory definition of wilderness ensures that this system embodies a very restrictive type of natural area. In order to qualify, an area must not only contain ecological or other features of value but also must afford "outstanding opportunities for solitude or a primitive and unconfined type of recreation . . ." and have "at least five thousand acres of land or [be] of sufficient size to make practicable its preservation and use in an unimpaired condition. . . ." 16 U.S.C. ?1131 (c) (1970). Therefore, these areas are established primarily to serve the need for a certain type of recreational activity, not in order to preserve natural diversity. Further- more, the administration of wilderness areas has been accompanied by a con- troversy over how "pure"-free from other uses-a wilderness area must be kept. In Izaak Walton League of America v. St. Clair, 353 F. Supp. 698 (D. Minn. 1973), a court held mining to be incompatible with wilderness preserva- tion, despite the provision of the Wilderness Act that permits such activity until 1984. This was reversed on appeal, 497 F.2d 849 (8th Cir. 1974), cert. den. 419 U.S. 1009 (1974). This points up the fact that the National Wilderness Preservation System is too narrow and restrictive to be the basis for a national system of ecological reserves. Since the effort in the latter system would be the preservation of ecological diversity and not the provision of a certain type of experience for users, such areas could be managed to allow economic and other activities that would be inconsistent with a wilderness area. 538 [Vol. 24</page><page sequence="19">The Nature Conservancy121 has proposed that new federal legis- lation be enacted to remedy these problems. This would involve (1) the establishment of a nationwide system of Ecological Reserves, the nucleus of which would consist of portions of existing natural area programs with no management transfer, (2) the possibility of addi- tions to the system through the creation of an ecological classification system, an inventory program, a registry and minimum protection requirements, (3) the establishment of a National Ecological Reserve Board, a scientific advisory board and an ecological data bank and (4) encouragement for states to establish counterpart reserve boards and systems to be incorporated into the national system. The formal creation of a system of ecological reserves in the United States would serve three important functions. First, it would provide the necessary legal basis for the preservation of the range of natural processes and biotic diversity of the United States. Second, a national system of ecological reserves would serve as a focus for research, monitoring and education about the functioning of ecosys- tems and natural processes. At present, such research is carried on in limited and uncoordinated fashion by a variety of federal agencies, universities and professional societies. It is largely unavailable to aid in the solution of particular environmental problems.122 Third, the creation of such a system in the United States would further interna- tional cooperation with other nations that are participating in the Man and the Biosphere (MAB) Program of UNESCO with the objective of creating a world-wide system of "biosphere reserves" and minimum national standards relating to natural preservation. V. CONCLUSION International cooperation to protect the global environment should go beyond mere concern with shared resources and should include cooperation regarding national land use policies. Exchange of information and coordination of national policies regarding the preservation of natural areas would appear to be the point of depar- ture for such an effort since analogous institutions have independently developed in two countries with radically different political and eco- nomic systems, the United States and the Soviet Union. The strengthening of such institutions in both countries would not only further important national goals in each country but would, as a by- product, increase the likelihood of cooperation on the international level. 121.
