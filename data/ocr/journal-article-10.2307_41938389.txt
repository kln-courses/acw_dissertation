<plain_text><page sequence="1">MICHAEL TIMKO * Browning upon Butler; or, Natural Theology in the English Isle Browning's " Caliban upon Setebos; or, Natural Theology in the Island " has always invited commentary, but in general the poem has not evoked much discussion. Considered one of Browning's " re- ligious " poems, it has most often been taken as a satiric condemnation of Calvinism or Darwinism or the Higher Criticism or any combina- tion of the three. More recently, however, there has been a new note struck, a tendency to deny the satiric nature of the poem. In fact, a recent essay by John Howard states bluntly: " That 4 Caliban ' is satire at all is, in the first place, questionable and in support of this position goes on to demonstrate that Caliban is a primitive subhuman who contemplates God the only way that he can. " Thus the poem, far from being a satire, is a picture of the belief of a creature, lower than man, understanding the Deity, as best he can understand. . . , The poem is part of Browning's way of showing that God reveals to each creature only what he is capable of understanding." 1 The con- clusion, then, is that Caliban's gropings, no matter how limited, are good. There are a number of implications in this last view that need further exploration, for to have Browning sympathetic with Caliban instantly raises a number of questions about Browning's own religious attitude. If, for instance, we say that Browning sees Caliban's limited gropings as good, we are making a judgment of Browning's own concept of both the nature of God and of how God reveals that nature to man. It is nowhere evident in Browning's poetry that he would regard favor- ably any picture of God that would leave out His loving nature; yet, as Howard himself states, the one essential element which Caliban cannot deduce about God is His loving nature. To say, then, that Caliban's gropings are good, even though his picture of God is erron- eous, is puzzling, if not meaningless, for Browning's belief in the glory of the imperfect was based on his faith in a loving God in Whose * Assistant Professor of English at Queens College, Michael Timko has written on Victorian literary figures.

To Browning, with his "exclusive stress on love," the god of Caliban would indeed be a strange one, as would the method by which Caliban comes to know this god.2 The fact is that, from what we can see of Browning's dependence on feeling rather than reason, Caliban's god would be limited precisely because his gropings, his method of coming to know that god, are limited. The God one comes to know is closely connected to the way one comes to know Him, and, to Browning, there is only one way to come to know God. It is not even a matter of Caliban's " lower nature " or his place in the evolutionary scale, and there is nothing to show that the poem is necessarily directly con- cerned with Darwinism; as Professor Fairchild says, there is no very compelling reason to suppose that it was.8 Caliban simply is represen- tative of one who fails to approach God in the right way. He lacks the emotional response necessary for the direct, intuitional knowledge of the God of Love. He is, in short, a rationalist; he believes in natural theology. It is surprising that the subtitle of the poem has been so consistenly ignored, for it provides what would seem to be the best explanation for Browning's purpose in writing the poem and it points out his specific targets. Not only does it reveal Caliban's own point of view insofar as it is concerned with " theology," but it also connects this point of view to two of its most famous exponents, Bishop Joseph Butler and Archdeacon William Paley, whose works The Analogy of Religion , Natural and Revealed and Natural Theology represented the clearest and strongest statement of the orthodox church in this particu- lar area of theological concern.4 "Caliban upon Setebos," then, is important as a poem representing Browning's ideas on the dangers of too much dependence on intellect and reason in matters of faith, a 2 For Browning's "exclusive stress on love," see especially W.

In many ways, "Caliban" is a key work in the canon of Browning's " religious " poetry, for it brings into focus this whole matter of the sharp distinction that he made between reason and faith and his scepti- cal view of human knowledge. It is the clearest exposition of his "emotional gnosticism." (Raymond, p. 131) To see Caliban only as a primitive subhuman is to take the poem much too literally; Caliban is a spokesman, and a very shrewd one, for what many would consider a highly developed intellectual point of view. Lily Bess Campbell, in speaking of Caliban, states that he repre- sents " the rugged nature of every soul, and reveals the depths which are never completely civilized, never completely conventionalized." Browning, however, is using Caliban in exactly the opposite way, as one who is presenting a highly conventional, orthodox view of the- ology, one supported and advocated by such staunch churchmen as Butler and Paley. As another critic has said of Caliban: " casual and shallow from first to last, . . . yet his speculations have a quaint resemblance to more dignified theories that we have heard of." 5 Caliban, for all his primitive attributes, employs the methods of the rational empiricists, and to the extent that he does favor reason and the inductive method he stands for the rational, scientific approach to problems, an approach far from " primitive." More specifically, with his insistence on drawing logical conclusions from his natural sur- roundings, his approach may be seen as the prototype of that used by Butler and Paley, whose entire outlook was directed by the Baconian approach to religious matters. Far from being a "subhuman" in- capable of improvement, Caliban represents on purely rational grounds the highest level at which one could hope to " defend " religious belief; and Browning is demonstrating in the poem not the dangers of Cal- vinism or Darwinism or the Higher Criticism, all of which were evi- dent to any intelligent observer, but, instead, the dangers to religious thought from those within. He is indicating how lack of faith in man's intuitive recognition of God and his ignoring the doctrine of revela- tion, through which means God revealed Himself to man, are the real enemies to true faith. 5 Lily Bess Campbell, " The Grotesque in the Poetry of Robert Browning " (Austin, Univ. of Texas, Master's Thesis, 1907), p. 21; "another critic" is James Fotheringham, Studies of the Mind and Art of Robert Browning (London, 1900, 4th ed. revised), p. 360. Cf. Fotheringham' statment on p. 358: "Caliban, you see, understands blindly those Necessities of thought' which hold us to the final theses of the Paleyan theology."</page><page sequence="4">144 Michael Timko That Browning should center his attention on those twins of ortho- doxy, Butler and Paley, is not surprising, for their reputations at this time were great and their works widely read. Newman, for instance, regarded Butler as the greatest name in the Anglican Church; to him Butler was " always an unfailing reservoir of religious inspiration." (Mossner, p. 209) In terms of time, the years 1837 to 1860 marked the period of Butler's greatest adulation in England and elsewhere, and " Caliban," we know, was probably written in 1859-60.6 "We do not propose to review the writings of Bishop Butler," an American writer said in 1837. " We should almost as soon think of reviewing the writ- ings of the apostle Paul." (Mossner, p. 205) As required reading in both Oxford and Cambridge, with many editions brought out year after year, Butler's Analogy had a remarkable influence on generations of Englishmen. Paley's work, although not so influential or popular, was, nevertheless, widely read, and enjoyed a certain success in the universities, especially at Cambridge. Both these works also gave the "philosophical impetus" to the famous Bridgeivater Treatises (men- tioned by Browning in Mr. Sludge , " The Medium") written about the same time as " Caliban," which, in Halévy's words, were to " recon- cile Christian doctrine with the conclusions of modern physiology." 7 As the epigraph to the poem ( Psalms , 50: 21, " Thou thoughtest that I was altogether such a one as thyself") indicates, Browning knew exactly where the real danger to his emotional gnosticism lay. From his own religious approach, what was most disturbing to Browning was the heavy emphasis these men placed on proof and reason. In arguing against the satiric intent of " Caliban," Tracy points out that Caliban's theology bears no conceivable resemblance to the beliefs of any actual radical thinker of that time or any other. (Tracy, p. 489) The statement is true, but it only points up the fact that Browning's stress in the poem is on the close resemblance of Caliban's 6 See DeVane, p. 299, and C. R.

Matthew Arnold also saw the great influence of Butler and felt the need to undermine that influence; see his " Bishop Butler and the Zeit-Geist," Contemporary Review , XXVII (February, March, 1876), 377-395, 571-592. Although he finds the Analogy a failure, he writes: " Butler deserves that one should regard him attentively, both on his own account, and also because of the immense and confident laudation bestowed upon his writings." (378)</page><page sequence="5">Browning upon Butler 145 position with that of these orthodox thinkers and the dead end to which this position would ultimately lead. While Butler and Paley were writing ostensibly to combat rationalistic tendencies and to sup- port faith, they are essentially rationalists using empirical methods. Most criticism, favorable or unfavorable, concedes this point. In his introduction to the Analogy , the Reverend Ronald Bayne stresses that Butler's method is inductive, and he quotes from Chalmers: " Butler is in theology what Bacon was in science. . . . Both deferred alike to the certainty of experience as being paramount to all the plausibilities of hypothesis." (Bayne, p. xviii) Butler himself, in the Analogy , states explicitly that " religion is not intuitively true, but a matter of deduc- tion and inference," (Part II, Chapter VI) and this attitude underlies his entire thesis. His whole purpose may be, as Bayne concludes, to show that religious conviction cannot be made to depend only upon demonstrative proof, but his dependence on analogy and his constant references to empirical proof lead to the opposite conclusion. Paley too, although in no sense rejecting revelation, insists on stick- ing to " natural " fact. " Paley is a convinced empiricist," Ferré stresses in his remarks on Natural Theology , a work which he calls the " super- lative statement of the teleological argument." He goes on to de- scribe Paley 's method: " The basic trustworthiness of sense experience is presupposed. . . . His philosophical method is consistently to adopt the standards accepted in the empirical sciences; he mistrusts the a priori, he avoids reliance on any * revelation ' claiming immunity from rigorous criticism." (Ferré, pp. xi, xiv) The subversive nature of this kind of approach towards religious belief and, more especially, towards God from Browning's point of view is obvious; the result could only be harmful, on Caliban's island or any island, and at any time. The real difficulty with the point of view both works represent is that they lead ultimately either, at the very least, to a kind of utilitarian- hedonistic attitude unworthy of a spiritually (and emotionally) based religion, or, at the very extreme, to downright skepticism or atheism. Paley 's emphasis on the " state of gratification " enjoyed by plants and animals (" aphids greedily sucking . . . juices "; " shoals of the fry of fish ... so happy that they know not what to do with themselves") and his concern to point out the " superaddition " of pleasure to animal sensations " beyond what was necessary for any other purpose " are illustrations of the lengths to which he at times needs to go to prove the goodness of the Deity. " It is," he remarks, " a happy world after all." (Chapter XXVI) In addition to this hedonistic ethic, which, of course, reduces man to a Caliban-like state, we find in both works a</page><page sequence="6">1 46 Michael T imko utilitarian kind of " religious book-keeping " that is limited mainly to seeing events and action in terms of prudence rather than faith, to an insistence on the practicality of moral behavior on a quid pro quo basis rather than an appeal to the mercy and forgiveness of a loving God. " God has given us to understand," writes Butler, " he has appointed satisfaction and delight to be the consequence of our acting in one manner, and pain and uneasiness of our acting in another, and of our not acting at all." (Part I, Chapter II) Echoes in Bentham and Mill are unmistakable. Even more serious, however, is the consequence of following the reasoning of both works to their logical conclusions, for this could result in the rejection of any kind of faith whatever. " It is quite within reason," Mossner writes, "to maintain in answer to [Butler's] negative case of Revelation, not that both Revelation and Natural Religion should therefore be accepted, but that both should therefore be rejected," and it is this logical deduction of which Brown- ing was well aware. (Mossner, p. 103) Many of Caliban's deductions are the result of carrying on the reasoning of these natural theologians to its reductio ad absurdum. The basic questions in the poem are those concerning the nature of God, His relationship to human beings, and His method of revealing Himself to these human beings. Related to these, of course, is the question of man's immortality; what can one deduce of a future life in the light of the relationship of God and man? Caliban, who is pon- dering these questions, reasons, like Butler and Paley, inductively. He is the complete Baconian. Limited to his senses (unlike man, Browning would stress), he depends on them, just as Butler and Paley, while admitting that man is not limited to his senses, do. And Caliban is consistent, always resorting to analogies; " so He " is his favorite ex- pression. He also, like Butler and Paley, is aware of the hedonistic- utilitarian aspects of theology and the large part that pleasure and pain, especially the latter, play in one's life. But unlike Butler and Paley, he makes no ethical or moral connection between pain and pleasure and virtue and vice, and in this respect, as Browning indicates, he is much more logical than they. Butler, for instance, sees rewards and punishments as consistent with " the general method of Divine adminis- tration " by which we are led to foresee, " with more or less clearness , that if we act so and so, we shall have such enjoyments, if so and so, such sufferings." (Part I, Chapter II, my italics) Caliban, much more consistent in his Baconian approach, recognizes that the deity, if it is to be understood through analogies and natural surroundings, will not be bound by mere habit or wishful thinking. " You must not know His</page><page sequence="7">Browning upon Butler 147 ways, and play Him off, /Sure of the issue." (11. 224-225) Nature and experience have taught Caliban the danger of trying the same way twice. Browning's reduction to absurdity of this natural reasoning is clearly seen in Caliban's views on immortality and his concept of the deity. In contrast to his dam Sycorax who believed that after death there was some future life, Caliban is sure that there is none; " with the life, the pain shall stop." (1. 250) Tracy finds that Caliban's rejection of im- mortality is based on his inability to believe in the doctrine of eternal punishment, but this seems to be reading far too much into the text. There is nothing in Caliban's words or actions to justify the conclusion that he is beginning to see at the heart of the universe " not two con- flicting principles, eternal right and eternal wrong, but rather one all- embracing principle of which both right and wrong are modifica- tions." (Tracy, p. 493) Rather, Caliban rejects immortality simply because he cannot see any basis for it from his own observation. There is no question of good or bad, right or wrong, involved; he cannot break " earth's bond " as so many of Browning's other characters suc- ceed in doing because his is a world limited to sense. If one is to limit himself to natural theology, his religious thinking will be limited because he will be unable to rise above sense impressions. This is why, despite their sincere efforts, both Butler and Paley could never satisfy Browning. They, as Caliban, cannot make the necessary intuitive leap. Immortality cannot be inductively arrived at from experience, and, more important, God cannot be seen in the wing of an insect, the eye of a bird, or one little mess of whelks. The last point touches upon the crux of the poem, for Caliban's whole outlook is governed by a strict denial of intuitive faith; this fact, as much as any scale of evolution, accounts for his " primitive " the- ology. It is commonplace by this time to see the heart of Browning's own religious belief in just those very things denied, or at least not adequately stressed, by the natural theologians. Caliban's view of the Deity, as his view of immortality, could never be completely satis- factory because his natural theology fails to recognize the one unique element of Browning's religious faith: Divine Love. Again, it is im- portant to stress that this position has nothing to do with " primi- tivism." The basis for Caliban's view of Setebos and the Quiet is to be found in his natural theology, not in his being a missing link. Browning's problem, as De Vane points out, was always that of proving God's love to be the equal of His other attributes, and this is the central concern of such poems as Easter-Day and Christmas Eve ,</page><page sequence="8">148 Michael Timko " Saul," " Cleon," " Karshish," " A Death in the Desert," and The Ring and the Book . How can man come to know the real nature of God? How did God reveal Himself to man? The dilemma is best seen, perhaps, in " Saul," when David finds himself believing in Goďs great knowledge and forethought, but doubting His love: " Do I find love so full in my nature, God's ultimate gift,/ That I doubt his own love can compete with it? Here, the parts shift? " (11. 266-267) Obviously, the answer is " No." " The evidence of Divine power is everywhere about us; not so the evidence of Divine love," Browning told Mrs. Orr. "That love could only reveal itself to the human heart by some supreme act of human tenderness and devotion; the fact, or fancy, of Christ's cross and passion could alone supply such a revelation." (Ray- mond, p. 39) Natural theology, then, could see God's power and talk of it by analogy, as Caliban, Butler, and Paley do; but the real message of religion escaped all three. The most obvious statement by Brown- ing in this respect is, of course, La Saisiaz , in which he asserts the primacy of intuition over reason, revelation over natural proof: Call this-God, then, call that- soul, and both- the only facts for me. Prove them facts? that they o'erpass my power of proving, proves them such. Caliban's inability to judge correctly the relationship between Setebos and the Quiet, then, is due to his insistence that reason, not revelation, be the final judge. The insistence also explains why Caliban's " grop- ing " can never be seen as good, for his " groping " about God, rather than being that of a creature lower than man, represents the highest level of a very limited approach. He has to see everything about him, including his deities, in this way, and so does man when he persists in basing his religious views on natural theology. Caliban, looking about him, can see his god's power and strength; but he will never, of course, be able to see his love; so they, Butler, Paley, and natural theologians. Tracy attempts to show that Caliban's dual notion of divinity is similar to Browning's, the Quiet representing all that is abstract and impersonal, Setebos representing an explanation of " hard facts in [his] everyday experience." (Tracy, p. 491) But from Caliban's own description of the Quiet, it is difficult to note this distinction, for there are times when the Quiet is pictured in anthropomorphic terms. Caliban at one time hopes "That some strange day, will the Quiet catch/ And conquer Setebos." (11. 281-82) Another time he states that</page><page sequence="9">Browning upon Butler 149 " This Quiet, all it hath a mind to, doth./ ... It may look up, work up,- the worse for those/ It works on! " (11. 137, 140-41) In short, while the Quiet may be different in some ways from Setebos, particu- larly in its ability to withstand emotional involvement, Caliban still sees it as simply stronger, craftier, and more powerful than either he or Setebos is; although the Quiet is above joy or grief, it is not above acting as both Caliban and Setebos do. The Quiet does, however, share one quality with the other two, and herein lies the key to the poem: the Quiet, like Caliban and Setebos, lacks goodness or love. Browning is not demonstrating two contrasting deities as much as showing that Caliban, because of his rational ap- proach, will never be able to conceive the true nature of the Deity. Rather than seeing God as impersonal and abstract, remote from all personal concerns, Browning viewed the Deity in the same terms he saw Christ; he hungered, as the speaker in Pauline does, not only for God, but for God incarnate in Christ (Fairchild, p. 137), the point being that Christ came to reveal to man that quality of God not visible or accessible to him through reason and experience. Caliban and the natural theologians he represents will continue to speculate and ration- alize; they will see, but they will never know , because they will never experience the revelation of the real Christ, with His emphasis on Divine Love. Caliban will always continue to see evidence of Divine power; he will never see evidence of Divine Love. His Christ must always remain a Setebos, and his God always a Quiet, both of whom must be feared. Caliban's pair of deities are the deities of natural the- ology; Browning's own faith lies "in the intuitive testimony of the heart to the existence of a loving, self-sacrificing God, working with redemptive and transfiguring power in human experience." (Ray- mond, p. 37) To find the poem anything but satiric, then, would lead to a serious misunderstanding of Browning's religious position, which stresses in- tuition, not experience, and which is centered on a Deity directly felt, not seen. In this experience, with love at its heart, there is no degree or chronology; either one approaches God the right way or he does not. And without the recognition of love, which is the basis of man's spiritual life, his theology, there is no chance for any satisfying spiritual experience. To attempt to see God anywhere else but in love, which to Browning was " God becoming manifest," 8 is only to doom oneself to 8 Margaret Sherwood, Undercurrents of Influence in English Romantic Poetry (Cambridge, Mass., 1934), p. 347.</page><page sequence="10">150 Michael Timko spiritual failure. This is exactly what Caliban, Butler, and Paley attempt to do; and this is why they fail, and herein lies the importance of the epigraph, which emphasizes their attempts. " Reason can, and it ought to judge," Butler writes, " not only of the meaning, but also of the morality and the evidence of revelation.', (Part II, Chapter IV) Paley goes even further: " For my part," he states, " I take my stand in human anatomy." (Chapter XXVII) To both these statements Brown- ing would have replied: "I take my stand in Divine Love," and " Caliban upon Setebos " is poetic proof of his strong faith. His God, far from being found in human anatomy, exists in the soul; for this reason, natural theology, whether expressed by a Caliban or a Butler, must always be viewed satirically. To view Caliban sympathetically or to see this groping as good would be to deny, according to Browning, not only religious belief, but God Himself.</page></plain_text>
