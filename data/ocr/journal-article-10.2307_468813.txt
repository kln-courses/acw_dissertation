<plain_text><page sequence="1">Freud, Morality, and Hermeneutics Richard Rorty T oward the end of his essay, talking about current attacks on psychoanalysis by those who would "hermeneuticize" or "de- construct" it, Regis Durand remarks that "There are those who feel that, far from being obsolete, the Einsteinian and the Freudian revolutions, for instance, have not yet come into their own, have not been translated fully into our modes of thinking." I feel this very strongly, at least in respect to the Freudian revolution. Further, I agree with Durand that there is something suspiciously "defensive" about much recent writing on psychoanalysis. So I should like to begin by expanding on his remarks. What does it mean to say that some- thing has not "been translated fully into our modes of thinking"? I take it to mean that a new way of describing things (quite a lot of important things) has come to seem indispensable, and that the avail- ability of this descriptive vocabulary raises doubts about what other, older, vocabularies we can continue to use. It means that we are still in the stage of suspecting that something is going to have to change in our old ways of speaking, but not yet knowing what. Consider some analogies between the Galilean-Newtonian revolu- tion in cosmology and the Freudian revolution. It turned out, in the seventeenth century, that practically everything could be thought of in "corpuscularian" terms, as matter in motion. This was seen as making trouble for traditional religious, moral, and political vo- cabularies. But it took a long time (the next two hundred or so years) for it to become apparent (through the work of such people as Dalton and Mendel) how very useful the new terminology was. It took an equally long time for people to decide just what trouble it caused, to think through questions like: can we still believe in God? can we say the same things about what makes life worth living? if not, can we say anything like that? We are still, even though "high" culture has be- come almost entirely secularized, thinking some of these questions through. I would suggest that, if high culture survives, we are in for another few hundred years of getting adjusted to the availability of the psychoanalytic vocabulary. We are still at the very beginning of answering the really crucial question Freud raised: can we hang on to the idea of "humanity," the secular substitute for God which the in- tellectuals of the eighteenth and nineteenth centuries created for us? CopyrightÂ© 1980 by New Literary History, The University of Virginia</page><page sequence="2">NEW LITERARY HISTORY There is always the possibility that Freud will prove to have been a false start-that when corpuscularianism finally gets down to the microstructure of the nervous system, we shall no longer need the Freudian vocabulary. Talking about friends and criminals as "neu- rotic" rather than "wicked," or relying on the transference process for restructuring our psyches, may come to seem mere transitional stages. Perhaps, a century hence, we shall discuss neuroses using chemical rather than psychoanalytical terminology, and employ exclusively chemical therapy. This could happen in two ways. Chemical ter- minology could preserve and extend the Freudian picture, or it could simply set it aside. In the first scenario physiologists of the future will stand to Freud as Dalton and Mendel stood to Newton-confirming and deepening the general outlines of the picture Freud sketched. In the second, Freud will appear as a Paracelsus rather than a Newton. (Paracelsus's idea of chemically concocted medicines was a good one but, alas, none of his concoctions worked, except by occasional accident.) In either of these scenarios, however, the same question would arise: can "humanity" remain a moral point of reference once the springs of human behavior are, so to speak, demoralized? Can we live with a vocabulary for predicting and controlling our actions which does not overlap with familiar vocabularies of moral deliberation? This question is familiar to any analysand who has to switch back and forth between thinking through a moral dilemma and trying to figure out what his analyst is going to say about why he made one decision or the other. But it will be no less urgent for the patient of the future, who may wonder whether he needs moral counsel or an injection. Such questions cannot be dissolved by distinguishing the "is" and the "ought," or causes from reasons. For finding good reasons to act requires, as a preliminary, finding a good description of oneself and one's situation. One cannot isolate one's psychophysiology from one's ethics, any more than one's cosmology. Nineteenth-century secular intellectuals worked out an ethics which was designed to be compatible with a corpuscularian cosmology. It centered on the ideal of "human progress"-an ideal which survives intact in, e.g., science fiction utopias, as well as in the political rhetoric of the surviving democratic states. This morality centered on replac- ing the love of God with the love of scientific truth, and of the intel- lectual freedom which makes search for such truth possible. The diminution of human suffering was taken to be an inevitable concom- itant of the discovery of such truth, just as the virtue of charity was once taken to be the inevitable concomitant of the love of God. What Freud did to this morality was to make love itself morally dubious- Huxley's and Freud's own love of truth as much as Gerard Hopkins's 178</page><page sequence="3">FREUD, MORALITY, AND HERMENEUTICS love of Mary, Achilles' of Patroclus, or Swift's of Stella and of human liberty. This dubiety is going to remain no matter which scenario is enacted-whether Freud's own terminology is aufgehoben or set aside. For Freud did not merely suggest, in the abstract and jocular manner of Hobbes or Skinner, that love is merely corpuscular motion. He brought mechanistic explanations to bear on the details of our love lives. Those lives will not be the same again, even if Freud's mecha- nisms are shunted aside by others. Nor will our literature be the same again. The association which Breuer and Green point out between psychoanalysis and modernist literature, literature which constantly seems on the verge of ironizing itself out of existence, seems to me the central problem raised by the papers in this issue. One can state the problem as follows: can litera- ture retain its function as the organ of secular morality now that the love of humanity and truth which was central to that morality has been ironized by Freud? Can, for example, novels of secular social hope and secular moral courage survive Freudian descriptions of their protagonists? Can anybody write as George Eliot or Henry James wrote once they have a Freudian vocabulary in the back of their minds? This latter question seems to me the contemporary counterpart to that of Victorian clergymen, who wondered if they could continue to write sermons as their eighteenth-century predecessors had written them, knowing what they now knew about the descent of man. The novel serves the function in secular morality of the sermon in reli- gious morality. It is the principal means of connecting abstract pre- cepts and ideals with particular occasions and lives. It is also the prin- cipal means of moral education, the place where the young can find self-descriptions. If, as Breuer says, "the literature of today can no longer ... be 'positive' without becoming untrue," then it is not clear that literature can any longer serve a moral function, except to pro- vide training in how to live as an ironist. The question of whether literature can any longer be positive-of whether it will die, or transform itself into something unrecog- nizable-can also be put as: given the distrust of liberal nine- teenth-century secular morality which is pervasive among contem- porary intellectuals, can they still take seriously literary works of the nineteenth-century, relatively unironical sort? Can they, for example, still be moved by novels about people succumbing, or not succumbing, to traditional moral temptations? The current struggle in American literary circles between robust, old-fashioned storytelling novelists and ironist critics is a symptom of the inability of intellectuals to take such novels seriously as moral testimonies. They mine them 179</page><page sequence="4">NEW LITERARY HISTORY for ambiguity, intertextuality, and the like, because they do not really recognize morality as a possible form of life. For neither the religious nor the secular and liberal morality seems possible, and no third alter- native has emerged. The problem is that love (and, therefore, courage and cowardice, sacrifice and selfishness) looks different after one has read Freud. It is not that we have learned that there is no such thing, but rather that it has been described in ways which make it difficult to use the notion in moral reasoning. Again, the best analogy seems to me the attitude of the seventeenth century to the religious writing of the sixteenth. "The new philosophy puts all in doubt," though it does not exactly deny or refute. The New Science in the seventeenth century, or psychoanalysis in our century, did not say that what was believed in the past is false. But they made it necessary to say it, or believe it, with a difference. Modernist literature is literature in quest of the difference which psychoanalysis has made necessary. It is the attempt to forge a conscience for the post-Freudian intellectual. By contrast, the writers and critics who produce or de- mand well-told stories about the moral struggles of real people would prefer (and usually get) audiences who have not read Freud (much less Nietzsche). Such writers and audiences would like to keep depth psychology, and philosophy, well away from literature. They sense, correctly, that nineteenth-century literary genres depend upon keep- ing literary invention apart from both literary criticism and philosophical reflection. Their modernist opponents are the people who want to create genres-or, better, a single, new, all-encompassing genre-in which the critic can be as inventive as the novelist, the philosopher as lyrical as the poet, the psychoanalytic theorist as much a philosopher as the moralist. The aim of this fuzzy new genre (of which Blau's splendid paper seems to me a good example) is to create a new morality, or at least something which will bear the same suc- cessor relationship to morality that secular liberalism bore to or- thodox Christianity. This new morality, or quasi morality, would give us something to oppose to Lawrence's image of the modern intellec- tual as "swimming like a rat in the river of corruption, just where it falls into the bottomless pit" and an upbeat answer to Durand's ques- tion: "Are we, too, swimming with the tide of the times, merely hold- ing back over the edge of dissolution long enough to spin our little vortex of discourse, report to the rest of the pack?" I do not know whether this effort will be successful-whether such a new genre will eventually become a tradition and a source of moral education. It may be that there can be no heroines and heroes who are both ironists and lovers. Or it may be that we are, without quite realizing it, already living among such heroes and heroines. (Some- 180</page><page sequence="5">FREUD, MORALITY, AND HERMENEUTICS times fictional ones; sometimes, perhaps, even real ones.) But I think that we should distinguish between making such heroic lives possible by assimilating psychoanalysis into our moral consciousness, on the one hand, and giving an account of what Freud did, of what psychoanalysis is, on the other. The papers I want to discuss are the ones which attempt, or bear upon, this latter task. It seems to me that such attempts as Schafer's and Wolfs to "de- positivize" or "humanize" or "hermeneuticize" psychoanalysis, as well as attempts like Buck's to weave psychoanalytical and critical notions together, are parts of a larger attempt to "place" psychoanalysis, to transcend and distance it. I am somewhat suspicious of such attempts, because I think psychoanalysis needs to be used rather than trans- cended. We need to get closer to it rather than to distance it, to live with its terminology rather than to translate that terminology into another, less specific, loftier vocabulary. To extend the analogy which I have been pressing one step further, such attempts resemble the attempts of idealists like Berkeley, Kant, and Royce, and of "process philosophers" like Bergson and Whitehead, to escape the secularizing implications of Newtonian physicalistic cosmology by distancing the vocabulary of physical science. The idealists treated that vocabulary as "speaking with the vulgar" or "merely phenomenal"; the "process philosophers" treated it as merely heuristic, as a set of abstractions which provided convenient manipulatory tools. None of them took it at face value, as a vocabulary to be lived with and used, one with which other vocabularies were going to have to mesh. The necessary mesh- ing was done by the explicit and unmetaphysical secularists-people like Feuerbach, Arnold, Mill, Zola, Huxley, Engels, Dewey, and Dreiser. These were the people who found ways of being moral with- out God, and who did the real work. The people who tried to invent a diminished God who could coexist with the Newtonian world- machine, or who tried to denigrate the "epistemological" or "metaphysical" status of that machine, were merely useful kibitzers on the sidelines. Unfortunately, they thought themselves more than that. We modern kibitzers on psychoanalysis and literature should not make the same mistake. What Durand calls "the ruthless undoing of the models which have helped us understand our culture (psychoanalysis, political economy, semiotics)" encourages us to think that such deconstructive kibitzing is a bigger deal than it really is. But the only task it can perform is a negative one: giving a sense of the historicity, transience, and general chanciness of all vocabularies (in- cluding Freud's). It cannot transcend these vocabularies or place them in a larger context. It cannot help us answer Durand's Laurentian question by giving us, once again, a conscience. 181</page><page sequence="6">NEW LITERARY HISTORY Let me now illustrate these doubts by citing some examples. Ernest Wolf says that "According to Freud, man is born relatively helpless, with dangerous instincts, especially his sexual and aggressive propen- sities, which society must tame or perish; civilization is bought at the price of neurosis. Kohut, in contrast, sees man born ready to confront his surround in an active dialogue through which man creates his self as part of the world and creates the world as part of his self." This seems a false antithesis. Wolfs description of Kohut's vision is a de- scription of the least common denominator of a lot of neo-Kantian thought (e.g., Cassirer, Goodman). At the level of abstraction at which this thought works, Freud too can say that we create our self as part of the world, and conversely. Wolf goes too far when he says, for exam- ple, that "Freud's total commitment to the truth as the uppermost of all values prevented him from fully harvesting his rich insights into the creative process. For he failed to appreciate clearly that the infan- tile illusion was, indeed, reality, i.e., the infant's psychic reality, a reality that is absolutely necessary for the establishment of the child's firmly cohesive self." In this Kantian, phenomenal sense of "reality," Freud could happily accept Kohut's description. But at this level of abstraction the mechanisms of the unconscious become continuous with the conscious activities of the arts and sciences; most human activities, after all, aim at creating a picture of ourselves and our world. Surely, we are in danger of losing the bite of Freud's work if we lose his sense of the discontinuity. What Goodman calls "worldmak- ing" doubtless goes all the way down to the infant, but what Freud offered us was a sense of the infantile (in the pejorative sense) charac- ter of a lot of the worlds we make later on. Maybe we can, in Kohut's way of looking at the self, hold on to the sense of danger which Freud's account of the infant's "sexual and aggressive propensities" gave us. But it seems harder, simply because what Wolf describes as Kohut's "bridg[ing] the gap between depth psychology and the humanities" is a result obtained by what Wolf calls "a shift away from giving primary attention to parts, e.g., to instincts and bodily zones ... toward attempting to grasp the totality of a whole person." That shift seems to lose just what made Freud both so useful and so important-his dehumanization of the springs of action, and espe- cially of love. Schafer's "hermeneutic version of psychoanalysis" as "an interpre- tive discipline rather than a natural science" is supposed to "de- metaphorize" the language of psychoanalytic theory. Schafer says: "A structure, a mechanism, a mental apparatus, a discharge of energy, an automatization, or an internalization: these and other such meta- psychological terms evidence the importing of blatantly corporealized fantasy content into psychoanalytic theory." He thinks that we have 182</page><page sequence="7">FREUD, MORALITY, AND HERMENEUTICS come to appreciate this because of advances in philosophical thought since Freud's day: "That it [Freud's metapsychology] is crudely positivistic and that its mechanistic concepts are obsolete have been made increasingly plain by advances in the theory of knowledge about (or interpretation of the activities of) human beings and the world they inhabit. Against Freud's nineteenth-century assumptions and preconceptions stand today's relativistic or pluralistic conceptions of methods, data, and reality; and there is as well the contemporary emphasis on the formative role of language in establishing what we claim to do, know, and understand." I do not think that the theory of knowledge has advanced beyond Kant, nor that "the contemporary emphasis on the formative role of language" is much more than an updating of the Kantian insistence on the formative role of concepts. The updating is important in that it emphasizes, as Kant did not, that conceptual schemes are contingent and transitory historical phenomena. But this point does not serve Schafer's purpose. "Structure, mechanism ... discharge of energy, automatization" do not become obsolete because the Kantian notion of the a priori has been relativized, in the manner of C. I. Lewis and Wittgenstein. More generally, no epistemological or semantical con- siderations are going to evade or transmute the mechanistic character of Freudian explanations any more than of Newtonian explanations. These explanations work; they give us a handle on the things we want to manipulate or change. They can of course be translated into an- thropomorphic, humanized terms, but then they lose their moral sig- nificance. Worse, the theory in which they are formulated loses its ability to improve and progress. Schafer is doubtless right that the use of "action language" in a clinical psychoanalytic situation helps make it more difficult for a patient to sluff responsibility off onto psychic components. But, for that matter, it is useful for computer pro- grammers and operators to diagnose "bugs" in anthropomorphic, "intentional" terms (rather than "hardware," mechanistic terms) when talking about their machines. ("The stupid computer doesn't under- stand that ..." "It wants ..." "It thinks . . . ," and so forth.) We should not think that programmers are responding to "inescapably intersubjective, hermeneutic, and narrative features" of the situation. They are simply using a vocabulary which is handy for the purpose at hand. The fact that it is handy for therapeutic purposes not to let the patient get away with blaming psychical mechanisms does not, in it- self, give a reason for eliminating mechanisms from the analyst's own explanation of what the patient is doing. Mechanistic explanation is handy for computer repair and for the diagnosis of neuroses; action language is handy for the diagnosis of computer programs and for repairs carried on on the couch. But the relative handiness of the 183</page><page sequence="8">NEW LITERARY HISTORY vocabularies is in neither case an index of the metaphysical realities. The moral, if any, of the "advances" of which Schafer speaks is that there aren't any metaphysical realities-that the utility of a vocabulary cannot be explained as conformity to the inner nature of the objects to which it is applied. My suggestion that Kant already told us all we needed to know about the relations of mechanism and subjectivity is supported by Buck's remark that "The concept of action can be universalized and speech ... can be conceived as a mode of action. In the end the hermeneutics of texts can be grasped as a particular, but in its par- ticularity also a paradigmatic, form of action hermeneutics. This way of seeing the question is not so very novel. It repeats in its own way the procedure characteristic of modern philosophy since Kant of analyz- ing particular 'actions' of the theoretical and practical subject." How- ever, I take Kant's procedure merely to illustrate the fact that you can interpret anything you like as "language," and hence any activity you engage in as "hermeneutical." Buck, however, thinks there is more to it than that. He says: "the fundamental trait of all interpretation, of texts as well as of actions, is the explication of meaning that is only implicitly given in the performance"; and again: "To every definite praxis, in order that it can remain a praxis, belongs a self- forgetfulness that prevents the action from simultaneously grasping itself concretely." This seems to me to show merely (1) that you can treat anything (a human being insulting or kicking another human, an amoeba putting out a pseudopod, a particle banging into another particle) as usefully placeable in a larger context of possible actions in possible situations, and (2) that the human or amoeba or particle doesn't necessarily know much about this context, at least at the mo- ment of action. So for Buck's description of hermeneutics as "bring- ing into consciousness of a formerly unconscious meaning," I should substitute, in good Wittgensteinian fashion, "placing in a context which wasn't initially envisaged." I am, consequently, dubious about Buck's criticism of Habermas's attempt to use Freud as a model. Buck argues that "Hermeneutic explication belongs to the normality of speaking and acting and is provoked at most by the failure of understanding or communication among actors. It has no character of unmasking whatsoever, unlike psychoanalytic reflection, which thus appears so well suited to the business of the critique of ideology." It seems to me that hermeneuti- cal explication (which for me, but not for Buck, is continuous with theory-formation in the sciences) may have the character of unmask- ing or may not, depending upon whether there is moral importance in the context which is revealed. Lots of psychoanalytic interpreta- 184</page><page sequence="9">FREUD, MORALITY, AND HERMENEUTICS tions (of jokes, for example) don't have any more of an "unmasking" character than do interpretations of the behavior of butterflies. The joker may not be ashamed to make, or laugh at, the same sort of joke again. Ideology-critique, however, has, ex vi terminorum, moral impli- cations. Thus I see no reason why Habermas should hesitate to use the same thin and etiolated notion of hermeneutics which Buck him- self uses. (I realize that Buck's argument depends upon the claim that "inexplicitness of meaning" is "essential" in the nonpsychoanalytic case while only "contingent" in the psychoanalytic, but I do not feel I understand this point. Granted that inexplicitness is normal-that is, nothing both acts and puts its act in context simultaneously-I do not see that it is less normal, or more contingent, in those actions [or social institutions] for which Freudian [or Habermasian] interpretations are appropriate.) My criticism of Schafer's and Buck's papers are corollaries of views which I have defended elsewhere. (See, e.g., a symposium on her- meneutics in The Review of Metaphysics for September, 1980). I shall not develop them further, but simply repeat that we should not be too quick to accept the Diltheyan opposition between hermeneutical and "positivistic" approaches. We should consider the possibility that Freud was both a good mechanistic natural scientist and a practitioner of hermeneutics, and that these two descriptions of what he did do not create any dialectical tension which requires philosophical resolu- tion. The more we are tempted to discard the mechanisms, the de- humanizing elements in Freud's theory, in order to bridge a putative gap between psychoanalysis and literature, the more likely we are to lose sight of what makes Freud so troubling. There is nothing wrong with seeing psychoanalysis as continuous with literary criticism, or with literature itself, from a methodological or metaphysical standpoint. But method and metaphysics do not greatly matter, and they may help repress what makes psychoanalysis important in the first place. Freud's discoveries of unconscious mechanisms endanger the notions of morality and rationality which made possible the liberal secular culture within which what we call "literature" and "literary criticism" emerged. We are in danger of forgetting what it was about Freud that threw all this in doubt. In order to keep this in view, I think we need less methodology and metaphysics-less philosophical reinterpretation of the activity of psychoanalysis-and more insis- tence on the still unassimilated effects of psychoanalysis upon our attempts to think in moral terms.
