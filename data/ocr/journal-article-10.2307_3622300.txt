<plain_text><page sequence="1">ON INTERPRETATION* By SIMON RAWIDOWICZ I When one thinks of Israel's spiritual and literary work through the ages - its essence, manifestations and style - one is faced, at first thought, with a peculiar double-layered phenomenon: a "text" on the one hand, its "commentary" on the other. The "text" is limited in space and time, confined to one "cycle" in the history of Israel's existence, to one layer in its thought; it has a beginning and an end, while the "commentary" has no end. The "text" is comparatively short, while the "commentary" is of very great length, continuing on and on through the cen- turies, our own century included. Technically the "text" is the Bible, all the rest is "commentary." In brief: Bereshith bara Israel, in the Bible Israel was creative, afterwards it was only "commenting"; it has become a people of commentators, all post-Biblical Jewish literature being a chain of commentaries on the "text" and commentaries to commentaries. This widely spread thesis assumes in various forms the character of an axiom, and serves also as basis for some religious and political ideologies concerning Israel, for the evaluation of its spiritual character in the past, as well as its prospects for the future. I am not concerned here with the value-judgment predominant in this thesis, repeated again and again in and outside the House of Israel, mostly in a critical and even negativistic attitude; but rather with the factual aspect of this axiom which seems to me to need fundamental revision. First, the adequacy of the understanding of "commenting" which underlies this "axiom," has to be examined; then - the distinction it makes between the "text" and the particular "commentary" as it has developed in the course of Israel's history. * Unfortunately the author's untimely death made it necessary for others to read proof. Some corrections could not therefore be made. 83</page><page sequence="2">84 RAWIDOWICZ [2] This axiom is unsatisfactory in two respects: a) it fails to distinguish between the various kinds of commenting, and thus bars the way to the understanding of the meaning of interpreta- tion; b) it goes too far in deepening the gap between "creating" and "interpreting" which adds to the misunderstanding of the very essence of "interpreting." It is not admissible to separate to such an extent creative from interpretive thought as implied in this axiom. There is no creation which is not at the same time interpretive. Still further, not only a thought but even our sense experience is deeply steeped in interpretation. Without undertaking here an epistemological analysis we may say that as soon as we become aware of our sensory impressions, still more so the instant we begin to conceptualize our sense data, while applying certain laws and forms to them, we are already involved in a process of interpretatio; we see the "given" in our sense-experience in an interpreted shape. Interpretatio is in- separable from any act of thinking or judging; it pervades all our emotional and intellectual apparatus in all its manifestations. If this is the case in the sphere of "primary" perception and thinking, how much more so is it in that of "receiving," "sec- ondary" experience - emotional, aesthetic (the sphere of Nachfuehlen, Nacherleben, the understanding of the other man in its most elementary meaning). As recipients of matters spiritual of all kinds, for instance as auditors of music we receive most of it in an interpreted form. Who has ever heard a sym- phony or any musical composition "as such," as it was originated in the mind of the composer? Whenever we hear a musical work, we "get" it interpreted by this or that conductor, performed by this or that orchestra.' The philosopher who will be discussed later, who turned cogitatio and extensio into the two attributes of God said: Homo cogitat.2 Homo cogitans means homo interpres, man is an interpretator. The "political animal" is always an Some of the points alluded to in this study find their more detailed elabora- tion in the chapter dealing with the problem of Interpretatio in Jewish Thought in my "Introduction to Jewish Philosophy" (to be published). 2 Benedicti de Spinoza Ethica ..., Part 11, Axiomata, 11, ed.

Bruder, 1843, p. 224.</page><page sequence="3">[3] ON INTERPRETATION 85 interpreting animal, in his "political" sphere as well as in his personal world of experience at large; more than that: he never ceases by his very nature, and by the nature of "things" outside him, to be an interpreted interpreter. Without going into a terminological history of the attributes designating all kinds of commenting, which can not be our concern here, I would suggest that we distinguish between the various types of commenting: explicatio and commentatio on the one hand, interpretatio on the other.3 Commentatio or explicatio are tools for easing the burden of a "document," reliving, bringing nearer the somewhat remote in it, paraphrasing an older statement, substantially repeating the gist of the "doc- ument" thus explained. This activity is mainly dictated by an attitude of identification between the commentator (and his "surroundings"), and the commentated "document," its meaning and purpose. In contradistinction to explicatio and commentatio I would understand by interpretatio, with which I deal here, an attempt at reshaping either the "document" interpreted or the world it came from. Here an act of transference is always involved. An invasion of one system by another takes place. Interpretatio lives by crisis, in various degrees. The crisis that stimulates it will become its criterion. Interpretatio can be characterized by a particular attitude of the interpretator who struggles between preserving and rejecting some forms or content of the world at his interpretative "mercy"; by a tension between continuation and rebellion, tradition and innovation. It derives its strength both from a deep attachment to the "text" and from an "aliena- tion" from it, a certain distance, a gap which has to be bridged. 3 The study of the history of the various terms for commenting and the development of their connotations in older languages and civilizations is a task to be undertaken by students in those fields. Here it may suffice to note that in Latin, unlike explicatio and commentatio, - interpretatio (interpres, interpretator etc.) has in addition to the connotation of explaining, exposing, etc. also that of mediating (linguistically) and translating (also more in the spirit than in the letter, interpretabilis =also translatable, interpretamentum = also translation) which is an act of transference in "body," form, content and atmosphere of a text.</page><page sequence="4">86 RAWIDOWICZ [4] Interpretatio is the "way out" when man is compelled to "take it" or "break it." Many a battle was fought and lost on the battle- field of interpretatio. And the battle goes on and will go on as long as homo is an interpres. Explicatio and commentatio follow the "text" step by step, "uncover" and explain it from the aspect of its form and content, language and historical background. Interpretatio is centered on the "soul" of the text, its leitmotif, its main purpose, its essence, its particular character. Interpretatio assumes that there is a hidden layer both in the "form" and the "content" of the document to be interpreted; this "hidden" needs un- covering. There is a mystery between the words and between the lines, that which the document ought to have said and did not say, either because it could not say (for various reasons) or it did not want to say - this it is which intrigues the interpretator, who will naturally dig in the hidden layers of the "text." He wants to make the implicit in the text explicit, to "spell out" that which is implied. Needless to add, there are various degrees in interpretatio. Not in all of them does interpretatio go all the way, manifest all the characteristics mentioned here. One may distinguish between perfect interpretatio, where it reaches its peak of fulfillment, and imperfect, partial, or unfinished interpretatio (where the reasons for "not finishing" may vary). Interpretatio does not begin with the Alexandrians - who would naturally come to the mind of a contemporary student in any field of learning, when pondering the problem of interpreta- tion - though they have played such an important role in this field. It is probably as old as man thinking and feeling, expressing himself, communicating, understanding or mis-understanding the other man. Primitive man must have become aware of the first manifestations of the problem of interpretation in trying to "understand" his night-reality, his dreams, to decipher their language, to find the link between visions of dreams and notions of all kinds gained during the waking part of life. (Dream and waking life are perhaps even to the average man of our society, and still more so to the psychologist, to some extent a kind of system of "mutual" interpretation). This natural process of</page><page sequence="5">[5] ON INTERPRETATION 87 interpretatio in the life of the individual, his society, and civiliza- tion, under "normal" conditions, became more complicated, richer in problems, as tradition and authority were established, which man tried to undermine or to eliminate; as man became heir to some past, and his inheritance became a problem which he had to "solve" either by getting rid of its burden or by making it bearable for himself. Thus the various stages in the development of religious, social and political ideas and institutions, in early and recent times, including all transition from myth to reason, magic to science, "intuition" to knowledge, from the many to the one (pluralism to monism) and vice versa, from heaven to earth and from earth to heaven with or without a Jacob's ladder - are substantially stages of interpretatio; in every step made in them by man interpretatio is deeply involved. The necessity of interpretatio lies at their very roots. It brings them into being and shapes their character. There is no work of thought or of art which has no interpretatio, which is not at bottom interpreta- tive. In some of the great works of world literature, old and modern, interpretatio of "human conditions" is their very core. Every poet, novelist, playwright, composer and painter struggles with interpretatio, is constantly interpreting. The problem of imitatio, so prominent in arts, has to be viewed fundamentally from the perspective of interpretatio. No area of man's spiritual activity is free from interpretatio. "Modern man" is often surprised at and makes fun of the older, classical or mediaeval interpretations-- in religion, visual arts, literature. He does not realize how much his own system of understanding, research, evaluation, appreciation of arts, all his creativity is interpretatio- centered. When in an adequately critical frame of mind, he avoids the pitfalls of older interpretatio, only to fall into new ones, made by him and his time. In most kinds of explicatio and commentatio there is "some- thing" - and usually even much - of interpretatio. As soon as a statement about a given "text" (document, or another state- ment) is not purely tautological, strictly verbal paraphrasing - it is already in the web of interpretatio. Literal interpretatio is a contradictio in adjecto. All interpretatio transcends by its</page><page sequence="6">88 RAWIDOWICZ [6] very nature the literal. The literal can only be identical with itself, repeating itself. Even in the purely philological sphere, in explaining words, terms, or sentences, an act of interpretatio is involved. This would apply also to synonymic explanation. Explicatio that "defends" its text is nothing but interpretatio that comes to save the text, to avert a danger threatening its validity or authority. Still more so is the conscious rejection of interpretatio (as described here) an interpretatio in itself. Here most literalists are probably mistaken when they feel safe on the ground of their verbalism and are seemingly happy not to go astray and fall into the trap of interpretatio. Yet it is conscious and purposed interpretatio - where acceptance and rejection, continuation and breaking up are interwoven - which is capable of absorbing a "given" world and reshaping it, giving it a new meaning and direction (and there are various degrees in this giving). Interpretatio worthy of its name - when reaching some measure of perfection - is a revolution from within, planned and executed by insiders with the purpose of reshaping their "home," without any pressure (or any decisive pressure) from outside, disregarding adjustment to the outside. Interpretatio is a fundamental phenomenon in the world at large in the sphere of religious, political and social ideas. An adequate grasp of this phenomenon is essential for the evaluation of the decisive battles in the spiritual life of ancient and modern civilizations. It is of still greater relevance for the evaluation of the development of Israel's thought in ancient times, and its transitions from them to modern times, especially for the under- standing of the relation between the "text" of Israel's beginning and the accumulated interpreting work that followed. Needless to say, when I allude here to the need of seeing interpretatio as the elementary function that pervades every act of feeling and thinking, thus preparing the ground for "elevating" interpretatio to the high status of what is generally called creative writing and thinking,4 I do not think of the 4 It is obvious to any student of the work of the spirit how unjustified is the current description of certain branches of literary work as "creative writing," as if a novel or a poem or a play were not interpretative, and an Essay in</page><page sequence="7">[7] ON INTERPRETATION 89 predominantly "technical" aspects or parts of research in general. Far be it from me to be disrespectful of the many devices of research, especially of grammatical-philological and historical scrutinizing of the documents of the past, of the great work involved in editing reliable texts and all the indispensable annotating and footnoting. Yet in the footsteps of our Masters who distinguished between melakhah and Iokhmah I would say with the greatest admiration for melakhah in the field of learning that no culture can live by the bread of melakhah alone. In- terpretatio has certainly a claim to z.okhmah. The beginning of wisdom is interpretatio. II All spiritual and literal activity of post-Biblical Israel has to be viewed in the light of a more adequate understanding of the very essence and function of interpretatio than the current one. This applies with special relevance to two fields of Israel's activity to which I shall confine myself here: 1) The work Israel achieved during the Bayith Sheni, 2) Jewish philosophy from Saadya Gaon onwards. If one is allowed to distinguish between an "external" time (in the chronological sense) and an "inner" spiritual or ideological time, I would like to state that by Bayith Sheni I understand here the "time" which starts with the Babylonian Exile and Ezra the scribe, and goes on till a few centuries after the destruction of the second Temple, including the time of the final shaping of the Babylonain Gemara'.s As hinted, the Bayith Rishon is generally considered the era of Israel's creativity, while the Bayith Sheni inaugurated Israel's "commenting" activity which has not ceased since. The picture drawn of the relation between Bayith Rishon and Bayith Sheni is usually that of a beginning and a continuation. The prophets Philosophy and History, etc. were not "creative." It would be more correct to distinguish between different kinds of interpretative creativity; technically also between research-writing and non-research writing. s For the presentation of this concept of Bayith Sheni cf. Part One in my Babylon and Jerusalem (1957), pp. 55 ff.</page><page sequence="8">90 RAWIDOWICZ [8] started and the Sopherim brought "it" to final fulfillment. What the prophets and the seers have done in the Bayith Rishon, the Sopherim and the men of Halakhah and 'Aggadah have done in Bayith Sheni. Some would reduce the difference between the Torah of the Bayith Rishon and that of the Bayith Sheni to that which exists between a general law or statement and its detailed application.6 It is more than questionable whether, e. g., the Aggadist's identification of the third of prophet Micah's postulates of goodness and of God's askings of man with the burial of the dead and the bringing the bride to the -Iuppah7 and many many similar identifications stated by the men of the Bayith Sheni, known to students of Halakhah and 'Aggadah, can be described as a commentary or as a "detailed" inference from the broader general statement thus "commented." He who spoke of the special kind of man's walking with his God said one thing, while he who identified this "walking" with the burial of the dead and the bringing of the bride to the HIuppah said another; they have not said the same thing just in different language. Their divergent approach in formulating the ultimate ideal of man's walking with his God is derived from a set of differences in their reality and thinking, a difference which cannot be overlooked and described just as a "commentary" or a kind of detailing of implications involved in the text. To consider the work of the Bayith Sheni a "commentary" means both to miss the essence of the work of the Bayith Sheni and not to grasp the meaning and inner structure of interpretatio. The great measure of freedom which the Bayith Sheni took with the world of the Bayith Rishon, the revaluation of personalities of the Biblical era in all its values, and the reshaping of leading 6 They follow - perhaps unknowingly - in the footsteps of Midrash Tan- huma, Noah, 2: Wynv i -ninnD"Vp-91 non= D l InI3OXl tv-1 =In= n71-1 n, 13?

The usual concept of com- mentary can in no way be applied to the Oral Law in its relation to the Written Law nor to the Bayith Sheni in its deep-going "struggle" with the Bayith Rishon in its totality. The Oral Law or the Bayith Sheni did not just add something of its own to the Written Law or the Bayith Rishon. It is not just a continuation or a development but a new act of weaving undertaken by master weavers of rare power. In brief, the Bayith Sheni is not a commentary but an interpretatio of the highest order. Bayith Sheni is second only in time, it is first in essence, in its own particular essence. I dare say Bayith Rishon and Bayith Sheni are two beginnings of a system of thought and mode of life. This means, that Israel has two beginnings. The second beginning or the interpretatio achieved by the Bayith Sheni may serve as a model for interpretatio in the sphere of thought at large. It established one of the great patterns for the way in which to deal with tradition, with an inherited world of facts, ideas, and values. This act of free recreating will always, when properly understood, teach man (not only Jew) how to interpret; to uproot and stabilize simultaneously; to reject and preserve in one breath; to break up and build - inside, from within, casting a new layer on a previous layer and welding them into one mold (which became later the great problem of Jewish thought and being).8 Hence that cardinal thesis of the representatives of the Oral Law formulated in various ways, especially in this classic one: "that which a talmid vatik will teach in the future was already said to Moses on Sinai,"9 is of paramount relevance to the 8 For a detailed discussion of the problems involved in the relation be- tween Bayith Rishon and Bayith Sheni cf.

This thesis of the ancients, with which Maimonides opens his Mishne Torah: "All the commandments which were given to Moses on Sinai were given in their Perush,"'' opens up a series of problems as regards the very concept of the Sinaitic revelation as well as the absoluteness and uniqueness of the Written Law and its precedence over the Oral Law, which is not our concern here. For our problem it is of great importance to see in this persistent effort of the creators of the Oral Law to elevate it to the status of the Written Law a decisive moment in the struggle to give the Perush an equal status with the "text" it interprets in so far as they share the same origin. Equality of origin and time for the Perush with the "text" means absolute equality of value (irrespective of the distinction in the degree of their validity). This equality of value is bound to lend the Perush an autonomy, a self-sufficiency sui generis. From Neh. 8.8," describing that memorable half day when Ezra read the Torah,1" we learn that he read the Torah in an "interpreted" way. Yet the redactor of the final version of the Mishnah, R. Yehudah Ha-nasi', teaches us that interpretatio is inseparable from the revealed Written Law from its very beginning: Israel on Sinai did interpret each word which they heard on Sinai as they heard it.'3 R. Yehudah Ha-nasi' shows here a deep insight into the essence of Perush. Support can also be found here for our thesis of the interwovenness of crea- tivity and interpretatio, their simultaneity and their equality. '1I1 'I'o inD , D T iM ~.P 1?5m.

II, p. 267.</page><page sequence="11">[11] ON INTERPRETATION 93 III This concept of interpretatio, its essence and function, becomes especially manifest in the idea of God as developed in the Bayith Sheni. Interpretatio did not mean here a limited spiritual act but a permanent activity, an intellectual concentration which never ceases. Interpretatio and learning are one, and both are attributed to God. The unique contribution of the Bayith Sheni in the field of religious thought lies in the concept of God, namely in visualizing God as a learning being, an eternal learner. Not only Ray who gave us a description of God's twelve hour work day,14 or 'Ula' who reduced God's world after the destruction of the Temple to Halakhah only,'5 but many others of the creators of the Oral Law emphasize God's learning, His participation in man's learning. The very fact of God's learning is liable to arouse much questioning as to His "essence." Learning as such comes to satisfy a want in the mind of him who learns, to fill a gap in his deficient knowledge, to eliminate ignorance, to satisfy curiosity and amazement. In brief, it is a "human, too human" activity. How can one ascribe it to God, the most perfect Being Who is above any want, desire, deficiency; everything needs Him while He has no needs whatsoever?'6 No wonder that this concept will be considered "blasphemous" not only by any religious man outside the House of Israel but will also seem very strange and even absurd to many a Jew who has not gone through the metamorphosis of post-prophetic interpretatio. Of our concern here is not the "that" of God's learning but its "what." God learns the interpretatio of the Torah given by Him. Although whatever a talmid vatik might teach before his master was said by God to Moses, He has to learn the teachings of His 14 'Abodah Zarah, 3b. 5s Berakhoth 8a: yxi mm 1iny min I - 1 ,1rpmt v pa ipnrI nfl Inn D1'D t Ai ~ ,, ? nu~mN.

Many are the Talmudic-Midrashic descriptions of God's participation in the intellectual work of the Tanna'im and 'Amora'im, learning with them and from them, as if the giver of the Torah has to use the interpretatio of the Tanna'im and 'Amora'im in order to understand the Torah, His Torah. God is a partner in the interpretatio of His Torah, although He is in no need of the practical implications of this interpretatio: The Torah was not made for angels, still less so for the Giver of the Torah Himself. God's active interest in the interpretatio of His Torah is purely for the sake of interpretatio; human interpretatio becomes divine. Aristotle established the concept of God as the Thought of Thought. The Thought of Thought is the prime mover of Nature (and History). God-Interpretator of Israel of the Bayith Sheni (that preserved the Biblical idea of the creative God with all its attributes in its absolute fullness) is the first mover of Israel, the participant in its intellectual activity and in its national survival. Were Ray and the Tanna'im and 'Amora'im who shared his concept of the learning God to establish an analogy between God and man in the spirit of Lev. 19.2, they might have left us the imperative of interpretatio: ye shall be interpretatores for I am an interpretator. The learning, i. e. interpreting God, who quotes the decisions of interpreters of His Torah, which aroused the amazement of Moses;17 who is forced to sit and "bind crowns" to the letters of the TorahIs in anticipation of the interpretatio of one of his interpreters, R. 'Akiba', to whom "things" were revealed that were not revealed to Moses;19 who invites Moses for halachic discussion,2? - does not bar doubting in Halakhah discussion,21 - '7 Midrash Tanbuma, H.fu1kath, 8. 18 B.

Yehudah Ha-nasi' 's pupils, R. Yann'ai: The words of the Torah were not given in an absolutely clear-cut way but God stated about each of his words "49 aspects (faces) of tahor" and "49 aspects of tame' "; when asked by Moses as to the decision, He answered: it is up to the majority to decide.23 Such a statement is certainly one of those over which one should "startle the world" (to use the expression of some of the men of the Bayith Sheni interpretatio, when faced with Biblical verses which shook them strongly). The attribution of "49 faces" against "49 faces" to the revealed Torah contains a great danger to the main value of the Torah, its very claim of authority and absoluteness which it is bound to make on man. Is there any revealed religion that would allow itself to go so far as to tell its receivers and keepers that it does not say definitely yes or no, it does not establish and order behavior for all times but is open to reasoning, to arguing, leaving all decisions to them? Is there a God Who reveals a Law and surrenders its under- standing for all purposes to men, entrusts its application to a majority of humans which by its very nature depends on cir- cumstances of all kinds, is not stable, consistent, can not claim absoluteness "from eternity to eternity?"'4 Seen from our approach, the main meaning of this concept of the not "clear- cut" Torah lies in the establishing of the interpretability of the Torah, announced by God Himself to an extent not to be found, even to a much lesser degree, in any other system of revelation. Here interpretatio reaches not only the high degree of equality with the "text" it interprets. It takes for itself some --or 22 B. Baba Megi'a' 86a. See also B.

For the very equalization of a secondary source of authority with a primary one is liable not only to add tremendous prestige to the source elevated to that equality but also to deprive the primary source of some of its natural primacy.25 All authority is finally vested in interpretatio. What did God give to Moses and Moses brought to Israel? A "text" for interpretatio; not a finished, independent, self-sufficient text, but one which is open and has to remain open to interpretatio;26 more than that, one which demands interpretatio, obliges Israel to go on interpreting, thus discovering in the process of learning the Torah the duty of interpretatio; also of interpretatio as a secret of the account Israel was able to give of itself in history. So overpowering was the love of the Bayith Sheni interpreters for learning, for reasoning and discussing the problems of Torah, for the masa' u-mattan, 7 that they were not afraid to impose the process of learning and interpreting on God himself, and to such an extent that His Torah was not closed up, but open for all possible fluctuations of interpretatio. Only a God Who learns Torah, loves interpretatio, can give an "open" text, - in order to encourage learning, to incite the "battle of Torah." Only He can entrust man with a multi-faced Code - deficient from the perspective of the most perfect Giver -, the validity of which will depend on man, not on one superman, or on the perfect moral or intellectual man, but on the many, on those who will carry the burden of the shakla' vetarya' and will be able to form the majority in any dispute to arise. Hence it should also become clear that the Oral Law is not 2s As to the precedence of Mishnak and Gemara' over mikra', Dibrei Soferim over Dibrei Torah, cf. e. g. the Baraitha in B.

It represents as an in- terpretatio the creativity of Israel during a considerable number of centuries in its second attempt to crystallize its essence and establish for itself a status in the world. It is a work that has its value in itself. It stands on its own. As was said before, its creators not only elevated it to the degree of the text, but were sometimes not afraid to hint at a kind of "if not higher," or "if not more" for this, Israel's second beginning.28 IV The second illustration for my suggestion concerning the revision of the text-commentary thesis is taken from the field of Jewish philosophy. Students of mediaeval Jewish Thought usually divide it up in three main sections, following the three streams or systems of thought of Kalam, Neo-Platonism, and Aristotle with his school. Far be it from me to minimize the need of tracing the work of mediaeval Jewish thinkers to . the sources of classical Greek thought and Muslim thought and theology, in their broadest lines as well as in their minute details. As in regards to the other areas in the field of Israel's work, its political and social 28s As an encouragement for a more adequate understanding of the work of the Bayith Sheni as well as of the Sinaitic origin of the Oral Law - or its standing up to the Sinai measure, of its concept of its own creativity - I may refer here to Rabban Yohanan b.

But the decisive meaning and relevance of Jewish thought are not to be found in its "traces" of the outside sources. Viewed from the perspective of the inner development of Jewish thought and being, the contacts of the Jewish thinkers of the Middle Ages and subsequent centuries with one outside source or the other, is of a rather peripheral character. The center of gravity lies in all efforts or systems of Jewish thought in their understanding and presentation of their Jewish heritage, in their reshaping of Israel's past, in their attitude towards this past; in establishing or strengthening a basis for Israel's survival at large; in brief, the center lies in their interpretatio. When Jewish philosophy from the 9th century onwards fought so hard to make Israel a thinking people, to establish thought in Israel, as if Israel should add to its commandments the commandment to think,29 - it fought for interpretatio, for making Israel an interpreting people. Mediaeval Jewish thought, beginning with Saadya and reaching its peak in Maimonides grasped the full meaning of interpretatio. This is where its main relevance lies (and I am not going to evaluate in this study its achievements and shortcomings in this field). One of the main features of this interpretatio is the transferring of the ancient Hebraic world of vision, the pictorial with all its forms of "simile" and "riddle," to the world of clear-cut concepts as developed by the philosophers from Saadya onwards. A deeper analysis would show that mediaeval and post- mediaeval Jewish Thought continue - in their own way - the work begun by the Bayith Sheni, especially in the direction of interpreting both the remnants of the ancient mythos and the world of vision of the Bayith Rishon. The struggle between the "primitive" vision, the visual, the pictorial which is wrapped in the shape of riddles, puzzles, similes, "signs" on the one hand and the "secondary," more "mature" or "ripe" world of more or less clear concepts, as objects of conscious, critical cognition, 29 Cf. my Philosophy as a Duty, London, 1935.</page><page sequence="17">[17] ON INTERPRETATION 99 logical or scientific judgment on the other, is one of the decisive struggles of man, in his religion, thought and art, his civilization at large. The transition from the pictorial to the conceptual - and the "relapse" from the latter to the former -, also deeply connected with the struggle between mythos and ratio in their broadest meaning - needs probably the most urgent study for the evaluation of our civilization, ancient and modern. These struggles and transitions, for various reasons, assume a still deeper relevance for the making of Israel, its crises and trans- formations through the ages. In the beginning Israel lives in the visual, pictorial, "sees all the voices" (Ex. 20.18) on Sinai, before it and afterwards, during almost all the Bayith Rishon. At the end of the Bayith Rishon the process of transition from the pictorial to the conceptual sets in, which reaches its maturity in the Bayith Sheni - via interpretatio. It is here that the conceptualization of the first layer of Israel's being takes shape (in Halakhah, as well as in other aspects of Israel's civilization). From the visual to the conceptual -- this is the road that Israel treads from the Bayith Rishon to the Bayith Sheni. It is here that Jewish philosophy - mediaeval and post-mediaeval - continues the operation of conceptualization, of purging, of strengthening ratio against mythos, of "translating" the vision of ancient Israel into clear concepts, (and here it has its fore- runners in the camps of Halakhah, Targumim, the Alexandrian School). The great battle of Saadya Gaon and Maimonides, e. g., against anthropomorphism (the natural vision of God in the first and even the second layer - the Biblical and post-Biblical - of Israel's existence), is essentially a concept-interpretatio to Israel's ancient world of the pictorial. Maimonides' opening of the Moreh Nebukhim with the interpretatio of the "anthro- pomorphic terminology" of the Bible - its first 48 chapters - is not incidental or meaningless as it seems to some students of Maimonides.30 It is most typical for the guiding stimulus which 30 E.g. David Kaufmann, Geschichte der Attributenlehre, 1877, p. 367; Wilhelm Bacher, Die Bibelexegese Moses Maimunis, 1896, p. 45; cf. my "She- 'elath Mibnehu Shel Moreh Ha-Nebukhim," Tarbiz, 1935, vol. vi, No. 3, pp. 42 ff.</page><page sequence="18">100 RAWIDOWICZ [18] animated the Jewish thinker of the Middle Ages, who considered it his duty to save the truth of the ancient vision through transferring it to the safe and well established realm of the conceptual. This transfer from the pictorial to the conceptual via interpretatio is most manifest in the efforts of mediaeval Jewish thought to establish a conceptually "satisfactory" concept of God (the highest "object" of vision to the Bayith Rishon), a compatibility between Revelation and Reason (mythos and ratio), between Prophecy and cognition; as well as in other areas of its speculative activity. In brief, Jewish thought from about the 9th century onwards up to modern times, our own days included, is fundamentally an interpretatio of Israel's thought and being in the first two "layers" of Israel's existence. Interpretatio means shaping a new system of thinking, valuing and living. The problems of Jewish philosophy are not merely metaphysical or theological. They concern at bottom the very existence of Israel, mediaeval and post-mediaeval, struggling for the clarification of its essence, seeking grounds for its status and survival as Israel in a non- Israel world, trying to demonstrate its possibility, the necessity of its continuation. Jewish mysticism went up in its "merkabah" to discover a higher space where a new interpretatio of Israel's past and a new vision for its future could be gained. Some of the Kabbalists were yearning for a new era (shemitah) in which the Torah would be rearranged, read anew, and thus free Israel from this given system of Law. The men of Halakhah and 'Aggadah on the one hand, the philosophers from the 9th century onwards on the other, did not wait with their interpretatio for a new shemitah to arrive. The liberty they took with the Torah is of a kind which is indispensable for any system of interpretatio within an established tradition. In order to understand fully the meaning and function of interpretatio it would also be advisable to study the history of the opposition to interpretatio, as here understood. There are two kinds of opposition. The first is presented by traditionalists, strict literalists who would not go beyond "explaining" the text as it is or commenting on it in its own spirit. They fully accept the Tannaitic-Amoraic interpretatio of the Torah, but are afraid</page><page sequence="19">[19] ON INTERPRETATION 101 of any other interpretatio: it might lead to undermining the authority of the established, to breaking up the monolithic unit of tradition. Identity judgment, repetitive continuation they accept. Interpretatio in the deeper and broader sense they reject. A second kind which has to be subdivided in various categories, includes those who do not consider themselves responsible for Israel's survival at large or do not even want to see Israel's spirituality continue its course in the arena of history. Chris- tianity's rejection of the "law" is a rejection of interpretatio as achieved by the Bayith Sheni. In Israel, any antinomial tend- ency, ancient or modern, rationalistic or mystical, messianistic or this-worldly reformistic, is fundamentally a refutation of that interpretatio. In recent times, tendencies to start Jewish History with events or movements of modern times, as well as the longing for "bereshit," for a totally new "beginning," are strongly nourished by the deep desire to get rid of the inherited in- terpretatio, fundamentally of that achieved by the Bayith Sheni. This struggle over interpretatio in Jewish thought which assumed various shapes through the ages is one of the greatest struggles in the House of Israel, though not always fully grasped or appreciated by those involved in the battle and their fol- lowers. I will confine myself here to one juxtaposition illustrating the position taken by two men of Israel, Maimonides and Spinoza. One is the Jewish philosopher par excellence,3' while the "Jewishness" of the other is of problematic nature. In both thought (Jewish or general) has reached a peak. One is the master, the other - his rebellious pupil. V From his beginning (The Commentary to the Mishnah) up to his end (Moreh Nebukhim) Maimonides was fighting for estab- lishing in Israel the right, nay, the duty of interpretatio. Accepting the cardinal thesis of the double-facedness of the inherited P3 Recent discussions as to whether Maimonides is to be considered a "philosopher" or not do not make any contribution towards a deeper grasping of Maimonides' intellectual personality and achievement in Judaic thought.</page><page sequence="20">102 RAWIDOWICZ [20] "text" (Biblical and post-Biblical), - the visible (zdhir) and the hidden (batin) -, to him as to Saadya interpretatio (or ta'wil,32 as distinct from shar4, or tafsir) is a duty, a commandment.33 It is no accident that Maimonides set out to elaborate his attitude to interpretatio in his extensive preface to the presenta- tion of the 13 "roots" of Jewish religion ('u.ul shari'atina) in his commentary to the first Mishnah of the last chapter in Sanhedrin.34 For there is a strong link between the struggle over interpretatio and the attempts at formulating the "roots" of Israel. Maimonides distinguishes between three firaq (cat- egories)3s - as regards the understanding of the words of the hcakhamim36 (the Talmudic-Midrashic interpreters) and this is still more applicable to the understanding of the Torah. The first category consists of people who accept the words of the h.akhamim37 "as they are" (in their zgahir) and do not apply to them the method of ta'wil38 at all, the impossible is to them "necessary of existence," because they are ignorant in sciences ('ulum), far from knowledge (Ma'a'rif), have no perfection to be aroused (to knowledge) by themselves; neither have they found an awakener to awaken them;39 they think that the hakhamim 32 The ta'wil in mediaeval Jewish thought is discussed in one chapter of my mentioned Introduction to Jewish Philosophy. 33 Cf. my "Ba'ayath Ha-hagshamah Le-Rav Saadya Gaon ve-la-Rambam," Keneseth, 1938, p. 324 ff. 34 Here the original text of the Holzer edition is used: -'mno p? pn p6i mi=n W"$2 nrnm l btHa v nm-n'y Ipnyln=2 ,n-y 1162l .-Xtr I11DI '- 1"n -In 1n 1 2,',nonn r'onn I'ln. ... ?ny~x?n... 1m mpn, ''pn nma. 35 Maimonides starts with firaq for category, group; then continues with ta'ifat (which has also a religious connotation). 36 Ibid., pp. 8 ff. 37 Maimonides does not translate this term into Arabic: ibid., p. 7: 1N o 'YD" V) * n nri m . Otherwise in the whole text: ' o ~D n i . Later, when speaking of their worthiness as scholars in general, he uses - only once here, in contradistinction to this traditional term - the term 1D6y (ibid., p. 9). 38 The translator Salomon b. Yoseph ibn Ya'kub of Saragossa translates here ',',n :nno ritm '. The distinctiveness of the various terms for commenting as used by Maimonides (and other Judeo-Arabic writers) is unfortunately lost in most if not all Hebrew translations from Arabic. 39 Maimonides returns afterwards in other works to the two sources of wisdom or knowledge, the one originating in the wise (or good), the other</page><page sequence="21">[21] ON INTERPRETATION 103 meant in their sayings only what they understand in them, their zahir, though what is "visible" from some of their words would arouse amazement with the ignorant ('aw'am 'alna's) and still more so with the Mlite (khawas). These poor people ('alta'ifat 'almaskina't) believe that they honor the .akhamim while they lower them to the lowest degree, and, by God, they destroy the "beauty" of the Torah, (mahasin 'aldin), obscure its light. God said about the laws of the Torah4o that the nations hearing all the laws will say that only a clever and wise people is this great nation, while the nations, when hearing the words of the hakhamim as presented (in their zahir) by this people would say: only a silly people is this little nation.4~ Maimonides thinks that these preachers42 would have done better if they would have kept silent or would have admitted (when preaching about certain 'Aggadoth) that they do not understand the purpose of the hakhamim in those statements, neither how they should be interpreted. The second group (ta'ifat), also numerous, consists of people who accept the zdhir of the words of the bakhamim as their real purpose, and mock at them,43 considering themselves intellectually superior to the hakhamim.44 Maimonides identifies the men of the second group, the "cursed" one, with those connected with coming through instruction. Cf. Mishneh Torah, Hilkhoth De'oth, I, 2; Moreh Nebukhim II, 29. 40 Ibid., p. 8: ?,rvnn s onnr ', (Hebrew translation: nmo'nn nrn-n). 41 Ibid.: Maimonides turned (Deut. 4.6, rnm l? nmn mn lr=1 an oy pi) exactly into its opposite: ln rPiin ' 1=n ~bo op pi [N]i?p ...; the opposing of ?33 to Ip= is not without interest. 42 In the original: p1,n1tv . Maimonides did not change his negative attitude to them in his old age. Cf., e. g., Moreh Nebukhim, III, 59, II, 29; there these "preachers" are joined - for disrespect - by the poor commentators who think that the knowledge of the sharlz of the words is the wisdom (or knowl- edge) - which is of singular relevance to the discussion of our problem: 43 Here Maimonides interposes (?) a Hebrew phrase into the description of this ta'ifat, ibid. 9: Dom9n "131 ?y 1ry ,,. 44 Their "superiority" is both in 'aql and d.ihn, ibid. 9: pp ormN iotyri l n "vi ,'m onU.-</page><page sequence="22">104 RAWIDOWICZ [22] medicine and astrology who are philosophers in their own eyes.4s He considers them more ignorant than those of the first ta'ifat. Were they trained in science, so that they would have known how things should be said to the vulgar (kumhur) and to the Mlite (khawas) in matters pertaining to God, etc. and had they understood the practical part of philosophy, then it would have become clear to them whether the hakhamim are scholars ('ulama') or not and the meaning of their words would have been understood by them. In contrast to these two groups Maimonides describes the third ta'ifat, the ideal one, i. e., those who accept the principle of interpretatio. This body, Maimonides says, consists of so very few that one can not describe it as a ta'ifat except in the way we call the sun a species (nau').46 They are men to whom the greatness of the h.akhamim and the "goodness" of their thinking has been established. They know that the hakhamim have reached the truth and knew the impossibility of the impossible and the existence of the necessary. They realize that the hakhamim do not talk "nonsense"47 and that their words have a zahir and a bd.tin, and whenever they speak of things impossible they do so in the fashion of riddle and simile. Here Maimonides finds support in the opening of the book of the head of the wise men (ra'is alhukama) where mashal and hidah occur.48 Mai- 45 Ibid.: ~ oh t pn i lvltr 4 1,in pnymmtn - n ID Yp, l 0i -1 . Maimonides had little respect for his professional colleagues, who know "only" medicine. He often took the opportunity to underline his sharp rejection of astrology. E. g., Mishneh Torah, Hilkhoth 'Abodah Zarah II, 1; Moreh Nebukhim, III, 37; his letter to the Jews of Marseilles. 46 For the second time in his analysis of the three firaq he underlines his emphasis by adding "by God" to his statement about the extreme smallness of this ta'ifat: N75 R,1p ni a '1*m l tj6n0i fitfnt l, this time God is invoked for an enthusiastically positive statement. 47 Ibid., p. 10: anm 's p~mn, ar o"y013H N1' a m e. 48 Ibid.: anorm w mn vai7 rnx,?vl l'n14x - tpl ... namnz 1 -X tmcl, Prov. 1.6. Maimonides finds support in Prov. 1.6 also in his opening of the first part of his Moreh Nebukhim (~miN t4 ri - 1T 7 !) in discussing the problem of interpreting the mashal. There he also quotes in this context the relevant mashal-verses from Hoeea (12.11) and Ezek. (17.2, 21.5). Here, in referring to the pure linguistic meaning of Fidah he quotes Samson, Judg. 14.12 (nrinrn</page><page sequence="23">[23] ON INTERPRETATION 105 monides takes for granted that he who "knows language" knows that 4idah is a statement the purpose of which is in its batin not in its zahir. For the sayings of all men of science49 "in the higher matters" are but riddle and simile. The author of Prov- erbs, Song of Songs and IKohelethso - who "did this" by Ruab Ha-K.odesh is here called upon to justify the method of the wise men in the exposition of their wisdom. What does interpretatio (ta'wil) intend to achieve? It intends to "take out" the words of the 4akhamim "from" their zahir so that they will conform to reason, truth, and the Bible.5' Maimonides points here to the employment of ta'wil by the hakhamim to the Bible - "taking them out from their zahir," turning them into similes, "which is the truth" (alhaq), as a justification for his interpretatio of the words of the 4akhamim. Maimonides asks his reader that if he be one of the two first firaq he should not pay attention to any of his words in this matter, for they would not only not suit him, they would even harm him and he would hate them, as it is with a man used to bad and heavy food when given light and "balanced" food. (The Hebrews in the desert used to onion, garlic and fish in Egypt who complained about the Manna in the desert, Num. 11. 5 ff., furnish Maimonides with a suitable illustration for his food analogy). If you are, Maimonides concludes this passage, one of the third firqat, and when you come across something of their sayings which 'akl (ratio) would not accept, you will "stand still" at it and you will know that it is a riddle and a simile, you will lie down perturbed at heart, searching the mind in its interpretatio (ta'wil), pondering to find the way of truth and the notion of rightness, then you will look into my words which will be useful, God wishing ('in sha'a 'allah ta'ali). nrn m Nm). This verse is not quoted in Moreh Nebukhim, though Samson is there referred to in the discussion of the first "degree" of prophecy (II, 48). 49 The translator translates b~yNba nit: =oDln, which is misleading, as by m'lfn Maimonides here always means the men of 'Aggadah and Halakhah.

It was the urge for interpretatio which animated all his work. He was one of those very few of the third firqat. In him this firqat found one of its most perfect representatives--to be emulated later on by his followers, rejected violently by his opponents. His mastery as an in- terpretator found its expression in all his work, to reach its peak in the Moreh Nebukhim on the one hand,52 on the other in Mishneh Torah - this great "summing up" interpretatio by the leading mind of mediaeval Jewry of the greatest interpretatio of Israel, its work between the days of the Babylonian-Palestinian Ezra and the Babylonian Geonim. This interpretatio of Mai- monides still waits in many ways for the revealing and deci- phering interpretatio - of its philosophy, structure, its z.dhir and batin, that which is "summed up" in it as well as that which did not find its way into it. These two monuments of Maimonides' interpretatio are to be studied together, without asking which of the two was more "important," "decisive" for Maimonides, which came nearer to his own heart. As Maimonides was one and indivisible - to the extent creative, thinking, interpreting man is one, - so is his work (notwithstanding differences of purpose, frame of reference, and time), so are the Mishneh Torah and Moreh Nebukhim. Though varied in central purpose and subject-matter it is interpretatio they share as a common decisive stimulus that brings them so close to each other. They will always stand out as a testimony to Israel's faith in interpretatio, to Israel's capability of interpretatio. VI Many were the opponents of Maimonides' interpretatio-- the "literalists," traditionalists of various shades - in his own days and in the subsequent centuries. On the eve of modern times there stands out one opponent of Maimonides, to whom he was very much indebted, against whom he rebelled so ve- hemently, a "literalist" of a new kind, without the faith of the 52 Cf. also the Introduction to the first part of the Moreh Nebukhim.</page><page sequence="25">[25] ON INTERPRETATION 107 mediaeval anti-Maimonides literalists: Baruch Spinoza. Viewed from the perspective of our problem, one of the strongest and most polemical motives of the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus (1670) is Spinoza's passionate rejection of interpretatio as it was advocated and practiced by his predecessors in Israel from Ezra to Maimonides and his followers. Spinoza states clearly his main purpose in the Praefatio to the Tractatus:s3 Seeing that the natural light (lumen naturale) is despised and even condemned as a source of impiety, humana commenta are given the validity of divine "documents," credulity is extolled as faith, noticing the controversies of philosophers raging in Church and State, he determined to examine Scripture de novo integro et libro animo, without attributing to it doctrines which he does not find in it as clearly as possible.s4 The "simplicity" of the prophets, their non-philosophical character, or irrelevance for speculation, their being confined to piety and morality,ss the inadmissibility of interpreting them with the help of mediaeval ta'wil or similar methods, are some of the main pillars on which the Tractatus is built. Here Spinoza finds the decisive support for the separation of revelation and philosophy, (the main objective of the Tractatuss6) - which men of interpretatio of the revealed religions have identified, trying to demonstrate that the "message" of the one could in essence be brought to mankind by the other, with little or no serious effort. Spinoza never misses an opportunity to emphasize his stand- point which forbids the attributing of any "doctrine" to the Bible which is not to be found in it clarissime.s7 He states this 53 All references to the Tractatus (for Tractatus Theologico-Politicus) are made to the Bruder edition (B. de Spinoza Opera ... vol. III, Lipsiae, 1846). 54 Ibid., p. 8, ? 20: .. ."et nihil de eadem affirmare nihilique tanquam eius doctrinam admittere, quod ob eadem clarissime non edocerer." ss Ibid., p. 8, ? 21: "Postquam haec novi, facile determinare potui, prophe- tarum auctoritatem in iis tantum pondus habere, quae usum vitae et veram virtutem spectant; ceterum eorum opiniones nos parum tangere." s6 Ibid., Praefatio, p. 8, ? 24 ff. 57 Ibid., p. 103, ? 3: ... "sed contra nihil tamquam Scripturae doctrinam amplecti auderent, quod ab ipsa quam clarissime non edocerentur." Spinoza repeats eleven times in this chapter his warning not to attribute to Scripture any doctrine not stated there "clare," or "clarissime."</page><page sequence="26">108 RAWIDOWICZ [26] his credo in the beginning of the first chapter of the Tractatus - "De prophetia" - : All our statements (about matters concerning the Scripture) can be drawn only from Scripture (ex Scriptura sola); the writings of the prophets are the only source about matters which transcend our intellectus (here Spinoza points also to the non-existence of prophets in his days); thus we should not state or reason from the similes of the prophets, nor attribute to them anything they did not say clearly.ss The full elaboration of Spinoza's approach in this field is to be found in the central chapter (not only for our problem) of the Tractatus - VII, "De interpretatione Scripturae." It is there that he does not confine himself to critical allusions to Mai- monides,59 but undertakes an open frontal attack on him, which takes up a considerable part of the last section of the chapter. The opening of the chapter makes it clear that Spinoza is perturbed by, and very angry at the abuse of Scripture through the "human commentaries," both by the masses (vulgus) who are not anxious to live according to Scripture, and the theologians who wring their inventions (figmenta et placita) from the Scrip- ture,6o the zealous interpreters of Scripture who are more eager to preserve their auctoritas than to arrive at the true meaning of the Scripture. Agitation of the mind, much of the hatred would s58 Ibid., ? 23, 24: There is nothing in Scripture that does not agree with man's understanding, the prophets have taught nothing that is not simple and easily understood by all (... "nisi res admodum simplices, quae ab unoquoque facile percipi poterant"), their teachings would move "maxime" the mind of the masses (multidudinis animus) to obedience to God; thus he became con- vinced of the separation of Scripture and reason: "omnino mihi persuasi, Scripturam rationem absolute liberam relinquere et nihil cum philosophia commune habere, sed tam hanc, quam illam proprio suo talo niti." Ibid., p. 17, ? 7: ...

The current interpretatio of Scripture - under the guise of religion - which he fights here, he calls a great crime. It is not only the religious, social and political evils in society, resulting from the dominant interpretation of Scripture that cause Spinoza to reject all the "human commentaries" of the "divine documents." His "naturalism," his acceptance of natura, gives him a new and safe basis for dealing with Scripture. He is sure that the desired method, his method of Scriptural interpretation not only does not differ from the method of interpreting nature, but both methods are almost the same.6' As the methodus interpretandi naturam examines the history of nature and deduces from it - ut pote ex certis datis - definitions of natural matters (rerum naturalium definitiones), so the method of interpretation of Scripture treats Scripture.62 I am not concerned here with an examination of Spinoza's study of Scripture, but with his attitude towards the "traditional" interpretatio. For our problem it may suffice to say that Spinoza's very conviction of the possibility of the application of the method of nature-interpretation to the study of Scripture bars the way to a meaningful interpretatio, to seeing the real problem in Scripture, where interpretatio is most needed. In elaborating his system of interpreting the Bible Spinoza was certainly guided by the criteria of truth established by Descartes: clarity and distinctiveness. To this extent Spinoza may be described as the first peshat-Jew of modern times, whose preference of peshat is stimulated not only by his reaction against the Jewish tradition of interpretatio, but also - and decisively - by the new mathematico-mechanical outlook which was the basis for his philosophy at large. This "Cartesian" Jew, 61 Ibid., p. 104, 61. 62 Ibid., p. 104, ? 7: ...

Here as in many other places in the Tractatus it is as if Maimonides' statement about hidah and mashal, in the preface to "LHelelk" and in the Moreh Nebukhim, were in front of him while he was writing the book of his great battle. Did this peshat-interpretation help Spinoza in his under- taking? Was he able to arrive at the hoped for ideal of inter- preting the Scripture solely from the Scripture? Did his not attributing to the Bible doctrines which he did not find there clarissime enable him to arrive at a better and closer under- standing of the ancient world, which he tried to understand from "within" only, or, "as it was?" Spinoza showed a deep insight into the problems which face every interpreter of the Bible - particularly when he emphasized the indispensability of his mastery of the Hebrew language for the understanding of the Bible, even for the New Testament.63 Then, however, he had to admit the insurmountable linguistic difficulties in trying to satisfy this fundamental requirement which make this in- dispensability a mere desideratum, hardly ever to be fulfilled.64 Spinoza is, however, not aware of the main difficulty that 63 Ibid., p. 106, ? 15:... "Et quia omnes tam vetreis, quam novi testamenti scriptores Hebraei fuerunt, certum est, historiam linguae Hebraicae prae omnibus necessarium esse, non tantum ad intelligentiam librorum veteris testamenti, qui hac lingua scripti sunt, sed etiam novi; nam quamvis aliis linguis vulgati fuerint, hebraizant tamen". This notwithstanding, though Spinoza was--as far as knowledge of Hebrew was concerned - adequately equipped to examine the New Testa- ment, as he examined the Old Testament, he felt unfit to do so because of his ignorance of Greek, which he does not mention here. Cf. the concluding ? 47 of chap. X, ibid., p. 166. 64 Cf. ibid., pp. 113 ff., ? 47 ff., where Spinoza enumerates the causes of "ambiguities" particular to Hebrew, in addition to those of other languages; also, ibid., p. 112, ? 44 ff. Many of the mediaeval Jewish grammarians and thinkers complained about the "loss" of (ancient) Hebrew and their deficient knowledge of it.

Not only verbal language, but the language of sound and color in all the arts, also demands by its very nature interpretatio; it opens up to the fortunate only through the magic key of interpretatio. The extent of his not being aware of the problem of language as such - of the "hidden" in that "instrument" of self-expression and communication, of the fundamental interconnection between language and thought - which makes itself so strongly felt in his identifying the method of Scriptural interpretatio with the method naturam interpretationis, - becomes particularly manifest when he presents Euclid as a model for the ideal "simplicity" and understanding in general. Near the end of the first part of the seventh chapter, where he elaborates his method of Scripture-interpretatio, before opening the second part in which he examines the views differing from his in this field, Spinoza says: Euclid, who wrote only of very simple and most understandable things, can be understood easily by anyone in any language; we need not have a thorough knowl- edge of his language in order to understand his mens and true opinion; we have not to inquire about the author's life, pursuits, and habits, in what language for whom and when he wrote, the fortuna of his book or its various readings (neque varias eius lectiones) etc. Then he establishes a Euclidean analogy which deserves utmost attention. Here he assures us that what he said about Euclid can be said about all books which deal with things perceptible by their nature. Ergo the mens of Scripture in moral questions and its opinion can easily be obtained from its "history."65 6s Ibid., 118: ? 67, ? 68: "adeoque concludimus, nos mentem Scripturae circa documenta moralia ex ipsius, quam habere possumus, historia facile posse assequi et de vero eius sensu esse certos."</page><page sequence="30">112 RAWIDOWICZ [30] Was Spinoza justified in this analogy between Euclid and Scripture? If Euclid can be easily comprehended by anyone in any language, is it not because his subject matter does not depend on language at all, or in no way to such an extent as the subject matter of the Old and New Testament as well as of some other documents like those of Plato and Aristotle, Homer and the many playwrights - and again that of Spinoza himself? If thought - religious, philosophical, political - could have been expressed by as limited a number of signs, letters, or symbols, as mathematics, interpretatio would not have been the most vexing problem of man almost since his very beginning. Spinoza is not alone in this overlooking of the fundamental difference between mathematics and all kinds of verbal and visual creativity where language is so indispensable - and adds so much to the problems of the documents to be studied and understood. The Spinoza of the Tractatus is here again in line with the Spinoza of the Ethics. There he sets out to deal with human nature and its affections as if they were lines of a geometrical figure.66 Here his faith in peshat blinds him to the very nature of the problem of "de interpretatione Scripturae," a problem which has confronted and will always confront the conscientious reader and student of any literary document, whether revealed by God or man-made, sacred or profane, old or new. Spinoza is aware of the great difficulties in his method of interpretation of the Scripture ex ipsius historia, so that he does not hesitate to admit that we are ignorant of the true meaning of the Scripture in many places.67 But he relegates these insurmountable difficulties to the attempts at finding out the meaning mens of the prophets in matters which have to be imagined, of which we can not get a clear and simple concept, since they are not conceivable through themselves.68 In his peshat-optimism he proclaims proudly: matters which are easily conceivable through themselves will always be easily under- 66 Ethica . . 67 Tractatus, 118, ? 65: ...

On the one hand Spinoza is confident that he has established the true method of Scriptural interpretation,7o dismissing matters in the Scripture which we can not get with the help of ratio and intellectus as being more of curiositas than of utilitas. The teachings (documenta) of true pietas are expressed in most ordinary words (verbis usitatissimis) and understood simply and easily. As true salvation (vera salus) and blessedness (beatitudo) consist in a true assent of the soul, we can gain certainty about the mens of the Scripture in (matters) concerning the two - and we need not trouble ourselves with other matters which we do not grasp by ratio and intellectus. Yet, these other matters - the reliqua - are just where the problem of interpretatio starts, where interpretatio becomes a most urgent task, this is when "de interpretatione Scripturae" ought to have begun to "dig." These reliqua, the Cartesian peshat-Jew of the 17th century, the admirer of Euclid who can be understood in any language (as a matter of fact, almost without any language) was unable - or unwilling - to see. On the other hand, with all the confidence in his approach to the Scripture, Spinoza admits that his "true method" of Scriptural interpretation, which requires "only" the aid of lumen naturale, is not sufficient to explain everything in the Scripture. Yet not the method is to blame for this defectus, but the fact that this path has never been used by men, and has thus become difficult and hardly passable7'; in other words, 69 Ibid., p. 118, ? 66. 70 Ibid., 119, ? 69. 7' Ibid., p. 119, ? 70: ..."quod via, quam veram et rectam esse docet, nunquam fuerit culta, nec ab hominibus trita, adeoque succesu temporis admodum ardua et fere invia facta sit" ... At the end of chap. VII, Spinoza describes his method of interpretation as the best and twice underlines that the cause of its "difficulties" does not lie in the nature of the method but only in the carelessness (socordia) of men who neglected the "history" of the Bible at a time when the necessary material for study was still available;</page><page sequence="32">114 RAWIDOWICZ [32] because of the negligence of men in this field, the right via was not taken, but the via dolorosa of the traditional interpretatio. This via of the "true method" did not bring even its originator to the "promised land" of an adequately understood Scripture. For about five years before the publication of the Tractatus, Spinoza confessed that he never understood the Scripture, though he has studied it for a number of years.7" Notwith- standing the impassability of the via urged by him, Spinoza rejects sharply the traditional methods of interpretatio - and Maimonides gets the lion's share of the attack. He dismisses sharply Maimonides' method of interpretatio, not only as useless (plane inutilis; this adjective is used here twice by Spinoza, in two neighboring paragraphs) but also as harmful and absurd.73 Spinoza rejects Maimonides' method of the metaphorical in- terpretatio of Biblical sayings that contradict reason (quoting Maimonides' statement about the interpretation of the Biblical texts in connection with the problem of the eternity of matter or creatio ex nihilo, in Moreh Nebukhim I , XXV), his acceptance of a dominant agreement among the prophets, and their perfec- tion as philosophers and theologians; also his thesis that the true meaning of the Bible can not be found in the Bible itself and should not be sought there.74 More than that, he is also the defender of the masses (vulgus) against Maimonides, whose method would make them dependent for the understanding of the Bible on the philosophers, depriving them of the certainty which they can get by their simple reading (ex sincera lectione). Spinoza's indebtedness (and "ingratitude") to Maimonides once he even adds malice to carelessness on the part of these men, ibid., p. 120, ? 73; p. 125, ? 94. 72 Cf. Spinoza's letter to Willem van Blyenbergh [January 28, 1665] Opera, ed. Bruder, Vol. II, p. 241, ? 3: "Quod vero me spectat, quia plane et sine ambagibus profiteor, me sacram scripturam non intelligere, licet aliquot annos in ea insumpersim," ... 73 The final sentence of the Maimonides criticism in ? 87, ibid., p. 123: "Qua propter hanc Maimonidae sententiam [in ? 86: haec methodus] ut noxiam, inutilem et absurdam explodimus." 74 Ibid., pp. 122-23; ? 84: "Quare ex sententia Maimonidae neque eius verus sensus ex ipsa constare potest, adeoque neque ab ipsa erit petendus." This statement too needs revision.</page><page sequence="33">[33] ON INTERPRETATION 115 was often emphasized, especially since the middle of the 19th century. It seems to me that the elucidation of the contrast between Maimonides' and Spinoza's attitude to interpretatio would open a way to a somewhat deeper understanding of Spinoza's rebellion against Maimonides. He was to him - rightly - not only the symbol of philosophic interpretatio, trying to solve the age-old problem of Reason-Revelation through the via interpretativa. He saw in him also the symbol of the continuation of the interpretatio of the Pharisees.75 This second aspect in Maimonides is to Spinoza of singular relevance. To examine Spinoza's attack on Maimonides would demand a detailed analysis of their respective philosophical standpoints, their concepts of natura, prophets and prophecy, and Israel at large. This is not our concern here. It is rather to point to the meaning of Spinoza's rejection of the interpretatio of both Maimonides and the Pharisees (whom he twice couples with the Popes, once using one against the other - let the one demolish the other);76 and especially to indicate the results from his own "true method" for the understanding of Israel's existence, the connection between his method and his idea of the Torah, which was of such great importance for the development of the concept of Judaism in the post-Spinoza centuries, in and outside Israel. VII To what extent did Spinoza succeed or fail in his "true method" of Scriptural interpretation, how far was he - could he be - consistent, or how far was his criticism of his opponents justified - these problems, as well as questions concerning the relevance of his understanding of the Bible to his world of thought in general, need a special study. As has been hinted, Spinoza's 75 Spinoza justly describes Maimonides as a Pharisee, but he is mistaken when he considers him the first of the Pharisees to demand the "accommoda- tion" of the Scripture to ratio (chap. XV, ibid., p. 198, ? 4, where Yehudah Alfakhar is introduced as the representative of the majority of the - medi- aeval - Pharisees who dissented from Maimonides in this respect). 76 Ibid., p. 111, ? 38; p. 123, ? 88.</page><page sequence="34">116 RAWIDOWICZ [34] "literalism" arouses many problems. All that can be argued - justly - against a concept of history or rather a system of historiography such as this of Leopold v. Ranke, who was sure he saw and described things of the past "as they were" (whom Johann Gustav Droysen called a "eunuch of objectivity") can with no less vigor be said against the peshat-method of the author of the Tractatus. Spinoza's limiting of Bible interpretation to a kind of purely immanent reading of the "text" - which practically has to be satisfied with a partial interpretation, ignoring many if not most of the "difficulties" of the Bible, amounts to a rejection of a deciphering, widening, re-shaping interpretation, i. e., of in- terpretatio as such. It is a kind of explanatio which leaves - even within its own system - most of the problems, especially the most relevant and thorny ones, unexplained. Spinoza fights for the understanding of the Bible from within in such a way that the "within" neither discloses itself fully to its interpretator nor is "encouraged" to open itself, to go on struggling for its survival. Spinoza not only expels Maimonides' ratio from the field of Biblical interpretation, in fact, he goes much further in his rejection of the older methods of Bible interpretation. That there is a bdtin, a hidden layer in the revealed text was accepted -with differing emphasis - by mystical as well as by reason-centered Judaic thought, by the Targumim, by Halakhah and 'Aggadah - each one of them applying different methods, using different tools for the dis- covering of the batin. Spinoza rejects the double-facedness of the Bible - and in so doing rejects all the batbin concepts of the past - the bdtin as such which opens the way to interpretatio that "does something," that uproots and builds, sustains and en- livens an old and inherited text and its world of ideas and values. Interpretatio in its perfect sense - as said -is impossible where the batin is so fundamentally excluded. Interpretatio bridges the gap between past and present, the interpreted "text" (the interpreted world in it) and the present of the interpretator. He transfers himself to the past to find the "point" where the present could be linked up. He revives the past, strengthens the present. Interpretatio means here: continuation,</page><page sequence="35">[35] ON INTERPRETATION 117 expanding, welding past and present, through deciphering the bdtin in the light of the zahir - to prepare the ground for a new layer of zdhir and bdtin in the living "text" of those who feel obliged to preserve the old one. It is here an act of renewal from within - and how different is this bdtin-zdhir "within" from the "within" of the Tractatus. It is also as if Spinoza, who could be described as the philosopher of Being (of the Parmenidean type, if one may continue the fundamental distinc- tion between the Parmenidean and Heraclitean schools of thought in "modern" times, and one certainly may), rejected the tradi- tional interpretatio which was too Heraclitean for him, full of movement, movement of the past, of the present to the past, of becoming. From Ezra to Maimonides and his followers interpretatio was a process of continuation of the Bible (the "text" of Israel), which means the extension of its life-force. Spinoza offers an inter- pretation confined to the "within" - with the elimination of the bdtin, ratio and tradition, - to its "language" and "history" (neither of which is fully accessible). This interpretatio narrows the text, "strangles," stultifies it. No Pharisaic perush, no Maimonidic ta'wil, nor any other interpretatio is admissible. This means the "text" remains "as it is," is finished, nothing can and should be "added" -it is isolated, it is bound to disappear in its splendid isolation. This also means, the post- Biblical at large has to confine itself to that which it finds absolutely clear and distinct in the Bible. There is no "talk" of the present with the past, no contact, no clash or conflict which intensify contact, no discussion with the zdhir through the medium of the bdtin, no struggle with the "true meaning" of the past from the perspective of the present, of time old and new. To Spinoza the Scripture was - it is no more, i. e., it is no more in a sense that it can not satisfy all the needs that only science and philosophy are able to. Spinoza did not set out to destroy the Bible. On the contrary, he came to cleanse it from the "dust" of prejudices of the vulgus and "additions" by theologians and philosophers. In the process of this "cleansing," the restoration of the Bible to its "what it is" - it becomes a text that only was, can not be now as it</page><page sequence="36">118 RAWIDOWICZ [36] was.77 Since he does not want to see the Bible as a life-giving body for the future, he embalms it. The Bible is "saved," and becomes petrified. The Tractatus, seen in this light, - the great attack on traditional interpretatio -, is thus also the document of emancipation for Europe and Israel from the Bible, closes the gates for a return to the Bible, terminates the possibility of turning it into a fountain of a revival. In the beginning was the Bible. From now on there is natura, philosophy, where matters are clear and distinct --where there are no "difficulties" of history and language. Only some one like Spinoza, who was ("technically," legally) neither a Jew nor a Christian, (and here lies one of the most vital problems in the understanding of his personality and philosophy, as well as of the rise of the "modern Jew"), - could allow himself to take up such a position. He was not responsible to anybody, to anything, to any tradition - he was the great irresponsible of modern times. He did not come to rescue any past, any tradition (hence his rejection of the "older" inter- pretatio). He was one of the first Jews, if not the first, who did not "belong" anywhere - and he could afford it. He was a man without a yoke (maybe his yokelessness was a matter of envy for many a Jew in later times, though I do not overlook here Spinoza's dependence on the political and philosophical back- ground of his time), a man who could live without one. Deus sive natura - a "jealous God" in his way too - does not put the "usual" voke on his followers. Summa summarum: No perush - means here no continuation, no expansion. No con- tinuation of the Bible - means no survival of post-Biblical Israel. In the light of this analysis one can see that Spinoza's "new method" and rejection of the old one (or ones) is not an isolated effort in his system of theologico-political thought. For it will be possible now to arrive at a deeper understanding of the link between Spinoza's rejection of the Bible interpretation from Ezra to Maimonides and his followers and his concept of the 77About the impossibility and "non-advisability" of the imitatio of the first imperium cf. ibid., chap.

The basis of Spinoza's philosophy of Judaism, of his "Jewish" political philosophy, is the concept that the chosenness of the Hebraea natio by God is not in respect to its intellectus or the tranquilitas of its mind, but in respect to its societas and fortuna as its imperium obtained and kept it so many years; its electio et vocatio confined to the political and social spheres (in sola imperili temporanea felicitate et commodis). We learn from Scrip- ture that the Hebrews surpassed other nations in these spheres only.7" The Torah (leges Mosi) was given for a society, a state, a land. The ceremoniae commanded in the Old Testament were given only for the Hebrews, and were so accommodated to their state that they could be observed mostly only by the whole society; they had nothing to do with beatitudo and virtus, but only with their temporal bodily felicitas and the tranquilitas of their imperium, so that their validity was limited only to the time of the duration of their imperium. The Pharisees in their ignorantia did not arrive at the true meaning of the Mosaic Law which pertained only in the realm of public welfare.79 The land, the state for which the Torah was given, is a conditio sine qua non for its validity and authority. From this thesis Spinoza draws the conclusion that the destruction of the first imperium and the Exile to Babylon meant the end of the claim of the Torah on the Hebrews.8" Three times Spinoza goes here to Jeremiah for support. His "true method" of interpretation does not prevent him from deducing from Jer. 11.2381 that the Hebrews were not obliged to practice their law after the destruc- 78 Ibid., chap. III, p. 51, ?? 16-19; p. 48, ? 3 ff. and in other places. 79 Ibid., chap. V, p. 76, ? 9: ...

XVII, p. 225, ? 30 ff. and in other places. 80 Ibid., chap. xix, p. 254, ?? 13-14. Spinoza considers the second imperium (i. e. that of the interpretatio of the Pharisees) as a mere shadow of the first (ibid., p. 243, ? 113), since the Hebrews of the second imperium were bound to the laws of the Persians to whom they were subject. 8i Tractatus, p. 77, ? 13.</page><page sequence="38">120 RAWIDOWICZ [38] tion of their imperium; as if God would require nothing of them beyond the natural law obligatory for all men. How Spinoza arrives at this conclusion either from Jeremiah's warning against the "boasting" of the heakham, gibbor and 'ashir or from his praise for him who knows God, is a problem in itself. Jer. 29.782 which had been quoted after the destruction of the Second Temple --in conjunction with Jer. 27.9 ff., 22 - as a warning against "pressing for the end,"'3 the coming of Messiah, and in later centuries up to recent times as a support for the acquiescence in the status quo of Galut-existence,84 while preserving the full authority of the Written and Oral Law in all their practical implications - serves Spinoza as another source for his fundamental thesis concerning the abrogation of the Torah: No state - no Torah. Spinoza goes back to the old Davidic concept.8s All Torah became to him a "command- ment that depends on the land." Here Spinoza follows the line of the ancient negators of Exilic Israel's raison d'8tre, foremost Christianity and other sects, for whom the "philosopher" spoke to Rabban Camli'el.86 Israel's survival after the loss of the first imperium, or the continuation of its distinctiveness, is to him sheer obstinacy of the Pharisees, their spiteful opposition to Christianity.87 82 Tractatus, p. 254, ? 14; p. 257, ? 30. 83 Cf.

Some speak of Spinoza as a "dreamer" or a "prophet" of the Return to Zion, as if he were one of those who brought the message of the Return to Zion or even commanded it to Israel.89 They overlook the condition attached in Spinoza's statement on Israel's being chosen again.9o Whatever interpretatio one might tend to give to Spinoza's statement on Israel's future, his attitude to Israel's past between the destruction of the first imperium and his own days and the days to follow, if the miracle does not repeat itself and Israel is not rechosen by God, is absolutely negative.

Oldenburg, who belongs to the unbelievers in these rumors, points to the world catastrophe which might result from such a return (...

Spinoza equates the survival value of circumcision of the Jews and their being preserved "for ever" with the mark on the head of the Chinese, ("qui etiam comma aliquod in capite religiosissime servant") who have often recovered their imperium and will do so again (ibid., ? 56). Among those who hailed in recent times Spinoza's Zion-"vision," George Eliot was probably the most cautious one. Cf.

No interpretation of the Bible of the various traditional kinds means: no expansion, no continuation of the people of the Bible; no meaning, no justification for Israel's survival outside the original "natural" theologico-political "peshat"; no halakhah, no 'aggadah, for the whole Bayith Sheni was just sheer obstinacy, as mentioned, the absolute reversal of natura, still more so all that followed until the year an excommunicated son of Mar- ranos published the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus, 1670. Nega- tion of the "old" method of interpretatio thus results in a rejection of Israel's duty and right to interpretatio, as well as its capacity for interpretatio. VIII This may suffice for my allusion to the two poles in the struggle over interpretatio in Israel. In Maimonides Israel's will and power to interpret reached its peak. Spinoza rejects both Maimonides' Moreh Nebukhim and Mishneh Torah, becomes the fore-runner for all those in Israel (and in the world) who rejected in the last centuries the "old" interpretatio--and consequently the raison d'8tre for Israel's survival, present and future. His Tractatus is thus to be viewed as heralding a turning point in the political philosophy concerning Israel's past and future. From this perspective, all subsequent discussion in Israel and about Israel, inside and outside Israel, by individual thinkers or by religious and political movements, is at its source a discus- sion concerning the theological and political meaning of Israel's past and future. Practically it is either acceptance or rejection of the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus. Since 1670 each genera- tion adds a page of its own to the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus of Israel. Some of these additional pages would have found the approval of Baruch Spinoza, some would have encouraged him to renew his fight against the "old" method of interpretatio, to write part two of his Tractatus. The adding of page after page to the Tractatus Theologico-Politicus goes on - until our own days.</page><page sequence="41">[41] ON INTERPRETATION 123 It ought to have become obvious by now that I view the interpretatio problem as the central one in Jewish thought. In most of its periods it is deeply linked with the attitude to ratio, to the Revelation-Reason problem in its broadest meaning. On the whole, this problem transcends the boundaries of mere theological or religious speculation. Here one illustration for the continuation of the problem of interpretatio may suffice. The two poles of mediaeval Jewish thought (also of the antagonism between Maimunists and anti- Maimunists) found their modern expression in two 19th century Jewish thinkers: the Italian Samuel David Luzzatto and the Galician Nachman Krochmal. Luzzatto, the sharpest opponent of Spinoza in 19th century Jewish learning, almost repeated Spinoza's words when he rejected - in his introduction to his commentary on Isaiah (in which he singles out Spinoza for one of his very sharp rebukes) - any attempt to find in the Bible support for beliefs and ideas which we get from other sources, not even traditional beliefs current in the nation.9' It was probably his opposition to Maimonides which made him share here to some extent the platform with Spinoza. In line with his above mentioned principle in his commentary on Isaiah, he comes again nearer to Spinoza than to Maimonides and his school when he emphatically rejects any kind of multi-facedness of the Torah.92 Here--in the implied rejection of bdtin in 9' Padova, 1855 . ..

How different was Krochmal's attitude not only to Maimonides but also to perush in general. If his Moreh Nebukhei Ha-zeman would not have remained a torso, especially if its planned second part would have been written (or reached us) and would have contained the purely philosophical "she'arim," the missing parts of his opus which are as of now beyond any hope of being recovered, Krochmal the interpretator (in our definition) would have emerged in a still more conspicuous way than he does. But even so, as he stands before us now, Krochmal deserves a prominent place in the realm of Jewish thinkers who accepted interpretatio and fought for it wholeheartedly.94 As I said at the outset of my deliberations, interpretatio is the central problem of all civilization, religion and philosophy, man and all his activities at large. In a still greater measure, and in an additional sense, it is a problem for Israel, the problem for Israel - the group and its individuals and their movements of all kinds. As long as Israel is alive it will start its definitive 93 Cf. Part One in Babylon and Jerusalem, pp. 83 ff., 94. 94 Cf., e. g., Moreh Nebukhei Ha-zeman, in Kithbei R. Nachman Krochmal 1924, pp. 191, 197-99. In my analysis of Krochmal (in the Introduction to Kithbei R. Nachman Krochmal) I tried to draw the attention of students to Krochmal the revolu- tionary from within (cf. ibid., chap. II, especially p. 159). It still seems to me that here lies his main relevance and value for Jewish thought and life of his century - and not in his adoption of the one philosophical school in modern Germany or the other. Hence my emphasis on the rejection of Krochmal's "Hegelianism" - which was and is apt to obscure the main aspect of Kroch- mal's personality and efforts in the field of Jewish thought. Students of Krochmal would do better to deepen the understanding of Krochmal the inter- pretator than to point repeatedly to a part of his "terminology" which puts him in one philosophic school or another in the German world of his days.</page><page sequence="43">[43] ON INTERPRETATION 125 beginning with Sinai - including that earlier period which prepared the ground for it; it will always try to "reconquer" Sinai. Yet Israel lives in a non-Sinai world. It can not exist in this world, old or new, without interpretatio of Sinai. Here it is not the pressure from outside that is decisive; the adjustment to the outside is certainly not the best of stimuli for a constructive and stabilizing interpretatio. Of greater importance is the pressure from within, within Sinai, the inner stimulus for a more adequate understanding and evaluation of oneself and the world. This interpretatio is Israel's creatio continua. This is where Israel has been making - and will have to make - its greatest effort to preserve Sinai in all its implications, to dig and dig in Sinai in order to discover in it the opening of a better grasping of the not yet deciphered batin of Sinai's past, as well as of a compat- ibility with the outside-Sinai, some kind of acceptance of the Non-Sinai within Sinai - on the basis of Sinai. The men of interpretatio - from Ezra till our own days, since the days of the ma'amad Sinai, according to R. Yehudah Ha- Nasi' - have preserved Israel's thought from "Karaization," from being stifled through limiting literalism and fear-filled peshatism. It is they who in different ways expanded Israel's Sinai, Sinai for Israel, and thus strengthened Israel's capacity and will for survival. As Maimonides said, the men of the third firqat, the interpreters, are very rare. But it was what emanated from their struggle for the right and duty of inter- pretatio - whether they achieved their objective or not - that sustained Israel since it started its way after the ma'amad Sinai, especially since the great disaster after the loss of the first Judean State.95 Interpret or perish - is the voice Israel hears incessantly since Sinai; still earlier, since its beginning, since 9s The struggle between "freezing" and "de-freezing" interpretatio in Israel - in older and modern times, - deserves a study in itself. It should also be added that interpretatio as described here - especially as a trend of thought that comes to "reshape" Israel from within, which is not decisively "indebted" in its essence to a particular outside pressure, is not to be indentified with the concept of "reform" as developed in modern Israel, in various ways, from the 19th century onwards.</page><page sequence="44">126 RAWIDOWICZ [441 the covenant with Abraham while still holekh 'ariri,96 in that hour of his fear of cessation, of no-survival, because of the lack of an heir - the fear of almost every generation in Israel since the "Father of the Nation." But is interpret or perish a cat- egorical imperative for Israel alone? Not for man at large - as a thinking and feeling, doing and communicating being, inheriting and transmitting, forming, shaping and reshaping tradition? The principles and methods of the first layer in Israel's interpretatio, in JHalakhah and 'Aggadah, their hermeneutics in all their minute details and conditioning circumstances, have to be scrutinized in all their implications. Of still greater urgency - in so far as one is allowed to speak of degrees of urgency in learning - is, however, the study of the very phenomenon of interpretatio in its totality - particularly the interpretatio of the Bible and the Bayith Rishon in Halakhah and 'Aggadah, in the Bayith Sheni in its entirety, as well as in Jewish Mysticism, then of the Bayith Sheni and the Oral Law in their turn in the centuries that followed the destruction of the Bayith Sheni up to our own days, be it in systems of thought by individual thinkers (or interpreters), be it in religious and political move- ments which represent interpretatio's meaning, purpose, relevance for Israel's struggle to survive. To get at the sources of Israel's interpretatio, to study its laws, decipher the bd.tin that underlies it to the ultimate degree (without neglecting in any way the scrutinizing of the zdhir work of Israel), is the task of Jewish Learning in our days, and in the days to follow. To learn from Jewish Learning the secret of Israel's interpretatio, in order to help Israel preserve its passion for interpretatio, strengthen its capacity for interpretatio - this is the duty of the spiritual and political movements which shoulder the responsibility for Israel's survival. Here - and not here alone - learning and living are inseparable (and not in Israel alone). Both stand and fall with the rise and decline of interpretatio; one law for the two: interpretatio. 96 Gen. 15.2.</page></plain_text>
