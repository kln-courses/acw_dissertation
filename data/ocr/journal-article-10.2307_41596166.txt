<plain_text><page sequence="1">From Athletes to Zebras- Young Children Want to Read About Them Dorothy Kirsch If you find it difficult to hold the atten- tion of first and second graders when you read a story to them . . . Or if you are frustrated when you try to teach low reading level second graders by using a first grade reader . . . Take a closer look at your materials. Although the book is of special impor- tance to the young, both as a vehicle for reading instruction and as a transmitter of cultural patterns, the reading interests of young children, first and second graders on the threshold of reading experience, have, for the most part, not been widely investi- gated. Researchers have been inclined to draw inferences for this age group from the classic studies of the 40s and 50s, which dealt with the interests of older children (Zimet, 1966). Only recently have Wiberg and Trost (1970), and Rose, Zimet, and Blom (1972) investigated the interests of first grade children, but from the view- point of matching content of first grade readers with interests as manifested in free choice library selections. Sex was viewed as an interest determinant in these studies, but other variables were not investigated. The reading interests of young black chil- dren have been analyzed by a few re- searchers (Antley and Fluitt, 1966; Row, 1968 ) , but the reading interests of Spanish- surnamed children, as far as can be deter- mined, have not been examined. Another element which apparently has not been studied is the derivation of reading inter- ests, the source from which the interests spring. In the study summarized here, three spe- cific factors were investigated: (1) the expressed reading interests of first and second grade children from different geo- graphic areas of the United States and with differing racial, ethnic, and socio-economic backgrounds; (2) comparisons of expressed reading interests of children in grades one and two; and (3) derivation of the chil- dren's reading interests. Sample and Locations The subjects were 1,078 first and second grade children and included black, white, Spanish-surnamed, and a small sample of "other ethnic groups." The population trends of the 1970 United States Census, in which the metropolitan area showed large population gains, was used as a basis for selection of locations. Two schools were selected in each of three "inner city" areas, together with two schools in nearby suburbs. Twelve schools thus represented the following areas: New York City and the suburbs of Glen Cove, Long Island and Roosevelt, Long Island; Detroit and the Dorothy Kirsch is Reading Specialist for the Glen Cove Public Schools, New York. 73</page><page sequence="2">74 Elementary English suburb of Inkster; Los Angeles and Culver City. The city and suburban schools in each metropolitan area were matched to achieve, as far as possible, an equivalent racial and socio-economic composition. The racial- ethnic composition included 465 whites, 471 blacks, 123 Spanish-surnamed, and 19 of "other ethnic groups." There was an almost equal distribution of first and second graders, as well as boys and girls. Procedures Children were interviewed individually and were asked initially to draw a picture showing what they would like most to read or have read to them. Following completion of the drawing, a structured interview was conducted; the form of the interview was adapted to the specific drawing the child completed. The interview was structured so as to elicit the child's general area of reading interest and, where possible, the derivation of that interest. The technique of drawing, plus interview, was used be- cause it created a quick rapport; children were able to transfer easily from expression in drawing to a verbal response, and the procedure was relatively fast. Following the interview, the Draw-a-Man Scale, a subdivision of the Goodenough - Harris Drawing Test, was administered to give an indication of the child's I.Q. In- formation on other variables used in the study ( sex, reading ability, racial-ethnic group, socio-economic status, racial-ethnic group of teacher) were obtained either from observation, the teacher, or official school records. The drawings and interviews were sub- sequently arranged into clusters of topics. The topics were then classified according to seven prearranged categories: (1) in- formation scientific; (2) information his- toric; (3) information 1970s; (4) realistic fiction; (5) imaginative fiction; (6) humor; and (7) poetry. (None of the topics fell into the category of poetry. ) These interest categories (outside of poetry) then became the basis of 17 hypotheses which were tested for statistical significance by Chi- Square. Findings: Topics First grade children showed interest in 22 topics. Second grade children were interested in 25 topics; 22 were the same as those chosen by first graders. The three topics most freqeuntly chosen by first and second grade children were identical, but the order of preference differed. The 10 most frequent choices of second grade chil- dren demonstrated a greater interest in factual material than did the 10 most fre- quent choices of first grade children. A few children chose more than one topic. The range of topics chosen by first graders is shown in Figure 1; choices of second graders are depicted in Figure 2. Findings: Categories Significant differences in expressed read- ing interests of first grade children were apparently attributable to sex (p &lt; .01), I Q- (p &lt; 05), and reading level (p &lt; .01 ), but geographical area, urban-suburban location, racial-ethnic group, socio-economic level, and race of teacher did not appear to affect reading interest significantly. Dif- ferences tended to be in proportion of interest shown in categories: all groups ranked (1) realistic fiction; (2) imaginative fiction; (3) information scientific; (4) in- formation 1970s; (5) humor; and (6) in- formation historic. Girls showed greater interest in "realistic fiction" and less in "in- formation 1970s" than boys.

In second grade, the four most popular categories were allotted almost equal pro- portions of interest. Sex (p &lt; .01) and racial-ethnic group ( p &lt; .05) appeared to affect reading interests significantly. Girls showed more interest in fiction than did boys. Black children displayed more interest in "imaginative fiction" than others; Spanish-surnamed children showed a great- er preference for "realistic fiction" than others; white children showed a greater preference for "information scientific" and "information 1970s" than the other groups. Significant differences (p &lt; .01) in read- ing interest existed between first and second grade children. First graders were most interested in fiction; second graders were more interested in factual topics. All chil- dren showed little interest in "information historic" and "humor," and, as mentioned earlier, none in "poetry."

Findings: Derivation of Interest Approximately 28 percent of the children in both grades identified television as the interest source. The same programs were viewed in all geographical areas and the similarity in oategory choices in the three geographic locations may, at least in part, be due to the nation-wide, nonregional in- fluence of television. The influence of television viewing was evident in many of the topics that were chosen. Farily tales had been viewed on television, as had monster stories. An inter- est in space could be traced to the "moon walks" seen on TV; most of the sports had been viewed on TV, as had the contem- porary personalities. Other named sources of interest included trips, both family and school-directed, the family pet, the classroom teacher, model "kits," phonograph records, trade books, and to a lesser degree, the basal reader. Twenty percent of the children could not trace the source of reading interest. Discussion Although the first three topic choices of both first and second grade children (stories about children, animals, and fairy tales) appear at first glance to approximate the topics often chosen to read to children or subjects represented in basal readers, a more perceptive examination reveals ap- parent differences. "Stories about children" is first choice of first graders, with 96 children professing interest in it. In second grade, only 38 children appear to be interested in this type of realistic fiction. "Animals," it was learned</page><page sequence="6">78 Elementary English in the structured interviews, meant infor- mation about the care of a large variety of animals, including pets and zoo animals, rather than the anthropomorphic "talking animals" which are usually found in basais and in books read to young children. "Talk- ing animals" actually ranked sixth with first grade children and fifth with second graders. "Fairy tales" included the old favorites, but a modern version of the fairy tale appears to be the monster story, or stories about superhuman personalities, which ranked eighth with first graders and eleventh with second grade children. The desire to read for information about a variety of subjects is not reflected in the content of first grade readers (Blom and others, 1972) nor does it appear to be, to this investigators knowledge, reflected in the usual array of stories read to young children. First graders chose 12 factual topics and 10 fictional ones; second graders named 14 factual topics and 11 fictional ones. Moreover, the proportion of children expressing interest in factual topics rose from 32.20 percent in first grade to a sur- prising 50.75 percent in second grade. Ranking seventh with first graders and fourth with second grade children was "how to operate vehicles and mechanical objects" in which children expressed in- terest in reading factual information about such manifestations of the 70s as jet planes, helioopters, robots, dune buggies, and hot rods. Other requests for factual information included queries on TV, sports personalities, and vocations. Thus, in order to provide interesting reading material for young children, teach- ers and curriculum planners must be aware of the surprising breadth and sophistication of primary children's reading interests as well as the differencés in preference which are exhibited from group to group. Recog- nition that there is a relationship between the child's TV viewing and his/her reading preferences provides an additional insight into reading interests. Of particular importance is the statis- tically significant difference in category preferences between first and second grade children, including second graders reading at a low reading level. The second grade group, as previously noted, appeared to have veered from fictional preferences to factual ones. The plight of the low reader in second grade, placed in first grade basais for instructional purposes, is thus sharply delineated. The content of the first grade reader, while of possible marginal interest to first grade children, appears to be totally devoid of interest for this second grade group.^ Don't stick to what you enjoyed most as a child or what was learned about the interests of children 20 or 30 years ago. Look closely at the reading interests of the children of the 1970s! Reference Antley, Elizabeth Martin and Fluitt, Ann L.
