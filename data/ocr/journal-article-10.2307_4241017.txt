<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE REMAKING OF LA JETEE'S TIME-TRAVEL NARRATIVE 383 Elena Del Rio The Remaking of La Jetee 's Time-Travel Narrative: Twelve Monkeys and the Rhetoric of Absolute Visibility Here I was born.... and there I die. (Kim Novak pointing at the tree marks in Alfred Hitchcock's Vertigo) Terry Gilliam, director of Twelve Monkeys (1995), claims to have drawn inspiration for his film's story from La Jetee, a French film made by Swiss filmmaker Chris Marker in 1962. Despite sharing an ostensibly similar plot, the formal differences between these two time-travel narratives are remarkable. Twelve Monkeys presents no substantial deviations from classical narrative cinema. Running for a little over two hours, the color film's moving images dramatize the rather formulaic predicament of a goal-oriented hero. In addition, its strong degree of closure erases the most disturbing aspects of its own circular time frame. La Jetee, by contrast, breaks with most of the normative expecta- tions and conventions of narrative cinema. With the exception of a single mobile shot in the midst of its story, this twenty-seven-minute film consists of an uninterrupted succession of black-and-white still images that stubbornly resists the customary narrative investment in the fulfillment of a purposeful goal. Instead, through the static quality of its images, La Jete'e conceives of human desire as a rigid fixation whose reality is anchored in the past (the temporal mode of loss) more firmly than in the future (the temporal mode of fulfillment). Although the greatest difference between these films is to be found at the level of discourse-in the enunciative modes that convey their particular points of view about their stories-a brief description of their plots might be useful in identifying some events and narrative devices that are unique to each film. La Jetee's narrative is set in the aftermath of WW III, when a handful of survivors have taken shelter underground from the deadly effects of radio-activity. A group of scientists performs experiments on those subjects who are naturally inclined to remembering strong images from the past. The aim of these experiments is to perfect the scientific and psychological mechanisms of time travel into the past so as to be able to apply the same principles to time travel into the future. By traveling into the future, the scientists intend to acquire the knowledge and the technology necessary to change the dismal prospects of civilization in the present. As he travels into the past, the subject chosen for the experiment becomes involved with a woman and eventually refuses the offer to inhabit the world of the future. In the film's concluding scene, the man is shot by someone from the underground camp as he and the woman meet at the airport. This closing scene fulfills the half premonition/half memory featured in the opening scene, where a child-presumably the time traveler himself- unwittingly witnesses a man's death-his own-on the airport jetty. To this tightly structured story, Twelve Monkeys adds a number of plot elements whose function seems to be to encourage identification from mainstream audiences. The film firmly secures the viewer's receptivity towards</page><page sequence="2">384 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) its perspective by shifting its discursive focus away from a self-reflexive aesthetics of contemplation to a somewhat sensationalized representation of social and ethical questions. For example, instead of the dread of a Third World War-a major threat at the time La Jetee was produced-Twelve Monkeys imagines the possibility of a world-wide catastrophe through the global unleashing of a deadly virus. In this film, the scientific community of the future is correlated with a group of scientists in the past, among whom the time traveler finds his love object-a woman psychiatrist. The all-encompassing presence of the scientific community in Twelve Monkeys establishes a rationalizing discourse that is altogether absent in the former film. Furthermore, the film links its intrigue of apocalyptic disaster to the hot issue of animal rights activism and environmentalist politics.' On a more general visual plane, the contemporary feel of Twelve Monkeys is no less dramatically achieved through a mise-en-scene of urban decay, violence, and homelessness, featuring a 1996 American metropolis whose dystopian landscape is amply familiar to contemporary viewers. Finally, even though Twelve Monkeys's narrative structure is, like La Jetee's, circular, the film adds an epilogue that seems to imply that the overseeing community of "good" scientists from the future will ensure that the virus is kept at bay. Although the apparent purpose of this coda might be to tie together the complex narrative threads woven throughout the film, it more crucially serves as an index of the film's unconscious discourse on our culture's troubled relationship with death. From this cursory comparison alone, one is likely to suspect that the French film is discursively and aesthetically more engaging. The argument I wish to make, however, does not involve a value judgment as to which film one should prefer. Rather, this comparative analysis will seek to disprove the ideologically- charged claim that cinematic representation-and representation in general- simply involves epistemological and practical command of a set of self-evident and unequivocal principles; in other words, that a director will "naturally" prefer to use those shots, angles, and cuts that most effectively reflect the subject at hand. As a reading of these two films demonstrates, each enacts one among different possible representational systems available to the cinema. Having said that, it is clear that the contingent and arbitrary nature of repre- sentation is consistently recognized throughout La Jetee, whereas the discourse of visible mastery and transparency that pervades the Hollywood film requires further probing in terms of the larger philosophical tradition that subtends it. Although I will refer to La Jetee's contrasting rhetorical strategies, this discussion is mainly aimed at establishing the strong commonality between the drive towards visibility and presence enacted in Western representation and mainstream cinema's own mechanisms of expression. To establish these links, I will employ Heidegger's argument regarding the metaphysical undercurrent of representation and Foucault's theory of panopticism. While some film theorists and critics have referred to Foucault's theory of the panopticon either in conjunction with or in opposition to the Lacanian theory of the gaze, Heidegger's ideas are rarely mentioned in film studies. Heidegger's work is nonetheless surprisingly relevant to the critical task of many cultural commen-</page><page sequence="3">THE REMAKING OF LA JETEE'S TIME-TRAVEL NARRATIVE 385 tators today, as he "submits to questioning all crucial terms now circulating undisturbed in TV [and film] theory, especially representation, but also subjectivity, technology, modernity, and (the) world(s)" (Dienst 104). As a reading of almost any Hollywood film might suggest, mainstream narrative cinema is still bent on reproducing the metaphorics of vision and power at work in the ontotheological tradition of Western representation.2 According to philosopher William Spanos, this tradition has engaged in an anthropomorphic spatialization and reification of being: "This reification of existence is a spatialization of time ... it constitutes a willfully coerced metamorphosis of temporality into simultaneous image or picture: an aesthetic structure the model or prototype of which is the ... visual arts" (32). Consonant with the epistemology of truth and beauty of Western metaphysics at large, the representational system at work in classical narrative cinema has favored a notion of existence as presence-the production of a stable, fixed picture capable of managing and repressing the differential, destabilizing force of time. Such containment of time in the interests of linearity and closure is accepted as the norm in the majority of Hollywood films. Yet for a narrative of time travel such as Twelve Monkeys to engage in a similar spatial conversion of time speaks loudly and clearly to the fact that mainstream cinema is uniformly and uncon- sciously colonized by a metaphysical world-view that coerces all imaginative possibilities into a single and homogeneous product. Situated on the tenuous line between realism and fantasy, the science fiction genre is inherently suited to subverting the supposedly stable iconic and narrative codes of classical cinema. Sf films thus provide a suitable ground for a self-referential questioning of both cinematic representation and the experience of film viewing. First, the genre's intrinsic instability raises the question of cinematic ontology-the nature or identity of the medium itself. Second, the theme of time-travel is metaphorically linked not only with the question of narrative as a temporal unfolding of events, but also with cinema's ontological capacity for transporting the spectator into a different spatiotemporal dimension. Third, sf films are likely to put forward explicit points of view about technology's role in acts of perception and representation. As I will argue later, Twelve Monkeys eradicates the potential instability of the sf genre in all of these aspects. First, it insists upon a rationalizing discourse that transforms the anxiety of being in time, for both the time traveler and the viewer, into a game of illusionist realism. In this regard, Twelve Monkeys tries to play the game of proving the unprovable: the empirical simultaneity of past, present, and future. Second, Twelve Monkeys disassociates itself from any self-referential interaction with its viewer or its own enactment of narrative. Instead, the film grounds the possibility of time travel in the human ability to manipulate an instrumental, objectified technology that is putatively independent of psychic processes or needs. Third, the film's use of this purportedly transparent technology accomplishes the ultimate repression of time, rendering the time travel narrative a superfluous enterprise that functions solely to display movie stars and odd- looking gadgets.</page><page sequence="4">386 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) Ontological Questions: The Boundaries between Presence and Absence Twelve Monkey's overall approach to representation follows the basic patterns and assumptions of Hollywood's illusionist realism. According to Charles Eidsvik, "the game of illusionist filmmaking is to see how much apparent reality can be gotten into a make-believe story" (38). In Twelve Monkeys, the drive towards realism manifests itself in the persistence with which the film sets up fixed, identifiable boundaries between reality and fantasy. In this sense, the community of scientists performs a crucial role in rationalizing, hence normalizing, Cole's unusual situation as a subject sliding between the past and present. Literally re-enacting the suspension of disbelief that enables the process of cinematic identification, the film plays the double game of questioning the reality of Cole's claims as a traveler from the distant future while at the same time seducing the viewer into believing in the solidity of those claims. The relationship between James Cole (Bruce Willis) and Dr Railly (Madeleine Stowe) revolves around the latter's gradual discovery of "evidence" that "proves" that Cole's reality is not a construct of his mind.3 Heidegger addresses such assertions of reality on the basis of evidence and proof in his critique of realism in Being and Time: "Realism holds that the Reality of the 'world' not only needs to be proved but also is capable of proof" (251). Heidegger identifies a major problem in this quest for certainty about the existence of a world. If Dasein itself is defined as Being-there or Being-in-the- world, it implies that Being and world are inherently indivisible. In this sense, attempts to ascertain the existence or presence of a world objectify the world as an entity external to, and separate from, Being. In Heidegger's words, over- looking that Dasein is always already within the world entails "a subject that is proximally worldless or unsure of its world, and that must, at bottom, first assure itself of a world" (250). The quest for proof points to two interrelated blind spots: the subject's epistemological imposition of a separation between her/himself and the world (the subject observes the world from an external, overseeing vantage point), and the subject's denial of her/his necessary immersion in the world (there is no subjectivity without a world). This for- getting that Dasein is Being-in-the-world creates the conditions for the dualism of Western metaphysics, insofar as it yields an isolated subject who then needs to be joined with a "world"/object to be reassured of its own existence. In Twelve Monkeys, Cole's claims that he inhabits the world of the future are relentlessly doubted and questioned. Moreover, when refuted, these claims are rationalized through a diagnosis of insanity. La Jetee operates on the opposite premise, i.e., that psychic reality is no less effective and productive than measurable, external reality. In contrast with Twelve Monkeys's positivist, mastering outlook on temporal instability and its rationalization of the dis- located subject as mentally deranged, La Jetee represents the intrusion of past and future into the present as a sign of the anxiety that accompanies existence-with time as the agent of difference, ever preventing the closure and self-coincidence of identity. This difference is apparent in the voice-over comments describing the traveler's experience in La Jetee: "The subject does not die ... does not become mad. He suffers." Because it disregards the</page><page sequence="5">THE REMAKING OF LA JETEE'S TIME-TRAVEL NARRATIVE 387 boundary between objective, physical reality and the reality of psychic contents, La Jetee does not rationalize the play between presence and absence as a distinction between the two ontological categories. As the traveler gradually traverses the passages of his memory, he begins to see a series of objects and scenes simply described as: "A morning in peacetime ... a bedroom in peacetime ... a real bedroom ... real children ... real birds ... real cats ... real graves." The repeated use of the word "real" in this sequence gives credence to the traveler's fantasies/memories, while deconstructing the metaphysical binarism reality/fantasy in at least two important ways. The first one, of course, concerns the reality of psychic contents themselves. No less significantly, the unequivocal sense of reality conferred on these photographic images seems to challenge the Platonic indictment of representation as copy or forgery of an original truth. Photography and film are to be taken not as simple illusions in relation to a reality "out there," but as realities in their own right, with their own specific ontologies and epistemologies. The paradoxical fact that La Jetee owes its own cinematic status to a montage of still images is not merely coincidental with its refusal to speak a rhetoric of presence. On the one hand, the rare blend of photography and film in La Jetee complicates and dislocates the neat demarcation between the properties commonly assigned to each medium. The film invokes neither movement and life, exclusively, nor immobility and death, but rather both simultaneously. The resistance to ontological fixation is reinforced by the very use of stills, which, as Barthes explains, bring into the present the temporal mode of that which "has been," affirming presence while pointing towards something irretrievably absent. The ontology of the photographic image is consequently more in tune with Heidegger's proposition that Being is not to be reduced to those affirmative or positive phenomena privileged in the metaphysical tradition-phenomena associated with life, production, visibility, or disclosure. Instead, Being for Heidegger is an undetermined and constant movement situated between disclosure and concealment. While the ontology of moving images encourages a belief in representation as visible truth-the frame's bracketed portion of the world taken as the world-the still image foregrounds the fragmentary and arbitrary nature of each act of bracketing. Hence, it is impossible for representation ever to reach the status of truth as a fixed wholeness or totality. Much more vigorously than the moving image, photography implicitly acknowledges the Heideggerian notion that each act of unconcealment or disclosure of a world, each instance of representation, is necessarily dependent on concealment.4 The wide gap between these films' ontological and discursive positions is further reinforced by the structural differences in their versions of time travel. A brief analysis of the mise-en-scene representing the mechanisms of transport and surveillance in each film will demonstrate a pervasive contrast between mainstream cinema's reliance on absolute visibility-a rhetoric of space and light-and La Jetee's reliance on a wider sensory spectrum that destabilizes the metaphysical equation of representation with vision while proffering a rhetoric of time and darkness.</page><page sequence="6">388 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) The Mise-en-Scene of Time Travel: The Eye of Panopticism and the Abolition of Time In his Heideggerian discussion of metaphysical representation, Spanos invokes a metaphoric rift between humanist and non-humanist world-views. The former "brings into play the visual metaphorics ... [of] the panoptic gaze, light, spatialized time, heights on the one hand and the figure of the centered circle on the other ... [that] are privileged over the constellation of metaphors associated with the other bodily senses (darkness, temporality, lowness, fallenness, etc.)" (145). With uncanny precision, Spanos's comparison is dramatized in the two films under discussion. The way in which each of their stories conceives of time travel lends material support to the almost mythical overtones of this comparison. As I intend to show, Twelve Monkeys articulates its predilection for visibility over darkness, and for space over time, by strategically converting time travel into space travel. Such a metaphysical operation is accomplished simply by substituting technological instrumentality for the inherently transporting capacities of the psyche. La Jetee's black and white stills yield an abstract play of light and darkness where spaces remain undefined, lines blurred, and objects either sparse and lost in the background or poignantly invested with an auratic quality.5 The mise-en- scene of time travel is orchestrated as a process that unfolds in time, always relying on the traveler's mental and emotional faculties rather than on some external apparatus. The staging of these shots is almost bare of technological equipment. The traveler lies on a rudimentary hammock and has his eyes covered with a simple mask, which suggests a turning inwards through the dark recesses of memory and fantasy. In consonance with La Jetee's aesthetics of immobility, traveling does not involve any geographical transportation, but rather a coming and going of moments in time that the traveler comes to inhabit. Illustrating the genuinely temporal character of traveling in this film, the voiceover narrator at one point indicates the subject's re-immersion into the past by telling us that "the moment returns." With these simple words, the film reveals that it is not invested in visual presence. Rather than making things or people appear and disappear in front of our eyes, the film emphasizes temporality as the existential agent of difference: time comes and goes, changing the world as it changes itself. By contrast, the orchestration of time travel in Twelve Monkeys reflects our culture's undisputed reliance on an instrumental, productive, quantitative technology fully transparent and self-explanatory in its performance and its goals. Gilliam's film adopts Hollywood's fantasy- and action-oriented aesthetics by filtering its images and sounds through a myriad of special effects that deliver an unremitting flow of stimuli to the audience. The overall glossy look of the film is nowhere more apparent than in the staging of the scientists' manipulation of Cole as a useful body of the state. In contrast with the monochromatic and repetitive staging of the interaction between scientists and traveler in La Jetee, Twelve Monkeys displays more varied, not to mention eye- catching, settings. La Jet&amp;e's mood of dark inner exploration is transformed here into one of light and external kinetics that capitalizes on the technological</page><page sequence="7">THE REMAKING OF LA JETEE'S TIME-TRAVEL NARRATIVE 389 fascination that, to a great extent, drives the interests and entertainment choices of contemporary audiences. With its emphatic illumination of certain pieces of gear, the film participates in a general cultural trend-from TV commercials to movies to press advertising-that glamorizes technology by building up the visual appeal of its surfaces.6 The viewer is first introduced to Cole as he prepares to walk the earth's surface in search of animal specimens that may reveal levels of viral contamination. In this scene, certain objects and even natural elements are made into powerful conductors and projectors of light for our eyes. Cole's transparent suit-anticipating his bubble-like transportation vehicle-materializes the rhetoric of transparency and absolute visibility adopted in the entire film. Even the sound effects conspire with this rhetoric, as they are seen to be emitted by sources of water and gas that are potently illumined. As its beam invades the dark space of the underworld, Cole's flashlight radically contrasts with the catacomb-like passages in La Jetee's underworld, perennially semi-drowned in darkness. Moreover, the use of the flashlight symbolizes a specific perceptual and epistemological position-the Cartesian subject purposefully and productively "throwing light" on the objects of his scrutiny. In Twelve Monkeys, the interaction between Cole and the scientists of the future is symptomatic of an important ideological difference between the two films as well. As opposed to the utterly helpless and mute position of the traveler in La Jete-ea position that might bring to mind psychoanalytic theories of the spectator as a passive recipient of the film's point of view7-the scientists in Twelve Monkeys engage in a question and answer session with the traveler each time he is about to be sent off into the past and each time he returns. These verbal exchanges and Cole's physical position during the interrogations indicate the film's investment in a humanist discourse that characterizes Hollywood cinema as a whole. First, the film's humanist agenda requires these verbal exchanges to orchestrate its ideological interpellation of Cole as subject. Through this travesty of communication, the scientists articulate their contempt for Cole as a violent ex-convict in need of reformation, while granting him the opportunity to reform by serving the interests of the state. Far from underscoring Cole's agency or autonomy, this humanist construction, as Foucault and others have argued, is thoroughly imbued with relations of power. Whether it is a question of the power to forgive, console, and reconcile, or to judge and punish, both kinds of power structure the individual as a subject of ideology/discourse. The Hollywood adoption of a subjectivist humanist perspective becomes even more apparent when one compares the traveler's supine position in La Jetee with Cole's position during his interrogations.8 When Cole sits on his chair for his first exchange with the scientists, the chair-machine handcuffs Cole and rises some twelve or fourteen feet off the floor. In relation to both a horizontal and a vertical axis, Cole sits at a considerable distance from his surveyors. Yet, paradoxically, it is this physical distance that they deploy to confer on him the status of subject. In La Jetee the traveler and the scientists are clustered together within the frame, the scientists claustro-phobically closing in</page><page sequence="8">390 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) on the traveler from all sides of his hammock; the more open spatial orchestration of traveler and scientists in Twelve Monkeys, by contrast, seems initially to confer on Cole an autonomous status. As with the dynamics of visibility that characterize the entire film, however, this autonomy turns out to be a visual trap that lures the individual into a desirable subject-position. In contrast with the horizontality of the traveler in La Jetee (a position that straight-forwardly connotes lowness and fallenness in relation to the observers), Cole's placement up-high (and fully, visibly exposed) literalizes the ambivalence of subjectivity in Western culture and representation. While it ostensibly occupies a domineering, overseeing position, the subject actually remains restrained, passive, and, even more important, epistemologically uprooted from the world. The marked differences in the way these two films represent the inscription of power and its ideological hold on the subject through supervision and correction are well illustrated in Foucault's seminal analysis of the surveying strategies of Bentham's panopticism: "The panoptic mechanism ... reverses the principle of the dungeon.... [Of] its three functions-to enclose, to deprive of light and to hide-it preserves only the first and eliminates the other two. Full lighting and the eye of the supervisor capture better than darkness, which ultimately protected. Visibility is a trap" (200; my emphasis). La Jetee aptly exemplifies Foucault's conception of the inadequacies built into the disciplinary system of the dungeon. Unlike Cole's readiness to submit wholly to his own production as a disciplined and dependable citizen, the traveler in La Jetie crucially benefits from his dungeon-like environment. The darkness and seclusion of the physical and psychical spaces allow him to submit only partially and superficially to the disciplinary mechanisms of the underground camp, thereby transforming a situation of instrumental surveillance into a deviant act hardly susceptible to sociopolitical or ideological cooptation. Thus, while Cole embodies the paradox of the metaphysical subject to perfection-a subject who manages to preserve an illusory self-assertive will to power while becoming a useful and docile body of the state-the traveler in La Jetee literally hides in the dark recesses of his psyche and chooses a practically suicidal fate (desire equals death) over fulfilling the rational "life-enhancing" agenda of the state.9 Yet another important difference between the two films is the way each represents its mechanisms of surveillance. In La Jetee, the intrusive presence of the scientists is more acutely conveyed through sound than through image. As the whispering German voiceover of the experimenters spreads over the image of the traveler lying on his hammock, the film seems to affirm the power of sound to travel unchecked and to invade insidiously the space of the psyche. By choosing sound over vision as a vehicle for surveillance, the film implies that the internalization/introjection of commands is the more effective monitoring agency, repudiating a simplistic belief in the equation of visibility with presence. In Twelve Monkeys, on the other hand, the scientists' surveillance of Cole rests not only on the visibility of direct perception, but more emphatically on the fetishized visibility of the technological eye. As Cole sits before his questioners a second and third time, his perception of them is</page><page sequence="9">THE REMAKING OF LA JETEJE'S TIME-TRAVEL NARRATIVE 391 mediated, relayed through a huge gyrating sphere onto which are grafted several video monitors. Significantly, the prevailing image shown on these screens is a close-up of an eye staring directly at Cole. Even though the mobility of the sphere successfully conveys the omnipresent, hegemonic effects of surveillance, the technological sophistication of this panoptic apparatus fails to instill the subtle psychological effects produced by the rather primitive display of sound in La Jetie. By representing the free-floating eye of panopticism as a multi-screen sphere, Twelve Monkeys draws on the system of spatial metaphors privileged in the metaphysical tradition, which I earlier referred to as the "ontotheological" tradition. For Spanos, this tradition is characterized by a "perennial metaphorics constellated around the privileged figure of the centered circle-the panoptic eye, [the clear demarcation between] light and darkness, re-presentation, grasping (comprehension)" (138). The figure of the centered circle is symptomatic of a drive to "see or re-present the differential temporal process as integral and inclusive picture ... or, negatively, to lose sight of and forget difference, in the pursuit of the certainty ... of logocentric order" (139; my emphasis). The epistemological goal pursued by the panoptic figures is an important aspect of Twelve Monkeys as well. The goal to re-present the world/reality as an integral and inclusive picture that annuls the differential force of time is reflected not only in the immediate skills exhibited by the rotating spherical eye, but also in the film's overall spatial conversion of the time-travel narrative itself. Besides reminding Cole, in a self-reflexive way, of its own global supervising capacities through the tautological display of a series of disembodied eyes, the gyrating eye also features images of people or objects that act as clues in the investigative mission engaging Cole. By holding in a simultaneous, multiple image events that belong to different spatiotemporal contexts, the rotating eye collapses the irreducible difference of these events under its commanding gaze. This technological instrumentality allows the scientists to "reduce all elsewheres to the regime of Everywhere" (Dienst 121) and exemplifies the persistent attempt of Western metaphysics to coerce temporality-the unmanageable force of difference, mystery, death-into a manageable and stable picture. Ironically, the technological expertise of the scientists in Twelve Monkeys seems to defeat the very purpose of time travel itself. Only the humanist insistence on reclaiming the centrality of human presence and human agency in a fully technocratized society justifies the obsolete insertion of time travel as a narrative ploy. Otherwise, there would be little need to travel into the past in search of data and information when, as the video monitors show, that information is already available through a technology that has mastered all distances and temporalities. Moreover, if the panoptic eye and its commanding gaze renders the project of time travel superfluous at a narrative level, this superfluousness also carries over into the film's metanarrative discourse. In this sense, the function of the multiple-screen sphere in the film-namely, to integrate and include pictures that are spatially and temporally divergent in a</page><page sequence="10">392 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) single synchronic configuration-is merely a hyperbolic, literal manifestation of the larger spatialization of time performed within the film as a whole. La Jete's notion of time travel as radical dis-location is reduced in more contemporary sf films to a series of physical re-locations virtually devoid of breaks or difficulties-to borrow Heidegger's terminology, a "uniform distancelessness" ("The Thing" 166). TWelve Monkeys adopts a homogeneous visual style that levels out the differences between past, present, and future by saturating all of the times/worlds with the same 1990s-vintage gloss and dystopian dreariness. Whether it is a matter of going back to the past or abruptly returning to the world of the future, the task of normalizing the temporal mix-up into a linear chronology of events remains an easy empirical process, hardly a matter of existential or psychic paradox. In this apparently circular temporal paradigm, Cole effectively inhabits a continuous sequence of worlds/nows, his passage from one to the other void of psychic rupture except in the most obvious, sensationalized ways. The conversion of the time-travel narrative into a spatial one in Twelve Monkeys figures prominently even in the way the film envisions the mechanics of time travel itself. In marked contrast with La Jetee's aesthetics of stasis, a vehicle actually transports and propels Cole forward into a corridor, and although this movement is not visualized in its entirety, it does hint at the primary role that kinetics plays in the film's fantasy of time travel. An additional example of the spatialization of being and time can be found in the film's refusal to relinquish the hero's unified ego. Cole's body is transported whole whenever and wherever he travels, never leaving anything behind to challenge either his own or the viewer's need for epistemological certainty. It should be noted, however, that Cole's corporeal wholeness contrasts in some respects with the film's sporadic representation of his body as a hysterical inscription of disturbance. Thus, Twelve Monkeys' only concession to disruption is in the film's objectified representation of temporal difference as a series of bodily symptoms registering Cole's physical discomfort and regression. Rather than creating a meditative mood regarding time, desire, and death, as is the case with the temporal leaps in La Jetee, the degraded, animal-like image of Cole as he is questioned by Dr Railly appropriates the iconography of violence typical of most contemporary Hollywood productions. Cole is transformed into an aggressive, primitive being, with a continuous flow of saliva from his mouth as he crouches on the floor of the prison cell in a primate-like posture, his hands restrained and his look averted and empty. Such regression no doubt reflects Hollywood's high investment in a sensationalist aesthetics-in which everything must be visualized and every visualization must carry an element of shock or surprise. This aesthetics of visual shock implies a frantic obsession with the body, which, as Foucault argues, results in the regimentation/reification not only of its normative capacities but also of its disabilities and deviations. Curiosity versus Dwelling: The Containment of Death The mise-en-scene in La Jetee is a visual correlative of the psychoanalytic principle of repetition compulsion. Within the film's hauntingly repetitive</page><page sequence="11">THE REMAKING OF LA JETEE'S TIME-TRAVEL NARRATIVE 393 images, difference is created through a minimalist aesthetics of montage that emphasizes slight variations within a single dominant theme. Twelve Monkeys, on the other hand, displays an aesthetics of curiosity and novelty, both in its scenic choices and in its narrative development. Without sacrificing the fundamental rule of epistemological clarity, the Hollywood film must continuously strive to present new objects and places, or to show "old" things in a totally new light. For example, when Cole is first sent back to the past, we witness only his talk with the scientists; the technological paraphernalia that literally propel him into the past are not revealed to us. The full display of moving gadgets and machines is reserved for Cole's second journey, fulfilling the film's relentless need for variation and novelty. In Being and Time, Heidegger associates the media's predilection for novelty with the epistemological principle of "curiosity," which he defines as the "restlessness and the excitement of continual novelty and changing encounters. " As a rhetorical mode, "curiosity" entails ceaseless movement forward-"never dwelling anywhere"-which negates the possibility of "observing entities and marveling at them" (216-17). "Curiosity" has a number of affinities with the cause-and-effect progression of narrative in a Hollywood movie. Causal linearity in classical realist storytelling is more concerned with setting up credible and exciting links between scenes/events than with allowing the reader/viewer to take in the full import or impact of an isolated scene. In this sense, classical narrative film cannot "tarry observantly," since its tendency to mobilize a multiplicity of stimuli and "changing encounters" is poorly suited for the careful observation of entities and for the emergence of a feeling of wonder. Each of these sf narratives treats the themes of sex and death in ways that allow one to describe their respective rhetorics of spectatorial address in terms of the opposing Heideggerian modes of "curiosity" and "dwelling." Having excluded the possibility of fulfillment of desire-both for its diegetic and its spectatorial travelers-La Jete'e can afford to "dwell" at ease in the uncanny beauty of its ordinary images. While the representational mode of Hollywood is characterized by a uniform "distancelessness" (the perpetual availability of the world/difference as simultaneous picture), the memory-images of the traveler in La Jetee bring out the auratic potential of the image ("auratic" implying both the seductive presence of the image and its irrecoverability as graspable object). The voiceover's rendition of these memories emphasizes their unique capacity to affect traveler and viewer alike: "A morning in peacetime ... a bedroom in peacetime ... a real bedroom ... real children ... real birds ... real cats ... real graves." "Observing entities and marveling at them" is possible inLa Jetee precisely because the film withdraws from the teleological psycho-libidinal organization that classic narrative film assigns to its beginnings and its endings (departure as initial moment of lack, destination as final moment of plenitude). Similarly, the film departs from the equally teleological representation of the love story as narcissistic fulfillment (or healing of psychic wounds). Instead, it explicitly renders the traveler's attachment to the woman as a fetishistic diversion from his own knowledge of mortality. In its use of fetishism, the film follows an</page><page sequence="12">394 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) unmistakably Freudian pattern. As Christian Metz explains, in the Freudian scenario of fetishism, the little boy deflects the sight of castration by arresting his look for all time "at what will subsequently become the fetish ... a piece of clothing, for example, which masks the frightening discovery.... The fixation on this 'just before' is thus another form of disavowal, of retreat from the perceived" (70; my emphasis).10 In the scene at the Orly airport that opens La Jetee, the event of death (the ultimate form of castration) is inseparable from the inaugurating moment of desire. Retroactively affected by the violence of memory that characterizes a primal scene, the child witnesses his own death as an adult and "masks [t]his frightening discovery" with the image of a woman's face. The traveler, the haunting voice-over tells us, would long after remember "the frozen sun and a woman's face." The disavowing/masking role of the woman's face in the traveler's later confrontation with death is further made apparent in the words that follow: "The face he had seen was to be the only peacetime image to survive the war.... Had he invented that tender moment to shield him from the madness to come? Later, he knew he had seen a man die. And, some time after, Paris was destroyed" (my emphasis). Since death and desire form an intricate whole, the woman is always already present when the child witnesses his own death, and, like a proper fetish object in a primal scene, she will have been the last memory image to be engraved in the traveler's psyche. Simultaneously the most definitive assertion of closure and the most final negation of closure, death in La Jetee is dwelled on from beginning to end. The film recognizes death as a positive event-not according to a moral or economic standard of value, but in terms of its having significance in itself. In Twelve Monkeys, on the other hand, the heterosexual romance between Cole and Dr Railly is utterly divorced from the hero's death. After all, not only in Hollywood, but in Western culture as a whole, the achievement of plenitude and self-realization coincides with the encounter with the love-object that allegedly makes good all the lacks that previously mortified the subject. Time and death, the forces that most stubbornly resist this disavowal of lack, have to be either ignored or managed. Besides the essentially incompatible conjunction of love and death, other factors also contribute to the disavowal of the knowledge of mortality in Twelve Monkeys. Most prominent among these is the film's humanist presentation of Cole as a self-assertive subject with a mission. As Richard Dienst has argued in a discussion of Heidegger and technology, "to be unable to recognize death as one's own is yet another privation of Enframing [Representation].... To be capable of dying means to be capable of bearing death in its essence. But we are able to do so only when the essence of death has an affinity with our existence" (118). From this perspective, it is hardly possible to posit an affinity between Cole's life-a pure assertion of a technological will- to-power-and the dissolving effects of death. Cole's death in Twelve Monkeys is accordingly viewed as a murder executed by an extrinsic antagonistic force. Void of significance in itself, his death requires the addition of an epilogue to be toned down, forgotten, and, ultimately, redeemed. Since the film's overinvestment in visibility and presence fails to assign any intrinsic purpose or</page><page sequence="13">THE REMAKING OF LA JETEE'S TIME-TRAVEL NARRATIVE 395 meaning to death, this coda is supposed to ensure that Cole's death has not been in vain. The female scientist who, in the last scene, sits next to the "bad guy" on the plane-who, aptly enough, is in the "insurance" business-continues Cole's redemptive task and, in a sense, confers some purpose on his death. A fairly representative example of what contemporary audiences might consider a good, entertaining sf film, Twelve Monkeys paradoxically testifies to the fundamental continuity between the founding premises of metaphysical thought and today's supposedly advanced technological cultures. At least in its mainstream manifestations, Hollywood cinema is in this respect as philosophically retrogressive as the views of the world and the subject embedded in its rhetorical operations. In Heidegger's words, "it is a worldview that recognizes the constancy of produced objects alone as being and as positive. Its self-assertion of technological objectification is the constant negation of time and death, by which negation death itself becomes something negative ... the altogether inconstant and null" ("What Are Poets For?" 125). There is little doubt that Twelve Monkeys casts time and death as the proverbial alien that science and technology will measure, master, and kill. No fantasy concocted by the science fiction genre could ever rival this. NOTES 1. As Paul Schrader has observed, Hollywood films tend to emphasize ethical questions at the expense of aesthetic experimentation. In his "Notes on Film Noir," Schrader attributes noir's neglect among American film critics to the fact that it "depends more on choreography than sociology." Schrader argues that "American critics have always been more interested in theme than style. [They] have always been sociologists first and scientists second" (225). This dichotomy is also clearly at work in Twelve Monkeys, insofar as the film substitutes a heroic rescue operation of planetary proportions for the self-reflexive and contemplative/intimate aesthetics of La Jetee. I think that Hollywood's general concern with social and ethical problems becomes impoverished and ultimately ineffective through its own systematic disregard for the political ramifications of representation-one cannot change patterns of social interaction and political action without simultaneously acting upon the ideologically-constructed ways of perceiving the world. 2. Following many philosophers and critics who have used this term either explicitly or implicitly (Heidegger, Foucault, Derrida), the word "ontotheological" is used in this discussion to refer to the continuing humanist bent of Western thought and representation. In its general sense, the term connotes a series of metaphysical principles: the search for a unitary meaning or organizing structure/master narrative, the belief in ultimate truth, and the possibility and power of absolute knowledge based upon visible disclosure. 3. It is also interesting to note that this "evidence" is produced by media, namely a photograph of Cole's incontrovertible "presence" in WWI, and radio/TV accounts of an incident the outcome of which Cole knew beforehand-an incident involving a Fresno child thought to have fallen into a well. This simply demonstrates the interdependence and complicity between the culture's need for certainty and its utilitarian deployment of media to fulfill that need. 4. As Heidegger puts it, "the disclosure of beings as such is simultaneously and intrinsically the concealing of being as a whole" ("On the Essence of Truth" 137). 5. Along these lines, the mise-en-scene of both films can be referred to the</page><page sequence="14">396 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) Heideggerian dichotomy of object versus thing. The thing turns into an object through the objectifying and commodifying process of representation. The object becomes "that which stands before, over against, opposite us" ("The Thing" 168), ready to be dominated and instrumentalized. While the thing is rooted in the world, the object exists only as a product of Enframing or re-presentation (Gestelt). The object is thus inscribed in a process of endless production and consumption that levels off the difference and uniqueness of the thing. As Heidegger notes, things are "compliant and modest in number, compared with the countless objects everywhere of equal value." Heidegger's distinction is decidedly at work when one looks at the different ways of staging objects and events in Twelve Monkeys and in La Jetee: the distraction and curiosity informing the lavish proliferation of plot elements, technological gadgets, and settings in Twelve Monkeys as opposed to La Jetee's mise-en-scene, whose effect is grounded on its very barrenness and stasis. For all their modesty and lack of gloss, the stills in La Jetfe possess an affective impact that is far more defined and challenging than that produced by the restless action and the technological show of the Hollywood movie. This orchestration of still images instantiates to perfection Heidegger's statement that "as the stilling of stillness, rest is always more in motion than all motion and always more restlessly active than any agitation" ("Language" 206). 6. I would like to refer the reader to two essays that discuss some oppositions relevant to the one brought forth in my analysis of La Jetee and Twelve Monkeys. In "Video Haptics and Erotics," Laura Marks elaborates on the difference between optical and haptic visualities. The former strives for a clear focus upon and isolation of its object and emphasizes the distance between beholder and object, delineating the boundaries between figure and ground and inviting the viewer's identification with and psychic projection onto a figure. Haptic visuality, on the other hand, "is defined as the combination of tactile, kinaesthetic, and proprioceptive functions, the way we experience touch both on the surface of and inside our bodies.... [It] encourages a bodily relation between viewer and ... image" (332). As is probably apparent from these descriptions, the objectives of transparency and mastery associated with optical visuality are at work in Twelve Monkeys, while the blurring of the boundaries between viewer and image, and the viewer's yielding of epistemological mastery, characterize La Jetee 's visual aesthetic. The one feature Marks attributes to haptic visuality that is perhaps most consistently exhibited in this film is the image's "limited visibility," its offering of the object "only on the condition that its unknowability remains intact" (347). Equally suggestive, Richard Shiff's discussion of the tactile qualities of Cezanne's paintings evokes a similar rift between classical transparency and modernist opacity. Shiff s comments may be easily transferred to the comparison between La Jete'e and Twelve Monkeys, especially with regard to these films' treatment of object and mise-en- scene. The following applies to the Hollywood film: "Pictures become transparent when normalized through standardization of technical procedure. Such pictures have the potential to look 'real' (even when rendering the fantastic) because they exhibit a prevailing style, one so expected-and hence 'transparent'-that it can depict objects without seeming to distort them" (my emphasis). The following remarks pertain to La Jetee: "The figure of opacity suggests that a picture surface retains an undeniable materiality, displaying it in all its unique and deviant particularity ... [A]n opaque picture holds 'reality' within its own surface, which never ceases to manifest its physicality.... [O]pacity impedes vision's course, its materiality seeming to invite the touch" (131-32; my emphasis). Shiff's allusion to the particular, unique, and deviant materiality of the picture surface within a visual regime of opacity is echoed in the auratic quality that La Jetee infuses in its overall representation of objects and spaces. 7. Psychoanalytic theories of the cinematic apparatus elaborated by French film</page><page sequence="15">THE REMAKING OF L4 JETEE'S TIME-TRAVEL NARRATIVE 397 theoreticians such as Christian Metz, Jean-Louis Baudry, and Jean-Louis Comolli during the 1970s took the Lacanian mirror stage as the foundation for their own concep- tualization of the film viewer. In The Imaginary Signifier, Metz joins Baudry in asserting that "during the [film] showing we are, like the child [in front of the mirror], in a submotor and hyperperceptive state" (49). The time traveler in La Jete and the moviegoer may be compared along the lines of the voyeuristic gaze as well. The series of shots that present the time traveler physically and psychically monitored by the scientists/experimenters underscores the illusion of the moviegoer as a controlling voyeur, given leave to see without being seen. 8. By "subjectivist" I mean the position the subject is encouraged to take as dominator and overseer of the world as object. In "The Age of the World Picture," Heidegger discusses the interplay between subjectivism and objectivism as part of his critique of humanism and its involvement in a metaphysical world-view. In this essay Heidegger takes issue with the humanist subject's anthropological stance towards the world, and he posits a mutual interdependence between the conquest of the world as visible object/image and the transformation of the human being into a subiectum: "That the world becomes picture is one and the same event with the event of man becoming subiectum in the midst of that which is.... The more effectually the world stands at man's disposal as conquered, and the more objectively the object appears, all the more subjectively does the subiectum rise up, and all the more impetuously too do observation of and teaching about the world change into a doctrine of man, into anthropology" (132- 33). 9. Both Heidegger and Foucault seek to destroy the anthropological discourse of Occidental modernity in their writings. Foucault's theory of humanism as a simultaneous promise and denial of power to its subject is another version of Heidegger's notion of the subiectum, and it is likewise unequivocally played out in Twelve Monkeys' representation of Cole as both convict and hero-an object in the hands of the state and a subject with a rescuing mission of global proportions. According to Foucault's genealogy of power, the process of becoming a subject, however tinged with hues of liberation and democratization, is exposed as a surreptitious subjection or submission. By humanism, Foucault means "the totality of discourse through which Western man is told: 'Even though you don't exercise power, you can still be a ruler. Better yet, the more you deny yourself the exercise of power, the more you submit to those in power, then the more this increases your sovereignty.... Humanism is everything in Western civilization that restricts the desire for power: it prohibits the desire for power and excludes the possibility of power being seized" (quoted in Spanos 173). 10. La Jetee's discourse on fetishism extends to a variety of formal devices as well-not only in its almost exclusive use of still images, but also in the doubling of the "death effect" of photography itself through a mise-en-scene of statues and stuffed animals in "a museum filled with eternal creatures." Like the fetish and the photograph, these props both restore a sense of life and attest to its irretrievability. Unlike the unacknowledged fetishism practiced in Hollywood, however, La Jetee turns fetishism on its head precisely by deploying it as a self-conscious and deliberate strategy. By virtue of this self-conscious look, the fetish in the film loses its alleged power of restoration, pointing instead to the illusion of such power. The photographic image, for example, levels the differences between life and death (the animals in the zoo are no more alive than the stuffed animals in the museum) as well as the differences between human and non-human (several shots at the museum intimate a reciprocal inspection between humans and caged stuffed animals).</page><page sequence="16">398 SCIENCE FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 28 (2001) WORKS CITED Barthes, Roland.

ABSTRACT Through a comparative analysis of the mise-en-scene of time travel in La Jetee and Twelve Monkeys, this article explores the differences between Hollywood cinema's reliance on full visibility and presence-a rhetoric of space and light-and the film's use of a wider sensorial spectrum that destabilizes the metaphysical equation of represen- tation with vision while putting forth a rhetoric of time and darkness. Using Heidegger's critique of metaphysics and Foucault's theory of panopticism, the article argues that Twelve Monkeys reproduces the metaphorics of vision and power at work in the ontotheological tradition of Western representation. Twelve Monkeys' rationalizing discourse transforms the anxiety of being in time into a game of illusionist realism. Second, the film substitutes technological instrumentality for the inherently transporting capacities of the psyche. And third, while potentially dislocating, the film's time travel narrative ends up coercing temporality (and death) into a manageable, stable, and redeemable picture.</page></plain_text>
