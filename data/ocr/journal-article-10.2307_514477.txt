<plain_text><page sequence="1">Thus the herring-bone pattern of the wall suggests serpent-shapes, which in turn suggest the remembrance of the dead who fell beside the wall; and it is round the images of the dead (the lord, the kinsmen, the 'dugup')I and the images of transience that the elegiac themes of The Wanderer revolve. The reason for mentioning the decorative pattern is one of those associations of the Anglo-Saxon poetic imagination which it is the business of the critic to attempt to reconstruct. Through this association, the clearly-visualized and strikingly-described Roman herring- bone patterned wall fits the thematic framework of The Wanderer.2 TONY MILLNS GEOFFREY WHITNEY'S 'TO RICHARD COTTON, ESQ.': AN EARLY ENGLISH COUNTRY-HOUSE POEM BEN JONSON'S 'To Penshurst' is customarily described as the first English country-house poem, descended directly from Martial's Epigram III 58, 'Baiana nostri villa . . . Faustini', and related both to Horace's Second Epode, 'Beatus ille . . .', and to Virgil's Georgics. But thirty years before its publication Geoffrey Whitney had included in A Choice of Emblemes (1586) two stanzas complimenting Richard Cotton, Esq., on his estate at Combermere. These stanzas are part of the emblem of the bees, and in a collection of 248, most of which are translations from Alciati and his Continental followers, this poem is one of the few that is entirely Whitney's. The block print of a swarm returning to its hive that accompanies the poem is Alciati's, borrowed from the I581 edition of his Emblemata.3 But while the Italian's emblem 'Principia Clementia' concerned the 'king' of the bees as the model of a beneficent ruler, Whitney chose as his motto 'Patria cuique chara':4 To each a native land is dear. Whitney's poem begins, appropriately, with the bees' homecoming: The bees at lengthe retourne into their hiue When they haue suck'd the sweete of FLORAS bloomes.... (1-2) The Wanderer, lines 7, 9-II, 22-3, 28, 31, 34-6, 41-4, 5I-5, 60-3, 78-84, 91-6, 97-100, io6-io. 2 I would like to thank Dr. H. R. Ellis Davidson, Dr. H. M. Taylor, Professor Peter Clemoes, Miss Joan Liversidge, and Dr. John Pickles for their assistance in the preparation of this article; naturally, it is not to be taken to represent their views on the subject. 3 At least one earlier edition of Alciati's emblems has a different print; the edition of 1551 seems to depict wasps, insects more in keeping with Alciati's 'Vesparum'. 4 Whitney's motto, like Alciati's, alludes to one of the anthropomorphic virtues which Zeus granted to the bees in gratitude for their sustaining him when he was hidden from Saturn in the Dictean cave (Georgics iv. I47 ff.). NOTES 438</page><page sequence="2">After a second stanza devoted to their reverence for their 'king', the third describes the ability of every bee to recognize its own hive, 'Althoughe there stande a thousande on a rowe.' The theme of return seems to be abandoned in stanza four, for it intro- duces the compliment to Combermere by comparing the hierarchy of the hive to the human social order: A Comon-wealthe, by this, is right expreste: Bothe him, that rules, and those, that doe obaye: Or suche, as are the heads aboue the rest, Whome here, the Lorde in highe estate dothe staye: By whose supporte, the meaner sorte doe liue, And vnto them all reuerence dulie giue. (19-24) Stanzas five and six apply the emblem to Cotton's estate: Which when I waied: I call'd vnto my minde Your CUMBERMAIRE, that fame so farre commendes: A Stately seate, whose like is harde to finde, Where mightie IovE the horne of plentie lendes: With fishe, and foule, and cattaile sondrie flockes, Where christall springes doe gushe out of the rockes. There, fertile fieldes; there, meadowes large extende: There, store of grayne: with water, and with wood. And, in this place, your goulden time you spende, Vnto your praise, and to your countries good: This is the hiue; your tennaunts, are the bees: And in the same, haue places by degrees. (25-36) This is not 'To Penshurst' of course. But it is a compliment to a country estate well within the georgic tradition of didactic description of place. It lacks the interest in architecture which Jonson's poem, according to G. R. Hibberd,1 established as characteristic of the genre, and it lacks a concern with history and family tradition as well. But it does possess a second characteristic Hibberd describes, a concern with the reciprocity of man and nature; and through the analogy of the bees Whitney implies still a third, the estate's social function in the life of the community. The poem's last two stanzas are probably autobiographical. The poet speaks of his own longing for his native land, a desire which links the bees' recognition of their native place and the compliment to Combermere. In 1586 Whitney was living at Leyden, where he published his book of emblems, and he likens himself to the bees which 'yet come home, when honie they haue founde': Wherefore, when happe, some goulden honie bringes? I will retorne, and rest my wearie winges. (47-8) G. R. Hibberd, 'The Country House Poem of the Seventeenth-century', Journal of the Warburg and Courtauld Institutes, I9 (1956), 159-71. NOTES 439</page><page sequence="3">Combermere, although in Shropshire,' is within ten miles of the poet's birthplace near Nantwich in Cheshire. Their proximity justifies the inclusion of the country-house stanzas in a poem about return to a native place; and Whitney in fact did return, making a will at Combermere Abbey in i600, shortly before his death. Whitney's presence in Leyden offers a clue to his sources of inspiration in the country-house stanzas. He might simply have had in mind Martial's epigram, or Catullus's poem XXXI on Sermio's restorative retreat, or Statius' two poems in the Silvae (I. 3 and II. 2), or even the palace of Alcinous in the Odyssey. Certainly the rest of A Choice of Emblemes suggests that Whitney was well read. But more probably he was influenced by the contemporary spate of country-house poems being written on the Continent. L. P. Wilkinson cites a German poem, several in Italian and French, and 'a veritable craze for neo-Latin poems in praise of country life, of which eight appeared between 1570 and I583.... From these emerged the distinctive genre of the country-house poem.'2 Plantin Press, pub- lisher of Whitney's emblems, also published a number of these poems; and the Netherlands, says Wilkinson, 'were to be the chief source of country-house poems in the next century'.3 Whitney's A Choice of Emblemes, then, not only introduced the emblem into English but also imported the Renaissance revival of the country-house poem, an epideictic kind which was to be used by English poets from Jonson through Marvell and Dryden to Pope and beyond. If Whitney's work is a bridge from Continental literature to English, it does not follow that Jonson is even as much in his debt as are the English emblematists. Jonson almost certainly knew Whitney's collection; it prob- ably influenced Shakespeare's imagery,4 and a poet who merges mankind and nature as Jonson does in 'To Penshurst' by speaking of the tenant's 'ripe daughters . . . whose baskets beare | An embleme of themselves, in plum, or peare' would have been familiar with the first and best known English emblem book. A case can be made for 'To Penshurst' as an emblematic poem: it is a 'speaking picture' in which fruit grows within reach, eels leap on land, and partridges offer themselves for the master's table. Its abundant visual detail may not be strictly speaking iconographic, but certainly those details may be read allegorically as the details of emblems are. Still, Jonson's first debt is to Martial-even the farmers' daughters are from the Latin poem. Penshurst has no bees in part because Martial has I Richard Cotton, unnoticed by the D.N.B., was probably related to Roger Cotton, a minor poet (fl. 1596), most of whose five brothers are described as patrons of literature. 2 L.

It is itself in Jonson's poem an emblem of a cosmic order. From woods and pastures and river through fish, birds, and cattle the poem moves to the human political order of tenant, house servant, poet, master, and king; the poem culminates in the ambiguously resonant 'Lord' of the final line. Whitney's stanzas are a simpler, far smaller vision of a man's relation to the natural order he has cultivated, yet they belong in the English tradition of the country-house poem, and 'To Penshurst' has an English antecedent in the order, variety, and plenitude of Richard Cotton's Combermere. KATHRYN HUNTER STOICISM IN MEASURE FOR MEASURE: A NEW SOURCE N o single source has been found for the Duke's great philosophical speech against the fear of death in the central scene of Measure for Measure (III. i. 5-41). It clearly owes much to the tradition of the ars moriendi, blending Senecan stoicism with Christian moralizing. To distinguish the elements in it which are wholly commonplace from those which either have specific sources, or are Shakespeare's own, will probably never be possible, since there are so many common strands of argument and imagery in late classical, medieval, and Renaissance writings on the theme.' The analogue proposed here is most unlikely to have been Shakespeare's only immediate source, but I suggest that it deserves consideration as perhaps a prominent one. In 1592 William Ponsonby, publisher of the 1590 Arcadia and Faerie Queene, published as a single volume two translations by Sidney's sister, Mary Herbert, Countess of Pembroke.2 The second in the volume, her translation of Garnier's Senecan tragedy Marc Antoine, has often been noted as a minor source for Antony and Cleopatra.3 For some reason Professor Geoffrey Bullough, in printing the play, chose the later, I595, edition-Antonie was printed alone in that year.4 On its first appearance in J. W. Lever in his edition of Measurefor Measure (London, I965), p. lxxxvii n., lists some of these. Reference will be made to this edition. 2 A Discourse of Life and Death. Written in French by Ph.

Ridley, in his Arden edition of Antony and Cleopatra (1954), pp. xxxix-xl, seems unaware that there was an edition of Antonie earlier than 1595. NOTES 441</page></plain_text>
