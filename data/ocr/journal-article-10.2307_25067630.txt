Billii?jii A s much as anyone concerned with Cypriot archaeology, BBHBI ?* iJDiane Bolger directs our attention to issues related to BB?illl ancient human behavior. Gender in Ancient Cyprus focuses on lilllllli the wealth and variety of artifacts made of different materials ?l||?:?||||?l???|| llISSill? during the epipaleolithic through the Bronze Age. The ^^^ 1 emphasis is not the role of women as mothers, cooks, and sex M objects rendered in clay. Instead it is an examination of the role of women in relationship to the exciting, ever-changing, big issues of ancient society. To explore gender relations, Bolger O / Ek O ' O presents engendered artifacts in specific cultural contexts to wmmm^mmmm measure how the material culture participated in, contributed ISHNH to&gt; influenced, impacted, and helped to create the broader iSilMl! social, economical, and political frameworks of the time. The IMBU? result is a refreshingly innovative perspective on the figurines, f^?Ji pottery, house plans, and burials and on those who made and iiiiimmi IBM S used them, as well as ourselves. Illfllllilllli? :?!?| ^^ illllHll Topics covered reflect our current enthusiasm for women's lllllllllllii! rights, women's studies, working women, etc. For the most llllllil Part&gt; it has been males who set the agenda for archaeological lii?ilili research and interpretation, resulting, at times, in negative and RHM sexually laden connotations and description of artifacts. Cypriot llllili r 1 r. - 1 1 1-11 11 1.1 |M||i^i female figurines have been described as puny, naked, and with HU^Hj pronounced sexual attributes, when other less disapproving or ?llgf?B? provocative terms would suffice (p. 99). Increasingly we see illlllllil publications written by men who have adopted a less macho iilllSllll perspective to address gender-related issues raised by the ? j?^^B?? women in their lives, namely, their female students. t mmmm?mmm With a focus on activities that cross chronological boundaries, Bolger describes changing patterns of gender relationships set against the background of emerging social complexity, from prehistoric hunter and gather communities to urban dwellers. To familiarize readers with recent literature on gender studies, Bolger starts by skillfully presenting the relevant theoretical and methodological literature on a number of large topics, including gender issues, social agency theory and feminist theory. In doing so, Bolger embraces a strategy similar to that adopted by Carol Meyers for her seminal study, Discovering Eve: Ancient Israelite Women in Context (Oxford University, 1988). Meyers introduced readers to gender issues by summarizing the then current work on gender. Her book deals primarily with the archaeological remains and textual references that make the lives of Iron Age Israelite women visible. Like Meyers, Bolger provides readers with a detailed introduction to anthropological feminist scholarship of its time. Covering some twenty years, Bolger obliges the reader by including the fundamentals on twenty-first century gender studies. This survey is relevant for all archaeologists working in the Old World. Bolger wrote her book to fill the "blatant gap" of women and gender in archaeological literature of the "ancient Near East" (p. xv). It seems curious that Bolger does not mention Meyers' book despite its similarities in approach, methodology, and especially the conclusions relevant for future research. Unlike Meyers, Bolger covers entirely new topics for eastern Mediterranean and ancient Near Eastern cultures in the types of questions she raises. She succeeds at engendering Cypriot material culture by assessing fundamental issues concerning how populations handled life-cycle processes and how those experiences shape and reshaped gender identities. One essential finding is the rejection of a simplistic binary division of gender, activities, and artifacts into either male or female. Cooking pots do not equal people (including women). But Bolger is not the first to espouse the idea that artifacts were not made or used exclusively by males or females in the eastern Mediterranean. Meyers (1988: 55 and passim) similarly advised against a black and white division. Although simple enough, it is a statement that has not been heard by many who set the agenda for where and what to excavate or how to interpret artifacts, including architecture. It is imperative that researchers not consider male and female as two distinct groups who always or necessarily carry out entirely different roles in society. Among the many far-ranging topics Bolger presents are the engendering of domestic, industrial, artistic, burial, and ritual activities. One way she navigates beyond a male/female dichotomy is by discussing the "third gender" or "genderless" status, gender ambiguity, multiple gender categories, transgendering, and gender mutability. Whereas Meyers dealt with children in terms of childbirth, education, and care, Bolger focuses attention on young people as part of the whole economic world. Would children not have contributed to pottery manufacture as current ethnoarchaeological studies 200 NEAR EASTERN ARCHAEOLOGY 68:4 (2005)</page><page sequence="2">demonstrate? Would children not have been enthusiastic hunters? Who plastered the houses each year and who determined who worked at all? Throughout the book, Bolger relies heavily at times on ethnographic data from all around the world to demonstrate the roles of women, children, and how genders might change after death. She supports her conclusions with ethnographic data about the use of space and place, childbirth, metal working, mortuary ritual, weaving, social status, cranial deformation, anthropomorphic figurines, religious ideology and stone tool technology. Ironically, for pottery production Bolger finds appropriate ethnographic examples wanting. This is the sole craft/industry long attributed to both women and men, but the author concludes that the available ethnographic evidence on pottery production fails to support the idea that primarily women were involved with pottery at certain times. She notes that all family members would have been needed to carry out specific aspects of the work, such as clay procurement and processing, fabrication, decoration, firing, selling etc. (pp. 69-70). This is obvious. Bolger correctly considers the entire process of production, from start to finish, as likely involving men, women, and children. Yet for weaving Bolger associates textile production with women alone based on information from ethnographic studies and from archaeological remains. Since spindle whorls are not found in male burials, but are restricted to female funerary deposits prior to LCIIC, Bolger infers that this situation (for how many tombs?) "suggests that textile manufacture, or at least certain parts of production (such as spinning or weaving), may have been exclusively female endeavors." It is likely that some men and children were involved in textile production. The author does all she can to extricate women from pottery manufacture and then she excludes men from textile production. For most other topics, Bolger makes excellent use of ethnoarchaeological studies. Bolger is comfortable with the term "egalitarian" and "relatively egalitarian social context" (p. 122) without defining the terms or questioning the altogether unrealistic concept of "egalitarian societies." She discusses attempts to colonize Cyprus and why people "chose" to leave their homeland, Gender in J Ancient Cyprus 1 Narratives o? Social :j;j Chan ye on a \ ? Mediterranean Island i | rather than assume it was accidental lSl|^3 circumstances that might have brought S?ftl? people to Cyprus. Bolger offers detailed ABMi information about all aspects of ancient |f??|Jjl society. Given the wide appeal of a book :^&amp;??M devoted to gender studies, more statistics jl?lltl concerning the number of tombs, sites, ?^lpS etc. might have been helpful to readers. SI? To render the book accessible to ??lpf! archaeologists worldwide, there is a t^^S convenient, brief survey of Cypriot 8???8 prehistory (Epi-Paleolithic through the ?i^^S Late Bronze Age) with a list of major ?l^^H archaeological sites and a map with fJ^^B the major sites. Given the potentially ?lli? wide appeal the book will have to any iSHiiH archaeologist not familiar with the rich i|fl|jj|| and varied prehistory of Cyprus, more y^p;M maps would have helped readers know how the distribution ?a??S| o? sites coincides with the geographic diversity oi the island. illiiil The potential impact o? Bolger's book is huge. Once we Al?^? begin to consider any single artifact from a new perspective, SlBfl it has ramifications for many different aspects of the society IfBfl as a whole and for all ancient Mediterranean and Near illfiBI Eastern societies. It can lead to the r??valuation of many pSpfll other issues. The reinterpretation o? tomb deposits, the ?p^B renaming of female figurines and insertion of children into II^^B the overall reconstruction o? ancient societies are merely ll?BI the beginning of a more complete, realistic, and interesting SijlBB perspective on the past. ^^B| Bolger's book deserves the attention o? anyone interested If?lBI in social and economic reality in antiquity, especially I^^Mj throughout the Mediterranean and ancient Near East. It is flBB highly readable, concise, well illustrated and informative. It ^^^fl will help all those working in the region to better understand ?BB the role o? women in specific cultures and throughout the SlBB region. Future studies covering such topics from an inter- IIIBh regional perspective would be a next logical step, benefiting I^^^H the study of the area as a whole and helping to display l^f^S connections, differences, and trends. i?lll?
