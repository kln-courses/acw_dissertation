Fans of Gordon Tullock - and that label fits more or less everyone who has an interest in public choice - will be delighted with his latest book that takes the reader far beyond the traditional boundaries of economics. The Economics of Nonhuman Societies is so brief that it can be read at one sitting, and it likely will be: this reviewer could not put it down. This work contains fascinating ideas about new worlds, and it is imbued with Tullock's inimitable personality.</page><page sequence="2">378 As the title suggests, his goal is to use economic analysis to explain the behavior of "social" animals, primarily various insects. At the outset, Tullock's brief Preface chides biologists for trivializing the problem he addresses and solves: "They did not realize the difficulty of inte- grating the behavior of a number of autonomous units. Hence, they did not understand or appreciate my solution to that problem" (p. vii). He then pro- ceeds in eight chapters to set the biology profession - and others - on the right track, liberally sprinkling bons mots in route. Try this on for size: "An ant has a very limited brain, even more limited than a college student, impossible though that sometimes seems" (p. 36). He restrains himself, however, and offers no gender-based witticisms - perhaps because among social insects, one or more queens play a major role in the life of the colony. Chapter 1 ("Introduction") explains what the terms "society" and "social behavior" involve when applied in the context of his research. Because inheri- tance plays a major role in the behavior of all simple entities, the genetics of society is the subject of Chapter 2. Chapter 3 discusses some basic problems related to the coordination of activity. As a foil for his exploration of non- human societies, Tullock explains that the mechanisms used by humans, i.e., the market, government, and various hierarchies, to coordinate activities do not generally exist in nonhuman societies, though anthropomorphic logic might suggest otherwise. Yet, economizing is readily apparent in nonhuman societies in the form of an intricate division of labor and a high degree of specialization. Social insects, in particular, engage in impressive feats of organization and, indeed, engineer- ing as they build nests, hives, tunnels, and (in the case of African termites) mounds. Some ants, the reader learns, cultivate crops; other may engage in a form of animal husbandry. The acquisition of food goes far beyond simple foraging, but even that primitive function is conducted with economic effi- ciency. As is so typical of Tullock's style, he often illustrates his points with personal observations: "Sometimes the human society does not depend on voluntary adhesion. I wasted a considerable period of time in the Army during World War II and I can assure you that it was far from voluntary" (p. 23). The core of the book is presented in Chapters 4-6 which are devoted, respec- tively, to ants; termites and bees; and mole rats, sponges, and slime molds. Tullock truly excels in these chapters by carefully outlining how complex socie- ties formed by these nonhuman species require incredibly intricate and coordi- nated behavior by numerous (tens - even hundreds - of thousands, in the case of ants) participants to ensure their survival. He examines how they deal with the environment to construct and maintain their dwellings; how they defend themselves against attack and go on the warpath; how they gather and distrib- ute food; and, inter alia, how they reproduce. This material is filled with so many detailed insights that one wonders how Tullock finds time to work in other fields. Conventional wisdom is occasionally debunked: The legendary fame of the industrious ant appears to stem largely from the simple fact that they are normally only seen when at work. Most of their leisure hours are spent below ground away from casual observation .... [A]nts appear to spend much of their time in grooming themselves,</page><page sequence="3">379 grooming and licking other ants, in what appears to be socializing, and in simply idling around (p. 39). Who, other than Tullock, might possibly perceive that ants often idle around and that ant colonies have their fair share of shiftless bums? At times, Tullock seems intent on offering excuses for the lapses of biolo- gists. For example, when making comparisons between ants and termites, he notes that "ant students are normally motivated by simple curiosity.... Stu- dents of termites, on the other hand, almost universally are concerned with the very practical problem of how to kill them.... This leads the research onto somewhat different paths" (p. 51). His personal observations indicate that ant specialists admire their subjects while termite specialists are "antipathetic"; thus, a "different emotional outlook" prevails among students of ants relative to students of termites, and such attitudes have not aided scientific progress. Chapter 7, "A Theory of Cooperation," addresses the crucial question: "How is cooperation achieved in nature?" Tullock's answer is as simple as it is intuitively appealing: Individual members of nonhuman societies have utility functions - albeit very simple ones in comparison to the far more complex preferences of humans - so the economic law of declining marginal utility is as valid for the members of nonhuman societies as it is for humans. In the case of the termite, its "preference function is such that its behavior significantly alters the environment of the other termites and, therefore, their behavior. For example, a termite providing food to the nest lowers the urgency of the food demand of others, with the result that individual termites turn to repairing the nest" (p. 73). Complex coordination can be achieved by rather simple means; Occam's razor applies to insect behavior. Throughout the book, Tullock repeatedly reminds the reader that there are no lessons to be drawn from his analysis of nonhuman societies that are ap- plicable to their human counterparts. In the final chapter, however, he con- tends that the human body itself is a society of cells that interact in complex ways to achieve cooperation so that a larger entity can function efficiently. All organisms are in reality societies of living cells. This view, Tullock asserts, "is rather startling ... and far from orthodox" (p. 85). But being unorthodox is the very essence of Gordon Tullock and his ideas, so once again he succeeds. Quirky notions often appear in Tullock's work, usually relegated to the foot- notes which are avidly read by the cognoscenti. Unfortunately, he made a con- certed effort to keep "footnotes to an absolute minimum" (p. viii). But one quirk stands out: Why is the word nonhuman hyphenated in the title on the cover but nowhere else in the book? Now, if Tullock would only turn his attention to astronomy, some real progress might be made on understanding black holes and divining the nature of the cosmos. As for me, I plan to have an ant farm in my study - just as soon as my wife recovers from the initial shock of the idea. JAMES T.
