D. S. Shwayder has written a book as novel and odd in manner as in substance. The style repels: needlessly involuted, slack and verbose, at times embarrassingly arch, the English seems that of a man who has no vernacular of his own. Obscure and intricate as it is, the book gives the impression of having been taped rather than written, certainly not of having been edited or revised with a view to lucidity. Fortunately, there are frequent signposts in the shape of previews and recapitulations to rescue the reader from the bewilderment in which the style keeps losing him. Shwayder's way of philosophizing is derived from Austin's adumbration of a solid, scho- lastic, systematic ordering of a mass of lin- guistic data: something Austin never actually achieved, but Shwayder does. His undertaking is to classify types of animal behavior by classifying types of concepts applicable there- to. The classification seeks to avoid the famil- iar pitfalls of behaviorism and introspection and to combine the merits of both by using a device that he calls "conceptual epiphenome- nalism" and explains thus: "I shall suppose an animate creature is being observed by another animal who is making reports upon what he sees. We consider these reports, which we un- derstand and which we assume to be true. Our aim is to ascertain what these reports imply." That is, he asks what conditions must be ful- filled for reports of various kinds to be war- ranted. The advantage of his method is that it makes reasonably strict standards of verifiabil- ity available without limiting us to an impov- erished vocabulary inadequate to the actual description of behavior. Crude behaviorisms are undercut by the theses that an "act-identi- fying report implies the possibility of explain- ing an animal's movements by reference to his awareness," and that awareness of objects can- not be prior to awareness of facts, theses whose defense and elaboration set the intellectual style and provide much of the content of the book. Instead of a psychological doctrine about how animate behavior is to be explained we have the logical observation that certain concepts are available and that their use has certain implications, without any attempt to specify the contexts in which the use of these concepts is appropriate. Typical of the intellectual style of the book is the device (exemplified in both the above quotations) of using the neutral term "animal" even where the type of behavior being dis- cussed is obviously specific to the human ani- mal, and of making no differentiation within the book's structure between the human and the non-human. Conformably with the absten- tion from contextual specification just referred to, that differentiation is relegated from the conceptual to the factual: reductionism and anthropomorphism are automatically cut out, and the gain in clarity is remarkable. The usage does make for oddity, however, espe- cially in one important context. The animal "making reports upon what he sees," who is essential to the setup, must of course in every case be a human being; and we do not so much observe his behavior as understand what he says to us. The familiar behaviorist de- ception, which purports to exclude the ob- server from his observations and relies on an understanding of behavior that it affects to ignore, is certainly thus circumvented; but Shwayder's use of "animal" here may suggest what is false, that observer and observed are on the same level. For it is in fact an explicit- ly essential part of his thesis that they need not be on the same level, that the "reports" embody a commentator's view of an action that may not be accessible to the agent, just as our definitions of the terms used in report- ing represent a level of sophistication that may be inaccessible to the reporter. Why, then, does Shwayder use the general term "animal" even in this context? Presumably because the dis- crepancy between observed and observer need not be that between non-human and human. They may in fact be on the same level of sophistication, or the difference may be that between a less sophisticated human being and one more sophisticated. 318</page><page sequence="2">BOOK REVIEWS 319 The stratification of behavior itself is set out in fifty-eight sections, each preceded by a summary. The strata may be listed as follows: behavior is a kind of animal movement; action is a kind of behavior; skilful or proficient be- havior is a kind of action; conformative or rule-considering behavior is a kind of pro- ficient behavior; conventional behavior is a kind of conformative behavior; Language (with capital "L") is a kind of conventional behavior. On this basis is to be erected a theory of Language of which we are given a foretaste at the end of the book. The definitions of the successive levels of behavior are so elaborate and the whole ar- gument is so original in content and dense in structure that adequate explication here is out of the question. The scheme seems to me soundly conceived and carried through with almost uniform success, 'its articulation being moreover fleshed out with brilliant excursions on such related topics as the concept of a rule. Other recent work in the philosophy of action 'seems tentative and trivial in' compari- son, and this book might with advantage be- come the accepted basis for further work in its field. Even if one rejects the scheme as a whole, the book still has more good ideas in a page than most books do in a chapter. By far the weakest part of the book is the concluding treatment of Language. The care- ful methodology that has preserved the ob- server's viewpoint is here largely abandoned. The argument meanders, the style 'thickens to frequent impenetrability, baffling misprints abound. Linguistic science is treated cavalier- ly (the highly relevant work of the London school is not mentioned) and heavy use is made of the word rather than the spirit of the Austin Nachlass. We are promised a sepa- rate volume on Language, and it might have been better not to anticipate that by this disappointing and frankly half-baked study. The inadequate handling of the linguists is an aspect of a more pervasive weakness of the book, the narrowness of its disciplinary base. Experimental psychology and' Oxford- style analytic philosophy figure largely, but other relevant traditions of thought and in- quiry are ignored. The contributions of Peirce, G. H. Mead, Talcott Parsons, and other Amer- icans to the theory of social action are not mentioned; nor 'are 'the European phenome- nologists. No doubt Shwayder found their con- tributions worthless, or irrelevant, but an ex- plicit and informed repudiation would have aroused more confidence than a silence that might conceal ignorance. But the imperfections of this book must not be allowed to distract attention from its over-all excellence. Both in plan and in detail it makes an outstanding contribution to its subject, one of which it is at least possible that it may restructure the whole philosophical landscape in the area of its concern.
