Hardwick AFTER BEGINNING HIS REVIEW with complimentary remarks about the importance of my book for religious studies, Hardwick then faults me for not exploring the "theological possibilities on the far side of suspicious interpretation," possibilities that he thinks were implicit in my earlier theological work. But why, I ask, must those of us interested in the interpretation of religion be faulted if we are uninterested in theology "on the far side" of religious studies? Or more personally, why should I, hav- ing self-consciously abandoned Christian theology many years ago for what I thought were good reasons, be criticized for not taking it up again? My aim in this book was not to clear the ground for a "left-leaning" the- ology but to explore Feuerbach's significance for those interested in cer- tain theoretical problems in religious studies. That is why my dialogue partners in the book are not theologians but psychologists, sociologists, and anthropologists of religion, especially those for whom the metaphor of "projection" is an important interpretive concept: Freud, Jung, Peter Berger, Ernest Becker, Melford Spiro, Stewart Guthrie, J. Sierksma, and others. The problems discussed in the book have to do with the nature, func- tion, and interpretation of religion: Should religion be defined substan- tively or functionally? Are phenomenologists correct when they argue that the interpreter of religion must "get inside" the religious consciousness? What is the relationship between popular belief in a tradition and the philosophers and theologians in the same tradition? What does it mean to say that religion is a projection? If religion is regarded as a projection, how does this claim yield useful principles of interpretation? What, in Van A. Harvey recently retired from the George Edwin Burnell Professorship of Religious Studies at Stanford University, Stanford, CA 94305. 877</page><page sequence="2">878 Journal of the American Academy of Religion fact, are the hermeneutical principles that guide such (suspicious) inter- pretations? Are such interpretations reductionistic? What is reduction- ism? What are the grounds for thinking that religious beliefs, as some suspicious interpreters have claimed, are "alienating"? What does it mean to say that a religious belief is "alienating"? If religions express the deepest wishes and longings of the human heart, as some suspicious interpreters argue, why aren't human beings justified in clinging to them even if they are false? I wrote about Feuerbach because his work casts light on these issues, although a reader of Hardwick's review would scarcely conclude this is the case since he is so preoccupied with his own theological project. Hardwick's basic criticism, in fact, stems from his theological con- cerns. He claims that Feuerbach's basic hermeneutical principle-the interpreter of any religion must listen to and do justice to the immediate utterances of the naive religious consciousness-blocks any left-leaning theology because it "privileges" literalism and supernaturalism. Hardwick thinks that such a principle necessarily identifies religion with a childish wish-fulfillment and fails to recognize that the immediate expressions of religion may themselves undermine such infantilism; and he cites what in my view are some very dubious examples of this: early Buddhism, Luther, and Bultmann among others. Hardwick then incredibly claims that "no more than a moment's reflection" shows this principle to be dubious. I write "incredibly" because Hardwick must be aware of all that has recently been written on just this issue by anthropologists like Stewart Guthrie and Melford Spiro. But apart from that, he can only accuse me of heavy-handedness in this mat- ter by systematically ignoring the contexts in which I discuss at length a) Feuerbach's analysis of the conceptual relationships in Christian thought between the concept of God and the doctrines of resurrection, creation, providence, miracle, and the practice of prayer; b) Feuerbach's compli- cated and profound discussion of anxiety and desire, and especially the desire for recognition that is endemic to the self by virtue of its I-Thou structure; c) the problem of reductionism; and, finally, d) the contempo- rary discussions concerning the omnipresence of anthropomorphism in religion, even in Buddhism (Guthrie; Spiro 1972). Consider, for example, c) the problem of reductionism. Phenome- nologists of religion argue that in order to understand any religion, one must "get inside" the religious consciousness, or, to use Peter Berger's formulation, view it "in terms of the meanings intended by the religious consciousness" (129). They claim that suspicious interpreters of religion- that is, interpreters who profess to explain religion in terms of psycho- logical or sociological causes-fail to do this and are reductionistic. In my book I argue that Feuerbach, unlike many other suspicious interpreters,</page><page sequence="3">Harvey: Responses and Rejoinders 879 accepts this phenomenological procedure and, hence, is exempt from this criticism. He prided himself on being only a "listener" to Christian be- lievers. He wanted to discover and not invent their meaning, in contrast to those speculative philosophers of religion like Hegel who try to make "religion say only what it has itself thought, and expressed far better than religion; it assigns a meaning to religion without any reference to the actual meaning of religion... ." (Feuerbach 1957: xxxv). It is just because Feuerbach did listen to what religious believers them- selves do and say that he concluded, as have a host of interpreters in- cluding Max Weber, Peter Berger, Robert Bellah, Robin Horton, Melford Spiro, and Stewart Guthrie, that religious believers manifest what Spiro has identified as'three types of desires: cognitive, substantive, and expres- sive (1987: chap.8). Cognitively, religions serve to provide explanations for otherwise inexplicable phenomena, especially suffering. Religions, to use Peter Berger's phrase, are theodicies. Substantively, religious people almost universally pray for things like the recovery from illness, safety in precarious situations, rain in drought, and the avoidance of death. And, finally, religion has to do with desires springing from feelings of helpless- ness, inadequacy, guilt, anxiety, and gratitude. All of these desires, (one might even write "needs") ground the basic religious faith that the "not- I," all those forces that impinge on the I, are not indifferent to human wel- fare. It was not Feuerbach but the anthropologist Spiro who wrote that the most obvious basis for religious behavior is the one that the religious actors themselves give us and, he adds, "unlike some anthropologists, I believe... [them]" (1987: 211). To argue, as Hardwick does, that Feuerbach's interpretive principle leads him to identify "religion wholesale with a kind of wish-fulfilling childishness" is a misleading simplification because it ignores a) Feuer- bach's distinction between religion generally and Christianity particularly, and b) Feuerbach's extremely rich and complicated analysis of wish and desire, which, in turn, is rooted in his anthropology. Considered gener- ally, Feuerbach believed that religion is an overdetermined phenomenon; that is, it has many causes and grounds. But basically he believed that the self-conscious "I" emerges out of the relationship to other "Thou's" and to nature. As an embodied human organism the I is in the grip of a Promethean drive to flourish but is confronted by a multitude of powers within and without (the not-I) that limit it but on which it is absolutely dependent. Wanting to feel at home in a universe that will ultimately kill it and desiring the recognition by others, the I attempts to reduce the mysteriousness of these powers by personalizing them or by transforming the not-I into a superhuman power that fulfills this Promethean desire, the desire to transcend the necessities of nature and death.</page><page sequence="4">880 Journal of the American Academy of Religion In general, Feuerbach argued, religion may be seen as a (mis)interpre- tation of nature, the not-I. But he knew that nature lends itself to many different conceptual imaginings and symbolisms. For the archaic person who is directly dependent on it, nature is alive and filled with benign and evil beings. But as cultures become more complex and human beings achieve greater independence from nature, the gods must assume new domains. Both Zeus and Yahweh, for example, were originally nature gods that gradually became transformed into deities presiding over the moral and civil order (Feuerbach 1971:48ff.). Feuerbach viewed monotheism as the highest intensification of two drives: to unify the forces of the not-I and to achieve recognition and significance for the self. It does this by seeing the deity as the creator of nature and as a subject concerned with the well-being of every human person. In the Essence of Christianity he was even willing to call Christi- anity the "absolute religion" because in the doctrines of incarnation and resurrection, Christianity claims that God is willing to sacrifice his only Son for human welfare. Hardwick calls this Christian belief "infantile" and argues that exis- tential analysis shows that it can be reduced to a "self-understanding" that doesn't necessarily make reference to a transcendent power. In a sense, Feuerbach also believed that Christianity is infantile, but as a good phe- nomenologist, he derived it from the Christian's own consciousness, a consciousness based on a faith in a unified, transcendent power to which the Christian can pray, achieve recognition, and liberation from sin and death. Nor was Feuerbach's view of the Christian consciousness in this regard totally dependent upon the naive believer, as Hardwick alleges. Feuerbach was intimately familiar with the history of Christian theology, with Augustine, medieval theology, Calvin, and, above all, Luther. He argued that these theologians only thematize and systematize these so- called naive beliefs. In a chapter Hardwick completely ignores, I point out that Feuerbach took his basic understanding of Christianity from Luther who believed that the resurrection was the central doctrine of Christianity because it is here that believers can sensuously perceive that the deity is not limited by nature and that it desires the eternal well being of the in- dividual. A second basic complaint Hardwick registers is that despite the fact that Feuerbach's "infantile" interpretive principle seems to block the pos- sibilities of a constructive theology, there is, in fact, a basic element in his thought, the "naturalistic-existentialist" paradigm, that is promising for theology, a paradigm that I, myself, employed in my earlier work. And he notes that in the Feuerbach book "Harvey himself briefly hints at alterna-</page><page sequence="5">Harvey: Responses and Rejoinders 881 tive theological strategies in formulas of great power.. .." For example, at several places in the book I argue that many contemporary Protestant theologians like Tillich, Bultmann, or H.R. Niebuhr could accept Feuer- bach's analysis of the I confronted by the not-I as well as his analysis of the role of anxiety, the will to life, and the desire for recognition and meaning. It is true that I suggest that these modern Protestant theologians could basically accept Feuerbach's analysis of the human situation, but I also make clear that, unlike Feuerbach, they all assume a) that the powers (the not-I) that impinge on the self are the manifestations of one unified power, b) that Jesus is the revealer of this power, and c) that this power can be trusted. Feuerbach rejects all three of these points. He argues that the ten- dencies inherent in language seduce us into thinking that abstractions like "First Cause" and "Being" refer to a unified whole. He also argues that Jesus only reveals how much we long for recognition; and he does not understand what it means to trust these powers because they are utterly indifferent to the well-being of any individual. Finally, he thinks that this faith reflects a kind of narcissism and leads to all the evils against which Nietzsche was also to protest. Hardwick concedes that those theologians I mention do believe these things, but he claims that their "metaphysical and ontological assumptions are not given with an existentialist analysis of faith itself." Hardwick believes that existentialism has shown that faith is a "self-understanding of ourselves in the world" and that this self-understanding does not re- quire reference to a transcendent being of any kind. Hardwick believes that he can give an adequate and persuasive (existentialist) translation of Christian faith for modernity that is completely naturalistic and even physicalistic. But by arguing in this way Hardwick simply begs the issue in question, namely, whether can one give an adequate analysis of Christian faith without taking seriously what the believers and theologians them- selves say, especially when the sophisticated believers in this case wouldn't recognize themselves in a naturalistic reduction. Hardwick's view raises all of the problems concerning the significance of existentialism for hermeneutics, and any attempt to sort them out here would take me beyond the limits the editor has assigned. But in an over- simplified fashion one can say that the problems are these: a) whether and how Christian faith can be said to be a "self-understanding in the world" if by this we mean that it does not necessarily make any reference to a benign, transcendent reality; b) whether Feuerbach's use of Dasein is com- patible with Heidegger's, especially given Feuerbach's emphasis on I-Thou relationships; c) whether existentialist analysis is formal and neutral and can therefore translate what any concrete religious faith "really means";</page><page sequence="6">882 Journal of the American Academy of Religion and d) whether theologians like Buri and Bultmann are inconsistent with existentialism in so far as they believe that Christian faith refers to a tran- scendent reality. But the reader will immediately notice that by slipping into a discus- sion of these problems we are now engaged in what Kierkegaard would have called "a galloping parenthesis." We began by asking questions that concern many of us in religious studies, and we suddenly find ourselves discussing the distinction between "existential" and "existentiell," whether the content of the latter must be restricted by the former, whether Hei- degger's analytic is merely a formal conceptuality for the theologian or restricts what the theologian can say, whether Heidegger's "in-the world" sufficiently does justice to the I-Thou nature of human existence, etc. All these questions may be important for existentialist theologians, but I do not see why I should have addressed them in a final chapter of my book, a chapter that could only have been superficial in any case given the com- plexity of these issues.
