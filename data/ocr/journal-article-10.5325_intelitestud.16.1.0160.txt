         <title>ENL 270: LANDSCAPE LITERATURE AND THINKING ABOUT “THINKING LIKE A MOUNTAIN”</title>
         <p>Aldo Leopold, possibly the most renowned conservationist in recent history, understood well the need to chart both what was happening in the landscape and what was occurring in the minds of people living at increasingly great distances from “wildness.” He lamented that “the most serious obstacle impeding the evolution of a land ethic is the fact that our educational and economic system is headed away from, rather than toward, an intense consciousness of the land.” He declared, moreover, in a warning given decades before the advent of the Web or the invention of the personal computer, that your “true modern [individual] is separated from the land by many middlemen, and by innumerable physical gadgets. He has no relationship to it; to him it is the space between cities on which crops grow” (261). Mindful of this warning, the aim of this article and of the environmental literature course out of which it grows is, in part, to help students develop “a consciousness of the land” by creating learning experiences that require them to act and think in ways out of sync with our culture's common routines and patterns.</p>
         <p>Until relatively recently, I had struggled as a teacher to heed Leopold's admonitions and to develop the kinds of experiences for my students I wanted them to have in order that they might understand and enact what Leopold famously refers to as the “land ethic” (237–64). But then, fortunately, my interests in narrative theory introduced me to cognitive studies and, specifically, to that subset of this field of inquiry concerned with both evolution and education. The more I read around in these overlapping areas, the more I realized that they could help me to help my students begin to see and appreciate the connections between what they think and how they act and between the ephemeral world of ideas and the more concrete, empirical one associated with the land. To be sure, if there is one thing that cognitive studies makes clear, it is that the mind does not work in isolation and that individuals thus do not read, write, or perform any other intellectual feats without direct input from the body.</p>
         <p>Excited by what I was learning as one fairly new to narrative theory who had stumbled upon cognitive studies, I eagerly reworked my environmental literature course, making several significant changes. The most notable of these, and the one that seeks to change not just what but how students think about and <italic>in</italic> the environment and the literature it inspires, is a series of eight challenges, each of which contributes to a semester-long assignment referred to as the “Cognitive Phenology Journal.” The title plays upon the course's dual focus on phenology—defined as “the study of the timing of recurring biological events, the causes of their timing with regard to biotic and abiotic forces, and the interrelation among phases of the same or different species” (Lieth 444)—and cognition, meaning the shifting, evolving internal landscape of the students' minds.</p>
         <p>Before elaborating on the ways that this assignment draws upon cognitive theory—and in an attempt to braid together environmental literature, cognitive and evolutionary approaches to instruction, and a concern for the environment—this article will address three questions: first, what are the benefits of embracing a cognitive approach to environmental literature when one's course serves as an elective in an environmental studies program designed for humanities and science students? Second, how has an adoption of evolutionary theory in a literature course altered my objectives, readings, and assignments? Third, and finally, what are the challenges and drawbacks of teaching environmental literature in this way to students with a range of familiarity with literary analysis and cognitive studies?</p>
         <p>Guided by these questions and written with multiple audiences in mind, including my fellow literature teachers as well as my colleagues in other disciplines under the environmental studies umbrella, this article details the extent to which my ENL 270 Environmental Literature course has developed in recent years. It addresses the changes that resulted from an influx of science majors when the course was folded into an environmental studies major and from my own exposure to cognitive studies by way of narrative theory. For many of my students, an ecological approach to literature represents a rather logical step from the science lab to environmental course on culture; for their teacher, it marks a large leap from a familiar place of comfort (one marked by cognitive dissonance) to one of intellectual unease and excitement.</p>

         <title>THE BENEFITS OF TAKING A COGNITIVE, ECOLOGICAL APPROACH TO ENVIRONMENTAL LITERATURE</title>
         <p>One upshot of an evolutionary approach to landscape literature is the rejection of Cartesian dualism, which runs counter to an ecological understanding of our place in nature and nature's place in us. While embracing an interdisciplinary conception of learning and while resisting the temptation to privilege mind over matter or art over science, this methodology validates the thinking of <italic>all</italic> students, regardless of their academic focus. And what better time to adopt this educational approach than now, when, according to David Herman's “Narrative Theory after the Second Cognitive Revolution,” the pendulum has swung to a place along the “mind in here” and the “world out there” spectrum between two extremes, a place that resists dichotomized thinking (161). These circumstances represent the optimal time for environmental studies students to engage narrative-rich cultural representations so as to understand better actual environmental issues and problems.</p>
         <p>While students from the humanities and, to a certain extent, the social sciences are relatively comfortable within academic fields that produce and analyze representations, those from the sciences are typically more accustomed to engaging with the material world, including that part of it encompassed by the physical brain. To serve the latter group, I rely on an instructional approach that seeks to help all my students understand how, why, and to what effect the human brain (as opposed to the mind) employs representations to comprehend and, just as often, alter the physical world we inhabit. In so doing, my methodology attempts to engage what Dan Lloyd considers “a fundamental question of cognitive science,” which is to say, “the science of dynamic representing systems” (x).</p>
         <p>Properly, the matter of how the mind conceives of the brain and, by extension, how cognitive theory can plumb this relationship by analyzing cultural representations sheds light on a similar question central to environmental literature: mainly, how does the human brain understand experiences in and of nature through art, language, and literature? Or, to put it another way, how do environmental writers such as Wendell Berry, Rachel Carson, and Edward Abbey represent their physical and cognitive experiences in the real world and, how, in turn, do readers imagine approximate experiences in their internal, mind-based storyworlds from which they gain the kind of knowledge that they can apply to the writer's reality as well as their own? To be sure, these questions embolden those of us housed in the humanities to incorporate cognitive studies into our environmental literature courses.</p>
         <p>As an added bonus, cognitive cultural studies embraces an evolutionary model of both epistemology and ontology; in this respect, it fits well with those fields common to environmental studies that understand phenomena in the natural world in terms of their origins, adaptations (including cognitive ones), and ongoing alterations (Gottschall 255–57; Carroll 27–32). Certainly, a benefit of taking an evolutionary approach when working with science students is that it strengthens connections between the real and constructed worlds the students inhabit. As anyone in the humanities who has worked closely with environmental studies students will likely attest, many of the students are often rightly concerned not with literary representations but instead with the problems connected with the endangered environment outside the classroom. They are quick to ask or at least wonder, “Why do we have to read literary essays and books?” and, “Why would we read these things now when Rome [and the rest of the world] is burning?” The reason, strangely, has to do with how we have evolved and how our culture has been a player in that evolution at least since the Pleistocene epoch.</p>
         <p>As I try to make apparent through discussion prompts and test questions, we can study narrative-based literature for evidence of the inestimable ways in which it dramatizes cognition occurring in both real and constructed worlds during different eras. We can study this literature, moreover, for proof of the suggestion that “narrative thinking is fundamental to survival” (Easterlin, “‘Who Was It’” 79).</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s03">
         <title>THE EFFECTS OF EVOLUTIONARY COGNITION ON OBJECTIVES, ASSIGNMENTS, AND ACTIVITIES</title>
         <p>Whereas previously the outcomes for my environmental literature course were somewhat synonymous with those associated with my other literature courses, they are now much more informed by evolutionary approaches to both theory and practice. In contrast to rather imprecise objectives that included (1) to read literary works well, and (2) to distinguish the salient features and conventions of a literary tradition, the new ones address what exactly the students will do and why. They include these: student will learn (1) to analyze the ways narrative “mediates between” the “canonical world of culture” and the real world of nature (<italic>Acts of Meaning</italic>, Bruner 55), (2) to examine works of literature to determine how our experiences of the land are altered when incorporated into memory (shared or singular) via culture/narrative, (3) to reflect on one's thinking and actions in/about/on nature, and (4) to “think like a mountain” and, by extension, to understand what it means in scientific as well as nonscientific terms to do so. These reworked goals speak with both more accuracy and temerity to the aims of the course while avoiding the tendency to alienate students from fields of inquiry outside of the humanities.</p>
         <p>Of course, as anyone who has written course objectives knows full well, it is one thing to generate a neat, parallel list of bulleted aspirations in early August or late December; it is something else entirely to select readings, design writing assignments, and develop activities that increase the odds that the students will actually achieve them. Yet, in my experience, these outcomes are much more attainable when one's pedagogy is informed by cognition and, in an environmental literature course, evolution. Hence, the core readings for the course have not changed significantly, but the secondary, theoretical ones have been revised as a result of the increased emphasis on cognitive studies. Students still read the tacit canon of primary works, which include <italic>Walden</italic>, <italic>A Sand County Almanac</italic>, <italic>Pilgrim at Tinker Creek</italic>, <italic>Refuge</italic>, and <italic>Desert Solitaire</italic>, and they continue to study the standard exemplum of ecocriticism represented by those authors whose essays are contained in the <italic>Ecocriticism Reader: Landmarks in Literary Ecology</italic>, edited by Cheryll Glotfelty and Harold Fromm. Added to these now are works by scholars in cognitive studies mentioned above, including Carroll, Easterlin, Gottschall, and Zunshine. The addition of these theorists enhances how the students understand the primary texts as well as how effectively they engage a set of theories that locate the creation and interpretation of the texts in reality, as opposed to in some ahistorical, impersonal context somehow outside its reach.</p>
         <p>The writing assignments for the course have likewise changed considerably. Before I embraced a cognitive approach to the course, the three writing assignments I gave were nearly identical to those I had used in other sophomore-level literature courses. The first involved a fairly traditional, formalist analysis intended to force the students to focus mainly on the literary text rather than on environmental problems with which the work's subject matter dealt. The second entailed freeing up the students to be more creative, to produce, for instance, an essay, poem, or short story in line with those they had been reading. The third instructed the students to synthesize what they had been reading by identifying a theme or literary convention that appeared in two or more works we had read.</p>
         <p>Now, in contrast, the writing assignments direct the students from different academic majors to draw upon their knowledge and to yield to their inclinations to read the works in certain disciplinary ways. The first assignment invites students to understand literature as an index of “culture's account of what makes human beings tick” (<italic>Acts of Meaning</italic>, Bruner 13). It instructs the students to focus on how the text works—that is, on its formal literary elements—while also being aware of its narratological features. At the same time, it encourages the students to consider the role that the environment plays in the text and exerts on the consciousness of its author. The second assignment, again creative in nature, emphasizes more than before the importance of reflection. Students are instructed to develop ways to explore a theme or issue and, in some form, present that to their classmates; they are then required to write about the ways that this work deepened or altered their thinking about ecology and ecological literature. I have been amazed by the ways the students can, through music, art, food, film, photography, and even fashion, stretch their minds by means of their inventive responses to the assignment.</p>
         <p>The third assignment builds on the second while drawing on the benefits of collaboration. Working in interdisciplinary groups of three or four, students analyze a shared text or topic from different angles. Some trained in environmental history or biology can examine a historically situated work, such as William Bartram's <italic>Travels Through North and South Carolina, Georgia, East and West Florida, the Cherokee Country, etc</italic>. (1791), to determine if certain species accounted for in the text have remained or, possibly, migrated north because of climate change, while other students trained in psychology can study the writer's thinking for evidence of alterations in perceptions of nature and culture. And because landscape literature is essentially about “experientiality,” or the felt impact of actual and narrated experiences on one's consciousness (Herman 174), members of a group can analyze works along the lines of Wendell Berry's “An Entrance Into the Woods” or Kate Chopin's <italic>The Awakening</italic> in order to identify cultural baselines regarding such issues as wildness or freedom as they are associated with “nature.”</p>
         <p>Yet, despite the significant and essential nature of these changes to the course, they do not go far enough in the direction of helping students to begin to “think like a mountain.” More to the point, perhaps, the assignments—though useful and instructive—do not quite fully enable students to appreciate why and how a writer such as Leopold would employ this type of oblique and highly literary kind of instruction. This is where the challenges and accompanying “Cognitive Phenology Journal” come into the picture. Summarized below are the specific challenges along with an explanation of the pedagogical upshots of these physical and cognitive tasks. Taken from the syllabus, the assignment reads as follows:
<disp-quote>
               <p>During the term, you will be invited to participate in a number of challenges designed to encourage and enable you to think more deeply about the texts we are reading and, as importantly, about your relationship to the landscape (literal and literary) to which they refer. You will be asked to reflect often in your journal on your efforts to participate in the activities and to understand how your thinking evolved as a consequence of engaging the readings, participating in discussions, and taking on the various challenges.</p>
            </disp-quote>
         </p>
         <p>Challenge 1, “Becoming a Budding Phenologist (Pun Intended),” instructs the students to select a plot of land that they can visit two three times a week for a ten or twenty minutes at a time (“it can be on campus, near the river, near home … wherever, as long as it's outside”). The students are to spend time in that space observing, recording, and reflecting on what they find, see, feel, hear, and think. They can record their observations and reflections in a notebook, create a blog, use pictures with comments, “whatever, just as long as you carefully observe, record, and reflect on what you find and think in that place.”</p>
         <p>Challenge 2, “Bird Watchers and Tree Huggers,” involves learning, by sight, sound, shape, and feel, about the birds and trees of Minnesota. Throughout the semester, I post each week on the course Moodle site a bird from the <italic>Birds of Minnesota Field Guide</italic>, and in class I provide the students with leaves and bark from various trees. On the midterm and again on the final, I include a matching section that involves identifying birds and trees by sight, sound, or texture. Sometimes the students must be able, for instance, to identify a bird by its call or a tree by the feel of its bark or the shape of its leaf. When learning to identify these, students must employ more than merely their sense of sight. (To observe students prior to an exam fingering leaves and whistling bird calls in order to review what they have studied is to witness something special from a teaching standpoint.) So often our educational system insists that students separate the mind from the rest of the body when learning, a trend that is at odds with cognitive evolution and course content and goals (Easterlin, “‘Who Was It’” 86).</p>
         <p>Challenge 3, “Stop Frittering Away Your Life,” invokes Thoreau's warning that “our life is frittered away by detail” and insists that students seek stability in the form of “simplicity, simplicity, simplicity!” The challenge: spend five days straight in the same outfit. In keeping with <italic>Walden</italic> and Thoreau's counsel about the distractions sure to accompany the life individuals would lead in an industrialized world, the challenge calls attention to the ways that <italic>stuff</italic> alters our habits and clutters or compromises our thinking.</p>
         <p>Challenge 4, “A Pilgrimage to the Shack,” is often the most difficult and enlightening of the challenges. Students are invited to clear their entire schedule on a Friday midway through the term for a field trip to the site of Leopold's shack, near Baraboo, Wisconsin, an eight-hour round-trip drive from our campus in Minneapolis. This entails significant prioritizing, as many students must decide whether to miss a practice, a game, other classes, work, or social events.</p>
         <p>Challenge 5, “Bear Grylls Has Nothing On You,” pushes students to experience twenty-four uninterrupted hours in the outdoors. When the default location for an environmental course is a temperature-controlled classroom, one has to agree with Leopold that our education system is headed in the wrong direction (261). With this in mind, the Cognitive Phenology assignment challenges the students to go camping for at least one consecutive day and night.</p>
         <p>Challenge 6, “Going off the Grid,” is in keeping with the course's content and its emphasis on both consciousness and unconsciousness. This one asks students to go off the grid for three days. This can mean giving up one's cell phone, resisting the temptation to log on to Facebook, ignoring e-mails, avoiding optional uses of electricity, and so on. It is up to the students to decide on the particulars of this trial. The goal is to make them cognizant of how technology is altering their thinking and wicking its way into their routines at unacknowledged levels. Many students have reported how conscious they have become of unconscious, technology-driven tendencies, such as reaching for a cell phone the second they leave a room or feeling the buzz of a message in the pocket, even when the phone is turned off and stowed away. These are instructive insights for those who regularly admit having negligible awareness of the extent to which technology is shaping their schedules and rewiring their minds.</p>
         <p>Challenge 7, “Can I Borrow Your Book?” is likely unique among the tests. Connected with Daniel Quinn's <italic>Ishmael: An Adventure of the Mind and Spirit</italic>, it asks students to avoid buying the book and to instead persuade someone who owns it, preferably a stranger, to give it to them for free. Extending this a bit more in the direction of the unconventional, the challenge enjoins students to convince that person to let the student give the book to somebody else when he or she finishes with it. Designed to create authentic, critical exchanges within a community of learners, the challenge nudges students out of familiar ruts. As opposed to ordering the book anonymously online and living safely in cyberspace, they have to interact with others in meaningful ways. In so doing, they help establish a network of people who think ecologically or, at least, have an ecological book in common.</p>
         <p>Challenge 8, “Breaking Bad (Habits),” is an opportunity for students to design their own challenge, one that they must link in some way to a common reading and a certain behavior (physical or mental) they wish to break, or, at the very least, become more aware of.</p>
         <p>Challenges 1, 2, and 8, are mandatory; the others are optional, at least in part. Sometimes students are simply unable to participate fully in some of the more demanding challenges. This is to be expected, given all the variables at play in the lives of each individual. Because of scheduling conflicts associated with work, school, or extracurricular activities, some students, for instance, cannot make the trip to Leopold's shack and others cannot arrange to go camping, even for a day. And some students, for more personal though not less significant reasons, simply cannot imagine doing without one or more of their favorite technological addictions, such as Facebook or e-mail. But regardless of whether and to what extent students attempt such relatively strange academic undertakings as spending a week wearing the same outfit or tracking down a stranger who is willing to give away his or her copy of <italic>Ishmail</italic>, all students must record their efforts (or lack thereof) associated with each of the eight challenges in their cognitive phenology journal. This requirement underlines the fact that the assignment's main objective has less to do with forcing students out of their physical comfort zones and more to do with making them aware of their predictable, almost subconscious ways of living in and thinking about the environment and their relationship to it. In many instances, it is as illuminating for students to reflect upon the numerous, often unnoted factors and priorities that prevent them from, for example, going off the grid or getting outdoors as it is for them to have undertaken or completed these challenges.</p>
         <p>In terms of assessment, the final grade for the assignment thus reflects how well and in what manner the students articulate their thinking about their actions, their habits, and their habitual ways of living. In view of these self-assessment criteria, journal entries that most incisively and honestly examine what the student did or did not accomplish in relation to a challenge and in the context of classroom discussions and readings receive the highest marks. That said, I will come clean here and admit what I confess to the students, which is that those on the bubble of a grade for the assignment will benefit from having given as many of the challenges as possible the old college try. It is, I am pleased to report, mostly a throwaway threat, however, as nearly all the students generally attempt all the challenges. I would venture to say that 75–85 percent of the students undertake all eight challenges while 90 percent attempt at least five. I have, moreover, yet to have a student not submit a phenology journal.</p>
         <p>In part, my goal with this assignment is to counter the implicit understanding commonly, though often unknowingly, shared among many of my students and colleagues, one captured, in part, by Bruner in <italic>Acts of Meaning</italic>. When defending the proposition that culture and biology participate in a dynamic relationship, Bruner rejects the counterproposal from the sciences that holds that culture is an “‘overlay’ on biologically determined human nature.” He argues instead that “culture and the quest for meaning within culture are the proper cause of human action” (20). I believe it is a matter of both/and, and I assign the cognitive phenology journal with this in mind. Students' ways of thinking about their actions, their thoughts, their habits, the literature, and the numerous problems and solutions specific to the environment are, I expect, affected and infected by both culture (meaning, in this case, the readings) and biology (or their innate, inherited predilections and those dealt with by the various writers and theorists).</p>
         <p>Pedagogically speaking, the journal that accompanies the challenges unfolds against two intersecting backdrops, one pertaining to environmental literature and the other to cognitive science. As for the former, we have examples, admonitions, and instructions from the likes of Thoreau, Leopold, Abbey, and others, each providing students with models regarding how to live one's life in a constantly shifting, increasingly automated culture.</p>
         <p>When introducing the assignment, it helps to remind the students that the tasks are optional, and it also helps to invite them, and sincerely encourage them, to stretch themselves both physically and mentally. As Roger Schank explains in <italic>Teaching Minds: How Cognitive Science Can Save Our Schools</italic>, students in most classroom situations “learn to shut off their natural learning instincts, the ones that drive them to improve because they really want to accomplish something” (1). I thus try hard to make it clear when outlining the challenges that these are, in truth, “challenges” and not requirements. As noted, the only requirement is that students reflect in writing or through some other form of expression on what they did or did not do. I stress that the point is not whether one meets the challenges but instead whether and how well one takes time to consider his or her efforts to do so and how our culture cooperated with or conspired against those efforts. If students participate in this way, their journal will offer them tangible evidence of their cognitive development. Although we may have, according to Bruner, crossed the “divide in human evolution … when culture became the major factor in giving form to the mind of those living under its sway,” this does not mean we cannot reclaim our connection to the land or come to a more conscious understanding of our culture's impact on our minds (11–12).</p>
         <p>As for achieving the final course objective, learning to “think like a mountain” and nurturing the students' capacity to understand what it means to do so in scientific as well as nonscientific terms, this is where a cognitive approach to this course truly saves the day. For years, I have tried with only limited success to convey to my students what it means in the context of Leopold's <italic>A Sand County Almanac</italic> (1949) to “think like a mountain.” I have attempted (and, again, mostly failed) to make it clear what is involved when one learns to think about environmental issues from within one's particular place in time and from outside it as well, to think, in other words, both within and across time at once. In short, I had tried to help my students think creatively, literarily, subjectively, and scientifically about themselves and their environment. I had employed a blend of readings, prompts, and assignments so as to cultivate a certain intellectual sensibility, one not unlike that of Leopold and others of his ilk. And while on occasion I had enjoyed some success because of factors and good fortune likely out of my control, now, at last—because I can lay ecological cognition and narrative theory atop of <italic>A Sand County Almanac</italic> and other similar environmental texts—I can talk with my students using specific terms and theories about expanding their understanding of “the mind” to include a larger, more vibrant context, one that includes the perspective of “the land.” As a case in point, I turn to David Herman, who echoes Leopold when explaining that we cannot isolate ourselves or even our minds in time and space: “Memory, perception, emotion—in short, the mind—do not reside beneath the surface of [a] character's [or an environmental writer's] verbal and nonverbal actions but rather spread out as a distributional flow in what they do and say … [;] the material setting … constitutes part of the interaction, the method of narratorial mediation used to present the characters' verbal and nonverbal activities, and readers' own engagement with all of these representational structures” (157–58).</p>
         <p>Similar to Leopold's analogic idea of a mountain that <italic>thinks</italic> about the impact of seemingly isolated, individual events, laws, and policies over time, Herman's notion of the mind as something more than an abstract entity merely represented by “verbal and nonverbal actions” illuminates what it means to “think like a mountain” as a student of the environment and environmental literature. Herman argues that the mind is a thing distributed in “the material setting” and thus made manifest in characters' words and actions and the readers' cognitive “engagement” with the “representational structures”; accordingly, enabling students of the environment to understand the mind in this way, as that which is distributed over time and space and constituted by what they do and say in the actual environment, is critical. Doing so helps them comprehend, if only slightly, Leopold's notion of how mountains likewise “think” as material settings across large spans of time.</p>
         <p>Achieving this type of cognition is, of course, no small feat; but it is something, studies suggest, that flocks of birds, schools of fish, and even strains of viruses manage to do without thinking, at least in a conventional, anthropomorphic manner (Evernden). It is something that the course is designed to both examine—as it is modeled by certain nature writers—and, when possible, cultivate.</p>
         <p>Thankfully, cognitive and evolutionary approaches to literature in particular and to learning in general at last provide the means of making this outcome more attainable. Because we in the humanities possess the theoretical backing of evolutionary approaches to cognition, and because of “the discursive turn in psychology” that allows us to talk with our students about the “mind as distributed,” we can better develop assignments, select readings, and guide discussions that help all our students understand what it means to think ecologically. Truly, if there is one goal I have for my students regardless of discipline, it is that they can comprehend this odd but sensible ideal as expressed by Leopold. Short of that, I would settle as a teacher of literature for helping science students appreciate Leopold's literary way of talking about imprudent environmental policies and their unfortunate, often irreversible impacts on the land.</p>

         <title>CONCLUSION: THE POTENTIAL PITFALLS OF LOSING ONE'S MIND</title>
         <p>Although the potential pitfalls for teaching a sophomore-level literature foregrounding cognition and evolutionary theory are many, none represents a deal breaker. To begin with, there are the usual challenges associated with interdisciplinary teaching. These include (1) determining how much, if any, literary theory the students have had; (2) creating a set of assignments and readings that serves those for whom the course is but an academic anomaly as well as those for whom it represents a stage in their overall development; (3) knowing when to foreground theory and when to embed it in text selections, discussion prompts, and assignment instructions; and (4) keeping all the students interested most, if not all, of the time.</p>
         <p>Finally, on a more personal note, one of the potential downsides associated with embracing an evolutionary approach to literary theory is the very real possibility of losing one's mind. While my research into literary Darwinism has helped me to identify inconsistencies in my thinking and teaching, and while it has enabled me to retool my environmental literature course so that it better meets the needs of all my students, it has simultaneously forced me (and, I suspect, many of my students from the fine arts and humanities) to reconsider many of my most beloved and comforting beliefs.</p>
         <p>Heartened during my research on evolutionary cognition by the cogent responses to those poststructuralists who so persuasively insist that we are not tethered to reality and that all is construct and discourse, I have often cheered inanely in the margins. I underlined ardently Joseph Carroll's rejection of “textualism and indeterminism” and Bruner's equally sanguine take on “constructivism” (<italic>Acts of Meaning</italic> 25); I made copies of essays by Easterlin, Graff, and Gottschall for colleagues up and down the hallway here in the humanities wing of the faculty building, giddy to have an explanation for why we should, as academics in the humanities, care about the world beyond the books we teach. Then, in my zealous pursuit of still more validation and pleasure, I happened upon Harold Fromm's <italic>The Nature of Being Human: From Environmentalism to Consciousness</italic>. There I got a taste of the medicine I was prescribing to my students in the humanities.</p>
         <p>Armed with evidence and sound logic, Fromm, in a chapter titled “Muses, Spooks, Neurons and the Rhetoric of ‘Freedom,”’ abolishes the self, the soul, heaven and earth, and, in the end, the mind I had thought was above, beyond, or outside my brain. He argues without caveats or qualifiers that the new science-based studies of cognition “and the extraordinarily sophisticated machines for brain exploration devised by high technology have thoroughly overturned—except in popular culture and religious superstition—the Cartesian dualism that dominated Western thought for so many years” (235).</p>
         <p>“Hurray!” I wanted to say. But I could not, because I am, I had nearly forgotten in the cerebral fervor, a Christian who, for a living, teaches culture in the form of literature at a Lutheran liberal arts college to students whose “billions of miniscule brain cells interact by means of their threadlike dendrites and axon to produce one million billion connections know as synapses” (Fromm 235). I paused. Then, my synapses fired back in “self” defense; and without meaning to I called to mind (or brain?) M. C. Escher's famous sketch of the hand drawing the hand. It was an effortless, unconscious example of cognitive blending that caught me off guard and, in so doing, suggested Fromm might be more right about my brain than I care to admit. That is a considerable price to pay and, perhaps, an unavoidable pitfall of this approach to teaching literature.</p>

         <title>AFTERWORD</title>
         <p>Yesterday evening, my office mate for five years at Marquette University and best friend for the past fifteen died after a long and brave battle with cancer. Whenever I wrote anything, I wrote it the first time around with her in mind, because she was always nice enough to lie to me, to say that what I had sent her was wonderful, inspired, whatever. Fromm tells me that she is gone now, completely, that the body and brain is all there is, that the rest is spooks; but I am not so sure. I hear her voice as plain as day inside my head as I write this, and when I went to Mass this morning there on the reader board the sign read, “God Made The Body To Last a While, The Soul For Eternity. Plan Ahead 2013.” She will be with me this fall and later this spring when I commute to work and back a couple hours a day and think when forgetting that I might give you a call to hear how your classes are going and to share an idea for an essay or a book I will never get around to writing … and even now when I do write something hardly worth sharing with the rest of the world, you won't be there to send it to, an excuse I so often used so that I might call you up out of the blue, hear your voice, and have a laugh. I will miss you, D.</p>
