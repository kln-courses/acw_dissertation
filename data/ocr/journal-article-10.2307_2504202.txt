<plain_text><page sequence="1">FRITZ MAUTHNER AS AN HISTORIAN GERSHON WEILER I The name of Fritz Mauthner (1849-1923) insofar as books on the history of philosophy mention it at all, is exclusively associated with his idea of a Critique of Language and with the substantial contributions he made to the subject he originated. This project, which he believed to be a revolutionary departure in philosophy, occupied him a lifetime. The three heavy volumes of his Beitraege zu einer Kritik der Sprache and the equally impressive three volumes of the Woerterbuch der Philosophie contain the complete theory and methodology, with a fair amount of detailed application, of this Critique.' It is less well known that he is also the author of a book of more than 2,000 pages, in four volumes, bearing the title Der Atheismus und seine Geschichte im Abendlande.2 He began to write this historical work in 1920,3 in his seventy-first year, and completed the correction of the final proofs of the last volume on his deathbed. In turning to history from philosophy, Mauthner followed the example of Hume, the philosopher he most admired. The project of the history of Atheism in Europe formed itself in his mind at the same time as that of the Critique and he regarded the History as an application of his theory of language-criticism.4 But Mauthner wrote after Hegel and this fact necessarily left its mark on his method of historical writing, even though he was a follower of Hume and an enemy of Hegel. The systematic connection between the philosophical and the historical part of Mauthner's work goes deeper than that. When he tried, late in life, to trace the influences which suggested to him the idea of a critique of language, he counted after Otto Ludwig, Ernst Mach and Bismarck the impact of Nietzsche's Vom Nutzen und Nachteil der Historie fuer das Leben as a very decisive one.5 This work of Nietzsche is essentially an attack on 1 Cf. my "On Fritz Mauthner's Critique of Language", Mind, LXVII (1958), 80-87. 2 Stuttgart and Berlin, 1921-23., Referred to below as GA. 3 Contribution to Raymund Schmidt (ed.), Die Philosophie der Gegenwart in Selbst- darstellungen (Leipzig, 1924), Vol. 3, 131.

Nietzsche argues that what the Hegelians described as his- torical laws are "nothing but the commonest knowledge" 6 and (assuming they exist) are basically unfruitful, even crippling for action. The idea that history is rational is rejected by Nietzsche without reservation: How few living men have the right to live as against those mighty dead! That the many live and those few live no longer, is simply a brutal truth, that is, a piece of unalterable folly, a blank wall of "it was once so" against the moral judgment "it ought not to have been".7 Such a view fitted in well with Mauthner's empiricist inspirations coming from other sources. He summarized the influence of Nietzsche in these words: So we had, at one stroke, an antidote against the historical illness. The history of mankind is unreasonable or irrational, it is a history of accidents (Zufalls- geschichte); there are no historical laws.8 The basic problem Mauthner had to face, therefore, was how historiography is possible on the assumption that history is a series of accidents. Nietzsche never attempted to write history and so never had to face this problem. Concerning Hume it has been shown that he was unable to apply consistently his philosophical principles to his historical writing. The purpose of this paper is to examine Mauthner's historiographical procedure in the light of his philosophical assumptions and to relate these, so far as is possible, to Geistes- geschichte and the history of ideas. However, something ought to be said first about the critique of language. Mauthner's Critique of Language could perhaps best be described as an account of ordinary language from the point of view of radical empiricism. Mauthner's question is whether knowledge of the world is possible at all. His negative answer is based on three fundamental facts. First, all our knowledge comes to us through our senses and our senses are accidental, i.e., we can record only those features of reality for which we happen to possess the appropriate recording apparatus. Second, all our knowledge is expressed in language. It follows that a great deal of what is true of the world is not recorded by our senses and is therefore never expressed in language. However, this in itself would not yet entail a sceptical position and Mauthner could argue that concerning those matters which are recorded by our senses 6 Oscar Levy (ed.), The Complete Works of Friedrich Nietzsche (Edinburgh and Lon- don, 1910), V, 53. 7 Ibid., 74. 8 E, 223.

That he was ultimately doubtful even about the little we claim to know is due to a third factor, i.e., his analysis of the language we use to describe our experiences. Mauthner held that language is essentially misleading. The most obviously misleading characteristic of language is its inherent substantivizing tendency. Where our senses record only qualities or changes of qualities, we are in- clined to talk about things, about entities which exist in a self-contained manner. The process of abstraction, by which we reach these substances, is essentially nothing but the consistent use of the grammatical substantive. In fact, there is no limit to the use of substantives. This is how we find ourselves talking about values, laws or other most general concepts as if they were there to be discovered and talked about. It is easy to see how the concept of causality comes to be rejected on the basis of these considerations: ... the belief in the real world collapses together with another most ancient article of belief, which we pretend to be science.. . the belief in causality, with the belief in a connection of cause and effect in nature. I remark, by the way, that the belief in causality is really even more childish and more primitive (ursprueng- lich) than the religion of reality.9 While this is essentially a Humean position, nevertheless there is in Mauth- ner's thought a Kantian strand too. From Hume Mauthner has learnt the criticism of the notion of causality and from Kant its categorical inevitability. Mauthner interprets Kant in a psychologistic manner and causality as a category becomes for him an unavoidable feature of human thinking. "To explain means to search for causes. We cannot simultaneously aim at ex- planation and then suddenly renounce the concept of cause.""10 The general concept of causality "is the last of the old categories which we cannot, how- ever radically we think, eliminate from our understanding"." The relation between cause and effect is, according to Mauthner, the basic hypothesis of our whole Weltanschauung,12 a kind of linguistic prison in which we are held without a hope of release. Hume's custom and habit are turned by Mauthner into customs and habits which cannot be avoided as long as we think. It is obvious that there is a tension between the Humean and the Kantian aspects of Mauthner's thought about causality. Yet, on a purely theoretical level, some sort of co-existence could be achieved by maintaining that the categorical conception of causality is descriptive while the sceptical conception alone is truly philosophical, insofar as it both criticizes and understands the former. But it is a different matter when the philosopher, who holds the sceptical view, is engaged in a non-philosophical enterprise, such as writing 9 Mauthner, Beitraege zu einer Kritik der Sprache 3 vols.

It is this problem which lends Mauthner's work on the History of Atheism some philosophical importance. m There is a difference between actual historical writing and the philosophical account given of it. One of our problems concerning Mauthner is that his historical work seems to follow the general habits of contemporary histori- ography while his philosophical analysis of history represents, at the least, a radical minority view. I shall argue later that Mauthner is not being incon- sistent here. However, first we ought to consider the following question: what exactly is Mauthner affirming and what precisely is he denying when he claims that all history is Zufallsgeschichte? This leads us to the examination of the concepts of necessity, contingency and law-likeness. The key notion is that of Zufall. Mauthner prefaces his analysis of this concept with the history of its development and concludes that Zufall has two distinct meanings. On both accounts Zufall is a mere negative concept; it has meaning only when it is contrasted with its opposite. Mauthner's point is that philosophical writers before him, and especially the exponents of historicism, have confused these two opposites of Zufall. These are: necessity and law-likeness (Notwendigkeit and Gesetzmtissigkeit).13 If we regard Zufall as the opposite of necessity then we are dealing with a purely psychological concept, insofar as all modal concepts express nothing but our own feeling of greater or less certainty, based on the varying degrees of our knowledge. This notion of Zufall has grown out of earlier conceptions according to which it was contrasted first with the unintentional and later with the inessential. So, unintentional, inessential and not-necessary are one set of opposites of Zufall.14 On the other hand Zufall is contrasted with law- like. This notion comes near to one of the senses of universal. It is an indi- cation of the fact that occasionally we find regularities in reality and we express this by saying that we have found laws in the world.15 These laws are summaries of our experiences, which ultimately always go back to sense-experiences. Now the important difference between these two opposites of Zufall is that in the first case, when we speak in terms of modality, we are not describing reality but are expressing our own attitude. To speak of various degrees of probability is not to ascribe predicates to anything real but to indicate the degree of the strength of our own beliefs. It 13 Mauthner, Woerterbuch der Philosophie 3 vols.

Of course, we constantly use modal concepts, but this indicates' only our own point of view. We find necessity everywhere because we ourselves have put it there. As a consequence the same must be true of Zufall when it is taken in opposition to necessity. At one point Mauthner says "necessary, that is, accidental" (notwendig also zufaellig) to show that modal concepts cannot be part of a true description of reality. Necessity is a menschliche Betrachtungsweise. It is quite a different matter with the pair of opposites Zufall and univer- sality (or law-likeness). Here we operate with the strict notion of causality, according to which one type of event invariably causes another, specific type of event. This is the point of view adopted by natural science. Here, strictly speaking, there is no sense in talking about accidents at all.16 In nature, if we talk within the limits of natural science, there cannot be any accidents, for the simple reason that there are no instruments to notice them,17 which is again only the consequence of the fact that we have set up the rules of our scientific procedure in such a manner that we do not assign any meaning to Zufall in contrast to causality. Mauthner praises Spinoza for having been the only philosopher who dared to think the idea of causality to its logical conclusion, thus eliminating the possibility of accident. (Psychologically Mauthner explains our habitual inconsistency in maintaining causality and the possibility of accidents simultaneously, by our deep desire to believe in a free-will.)18 We are now in a better position to answer the question put at the beginning of this section. It will be recalled that Mauthner put the lesson learnt from Nietzsche in the form: there are no historical laws. Nietzsche's own rejection of historicism originated in Schopenhauer, who argues that history cannot be a science because its subject-matter is always the individual, while in science the subject-matter is always general.19 Saying that all history 16 Woerterbuch, III, 503. 17 Ibid., 507. 18 There is a point of considerable philosophical importance here, which is, however, only of marginal significance for the present discussion. The attempt to distinguish between necessity and strict universality goes back at least as far as Kant. His two criteria of a priori knowledge are a case in point. His definition of universality (" . . . a judgment is thought with strict universality, that is in such a manner that no exception is allowed as possible", Critique of Pure Reason B. 4.) fails to uphold the distinction, as the definiens itself is a modal concept. It is not possible that there should be exceptions, i.e., the non-occurence of exceptions is necessary. Mauthner's own view retains the ambiguities he took over from Mill's account of the nature of the universal affirmative proposition. On the one hand it serves as a summary of experiences, the universal assert- ing that some qualities are always accompanied by other qualities; on the other hand it serves as an indication of what to expect and also as a rule for the classification of new experiences. Mauthner exhibits in his account of universal propositions a weakness of all purely empiricist accounts of logic. For the logical distinctions which are nec- essary to resolve these difficulties see Stephen Toulmin, The Uses of Argument (Cam- bridge, 1958), Ch. III, esp. 114. 19 Woerterbuch, I, 605-12.</page><page sequence="6">62 GERSHON WEILER is Zufallsgeschichte amounts to a denial of the applicability of the strict notion of causality to historical matters. On the general grounds of the critique of language Mauthner argues, of course, that even the concepts of law and order are human products, more precisely, products of human language. However, the difference between these latter concepts and modal concepts lies in the nature of the claims made in using them. Mauthner's point is that while in talking about laws we make claims about reality, in using modal concepts we are actually talking about our attitude. The anthropomorphic character of all our concepts is here on the very surface. We can see now that the general position, according to which all history is Zufallsgeschichte, is perfectly consistent with the pursuit of historiography. While history is admittedly not a science, yet it can be scientific in the limited sense that the appropriate standards of scholarship (in checking of data, etc.) are observed. Mauthner does not admit, arguing against Rickert, that there are specific historical concepts 20 but he agrees that there is a specific craft of writing history. History is pursued by men and so historical writing will necessarily exhibit those characteristics which go with all human pursuits. Among these are the quest for connec- tions (Verkettung) between events, which sometimes will be expressed in causal terms.21 But it is important, for Mauthner, to emphasize that this is not the causal connection which obtains between events in nature. It is the more anthropomorphic, and the historically earlier, notion of cause, accord- ing to which an agent can cause something to happen by an intentional act.22 The study of history is one of the important human urges and the best thing about history is (and here Mauthner quotes Goethe), "the enthusiasm it arouses".23 Historical study thus becomes not an impersonal search for ob- jective laws but a deed, always pursued from the point of view of the present, and in the language of the present, which is, according to Mauthner, the only language we really understand.24 There is always a certain amount of jour- nalism in writing history.25 Our conclusion that the concept of Zufallsgeschichte is consistent with the pursuit of historiography which seeks to establish connections between various historical events can also be reached from another point of departure. Mauthner's other argument proceeds from a consideration of the nature of the historical datum. We have already had occasion to note that the raw material of history is itself enormously complex in detail and even the basic 20 Ibid., 615. 21 Ibid., 636. 22 Woerterbuch, II, 435. Cf. also R. G.

In this sense the notion of Zufallsgeschichte itself acquires a slightly altered meaning. While in our discussion so far this term was taken to refer to the non- scientific character of history alone, now the modal concept Zufall can itself be used, in a historical narrative, as an explanatory concept. In natural science it simply does not make sense to assert that an event occurred as a result of an accident; that is, in science an accident cannot be regarded as a cause,27 while in history this is sometimes the only course open to the his- torian. Zufallsgeschichte, in this sense, means indeed that history is a series of accidents, and from this it follows that the appropriate explanatory con- cepts in history are modal concepts. Of course when Mauthner argues that modal concepts are anthropomorphic, or (to use the term he prefers) homi- nistic, he does not imply that there are concepts which are not so. Indeed, the general result of the critique of language is that all concepts, including those of order and natural law, are fashioned by man after his own image, or more accurately according to his needs on the basis of the sense-experi- ences available to him through his Zufallssinn. The line which divides the concept of law from, say, the concept of necessity runs within the area of hoministic concepts, and the distinction made by it is one between different claims and not one between different degrees of objective (metaphysically guaranteed) truth. We cannot make scientific claims in history. And we can also understand now how weak a claim it is when Mauthner describes an event as a necessary consequence of another event.28 All he means is that given our present knowledge and psychological make-up, we cannot help regarding it as such. IV We turn now to a brief description of The History of Atheism. The first volume opens with an Introduction of some hundred and seventy pages, devoted entirely to classical Greece and Rome. Mauthner had a definite intention in thus separating discussion about religion and atheism in classical Greece and Rome from the main body of the work. The aim he set himself is to write a history of the denial of God; the God who is being discussed here remains always the God of Christian Europe, who, although He did not remain the same through the centuries, nevertheless would have to grow as pale as a shadow, if He were to be deprived of His activities and attributes.29 26 Ibid., 641 and 631. 27 Woerterbuch, III, 505. 28 E.g., GA, IH, 367. 29 GA, I, 16.</page><page sequence="8">64 GERSHON WEELER For this reason, classical antiquity does not belong properly to the story he has to tell. The religion of the ancient world was without dogmas30 and therefore: the overt struggle for liberation from the belief in God began, and could only begin, when this belief had become definitely expressed in words, like a law of the land, or as a so-called Dogma.31 Here we see the main point of contact between the history and the philosophy of Mauthner. The historical work should, in a way, show what he, on the grounds of the critique of language, always maintained, namely, that "God" is only a word which does not refer to anything real. Indeed, as he tells the story of atheism he frequently points out that a certain thinker has arrived at the sprachkritische Gedanke, that "God" is only a word.32 So we get a more precise formulation of Mauthner's task. The history of liberation from the belief in God is turned into the history of the word "God": If I must admit that this book is essentially a history of a word (eine Wort- geschichte), the negative word-history of the gradual devaluation of the word "God", then I must not ignore the language that these writers used; I mean, naturally, not the different national languages, but their vocabulary, strictly speaking their logic, independent of idiom.33 Attention to language is the main philosophical task, according to the prin- ciples of the Critique of Language. Mauthner held the view, probably derived from Vico and Wundt's Voelkerpsychologie, that the language of any group, at any given time, fully contains the Weltanschauung of that group. For example, he argues that neither Duns Scotus nor Ockham could go any further than he did,34 because of the limits of the Latin they both used. Thinking and speaking are, for Mauthner, identical, and so it is natural that he links progress in thinking about God and religion with the emergence of the vernacular as a medium of discussion.35 The vividness, the earthy imagery, of the vernacular offered possibilities which were precluded by the very nature of a pale ecclesiastic Latin. Mauthner's main target is the pseudo-science of theology, which professes to make true statements about God and the world. It is obvious that for Mauthner, the radical nominalist and empiricist sceptic, no such statements could possibly be known to be true. Yet the fact that he regarded language as identical with Weltanschauung was a good enough reason for his taking theology, which was a Weltanschauung or at least part of it, sufficiently seriously to merit criticism. "The concept God", he writes, "is not an ex, 30 Ibid., 65. 31 Ibid., 173 32 E.g., GA, III, 34. 33 GA, II, 376. 34 GA, I, 288. as Ibid.</page><page sequence="9">FRITZ MAUTHNER AS AN HISTORIAN 65 planation of the world, but only the inherited form or formula of an ex- planation".36 So the history of atheism becomes, to a very large extent, the history of the abandonment of the language of theology. This in turn involves Mauthner in writing the history of European Christian theology, at least from a negative point of view. Indeed, The History of Atheism contains this and much more. It includes a wealth of material concerning the various stages of development leading to the rejection of dogmatic religion. There are detailed discussions about various heretics, their views and their ultimate fate, about the Renaissance, the Reformation, witch-hunts, stages in the development of the doctrines of natural law, the encyclopedists and deists, about the famous Atheismusstreit in which Fichte was involved, and a great many other topics, some of which may seem to the reader not exactly part of a history of a single word. For example, the age of Bismarck, ostensibly because of the importance of the Kulturkampf, is allotted about fifty pages.37 Mauthner generally went to the original writings he discussed, although there is quite a lot of inevitable borrowing from secondary sources, when the original material was not avail- able. For example, he did a great deal of original research to discover the origins of the book De tribes Impostoribus, which had a long and varied career in Europe, issuing in the story of the three rings in Lessing's Nathan der Weise. He pays attention to the social conditions prevailing in the period he deals with, he draws a substantial proportion of his evidence from the legal codes which were in force, and he invariably emphasizes the influence of politics on the religious and theological issues. Even this cursory description of the contents of Mauthner's book is sufficient to show that there is a substantial lack of correspondence between Mauthner's declared aim and the finished work. It is not easy to believe that all the details recounted by him are necessary for developing the central idea, i.e., the growing language-consciousness which enables us to recognize "God" as a non-referring term. The impression is rather that, notwithstanding his declared intentions, The History of Atheism is a work in the grand tradi- tion of the Hegel-inspired nineteenth-century intellectual historiography, more akin, say, to Lecky's History of the Rise and Influence of Rationalism in Europe than to what one would normally call the history of a word. Mauthner knew Lecky's work, and frequently refers to him, sometimes registering agreement, at other times violent disagreement, on points of detail, but nowhere does he reject Lecky's enterprise on the ground of methodological principles.38 The Hegelian appearance of Mauthner's work is only strengthened if we consider that Mauthner did not avoid even the most 36 GA, IV, 156. 37 Ibid., 282 ff. 38 See J. J. Auchmuty, Lecky: A Biographical and Critical Essay (Dublin, 1945), esp. 52-53.</page><page sequence="10">66 GERSHON WEILER obvious pitfall of Hegelianism. This pitfall has been described by Nietzsche, in the book which so deeply influenced Mauthner, in the following way: Such a point of view has accustomed the Germans to talk of a "world-process", and to justify their own time as its necessary result... so that for Hegel the highest and final stage of the world-process came together in his own Berlin existence.89 Mauthner's own work concludes with a section under the title "Peace in Godless Mysticism".40 "Godless mysticism" is the position which Mauthner has reached as the ultimate consequence of a thorough critique of language.41 Concluding his historical work with a sketch of his own position Mauthner follows a procedure which is very Hegelian. It is as if he said, with Hegel, "so far has consciousness come". Were we to stop short at this point, we should conclude that Mauthner's historiographical enterprise is essentially Hegelian, inconsistent with his own declared aims and premisses, and there- fore an unqualified failure. However, before we reach such a conclusion, it might be worthwhile to have a further look at Mauthner's method of his- torical writing. V The Hegel-inspired attention to history, if we except the more extravagant forms of prophetic historicism, manifested itself in two fairly clearly distin- guishable ways. On the one hand emerged what could be called the strong Hegelian method, which resulted in the so-called Geistesgeschichte, and on the other hand, we have the history of ideas, which could be regarded as the weak offspring of the Hegelian influence. Before we inquire into Mauthner's place in this context, it will be useful to quote a well-known passage from Hegel himself: In our language the term History (Geschichte) unites the objective with the subjective side, and denotes quite as much the historia rerum gestarum, as the res gestae themselves; on the other hand it comprehends not less what has happened, than the narration of what has happened. This union of the two meanings we must regard as of a higher order than mere outward accident; we must suppose historical narrations to have appeared contemporaneously with historical deeds and events.42 This quotation contains, apart from the distinction between the two meanings of the term "history", a succinct statement of the strong version of the 39 Nietzsche, op. cit., 71. 40 GA, IV 372 ff. 41 See note 1, esp. 85-86. 42 G.

Sibree (London, 1905), 63.</page><page sequence="11">FRITZ MAUTHNER AS AN HISTORIAN 67 Hegelian conception of history. According to this, events themselves occur as historically meaningful only when the concepts which can be used to describe those events are already present. The concepts of the narrative are, therefore, real ingredients, indeed major determinants, of historical events. This is the line taken by those who pursue Geistesgeschichte. They see the whole of history as the expression of spirit, or, if they are dissatisfied with the unspecifiability of this spirit, regard a certain period of history as the expression of a specific idea. The idea serves as the unifying factor of the whole period, and is also a principle which causally explains why events occurred in the way they did. As an example of this kind of history one might mention Croce's History of Europe in the 19th Century, which traces the political developments of the nineteenth century under the major as- sumption that the dominating idea of the age was the growth of freedom. The result of such a way of looking at history is that Hegel's distinction between the events and the narrative of these events is blurred; the concepts of the narrative are conceived as real factors in the realm of historical events. If we turn now to the history of ideas, the differences which mark it off from Geistesgeschichte are obvious. The best statement of the purposes of the history of ideas is still the introduction to Lovejoy's The Great Chain of Being. There Lovejoy likens the history of ideas to analytic chemistry, which separates those ingredients of a larger idea which are connected by a certain conceptual affinity. It is essentially a search for what Lovejoy calls "unit- ideas". The job of the historian is to follow up the career of these unit-ideas as they appear in various conceptual compounds. If done on a large scale this approach leads to works like The Great Chain of Being or Professor Wolfson's works, which trace the dominant ideas of western philosophy to a single source. If done on a lesser scale, the history of ideas amounts to an inquiry into a concept in its historical setting, these concepts frequently being not in the least central and the thinkers discussed only very minor figures. In an inquiry of this kind techniques of what is called linguistic analysis may come in handy, insofar as the history of an idea may involve the his- torian in determining the changes in the meaning of the term which refers to the idea in question. In any case, no attempt is made to present this kind of inquiry as an overall explanation of history or a certain historical period. Mauthner does not fit easily into either of these groups. His notion that all history is Zufallsgeschichte is inconsistent with Hegelianism. Recalling Hegel's distinction between events and narratives, we might attempt to dif- ferentiate between Zufallsgeschichte and, to coin a word, Zufallshistorio- graphie. But this will not take us very far. A narrative with no connecting thread is a contradiction in terms. Indeed, the very idea that atheism has a history already commits us, to a certain extent, to saying that there are connections not only in the narrative but also in the events themselves. Consider now the following quotation from Mauthner:</page><page sequence="12">68 GERSHON WEILER Scientific history, insofar as such a thing is possible at all, could emerge only when people no longer saw in the falling off of every hair a finger of God, only when in every happening the natural connection between cause and effect was already presupposed.43 Can Mauthner, then, be regarded as a historian of ideas? The first point to note here is that according to Lovejoy'4 "God" is not a unit-idea, and so, presumably, the "denial of God" would not qualify either. Leaving out of consideration that there is some difficulty in deciding just what a "unit- idea" is, we can observe a remarkable similarity between Lovejoy and Mauthner, in their insistence that they intend to leave out everything which does not properly belong to the story. Mauthner recognizes only those thinkers as having made a contribution to enlightenment who also contri- buted to the defeat of Christian belief or the belief in God.45 While we may think that occasionally he interpreted his own rule of selection rather liberally (as in the case of Bismarck), nevertheless it would be a mistake not to take seriously his repeatedly stated intentions and his insistence that the liberation from the belief in God is his sole concern (der einzige Blickpunkt der Auf- merksamkeit) .46 Next we must consider how the notion of causality is actually employed by Mauthner in his historical writing. We have seen Mauthner's theoretical account of the concepts of causality, necessity and contingency. Now we are to see the notion of Zufallsgeschichte in use. Mauthner denies both necessity and reason in history. For example, he objects to the theory that the ancient world was so bereft of ideas that it was ready to receive Christianity. This theory amounts to putting into the historical development of a reason, a conscious intention, a philosophy of history, including the will of a wise God, of a providence, which has been denied by both ancient and contemporary free thought.47 On the contrary: Only an accident has destroyed the Roman Empire, has made the barbarians masters of the world; and only the barbarians have received enthusiastically the Christian hypothesis as an explanation of world and the world below (Unterwelt), and built it into a system of a new world-religion. The high culture of the period of Imperial Rome could get on very well almost without any religion.48 43 GA, I, 292. 44 A. 0.

Mauthner's answer, as it emerges from his method of writing, is faintly reminiscent of the second half of the quotation from Hegel. For Mauthner, the essential connection between ideas is provided by the language used. It is here that the importance of the identification of language with the total Weltanschauung really emerges: ... the inherent reason (innere Grund) is to be found in the dependence of every thinker on the language of the time, the common Christian language, and in this the common morals and science is included.50 This is an anti-Hegelian affirmation of the contemporaneity of deeds and concepts. The difference between Hegel and Mauthner is that whereas for Hegel there was something necessary in the concepts themselves and in their order of emergence, for Mauthner, language itself is a totally accidental crea- tion of active mankind. Language is illogical 51 and the emergence of certain concepts at a given time is also accidental.52 There is no more logical devel- opment in language than in the world. From this it follows that a certain method, or fashion, of historiography is itself accidental, depending on the general fashions of the age, and so ultimately on the linguistic habits of contemporaries. However, this is a self-defeating conclusion. If carried to its logical consequence it would mean that Mauthner would have to regard his own work as being dependent upon the linguistic habits of contemporary historians, and in his case they would be the practitioners of Geistesge- schichte, and therefore he would be unable to maintain that he is breaking new methodological ground. VI The purpose of this paper is primarily to analyse the assumptions which underlie Mauthner's historical writing. No major importance is attached in this context to the fact that Mauthner is not a great historian. In fact, the History of Atheism is in many ways an unsatisfactory work. The most ob- viously disturbing feature of the book is that it is a collection of essays on a 40 GA, IV, 111. 50 GA, Vorwort, p. v. 51 Beitraege, III, 20. 52 Beitraege, II, 669-70.</page><page sequence="14">70 GERSHON WEILER single theme, rather than a unified work of history. Mauthner seems to be picking out his material from a certain point of view; minor figures fre- quently get treatment which exceeds that given to thinkers of central im- portance. So far he resembles those historians of ideas who are more con- cerned with detail than with the large connections. One could say, from this point of view, that Mauthner stands half-way, in his manner of writing, between the strong Hegelian view and the most recent practice of the history of ideas. The History of Atheism could be regarded as a collection of in- stances selected from a certain point of view. On a more generous interpre- tation one might be tempted to say that the disconnectedness of the narrative is a faithful mirror of the disconnectedness of events. This interpretation may well be justified, as Mauthner nowhere explicitly claims that the idea of the denial of God has a continuous, logically ordered, history. He rather thinks that the idea grew in the way it did, as a result of the contingencies of the time, especially the contingencies of linguistic habits. Nevertheless, we must search for a principle of unification, as only on such a principle can the plan of writing a history of the rejection of the Christian God be intelligible. Here we are faced with the problem that on Mauthner's general sceptical position it is impossible to assert that there is a true principle of unification. It is one of the tenets of the critique of language that science, in the sense of a conceptual system which contains a true description of the world or part of it, is impossible. Science has only pragmatic value; it facilitates our manipulating things in the world. If this is the case with natural science which deals with the general, there is no wonder that history, which is always of the individual, cannot possibly claim to attain scientific truth. This is the conclusion our whole discussion has been leading up to, and it was already present in Schopenhauer and Nietzsche. How, then, can history be written at all? Again, we gain a clue from Nietzsche: To think objectively, in this sense, of history is the work of the dramatist: to think one thing with another, and weave the elements into a single whole; with the presumption that the unity of plan must be put into the objects if it be not already there. So man veils and subdues the past, and expresses his impulse to art - but not his impulse to truth and justice.53 To look at the matter in this way is to understand Mauthner's most- funda- mental view on historical writing. The things which were puzzling become clear all at once. We can now see that the Hegelian-looking structure of the History of Atheism, which ends with Mauthner's own views, is deceptive. The History is not meant as a true representation of the development of an idea, as an identifiable object of inquiry, where the word true has the force of objective scientific validity. Mauthner's History is rather a personal re- 53 Nietzsche, op. cit., 51-52.</page><page sequence="15">FRITZ MAUTHNER AS AN HISTORIAN 71 creation of the past, and his depicting it as leading up to himself is a proce- dure which is allowable on his own sceptical conception of science and its methodology. It also becomes understandable why Mauthner speaks throughout the whole work in the first person, a habit certainly unusual among writers of history in Germany. His selection of personalities, which seems sometimes arbitrary, can be justified if we understand that Mauthner was looking for those characters in history with whom he had a certain affinity, even if only in the sense that their respective views were connected with his by straight contradiction. Sympathies and antipathies, which manifest themselves so strongly in Mauthner's writing, may be unforgivable in a historian who claims to tell the objective truth, but Mauthner makes no such claim. His near hero- worshipping of Agrippa von Nettlesheim, Spinoza and Schopenhauer con- trasts sharply with the rough treatment meted out to Mendelssohn. Writing history, for Mauthner, is primarily a way of presenting his own critical point of view. In this way he makes good the claim that the critique of language and the rejection of God are one and the same enterprise. We ought to remember that Mauthner was a man with strong artistic impulses. He wrote novels and plays, and he remained to the last a frustrated poet. His recreation of his own intellectual antecedents in the form of a historical work is a perfect example, in a sense stronger than he intended, of Hume's view that the main vehicle of historical writing is imagination. One of the important results of the critique of language was the emphasis laid on the overriding importance of the concept of the point of view. Mauthner held that the point of view we adopt is decisive for the way we describe things, and moreover, that it is unavoidable that we adopt some point of view: . .. the concepts in our thinking shift according to "point of view", ... suddenly that which was previously hidden can come before one's eyes. We find, again, Mauthner dangerously near the adherents of Geistesge- schichte. They also claimed the necessity of a point of view, only they maintained that their point of view, or points of view, were universally valid. Their point of view was claimed to be true. Mauthner makes no such claim, nor could he on the basis of his own assumptions. However, the fundamental problem of Mauthner the historian remains unresolved. He argues simultaneously that all things and ideas - and this must include his own views - are contingent, and also that the sceptical results of the critique of language are, in a sense, true. But this is only the inevitable outcome of all scepticism which breaks the rule of silence. The Australian National University</page></plain_text>
