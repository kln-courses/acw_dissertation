<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE TARGUM AND THE SEPTUAGINT BY PINKHOS CHURGIN Yeshiva College, New York City The importance of the Targum for the investigation of the Septua- gint has been scarcely recognized by the student. There is, first, the fact that both versions were originated among Jews, which suggests some common meeting ground. Neither this fact nor the identical cir- cumstances which attended the history of these versions have attracted the deliberations of the student of the Septuagint. On the whole, they have been studied as two separate and quite unrelated subjects. No independent, comparative analysis has been attempted. Zecharias Frankel was the first to see that "ihre [the LXX] Version nihert sich ungemein der Ubersetzungsweise d. Onkelos,"' and was sure that "diese alte Version [Onkelos] ihnen zur Hand ging."2 He gave in his brilliant works on the Septuagint repeated utterance to this view, which he sufficiently substantiated by numerous examples of resem- blance between the two versions. Unfortunately his original plan to supplement his works on the Septuagint by a comprehensive treat- ment of the Targum was never realized. His contribution to the com- parative study of the Targum and the Septuagint did not advance be- yond the main point of his inquiry-to mark the influence of Palestine on the Alexandrian exegesis. Comparatively little has been attempted in this field of research since the days of Frankel. Biblical scholars are still holding firmly to the traditional view that the Targum is late and Midrashic and of no particular consequence to the knowledge of the history and text of the Septuagint. The statement of Geiger that On- kelos is a "schlechtgeratene aus jiungerer Zeit stammende Abkiirzung,"3 which has been since disproved by a host of scholars, is still potent with the biblical student. The truth is that notwithstanding the date of the final shaping of the Targum, its material is of early origin. The Targum is not an individual composition. It is the result of the prac- tice introduced apparently at an early time in Palestine to translate the pentateuchal reading in the service into Aramaic.

So that the Targum contains early as well as later renderings of the Hebrew text. On the other hand, as a Palestinian production framed in the home of authority, learning, and tradition, it could not have failed to impress a version similarly used in the service in the Diaspora. The Septuagint does not form a category by itself. With all the veneration conferred upon it by the Hellenistic Jews, the Septuagint could not have been immune to the influence of Palestine. The Sep- tuagint was used in the service in the same manner as the Targum was in Palestine. There should be no doubt as to that. Neither Frankel nor any of the present-day scholars were able to refute absolutely the evidence for its use or to advance convincing arguments against its assumption. The facts adduced by a comparison between it and the Targum render this assumption an irrefutable certainty. Whether the Septuagint took its place in the worship as a translation of the reading of the Hebrew original or was read in substitution of the Hebrew text, it was placed in the domain of the spiritual head. The religious au- thority of the community, charged with the task of instructing the people in the law and in its exact understanding and interpretation, would occasionally see fit to bring certain renderings in harmony with current interpretation. Palestine was not "in heaven." There were pilgrimages and visits made there by Jews from the Hellenistic lands as well. The visiting scholar would hear the Aramaic translation and would be impressed by the exegetical points suggested by the transla- tion of certain words or phrases. Coming back to his community, he would be led to change the Greek translation to accord with the one he heard in Palestine. That is how a contact between the Aramaic and the Greek version was effected. It was an inevitable contact. There is no other perfect explanation of the similarities between them. There are numerous quotations in the Talmudim to show the part the rabbis played in the framing of the renderings of the Targum. Something like it is certain to have taken place with regard to the Septuagint. Of course, the religious authority had in mind a particular word in a particular place and was not concerned so much for a consistent and uniform rendering. He would not go to lengths to bring about a per- fect revision of the rendering of the same word wherever it occurred. So that in certain cases the old rendering will be found to have sur-</page><page sequence="3">THE TARGUM AND THE SEPTUAGINT 43 vived the change and remained in one verse or more, as if for no other reason than to tax and baffle the ingenuity of the biblical student. The Targumim present a similar dilemma. There are, so to say, "stra- ta" in the Septuagint as in the Targum. The "strata" in the Septua- gint are of a very vexing nature. The scholar finds it difficult to ex- plain why a certain word is in a certain place (or book) in the Septua- gint translated by one Greek word and by another word somewhere else. He is forced to look for some general theory which, in the final analysis, will land upon the idea that a variety of translations signifies a variety of translators.4 I confess that there is an inherent weakness in any theory based upon the fact of variation of rendering, since it tends to ignore the fact and the importance of the agreement existing between the parts or the books which comes glaringly to the fore through the mazes of variation. One, again, wonders why a different translator was so discourteous toward the translation of his pred- ecessor in cases where the different translation differs little from the other one and where there is no obvious motive for the change. Fur- thermore, this theory scarcely explains the variation of renderings which exists in the segment assigned to a single author. Frankel' ar- rived at the conclusion that the Septuagint was not fixed (a theory which explains the variations but does not explain the agreement in rendering as well as in points of method), a similar theory to that which was enunciated by Luzzato6 concerning the Targum Onkelos. By placing the responsibility for the changes upon the synagogue, a sound and apparently true explanation for the existence of different renderings and repetitions is gained. There were different words (in Greek) in different localities. One current rendering might have gained favor which, in the long run, succeeded in supplanting the rendering current in another locality. The processes of such a collective revision are somewhat compli- cated and admittedly confusing. It is hardly possible (and neither is it of importance) to trace them and demonstrate perfectly their work- ings. One thing is certain: These variations preclude the possibility of an individual revision. Aquila's version is on the whole uniform and Theodotion's revised edition of the Septuagint displays consist- ency in tendency and method. Whatever the original authorship of 4Cf.

It would require a long time for a change, so introduced into the text, to be uniformly effected. On the well-founded assumption that the Targum had influenced the history of the Septuagint, this very important point can be.dem- onstrated by a comparison between the two versions. Since such a comparison, in certain instances, calls for an examination into certain points otherwise overlooked by the student, it, the comparison, af- fords us, in addition, interesting observations on the relation between the different books of the Septuagint. The following examples, I hope, will be found to be typical illustrations of these facts. Two renderings are used in the Septuagint for the word rj=77, namely, OvrLarrjpLtov and pcoj~6. The latter is used when an idolatrous altar is meant. For instance, Exod. 34:13, M . 2 :T r :, the idolatrous altars being meant, the rendering is rovs /wpobs; simi- larly, Deut. 7:5, 1::t r M'M27t , and Deut. 12:3. And because the authors considered the altars put up by Balak at the instance of Balaam to have been idolatrous (with which view Ps. Jonathan agrees), they rendered T3 2 in the story of Balaam (Num. 23:1, 2, 4, 14, 29, 30) by O3wibs. This purely Greek word is throughout the Septuagint the rendering of the idolatrous int , with one exception. This is Num. 3:10, where it stands for the altar in the Tabernacle. But the particular portion of the verse where this word occurs is an addition. Its equivalent is missing in the Hebrew text. The fact that fwtt6s is nowhere in the Greek Bible applied to the holy (proper) altar is sufficient reason for regarding the whole section as spurious, a mar- ginal gloss. A Hellenistic Jew in his biblical discourses or notes would have no hesitation in using 3Ow~~s to designate the altar in the Temple. Both Philo and Josephus in their discourses on the Bible or otherwise made general and indiscriminate use of this word. The rendering of IMT'. in the holy sense in the Pentateuch is OvLtaor~pltov. In one case this rendering involves an important exeget- ical note. What sort of altar was the one which Aaron erected for the golden calf; was it an idolatrous altar or not? The answer is given by the rendering in the Septuagint of i Tm in the respective verse</page><page sequence="5">THE TARGUM AND THE SEPTUAGINT 45 (Exod. 32:5) by Ovcrtao-riptov. Aaron, then, erected the altar to God, not to the calf. Onkelos and Ps. Jonathan translated it in the same sense. The motive was to remove from Aaron the guilt of commit- ting the impious act of erecting an idolatrous altar. The Talmudists display a similar desire in their explanations of the acts of Aaron. On the whole, however, this duality of rendering is based on a defi- nite principle. The translator will not render the word when it carries a profane significance by the same word which he employs in rendering it when it carries a sacred significance. The Hebrew text may have the same word in both the profane and the sacred meaning. But the translator would rather have two different words to make this dis- tinction clear, notwithstanding the requirement of being close to the text. The Targum follows a similar course. In this particular instance of i;="D, Onkelos, Ps. Jonathan, and Jonathan render it by r3'I when it stands for the altar of God and by X1R" when it is applied to the idolatrous altar. Neither the Syriac nor Aquila and Symma- chus draw such a distinction in the rendering of this word. This is a very significant agreement between the Septuagint and the Targum, and it becomes striking when the use of these two words for TD in the Septuagint is examined. The word OvoLaa77'pLov appears to be of purely Jewish origination. It is not found in the classic Greek. It never came into general use in Alexandria. But since this word has nothing sacred about it and since the Jewish translator had no scruple in using the Greek word OvoGra for i:p, though it meant to the Greek the sacrificial offerings to his gods, we must assume that the purpose of coining a new word for altar in the Bible was a linguistic one. The translator was desirous to give an exact Greek reproduction of the Hebrew word MrT%-7 , which means the place of sacrifice. Assuming this to have been the object of the translator in the framing of a new word for altar, we should suppose that the translator used this word for all instances where T2 oc- curred. In other words, there were originally no two renderings of this word. This supposition has the support of the fact that the dual ren- dering of T'., in profane and holy sense is followed in Joshua only (22:10, 16, 19, 23, 26), the Greek translator treating the altar erected by the tribe of Reuben as an idolatrous one. But in 22:19,.... ,M,,' j'"7 '" " imtrM P .b 00W "2, the former is rendered</page><page sequence="6">46 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES by 3wOcs; the latter, by vovLaor'pLov. This distinction is absent in all the other books of the "Former Prophets," where 0. is the rendering alike of the godly and the idolatrous altar (see Judg. 6:25, 28, 30, 31, 32; I Kings 13:1, 2, 3, 4, 32; II Kings 16:10; 21:3; 23:15, 16, 17). The same is true of the "Later Prophets," with a few exceptions, and the Hagiographa. The conclusion from this observation must be that orig- inally the same course was followed also in the Pentateuch and Joshua. Otherwise it would be difficult to explain why the later translators of the Prophets and the Hagiographa refused to adopt the system of the rendering of this word so persistently carried out in the Pentateuch, and involving, as it does, religious sentiments. So that 0. as the rendering of the idolatrous .t came in later, supplanting 0. as a result of contact with the Aramaic, Palestinian rendering. The change was thoroughly carried out in the Pentateuch and Joshua, and it began to make its way in Isaiah and Jeremiah and II Chronicles (Isa. 17:8; 27:9; Jer. 30[49]:2; II Chron. 31:1). In a few instances wcw6is strangely became the rendering of T-. These cases are Isa. 15:2; 16:12; Jer. 7:31; 31[48]:35; 39[32]:35. In all the other books of the Bible the old rendering, 0., remained un- touched. The rendering of the profane or idolatrous ri~M in Ezek. 6:4, 5, 6; Hos. 8:11; 10:1; Amos 2:8; 3:14, is Ovaoaaor'pLov. This is also true of II Chron. 33:15; 34:4, 5. The reason why the other books of the Bible were left out of ac- count is hard to explain. It was the result of the slow and irregular movement of the collective revision. On the other hand, it would ap- pear that this revision was not yet made when the grandson of Sirach translated Ecclesiasticus into Greek. He used wpt6s for the altar of the Temple (50:12, 14). He would not have done so if by his time this word had become the rendering of the idolatrous i5.T in the Greek Pentateuch. However, at the time of the epitomator of II Maccabees and the translator of I Maccabees, this revision seems to have taken full shape. They follow the distinction in the rendering of rTD (or in denoting it) in a most conspicuous manner. They employ Owpbs for the idolatrous altar (eight times in I Maccabees and twice in II Mac- cabees) and 0. for the altar of the Temple. Notice how these words are used by way of contrast in I Macc. 1:59. Somewhat like this contrasting use of these words is found in II</page><page sequence="7">THE TARGUM AND THE SEPTUAGINT 47 Macc. 10:2, 3. The contrast in these instances, which was noticed by Kennedy,7 gives striking emphasis to the significance these words have acquired by that time. It should also be added that 0. in these and other apocryphal books (I Macc. 4:30, 44, 47, 49, 50, 53, 56, 59; 7:36; II Macc. 1:18; 2:5; 3:15; 6:5; 10:26; 14:3, 33; 15:3; Testament of Levi 16:1; I Bar. 1:10; Ps. Sol. 2:2; 8:13) is exclusively applied to the godly altar. Consequently the introduction of Aluq6s in the Greek Pen- tateuch as the rendering of the heathen e2 must have occurred in the interval between the translation of Ecclesiasticus and that of I Maccabees (or the composition of II Maccabees). At least in this case we are in a position to point out also the approximate date of the change in the text. Of equal interest and significance is the rendering of *" in the Sep- tuagint. There are three words for it. Two of them have an identical but distinct position. The rendering of this word where it occurs in connection with privileges conferred on the stranger or with an ob- servance which he is to share is rpoaikXvros. So, for example, Exod. 12:48, 49 and Num. 9:14, where the regulation of the observance of the Passover by the stranger is laid down; Exod. 20:10 and Deut. 5:14, where the stranger is commanded to partake in the rest of the Sabbath; Lev. 16:29, where the stranger is to observe the Day of Atonement; Deut. 16:14, giving the stranger a place in the celebra- tion of the holidays; or where the equality of stranger with the native before the law is decreed (Lev. 24:22; Num. 15:15, 16, 29); Num. 19:10, where the stranger is commanded to observe the law of purity; also in the numerous exhortations to be just to the stranger and treat him generously (Exod. 22:20; Num. 35:15; Deut. 10:18, 19). The word having an identical significance is yEtc'pas, which, however, oc- curs only once in the Pentateuch (Exod. 12:19) and once in the other books of the Bible (Isa. 14:1). The third word is irapoLKos. This word is used either when the fact of one being a stranger is expressed or, otherwise, when the implication is of exclusion from the fold of the law. Examples of the first kind are Gen. 15:13, where the prophecy is told to Abraham that his children will be strangers in Egypt, and Gen. 23:4, where Abraham pleaded the fact that he was a stranger; so Moses (Exod. 2:22). An example of the 7 In Hastings, Dictionary.</page><page sequence="8">48 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES latter is Deut. 14:21, excepting the stranger from the ordinance of forbidden meat. This visibly clear distinction in the application of these words was recognized by Frankel.s Allen9 made an elaborate study of all the instances in question to prove the discriminate meaning of the terms used in the rendering of ". He admittedly left unanswered some disturbing points which came into the keen scrutiny of Schiirer, who rejected his conclusions.'0 He accepted the view of Geiger"1 that both terms have the same significance, notwithstanding the fact that at a later time -rpoXv?ros was the word used to describe a convert to Judaism. But Geiger seems to have overworked the arguments on which he based his view. He asked: If irpou. meant to the Greek trans- lator one who embraced Judaism, how would he render Exod. 22:20; 23:9; Lev. 19:34; Deut. 10:19 by rpooaXvros, the reference being to the Israelites? There is, however, nothing strange in this. As was pointed out by Allen, the translator may have been moved to do so in order to keep intact the play of the expression in these instances ("And a stranger shalt thou not wrong .... for ye were strangers"). To use one word in one part and another in the other part of the verse would lessen the effect of the emphasis. That this is not a mere conjecture is shown by the fact that Ps. Jonathan also in one case (Deut. 10:19) renders .... .1. by 1'3 ,12 which he applied in the preceding part of the verse, although all agree as to the meaning of this word. This might have been the earlier rendering in the Targum. Philo pre- sents an appropriate example. Speaking of the name Gershom given by Moses to his son, he says that he called him so because, as he said, "I was a ^yeu&amp;pas in a foreign land." Here Philo used this word ap- parently for no other reason (for his text of the Septuaginta read 7ra'pot- KOS in this verse as Ryle"3 justly pointed out, and which is confirmed by Testament of Levi 11:2) than to retain the play of the two words. This, by the way, will also serve to cover another point made by Geiger that ^yE-&amp;pas was the term adopted by the Septuagint for a proselyte. 8 Cber d.

See Exod. 2:22.</page><page sequence="9">THE TARGUM AND THE SEPTUAGINT 49 Philo, then, did not consider it extraordinary to use this Aramaic des- ignation for a convert to Judaism when good taste and the text dic- tated it. (The Syriac translator of the Septuagint also uses li, in Exod. 22:20.) The fact, however, is that while both these Greek and Aramaic terms described a heathen who brought himself nearer to Judaism, it was also used freely for a stranger, even a Jew. It should be also observed that Deut. 23:8 is rendered in the Sep- tuagint by 7rapoLKos. Why? Because in this particular verse the word 13; is not repeated, so that the necessity of preserving the linguistical emphasis of the text was absent here. The Greek rendering here is another argument for the reason assigned above to the rendering in the Septuagint of 'I in the identical phrases of Exod. 22:20; 23:9; Lev. 19:34; Deut. 10:19. Geiger also sought support for his conten- tion from the Greek rendering of Deut. 23:8. The reference there is evidently to Israelites, yet the word used there is rpoo-. There is an answer to this contention. First, in this particular verse VtM'=1 fol- lows t:0'1; and since 7rdpoLKos is the rendering of 2~ n in the Sep- tuagint, to use -rap. also for t'") would involve a bare repetition of the same word with the consequent annoying effect to the reader and the hearer. The same problem faced the Greek translator of Ps. 39:13 .... " '1~ " . He used rap. and rape.rib'L~los for 2V1, which is used only once in the Pentateuch (Gen. 23:4). There may also be concealed a fine point of interpretation in this rendering. We are just like the convert, strange and eager, with God. It seems that this was the sense in the Targum to Ps. 39:13. This rendering of an identical phrase by the Targum shows that there is nothing strange in the Greek rendering of Deut. 23:8. The fact again that Aquila, be- cause of his regard for literalness, makes no distinction and employs rpos. for )J' in all respective cases, although all agree that by his time this word generally meant a convert, brings into relief the distinc- tion in the rendering of this word in the Septuagint. At the same time it serves to show that rpos., notwithstanding its specific meaning, was applied freely even to an Israelite. But what Geiger and those sup- porting his view particularly overlooked is the fact that Irpoo-'Xvros is apparently of Jewish origin. It was specifically formed for a certain objective the translators had in mind. Of course, it was not necessary for them to create a new word for "stranger," plain and simple, when</page><page sequence="10">50 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES they could readily find one in a long list of Greek classic words. They wanted, then, a word describing a certain type of stranger, one of foreign birth who embraced Jewish practices. The words denoting "stranger" current in Greek speech and literature would not be made to give up their time-honored meaning to make room for this new sig- nificance. The translators had no other choice than to coin a new word to convey this idea. This idea necessarily follows this word wherever it is found, except in the cases cited above. The distinction, then, in the rendering of "5 in the Septuagint is actually an intended and a basic distinction. According to the render- ing of the Septuagint, the stranger who is to share in certain observ- ances with the Israelite and to enjoy the privileges is one who em- braces Judaism, wholly or partially; this stranger is not allowed to eat prohibited meat-in all of which the Septuagint is in striking harmony with the Targum. The latter uses W1"'3 wherever the Septuagint has 7rpoo., with the exception of the cases discussed above and Lev. 25:35, 47 and Deut. 28:43, where a purely exegetical difference is involved. The Targum uses 1'1, "resident," where the Septuagint has 7rd'poLKos. However, the Targum is more specific in Deut. 14:21. This is a striking agreement and certainly not an accidental one. The dual rendering seems to be of early date. It has been adopted by the translators of the other books of the Bible. There the distinction follows along the lines set in the Septuagint. Compare Josh. 8:33, 35; 20:9; Jer. 7:6; 22:3; Ezek. 14:7; 22:7, 29; 47:23; Zech. 7:10; Mal. 3:5; Ps. 146:9; I Chron. 22:2, as against II Sam. 1:13; Jer. 14:8; Ps. 39:13; 119:19; I Chron. 29:15. The Targum in each case, with few exceptions, follows the Targum to the Pentateuch. But at a later time an attempt seems to have been made to replace 7rpoo. by the Aramaic word "w'jpas. Hence the origin and explanation of its presence in the Septuagint. It made no headway for the reason of its late appearance. The Syriac presents a helpful and instructive illustration of the stages in the rendering of this word. This version seems to have waited long with the solution of the problem of finding the proper word for ", occasioned, it would seem, by the quite un- dignified meaning of the word "'T in Syriac. 8 -, therefore, was originally used throughout the text. Then appears the phrase P1-</page><page sequence="11">THE TARGUM AND THE SEPTUAGINT 51 ,,- FsR? for "') in the peculiar sense, which in essence is a re- production of 7rpoo-iwUos. The progress of the revision there was ir- regular. It failed to gain a foothold in Exodus. It completely mas- tered Leviticus (cf. Lev. 19:33). The same passage in Exod. 12:48 is rendered by -.?. The same is true of Numbers. It succeeded only partially to penetrate Deuteronomy (in only two passages: 10: 18, 19). The same irregularity is found in the Prophets. This phrase is used (and the distinction in the rendering made) in Ezekiel and Malachi. This phrase is not used (and consequently the distinction in rendering not marked) in Joshua, Isaiah, Jeremiah, and Zechariah. But in Chronicles the Aramaic, Targumic X'1; makes its appear- ance (I Chron. 22:2; II Chron. 30:25), which is also employed in the Syriac New Testament (and in the Syriac version of the Septuagint). We are able thus to trace two revisions in the rendering of "3 in the Syriac, the last of which was the Targumic X11'3, which, however, did not advance beyond the limited area of Chronicles. The appear- ance of y,'pas in the Septuagint equally represents a last-minute act of revision. There are several words in the Septuagint for p* . In some in- stances, however, there is a marked consistency. Some cases are strik- ing exceptions. Mph, as a rule, is rendered in the Septuagint by v6~'- Aos (Exod. 12:14, 17; 27:21; 28:43; Lev. 3:17; 7:36; 16:29, 31; 23:14, 21, 31; Num. 10:8; 18:23; 19:10, 21). This consistency is broken in the rendering of 1pr1 in the passages dealing with the paschal lamb, where it (Exod. 12:43; Num. 9:12) is VbPos. To understand the sig- nificance of this deviation we have to turn to the Targum. There also we find a similar deviation. The Targumic rendering of prh, 'pI (in the holy sense) is R3p. But in the instances cited here the Targum (both Onkelos and Ps. Jonathan) uses '711;, which it always ap- plies to describe a law in the sense of regulation or custom. By this rendering the Targum (and the Septuagint as well) wished to state that the ordinance of the paschal lamb is a decree, to be regarded as independent of a specific reason, and only as the express will of God. There is reason to assume that the rendering of Mpn in these passages in the Targum and the Septuagint is the product of a revision. Some irregularity is visible also in this revision. In the Septuagint this spe-</page><page sequence="12">52 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES cific rendering spread to other instances of ij)r0 which refer to the paschal lamb (Exod. 13:10; Num. 9:14, which has influenced 15:15). It evaded, however, others (Exod. 12:14, 17). In all of these cases the Targum uses the regular rendering of i33p with the exception of Num. 9:3 (the reference being to the paschal lamb), which the Targum renders by #r753 (Ps. Jonathan, however, disagrees, and renders it by '1 "p). The Septuagint renders it by vb6tos, agreeing with Onkelos. But Ps. Jonathan preserved presumably the older ren- dering. The Syriac follows suit. The rendering there of ,pi is the Greek WLa with the exception of Lev. 3:17; 7:36; 10:9, where the Tar- gumic is employed. However, Num. 9:12, 14 are rendered by WJ. . It was done for the same good reason. Here also we are deal- ing with a revision, for, as with the rendering of 75, this is not the rendering in Exod. 12:43. In the combination =VX-/ ri) (only twice in the Bible: Num. 27: 11; 35:29) the Septuagint renders the term by &amp;Kat'wi a. The Targum has here, as in the cases cited above, N'"T5 . Why the Greek refused to use here vo6'os is a question the answer to which is open to speculation but which does not detract from the striking peculiarity of the use of this word in these two particular verses. On the other hand, r1'p' Miri' (Num. 19:2) is rendered by ' Sa 7roX), nowhere else used in the Septuagint for pi or Mprl. The same in 31:21 is rendered by StKatoiwa. In both these instances the Targum has '1TS;. In both these verses the Syriac has Pr.o s. All agree, and we should regard the Targum as the link uniting them. Here is another interesting agreement between the versions. The Septuagint renders p1 when it signifies heathen law by vYbMLos; never by any other appropriate word.

The translator was evi- dently actuated by a religious sentiment in his reluctance to follow the Hebrew text and use one word to describe both the heathen and the sacred law. This rule the translator follows in rendering verse 30, and also Lev. 20:23. The Targum follows a similar course. The Greek word RCII. is employed in the Targum to render prr in the profane sense. The Syriac is also marking the difference in the rendering of p? in these passages. But the Targum is the source of this particular principle of translation. The following is another illuminating example: the anthropomor- phic expression 'D 5V in Exod. 20:3 is rendered in the Septuagint freely, r7rXyv 4 o^. This is exactly the expression used in the Tar- gum 'i2 n, which was also adopted by the Syriac. This, however, is not the case with the parallel passage in Deut. 5:7. The Septuagint there departs from Targum and Syriac and renders " literally, 7rp 7rpoo-67rov jov. Here is a divergence, and a very important one, since it concerns the principle of eliminating an anthropomorphism. So important was this divergence regarded by Frankel that he ad- vanced the theory that the translator of Deuteronomy never "saw" the translation of Exodus and consequently had no knowledge of the phrase used there to translate these words.'4 On closer study this theory will be found to be entirely erroneous. Omitting all other considerations, it will be sufficient to compare the translation of the Decalogue in Exodus with the one in Deuteronomy to be convinced that the translators of these books were quite familiar with each other's work. But are we to conclude from the literal trans- lation of this anthropomorphic phrase that the translator of Deuterono- my was unconcerned over anthropomorphic expressions; or that he held this particular word, CM, as being unoffensive to the spiritual- ity of God? The evidence points in both respects to an opposite atti- tude. Frankel himself pointed out that the Greek translator of Deu- teronomy displays considerable zeal to explain away anthropomorphic utterances. The following quotations show that he made no exception of =t1D. He refused to render it literally. Deut. 16:16, .1 W nPE "'. T  R '9 e]' 2  14 Uber d.

The rendering of '" I"M M in the other part of the verse is similar, as is also the rendering of Deut. 31:11. It will be noticed that the rendering of this verse here corresponds fully with the rendering of Exod. 23:15, 17; 34:23. Let us also state that in this rendering the Septuagint agrees completely with the Targum. But the Greek translator of Deuteronomy is not consistent in this treat- ment of =3j. He reverses his stand in other cases where he follows a literal rendering. So, for instance, Deut. 5:4, '"~1 ="l"72 0"M, he renders literally by rpbawirov Karda rpbawirov; also 34:10. The latter, however, is rendered by Onkelos in the same way, literally, r"M I"RE , and only the Fragment retained the current rendering of this phrase in the Targum, namely, ,~7i .. . . b 1: . The Greek ren- dering of the similar phrase in Exodus (33:11), 'M= ?b '" "Z1 VM 5E C'"5M is vcjros vwn?ri, is nearly literal. So that the render- ing of D Y; in Deuteronomy is not a single, remarkable case. It is in company with similar cases and in contrast to others which are treated otherwise and rendered figuratively. The cases in question suggest no tendency or definite regulation on the part of the translator. They merely bring to view an irregularity in the translation of this anthropomorphic phrase. This irregularity is not confined to Deuter- onomy. It is noticeable in all other books of the Pentateuch. The translation of =3- wavers between a figurative and a literal inter- pretation. Gen. 6:11 is rendered &amp;avrtiov. In the same way are ren- dered 10:9; 18:22; 19:13, 27; 27:7. But MCN 1".1= (4:14) is rendered literally as well as verse 16. So is rendered =ebtR '"'Nr =jD3 N t'": (32:31) also, where the Targum interposes W~tHNi, the Syriac following the Targum. The same is true of Exodus, where there is visibly insistence on the evasions of anthropomorphisms.

'" 1:3 (Num. 17:11, 24) is rendered the same</page><page sequence="15">THE TARGUM AND THE SEPTUAGINT 55 way, literally; so is 32:21 also rendered. In all these instances the Targum alone is consistently adhering to the figurative translation which, in the rest of the cases, is followed by the Greek translator. What happened to the rendering of this word in the Septuagint was a revision of the older, literal rendering to conform to the one of the Targum. This revision failed to embrace all cases in question and all classes. The literal rendering of ":M 5 in Deut. 5:7 represents just one of those cases which escaped the revision. Such must also be the explanation of the variation in the rendering of ')D . While in Gen. 4:16 and in Num. 17:11, 24 it is rendered literally, it is rendered freely in Leviticus (9:24; 10:2). On the other hand, it is evident that in some cases the revision lagged, owing to the lack of a fit- ting term that would not annihilate the precise meaning of the text. The Targumist seems to have experienced some trouble in these cases. He used in some cases RT'ill for ='1; in one case he inserted it13 ; in others he used RPrE and *-.Ai according to the sense of the context. It will be found that all cases in which these figurative words are employed in the Targum are rendered literally in the Sep- tuagint. The Greek translator might have been averse to such a radi- cal departure from the text, and as for Z0Z': or '-.- , he simply missed their equivalent in Greek. Or these figurative words may have been the result of a later revision of the rendering of this word in the Targum. Before that revision was made the rendering in the Targum in these cases was also a literal one. Evidences to this effect are pres- ent at least with respect to Mnir) . The Syriac, which follows closely the Targum in the rendering of this word and adopted R'N 72 in the rendering of =:S in Gen. 32:31 and T7'11 in Lev. 17:10; 20:3, 5, 6; 26:17, fails to make use of R1%': and consequently em- ploys a literal rendering. This would suggest that the Syriac trans- lator knew of no such rendering in the Targum. The Targum itself preserved relics of the old, literal rendering where otherwise Xr)Vi is used.

Jonathan by '1r1 ~I .15 The last in order is Deut. 34:10, t ?x trn, which is rendered literally in Onkelos. All these cases and also those where N;: or 5*51 are employed in the Targum are rendered literally in both the Syriac and the Septuagint. The only exceptions are Exod. 33:14, 15, which both the Septuagint and the Syriac refuse to render literally although the Targum employs Mr)=T for the simple reason that a literal rendering would make bad sense. There is much in the disagreement in these cases between the Sep- tuagint and the Targum to indicate the dependence of the former on the latter. The rendering of 'D ?; in Exod. 20:3 is simply Targum in Greek. The influence of the Targum is clearly apparent in the rest of the cases. This instance is particularly interesting because it shows that, while the Jewish philosopher in Alexandria may have felt the necessity of giving a figurative meaning to the anthropomorphisms in the Pentateuch without having been spurred on to it by Palestine, the formulation of this necessity into a regulation of translation came there as the result of contact with the Targum and in the shape of a revision. The Greek translation was, it seems, unmindful of it when Prophets and Hagiographa were translated, where, as a rule, the anthropomorphic word is treated like an ordinary word and rendered literally. Of course, ME forms no exception. Compare particularly the rendering of the phrase '" ' . . . . r (I Kings 13:6; II Kings 13:4; Jer. 26:19; Zech. 8:21, 22; Mal. 1:9). Unlike Exod. 32: 11, where the Septuagint follows the Targum, this phrase there is rendered literally. It means that at the time when the Prophets were translated into Greek, the revision in the Pentateuch was not yet made. The translation of ' in Genesis is considered by Baumgartel16 as important. The rendering a' rotL5padKEL, does not appear in any other book besides Genesis. The Targum, I trust, may help throw light on this peculiar fact. It (the Targum) will be found to have used two words to render 7T1. In all cases it employs the exact Aramaic equivalent, p"I ', except where this word refers to Jacob or the people 15 Ginsburger's edition has this rendering only in 32:20. 16 Op. cit., p. 56.</page><page sequence="17">THE TARGUM AND THE SEPTUAGINT 57 of Israel. The Aramaic word there is ?TX. This change has to do with a principle employed by the Targumist (and whose birth was in the sentiment of the people in Palestine) to evade any disrespect to the fathers. So bTX is the rendering of M'l= in Gen. 27:43; 31:20, 21, 22, 27. The same distinction was maintained by Jonathan rendering Mrj . qbJ.M (Amos 7:12, cf. Hos. 12:13) by ?TX. The Septua- gint, it would seem, was following the Targum. What happened, how- ever, in the Septuagint was an irregularity, owing to the fact that the rendering was the result of a revision. That revision was confined to Genesis. Then, by frequency and by tendency to conformity, the new rendering overstepped the limits of its use and became the rendering of r'11 wherever it occurs. The same irregularity is seen in the Tar- gum, although to a lesser degree. Thus Num. 24:11, the reference be- ing to Balaam, is rendered by 'WT, while Exod. 2:15 is rendered by p7; . There also the irregularity was due to the fact that ?TN was a more recent rendering supplanting the older one, ~. Ps. Jonathan preserved the older rendering in Gen. 27:43 (where it has both render- ings put together), Exod. 14:5, and Num. 24:11. The Syriac presents a similar picture. It follows the Targum in the rendering of ( 2 (and employs the same word) but only partially. He uses ~i1 in Gen. 27: 43; 31:20 (but not in vss. 21, 22, 27); Exod. 14:5; and Num. 24:11. Related to the foregoing rendering is the rendering of :p I 23'1 (Gen. 31:20). Onkelos, out of reverence to Father Jacob, renders z071 figuratively, '~1. This is actually the rendering in the Septuagint-'EKpvev. However, a part of the rendering of verse 26 is literal. In this case also we are dealing with a change of the render- ing which did not advance to cover all related cases. The rendering in Onkelos is also the outcome of a change. Ps. Jonathan preserved the older rendering, which was a literal one. At a later time, it would appear, a change to the same effect was also made in the rendering of 23~, where the reference is to Rachel (31:19, 32) and 3*h, "take," was substituted for the older, literal rendering which was preserved in Ps. Jonathan. We were dealing until now with cases that involve principles. The following examples are of an exegetical order, but none the less in- teresting.

This is an exact reproduction of the rendering in the Targum: "2ZIM 1' p n "'N. However, this translation is not adhered to in Numbers. In one case there (Num. 1:49) aptOAtYv is em- ployed. In all other cases (Num. 1:2; 4:2, 22; 26:2; 31:26, 49) the rendering is literal: XdrPe b6 KEr&lt;;dXato' (Num. 4:2; 31:26, 49) or .... apxt)Y (Num. 4:22; 26:2). Onkelos (and the Syriac, which adopted the rendering of the Targum) follows the same exegetical rendering. To explain this variety of rendering in the Septuagint we have to turn again to the theory of revision. No other plausible explanation will sufficiently explain it. It means simply that the changed rendering (the one in Exodus) made little headway. On the other hand, Num. 1:49 represents another variety of the one in Exodus which had also its origin in the Targum. Ps. Jonathan preserved this variant in 26:2 and 31:49, which corresponds to apitOWPt, namely, =eC n '. The Fragment in Exodus, by the striking method of adding the new to the old rendering, had preserved all the respective renderings: 2p: "nb :1=iC " = n~2  ~' ? , containing the literal (V') and the other two, more recent, renderings (r, ).1 The translation of W17: in Septuagint and Targum constitutes a very interesting agreement between these versions which was also noticed by Frankel.1s The rendering of this word is in harmony with the evident meaning of the text, viz., "fear" (Gen. 9:2; Deut. 11:25). However, Deut. 4:34, H5i iN'I l~, is rendered uniquely in the Septuagint, 6ppa'/_,t p.ey., agreeing with the one in the Targum, 2" 0 "0 :3137 . This does not necessarily mean that the versions had a different reading, namely, ~'N _-. It is in essence an exegetical venture which must have had good authority for it. Yet, it seemingly was not the original rendering in the Septuagint. For while Deut. 26:8 is rendered by 6pa'AncY, Deut. 34:12 is translated by Oavoata. This rendering seems to be the older which succeeded in eluding the change. That the same is true of the Targum is shown by Ps. Jonathan, where the rendering of N"17 in this latter case is ?71. However, Onkelos and the Syriac use the exegetical rendering 17 This passage is missing in Ginsburger's edition, but it is present in the first edition (Venice, 1590) and in all current editions. 18s Jber d.

The Greek translation of ' T~ b t RI X (Deut. 32:40) is Q7rt apw^ Els 7~' o papvP 7rP XEip 'iov Kal 6Lto~0patL 7v E&amp;-6t pov. The second half of the phrase, beginning with Kal, is a baffling addition. It can hardly be explained by an assumption that the equivalent of this portion was in the Hebrew text of the translator, since its presence would be a veritable distortion of this beautiful verse, and we ought not to assume the existence of a distortion. It cannot be supposed that this addition was the result of a reflection on Isa. 62:8, for the reason that the Greek translation of this verse is materially different from the added portion here. The explanation of it will have to be sought again in the Targum. This phrase ig rendered in Onkelos in a figurative manner, namely, '~:' f'l r '= - r':p'R "NW. This rendering does not agree with the translation in Onkelos of the same anthropomorphic phrase "*'I7 1 '1Rr (Exod. 6:8; Num. 14:30), which is )1 7 n' "p '11. This leads to the assumption that the Onkelos rendering of Deut. 32:40 was coined later and introduced in the Targum. Ps. Jonathan has here undoubtedly the older trans- lation. The rendering there is "' n' Y22 '3"pT "' (in Num- bers the rendering is the same except that it has D'W1 instead of n'7pT, while in Exodus it follows Onkelos). This render- ing was reproduced in the Septuagint. But it would seem that somebody, at a later time, who was unable to make out the sense of the expression added the words ri-v 'EdY ov. It may also be added that the Greek rendering of 11N= in Exod. 6:8 and Num. 14:30 is Ec-~TE a, which may have been the original rendering of RNU in Deut. 32:40. The following are a few instances of a less complex nature: Gen. 14:5, Vt '" , is rendered in the Septuagint by roi~ yslyav-ras. This corresponds with W'(" in Onkelos. But while the Targum (and the Syriac also) persists in this rendering, the Septuagint does not follow it in Deut. 2:11, .... VREs', and in verse 20. It treats ="N47 as a proper noun and has for it aoadlv. The Septuagint to Gen. 32:21 contains a complement preceding the last word, namely, rapayLv~'rat. In this the Septuagint follows the</page><page sequence="20">60 THE AMERICAN' JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Targum. However, the Septuagint does not have this complement in verse 19, where the Targum retained it. The omission of the com- plement in verse 19 must be ascribed to the unique working of the revision. For the sake of emphasis it should be pointed out that the Syriac has the Targumic complement in verse 19 but has none in verse 21. The process of revision worked there in the other direction. The Seventy to Gen. 49:25, . . . . ='71 : , contains a dupli- cate rendering. One is literal; the other, which is exegetic, had been, by error, amalgamated with the rendering of the following verse. The exegetic rendering is exactly that in Onkelos. Ps. Jonathan presented the older and literal rendering. Lev. 4:3, ' :2, M, ., , is ren- dered in the Septuagint by .... o6 apXtepevs .... , thus making clear that the high priest is meant here. This agrees with Onkelos, who rendered it N. N,. This is not the case in verses 5 and 16; the Septuagint there is literal. The Targum retains its rendering of verse 3. The literal seems to have been the original one. It would appear that originally the Targum also rendered it literally. For in 6:15 the rendering in Onkelos is literal. Only Ps. Jonathan has 3'l ,it2, which is probably an emendation by a later copyist. In the following instance the new revised rendering kept some of the old rendering for no special necessity or explicable reason. Thus in Gen. 40:13, R~' R'nR M677S , the Septuagint follows the Targum in rendering it exegetically, namely, p-6'~I(TerTat fapaw - 7S aPXs o'Cov. The last phrase, r)s aPXs, is a remnant of the old, literal rendering. The same joint rendering is followed in verse 20. However, Onkelos there pre- sents the same case. While verse 13 is rendered --' u-1 " , verse 20 has .... r' ' .~1; the phrase "j' ' n, which makes scarcely good sense, is a relic of the old, literal rendering. Ps. Jonathan preserved that rendering. In verse 13 it has it side by side with the revised one, namely, IT"1 n 1~'; while in verse 20 the literal only is found: .... ='. 1  ' 2.1'1 .

The</page><page sequence="21">THE TARGUM AND THE SEPTUAGINT 61 Septuagint, however, has a different rendering of =1 in 9:2, which is literal, namely, EVbIlK?7. Deut. 2:23, V'ln?n , is translated in the Targum 'pN Ep, "the Cappadocians." So is the translation in Gen. 10:14. The Syriac has the same translation. The Septuagint is not so consistent. It fol- lows the Targum in Deut. 2:23, where its rendering is Kara'8oKES, but is transcribing the text in Gen. 10:14, namely, Ka#OoptLE,.4. The latter appears to be earlier, which, in the case of Deuteronomy, was dis- placed. That this happened at a comparatively early date is shown by the fact that the Greek translator of Amos renders unE.I: (Amos 9:7) by Ka7rraboKLas. Jonathan and the Syriac have there the same rendering. The conclusions to be drawn from the evidence adduced are of a nature to change in some measure our accepted views about the history of the Septuagint. But a comparison between the versions will prove of importance to the study of the history of the Targum as well. The Targum, or what is contained in Onkelos, had undergone a drastic revision on a much larger scale than the Septuagint, as was indicated above. Traces of this revision constitute the variations of the renderings of certain words a number of which came up in the in- stances cited above. A great many of the rejected (and so the older) renderings of the Aramaic version found shelter in Ps. Jonathan. They were allowed to remain there by the circumstance that Ps. Jonathan never enjoyed official recognition and the scrupulous watch of the re- ligious authority. It was originally a collection of the sermons of the Methurgemans based on particular passages of the sabbatical read- ings. The Methurgeman quoted the verse around which revolved his sermon or statement. The quotation was the Aramaic translation cur- rent at that time. On the other hand, the copyist, like the Methurge- man, would not be so close to the theme as to begin with the verse, which is at the base of it, but would run over the whole portion before and after this particular verse. To these quotations, and in some cases, to the verses immediately preceding and following them, we have to turn our search for the original Aramaic version. There are, however, numerous possibilities against which we have to guard ourselves. Ps. Jonathan had been frequently submitted to all kinds of changes, re- vision of translations, of supplementing, and addition of later Mid-</page><page sequence="22">62 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES rashic material. An effort was made to bring the translations in Ps. Jonathan closer to those in Onkelos. But it was not a concerted effort. Much had been left untouched, or, in some cases, the reviser would hesitate to displace the older rendering and would satisfy himself by appending to it the one in Onkelos. No uniform method was employed in the revision. Some scholar felt the necessity of supplementing a literal rendering in Onkelos. He added a complement, but, unable to impose the change on the Onkelos, he would transport the changed rendering of Onkelos into Ps. Jonathan, substituting it for its own. To detect the earlier rendering which underlay the one in Onkelos, we have to look, first, for traces of revision of a given rendering in Ps. Jonathan, namely, for typical deviations, and, by comparison, to search for them in Onkelos; second, by a comparison with the Septua- gint. An agreement between Ps. Jonathan and the Septuagint in strik- ing renderings means that the rendering in Ps. Jonathan is the earlier, the original Targumic rendering, which influenced the one in the Sep- tuagint. Several cases of agreement between Ps. Jonathan and the Septua- gint were pointed out in the course of our discussions of the instances cited above. They illustrate well the point in question. The following instances are of a particular nature since the agreement is confined to Ps. Jonathan and the Septuagint: Gen. 4:8, =' b p "1 pn 1, Ps. Jonathan and the Fragment have the addition ( 'I1) p NRD . The Septuagint has the same addition: AtwX60IE Els r6b rEbto. The Syriac also has this addition. This agreement cannot be dismissed as accidental. There can hardly be any doubt as to which of the versions is responsi- ble for this agreement. It is Ps. Jonathan. It represents the older Tar- gumic rendering which, as Heller (T. E, n. 7) pointed out, is based on an early interpretation, and which influenced the Samaritan. Gen. 38:15, 'D ~ln C " : Ps. Jonathan has here an addition, "7r' )" : "n w7 M 1 6, 'I 1 (this is the correct reading). The Septu- agint has the same addition, Kat oi E riyVfo ar7T~ V. The addition here is of an interpretative nature. It does not necessarily imply a different reading in the text. See Meg. 10b, - - . . ,_ .-'M MC V124</page><page sequence="23">THE TARGUM AND THE SEPTUAGINT 63 .... , 'I" 1' R ~1 1. Hence the striking character of the agree- ment. Gen. 29:17, t'l I R ':"1: The Fragment renders MrVi by i'~~, "weak." This is the rendering which is recorded in the Agada as having drawn upon itself the condemnation of R. Jochanan (Genesis Rabba 70, 12; also Baba Bathra 123a) for its disrespectful in- sinuation "against the righteous ones" ("p?'1- n1.3). The rendering of Onkelos is "W', "beautiful," which was clearly the result of this later reaction. The Septuagint agrees with the Fragment, rendering it by aeOEvELs. The Syriac adopted the rendering of the fragment. That this was the earlier Targumic rendering is also shown in the Agada, where the cause of the malady of her eyes is described (Baba Bathra 123a; Tanchuma, ed. Buber, Genesis, p. 152). Gen. 30:27, '1irV: Onkelos, for cautious respect to the fathers, renders it by "1'C, "I tried." It is followed by the Syriac, which used the same word. Ps. Jonathan renders it by 'C2Ip ' , "I divined by charms of birds." 'MCp, apparently, is a later addi- tion. So are also rendered ii~n ~h3 (Gen. 44:5), =';17' V~:D (Gen. 44:15), in Ps. Jonathan (and also the Fragment, vs. 15), where C1'p1 is missing. This is exactly the rendering in Septuagint, oovc- aA7Y, etc. The Septuagint keeps this rendering throughout but not so Ps. Jonathan. It has instead "' in Lev. 19:26; Num. 23: 23; Deut. 18:10. The difference points to a revision of the Tar- gumic rendering of this word. The clues of this revision are clearly visible in Onkelos, for while it renders "r  (Gen. 30:27) by "rr , it renders nr"' "Ch (44:5, 15) by Rpt apT7. The reason for interpreting this expression figuratively being the same as in 30:27, namely, the respect for the fathers, the question naturally arises, What prompted the translator to employ here a different ren- dering? The answer to this question is that this rendering, NP1I p')=:, represents a later and further revision. Originally the revision was applied only to 30:27, leaving the old rendering in 44:5, 15. But at a later time it was changed and the author of the new rendering was rather inclined to have a new translation of his own instead of the one used in 30:27. On the other hand, the rendering of iX' elsewhere in</page><page sequence="24">64 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SEMITIC LANGUAGES Onkelos is N'~ (Lev. 19:26; Num. 23:23; 24:1; Deut. 18:10).

It may also be added that r is the rendering also in Jonathan (I Kings 20:33; II Kings 17: 17; 21:6). Since Ci) appears also in Ps.

The Septuagint has exactly the same literal rendering, rErolT7KEV 7r"orav T' 5bOav TaWT?7v. Exod. 5:3, NRpt 1'b5y, is rendered in Onkelos by N3B: "bSn. The Syriac renders it in a similar way. Ps. Jonathan, however, translates it literally: -pN . This is the rendering in the Septuagint: rPOOTKE'KX7Tat. Num. 13:28, p ': 7 ?5': Onkelos renders p:M by N Z . Ps. Jonathan attaches to the rendering of Onkelos also one which treats 'pY as a proper noun: N125 p :1 "'. However, in verse 33 both Onkelos and Ps. Jonathan regard p:7 as a proper noun. But both of them treat p'I in Deut. 2:21 (DP'p3;) as a descriptive noun and accordingly render it ' This incon- sistency was due to a revision. The Syriac and the Septuagint are consistent in the rendering of this noun. The former follows Onkelos, the latter Ps. Jonathan, rendering p'1 by iVK (except in Num. 13:33). Num. 24:19, . . 71"r: Onkelos renders '7'1 by n1M17, taking '71 as the imperfect of "'71. Ps. Jonathan and the Fragment render it by CIp'", thus treating 1'I' as the imperfect of t'71. The Syriac follows Onkelos. But the Septuagint agrees with Ps. Jonathan and renders it Kal ey-EpO?7cETact. 19 Gen. R. (73:2) quotes the rendering of Onkelos of 30:27 but adds to it --~n9) '1-p1.

Ps. Jonathan renders it by ;'1 , which is exactly the rendering in the Septuagint. The Syriac in this case also follows Onkelos. Deut. 33:27, t517Y 1rr'T I rr-1: Onkelos renders this anthro- pomorphic phrase figuratively, rather disguising completely the literal value of the words. Ps. Jonathan is mindful of the anthropomorphism but satisfied itself with a figurative intonation. The rendering there is ,'nf~f MW )nn "71. This is also the rendering in the Septuagint although not in the same order: i,r'b 'Lxv ppaXL6ov. The one in Onkelos, then, is apparently a later revision.</page></plain_text>
