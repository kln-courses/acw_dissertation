<plain_text><page sequence="1">PAUL REE. AN OBITUARY TRIBUTE TO A MAN WHO THOUGH NOT A PROFESSIONAL PHILOSOPHER WAS A DEVOUT SEARCHER FOR THE TRUTH AND AN INDEPENDENT THINKER. SCHOPENHAUER says that when a German hears the word "Idea" unctiously pronounced, his head commences to swim, and he feels as though he was going up in a balloon. This is a very tame description of the sensation one feels, and the mental torture endured by the inquirer, who attempts to hew his way through the jungle of barbarous concepts, out of which is con structed the metaphysical "system" of a Fichte or Hegel ; and then alas! to find out that this "system" is a phantasm of the brain, which only explains the sort of head which invented it, but throws no light upon the world we live in. On the other hand, Schopenhauer proved to the students and lovers of philosophy, in his incomparable, lucid style and wealth of concrete illustration, that the problems of metaphysics could be made as clear and comprehensible as any other branch of human knowledge, and that absence of obscurity was the bona fides of a philosopher. The reader who takes up the philosophy of Paul R e1 will be pleased to learn that in this modest brochure there is no attempt in a metaphysical jargon to reduce "All unto One" and then out of "One" to hatch the universe; which, if you could understand it, could only serve as a kind of intellectual chewing-cud, without an atom of digestible matter. Nor will he be confronted with the usual thick volume of German metaphysics, containing chapter after *Dr. Paul R e, Philosophic. C. Duncker, Berlin, 1903, Price, M. 6.</page><page sequence="2">712 THE MONIST. chapter, and page after page of technical terminologies, building up some labyrinthine structure, any insight into which is exceed ingly difficult, and as it is not based upon any intuitions of real life, becomes "stale, flat, and unprofitable" in theory as well as practice. Paul R e has no philosophical "system" to evolve; he neither attempts to explain the incredible, nor to solve the insolvable. He treats this inquiry into the powers, cogitations, and faculties of the human mind as a scientist, as an accomplished physiologist; and his paragraphs are short, clear, and logical, and the style is as terse and epigrammatic as the maxims of La Rochefoucault, whom he evidently admired. The following description of Paul R e's philosophy is in tended as an introduction to his scientific and philosophical method of treatment, with a few excerpts freely translated of his para graphs, illustrative of his style, matter and pithy mode of expres sion, rather than a comparison with other philosophical works, or % criticism of his conclusions. He treats philosophy as a science and not as an art or a teleological supplement. Without expressing it in words, he may have thought with Lord Bacon, that any in quiry into final causes is fruitless, and whether it was like a "virgin dedicated to God" or not-it nevertheless produces nothing. His style is as clear, direct, and precise as that of a chemist describing the elements of which bodies are composed; and he neither visits the "cloud-cuckoo-town" of abstraction, nor appeals to his imagi nation to supply data for a fictitious harmony of life. The book is divided into parts entitled: Origin of Conscience in Childhood and Humanity; Matter; Theory of Knowledge (cog nition) ; Philosophical Thoughts upon the Systems of Kant and Schopenhauer; Vanity, etc., etc. And each subject is dealt with in certain labelled paragraphs, which facilitate the task of the reader, and make it easier of comprehension. THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIENCE IN THE CHILD. As this was the subject of one of his first published books, it may be considered as embodying his earliest and later revised in</page><page sequence="3">PAUL REE. vestigations. Here our author claims to have made the most im portant distinction, and one entirely overlooked in previous works on moral philosophy. Hitherto neither the German, Scotch, nor English philosophers have asked or answered the question,-hov* does the child of a cultured or civilized age arrive at the judgment opinion or feeling, that certain acts like cruelty, robbery, and mur der are blameworthy and wrong, and, on the other hand, that acts of benevolence and love of one's neighbor, are praiseworthy and right? Does the child of the aborigines or uncivilized races think and feel that cruelty, robbery, and murder are blamable: and that be nevolent acts towards members of other races are worthy of praise ? Certainly not. Take the case first of the child of the cultured age. The three great moulders and fashioners of its opinions, feelings, and judg ment are religion, authority, (parental and magisterial), and its social companions. The child as taught by its parents, kneels and prays in the church, this most impressive edifice with the spire reaching towards heaven; and there it hears the command, as though it were the voice of God, "Love thy neighbor as thyself,11 "Thou shalt not kill, nor steal, nor lie, nor practice cruelty." Hell gapes for those who disobey, and blessedness in heaven awaits those who obey. The mind of the child is like a phonograph, what is spoken into it, comes out word for word. Then comes the lesson which the State teaches it. The judgment that certain acts are blamable, is constantly taught it. It sees, hears, or reads that the murderer has been arrested, imprisoned, and finally executed. It is a moral lesson. So with its social companions. They also have been similarly instructed ; and the child finds, in every-day speech, in all the books it reads, the plays it witnesses, and the talk of its companions, that certain acts of cruelty, stealing, or murder, are condemned, and that acts of benevolence and love of others are praised. The child does not criticize, but judges precisely as it has been taught. But how about the child of the uncivilized epoch? Does it blame acts of robbery or murder? No, it praises them. The boy hears</page><page sequence="4">714 THE MONIST. his parents boasting of successful robbery or murder. He is taught that such deeds are rewarded by the gods ; and he hears his mother pride herself in having a son who has killed his victim. The boy goes to his companions, and he hears the same thing. They may reproach him and say: "We will not play with you, you have not yet shed the blood of even an animal." Poesy and religion teach him that robbery and murder are praiseworthy. The father who is also a priest, initiates the boy in the religious poesy of a murder. "As Odin hurled his spear among the people, murder came into the world."-Edda. In some piratical voyage he learns that cruelty receives the highest praise. He who can tear the infant from its mother's breast and carry it off on the point of his spear, is brave, stout hearted ; but the soft-hearted who cannot endure the sight of such cruelty is scrorned and earns the epithet of child-man. To return to the child of the cultured age. How does there arise in the child, and in the history of mankind, the judgment, that love of one's neighbor is praisable ? What is the love of one's neighbor? It is an offshoot of mother love. Its most impor tant manifestation is pity and sympathetic joy. The mother love feels pain when the child suffers, and joy over his joy. Here we have the fact that one being can love another being: an ego loving a non-ego. And this mother love, which not only covers her own children but includes the children of another, is love of one's neigh bor in the widest sense. Take the simplest case. A mother sees a strange child in pain ; its cries, by the association of ideas, awake in her mind the pity she feels for the sufferings of her own child, and for the sufferings of every other human being. Consequently, this love is a natural product existing in mankind. But the opinion or judgment that praises this love is a product of culture, created by legislatures, founders of religion, which afterwards appear in the cultured pupil as an established customary opinion. And the author sets forth the different judgments held of it, in the successive stages of culture. How it was first con</page><page sequence="5">PAUL REE. demned as a weakness by the uncivilized, but when once the people became cultivated the blame was changed into praise. Benevolent emotions were not foreign to the Fiji Islanders, but it was considered a weakness to give in to them. A chief at the funeral of his favorite son praised as his most distinguished virtue "that he would have killed and eaten his own wife if she had insulted him." In fact, the useless shedding of human blood was considered praiseworthy. In all parts of the world, according to the reports of missionaries, travellers, and explorers, most of those acts which are punished as crimes by all civilized peoples, are either treated as virtues by the uncivilized or passed over as trifles. And this is in accordance with their religion, usage, and mode of life It is also true of the heroic age of Greece. The Thracians sold their chil dren into slavery, and considered robbery as the only honorable occupation for men. It was only in cultivated Greece in the time of Plato and Aristotle that these barbarous feelings were changed and the precepts of morality inculcated. If the reader insist that whenever he hears the word "murder," instantly his judgment con demns it, as it were by instinct, he forgets that from infancy the notion has been planted within him, and so repeatedly brought to his ears, eyes, and understanding, that it has become a constant usage. The seed was sown before he learned to reflect. Words fall into two classes: those which convey an approval or disapproval; those which simply describe the process. For in stance: Words like "murder," "treachery," "cruelty," are words ex pressing a judgment. You can separate them into two halves: the objective half, which means that some one out of revenge, avarice, or jealousy has killed a fellow being. In the other half the word conceals a judgment upon the act, viz., condemning it. In our childhood we learn to conceive in one word, the event and the judgment upon it. This is how the latter apears to us as self evident. Legislatures, moralists, and founders of religions have stamped with blame certain actions and feelings which are injurious to others, such as revenge, malice; and also impregnated with praise</page><page sequence="6">7i6 THE MONIST. those feelings and actions which are useful to others (mercy, love of our neighbor)-merely on account of their utility. But the child is taught categorically, absolutely, "Thou shalt not be revengeful! Mercy is praiseworthy." Thus being educated as a child, the man finds in himself a conscience, which absolutely commands "Thou shalt" or "Thou shalt not," and accepts them as self-evident and as inborn. Schopenhauer correctly perceived that the categorical impera tive of Kant, "Thou shalt," had its origin in his early religious in struction; but strangely enough, he did not perceive that his own "pity," instead of being innate, born within us, was also a reminis cence of the catechism learned when a boy. Schopenhauer asserts that "pity" is an incontestable fact of the human conscience and is not based upon suppositions, concepts, dogmas, myths, education, or training ; but is original and innate in human nature itself, and reveals itself in all lands and ages. To this Paul Ree replies: "I agree with you in all that you say about pity. But the opinion, the judgment, of praise or blame which is passed upon pity is not innate. This opinion, this judgment, is no part of human conscience, nor is it essentially proper to it; but is in fact based upon suppositions, concepts, dogmas, myths, religions, education, and training; and does not lie in human nature itself, nor reveal itself in al? lands and ages." Morality is a complicated system ; it teaches that you must love your neighbor, but in war you must kill him. Is a man naturallv good? The answer depends upon whether he belongs to the lower or higher stage of civilization. In the lower stage you ask, is the natural man revengful, cruel, and hard-hearted ? Yes. But with these good (praisable) qualities, bad ones are mixed ; he is naturally placable, soft-hearted, compassionate. Thus he is tolerably good, but not entirely so. In a higher stage of civilization: Is the natural man placable, soft-hearted, compassionate? Yes. But mixed with these prais able (good) qualities are bad ones; the man by nature is revenge ful, hard-hearted, and cruel. And these bad qualities outweigh the good ones : thus by nature he is not good but bad.</page><page sequence="7">PAUL REE. 717 What actions are universally blamed, permits of no answer. By the ancient Norwegians a pirate, sea-robbber, was not blamed, but considered a hero. It was only for utilitarian reasons, viz., that the soil of the country should be cultivated, that piracy fell into disrepute, and was ultimately punished with mutilation and death. As for the law of nature, that exists only in the heads of the professors of jurisprudence. Paul R e analyses with clearness and insight the origin of the concepts, natural right, duty, justice, obli gation, ownership, etc., which would take up too much space to quote here. In relation to the so-called moral sense, he has this to say: The moral sense is the relation or connection between certain acts and the praise or blame which we attach to them. A special moral sense does not exist. Hume's ethics which he considered his best work, if devoid of error, has still a gap in it. He teaches that those qualities which are useful to us are stamped as virtues; but he forgets to explain why morality, if dependent upon utility, nevertheless appears to be independent. This appearance is thus accounted for: To the child or pupil only the moral precept is delivered ; but not its cause, utility. Utility is the spool around which moral precepts are spun ; the moralist who understands how to unwind them sees the spool, but the others see only the precepts. "He who makes the distinction, qr discriminates between the child and the adult mankind, has eaten of the tree of knowledge: he alone knows what is good and evil." After the laws of morality have been established for the good of humanity, they are impressed upon the minds of each succeeding generation. And the children of each succeeding generation must learn the rules and precepts of morality and its exceptions for them selves. And as they grow up, these rules and precepts appear as self-evident and born within them. THE ORIGIN OF CONSCIENCE IN MANKIND. The history of the evolution of man traces this development from an animal. Mankind were first herders of cattle ; naked</page><page sequence="8">7i8 THE MONIST. hunters and fishermen, leading insecure lives in dirt and misery. Although the intervening stages cannot be traced, one of the suc ceeding steps of evolution was the appearance of family life. Single families scattered over large areas of territory, lived in iso lated huts, the head of which became king and priest. The family morals forbade a member to rob or murder one of the same family; but if it happened that he killed or robbed one belonging to another family, the act was not considered blamable by his own family. Each family lived in a sea of blood. Stern necessity alone pre scribed certain rules of conduct. In due course of time, as the family multiplied in numbers to a people or a nation, the family morals became the morals of a nation. At the time when mankind were scattered and living in isolated families it was not blamable to rob or murder members of other families. The act was not punished by the chief or head of the family, nor condemned by the community. But the relatives of the murdered man would take revenge as a matter of course; and the more fearful the revenge, the more glorious the deed. As the families increased and became a people, a change took place, not only in their mode of thought or manner of regarding such acts, but also in the punishment awarded them. The historical origin of punishment teaches us that it was founded upon utilitarian reasons. To stop the shedding of blood in acts of revenge, came compensa tion to the murdered man's relatives in arms or cattle, peace-money, blood-money, and finally punishment by the laws of the State. The author traces with great clearness and illustrates with abundant concrete instances the various stages from individual ven geance to the erection of asylums for refugees-the buying off of revenge, by compensation and peace-money, up to the institution of fixed punishments and penalties by the State. He then undertakes to answer two important questions: How does the idea of god arise? How does the notion or conception arise that actions punishable by men are also punishable by the god head? He goes back to the stage of the uncivilized. When the savage hears the coming storm growling in the distance and watches in fear its approach nearer and nearer, until it suddenly bursts in</page><page sequence="9">PAUL REE. 719 tremendous thunder claps above his head, and sees the lightning flashes, not only splitting trees but killing men and cattle; in that moment of horror his heart quakes within him, and in the raging tempest he also hears the voice of some mighty power, and sees an angry threatening countenance with eyes that kill. Pay attention to this moment, for in it a god is born. Like a child the savage asks: Who thunders? Who storms? Who strikes the earth? He naturally conceives this power in the form of a man; with a man's voice, a man's eyes, but eyes whose flashes kill men. Thus the gods are men, but being born of human terror, they are human monsters. Deos facit timor. Consequently the gods are the personifications of certain terrifying events in nature. That fear created them is not so important for this subject, as that they are created in the image of man: anthropomorphism is the funda mental insight by which it is explained, but not without it. The gods of the uncivilized men are in the likeness of the uncivilized; and the gods of the civilized, cultured, are in the likeness of the cultured peoples. After the Homeric period, agriculture, trade, the arts, and sci ences were cultivated. And these foster children of peace required that actions like robbery and murder should be condemned and threatened with punishment. The requirement was fulfilled by the legislature and the spirit of the age. And the gods? They were behind the times. They did not yet blame those actions that were condemned on earth. And the gods had to be transformed and fitted to the improved mode of thought; but for a long time they maintained their old character and morality. The more cultured men became, the more striking became the contrast between the grossness of the gods and the refinement of the people. Lucian remarks that a Grecian youth, who has been instructed in Homer and Hesiod and finally goes out into the world, finds to his amaze ment that the very same deeds which Homer and Hesiod attributed to the gods in heaven are threatened with punishment on earth. The incongruity between the morals of the gods and men became a scandal of the age ; and the morals of the former had to be modified</page><page sequence="10">720 THE MONIST. to suit the spirit of the times. Accordingly the Homeric heart is torn out of the body of poor old Jupiter and a new one put in its place; and then the new Jupiter threatens with punishment those very actions hitherto committed with impunity. Heaven and earth might then be compared to two clocks that at first kept time together ; but gradually the former lost ,and when they were too far apart it had to be put forward again. To recapitulate: So long as cheating, robbery, and murder did not appear blamable to the people it was not blamed by the people's od. When the people arrived, however, at such a stage of culture that such actions were forbidden and punished, they were also for bidden and threatened with punishment by the people's god. In other words, the law did not come down but came back from heaven. World, or universal, morality differs from a people's or nation's morality in two points. A nation's morals is only concerned with certain actions; universal morality includes also the feelings, senti ments, and dispositions. The Old Testament teaches the morals of one nation or people, the New Testament teaches the morals of humanity: one commands certain actions, the other feelings, senti ment. The former commands "Thou shalt not kill," the latter "Thou shalt not even harbor anger against thy neighbor." It was for the good of humanity that Jesus of Nazareth broad ened the morality of actions to also include the morality of feelings. Out of pity for the poor, the lame, the cripple, the blind, and out of love for humanity at large, Jesus preached love of others. Would the doctrines of Jesus have lasted and spread over a great portion of the earth, if he had simply preached love of one's neighbor? Probably not. But Jesus was not only a moral leader, but a founder of religion. And here is verified how anthropo morphism is the universal explainer. Jesus was personified love of others, consequently "God is love." In the historical development of humanity this has often hap pened. All peoples at their highest point of culture attain to this conception of universal morality. Thus the stages in the history of the moral-religious evolution of humanity are :</page><page sequence="11">PAUL REE. 72I Family morals-family divinity. People's morals-people's divinity. World morals-world divinity. Morality is like a tree which at first only shelters a family, then a whole people rests in its shadow, and finally humanity. MATTER. In this chapter, one of the most important in the book, Paul R e sets forth in a most uncompromising manner his subjective idealism, and specifically analyses with great particularity the vari ous sensations of pain, hearing, sight, touch, and taste, and traces in each concrete instance the physiological process with elementary clearness. As he had received the degree of Doctor of Medicine at Berlin and Munich, his scientific presentation of these sensations are of value to the reader. One or two of these illustrations are here given in substance but not in detail. Take the sensation of pain. One who suffers from toothache will assert that the pain is in the toooth. Between the troublesome tooth and the brain there runs a thread called a nerve ; if the tooth end of the nerve is irritated, say by pressure, a nerve-current is stimulated which, on reaching the brain, produces the sensation called pain. This is a case of false localization. Take another case. A foot, on account of some disease, is am putated above the ankle ; nevertheless, after the amputation, certain sensations of pain, or itching, are localized by the patient in the foot which is no longer attached to his body. The proof that the pain is in the brain and not in the foot is thus given. He puts the case of a sound foot which has not been amputated. If the nerve is cut, say in the leg, which ultimately reaches the brain, and after Wards a hot iron is applied to the sound foot, not the slightest sensation of pain is felt by the patient. The message was not de livered. So with sound and the sense of hearing. If you clap your hands, there arise (silent) air-waves which reach your tympanum, and the latter communicates these silent vibrations to the three small bones, the membrane, the mucous, and finally the auditory</page><page sequence="12">722 THE MONIST. nerve; here the nerve-current is stimulated, which ultimately stim ulates the brain-cell and produces the sensation of sound, tones. If the brain-cell, where the nerve of the tooth enters, is stimulated by a nerve-current, "pain" is felt, but if the brain-cell, where the auditory nerve enters, is stimulated as above, sound is produced. Whence this difference? No one can answer it. Let us discrimi nate between the sound and its cause. The clapping produces silent air-waves; these silent air-waves, vibrations, cause through the various connecting links a silent nerve-current, which stimu lates the brain-cell and produces "sound." Thus a transformation takes place, silence becomes sound. The expression "sound" or "sonorous waves," strictly taken, is false ; these air-waves are silent. Take the roar of a great city. The motor screams, a trumpet blows its fan-fare, thousands of wheels go rattling over the stones, men are shouting, talking, you add your own speech to the tumult ; but if you think that all this noise comes from the locomotive, the trumpet, the mouths of men, and the wheels on the stone pavement, you are mistaken. Those motions only produce silent air-waves; the noise is in your brain. Outside the stillness of death prevails. It is another case of false localization. So with light. According to the hypothesis of the physicists an almost infinitely attenuated and elastic medium fills space, which they call ether, which they call non-luminous, and which like air can be made to vibrate in waves. Physiologically expressed, a non-luminous object, a lighted candle, generates non-luminous ether-waves, which reach the eye as air-waves reach the ear, and stimulate the optic nerve ; of course the intervening links of the process being taken into consideration, the nerve-current stimulates the brain-cell, and the result is light. The light which appears to be in the candle is, in fact, in the brain. Strictly speaking, the expression light-waves is misleading. It will be noticed that here the effect is totally different from the cause: non-luminous ether-waves producing light. Idealism can be thus popularly presented. It is evident that the bodies do not possess all the qualities which are arbitrarily at tributed to them. For example: does what we call "sweet" lie in</page><page sequence="13">PAUL REE. 723 the sugar? Impossible, for "sweetness" is a taste, a sensation; that is in me and not in the sugar. Now, if "sweetness" is not present in the sugar, and yet it calls forth in me the sensation, taste of "sweetness," then my taste of "sweetness" is caused by something "non-sweet" in the sugar. But this discrimination is by no means made involuntarily. If sugar melts on my tongue, I do not separate the sensation "sweet" in me from the something "non-sweet" in the sugar. But the process is precisely opposite: I misplace my sensa tion of sweetness in the sugar and impute to it one of my sensa ions, taste, as one of the qualities of the sugar. The same process takes place with my sensation of color; I also impute to the sugar my sensation of "white" as one of its qualities, also my feeling of hardness, and still other sensations. What is it that excites in me the sensations of "sweetness," "white ness," "hardness," complex-perceptions, complex-ideas? An un known something, ether-waves, X Y Z. If sweet, smooth, hard, sharp, and the other perceptions of qualities of bodies are without any independent existence, then "bodies," complex-sensations, com plex-ideas, are also without any independent reality. My own body is a mere complex of ideas. "I am a conglomerate of perceptions ! It is inconceivable, but true." What is matter? The sum total of my perceptions, ideas, feel ings, which are falsely localized outside of me. To the bodies which I perceive belong also the bodies of my fellow men. But where they appear to me to be, is the unknown exciter, stimulator of my per ceptions, viz., hypothetical ether-waves = XYZ. The proportion cogito ergo sum is false: It should be: Sum co gitans. Plainer and clearer it cannot be made. The following epitomized dialogue describes Kant's relation to Bishop Berkeley, or "poor Berkeley" as Kant calls him. Berkeley. "Kant, I have just come from reading your philosophy, and am delighted with it. I said to myself, Kant evi dently understands me. He has taken up my ideas and confirmed them from different points of view. I laid the egg, and Kant has hatched it!" Kant. "Don't make me angry. My doctrine differs from</page><page sequence="14">724 THE MONIST. yours heaven high. I have a Ding an sich (the-thing as-it-is-in-itself), but you have not." Berkeley. "You amaze me. Is your refutation of idealism put forth seriously? I took it for a joke. Besides it is in conceivable that you should claim that I have no Ding an sich (thing-as-it-is-in-itself). We both assert that everything perceptible, viz., form, color, and material, is merely an idea, perception. You teach that the idea of 'house' is produced in me by your Ding an sich of the 'house.' Now I teach that the idea 'house' is pro duced in me by God. Let me ask you, what do you know of your Ding an sich? Nothing, absolutely noth ing; except that by some unknown cause it produces in you the idea 'house.' What do I know of God? Noth ing, except that he causes the idea 'house' to arise in my mind." Kant. "You cannot reason away my doctrine in that manner. There is a second thing which you have overlooked. According to my doctrine, things are phenomena of the noumena (Ding an sich), while with you they are merely phenomena, appearances." Berkeley closes the argument by telling Kant that he is not dealing fairly with the question, and quoting his own words : , "External objects belong just as much to the think ing subjects as all other thoughts ; only they possess the deception that they, as it were, detach themselves from the soul, and appear to hover outside of us; for the space in which we perceive them is nothing but an idea. Bravo Kant! More idealistic than that I could not express myself. If all objects exist only in our thoughts, then my body exists nowhere but in my thoughts ; my body is my idea, my perception. T am only a conglomerate of ideas." Dr. Ree asks, if bodies are merely ideas, why do they not ap pear to us merely as ideas, perceptions, and not as bodies outside of us? That we do not know. Whoever presents a problem clearly</page><page sequence="15">PAUL REE. 725 and unmistakably as inexplicable, deserves credit for this statement. Pseudo explanations are the corruption of philosophy. CAUSALITY. In his analysis and exposition of causality he arrives at the conclusion that Hume and Mill are right; and that the claims of Kant and Schopenhauer that the causal law is known to us a priori, is not proved. What is the meaning of the word "cause"? It may be thus defined : "the course of nature is regular, invariable." For instance, motion invariably follows a blow, thrust, or push of any kind ; that is to say, not sometimes only, but regularly. Cause is an event in so far as it regularly succeeds another event or change. But it must be noted that causality means to us something more than regular, constant succession. And this is due to the fact that from child hood we have always seen motion to follow from a blow or push, and have becom econvinced that through all time and eternity a similar result will follow; we think involuntarily that there is a necessary connection or band between the two. Between cause and effect in general there is only an external connection but no inner band of necessity. He then outlines the origin of the causal con science. For instance, a child has repeatedly learned through ex perience that the point of a needle pricks; and if it unexpectedly feels the pain of being pricked, it involuntarily thinks of, and looks around for, the needle. So with the fire: experience has taught it that fire burns, and if it approaches unawares the fire and feels the pain of being "burnt," it naturally thinks of a fire and looks for it. And having repeatedly seen a ball roll when struck, if it happens to see one rolling along, without having noticed the blow, it naturally looks around for the striker. Now, after witnessing for a hundred thousand times one event always succeeding another event, it forms the conception that every event is always preceded by another event. Thus the concept of causality is a concept drawn from expe rience. If it be objected that the two events are bound together by necessity, this word, necessity, distinguishes the causal concept as a concept a priori, which is a spurious necessity.</page><page sequence="16">726 THE MONIST. The child in the first place never sees a ball moving of itself, that is without a blow preceding it ; and therefore the conception of a ball moving of its own accord is difficult to conceive, almost an impossibility. Arid giving expression to this thought-difficulty, one says a blow must precede the movement of a ball. "One can't think otherwise." This "must," this "cannot think otherwise," is simply a habit, usage of the mind. Ask an unsophisticated person: Can a ball of itself, without cause, commence to roll? No. It is an impossible thought. Can it stop of itself, without cause? Certainly, the ball generally stops of itself. Thus the opposite of the causal law is not inconceivable, but simply difficult to conceive. He repeats: The necessity of the causal law is not genuine, but spurious; its necessity is merely imaginary. But can we imagine an effect without cause? Cer tainly not. One must distinguish between a change and an effect. Change means merely an alteration of a state or condition, but does not mean that the change of condition or state has a cause. An effect also means a change of condition or state, but at the same time expresses the thought that change of state has a cause. You can no more think of an effect without a cause than of a nephew without an uncle. After a long detailed analysis, illustrated with numerous concrete instances, he asserts that there is no inner band or necessary connection between cause and effect. As to Kant's claim for the apriority of the causal law, he attacks it repeatedly as in the following instance : At twelve o'clock I perceive a ship outside the mouth of a river; and fifteen minutes later I perceive the ship to be some dis tance inside of it. Am I certain that my perception corresponds in fact to the thing perceived? Only under the presupposition of the law of causality can I know whether, when I saw it outside, it was really there and not inside ;-I must conceive the change of position to have been causally effected. This is Kant's claim. Causality is not subtracted from the constant succession of events, as Hume thought, but on the contrary, the succession of events, in order to be perceptible, presupposes the concept of causality.</page><page sequence="17">PAUL REE. 727 One would naturally expect Kant to explain and prove the assertion, but he simply repeats it over and over again, as though it were a self-evident proposition. Kant's treatment of causality, so far as Hume is concerned, is a step backward, and made, too, in seven-leagued boots. He admits that Hume is right in teaching that individual causal relations we learn from experience; that a push or blow causes changes of position in space, and changes of temperature from heat. But the universal law of causality-every change has a cause-we know a priori-is born in us. Yet in all branches of human knowledge the rule is drawn from the cases; but Kant teaches the opposite, viz., the rule is known to us a priori, born within us, as it were ; and the cases are only known to us a posteriori. This is extremely improbable and needs irrefutable proof, which he does not furnish. According to Kant, causality is not, as Hume claims, abstracted from the suc cession of events, but on the contrary, the succession of events, in order to be perceptible, presupposes the concept, causality. Hume and Kant remind one of the two advocates in Scott's romance of Redgauntlet. After Hume, with wonderful skill and art, had disentagled the various difficulties of the case, Kant with equal art and skill entangled it all up again. Passing from Kant's theory of causality, here is an amusing instance how Dr. Ree combats Kant's category of space. If Kant's assertion be true, that space has no independent existence or reality outside of us, but is merely a subjective condition of perception, born within us, some of the consequences are quite lamentable. For instance: Where am I? In space? But the only space is in me. The space of Caesar was different from that of Pompey. Where was the battle of Pharsalus fought? In Caesar's space or Pompey's space? As there are millions of men, each with the only space in his head, so there must be millions of spaces; but Kant teaches that there is only one space, and that is infinite. With the first man came space into the world; when the last human being dies infinite space also vanishes. Think of the probable fate of the lovers, Hans and Gretel! They are in love with each other, and yet no meeting-place can be</page><page sequence="18">728 THE MONIST. found. Hans possesses infinite space and endless time, and Gretel is also in possession of infinite space and endless time. But how can the infinite space which is in Hans's head arrive at the infinite space which is in Gretel's ? It is no good suggesting that each one should go tq the boundary of his or her infinite space, and there find a rendezvous ; for space, being infinite, has no boundary. And there the lovers stand, with arms outstretched, and no possible space upon which they can meet. What a pretty philosophical ro mance could be made of this Kantian notion of space! In discussing idealism and realism in his chapter upon the theory of cognition, he claims that the nature of things forces the scientific, philosophical thinker to be both idealist and materialist. Idealism is at once true and yet inconceivable ; but materialism is no more conceivable than its opposite. For instance: a person has a hole in his head through which can be seen not ouly his brain, but also, let us suppose, its molecular action. And this molecular action one must accept as thinking; the grey matter is calculating the course of the stars, or perhaps animated with passion, or arriv ing at some difficult conclusion, or willing. Now this assumption is just as incomprehensible as its opposite idealism, according to which one is a conglomerate of ideas, feelings ; and the grey matter of the brain is one of these ideas. The materialist says: The simple organisms probably are evolved out of inorganic matter, and out of the simplest organisms, evolution has produced animals, apes, man. The brain is an organ of man. and the brain thinks ; consequently, ideas, feelings, percep tions, are a product of the brain, and brain is matter. The idealist says : the matter bf the brain is not the primary the matrix- of the perceiving subject; but the latter is the primary, and matter is one of its ideas. Both are right, and yet how incom prehensible it is, that both intuitions are correct. He who can answer this question has solved the problem of the universe. Immanent, transcendental speculations have harmonized these opposing tenets, but not by any honest thinker. There is no great philosopher in the sense that Hervey was a great physiologist and Copernicus a great astronomer. They established certain universal</page><page sequence="19">PAUL REE. 729 truths. Idealism is irrefutable, and yet it is incomprehensible. As Hobbs says "from hence followeth that whatsoever accidents or qualities our senses make us think there may be in the world, they be not there, but are seeming and apparitions only.-We conclude such things to be without, that are within us." As can be seen from the above extracts, Dr. R e subjects Kant's theories to a very drastic criticism; and the Ding an sich (thing-as-it-is-in-itself), the doctrines of space and time, the categ orical imperative, and a priori ideas and judgments, are treated with grim Carlylean humor. He claims that Kant slaughtered in his theoretic philosophy, God, freedom of the will, and immortality ; but that they re-appear again as ghosts in his practical philosophy. A philosopher who had not studied the philosophy of Kant, once said of him, "I hear, Herr Kant, that on one side of your phil osophical system, you have destroyed God, freedom, and immor tality, and yet they nevertheless peep out of the windows of the other side of your philosophical system. How did you manage that?" "Oh," replied Kant, "I postulate God, freedom, and immor tality," and turned away from his astonished inquirer. Dr. R e thinks that there are only two grains of wheat in a bushel of chaff in the Kantian philosophy, and what they are we will leave to the reader to find out. Schopenhauer's theories do not fare much bet ter than those of Kant. He concedes to Schopenhauer the merit that his presentations are clear, clever, and ingenious, and inter woven with the finest observations of nature; and that one could compile a volume of quotations from his works, containing nothing but what is true, excellent, and rich in intellectual thought. But he, too, has been the victim of his own theories, and Dr. Ree pro ceeds to subject the offenders to his usual painstaking, analytical criticism. The following is a fair specimen: The production of a system like Schopenhauer's demands a rare combination of qualities. One must possess a good judgment, but also know when to use and when to ignore it; be blind to the facts which oppose and believe the most incredible things that favor it.</page><page sequence="20">73 THE MONIST. For example: Schopenhauer asserts that the blood, with a metaphysical freedom of will, flows without cause back to the heart ! In order to do justice to this crazy thought we will accompany a little drop of blood on its circulating course. It starts from the heart as a common citizen of this causal world, and this common causal character clings to it on its path through the capillary ves sels. But while it creeps through these capillary arteries it ap proaches the greatest event of its career, and this takes place the moment it leaves the last capillary artery and arrives at the first vein. At this instant, O envied drop of blood! the law of causality falls like a chain away; and with elevated head it flows, or runs, without cause back to the heart. And yet, no sooner is it in the heart, than this poor little drop of blood is once more a slave to the law of causality. Thus two-thirds of its course it is subject to the causal law; but enjoys at least one third of its journey free from the propelling force of causality. What proof does he offer to sustain this assertion? There being no serious proof at his dis posal, he had none to offer. Schopenhauer perceived clearly enough that man's thinking organ, far from being his real essence, an immortal thing, was only a tool, like other organs of the body which ministered to life, and desired to perpetuate itself. The same was true of all other organ isms. But here closes according to Paul R e the acceptable portion of Schopenhauer's philosophy. When he arrived at this point he made two phantastic leaps, a small one and a colossal one. The small one is the extension of this principle over the thing-as-it-is in-itself ; as even this, in a very indecent maner, desires to live and to propagate. In truth, its first desire is the will to live; and its last the will not to live. The imagination cannot invent so many contradictions as are gathered together in the head of a philosopher. It rains assertions in the ethics. A compassionate onlooker is transcendentally ident ical with the one who suffers from an injury. To the impertinent who asks for proof, Schopenhauer full of divine wrath thunders: "You want proofs? Go to the miserable, contemptible sciences! Intuitive genius alone reigns in philosophy. The veil of Maya</page><page sequence="21">PAUL REE. 731 which covers the eyes of the rest of mankind has a hole in it, and I, Arthur Schopenhauer, have looked through this hole, and I see the nature, the essence of all things, and I perceive that the artistic thing-as-it-is-in-itself wills the world; but that the moral thing-as it-is-in-itself wills it to perish!" "The power of words over thought is densely illustrated by that phrase thing-as-it-is-in-itself" And so on to the end of the chapter. No wonder that Voltaire in his time cried, "O metaphysics, we are about as far advanced as were the Druids in their time;" and we might ask: are we any further advanced to-day? Dr. R e was a very ardent admirer of the works of La Roche foucauld, and as a result he has inserted in his philosophy a chapter upon Vanity, in which he endeavors to show that, as in the days of Solomon and Marcus Aurelius, not only all is vanity, but that it is the great motive power of human action. To quote only one of his maxims: "If vanity were suddenly to vanish, the painter before his easel, the author over his manuscripts, and the warrior on his battle-steed, would all fall asleep. Like the Sleeping Beauty, only the kiss of vanity could awake them !" They must be read to be appreciated. He closes his work with the following remarks upon the in solvable problems of philosophy: "Has the world for ever existed? Incomprehensible thought. We cannot comprehend eternity. Has the world had a beginning? Also incomprehensible. We cannot comprehend the origin of something out of nothing. Man per ceives externally, forms, colors, etc. ; and internally, observing him self, he comprehends that he feels, imagines, wills. "But every attempt of the human race to break through the world of perception, ideas, in order to discover more or less clearly what lies behind, constantly miscarries; and the new discovery al ways turns out to be merely a new combination of old concepts. Man is not essentially different from the animal, as the latter also perceives, connects, and combines. It is true, it does not philoso phize. Man is the animal that philosophizes ; and he is precisely just wise enough to understand that he knows nothing."</page><page sequence="22">732 THE MONIST. As Dr. R e has no "system" to construct he does not deal with abstractions, which, as he says, are the ever prolific source of error. The unbiased reader may and probably will differ from many of his conclusions-it is always a disappointment to be forced at this late day, to agree with Socrates that we know nothing ;-but neverthe less, the epoch-making character of this book, and the honesty, fear lessness, and the logical acumen of its gifted author will be denied by no independent and reasonable thinker.
