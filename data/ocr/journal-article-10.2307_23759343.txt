The 1986 archaeological season at the Maya site of Edzná, Campeche, centered on the excavations of the long rectangular mound situated on the west side of the large plaza in front of the main acrópolis with its 5-story building. The now-visible remains reveal a stair way extending the entire length of the over 100 m long platform (Fig. 1), leading to two palace-type buildings on top, which are separated by a narrow opening. Each of the buildings has eleven entrances leading to a double row of rooms. The excavations, conducted under the direction of Raúl Pavón Abreo and Luis Millet, began again in March of this year. As was also the case last year, Guatemalan workmen from the refugee village of Quetzal Edzná are being em ployed. Special funds have now been provided by UNESCO so that specialist masons from Oxkutzcab, Yucatan, can train some of the Guatemalan refugees in the consolidation and reconstruction of archaeological buildings, a profession which will also come in useful if they return to their home country (see Mexicon 9:54). vm:} s£f $0* — &gt; *?' : «i(i Palace stairs and entrances, viewed from the south (photo graph H.J.Prem, March 1987) Rediscovered fragment from Stela 1, Jim bal, Guatemala GRAZ (K. H. Mayer). In May 1965 two Guatemalan employ ées of the Tikal Project of the University Museum, University of Pennsylvania at Philadelphia, discovered a small Maya site about 12.5 km north of the center of Tikal, in the Petén of Guatemala. In the large plaza of this site, later named Jimbai, a carved stela was found still upright and in excellent condition, on the front of which 42 glyphs and the portrayal of a Maya ruler with two anthropomorphic figures "float ing" above him are displayed. This Late Classic limestone | monument, designated Jimbai Stela 1, measures 226 cm high, 143 cm wide, and 40 cm thick and features an unusual inscription with square-cartouched glyphs. In June 1965 the stela was photographed and drawn in situ, and in 1967 a latex mold was made. Three years later, on her arrivai in Jimbai for the purpose of making a rubbing, Merle Greene Robertson discovered that, at some point prior to July 1970, looters had eut off the upper third of the front with a power saw and removed it from the site. In 1972 she published a photo of the badly mutilated stela ("Monument Thievery in Mesoamerica", American Antiquity, Vol. 37, No.2, p. 152, Fig. 5) and a rubbing of the surviving relief (Merle Greene, Robert L. Rands, and John A. Graham: "Maya Sculptures from the Southern Lowlands, Highlands and Pacific Piedmont", Berkeley, 1972, PI. 148). Robertson suspected that the sawn-off upper section of the relief had been broken into at least two pieces and that the stolen fragments would undoubtedly appear soon on the interna tional art market. The missing stones did not surface, how ever. A photograph of the damaged stela, accompanied by a</page><page sequence="2">Fig. 1 : Jimbai Stela 1. Drawing by W. R.

Fig. 2: Jimbai Stela 1 following mutilation. Photograph by Karl H. Mayer (1976). In order to prevent further déprédation, the monument was transferred to Tikal (Fig. 2) and years later to the Museo Nacional de Arqueología y Etnología in Guatemala City, where it is now housed. In February 1987, 17 years after its disappearance, the missing upper section of Jimbal Stela 1 (Fig. 3) was rediscovered by Karl Herbert Mayer while photographing Maya carved stone fragments in the store rooms of the camp of the Guatemalan Tikal Project. Accord ing to information contained in the Project's "Laboratorio" files, this 36 cm high, 52 cm wide, and 7 cm thick fragment (Cat. No. PNYE-023) was considered to be of unknown provenance; it had been found by archaeologists near Group F at Uaxactun, presumably abandoned by looters, and brought to the Tikal camp for safe keeping. It is proposed that the recently identified fragment be transponed to Guatemala City for restoration to the mutilated stela. Fig. 3: The newly identified stela fragment. Photograph by Karl H.

The St. Louis Art Museum disclosed in April that at least three works of art in their Morton D. May Collection, and perhaps even more, are forgeries. Three pieces at the Dallas Museum of Art have also been exposed as forgeries, and a further piece at the Metro politan Museum in New York is suspect. The alleged forger, Brígido Lara, an artist and muséum employée in Jalapa, Mexico, Claims all these pieces as his original work, and scientific tests have now proven them to be of recent fabrication, although they had been published and scrutinized many years ago. Most of the forgeries or suspect pieces are nearly lifesize ceramic figurines, or frag ments of such, thought to have been of Late Classic origin and from the State of Veracruz. The Dallas and St. Louis muséums are said to be planning a symposium to discuss the implications of these discoveries, and perhaps to invite M. Brígido Lara to discuss his technique and help identify other works that he had created. Founded: SOHIME - The Society of Mexi canist Historians HAMBURG (AHILA).
