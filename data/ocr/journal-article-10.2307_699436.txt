<plain_text><page sequence="1">GOD IN GREEK PHILOSOPHY. God in Greek Philosophy to the Time of Socrates. By RoY KENNETH HACK, B.Litt. (Oxon.). Pp. x + 16o. Prince- ton University Press (London: Milford), 1931. Cloth, 13s. 6d. THIS is a stimulating re-examination of the central problem in pre-Socratic philosophy. The interest shown by Plato and Aristotle in 'divine reality' and the 'succession of the doctrines' of the pre-Socratic philosophers them- selves become intelligible, it is claimed, only if the latter were not 'attempting first of all to found natural science' but rather 'to improve the definition of the nature of the supreme divine power.' 'The continuity of Greek thought about the supreme god was never really broken' (p. vi.). Con- tinuity there undoubtedly was, but not quite of the kind suggested by Pro- fessor Hack. For Homer and Hesiod the supreme god was Zeus; Ouranos and Gaia, Okeanos, Chaos, etc., who for Professor Hack are 'the highest powers . . . which represent the divine universe,' were parents of the ruling powers, and there was no single deity immanent throughout the universe. Nor does the evidence warrant his speaking of water as 'the god of Thales,' 'the supreme god and the cosmogenetic god' (p. 42), or of the a7retpov of Anaximander as 'this Infinite and Indeterminate god,' 'his supreme god' (p. 43 f.). The book opens with a discussion of Homer's gods and the meaning of the word lOes. With much that is wise and well expressed this portion con- tains some hard sayings. Because Homer sometimes attributes responsi- bility to an unnamed Oeo6, it is inferred that in such cases O8e, did not refer to a personal being. But the natural ex- planation is merely that on such occa- sions one did not know which god was responsible. Professor Hack's opinion is buttressed by such arguments as 'Perhaps the clearest proof of the tendency of Oe0d' to be impersonal is the fact that the vocative was never used until a late period. On the other hand the Greeks could and did pray to the Oeot as a collective body of divine powers' (p. 8). But in polytheism, as opposed to monotheism, it is natural to address a single deity, whose attention is desired, by his own 'proper name' and, if it were not, lack of instances of the vocative singular is no proof that a word signifies something impersonal. One may also, perhaps, be forgiven incredulity when the anthropomor- phism of Homer's gods is explained as a consequence of the honouring of Mycenaeans as heroes and the desire to affiliate them to greater powers. 'The anthropomorphism of these gods is essentially the price that Greek religion paid for hero-worship and the consequent attempt to re- late certain gods to men' (p. 19, cf. p. 35). The systematic theology of Hesiod is on the whole fairly treated, but Mazon's suggestion that 'behind the myth of the mutilation of Ouranos, which puts an end to his disordered fertility, and the myth of the birth of Aphrodite, there lies the idea of the fixity of species; " perhaps the Platonic theory of Ideas is only a refined trans- lation of the very simple sentiment that animated the unknown inventor of this myth"' is quoted with ap- proval and the comment 'How great is the real difference between the thought of Hesiod and the thought of Homer ?' (p. 24). After a glance at the mystery re- ligions the book proceeds to the 'pre- Socratic' views of the primary sub- stance or, as Professor Hack urges, of 'the supreme god,' ' the supreme divine</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 181 power .. now expressly identified with the cosmogenetic divine sub- stance.' This matter of divinity apart, the discussion is fresh and illuminating. It will give even a Greekless reader a clear and on the whole sound under- standing of these systems. Each is shown in relation to its background as a criticism of and attempt to improve upon earlier solutions of the problem. There are some points on which one may not accept Professor Hack's use of evidence; e.g., the Pythagorean views quoted by Diogenes Laertius (VIII. 24 ff.) from Alexander Polyhistor are obviously late and not, as is implied (p. 53), evidence for Pythagoras him- self. It is an anachronism to speak of the brain as the organ of mind for Xenophanes (p. 64), and one may doubt whether for Heraclitus (B 45 Diels) 'the Psyche which has no limits is of course the Mind and Soul of the universe' (p. 77). It is going too far to say, of Empedocles' doctrine, that ' Strife is a causal power that can fairly be identified with the Devil' (p. 102), and it is not true that with his Love and Strife alongside of Fire, Water, Earth and Air, 'for the first time in the history of Greek thought, two distinct classes of ultimate divine reality have been established. Love and Strife are just as real as the other four great gods but they are endowed with a specialized causal function' (p. Ioo). Already for Homer beside Hephaistos, Gaia, etc., there were Ares, Aphrodite, Eris, etc. There is appended a bibliography, also an index of names and another of subjects, brief but adequate. R. B.
