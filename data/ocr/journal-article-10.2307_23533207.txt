It is clear, however, that Black Elk referred spe cifically to the Black Hills as the center or heart of the earth and to Harney Peak as the center of that center.35 Bear Lodge Butte (Devils Tower) (Fig. 4). Bad Heart Bull shows a feature in the Black Hills that unmistakably represents Devils Tower, despite a somewhat distorted geo graphic placement. I have used the name for this feature, the Bear Lodge, that was used in common by Lakotas, Cheyennes, Arikaras, Arapahos, and Crows.36 This name is indi cated pictographically on the Bad Heart Bull map by showing a bear's face at the base of the butte and is preserved in the adjacent portion of the Black Hills, known as the Bear Lodge Range. The name refers to an old myth, widely told on the northern Plains, about the for mation of both Bear Lodge Butte and the Black Hills. As a girl and seven brother help ers attempt to escape from a monstrous bear, the Black Hills rise up as a barrier between them and their pursuer. The Bear's Lodge is formed when the girl and her seven helpers pray to the rock to rise up and save them from the bear. From the top of the towering rock, the people rise up to the sky to dwell there as the stars of the Big Dipper or Pleiades. (See discussion of Kiowa and Kiowa-Apache tradi tional beliefs, below.) Few historic Lakota versions of this story were recorded. One version, collected both historically and recently, refers to two boys, who are set upon by a great bear and run to the rock for refuge. The butte is formed as the rock rises up carrying the boys to safety. In another version, collected in 1933, the young est of seven brothers goes to rescue his sister in-law from the leader of a den of monster bears. All eight escape by praying to a rock that rises to become Bear Lodge Butte.37 Un like the Kiowa, Cheyenne, Arikara, and Arapaho versions of the story, the older Lakota texts do not associate the feature with the Big Dipper or the Pleiades. The Lakotas did make a connection between Bear Lodge Butte and stars—one of their principal constella tions was known as Mato Tipila or the Bear Lodge.38 In this case, it represents the butte itself, not the people who escaped from the great bear. In addition to its mythological significance, some Lakotas believed Bear Lodge Butte to be an earth center (see discussion of Harney Peak) and the place from which the Great Spirit scattered game animals to provide food for them.39 Some Lakotas today associate Bear Lodge Butte with their Sacred Calf Pipe,40 but I could find no written historical precedent for this belief.</page><page sequence="9">THE SACRED BLACK HILLS 193 FIG. 5.

When Lakotas asserted in the 1970s, with seeming suddenness, that the Black Hills were sacred ground, they were responding to the federal government's equally sudden policy that sacredness was relevant to their claims on the area. The rise of interest in Native American religious rights in the 1970s was to culminate in passage of the American Indian Religious Freedom Act in 1978. Public atti tudes were changing rapidly. Instead of asking why the Lakotas were claiming sacred status for the Black Hills in the 1970s, we might more productively ask how the conventional wisdom of the 1870s—that the Black Hills were the Lakotas' holy land—came to be dis puted in the 1970s. The answer seems to lie in the sudden relevance of sacredness to land claims disputes. The Black Hills have increas ingly become a symbol of Native American resistance to acculturation, and because of this symbolic role, they are today sacred in ways that they historically were not. This does not, however, mean that the area had no religious significance in the past. We may never know for certain the degree to which the Black Hills were considered sa cred ground by their past inhabitants. At least portions of the area were sacred to many groups at many times. The presence of about a hun dred rock art sites in the Black Hills, many illustrating recognizably religious themes and some dating back thousands of years, suggests that the area has had considerable religious significance for much, if not all, of its human history.132 The current religious revitalization movement among Lakota and Cheyenne people is as much a rediscovery as a reinven tion of traditional beliefs, including beliefs about the Black Hills.
