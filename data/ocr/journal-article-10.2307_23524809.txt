<plain_text><page sequence="1">ABRAHAM HESCHEL AND HIS CRITICS Sol Tanenzapf Toronto The dominant concepts of Abraham Heschel's philosophy of Judaism have not been subjected to sustained and probing philosophical analysis. This is largely due to the fact that Heschel is not taken seriously as a philosopher either by his critics or by his adherents. This is so, although he thought of himself as primarily a philosopher: he subtitled Man is not Alone "a philosophy of religion" and God in Search of Man, "a philosophy of Judaism". One reason for this anomaly is Heschel's insistence on the limits of rational discourse and the impossibility of demonstrating the basic affirmations of Judaism. Indeed, Heschel's stress on the Ineffable, referring at times to the indescribable qualities of our profoundest experiences, at other times to the divine dimension of reality and at still other times to the sense within us that intuits the divine dimension, has led many readers to question whether he is doing philosophy at all. Another reason undoubtedly is that Heschel's style of writing is not discursive or argumentative, but aphoristic and epigrammatic, even lyrical. It is assumed by critics and followers alike that either one writes philosophy or one writes poetry, that any writing that appeals to the emotions cannot claim truth and cannot be examined rationally. Accord ing to Petuchowski, what emerges from Heschel's writings is not a philo sophy of Judaism, "but a feeling, a mood, powerful enough to carry us with it and heighten our religious sensitivity"1. Arthur Cohen calls Heschel "a rhetorician of faith", whose eloquent descriptions of the pious life have become a substitute for theological argument.2 Marvin Fox thinks that Heschel's style is indeed suited to his purposes, since his aim is not philosophic but kerygmatic that is, to proclaim his insights forcefully and to get his readers to share his vision3. Emil Fackenheim, on the other hand, attempts to defend Heschel against the objections of critics, but does so by making Heschel imper vious to philosophical analysis. Heschel, he asserts, is engaged in devotional writing, in confessional religious thinking, whereas Heschel's 1. J.

Fox, "Heschel's Theology of Man", Tradition, 8 (Fall, 1966), pp. 80-81.</page><page sequence="2">134 SOL TANENZAPF critics misunderstand him to be engaged in reflective thinking about religion. Heschel's writing is based on his religious commitments, but the task of the philosopher is to examine those commitments, to show why one should enter into one religious commitment rather than another4. Two writers have sought to defend Heschel's philosophic credentials. Fritz Rothschild asserts that in addition to descriptions of religious experiences and the life of piety, and phenomenological analyses of those experiences, there is in Heschel's writings a philosophical approach. Although Heschel does not present reasoned arguments for the truths of Judaism, he does attempt to show how the teachings of Judaism are relevant to the problems of thoughtful and sensitive persons and how they deepen our understanding and appreciation of the human situation5. Edmond Cherbonnier's reply to Heschel's critics is, I think, the most successful. Heschel's major claim is that implicit in biblical literature is a coherent philosophical world-view; Heschel's achievement is to make the biblical world-view explicit and to examine the implications of that world-view for religious thought. The biblical conception of the world as formulated by Heschel is open to philosophical criticism and poses a significant alternative to secular Humanism. Heschel is not an irrational ist: he does not disparage human reason as such, but he does reject traditional Rationalism because its main tenets are inconsistent with the biblical vision of reality6. Cherbonnier's reading of Heschel is, I think, essentiafly correct. And his suggestion that Heschel's more poetic utterances can be transposed into prose and then examined, is well taken. A prosaic restatement of Heschel's main themes would, it is hoped, gain in clarity what is lost in emotional force and aesthetic value. According to Heschel, all knowledge of God must come through God's self-disclosure; what we know of God is what God has made known to us. Speculative reason cannot by itself find God; the unaided intellect has not been able to demonstrate with certainty its conc'usion about the nature of God and the universe. But man is not lost: God is 4. E. Fackenheim, "God in search of Man," (review), Conservative Judaism, 15 (Fall, 1960), pp. 50-53. 5. F.

God is revealed in the awesome and sublime aspects of our experience of the natural and human world, in the prophetic understanding of the events of Israel's history, and in certain moments in the religious life — in worship, in doing Mitzvot and in learning. Man's task is to respond to God's address to him and to live in a way that is worthy of God's concern. His awareness of the divine presence depends primarily on God's initiative, but it requires also a trusting response on man's part. Consequently, Heschel's only recourse is to formulate clearly the biblical conception of reality and to make explicit its assumptions and its implications; he must do the same for all other metaphysical inter pretations of reality, and then confront his reader with the necessity of deciding between them. Given Heschel's epistemological starting point, no reasons which would be universally recognized as binding can be given to justify one decision or the other. Juxtaposing as he does the conflicting claims of competing world views, without giving reasons for preferring one to another, does leave Heschel open to the charges of dogmatism and irrationalism. It is my own view that the biblical world-view both requires and admits of rational justification. Religious beliefs, considered as such, apart from the whole way of life we know as "being religious", are logically of the type of metaphysical beliefs or world-views; they have more or less evidential support depending on their adequacy to explain the facts of experience coherently and consistent with what else we know from other disciplines. The fact that evaluative judgments are made in assessing the strength of the evidential support does not distinguish a theistic inter pretation of the world from explanations in other disciples enough to warrant our denying them the status of rational arguments. I do not dispute the basic Jewish affirmation that the beliefs which together constitute the biblical world-view originate in revelatory experiences or in the inspired interpretations of sacred texts. My conten tion is that their origin in the revelatory experiences of prophets and in the less unusual experiences of ordinary believers, which Heschel has so vividly described, does not exempt them from rational criticism. Heschel's sometimes too cavalier denial of the need for reasoned argu ment in support of the main tenets of Jewish belief is in my opinion a serious weakness in his position, but one that is not irremediable. It is left to his supporters to do what he did not do, indeed to do what he did not see the need for doing. His rejection of all attempts at philosophic justification is too wholesale: it is not philosophic reason that teaches</page><page sequence="4">136 SOL TANENZAPF views of God and man which are incompatible with the biblical view, but particular philosophies. He did not consider whether there are metaphysical systems that would permit him to formulate without distortion his understanding of the biblical vision of reality and in turn provide some evidential support for it. It is my opinion that Whitehead's philosophy as developed by Charles Hartshorne and others would allow him to do just that. Moreover, I think that what rational justification there is for religious belief is very weak indeed; the evidence is ambiguous and men of un doubted intelligence and good will interpret it diversely. Uncertainty, it would seem, is the only attitude that can justifiably be taken towards our religious beliefs. Heschel is mistaken then in claiming more certainty than he is entitled to. Revelatory experiences are not self-authenticating: like our experiences of the sensory and human world, they admit of diverse — indeed, mutually exclusive — interpretations. Heschel acknow ledges this: the false prophet after all is one who mistakes a subjective experience for an authentic revelation. But he does not give us adequate reasons to support his claim that the experiences of the prophets are cognitive and not just a subjective feeling or a mental aberration. Heschel repeatedly makes the point that the prophets understood their experiences to be genuine encounters with Gcd and that all we have to go on is what they said happened. Yet, Heschel dees not explain why we should trust in the prophet's self-understanding. Surely reasons must be given both to persuade the secularist and to justify the convictions of the believer. Heschel's anti-rationalism has caused him to lose sight of the need for philosophic argument and to overlook one well-founded lesson to be learnt from philosophic inquiry into religious belief, viz., that there is little justification for dogmatic assertiveness. Several critics have noted, with justification, I think, that Heschel often exhibits a lack of sympa thetic understanding for the plight of the unbeliever7. These considerations point up serious weaknesses in Heschel's position, but they should not divert our attention from Heschel's important contribution to philosophic inquiry: his explication of fundamental biblical concepts and his formulation of the biblical world-view. Before we can assess a world-view and test its adequacy to explain the world we know, we must be clear that its fundamental concepts are neither absurd nor empty and that the system formed by these concepts is coherent. 7. Cohen, op. cit., pp. 252-3; Eugene Borowitz, A New Jewish Theology in the Making, (Philadelphia: Westminster Press, 1968), pp. 172-3.</page><page sequence="5">HESCHEL AND HIS CRITICS 137 At the center of Heschel's formulation of the biblical world-view is the concept of divine pathos. Jewish philosophers have on the whole ignored this concept primarily because it was incompatible with their philosophic assumptions. Heschel's contention is that these systems are on non-biblical categories of thought and that biblical categories have a claim to be considered in their own right, since they form a coherent pattern on a par with other metaphysical systems. He is formulating a world-view in terms of authentically biblical concepts, rather than explaining biblical concepts in terms of non-biblical systems of thought. It is noteworthy that the critic who does take Heschel seriously as a philosopher, Eliezer Berkovits, launches a scathing attack on precisely this concept of divine pathos8. It is my opinion, however, that Berkovits' objections are not decisive and that concept of divine pathos is capable of precise definition and rational defense. In offering such a defense, I am, of course, going beyond the limits set by Heschel's own theory of knowledge. Berkovits' analysis focuses on The Prophets and examines two main topics: the theology of pathos and the religion of sympathy. On the theology of pathos Heschel writes, "Whatever man does affects not only his own life, but also the life of God insofar as it is directed to man"0. God "does not simply command and expect obedience; He is also moved and affected by what happens in the world and reacts accordingly. Events and human actions arouse in Him joy or sorrow, pleasure or wrath"10. In a word, God is personal; and what can be said about the human person can appropriately be said about God. HescheJ contends that it is a mystery, which cannot be grasped rationally, why the trans cendent God should be affected emotionally by the conduct of men, but this is precisely what the prophets proclaim11. Prophetic religion then is a religion of sympathy. The prophet does not come to know God by any process of reasoning; he knows God by confronting the divine presence. The reality of God is experienced by the prophet as God's concern for man. The prophet is not aware of the divine pathos intellectually; instead he identifies with it in sympathetic imagination. Indeed, the prophet feels what God feels12. Heschel is 8. E. Berkovits, "Dr. A.J. HescheFs Theology of Pathos", Tradition, 6 (Spring, 1964), pp. 67-104. 9. A.

Ibid., pp. 308-311.</page><page sequence="6">138 SOL TANENZAPF careful to distinguish prophecy from mysticism: the prophet retains his individual identity; there is no mystical union or loss of self in the prophetic experience. The prophet achieves not identity with God, but sympathy for what is happening in the life of God13. Berkovits accepts without demur some themes in Heschel's account of the prophetic conception of God: God is personal and He is concerned about man. "These are," he writes, "familiar thoughts, well understood by all who have some knowledge of biblical theology or religious philoso phy"14. What he objects to in the theology of pathos is Heschel's claim that God is not only concerned about man, He is also affected by man and responds to him emotionally. Heschel, he thinks, is profoundly mistaken in ascribing to God emotions of love and anger, joy and sorrow, and in describing the prophets as sharing in the emotional life of God. Berkovits characterises Heschel as a biblical literalist who has ignored the long history of Jewish philosophy and its wrestling with the problems of divine attributes and biblical anthropomorphism13. This contention is surely unfair. Heschel's sensitivity to poetic uses of words prevents him from being a literalist. He has insisted repeatedly in numerous contexts that biblical language is not descriptive, but indicative: descriptive words have conventional and definite meanings, whereas indicative words intimate meanings that cannot be fully articu lated. Biblical language does not communicate information about the divine reality; it evokes within us a capacity to respond to the divine presence. The prophet's words are not intended to describe in terms of meanings that are already familiar to us, but to bring us into new ways of looking at reality. In a memorable passage, Heschel declares that the prophets' statements about God are understatements. By deliberately using inadequate language, the prophet drives us beyond all words to an immediately-experienced sense of God's aliveness and His over whelming concern16. Heschel argues that language is in no danger of being taken literally, since biblical authors are aware of the uniqueness and transcendence of God and do not attempt to describe God's nature in itself, but His relationships to man and the world. Thus, the use of anthropomorphic expressions in the Bible differs significantly from their use in pagan, 13. Ibid., pp. 257-8. 14. Berkovits, op. cit., p. 68. 15. Ibid., p. 70. 16. Heschel, God in Search of Man (New York: Farrar, Straus and Cudahy, 1955), pp. 178-183.</page><page sequence="7">HESCHEL AND HIS CRITICS 139 especially Greek religious literature. Moreover, the problem with which the Greek philosophers had to deal is no problem for the prophets: divine expressions of emotion are not arbitrary and capricious, but ethically determined17. Berkovits does not think that Heschel has solved the problem of anthropomorphism and presents a series of arguments to show that the concept of divine pathos is filled with inconsistencies. If Berkovits is right, and the concept of divine pathos is incoherent, then this to my mind counts decisively against any claim to truth that can be made for the biblical conception of reality as delineated by Heschel. Berkovits' critique of the theology of pathos is largely based on Maimonidean assumptions; his arguments are set out with clarity of expression and logical preciseness. I. There is, he reasons, an absolute distinction between Infinite and finite; all our concepts are derived from finite experience and, strictly speaking, have no relevance to God. Therefore, we are left with a dilem ma: we either associate some positive meaning with the words we use of God and thereby ascribe finite qualities that are irrelevant to God, or we are using words without meaningful positive content18. This argument is intended to explain why one cannot ascribe to God emotions such as love and anger. What is puzzling is that Berkovits does acknowledge that God is personal and is concerned with men. But what does it mean to be concerned for another if you are not affected by the other person ? If I say that I care for this person, but I do not share her joys and sorrows, that I am unaffected both by the happy and sad occasions in her lifes one would rightly wonder whether I am concerned, whether I really did care for her. Caring destroys independence and self sufficiency; to love is to be vulnerable, to be open to and influenced by the one loved. Berkovits' contention that God cares for man, but is not affected by what man does, strikes me as not simply incompatible with the plain meaning of the text, but as logically self-contradictory. The opposite of caring is not hatred, but indifference. If Berkovits is objecting to the use of analogies and metaphors drawn from human relationships in thinking about God, then how can he say that God is concerned about man? Indeed, how can he say anything at all about God? If God is so entirely different from human personality, then no analogues at all are appropriate. What follows is theological silence, which is a respectable 17. Heschel, The Prophets, pp. 268-278. 18. Berkovits, op. cit., p. 72.</page><page sequence="8">140 SOL TANENZAPF position, often advanced, but seldom adhered to. What does not follow is blanket permission to say whatever one wants, even the logically absurd. Berkovits proposes to solve the problem by the use of Midrash, exegetical interpretations that permit one to acknowledge the plain meaning of the biblical text, without having to assent to all the philoso phic implications of that plain meaning. This is a traditional solution to the problems arising from biblical passages which are either philosophi cally questionable or morally objectionable. But Berkovits does not give us a midrashic interpretation that would meet these specific diffi culties. Speaking generally, I doubt whether Midrash would work for us as it did for the Tannaim and Amoraim, for we are aware, as they seem not to have been, that ideas have a history, that the meanings of words are not independent of their intellectual and cultural context. Midrashim are in some respects more like poetry than like philosophy; they have many levels of meaning, some more manifest than others. In this they are like the biblical passages whose meanings they explicate. But surely the task of the Jewish philosopher is to formulate and to examine the conceptual content of those midrashim. To resort to midrashic thinking is no solution to philosophic problems; it is rather an abrogation of the philosophic task. II. A second important argument presented by Berkovits is also Maimonidean. God could not be affected from without, nor could He be moved by emotions, for if God is completely actual and perfect, change in the mind of God is inconceivable. A perfect being cannot change for the better, since he is already perfect; and to change for the worse would be inconsistent with his perfection. But Heschel describes revelation as an event that occurs in God before it can be experienced by the prophet, as "an ecstasy of God". To talk as Heschel does of revelation as a moment in the life of God, when He decides to turn towards man, to make known what was previously concealed is to say that God undergoes change. But a perfect being is unchangeable1^ Anticipating such objections, Heschel points out, quite correctly, that perfection, absoluteness, and infinity are not attributes of God in the Bible. Berkovits has to acknowledge this, but goes on to argue that perfection and absoluteness are implied by the biblical conception of God's transcendence. I doubt, however, that perfection in the sense of complete actuality and immutability is even consistent with the Bible's 19. Ibid., pp. 77-78.</page><page sequence="9">HESCHEL AND HIS CRITICS 141 view that God, Who transcends the world He created, is nonetheless actively involved in the events of human history. Heschel's reply then is that perfection and absoluteness are Greek categories, which ever since Philo Jewish thinkers have been trying to reconcile with the biblical understanding of God and doing so rather badly. Furthermore, Heschel contends, the Greeks disparaged the emotions in man, and if it is deplorable for man to feel emotions, it surely must be so for God. But in the Bible there is no depreciation of the emotional life of man nor any hesitancy to ascribe emotions to God. The emotions as well as the intellect have their seat in the heart; indeed, both are necessary if we are to know other persons. If God is to know us concretely as individuals and not in some general way as part of the universal concept "humanity", then God must become aware of us emotionally20. Berkovits agrees that God knows the human individual and not just humanity; so, he reasons as follows: It is inconceivable that God should feel emotions, but it is the case that God knows men as concrete facts and not as abstractions. Yet, to know another person concretely, one must be aware of him emotionally. Therefore, God's knowledge and concern for man is incomprehensible21. Berkovits' answer is to appeal to mystery a step earlier in the argument; after all, Heschel must concede in the end that it is a mystery why the transcendent God should be affected by us. Berkovits thinks that his position is preferable to Heschel's since it does not diminish, as Heschel's position does, the absolute difference between God and man. Berkovits writes: "For Dr. Heschel commits the unforgivable fallacy that he equates the human way of realizing a fellow man as a concrete fact with the way of God"22. In my opinion, Berkovits' contention is as unsatisfactory as Heschel's; in reply, I would say of Berkovits what he has said of Heschel: "to call something mystery and a paradox is no theology either"23. III. Berkovits examines Heschel's distinction between God's being and God's actions and relations to His creatures (Heschel does not want to say that God in His Being is affected by man) and concludes that the distinction will not stand up, since what God says and does results from what God is. In Heschel's theology, on the other hand, the two aspects of the divine reality, its true Being and its attitudes and acts, remain unrelated to each other. Heschel's position in the end approaches dual 20. The Prophets, p. 257. 21. Berkovits, op. cit., pp. 81-82. 22. Ibid. 23. Ibid., p. 80.</page><page sequence="10">142 SOL TANENZAPF ism; he seems to talk as though there were two gods: one is inaccessible, wrapped in mystery, perfect and immutable; the other, comprehensible, related to man, loving and caring24. This objection is very much to the point: Heschel's writing is not precise and is open to such misinterpretation. However, the dominant position emerges clearly enough. It is left to Heschel's expositors to add logical preciseness; the burden of this paper is that this can be done while still remaining faithful to Heschel's insights. IV. Berkovits' fourth argument is one that at first sight I was inclined to dismiss out of hand. To talk of God feeling sorrow and of suffering with man, and of prophetic religion as empathy with God's suffering, is Christian and an outrage to Jewish sensibilities. This looks like an ad hominem argument, but on reflection there seemed to me a valid point to the argument. The life of Jewish piety is after all part of the data with which a Jewish theologian must work; his job is to give an account of not only the thinking of the Jew, but the religious experiences of the Jew. If this is not part of the religious experiences of the Jew, then there is a problem here for Heschel. But to simply say, as Berkovits does, that Heschel's conception of a religion of sympathy is Christian, that it humanizes God, that a man-like God inevitably leads to a God-like man, is not enough. That Heschel's formulation has parallels in Christian thought is obvious. But it is to be hoped that Jewish thinkers are secure enough in their commitments to Judaism that they can re-examine those aspects of Judaism which have been given special emphasis in Chris tianity. The idea of the Suffering Servant is an important resolution of the problems of pain and evil, but because it is so fundamental to Chris tian belief, Jews tend to overlook it and an important theme is lost to Jewish philosophic thinking. 1 do, however, think that idea of God's sorrow, His sharing the suf fering of man is part of Jewish religious experience, although it has not been normative. As Berkovits himself notes, in addition to the explicit claims of the prophets, there are midrashic, kabbalistic and hassidic texts that seem to convey this notion. Berkovits' rejoinder is that sorrow is usually attributed to the shekhitiah or to the lower worlds of the sephirot, not to God himself, that in rabbinic midrash references to God's anguish and grief are usually accompanied by the disclaimer "as it were" (כבייבל — k'veyahol). Indeed, that is usually the case, but not always. For example, the practice of rising during the night to 24. Ibid., p. 101.</page><page sequence="11">HESCHEL AND HIS CRITICS 143 perform the midnight service (תיקון חצות — tekun hazot) is justified in the sources by reference to a talmudic passage which describes (without disclaimer) God's anger and grief at the destruction of the Temple, — Berahot 3a25. If perfection and immutability are the major categories of Greek thinking about God, then what are the major categories of Jewish thinking? According to Heschel, they are implicit in the idea of unity, God's Oneness. The affirmation that God is One means, among much else, that God is unique and supreme, unlike anything else in the universe and, therefore, alone worthy of our worship. Because He cannot be compared to anything else, we are filled with wonder, amazement and a sense of mystery in His presence26. The great Jewish philosophers of the Middle Ages, I think, used the concepts of perfection, absoluteness, infinity and immutability to account for why the pious Jew believed that only God deserved our whole hearted devotion. To convey a sense of God's unique excellence, His incomparable reality and goodness, they posited an absolute difference between God and man. God, they held, is infinite, perfect, unchangeable, necessary and eternal, totally unlike man whose life is ephemeral, limited, unstable and who depends on causes outside himself for his continued existence. The point at issue then is whether we can explain God's worshipfulness, His uniqueness and unsurpassability, without having to resort to non-biblical concepts such as perfection and im mutability. The weakness in Berkovits' solution is that, in his view, God is so totally different from men that He is incomprehensible. And I am always worried by Hume's question: What is the difference between a God Who is thoroughly incomprehensible and mysterious and no God at all? Moreover, he leaves himself open to the positivist's objection that the concept of God is self-contradictory and therefore meaningless. For Berkovits continues to use ordinary predicates such as concern and knowledge of a being whose nature is absolutely perfect and to whom they cannot apply. A much more cogent solution to these problems is to be found in the new theology being developed by Charles Hartshorne and others within the framework of a Whiteheadian metaphysic. Whitehead's philosophy, 25. Shulfian A ruh, Orah Hayyim, 1, 2. 26. Heschel, Man is Not Alone (New Yoek: Farrar, Straus and Young, 1951), pp. 111-123.</page><page sequence="12">144 SOL TANENZABF I think, has both coherence and explanatory power; it can account adequately for new developments in the natural and behavioral sciences and, because its major categories are temporal and personal, is compa tible with the biblical world-view. Hartshorne reasons that God could not conceivably be surpassed by another being either ontologically or axiologically; if God were surpassed by a greater or better being, then we should worship the one who surpas sed him. But why cannot God be said to live and grow and surpass Himself ? If it is assumed that God is complete actuality or static perfec tion, then of course He could not surpass himself; what is complete and perfect cannot change. However, if change is a pervasive feature of reality and if growth and novelty are real values, then change need not be denied of God. Indeed, since change leading to growth and self-transcendence are real values, and immutable being would have less value than men; and since men would have surpassed it in value it would not be worship fill. Similarly, it is argued that God must be concerned for others or He would be surpassed by human beings who are capable of concern. And God's concern or love, like man's, must be incomplete and mutable, since love should be responsive to the needs of the other which are changing from moment to moment27. Moreover, if God were not capable of self-surpassing, creatures could not contribute anything to his inner life or mean anything to him; there would then be no point to our worship of God. On this view, God is not absolutely perfect in all respects. He is absolutely perfect in His Being, since He is not dependent on anything else for His continued existence; but He is only relatively perfect in other respects, e.g., God does depend on others for His joy and happiness. Nevertheless, He alone is worthy of our devotion because although He can surpass an earlier state of Himself, no other being can surpass Him in reality or in value. And on this view, to say that God's goodness is unsurpassably great is to say that God acts with concern for all the interests affected by his actions. Should human beings improve in good ness and increase their happiness, then God will rejoice and gain in satisfaction. It means too that God suffers with us, that He is not indif ferent to the pain He cannot prevent. This is implicit in the notion that 27. C. Hartshorne, A Natural Theology for Our Time (La Salle, Illinois: Open Court, 1967), esp. pp. 15-19; see also his The Logic of Perfection (La Salle: Open Court).</page><page sequence="13">HESCHEL AND HIS CRITICS 145 God is the all-inclusive reality, imminent in the universe as well as transcendent. This is implicit too in the message of the prophets: God feels anguish for the suffering of a people whom He loves, but who have cast Him off. Thus, Heschel's understanding of the Biblical world-view raises important philosophic issues. Indeed, it calls into question some funda mental presuppositions of Jewish philosophic thought. His concept of divine pathos points toward a tenable resolution of the problem of pain and evil. For these reasons, therefore, his work deserves and requires, the serious attention of philosophers.</page></plain_text>
