Stephen F Austin State University East Texas Research Center SFA Station Box 13055 Nacogdoches, 7X 75962 Texas Forestry Association, 1936-1993, 42 boxes. The Texas Forestry Association was organized in 1914 in Temple, Texas. The leading figure was Mr. W. Goodrich Jones who served as president for the following seven years. The principal objec- tives were to create an awareness on the part of the public and the importance of forests in the over-all economy of Texas, bring about the practice of forest conserva- tion by timber landowners and forest products operators, and support the establish- ment of a state regulated Texas Forest Service (which was established in 1915). Annual meetings, committee files, special programs as Tree Farm and Texas Refor- estation, Project Learning Tree, as well as special media files make up the bulk of the collection. North Carolina State University Libraries Special Collections Raleigh, NC 27607 North Carolina Rail-Trails, 1987-1999, .5 linear feet. North Carolina Rail-Trails, a volunteer organization supported by dues, gifts, and grants, began as a steering committee at the North Carolina Greenways Conference in Charlotte on June 3, 1988. North Carolina Rail-Trails (NCRT), headquartered in Durham, became in- corporated on March 12, 1990. NCRT was a charter member of the North Carolina Center for Nonprofits and the Environmental Federation of North Carolina, a Durham-based organization that endeavors to both protect and preserve the state's natural resources. NCRT's purpose is threefold: to monitor the state's rail system, to pursue corridor preservation, and to both retrieve and convert rail corridors to public trails. NCRT coordinates projects among local, state, and federal agencies and organizations. Beginning in 1989 NCRT published a quarterly newsletter called</page><page sequence="30">610 Environmental History "Little Toot." NCRT, along with the North Carolina Railroad Company, Friends of the State Parks, and the North Carolina Sierra Club Chapter, introduced railbanking legislation through the State Rails Council, legislative research com- mittees, and the North Carolina General Assembly. The collection consists of organizational records and reference material created or used by the organization to facilitate its operation. The bulk of the collection consists of correspondence, NCRT meeting minutes and agendas, brochures, flyers, several newsletters, including "Little Toot," newspaper and magazine articles, es- says for "Little Toot" by Anthony Reevy, past historian and vice chair of NCRT, work plans, proposals, maps, essays on North Carolina rail-trails and railways, legal documents, and copies of ratified senate and house bills.

The founder of the firm, Henry P. M. Birkinbine oper- ated a forge and auger works near Reading, Pennsylvania, in the mid-nineteenth century. He later served as chief engineer of the Philadelphia Water Department. His son John followed his father in the family business, specializing in mining engineering in the United States and Mexico. John Birkinbine was reportedly the first American to critically examine the iron deposits of the Cerro de Mercado in Durango, Mexico, in the 1870s. He was also one of the first engineers to suggest the practicability of making iron on the Great Lakes from coke made from Pennsylva- nia coal. He also experimented with the use of various fuels , from charcoal to coke, to smelt iron. Birkinbine's interest in manufacturing pig iron from charcoal, and his knowledge of hydraulics, contributed to a concern for the condition of forests in Pennsylvania. Hew was one of the founders of the Pennsylvania Forestry Associa- tion. He served two terms as president of the American Institute of Mining Engi- neers, was a founding member and secretary of the United States Association of Charcoal Iron Workers, and served as an expert on iron ores for the U.S. Geological Survey. The business was continued by John Birkinbine's two sons, but was defunct by World War II. The papers reflect the firm's work on water projects in several states besides Pennsylvania including Arkansas, Indiana, Nebraska, and New York. The material on iron mining contains records from Kentucky, Maine, Mississippi, New Jersey, New Mexico, North Carolina, Ohio, and Pennsylvania. In addition, Cuban and Paraguayan mining activities are mentioned. The papers reflect much interest in machinery, particularly as it related to the smelting or iron and the pumping of water. Oregon Historical Society Research Library 1200 SW Park Avenue Portland, OR 97205-2483 Strong, Emory M. (1903-1980), 1905-ca. 1979; bulk ca. 1950-1979, 308 photographic prints. "Seeking Western Waters: The Lewis and Clark Trail from the Rockies to the Pacific" was published by the Oregon Historical Society Press in 1995 (Herbert K. Beals, ed.). The book combines journal entries from the expedition participants with Emory M. and Ruth Beacon Strongs' historical amplification and commen- tary. To illustrate their manuscript, the Strongs photographed landscapes, land- marks, Indian village sites, birds, animals, and plants that Lewis and Clark Expedition members witnessed and recorded. Ruth Beacon Strong, born in 1904 at Mosier, Oregon, was graduated from Mills College and earned a master's degree from the University of Oregon. She taught school for much of her working life, but as an avocational botanist she specialized in the study of Pacific Northwest native plants. Emory M. Strong was born in 1903 at Burton, Washington, and grew up on a farm near Sandy, Oregon. After graduating with an engineering degree from Oregon Agricultural College (now Oregon State</page><page sequence="32">612 Environmental History University) in 1933, he worked for the Forest Service and later the Bonneville Power Administration until his retirement in 1967. His avocational interest in archaeology and prehistory of the Columbia River region led him to help establish the Oregon Archaeological Society in 1951. As its president, Strong wrote its first publication, "Wakemap Mound, A Stratified Site on the Columbia River" (1959), following it with "Stone Age on the Columbia River" (1959), and, in collaboration with his wife, "Stone Age in the Great Basin" (1969). During their later years while living at Skamania, Washington, the Strongs fo- cused on the Lewis and Clark saga and spent many years photographing sites the expedition visited and recorded. They donated their manuscript, illustrated with the photographs in this collection, to the Oregon Historical Society in 1979. Emory died in 1980 and Ruth in 1985, both before seeing the publication of their photos and commentary. THE RUTGERS CENTER FOR HISTORICAL ANALYSIS invites applications for senior and post-doctoral fellowships from individuals engaged in research on topics related to: Industrial Environments: Creativity and Consequences In the academic year 2001-2002, the Rutgers Center for Historical Analysis will enter the first year of this two-year project. The first year will focus on the changing relations during industrialization among technological development, the environment, and public health from the last decades of the 18th century through World War II. Participants will explore industrialization's implications for world systems, as well as for national, regional, and local places. Individual projects should address some aspects of the complex interaction between technology, environment, and health. Through weekly seminars and annual conferences, fellows will explore the relationship between these three dimensions of history. Applicants need not be U.S. citizens. AA/EOE.
