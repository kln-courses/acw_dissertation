The Society's Gold Medal, or Twenty Guineas, is offered for an improved lamp or means of illumin- ation, suitable for railway passenger-carriages, that shall produce a good, clear, steady, durable, and safe light. It must be simple in construction, and capable of being readily cleaned and repaired. In judging the merits, cost will be taken into consideration. Specimens, in a condition suitable for trial, to be sent in to the Society's House not later than the 1st of November, 1874. The Council reserve to themselves the right of withholding the medal or premium offered, if, in the opinion of the judges, none of the articles sent in competition are deserving of reward. BRITISH ASSOCIATION. The forty-fourth annual session of the British Associa- tion commenced on Wednesday, the 19th inst., at Belfast. The opening meeting was held in Ulster-hall, at eight o'clock, when Professor Williamson, F.R.S., vacated the presidential chair in favour of Professor John Tyn- dall, F.R.S., D.C.L., LL.D., F.C.P.S^&amp;c, who delivered the following address : - An impulse inherent in primeval man turned hie thoughts and questionings betimes towards the sources of natural phenomena. The same impulse, inherited and intensified, is the spur of scientific action to-day. Determined by it, by a process of abstraction from ex- perience we form physical theories which lie beyond the pale of experience, but which satisfy the desire of the mind to see every natural occurrence resting upon a cause. In forming their notions of the origin of things, our earliest historic (and doubtless, we might add, our prehistoric) ancestors pursued, as far as their intelligence permitted, the same course. They also fell back upon experience, but with this difference - that the particular experiences which furnished the weft and woof of their theories were drawn, not from the study of nature, but from what lay muchi closer to them, the observation of men. Their theories accordingly took an anthropo- morphic form. To supersensual beings, which, "how- ever potent and invisible, were nothing but a species of human creatures, perhaps raised from among mankind, and retaining all human passion and appetites,"* were handed over the rule and governance of natural phenomena. Tested by observation and reflection, these early notions failed in the long run to satisfy the more pene- trating intellects of our race. Far in the depths of history we find men of exceptional power differentiating themselves from the crowd, rejecting these anthropo- morphic notions, and seeking to connect natural phenomena with their physical principles. But long prior to these purer efforts of the understanding the merchant had been abroad, and rendered the philosopher possible ; commerce had been developed, wealth amassed, leisure for travel and for speculation secured, while races educated under different conditions, and therefore dif- ferently formed and endowed, had been stimulated and sharpened by mutual contact. In those regions where the commercial aristocracy of ancient Greece mingled with its eastern neighbours, the sciences were born, being nurtured and developed by freethinking and courageous men. The state of things to be displaced may be gathered from a passage of Euripides quoted by Hume. " There is nothing in the world ; no glory, no prosperity. The gods toss all into confusion; mix everything with its reverse, that all of us, from our ignorance and uncertainty, may pay them the more worship and reverence." Now, as science demands the radical extirpation of caprice, and the absolute reliance upon law in nature, there grew with the growth of scientific notions a desire and determination to sweep from the field of theory this mob of gods and demone, and to place natural phenomena on a basis more con- gruent with themselves. * Hume, •• Natural History of ReHgion."</page><page sequence="2">834 JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OP ARTS, August 21, 1874. The problem which had been previously approached from above, was now attacked from below; theoretic effort passed from the super- to the sub-sensible. It was felt that to construct the universe in idea it was necessary to have some notion of its constituent parts - of what Lucretius subsequently called the " First Beginnings." Abstracting again from experience, the leaders of scientific speculation reached at length the pregnant doctrine of atoms and molecules, the latest de- velopments of which were set forth with such power and clearness at the last meeting of the British Associa- tion. Thought, no doubt had long hovered about this doctrine before it attained the precision and complete- ness which it assumed in the mind of Democritus,* a philosopher who may well for a moment arrest our atten- tion. " Few great men," says Lange, in his excellent "History of Materialism," a work to the spirit and letter of which I am equally indebted, have been so despitefully used by history as Democritus. In the distorted images sent down to us through unscientific traditions there remains of him almost nothing but the name of the " laughing philosopher," while figures of immeasurably smaller significance spread themselves at full length before us. Lange speaks of Bacon's high appreciation of Democritus - for ample illustrations of which I am indebted to my excellent friend Mr. Spedding, the learned editor and biographer of Bacon. It is evident, indeed, that Bacon considered Democritus to be a man of weightier metal than either Plato or Aristotle, though their philosophy " was noised and celebrated in the schools, amid the din and pomp of professors." It was not they, but Genseric and Attila and the barbarians, who destroyed the atomic philosophy. " For at a time when all human learning had suffered shipwreck, these planks of Aristotelian and Platonic philosophy, as being of a lighter and more inflated substance, were preserved and came down to us, while things more solid sank, and almost passed into oblivion." The principles enunciated by Democritus reveal his uncompromising antagonism to those who deduced the phenomena of nature from the caprices of the gods. They are briefly these : - 1. From nothing comes nothing. Nothing that exists can be destroyed. All changes are due to the combination and separation of molecules. 2. Nothing happens by chance. Every occurrence has its cause from which it follows by neces- sity. 3. The only existing things are the atoms and empty space ; all else is mere opinion. 4. The atoms are infinite in number, and infinitely various in form ; they strike together, and the lateral motions and whirl- ings which thus arise are the beginnings of worlds. 5. The varieties of all things depend upon the varieties of their atoms, in number, size, and aggregation. 6. The soul consists of free, smooth, round atoms, like those of fire. These are the most mobile of all. They inter- penetrate the whole body, and in their motions the phenomena of life arise. Thus the atoms of Democritus are individually without sensation ; they combine in obedience to mechanical laws ; and not only organic forms, but the phenomena of sensation and thought are also the result of their combination. That great enigma, " the exquisite adaptation of one part of an organism to another part, and to the con- ditions of life," more especially the construction of the human body, Democritns made no attempt to solve. Empedocles, a man of more fiery and poetic nature, introduced the nature of love and hate among the atoms to account for their combination and separation. Noticing this gap in the doctrine of Democritus, he struck in with the penetrating thought, linked, how- ever, with some wild speculation, that it lay in the very nature of those combinations which were suited to their ends (in other words, in harmony with their environ- ment) to maintain themselves, while unfit combinations, having no proper habitat, must rapidly disappear. Thus more than 2,000 years ago the doctrine of the " survival of the fittest," which in our day, not on the basis of vague conjecture, but of positive knowledge, has been raised to such extraordinary significance, had received at all events partial enunciation.* Epicurusf, said to be the son of a poor schoolmaster at Samos, is the next dominant figure in the history of the atomic philosophy. He mastered the writings of Demo- critus, heard lectures in Athens, returned to Samos, and subsequently wandered through various countries. He finally returned to Athens, where he bought a garden, and surrounded himself by pupils, in the midst of whom he lived a pure and serene life, and died a peaceful death. His philosophy was almost identical with that of Demo- critus ; but he never quoted either friend or foe. One main eject of Epicurus was to free the world from superstition and the fear of death. Death he treated with indifference. It merely robs us of sensation. As long as we are, death is not ; and when death is, we are not. Life has no more evil for him who has made up his mind that it is no evil not to live. He adored the gods, but not in the ordinary fashion. The idea of divine power, properly purified, he thought an elevating one. Still he taught, " Not he is godless who rejects the gods of the crowd, but rather he who accepts them." The gods were to him eternal and immortal beings, whose blessedness excluded every thought of care or occupation of any kind. Nature pursues her course in accordance with everlasting laws, the gods never inter- fering. They haunt " The lucid interspace of world and world Where never creeps a cloud or moves a wind, Nor ever falls the least white star of snow, Nor erer lowest roll of thunder moans, Nor sound of human sorrow mounts to mar Their sacred everlasting calm.' J Lange considers the relation of Epicurus to the gods subjective; the indication probably of an ethical re- quirement of his own nature. We cannot read history with open eyes, or study human nature to its depths, and fail to discern such a requirement. Man has never been, and he never will be satisfied with the operations and products of the Understanding alone ; hence physical science cannot cover all the demands of his nature. But the history of the efforts made to satisfy these demands might be broadly described as a history of errors - the error consisting in ascribing fixity to that which is fluent, which varies as we vary, being gross when we are gross, and becoming as our capacities widen, more abstract and sublime. On one great point the mind of Epicurus was at peace. He neither sought nor expected, here or hereafter, any personal profit from his relation to the gods. And it is assuredly a fact that loftiness and serenity of thought may be promoted by conceptions which involve no idea of profit of this kind. " Did I not believe," said a great man to me once, " that an Intelligence is at the heart of things, my life on earth would be intolerable." The utterer of these words is not, in my opinion, rendered less noble but more noble by the fact that it was the need of ethical harmony here, and not the thought of personal profit hereafter, that prompted his observation. A century and a half after the death of Epicurus, Lu- cretius} wrote his great poem, " On the Nature of Things," in which he, a Roman, developed with extraordinary ardour the philosophy of his Greek predecessor. He wishes to win over his friend Memmius to the school of Epicurus ; and although he has no rewards in a future life to offer, although his object appears to be a purely negative one, he addresses his friend with the heat of an apostle. His object, like that of his great forerunner, is the destruction of superstition; and considering that men trembled before every natural event as a direct * Born 460 b.c. * Lange, 2nd edit., p. 23. + Born 342 b.c. ± Tennvson's " Liiftrfit.ins."

He refutes the notion that any thing can come out of nothing, or that that which is once begotten can be re- called to nothing. The first beginnings, the atoms, are indestructible, and into them all things can be dissolved at last. Bodies are partly atoms, and partly combina- tions of atoms ; but the atoms nothing can quench. They are strong in solid singleness, and by their denser combination, all things can be closely packed and exhibit enduring strength. He denies that matter is infinitely divisible. We come at length to the atoms, without which, as an imperishable substratum, all order in the generation and development of things would be de- stroyed. The mechanical shock of the atoms being in his view the all-sufficient cause of things, he combats the notion that the constitution of nature has been in any way determined by intelligent design. The interaction of the atoms throughout infinite time rendered all manner of combinations possible. Of these the fit ones persisted, while the unfit ones disappeared. Not after sage deliberation did the atoms station themselves in their right places, nor did they bargain what motions they should assume. From all eternity they have been driven together, and after trying motions and unions of every kind, they fell at length into the arrangements out of which this system of things has been formed. His grand conception of the atoms falling silently through im- measurable ranges of space and time suggested the nebular hypothesis to Kant, its first propounder. " If you will apprehend and keep in mind these things, nature, free at once, and rid of her haughty lords, is seen to do all things spontaneously by herself, without the meddling of the gods."* During the centuries between the first of these three philosophers and the last, the human intellect was active in other fields than theirs. The sophists had run through their career. At Athens had appeared the three men, Socrates, Plato, and Aristotle, whose yoke remains to some extent unbroken to the present hour. Within this period also the School of Alexandria was founded, Euclid wrote his " Elements," and he and others made some advance in optics. Archimedes had propounded the theory of the lever and the principles of hydrostatics. Pythagoras had made his experiments on the harmonic intervals, while astronomy was immensely enriched by the discoveries of Hipparchus, who was followed by the historically more celebrated Ptolemy. Anatomy had been made the basis of scientific medicine ; and it is said by Draper f that vivisection then began. In fact the science of ancient Greece had already cleared the world of the fantastic images of divinities operating capri- ciously through natural phenomena. It had shaken itself free from that fruitless scrutiny " by the internal light of the mind alone," which had vainly sought to transcend experience and reach a knowledge of ultimate causes. Instead of accidental observation, it had intro- duced observation with a purpose; instruments were employed to aid the senses ; and scientific method was rendered in a great measure complete by the union of Induction and Experiment. What, then, stopped its victorious advance? Why was the scientific intellect compelled, like an exhausted soil, to lie fallow for nearly two millenniums before it could regather the elements necessary to its fertility and strength ? Bacon has already let us know one cause ; Whewell ascribes this stationary period to four causes - obscurity of thought, servility, intolerance of disposi- tion, enthusiasm of temper; and he gives a striking example of each*. But these characteristics must nave had their causes, which lay in the circumstances of the time. Rome, and the other cities of the empire, had fallen into moral putrefaction. Christianity had ap- peared, offering the gospel to the poor, and, by modera- tion if not asceticism of life, practically protesting against the profligacy of the age. The sufferings of the early Christians and the extraordinary exaltation of mind which enabled them to triumph over the diabolical tortures to which they were subjectedf , must have left traces not easily effaced. They scorned the earth, in view of that " building of God, that house not made with hands, eternal in the heavens." The Scriptures which ministered to their spiritual needs were also the measure of their science. When, for example, the celebrated question of antipodes came to be discussed, the Bible was with many the ultimate court of appeal. Augustine, who flourished a.d. 400, would not deny the rotundity of the earth ; but he would deny the possible existence of inhabitants at the other side, " because no such race is recorded in Scripture among the descendants of Adam." Archbishop Boniface was shocked at the assumption of a " world oř human beings out of the reach of the means of salvation." Thus reined in, Science was not likely to make much progress. Later on the political and theo- logical strife between the Church and civil governments, so powerfully depicted by Draper, must have done much, to stifle investigation. Whewell makes many wise and brave remarks re- garding the spirit of the Middle Ages. It was a menial spirit. The seekers after natural knowledge had for- saken that fountain of living waters, the direct appeal to nature by observation and experiment, and had given themselves up to the remanipulation of the notions of their predecessors. It was a time when thought had become abject, and when the acceptance of mere authority led, as it always does in science, to intellectual death. Natural events, instead of being traced to physical, were referred to moral causes ; while an exer- cise of the phantasy, almost as degrading as the spiritu- alism of the present day, took the place of scientific specu- lation. Then came the mysticism of the Middle Ages. Magic, Alchemy, the Neo-platonic philosophy, with its visionary though sublime abstractions, which caused men to look with shame upon their own bodies as hindrances to the absorption of the creature in the blessedness of the Creator. Finally came the scholastic philosophy, a fusion, according to Lange, of the least-mature notions of Aristotle with the Christianity of the west. Intellectual immobility was the result. As a traveller without a compass in a fog may wander long, imagining he is making way, and find himself after hours of toil at his starting-point, so the schoolmen, having tied and untied the same knots and formed and dissipated the same clouds, found themselves at the end of centuries in their old position. With regard to the influence wielded by Aristotle in the Middle Ages, and which, though to a less extent, he still wields, I would ask permission to make one remark. When the human mind has achieved greatness and given evidence of extraordinary power in any domain, there is a tendency to credit it with similar power in all other domains. Thus theologians have found comfort and assurance in the thought that Newton dealt with the question of revelation, forgetful of the fact that the very devotion of his powers, through all the best years of his life, to a totally different class of ideas, not to speak of any natural disqualification, tended to render him less instead of more competent to deal with theo- logical and historic questions. Goethe, starting from. his established greatness as a poet, and indeed from his positive discoveries in natural history, produced a pro- • Munro's translation. In his criticism of this work (Contem- porary Review, 1867) Dr. Hay man does not appear to be aware of the really sound and subtile observations on which the reasoaing oí Lucretius, though erroneous, sometimes rests. + "History of the Intellectual Development of Europe," p. 295. • " History of the Inductive Sciences," vol. 1. + Depicted with terrible vmaness m Kenans "ллшсппэт.</page><page sequence="4">836 JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. found impression among the painters of Germany» when he published his " Farbenlekre," in which he endeavoured to overthrow Newton's theory of colours. This theory he deemed so obviously absurd, that he considered its author a charlatan, and attacked him with a corresponding vehemence of language. In the domain of natural history Goethe had really made considerable discoveries ; and we have high authority for assuming that, had he devoted himself wholly to that side of science, he might have reached in it an eminence com- parable with that which he attained as a poet. In sharpness of observation, in the detection of analogies however apparently remote, in the classification and organisation of facts according to the analogies discerned, Goethe possessed extraordinary powers. These elements of scientific inquiry fall in with the discipline of the poet. But, on the other hand, a mind thus richly endowed in the direction of natural history, may be almost shorn of endowment as regards the more strictly called physical and mechanical sciences. Goethe was in this condition. He could not formulate distinct mechanical reasoning; and in regions where such reasoning reigns supreme he became a mere ignis fatuus to those who followed him. I have sometimes permitted myself to compare Aristotle with Goethe, to credit the Stagirite with an almost superhuman power of amassing and systematising facts, but to consider him fatally defective on that side of the mind in respect to which incompleteness has been just ascribed to Goethe. Whewell refers the errors of Aristotle, not to a neglect of facts, but to " a neglect of the idea appropriate to the facts ; the idea of mechanical cause, which is force, and the substitution of vague or inapplicable notions, involving only relations of space or emotions of wonder." This is doubtless true; but the word "neglect" implies mere intellectual mis- direction, whereas in Aristotle, as in Goethe, it was not, I believe, misdirection, but sheer natural incapacity which lay at the root of his mistakes. As a physicist, Aristotle displayed what we should consider some of the worst attributes of a modern physical investigator - indistinctness of ideas, confusion of mind, and a confi- dent use of language, which led to the delusive notion that he had really mastered his subject, while he as yet failed to grasp even the elements of it. He put words in the place of things, subject in the place of object. He preached induction without practising it, inverting the true order of inquiry by passing from the general to the particular, instead of from the particular to the general. He made of the universe a closed sphere, in the centre of which he fixed the earth, proving from general principles, to his own satisfaction and to that of the world for near 2,000 years, that no other universe was possible. His notions of motion were entirely un- physical. It was natural or unnatural, better or worse, calm or violent - no real mechanical conception regarding it lying at the bottom of his mind. He affirmed that a vacuum could not exist, and proved that if it did exist motion in it would be impossible. He determined à priori how many species of animals must exist, and shows on general principles why animals must have such and such parts. When an eminent contemporary philosopher, who is far removed from errors of this kind, remembers these abuses of the à priori method, he will be able to make allowance for the jealousy of physicists as to the acceptance of so-called à priori truths. Aristotle's errors of detail were grave and numerous. He affirmed that only in man we had the beating of the heart, that the left side of the body was colder than the right, that men have more teeth than women, and that there is an empty space, not at the front, but at the back of every man's head. There is one essential quality in physical conceptions which was entirely wanting in those of Aristotle and his followers. I wish it could be expressed by a word untainted by its associations ; it signifies a capability of being placed as a coherent picture before the mind. The Germans express the act of picturing by the word vorstellen, and the picture they call a Vorstellung, We have no word in English which comes nearer to our requirements than imagination, and, taken with its proper limitations, the word answers very well ; but, a&amp; just intimated, it is tainted by its associations, and therefore objectionable to some minds. Compare, with reference to this capacity of mental presentation, the case of the Aristotelian, who refers the ascent of water in a pump to Nature's abhorrence of a vacuum, with that of Pascal when he proposed to solve the question of atmospheric pressure by the ascent of the Puy de Dome. In the one case the terms of the explanation refuse to fall into place as a physical image ; in the other the image is distinct, the fall and rise of the barometer being clearly figured as the balancing of two varying and opposing pressures. During the drought of the Middle Ages in Christen- dom, the Arabian intellect, as forcibly shown by Draper, was active. With the intrusion of the Moors into Spain, cleanliness, order, learning, and refinement took the place of their opposites. When smitten with disease, the Christian peasant resorted to a shrine, the Moorish one to an instructed physician. The Arabs encouraged translations from the Greek philosophers, but not from the Greek poets. They turned in disgust "from the lewdness of our classical mythology, and denounced as- an unpardonable blasphemy all connection between the impure Olympian Jove and the Most High God." Draper traces still further than Whewell the Arab elements in our scientific terms, and points out that the under garment of ladies retains to this hour its Arab name. He gives examples of what Arabian men of science accomplished, dwelling particularly on Alhazen,. who was the first to correct the Platonic notion that ray&amp; of light are emitted by the eye. He discovered atmos- pheric refraction, and points out that we see the sun and moon after they have set. He explains the enlarge- ment of the sun and moon, and the shortening of the vertical diameters of both these bodies, when near the horizon. He is aware that the atmosphere decreases m density with increase of height, and actually fixes it» height at 58£ miles. In the Book of the Balance of Wisdom, he sets forth the connection between the weight of the atmosphere and its increasing density. He shows that a body will weigh differently in a rare and a dense atmosphere : he considers the force with which plunged bodies rise through heavier media. He understands the doctrine of the centre of gravity, and applies it to the investigation of balances and steelyards. He recognises gravity as a force, though he falls into the error of making it diminish as the distance, and of making it purely terrestrial. He knows the relations between the velocities, spaces, and times of falling bodies, and has distinct ideas of capillary attraction. He improves the hydrometer. The determination of the densities of bodies as given by Alhazen approach very close to our own. " I join," says Draper, "in the pious prayer of Alhazen, that in the day of judgment the All-Merciful will take pity on the soul of Abur- Raihân, because he was the first of the race of men to construct a table of specific gravities." If all this be historic truth (and I have entire confidence in Dr. Draper), well may he " deplore the systematic manner in which the literature of Europe has contrived to put out of sight our scientific obligations to the Mohamme- dans."* Towards the close of the stationary period a word- weariness, if I may so express it, took more and more possession of men's minds. Christendom had become sick of the school philosophy and its verbal wastes, which led to no issue, but left the intellect in ever- lasting haze. Here and there was heard the voice of one impatiently crying in the wilderness, " Not unto- Aristotle, not unto subtle hypotheses, not unto churchy * " Intellectual Development of Europe," p. 359.</page><page sequence="5">JOÜENAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. 837 bible, or blind tradition, must we turn for a knowledge of the universe, but to the direct investigation of nature by observation and experiment." In 1543 the epoch- making work of Copernicus on the paths of the heavenly- bodies appeared. The total crash of Aristotle's closed universe with the earth at its centre followed as a con- sequence ; and " the earth moves " became a watchword among ^intellectual freemen. Copernicus was Canon of the church of Frauenburg, in the diocese of Ermeland. For three and-thirty years he had withdrawn himself from the world and devoted himself to the consolidation of his great scheme of the solar system. He made its blocks eternal ; and even to those who feared it and desired its overthrow it was so obviously strong that they refrained for a time from meddling with it. In the last year of the life of Copernicus his book appeared : it is said that the old man received a copy of it a few days before his death, and then departed in peace. The Italian philosopher Giordano Bruno was one of the earliest converts to the new astronomy. Taking Lucretius as his exemplar, he revived the notion of the infinity of worlds ; and combining with it the doctrine of Copernicus, reached the sublime generalisation that the fixed stars are suns, scattered numberless through space and accompanied by satellites, which bear the same relation to them that our earth does to our sun, or our moon to our earth. This was an expansion of transcendent import ; but Bruno came closer than this to our present line of thought. Struck with the problem of the generation and maintenance of organisms, and duly pondering it, he came to the conclusion that Nature in her productions does not imitate the technic of man. Her process is one of unravelling and unfolding. Tbe infinity of forms under which matter appears were not imposed upon it by an external artificer ; by its own in- trinsic force and virtue it brings these forms forth. Matter is not the mere naked, empty capacity which philosophers have pictured her to be, but the universal mother, who brings forth all things as the fruit of her own womb. This outspoken man was originally a Dominican monk. He was accused of heresy and had to fly, seek- ing refuge in Geneva, Paris, England, and Germany. In 1592 he fell into the hands of the Inquisition at Venice. He was imprisoned for many years, tried, degraded, excommunicated, and handed over to the Civil power, with the request that he should be treated gently and " without the shedding of blood." This meant that he was to be burnt ; and burnt accordingly he was, on the 16th of February, 1600. To escape a similar fate Galileo, 33 years afterwards, abjured, upon his knees and with his hand upon the holy gospels, the heliocentric doctrine. After Galileo came Kepler, ■who from his German home defied the power beyond the Alps. He traced out from pre-existing observations the laws of planetary motion. The problem was thus prepared for Newton, who bound those empirical laws together by the principles of gravitation. During the Middle Ages the doctrine of atoms had to all appearance vanished from discussion. In all pro- bability it held its ground among sober-minded and thoughtful men, though neither the church nor the world was prepared to hear of it with tolerance. Once, in the year 1348, it received distinct expression. But re- traction by compulsion immediately followed, and thus discouraged, it slumbered till the 17th century, when it was revived by a contemporary of Hobbes and Descartes, the Père Gassendi. The analytic and synthetic tendencies of the human mind exhibit themselves throughout history, great writers ranging themselves sometimes on the one side, sometimes on the other. Men of lofty feelings, and minds open to the elevating impressions produced by nature as a whole, whose satisfaction, therefore, is rather ethical than logical, have leaned to the synthetic side ; while the analytic har- monises best with the more precise and more mechanical bias which seeks the satisfaction of the understanding. Some form of pantheism was usually adopted by the one, while a detached Creator, working more or less after the manner of men, was often assumed by the other.* Gas- sendi is hardly to be ranked with either. Having formally acknowledged God as the great first cause, he immediately drops the idea, applies the known laws of mechanics to the atoms, and thence deduces all vital phenomena. God who created earth and water, plants and animals, pro- duced, in the first place, a definite number of atoms, which constituted the seed of all things. Then began that series of combinations and decompositions which goes on at the present day, and which will continue in the future. The principle of every change resides in matter. In artificial productions the moving principle is different from the material worked upon ; but in nature the agent works within, being the most active and mobile part of the material itself. Thus this bold ecclesiastic, without in- curring the censure of the church or the world, contrives to outstrip Mr. Darwin. The same cast of mind which caused him to detach the Creator from his universe led him also to detach the soul from the body, though to the body he ascribes an influence so large as to render the soul almost unnecessary. The aberrations of reason were in his view an affair of the material brain. Mental disease is brain-disease ; but then the immortal reason sits apart, and cannot be touched by the disease. The errors of madness are errors of the instrument, not of the per- former. It may be more than a mere result of education, con- necting itself probably with the deeper mental structure of the two men, that the idea of Gassendi, above enunciated, is substantially the same as that expressed by Professor Clerk Maxwell at the close of the very noble lecture de- livered by him at Bradford last year. According to both philosophers, the atoms, if I understand aright, are the prepared materials, the " manufactured articles," which, formed by the skill of the Highest, produce by their sub- sequent inter-action all the phenomena of the material world. There seems to be this difference, however, between Gassendi and Maxwell. The one postulates, the other infers his first cause. In his manufactured articles, Professor Maxwell finds the basis of an induction, which enables him to scale philosophic heights considered inaccessible by Kant, and to take the logical step from the atoms to their Maker. The atomic doctrine, in whole or in part, was enter- tained by Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes, Locke, Newton, Boyle, and their successors, until the chemical law of multiple proportions enabled Dalton to confer upon it an entirely new significance. In our day there are secessions from the theory, but it still stands firm. Only a year or two ago Sir William Thomson, with characteristic penetration, sought to determine the sizes of the atoms, or rather to fix the limits between which their sizes lie ; while only last year the discourses of Williamson and Maxwell illustrate the present hold of the doctrino upon the foremost scientific minds. What these atoms, self- moved and self-posited, can and cannot accomplish in relation to life, is at the present moment the subject of profound scientific thought. I doubt the legitimacy of Maxwell's logic ; but it is impossible not to feel the ethic glow with which his lecture concludes. There is, more- over, a Lucretian grandeur in his description of the steadfastness of the atoms : - " Natural causes, as we know, are at work, which tend to modify, if they do not at length destroy, all the arrangements and dimensions of the earth and the whole solar system. But though in the course of ages catastrophes have occurred and may yet occur in the heavens, though ancient systems may be dissolved and new systems evolved out of their ruins, the * Boyle's model of the universe was the Strasburg clock with au outside Artificer. Goethe, on the other hand sang " Ihm ziemťs die Welt im Innern zu bewegen, Natur in sich, sich in Natur zu hegen." The same repugnance to the Clockmaker conception is manifest in Carlyle.</page><page sequence="6">838 JOURNAL OP THE SOCIETY OP ARTS, August 21, 1874. molecules out of which these systems are built, the foundation stones of the material universe, remain un- broken and unworn." Ninety years subsequent tp Gassendi the doctrine of bodily instruments, as it may be called, assumed immense importance in the hands of Bishop Butler, who in his famous "Analogy of Religion," developed from his own point of view, and with consummate sagacity, a similar idea. The Bishop still influences superior minds ; and it will repay us to dwell for a moment on his views. He draws the sharpest distinction between our real selves and our bodily instruments. He does not, as far as I remember, use the word " soul," possibly because the term was so hackneyed in his day, as it had been for many generations previously. But he speaks of " living powers," "perceiving," or "percipient powers," "moving agents," " ourselves," in the same sense as we should employ the term " soul." He dwells upon the fact that limbs may be removed, and mortal diseases assail the body, while the mind, almost up to the moment of death, remains clear. He refers to sleep and to swoon, where the " living powers " are suspended but not destroyed. He considers it quite as easy to conceive of an existence out of our bodies as in them ; that we may animate a succession of bodies, the dissolution of all of them having no more tendency to dissolve our real selves, or " deprive us of living faculties - the faculties of perception and action - than the dissolution of any foreign matter which we are capable of receiving impressions from, or making use of for the common occasions of life." This is the key of the Bishop's position : "our organised bodies are no more a part of ourselves than any other matter around us." In proof of this he calls attention to the use of glasses, which "prepare objects" for the "percipient power" exactly as the eye does. The eye itself is no more per- cipient than the glass, and is quite as much the instru- ment of the true self, and also as foreign to the true self, as the glass is. " And if we see with our eyes only in the same manner as we do with glasses, the like may justly be concluded from analogy of all our senses." Lucretius, as you are aware, reached a precisely oppo- site conclusion ; and it certainly would be interesting, if not profitable, to us all, to hear what he would or could urge in opposition to ihe reasoning of the Bishop. As a brief discussion of the point will enable us to see the bearings of an important question, I will here permit a disciple of Lucretius to try the strength of the Bishop's position, and then allow the Bishop to retaliate, with the view of rolling back, if he can, the difficulty upon Lucretius. Each shall state his case fully and frankly ; and you shall be umpire between them. The argument might proceed in this fashion : - " Subjected to the test of mental presentation ( Vorstel- lung) your views, most honoured prelate, would present to many minds a great, if not an insuperable difficulty. You speak of * living powers/ ' percipient or perceiving powers,' and ' ourselves ;' but can you form a mental picture of any one of these apart from the organism through which it is supposed to act? Test yourself honestly, and see whether you possess any faculty that would enable you to form such a conception. The true self has a local habitation in each of us ; thus localised, must it not possess a form ? If so, what form ? Have you ever for a moment realised it? When a leg is amputated, the body is divided into two parts ; is the true self in both of them or in one ? Thomas Aquinas might say in both ; but not you, for you appeal to the consciousness associated with one of the two parts to prove that the other is foreign matter. Is consciousness, then, a necessary element of the true self ? If so, what do you say to the case of the whole body being deprived of consciousness ? If not, then on what grounds do you deny any portion of the true self to the severed limb ? It seems very singular that, from the beginning to the end of your admirable book (and no one admires its sober strength more than I do), you never once mention the brain or nervous system. You begin at one end of the- body, and show that its parts may be removed without prejudice to the perceiving power. What if you begin at the other end, and remove, instead of the leg, the brain ? The body, as before, is divided into two parts ; but both are now in the same predicament, and neither can be appealed to to prove that the other is foreign matter. Or, instead of going so far as to remove the brain itself, let a certain portion of its bony covering he? removed, and let a rhythmic series of pressures and re- laxations of pressure be applied to the soft substance. At every pressure 'the faculties of perception and of action,' vanish ; at every relaxation of pressure they are- restored. Where, during the intervals of pressure is the perceiving power ? I once had the discharge of a large Leyden battery passed unexpectedly through me : I felt nothing, but was simply blotted out of conscious- existence for a sensible interval. Where was my true self during that interval? Men who have recovered from lightning-stroke have been much longer in the sam&amp; state ; and indeed in cases of ordinary concussion of the brain, days may elapse during which no experience is. registered in consciousness. Where is the man himself during the period of insensibility ? You may say that I beg the question when I assume the man to have been unconscious, that he was really conscious all the time,, and has simply forgotten what has occurred to him. In reply to this, I can only say that no one need shrink from the worst tortures that superstition ever invented if only so felt and so remembered. I do not think your theory of instruments goes at all to the bottom of the matter. A telegraph operator has his instruments, by means of which he converses with the world ; our bodiea possess a nervous system, which plays a similar part between the perciving power and external things. Cut the wires of the operator, break his battery, demagnetise his needle : by this means you certainly sever his con- nection with the world ; but inasmuch as these are real instruments, their destruction does not touch the man who uses them. The operator survives, and he knows that he survives. What is it, I would ask, in the human system that answers to this conscious survival of the operator when the battery of the brain is so disturbed as to produce insensibility, or when it is destroyed altogether ? "Another consideration, which you may consider slight, presses upon me with some force. The brain may change from health to disease, and through such a change the most exemplary man may be converted into a debauchee or a murderer. My very noble and approved good master had, as you know, threatenings of lewdness introduced into his brain by his jealous wife's philter; and sooner than permit himself to run even the risk of yielding to these base promptings he slew himself. How could the hand of Lucretius have been thus turned against himself if the real Lucretius remained as before ? Can the brain or can it not act in this distempered way without the intervention of the immortal reason ? If it cannot, then the immortal reason, by its mischievous activity in operating upon a broken instrument, must have the credit of committing every imaginable ex- travagance and crime. I think, if you will allow me to say so, that the gravest consequences are likely to flow from your estimate of the body. To regard the brain as you would a staff or an eye-glass - to shut your eyes to all its mystery, to the perfect correlation that reigns between its conditions and our consciousness, to the fact that a slight excess or defect of blood in it produces that very swoon to which you refer, and that in relation to it our meat, and drink, and air, and exercise have a perfectly transcendental value and significance - to forget all this does, I think, open a way to innumerable errors in our habits of life, and may possibly in some cases initiate and foster that very disease, and consequent mental ruin, which a wiser appreciation of this mysterious organ would have avoided." I can imagine the Bishop thoughtful after hearing</page><page sequence="7">JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. 839 this argument. He was not the man to allow anger to mingle with the consideration of a point of this kind. After due consideration, and having strengthened him- self by that honest contemplation of the facts, which was habitual with him, and which includes the desire to give even adverse facts their due weight, I can suppose the Bishop to proceed thus : - " You will remember that in the * Analogy of Religion/ of which you have so kindly epoken, I did not profess to prove anything absolutely, and that I over and over again acknowledged and insisted on the smallness of our knowledge, or rather the depth of our ignorance, as regards the whole system of the universe. My object was to show my deistical friends, who set forth so eloquently the beauty and beneficence of Nature and the Ruler thereof, while they had nothing but scorn for the so-called absurdities of the Christian scheme, that they were in no better condition than we were, and that, for every difficulty they found upon our side, quite as great a difficulty was to be found upon theirs. I will now, with your permission, adopt a similar line of argument. You are a Lucretian, and from the combination and separation of atoms deduce all terrestrial things, including organic forms and their phenomena. Let me tell you in the first instance how far I am prepared to go with you. I admit that you can build crystalline forms out of this play of molecular force ; that the diamond, amethyst, and snow-star are truly wonder- ful structures which are thus produced. I will go further, and acknowledge that even a tree or flower might in this way be organised. Nay, if you can show me an animal without sensation, I will concede to you that it also might be put together by the suitable play of molecular force. " Thus far our way is clear, but now comes my difiî- culty. Your atoms are individually without sensation, much more are they without intelligence. May I ask you, then, to try your hand upon this problem. Take your dead hydrogen atoms, your dead oxygen atoms, your dead carbon atoms, your dead nitrogen atoms, your dead phosphorus atoms, and all the other atoms, dead as grains of shot, of which the brain is formed. Imagine them separate and sensationless ; observe them running together and forming all imaginable combinations. This, as a purely mechanical process, is seeable by the mind. But can you see, or dream, or in any way imagine, how out of that mechanical act, and from these individually dead atoms, sensation, thought, and emotion are to arise ? You speak of the difficulty of mental presentation in my case ; is it less in yours ? I am not all bereft of this Vorstellung s- Kraft of which you speak. I can follow a particle of musk until it reaches the olfactory nerve ; I can follow the waves of sound until their tremors reach the water of the labyrinth, and set the otoliths and Corti' s fibres in motion ; I can also visualise the waves of ether as they cross the eye and hit the retina. Nay more, I am able to follow up to the central organ the motion thus imparted at the periphery, and to see in idea the very molecules of the brain thrown into tremors. My insight is not baffled by these physical processes. What baffles me, what I find unimaginable, transcending every faculty I possess - transcending, I humbly submit, every faculty you possess - is the notion that out of those physical tremors you can extract things so utterly in- congruous with them, as sensation, thought, and emotion. You say, or think, that this issue of consciousness from the clash of atoms is not more incongruous than the flash of light from the union of oxygen and hydrogen. But I beg to say that it is. For such incongruity as the flash possesses is that which I now force upon your attention. The flash is an affair of consciousness, the objective counterpart of which is a vibration. It is a flash only by your interpretation. You are the cause of the apparent incongruity ; and you are the thing that puzzles me. I need not remind you that the great Leibnitz felt the difficulty which I feel, and, that to get rid of this monstrous deduction of life from death he displaced your atoms bv his monads, which were more or less perfect • Only to some ; for there are dignitaries -who even now speak of the earth's rocky crust as so much building material pre- pared for man at the Creation. Surely it is time that this loose language should cease. mirrors of the universe, and out of the summation and integration of which he supposed all the phenomena of life - sentient, intellectual, and emotional - to arise. " Your difficulty, then, as I see you are ready to admit, is quite as great as mine. You cannot satisfy the human mind in its demand for logical continuity between mole- cular processes and the phenomena of consciousness. This is a rock on which materialism must inevitably split whenever it pretends to be a complete philosophy of life. What is the moral, my Lucretian ? You and I are not likely to indulge in ill-temper in the discussion of these great topics where we see so much room for honest differ- ences of opinion. But there are people of less wit, or more bigotry (I say it with humility) on both sides, who are ever ready to mingle anger and vituperation with such discussions. There are, for example, writers of note and influence at the present day who are not ashamed to assume the i deep personal sin ' of a great logician to be the cause of his unbelief in a theologie dogma. And there are others that hold that we, who cherish our noble Bible, wrought as it has been into the constitution of our forefathers, and by inheritance into us, must neces- sarity be hypocritical and insincere. Let us disavow and discountenance such people, cherishing the unswerv- ing faith that what is good and true in both our argu- ments will be preserved for the benefit of humanity, while all that is bad or false will disappear." It is worth remarking that in one respect the Bishop was a product of his age. Long previous to his day the nature of the soul had been so favourite and general a topic of discussion, that, when the students of the Univer- sity of Paris wished to know the leanings of a new Professor, they at once requested him to lecture upon the soul. About the time of Bishop Butler the question was not only agitated, but extended. It was seen by the clear- witted men who entered this arena that many of their beet arguments applied equally to brutes and men. The Bishop's arguments were of this character. He saw it, admitted it, accepted the consequences, and boldly embraced the whole animal world in his scheme of immortality. Bishop Butler accepted with unwavering trust the chronology of the Old Testament, describing it as " confirmed by the natural and civil history of the world, collected from common historians, from the state of the earth, and from the late inventions of arts and sciences." These words mark progress; they must seem somewhat hoary to the Bishop's successors of to- day.* It is hardly necessary to inform you that since his time the domain of the naturalist has been im- mensely extended - the whole science of geology, with its astounding revelations regarding the life of the ancient earth, having been created. The rigidity of old conceptions has been relaxed, the public mind being rendered gradually tolerant of the idea that not for six thousand, nor for sixty thousand, nor for six thousand thousand, but formons embracing untold millions of years, this earth has been the theatre of life and death. The riddle of the rocks has been read by the geologist and palaeontologist, from subcambrian depths to the deposits thickening over the sea-bottoms of to-day. And upon the leaves of that stone book are, as you know, stamped the characters, plainer and surer than those formed by the ink of history, which carry the mind back into abysses of past time compared with which the periods which satisfied Bishop Butler cease to have a visual angle. Everybody now knows this ; all men admit it ; still when they were first broached these varities of science found loud-tonged denunciators, who proclaimed not only their baselessness considered scientifically, but their immo- rality considered as questions of ethics and religion : the Book of Genesis had stated the question in a dif- ferent fashion ; and science must necessarily go to pieces</page><page sequence="8">840 JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. •when it clashed with this authority. And as the seed of a thistle produces a thistle, and nothing else, so these objectors scatter their germs abroad, and reproduce their kind, ready to play again the part of their intel- lectual progenitors, to show the same virulence, the same ignorance, to achieve for a time the same success, and finally to suffer the same inexorable defeat. Surely the time must come at last when human nature in its entirety, whose legitimate demands it is admitted science alone cannot satisfy, will find inter- preters and expositors of a different stamp from those rash and ill-informed persons who have been hitherto so ready to hurl themselves against every new scientific revelation, lest it should endanger what they are pleased to consider theirs. The lode of discovery once struck, those petrified forms in which life was at one time active, increased to multi- tudes and demanded classification. The general fact soon became evident that none but the simplest forms of life lie lowest down, that as we climb higher and higher among the super-imposed strata more perfect forms appear. The change, however, from form to form was not continuous - but by steps, some small, some great. "A section," says Mr. Huxley, ua hundred feet thick will exhibit at different heights a dozen species of Ammonite, none of which passes beyond its particular zone of limestone, or clay, into the zone below it, or into that above it." In the presence of such facts it was not possible to avoid the question: - Have these forms, showing, though in broken stages and with many irregularities, this unmistakable general advance, been subjected to no continuous law of growth or variation ? Had our education been purely scientific, or had it been sufficiently detached from influences which, however ennobling in another domain, have always proved hindrances and delusions when introduced as factors into the domain of physics, the scientific mind never could have swerved from the search for a law of growth, or allowed itself to accept the anthropomorphism which regarded each successive stratum as a kind of mechanic's bench for the manufacture of new species out of all relation to the old. Biased, however, by their previous education, the great majority of naturalists invoked a special creative act to account for the appearance of each new group of organisms. Doubtless there were numbers who were clear-headed enough to see that this was no explanation at all, that in point of fact it was an attempt, by the introduction of a greater difficulty, to account for a less. But having nothing to offer in the way of explanation, they for the most part held their peace. Still the thoughts of reflecting men naturally and necessarily simmered round the question. De Maillet, a contem- porary of Newton, has been brought into notice by Professor Huxley as one who uhad a notion of the modifiability of living forms." In my frequent con- versations with him, the late Sir Benjamin Brodie, a man of highly philosophic mind, often drew my atten- tion to the fact that, as early as 1794, Charles Darwin's grandfather was the pioneer of Charles Darwin. In 1801, апД in subsequent years, the celebrated Lamarck, who produced so profound an impression on the public mind through the vigorous exposition of his views by the author of the " Vestiges of Creation," endeavoured to show the development of species out of changes of habit and external condition. In 1813, Dr. Wells, the founder of our present Theory of Dew, read before the Boyal Society a paper in which, to use the words of Mr. Darwin, " he distinctly recognises the principal of natural selection ; and this is the first recognition that has been indicated." The thoroughness and skill with which Wells pursued his work, and the obvious inde- pendence of his character, rendered him long ago a favourite with me ; and it gave me the liveliest pleasure to alight upon this additional testimony to his penetra- tion. Professor Grant, Mr. Patrick Matthew, Von Buch, the author of the "Vestiges," D'HaUoy, and others,* by the enunciation of views more or less clear and correct, showed that the question had been fer- menting long prior to the year 1858, when Mr. Darwin and Mr. Wallace simultaneously but independently placed their closely concurrent views upon the subject before the Linnean Society. These papers were followed in 1859 by the publication of the first edition of the " Origin of Species." All great things come slowly to the birth. Copernicus, as I in- formed you, pondered his great work for thirty-three years. Newton for nearly twenty years kept the idea of gravitation before his mind ; for twenty years also he dwelt upon his discovery of fluxions, and doubtless would have continued to make it the object of his private thought had he not found that Leibnitz was upon his track. Darwin for two and twenty years pondered the problem of the origin of species, and doubtless he would have continued to do so had he not found Wallace upon his track. t A concentrated, but full and powerful epitome of his labours was the consequence. The book was by no means an easy one ; and probably not one in every score of those who then attacked it had read its pages through, or were competent to grasp their signifi- cance if they had. I do not say this merely to discredit them ; for there were in those days some really eminent scientific men, entirely raised above the heat of popular prejudice, willing to accept any conclusion that science had to offer, provided it was duly backed by fact and argument, and who entirely mistook Mr. Darwin's views. In fact the work needed an expounder ; and it found one in Mr. Huxley. I know nothing more admirable in the way of scientific exposition than those early articles of his on the origin of species. He swept the curve of dis- cussion through the really significant points of the subject, enriched his exposition with profound original remarks and reflections, often summing up in a single pithy sentence an argument which a less compact mind would have spread over pages. But there is one impres- sion made by the book itself which no exposition of it, however luminous, can convey ; and that is the impres- sion of the vast amount of labour, both of observation and of thought, implied in its production. Let us glance at its principles. It is conceded on all hands that what are called varieties are continually produced. The rule is probably without exception. No chick and no child is in all respects and particulars the counterpart of its brother or sister ; and in such differences we have " variety " inci- pient. No Daturalist could tell how far this variation could be carried ; but the great mass of them held that never by any amount of internal or external change, nor by the mixture of both, could the offspring of the same progenitor so far deviate from each other as to constitute different species. The function of the experimental philosopher is to combine the conditions of nature, and to produce her results; and this was the method of Darwin. J He made himself acquainted with what could, without any manner of doubt, be done in the way of pro- ducing variation. He associated himself with pigeon- fanciers - bought, begged, kept, and observed every breed that he could obtain. Though derived from a common stock, the diversities of these pigeons were such that " a score of them might be chosen which, if shown to an ornithologist, and he were told that they were wild birds, would certainly be ranked by him as well-defined species." The simple principle which guides the pigeon- fancier, as it does the cattle-breeder, is the selection of * In 1856, Mr. Herbert Spencer ("Principles of Psychology," 2nd edit. vol. i. p. 465) expressed "the belief that life under all its forms has arisen by an unbroken evolution, and through the instrumentality of what are called natural causes." + The behaviour of Mr. Wai lace in relation to this subject has been di&amp;rnified in the hiehest decree. t The first step only towards experimental demonstration has been taken. Experiments now begun might, a couple of centuries hence, furnish data of incalculable value, which ought to be supplied to the science of the future.</page><page sequence="9">JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. 841 some variety that strikes his fancy, and the propagation of this variety by inheritance. With his eye still upon the particular appearance which he wishes to exaggerate, he selects it as it reappears in successive broods, and thus adds increment to increment until an astonishing amount of divergence from the parent type is effected. Man in this case does not produce the elements of the variation. He simply observes them, and by selection adds them together until the required result has been obtained. " No man," says Mr. Darwin, " would ever try to make a fantail till he saw a pigeon with a tail developed in some slight degree in an unusual manner, or a pouter until he saw a pigeon with a crop of unusual size." Thus nature gives the hint, man acts upon it, and by the law of inheritance exaggerates the deviation. Having thus satisfied himself by indubitable facts that the organisation of an animal or of a plant (for precisely the same treatment applies to plants) is to some extent I plastic, he passes from variation under domestication to variation under nature. Hitherto we have dealt with the adding together of small changes by the conscious selec- tion of man. Can Nature thus select ? Mr. Darwin's answer is, " Assuredly ^he can." The number of living things produced is far in excess of the number that can be supported ; hence at some period or other of their lives there must be a struggle for existence ; and what is the infallible result ? If one organism were a perfect copy of the other in regard to strength, skill, and agility, external conditions would decide. But this is not the case. Here we have the fact of variety offering itself to nature, as in the former instance it offered itself to man ; and those varieties which are least competent to cope with surrounding conditions will infallibly give way to those that are most competent. To use a fami- liar proverb, the weakest come to the wall. But the triumphant fraction again breeds to overproduction, transmitting the qualities which secured its maintenance, but transmitting them in different degrees. The struggle for food again supervenes, and those to whom the favour- able quality has been transmitted in excess will assuredly triumph. It is easy to see that we have here the addi- tion of increments favourable to the individual still more rigorously carried out than in the case of domestication ; for not only are unfavourable specimens not selected by nature, but they are destroyed. This is what Mr. Dar- win calls " Natural Selection," which " acts by the pre- servation and accumulation of small inherited modifica- tions, each profitable to the preserved being." With this idea he interpenetrates and leavens the vast store of facts that he and others have collected. We cannot, without shutting our eyes through fear or prejudice, fail to see that Darwin is here dealing, not with imaginary, but with true causes ; nor can we fail to discern what vast modifications may be produced by natural selection in periods sufficiently long. Each individual increment may resemble what mathematicans call a " differential" (a quantity indefinitely small) ; but definite and great changes may obviously be produced by the integration of these infinitesimal quantities through practically in- finite time. If Darwin, like Bruno, rejects the notion of creative power acting after human fashion, it certainly is not be- cause he is unacquainted with the numberless exquisite adaptations on which this notion of a supernatural arti- ficer has been founded. His book is a repository of the most startling facts of this description. Take the mar- vellous observation which he cites from Dr. Criiger, where a bucket with an aperture, serving as a spout, is formed in an orchid. Bees visit the flower : in eager search of material for their combs they push each other into the bucket, the drenched ones escaping from their involuntary bath by the spout. Here they rub their backs against the viscid stigma of the flower and obtain glue ; then against the pollen-masses, which are thus stuck to the back of the bee and carried away, " When the bee, thus provided, flies to another fio wer, or to the same flower a second time, and is pushed by its comrades into the bucket, and then crawls out by the passage, the pollen-mass upon its back necessarily comes first into contact with the viscid stigma," which takes up the pollen ; and this is how that orchid is fertilised. Or take this other case of the Catasetum. " Bees visit these flowers in order to gnaw the labellum ; on doing this they inevitably touch a long, tapering, sensitive projec- tion. This, when touched, transmits a sensation or vibration to a certain membrane, which is instantly rup- tured, setting free a spring, by which the pollen-mass is shot forth like an arrow in the right direction, and ad- heres by its viscid extremity to the back of the bee." In this way the fertilising pollen is spread abroad. It is the mind thus stored with the choicest materials of the teleologist that rejects teleology, seeking to refer these wonders to natural causes. They illustrate, accord- ing to him, the method of nature, not the " technic " of a man-like artificer. The beauty of flowers is due to natural selection. Those that distinguish themselves by vividly contrasting colours from the surrounding green leaves are most readily seen, most frequently visited by insects, most often fertilised, and hence most favoured by natural selection. Coloured berries also readily attract the attention of birds and beasts, which feed upon them, spread their manured seeds abroad, thus giving trees and shrubs possessing such berries a greater chance in the struggle for existence. With profound analytic and synthetic skill, Mr. Darwin investigates the cell -making instinct of the hive-bee. His method of dealing with it is repre- sentative. He falls back from the more perfectly to the less perfectly developed instinct- from the hive-bee to the humble-bee, which uses its own cocoon as a comb, and to classes of bees of intermediate skill, endeavouring to show how the passage might gradually be made from the lowest to the highest. The saving of wax is the most important point in the economy of bees. Twelve to fifteen pounds of dry sugar are said to be needed for the secretion of a single pound of wax. The quantities of nectar necessary for the wax must therefore be vast ; and every improvement of constructive instinct which results in the saving of wax is a direct profit to the insect's life. The time that would otherwise be devoted to the making of wax is now devoted to the gathering and storing of honey for winter food. He passes from the humble-bee with its rude cells, through the Meli- pona with its more artistic cells, to the hive-bee with its astonishing architecture. The bees place themselves at equal distances apart upon the wax, sweep and excavate equal spheres round the selected points. The spheres intersect, and the planes of intersection are built up with thin laminae. Hexagonal cells are thus formed. This mode of treating such questions is, as I have said, representative. He habitually retires from the more perfect and complex, to the less certain and simple, and carries you with him though stages of perfecting, adds increment to increment of infinitesimal change, and in this way gradually breaks down your reluctance to admit that the exquisite climax of the whole could be a result of natural selection. Mr. Darwin shirks no difiiculty; and, saturated as the subject was with his own thought, he must have known, better than his critics, the weakness as well as the strength of his theory. This of course would be of little avail were his object a temporary dialectic victory instead of the establishment of a truth which he means to be everlasting. But he takes no pains to disguise the weakness he has discerned ; nay, he takes every pains to bring it into the strongest light. His vast resources enable him to cope with objections started by himself and others, so as to leave the final impression upon the reader's mind that, if th^y be not completely answered, they certainly are not fatal. Their negative force being thus destroyed, you are free to be influenced by the vast positive mass of evidence he is able to bring before you. This largeness of knowledge and readi- ness of resource render Mr. Darwin the most terrible</page><page sequence="10">8é2 JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. of antagonists. Accomplished naturalists have levelled heavy and sustained criticisms against him - not always with the view of fairly weighing his theory, but with the express intention of exposing its weak points only. This does not irritate him. He treats every objection with a soberness and thoroughness which even Bishop Butler might be proud to imitate, surrounding each fact with its appropriate detail, placing it in its proper relations, and usually giving it a signi- ficance which, as long as it was kept isolated, failed to appear. This is done without a trace of ill-temper. He moves over the subject with the passionless strength of a glacier ; and the grinding of the rocks is not always without a counterpart in the logical pulverisation of the objector. But though in handling this mighty theme all passion has been stilled, there is an emotion of the intel- lect incident to the discernment of new truth which often colours and warms the pages of Mr. Darwin. His success has been great ; and this implies not only the solidity of his work, but the preparedness of the public mind for such a revelation. On this head a remark of Agassiz impressed me more than anything else. Sprung from a race of theologians, this celebrated man combated to the last the theory of natural selection. One of the many times I had the pleasure of meeting him in the United States was at Mr. Winthrop's beautiful residence at Brooklyn, near Boston. Rising from luncheon, we all halted as if by common impulse in front of a window, and continued there a discussion which had been started at table. The maple was in its autumn glory ; and the exquisite beauty of the scene outside seemed, in my case, to interpretate without disturbance the intellectual action. Earnestly, almost sadly, Agassiz turned, and said to the gentlemen standing round, " I confess that I was not prepared to see this theory received as it has been by the best intellects of our time. Its success is greater than I could have thought possible." In our day great generalisations have been reached. The theory of the origin of species is but one of them. Another, of still wider grasp and more radical sig- nificance, is the doctrine of the Conservation of Energy, the ultimate philosophical issues of which are as yet but dimly seen - that doctrine which " binds nature fast in fate " to an extent not hitherto recognised, exacting from every antecedent its equivalent consequent, from every consequent its equivalent antecedent, and bringing vital as well as physical phenomena under the dominion of that law of casual connexion which, as far as the human understanding has yet pierced, asserts itself everywhere in nature. Long in advance of all definite experiment upon the subject, the constancy and indestructibility of matter had been affirmed ; and all subsequent experience justified the affirmation. Later researches extended the attribute of indestructibility to force. This idea, ap- plied in the first instance to inorganic, rapidly em- braced organic nature. The. vegetable world, though drawing almost all its nutriment from invisible sources, was proved incompetent to generate anew either matter or force. Its matter is for the most part trans- muted air; its force transformed solar force. The animal world was proved to be equally uncreative, all its motive energies being referred to the combustion of its food. The activity of each animal as a whole was proved to be the transferred activities of its molecules. The muscles were shown to be stores of mechanical force, potential until unlocked by the nerves, and then resulting in muscular contractions. The speed at which messages fly to and fro along the nerves was determined, and found to be, not as had been previously supposed, equal to that of light or electricity, but less than the speed of a flying eagle. This was the work of the physicist : then came the conquests of the comparative anatomist and physiologist, revealing the structure of every animal, and the function of every organ in the whole biological series, from the lowest zoophyte up to man. The nervous system had Ъееп made the object of profound and continued study, the wonderful and, at bottom, entirely mysterious, controlling power which it exercises over the whole organism, physical and mental, being recognised more and more. Thought could not be kept back from a sub- ject so profoundly suggestive. Besides the physical life dealt with by Mr. Darwin, there is a psychical life presenting similar gradations, and asking equally for a solution. How are the different grades and orders of mind to be accounted for ? What is the principle of growth of that mysterious power which on our planet culminates in reason? These are questions which, though not thrusting themselves so forcibly upon the attention of the general public, had not only occupied many reflecting minds, but had been formally broached by one of them before the "Origin of Species" appeared. With the mass of materials furnished by the physicist and physiologist in his hands, Mr. Herbert Spencer, twenty years ago, sought to graft upon this basis a system of psychology ; and two years ago a second and greatly amplified edition of his work appeared. Those who have occupied themselves with the beautiful experiments of Plateau will remember that when two spherules of olive-oil, suspended in a mixture of alcohol and water of the same density as the oil, are brought together, they do not immediately unite. Something like a pellicle appears to be formed around the drops, the rupture of which is immediately followed by the coalescence of the globules into one. There are organisms whose vital actions are almost as purely physical as that of these drops of oil. They come into contact and fuse themselves thus together. From such organisms to others a shade higher, and from these to others a shade higher still, and on through an ever ascending series, Mr. Spencer conducts his argument. There are two obvious factors to be here taken into account-the creature and the medium in which it lives, or, as it is often expressed» the organism and its environ- ment. Mr. Spencer's fundamental principle is, that between these two factors there is incessant interaction. The organism is played upon by the environment, and is modified to meet the requirements of the environ- ment. Life he defines to be a " continuous adjustment of internal relations to external relations." In the lowest organisms we have a kind of tactual sense diffused over the entire body; then, through im- pressions from without and their corresponding adjust- ments, special portions of the surface become more re- sponsive to stimuli than others. The senses are nascent, the basis of all of them being that simple tactual sense which the sage Democritus recognised 2,300 years ago as their common progenitor. The action of light, in the first instance, appears to be a mere disturbance of the chemical processes in the animal organism, similar to that which occurs in the leaves of plants. By degrees the action becomes localised in a few pigment-cells, more sensitive to the light than the surrounding tissue. The eye is here incipient. At first it is merely capable of revealing differences of light and shade produced by bodies close at hand. Followed as the interception of the light is in almost all cases by the contact of the closely adjacent opaque body, sight in this condition becomes a kind of " anticipatory touch." The adjust- ment continues ; a slight bulging out of the epidermis over the pigment-granules supervenes. A lens is in- cipient, and, through the operation of infinite adjust- ments, at length reaches the perfection that it displays in the hawk and eagle. So of the other senses ; they are special differentiations of a tissue which was originally vaguely sensitive all over. With the development of the senses the adjustments between the organism and its environment gradually extend in space, a. multiplication of experiences and cor- responding modification of conduct being the result. The adjustments also extend in time, covering con- tinually greater intervale. Along with this extension in space and time the adjustments also increase in speciality</page><page sequence="11">JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1&amp;74. 8é3 and complexity, passing through the various grades of brute life, and prolonging themselves into the domain of reason. Verv striking are Mr. Spencer's remarks re- garding the influence of the sense of touch upon the development of intelligence. This is, so to say, the mother-tongue of all the senses, into which they must be translated to be of service to the organism. Hence its importance. The parrot is the most intelligent of birds, and its tactual power is also greatest. From this sense it gets knowledge unattainable by birds which cannot employ their feet as hands. The elephant is the most sagacious of quadrupeds - its tactual range and skill, and the consequent multiplication of experiences, which it owes to its wonderfully adaptable trunk, being the basis of its sagacity. Feline animals, for a similar cause, are more sagacious than hoofed animals - atonement being to some extent made, in the case of the horse, by the possession of sensitive prehensible lips. In the Pri- mates the evolution of intellect and the evolution of tactual appendages go hand in hand. In the most intelligent anthropoid apes we find the tactual range and delicacy greatly augmented, new avenues of knowledge being thus opened to the animal. Man crowns the edifice here, not only in virtue of his own manipulatory power, but through the enormous extention of his range of experience, by the invention of instruments of precision, which serve as supplemental senses and supplemental limbs. The reciprocal action of these is finely described and illus- trated. That chastened intellectual emotion to which I have referred in connection with Mr. Darwin is, I should say, not absent in Mr. Spencer. His illustrations possess at times exceeding vividness and force ; and from his style on such occasions it is to be inferred that the ganglia of this apostle of the understanding are some- times the seat of a nascent poetic thrill. It is a fact of supreme importance that actions the performance of which at first requires even painful effort and deliberation, may by habit be rendered auto- matic. Witness the slow learning of its letters by a child, and the subsequent facility of reading in a man, when each group of letters which forms a word is instantly, and without effort, fused to a single percep- tion. Instance the billiard-player, whose muscles of hand and eye, when he reaches the perfection of his art, are unconsciously co-ordinated. Instance the musician, who, by practice, is enabled to fuse a multitude of arrangements, auditory, tactual and muscular, into a process of automatic manipulation. Combining such facts with the doctrine of hereditary transmission, we reach a theory of instinct. A chick, after coming out of the egg, balances itself correctly, runs about, picks up food, thus showing that it possesses a power of directing its movements to definite ends. How did the chick learn this very complex co-ordination of eye, muscles, and beak ? It has not been individually taught ; its personal experience is nil ; ]but it has the benefit of ancestral experience. In its inherited organisation are registered all the powers which it displays at birth. So also as regards the instinct of the hive-bee, already referred to. The distance at which the insects stand apart when they sweep their hemispheres and build their cells is "organically remembered." Man also carries with him the physical texture of his ancestry as well as the inherited intellect bound up with it. The •defects of intelligence during infancy and youth are pro- bably less due to a lack of individual experience than to the fact that in early life the cerebral organisation is still incomplete. The period necessary for completion varies with the race and with the individual. As a .round shot outstrips a rifled one on quitting the muzzle of the gun, so the lower race in childhood may outstrip the higher. But the higher eventually overtakes the lower, and surpasses it in range. As regards individuals, we do not always find the precocity of youth prolonged to mental power in maturity ; while the dulness of boy- ihood is sometimes strikingly eontrasted with the intel- lectual energy of after years. Newton, when a boy, was weakly, and he showed no particular aptitude at school ; but in his eighteenth year he went to Cambridge, and soon afterwards astonished his teachers by his power of dealing with geometrical problems. During his quiet youth his brain was slowly preparing itself to be the organ of those energies which he subsequently displayed. By myriad blows (to use a Lucretian phrase) the image and superscription of the external world are stamped as states of consciousness upon the organism, the depth of the impression depending upon the number of the blows. When two or more phenomena occur in the environment invariably together, they are stamped to the same depth or to the same relief, and indissolubly connected. And here we come to the threshold of a great question. Seeing that he could in no way rid himself of the consciousness of space and time, Kant assumed them to be necessary " forms of thought," the moulds and shapes into which our intuitions are thrown, belonging to ourselves solely and without objective existence. With unexpected power and success Mr. Spencer brings the hereditary experience theory, as he holds it, to bear upon this question. " If there exist certain external relations which are experienced by all organisms at all instants of their waking lives-relations which are absolutely constant and universal - there will be established answering internal relations that are absolutely constant and universal. Such relations we have in those of space and time. As the substratum of all other relations of the Non-Ego, they must be responded to by conceptions that are the substrata of all other relations in the Ego. Being the constant and infinitely repeated elements of thought, they must become the automatic elements of thought - the elements of thought which it is impossible to get rid of - the ' forms of intuition.' " Throughout this application and extension of the " Law of Inseparable Association," Mr. Spencer stands on totally different ground from Mr. John Stuart Mill, invoking the registered experiences of the race instead of the experiences of the individual. His overthrow of Mr. Mill's restriction of experience is, I think, complete. That restriction ignores the power of organising ex- perience furnished at the outset to each individual ; it ignores the different degrees of this power possessed by different races and by different individuals of the same race. Were there not in the human brain a potency antecedent to all experience, a dog or cat ought to be as capable of education as a man. These predetermined internal relations are independent of the experiences of the individual. The human brain is the "organised register of infinitely numerous experiences received during the evolution of life, or rather during the evolu- tion of that series of organisms through which the ' human organism has been reached. The effects of the * most uniform and frequent of these experiences have been successively bequeathed, principal and interest, and have slowly mounted to that high intelligence which lies latent in the brain of the infant. Thus it happens that the European inherits from twenty to thirty cubic inches more of brain than the Papuan. Thus it happens that faculties, as of music, which scarcely exist in some inferior races, become congenital in superior ones. Thus it happens that out of savages unable to count up to the number of their fingers, and speaking a language con- taining only nouns and verbs, arise at length our Newtons and Shakspeares. At the outset of this address it was stated that physical theories which lie beyond experience are derived by a process of abstraction from experience. It is instructive to note from this point of view the successive introduc- tion of new conceptions. The idea of the attraction of gravitation was preceded by the observation of the attraction of iron by a magnet, and of light bodies by rubbed amber. The polarity of magnetism and electri- city appealed to the senses ; and thus became the sub- stratum of the conception that atoms and molecules are</page><page sequence="12">844 JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. endowed with definite attractive and repellant poles, by the play of which definite forms of crystalline architec- ture are produced. Thus molecular force becomes struc- tural. It required no great boldnesss of thought to extend its play into organic nature, and to recognise in molecular force the agency by which both plants and animals are built up. In this way out of experience arise conceptions which are wholly ultra- experiential. The origination of life is a point lightly touched upon, if at all, by Mr. Darwin and Mr. Spencer. Diminishing gradually the number of progenitors, Mr. Darwin comes at length to one " primordial form ; " but he does not say, as far as I remember, how he supposes this form to have been introduced. He quotes with satisfaction the words of a celebrated author and divine who had " gradually learnt to see that it is just as noble a conception of the Deity to believe He created a few original forms, capable of self- development into other and needful forms, as to believe that He required a fresh act of creation to supply the voids caused by the action of His laws." What Mr. Darwin thinks of this view of the introduction of life I do not know. Whether he does or does not introduce his " primordial form " by a creative act I do not know. But the question will inevitably be asked, " How came the form there ? " With regard to the diminution of the number of created forms, one does not see that much advantage is gained by it. The anthropomorphism, which it seemed the object of Mr. Darwin to set aside, is as firmly associated with the creation of a few forms as with the creation of a multitude. We need clearness and thoroughness here. Two courses and two only are pos- sible. Either let us open our doors freely to the concep- tion of creative acts, or abandoning them let us radically change our notions of matter. If we look at matter, as pictured by Democritus, and as defined for generations in our scientific text-books, the absolute impossibility of any form of life coming out of it would be sufficient to render any other hypothesis preferable ; but the defini- tions of matter given in our text-books were intended to cover its purely physical and mechanical properties. And taught as we have been to regard these definitions as complete, we naturally and rightly reject the monstrous notion that out of such matter any form of life could pos- sibly arise. But are the definitions complete ? Every- thing depends on the answer to be given to this question. Trace the line of life backwards, and see it approaching more and more to what we call the purely phy- sical condition. We reach at length those organisms which I have compared to drops of oil suspended in a mixture of alcohol and water. We reach the protogenes of Haeckel, in which we have "a type distinguishable from a fragment of albumen only by its finely granular character." Can we pause here ? We break a magnet, and find two poles in each of its fragments. We continue the process of breaking, but however small the parts, each carries with it, though enfeebled, the polarity of the whole. And when we break no longer, we prolong the intellectual vision to the polar molecules. Are we not urged to do something similar in the case of life ? Is there not a temptation to close to some extent with Lucretius, when he affirms that " nature is seen to do all things spontaneously of herself without the meddling of the gods ?" or with Bruno, when he declares that matter is not " that mere empty capacity which philosophers have pictured her to be, but the universal mother who brings forth all things as the fruit of her own womb ?" The questions here raised are inevitable. They are approaching us with accelerated speed, and it is not a matter of indifference whether they are introduced with reverence or with irreverence. Abandoning all disguise, the confession that I feel bound to make before you is, that I prolong the vision backward across the boundary of the experimental evidence, and discern in that matter which we in our ignorance, and notwithstanding our professed reverence for its Creator, have hitherto covered with opprobrium, the promise and potency of every form and quality of life. The "materialism " here enunciated may be different from what you suppose, and I therefore crave your gracious patience to the end. "The question of an external world," says Mr. J. S. Mill, "is the great battle- ground of metaphysics."* Mr. Mill himself reduces external phenomena to " possibilities of sensation." Kant, as we have seen, made time and space " forms " of our own intuitions. Fichte, having first by the inexorable logic of his understanding proved himself to be a mere link in that chain of causation which holds so rigidly in nature, violently broke the chain by making nature and all that it inherit an apparition of his own mind.f And it is by no means easy to combat such notions. For when I say I see you, and I have not the least doubt about it, the reply is, that what I am really conscious of is an affection of my own retina. And if I urge that I can check my sight of you by touching you, the retort would be that I am equally transgressing the limits of fact ; for what I am really conscious of is, not that you are there, but that the nerves of my hand have undergone a change. All we hear, and see, and touch, and taste, and smell, are, it would be urged, mere variations of our own con- dition, beyond which, even to the extent of a hair's breadth, we cannot go. That anything answering to our impressions exists outside of ourselves is not a fact, but an inference, to which all validity would be denied by an idealist like Berkeley, or by a sceptic like Hume. Mr. Spencer takes another line. IVith him, as with the uneducated man, there is no doubt or question as to the existence of an external world. But he differs from the uneducated, who think that the world really is what consciousness represents it to be. Our states of consciousness are mere symbols of an outside entity which produces them and determines the order of their succession, but the real nature of which we can never know.| In fact, the whole process of evolution is the manifestation of a power absolutely inscrutable to the intellect of man. As little in our day as in the days of Job can man by searching find this Power out. Considered fundament- ally, it is by the operation of an insoluble mystery that life is evolved, species differentiated, and mind unfolded from their prepotent elements in the immeasurable past. There is, you will observe, no very rank ma- terialism here. The strength of the doctrine of evolution consists, not in an experimental demonstration (for the subject is hardly accessible to this mode of proof), but in its general harmony with the method of nature as hitherto known. From contrast, moreover, it derives enormous relative strength. On the one side we have a theory (if it could with any propriety be so called) derived, as were the theories referred to at the beginning of this address, not from the study of nature, but from the observations of men - a theory which converts the Power whose garment is seen in the visible universe into an artificer, fashioned after the human model, and acting by broken efforts as man is seen to act. On the other side we have the conception that all we see around us, and all we feel within us - the phenomena of physical nature as well as those of the human mind - have their * "Examination of Hamilton," p. 154. t " Bestimmung des Menschen.'1 X In a paper, at once popular and profound, entitled " Recent Progress in the Theory of Vision," contained in the volume of Lectures by Helmholtz, published by Longmans, this symbolism of our states of consciousness is also dwelt upon. The impressions of sense are the mere signs of external things. In this paper Helm- holtz contends strongly against the view that the consciousness of space is inborn ; and he evidently doubts the power of the chick to pick up grains of corn without some preliminary lessons. On this point, he says, further experiments are needed. Such experiments have been since made by Mr. Spalding, aided, I believe, in some of his observations by the accomplished and deeply lamented Lady Amberley ; and they seem to prove conclusively that the chick does not need a single moment's tuition to teach it to stand, run, govern the muscles of its eyes, and peck. Helmholtz, however, is contend- ing against the notion of pre-established harmony ; and I am not aware of his views as to the organisation of experiences of race or breed.</page><page sequence="13">JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. 845 unsearchable roots in a cosmical life, if I dare apply the term, an infinitesimal span of which only is offered to the investigation of man. And even this span is only knowable in part. We can trace the development of a nervous system, and correlate with it the parallel phenomena of sensation and thought. We see with un- doubting certainty that they go hand in hand. But we try to soar in a vacuum the moment we seek to compre- hend the connection between them. An Archimedean fulcrum is here required which the human mind cannot command ; and the effort to solve the problem, to borrow ал illustration from an illustrious friend of mine, is like the effort of a man trying to lift himself by his own waistband. All that has been here said is to be taken in connection with this fundamental truth. When ' ' nascent senses" are spoken of, when kt the differentiation of a tissue at first vaguely sensitive all over " is spoken of ; and when these processes are associated with " the modification of an organism by its environment," the same parallelism, without contact, or even approach to contact, is implied. There is no fusion possible between the two classes of facts - no motor energy in the intellect of man to carry it without logical rupture from the one to the other. Further, the doctrine of evolution derives man, in his totality, from the interaction of organism and environ- ment through countless ages past. The human under- standing, for example - that faculty which Mr. Spencer has turned so skilfully round upon its own antecedents - is itself a result of the play between organism and environment through cosmic ranges of time. Never surely did prescription plead so irresistible a claim. But then it comes to pass that, over and above his understanding, there are many other things appertaining to man whose prescriptive rights are quite as strong as that of the understanding itself. It is a result, for example, of the play of organism and environment that sugar is sweet and that aloes are bitter, that the smell of henbane differs from the perfume of a rose. Such facts of consciousness (for which, by the way, no adequate reason has ever yet been rendered) are quite as old as the understanding itself; and many other things can boast an equally ancient origin. Mr. Spencer at one place refers to that most powerful of passions - the amatory passion - as one which, when it first occurs, is antecedent to all relative experience whatever ; and we may pass its claim as being at least as ancient and as valid as that of the understanding itself. Then there are such things woven into the texture of men as the feeling of Awe, Reverence, Wonder - and not alone the sexual love just referred to, but the love of the beautiful, physical and moral, in nature, poetry and art. There is also that deep-set feeling which, since the earliest dawn of history, and probably for ages prior to all history, incorporated itself in the religions of the world. You who have escaped from these religions into the high-and-dry light of the understanding may deride them ; but in so doing you deride accidents of form merely, and fail to touch the immoveable basis of the religious sentiment in the emotional nature of man. To yield this sentiment reasonable satisfaction is the problem of problems at the present hour. And grotesque in relation to scientific culture as many of the religions of the world have been and are - dangerous, nay, destructive, to the dearest privileges of freemen as some of them undoubtedly have been, and would, if they could, be again - it will be wise to recognise them as the forms of a force, mischievous, if permitted to intrude on the region of knowledge, over which it holds no command, but capable of being guided by liberal thought to noble issues in the region of emotion, which is its proper sphere. It is vain to oppose this force with a view to its extirpa- tion. What we should oppose, to the death if necessary, is every attempt to found upon this elemental bias of* man's nature a system which should exer- cise despotic sway over his intellect. I do not fear any such consummation. Science has already to some extent leavened the world, and it will leaven it more and more. I should look upon the mild light of science breaking in upon the minds of the youth of Ireland, and strengthening gradually to the perfect dny, as a surer check to any intellectual or spiritual tyranny which might threaten this island, than the laws of princes or the swords of emperors. Where is the cause of fear? We fought and won our battle even in the Middle Ages : why should we doubt the issue of a con- flict now ? The impregnable position of science may be described in a few words. All religious theories, schemes, and systems, which embrace notions of cosmogony, or which otherwise reach into its domain, must, in so far as they do this, submit to the control of science, and relinquish all thought of controlling it. Acting otherwise proved disastrous in the past, and it is simply fatuous todiy. Every system which would escape the fate of an or- ganism too rigid to adjust itself to its environment, must be plastic to the extent that the growth of knowledge demands. When this truth has been thoroughly taken in, rigidity will be relaxed, exclusiveness diminished, things now deemed essential will be dropped, and ele- ments now rejected will be assimilated. The lifting of the life is the essential point ; and as long as dogmatism, fanaticism, and intolerance are kept out, various modes of leverage may be employed to raise life to a higher level. Science itself not unfrequently derives motive power from an ultra-scientific source. Whewell speaks of enthusiasm of temper as a hindrance to science ; but he means the enthusiasm of weak heads. There is a strong and resolute enthusiasm in which science finds an ally ; and it is to the lowering of this fire, rather than to a diminution of intellectual insight, that the lessening productiveness of men of science in their mature year.s is to be ascribed. Mr. Buckle sought to detach intellectual achievement from moral force. He gravely erred ; for without moral force to whip it into action, the achieve- ments of the intellect would be poor indeed. It has been said that science divorces itself from litera- ture : the statement, like many others, arises from Uok of knowledge. A glance at the less technical writings of its leaders - of its Helmholtz, its Huxley, and its Du Bois-Reymond - would show what breadth of literary culture they command. Where among modern writers can you find their superiors in clearness, and vigour of literary style ? Science desires not isolation, but freely combines with every effort towards the bettering of man's estate. Single-handed, and supported not by out- ward sympathy, but by inward force, it has built at le tat one great wing of the many-mansioned home which man in his totality demands. And if rough walls and pro- truding rafter-ends indicate that on one side the edifice is still incomplete, it is only by wise combination of the parts required with those already irrevocably built that we can hope for completeness. There is no necessary in- congruity between what has been accomplished und what remains to be done. The moral glow of Socrates, which we all feel by ignition, has in it nothing incompatible with the physics of Anaxagoras which he so much scorned, but which he would hardly scorn to-day. And here I am reminded of one amongst us, hoary, but still strong, whose prophet-voice some thirty years ago, far more than any other of this age, unlocked whatever of life and nobleness lay lat &gt; nt in its most gifted minds - one fit to stand beside Sócrates or the Maccabean Eleazar, and to dare and suffer all that they suffered and dared- fit, as he once said of Fichte, " to have been the teacher of the Stoa, and to have discoursed of Beauty and Virtue in the groves of Academe." With a capacity to grasp physical princi- ples which his friend did not possess, and which even total lack of exercise has not been able to reduci1, to atrophy, it is the world's loss that he, in the vigour of his years, did not open his mind and sympathies to science, and make its conclusions a portion of his mes- sage to mankind. Marvellously endowed as be Fas -</page><page sequence="14">Saß JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. equally equipped on the side of the heart and of the understanding - he might have done much towards teaching us how to reconcile the claims of hoth, and to enable them in coming times to dwell together in unity of spirit and in the bond of peace. And now the end is come. "With more time, or greater atrength and knowledge, what has been here said might have been better said, while worthy matters here omitted might have received fit expression. But there would have been no material deviation from the views set forth. As regards myself, they are not the growth of a day ; and as regards you, I thought you ought to know the -environment which, with or without your consent, is rapidly surrounding you, and in relation to which some adjustment on your part may be necessary. A hint of Hamlet's, however, teaches us all how the troubles of common life may be ended ; and it is perfectly pos- sible for you and me to purchase intellectual peace at the price of intellectual death. The world is not without refuges of this description ; nor is it wanting in persons who seek their shelter and try to persuade others to do the same. I would exhort you to refuse such shelter, and to scorn such base repose - to accept, if the choice be forced upon you, commotion before stagnation, the leap of the torrent before the stillness of the swamp. In the one there is at all events life, and therefore hope ; in the other none. I have touched on debatable ques- tions, and led you over dangerous ground - and this partly with the view of telling you, and through you the world, that as regards these questions science claims unrestricted right of search. It is not to the point to say that the views of Lucretius and Bruno, of Darwin and Spencer, may be wrong. Here I should agree with you, deeming it indeed certain that these views will undergo modification. But the point is, that, whether right or wrong, we claim the freedom to discuss them. The ground which they cover is scientific ground ; and the right claimed is one made good through tribulation and anguish, inflicted and endured in darker times than ours, but resulting in the immortal victories which science has won for the human race. I would set forth equally the inexorable advance of man's understanding in the path of knowledge, and the unquenchable claims of his emotional nature which the understanding can never satisfy. The world embraces not only a Newton, but a Shakspeare - not only a Boyle, but a Raphael - not only a Kant, but a Beethoven - not only a Darwin, but a Carlyle. Not in each of these, but in all, is human nature whole. They are not opposed, but supplementary - not mutually exclusive, but reconcilable. And if, still unsatisfied, the human mind, with the yearn- ing of a pilgrim for his distant home, will turn to the mystery from which it has emerged, seeking so to fashion it as to give unity to thought and faith, so long as this is done, not only without intolerance or bigotry of any kind, but with the enlightened recognition that ultimate fixity of conception is here unattainable, and that each succeeding age must be held free to fashion the mystery in accordance with its own needs - then, in opposition to all the restrictions of materialism, I would affirm this to be a field for the noblest exercise of what, in contrast with the knowing faculties, may be called the creative faculties of man. Here, however, I must quit a theme too great for me to handle, but which will be handled by the loftiest minds ages after you and I, like streaks of morning cloud, shall have melted into the infinite azure of the past. The returns of Mr. William Donnelly, the Registrar- Gen eral, of the flax crops in each county and province of Ireland in 1873 and 1874 have been issued. The total extent of land under flax in Ulster this year is 102,789 acres, as against 123,315 in 1873, being a decrease of 20,526 acres. In Antrim there is a decrease of 2,567 acres ; in Down, 4,726; in Monaghan, 2,866; and in Donegal, 3,079. EXHIBITIONS. ♦ EXHIBITION IN PARIS. (From a Correspondent.) The Industrial Art Exhibitions have opened with great éclat in Paris, and are attracting considerable numbers of people. The Governmental Exhibition was quite complete on the opening day, and there being no charge for admis- sion, visitors are not scarce. It is a splendid show, occupying one of the largest rooms in the Palais de l'Industrie, the productions of Sèvres occupying the whole of the central floor space, and the walls being covered with the tapestry of the Gobelins and Beau vais. Sèvres has sent its choicest productions of course in the way of porcelain, but the enamels on copper attract the most attention as being a comparatively new pro- duction of the National factory, and also on account of the great size of some of the examples, one plaque being very nearly five feet high. What is still more im- portant is that the colours are fine and harmonious, and the composition artistic. A very interesting feature also is a collection of the designs which have been used in the Sèvres works from the time of its establishment, a century and a-half. The Gobelins sends the panels for the New Opera- house, portions of tapestry carpets (unfinished), and a remarkable work after Andre del Sarto' s picture of "Charity." Beauvais presents no novelties, but a capital collection of tapestry for chairs, sofas, &amp;c, in its usual style. The exhibition of the Union Centrale, in another por- tion of the same building, is of great extent, and although not yet complete is full of interest. It occupies nearly as much space as the Annual Exhibition of Paintings and Sculpture. The works of the pupils in the public drawing schools present nothing novel, but they have a real interest. The retrospective collection of costumes and illustrations of the various periods is large and re- markable. It is divided into two portions - Dresses, royal, pontifical, military, and civil, and theatrical cos- tumes of all nations and periods ; and ancient works of art, illustrating costumes or parts of costumes, such as statuettes, medallions, vases, paintings, drawings, frescoes, and tissues. Amongst those which attract the greatest attention at present are a number of garments composed of Italian tissues of the sixteenth century, Persian, Indian, Chinese, and Japanese robes, and some armour of the finest workmanship. The collection of decorated furniture, bronze and other metal work, jewellery, enamels, and minor pro- ductions is fine, but it is not yet complete. A great charm in this, as in former exhibitions of the Union Centrale, but in which the present certainly surpasses its predecessors, is the evidence of a true artistic direction. On entering the central court of the Palais de l'Industrie the eye is at once attracted by the harmonious effect of the whole. The sides are hung uniformly with rich coloured stuffs, the names of the exhibitors is exhibited in handsome and uniform letters of gold, the stalls in the centre are elegant positions, and the whole is enlivened by flowers, fountains, and music, so that even without the exhibition proper the place has all the elegant attractions of a fashionable lounge. At the end of the central court, or nave, is an elegant double staircase which leads directly to the rooms above, in which are the costume exhibition and the drawings. A large sum of money must have been spent on the exhibition - the costume portion is said to have cost six thousand pounds- but its attractions are so great that it cannot fail of success. It may be mentioned here, for the benefit of those who think of visiting Paris, that the exhibition of the</page><page sequence="15">JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTd, August 21, 1874. 847 series of decorative works painted by M. Baudry for the grand saloon of the New Opera-house, now ready to receive them, is announced to open at the Ecole des Beaux Arts on the 20th instant. THE WATER SUPPLY TO THE CITY. On Monday last a report was issued to the members of the Common Council by the Gas and Water Com- mittee of that body, in answer to the question " whether any improvement can be suggested in the supply of water to the City of London, in case of fire," and some Other points referred to them. The report, after fur- nishing a statement of past legislation, refers to the pre- sent condition of the water supply of the City, which is received almost entirely from the New River Com- pany. The company have now provision for a continu- ous daily delivery of more than 36,000,000 gallons, with a present daily demand of about 25,000,000 gallons ; they also have a right to pump to any extent from the river Thames, below Blackfriars, for any service of a " non- domestic" kind, and can store about 150,000,000 gallons, all available for use in the City, where they have 78 miles of pipes, 25 miles of which are constantly under pres- sure. With regard to the water supply required for the extinction of fire, Captain Shaw reported that in the whole of the metropolis it had not been much in excess of 8,000,000 gallons, and that there had been no diffi- culty from any insufficiency of water supply in the City, whatever occasional delay there might have been in obtaining the service. The committee are of opinion that the system of street plugs, which makes the attend- ance of a turncock necessary before water can be obtained, is not suitable to meet the sudden emergencies which necessarily occur in every case of fire, and that it is absolutely essential for the protection of public property that a proper number of hydrants be fixed. As to their cost, it was a question whether it should be borne by the Corporation or the Metropolitan Board. Having in view the immense amount of property within the City, and the extensive fires which from time to time occur within its area, the committee think it highly desirable that the Corporation should take the lead in establishing a system which there could be no doubt would be a most useful adjunct in preventing the extension of fires. If the Court agreed with this, the committee asked that the report should be referred back to them to consider the means of carrying it out. The Straits Times (of Singapore) states that an assay of ten tons of quartz, crushed at Port Darwin, had resulted in. a yield of 771 ounces of gold. This gives a money return of more than £250 per ton. Victorian companies find that it pays to work reefs where the crushed quartz yields only five pennyweights, or gold to the value of about £1 per ton. The position of Port Darwin is very favourable to its future trade with Singapore, and it is sug- gested that it will be to the advantage of the colonists to make that place their entrepot. According to the report presented to Congress before the close of this year's session, there are in the United States 66,237 miles of railways, the combined cost of which amounted to 3,000,700,000,000 dollars. The relation between the mileage of railways and the population was, in 1873, in the ratio of one mile to every 582 persons. The length of railway in operation in France at the close of March, 1873, was 11,162£ miles. At the close of March, 1874, the corresponding total had grown to ll,601| miles, so that during the 12 months ending with March, 1874, new railway was opened in France to the extent of 439| miles. From the last Report of the Royal Society of Tasmania, it appears that the Society's Gardens were visited by 24,666 persons, and the Museum by 14,956 persons during the year 1873. The Society receives a Government grant of £400 for the gardens, and one of £200 for the museum. THE PROGRESS OF PORTUGAL. A series of papers upon the material progress of Por- tugal have recently appeared in the Memorial Diplo- matique of Paris, which are worthy the perusal of those interested in the well-being of that country. The survey extends over the last 22 years, commencing with the year 1851, when there was not a single kilometre of carriage road in the country, with the exception of the road from Lisbon to Cintra, and of another begun iit the direction of Oporto ; not a single railway ; not one regular line of steamers between the metropolis and its dependent islands and colonies ; the ports were silted up ; the rivers were without bridges, except a few built ages ago ; commerce was dying of atrophy for want of communications ; there were only two banks, one at Lisbon, the other in Oporto ; the post, conveyed by mules, left Lisbon only thrice a week ; and a journey from the capital to the frontier was longer and more expensive than a trip from Paris to St. Petersburg is now.. In 1873, Portugal possessed 3^500 kilos, of good roads, while fresh roads were still in course of construction throughout the country; 715 kilos, of railway in working, 131 kilos, more almost complete, and two new lines of which the works were already begun ; more than 200 bridges over the rivers and smaller streams ; more than 3,000 kilos, of telegraphic lines; improved har- bours ; regular lines of steamers subsidised by the State running between Lisbon and Algarve, the Azoresr Madeira, and the West African colonies. She has built during this period several large edifices for the service of the State, and raised many important monuments in honour of her great men or in commemoration of re- markable events in her history. The economical progress has not been less sensible. Several banks and discount establishments, with a large subscribed share capital, have been added to the two which existed in 1851 ; and it is calculated that the money investments of Portugal in national and foreign funds, and in shares or debentures of banks and public companies, had quadrupled in the fifteen years im- mediately preceding 1870, or, to come to figures, that whereas these commitments amounted only to 155,000,000 francs in 1854, they had risen to 600,000,000 frs.by the end of 1869. The opening up of means of communication and the development of credit exerted, moreover, their natural influence on trade. The sum total of exports and imports doubled in fifteen years. In 1851 they amounted to 116,500,000 frs. ; in 1867 they were 256,000,000 frs. Of this great increase, a large propor- tion was due to exports, the value of agricultural pro- duce exported in 1851 having been 34,000,000 frs., and 63,000,000 in 1867. The export of minerals, which in 1851 did not exist, amounted in 1867 to 5,000,000 frs., and has increased since then. During the same period the imports of raw material for manufactures rose from 15,000,000 frs. to 36,000,000 frs., while the imports of colonial produce, and especially of sugar, more than doubled. With regard to manufactures* although it may be said that they are for the most pari stationary, and dependent for their existence on a protective custom tariff, some branches, nevertheless, are in a fair way to emancipate themselves from this tutelage- It is not uncommon to find, in Lisbon warehouses, fine cloth manufactured in the country and yet resembling in quality those of Leeds or Birmingham, or silk fabrics dyed with certain colours which suggest a comparison with those of Lyons. Ordinary printing paper again is almost entirely furnished by Portuguese factories, while typography, which was so far behind -hand twenty years ago, has been perfected to such a degree that many of the books printed in Lisbon have nothing to fear from comparison with works issuing from the presses of the first firms in Parisand London. A great deal of good common earthenware, and even of fine faience, is now also produced in Portugal ; as well as some very good glass, both useful and ornamental.</page><page sequence="16">848 JOURNAL OP THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. This sketch, the writer maintains, resting as it does mainly on published statistics or facts which are notori- ous, cannot be accused of exaggeration, and it must be admitted that the surprising progress of this country, at the far extremity of the European system, is creditable both to Government and people ; while it promises, now that the greatest difficulties are overcome, and that a sure and liberal system has been, however timidly and haltingly, inaugurated, to proceed in an accelerated ratio to the development of a degree of material prosperity which it would be perhaps difficult to over-estimate. TRADE OF WESTERN GREECE. There is one portion of Western Greece possessing unusual interest which has been depicted by Vice- Consul Pandazy in his account of the trade that is carried on between Missolonghi and Acarnania. The town of Missolonghi is situated in the midst of a lake or lagoon on the north side of the outer Gulf of Lepanto. It contains about 6,000 inhabitants within its ruined walls, and 2,300 more in the immediate dependent villages, and it is the chief seat of the civil and military government of the Prefecture of Acarnania and JEtolia, with a total population of 110,000 souls. But Misso- longhi, in truth, is altogether a wretched place, accord- ing to European ideas. It has very few large houses, and their arrangements are completely opposed to all our notions of comfort ; the remainder of the buildings are of a miserable description, and covered with the fiJth of years ; its streets are intricate and squalid, and the general misery of the town is complete. The absence of British trade is solely attributable to the wretched etate of the port itself, as only small vessels can enter. The actual anchorage is at the Island of San Sosty, about seven miles distant, at the entrance of the lagoon, and the passage is marked by poles and trunks of trees stuck in the mud. In consequence of the inconvenience of this access to the coast, behind which is the rich vale of the River JEcheloüs, public attention has long been drawn to what could be done towards making this ¡nátur dly fertile district subservient to a larger foreign and domestic trade. The inhabitants have been for years pressing upon the Government to execute certain works which would give a commercial life to all Western ■Greece. The exports to foreign countries consist of valonea, tobacco, wool, Indian corn, and oats. Valonea is pro- duced chiefly in the woody districts of Acarnania, to the west of the River JEcheloiis. The fine quality, "chamada/ ' falls by itself in June, and the " grossa " is shaken off the trees artificially in September. The tobacco of this coast is of excellent quality, resembling the Turkish of YeDJe, the most abundant production being at Agrinium. The staple produce of the district is currants, amounting usually to 2,500,000 lbs. ; but this article does not figure in the foreign exports, as it all goes to Patras for export to England. One of the resources of the country is salt. There are two salt-fields on the coast, one of which pro- duces white salt, and the other so-called black salt, which is of a slightly grey colour. Compartments are made in the soil, the salt water of the lagoon is let in, and the process of evapora- tion by the solar rays completes the produc- tion, unless damaged by rain-water. The great article of export ought to be wheat, because the vale of JEcheloüs is both rich and well- watered ; but with no roads and with no port, the non- export of this and other articles is not surprising. The style of agriculture is тегу primitive - it is carried on by the inadequate and slow method now practised by the farmers in all Oriental •countries, the plough, with the oxen yoked together by a bar of wood ; and this is why large tracts of fertile land lie uncultivated, and the whole country is nothing but pasture land, timber, and plantations of valonea trees. The system of farming is a kind of voluntary renunciation of all interest in the soil on the part of the owner and the agriculturist. The owner gives his land and as much cattle as may be required to cultivate it, to a man who merely brings his labour and a family desti- tute of everything, and who, in consideration for some advances to live on and feed the cattle, engages to till the ground and take charge of the cattle, with the under- standing that he is to share at the harvest the produce of the one, and at sales the increase of the other. In this state of things the owner only thinks of making the most of his farmer ; in the first place he makes him pay half the taxes, and often pur- chase the seed. If there are many valonea trees on the farm, he will require half of this spontaneous production. In one word, the owner squeezes as much out of the farmer as he can ; on the other^hand, the farmer strives to live with the least possible labour to lay out the ground in pasture, because the profit arising from the increase of cattle costs him no trouble. The little he tills is to raise provisions of small value, fit only sometimes for his food, such as wheat, Indian corn, oats, &amp;c. Indeed, as such agriculturists have neither the will nor the means of paying wages, they can be helped in their labours only by their own family, which becomes for them, if not a fortune, an absolute necessity. The rest of the people consist of peasant proprietors, having a small holding, and shepherds, and of some families who have some trifling means ; but a much greater number are " klefts," or partners, and supporters of the "klefts," and these latter are confessedly the destroyers of the prosperity of the country. The Vice Consul remarks that the Greeks have made use of their opportunities to raise a respectable mer- cantile marine, and yet have shown complete incapacity to utilise the resources of the dry land. Possessing within the legitimate limits of their own kingdom, means of boundless wealth and prosperity, they occupy their minds with a hopeless desire for an extension of their boundaries. The spirit of the people in Western Greece is quite in favour of social equality, while the Government is practically absolute, the deputies being the nominees of the Central Government. The reason of this is that there is no large or influential proprietary class independent of the Go- vernment ; and Mr. Pandazy is not cognisant of the existence of a single country proprietor in his locality who lives with any degree of opulence or ease on his land, or who can exercise a patriarchal influence on the peasantry around him. Consequently the whole of the political power is in the hands of the Government. The subdivision of land is another cause of this state of things. Thousands of peasants, private soldiers, sailors, and even domestic servants, are all petty proprietors. The French education and ideas of so many young men have contributed largely to this passion for social equality as a substitute for political freedom. In the year 1873 there were coined in the Mint 2,382,832 sovereigns and 2,003,464 half-sovereigns, 5,965,740 florins, 6,486,480 shillings, 4,395,600 sixpences, 4,158 fourpences, 4,059,528 threepences, 4,752 twopences, 7,920 silver pence ; and of bronze, 8,494,080 pence ; 3,584,000 halfpence, and 3,225.600 farthing's. The pieces of money coined, therefore, exceeded 40,000,000 in number, and would pass for sums amounting to £4,500,000 sterling. The Sydney branch of the Mint coined and issued 1,478,000 sovereigns in 1873, and the Melbourne branch 752,000 sovereigns and 165,000 half-sovereigns. Analyses of a considerable number of wines have been made by M. С Mène, and communicated to the French Academy. The same ehemist has also published the resulte of a comparative examination of a number of beers, chiefly from French and Belgian breweries. The whole production of the precious metals throughout the world daring 1873 is estimated to have been worth nearly £44,000,000.</page><page sequence="17">JOURNAL OP THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. 8á9 CHANNEL PASSAGE. In an article on this subject in the Engineer the follow- ing conclusions are given as to the present aspect of the question. The writer says that " Recent experiments, which have not received much publicity, and the opinions of many eminent men in the profession, lead to the belief that there is, so far, a reasonable prospect of success in an attempt to drive a tunnel from the opposite shores of the Channel." He continues : - "If we sum up the opinions hitherto expressed by geologists and engineers respecting the Channel Tunnel, it will be found that while the former do not go so far as to deny the possibility of the undertaking, yet they enter- tain grave doubts of its feasibility. They unquestionably regard the scheme from a purely theoretical point of view, and possibly exaggerate difficulties which might occur, and imagine others which would never be present. Engineers, on the other hand, from the habit of dealing every day with the obstacles which are inseparable from the construction of any tunnel in which water is met with - and there are few in which such a contingency has not to be encountered and provided for - take a more hopeful view of the project. Without in any degree underrating the magnitude and importance of the work, and the heavy responsibility which it would entail upon all parties connected with it, they nevertheless consider it as differing more in degree than in kind from works of a somewhat similar character already successfully con- structed. As an instance of an obstacle which geologists regard as calculated seriously to imperil the success of engineering subterranean works, may be mentioned land springs. These certainly give a great deal of trouble occasionally, but no engineer would be deterred solely on their account from carrying out the undertaking. Assuming uniform conditions to prevail in the same strata, the remark of Sir John Hawkshaw is very appro- priate. He has observed that at a sufficient depth it is of no more consequence that the sea may be above the tunnel than a mountain. " It is admitted by geologists that a tunnel might be constructed with perfect safety under the Channel through the London clay, a well-known tenacious and impermeable stratum. Unfortunately for the practical adoption of this route, it would necessitate the tunnel being one hundred miles in length, or nearly five times the proposed distance. Consequently, however favour- able that stratum may be for submarine tunnelling, other obvious reasons altogether preclude the suggestion to use it. Geologically, the Kimmeridge clay might be made an available stratum, but only for about half the distance from shore to shore. As no one would be guilty of the folly of driving a tunnel halfway under the Channel, upon the bare chance of being able to carry it right through, this route must be likewise abandoned. We have nothing now left but the palaBozoic rocks, which, similar to the London clay, offer a sure and safe means of submarine intercommunication. But as the distance in the one case presents an insurmountable impediment, so the depth in the other proves equally fatal to the pro- ject. But besides these strata there is the lower or grey chalk. If it were once established that there were no open fissures in this formation, and that it was con- tinuous from shore to shore, the project would wear a different aspect. The private experiments of Sir John Hawkshaw with respect to the continuity of the chalk, while they cannot be received as actually confirma- tory, nevertheless tend to favour the supposition of con- tinuity. The question of fissures must remain a matter of conjecture, until some decisive experiment on a suffi- ciently extensive scale is undertaken, which will set the matter at rest. The cost of running preparatory drift- ways in order to determine the ultimate practicability of the scheme has been estimated at £80,000. It has been stated that the Great Northern Railway of France is -willing to contribute a portion of this, provided the London, Chatham, and Dover, and South-Eastern lines on this side of the Channel will furnish their quota. The proposition is fair and reasonable. Until some trial of this description is made it is idle to speculate upon the contingencies which may occur, or to enter into detaile respecting the character of the permanent structure. Thfr best form to be adopted, the most suitable materials, and the mechanical arrangements for their transport and for insuring ventilation, are all matters which it is quite premature to discuss at present." THE SILK INDUSTRY OF LYONS. The trade of the large and important city of Lyon» has not, according to the account given by Consul Mark, been of late years in a satisfactory condition, and as it depends largely for its prosperity upon the silk manufacture, which has suffered a serious depression, the state of affairs has led to much distress and suffering» Besides the pressure of a declining demand and adverse prices, both for the raw and manufactured material, pro- duction has diminished, and the result is no progrese, not to say worse. It is even to be doubted if Lyons is holding its own against the active and intelligent com- petition of Switzerland and Rhenish Prussia. ^ The rise in wages, the constantly increasing exigencies ^ of the weaver as to the nature of the work he will undertake, and the hard and fast line of tariff applied to labour, are- all so many elements in favour of the foreigner, and stumbling-blocks to the Lyonnese. No doubt so larger and educated an industry cannot fall in a day, but certainly it is more or less undermined. Another feature is the transfer of the looms from town to country villages adjacent, where living costs less and where the weaver can combine field with loom works, and so be content with less wages than in the town. la this way some 10,000 looms have, within the last few years, left Lyons, and with fhem have gone the majority of the journeymen, who formerly were so numerous ana so compact a body among the weavers. Workshop* formerly of eight or twelve looms now scarcely exceed four, and these are worked by the master himself and bis- immediate relatives (to the exclusion of the journeymen;),, who do not care to take more work than they can get through. Thej3e country looms introduce also into thj» manufacture of silks the female element, and in this- respect are followed by the power-looms, which are springing up wherever water power is to be met with in some outlying spots in this or the neighbouring de- partments. These power-looms are now very numerous, and they are principally worked by women, and it is to- their production that the dead level is owing which exists, and which replaces the decadence that would otherwise have been more marked. Within the last few years wages have much increased. For velvet weaving 50 to 60 per cent. ; for rich figured silks, 30 to 40 per cent. ; for plain silks, 15 to 20 per cent. Within two years only dyers have had to pay a rise of 10 to 12 per cent., and within a brief period the building trade, which employed some 25,000 persons, has established an advance of 25 to 30 per cent. According to the syndical report* the wages range from 45c. for unskilled to 70c. for, skilled men for the day of ten hours. OBITUARY. * Sir William Fairbairn, F.R.S.- Sir William Fairbaira died on Tuesday last, in his 83rd year, at Farnham, Surrey. He was the son of Mr. Andrew Fairbairn, of Smailholm. He was born at Kelso, in Roxburghshire, in the early part of the year 1789, and received hie educa- tion as a boy at a small school at Mullochy, in Bose- shire, subsequently acquiring his professional training at Newcastle-on-Tyne. He settled at Manchester in 1817, in partnership with Mr. LilHe, in conjunction</page><page sequence="18">850 JOURNAL OF THE SOCIETY OF ARTS, August 21, 1874. With whom his name rose to become that of one of the leading firms among the machine makers of that city. Mr. Fairbairn acted in conjunction with Robert Ste- phen son in the planning and execution of the celebrated feritannia and Con way tubular railway bridge across the Menai Straits. In 1850 he published in the Philo- sophical Transactions of the Royal Society his *' Ex- perimental inquiry into the strength of wrought-iron plates and their riveted joints, as applied to ship- building and to vessels exposed to severe strains." To him also we owe many useful researches into the causes of explosions in steam boilers. He was a Fellow of the Koyal Society, a Corresponding Member of the French Institute, an active or honorary member of almost every society connected with engineer- ing science in this country, and of many philosophical so- cieties ; and had received medals or other marks of recognition for his services to science from most of the crowned heads of Europe. He was one of Her Majesty's Commissioners for the Great Exhibition of 1851, and again took an active part in the organisation of the second Great Exhibition in 1862, in the same capacity. He was also a member of the jury of the Mechanical Department of the Great Exhibition of 1851, and acted as President of the Jury of the corresponding section of the Exhibition of Industry at Paris in 1855. In 1861 he occupied the position of President of the British Association for the Advancement of Science. He was created a Baronet at the recommendation of Mr. Gladstone, in 1869. The greater part of Sir William Fairbairn's acknowledged publications appeared in the Philosophical Transactions of the Koyal Society, in the Keports of the British Association, and in the Transactions of the Philosophical Society of Man- chester, in which he filled the chair at Dalton. Some of his works, however, were also published separately. Among his chief productions may be specified treatises on u Canal Navigation," on " The Strength and other Properties of Hot and Cold Blast Iron," on " The Strength of Locomotive Boilers," on "The Strength of Iron at Different Temperatures," on "The Effect of Repeated Melting upon the Strength of Cast Iron," on "The Irons of Great Britain," on "The Strength of Iron Plates and Riveted Joints," on " The Application &lt;xf Iron to Building Purposes in General," on " Useful Information for Engineers," &amp;c. Sir William became a member of this Society in 1843. He was a Vice- Président and member of Council for some time, and he for long took an active interest in its affairs. He con- tributed communications on various subjects, and on several occasions occupied the chair at meetings. GENERAL NOTES. *. The New Ironworks at Ontwood.- The Manchester Evening News says that a large blast furnace which has been erected at Outwood, near Manchester, by the Outwood Iron Company, has just been blown in. The works are interesting, inasmuch as this is the first attempt at manufacturing pig- iron that has been made in the neighbourhood of Man- chester; but, as they are situated in the centre of the manu- facturing and engineering district of Lancashire, it is believed that the whole of the pig-iron produced can be sold in the immediate vicinity at remunerative prices. Its construction has occupied upwards of two years. The works consist of a blast furnace, 70 feet high and 20 feet " bosh," which is fur- nished with six water tuyeres. The blast is heated by a series of four stoves, each stove containing about seventy tons of cast-iron pipes, and the blast itself is supplied by means of an engine, with a cylinder 90 in. diameter and 7ft. 4 in. stroke. The hot blast is delivered into the furnace at from 700 to 800 degrees Fahrenheit. The steam power is supplied from three boilers, each 45 ft. long, and these, together with the stoves supplying the hot blast, are heated Ъу means of the waste gas which is conveyed from the top of the furnace by gas mains fitted with safety valves, outlets, and burners. The furnace is capable of turning out 300 tons of pig-iron per week, and preparations have been made for a second furnace, which it is expected will be erected without delay, as the foundations have already been laid. When both furnaces are in operation, it is computed that the annual output will be 31,200 tons. Public Instruction in France. - A report, of which the following is a résumé, has lately been published by the Minister of Public Instruction in France. In 1865 the number of scholastic libraries was only 4,833, containing 180,854 volumes; in 1869 this number was increased to 14,395, containing 1,239Д65 volumes ; and at the present time there are, not taking account of those of the ^Department of the Seine, no fewer than 15,623 of these libraries, with 1,474,637 volumes. The number of books increase daily, and whilst in 1865 the number of volumes lent to families, pupils, and adults was only 179,267, in 1869 the number had increased to 955,121, and in the course of the past year the number of volumes lent was 925,358. These figures show plainly the incontestable benefits conferred upon the people by these libraries, and notwithstanding the political events of the last few years, the State, provinces, communes, and private individuals have not been behindhand in furnishing the requisite funds for maintaining such an important work. During 1873 upwards of 50,000 volumes were distributed by the Government to 1,181 libraries. Cotton Demand and Production. - The United States Economist believes that cotton is being over-produced. Ac- cording to that journal, the present annual consumption of cotton by the mills of the manufacturing world is in round numbers 2,500,000,000 lbs. Of this amount the United States work up 500,000,000 lbs., the United Kingdom, 1,200,000,000 lbs., and Continental Europe, 800,000,000 lbs. The present annual supply to the countries manufacturing cotton is :- By the United States (the total crop), 1,450,000,000 ; East Indies, 620,000,000 lbs ; Brazil, 50,000,000; Egypt, 210,000,000; other countries, 70,000,0001bs.; total, 2,500,000,000 lbs. This may be regarded as the normal demand and supply of cotton. As to the prospects of the immediate future, the supply to manufacturing countries during the coming year ending September 30, 1874, is at present advices estimated as follows .-The United States, 1,800,000,000 lbs. ; all other countries, 1,050,000,000 lbs. ; total, 2,850,000,000 lbs. This is predicted on the basis of a normal supply from other countries, and an increase of the American crop from 1,700,000,000 lbs. in the year ending September 30, 1873, to 1,800,000,000 lbs. this year. The demand is estimated as follows:- The United States, 550,000,000 lbs.; Europe, 2,150,000,000 lbs.; total, 2,700,000,000 lbs.
