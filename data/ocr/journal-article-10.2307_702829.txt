THE author first collects, paraphrases, and discusses the most important passages of Plato relevant to this subject, beginning with Rep. ii. and ending with Epinomis. In the light of this-the main-section of his work he proceeds to review the contributions of some twenty-seven exponents of Plato's theo- logy, from Zeller to Professor de Vogel, whose criticism of Dies's view ofr' 7rav1-EA6s 0v (Soph. 249 a: 'la somme totale de l'Ftre', accepted by Cornford and Ross) deserves to be better known. A brief final chapter recapitulates the difficulties which militate against any clear-cut solution. A twelve-page English summary adds to the usefulness of the book. van Litsenburg's treatment of the texts is candid, competent, and well informed, and he gives painstaking and sympathetic accounts of modern interpretations. His criterion is faithfulness to 'what Plato says'; and from this point of view, curiously enough (but, I think, justly), Shorey seems to tie with Solmsen for the lowest marks, while Dies, in spite of brevity and a tendency to outrun the evidence, receives the most commendation. Many confident arguments of modern com- mentators, deflated by the author's sober and unpretentions version of them, are seen to be extraordinarily flabby. Among these may be mentioned the contention that Rep. 597 b is not seriously meant, or the too facile evasion that there is a fundamental disharmony between Plato's metaphysics and his religious beliefs, or the considerations offered against identifying Plato's God with the idea of good. Here van Litsenburg repeatedly stresses that Plato does not explicitly make this identifica- tion himself; and, similarly, though he would like r6 7avEAh~3s c0v to refer to the 'absolute being' of God, he is at pains to make it clear that the context is concerned with logic and ontology rather than theology. On the other hand, having collected from the dialogues the attributes of Plato's Deity, he is fairly sure that neither the World-Soul nor the Demiurge, both of which really are called 'god' by Plato, represents the full Platonic concept of the divine: each is a partial, but not misleading, representation of the Deity. He is disposed to identify the Demiurge with his Model; but since this is a deduction from the text and not a statement by Plato in so many words, he pronounces the identity not proven. Thus although his sympathies, and the evidence which he deploys, appear to favour those who take a synthetic view (e.g. Jaeger, Hoffmann), his perhaps exaggerated respect for literalistic interpretation prevents him from going much of the way with them. In other words, he has not really faced the question whether behind the dialogues there was a coherent view or series of views, to which the commentator should provide a key by fitting together, without undue violence,</page><page sequence="2">THE CLASSICAL REVIEW 303 those portions of the puzzle which Plato has placed before us. There is, however, only one variety of constructive interpretation which he decisively rejects-that which proceeds on neoplatonic lines (Robin, Hardie, de Vogel). One important point is not explicitly brought out: the differing views of the moderns on the meaning of 'god'. Some, for example, think that a personal god must necessarily be anthropomorphic, though personality in- volves only soul and intellect, as Robin ob- served, and there is no objection to describing it in 'symbolic and mythical terms'. When quoting Symp. 2II c the author (p. 23) notes that he is using Robin's text. I wonder if this means that he found the cur- rent Oxford text untranslatable, as indeed it is: Burnet in the second edition rejected the final Co' (Schanz) of his first edition (c 6), adopted Usener's rEevewraat, but omitted to replace Kat by Usener's Eva before yvo (c 8).
