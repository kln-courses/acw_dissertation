<plain_text><page sequence="1">/9." Irish Reyj^o?sm and Continental Theory: An Intellectual Kinship EVI GKOTZARIDIS The purpose of this article is to advance the thesis that Irish history writing is informed by postmodernist preoccupations and themes. These latter can be traced in the general revision to which history has been submitted in Ireland since the late 1960s. Undoubtedly, those who are most likely to dismiss the connection between postmodernism and revisionism are also those who are not comfortable with the idea of a meta-history or for that matter with the proposition that philosophy has something to con? tribute to narrative history. Hayden White wrote: 'Historians have systematically built into their notion of their discipline hostility or at least a blindness to theory and the kind of issues that philosophers have raised about the kind of knowledge they have produced.'1 If this is so, it is because the majority, and particularly those in Ireland, are self-proclaimed staunch empiricists who view the theorizing of their own discourse as a diversion from their real work which consists in interrogating relevant primary sources. Another reason may be that they have always expressed a natural preference for probing into human agency and its infallible impact on the world. They believe in the importance of human decision and are readily inclined to see a direct connection between belief and action. That is why the poststructuralist attack on Man and on his promethean claims and spir? it, together with the provocative call for his decentering from the scheme of things, could only be very unpalatable tendencies for historians who fear generally that their promotion can only foster a passive and resigned atti? tude in people. This argument is not predicated upon some sort of rigid hierarchy wherein theory is implicitly considered primary or superior and history sec? ondary and inferior. Besides, in the context of Ireland it would be absurd GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001) 121</page><page sequence="2">and inaccurate to suggest this primacy of the theoretical discipline, since the first wave of historical revision predates the theoretical revolution that really began in the late 1960s on the continent. If anything, the opposite would seem to be nearer to the truth. Indeed, postmodernism's retreat from totaliz? ing theories could be potentially attractive to historians because it tends to confirm that they had been right all along, that their dominant practice of emphasizing the peculiarities, the ambiguity and untidiness of the past and displaying a measure of scepticism about the possibility of any durable prog? nosis or judgement on the whole had been qualities too hastily denigrated and jettisoned by theoreticians. Moreover, the reminding of the provisional ity and instability of historical concepts enshrined in the theory is not in principle totally absent from the historians' understanding of their practice, since the built-in obsolescence of diachronic temporality teaches them to be acutely aware of this phenomenon. Nor is the intention of this paper to argue that continental theory has directly forced on Irish historiography a reassessment of its methods or its choice of topics and therefore led to a shift in its emphases. Local historical factors and conditions, for instance the exis? tence of a strong tradition of political violence that had more than once threatened the status quo and the transposition in the realm of constitution? al arrangements through partition of the deep divisions among Irish people, constituted in themselves potent reasons for inducing a particular type of revisionism. What occurred, therefore, was not a mere crude borrowing, but rather a sort of natural congruity or harmony in intuitions, questions, sensi? bilities and in the common desire to cease genuflecting or, as Fran?ois Furet put it, commemorating indefinitely the revolution. Historians are a lot more radical than is usually admitted in other quarters, for they have dared to ask difficult, delicate and politically fraught questions. Owen Dudley Edwards, the son of one of the founding fathers of the new historiographical school, wrote recently that R.D. Edwards and T.W Moody were 'animated by their knowledge that history took lives in the worlds they came from [. . .] They wanted to shape schools of history, the products of which future generations could read with intellectual but not political profit, and above all without being driven to bloodshed by it.'2 The philosopher Richard Kearney explic? itly links his critique of nationalism to postmodern concerns: 'The translation of this textual strategy of deconstruction into political terms has [...] radical consequences for our inherited ideologies. All totalising notions of identity (imperial, colonial, national) are to be submitted to rigorous scrutiny in the name of an irreducible play of difference.' Historians seem? ingly sympathetic to the revisionist school, like M.A.G. O Tuathaigh, Kathleen Nutt, Nancy J. Curtin, Mary Daly, Geoffrey Roberts or revisionists themselves like F.S.L Lyons, Roy Foster, Ciaran Brady, Michael Laffan and 122 GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001)</page><page sequence="3">Tom Dunne have in various degrees made the connection between Irish revisionism and its European counterpart or between revisionism and theo? ry of the poststructuralist or postmodernist type. This awareness remains nevertheless sporadic and there does not seem to be any thorough investiga? tion of the political, philosophical and epistemological connections between Irish revisionism and continental theory. One way of teasing out the connection between postmodernist theory and Irish revisionism is to look at the respective criticisms levelled against both movements. The perceived threat in both postmodernism and revi? sionism often expounded by left-wing or nationalist intellectuals is something that ought to arrest our attention. On the level of epistemology they are both denounced on account of their natural inclination towards some sort of relativism whose main drawback is that it pre-empts the posit? ing of any moral or political judgment. The other remark proffered at these movements is that they tend to marginalize or displace the paramount ques? tions of truth and falsity and of cognitive evaluation which should be addressed in any theoretical or historical statement. According to their adversaries, the relativism intrinsic to these movements facilitates a certain kind of agnosticism founded on the assumption that the truth is so multi faceted that it is unknowable in the last resort and therefore it is pointless to strive for objectivity. This last remark is of course an extreme one and no self-respecting 'revisionist' historian would endorse such an assertion. But this is none the less how a certain kind of revisionism is perceived by its intellectual opponents in Ireland. On a political level they are attacked for being essentially conservative, if not reactionary, in that they are in favour of the preservation of the status quo and seek to demolish and cast doubts on the means, the rationale, the legitimacy and the accomplishments of the entire nationalist and Marxist endeavour of the twentieth century. For instance, Desmond Fennell (one of the most intransigent Irish critics of revisionism) is convinced that 'both in its ultimate thrust, and as a matter of objective fact, [it] is the historiography of the counter-revolution'.3 But let us come to the nub of the matter and underline the theoretical, philosophical and epistemological premises shared by both postmodernist theory and historical revisionism. Firstly, they have in common a distrust of a certain form of traditional committed politics and a concomitant desire to free man from 'the great enchantment'4 of ideology through an exercise of 'deconstruction' of the various grand narratives5 or monisms that have been prominent in the world. Indeed revisionists defend the idea of a history evolving outside the realm of predatory politics. They believe it is possible GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001) 123</page><page sequence="4">to establish a more objective history capable of simultaneously educating and reconciling the people of Ireland. That is why over the past twenty years they have called continuously for a depoliticization of the debate on revi? sionism. Nationalists, on the other hand, do not think it is possible to escape the overpowering influence of politics and are convinced that any attempt to do so in itself constitutes a political gesture whose terminus could only be the dissemination of an immense historical casuistry The revisionist con? ception of history and culture is essentially idealistic whereas the nationalist conception is positively materialistic. Secondly, there is also at their core the wish to ward off the dangers implicit in any excessive cultural and ethnic homogenization of society and thus a commitment towards pluralism, which in the case of revisionism translates into a retrieval of past potentials and enactments of harmony between the various denominations in Ireland. Thirdly, there is the attempt to highlight the contingency of one's identity by emphasizing the equal legitimacy of all communal values. A subversion is at work in both schools; a subversion intending to show that our ideologies, our politics, our preju? dices, our ready-made historical assumptions, all these things which we tend to view as indispensable components of our identity, are not organically possessed qualities but historical and social constructions that can be undone and reinvented in entirely different ways. The desired aim here is to hammer home the point that, as Alain Finkielkraut said, man is only part of a long chain and for this reason it is essential to revive a certain sense of humility inside him and teach him that other selves or beings are possible, products of another history and subjected to other fundamental codes.6 The theoretical basis of the entire work of Roland Barthes evolves precisely around this necessity to debunk myth by showing that, far from being a magical timeless appearance, it is instead the product of a particular histori? cal context. The role of the critical semiologist is to relocate myths in all the density of their historical context and therefore to increase awareness of the fact that what appears completely 'natural' is in reality utterly 'contrived' and that what assumes the posture of a universal truth is no more than a local ideological fabrication.7 Barthes' preoccupation with myth is echoed by T.W Moody s own concern with it. Indeed, Moody had identified a certain number of national myths, which according to him required an urgent debunking and deconstruction; among them he listed the myth of the depth and continuity of revolutionary nationalism, the myth of an essentialist Irish nation, the myth of the unwavering and absolute loyalty of the Ulster Protestants to the British crown, the myth of the premeditated massacre of 1641 and finally the myth of the so-called natural identification between William of Orange and the exclusive defence of the Protestant faith.8 Since 124 GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001)</page><page sequence="5">then Irish revisionist historians like Brian Walker9 or J.C. Beckett10 have fol? lowed Moody's advice and guidelines and set out to deconstruct these myths by describing and recalling the exact political and social environment that led to their production and consumption. The concept of contingency is a central one for postmodernism. Heller and Feher have argued that in pre-modern but also ostensibly in modern society, founding myths or reli? gion shrouded reality in an atmosphere of necessity, thereby rendering everything in life in some degree acceptable. Since it was believed that the past, the present and the future had been decreed by fate, it was futile to try and change the direction of history. Men were protected against the eerie experience of contingency. The attack on all universal theories founded on historicism, determinism and teleology which is implicit in the post? modernist project transformed reality into a multitude of possibilities. This realization was bound to elicit the fear of having perhaps missed out on what might have been if different options had been embraced and imple? mented. As a result of this awesome discovery, everything became provisional and potentially questionable.11 For Michel Foucault, historical enquiry made sense only as a method used to throw light on the fundamental revocability of the codes, signs and myths used in a given society. The function of historical knowledge was to reveal the 'immense and proliferating questionable nature (criticahilite) of things'.12 Hence the main thrust is to erode progressively the foundations of the dogmatism which is often an incontrovertible aspect of all traditions. This anti-foundational approach, to use a term borrowed from Derrida, which sets out to call into question the foundations of any authoritative dis? course, and to test its claims to legitimacy is also present at the heart of revisionist epistemology in Ireland. The questioning of the legitimacy of the 1916 Easter Rebellion, the questioning of the actual depth and continuity of the separatist movement and the search for periods in the past when Irish history might have escaped from its violent and divisive trajectory into a more benign and irenic path are in fact local indications of the deconstruc tionist strategies employed by postmodernism. In The Archeology of Knowledge, Foucault elaborates a new theory of history. He calls it 'archeolo? gy' because this method works against the grain of traditional history by reversing its disciplinary strategies. More to the point, it labours 'to untie all those knots that [. . .] have been patiently tied; it increases differences, blurs the lines of communication, and tries to make it more difficult to pass from one thing to another'.13 The Annales school had already rejected the assumption of a continuous evolution of reason and replaced it with notions of discontinuity, ruptures and breaks. Foucault thought that it was important for history to avoid anthropomorphism, the error of reducing the meaning GKOTZARIDIS, Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001) 125</page><page sequence="6">of texts to the intentionality of a fully coherent subject. Documents do not preserve silently the voice or the consciousness of the dead, but are simply 'monuments', inert traces whose accurate deciphering depends on the his? torian's resisting the habit to ascribe to them a human form, a unity and a familiarity that bespeaks needs that are within him or her and have therefore nothing to do with history as such. He wanted the historian to look upon history with a coefficient of strangeness, to re-introduce the temporal gap in his assessments and to avoid depicting a past in which he and his reader find a refuge for their consciousness, a domestic place devoid of the alien. Over identification, or lack of dissociation with the object of research led one to look to the past for a justification of his opinions and choices, for a sanctifi? cation of his own values, thus diminishing history to the level of ideology. Revisionist methodology has also reconstituted Irish history along more objectivist lines. In its treatment of the Easter Rising, for instance, the actors' consciousness does not organize or dictate the analysis of the causes of their action anymore. It has stopped taking the revolutionary discourse at its face value and has unearthed a maximum opacity between its subjec? tive claims and the real and objective meaning of the rising. It has ceased to portray the revolutionary consciousness as a natural outcome of oppression and discontent and shown that the invocation of a historical necessity hides a desire for justification. By highlighting the discrepancy and dissonance between the republican discourse and the state of social and political con? ditions prevailing on the eve of the rising, it has drawn attention to what Furet called the perpetual overbid of the idea against real history.14 Provocative and imbued with a Nietzschean sense of wisdom, it has dwelt on the un-heroic and human side of the revolutionaries and suggested that instead of being these god-like figures inspired by immaculate and purely unselfish motives, they were fallible, contradictory, ambivalent, prone to emotional insecurities and intellectual uncertainties. More generally, revi? sionist procedures seem to bear the mark of Derrida's deconstruction tactics. They arise out of the overturning of metaphysical and critical bina risms consisting in the reversal of hierarchies and the privileging of the second terms, traditionally seen as deficient, lacking, or simply derivative. According to Derrida, metaphysics has always sought to subordinate this second term because it was felt that it was the enemy of the logos (word), logic and reason. Its subversive powers had to be checked because it diluted the Truth, attenuated it and bleached it out. By choosing discontinuity, complexity, discrepancy, difference, chance, absence and play as cognitive tools, revisionist methodology has in turn contributed to the erosion of logocentrism. Finally, it has proved that nationalist history is not an impreg? nable intellectual edifice but a discourse saturated with discordant voices 126 GKOTZARIDIS, Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001)</page><page sequence="7">that were deliberately silenced, and riddled with cracks and holes that were hastily filled up. Revisionism enjoins us to pay more attention to those areas of uncertain? ty or ignorance whose importance the nationalist discourse had glossed over, simplified or underplayed because they compromised its political objectives. It is a recuperative history whose speculative search for the truth rests on a sort of symptomatic or interstitial reading of the evidence. Lyotard suggested that postmodernism is like a form of psychoanalytic therapy, whereby hidden meanings in Western cultural history are brought to the surface, thus breaking a cycle of repression. He wrote: 'The "post" of "post? modern" does not signify a movement of repetition but a procedure in "ana": a procedure of analysis, anamnesis, anagogy and anamorphosis which elaborates an "initial forgetting".'15 As Georges Duby put it, postmodernist history tends to view evidence no more like a magnifying glass through which one can have access to the past instantly but more like the brush? strokes used by the painter to achieve a certain effect.16 The most interesting evidence is that to be found in what is not said, in what a period has omit? ted to say about itself. In the Irish case the recovery of dissident voices that had been retrospectively smothered and discredited by the separatist tradi? tion, like Eoin MacNeill's memoranda, Francis Sheehy Skeffington's letter to Thomas MacDonagh on the dangers of militarism and Redmond's policy of conciliation, are interesting in so far as they reveal a more humane, compas? sionate and responsible side to the Irish revolution, and more importantly because they resemble photo negatives conveying precious insights into the underlying motives and fears of the Easter rebels and the hidden rationale of the rising. Unsurprisingly, these testimonies carry also their own degree of subversion because they can dessentialize and delegitimize the event. They are the pharmakon (poison or cure; Derrida plays on the ambiguity of the word) or the undecidable since they are both inside and outside the nationalist discourse. They are inside it since these men belong irrefutably to the nationalist family and they are also outside it because they criticize or cast doubts on its evolution and methods, undermining the overall and seeming clarity of its logic and the purity of its ethics. As such, they consti? tuted a threat to the republican cause and that is why a nationalist historiography anxious to buttress the foundations of a new state and to give the impression of a perfect consensus underpinning this state, silenced them or cast them out by simply condemning them. In Writers and Politics, pub? lished in 1965, Conor Cruise O'Brien wrote: My own guess is that the liberation of the communist world and of the poor world, from their crude forms of mendacity, will have to proceed from within and the liberation of the Western world from its subtler and GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001) 127</page><page sequence="8">perhaps deadlier forms of mendacity will also have to proceed from within. From the other side we can hear a few writers, Poles, Russians, Hungarians and others, busily chipping away. Our applause can neither encourage nor help them. What might help them would be that, from our own side also, should be heard the sound of chipping.17 This was a prescient statement since the Eastern bloc's chipping from within was to have its effect a quarter of a century later. Besides the similari? ty in the language and the use of the word 'chipping' having undeniable Derridian accents, it is the exhortation to carry the critique of a tradition from within which conveys most convincingly the idea of an implicit iden? tity between the revisionist project and the deconstructionist one. Derrida believes that deconstruction is more efficient and more subtle than down? right revolution because the undecidables do not simply reject or oppose a discourse. Instead they disrupt the binary structures of oppositions since they play all ways and refuse to take sides.That is why the undecidable that won't be fixed down is dangerous because if it is correctly identified and his dis? ruptive play intensified, it has the power to shake at the core by sending a tremor through the entire structure. Revisionism has challenged strict colo? nial identitarian dichotomies by showing that these did not adequately reflect the reality of social and cultural relations in the past. And in doing so, it has also necessarily questioned the reasonableness and the wisdom of an 'either/or' or 'us versus them' rationale of extreme nationalism; proving therefore that it is both in spirit and method deconstructionist. Desmond Fennell accused revisionists of having abandoned the battle between good and evil and Michael Laffan replied that historians had indeed committed these faults and made no apology for them.18 Roy Foster explained that re? visionism's virtues were an ability to appreciate half-tones, to be sceptical about imputing praise or blame, to separate contemporary intentions from historical effects.The aim was to explore nineteenth- and twentieth- century Irish politics in all their density, sophistication, ramifications, complexity and ambiguity. Revisionist history has indeed averted its attention from the search of an original sin and culprit, and of an overriding evil act determin? ing all the subsequent evolution of Ireland's trajectory, and that is why it cannot be ethical in the traditional sense of the word. Here again, in its refusal to yield to the emotional comforts of ontology, it displays a profound? ly deconstructionist turn of mind and sensibility. In his essay, Structure, Sign and Play, Derrida opposes two types of thinking; the first dreams of decipher? ing a truth or origin which escapes play; the other turns away from origin and affirms play. Derrida seems to be saying that if man is to establish a more intimate rapport with truth then he will have to relinquish the dream of full presence: the reassuring foundation, the origin and the end of play.19 128 GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001)</page><page sequence="9">In order to give one example of this new historical attitude, let us exam? ine an article by Paul Bew published in the Irish Review. Bew's main argument is that the political displacement and final collapse of the old Irish Parliamentary Party led by John Redmond signalled the demise of the mid? dle ground or the third camp in Irish politics and in addition had disastrous consequences for the future of the North. Conceding that by 1914 partition had already been contemplated and in some fundamental ways ratified by the Government of Ireland (Amendment Bill) on 23 June, he none the less puts forward the thesis that the 1916 Rising and its leaders' alliance with Germany greatly strengthened the Ulster Unionist bargaining position with the British state. His opinion is that Redmond's strategy of support for the British war effort had been designed to ensure a maximum degree of influ? ence for the nationalist side when the final arrangements for the north-eastern 'excluded areas' were sorted out. Redmond's support for the war aimed also at promoting better relationships with Unionist leaders, thus opening possibilities for a future unification of the island. According to Bew, this whole strategy was destroyed by the Easter Rising. As a direct result of this, the Unionists were placed in a much stronger bargaining position on account of their unconditional support for Britain during the war. Bew adds that: 'History, of course, can not be rewritten but it is worth acknowledging the cost of the choices actually taken in 1916.'20 The revisionist historian refutes the idea of the inevitability of the radical split between Ulster and the rest of Ireland and suggests that nationalist Ireland would have been sat? isfied with a limited form of Home Rule government. Mary Daly has a different opinion in that she thinks that if we locate events and conditions of that period within a European framework then the idea of the rebellion as a 'technical coup' cannot be substantiated itself. Therefore she does not think that without the rebellion, the 1918 general election would have returned a moderate Redmondite majority and she supports this view by arguing that Ireland was under the inescapable influence of the various forces that raged throughout European society during these years.21 Clearly, even if one does not agree with Bew's hypotheses and deduc? tions, it is still worth noticing that his thesis seems to be modelled on Roy Foster's definition of revisionism, which sees it as 'quite simply a desire to eliminate as much as possible of the retrospectively "Whig" view of history, which sees every event and process in the light of what followed rather than what went before; the effort to get behind hindsight. Along the way, many simple assumptions need to be questioned.'22 The interrogation of an obsessively teleological and determinist nationalist historiography is there? fore at the core of revisionist methodology and echoes in a perfect way the postmodernist rejection of historicism. Roy Foster also said that revisionism GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001) 129</page><page sequence="10">signalled an end once and for all to 'the compelling Manichean logic of the old "Story of Ireland", with a beginning, a middle and what appeared (up to about 1968) to be a triumphant end'.23 History does not conceal any essen? tialist purpose or direction, it cannot be subjected to any sustained rationalization and it is not providential. Postmodernism seeks to defend the view that a great number of the consequences or outcomes produced by history are unintentional. Lyotard wrote on this precise topic: 'It is necessary that something happens, the occurrence (event), but what happens [. . .] is never necessary'24 In Peregrinations, Lyotard wrote : What if history and thought did not need this synthesis; what if the paradoxes had to remain paradoxes, and if the equivocacy of these uni versals, which are also particulars, must not be sublated? What if Marxism itself were in its turn one of those particular universals which it was not even a question of going beyond ? an assumption that is still too dialectical - but which it was at the very least a question of refuting in its claim to absolute universality, all the while according it a value in its own order?25 In this statement Marxism declines from the status of universal theory to one of a plurality of incommensurable discourses. In a way it is possible to say that through revisionism, Irish nationalism was also dethroned. This dethronement has in turn led to a sort of loss of inhibition and thus to a lib? eration on the part of Unionist intellectuals, who have since sought to establish a body of political and literary criticism drawn specifically from the Protestant community. In both schools therefore, there seems to be a reluc? tance to contemplate closure or synthesis and a parallel desire to sustain the tensions. Both postmodernism and revisionism have been instrumental in unsettling hierarchies of meanings, that is to say the notion that some mean? ings (theories) were superior, deeper or more fundamental than others. The realization of the obsolete and often inadequate character of global solutions is also part of the postmodernist and revisionist philosophical view of the world. Arising from this is a consciousness of the disjunction between the claims of theory and the incommensurability of reality and political prac? tice. Thus the majority of Irish historians, nationalist and revisionist alike, or even Marxist, have acknowledged that Ireland is the site of a revolutionary project that has failed in many respects. The grand narrative of a unifying and republican nationalism failed to convince the one million Unionists of the existence of a shared identity and destiny between all the ethnic con? stituents of the Irish people. The collision between two communities with diametrically opposed identitarian visions and political goals has been so final that some revisionists went as far as to propound the highly 130 GKOTZARIDIS, Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001)</page><page sequence="11">contentious idea of'two nations'. Another common characteristic is a pal? pable turn away from the revolution, its heroic dimension and its legacy. Irish revisionism has displayed a scepticism and irreverence in its critical assessment of the revolutionary period that has bordered on cynicism and apostasy. The new historical interpretation has indeed shifted in its original emphasis; that is to say, instead of its traditional glorification and uncondi? tional support for its completion we now find an underplaying of the continuity of the revolutionary impulse and a praise for constitutional and parliamentary modes of social mutation and emancipation.26 In December 1971 during a lecture designed to commemorate the fiftieth anniversary of the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, the historian F.S.L. Lyons stated: In the present situation, with the dire past still overhanging the dire pre? sent, the need to go back to fundamentals and consider once more the meaning of independence, asserts itself with almost intolerable urgency. The theories of revolution, the theories of nationality, the theories of his? tory, which have brought Ireland to its present pass, cry out for re-examination and the time is ripe to try to break the great enchant? ment which for too long has made myth so much more congenial than reality.27 It is an irrefutable fact that this statement was prompted largely by the debilitating conflict in Northern Ireland and it is true also that there is a clear tendency among certain revisionists to charge and blame nationalist myth and memory, rather than fifty years of Unionist majority rule and democratic deficit, with primary responsibility for the outbreak of vio? lence in the province28. But this famous quotation from Lyons strikes us more fundamentally for its undeniable postmodern accents. The apocalyp? tic revaluation of all the core values of Irish society that is prophesised by the historian's statement carries something of the passion, the anxiety, the emotional turmoil together with the sense of urgency that can also be detected in the writings of the most political figure of the postmodernist movement; Jean-Fran?ois Lyotard. Moreover, the repetition of the word 'theory' reveals something of the obsession with it, and of the general assault against it carried out by the postmodernist iconoclastic venture. Theories are held responsible for the political impasse in Northern Ireland and this hypothesis seems to be profoundly in keeping with the postmod? ernist intuition, best exemplified by Lyotard's political writings, especially those dealing with the Algerian question, that theory, instead of being helpful and illuminating, has become in fact a very big part of the prob? lem.29 The primary targets of postmodernism are Marxism and structuralism. The primary target of revisionism is republican and Catholic GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001) 131</page><page sequence="12">nationalism, and in the case of Marxist Irish revisionism, the attack is on anti-imperialist Marxism of the James Connolly school. But beyond the different targets involved, there is at the heart of postmodernist and re? visionist epistemology and methodology a strong presumption of the limits of theory. As Gilbert Larochelle wrote: 'The intellectual program of the interpreters of post-modernity appears, in sum, centred on a theoriza tion of the limits of theory.'30 Moreover there is also the disquieting belief that theories of the kind conceived by Karl Marx, G.W.F. Hegel, Johann Herder, Wilhelm Riehl and Johann Fichte, whose main precepts were adapted to the Irish context by intellectuals like James Connolly, Patrick Pearse or DP. Moran, were intrinsically dangerous for they were all based on the principle that 'the end justifies the means' or on some obscure and aggressive notion of the superiority of the Celtic race. It was therefore in the very nature of both communism and nationalism to engender, con? done and justify violence. There was something corrupted, rotten to the core in these theories, and reality under the nightmarish form of the Shoa, the gulags and the ethnic cleansing mentality of many European nation? alisms (the latest example being the war in ex-Yugoslavia) confirmed this. Albert Camus, the pied-noir Algerian writer, had been in fact one of the first among the western intelligentsia to condemn equally theories of class and nationality. For him fascism and communism had been at some funda? mental level similar because they had justified their mass killing in the name of some infallible doctrine. Both had used the perfect alibi provided by philosophy to give logic and reason to what was totally demented and unjustifiable. In this respect, Irish nationalism does not constitute an exception, and some revisionists deem that as a micro-replica of its Euro? pean counterparts, it had, inscribed in itself, the same violent and destructive potential. I would like to draw attention to two other state? ments made by Lyons and bring them into parallel with what Albert Camus declared on receiving his Nobel Prize for Literature. In his conclu? sion to Culture and Anarchy, F.S.L. Lyons wrote: The true anarchy during the period from the fall of Parnell to the death of Yeats [. . .]was not primarily an anarchy of violence in the streets, of contempt for law and order such as to make the island, or any part of it, permanently ungovernable. It was rather an anarchy in the mind and in the heart, an anarchy which forbade not just unity of territories, but also 'unity of being', an anarchy that sprang from the collision within a small and intimate island of seemingly irreconcilable cultures, unable to live together or to live apart, caught inextricably in the web of their tragic history.31 132 GKOTZARIDIS, Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001)</page><page sequence="13">Again, this passage is highly symptomatic of the paradigmatic shift regis? tered in both historical revisionism and postmodernist theory. I am referring here to the adoption of the endogenous paradigm. These two schools are haunted by a vision of the thorough ideologization of man, in other words his internalization of power. This internalizing of power structures turns into something monstrous and unleashes chronically its lethal violence on society. Lyons' emphasis on the harm done by theories and his presentiment of an anarchy of the heart and mind forbidding unity of territories is curi? ously reminiscent of the theoretical literature produced by the French poststructuralist school. In Libidinal Economy, Lyotard speaks of the body as the site of libidinal forces which ultimately can neither be understood, nor explained or even checked. Faced with these mysterious energies working unbidden through us, the only thing left to do is to 'bear witness' to their inexplicability. This chaos, consubstantial with the mind resists political and theoretical closure and because it precedes political economy, theory is doomed to failure when any attempt is made to turn it into practice. Angry and remorseless in his attack against the left, he decides that there is no point in engaging in dialogue with socialism, because it will 'always confuse power and force'.32 Michel Foucault went further by suggesting that this distinction was superfluous. Indeed, when trying to understand how much freedom man was deprived of, he ended up collapsing the opposition between ideas and material existence altogether and abandoning entirely the category of ideology. There is no point in speaking of ideology or power any more since ideology has invaded and settled in the innermost recesses of man. Using the ominous image of the panopticon prison to describe how rationally power functions in modern society, he explained that man had become his own warder through a means of intensively 'individualizing' techniques of scrutiny and bodily control. With the use of just one inspect? ing gaze, a gaze which each individual under its weight ends up interiorizing, a very efficient technology of control had been devised and refined over the centuries to enable the irrigation of effects of power down to the smallest particles of the social body and, no doubt more importantly, down to the smallest particles of the human body and mind, influencing therefore its gestures, its daily actions, if not its dreams, beliefs and desires.33 Positioned from that angle, one is bound sooner or later to query the authenticity of any form of resistance or any desire for liberation and to believe that these are also the effects of precise techniques of power. Lyons' conclusion, with its undertones of intense distress at the sight of two enemies inexorably locked into an agonistic view of each other, has GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001) 133</page><page sequence="14">something of the postlapsarian quality of the postmodern vision of man. Ideology has won the battle over man. It holds sway so much over his mind that man has forgotten his essential humanity and Christianity and the fact that in the case of Northern Ireland, the two warring factions belong to the Christian family. Ideology has therefore succeeded in erasing within him the perception of a basic solidarity and brotherhood. Lyons' degree of despondency is such that it leads him to challenge his own peculiar brand of ideological illusion based on an irenic view of history. Indeed, the Anglo-Irish Olympians to which he belonged, had always striven with an unerring optimism to smooth the path for some sort of reconciliation between the extremes and displayed a tendency to underplay the impor? tance of religious and cultural fault-lines in favour of the vision of some deeper unity that simply needed to be re-discovered for the benefit of all. Lyons' loss of faith in his role of mediator, in his ability to perfect a rap? prochement is implicit throughout the whole book and stems from his traumatic realization that culture, instead of being a potential unifying force in a fragmented society ? a barrier against anarchy as Matthew Arnold used to expound it ? is in fact entirely complicit with it. In his own words, the co-existence of several cultures, related yet distinct, made it impossible for Irishmen to acquire a coherent view of themselves in rela? tion to each other and to the outside world. And he added: 'This malaise is both more deep-seated and harder to cure than the potential instability with which we are all familiar, and of which it is a prime cause.' His deci? sion to destroy the mistaken assumption on culture embedded in his political tradition reminds one of Lyotard's decision to disprove the notion of false consciousness that had been so central to the logic of Marxism. Psychologically and politically, both writers seem to be flirting with a near nihilism. The view that one has to reconcile oneself with the unthinkable, that there is no solution available within the traditional limits of theory because it suffers from an inherent and irreparable weakness, and that con? frontation and the will for domination are iron-branded in man's psyche and therefore not easily expungeable, can be guessed through the inter? stices of Lyons' solemn conclusion. His final words were clearly not lost on Irish historians, who chose paradoxically to interpret them as a sort of ral? lying cry for the cause of a cultural history conceived to dissect the functioning of ideology and to retrieve or salvage once more, as Roy Fos? ter put it, 'liberal, synthesizing historiography'.34 For one thing is sure, Lyons' defeatist intervention had also represented an indirect attack against a revisionist school, which, although fully aware of the ideological barriers since it had sought to break them down for at least forty years, had also in a characteristic posture of voluntaristic and idealistic self-confidence believed 134 GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001)</page><page sequence="15">that its work of correction and d?mythification would be sufficient to bring about a real change in mentalities and in the drab political reality of Northern Ireland. Already in 1958, in one of his Algerian pieces, Lyotard wrote: 'We have to get rid of a certain kind of patronizing Marxism. An ideology has no less reality (even and above all if it is false) than the objec? tive relations to which this Marxism wants to reduce it.'35 There is a sense in which Lyons was warning the revisionist school against the same patronizing sin, pointing out to it the limits of its positivist pretensions and underlining the very real, material and lingering effects of ideologies. In his overview of the social-science literature on the Northern Irish conflict, John Whyte concluded that 'The internal-conflict approach [was] close to becoming "a dominant paradigm",'36 indicating by this that Lyons' thesis had also become fashionable among other researchers. Desmond Bell stated that this approach was part of a strategy designed to eschew the political and colonial dimension of the conflict and that its transposition in the realm of state conflict-management had promoted the mistaken idea that sectarianism rested entirely on socio-psychological expla? nations. Thus, within the policy discourses of the state, sectarianism was treated as a structure of personal prejudice and not as the result of an unre? solved postcolonial situation.37 Bill Rolston argued that the 'internal conflict' paradigm had been corroborated by the revisionist school in Irish historiography. And he identified Foster, Elliott, Longley, Eamon Dunphy, Fintan O'Toole and Eoghan Harris as historians and journalists who popu? larized it in the southern media38. Both Bell and Rolston have argued that postmodernist theory was represented and embodied in Ireland through the revisionist critique of nationalism. Lyons later acknowledged to Ronan Fanning that his book, ends in pessimism and yes, I was pessimistic when I wrote it and am still more so now [. . .] Does pessimism paralyse the historical imagination? Sometimes I think yes [. . .] but on balance I don't feel paralysed and only feel that I might be paralysed if I believed in progress. Since I don't, I find ample scope in trying to come as close as possible to 'how it actu? ally was' - of course, not very close. I would really find it hard to be both a conscientious historian and an optimist - there I diverge from Yeats who was ultimately, I think, an optimist.39 As for Camus, he proclaims: 'Undoubtedly, every generation believes that it is destined to re-fashion the world. Mine, though, knows that it will not. But its task is even greater. It consists in preventing the world from undoing itself.'40 Two main themes stand out from these declarations. First the loss of faith in modernity in the guise of progress and an acute sense that pessimism, GKOTZARIDIS, Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001) 135</page><page sequence="16">instead of leading necessarily to despair, contains perhaps in itself the dawn? ing of a new critical wisdom. Here paradoxically, the intellectual takes on a role that is totally different from the old prototype from which it descends: the eighteenth-century philosopher. Henceforward, it does not suffice any? more for him to be the critical consciousness of the political, he has to find yet the courage to acknowledge and bear witness to its factual limits. One should not forget that when Lyons confessed his disenchantment, terror reigned in Northern Ireland, and the sectarian feelings that poisoned social relations did not appear to be susceptible to a political solution, as was testi? fied by the successive failures of the constitutional initiatives: direct rule, the power-sharing executive and later the inter-governmental conference. For at least thirty years, the province was a sinister symbol and reminder of the sys? tematic collapse and demise of politics. That is why the continuous threat looming over society forced Lyons, and also Camus, to think no more in terms of a future idealistic project, neither with a view designed to praise the beneficial effects of an ideology, but rather in terms of how to limit the dam? age and how to find a temporary remedy so as to alleviate human agony. To summarize: the unflagging resistance to evil instead of the naive belief in some immediate access to good and a social utopia. Henceforth, the most credible antidote to any totalitarian drift confines itself to a function of strict watchfulness in relation to the state of the world, if not to the future of mankind.The endogenous paradigm present in Lyons' writings is thus entire? ly in harmony with the postmodernist thought-process. This explanatory device is, not surprisingly, opposed by nationalist critics. Declan Kiberd's comments are interesting in so far as he places revisionism within a third world postcolonial framework. His main argument is that at some point the Western intelligentsia ceased being radical and supportive of the anti-colo? nial struggles as it had been in the 1960s in the cases of Algeria, Palestine and Vietnam. In the following decade a moment of exhaustion was reached and many intellectuals repented and revised. From now on the freedom-fighter became a terrorist in the eyes of the Western press. It was argued that many of the regimes in postcolonial nations were barbaric; others were simply incompetent but it was deemed that support for either kind amounted to the espousal of obscurantism. According to Kiberd the old, liberal-radical cri? tique of colonialism, pioneered by Jean-Paul Sartre and Bertrand Russell was usurped by the new, fashionable thesis of the 'self-inflicted wound'. And he quotes VS. Naipaul, who in his book, India: A Wounded Civilisation, contended that India's underdeveloped economy was imputable not to colonial interfer? ence and distortion but to the native religions, or more precisely what he termed the underdevelopment of ego in Hindu religion.41 This sort of con? clusion fitted perfectly with the conviction shared by all Western liberals and 136 GKOTZARIDIS, 'Irish Revisionism', Irish Review 27 (2001)</page><page sequence="17">conservatives that, when the British left their colonies, things only got worse. The fact that a third-world intellectual seemed to be echoing them encour? aged them to think that they were indeed right to hold this unorthodox and provocative view of the situation. This was a process by which all remaining British guilt about the colonial adventure could be totally expunged. Kiberd then connects third-world post-colonial revisionism with Irish revisionism by indicating that Conor Cruise O'Brien was the local prototype of this new kind of intellectual. O'Brien's thesis consisted indeed of saying that the alliance and final fusion between Catholicism and nationalism had been fatal to the unity of the Irish people because it automatically excluded the Protes? tant community from the Irish nation. He also held that the continuing British presence in Northern Ireland was dictated by necessity and that a withdrawal of the troops would most likely lead to the outbreak of civil war. Finally, he also bracketed together two concepts that until then had always been considered as mutually exclusive: he equated Irish nationalism with imperialism. For nationalist commentators, his position amounted to laying primary or sole responsibility for Ireland's troubles on its people's inability to settle by themselves their own dispute and to govern their own affairs, instead of putting the blame on Britain's imperialistic manoeuvres based squarely on a policy of divide and rule. The theory of the self-inflict? ed wound was being imported to Ireland, and this was understandably intolerable for most nationalists who interpreted this as an exoneration of the British government. One could oppose the view expounded in this article on the basis that Field Day intellectuals have also applied postmod? ernist paradigms in their reading o? Irish history and culture. Seamus Deane has launched effectively his most robust attack on revisionist history by endorsing the poststructuralist challenge to the authority of historical discourse. But Field Day's appropriation of the theory has mainly a polem? ical edge or thrust and would seem to be therefore more contrived than is the case with revisionism. The interp?n?tration between theory and histor? ical revisionism seems to be more organic and natural. I hope to have shown that there is in both cases a very real and sustained effort to think difference or otherness, be it Ulster Unionism, the debilitating gap between theory and reality, or the faults, shortcomings and tragedies of their respective political traditions. My comparison between Lyotard and Lyons is also intended to impart a sense of the real emotional turmoil and of the deep upheaval of the soul which transpires in a most poignant and unforgettable way in the writings of both schools.
