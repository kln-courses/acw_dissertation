<plain_text><page sequence="1">It is not uncommon for elementary teachers to include children's picture books as part of science lessons. This type of literature is most often used to intro duce a science topic, to provide simplified language defining terminology, or to extend a concept. Using books in the science classroom can promote authentic science practices and comprehension of science concepts (Magnusson and Palinc sar 2004). However, many children's information books do not present science au thentically. For example, they often present facts without discussing how the facts were obtained. This is in contrast to what occurs in scientific research articles, the primary way scientists communicate ideas and results. 32 Science and Children «"OHMS 8 ' •&lt;&gt;*. % \ 'S a ^5 cvWl py\Vv</page><page sequence="2">While children's books can provide a unique view of science that is both factual and based on real-life experi ences, no one genre sheds a full light on the complexity of science and science practices. The Common Core State Standards recommend children read a variety of texts and stories (NGAC and CCSSO 2010). Because each genre presents different text features, perspectives, and content for children to explore, using a variety of genres allows for the exploration of historical changes to science, scientists, and cultural views of science, which can support students' understandings (see Table 1, p. 34). Typical genres as sociated with science include storybooks, non-narrative information books, and narrative information books. This project, for third-grade students, extended its focus be yond these typical genres to include folklore, fictionalized narrative biography, and fictional works. In order to build children's critical lens, we share how students can behave as a scientist by analyzing multiple genres for the science practices and content—to learn how science is conducted. Note: you will need to reserve multiple copies from the school and public library prior to introducing this activity. Exploring Adaptation The students participated in a multi-day investigation exploring adaptations, any feature of the body or behav ior that helps an animal survive in its environment (Table 2, p. 35). These specialized modifications have occurred over generations. In the investigation, we used a multiple genre text set to address the disciplinary core idea LS4.C: Biological Evolution: Unity and Diversity (NGSS Lead States 2013). Students explored the impact of the environ ment on the chance of survival by an organism. The investigation focused on the science and engineer ing practices of obtaining, evaluating, and communicating information by exploring different genres. Scientists read scientific articles in their field with a critical stance to deter mine how the data was collected, analyzed, and interpreted; how it aligns with what is known about the phenomenon; and how reliable the information presented was. Like sci entists, students can engage in critical analysis of the infor mation within easy-to-comprehend literature to develop these same practices. Regardless of the genre, texts should present information accurately. Note: we used whole- and small-group instruction to discuss the information gathered in each text to address its trustworthiness. We supported critical analysis of the different books by creating the Observing Animal Adaptations matrix for students (Table 3, p. 36; see NSTA Connection for a blank matrix).The matrix engages students in exploring the ad aptations and scientific processes, including verification of information presented in the different genres. Prior to placing information in the matrix, students worked in small groups to analyze the information presented in the stories. This allows students to become familiar with each book through a collaborative investigation of how the main character(s) or author conducted science. While nonfiction informational books often do not have a charac ter within the book, students can determine how the infor mation may have been collected or how to verify the infor mation through specific text features including: author's notes, illustrator's notes, and references. Other books may discuss the expertise of the author/researcher and provide information on the experiments or the process of discov eries mentioned within the book. Over a series of six ses sions, students read and analyzed the information using the matrix. Note: To address students' abilities, you may choose to have students record information for each book separately and then transfer information onto a classroom matrix during whole-class instruction. As this unit presents a variety of genres, we engaged stu dents in multiple whole-group discussions to support dis ciplinary thinking. For example, students may read infor mational text as stories unless the teacher models the habits of a reader in science to access increasingly complex texts (Fisher and Frey 2015). While here we present only the use of trade books for exploring adaptations, online (see NSTA Connection) we have provided examples of teacher and stu dent resources, including a list of citizen science organiza tions to engage the class in studying birds, and a modified hands-on activity exploring bird beak adaptations. Day 1: Folklore We began the unit with a pourquoi tale, a type of folklore, to promote students to question information presented. The Great Ball Game (Bruchac 1993) provides an opportunity to discuss how people and cultures have tried for centu ries to explain what they have observed. A Framework for K-12 Science Education states, "a culturally responsive approach to science instruction involves the recognition of community practices and knowledge as being central to the scientific endeavor" (NRC 2012, p. 285). Several students shared similar stories they had heard both from other pourquoi books and from family members. Pourquoi tales tend to focus on problems and solutions, which aligns to the idea behind adaptation. Bruchac's Muskogee story follows a ball game between the Animals and the Birds to settle an argument over who was better, those with teeth or those with wings. While birds and animals don't necessarily overtly compete like those in Bruchac's tale, they live in nature in a constant competi tion for food. It is not, however, a contest most animals could win by simply changing their physical traits. We engaged students in discussions of how migration, a be havioral adaptation, improved the birds' survival within November 2016 33</page><page sequence="3">TABLE 1.

To engage in discussions of time, we wondered aloud when this story might have been originally told and had similar animals found today changed since that time. After reading the story, we engaged in discussions of the scientific practices the author/storyteller engaged in to support the reasoning for migration. Students were prompted to look at the pictures and identify text that pro vided evidence the storyteller used to support why birds migrate. Initially, students did not recognize any science practices beyond the previously identified problem and solution. The less obvious answer was the fact that the au thor based the story on observable characteristics of the animals, which included further discussions of adapta tions. In particular, we focused on observations, which in volves information a person gathers about an object using their senses and can be measured. An inference, on the other hand, is a conclusion or ex planation made based on observations but cannot be mea sured to ensure it is correct. The Bruchac story explains that birds migrate because they lost the game—an infer ence. Students were asked what information was used to support the inference. Discussions included identifying the observable features in the story as animals do have teeth, birds have wings and leave half of the year, and bats can see at night, which all are adaptations to the environ ment. Students questioned whether scientists' explana tion of bird migration was an inference. The driving theme of students' discussions was how the same observable features could be applied to the scientific explana tion. During this discussion, students became concerned about the animals behaving as hu- tm mans, known as anthropomorphism, which led 4w/* r/ to additional discussions of inferences of ani- ' (r. ' mal behavior and the nature of the folklore ) ' *0 genre. The class worked together to fill out O II' the information on the matrix. Days 2-3: Biography and Fiction We shared the study of birds, called ornithology, is unique because many amateurs and scientists alike observe the animals. We then introduced the fictional narrative bi ography The Boy Who Drew Birds (Davies 2004) and the fiction story Owl Moon (Yolen 1987). These books allow students to enter into the life of a person whose discoveries changed how we understand our natural world as well as recognize how they are active members of this same scien tific community. The students moved into their small groups to identify adaptations of birds. Each group was provided a copy of Davies's (2004) and Yolen's (1987) books. We asked stu dents to focus on preselected pages for the Davies' text and TABLE 2.

Explaining that they needed to behave as scientists, we reminded students that scientists look at written and visual information to identify the ques tion, experiment, data, and conclusions presented as well as determine the reliability of the work through references. We shared that it was important to consider details including location, colors, sizes, and time of day when analyzing the information about bird adaptations and the habitat present ed within the books. As we moved around the classroom, we prompted small-group discussions to consider how the animals interacted with the habitats over time to increase survival, including what happened if the species did not adapt. We asked students to explain how data from previ ous scientists like that collected by John James Audubon (Davies 2004) helps scientists understand bird adaptations. Students discussed the time of activity for each bird in the texts, diurnal and nocturnal. In the small groups, we continued to prompt students to discuss the animals' adap tations that allowed the animal to survive in the environ ment. We encouraged students to compare the pictures within each text to recognize differences and similarities be tween the birds and habitats. They identified feathers, size of wings, location of the nest, and reliance on different sens es. Comparison of the habitats focused on being in similar parts of the United States (Massachusetts and Pennsylva nia), the presence of trees, and weather. Providing counter examples also helps explain how animal adaptations help increase survival while still other animals will struggle to survive and still others will not survive in a particular habi tat. Occurrence maps, maps showing where the birds are and are not found, are particularly useful in the discussions of survival in a particular habitat (see Internet Resources). Moving back into the whole-group setting, we dis cussed not only adaptations but also scientific practices, including reading with a critical lens about the process of science. The books presented opportunities to discuss what types of information the characters collected, how they dressed, tools used, and attitudes. We encouraged students to discuss their own experiences in which they may have collected information like the characters in both books. Students began to discuss experiences that included collecting rocks, reading books or searching the internet to understand something, and exploring the woods around their homes. There were instances in which students dis cussed similar attitudes and feelings as the characters but not related to the scientific endeavor. We countered these discussions with questions about the students' excitement and concerns about past science explorations conducted in the class. The groups reported, and the teacher recorded the information on the sample matrix. Days 4-5: Nonfiction Information Students engaged in scientific practices by analyzing information presented in texts as part of this research project. Informational books about adaptations often in clude multiple pictures, location of the species, and other demographic data for students to consider as they learn about specific adaptations. Our school media specialist provided a collection of informational texts on birds. We also included a few media sources (e.g., mobile apps, websites) to serve as supplemental informational texts (see Technology Resources). For example, the National Audubon Society has released a series of apps that pres ent field guides on birds of North America. The technol ogies provided multiple pictures, audio and video, maps, and more for students to explore bird adaptations. The websites and apps were identified and placed in a folder on the computers and tablets for students. Prior to using any learning technologies, we ensured that the informa tion was appropriate and did not request any personal in formation. We also discussed acceptable practices with students, including not clicking any adver tisements or sharing personal information. The students were tasked with choosing one bird to focus on to identify adaptations. We wanted students to choose birds they would like to learn more about. We built a list of local birds native to the area and those found at the local zoo. Once a student chose a bird, that option was removed from the list to ensure each student selected a different bird. We prompted students to determine the habitat the bird lived in to help recognize specific adaptations. The National Audubon Society apps were particularly help ful for students to explore where the birds were found to help identify possible adaptations to increase survival or will not survive in relation to the habitat. Students were encouraged to watch videos and listen to audio recordings to identify specific physical and behavioral traits. We re minded students to identify how the author verified the information by looking for text features such as references, author or illustrator notes, and qualifications and expertise of the author/researcher. Building on this, we asked stu dents to document where their information was gathered. A November 2016 37</page><page sequence="7">Day 6: Assessment On the final day of the unit, we asked each student to cre ate a story about the adaptations of their chosen bird. For this assessment, we expected students to include infor mation about the specific adaptations, both physical and behavioral, and how these adaptations support survival in the birds' environments. Regardless of the story, students were required to include a reference list (see NSTA Con nection for rubric). Students enjoyed writing these fiction alized stories, many of which included the students acting as the scientist or taking trips to the zoo. One student ex ample, shows the student writing a scientific log in which he explains his first encounter with a great blue heron. Within his story, the student discusses using a scientific tool (a tracker), and asks questions, makes observations, and discusses scientific attitudes of wonderment while dealing with scientific discovery. In terms of adaptations, he mentions the heron's large beak, wings, and distinctive call. The final drafts were shared with the class. From this project, we learned how much the students considered themselves as scientists, as reflected in many of the stories. These stories included the students involved in observing, asking questions, and conducting research. In the future, we could follow up the unit activities by having students create illustrations or take pictures and engage in data collection of local birds to discuss adaptations. Conclusion The use of multiple genres brought to light different per spectives for understanding the scientific process. The anal ysis of texts engaged students in authentic science experi ences as they inferred, observed, and questioned the text to make sense of the texts. We found this activity to be highly engaging for students as they discussed their own experi ences as ornithologists and scientists. These budding sci entists began to recognize the importance of understanding content in developing stories. Even stories that originally seemed outlandish were, under further review, found to hold sound scientific observations, thus promoting creativ ity in both the literature and scientific sense.
