<plain_text><page sequence="1">Clem Abt aiiem Oka for The inscrutability of the gods : motivation of behaviour in Chinua Achebe's arrow of God « But for Ezeulu there was no next time. Think of a man who, unlike lesser men, always goes to battle without a shield because he knows that bullets and matchets will glance off his medicine-boiled skin, think of him discovering in the thick of battle that the power had suddenly, without warning deserted him. What next time can there be ? » Umuaro people's interpretation of this tragedy that befalls Ezeulu was simple. « Their god had taken sides with them against his headstrong and ambitious priest and thus upheld the wisdom of their ancestors — that no man however great was greater that his people ; that no man ever won judgement against his clan. » The events in the novel, Arrow of God, however are more complex than this cut and dried verdict indicates. It is true that Ezeulu is ruined, but his god ultimately shares the same fate with him. People can now send their sons with a yam or two as an offering to the new religion and bring back the promised immunity against Ulu's wrath. Thereafter, their yams can be harvested in the son's name, and this is a great damage to the allegiance which the people had previously owed exclusively to Ulu. In this paper, I have tried to analyze the reasons why the ma jor characters behave the way they do, so as to establish a pat tern of motivation in Arrow of God, which I consider Achebe's most complex novel. Famine breaks out in Umuaro because Ezeulu refuses to announce the day of the feast of the New Yams. He usually an nounces this feast day when he has only one sacred yam left. The twelve yams used in keeping the calendar correspond to (1) Nigerian Post-gradate, Institute of African Studies Makerere University College P.O. Box 16015 — KAMPALA (Uganda)</page><page sequence="2">208 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE the twelve months of the lunar year. When there is only one yam, then there is only one month to the end of the year — the month that marks the beggining of the harvesting season. On this particular occasion, three yams remain, so according to practice, the priest should wait for two more months before announcing the day of the feast. This would have been the logi cal thing to do under normal circumstances. But things have not followed their regular course in this particular year. Three yams are left because Ezeulu was in prison in Okperi when he should have eaten two of them. As far as he is concerned, those two months can not be regarded as having passed since the corresponding yams have not been eaten. But if he waits until there is one yam left this time, the harmattan will have set in, and this will mean the complete destruction of the yams locked up in the hard soil for two extra months. While Ezeulu was in jail, however, his assistants continued to reckon the months, but they could not eat the sacred yams since this task is the exclusive responsibility of the priest of Ulu. According to their calculations the time has come for Ezeulu to announce the feast, and as is to be expected, they remind of his responsibility, but he rebuffs them by telling them that : « no Ezeulu can lose count. Rather it is you who count with your fingers who are likely to make a mistake, to forget which finger you counted the last moon. But as I said at the beginning you have done well to come and ask. Go back to your villages now and wait for my mes sage. I have never needed to be told the duties of my priesthood. » On learning that Ezeulu has refused to announce the feast, ten men of high title come to him, and try to persuade him to change his mind. But he tells them his reason for not announ cing the day : there are still three yams. The elders therefore re quest him to eat the yams, the assumption is that Ulu will not be angry and that even if he is offended, the whole town will placate him. Ezeulu's reply is precise : « what you ask me is not done. Those yams are not food and a man does not eat them because his is hungry. You are asking me to eat death. » At this juncture, Anichebe Udeogo reminds him that they the elders, as representing the entire clan are mandating him to eat those yams. Udeogo implies that they, the law makers, are permitting him to break the law. This mandate raises a question of conscience and free will. Is Ezeulu wrong in refusing to eat the yams, now that he has been empowered to do so by the rulers of the clan ? Most reli gions teach that if you commit a sin wilfully, you will be puni</page><page sequence="3">THE INSCRUTABILITY OF THE GODS 209 shed for it, no matter who instigates you to it. The christain teaching on temptation is that at the time of the temptation, one is usually persuaded that the sinful act is not bad after all. The important thing however, is that no matter how insinuating the circumstances, if a person wilfully commits a sin, he will be punished for it. In this respect therefore, the elders of Umuaro are tempters and Ezeulu knows quite well that he has no justi fication for committing a sin deliberately. He is not even in the state of mind to yield to their request even if the act were justifiable by any stretch of the imagination. He has just got an intimation from Ulu that he is no more than an arrow in the bow of his god. The moment of this revelation is vital, because he has just returned from jail determined to punish his people for doing nothing to the white man who imprisoned him. However, he is moved on his return by the sincerity of the numerous people who come to say nno (welcome) to him. He therefore considers either forgiving the entire clan or limiting the conflict to only his enemies. Just as these thoughts are going on in his mind, Ulu upbraids him : « Ta Nwanu !, barked Ulu in his ear, as a spirit would in the ear of an impertinent human child. 'Who told you that this was your own fight ?' Ezeulu trembled and said nothing. 'I say who told you that this was your fight which you could arrange to suit you ? You want to save your friends who brought you palm wine he — he — he ! laughed the deity the way spirits do — a dry skeletal laugh. 'Beware you do not come between me and my victim or you may receive the blows not meant for you ! Do you not know what happens when two elephants fight ? Go home and sleep and leave me to settle my quarrel with Idemili who wants to destroy me so that his python may come to power. Now tell me how it concerns you. I say go home and sleep. As for me and Idemili we shall fight to the finish ; and whoever throws the other will strip him of his anklet. » This message shows that Ulu does not want his priest to interfere in the fight. Because he does not like to close any avenue ot reconciliation, Ezeulu at the request of the elders petitions Ulu to change his mind, but the reply was negative. In the light of this evidence, is Ezeulu wrong in refusing to eat the yams. I do not think so, for it would have been impro per for him to go on, since he seems to be convinced that such an action would provoke Ulu to direct to him, the blows meant for another. But if we agree that Ezeulu did not do anything wrong by refusing to eat the yams, how then do we explain the calamities that befell him in the end. Ezeulu does not feel that he merited his disaster, and his argument is convincing, for : « What was his offence ? Had he not divined the god's</page><page sequence="4">210 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE will and obeyed it ? When was it ever heard that a child was scalded by the piece of yam its own mother put into its palm ? What man would send his son with a potsherd to bring fire from a neighbour's hut and then unleash rain on him ? » Assuming that Ezeulu does not deserve his calamities, why do his people see them as a just punishment ? This may be due to the fact that most of the characters in the novel do not appreciate Ezeulu's personality in its entirety. They judge him only by his external appearances, and as we shall soon realize, he had a haughty exterior. He is a man who is always concerned with his status in society. In the first few pages of the novel, we see him comtemplating the immense destructive powers he has. At this time he appears like a man gloating over his arsenal of hydrogen bombs. « When Ezeulu considered the immensity of his power over the year qpd the crops and, therefore, over the people he wondered if it was real. It was true he named the day for the feast of the Pumpkin leaves and for the New Yam feast ; but he did not choose the day. He was merely a watchman. His power was no more than the power of a child over a goat that was said to be his. As long as the goat was alive it was his ; he would find it food and take care of it. But the day it was slaughtered he would know who the real owner was. » « No ! », he said to himself, « the Chief Priest of Ulu was more than that, must be more than that. If he should refuse to name the day, there would be no festival — no planting and no reaping ». If he refuses to name the day, Umuaro will surely be plunged into a terrible disaster. In that respect therefore, he possesses a potentially destructive weapon. But the important question is : would he dare use that weapon ? It hurts him to realize that he is afraid to refuse to name the day. « Take away that word dare », he says. « Yes I say take it away. No man in all Umuaro can stand up and say I dare not. The woman who will bear the man who will say it has not yet been born. » After this episode we begin to feel that Ezeulu is not just a reed moving as the wind blows, but a man so conscious of his powers in his society that he may one day do something not necessarily what he believes to be Ulu's will, provided it esta blishes that his own power over Umuaro is real. This feeling is confirmed by what Ezeulu and Nwaka think of him as well. They do not see him as a selfless priest, but rather as a man</page><page sequence="5">THE INSCRUTABILITY OF THE GODS 211 who is so selfseeking that he would not even hesitate to make himself King of Umuaro if it lies in his power to do so. « Has anybody ever asked why the head of the Priest of Ulu is removed from his body at death and hung up in the shrine », Ezidemili asks Nwaka. « Ulu has no quarrel with earth ; when our fathers made it they did not say his priest should not touch the earth. But the first Ezeulu was an envious man like the present one ; it was he him self who asked his people to bury him like an Ezidemili. » We should however not base our entire assessment of Ezeu lu's character on this testimony, because Ezidemili has always been his enemy. This enemity arises from the fact that prior to the establishment of Ulu as deity of the six villages that comprise Umuaro, Ezidemili was the most respected priest in Umuaro because he was priest to Umuneora, the first village in the town. Hovewer, with the installation of Ulu, this emi nent position passed to Ezeulu since Ulu was the deity of the whole town and not just that of one of the six villages. It is at least logical that no Ezidemili liked this transfer of power, and the present one is no exception. Again, if we base our judgement of Ezeulu's character on his realtionship with his half brother, Okeke Onenyi, we may well get a prejudiced view, but at the same time we begin to under stand why his people do not like him. Onenyi says that their enstrangement is due to the fact that Ezeulu is jealous of his knowledge of herbs, but if we look beneath the surface, we realize that this is not the case. People like Akuebue, who un derstand Ezulu, know that Okeke must have done something bad to him. They even say that Okeke 'tied the womb of Ezeu lu's first wife'. But Ezeulu's refusal to discuss his breach with his brother, opens another aspect of his character, that is, his reticence which further prevents others from having a balanced view of him. He is a solitary figure and he is always aware that he alone carries the guilt of Umuaro during the purification. He is half spirit and half man and therefore possesses a greater insight into things than most ordinary men. This explains why he does not usually discuss his actions with other people, hence even his own sons misunderstand him. For instance when he sends Oduche to the white man's school, his eldest son, Edogo imagines that he does it to ensure that his favourite son, Nwafo succeeds him as Chief Priest of Ulu. Little does he know that Ezeulu in fact sends Oduche there « to be his eye » among wor shippers of the new religion. Again when he tells Winterbottom the truth about the owner ship of the disputed farm land, his people misunderstand his intentions and imagine that he does so, to court the white man's favour. Such people are therefore stunned when he rejects the chieftaincy which Winterbottom later offers him. The question that then arises is his real motive for testifying against his peo</page><page sequence="6">212 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE pie. Why does he do it if not to impress the white man ? Ezeulu answers this question for us : « how could a man who held the holy staff of Ulu know that a thing was a lie and speak it ? » He is convinced that the land belongs to Okperi because his father told him so, and in traditional Ibo society, no man ever deceives his son. Thus we appreciate that Ezeulu is not just the vengeful priest which his people take him to be. But we should not on the other hand mistake him for a man who readily turns the other cheek to his assailant. As we notice from his statement after his re lease from Okpiri prison, he can be vengeful when really pro voked. « I am going home », he says, « to challenge all those who have been poking their fingers into my face to come out side their gate and meet me in combat and whoever throws the other will strip him of his anklet ». But even this bitterness does not last very long, for when he goes home and his people visit him and sympathize with him, he relents. It is only Ulu's reprimand that hardens him again. There is no incident in the novel in which Ezeulu exceeds the instructions which he believes comes from Ulu. Admittedly, he is the type of man who is capable of using Ulu for his own purposes, but in Arrow of God, he does not do any such thing. He may not regret the blows which Ulu strikes Idemili and through Idemili to his own enemy, Ezidemili, but this in itself is not a crime. The important thing is that he does not go out of his way to exact personal vengeance from Ezidemili, even if he is delighted when his god flogs his enemy for him. The circumstances we have just narrated do not explain Ezeulu's tragic end. The people of Umuaro feel that Obika's death together with Ezeulu's subsequent madness are Ulu's verdict. They feel that he has taken sides with them against his headstrong and ambitious priest. But this view does not satis factorily explain the way things happen in the novel and my scepticism is borne out by the final paragraph of the novel itself, which says that : « If this was so then Ulu had chosen a dangerous time to uphold this wisdom. In destroying his priest he had also brought disaster on himself, like the lizard in the fable who ruined his mother's funeral by his own hand. For a deity who chose a time such as this to destroy his priest or abandon him to his enemies was inciting people to take liberties ; and Umuaro was just ripe to do so. » This is the fine point of the novel and we must avoid the</page><page sequence="7">THE INSCRUTABILITY OF THE GODS 213 conventional conclusion : he opposed his clan, it serves him right, for on a closer examination, we begin to see trends that make it unlikely that Ulu was responsible for what happened to his Chief priest. This is so because from the very beginning of this confrontation, Ulu makes Ezeulu understand that the im minent struggle is a battle between the gods. This is why Ezeulu at the beginning justifies everything that happens to him — Odu che's locking up of the python as well as the incursion of Win terbottom, as parts of Ulu's grand design. It is significant that the solitary voice which Ezeulu hears in his nightmare is that of the python : « I was born when lizards were in ones and twos A child of Idemili. The difficult tear-drops of Sky's first weeping drew my spots. Being Sky-born I walked the earth with royal gait And mourners saw me coiled across their path. But of late A strange bell Has been singing a song of desolation : Leave your yams and cocoyams And come to school. And I must hurry in haste When children in play or in earnest cry : Look ! A christian is on the way. Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha ha... » Within the framework of the python myth, this is obviously an appropriate moment for Idemili to strike, for two reasons ; firstly Ezeulu has not sufficiently cleansed his household of the abomination which Oduche brought into it by locking up a sa cred python in his box. Secondly Idemili has not forgotten his rivalry with Ulu. It seems that Idemili does not want to strike without first warning his victim and this may be why he shows Ezeulu in a dream, what will happen to him when he wakes up, and it is the utter destruction of his household. The details of the dream support the view that it is proba bly Idemili who is responsible for Obika's death. Ezeulu on hea ring the voices of mourners who seem to pass behind his com pound raises his voice so as to summon his family to help him challenge them, but his compound is deserted. « He ran into Matefi's hut but all he saw were the ashes of a long dead fire. He rushed out and ran into Ugoye's hut calling her and her children but her hut was already falling in and a few blades of green grass had sprouted on the thatch. He was running towards Obika's hut when a new voice behind the compound brought him to a sudden halt. » This voice was the voice of the python, an animal sacred to Idemili. The vital fact is that it is when Ezeulu is running towards Obika's hut that he hears the py thon's voice. He is happy waking up to realise that it was only a dream, but not long afterwards, Obika's dead body is carried</page><page sequence="8">214 PRÉSENCE AFRICAINE into the house. Ezeulu must have realised at that moment, that Idemili had in actual fact claimed his victim but only came in the form of a python to tell him of it. This is understandable because in traditional Ibo society, which is the setting of the novel, people believe that Idemili can appear to human beings in the form of a python. This explains why a python must never be killed deliberately. The view that it is probably Idemili who killed Obika is even reinforced by Ezidemili's reaction when he learns of the death. He does not rejoice, but only says : « this should teach him how far to dare », for he feels that it was definitely the work of his god, Idemili. So unlike the modern English and American novels in which the characters are presumed to be solely responsible for what happens to them, the character in Chinua Achebe's Arrow of God, are mere arrows with which the anthropomorphic gods shoot one another. Ezeulu's haughty exterior may be responsi ble for people assuming that he used Ulu for his own purposes, while he like the other characters are just tools in a divine warfare. And in the contest portrayed in Arrow of God, Idemili has not only wrecked Ulu, but also Ulu's priest — this being a combat in which whoever throws the other strips him of his anklet. This resolution raises a very profound problem, and that is : realising that another divinity can intervene in our affairs, how far should we go in obeying the god we worship ? And this even leads to a more universal problem : to what extent should we stick to any set of principles ? Achebe is not a preacher and so he does not offer any cut and dried answer. He wants each individual to find his own way of coming to terms with the complexities of life.</page></plain_text>
