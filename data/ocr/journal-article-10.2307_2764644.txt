<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS L. L. BERNARD University of Minnesota ABSTRACT Social progress is an anthropomorphic concept, implying, in its most highly developed form, conscious comparison and valuation of two or more points or organiza- tions in a perceived evolutionary process. Norms for measuring progress are estab- lished through the accumulated content of science, and they increase in precision with the advancement of scientific method. The chief conditions and limitations respecting social progress are the cosmic and physical, biological and psycho-social. Social progress has evolved from the "blind" or non-previsioned into the socially conscious or intelligently controlled stage, in which science is its chief aid and pro- moter. Nevertheless, there is much opposition still on the part of the sentimentalists and the traditional culturists to science and even to the concept of progress itself. Only a better-developed scientific method and a completer knowledge of the nature of society can overcome this. The distinction between evolution and progress is now generally apprehended. Progress connotes an approach to an end or result which is regarded as more nearly perfect or complete than the antecedent stage in the development process with which the end or result is compared. It involves the selection of some particular stage or organization of the evolutionary process as a norm for comparison, and this norm must be regarded as of exceptional value to which antecedent conditions approach in value. Evolution, on the other hand, is merely orderly movement, or change, from one condition to another, or from one process to another. Since status is an anthropomorphic concept, dependent upon the human mental tendency to "hold things steady while we look," rather than an actual fact, we perhaps would better define evolution as the transformation of perceivable phenomena without necessary reference to future results. But while no goal need be kept in view, a well-formulated concept of evolution in general, and any specific theory of evolution in particular, must involve an account of preceding stages of development. In fact, every theory of evolution attempts to reconstruct the antecedent forms and func- tions of the phenomena under consideration with as great complete- ness as possible. And no such theory is regarded as proved until 2 I</page><page sequence="2">22 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY a sufficiently large number of the past forms have been recon- structed that the mental survey of the line of past development is not unnecessarily interrupted by breaks unaccounted for. These facts are well illustrated by the data of organic evolution, and especially by the importance attached to the discovery of the "missing link" some thirty years ago. Evolution of the human type was not considered to have been established until the whole series of transitions from the original apelike form down to homo sapiens was within view. Accordingly, we may say that evolution reconstructs a series of forms looking back to the past. It is really a historical method and received its formulation in that part of the nineteenth century when there was most interest in reconstructing man's historical past and when the collection of the data of both human and animal (natural) history was being passionately urged and pursued. On the other hand, a theory of progress attempts in its particular field to construct, by means of foresight and hypothetical computation with respect to a posited norm, the forms and functions which are yet to be achieved. This is its ultimate aim. In order to achieve such a result it is, of course, necessary to study the past, to get the evolutionary view, and also to compute the hypothetical conditions under which these future forms and functions may be realized. It is not significant for the sake of the distinction between evolution and progress whether the approach to the end be direct or indirect, regular or irregular. But there must be approach toward some putative superior type or goal. In this sense much evolution may also be regarded as progres- sive, for not only have the phenomena moved from preceding forms -as is the case in all evolution-but in many cases it eventuates in higher forms and functions. In such cases it is probably better to speak of progressive evolution. This overlapping of the meaning of progress and evolution is true not only of the past movements of phenomena, but also of the future changes of an orderly sort. Unquestionably present forms will, in many cases, evolve into future higher forms, just as past lower forms have evolved or progressed into present higher forms. It may be argued, therefore, that progress is a category within the concept of evolution. Such is</page><page sequence="3">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 23 the case. Both progress and evolution presuppose orderly move- ment. And by "orderly" is here implied the existence of a con- siderable degree of functional correlation of the phenomena involved in the movement process, which may be perceived by a mind operating analytically. Changes in the relations of phenomena which do not suggest the existence of this correlation are not regarded as either evolutionary or progressive, although a higher power of intellectual analysis might possibly reveal these conditions and attributes. Prevision of the putative higher ends or goals is not necessary to the existence of progress as distinguished from evolution. No progress was foreseen until in comparatively recent times, whether that progress was social, biological, or purely physical. In all the stages of progressive animal or plant evolution before the advent of purposive breeding by man there was no foresight of ends, much less any attempt at control of the direction in which this evolution should go. Yet we may properly speak of progress in the develop- ment of living forms from the earliest times. In like manner early social evolution, in the main progressive, was neither foreseen nor directed by human thought. This sort of progress we may call blind, as distinguished from intelligent or consciously controlled, meaning by that term that it occurred because of the operation of forces or controls, both physical and biological, outside of the opera- tion of the constructive powers of the human mind. However, blind progress, or progressive evolution not directed by human thought, is not undirected by other controls. Yet the various metaphysical and teleological hypotheses of natural controls over evolution have now been abandoned as explanatory categories. We no longer look for "inner necessity," the "vital principle" of evolution, or the "tendency of all things to conform to a plan." These phrases, like the theological concept, the "will of God," have been relegated to the mythology of science, and in their place we seek statements of the correlation of phenomena, natural and social, of a kind which eliminates the mystery in the developmental process and substitutes a mechanistic interpretation. We can state mechanical sequences quantitatively, while theological and metaphysical ones can be explained only in qualitative terms, and</page><page sequence="4">24 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY even these definitions are vague, impressionistic, and emotional, rather than definite, tangible, and intellectualistic. Accordingly we now tend to explain evolution in terms of such factors or controls as variation (including mutation), selection, and transmission (either hereditary or social). All of these factors are being worked out concretely and definitely and quantitatively. Of these, selec- tion accounts primarily for evolution, progressive and unprogressive. This selection of types by means of survival is consummated by forced adaptation to the environment. That is, only those varia- tions and mutations can survive which are best adapted to their en- vironments. Where the environments select lower forms for survival we have evolution, but not progress. Where higher forms are selected and perpetuated we have both evolution and progress. The controls which determine the selection of evolving traits and forms are, therefore, lodged ultimately in the environments. When these controls are intellectual and are exercised by a psycho-social environment we have progressive evolution which is "directed," in the usual meaning of that term, implying conscious control, and which is usually previsioned. However, it is possible to have consciously directed progressive evolution without having foresight of ends. In a highly developed civilization the two go normally together and the former follows upon the latter. Obviously neither prevision nor conscious direction plays a part in the early evolution of such traits as hoofs and horns in cattle, while both are very active in connection with the making of constitutions or the construction of a league of nations. Both may, however, operate even in the progressive evolution of biological traits, where the scientific breeder is active, or even in the control of physical evolution in those fields where man has learned to modify the physico-geographic environment. While progress is not necessarily dependent upon prevision of ends or conscious direction of events, the greatest degree of progress should naturally be expected where these two intellectual factors co-operate in controlling the process of evolution. Prevision is necessary to constructive or purposive conscious direction, but not to conscious direction as such. There was much conscious direction of a more or less whimsical and random character long before such</page><page sequence="5">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 25 direction had been rendered scientific and largely efficient, that is, before there was an adequate perception of values to be striven for. The sciences, especially the social sciences, have done most to pro- vide those in a position to give direction to future evolution-and this now includes most of mankind, because of the progressive democratization of social control-with the means of making ade- quate valuations of ends. The sciences also provide the technique and data with which to put these values into operation. It is, therefore, in recent times that evolution has been most continuously and uniformly and rapidly progressive. Through the technique of invention, which in its more advanced and intellectualized stages becomes the embodiment of the purposive control process, we have been able to make adaptations between man and his environments, selecting constantly improved types for survival and transmission, in the physical, biological, and social worlds, which have vastly accelerated the rate of progress in all fields. Scientific invention is the embodiment of both prevision and conscious direction of phenomena. Although progress may occur without prevision and conscious control, it cannot as a concept be distinguished from evolution without bringing into operation conscious valuation. It has, therefore, been called an anthropomorphic concept. It requires a mind to determine the superiority of one form or function as contrasted with another, or indeed to foresee an end and to seek to direct events toward that end. The essentially human character of the evaluation and characterization of evolution or change as progressive has led some to limit the definition of progress to those phases of evolution which are premeditated and consciously controlled; but this is an error, as has been shown. Since progress is an anthropomorphic concept, we may rightly expect to discover as many kinds of progress as there are types or fields of phenomena which pass under the critical eye of man and are held to undergo improvement. Some of the more common terms used in this connection are racial progress, social progress, spiritual progress, economic and industrial progress. To these might be added many more, including even cosmic progress and divine progress. Those theologians who have thoroughly assimi-</page><page sequence="6">26 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY lated the concept of evolution may properly, and sometimes do, conceive of a progressive development of divinity itself. The idea of a progressive development of the idea or concept of the di- vine is much older and more widespread still. One may also properly speak of cosmic progress from the standpoint of man. Whether there is such a thing as cosmic progress from the hypotheti- cal standpoint of the universe as a whole or of the "mind of God," or any other universal or quasi-universal category, I am unable to say. But it is pretty clear that the part of the universe we are able to measure and evaluate from a human standpoint has become increasingly better adapted to the habitation and progressive development of man, at least through the geologic periods of which we have record. Temperature changes, the development of soils, the evolution of plants and animals serviceable to man, the deposit of minerals in the earth, now used by man for his enrichment and the creation of utilities, are some of the progressive changes in the external physical world which have accrued to the benefit of man. This progressive cosmical evolution has occurred without either prevision or conscious direction, unless these functions were exer- cised by some other being than man. Many examples of spiritual, moral, religious, intellectual, legal, political, economic, and industrial progress might be found. In a way, all of these may be grouped under the more inclusive term, social progress. For this reason social progress is the highest form of progress, anthropomorphically considered, for it cannot be achieved without also attaining in considerable degree the other forms of progress, including even cosmic and the various forms of biological and geological progress. Not forgetting that these vari- ous forms of progress are anthropomorphic judgments, the crite- rion of progress in any field other than that of human life need not be merely that which advances human welfare. Man is capable of objectifying his judgment to the extent of estimating progress in any field-cosmic, the development of a species, or of ore deposits -from the standpoint of its own completion or functioning, although what he considers a proper end or final result in such cases is necessarily colored by his own experiences and his human values. For example, what he would consider progress in the</page><page sequence="7">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 27 development of the saurians might have little or no reference to standards of human welfare, or might conceivably prove to be in conflict with it. On the whole, however, social progress involves progress-colored more or less by human interest concepts-of most of the other forms, conditions and series of phenomena. The exceptions to this rule are to be found primarily in connection with certain plant and animal forms which are harmful to man, certain human types which because of criminality or other pathological condition or maladjustment cannot be assimilated to a program for social welfare as a whole, and certain physico-geographic and cosmic phenomena which are in conflict with the development of human life and society. Such conditions must be subordinated, where possible, to human values in order to secure social progress. If they persist in spite of the efforts of man they may actively endanger social progress, or even, in the end, as will be pointed out later, destroy it. Some may object to using the term progress at all to cover climactic or adaptive and integrational forms of evolutionary development in series of physico-geographic and cosmic phenomena. Others might go so far as to say the term should not be applied to a similar evolution of animate phenomena other than human; that since it is an anthropomorphic concept it should apply only to human phenomena. Such objections are not well taken. In all science, including the psychic and social sciences, we are getting away from the "will" category of causation. Instead of attributing action to the most immediate sign of the action, the consciousness arising in connection with it-and imputed to accompany it in other organisms or aggregations of which we have no immediate consciousness-we are attempting to trace the strands of causation back to the most ultimate sources we can find, outside the organism or aggregate as well as inside it. For example, the behavioristic psychologists refuse longer to regard consciousness, and especially the foreconsciousness, as the sole cause of the act. They reduce the causal processes to bio-chemical and bio-physical terms, and even to those of direct impact,' where they find this possible. The biologists abandon metaphysics for physics and chemistry; life- I See classification of acts in American Journal of Sociology, XXV, 3I3-I5.</page><page sequence="8">28 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY forces for chemical and electrical reactions; design and teleology for environmental selection and hereditary or social transmission; a first cause for an evolutionary concept and theory. The sociol- ogists are learning that not all human action, nor all social institu- tions and other phenomena, are the results of conscious deliberation, but that many of them occur and persist in spite of such delibera- tion, which is as yet relatively feeble and poorly organized in the face of the instincts and the habits imposed by the complex psycho- social environment into which we are born and in the midst of which we live. We recognize, therefore, that even social progress owes more on the whole to non-willed activities than to those which are carefully planned. There is so much in social organization and development which springs rather from physical and cosmic conditions than from human planning that we may almost say that the human race has developed largely regardless of itself. If this is in any measure true for the present it has been much more applicable to the past, especially in those periods of human development when man did not plan for the future at all. Such assertions may of course be made without in any way belittling the immense importance of the labors of the keen constructive scientific minds which are gradu- ally whipping the social world into organized form under the guidance of intelligent foresight and planning. The time may come when "blind" progress will be at a minimum and when intelligent and planned direction of social evolution toward a moralized and intellectualized progressive goal will be the leading thought and aim in practically all men's minds. But the time can never come when the great cosmic and physico-geographic forces, the limitations of past organic evolution, and perhaps even some of the phases of blind social evolution, will not largely determine conditions for future social evolution in spite of all possible human intelligent planning with scientific aids. These aspects of man's environment antedate him, have molded him from the beginning, and are much more powerful than he. His recourse in the face of such factors is to work out the utmost conformity which is possible to his environ- ment, where he cannot control it. In the light of the fact, therefore, that so much of man's own progressive evolution is conditioned and directed by forces over</page><page sequence="9">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 29 which he has little or no control-such social progress being not the result of thought, but of natural processes-it seems only reasonable to apply the term "progress" likewise to changes in inanimate nature or among the lower animals which conform to certain categories of development prescribed by man as constituting progress. The fact that human phenomena are not concerned in the result of the developmental process as well as in the causation of the process would not appear to be any more significant. The determining criteria of progress must rest, not with the kinds of phenomena to which the term applies, but with the formulation of ends or results of developmental processes and the conditions and methods by which the development takes place. It is not the purpose of this article to enter into a lengthy discussion of the first of these factors. It has already been stated, however, that ends must necessarily be formulated in the light of human experience and valuations, allowing for whatever detach- ment of human outlook and judgment is possible. Even in the case of human social progress the more detached the judgment of ends, the more likely are the results to prove satisfactory in the long run. The subjective, hedonistic judgment is the least reliable of all as a method of positing ends.' Immediate satisfactions crowd out those of long-time continuance. And satisfactions take the place of objective adjustments which care for the interests of all those concerned. Also the subjective judgment lacks a quantitative calculus for the measurement of ends and results. It is primarily qualitative in its valuations, having reference more to the consump- tion than to the production of satisfactions and utilities. Consequently, when we advance from merely empirical to scientific methods of furthering social progress we also abandon or diminish the subjective and hedonistic tests in favor of the objective and intellectualistic ones. If this trend toward objectivity is observable in the field of social progress, much more should we expect to find it in connection with the progressive evolution of non-human phenomena. And such is the case. Every casual reader of the history of science is familiar with the evolution of concepts, in the statement of relations of physical phenomena, from I See Bernard, The Transition to an Objective Standard of Social Control, chaps. ii and Mii.</page><page sequence="10">30 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY an animistic to a mechanistic terminology, until at the present time we have eliminated almost altogether all implications of emotional or intellectual valuations or attitudes from descriptions of such phenomena. Even in the social and mental sciences we are moving in the direction of a mechanistic quantitative terminology to take the place of subjective valuations. In like manner we have learned to state the theories of cosmic and terrestrial evolution in terms of objective mechanistic processes, dropping the theological and even the metaphysical concepts of causation and end or result in this process. Energy, matter, motion and their combinations and correlations are the subject matter of the physical sciences, and these are the factors in relation to their selective environments, which are considered in the evolu- tionary processes in which they are involved. When a question of ends or results arises in connection with the progressive evolution of physical phenomena, all estimates are stated mathematically and process is computed in terms of equations, not in terms of will, human or divine. In like manner we have learned to reject, as ineffective, all other hypotheses of inner necessity or superimposed or infused metaphysical essences, forces, and other unanalyzed assumptions. Even the concepts of matter, energy, and motion are being analyzed into their constituent factors and these reduced, not to animistic and subjective, but to mechanistic and quantitative, terms. For essences and personalities in the physical world, both as causes and as results, we are substituting an evolving correlation of object and environment, measurable in quantitative terms and describable in physical terminology. We posit progress of any of these increasing correlations of object and environment when we single out any larger group of objects and assemble them in our thinking into a synthesis of measurable factors and forces and set this synthesis, as an environment, over against some object or smaller group of objects which is in process of reciprocal adjustment to the larger or environmental synthesis, or is moving toward equilibrium in it. In so far as we perceive an approach of the smaller toward an adjustment to or equilibrium in the larger synthesis we speak of progressive evolution. It does not matter particularly why this particular synthesis was selected by the human minds which made the selection, nor whether it hypothetically</page><page sequence="11">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 3I corresponds to some similar predetermined ordering of nature itself. The assumption of an "order of nature" is itself such an anthropomorphic selection of synthetic concepts of environments and objects, of processes, ends and results. We have not yet been able to work out such definite and detached statements of correlation in human and social phenomena with respect to terminology and selective synthesis of objects and environments and evolutional correlation of adjustments of one to the other. The reasons are, on the one hand, that we still describe correlations of social and mental phenomena in the subjective terminology of emotions and will; we think in qualitative terms of subjective attitudes rather than in those of quantitative measure- ment of relationship of object to environment. We think of causation as being directed from within outward, that is from object toward environment, instead of from outward within, or from environment to object. Of course, these terms, object and environ- ment, are interchangeable, and causation does proceed in both direc- tions, but primarily from the larger synthesis or aggregate to the smaller. Where the smaller or object aggregate is highly complex and effectively organized, due to accumulated focusing of previous and contemporary environmental pressures, as in the case of a think- ing being, the object may at any one moment work more effectively as a source of imputed causation than the environment. But in the long run the environment will be dominant as a causation source. On the other hand, we have not yet worked out the analysis of complex mental and social phenomena into their constituent mechanistic elements. Only gradually have we come to discover that mind has two dimensions instead of one, organization of concepts as well as action or will; that the nervous system has some relation to ideas and the control of conduct; that action in the last analysis is chemical and physical and not mystical or fiat. Psychol- ogy is just beginning to be linked with biology and biology with physics and chemistry, and the whole of social science is just entering on the stage of being subjected to rigid measurement and computation. Until these things are further along we cannot hope to objectify completely our statement of the social evolutionary processes, or of the ends and results in terms of which we may describe the social evolutionary process as progressive. Much</page><page sequence="12">32 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY progress has been made, however, in this direction in connection with biological evolution. We have got away from animistic and vitalistic (theological and metaphysical) categories in describing the processes of biological evolution. In so far as we shall be able to work out an objective statement and definition of the social environment, replacing the subjective vague attitudinal concepts with objective defined and measured mechanistic concepts, we shall have a developing basis for the working out of a quantitative state- ment of social evolution and the positing of a goal toward which a directed social evolution should move. It will be possible to evaluate ends in a definite terminology and to measure accurately progress toward these ends. That we are working on such an objectification of terminology and measurement is perfectly clear. That is the significance of the leading tendencies in the social sciences today. They are rapidly developing, on the one hand, in the direction of a quantitative analysis of environment with reference to a scientifically measured and evaluated resynthesis of these environments with reference to future social goals, and, on the other hand, toward the analysis of heredity as the result of past environmental pressures which have selected mutations and varia- tions for hereditary transmission and which still remain as factors in the contemporary social situation. As yet, however, no universally accepted objective tests for social progress have been worked out, although many attempts in this direction have been made.' It is a mistake to suppose that a complete statement of the ends of social progress can be formulated in the present state of the development of social science. All attempts are but partial and tentative, subject to revision as the analysis of the environment and of human nature is pushed further. No final statement of progress in any field can be made, although in some fields it is possible to look farther ahead than in others, where, either because of relative simplicity of phenomena or because of greater objectification of analytical terminology, it is possible to grasp the processes as a whole and in their various relationships. Always the statement of the conditions of social progress is tentative, more knowlege of the sciences and of the I See A. J. Todd, Theories of Social Progress, pp. II9-32, for an attempt of this sort. This book also contains a good bibliography.</page><page sequence="13">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 33 subject-matter of those sciences making further revisions possible and necessary. Any statement of the positive criteria of social progress is, therefore, helpful and valuable as a point of departure for further analysis and comparison.' Certain negative conditions of social progress also deserve more attention than they have hitherto received. Especially those physical and biological conditions which are largely or wholly out of the range of human influence to produce change have been neglected. The chief of these is probably the general course of cosmic evolution. One cannot view this process of cosmic develop- ment without being aware of the fact that man is but an incident of the whole developmental process rather than its sole aim and object, as was commonly thought until a few decades ago. If we should plot so much of the whole of cosmic evolution as our present knowledge of the universe would permit, viewing the whole from the standpoint of its influence upon the life-conditions of the earth, we would not know whether to plot the curve as a circle, ellipse, parabola, or hyperbole in form; or whether to represent it as return- ing upon itself, as spiral, or as continuous. All of these and other theories of the proper graphic representation of progress have been held. Without attempting to solve any of these at present unsolv- able problems, we may at least make a tentative representation of the curve of the terrestrial aspect of cosmic progress on the basis of co-ordinates as follows: a' I I~~Hu am I g-0A1e In this diagram there is no attempt to represent relative lengths of time by the amounts of space assigned to the different sections I An attempt at the summary and criticism of such views has been made by Todd, op. cit., chaps. vi and vii.</page><page sequence="14">34 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY on the curve, a thing which cannot as yet be done accurately and which is not necessary to our purposes. In the first period of terrestrial development there was no life, but only physical condi- tions. In the second period there were life-forms, but of such a low order that they had not developed mental life or expression, although they perhaps manifested behavior analogous to it. In the third period animal life had developed instinctive adjustments and lower types of perception and subjective valuations of adjust- ments to environment, but no objective, reflective, mental adjust- ments and valuations could be made. In the fourth period, which is distinctly human in character, objective rational control becomes possible and there seems to be a decided tendency to develop it, latterly through the medium of the social and other sciences. In the fifth period the conditions of existence for man may be expected to become so unfavorable, because of lowering of temperature, exhaustion of the atmosphere and moisture and the natural re- sources, and other conditions, that man's highly developed mental capacity may prove ineffective in exercising control over the subse- quent progressive evolution of society. In the sixth stage man as a type may disappear from the earth, having become so highly specialized to his environment that he cannot change the course of the evolution of his type, and therefore his species must give way to some other rising type which becomes dominant. What lies beyond this future hypothetical stage I cannot venture to suggest. If this arrangement of stages of terrestrial development (and similar, but more inclusive, stages might be arranged for the wider aspects of cosmic or universal evolution) is approximately correct, it will be seen that social progress occupies but a small section of the whole curve of terrestrial progress, and a still smaller portion of the curve of terrestrial evolution. There is much geologic and organic development toward certain anthropomorphic goals before man appears. At first his progress is more biological than social; but as human mental capacity and intellectual achievement develop, his progress gradually comes to be largely dominated by his thought organization. But the organization and manipulation of thought, even through the social and other sciences, cannot make headway against cosmic and terrestrial conditions in the large, when they happen to be antagonistic. So far there has been, within the times</page><page sequence="15">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 35 of which we have knowledge, a parallel or supplementary flow of cosmic and mental factors in their mutual support of social evolu- tion. The former, in fact, seems to have set the conditions for the development of the latter, it being impossible for mind and mental achievement to appear before an animal of a certain type had evolved, nor could this animal evolve and become dominant before certain physical and antecedent biological conditions of develop- ment had become manifest. We seem to live at that period of terrestrial and intellectual evolution which is most favorable to the development of an organized, intelligent, social control, or at least to be on the eve of its appearance. The incidental character of progressive social and mental evolution may be further illustrated by observing the probability that sometime in the future the cooling of the earth's surface, the drying up of its moisture and the dissipation of the atmosphere, especially of the lighter gases, and the consequent scarcity of supporting organic life, will probably reduce man to a condition where his intellectual powers and achievement will not be able to cope with his problems of existence and a process of social decline will follow the age of social progress. Not the least important contribution to this state of affairs will probably be the exhaustion of the natural resources, especially of coal and iron and of certain of the plant foods in the soil. For coal, as a source of power other than muscular in origin, there are inadequate substitutes in nature, any predictable adjustment of this sort being incapable of support- ing present industrial and demographic conditions. There are no substitutes for iron which can be made available in sufficiently large quantities to meet even moderate industrial demands. And the present rate of taxing the soil in agriculture will in the course of a few generations greatly diminish its fertility, especially in phosphorus and potassium. As substitutes for the various inorganic elements become increasingly difficult to obtain and yield constantly diminishing results, the fight for social progress, and ultimately for holding the achievement previously gained, may become impossibly difficult. The appearance of all these hard conditions will not necessarily produce a devolution of man's intellectual powers already evolved, but they may well, in the course of time, so diminish his intellectual</page><page sequence="16">36 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY achievement as to render the human outlook upon society less and less able either to estimate social progress and social values or to put them into effect. Man's great store of scientific data and technique, accumulated up to this time, should delay the day on which such a condition of social decline can take effect, but it cannot by any means permanently prevent its coming. Ultimately man must disappear from the earth, as have so many animal types before him; and probably long before he disappears his intellectual control over his adjustment to the environment will diminish or vanish. Another possibility is that he may be able to maintain a fair adjustment to his environment as long as the adjustment process leaves him leisure to keep up his scientific knowledge and technique, but, this once failing him for any cause, his whole scheme of physical and biological adjustments to his environment might collapse immediately under the heightened strain. Then the human type would disappear with a suddenness in marked contrast to the length of the period through which it developed. Aside from these physical and biological limitations upon social progress which man can do very little to control or change there is another problem or set of problems of great magnitude, the problem of perceiving and preferring the long-time good-the progress- of society to the immediate happiness of the individuals who by making choices determine social activities. This is a double problem in fact. It is both intellectual and emotional. Being able to analyze social processes to the point that distinctions of social values can be well made may be attained without the individual giving his consent to making the personal sacrifice necessary to put the progressive social programs into effect. There are, therefore, two programs which must be consciously undertaken in order to secure the largest measure of social progress with the least expendi- ture of effort. One is the development of social science and the dissemination of its data until practically all men and women understand the fundamental facts about society and social progress. This matter of the contribution of social science to social progress will be returned to later. The other problem is to tie up the affec- tive attitudes of all people with the social programs, once they have been worked out.</page><page sequence="17">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 37 This second problem is really one in social control. It involves the organization of society and the manipulation of the formative institutions in such a way as to habituate people to the performance of the functions which will make for social progress. We have not lacked for such control in the past, although much of the action resulting from it can scarcely be said to have contributed to social progress or even to immediate general social welfare. In primitive societies the formative institutions and the pressure of group opinion molded everyone into a large degree of conformity with a ruthlessness which was all the more powerful because it was mainly unconscious. In the historic stage of man's development this strong control has continued to exist. There has been somewhat of a weakening in recent times, especially since the industrial revolu- tion has, through its economic surplus, dissipated in large measure the pressure of want and, through its stimulation of intelligence, has stirred up a reaction against some of the old irrational controls. The industrial revolution has also had the effect of shifting the emphasis in character formation from some institutions to others. Thus the family, for example, being no longer the dominant center of industrial organization and activity, has lost much of its former prestige and molding power. Industry being no longer local, but national and international, in its organization, the old fixity of the small community is broken up and larger non-face-to-face associa- tions or publics take the place of the community group as mold- ers of opinion and action and as disseminators of social values. The press, the movie, and the street haranguer largely replace the parent, preacher, and village prophets in directing the thoughts and emotions of people and in keeping their feet in the paths they should tread. But these shifts in emphasis upon formative institutions and groupings have not destroyed social control; they have merely changed its locus and methods. That men's opinions and affections and actions can be effectively controlled is clearly shown by the results achieved in this respect during the recent Great War. In every belligerent country the masses of the people were, through the manipulation of their thoughts and emotions, wholly certain of the righteousness of their country's cause, even when the aims of dif-</page><page sequence="18">38 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY ferent countries were so directly antagonistic. They were even forced into such a condition of heightened emotionality and depressed intellectuality that they could be induced by designing manipulations of public opinion to believe that any criticism of profiteers and grafters and the inefficient and selfish holders of public place, was not patriotism, but treason. The vast and complex system of daily newspapers, periodicals, theaters, lecturers, posters, and advertisements, the organization of discussion through clubs and round tables, can put into effect with an irresistible force any set of opinions or attitudes of social evaluation for which there is strong enough desire in the minds of those who are in a position to manipulate such things. As governments become stronger and concentrate in their hands more and more of the social and indus- trial organization and functions they can bring increasingly concen- trated pressure to put into effect such programs. Such molding of opinion and attitude can be accomplished quickly in times of great public stress, such as a war. It must go more slowly in peace time, or when there is no great feeling of anxiety; but this very slowness may afford an opportunity for working out the details of manipu- lation and control with all the more thoroughness. The relatively unsolved problem in connection with the manipu- lation of social control for purposes of social progress is to induce the makers of opinions and attitudes to understand and promote programs for social progress. Such results probably cannot be accomplished out of hand by preaching at these individuals. Neither is it certain that the idealism of the social scientists-where such idealism exists-can effectively communicate its passion for human welfare and social progress to the common run of students who study with them, although something can be done in this way. There are signs that the preachers, who still retain a considerable measure of influence with the people, are being "socialized " in their outlook, that is, are having their ethical valuations and aesthetic attachments assimilated to social welfare and progress concepts instead of to the old traditions of magic, ritual, mythology, and a more or less barbarian standard of culture, which has been their prevailing stock in moral trade. But it is to be feared that they no longer reach the real makers of opinion and attitude, at</page><page sequence="19">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 39 least in any considerable numbers. The teachers in the lower schools, if we can count on their absorbing the social welfare view- point from their studies and experiences-which should always include a large amount of sociology and social observation or social work-should be able to do the most effective propaganda work. They reach the minds of future citizens when they are young and impressionable and when the emotional response is likely to be strong and sympathetic. But we cannot always count on the teacher having a social viewpoint, especially one so sophisticated and detached as would take adequate account of the conditions of social progress. The curricula for the training of teachers are now occupied almost wholly with psychological and mechanical methods of teaching, hygiene of the child and sanitation of the school, and with drill in the content of the subjects to be taught. These are all good as far as they go, but they omit the most important con- sideration of all, the training of the child in the evaluation of life and that great super-organism of life-society. Present methods of training teachers are largely negative in so far as moral and social training is concerned. Perhaps the largest present problem in the socialization of the outlook of the maker of opinion and attitude in society is a legislative and administrative one. This socialization may be accomplished through shifting his interests. Our whole social organization, governmental and industrial, is based primarily on competition and the chance to exploit the weakness, ignorance, or carelessness of others. Charity and benevolence are incidents which arise out of the situation as mitigating factors, where the competitive struggle is so hard as to prove disastrous; they are not the normal and accepted foundations of society. Co-operation is to be almost exclusively found within closely consolidated groups whose members have a common interest, while competition is waged as fiercely as ever, perhaps more fiercely, between these relatively closed groups. Society as a whole has not yet evolved into a great co-operating organism, where weakness and ignorance are not exploited, but are removed or mitigated and educated into efficiency. While the interests of controlling individuals are so closely tied up with a competitive regime it is scarcely likely that they will utilize their</page><page sequence="20">40 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY instruments for opinion- and attitude-making-the press, the controlled formative institution, and the publicity agent and advertising apparatus-to propagate ideas for social welfare and social progress in direct opposition to their immediate interests and desires. What legal and legislative changes would be involved in promot- ing a change of interests in the body of the citizens more favorable to social welfare and progress is a matter of dispute. But it is not inconceivable that social science can determine this matter. While no single panacea will accomplish the desired results, many present economic and social reforms now proposed would probably con- tribute much toward them. Such changes of course cannot be legislated into effect by fiat, but must depend on a popular intel- ligence regarding society and social well-being which is actually represented in the law-making bodies. They presuppose freedom of teaching, freedom from misinformation by the controlled publicity agencies, and freedom from censorship and suppression of ideas and organizations existing for legitimate social propaganda purposes. These conditions do not exist, at least adequately. Perhaps it may be urged that they cannot be made to exist; but apparently there is a steady growth of scientific fact, in spite of all opposition, which sets the minds of men free in large measure from misrepresentation of fact and motives. The findings of the physical sciences had to wage uncertain warfare against selfish institutional and personal interests in past centuries, but unques- tionable fact, carrying its proof in objective demonstration, finally won out against selfish error which lacked objectivity and lost because of lack of universality in its subjective appeal. In the past century the biological sciences passed through the same struggle, and won, for the same reasons. This and the next centuries will probably see the same victorious fight, championed by the social sciences, waged for the dominance of objective demonstrable truth regarding social phenomena, over subjective systems of error and the propaganda and intimidation supporting these. If the truths regarding normal social processes could be made as much the com- mon possession of the masses of citizens as those of physical and biological phenomena now are there would still be no adequate</page><page sequence="21">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 4I assurance that we could secure as rational and altruistic a control over society as we can over the physical and the biological worlds. For these latter are more detached from the interests and passions of man, and are less subject in their manipulation to his whim and emotion. But it is likely that under such conditions the common interests of the larger majorities could be made to win out over those of the smaller minorities. But to make certain that the future interests of mankind shall triumph over the merely immediate, when they conflict, that social progress as well as social welfare shall be promoted, is a more difficult task. People do not easily tie up their affections with a vaguely perceived and impersonal future. They live mainly in the present. To secure a proper regard for the interests of social progress it is necessary to make people live in the future also. One of the most effective, although perhaps not the most intellectualized or far-seeing, methods of securing this in the past has been through the close connection between parent and offspring. But productive marriages are not so numerous now and the organization of the home and of society, especially the industrial organization, is not such now as to promote this result with the same effectiveness as for- merly. A growth of knowledge of the social sciences, especially of the theories of social progress and their general dissemination, should project the sympathetic understandings of men farther into the future and tend to identify them in some measure with it. Such an understanding must ultimately and inevitably carry over into the execution of certain programs, necessary even for the present generation, such as the practice of conservation, the con- struction of public works, warfare against disease, the dissemination of certain kinds of knowledge, the control of unrestrained action by men and states, leading possibly to warfare or other forms of anti-social exploitation. These undertakings may often serve to connect, in the minds of their promoters, the interests of the future generations with those of the present, thus leading to the planning of inclusive programs to cover the needs of as many generations as possible. Some of the major conflicts between individual interests and subjective satisfactions on the one hand and social progress and</page><page sequence="22">42 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY welfare on the other, which are possibly within the power of man to control, have already been subjected more or less to analysis and provisional statement. One of the most significant of these arises in connection with the control of population. That there is a fundamental conflict between unlimited population and social progress, even social welfare, has been more or less evident at least since the days of Malthus. The problem of the rational control of population for social progress is to discover that balance between population and resources, including food, soil, metals and minerals, plants and animals, which will foster the most economic methods of production and give the best opportunity for the development of the richest possible personalities. Merely to state the problem is by no means to solve it. To find a solution is to work out these ends in the greatest detail. Neither are the conditions for the achievement of this balanced adjustment between population and environment constant. Some of the most fundamental aspects of environment, especially the natural resources and the inventive and transforming technique, are constantly changing, and sometimes in opposite directions. The consequence is that the calculus of population adjustment is a most difficult one, even if we can get the consent and co-operation of all members of society to put it into practice. Of more importance, some will say, is the problem of arranging a fair distribution of income, that is, ultimately, of purchasing- power and of the control of leisure for work and the development of normal and efficient personality. If an equal distribution of income would secure these ends the problem would be much more simple than it is, at least in technique of distribution. But such would not serve the best interests of social welfare or of social progress. Hence, again, the need for a most complicated calculation of the ca- pacities and willingness of men to contribute to social progress. The problem of social justice, as formerly conceived, covered only a part of this field, for social justice was regarded primarily as a social imperative to give all men a fair chance at the enjoyment of consumption goods and leisure. A distribution of income for purposes of securing social progress goes much beyond this and recognizes the old social justice as only a secondary social value,</page><page sequence="23">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 43 holding that the highest test of the value of a scheme of distribution must be in terms of its contribution to a better organized and adjusted society, now and in the future. The desirability and problem of training people to take the social as opposed to the subjective and hedonistic viewpoint has already been dealt with at some length. Of similar importance is the training of people to choose the long-time in contrast with the short-time social and individual values, to prefer conservation of materials, health and energy, and of time, to the waste of these commodities. One of the strongest criticisms of our outlook in civilization is that we as a people do not know how best to use our time or how to choose our values in living. It is in effect a criticism of both our educational system and of our philosophies of life. The former has not yet been organized to take care of the most important adjustment problems in life and the latter cannot be worked out intelligently or put in practice until we know more of the relationships of society and the possibilities of adjustment of the individual in society, now and in the future. In other words, a fuller and more rational philosophy of life must await the further development of the social sciences. Modern social life has become increasingly complex and the increase in this direction shows no abatement. We have a hundred social problems to solve where our great grandfathers had one or none. The very process of earning a livelihood has become complicated with an infinite number of details of scientific and mechanical technique, with markets and marketing, the problems of credit and exchange, business and government, and the like. A score, a hundred, a thousand problems of health and sanitation have arisen where formerly was only the bliss of ignorance. The very technique of living, of mastering and enjoying the comforts of life, the volume of social intercourse, the richness of opportunity for amusement, all these and scores of other things oppress us and steal from us the leisure for creative work and time for rest and recuperation. They drive us irresistibly toward the accumulation of more income with which to satisfy ever new and increasing demands. We are unable to detach ourselves from the details of life long enough to grasp its meaning and to plan for social progress.</page><page sequence="24">44 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY If we are to withstand the strain of this process and be effective in the struggle for social improvement we must either find some method of mastering the complexity of life or invent a formula or formulae for its simplification. Apparently we cannot look for a mutation of our nervous systems which will enable us to handle more details with less nervous strain. Hence our greatest hope would seem to lie in the direction of a better selection of the details of living which we find worth while and the better organization of these into an administrative whole. It is here that we can best apply our im- proved philosophy of life and add to it an effective social control which will aid in its administration. This brings us finally to the contribution of science to social progress, the supreme aid to a progressive evolution of social phenomena. Of course science cannot transcend the natural limitations upon social progress, such as were discussed earlier in this article. It can only recognize them and make the closest possible adjustment to them, utilize them by means of a closely analyzed adjustment, instead of allowing them to constitute an obstacle to social progress because of the lack of this adjustment. Science is merely accurate, dependable, quantitative knowledge regarding the nature of objects and environments and the technique or method by which processes and results are produced. It cannot, as even some scientists seem to believe, produce magical results contrary to nature. It studies nature, discovers the laws of change and correlation in phenomena, and makes use of these principles and data for the bringing about of further and better articulated adjustments and correlations wholly within the limits of natural processes. This procedure is as true of the mental and social sciences as of the physical and biological sciences, although this fact is not generally recognized. The tradition of the lawlessness of mind and will, which has afflicted us, has rendered it somewhat difficult to develop and secure the acceptance of truly scientific methods in the fields of mental and social phenomena. But behaviorism in psychology and a due recognition of environment as a factor in Sociology, both placing the emphasis upon inter-causal adaptation and correlation, rather than upon fiat, in human events,</page><page sequence="25">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 45 are working rapidly toward the development of scientific thinking and control in these fields. The widespread opposition to the scientific method comes primarily from the sentimentalists and the culturalists. The sentimentalists dislike the disturbing character of science. It is ruthless in its tendency to uproot old beliefs and emotional ties. It insists upon substituting definite and detailed knowledge for vague expectation and roseate hope or temperamental despair. When the question of social progress is up, it calculates, for example, the coal and iron supply and figures on substitutes, a procedure which the sentimental optimist detests, preferring to leave the whole matter to Providence or to chance, unwilling to cloud his enjoyment of the present with sordid details of fact. The artistic or aesthetic habit of mind is essentially sentimental, for both are habituated to impressionistic judgments-or attitudes-based on emotional, rather than analytically intellectual, reactions. Hence the artist type-whether in the person of the theologian and reli- gious dogmatist or of the secular aesthete-is invariably opposed to science and the scientific interpretation of life. It wears on him. He is married to an impressionistic or dogmatic ideal, and his peace of soul is dependent upon its remaining intact. Hisworld is a figment of dreams, instead of an analytical and synthetic construct of life and society as it is. Instead of adapting his consciousness and his self to a real world, scientifically determined, he attempts to adapt the world to his selected consciousness. He prefers the illusion of a subjective interpretation of life to the unsettledness and disillu- sionment of life as it is. Consequently, social progress consists for him in any condition of things which increases his subjective satis- factions, and any objective tests of social progress must be measured in this light. Science is of use to him only when it can be made to increase these subjective satisfactions, and since the self which is to be fed with satisfaction is largely subjectively determined and selected more with the aid of aesthetic and dogmatic traditions than under the guidance of an objective analysis of and adjustment to the actual external world, science is more likely to disturb and disintegrate than to heighten and strengthen the feelings of satisfac-</page><page sequence="26">46 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY tion in this self. Hence, the lack of welcome accorded science by the sentimentalist. The devotee of the traditional culture belongs in the same category with the sentimentalist. He has his emotional life, his ideas, and habits of thought and expression adjusted to certain types of traditional mental content. The intellectual and emo- tional expression which has come up to him from the past and is redolent with old associations and illusions, which possesses a certain exclusiveness which removes it from participation by the common herd, and which, above all, has acquired a sort of settledness and constancy which mean restfulness and the sheltered life-the traditional concomitants of the academic and cultivated mind- have come to mean culture. They represent the cultus instead of the uncertain world of struggle and change. Science, with its profane hands and irreverent soul, is an object of aversion, some- times of horror. It leaves nothing alone, respects nothing, but seeks only to overturn the comfortable world; is democratic and leveling, instead of exclusive. The traditional culturist is not interested in social progress, possibly does not believe in its exist- ence. His eyes are toward the past, which, at his distance and through his clouded glasses, looks settled and serene. When he turns his gaze toward the future he sees only uncertainty and strife and change. Science, which dominates the future, in its passion for a changing world which it calls progressive, would crush his beloved philology or philosophy or aesthetics, or replace it, would exalt machines and chemical formulae above hieroglyphics and medieval symbolism, would make of the schools economic and mechanical laboratories instead of vapor baths for the droning somnalescent soul. But it is this same science, caricatured and detested by the culturist, which has done most for traditional culture in the modern world by endowing it with shady retreats and funds for research and publication, for which there could be no adequate commercial reward. It is this science also which has given us a tangible, intelligible world in which we can have a certain measure of confi- dence and understanding, in spite of its turmoil and changing character, without isolating ourselves from contact with the actual</page><page sequence="27">THE CONDITIONS OF SOCIAL PROGRESS 47 world of today. And above all, it is this science which must solve the riddle of the future. Traditional culture has turned its eyes to the past and bows its head in reverence. Science questions and analyzes all things, boldly seeking some way in which to master phenomena instead of worship them. It is science which analyzes and plots the world, the universe, in detail, and indicates the con- structive uses to which each part may be put. Science, working in the service of social progress, must solve innumerable problems of adjustment of man to his environment by means of the process of analysis and reorganization of adjust- ments. Among these some of the more outstanding ones are the limitation of population, the conservation of inorganic and organic resources, the improvement of plant and animal breeds, the perfect- ing of programs of eugenics and euthenics, provision for a proper distribution of wealth, the organization of the social and technique processes of production and distribution so as to secure the most economic results from the expenditure of the effort involved, the organization of society for the provision of the largest possible returns in human welfare in its many aspects, the control and organization of economic and political structure and functions with the aim of the promotion of science for the purpose of producing the maximum of knowledge and the provision of institutions and methods for its preservation, and the promotion of the dissemina- tion of this knowledge to all men, and of training in the methods of independent thought under proper tests of accuracy and controls. While social progress would not be impossible without a system of universal and profound education, it would be greatly facilitated by rendering all people self-directive through a full knowledge of the world and society in which they live. The service of modern science to social progress has just begun. This science is only a century or two old and is scarcely yet accepted by the majority of men. There clings about it still something of the mystery and repulsiveness of black magic, in the midst of which it was born. But this antagonism to it will fade, just as opposition to all other valuable things in society has disappeared when their value has been demonstrated. It is the key which, through its analysis of phenomena, unlocks the mysteries of man's environment</page><page sequence="28">48 THE AMERICAN JOURNAL OF SOCIOLOGY and reveals to him those forces and factors which produce and control him and which he can employ in the control of his environ- ment. Not magic, nor traditional culture, nor the faithful, trusting heart, but the knowledge and technique of science, can set man free from the forces, mainly those of ignorance and fear, which have enslaved him. Likewise, it is science which must point the way for a future more progressive control of the process of man's social evolution. This process in the last analysis is a matter of details as well as inclusiveness of concepts, and only science can provide both.</page></plain_text>
