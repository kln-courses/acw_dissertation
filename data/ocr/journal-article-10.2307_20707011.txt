Yale University Publications in Anthro pology, No. 81. New Haven: Yale University Press, 1998. 262 pp., bibs., figs, maps, photos, tables, n.p. (paper). SIDSEL N. MILLERSTROM University of California at Berkeley This volume is the documented result of Barry V. Rolett's archaeological exca vation and research conducted since 1984 in Hanamiai, Tahuata. The author combines archaeological, ethnohistoric, ethnographic, linguistic and paleobotanical data to argue for environmental and sociopolitical changes from the time Hanamiai was first settled around A.D.I 100 to the mid-19th century. Important dimensions are added to our knowledge on inter-island and long distance voyaging by recent re search on geochemical sourcing of basalt lithics. The most striking aspect of Prehistoric Colonization and Cultural Change in the Marquesas Islands (East Poly nesia) is that it addresses virtually every major research issue that has engaged social scientists concerned with the Polynesian past over the past several decades. The circumstances related to initial colonisation and settlement in the Marquesas, for instance, is a longstanding controversy that is still not satisfactorily resolved. This volume is organised into 11 chapters. In the first three parts Rolett provides background information that includes an extensive overview of the present stage of research on voyaging, colonisation and dynamics that led to cultural change. Rolett also discusses in detail issues related to geology, climate, vegetation and native spe cies. With regard to initial human adaptation in the Marquesas, Rolett and others who write about the archipelago rightly attribute a wide range of physical, social and environmental constraints, such as an unpredictable pattern of rainfall, severe droughts, relative absence of coral reefs, sharp mountain ridges, and extensive coastal cliffs that created natural barriers to land communication between valleys. The last statement (pp. 13,17,19), however, is unsubstantiated and needs further examination. This notion, I believe, dates back to E. S. C. Handy's 1923 publication The Native Culture in the Marquesas (Bernice P. Bishop Museum Bulletin 9). To Europeans, the tall peaks, crags, and steep mountain chains may have appeared unsurpassable, but to the Marquesans they were part of their landscape. Early historic accounts by the</page><page sequence="2">Reviews 325 missionary William Pascoe Crook (1797-98) and the beachcomber Edward Robarts (1797-1824), two Westerners who lived in the islands for extensive periods of time, related that they, accompanied by Marquesans, frequently walked over most of the islands (see also pp. 14-15 of Nicholas Thomas's Marquesan Societies). Thus, we cannot assume that tall and steep mountain ranges formed social barriers in the past and that they prevented the Marquesans from exploring and exploiting other valleys. Owing to demographic pressure, warfare, and lack of arable land and resources, the marginal upper parts of the valleys first became occupied in the late prehistoric era. People without access to the sea, because of unfriendly neighbours, had to walk over the mountain to the nearest shores. Rolett's statement that "...the tapu on pork meant that is was usually only con sumed by men" (p.92) needs further explanation. It may be that on an ideological level Marquesan women were not allowed to consume pork. Early explorers, how ever, observed that, except during times of tapu, women consumed pork when they were alone. Even during tapu, high status women would eat pork in the absence of men or when no one was looking. If they were eating pork, men would look the other way. The Marquesan women, it appears, had more autonomy than the written sources show. This is largely because men wrote all the early accounts. Rolett's review of past and present fishing strategies based on ethnographic ob servation is charming. Allow me to add another fishing strategy?night fishing with torch and machete?a practice in which the local residents in Anaho sometimes engage. Anaho, a protected bay located on the north coast of Nuku Hiva Island, is one of the few Marquesan bays with a reef system?thus, fishing practices here differ somewhat from those of the rest of the islands. At high tide the fishing party walk in shallow water along the shoreline with a lantern. While the lantern attracts the fish, usually mullet and needlefish, the fishermen, with great dexterity, hit the fish over the head with a machete. Stunned and often beheaded, the fish is quickly scooped up by the person who follows with a bucket. In view of his excellent background on local fishing strategies, his analysis of the Hanamiai fish remains could, perhaps, be taken to another level. While the fish bones were well worked up, certain bones of the fish (e.g., fish skulls), were only identified to a Family level. As many more bones, including vertebrae in some fish, are diagnostic, the data set may have more information to yield. If the vertebrae can be measured from different dated strata, they can show a clear change over time in average size. An identification to the level of species or even genus helps to inform us about the behaviour of the fish, which is further indicative of fishing practices and procurement by humans. This is especially important in fish that are variable in their size, habitat, and feeding and schooling behaviour. In terms of fish remains, Pacific archaeologists lag behind in their faunal work. In most of the continental U.S., the Caribbean and South America, faunal analysis identifies fish remains to as low a taxonomic level as possible. Some Pacific archaeologists may take issue with Rolett's assertion that "fishing technology is the most archaeologically visible aspect of Marquesan material cul ture" (p. 147). For instance, the Ha'atuatua dune sites excavation, directed by B.V. Rolett and E. Conte, yielded some 2700 lithic artefacts (J. Kahn 1996: Prehistoric</page><page sequence="3">326 Reviews Stone Tool Use and Manufacture at the Ha'atuatua Dune Site, Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia). Even more visible are the approximately 6000 individual images carved on boulder and stone slabs located throughout the archipelago (S. Millerstrom 1997: Carved and Painted Rock Images in the Marquesas Islands, French Polynesia). In Chapter 8, Rolett provides the results of his recent research using some of the major cutting-edge techniques available to archaeologists. Geochemical analysis on basalt adzes from Hanamiai identify chemical characteristics of lithics to their geo logical sources. A total of 38 complete and fragmented adzes and 57 adze flakes were uncovered during the Hanamiai excavation. Eighty-four adzes and adze flakes were analysed by x-ray fluorescence and electron-microprobe methods. Forty-one of the adzes identified Eiao, an island located some 130 km north of Tahuata, as a local Marquesan source. Some lithics were determined to come from a yet to be identified local source. This information, in concert with excavated adzes from dated cultural deposits, determined the frequency and change of transported lithic arte facts over time, and has significantly changed our view on inter-island and long distance voyaging. Chapter 9 examines changes in other aspects of subsistence-related Marquesan technology such as coral files and abraders, sea-urchin-spine abraders, shell chisels and gouges, and worked cobbles. Ornaments including whale-tooth pendants, pierced Cypraea shells, pearl shell and bone buttons demonstrate a clear contrast between the early and late periods of the Hanamiai cultural sequence. Unfortunately, several years after the excavation a well-carved tiki (anthropomorphic sculpture) in human bone was collected by a local resident, when the site was bulldozed to make room for a soccer field (Fig. 9.7, p.229). Based primarily on fishing implements and adze assemblages, Rolett identifies two distinct trends. First, there is a lack of archaeologically visible regional varia tion within the Marquesas. Second, the pattern seen in the artefact assemblage from the Hanamiai Phase I and II and similar documented artefacts from other early Marquesan cultural complex closely resemble artefacts previously excavated by Sinoto at Huahine in the Society Islands. The lack of archaeologically visible regional vari ation within the Marquesan prehistoric artefacts is also noted in the distribution of rock art types. Research to date shows that the Marquesan rock art repertoire is remarkably homogeneous and repetitive. Rolett synthesises the result of his research and describes the successive five Hanamiai sequences in Chapter 10. His conclusions on colonisation, cultural trans formation, and central East Polynesian voyaging spheres are summarised in Chapter 11. As a final note, the book contains a generous number of maps, tables and photo graphs. All illustrations are clean with no gaps. Some readers may find it somewhat arrogant that a few of the French quotations lack translations (pp.36,37). While the content pages are fairly detailed, an index would have been useful. Personally, I would have liked to have seen more discussions related to the Marquesan people of the past who created the many objects that were carefully excavated, described, and analysed in detail. Regardless, this volume is a thoughtfully and scholarly executed publication, and it is a welcome addition to the literature on Polynesian archaeology.</page></plain_text>
