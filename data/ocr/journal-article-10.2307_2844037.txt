<plain_text><page sequence="1">13 AFRICAN SYMBOLISM Henry Myers Lecture, 1952 BY EDWIN W. SMITH 1. I esteem it an honour to be invited by the Council of the Royal Anthropological Institute to deliver the fourth lecture of this series. In the first of them Professor Radcliffe-Browne expounded the thesis that a religion, independent of its truth or falsity, has an effective function as part of the complex system by which human beings are enabled to live together in an orderly arrangement of social relations. Professor Raymond Firth showed how religious beliefs and practices are related to the attempts of individuals to secure coherence in their universe of relations, both physical and social. Professor E. 0. James carried inquiry a stage further by considering religion in terms of reality, value and validity. Historical truth, he said, is only one aspect of Reality. " At a deeper level of experience there are recurrent situations of profound emotional significance which can only find expression in symbolic representation." I propose to offer you some remarks on symbolism, drawing material from the field with which I am most familiar-Africa, to wit. 2. I will deal first with the general question: What is the nature and what are the functions of symbols? Etymologically theword denotes a throwing together. The German equivalent Sinnbild suggests that a symbol contains and conveys a picture of meaning. The semanticists'say that a symbol is an outstretched finger pointing to a referent (Walpole, 1941, p. 104). Coleridge (1825, p. 173) takes it to be an actual part chosen to represent the whole. From the behaviourist point of view Charles Morris (1946, p. 355) considers that a symbol acts as a substitute for some other sign with which it is synonymous. Dr. Nadel appears to agree with this: symbols. he says, " are substitutes, capable of ' initiating ' a particular behaviour in the absence of the stimuli normally producing it" (1951, p. 297). For Freudians " symbolism" denotes the process whereby one idea is used (mostly unwittingly) as a substitute for an unconscious idea; in other words, a symbol is the veiled, masked expression of a thought in a fantastic form which contains an analogy (Jones, 1951, p. 130; Pfister, 1913, p. 274). On the other hand, Suzanne Langer (1942, p. 60) asserts that symbols are not proxy for their objects, but are "vehicles for the conception of objects ". "The human mind ", says Whitehead (1928, p. 9), " is functioning symbolically when some components of its experience elicit consciousness, beliefs,- emotions and usages respecting other components of experi- ence." An American sociologist, Kimball Young (1946, p. 565), puts it in this way: a symbol is something " which stands for, represents, or serves to recall a meaningful experience, and which directs mental and actional associations ". A symbol is thus definable in relation to something else that is called its referent, object or designatum. We may summarize the various views by saying that a symbol points to a referent; pictures the referent's meaning; is an instrument for comprehending a referent; is a part which represents the whole, or is a surrogate for the whole, serving to recall to mind an absent referent. Symbols, says an authoritative writer on Mysticism, are " the clothing which the spiritual borrows from the material plane " (Underhill, 1923, p. 95). The visible stands for the invisible; the material for the immaterial; the palpable, the grasp- able, for what cannot be seized by the sensory organs. A French writer (Monod, 1950, p. 13) calls a symbol signe visible d'une invisible re'alite'; but there is a fundamental difference between the two kinds of signal. A sign relates to and announces something</page><page sequence="2">14 EDWIN W. SMITH which is known to exist: thus, a red light is semiotic it tells that the road is closed to traffic; wet streets are a sign that it has rained or is raining. A symbol, on the other hand, indicates something which indeed exists, or is postulated to exist, but which is dimly or partially apprehended or is in itself incomprehensible: it is the best description possible of a relatively unknown fact1 Symbols bring home to men's hearths and bosoms what is inaccessible to the under- standing. All words, all articulate utterances, are symbols. And a symbol may be a material object; it may be an animal, a person, a rite, a ritual, an institution, or, as Dr. Fortes says, " a complex of a material object together with the ideas, beliefs, attitudes and con- ventional actions associated with it." And he adds the important point: " It always carries a strong emotional charge and has the value of a direct moral imperative " (1945, p. 136 n.). The material symbol may have no intrinsic value or significance in itself; indeed its symbolic value may be in inverse proportion to its intrinsic value; and it may bear no apparent resemblance to its referent. The piece of coloured bunting which you can buy for a few pence and which we call the Union Jack, stands in the eyes of a patriotic Briton for all the values of the British Empire: values for the sake of which he would lay down his life although he may have but the dimmest notion of what those values are. It is its historical associations, not its form and colour, that give it meaning. On the other hand a wedding ring, both through its shape and the value attached to its constituent metal, carries a suggestion and a promise of a precious never-ending affection. Some noises and some marks and some objects mean nothing in particular; other mean a very great deal. Their meaningfulness depends upon an inter- preting mind. The cuneiform impressed upon an Assyrian tile, the hieroglyphics on an Egyptian papyrus, mean less to me than the Lord's' Prayer printed in Choctaw; but some people can read the symbols. They know the language and they know the script ; and to this extent the symbols are rational. 1 This is the distinction drawn by C. G. Jung (1923, p. 601). Raymond Firth (1951, p. 176) says that in a sign the relation between one entity and another is intrinsic or integral. " A symbol, on the other hand, is an object or action that represents another entity in virtue of some arbitrarily assigned conceptual relation between them." Heavy dark clouds are a sign of rain. In Australian mythology the Rainbow Serpent is a qsmbol of rain and its concomitant, fertility. But a true symbol can never be fully explained2, for in part at least it is the product of the imagination- "reason in its most exalted mood "-its appeal is to the feelings, its meaning is grasped by intuition. You can understand a people's symbols, only in so far as you enter sympathetically into their daily experience and see the world through their eyes. " Expression," says Whitehead (1927, p. 117) " is the one fundamental sacrament. It is the outward and visible sign of an inward and spiritual grace ". The relation between " sign " and " grace " enshrines a mystery. In spite of all that has been said on the subject, the process seems inscrutable by which light. and sound waves impinging upon my eyes and ears are transmuted into something which appears to be of an entirely different nature-percepts and concepts; so that, by means of those physical vibrations, I am enabled to interpret the thought and intention of the person from whom they originate. Shakespeare, speaking 350 years ago with the voice of a Hamlet and a Prospero, can still arouse thought and emotion in ourselves through the spoken or printed symbols. Leonardo da Vinci and Michelangelo can do the same through visible symbols-paintings and sculptures. The Flag which flew day and night over the ruined Residency at Lucknow had the same mysterious power to evoke emotion and stimulate noble action. This response to the stimulus of symbols is not peculiar to any ethnic group: it appears to be universal. There would seem to be an innate tendency to symbolization everywhere. Certain symbols, such as Light and Darkness, Heaven and Earth, crop up among many peoples, ancient and modern, so much so that they may be called racial symbols. Their wide extension provides a problem for anthropologist and psycho- logist-a problem which Jung seeks to solve by his hypothesis of a collective unconscious. The human mind everywhere works by noting likeness and difference and by classifying things accordingly. It delights in drawing analogy: this thing, it says, is like another in some known respects, so probably it is like it in other respects which are not known. I assume an element of identity in the two things. Analogy thus argues from the part to the whole. Occulists would object to my using the word " probably ", for in their doctrine the correspondence 2 Jacobi, 1951, p. 114, cc The content of a symbol can never be fully expressed rationally. .. . We can make its rational component comprehensible to consciousness; its irrational component we can grasp only with our feelings."</page><page sequence="3">African Symbolism 15 between appearance and reality, the seen and the unseen worlds, is implicit and complete. Their axiom is Quod superius sicut quod inferius. Analogy, they say, is the Key to all the secrets of nature. The argument from analogy may be pushed to absurd lengths, and lead sadly astray, but while it cannot offer proof it has its value as a mode of advancing knowledge. Psychologists employ analogy when they speak of " psychic energy ". We are analogizing when we speak of " a mother country ", " a fatherland ", " a child race ". Many peoples, including Africans, draw the analogy between a fruitful mother and the teeming earth. Evidently we have in analogy the root of much, if not of all, symbolism: the analogue be- comes the symbol. Mother, father, child, are universal symbols. " In the widest sense ", says McDougall (1950, p. 106), " every instance in which the perception of some part, some aspect, or some quality of an object provokes the reaction appropriate to the object as a whole, every such reaction is an instance of this function, the use of symbols." Analogy, and the symbolism based upon it, are not infallible, in the sense that they may arouse emotions and beliefs which further knowledge shows to be fallacious. Men, whether civilized or uncivilized, speak more than one language. There is a language which science aims at talking though it does not always succeed (social anthropology in particular): precise in its vocabulary, univocal, geometrically fixed; to use the somewhat disdainful words of a literary artist, " a botanical collection of colourless, scentless, dried weeds, each individual symbol poorly tethered to some single object or idea" (Raleigh, 1918, p. 41). Over against this there is the language spoken, at various levels, by common folk and poets: pictorial, analogical, equivocal, ambiguous, chameleon-like in its variability. This language may be visual as well as oral, appealing to us both by eye-gate and by ear-gate. It may, that is to say, express ideas through material, non-verbal, symbols. The florist's advice is: " Say it with flowers." It is to this pictorial language that meta- phor, simile, allegory, types, archetypes, rituals, dramatizations belong. This language even science is compelled to talk when it wishes to communicate its findings to ordinary laymen. It is compelled to substantialize its concepts. If the physicist is to convey his ideas he must drape their inscrutable nakedness in garments borrowed from the world of sense. Thus, if Sir James Jeans attempted to expound in mathematical terms the movement of the ultimate particles of matter, he would utterly fail, so far as I am concerned; but when he likens the movements to the movements of kangaroos hopping about in a field, I get a notion of his meaning. So when Sir Arthur Eddington (1929, p. 342) says that stepping on a plank is really like stepping on a swarm of flies he gets some glimmering of the modern theory of matter across to my infantile mind. I am like the child Sir James Jeans speaks about (1942, p. 9)-the child who when beginning to earn algebra never takes kindly to X, Y, Z; he is only satisfied when you tell him they are numbers of apples or pears. The child- which is myself and most of humankind-wants some- thing concrete on which he can lay hold. Therein lies the philosophy of symbolism. And when physicists communicate on a technical level, their mathematical formulae are symbolical. They have gone far, marvellously far, in their explora- tion of the nature of things, but Sir James Jeans acknowledges that " our studies can never put us into contact with reality: we can never penetrate beyond the impression that reality implants in our minds ". " Yet," says he, " partial aspects of the truth can be made comprehensible through pictorial representations or parables" (1942, p. 16). Such symbols may be related to objective facts no more closely than letters are related to sounds or notes of a score to musical tones. As Eddington says (1929, p. 338): " We have to build the spiritual world out of symbols taken from our own personality as we build the scientific world out of the metrical symbols of the mathematician ". Symbolism is the natural idiom of the artist. What has been said of painting may be said of symbolism in general: its aim is to make the invisible visible. And philosophy does not disdain it. " The soul never thinks without an image ", said Aristotle. When in his speculations Plato reached the limits of ratio- cination, he (as Lowes Dickinson finely says) shakes the wings of his imagination and flies into another world. He clothes his gospel in the exquisite form of a myth (Dickinson, 1950, p. 52). When he would expound the process of attaining the absolute Good which is above knowledge, or truth, or being, he says " Picture men in an underground cave .. (Plato, Republic, vii). Religion, it is said, is a form of human art (Firth, 1951, p. 250). Its method is certainly analogous to that of art. As a Turner seeks to transfer his vision by means of pigment on to canvas, and to some degree not satisfying to himself does so; and as a Dante gives his dream a local habitation in the terzina and through it lives the drama of his soul; even so religion habitually</page><page sequence="4">16 EDWIN W. SMITH expresses itself in symbolic form. The Christian creeds were in ancient times named Symbols. They brought together in summary form the various articles of the Faith; they served as badges and rallying-points of the Church; they also attempted to express in finite human terms the truths of religious experience which no human mind can fully apprehend and no human vocabulary can adequately expound. Religion in all its aspects-cognitive, affective, conative-has its foundation in some form of direct experience (Bartlett, 1950, p. 5). The experience comes by an intuitive leap of the mind, so vivid, so compelling, that he to whom it comes believes that it springs not from within but from without. To communicate such a cardinal experience (the adjective is H. G. Wells's) is never easy. The mystics of all ages-Christian and non-Christian-agree at this point. What they see with the inner eye they seek to convey by means of pictures drawn from the world of everyday life, and that, as Sir Frederick Bartlett says, is never very successful, " as everybody finds who tries to paint a poem or describe a' symphony" (1950, p. 13). Experience is always richer than thought and no dogma can fully express the secrets of the inner life. The figures and images-the symbols-with which the dogmatic theologian works are suggestive of truth but are not precise truth. Dogma should be taken for what it really is, not scientific formulation of spiritual reality but figurative and therefore approximate expression of a spiritual content whose value lies in being experienced (Galloway, 1914, pp. 167 sq.). He who experiences religion may use verbal symbols to communicate it to others and these symbols may sooner or later crystallize into a creed. He may express himself in action which becomes a ritual. He may embody his emotion in a material object which serves to focus and fix the attention. In any case his exposition is symbolic: it is an attempt to utter the unutterable. By sensory activity somewhat is represented which lies beyond sense. The symbol is not the reality, but it may be a clue to the apprehension of reality. To say that religion has its foundation in personal experience is not to say that every individual adherent of a religious system has undergone a definite religious experience. The symbol expressing the' experience may originate in the mind of an individual, but it becomes the possession of a group. Their acceptance of it may appear merely conventional, but its regular use leads them to grasp at second hand somewhat of the values of that experience through the emotive effect which the ritual or the myth or the creed or material symbol exerts upon them. Regular attendance at public worship does influence attitudes even when it does not lead to that complete transformation which we call conversion. Every ambulance man and nurse who wears a Red Cross does not enter into the' full experience which the Cross symbolises, yet the badge means something to them-means quite a lot; it represents an ideal of humanitarian service which influences conduct. I have known rough backwoods- men to whom the religion of the Cross meant apparently nothing, wbo yet would fasten two sticks together crosswise and plant them on the grave of a comrade. Some devout religious thinkers have reached the conclusion that it is impossible to describe ultimate Reality, the Absolute, in human terms. This attitude is characteristic of certain strains of Hindu philosophy. In the strict Vedanta teaching, Brahman, the One Reality, is impersonal, actionless, beyond thought or speech; no qualities could be ascribed to Brahman; neither sacrifices nor prayers could be offered to Brahman. Not worship but absorption into Reality was the disciple's aim. From the point of view of the common man this is metaphysics not religion, and does not meet his needs, To meet those needs it was conceded that Brahman might be worshipped in his avatars-his representations or incarnations. Even worship of the images of Vishnu was permitted, each of them instinct with his essence. The evidence of man's need of the concrete in religion is thrust every day upon the visitor to India. And even the mystics who dwelt in the most rarefied atmosphere of con- templation had their symbol-the ejaculated syllable OM ! This symbol was to them the means of know- ledge: "one knows through it all that has to be known" (Macnicol, Brihadaranyaka. Upanishad V.1, Everyman, p. 102). The conviction has seized many Christian and Muslim mystics that, since it is only the limited that can be presented in a figure, all symbols that the human mind can conceive must fail to portray the Infinite. Here we encounter what has been called " the antinomy of religious feeling" (Hoffding, 1906, p. 163). There is on one hand a disposition to rest in the assurance that one Power, beyond our apprehen- sion, changeless amid all change, controls the universe: " God is great and we know Him not ! " Yet even those to whom this sense of a remote Providence brings comfort may at times feel it is not enough; they want something nearer and more human than</page><page sequence="5">African Symbolism 17 the Absolute; they want to realize that in the midst of turmoil and struggle they have a fellow-struggler by their side, one who knows from his own experience what it is to suffer and meet resistance. They can never rest content until the infinite and exalted is presented in the form of the finite. Dante, that master of symbolism, at the end of his pilgrimage tried in vain to tell the Vision that came to him of the Supreme Good, the ineffable Glory of God. It came to him as Light. 0 luce eterna, che sola in te sidi, sola t'intendi, e, da te intelletta ed intendente te, ami ed arridi ! Within the profundity of that Light he saw a circle- mi parve pinta della nostra effige-the featured countenance of humanity. No more than a geometri- cian can square the circle could Dante express in finite terms his vision of the Godhead; but what he saw in the heart of it brought comfort to his exiled and harassed soul. It was the symbol of l'amor che move il sole e l'altre stelle (Paradiso, xxxiii, 124, 145). It is a far cry from Dante to the Africans; yet is it fanciful to hear in the African's ancestor cult an echo of the universal cry for a God near at hand? " We pata (' adore ') those whom we had seen with our eyes, their death and their life among us "-so Zulus said to Dr. Callaway. Gautama the Buddha rejected all metaphors as inadequate to express the Highest; and his followers of the Mahayana sect reacted by worshipping him as the god of gods. " Of all the great religious teachers of the world ", it has been said, " Christ is the most unashamedly anthropomorphic.... The whole basis of Christ's practical religous teaching is just one great anthropomorphic thought" (Streeter, p. 142). He spoke not without parable.- He conversed with Galilean peasants in the home-speech, drawing His symbols from kitchen and field, from domestic and social life. He spoke of God as Father; of men as potential sons of God and brothers. His followers have never been quite sure where in His teaching the figurative ends and the literal begins; and the uncertainty, a philosopher suggests, has given rise to most of the grave doubts and conflicts which have arisen in the Church (Hoffding, 1906, p. 309). Religion draws its symbols not only from human personality but also from the material world. In spite of all argument that nothing " exists" save what is perceived through the senses, it is convinced that beyond the world of sense-data there is another wQrld -a world of values. "The severe schools ", said Sir Thomas Browne (1642, p. 16), " shall never laugh me out of the Philosophy of Hermes, that this visible world is but a picture of the invisible, wherein, as in a Pourtraict, things are not truly, but in equivocal shapes, and as they counterfeit some more real substance-in that invisible fabrick ". My heart leaps up when 1 behold A rainbow in the sky. So may a physicist's heart leap, but as a scientist he is bound to describe the rainbow as a band of ethereal vibrations of various wave-lengths. It should make the same impression on his mind as a table of waVe- lengths. But I dare think it does not. Unless he is a Peter Bell he sees and admires the beauty of the bow's form and colour-things which his scientific conscience warns him are not in the waves. But he sees them: " no complete view (of the world) can be obtained so long as we separate our consciousness, from the world of which it is a part " (Eddington, 1929, p. 328 sqq.). The entities of physics (as I have already said) are of a symbolic nature; so, it may be said, are the entities of religion; but at least to some scientists the symbol is a partial aspect of an ulterior existence, and to the religious mind (as to the artist) the symbol points to the actual existence of something beyond itself-the symbol has its referent in reality, and is a means of apprehending that reality. So'when the- African observes the rainbow he calls it " the Bow- of God "; it is not God; it is a symbol, a manifestation of the Supreme Power. " For ", says St. Paul, " from the first making of the world, those things of God which the eye is unable to see, that is, His eternal power and existence, are fully made clear, He having given the knowledge of them through the things which are made. . . ." (Romans, i. 20, Basic). Baron von Hiigel reminds us that religion comes first to a child by way of the senses, through some external symbol, some picture-or statue. The appeal is directed through the senses to the imaginative faculty first. The external, sensible, readily picturable facts of religion correspond to and feed the child's imagination as readily as the mother's milk corresponds to and feeds its body. "Religion is here above all a Fact and Thing" (1923, i, 51). The youth and adult pass through other stages of religious development;- but they never outlive their need of symbols. We-are so constituted that our minds demand some graspahle (6736) IB</page><page sequence="6">18 EDWIN W. SMITH raft in this boundless ocean of mystery upon which we float. The most rigid Puritan who ever banned the wedding ring and Christmas plum-pudding did not rid himself entirely of symbolism: he exhibited in his dress what Dr. Nadel calls " diacritical symbols ". Adoration of the Almighty pours itself out in the symbolical language of poetry, as in the words of Scripture set to music by C. H. H. Parry: " Behold He is great and we know Him not; neither can the number of His years be searched out. The Lord's seat is in heaven. Clouds and darkness are round about Him. He decketh Himself with light as with a gaiment and spreadeth out the heavens like a curtain. He layeth the beams of His chambers in the waters and walketh upon the wings of the wind." So, from the simple ritual of the African barbarian to the gorgeous ceremonial of a Pontifical High Mass in St. Peter's, symbolism is the natural language of religion. But not of religion only. " Social life ", says Durkheim (pp. 230 sqq.), " in all its aspects and in every period of its history, is made possible only by a vast symbolism". The symbol not only serves as a rallying centre for any sort of group; it makes social unity obvious to the members; it clarifies the sentiment society has of itself; and it also creates that sentiment. Without symbols social sentiments could have only a precarious existence, for the symbol constantly brings the sentiments to mind and arouses them. They are not mere labels but an integral part of the collective life. " Symbolism ", says Raymond Firth, " serves as a vehicle for the expression of values which are significant for the social relations of the people" (1951, p. 177). " Without symbolism ", says Cassirer, "'the life of man would be like that of the prisoners in the cave of Plato's famous simile. Man's life would be confirned within the limits of his biological needs and his practical interests; it could find no access to the ' ideal world' which is opened to him from different sides by religion, art, philosophy, science". Instead of defining man as animal rationale Cassirer would define him as animal symbolicum (1945, pp. 26, 41). Thomas Carlyle in his rhetorical manner put it in this way: " Is not all that man does symbolical ?-a revelation to the sense of the mystic God-given force that is in him. Not a hut he builds but is the visible embodiment of a thought. It is in and through symbols that man consciously or unconsciously lives, works and has his being" (1894, p. 135 sq.). Symbology should lead us to a better understanding of the life of any people-particularly of their religion, always remembering Dr. Marett's dictum: " It is not the outward symbolism but the inward sense that can alone provide the basis of an intelligent judgement concerning the value of a religious act " (1927, p. 396). But the pathway of a symbologist is beset with many snares and pitfalls. He must beware of the slippery slope of etymology which leads to destruction. If you would know the fantasticaltiies into which it is possible to fall, you can hardly do better than read some chapters of Harold Bailey's The Lost Language of Symbolism. Therein you may learn that the Zulus are a branch of the Bantus, a name comparable to the British names of Bunty and Bundy; and that, moreover,, the word " Zulu " is probably cognate with " Zula ", a place- name in Cornwall.3 We have to bear in mind the admoni-tion of a distinguished psychologist: " There is no branch of psychological interpretation more liable to wild and generalised speculation than this branch of the inter- pretation of symbols . . . Any explanation which turns upon symbolic representation can be accepted as valid only in so far as it keeps clearly to the principle that a symbol must be interpreted strictly by reference to the mental life and personal history of the individual who uses the symbol, or to the characteristic responses of the group to whom the symbol may be said to belong" (Bartlett, 1923, pp. 247 sq.). There is no inherent connexion between verbal symbols and their referents. The meaning of words is given by what Malinow,ki called " the context of situation "4, and this is equally true of non-verbal symbols. The signification of a material object depends upon its context. An earthenware pot as it leaves the-hands of an African woman is definable in terms of the use to which it is put: it may be a " cooking-pot ", it may be a " water-pot ". Place a pot on the apex of a -hut, it is no longer a mere pot but a sign that the Mwila who resides beneath it has killed a man in battle or a ferocious wild beast. The pot in that position may also be interpreted as a 3 Bailey, 1951, i. 367. It is one of the axioms of philology, we are told, that vowel sounds are equal to one another; the ol of sol must therefore be equal to el, meaning God and power; and the French soleil may be equated with sole il or el, the sole and solitary God, the Monocle or Lone Great Eye, i. 290. 4 Malinowski, 1930, p. 307. "Exactly as in the reality of spoken or written languages, a word without linguistic context is a mere figment and stands for nothing by itself, so in the reality of a spoken living tongue, the utterance has no meaning except in the context of situation."</page><page sequence="7">African Symbolism 19 symbol in that it points to a courage that is outside the range of ordinary men. It is the Ila equivalent of the Victoria or George Cross. If the pot is cracked, it means to the Kavirondo Bantu that the owner is afflicted with luswa, is ceremonially unclean. By a natural association of ideas, a pot may represent a young woman, for (a) both. are of domestic use, and (b) both are potential containers. If a man comes to you and says: " I am come to talk about a pot ", you know that he has his eye on your daughter as a wife for his nephew. Breaking a pot may be an incident in funeral rites, probably the symbol of death. To Rattray's Nankanse a pot might become a bagere, the shrine of an ancestor, and may even be identified with the ancestor. Among the same people " setting a pot" is an important hunting-rite apparently for the purpose of fending off, or conciliating, the spirits of the animals that have been killed (Rattray, 1932, i, 215, 171 sq.). The significance of an object depends then upon its context of situation. Interpretation of social data is never easy --the hazards are so many. On the one hand there is the subtle danger of seeing symbolism where there is none, A person of imaginative teirrperament is tempted to read it into everything. On the other hand, a matter- of-fact person is liable to interpret literally what is metaphorical. Symbolism largely employs analogy and two observers may seize upon different elements of the analogy and thereby reach disparate inter- pretations of the same symbol. Among the BaIla, bride and bridegroom sit side by side, they hand each other a morsel of food and eat together, as part of the marriage ceremony. I interpret this act on the principle that eating together indicates comradeship on terms of equality and conclude that here is an affirmation that ideally at least marriage is the union of two equals in a bond of mutual service. Dr. Gluckman notices that the Lozi bride and bridegroom eat the porridge off a stone and sees therein a symbol of, a hope that the marriage may endure as a stone endures (Colson &amp; Gluckman, 1949, p. 80). Malinow- ski interprets the funeral rites of savage societies as expressing the dogma of continuity after death: " The whole conduct of the group ", he affirms, " expresses the hope of salvation and immortality " (1925, p. 58). Raymond Firth, on the contrary, sees in the ritual a symbol of finality. In essence, the community says to the relatives: " Your boy is dead; he is now buried. Wail for him in one final outburst, before us all. We expect it of you, and we demand it of you. Then to-morrow you will return to a normal social existence" (1951, p. 63). Another potential source of misinterpretation lies in the fluidity of symbolism. Ideas move more rapidly than their expression in word and deed. Owing to man's innate conservatism, his psychic inertia the ritual may perdure when the dogma is obsolete. Our language reflects many outworn beliefs. We still talk of " influence" but it is without reference to the flowing of an ethereal fluid from the stars. The modern mind is baffled by the vivid symbolism of medieval mystics who expressed themselves in terms of a conception of the material universe that is now out of date. We still keep to some ancient spatial images, as when we speak of" ascending into heaven " or " descending into hell", while giving them a different symbolic meaning. As scientists discard outworn hypotheses, so advance in civilization involves casting off what Carlyle calfed " the tatters and rags of superannuated worn-out symbols ". We do not abolish hypotheses and symbols but we substitute new ones to keep step with fresh enlightenment. We place flowers on graves instead of the victuals which, no doubt, our ancestors, like Africans, placed there. What was a live symbol, pregnant with significance, may become dead, like the monoliths of Stonehenge or the figures in Egyptian tombs. Or we may keep the old symbols and give them a new meaning. To the Roman citizen the Cross was a symbol of the utmost degradation, an obscene object never to be mentioned in polite society; to the Christian it is a living symbol, pointing to something that is unutterable-the love of God which passes all knowledge. So a symbol-.may have more than one meaning: one for you, and -one for me. In the thought of the early Christians,.the figure of a fish was a symbol of Christ. To the modern psycho-analyst a fish is a dream symbql of repressed sexuality. That, I suppose, is what Dr. Bartlett meant when he said that " the success of the attempt to treat the significance of symbols as matter for scientific investigation depends to a large degree upon the study of individual and group differences Of the origin of symbols we can assert nothing. They may have sprung from the individual mind, conscious or unconscious, or from a collective unconscious. Individuals have symbolisms that are proper to themselves. But in general, symbols, whether verbal or non-verbal, pertain to groups. This is not to say that every member of a group is aware of the meaning of the symbol. The observer may ask for an explanation and be blandly told: " It is our custom ", or " We do as our fathers did "; or he may be given an interpretation introduced by such a formula as Nkukuti, " it is to say ", i.e., " that is what it means ". (6736) B 2</page><page sequence="8">20 EDWIN W. SMITH That may or may not be the conumunally accepted meaning, but only an individual -opinion. It is never safe to accept without ample confirmation what one man says of the ritual in which he participates. Furthermore, let us note that frequently what appears to be symbolic, and is so interpreted by one individual, may to other people be something more than an index pointing to an object other than itself. As we have already seen, symbols carry strong emotional charges: they have evocative, incitive, stimulative power. Durkheim (p. 230 sq.) lays stress upon this dynamical aspect of symbolism. When the participant in a ritual experiences an exaltation of spirit, an increase of psychic energy, an enhanced confidence or sense of security, these effects may appear to emanate from the rite itself or from the material object which is the focus of the ritual. It is not difficult to enter into his feeling. Anyone who has lived long in a foreign land knows well the exaltation produced by the first sight of the Union Jack when he lands on these shores. Not under- standing the psychological processes involved he may easily assign the effects to the symbol itself as their efficient cause. We1shall see before we have finished that Africans believe that in material objects, in words spoken, in actions performed, there resides some mystical energy that is efficacious in the production of certain definite results. That is to say, what appears to be a symbol is in reality a talisman, a vehicle of mystical energy. The distinction is subtle, tenuous, but real. T,he confusion of symbol with talisman is not unknown in Christendom; which is why, I suppose, Evelyn Underhill (1923, p. 189) says that " religion on its ceremonial side is always largely magical". So it may appear. In the Christian sacraments, as in talismans, attention is focussed on material objects; and psychological processes operate in the use of both. To many Christians, the water of baptism, the bread and wine of Holy Communion, are purely symbolical - a visible form of an invisible grace ", as Augustine said. Others believe that just as a poet conveys his meaning through his words and the sound of his words-i.e., through a movement of inorganic particles-so God communicates Himself to the soul of the worthy recipient through these material objects- His 2" visible word" (to quote Augustine again). Archbishop Temple (1935, p. 492) sees in the sacra- ments a clue to the understanding of the relation of spirit to matter in the universe. Sacrament is not magic: but according to this view, sacrament is endowed with the virtue and potency which magic claims falsely to offer. I have no doubt that many people, whose minds are still dominated by what Italians call la religione vecchia, take the same view of the sacraments as the Africans take of their talismans-things which in themselves have causal efficacy. Talismans might be taken as in some sense proleptical of the sacraments. One more remark before I leave these generalities. I borrow the words of one who is a psycho-analyst as well as an anthropologist. "Now both the Old Testament and anthropology show that man's early development was far from being regulated by dogma, but proceeded by a system of trial and error, always guided in the long run towards higher things, but groping its way by means of symbolic beliefs of all kinds and by ritual practices expressing and gradually crystallizing these beliefs. Nor can anyone who has lived with primitive peoples, as the writer has, have any doubt as to the vivid nature of these beliefs and practices or of their immense value as indispensable vehicles of the nascent com- prehension by mankind of the truths later expressed by dogma" (Layard, p. 92). 3. Let us then turn to the Africans. They are fond of playing with words. They have a remarkable gift of drawing analogies. They are adepts in the use of metaphor. They habitually think and speak in pictures. " The discovery of likeness inrthe midst of differences and of difference in the midst of likeness is the keenest pleasure of the intellect" (Raleigh, 1918, p. 61). The young African finds that pleasure in composing and asking riddles5. "Kako ", says an Ila urchin, " Here's one for you!" and he expects the conven- tional reply: " Kakeza ", "let it come ! " " A house without a door ", says he, and presently after some cogitation the correct answer is given: " An egg ! " " A pool in the midst of reeds " says another; and the reply comes: " The eye! " " My hen has laid among thorns" is a Swahili riddle; the answer to which is "a pineapple". This youthful propensity for tracing similarities continues throughout life. The proverbs, maxims, wise-saws, which are an open 5 Riddles sometimes play an important part in the instruction given in initiation schools; see Lyndon Harries, " Makua song-riddles from the initiation rites ", African Studies, 1, No. 1, pp. 27 sqq.</page><page sequence="9">African Symbolism 21 door into the African mind, point to an ability for conveying abstract ideas effectively and picturesquely by means of concrete facts. "The potter's wife eats from a potsherd " (Ganda). "No elephant feels the burden of its trunk" (Xhosa and Ila). " Baboons laugh at each other's eye-sockets "; " a red fig does not lack worms inside" (Thonga); It is noteworthy that in such sayings metaphor is more common than simile. The African does not say: " wealth is like dew "; he says: " wealth is dew"; " death is sleep "; " the heart of man is a bee"; "anger is stubble". This characteristic is apparent not only in proverbs, which are more or less stereotypes, but also in aphorisms thrown off in every-day speech, as when an old chief turned to me after I had sat with him all one long laborious day in his court and said :" Bwami ntbuzhike, chieftainship is slavery ". So Cullen Young's Tumbuka say: " Umfumu nkuwoko, chief- tainship is a hand"-the (open) hland symbolizing generosity (1931, p. 268). It has been said that one should handle the little word " is " as carefully as a stick of dynamite (Chase, 1938, p. 57) and the warning is equally applicable to the copula in Bantu languages. Old Shaloba was not identifying chieftainship with slavery; he was saying that in certain respects his position as chief was similar to the position of a slave: he was asserting not identification -but similitude. The confusion of these two concepts is a frequent source of misinterpretation. The metaphorical language offers many a semantic problem to the anthropologist. He must continually ask: What is the referent of this verbal symbol? I would illustrate this necessity by reference to Dr. Evans-Pritchard's study of Nuer prayers. These are spontaneous meaningful utterances addressed to God which do not require any special method of inter- pretation but only adequate translation. Literally rendered one prayer reads: " Let the breath of the people be very cold". But the primary meaning of the words vic and koc (" breath " and-"cold ") is not the right meaning in this context; the man is asking God that in their inner selves the people may be free from anxiety. Another prayerruns: " May we tread on wild rice". The reference here is to a tender pasture grass on which small calves feed and which is soft to the feet of man. What is asked of God is a path through life free from harm, a mind at ease. As is the case with many other Africans, the analogy is drawn between sleep and peace. (Fifty years ago, the most frequent greeting I received when travelling in Central Africa was: "-Natuone, Let us sleep ! " a reflection of the insecurity in which the people were living). The commonest of phrases in Nuer prayers and greetings is " Akonienko, let us sleep ! ", i.e., " Let us be at peace, not only in relation to other men, but with ourselves ". When greeting his fellows a Nuer will say: " ci tol ? have you smoke? " Smoke rising from the hearth is, like sleep, a symbol of contentment, tranquility, deliverance from evil. The Nuer regard the misfortunes from which they wish to be delivered as due to " faults " (dueri) and hold therefore that they can be avoided by the man who possesses cuong, that is to say, the man who is right in his dealings with God and man. " These two ideas of being in the right and of deliverance from evil are ", concludes Dr. Evans-Pritchard, " basic to their religious thought and complementary " (1952). This should give pause to those who imagine that Africans in their prayers seek only for material blessings. In the symbolism of the Africans there is much that emphasizes their conviction that desirable ends of a material nature are also, and intrinsically, ends of a spiritual or mystical nature. Their ideal of a good life includes tangible values-abundant crops, plenty of children, health; and the health is moral as well as physical. The ritual practices seem to symbolize this close connexion, amounting to identity, between what is palpable and what is spiritual. When BaSotho cry aloud " Pula ! " (" rain ") they are not only asking that rain may fall: it is an aspiration for peace, for domestic and national well-being in all respects. African idiom abounds in euiphemism. They do not like to say straight out that a person is dead. " He has changed his abode ", the BaSotho say, or "He has returned home " (Casalis, 1861, p. 318). The Zulus (Krige, 1937, p. 171) never announced that their chief was dead: " Uyadunguzela ", they would declare, " He is brooding" (or hibernating). Africans, as a rule, are decorous in social intercourse and, especially in mixed company, seek to avoid offensive expressions. They shrink from calling a spade a spade, or even an agricultural implement. They exercise a penchant for allusive locution. This applies, not only as among ourselves when speaking of natural functions of the body but also on other occasions when delicacy calls for roundabout speech. When a Tallensi becomes a father he announces the fact to his parents-in-law in this form:" Your daughter has borne a calabash "-if it is a girl; " a staff if it is a boy (Fortes, 1945, p. 61). Indeed in African symbolism, a pot or a calabash or water stands for femininity; a spear or rod for masculinity. In (6736) B 3</page><page sequence="10">22 EDWIN W. SMITH Bastutoland the- birth of a son is announced by beating the father with a stick; the birth of a daughter by drenching him with water (Ashton, 1951, p. 29). These are symbols which psycho-analysts will recog- nize. The same kind of circumlocution occurs in proposals of marriage. In Kavirondo a man proposes to a divorcee in such terms as these: " You are living here by yourself, but we need women to build the fire for us ". If she is well-disposed she may reply: " Look at your fingers "-in other words, " count your cattle ". He follows by saying: "If a man tightens the strings of his lyre he knowg what he is going to play" (Wagner, 1950, p. 439). Usually the proposal to- a maiden is made through a mediator. He opens the matter by saying to her parents: " I have come to talk about the handle of a hoe ". All the subsequent conversation is in terms of that implement; and finally if favourably impressed the parents will admit: " Yes, perhaps the handle of a hoe may be here ", and the mediator returns to report that the omens are favourable.6 Similar periphasis is used often by the diviner when consulted by a client. " Go and burn black ants ", he may say, meaning " Go and dig up so-and-so's bones and burn them" (Wagner, 1950, p. 289). The Sotho diviner's recitations to his huckle-bones (lithoko tsa maoa) are as enigmatic as the ancient Delphic oracle and open to as many various interpretations; e.g., " White ox, I die, I die for the land " (Ashton, 1951, p. 297). As in Hebrew and Greek, so in Bantu, intellectual ideas are expressed largely by roots of concrete significance and the passions by words indicating primarily the organs of the body. When a concrete object has the same name as an abstract idea, the object may be regarded as a symbol of the idea. It is always fascinating to trace these extensions of meaning. The idea of reincarnation which is wide- spread in Africa is expressed in the Ga language by the word gblamo, the name of a- vine which twines round and round a post (Field, 1937, p. 197). Similarly in Ila, the symbol of the lineage is lunungu, the long succulent branching stem of the pumpkin and melon. In Sotho letlokoa, " a straw" connotes "6 vanity ", and " a yellow heart " (pelo e tsetla) is " jealousy ". Perseverance and firmness in danger are expressed in terms of the liver. " I am eaten by my s Other examples are given by Rattray, 1932, pp. 140 sqq. letsoalo ('midriff') " is the Sotho way of saying: "I am stung by remorse". Dr. Field is probably right in tracing to this region of metaphor the birthplace of many imaginary beings that dance their way through African phantasy.7 Some mysterious operations of Nature become objectified, or even personified, even as haunting fears are figured by some of ourselves as Gremlins and as psychologists personify as the Censor the discriminatory, inhibitory processes of the unconscious. An example of this reification, or personification, is offered by Chibumba, the female creature which the BaIla believe to be the generative agent in the womb, forming the foetus and causing the pangs of childbirth by its violent efforts to retain its product. Chibumba might be taken as a symbol of the Life-force in one of its aspects.8 Many Africans draw a distinction between the right and left sides of the body: the right is a symbol and seat of strength and virility, the left of weakness and femininity. A candidate for chieftainship may be rejected on the ground that he is left-handed. BaSotho say that if a woman lies on her right side during and immediately after the sexual act she should produce male children; if on the left, then females (Ashton, 1951, p. 27). An inferior person should not stand on the right of a superior for it would take away the superior's strength. For the same reason you do not pass on a person's right hand. African mothers are keen observers of their daughters' suitors and of the girls whom their sons want as wives. If a Mandingo young man puts his left foot foremost in crossing an obstacle, a mother may say to her daughter: " Marry that man. He will always be a feeble character: his wife will lead him by the nose" (Africa, XVI, p. 52). Are we already reaching the limit of symbolism and entering the region of what is called " magic " ? It looks like it if a man can draw strength from another I Field, 1937, p. 125. " Dramatic metaphor comes very easily to an African. It is probably in this region of struggle for expression, where he fails to convey by metaphor what he is not himself deceived about, that we must look for the birthplace of many invisible things. One has only to think of such modern jargon as 'the censor of consciousness,' 'the sub-conscious region' to realise how difficult it is to escape metaphor the figures of which could easily begin to masquerade as something real." 8 Smith &amp; Dale, 1920, 1., 226 sq. The word Chibumba belongs to the personal class of nouns; it is to be referred to as " she " not " it ". It means " the moulder "; cf. the Ila praise-name of Leza, the Supreme Being, Lubumba (also personal) formed from the same root, viz., bumba, " mould, shape ".</page><page sequence="11">African Symbolism 23 by standing on his right side. A European is baffled in his search for interpretations. When Africans speak as they do of heart and liver and other organs, are they employing figurative language? Or do they mean that by turning yellow a man's heart exudes jealousy? Does the hardening of his liver induce patience? Have we here an intuition of the modern discovery that endocrine secretions, such as thyrosin, become a factor of temperament by sensitizing certain propensities ? Or is it that patience hardens the liver and jealousy yellows the heart? Or again, is there a mystical indentification of the physical organs and the affects? Or can we not be content to say that heart and liver are symbols? I cannot dwell at length on the fascinating subject of names, which also like the heart and other organs, are to be regarded as elements of the complex personality. Names are symbolical in so far as they are not mere labels but point to the owner's status or characteristics. The real or sacred name has religious significance when it is the name of the ancestor who is the living person's guardian or tutelary spirit; among the BaIla it is the name of the ancestor who is actually reincarnated in him: since he has returned to earth he naturally resumes his old name and status. The name given at initiation is symbolical of his new position in the tribe: he is a-new man, therefore has a new name. That names point to qualities is seen most clearly in the praise-titles: the -izibongo of the Zulus, the lithoko of the BaSotho. These are made up of single words or short phrases, or they may be expanded into poems in which the singer (umbongi) stretches his fancy in search of metaphors ta describe the greatness of his chief. Thus of Dingane, Chief of the Zulus: Bird of the morning ! Thou art the purple dawn, Thou art-beautiful as an isle in the Umsinyati, Thou art the great shade of the Zulus. Ravager of provinces, Deep abyss which engulfest all! (Shooter, 1857, p. 312). It used to be the custom for warriors to extol their own prowess, as did a MoSotho named Cucutle: I am Cucutle I am the black warrior, I am the white thunder Which growls after rain (Casalis, 1861, p, 333). Note here the metaphorical usage on which I com- mented before. Cucutle does not say: " I am likethe white thunder ": he says: " I am the white thunder ". It is by a study of such praise-titles given to the Supreme Power in the universe that we can learn much of the African's theology. They know that (as the Ngombe say9) the Power is Endandala, " the Unex- plainable ", but when they speak of the Power as " the Moulder ", " the Constructor ", " the Giver ", " the Kindly-disposed ", "the Great Mother " "the Greatest of Friends ", all such epithets are symbolical: attempts to conceptualize in familiar human terms what is incomprehensible. Some God-names sound strangely to Europeans who do not appreciate the African poet's liking for metonymy and synecdoche. For instance, the cattle-loving Nuer salute as Tutgar the most majestic long-horned beast of the herd; and this epithet (meaning literally " omnipresent strength ") is also given to Kwoth, the Supreme Being (Evans- Pritchard, 1951). The God-names which refer to celestial phenomena-sun, thunder, lightning, rain -are no more to be taken literally than the poetic description of the rainbow as " God's necklace ". I cannot but think that Dr. Meek is mistaken when, writing of certain Nigerian tribes, he says that Hyel, the Supreme Being, " is the firmament, the sun, the moon, the stars" (1931, i, 221). Some Balla would say during a rain-storm " God (Leza) is falling ", but I never met a man of that tribe who would say that God and rain were identical. These celestial pheno- mena are symbols and undoubtedly in the minds of many Africans (as Dr. Evans-Pritchard says of the Nuer) more than symbols: they are modes and manifestations of Deity. Africans have a profound sense that the Supreme Being, who is not localized, for whom no sanctuaries are built, for whom no cult is organized and of whom no images are shaped, is involved in these phenomena and in human life. Descending from these high levels, we may glance at the symbolical value of colours and numbers. A Zulu girl indites her love-letters in the form of beadwork, the patterns and colours of whlch express her sentiments. White beads symbolize love; black, disappointment, hope deferred; green, sickly feelings; pink, poverty; red, yearning; blue, happiness; yellow, wealth in cattle. A single string of white and pink beads reads: " My heart is full of love, but you have no cattle to marry me with'" (Krige, 1936, p. 132). It is curious that among dark-skinned folk black stands 9 J. Davidson in African Ideas of God, 1950, p. 167. See the index of God-names in this book. (6736) B 4</page><page sequence="12">24 EDWIN W. SMITH universally for impurity, misfortune, wretchedness, while white stands for purity, prosperity, happiness. Among the Mashona a bride-groom is given a pure- white egg to indicate that the bride is virgo intacta (Bullock, 1950, p. 62). The priests of Ga temples always wear white robes; and among the same people the victor in litigation is smeared with white clay as a symbol of his innocence and of congratulation (Field, 1937, p. 7, 163). Where haruspication is practised, a whitish spleen indicates that the patient will recover, a red spleen indicates persistent danger, and a black spleen indicates death. Some Kavirondo Bantu distinguish two Gods: Wale omuwanga, the White God, is benevolent; Wele gumali, the Black God, is malevolent (Wagner, 1950, p. 175). Ukuba nesinyama, " to have blackness ", is the Zulu equivalent of " to be impure'"; the term would be applied to menstru- ating and pregnant women, to attendants at a funeral, and especially to those who have handled the corpse. The process of purification includes taking certain "white " medicines (Krige, 1936, p. 82). Some occasions demand the sacrifice of pure white goats, sheep and foWls; but more often it is a pure black beast, without a single white hair, that is called for. For instance, among the exogamous Mashona, if two people marry who are of the same clan though distantly related, the fault may be adjusted by offering a black bull to propitiate the ancestors (Bullock, 1950, p. 87). In such cases, I suppose, the blackness of the animal symbolizes the sin which has to be expiated. When, as is common, a black beast is slaughtered during the " rain-making " ceremonies, the blackness typifies the desired black rain-bearing clouds. It is not purely symbolical: it is intended to produce an effect; the symbol passes into a talisman. The attitude towards numbers is often ambivalent. The Vugusu regard seven as many enlightened Euro- peans regard thirteen. Among them a father will never admit having seven children; a raiding party will never bring home seven cattle; if they count people, instead of saying " varano na vavili, seven persons " they say " varano na musafu muvi, bad luck persons " (Wagner, 1950, p. 210). Zulus would regard it as a reflection on the girl's chastity and a deadly insult if parents of a suitor offered seven cattle as bride- wealth; only for a divorced woman would that number be acceptable (Krige, 1936, p. 132). The meaning of many of their symbols has been forgotten by the Akan but, says Mrs. Meyerowitz, the symbolism of numbers is intact. Among them the number seven is not bodeful but sacrosanct: it stands for the State which is made up of seven clans representing seven planets, the deity of each one of which rules a day in the seven-day week. An axe with three points is the Akan Omanhene's- most ancient emblem; he is proclaimed king by being lightly seated on his stool three times. The act symbolizes his connexion with Nyame, the Creator and ruler of the universe which consists of sky, earth and the underworld. So, according to Mrs. Meyerowitz, each of the cardinal numbers carries a mystic significance.10 Just as the seal of a medieval emancipated English borough was the symbol of its corporate union and in Britain to-day the crown is a symbol of kingship, the Great Seal a symbol of legislative power, the Lord Chancellor's Purse a symbol of the nation's wealth, even so in Africa there are objects and actions which convey a meaning that is not inherent in themselves. Here we may note the distinction that is drawn (as by Dr. Nadel, 1951, pp. 262 sqq.; Morris, 1946, pp. 190 sqq.) between natural and artificial symbols. In the former the correspondence between the symbol and the thing it stands for is at once apparent. Iconic symbols, such as portraits and models, exhibit perceptible similarity in various degrees. Certain objects have a physiognomic character residing in their " look" and expressing emotional states. The Zulu girl's love-letters are an example. Artificial or extrinsic symbols, on the other hand, are constructed and invested with meaning by some arbitrary and merely conventional rule. Diacritical symbols, natural or artificial, indicate that a certain behaviour may be expected both of the persons displaying them and of those to whom they are displayed. In their inter- pretation the fallacy must be avoided of thinking of them in mechanistic terms as external stimuli producing automatic responses. Social nomenclature, such as the classificatory kinship terms, falls into this category. So also do objects which define and express social relations, status and rank. Mrs. Meyerowitz illustrates an applique cloth of one of the Akan chiefs which is divided into 25 fields each containing some symbol of royalty. The Akan Queen-Mother also has her insignia. She is regarded as a daughter of the moon and her people desire her to be as calm and peaceful as her " mother ", her body as delicate and beautiful. Silver, representing moon- :10 Meyerowitz, 1951, pp. 94 sqq. Rattray collected gold weights and wrote (Ashanti, p. 302) of those in which the designs appear geometrical and were perhaps once symbolical: " I have not yet met a single Ashanti who can give any inter- pretation or assign any meaning to their symbols ".</page><page sequence="13">African Symbolism 25 light, is her metal; she wears silver jewellery and silver ornaments adorn her ceremonial robes. The king, as divine, has mystical connexion with the sun, and gold, the colour of the sun, is his metal. His was the Golden Stool as the Silver Stool was that of the Queen- Mother. It is not only among the Akan that diacritical symbols are found: they are the vogue all over Africa, even in tribes that have not the highly developed hierarchy and artistic skill that characterize some of the Sudanic Negroes. Even among the BaIla the communal heads-were distinguished by leopard skins, ivory bracelets and the impande- shell. Nyakyusa headmen are each given a horn, a tail and a spear as einblems of their office. The spear is the symbol of the headman's manhood and strength. The other objects-as is so frequently the case with regalia-are more than symbofs: they embody amanga, " mystical power ". The amanga of the horn will enhance his prestige by increasing the number of his adherents; the amanga of the tail will enable him to dream of threatening dangers (Wilson, 1951, pp. 25, 95 n.).11 The sceptre of the Sotho chief handed down from Moshesh to his successors, is a club fashioned from a rhinoceros horn. It also has occult properties symbolized by the enormous strength of the rhinoceros. So long as the chief held it in his hand he was invincible on the field of battle (Laydevant, Africa, XVIII, pp. 41 sqq.). Fire is a not uncommon symbol of perennity or continuity. In Ruanda, the fire which was lighted for 11 The word amanga, which Mrs. Wilson translates " mystical powers ", is a plural abstract form of'bwanga derived from the same root as nganga, " doctor, medicine-man ". In various forms it occurs in Bantu languages from Southern Rhodesia to Lake Victoria, from the Atlantic to the great lakes. Dr. Malcolm Guthrie has given me the names of 20 languages in which it is, found. In Ila bwanga denotes the essential active principle in " medicines ". It has the same meaning in Lamba (Doke, The Lambas of Northern Rhodesia, 1931, pp. 290 sqq., " the power for healing or for destroying, for protecting or for hurting ") and in Bemba (R. J. B. Moore in Africa, xiii, pp. 211 sqq.). It appears to be much the same among the Kaonde (F. H. Melland, In Witch-bound Africa, 1923, pp. 231 sqq.). It is believed that bwanga imay be strengthened by the infusion of divine power. A Luba doctor (mpaka-manga, " manipulator of bwanga ") prays thus to God while preparing his medicine: " ubwele mu bwanga bwetu, come thyself into our bwanga " (Van Caeneghem, " Gebeden der Baluba " in Aequatoria, no. 1, 1947). But the occult power is not confined to medicines; it is inherent in the secret rites of the Luba Budye society (Roy &amp; Henroteaux in Bulletin des Jurisdictions, no. 4, 1945). Dr. Hastings in his (unpublished) work on the Ovi- mbundu defines wanga as " psychic power " and treats it as the equivalent of mana. Baumann (Lunda, 1935) brings out the paramount importance of wanga which he interprets as the founder of the dynasty was sedulously maintained for his successors all through the, centuries (Kagame, Africa, XVII, pp. 41 sqq.). Among the Shilluk the death of a Reth (king) temporarily breaks the link between the people and Nyikang, the founder of the royal house, and this break is marked by extinguishing all fires; the lighting of new fires symbolizes the restoration of the continuity (Howel &amp; Thomson, 1946). The Nyakyusa have a similar custom. "The fire is the fire of lordship (umoto botwa) " they say. " The old chieftainship is coming to an end, the new has come" (Wilson, 1951, pp. 26 sq.). Animals, as might be expected, enter largely into African symbolism. In the folk-tales the characteris- tics of beasts are not only set forth for entertainment; they are held up for emulation and detestation. The hare, for example, stands as a symbol of what BaIla call mano, the quality of cunning which wins its way against superior physical strength. Evil qualities are associated with repulsive appearance: the hyena is the epitome of gluttony. Many tribes regard the chameleon as a symbol of death; the snake as a symbol of life (Abrahamson, 1951, pp. 17, etc.). The regalia of Akan chiefs, their robes, their ornaments, their umbrellas, the official staffs and raiment of their retinue, all have a meaning, or may be supposed to have had a meaning at some time: Thus the lion, cast in gold, which figures on the royal umbrella and on the staff of the okyeame (spokesman), is an obvious emblem of power. The leopard is fierce and the king's stool is placed on a leopard skin to zauberkraft. C. M. White (Africa, xviii, p. 84) also reports that among the Lunda, Chokwe and Luchazi wanga is " essen- tially the unseen power behind the concept of sorcery . . . the magical element of potency located in some material, the otherwise inexplicable"; it is not used for healing. Writing of the Kwanyama, P. C. Estermann (Africa, vii, p. 440n.) described ouanga as " un pouvoir secret et imaginaire " attributed to witches. Tribes of the Gabun are said to speak of end.ianga as " witch-power " (Abbe Walker quoted by Webster, 1948, p.411). Other observers report that the word is applied to specific medicaments. The Sukuma give the name Iwanga to a mixture of flour and water used in purification rites. (H. Cory, The Ntemi, 1951, p. 6). The ovwanga of the Kavirondo Bantu is a paste of eleusine flour and water that is " blown" upon warriors to give them ovukali (fierceness, courage) and is used also in the rite which places an infant under the protection of its ancestors (Wagner, 1950, p. 328). The Negroes of Haiti have preserved the word wanga for the active principle of medicine; wangataire, in the Marcellins' novel The Pencil of Cod (1951) is " a sorceress who makes charms ". Dr. Lorenzo Turner has found the word banga among the so-called Gullahs of South Carolina and the Sea Islands; he renders it " witchcraft ". The Sotho equivalent is bongaka, as in sehlare se na le bongaka, " the medicine has (contains) bwanga ".</page><page sequence="14">26 EDWIN W. SMITH symbolize his daring and fierce character. Moreover, on the principle of pars pro toto, some of the leopard's fierceness is conveyed to the king through this contact with the skin. The Queen Mother's stool rests appropriately on a sheepskin. The elephant, an embodiment of transcendent strength, suggests to the Akan more than the river Tano which it represents: they say: " The great spirit (sunsum) that is everywhere it is he we call elephant ". This may remind us that Christian Yoruba speak of Christ as Erintunde, " the Elephant returned ", for just as every human spirit returns to be reborn so the mighty power of God, manifested in Christ, has come to be possessed by men. An interesting example of the new extension of old symbols (Parrinder, 1952). Among the Akan each animal totem is thought to represent the qualities and embody the ideals which members of the clan must live up- to. Thus, the parrot, the totem of the Anana clani, symbolizes eloquence and - persuasiveness; the crow of the Asona clan, wisdom; and the buffalo of the Konna clan (for some recondite reason) stands for conscientiousness (Meyerowitz, 1951, pp 29 sqq.). It cannot be said that this form of symbolism is common-it would seem to be a rationalization to explain why animals are chosen as totems. The BaKwena of South Africa do not hold up the crocodile as an exemplar. Diacritical symbols are by no means confined to the aristocracy. As among the Kavirondo Bantu, the garments worn by girls and women often indicate their status; the length of the tassels hanging from the belt of a female depends upon whether she is unmarried or has borne children or has passed the menopause (Wagner, 1950, p. 307). When she is about to be married a Zulu woman begins to build her chignon (isicholo) which is the symbol of full female maturity. The much treasured head-ring (ikehla) was sewn on the heads of Zulu warriors who had completed their active service and were allowed to marry: to tear it from a man's head or even to touch it was an insult of the gravest description (Krige, 1936, pp. 370 sq.). The rod (ekisuli) placed by Kavirondo Bantu on the apex of a hut is a symbol of manhood, particularly of a man's procreative power. It indicates that the roof of a hut is a man's prerogative; if a woman climbed up there it would be taken as a sign that she wished for a divorce (Wagner, 1950, p. 385). Among Tallensi, the stirring-stick used in making porridge is the symbol of womanhood, as is a bow of manhood: for man and wife to fight each other with these weapons is a heinous sin-an unnatural warfare of the sexes. Pictures, we are often told, are the books of the illiterate; and many of the objects we call symbols are pictographs with a didactic, or at least suggestive, intent. Some of the goldweights of Ashanti are called " Proverb weights " because they iconize, and so call to mind, valuable truths of experience. Thus a weight showing two human figures carries the meaning: " I who am lying on my back cannot see the Sky God (Nyame), how do you expect to, who are lying on your belly?" (Rattray, 1923, p. 312).12 For another iconic symbolism we may take a glance into the hut which is the centre of-the ceremonial of the Buyeye society in Sukumaland. The hut itself is a symbol of the earth and upon its walls and roof the sun, moon and stars are depicted. Time is represented by a grinding-stone and copper bangles, the maternal ancestors by a pot-ladle. Pegs driven into the ground stand for knowledge, a pad of twisted grass for the strength and unity of the society, an earthenware pot for its prosperity. A small circular termite hill outside the hut symbolizes the communal spirit of the society (Cory, 1946, pp. 160 sqq.). This is the milieu for the initiation into this fraternity of snake-charmers. I am not competent to enter into a technical discussion of African art in general. My chief concern here is in regard to its symbolical elements. I agree with Dr. Raymond Firth who, in his excellent treat- ment of the subject (1951, pp. 155 sqq.) says: " By no means all primitive art is symbolic. Much of it is simply descriptive. . . . Many motifs employed by the primitive artist are simple line arrangements of a ' geometrical' order, with no allusive significance. Or they are conventionalized representations of natural or cultural objects, the reference being a direct one to them without any further significance." I have no doubt that a- large proportion of the carvings and mouldings and paintings and textile designs which attract us by their beauty are expressions of the artists' joy in creation and no more. Yet symbolism is there; and perhaps it is only our ignorance of what the artist is trying to express that blinds us to the meaning of his creations. Many of the statuettes, with disproportioned and distorted limbs and other exaggerated features, are portraits of ancestors, like the famous figure of Shamba Bolongongo brought home from the Congo by Emile 12 In the initiation schools of some East African tribes, instruction is largely given through songs and the lesson of each song is symbolized by a figurine of clay or wood (H. Cory in Africa, XIV, pp. 459 sqq.).</page><page sequence="15">African Symbolism 27 Torday (1925, pp. 148 sqq.). This might be taken as a symbol of eternal serenity. Other statuettes are so-called "fetishes ", supposed to be temporary dwellings of ancestral spirits. Their function is to focus the attention of worshippers. They are shrines. Other works of art have a " magical " significance. For example, the Dogon of French West Africa believe that since a man,killed in battle or hunting is not able to undergo rites of purification, the nyama (force vitale) of the men or animals he has killed will attach itself to his soul (kikinu say) and give him no rest, and also be harmful to the living members of the community. To obviate this calamity they paint on a rock figures representing him and the arrow with which he was killed, and then bring his shaven locks into contact with the pictures. By this means the nyama is con- veyed to, and fixed in, the designs, so that it is no longer a danger to dead and living (Dieterlen, 1941, p. 189).13 African artists might say with Picasso (wlio drew inspiration from the Congo) " Je deteste la nature ". The dancing costumes and the masks which are donned on many ceremonial occasions are often masterpieces of the macabre. They seem to be intended to inspire a sense of mystery and of terror. What exactly they symbolize is difficult to determine. Perhaps-we might get a clue from Ruskin's chapter on " Grotesque Renaissance " in The, Stones of Venice. I may be quite wrong but as I look at some of these hideous figures I feel that the artist has some serious purpose in view. This face, malign, cynical, evil-this is life as he sees it and as he wishes observers to see it, to revolt against it and to seek something better. " It has not ", says Ruskin, " been sufficiently considered how evident, throughout the system of creation, is the purpose of God that we should often be affected by Fear; not the sudden, selfish and contemptible fear of immediate danger, but the fear which arises out of the contemplation of great powers in destructive operations and generally from the perception of the presence of death " (1874, Vol. III, ch. 11, 41). Am I very far from being right in imagining that some such intuition moves the African artist and is expressed by the masqueraders when they celebrate the dead? Much more might be said about material symbols. 13 Diffidently I may suggest that these Dogon designs and their purpose afford an alternative explanation of rock paintings elsewhere in Africa and of the paleolithic pictures of Europe. Not that " the dancer identifies himself with the desired animal, executing its movements in order to attract it and lure it into his power" (Leonhard Adam, Primitive Art, 1949, p. 91). Let me, before passing on to ritual, say another word about shrines. According to the O.E.D. a shrine is " that which encloses, enshrines, or screens or in which something dwells; a place where worship is offered or devotions are paid to a saint or deity ". Such a definition covers the statuettes commonly labelled "fetishes " and also many other objects associated with the religious cults of Africans. It may be a human relic (skeleton, jawbone, etc.), a tree or grove of trees, a clay mound, a stone, a cave; and with them goes an altar in the form of a receptacle to receive the offerings. Shrines are graded according to the range of the divinity's powers. The family altar of the Balla is an unmarked spot at the foot of the central pole of the hut and other spots just within the doorway: it is there that the mother and father offer their prayers and gifts to their respective ancestors. This corresponds to the space at the back of the hut which the head of every Zulu household reserves for the ancestors and where he makes his offerings and says his prayers. If he moves to a new residence he induces the spirits to accompany him, by first sacrificing a bullock and then dragging a branch of a certain tree along the path to their new home (Krige, 1936, p. 46). The BaIla also have village shrines: miniature huts built over graves of former headmen; and each commune has a common shrine, consisting of a grove of trees that has grown around the grave of a long-departed Chief. Although not organized administratively into one whole, all the Ila communes have a bond of union in their devotion to a divinity named Bulongo, for whom temporary shrines are built on occasion. The Supreme Being, Leza, has no shrine. Where there is a highly organized tribal system, the shrines are more elaborate, such as public temples in parts of West Africa, on which the artistry of the people is lavished and which harbour symbols representing the attributes or the powers of the gods (Parrinder, 1949, p. 72). All shrines have one common feature: the shrine is not itself an object of worship but points beyond itself; it localizes, bodilizes, makes easier to realize, the presence of ancestors and gods. In this sense they are religious symbols. Some shrines and altars are more than symbols: they are vehicles of mystical energy. Take for example the kutogolo and jabye of the Dogon-personal altars made by a father for his young son. These people believe that at death a person's " soul" (kikinu say) joins the collectivity of ancestors while his nyama (vital force) is set free and seeks a new support. It may find that support,in the foetus 6f the man's</page><page sequence="16">28 EDWIN W. SMITH grandson, in the constitution of which it shares with the father's nyama. The ancestor is the child's counter- part (nani) in the spirit-world, since both participate in the same nyama. That vital force needs constant replenishment, so that it may grow and remain pure. After modelling the kutogolo in clay, the father puts it into contact with his son's head and then consecrates it with a bloody sacrifice, sprinkling the kutogolo with the blood of a fowl and throwing upon it the fowl's heart and liver. Part of the liver, which contains the fowl's nyama, is eaten by the boy. By this rite the boy and the kutogolo are brought into close connexion; thereafter every sacrifice upon the kutogolo strengthens the boy's vital force. In making thejabye, the father incorporates with the clay parings of the boy's finger and toe nails and drops of his blood. An annual sacrifice is made on the jabye and also whenever the boy, or grown man, needs strengthening in a particular crisis. If it be omitted the owner will fall ill or suffer a reverse of fortune (Dieterlen, 1941, pp. 74 sqq.). It may be that in these rites we have a clue to the understanding of the value which Africans assign to their shrines and altars: these not only symbolize a spiritual presence but embody a mystical force strengthened by the blood of sacrificed animals. Be that as it may, the shrine has very considerable value as a social symbol. Africans, it has been well said, feel their unity and perceive their common interests in symbols. Attachment to these more than anything else gives society cohesion and persistence. Symbols reflect the social system and endow it with mystical values which evoke acceptance that goes far beyond obedience exacted by the secular sanction of force (Fortes and Evans-Pritchard, 1940, intro.). It is probable that the shrine as a unifying factor is of greater importance in tribes organized in a segmentary system than in tribes with a centralized administration under a chief or king. That is to say, we should expect the shrine to play a greater part among the Tallensi and Nuer and Tonga than among the Akan, Zulu, Tswana and Lozi. The ancestral cult of the Tallensi centres upon the bogar. the shrine, which may be a tree, or a grove of trees or a cave in a hillside. The bogar of a clan, the bogar of each lineage which is a sub-division of the clan, the bogar of each segment of the lineage, and the shrine of a single houehold, each and every one is the dwelling of ancestors and so close is its identifica- tion with the ancestor in the minds of people that it may be invoked as yaab, " ancestor ". It symbolizes the unity of the clan, the lineage and the household and its differentiation from other groups. The bogar of the clan symbolizes the idea of the ancestors in general; one might even say, with Dr. Fortes, that it symbolizes the concept of ancestry. Further, the bogar is a symbol of the whole social order, conceived as brought into being by the ancestors and kept in being under their spiritual aegis. - When clansmen sacrifice together and participate in eating the sacrificial animals they express and pledge their mutual amity and dependence. You cannot sacrifice propitiously with an enemy-that would anger the ancestors. Initiation into the cult binds the individual, by the most solemn covenant known by these Africans, to uphold the social order bequeathed to the living by the ancestors. Anti-social acts are sins against the ancestors. An adulterous wife is haled to the shrine and mag1e to confess in the presence of the spirits. Her sin endangers t-he life of husband and child by bringinig upon the family the wrath of the ancestors, for her infidelity may make a breach in the continuity of the patriarchal line (Fortes, 1945, p. 98, etc.; 1949, p. 6, 328 sqq.). Much that Dr. Fortes writes about the Tallensi may be said of Africans in general. I have no doubt that religious-minded men of the ancient Greek world regarded Zeus and Apollo, not as fictions or creations of art, but as living deities. To us they appear symbolizations of spiritual ideas and as such have psychic reality-as Shakespeare's Ariel. has. Anyone who has watched the rituals will not doubt that Afr-icans believe implicitly both in the existence of the ancestors and in their intervention in affairs. The psychologist, who does not share that belief, may yet recognize its social value and regard it as a cultural and standardized projection on to the mystical plane of the tangle of attachments, reciproci- ties, tensions and submerged antagonisms that bind parents and children to one another in life; even as a humanist may regard theo-symbolism as no more than a social construct wherein " God " exists as a human idea, presumably fulfilling some conceptual and emotional needs of man, but without separate existence as an exterior entity. According to these views, the symbol has a subjective not an objective referent. (Jung &amp; Kerenyi, 1951, p. 145; Fortes, 1949, p. 234; Firth, 1951, p. 247). In these matters I prefer to stand with the Africans. All over Africa you will find actions which have a meaning beyond themselves. Even the simplest may be symbolical-shaving for example. The final act' in a Nuer marriage is the shaving of the bride's head by a member of the groom's family; this, with her</page><page sequence="17">African Symbolism 29 arrayal in new clothes by her in-laws, symbolizes her new status as a member of their family; she has thrown off the old and taken on the new (Evans-Pritchard, 1948, p. 39). Bathing the body is a universal symbol of inner purification. A lustration is often more than a symbol: it is an efficacious act, producing the effect desired. The seducer of a girl among the Ga of the Gold Coast is heavily fined and both of them plunge into the sea to wash away their sin. Eating and drinking together is almost, but not quite, a universal symbol of amity and reconciliation. If they wish to be particular friends in future two or three youths of Kavirondo, who have passed through the initiation rites together, partake of a common meal ceremonially: the dish of eleusine porridge becomes the symbol and pledge of their comradeship (Wagner, 1950, p. 372). When two Zulus have quarrelled seriously, reconcilia- tion is brought about by a ceremony named ukuthelelana amanzi, " to pour water for one another ". They wash in medicated water, confess their faults, and finally sit together on one mat and drink beer from the same vessel (Krige, 1936, p. 59). African marriage has a twofold aspect: 't is a compact between two families, the seal of which is the transfer of goods from the man's to the woman's family; it is also the union of two individuals, and this, as I said before, is often symbolized by the bride and groom eating together ritually. An exception to the general rule is, found among the Dogon who believe that impurity is contagious; food and drink taken in common establish contact between the nyama of one person and the nyama of another and, enable impurity to flow from one to the other (Dieterlen, 1941, p. 74 sqq.). The African's career may be likened to passing through a series of rooms, the doors of which open and close as he makes his progress. Each stage is marked by a rite de passage-rites which abound in vivid symbolism. There is birth and a naming ceremony; there is initiation into maturity and membership of the tribe; there is marriage; there are death and burial; and, to complete the cycle, what Zulus call ukubuyisa, the bringing of the spirit home. To describe the symbolism of all these rites- would fill a bdok. Let it- suffice to refer briefly to two events, first to the dramatization of a new birth often per- formed in initiation ceremonies. Such dramatization is essentially symbolical for it presents to eye and ear, and to the emotions, a figuration of a spiritual or social fact: the entrance into maturity, with all the rights and obligations thereto attached. Boys are individually or as groups secluded as if shut up in the womb, the instruction given is preparatory to a new life, the ha-rdships they endure represent the pangs of travail, and at the end they may have to creep between the legs of the officiant, as if making a new entry into the world; the camp and all its paraphernalia are burnt, and the initiates are given new clothes and new names; they are reborn. The old women of a Ga family treat an initiate- as a corpse, washing him and cutting his nails: then they dress him magnificently and give him a hearty meal. The boy is dead; a grown man takes his place (Field, 1937,- p. 194). The Zulu father solemnly gives his son an assegai as a symbol of his new status. Dead symbols figure in our marriage customs- dead in no longer having a meaning to us: the throwing of rice, for example. The symbolization in African marriage is apparent to an intelligent observer, whether or no the participants are conscious of it. The symbols are what Jung designates " uniting symbols ", picturing the synthetic union of disparate contending parties. One group is losing a daughter to the other: the incipient antagonism thereby set up meets a corres- ponding reaction in the other group. This conflict and the subsequent establishment of harmonious relations are symbolized in various actions. The bride's family make it clear that she is of inestimable value and far beyond the merits of the other family. When the groom's people bring the bride-wealth cattle, her father assumes a wrathful demeanour; the other males of her family oppose the entry of the cattle into their byre; a sham fight and mutual vituperation follow. When, accompanied by the bridesmaids, the girl pays a first visit to her future home the two parties sit face to face and hurl insults to and. fro; obscenities which could not be uttered on other occasions without rousing the deepest resentment are now shouted with impunity. The girl's chastity is attacked. This may continue all one long night. There are other sham fights, which serve one great purpose: to show that the girl is worth fighting for. The bridegroom probably keeps out of sight. If the bridesmaids see him they may drive him to distraction by their singing of derisive songs. The bride offers-or pretends to offer -resistance up to the last moment: she will not do this, she will not do that, until persuaded by gifts. As Dr. Wagner observes of the Kavirondo Bantu, to make a success of the new relationship a balance must be achieved between the two families: each side must be made to feel that the other side is its equal. The primary significance of the exchange of gifts (other than the bride-wealth) is a demonstration of equality</page><page sequence="18">30 EDWIN W. SMITH in economic and social status (Wagner, 1950, p. 430 sqq.). We can see then that the actions in the course of a marriage are not purely symbolical: they achieve an end; they are efficacious. I cannot enter at length into the vast question of tabu, of which Dr. Fortes has taught us to see the symbolical meaning. Irrational and even nonsensical as many tabus appear to be, they are not to be dis- missed lightly. We have not finished with them when we describe them as " negative magic " or " negative mana ". They point to constitutional infirmities in man which need controlling and mastering: their function is reformative and educative. The totemic proscriptions, the food tabus and the other inhibitions regulating social behaviour, are all simple and definite imperatives symbolizing fundamental imperatives and paramount moral values upon which society is founded but which do not originate in society. " The very fact that they are trivial and can be easily remembered and kept without hardship by young and old make them the more effective social symbols." Their observance is a matter of conscience and belief. " Ritual ideas and values and morphology of the society are inter- related as mind and body. Though Tale religion springs directly out of the social structure, it is fed by streams whose sources lie beneath and beyond the social structure" (Fortes, 1945, p. 142). That structure is the vehicle and instrument of religious and moral values, not their origin. The tabus reflect a conviction that there is a moral order in the universe and that man's well-being depends upon obedience to that order as men see it. African mythology expresses speculative thought in symbolical guise. As Baumann has shown (1936, p. 1) by the analysis of 2,500 myths and folk-tales it is concerned chiefly with a creative principle (generally identical with the High God) and the first man conceived, formed or called forth by this creative power. Among the mythologems we can recognize some of the archetypes which, on Jung's hypothesis, are primordial images which inhere in the collective unconscious and which (like cool springs and hot geysers gushing forth from a subterranean ocean underlying all the continents) emerge into the individual unconscious and conscious in personified or symbolical picture form in myths, fairy tales and dreams (Jacobi, 1951, pp. 56 sqq.). Three of these archetypes-Sky, Earth and Wise Old Man-which figure largely in African myths, may be exhibited diagrammatically as a triangle, with the Sky as apex and Earth and Old Man (transformed into king or chief) as the base. These may be taken as symbols: the Sky stands for the Supreme Power; the Earth for the germinative processes of the soil; and the Chief or King as representative -of the people whom he rules. The diagram suggests the intimate relationship of these three constituents of the African's universe. And to complete the diagram we should insert on the left side between earth and sky such beings as Tano, the Akan river-god, who figure as the offspring of the Sky. In a corresponding position on the other side of the triangle must be placed the hierarchy of ancestors who are the link between God and Man. In the old civilizations of the Near East " the depth and intimacy of man's relationship with nature found expression in the ancient symbol of the mother- goddess" (Frankfort, 1946, p. 371). She was hailed as "wide-bosomed earth, the ever-sure foundation of all ", "mother of all ", "mother of the gods, wife of starry Heaven". "She feeds all creatures that are in the world, all that go upon the goodly land, and all that are in the paths of the sea, and all that fly; all these are fed of her store " (Hesiod, Theogony, 116, Homeric Hymns, XXX, pp. 87, 457). So it is in some parts of Africa. For the Igbo of Nigeria she is Ale, nearest and dearest among the deities; the Ibibio speak her name Eka Abassi in hushed accents: " she it is who dwells on the other side of the wall " (Talbot, 1915, p. 8); the Yoruba know her as Odudua; the Akan as Asase Ya-her sacred day is Thursday and on that day no farmer will till or break the soil (Rattray, 1927, p. 215). As in Greek mythology Ouranos and Gaia were husband and wife, and in Egyptian mytho- logy Geb and Nut were wife and husband, so the African Earth-Mother is widely known as the spouse of the Sky, whose seminal showers fructify her, so that she gives birth to gods and men and all things. 14 T found a similar idea among the BaIla. The Earth-goddess does not make an appearance among the Tallensi but they stand in awe of the earth, symbol of the forces that promote the common welfare of mankind. When they refer to earth (Teng) in its material aspect they use a neutral pronoun, ka; but in reference to earth's mystical aspect, the pronoun is personal, u. Alongside the cult of ancestors is the earth cult, each maximal lineage having its tendaana, priest of the earth. The cults intermingle; while the sowing festival dramatizes man's dependence on the fertility of the soil and on rain, and the dependence of 14 Various forms of this Himmel-Erde mythus in Baumann (1936); distribution map, p. 175: two centres, one in Western Sudan, the other in North-East Africa.</page><page sequence="19">African 31 these on the mystical power of the earth, the harvest festival is dominated by ,the cult of the ancestors and dramatizes man's gratitude for crops and children granted by earth and the ancestors. Earth and the ancestors are linked indissolubly. The shrines rest on the earth in which the ancestors were buried and which would be derelict without the descendants of the ancestors whose dwelling is the shrines. Wild animals roaming the surface of the land symbolize at once the mystical " livingness " of the earth and the mystical force of the ancestors, their power and efficacy in the lives of their descendants. Certain reptiles are " tabus of the earth ": to kill a python or a crocodile within a settlement is almost as bad as murder. There is a strong ethical element in this earth-cult, for the earth forbids the shedding of blood: the cult makes for peace (Fortes, 1945, p. 176). If anyone fights and spills blood on the ground, raises a war-cry without cause, sells another person, he must purify the land by an offering of a cow or sheep. A tendaana said to Rattray: " The land owns the people, that is why a sacrifice is made to her " (Rattray, 1932, p. 347). Rattray found a dual leadership among the Nankanse, who are neighbours of the Tallensi: the tendaana and a secular ruler. The latter said to him: " The people belong to me; the land belongs to the tendaana ". The tendaana is trustee of the land as representing the original inhabitants who as ancestors are still the real owners. The secular ruler descends from a conquering group of invaders who recognized that if the land was to be fruitful the goodwill of these spirit owners must be secured and hence approached them through their actual representative, the tendaana, the land-priest (Rattray, 1932, p. xv). This idea of spiritual ownership, which makes the living occupants tenants of unseen landlords, seems to be fairly widespread in Africa (Richards, 1932, pp. 154 sqq.): I found it among the BaJla. So far as I know the earth-goddess, the great Mother, is not worshipped by the Bantu. Perhaps there is a vestige of her in the Ceres of the Zulus, Nomkhubu- lwana, in whose honour young girls dance in spring- time. But everywhere there is the same reverence for the earth, in which the ancestors are buried and which for living agricultural and pastoral peoples is the source of their material well-being., The strong sentiment built up about it, making alienation of the soil almosi a sacrilege, has never been fully realized by Europeans. As a rule, the two functions of territorial ruler and land priest have coalesced in the person of the chief or king. One epithet of a Tswana chief is Mosadi wa morafe, " Wife of the nation ", i.e., the Provider, as if he summed up all productivity in himself. While this is so, there is some evidence among the Bantu of a distinction between the two offices. The Bemba in Northern Rhodesia were conquering invaders; and it would seem that at first they resorted to the ancestors of the old inhabitants for blessing on the land they forcefully occupied. To some extent they still do so, but in course of time the ancestors of the Chitimukulu, the Paramount Chief, have mostly supplanted the ancestors of the conquered, and he has become land-priest as well as ruler. The fortunes of the soil and of the nation depend upon him. His sexual power imparts vigour and warmth to the land. Senility in him is a menace to the whole people. Were he allowed to sink into feeble old age and into a natural death, the streams would dry up, crops would fail, children would cease to be born, the game would disappear. The unfortunate Chitimukulus were therefore throttled when their virility diminished. The same identification of nation, land and kingship is seen among the Lozi of Northern Rhodesia. The king's most specific title is Litunga, " earth ". He is approached with elaborate etiquette as a semi-divine being. The kingship enshrines the virtue (mata) of all past kings, of God, of the land, and of the nation. The royal graves, the homes of his ancestors, are the centre of a cult which symbolizes the unity of the nation, made up of many subject tribes. These tombs have a mystical power (mata) which symbolizes the power of all past kings, of the land and nation. Before his accession the king is taken to the grave of Mbuyamwambwa, the daughter and wife of God (as in Hesiod Gaia is both spouse and daughter of Ouranos), so that her power may enter into him. " One conimon characteristic of shrines of the earth ", says Dr. Gluckman, " is that they are believed to have on the one hand specific power over small neighbourhoods and over local communities, and on the other hand that they have no boundaries so that their spirits may influence wide areas or the territory of a whole nation. In the- latter circumstances they sometimes form an inter-locked cult. This is marked in the structure of the earth shrines of the Tallensi and the royal graves of the Lozi, and appears to be the case for the sacred groves of the Kamba. The shrines appear thus to sym6olize both small variations in the fertility and health of different communities and areas in different years, and also to symbolize sectional and general interests in fertility and health over small and larger regions of social life."</page><page sequence="20">32 EDWIN W. SMITH The Lozi have a dual system that is reminiscent of the Tallensi. The king is owner of the land; the ngambela (often entitled " Prime Minister ") is the owner of the nation; nay, the king is the land; the ngambela is the commonalty (Colson &amp; Gluckman, 1949, pp. 19 sqq.). Complete merging of the two offices appears in other divine kings. The Shilluk reth is considered by his subjects the dynamical centre of the universe: the well-being of all things depends upon his course of life. The line of divinity runs through him to Nyikang, the first king, and back to Juok, the originhl source of all power. Nyikang is the mythological personification of the timeless kingship which itself symbolizes the national structure and changeless moral order. The reth is the central figure of tribal religion as well as the symbol of political unity. If he shows signs of senility or physical imperfection he must be ceremonially removed by killing and a successor appointed.15 The divine right of kings was never more positively stated than by the dynastic poets of the kingdom of Ruanda. They multiply metaphors in extolling the king's power over nature. The king is the Bull that fecundates the realm. He gathers the clouds, he causes rain to fall, the lightning to flash, the thunder to roll, all by the grace of God who made him king and infused mystical power into him at the moment of conception. As every Hamite sets apart an official bull to be the symbol of its master, so God enthrones the king to be his symbol. Indeed the king is God made accessible to our prayers. God created kings with a view to increase the cows. Le souverain que voici boit le lait trait par Dieu, Et nous buvons le lait qu'a son t-our il trait pour nous. So runs a French rendering of two lines of these remarkable poems.16 What I have said about land, nation and chief exemplifies the truth of Whitehead's dictum: " The object of symbolism is the enhancement of the importance of what is symbolized" (1928, p. 74). To clinch the matter let us glance at the Swazi 15 In his Frazer Lecture (1923) Dr. Seligmnan reviewed the evidence for divine kings in Africa, including the Shilluk reth (Egypt and Negro Africa). More material has become available since then. See Evans-Pritchard's Frazer Lecture, 1948: he thinks the killing of the king fictitious. 16 Note in Africa, xvi (1946), pp. 45 sq.

It is enacted yearly, in connexion with eating the first Afruits, and is intended to maintain and increase the vigour of the king. His mystical power is one with the powers of nature: upon him depends the rainfall, the fertility of the soil, the success of harvest; and his growth in power is the nation's growth in power. The time for holding the Incwala is- fixed by reference to both sun and moon. It must begin when the moon is " dark" so that as the moon waxes the king may wax with it in strength. The sun must have reached his southernmost position; that is, according to Swazi fancy, when the sun is resting in his hut and is about to leap out to start his journey anew: " The king races with the sun ". The gathering of the people, all, dressed in their finery, demonstrates and cements the unity of the tribe. The dancers first assume the shape of a crescent and then that of a circle. This is not pure symbol: they represent the waxing moon; and their vigorous dancing imparts such vigour to the king that he too may wax in fullness of power. " Medicines ", the vehicles of mystical force, are administered to the king. Men are sent to wade into the sea to catch foam at the top of the waves, which is the strength of ocean; other men bring water from a river in spate. As the Swazi say: " The. waters of the world are fetched to give strength and purity to the king ". At a certain point the king, secluded in his ceremonial booth, spits " medicine" to the east and to the west, and as he does so the people shout: " He stabs it !" It means that he is strengthening the earth. He is hailed as " Our Bull! ", for just as a bull fecundates the herd so he fecundates the soil. The king, seated naked upon a black ox, is washed with sacred water in which " medicines " have been placed. One of these is a drug given to bulls and men to stimulate their procreative power. The finest bull in the herds is slaughtered and the parts which contain its power are made into " medicines " for the king. Another " medicine" is lusekwane, a tree which grows with amazing rapidity and whose leaves retain their verdancy for many months. Branches of this tree and a shrub that is distinguished by its hardness are piled about the king's hut so that their qualities may pass into him. By the fifth day he has acquired sufficient strength to eat the first fruits; and the people too can then eat of them. The king now appears before his people in - the guise of Silo, a monster of fearful shape. Each item of his clothing bears a meaning. The bright green, razor-edged grass and evergreen shoots which cover his body are not</page><page sequence="21">African Symbolism 33 only symbols of life, they impart their freshness to the king. His shield is smeared with mfukwane fat, a medicament so potent that only the king, his mother and his chief wife are strong enough to tolerate it, and it makes them still more powerful. The final day is one of purification. A huge pyre is built and the king sets it alight by rubbing two sticks together. All articles used during the Incwala are thrown into the flames. " The filth of the king and of all his people ", the Swazi say, " lies here on the fire." The fire is cathartic in effect. It is also an offering to the ancestors. If they are pleased with the Incwala they will send rain. Now the nation gives itself up to revelry. The king is strong; the earth is strong; the nation is strong (Kuper, 1944, pp. 230 sqq.). The king of the neighbouring Zulus also underwent rejuvenating processes at the time of the annual First Fruits (umkosi). He was not only the symbol of social cohesion: he was its artificer (Gluckman, 1940, pp. 25 sqq.). 4. From what has been said it is evident that Africans make use of pure symbols-symbols, that is, which point to, represent, call to mind, something other than themselves. Some objects and many actions, however, which appear at first glance to be symbolic are not indicative, nor representative, but coercive, creative, productive. Others appear to combine both functions; they are both symbolic and efficacious; lustrations not only suggest purification, they purify. The shrine is not only a reminder of the ancestors' presence; it is the residence of ancestors and has a mystical power in virtue of their dwelling therein. The symbol melts into the talisman; or the talisman melts into the symbol. It is often difficult to determine which is which. We are thus led to the consideration of occult forces, automatic in action or activated by persons. The frequent confusion of symbol with talisman may be illustrated by reference to language. The semanticists, who rightly inveigh against " verbal magic ", point to the dual function of words: the symbolic and the emotive. The symbolic use is to record or to communicate; the emotive use is to express or excite feelings and attitudes. The two functions may occur together but in principle are distinct. Their subtle interweaving is the main reason why the difference is not always recognized (Ogden &amp; Richards, 1930, pp. 149 sqq.). We are all familiar with the evocative virtue of words. The transition is easy to the idea that words have themselves causal efficacy. "Comment changer le monde?" asks one of Anatole France's characters. " Par la parole, mon enfant ", is the answer. " Rien n'est plus puissant que la parole. . . . La parole, coumme la fronde de David, abat les violents et fait tomber les forts. C'est l'arme invincible" (Monsietur Berger a' Paris, p. 257). "And though a tongue may shoot forth bolts undue To stir men's spleen and gall their inmost soul, Yet words may salve the wound that words have made.""7 Africans, like ourselves, know the power of words, evocative, persuasive, compelling. What our poets affirm metaphorically, they accept as literal truth: words are projectiles charged with explosive substance and driven by mystic force. Verbal abuse (the Balla call it kutuka) is vehemently resented and may even result in the enslavement of the abuser, not simply because it is an offence against personal dignity but because it produces some physical or metaphysical harm to the abused. There are occasions--as in the so-called " joking relationships " -when abusive and obscene language of the most vitriolic kind is not only tolerated but enjoined; it is an approved pattern of behaviour. It all depends upon the motive. Intention is the explosive with which the projectile is charged. The curse is a particularised and intensified form of abuse. It has a malefic potency of its own, imparted by the ill-will of the curser. Nothing sounds so terrible in the ears of an African as the curse of his mother. She resorts to it only when everything else fails to win him from his evil ways. She may reinforce her words by a gesture, or the gesture may carry her unspoken thought. An Ila woman strips off her scanty garment before her incorrigible son: that is chikuto: the most awful curse conceivable. It strikes with damning effect. Go where he may, do what he may, he cannot escape: it will hound him to violent, ignominious death. The Greeks would have said that he was pursued by the Erinnyes. Threatenings, whether in words or in gesture (such 17 Aeschylus, The Suppliants, ii, 2. " Words are things. . .. They are deeds: the man who brings word of a lost battle can work no comparable effect with the muscles of his arm: lago's breath is as truly laden with poison and murder as the fangs of the cobra and the drugs of the assassin." Raleigh, 1918, p. 108. (6736) c</page><page sequence="22">34 EDWIN W. SMITH as the pointing of a forefinger) are to be avoided: predire c'est produire. You do not express admiration for a pretty child: your fair words may be taken to express a concealed malice. It is in thought that mystical force resides. It is here that we discover the secret of witchcraft as Africans believe in it and dread it. In sorcery a man or woman employs certain substances believed to contain occult force which can be liberated by the utterance of a spell. Witchcraft, on the other hand, consists in the emission of psychic energy from a malevolent disposition, with intent to cause misfortune and death to a particular person or group. It may be pictured as, or identified with, an organ of the body, real or mythical: the Azande name it mangu, the Mende hona, the Tetela, aloka. The malice, jealousy, hatred, is thrust from the mind like a beam of electrons from a Radar transmitter: the analogy is very close when, as may happen, the beam rebounds back on the witch. The Zande word for shooting with bow and arrow-no-also signifies " to bewitch " (Evans-Pritchard, 1937, p. 37). The Ila expression for the witch's effluence is derived from the verb zua, " to push, thrust ": inzuikizhi is " that by means of which one thrusts out in somebody's direction ". The warlock and witch work in an atmosphere laden with envy and malice: the circumfluent ill-feeling strengthens his or her power to do evil. Scientists are inclined to treat with scorn the idea that the human brain can emit electric charges which may be picked up by a receiving brain. They are not so sure that telepathy is a fantasy. Telergy, telekinesis, present no difficulty to Africans. Africans are intuitively or inductively aware of what modern physical science teaches: there is more in things than appears to the senses. They are more capable of abstract thinking than is sometimes recognized: witness the facility which their language affords the Bantu of expressing qualities by means of the nominal prefix bu: muntu is " a person "; buntu is the inness of a person, personality, virtue (virtus).'8 So in things there is an essence which may or may not be manifested in their appearance but is certainly known by its effects. Plants and roots have their therapeutical qualities. An Igbo doctor knows the difference between ogwu, the visible and tangible root or leaf, and ire, the essential effective element of the ogwu. He himself possesses ire as a congenital quality, 18 kono " there "; vukona, " the essence of being there ". H. P. Junod, 1938, p. 38. as also does a woodcarver of pre-eminent skill and an orator who is eloquent beyond his fellows. The Ila doctor distinguishes between musamo, the medicine which he handles, and bwanga, its active principle. The Nkundu doctor likens the elinia of his medicines to the power of an electric fish to give you a shock. The occult power is manifest and operative in animals and men and in ritual acts.19 It is thls potentiality that differentiates a talisman from a symbol. Up to a point the African is correct in his observations and in his intuitions. There is a latent energy in things. The African goes astray by pushing his analogies too far-as my old friend Mungaila did when he slipped on my wrist a bracelet containing a powerful bwanga and said that while I wore it everybody would love me! This sort of thing is usually described as " magic ", and " magic " and " religion " are distinguished as two disparate things. Yet many anthropologists recognize that the distinction is difficult to maintain and is indeed artificial (Firth, 1938, p. 152). I think that in this context the word " magic " might now be given a decent burial and that we should rather speak of various levels or stages or phases of religion. That is the practice of the latest students of Comparative Religion, such as Dr. John Murphy (1949, p. 76, etc.). Where others have written "magic ", I have preferred to write " dynamism ". I did not invent the term. Van Gennep (while retaining " magic " for the technique of religion) adopted " dynamism" for the impersonalist theory of mana in contrast to the per- sonalist theory of animism, these two theories con- stituting the belief-system of religion (1909, p. 17). 19 Webster (1948: not very satisfactorily) and Baumann (1950) collate African (and other) names for the occult mana- like power. Baumann treats nyama primarily as Rehemacht and defines it thus: " Nyama ist eihe iibertragbare, halb spirituell, halb stofflich gedachte ' Macht ', die von Menschen, Tieren und manchmal auch von Baumen ausgeht und nach dem mehr oder weniger gewaltsamen Tod des Nyama-Tragers an den unmittelbar am Tode Beteiligten Rache nahmen kann " (1950, p. 228). Not seldom, he says, nyama appears as a kind of " soul " " oder als vitale Triebkraft ". The French anthropologists (Griaule and his coadjutors) write of nyama as " force vitale " and define it thus: " Le nyama est une energie en instance, impersonelle, inconsciente, repartie dans tous les hommes, animaux, vegetaux, dans les etres sumaturels, dans les choses, dans la nature et qui tend a faire perseverer dans son etre le support auquel elle est affectee temporairement (etre mortel) ou etemellement (etre immortel)" (Griaule, Masque Dogons, chap. lv.). Father Tempels employs the same term " force vitale " in describing Bantu philosophy. The word nyama is probably related to vaamis, the active principle in the seminal fluids (not the fluids themselves) on which, the Tallensi believe, procreation depends (Fortes, 1949, p. 20.)</page><page sequence="23">African Symbolism 35 Dr. Marett took dynamism to be that elementary stage of religion in which to the sacred and divine are attributed the impersonal nature of a force (1914, p. xxxii). In Africa the three phases of religion dynamism, spiritism and theism--exist side by side or interwoven in one whole. CONCLUSION. Professor Whitehead once hazarded the opinion that modern civilized people exhibit a revulsion from symbolism: " Hard-headed men want facts and not symbols". Yet, he added, however you may endeavour to expel symbolism, it ever returns. "It is inherent in the very texture of human life." While this lecture was making, the place and power of symbolism in our national life were magnificently and unmistak- ably revealed. In the majestic pageant of King George's funeral procession the symbols of sovereignty, the Crown, the Sceptre, and the Orb, brought home to multitudes the meaning of kingship; the martial splendour bespoke the power of Britain; the music, sad and triumphant, expressed the nation's faith; and the final words " our dear brother" proclaimed the oneness of king and people in a common humanity. The King himself was acclaimed "the symbol of the people's unity "; and the Queen "the symbol of the life of the nation and Commonwealth-the temporal embodiment of an undying idea " (The Times, 8.2.52). Some observers noted and regretted the absence from that magnificent procession of the democratic symbols of Parliament and Cabinet. This anachronism calls to mind another of Whitehead's dicta-one that is very relevant to our subject. " The art of free society consists first in the maintenance of the symbolic code; and secondly in fearlessness of revision, to secure that the code serves those purposes which satisfy an enlightened reason. Those societies which cannot combine reverence to their symbols with freedom of revision, must ultimately decay either from anarchy, or from the slow atrophy of a life stifled by useless shadows" (Whitehead, 1928, p. 104). Symbols are not something adventitious. They are grounded in, they spring from, are supported by, an intellectural structure. A crisis comes when that structure is undermined by the advent of new know- ledge. Until new symbols expressing new convictions are born and generally adopted there is mental chaos and a slackening of moral restraint. The political, social and material transformations that are taking place so rapidly in Africa are necessarily accompanied by ideological changes which involve psychological crisis for many Africans. The intro- duction of modern scientific knowledge and of Christianity cuts at the roots of much of their old religion. Many of the features of dynamism, with its erroneous assumptions and irrational practices, are seen to be inimical to progress. " Did you ever hear leaders like George Bernard Shaw suggest that they attained success through the medium of a few words written upon a piece of parchment? " In those words an African leader challenges his educated fellow- countrymen. In some respects the ancestor cult fosters inertia. Symbols they will, and must, have. Will they throw overboard all the old symbolism and the values which it enshrined? Will they discover new unitive symbols? Will they take over and reshape our European symbols? Will African Christians follow the example of the early Church and adopt, and read new meanings into, the old pagan symbols? Much depends upon the answers that are given to such questions. . . . But that-that is another story. Postscript Since this lecture was put into print a book written by an eminent neurologist has come into my hands- Mind, Perception and Science (Oxford, Blackwell, 1951) by W. Russell Brain, President of the Royal College of Physicians of London. I find support therein for some things which I tried to say in the first part of the lecture. One of the functions of the mind, says Sir Russell,20 is symbolical representation. Knowledge of the physical work is knowledge by means of conceptual symbols derived from perception by a process of inference. " Need we believe that a nervous system evolved to facilitate action upon the physical world is capable of providing conceptual symbols adequate for the whole of reality ? He is a bold man who could claim that to-day" (p. 71). . as soon as we realize that science is only a language (i.e, a form of symbolical representation) and that many aspects of the 'invisible fabrick' of life can be better understood in other languages, and even in symbols other than words, we haVe opened the door to a great liberation of the spirit" (p 87). He quotes with approval Suzanne Langer's words: " the limits of language are not the last limits of experience and things inaccessible to language may have their own forms of conception, that is to say, their own symbolic devices". 20 Quoted by permission of Blackwell Scientific Publica tions, Ltd.
