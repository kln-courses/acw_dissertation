<plain_text><page sequence="1">THE HISTORICAL SIGNIFICANCE OF THE MURALS IN THE TEMPLE OF THE WARRIORS, CHICHEN ITZA DONALD E. WRAY A CCORDING to Alfred M. Tozzer, events relating to the taking of Chichen Itza by the Toltecs are depicted in the frescoes and bas-reliefs on buildings at that site which date from the Mexican period. In a paper entitled "Maya and Toltec Figures at Chichen Itza,"' he analyzes scenes from the Temple of the Jaguars, the Monjas, the North Temple of the Ball Court, and the Northeast Colonnade with reference to the known historic conquest and interprets them as portrayals of the Mexican attacks, the submission of the Maya, and the recognition of Toltec supremacy. In his paper, Tozzer tells us that the Toltec warrior is characterized by a mosaic headdress; a breast ornament, probably also of mosaic; a back shield or dorsal mirror; decorated garters; bands below the knee; and sandals. He carries a bundle of spears and a bag in his left hand and an atlatl in his right. His left arm is pro- tected by padding or a round shield. He usually wears a conventionalized bird design as part of his headdress or breast ornament, although this is sometimes replaced by a realistic bird. His nose ornament is a button or pendant in con- trast to the long bead worn by the Maya. At the time Tozzer wrote his article, the re- sults of the excavations in the Temple of the Warriors were not available. However, he pre- dicted that "the Warrior Temple may show, retrospectively perhaps, as this building has a decadent style and is undoubtedly later than the Ball Court Group, a pure Toltec structure approached through a colonnade recounting the Maya subjugation." Morris and Charlot have made a detailed analysis of the various elements shown in the murals and have recog- nized the presence of the characteristics which Tozzer calls "Toltec."2 The present paper is concerned with the interpretation of the entire pattern of action which can be seen in the four scenes which have been reconstructed more or 1 Proceedings of the 23rd International Congress of Ameri- canists, pp. 155-164. 2 Earl H.

It may be regarded as a con- tinuation of Tozzer's work and an application of his hypothesis to the murals from the Tem- ple of the Warriors. The first of these murals3 shows a village undergoing attack by a group of warriors. The defenders are distinguished by horizontal paral- lel brown lines painted over their entire bodies. Their costumes consist of sandals, white garters or leg bands, red loincloths, sometimes red shirts or tunics, earplugs, simple feather head- dresses, and round shields with red centers and decorations of white feathers. The attackers have solid black body paint, except for their hands and in some cases their faces,' and wear sandals, blue loincloths, earplugs, rectangular or round breast ornaments, and turbans with three or four large plumes. They carry small round shields which are white but lack feather decorations. That the attacking force is winning is shown by the prostrate figures of two de- fenders and by the line of captives who have been stripped and bound and are being led away by members of the attacking party. At the lower edge of this scene, near the line of captives and victors, there intrudes a plumed-serpent head which seems to bear no relationship to the rest of the picture. A similar example is found in the murals of the Jaguar Temple,'where the plumed serpent is connected with the attacking force. This would seem to indicate that Quetzalcouatl was the patron of the attacking force in each case. Similarly, in the mural under discussion, an anthropomorphic jaguar may represent the association of Jaguar warriors. The second mural4 from the Temple of the Warriors shows a water scene after a battle be- tween black-painted warriors and a red people with long yellow hair. The latter are shown as having fallen in battle or bound as captives. Another part of the mural5 shows one of the yellow-haired people, with green beads strung in his hair, about to be sacrificed to Quetzal- couatl. He is held by two of the black-painted 3 Ibid., Vol. 2, P1. 139. 4 Ibid., PI. 146. 6 Ibid., P1. 145. 25</page><page sequence="2">26 AMERICAN ANTIQUITY [1,1945 men over a block which is part of the coiled serpent body. A priest, also black, holds a knife poised above the victim. The priest wears blue cuffs, a blue tunic, and a green headband to which are fastened a yellow-trimmed white disk and three plumes. A third section of mural6 shows a white pyra- mid, on the summit of which is a huge jaguar. Before the crouching animal is a tripod incense burner painted with horizontal green and white stripes crossed by black bars. Associated with this picture is a series of objects such as a bowl of incense grains, lengths of cloth, and a feath- ered headdress which in style and arrangement resembles the tribute rolls of the Aztec codices. The fourth scene shows a seacoast village in considerable detail.7 The significant objects for this discussion are a series of canoes in the water. Each is propelled by an oarsman wearing a white kilt and white turban and carries, in addition, two brown-skinned warriors dressed in brown or green tunics, white turbans, and earplugs and carrying round shields, atlatls, and sheaves of arrows. In contrast to the other scenes of battle and sacrifice, this mural shows a village at peace and warriors passing by with- out attacking. A clue to this situation may be found in the fact that the figure of Quetzal- couatl hovers over a shrine in the village, indi- cating either acceptance of Mexican gods or Mexican rule, or both. The interpretation of the murals described above rests in part on the work of Tozzer and in part on the context in which they occur. The Temple of the Warriors seems to be, as Tozzer predicted, a building of pure Toltec inspiration. The predominance of warrior figures in the sculptures and the presence of Jaguar and Eagle symbols representing the warrior asso- ciations would seem to confirm the interpreta- tion that the temple was especially dedicated to the military organizations of the Toltec. We might expect that murals placed in such a struc- ture would commemorate the conquests of the builders. There arises the problem of the identi- fication of Toltec and Maya groups in the murals in situations which would bear out this hypothesis. In none of the reconstructed sections of murals described does the "typical" Toltec warrior appear. This may be explained by the 6 Ibid., PI. 151. 7 Ibid ., PI. 159. fact that in the complete mural sections the warriors are shown in actual fighting dress, whereas the "typical" warrior costume is found only in scenes of a ceremonial or formal nature. In scenes of active fighting, we might expect to find a much simpler costume. The full warrior costume occurs in other portions of the mural fragments which seem to have formed a pro- cession.8 The only figure with a majority of the typical traits which can be tied into a scene is shown in Morris' Plate 143, b. This fragment shows a warrior with the round blue earplug, blue nosebutton and pendant, blue bird-form necklace, quilted sleeve, basket, and darts. The black warriors have been identified by Morris and Charlot as Toltec, in spite of the lack of distinctive costume. Black body paint combined with the use of the back shield and the atlatl is depicted in a mural from the Tem- ple of the Jaguars. The atlatl and sheaf of spears occur in the hands of canoe-born war- riors in the last mural described. In addition, there is a difference in the physical features of Mexican and Maya. The Mexican has a rounded or straight forehead and a short snub nose; the Maya has a high forehead and a prom- inent nose. The first of these physical types co- incides with the black warriors who are victori- ous in all scenes, the second with the light people who are captives and subjects. The long yellow hair of the captives in the second mural demands further explanation. Thompson, in a paper entitled "Representa- tions of Tlalchitonatiuh at Chichen Itza, Yu- catan, and at Baul, Escuintla, "9 has identified the yellow hair with green beads as an attribute of the Mexican sun god which was assumed by sacrificial victims, prisoners, and warriors en- gaged in battle. This explanation is adequate for the scene of sacrifice to Quetzalcouatl but does not quite explain the presence of this hair ornamentation in the actual battle scene, where it is found on a group of persons who are un- armed and, furthermoie, have the deformed head and prominent nose which characterize the Maya. Possibly this group was engaged in ritual activity when it was intercepted by the black warriors. Another feature which aids in the identifica- tion of the Toltecs is the presence of the figure of Quetzalcouatl. In the first mural, the feath- 8 Ibid., PIs. 150, c; 152, a; 155, a; 156, b; 161, d. 9 Notes on Middle American Archaeology and Ethnology, No. 19, Carnegie Institution of Washington, 1943, p. 118.</page><page sequence="3">WEITZEL] CHICHEN ITZA INSCRIPTIONS 27 ered serpent is associated with the line of vic- torious warriors and their captives; in another, a scene depicting sacrifice, the black warriors are servants of the plumed serpent; and in still another, a group of Toltec warriors is passing, without molesting it, a coastal village over whose shrine appears the figure of Quetzal- couatl. While the costumes of the conquered group vary, the physical type and the use of striped body paint are fairly constant. The physical peculiarities of the Maya can be recognized even in the case of the unusual group with decorated yellow hair, and the sacrificial scene is an especially vivid portrayal of the subjection of the Maya type. If these interpretations are correct, we have in the murals from the Temple of the Warriors a pictorial record of the political and military subjugation of the Maya by the Toltec. This analysis is strengthened by the position of the murals in a building which seems to have been dedicated primarily to a warrior cult. The murals would indicate that much of the conquest took place along the coast. Two battle scenes take place near the sea, while in the one peaceful scene a line of canoes carries Toltec warriors past a village over which their special deity, Quetzalcouatl, is dominant. In other murals we see Mayan captives being led away and sacrificed to the Mexican god and, ap- parently, the presentation of tribute to the patron animal of one of the warrior associations. 5526 Ellis Avenue Chicago, Illinois July, 1944</page></plain_text>
