COLBURN Abstract Eastern imports, including finished products, raw materials, and technologies, first appear in Crete in the Early Minoan (EM) II period. The relative inaccessibility of imports to Crete, and that they are found in clusters? sometimes in monumental tombs or associated with ritual objects?suggests that they were used in the creation and continued negotiation of elite identity. Although found primarily in mortuary contexts, these imports often show evidence of wear and sometimes repair, indicating that they were used during the lifetimes of their owners be fore being deposited in tombs. As many of these imports were used as bodily adornment, they were highly visible and may have taken on a performative role, especially during ceremonies or rituals. Several of the imports also draw on Eastern power symbols. Thus, as emblems, exotic imports were likely used by the Cretan emergent elite to distinguish themselves from the general population of the island and perhaps to align their new status with that of the ruling elite from powerful Eastern centers.* INTRODUCTION Recent years have seen an increase in studies of inter connections between the Aegean and the Near East in the Bronze Age.1 Frescoes identified as Minoan in style, subject matter, and medium have been found in Egypt, Israel, Turkey, and Syria, and Minoan pottery has been discovered at sites throughout the Aegean and eastern Mediterranean.2 These discoveries have led many scholars to redefine Crete's place in the diplo matic relations and cultural interaction of the Middle and Late Bronze Age eastern Mediterranean.3 Yet little light has been shed on the role that access to distant lands played in the construction and maintenance of social boundaries in the formative Prepalatial period. Rather, most studies of Crete's extra-island interac tion at this time, particularly with the Near East and Egypt, use exotic imports primarily as evidence for Early Minoan chronology.4 Their social significance is generally ignored.5 This article brings to the fore the critical role played by exotica, including finished products, raw materials, and technologies, in the social and political develop ment of Prepalatial Crete.6 Specifically, through a contextual analysis of Eastern imports found in secure Prepalatial contexts, I argue that exotica were used and displayed as emblems7?often as bodily adornment? in the creation and continued negotiation of an elite * I would like to thank the many friends and colleagues who provided feedback on various versions of this paper, especially Emma Blake, Susan Downey, Maura Heyn, Kate Mondloch, and Lynn Swartz Dodd.

I have made this distinction because the numer ous examples of Cycladica on Crete suggest that they were not perceived as exotic in all cases. The presence of what appears to be an EM I Cycladic settlement at Hagia Photia in eastern Crete (Day et al. 1998, 147) and the burial caves of north central Crete and Poros-Katsambas (Dimopoulou 1997) seems to confirm this view. While this assessment of the sig nificance of Cycladica in Crete may not apply to all examples, the social significance of Cycladic imports is beyond the scope of this article.

COLBURN [AJA 112 identity in the period preceding the first Minoan pal aces.8 The Cretan elite readily exploited Eastern im ports and power symbols to set themselves apart from the general population of the island and perhaps to establish connections to the ruling elite from impor tant Eastern centers (fig. 1) .9 HISTORIOGRAPHICAL CONSIDERATIONS The role of extra-island influence in the develop ment of palatial society in Crete has been debated among Aegean and Near Eastern prehistorians since the early 20th century.10 It is generally agreed that Crete was first settled by immigrants from Anatolia during the Neolithic period in the eighth millennium B.C.E.11 Scholarly opinion, however, varies as to the significance of Crete's foreign interaction during the millennium preceding the first Minoan palaces. Sir Arthur Evans first argued for a continuity of tradition in Crete from Neolithic through Geometric levels.12 This evolutionary view prevailed until the end of the first quarter of the 20th century, when Childe's work brought diffusionist models to the forefront of Aegean and eastern Mediterranean studies. He hypothesized Near Eastern influence on the Aegean civilizations, specifically on Crete, at the beginning of the Early Bronze Age,13 and he was followed by several schol ars who argued that a new wave of immigrants ar rived from Anatolia at this time.14 These models held their ground until the early 1970s, when Renfrew, pioneering the New Archaeology in the Aegean, ar gued instead that the transformation from the Cretan Neolithic to the Early Minoan period was the result of indigenous development.15 According to Renfrew, the decisive factor for the "emergence" of Aegean civiliza tion was the development of a redistribution system for subsistence commodities and the production of new crops, specifically grapes and olives, which served as the economic foundation for palatial civilization.16 The idea of indigenous development of the palatial civilization of Crete continued to gain support among scholars, and it was not until the work of Cherry in the early 1980s that the evolutionary model came under fire. He questioned the standard opinion that "the birth of palatial society on Crete was the inevitable out come of inexorably slow growth and cumulative devel opment during the very long gestatory EM period."17 According to Cherry, the lack of evidence of "central persons operating from central places (as later in the palaces)"?as well as the lack of any "obvious indica tions of social ranking or stratification," the absence of "unambiguous signs of craft specialization or of the institutionalized division of labour," and the lack of "economic links beyond the local residential unit" throughout the Early Minoan period?suggests that the transition to a palatial society in ca. 2000 B.C.E. was not the result of a slow, evolutionary process. Rather, it was a "discontinuous quantum leap" unlike anything the island had seen before.18 While Cherry did not ar gue in favor of exogenous stimuli as the impetus for the palatial society of Crete, he refused to accept the popular evolutionary arguments because of the lack of supporting archaeological evidence. Since Cherry's work, numerous studies of Prepala tial cemeteries, seals, and pottery have brought to 81 use the term "elite" very broadly in this article to refer to individuals or groups that actively attempt to distinguish themselves from the general population of Crete by establish ing themselves in positions of power based on wealth, politics, or religion. I do not, however, see the defining features of the elite as static but rather as fluid, especially during this early stage of development; see also Shore 2002. 9 Because identity can be layered and multivalent, Eastern imports could mark other kinds of identity?ethnic, gender, and religious. 10 For a recent overview, see articles in Laffineur and Nie meier 1995. 11 Affinities between the material culture of the Cretan Neolithic and that of Neolithic and Chalcolithic Anato lia have long been recognized. Sir Arthur Evans (1921, 14) thought that Neolithic Crete should be regarded as an insu lar offshoot of an extensive Anatolian province. This view is echoed in the later work of Furness (1953,134), who, after an in-depth analysis of Neolithic pottery from the early excava tions at Knossos, suggested an Anatolian derivation of Cretan Neolithic culture. The material culture brought to light by J.D. Evans (1963) through excavations at Knossos seems to corroborate this argument. Later studies, based not on pot tery but on economic models (esp. the appearance of import ed domesticated plants and animals), also suggest the arrival of Near Eastern or Anatolian immigrants on Crete during the Neolithic period (Renfrew 1972, 50; Broodbank and Strasser 1991, 236-37; Broodbank 2000,97). 12 Evans 1906; see also Hawes and Hawes 1909,2. Note that Evans' scholarship is somewhat contradictory on this issue. In some cases, he was a strong proponent of the "ex Oriente lux" theory, which saw Near Eastern and Egyptian influence on Early Minoan Crete. 13 Childe 1925,1950,1958. 14 Pendlebury 1939, 53; Weinberg 1965, 308; Caskey 1970, 800; Warren 1974, 41-2. The diffusionist model prevalent at this time is still largely evolutionary in scope when it comes to explaining the rise of the palaces in Crete 1,000 years later. Most scholars who argue for outside influence on EM I Crete are opposed to the idea of later foreign influence and treat the Minoan palaces as an "organic" development. 15 Renfrew 1972. 16Renfewl972,480. 17 Cherry 1983, 33. 18 Cherry 1983, 33.</page><page sequence="3">2008] EASTERN IMPORTS IN PREPALATIAL CRETE 205 light evidence of social ranking in Prepalatial Crete.19 The evidence provided by exotic imports, however, has been virtually ignored.20 It is not the intention of this study to resurrect earlier diffusionist views that ar gued for the development of a palatial civilization on Crete as the result of Near Eastern influence. Rather, by drawing on recent scholarship on social identity and distance value, this article explores how certain inhabitants of Prepalatial Crete actively transformed their knowledge of and access to distant lands into powerful symbols of elite status.21 THEORETICAL CONSIDERATIONS! DISTANCE AND SOCIAL STATUS Identity is generally viewed as fluid and dynamic, with certain characteristics selected as distinguishing an individual or group from others.22 In the develop ment of complex societies, as in the transition from 19 Soles 1988; Wilson 1994; Sbonias 1995; Karytinos 1998; Maggidis 1998; Day 2004. -? This is perhaps due to the backlash of the New Archaeol ogy against diffusionist models, which were so prevalent in the mid 20th century. As a result, many Aegeanists since the 1970s have argued for cultural continuity in Bronze Age Crete, em phasizing an evolutionary development of the EM I society through the rise of a "palatial" civilization (see, e.g., Renfrew 1972; Warren 1974, 1987; Branigan 1988, 180). Notable ex ceptions include Davis 1977; Watrous 1987, 2001; Aruz 1993, 1995; Schoep 2006. 21 See, e.g., Sherratt and Sherratt 1991; Knapp 1998. Al though other studies of Crete's foreign contact in the Prepala tial period exist, most use the evidence for overseas interaction to refine the chronology of the Prepalatial period. While these studies are important, the examination of exotic objects in context provides valuable information about Prepalatial soci ety by according agency to the population that acquired and displayed these imports. For a detailed discussion of the ben efits of an agency-oriented local perspective, see Goldstein (2000), who promotes this model over what he calls globalist colonial or clientage models. Van de Mieroop (2002) applies this methodology to Early Dynastic Babylonia. Specifically, he argues against the dominant theory that the impetus for inter action with distant lands was the need for resources that were unavailable close to home. He states that "southern Mesopota mia had the natural resources required to be self-sufficient in its basic needs" and that "imports from the surrounding areas were primarily luxury goods desired by elites to enhance their social status as distinguished from that of the general popula tion" (Van de Mieroop 2002,125); see also Berg 2002. 22 Jenkins 1996, 3-4; see also Barth 1994; Jones 1997. .Al though the work of Barth and Jones is concerned primarily with ethnic identity, their framework can be applied to other collective identities. See Jenkins (1996, 90-103) for a discus sion of this as it relates to Barth's work.</page><page sequence="4">206 CYNTHIA S. COLBURN [AJA 112 Prepalatial to Palatial Crete, class or status is arguably the most salient type of identity. Class in this context refers not solely to economic wealth but more gener ally to one's social worth. Veblen laid the theoretical groundwork for the study of class by identifying the phenomenon of conspicuous consumption, whereby both the quantity and quality of material goods are used lavishly to enhance social prestige and to mark status.23 The mere acquisition of goods is not enough, for beyond obtaining and possessing such elite goods, knowledge of how to consume them in such a way as to advertise elite status is essential. Through this process, goods are converted into distinctive signs or symbols of one's position within society.24 In order to be accepted into a specific social class, one must display the ap propriate symbols. And although wealth is needed to obtain class-specific symbols, wealth alone without the symbols does not guarantee entry into the class.25 This approach to understanding class and status has long been utilized by archaeologists, art historians, and cul tural anthropologists who see certain types of material culture, usually designated luxury goods, as evidence of social ranking. The consumption of these items serves to legitimize or naturalize systems of inequality.26 Exotic imports often belong to the category of luxury goods.27 In traditional societies, access to distant places, peoples, objects, and ideas is frequently used by indi viduals and groups in the negotiation of power.28 This is due, in part, to the costliness of long-distance travel and the economic benefits that long-distance travel brings to an individual or group.29 More recent scholarship, however, has focused on the additional ideological or symbolic value assigned to objects acquired from dis tant lands.30 When traveling to faraway places, one may encounter locations and people that are in some way "foreign" or unknown, and they may be seen as "su pernatural, mythical, and powerful."31 Moreover, there is some uncertainty associated with distance, which is often seen as an obstacle to be overcome. One who overcomes such an obstacle by traveling to or accessing distant places may be considered to have special power or control within a given society.32 The materialization and confirmation of such power was accomplished through the acquisition of exotic goods, which provid ed tangible proof of one's access to distant places and people.33 Such materialized ideology is an important source of power that both strengthens horizontal ties between elites and reinforces vertical relations between elites and nonelites.34 In premodern societies, exotic or nonlocal goods were often given considerable visibil ity because of their use in the creation and continued negotiation of elite identities. This was the case in Pre palatial Crete, where many Eastern imports were made into jewelry to be displayed on the body. EXOTICA IN CONTEXT! EASTERN IMPORTS IN PREPALATIAL CRETE Eastern imports found in secure Prepalatial contexts in Crete include raw materials such as ivory, gold, am ethyst, chalcedony, carnelian, sard, and ostrich egg shells, as well as finished products such as Egyptian stone bowls, Egyptian scarabs, and Near Eastern seals (figs. 2-4; table 1) ,35 Most, if not all, the ivory reaching Crete in the Prepalatial period is hippopotamus ivory. Hippopotami inhabited Egypt until relatively recent times and also lived in certain swampy areas of Syro Palestine.36 The source of the gold reaching Crete in the Prepalatial period is uncertain; however, it probably originated in Egypt or Nubia, where it is found in abun dance, or perhaps Syria, where there is alluvial gold.37 23Veblenl899,7l. 24 Bourdieu 1984. For a more thorough discussion of con sumption as primarily social and active, see Vehlen 1899; Ap padurai 1986; Douglas and Isherwood 1996. 25Fittsl999, 40. 261 concur with Appadurai (1986, 38 [emphasis original]), who defines luxury items as "goods whose principal use is rhe torical and social, goods that are simply incarnated signs. The necessity to which they respond is fundamentally political." 27 Helms 1988, 2-4; Earle 1990, 81. 28 Helms 1988; see also DeMarrais et al. 1996; Broodbank 2000. 29See, e.g., Webb 1975,179-80. 30 Using numerous ethnographic examples from a wide variety of spatial and temporal contexts, Helms (1988) dem onstrates the widespread association of political elites with foreign or distant goods and information. For the Aegean, specifically the Cyclades, see Broodbank (2000, 290), who ar gues that "the practice of long-range voyaging" is a "status ac cruing activity." 31 Helms 1988, 4. 32 Helms 1988, 59. 33 Helms 1988, 9-10. The consumption of raw materials through local crafting could also play an important symbol ic role in the creation and negotiation of social boundaries (Helms 1988, 1993; DeMarrais et al. 1996, 16; Burns 1999, 115). 34 DeMarrais et al. 1996. 35 Only imports found in secure Prepalatial contexts are dis cussed here, unless indicated otherwise. 36 Krzyszkowska 1988, 227-29, pis. 24-30; Reese 1998, 140-42. 37Higgins 1980, 9-10. There are also gold sources in the northeast Aegean and in the Balkans. It is notable, however, that the Greek word for gold, chrysos, which occurs as early as the Minoan period, is of Semitic derivation. Regarding sourc es of gold and goldworking in the Bronze Age Aegean, see ar ticles in Betancourt 1983. Copper and tin were also imported to Crete during the Prepalatial period, although their distri bution is much wider than that of gold.

Map of Crete, showing sites where Eastern imports have been found in secure Prepalatial contexts. There are several sources for amethyst in Egypt, such as in the Western Desert, which was exploited starting in Old Kingdom times.38 Chalcedony occurs in Egypt as well, where it was used to make beads, pendants, and scarabs from the Predynastic period. It was also used in the Near East in the late prehistoric period. According to a text from Mari, the source for pappardill?, which is sometimes translated as chalcedony, was located in northeast Iraq.39 Carnelian is found in the Eastern Des ert of Egypt and Nubia and was exploited as early as the Predynastic period.40 Numerous carnelian beads and seals were found in Mesopotamia. The barrel shape of some of these beads and seals suggests that the original source for the Mesopotamian examples was India, as similar beads were discovered near the Indian source.41 However, Near Eastern sources of carnelian have been found in Iran, western Arabia, Oman, and Anatolia, and small pebbles of carnelian are fairly common in alluvial deposits, so the exact source of simple carne lian beads is difficult to pinpoint.42 Sard, a red-brown variety of chalcedony, was available in the Eastern Des ert in Egypt, where it was exploited in the Predynastic period.43 Finally, Ostrich eggshells were valued in both Egypt and Mesopotamia. In Egypt, the shells were used to make beads, pendants, and vessels.44 In Mesopota mia, ostrich eggs, ostrich egg vessels, and imitations of ostrich egg vessels in precious metals were found at sites such as the Royal Cemetery of Ur.45 In prehistoric Fig. 3.

There are no known sources of amethyst in Mesopotamia, although it was used for beads and pendants from the fourth millennium B.C.E. onward. Moorey (1994, 94) suggests that Near Eastern sources likely exist, perhaps within the highlands of Anatolia or Iran; see also Higgins 1980,36. 39Moorey 1994, 96 (with references); see also Lucas and Harris 1962,392; Andrews 1990,41. 40 Andrews 1990,41. 41Colloril990, 35 42Moorey 1994,97-8 (with references); see also Lucas and Harris 1962,391. 43Lucas and Harris 1962,391-92; Higgins 1980,37; Andrews 1990,50; Moorey 1994,96.

They moved into the Saudi peninsula and Syria around the late fourth millennium B.C.E.46 Turning to finished products, there is debate over when the majority of Egyptian stone vessels first reached Crete, since most were found in contexts postdating their date of creation by several hundred years. Even in Egypt, stone vessels were often saved as heirlooms or reused at later dates. However, fragments of two Egyp tian stone bowls were found in secure Prepalatial con texts in Crete.47 Four Egyptian scarabs have also been found in secure Prepalatial contexts in Crete at Lebena, Archanes (Phourni), and Gournes. Typologically, they date no earlier than the very late Old Kingdom or First Intermediate period in Egypt, which coincides roughly with Middle Minoan (MM) IA.48 A Near Eastern silver tube seal was found in secure Prepalatial contexts in the cemetery at Mochlos, while a Near Eastern lapis lazuli cylinder seal was found at Archanes (Phourni). However, the date of deposition of the lapis lazuli seal is contested and may be as late as the Protopalatial period.49 It is also likely that objects made of faience (e.g., a bowl and beads from Mochlos)50 and pendants or beads decorated with granulation51 were initially im ported as finished products to Crete. However, it ap pears that the technologies for producing faience and granulation, which may have had ideological value in Minoan society because of their association with East ern centers, were soon imitated and mastered by Cre tan craftsmen.52 It is also notable that several types of exotic objects such as foot amulets, Egyptian scarabs, and Egyptian stone vessels were imitated by Cretan craftsmen during the Prepalatial period, as was exotic iconography, including ape and lion imagery.53 Most Eastern imports to Prepalatial Crete appear rather suddenly in EM II (fig. 5) ,54 yet their importance has been downplayed in studies of social and political organization on the island. Wilson states that "Near 46 Laufer 1926; Finet 1982, 69-77; Phillips 1991, 181-83; Hansen 1998, 70-2. 47Warren 1969,110,182; 1972, 394, no. 3; 1980,493; 1981, 630, 633-35, figs. 3,5, pl. 205b; Phillips 1991, 35,496, cat. no. 116.

By this time, Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Syria were major centers of faience production (Foster 1979, 27). According to Peltenburg, these early examples, which are beads in the form of discs, are typologically iden tical to contemporary examples from Cyprus, the adjacent mainland, Egypt, and Asia Minor, and they should be consid ered imports because they fail to exhibit local production cri teria such as diversity and frequency of product (Peltenburg 1995,39). 51 The only examples of granulation found in Prepalatial contexts in Crete come from Tholos B at Koumasa, which dates from EM I to MM IA. The examples include a gold animal pendant, possibly a lion, the mane represented by granules, and a small gold pierced disc with granulation work around the hole (Xanthoudides 1924/1971, 29, nos. 386, 388). Since these are unique in Prepalatial Crete, it is likely that they were imported. However, if made locally, the technology for the difficult process would have been imported from the Near East. Notably, granulation is not found in Egypt until the 12th Dynasty, more than half a millennium later than its first ap pearance in Mesopotamia?more-or-less contemporary with MM IA (Andrews 1990,88). For the spread of the granulation technique throughout the Near East, Egypt, and the Aegean, see Wolters 1983, 68-73. For a detailed discussion of granula tion as a prestige technology, see Politis 2001. 52Knappett's analysis (1999,101-29) of the adoption of the fast potter's wheel shows the ideological significance of im porting a foreign technology to Crete from the Near East; see also Schoep 2006,52-4. 53 Warren 1969 (stone vessels); Branigan 1970 (foot amu lets); Yule 1981, 128-29 (lion imagery); Crowley 1989, 298 (lion imagery); Phillips 1991 (scarabs, ape imagery); Vander vondelen 1994 (ape imagery). 54 This, coupled with the complete lack of imports in secure EM I contexts, suggests that Eastern imports began to arrive on the island in EM II, rather than having been kept as heir looms from an earlier period.</page><page sequence="7">2008] EASTERN IMPORTS IN PREPALATIAL CRETE 209 V u U .s x H G O 3 u &lt;/3 ?

The first appearance of Eastern imports in Crete. Dotted lines indicate the terminus post quem for the imports. Solid lines indicate that the items were found in contexts dating to these periods. Eastern imports are so rare that for the moment they are better viewed as exotic oddities rather than as evi dence for even the most sporadic eastern contacts," and Branigan suggests that "the quantity of inorganic objects of trade surviving to us is so small as to be of little significance."55 One could argue, to the contrary, that the relative rarity of Eastern imports in Prepala tial Crete or, perhaps more accurately, the limited ac cess to such imports supports their identification as emblems of elite identity because prestige items are defined by their novelty and their relative inaccessi bility.56 Further, imported raw materials such as gold, ivory, and semiprecious stones are often overlooked in studies of Eastern imports to Crete, yet their inclusion increases the quantity of imports dramatically. The archaeological context of imports to Prepalatial Crete provides further evidence of their role as em blems in the negotiation of social boundaries. First, imported objects and materials often appear in clusters.

For example, Tomb I/II/II at Mochlos contained (1) gold jewelry, including beads, diadems, bands, hoops, small leaf-shaped pendants, leaves from sprays, and double-link chains; (2) ivory objects, including inlay strips and seals, one of which incorporates imported ape iconography; (3) carnelian beads; (4) amethyst beads; and (5) a Syrian seal made of silver (see fig. 4) .58 In other words, almost all the types of imported objects, materials, and iconography imported to Crete from the Near East and Egypt during the Prepalatial period are represented in this single tomb, suggesting that the occupants of this tomb exercised considerable 55Branigan 1988,180; Wilson 1994,43.

Similarly, Tombs 1Y/V/VI and XIX at Mochlos contained several varieties of exotica.59 Clusters of exotic imports were also found in Prepala tial contexts at the cemetery at Archanes-Phourni, nine miles inland from Knossos (table 3) ;60 in Tholos Tomb 59Seager 1912,40-56, 70-4; Soles 1992,51-62, 64-77. 60 For a recent overview of the excavations of Archanes, see Sakellarakis and Sapouna-Sakellaraki 1997. For Tholos Tomb T, see Papadatos 2005. For Tholos Tomb E, see Panagiotopou los 2002. The chronology of Burial Building 5 at Archanes, which contained a Near Eastern lapis lazuli cylinder seal, is contested. The excavators dated the tomb to the end of the Prepalatial period, but other scholars, including Watrous (2001, 208 n. 411), argue that the tomb contained Protopala tial pottery as well. Based on the Minoan designs on the Near Eastern seal, a late Prepalatial date is more likely for its recarv ingon Crete (e.g.,Yule 1981, pi. 12, motif 19[6, 7]), although it may have been deposited in the tomb at a later date.

This is the case at Mochlos, where two of the three tombs in which exotica were ubiquitous (Tombs I/II/III and IV/V/VI) are substantially larg er and better built than the rest of the tombs on the island.63 Furthermore, they are located on the more prominent west terrace, which commands views of the sea and the mainland of Crete.64 The west terrace tombs are also more visible from the mainland than are the tombs on the south slope below; Soles has dem onstrated that the west terrace tombs consist of three compartments, each with walls built entirely of stone, whereas most of the walls of the south slope tombs consist of mudbrick on stone socles. The west terrace tombs also incorporate large colored orthostat stone slabs of gray-blue limestone with white chlorite veins, green schist, and purple schist.65 Although all these stones were available locally, it seems clear that extra care, work, and resources went into the construction of these tombs relative to those along the south slope. Adding to the monumentality of Tomb 1Y/V/VI is the forecourt, where funerary rituals or ceremonies may have taken place. This area incorporates a paved court and open-air altar and, like the west terrace tombs themselves, includes a variety of colored stones in its construction.66 The association of imports with ritual objects pro vides additional evidence for the use of exotic imports as emblems by an emergent elite in Prepalatial Crete. For example, inside Funerary Building 19 at Archanes, imported ivory seals and pendants, as well as other pieces of jewelry, were found among a group of skulls placed on and around an altar.67 As noted by Maggi dis, who recently published on this tomb, these objects were retained with the skulls during secondary burial, rather than being looted, swept aside, or discarded, which often occurred. This suggests that these objects may have been used as emblems or identity markers.68 The presence of liquid and food offerings and an anthropomorphic clay figurine on or near the altar further supports the elevated status of the individu als associated with the tomb.69 In the case of ostrich 61 For Koumasa, see Xanthoudides 1924/1971, 3-50. 62Alexiou and Warren 2004. 63 Soles 1988,50-1; see also Soles 2005,438. 64Soles 1988,50-1; 2005,438. 65 Soles 1988,50-1; 2005,438; see also Soles 1992,42-62. 66 Soles 1992,56-7. 67Maggidisl998,94-5. 68Maggidisl998,93. 69Maggidisl998,95.</page><page sequence="11">2008] EASTERN IMPORTS IN PREPALATIAL CRETE 213 I I I $ i s I III d2S ^3 Si Si 1 1 Si I I I I I I I 3 1 S i i i i g g o Ph i QJ g 03 43 u 03 X g o u 15 \g 15 , Oh Oh U g u &lt;U g g o o Z bo I g g pq g pp s3 i i i i i i i i i 3 1 1 S i i i i i i i i i 3 2 i i w S 3 3 i i i i i i i ? 15 hh 3 ^3 1 s| si w S w S 3 s ?.1 I I I I I I I I I 03 40 03 H 42 S o H 'S 43 H I 8</page><page sequence="12">214 CYNTHIA S.

For example, diadems made of hammered gold, often with repousse dots defining the circumference and punched holes at each end for fastening around the head, were found in Crete, Mesopotamia, and the Troad.72 Gold flow ers and leaves, perhaps used as hair ornaments or attached to the diadems, as well as beaded jewelry of gold, faience, and semiprecious stones, were discovered in Prepalatial Crete and Mesopotamia.73 Finally, it is possible that ostrich eggshells from Crete were made into rhyta imitating similar vessels from Mesopotamia, which were sometimes copied in gold and other pre cious materials.74 The association of these objects with a distant, and in some cases more established, elite might have augmented their meaning and value as prestige goods and symbols of authority in local Cre tan society while allowing the newly emergent Cretan elite to compete with or at least emulate elite groups beyond their realm. USE AND DISPLAY OF EXOTIC IMPORTS IN PREPALATIAL CRETE The fact that most of the exotic objects from Pre palatial Crete were found in funerary contexts in no way negates their potency as emblems of elite iden tity.75 Just as material culture can be used to negoti ate and manipulate social identities in other aspects of daily life, burials and the rituals that accompany them can throw light on social dimensions such as power struggles, class, and ideology.76 One might ar gue that funerary offerings differ because they were probably not seen after the actual burial ritual was completed. However, ancient funerary rituals or cer emonies (such as those that perhaps took place in the paved courts fronting Prepalatial tombs at Mochlos, Koumasa, and Archanes) were likely powerful public events that would have had a profound impact on the participants and spectators involved77?the perfor mances and objects that accompany ceremonies such 70Sakellarakis 1990, 289-90, 295, fig. 23. Also worth men tioning is a suggestion by Rehak that Aegean natives believed that imported ostrich eggs were laid by griffins. This sugges tion is based primarily on the fact that "griffins can be shown leashed like pets, they occur as both male and female animals, and they reproduce babies, evidently from eggs" (Rehak 1994, 83n.31). 71 Evans 1921,171. 72McCalluml983. 73McCallum (1983) also notes that in spite of these similari ties in form, the techniques of manufacture were quite differ ent. The workmanship of the pieces from Mesopotamia and the Troad is very complex, incorporating hammering, cast ing, repousse, wireworking, filigree, granulation, and inlay, whereas the techniques used in the earliest goldwork from Crete is far simpler, consisting only of hammering, repousse, and wireworking (McCallum 1983, 21). 74 A true ostrich egg vessel, an imitation in silver, and an other in gold with lapis lazuli, red limestone, and shell decora tion on the upper portion were found in a single tomb dating to Early Dynastic IIIA in the Royal Cemetery of Ur (Hansen 1998, 70-1). 75 The relative scarcity of exotica from Prepalatial settle ment contexts is due, primarily, to the fact that few Prepala tial settlements have been thoroughly excavated because they were generally built over during subsequent periods. Further more, because of the value assigned to imported objects, they are rarely left behind or discarded in settlements. 76Brown 1971,1-2; Morris 1992,2.

This suggests that they were used during the lifetimes of their owners, since, according to ethno graphic parallels, body ornaments are more often the personal property of the deceased rather than funer ary gifts.79 Both physical and iconographical evidence seems to confirm this view.80 In the past, it has been suggested that the gold diadems found at Mochlos and other sites, which some recognize as symbols of author ity based on contemporary parallels from the Near East, show evidence of wear.81 This is corroborated by Hickman's analysis of the Mochlos gold, which revealed evidence of use and repair on much of the jewelry.82 For example, attachments were repeatedly added to the "eye diadem" from Compartment II of Tomb 1/ 11/III. Similarly, antennae were torn off the top of a diadem decorated with animals in dot repousse, which shows evidence of repair on its right side;83 and a gold drum bead from Compartment I of Tomb I/II/III shows evidence of wear at the edges.84 The discovery of a gold diadem in 1971 among a hoard of jewelry found in a silver vessel associated with Tomb 1Y/V/VI at Mochlos provides further evidence that these diadems were used before being deposited in tombs (fig. 7). This diadem has a piece cut away at the bottom. According to Davaras, "people?not just common grave-robbers but perhaps relatives of the dead?may have thought it excessively wasteful to consign the whole jewel to the tomb, and preferred to diminish the quantity of gold buried by cutting or wrenching off parts of it."85 The antennae attach ments for this diadem were also removed and then buried with the rest of the diadem. Neither of these acts makes any sense if the diadem had been made explicitly for funerary use. An ivory seal from Com partment II of Tomb I/II/III at Mochlos also shows signs of wear and repair (fig. 8).86 This suggests that Although the size of these courts would likely limit access, this potential hierarchy of space could also be significant in estab lishing social boundaries and influencing social memory. 78Connerton 1989; see also Day et al. 1998,140. The word "manipulate" is used deliberately here, as one must keep in mind that such performances and their accoutrements are not always a direct reflection of reality but rather the projec tion of an ideal. 79Pader 1982,58; Marcus 1996,45. 80Seager 1912, 27; Higgins 1980,54; Branigan 1988,170. 81 Seager 1912,27; see also Higgins 1980,54. 82Hickman 2004. 83 Seager 1912, 26-7 (II.5 and II.4, respectively). 84Seager 1912, 22 (I.m).

Iconography on later frescoes provides further sup port for the use of exotic imports as adornment for the body while their owners were still alive. This evidence is somewhat more speculative because all the depictions come from later periods; but it should not be omitted, especially in view of the lack of contemporary icono graphical evidence. Images give us some idea of what Connerton calls "embodied practices," performances that are dependent on the action of an individual body and, therefore, have spatial and temporal limitations.87 Such depictions are abundant on Crete, Thera, and in Thebes, Egypt. There are several examples of diadems or bands worn around the head, as seen on acrobats from the bull-leaping frescoes from Knossos. Cretans who are depicted in Theban tombs in Egypt also wear diadems with decorative antennae that are similar to those on Prepalatial examples (fig. 9).88 Other types of exotic imports adorn individuals in depictions from Knossos: the women depicted in the "Ladies in Blue" fresco wear several beaded necklaces and bracelets, some with beads in the form of lilies or other types of flowers (fig. 10). The beads are either blue, which may represent silver or faience, or red, perhaps represent ing carnelian or sard.89 Finally, in the frescoes from Akrotiri on Thera, several figures wear jewelry made of exotic materials: gold and silver necklaces, bracelets, armlets, and earrings, as well as necklaces and brace lets with beads that are also often blue or red.90 One of the saffron gatherers from Xeste 3 wears a string of red beads around her neck and a gold band or dia dem around her head with red beads attached to it (fig. 11).

Notably, most of these people seem to be involved in some kind of ritual or activity that is closely associated with the palatial administrative or religious centers of Crete or Thera, such as bull-leaping at Knossos, dip lomatic ceremonies in Thebes, and what appears to be a rite of passage ceremony in the Xeste 3 frescoes from Akrotiri.92 EXOTICA AND THE BODY: ADORNING POWER IN PREPALATIAL CRETE Recent research contends that the body is not a fixed, biological entity but rather is culturally vari able?a "social metaphor."93 I argue here that the human body can also be viewed as a dynamic canvas that conveys social identity. Bodies can simultaneously create and negate or obliterate boundaries, as well as communicate across them, demonstrating the com plexity and plurality of the body and its capacity for overlapping identities.94 Therefore, the body and how it is presented can be used to negotiate a multiplicity of disparate identities in social contexts.95 As the body is dynamic, performative, and highly visible, it can be a more powerful and convincing form of language than, for example, verbal communication. However, just as the body can reveal information about a person or group within a society, it can also be manipulated 91Seager 1912,48, fig. 20 (IV.7). 92 In the examples from Akrotiri, females are shown at vari ous stages of development, some collecting crocuses for a goddesslike figure. Marinatos (2003, 205-11) has suggested that the crocuses were used for their medicinal value in allevi ating menstrual cramps. 93 Regarding the cultural meaning of the body as symbol, artifact, medium, or metaphor, see Montserrat 1998; Hamila kis et al. 2002. For a recent overview of theoretical approaches to the body, particularly the body as a site of lived experience, see Joyce 2005. 94 Montserrat 1998,1-2. 95 Fisher and Loren 2003, 225-26.</page><page sequence="16">218 CYNTHIA S. COLBURN [AJA 112 Fig. 10. "Ladies in Blue" fresco, Knossos (? Ashmolean Museum, Oxford). to conceal certain facts or exaggerate others. Indeed, representations of the body are often more indicative of discourse regarding identity construction than of actual lived experience.96 To build an understanding of identity through an cient embodied practice, one must rely heavily on the remains of material culture. Although there are several ways in which the body can communicate identity, I focus primarily on dress or adornment.97 In societ ies throughout space and time, personal adornment such as jewelry and clothing expresses differences or communicates across such boundaries as age, gender, wealth, and social status. According to Warwick and Ca vallaro, who emphasize the paradox of dress both as a margin and a boundary, "the language of clothes and bodily adornment generally experiments relentlessly with ways of defining and redefining the boundaries between self and other, subject and object, inside and outside."98 Thus, beyond the aesthetic response that adornment can evoke, it serves a key social function in a dynamic system of communication within societies.99 For adornment to be effective in communicating sta tus, the objects or materials must be relatively rare or difficult to obtain, since it is rarity that prompts social admiration.100 Thus, the use of exotic objects, materials, and production techniques as adornment of the body in Prepalatial Crete was a powerful way to convey social status. Since long-distance overseas travel was necessary to procure these imports, their accessibility was limited to people with economic resources, a high level of orga 96Fisher and Loren 2003, 227; see also Loren 2001. 97 Others include gesture and posture. 98 Warwick and Cavallaro 1998, xviii. "See Cordwell and Schwarz 1979; Roach and Bubolz Eich er 1979,8; Schwarz 1979,29. 100Roach and Bubolz Eicher 1979, 8-10. Meskell (1998, 141) has argued that focusing on notions of control or pow er ignores the individual and is, in essence, androcentric: "Archaeology has been seduced by Foucauldian notions of control, where power relations are mapped on the body as a surface which can be analyzed as a forum for display.. .. All this mapping and elaborated treatment of the body may reflect the post-modern predilection for surface, but it still represents a separation from our bodies and our identities as individuals." I suggest, however, that in the case of Prepalatial Crete, the focus on power is justifiable since social status or power is highly relevant during this transitional period pre ceding the construction of centralized administrative centers on Crete. Furthermore, the study of individual identities or bodies is problematic for Prepalatial Crete because we have no textual evidence to accompany the archaeological re mains. Although I agree with Meskell (1998,141 [emphasis original]) that the "reclamation of individual bodies" is criti cal for archaeology, I also recognize the difficulties inherent in this approach for the prehistoric period. In the two ex amples Meskell provides to show how archaeologists can ac</page><page sequence="17">2008] EASTERN IMPORTS IN PREPALATIAL CRETE 219 Fig. 11.

As a result, the elite could maintain a monopoly on these symbols to differentiate themselves from the wider social group while forging ties with Eastern rulers.101 Social status is defined very broadly here to mean one's social worth. Thus, adornment may be used to indicate prestige on many levels?wealth, political pow er, or religious power. In the case of religious power, adornment may protect a priest or priestess in an en counter with the supernatural world, it may prepare one to act as celebrant of a religious rite, or it may be a means to assume the power of the supernatural.102 Many of the figures in later Minoan iconography who are adorned with exotic imports appear to be acting in some kind of ritual or sacred context. Such religious roles may have been a crucial element in the identities of the emergent elite in Prepalatial Crete as well. CONCLUSION Exotic materials can be interpreted as evidence of social ranking because of the economic resources and level of organization needed to obtain them, as well as their symbolic significance due to their origin in distant lands. This appears to have been the case in Prepalatial Crete, where such imports were relatively rare and found in clusters, sometimes in more promi nent tombs or with ritual objects. Although most of the extant imports to Prepalatial Crete were found in mortuary contexts, there is often clear evidence of wear and, in some cases, repair, meaning that the im ports were used before being consigned to the tomb. Similar types of objects are depicted in Minoan iconog raphy from later periods, which supports the view that exotic imports, most of which took the form of jewelry or seals, were not created only as funerary offerings but were used before being deposited in tombs.103 As adornment of the body, they were highly visible and therefore would have been extremely effective in com municating identity. Moreover, they may have taken on a performative aspect, especially during ceremo nies or rituals. Such public events and the objects and costumes accompanying them can exert a profound cess individuals in the past, the individuals discussed were named and accompanied by written histories (Meskell 1998, 155-57). 101 Roach and Bubolz Eicher 1979,12. 102Roach and Bubolz Eicher 1979,18. 103Seager 1912, 34 (11.41); Higgins 1980, 54.</page><page sequence="18">220 CYNTHIA S. COLBURN [AJA 112 influence on social memory and were likely used by an emergent elite to establish boundaries between themselves and the wider local population of Prepal atial Crete while simultaneously forging provocative and powerful connections with Eastern elites.104 Thus, the theories of indigenous evolution and exogenous influence regarding the rise of a palatial civilization in Crete need not be mutually exclusive. The relatively limited number of exotic imports in Prepalatial Crete has caused them to be overlooked in studies of social and political organization on the island. It has been argued instead that prestige items are defined by their novelty and relative inaccessibility. One point not yet mentioned, however, is the propen sity of such prestige items to inspire imitation.105 The fact that Early Minoan craftsmen imitated some types of exotica, such as Egyptian scarabs, Egyptian stone bowls, and borrowed ape iconography, suggests that a model of competitive emulation was at work.106 It is also notable that some types of Eastern imports or imi tations thereof that were prevalent in the Prepalatial period, such as ivory, gold, and Egyptian stone vases, became less prominent in the subsequent Old Palace period. This fits within the model of competitive emu lation as well: once exotic objects become more readily available, they lose their role as symbols of elite iden tity. Luxury status is not essential to individual objects or types of objects; the concept of luxury is instead created through a "social process" whereby the value of material goods is dependent on their "relative inac cessibility."107 Applying this to Crete, the virtual disap pearance in the Old Palace period of certain types of exotic objects that were prominent in the Prepalatial period suggests the need for innovative and perhaps more prominent symbols of power in the subsequent Old Palace period. Rather than focusing on acquiring small, easily transportable exotica from the Near East and Egypt, the more established elite began to chan nel their energy into the built environment, specifically the construction of palatial or administrative centers throughout the island.
