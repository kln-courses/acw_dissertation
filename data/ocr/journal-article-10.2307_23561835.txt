<plain_text><page sequence="1">To Tell the Truth: Will the Real Public Theology Please Stand Up? E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. Abstract Public theology has been praised for being in keeping with the best of the Christian theological tradition and denounced as a distortion of the church's true calling. However, it is not clear that public theology's ad vocates and critics always refer to the same thing. In this paper I seek to clarify and refine the conversation by comparing and contrasting descriptions of pub lic theology with other related terms, describing three main types of public the ology literature and two main areas of concern they address, proposing a defini tion of public theology based on a consensus within the field, oudining four basic critiques, and suggesting some implications for the continuing discussion of public theology. Introduction Public theology is one of the most important and lively topics in Christian theo logical ethics today.1 The ongoing debate about it deals with fundamental issues that go to the heart of theology and ethics: questions concerning their sources, purposes, and goals; the intended persons and groups to whom theological eth ics has been and should be addressed; and the relationships between churches, institutions, and individuals and the larger societies in which they live, work, and worship.2 Public theology has been praised for being in keeping with the best of the Christian theological tradition and denounced as an unfaithful dis tortion of the church's true calling.3 Although public theology is a relatively new term, in recent years the topic has received substantial attention in the fields of Christian theology and ethics.4 Within academic circles it has been the subject of professional conferences, aca demic programs, and doctoral dissertations.5 Since its entry into the vocabulary of theology, ethics, and church history, use of the term has extended into Journal of the Society of Christian Ethics, 23,2 f.2003i: 55-96</page><page sequence="2">56 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. discussions of areas such as politics, law, human rights, economics, science, the environment, rhetoric, and sociology,6 and has appeared in contexts as diverse as press releases, denominational materials, the popular press, and the floor of the U.S. Senate.7 Many writers have noted the variety of definitions that exist for public theol ogy.8 While the precise meaning of the term within the field of theological eth ics is itself a topic of debate, the situation is further complicated by references to public theology in other disciplines and contexts as well as by the range of ex plicit and implicit understandings of public theology held by those who write about it. Overlapping, conflicting, and contradictory descriptions clutter the discussion. Although more than a few, both inside and outside the church, ob ject to the whole notion of public theology, the term is now widely used within the field of theological ethics. Still, many are unaware of or unclear about the term's origin and meaning, the body of works to which it refers, and the range of forms, contents, methods, and goals associated with public theology. This is in part due to the variety of approaches to public theology pursued within the field of Christian theological ethics and outside it, as well as the different em phases placed upon public theology within the literature devoted to it. In short, the more I read about public theology, the less clear I am that everyone engaged in discussion and debate about it is talking about the same thing.9 In this paper, then, I intend to call attention to some of the consensus and confusion within the literature of public theology, regarding matters of definition and scope. In so doing, I hope to clear the field to some extent by approaching the topic from a different perspective, and thereby refine, encourage, and further continued discussion of the topic. Origins and Development of the Term In part, the variety of ways in which those interested in public theology under stand and approach it is a consequence of the different contexts in which the term arose and developed. It originated in discussions about civil religion10 and its role in the United States that began in 1967 with sociologist Robert Bellah's seminal work on American civil religion.11 The civil religion to which Bellah and others referred consists of a basic and minimal set of religious beliefs and values, shared to some extent by most members of society, or as Donald Jones describes it, "a common public religion in society, different from and tran scending particular faiths."12 In subsequent conversations, church historian Martin Marty coined the terms "public theologian" and "public theology" to distinguish his interpretations of persons and features within the Christian tra dition in the United States from understandings of civil religion held by Bellah and others.13</page><page sequence="3">To Tell the Truth • 57 Soon after its first use by Marty, Bellah accepted the term public theology as a friendly amendment to his civil religion thesis and incorporated it into his own work.14 Shortly thereafter, theological ethicist David Hollenbach called for "the formulation of a public theology which attempts to illuminate the ur gent moral questions of our time through explicit use of the great symbols and doctrines of the Christian faith."15 Theologian David Tracy then made his own significant contributions to public theology, particularly in his discussion of the three publics or "social realities," to which, he argued, theology is and ought to be addressed: "the wider society, the academy, and the church."16 Those con versant with the ongoing discussions about civil religion and public theology are often familiar with the pivotal roles played by Bellah, Marty, Hollenbach, and Tracy in the development of the terms and frequently acknowledge the contributions they made to the field.17 Indeed, works by Marty, Hollenbach, and Tracy often inform the understandings and assumptions others have about public theology and frame their discussions of it.18 Largely as a result of conversations spawned by debates over civil religion, older terminologies were revived (such as public philosophy19 and public re ligion20) and new ones devised (such as public church21) in attempts to demar cate more precisely the various fields of study and to clarify the issues at hand. As the concept of public theology generated its own area of discussion, apart from but often overlapping the waxing and waning civil religion debate, other terms and rubrics were soon brought into the conversation, including political theology,22 public discourse,23 public ethics,24 public intellectual,25 and social ethics.26 To greater and lesser extents, public theology shares certain characteristics with each of these, depending in large measure on how a writer understands the other terms and concepts and the relationships among them, as well as the aca demic and ecclesiastical perspective from which he or she approaches them. Also, partly as a result of various comprehensions of these concepts and catego ries, different advocates and opponents of public theology perceive it to be more closely aligned with one or another of the terms. However, while each of these is related to public theology, a consensus exists within the literature de voted to public theology, written by those who are not explicitly opposed to it, that none of the other terms or the fields they describe is completely synony mous with public theology. Comparison and Contrast with Other Terms and Concepts Civil religion has been characterized in numerous ways and is itself the focus of an extensive body of works.27 Although Martin Marty sought to distinguish public theology from civil religion, he has nevertheless at times defined public</page><page sequence="4">58 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. theology in ways that are strikingly similar to descriptions of civil religion. Con sider, for example, these descriptions by Bellah and Marty: By civil religion I refer to that religious dimension, found I think in the life of every people, through which it interprets its historical experience in the light of transcendent reality.28 Public theology is in my view an effort to interpret the life of a people in the light of a transcendent reference.29 Given the similarity of these descriptions, it is perhaps no wonder the two terms are sometimes confused and the concepts or realities to which they point collapsed into a unitary notion. However, many see clear distinctions between civil religion and public theology, and examination of literature devoted to these and other terms supports the following observations. Both civil religion30 and public theology are concerned with the relationship between, on the one hand, political authority, government, and society, and, on the other hand, God, the gods, or that which is perceived by a people to be sa cred and holy.31 However, while civil religion emphasizes the public life and so cial responsibilities—the national life—of a people,32 public theology is also concerned with, among other things, the relationship of individual believers to the civil government.33 Whereas civil religion begins with the nation and its people and discerns the conception of God held by them, public theology moves from religious faith and practice to considerations of their import for the broader society.34 In addition, public theology is often but not consistently un derstood to approach these and other issues from the perspective of specific re ligious communities and traditions as well as the individual religious believers who comprise them.35 Thus, public theology deals with the public import and explication of theological concepts, vis-à-vis the larger society, in ways civil reli gion does not,36 in part because civil religion is distinct from particular faith traditions37 upon which public theology is based and out of which it develops.38 Moreover, as Steve Goldzwig argues, civil religion and public theology often differ in their rhetoric and the intended goals of their respective discourses.39 Public religion shares certain attributes with public theology, one of which is confusion about the meanings of the terms. On this point, Richard John Neuhaus's comment that the "idea of public religion is the subject of great pub lic confusion" applies just as well to public theology.40 As with other terms con sidered here, public religion is variously understood and defined.41 Although some describe public religion in language that is often associated with public theology,42 as Donald Jones argues, the reality or concept to which public reli gion refers is generally understood to be more closely associated with civil reli gion.43 Public religion, along with civil religion but in contrast to public theol ogy, is closely associated with the civil government44 and is so to such an extent</page><page sequence="5">To Tell the Truth • 59 that governmental leaders are often the most visible and important bearers of a nation's public or civil religion.45 Indeed, public religion is sometimes under stood to be functionally equivalent to a state religion or religion supported by the civil authorities, and, as J. F. Maclear has shown, the notion of a civil or public religion "distinct from particular denominations" was the topic of specu lation by Isaac Watts even before Jean-Jacques Rousseau wrote about civil reli gion in his Social Contract,46 While public theology entails theological reflection and has connections to particular faith traditions,47 public religion has had both its religious and its secular proponents,48 has been imprecise and noncommittal with respect to deity, and has tried to present a commonly shared, unitary, con sensus faith.49 Public theology is often critical of governmental policies or the state in ways that some forms of public and civil religion are not.50 Similarly, public theology's goals, as well as its form and content, are not simply the same as those of public or civil religion.51 The correspondence between civil religion and public religion has been recently evidenced in articles (such as "The Civil Religion Goes to War" and "A Revival of Public Religion—On Capitol Hill") that address religious aspects of public responses to the September 11, 2001, terrorist attacks on the United States.52 Political theology53 and public theology are both concerned with the church and politics along with what is perceived to be an increasing irrelevance of theol ogy with respect to the larger culture.54 Yet in contrast to political theology, public theology is not exclusively or primarily concerned with politics and polit ical institutions and the relationship of Christian believers and churches to them,55 with the rights of persons and groups within a body politic,56 or with theology's marginal place within contemporary public discourse.57 Public theol ogy's methods of argumentation and intended audience also differ from those of political theology, as Linell Cady notes.58 While some advocate a public theol ogy closely aligned with and focused on the political arena, others propose a more expanded notion of the areas of life to which public theology should at tend. For example, while John Bolt stresses the importance of the political arena for public theology,59 Max Stackhouse, who has described political theology as public theology's "closest relative," nevertheless maintains that there is a funda mental distinction between the two60 and argues that public theologians should address multiple "publics": religious, academic, political, and economic.61 While both the public church62 and public theology are concerned with ways in which Christian faith is related to public affairs and the common good,63 the term public church pertains to particular churches, traditions, de nominations, or clusters of these,64 or to communities of believers,65 not pri marily to their theologies and ethics that address institutions, issues, events, and practices of public concern within the broader culture.66 Although the public church, variously described, carries out a public theology,67 the two are not the same.68 Also, while public churches often articulate public theologies, public</page><page sequence="6">60 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. theologies are not always produced by public churches.69 For instance, discus sions about what constitutes public theology or who is an exemplary public theologian have been conducted largely within the academic community, not within the church.70 Public intellectuals and public theologians frequently share similar concerns. Yet while some writers understand public theologians to be a subset of a larger group (i.e., public intellectuals),71 others perceive public intellectuals and public theologians as having very different goals, so much so that the two groups are viewed as being at odds with or antithetical to each other.72 In any case, even if public theologians are seen as one type of public intellectual, the two are not synonymous. Although public intellectuals intend to have an impact on the larger society, their work is carried out by "intellectuals." In contrast, while public theology is often conducted by and addressed to intellectuals and other elites, its creators and intended audiences are by no means limited to this group.73 Significandy, many forms of public theology are produced by mem bers of the laity and the clergy, who may or may not be classified as "intellectu als" in an academic sense.74 In addition, public intellectuals have no necessary connection with theology or religion—indeed they may be opposed to expres sions of both in the public realm as unwarranted and dangerous intrusions.75 Similarly, to greater and lesser extents public theology is intentionally and ex plicitly theological, or at least claims to be. While the discourse of public intel lectuals may be theological, for the most part presently it is not. Public philosophy and public theology share certain similarities, but public theology relies on and stresses the public significance of particular religious texts, beliefs, communities, practices, traditions, and influences in ways public philosophy does not.76 Such dependence on religion distinguishes public theol ogy from public philosophy.77 Public philosophy also tends to focus primarily and more narrowly on political aspects of a society—on ways in which civil insti tutions, values, and patterns incorporate political theories and interests.78 Public theology may interact with public philosophy but, unlike the latter, public theol ogy is based in part on understandings of deity and the relationship of that deity to human society.79 Some see similarities and overlapping areas of concern be tween public philosophy and public theology and thus view the two as mutually complementary.80 Indeed, some consider public philosophy and public theology to be essentially the same thing.81 Others, such as Robert Bellah, perceive them to be somewhat distinct but are not always clear about their differences.82 Many see John Courtney Murray's work as paradigmatic for both public philosophy and public theology,83 one of the points stressed in Robert McElroy's study of Murray's contributions to the development of American public theology.84 However, while instances of public philosophy may incorporate some aspects of theology,85 public philosophy is not necessarily theological.86</page><page sequence="7">To Tell the Truth • 61 Social ethics87 and public ethics88 generally refer to governmental, public, and social programs and policies that bear upon matters of public and social in teraction, order, and morality, as well as the obligations of persons and groups to the larger society, often phrased in terms of specific duties, values, or princi ples, such as justice, equality, fairness, and peace. When used in conjunction with the adjective "Christian," social and public ethics may also pertain to the actual or proposed actions, dispositions, principles, or policies of Christians and Christian groups within the larger societies in which they live, work, and wor ship (e.g., as members of a congregation, denomination, communion, or church universal, as citizens of a town, city, state, nation, or global community, or both). The terms public ethics and social ethics are often used in similar ways and are frequently indistinguishable and interchangeable in their usage, which predates that of public theology.89 Public and social ethics frequently take reli gious forms but do not have to; that is, there are secular forms of what is re ferred to in religious discourse as public and social ethics.90 Public theology, public ethics, and social ethics all deal with issues that are understood to be so cial and public in nature. However, public theology does so from the context of particular faith traditions and communities, in ways that are not identical with all forms of public and social ethics, although some tend to conflate the terms.91 While some public and social ethics are religious—for example, Jewish, Islamic, Hindu, or Christian social ethics—not all instances are. Some writers maintain that there are distinctions between public theology and social ethics, but the nature of the differences is often not spelled out.92 One difference between public theology and social or public ethics, as I under stand them, is indicated by the different nouns. Public theology starts with the ology and moves to ethics,93 or as Max Stackhouse claims, "a public theology will set forth the first principles of social ethics."94 Put differently, public theol ogy interprets the actions of persons and groups, as well as their social, political, economic, familial and other institutions, in light of theology. It is descriptive, evaluative, and normative with respect to the broader culture and society, as well as their institutions and interactions, in ways that social and public ethics often are not. Although each of the terms discussed above shares certain similarities with public theology, to varying degrees they all differ from it. Participants in public theology discussions, especially advocates of public theology, frequently distin guish it from these other areas, but also often characterize the nature of the dif ferences in various ways.95 However, while public theology's proponents fre quently emphasize distinctions between public theology and these related areas, others often discuss public theology in a manner that accentuates ways in which they think public theology parallels the others terms, or simply equate one or more of them, explicitly or implicitly, with public theology. For example, in his</page><page sequence="8">62 • E. Harold Breltenberg, Jr. widely used textbook Religion and Politics in the United States, political scientist Kenneth Wald claims: According to some scholars, this constant recourse to religious images and symbols in American political culture provides evidence of the existence of what has variously been called a public theology, a political religion, a reli gion of democracy, a public philosophy, or, most commonly today, a civil religion.96 At this point I hope it is apparent why I seek to clarify these terms and the concepts or realities to which they refer. If public theology is nothing more than another form of civil or public religion, whose primary or sole purpose is to give religious legitimacy, support, and sanctification to the civil government, dominant culture, or prevailing economic system—or if public theology is sim ply another name for political theology, whose main or singular goal is to di recdy influence national or international politics—then theological critiques that are valid for civil or public religion and political theology would also hold true, without qualification, for public theology. However, if public theology, civil or public religion, and political theology, as well as public philosophy and social or public ethics, properly refer to different things, as I think they do, then both supporters and critics of public theology ought to attend more closely to distinctions among these terms. How then does public theology relate to the terms associated with it, dis cussed above? As I understand it, public theology is most closely related to what is often called public or social ethics; that is, Christian public theology is more like Christian public or social ethics than it is the other areas.97 However, public theology frequendy differs from public and social ethics in its sources of insight, intended goals, audiences, and methods of argumentation.98 Some forms of public theology also diverge from public or social ethics in their interpretations of and guidance for institutions, circumstances, events, and practices of the larger society and the normative and evaluative roles they pursue with respect to religious beliefs, claims, and practices.99 Three Main Types of Public Theology Literature and Two Main Areas of Concern If it is correct to view public theology as, at least in part, a type of theology and a form of public discourse, as well as an analytical category, related to but differ ent from those of civil or public religion, political theology, public philosophy, public church, and social or public ethics, it does not necessarily follow that public theology is a unitary concept or that those engaged in conversations about it come to public theology from the same perspective or for the same pur pose. Here it is important to recall that the term arose and developed among</page><page sequence="9">To Tell the Truth • 63 those who approached public theology from related but different fields— church history, theology, and theological ethics—because these areas of study, and the concerns particular to them, are reflected in the different types of pub lic theology literature that have developed. Indeed, an examination of the litera ture devoted to public theology shows that when those who are interested in public theology write about it, they usually do so in one of three ways. That is, the literature of public theology generally falls into three types or groups. First, some of those interested in public theology describe theologians, clergy, and other figures, past and present, as public theologians, their work as public theology, or both. When they do so, such writers often define their ter minology, explaining what they understand a public theologian or public theol ogy to be.100 However, many who employ the terminology of public theology in this interpretive fashion do so with implicit and unarticulated understandings of the terminology. Those who take this path bypass descriptive and normative questions about public theologians and public theology per se. That is, they may call someone a public theologian, or label his or her work public theology, but without stating why and without indicating the criteria they use for deter mining what constitutes a public theology or an exemplary public theologian.101 Doing so, however, can introduce confusion into the larger discussion of public theology, since individual writers may make overlapping or conflicting assump tions about what comprises a public theology or what the distinguishing charac teristics are of a public theologian. Materials that focus on this interpretive, historical, and descriptive aspect of public theology identify a surprisingly wide assortment of individuals, writings, and traditions as public theologians, public theologies, or resources for public theology. In so doing, these writings, as a whole, produce some rather strange bedfellows. Those described as public theologians, as having had a public theol ogy, or as resources for constructing a contemporary public theology include not only frequently mentioned figures such as Jonathan Edwards, Abraham Kuyper, Walter Rauschenbusch, Reinhold Niebuhr, John Courtney Murray, and Martin Luther King, Jr.,102 but also Augustine, Aquinas, Immanuel Kant, Abraham Lincoln, Dorothy Day, Karl Barth, John Howard Yoder, John Mil bank, and Jerry Falwell, to name only a few.103 The extent to which some or all of those who are interpreted this way can rightly be conceived of as public theo logians depends on how a given writer understands or defines the term. For in stance, some definitions of public theologian may well disqualify from such des ignation many of those characterized as public theologians by others. At the same time, according to other notions of public theology and public theolo gian—ones that define these terms broadly—some of the best-known critics and opponents of public theology, as it is often understood, could themselves be classified as public theologians. For example, Stanley Hauerwas has written from a theological perspective on a range of issues related to the larger society,</page><page sequence="10">64 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. such as medicine, education, and war and peace.104 Does this in itself make him a public theologian? Then again, if public theology is understood to be reli gious engagement with social issues and questions of public morality, James Dobson could be characterized as a public theologian and the Veggie Tales Christian video series for children might be construed as a form of public theol ogy. Both, in fact, have been described as such.105 Perhaps the Left Behind series, The Prayer of Jahez, and the Promise Keepers organization are also forms of public theology, if public theology is understood simply to be an attempt to make the moral implications of the Christian faith available to the larger society in a publicly intelligible manner. All this depends, of course, on how broad or narrow, how strong or weak, one's notions of public theology and public theo logian are, in concert with the implicit or explicit criteria one uses for determin ing what constitutes a public theology or who is a public theologian. Such interpretive, historical, and descriptive discussions about public theo logians and public theologies comprise an important and sizable part of the public theology literature. Yet while the number of publications of this type is large, there has been little critical consideration of this literature. Both support ers and opponents of public theology, for the most part, do not appear to take into account these works or address the claims they make. For example, most of the critiques leveled against public theology focus on it as a way of doing theol ogy and ethics, without addressing the many descriptions of public theologians and public theologies that, if correct, collectively argue for a long tradition of public theology within the church. This group of literature thus raises ques tions—e.g., whether the kind of engagement, interpretation, evaluation, and guidance of the institutions and interactions of our common life that some now describe as public theology has been a significant and faithful part of the Chris tian tradition and, if so, whether this kind of endeavor can and should be carried out today—that are not adequately addressed by discussions that focus exclu sively on contemporary debates about method. A second type of works within the literature devoted to public theology is concerned with discussions about what public theology is and how it should be carried out.106 This collection of literature includes some of the best known, most influential, and most often cited works in the field, such as David Tracy's The Analogical Imagination, Ronald Thiemann's Constructing a Public Theology, Linell Cady's Religion, Theology, and American Public Life, and Robert Benne's The Paradoxical Vision, as well as numerous other works that focus on questions of definition and method related to public theology.107 A third type of public theology literature consists of constructive public the ology—theologically grounded and informed interpretations of and guidance for institutions, interactions, events, circumstances, policies, and practices, both within and outside the church. For much of the Christian tradition, these have been done by those now described, in the first type of public theology literature,</page><page sequence="11">To Tell the Truth • 65 as public theologians. That is, throughout the history of the church, persons and groups have offered interpretations of and guidance for various areas of so ciety, including but also going beyond the institutional church, in ways that co here with current descriptions of public theology. For the most part this oc curred before the term public theology was introduced. In recent years though, constructive public theology has also been produced by some who identify their efforts as public theology, describe themselves as public theologians, or are con sidered as such by others.108 That is, they understand themselves to be public theologians who do public theology or are seen that way by others.109 In light of these types of and approaches to public theology, evidenced in the literature devoted to it, it appears there are two primary areas of concern within the field. First, some of those interested in public theology address critical is sues related to the field: describing individuals as public theologians or their work as public theology (the first type discussed above) and discussing what constitutes public theology and the methods appropriate to it (the second type). These two types of public theology literature are related to each other through their common interest, implicitly and explicitly, in what public theology has been or is, what it should do, and how it should be carried out. Second, others address substantive concerns that are of interest and importance to the church and the larger societies within which Christians live, work, and worship (the third type of public theology literature). These two main areas of concern are, of course, connected with each other, since the way in which public theology is understood and the methods proposed for it are both related to ways in which it is brought to bear on substantive issues. Indeed, although much of the literature devoted to public theology falls clearly within one of the types described above, several works address more than one topic. For example, some writers combine methodological discussions with con structive proposals or appeal to what they perceive to be a history and tradition of public theology in support of their own methodological proposals.110 To gether, those who attend both to critical issues and to substantive concerns carry out what I refer to as a comprehensive public theology—as has been done, for example, by Robert Benne, Max Stackhouse, and Ronald Thiemann.111 Proposed Definition of Public Theology Despite variations in definitions and assessments of public theology, I think there is nevertheless broad agreement that public theology lies at the intersec tion of theology and ethics. Indeed, within the literature devoted to public the ology that is not explicitly opposed to it, a general consensus supports the fol lowing description.112 First, public theology is religiously informed discourse that intends to be intelligible and convincing to adherents within its own</page><page sequence="12">66 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. religious tradition while at the same time being comprehensible and possibly persuasive to those outside it.113 Second, public theology addresses issues that bear upon a religious community but also pertain to the larger society, includ ing those who identify themselves with other faith traditions or with none.114 Third, to achieve such ends, public theology relies on sources of insight, lan guage, methods of argument, and warrants that are in theory open to all.115 Public theology is thus theologically informed public discourse about public is sues, addressed to the church, synagogue, mosque, temple, or other religious body, as well as the larger public or publics, argued in ways that can be evalu ated and judged by publicly available warrants and criteria.116 Similarly, a public theologian is someone who—from the perspective of a particular religion—an alyzes, discusses, or proposes solutions for issues, conditions, and questions that are of concern and import to those within his or her religious tradition, as well as to the general public, and does so in ways that can be understood and evalu ated by, and possibly be persuasive to, society at large.117 Expressed in terms of the Christian tradition, public theology intends to provide theologically informed interpretations of and guidance for individuals, faith communities, and the institutions and interactions of civil society, in ways that are understandable, assessable, and possibly convincing to those inside the church and those outside as well.118 Public theologians thus seek to communi cate, by means that are intelligible and assayable to all, how Christian beliefs and practices bear, both descriptively and prescriptively, on public life and the common good, and in so doing possibly persuade and move to action both Christians and non-Christians.119 To help clarify this definition I should explicitly state what public theology is not. Public theology stands in contrast to those exclusively confessional theologies120 that do not intentionally and explicitly seek to provide interpreta tions of and guidance for society's public sectors, institutions, and interactions, as a primary end of the church, as well as theologians who regard sources of in sight outside the Christian tradition as either alien or unreliable, and reject the notion that the public and social import of the Christian faith can be commu nicated to the larger society through some sort of universal or trans-communal language. Proponents of these positions often distinguish their own work from the public theology of others, with whom they disagree on these very points. That is, some opponents of public theology contrast their own work with efforts by those who try to give explicit guidance to society's various public sectors, ostensibly from within the Christian tradition,121 and inform their theological ethics with sources of insight that are not specifically or distinc tively Christian,122 or attempt to communicate from the Christian community to the wider culture through languages and forms of discourse that can be un derstood by those outside of, and thus not formed within and by, the Christian tradition.123</page><page sequence="13">To Tell the Truth • 67 In contrast, those who carry out a public theology do some or all of these things. First, in service of their public theology they employ sources of insight that are not explicitly or distinctively Christian, although these are combined to various extents with specifically Christian sources of insight.124 Second, they do so in order to give interpretations of and guidance to society's various sec tors, institutions, and interactions, and possibly to evaluate between religious beliefs and practices as they bear on matters of public concern.125 Third, they provide such interpretations and guidance in ways they intend to be intelligible and potentially persuasive to those both inside and outside the institutional churches.126 That is, public theology differs from some forms of confessional theology127 in its sources of insight, intended goals, audiences, and methods of discourse.128 One of the issues that counts in arriving at this definition of pub lic theology is a debate now going on in Christian theological ethics. Some theologians and ethicists eschew the normative task of addressing society and its core institutions, by providing for them a positive social teaching, as a be trayal of the sources of insight and forms of language that are distinctive to Christians. For example, George Lindbeck's well-known book argues for a cul tural-linguistic theory of religion in which the text absorbs the world.129 He therefore finds the use of sources outside the faith to be antithetical to the faith, properly understood. Stanley Hauerwas identifies himself with Lind beck's cultural-linguistic understanding of religion.130 Hauerwas and many who concur with him on this point therefore see individual or institutional use of sources of insight that are not distinctively Christian, as brought to bear upon a positive teaching for the various interactions, institutions, and sectors of contemporary society, through forms of language that can in theory be com prehended by both Christians and non-Christians, as faulty131 and deficiently Christian.132 Those who advocate or attempt to carry out public theology comprise one group that stands in contrast to this school of thought. What distinguishes those engaged in public theology is that they claim to use distinctively Christian sources of insight133 in dialogue with ones that are in principle available to non-Christians,134 and that they do so in part to address issues, institutions, and interactions that are of importance to society and its various sectors, through forms of discourse they intend to be, in theory and practice, intelligible and possibly persuasive to most members of society. Major Types of Critiques Leveled Against Public Theology Those who object to or oppose public theology do so for a variety of reasons, some of which are described above. While some critics consider the notion of public theology to be an oxymoron, others argue, for theological reasons, that</page><page sequence="14">68 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. the concept of public theology is redundant. The different types of critique contrast with each other on various points, even as they agree in their assess ment that public theology is flawed in theory, in practice, or both. However, as with public theology's proponents, its detractors also operate with various con ceptions of public theology that affect their critiques of it. In general, four main types of criticism are leveled against public theology. First, some criticize public theology in what might be dubbed a "Barthian" objection. That is, they dissent with public theology because it relies on what they consider to be alien or corruptive sources of knowledge or insight and seeks to participate in forms of discourse that it claims are public, usually for the purpose of providing positive guidance to various social arenas other than the church.135 Second, some criticize public theology as a functionalist or in strumentalist undertaking that puts Christianity in the service of institutions, groups, powers, ideologies, or ideals that are themselves outside of, foreign to, and often opposed to the Christian tradition.136 These two types of criticism are often combined, as in the critiques of public theology made by Stanley Hauer was and those in general agreement with his understanding of Christian theol ogy and ethics.137 Third, still others argue that, for a number of reasons, public theology is ei ther simply not necessary, and thus not a valuable or worthwhile endeavor of the Christian community, or worse, that public theology is a danger and a threat to our common civil society. On the one hand, some neither oppose, in principle, efforts to offer interpretations of and guidance for society's public sectors, nor question the wisdom and faithfulness of drawing upon sources of insight that are not explicidy or exclusively Christian, nor object to using forms of discourse that are not distinctively Christian. Yet they doubt the need for public theology on other grounds and thus do not view it as a significant under taking for the church. For example, James Gustafson wrote that one of the things at the University of Chicago Divinity School with which he dissented was the effort to forge a theory about public theology. Instead, he pointed to the U.S. Catholic Bishops' pastoral letter on war and peace as a document pro duced by the church that was taken "very seriously by some important persons in public life," without in the process intentionally attending to questions about how to forge such a theory.138 Therefore, it seems Gustafson is more interested in addressing substantive concerns, in constructive public theology, than in par ticipating in methodological discussions about public theology. On the other hand, some view public theology as a direct threat to the larger society, on nontheological or antitheological grounds, or they question the notion that theology can be public for epistemological reasons.139 Such critics may agree with some of the conclusions of those who present Barthian objections, but for different reasons.</page><page sequence="15">To Tell the Truth A fourth group, which I refer to as "sympathetic critics," generally agrees with or is sympathetic to public theology's goals, forms, methods, and audi ences, as they are often articulated by advocates of public theology. However, these critics differ with public theology's leading proponents and practitioners over its sources of insight, or the ways in which they are used, and over public theology's contents—over the particulars of the analyses, conclusions, and pol icy proposals most often put forward by those who make constructive public theology proposals.140 For the most part, those who are critical of public theology focus their atten tion on questions of theological method and on the various ways in which Chris tians address substantive issues that are of concern to both the church and the larger public. As this review of literature devoted to public theology shows, de bate continues among both public theology's proponents and its opponents about the extent to which it can be public in its form, language, and context, along with whether and to what extent it is a form of theology that remains faith ful to Christian sources and traditions. Conclusion Some final observations about the literature of public theology will serve to draw together the main points raised above and conclude the paper. First, all con cerned with this debate should further explore the range of public theology defi nitions and the various methodological proposals within the field, as well as the distinctions made between public theology and related terms and concepts. Sec ond, those interested in public theology, either as proponents or critics, should more adequately consider the numerous and diverse interpretive, historical, and descriptive claims made about public theologians and public theologies. Third, we should ask ourselves if the intentional effort to bring theology and the Chris tian faith to bear on public issues, as a primary goal of the church, is necessarily an unfaithful endeavor. Phrased differently, can Christian virtues, faith, and practice be taught, nurtured, sustained, and passed on within churches while they simultaneously advance a public theology both inside and outside their own communities? Fourth, those who are concerned about public theology should attend to ways in which discussions about and implementations of public theol ogy outside the discipline of theological ethics are in many ways outpacing re flection on it within the field.141 With the concept, rubric, and field of study known as public theology, one that has descriptive, methodological, and constructive facets, we would do well to attend to ways in which those outside the academic community—the larger public—understand and use the term, especially as it relates to things public. At</page><page sequence="16">70 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. the same time, we would also do well to listen carefully to ways in which those outside of or overlapping with the academic community—specifically the churches, seminaries, and divinity schools—understand and use the term, par ticularly as it bears on theology and ethics as well as Christian faith and practice. In the television game show To Tell the Truth, three contestants would an swer questions posed to them by celebrity panelists. Based on the contestants' responses, the panelists then tried to determine who the real contestant was: the real underwater explorer, the real fashion designer, or the real detective. Usually there was a single "real" contestant and two imposters, who tried to trick the panelists into thinking they were the real contestant. At the end of each round, panelists would vote for the contestant they thought was the real person, the one who had told the truth, and the host would then say, "Will the real (blank) please stand up?" As I recall, every now and then all three contestants in a round would stand up, because all three were in fact the person they claimed to be. This, I think, is true for public theology. We may think we know what public theology is, and why we support or criticize it, but unless we take into ac count the different types of public theology evidenced within the literature de voted to it—the interpretive, historical, and descriptive, the methodological, and the constructive—that together address critical issues and substantive con cerns that are of importance to the field, we may know only part of the real pub lic theology. Notes Since 1974, when the term "public theology" first appeared, seventeen books and over a hundred articles and essays have been published in which public theology(ies) or public theologian(s) appear in the title. Public theology is often defined in terms of its connection with Christianity. For example: "Public theology is the effort to discover and communicate the socially significant mean ings of Christian symbols and tradition." David Hollenbach, "Theology and Philosophy in Public: A Symposium on John Courtney Murray's Unfinished Agenda," Theological Studies 40, no. 4 (December 1979): 714. However, while it has been largely associated with Chris tianity, conversations about and expressions of public theology are, in theory, open to all religious traditions. For instance, in his analysis of the Islamic Kalam tradition, Richard C. Martin interprets public theology as a form of discourse used to negotiate conflict within and between religious traditions. Richard C. Martin, "Public Aspects of Theology in Me dieval Islam: The Role of Kalam in Conflict Definition and Resolution, " Journal for Islamic Studies 13, South Africa (1993): 77-100. Writing from a Jewish perspective, Jonathan S. Woocher observes: "Jewish 'public theology' deserves an analysis of its own." Jonathan S. Woocher, Sacred Survival: The Civil Religion of American Jews (Bloomington and Indianap olis: Indiana University Press, 1986), 93. In practice though, discussions about public the ology have focused primarily on Christianity and have taken place almost exclusively within the Christian tradition. As Robert W. McElroy notes: "In the truest sense, public theology is neither specifically Christian, nor specifically confined to mainstream Christian churches. But in practice, the term has come to apply to the effort by non-evangelical</page><page sequence="17">To Tell the Truth • 71 Christian theologians to steer a course between the fundamentalist approach to social re construction and the secular notion that spiritual values should not influence public policy or the construction of society." Robert W. McElroy, The Search for an American Piiblic The ology: The Contribution of John Courtney Murray (New York: Paulist Press, 1989), 185 n. 12. In coming years though, it is likely that contributions to public theology discourse will in creasingly come from outside the Christian tradition, even as the debate about public the ology continues within the field of Christian theological ethics. 3. Two examples will illustrate some of the divergent assessments of public theology. "The Catholic tradition ... [and the] heirs of the Reformation ... would betray their faith if they did not constantly renew their efforts to articulate a public theology that is able to guide the church, to shape the structures of civilization, and to call persons to participation in the ongoing institutions that sustain the common life in just and compassionate societies." Max L. Stackhouse, "Christian Social Ethics in a Global Era: Reforming Protestant Views," in Christian Social Ethics in a Global Era, ed. Max L. Stackhouse et al., Abingdon Press Studies in Christian Ethics and Economic Life, vol. 1 (Nashville: Abingdon Press, 1995), 13. "In view of the church's mission as lumen gentium, the very notions of'public church' and 'pub lic theology' rest on what can only be regarded as a category mistake. They identify the church as a subset of the nation-state. Theologically, it is the reverse that is true ... the be liefs and practices of the church do not need to be translated into public terms. They al ready are public. From this genuinely catholic perspective, it also becomes apparent that the public church and public theology are not very public at all. Indeed, they appear as as pects of the kind of false universalism that is endemic to the ideology of all earthly cities." Michael J. Baxter, "The Non-Catholic Character of the 'Public Church'," Modern Theology 11, no. 2 (April 1995): 257. 4. "Literature on the public theology debate is voluminous." W. D. Lindsey, "Public Theol ogy as Civil Discourse: What Are We Talking NoovlO" Horizons 19, no. 1 (spring 1992): 44 n. 1. "So extensive is the literature on public theology as a fully developed intellectual con cern in American culture, the most one can do is offer a select bibliography showing that the concerns transcend denominational barriers and intersect the various disciplines of philosophy, theology, and ethics." Victor Anderson, Pragmatic Theology: Negotiating the In tersections of an American Philosophy of Religion and Public Theology (Albany: State University of New York Press, 1998), 150 n. 1. For discussions of the topic within the Society of Christian Ethics, see Max L. Stackhouse, "Christian Social Ethics as a Vocation," in The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics, ed. D. M. Yeager (Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 1987), 3-16; Kathryn Tanner, "Public Theology and the Character of Public Debate," in The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics, ed. Harlan Becldey (Wash ington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 1996), 79-101; and William T. Cavanaugh, "Is Public Theology Really Public? Some Problems with Civil Society," in The Annual of the Society of Christian Ethics, ed. John Kelsay and Sumner B. Twiss (Washington, DC: Georgetown University Press, 2001), 105-23. 5. For example, several sessions at the June 2000 convention of the Catholic Theological So ciety of America dealt with public theology. Public theology has been the topic of confer ences at Princeton University, the University of Virginia, the University of Chicago, and Harvard Divinity School. Courses in public theology have been offered at the Graduate Theological Union, Berkeley, California, Union-PSCE, Richmond, Virginia, and Harvard Divinity School. United Theological College, NSW, Australia, offers a Master of Arts in Public Theology; the University of Edinburgh's Centre for Theology and Public Issues offers a Ph.D. in the field of public theology; and the Beyers Naudé Centre for Public The ology has been established at the Faculty of Theology, Stellenbosch University, South Af rica. Additionally, public theology has been the focus of over a dozen doctoral dis sertations, including Walter Pongratz, "Suggestions for a Public Theology: Dietrich</page><page sequence="18">72 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. Bonhoeffer's Work as Stimulus for a Public Theology" (Ph.D. diss., Drew University, 1991); Ryun Ho Chang, "The Prophetic Witness of Public Theology in Postmodern Cul ture Wars" (Ph.D. diss., School of World Mission, Fuller Theological Seminary, 1996); Stephen Eric Healey, "Public Theology and Postmodernism: A Theological-Ethical Anal ysis" (Ph.D. diss., Boston College, 1996); Shaun Allen Casey, "Nonproliferation, the Just War Ethic, and Public Theology" (Ph.D. diss., Harvard Divinity School, 1998); Mark Ed ward Stenberg, "Expanding Public Theology: Insights Provoked by the Recent Work of Jiirgen Habermas" (Ph.D. diss., Northwestern University, 1999); Nathan Andrew Baxter, "The Rhetoric of'Evangelical and Catholics Together'—'Gospel Betrayal,' 'Winning Alli ance,' or 'Good Beginning?'

Representative examples of the variety of subjects and contexts addressed in concert with public theology include Theodore Y. Blumoff, "An Essay on Liberalism and Public Theol ogy, "Journal of Law and Religion 14, no. 2 (1999-2000): 229-83; William Joseph Buckley, "Public Theologies in an Age of Ethnic Rivalries," The Catholic World 237, no. 1422 (No vember/December 1994): 272-80; Steve Goldzwig, "A Rhetoric of Public Theology: The Religious Rhetor and Public Policy," The Southern Speech Communication Journal 52, no. 2 (winter 1987): 128-50; L.

Gillespie, ed. Wallace M. Alston (Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans, 2000), 266-79. 7. For example, Roman Catholic Bishops in the United States claimed that "as Catholics we benefit from a rich tradition of public theology, which provides us with a unique guide in the search for the common good"; the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America discussed "how the church practices what is often called public theology"-, The Atlantic Monthly maga zine characterized Harvey Cox as a "public theologian"; and the U.S. Senate used the same term to describe Benjamin E. Mays in a resolution calling for the Presidential Medal of Freedom to be awarded posthumously to this civil rights leader. National Conference of Catholic Bishops, United States Catholic Conference, "Statement on Partial Birth Abor tion," Office of Communications, &lt;www.nccbuscc.org/comm/archives/2000/00-255.htm&gt; (accessed March 25, 2001); Evangelical Lutheran Church in America, Genetics!

Only a few years after it was first used, Charles R. Strain wrote: "The term 'public theol ogy' has recently been codified as an appropriate label for a distinctive genre of theological discourse. As with all initial efforts to specify the parameters of a particular genre, the defi nition of the term varies from person to person." Charles R. Strain, "Walter Rauschen busch: A Resource for Public Theology," Union Seminary Quarterly Review 34, no. 1 (fall 1978): 23. More than two decades later, the situation had not significantly changed. "The term 'public theology,' of course, is in dispute and has taken several forms." Max L. Stackhouse, "Broken Covenants: A Threat to Society?" in Judgment Day at the White House: A Critical Declaration Exploring Moral Issues a?id the Political Use and Abuse of Religion, ed. Gabriel Fackre (Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans, 1999), 19-20. Recently, Benjamin Valentin has noted the variety of meanings ascribed to public theology and thus the need for mapping with respect to it. "The term 'public theology' does not mean the same thing to each of these scholars, nor do they align the concept with the same overall theological or political project. 'Public theology' has, therefore, become an elastic and</page><page sequence="19">To Tell the Truth • 73 somewhat nebulous conception that requires some mapping." Benjamin Valentin, Mapping Public Theology: Beyond Culture, Identity, and Difference (Harrisburg, PA: Trinity Press Inter national, 2002), 84-85. 9. This is common to both public theology and civil religion, for which there are also myriad definitions. "Anyone conversant with the literature on civil religion that has grown up since Robert Bellah's celebrated essay on the topic of 'Civil Religion in America' knows that to speak of civil religion is to raise a hornet's nest of unresolved problems of definition and evaluation." John A. Coleman, An American Strategic Theology (New York: Paulist Press, 1982), 108. 10. As some writers have pointed out, several years before the term "civil religion" was intro duced into modern discussions, Will Herberg used the expression "civic religion" to de scribe what he characterized as the religious creed of Americanism. "This American cul ture-religion is the religious aspect of Americanism, conceived either as the common ground of the three 'faiths' or as a kind of super-religion embracing them.... Americanism thus has its religious creed, evoking the appropriate religious emotions; it may, in fact, be taken as the civic religion of the American people." Will Herberg, Protestant-Catholic-Jew: An Essay in American Religious Sociology, 2d ed. (Garden City, NY: Doubleday &amp; Company, 1960), 263. On the relationship of Herberg's civic religion and Bellah's civil religion, see Donald G. Jones, "Civil and Public Religion," in Encyclopedia of the American Religious Expe rience, ed. Charles H. Lippy and Peter W. Williams, vol. 3 (New York: Charles Scribner's Sons, 1988), 1393. 11. According to Bellah, "the separation of church and state has not denied the political realm a religious dimension [TJhere are ... certain common elements of religious orientation that the great majority of Americans share. These have played a crucial role in the develop ment of American institutions and still provide a religious dimension for the whole fabric of American life, including the political sphere. This public religious dimension is ex pressed in a set of beliefs, symbols, and rituals that I am calling the American civil religion." Robert N. Bellah, "Civil Religion in America," Dœdalus 96, no. 1 (winter 1967): 3-4. Oth ers have noted the importance of Bellah's article for subsequent discussions about civil reli gion: "Another way in which the consequences of a major shift in the religious patterns of the nation's life were becoming more evident was the explosion in the late 1960s of an ex tensive and continuing debate on the nature of civil religion. The way had been prepared by Herberg's discussion of'civic religion' of the American Way of Life in Protestant-Catho lic-Jew, but it was an article by sociologist Robert Bellah in 1967 that precipitated wide ranging discussion of the issue." Robert T. Handy, A Christian America: Protestant Hopes and Historical Realities, 1971, 2d ed., rev. (New York and Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1984), 194. For a discussion of the basic issues in the civil religion debate, see Russell E. Richey and Donald G. Jones, eds., American Civil Religion (New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1974). For a helpful analysis and bibliography of civil religion, see James A. Mathisen, "Twenty Years after Bellah: Whatever Happened to American Civil Religion?" Sociological Analysis 50, no. 2 (summer 1989): 129-46. 12.Jones, "Civil and Public Religion," 1393. 13. Martin Marty first used the term public theologian in Martin E. Marty, "Two Kinds of Two Kinds of Civil Religion," in Richey and Jones, eds., American Civil Religion, 139-57. "Perhaps these three figures [i.e., Jonathan Edwards, Abraham Lincoln, and Reinhold Niebuhr] should be thought of as critical public theologians as opposed to votaries of civil religion." Ibid., 148. He first used the term public theology in Martin E. Marty, "Reinhold Niebuhr: Public Theology and the American Experience," The Journal of Religion 54, no. 4 (October 1974): 332-59. "If Edwards, Bushnell, and Rauschenbusch represent what might be called public theology from the churches' side, their contemporaries Benjamin Franklin (or, later, Thomas Jefferson), Abraham Lincoln, and Woodrow Wilson used specifically</page><page sequence="20">74 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. deistic or theological material in order to make sense of the American experience." Ibid., 333-34. 14. "Marty proposes to distinguish between civil religion and public theology, a distinction which I view as a major contribution to the discussion of civil religion. The publicly institu tionalized civil religion must remain as symbolically open or empty as possible. . . . But public theology can speak from particular religious traditions to the national need." Robert N. Bellah, "American Civil Religion in the 1970s," in Richey and Jones, eds., American Civil Religion, 258. Bellah then incorporated the term into his work on civil religion. "Civil religion, a dimension more than an entity, operates at a different level from church reli gion. ... It is a religious interpretation of the American experience derived mainly from biblical images and symbols. It has been formed as much by the 'public theology' of church theologians as by the prophetic utterances of laymen." Robert N. Bellah, "Religion and Polity in America," Andover Newton Quarterly n. s. 15, no. 2 (November 1974): 107. Bellah also acknowledged that the term originated with Marty: "This phrase [i.e., public theology] was first used in my hearing by Martin Marty at a Consultation on American Civil Religion at Drew University in February, 1973." Ibid., 107 n. 2. Eventually, Bellah dropped out of the civil religion debate and stopped using the term, preferring instead to use the term "public church." He explains his reasons for doing so in Robert N. Bellah, "Comment [on James A. Mathisen, "Twenty Years After Bellah: Whatever Happened to American Civil Religion?"]," Sociological Analysis 50, no. 2 (summer 1989): 147; idem, The Broken Covenant: American Civil Religion in Time of Trial, 2d ed. (Chicago and London: University of Chi cago Press, 1992), ix-xii. 15. "In particular, American Catholics need to move beyond an approach to public questions based on Murray's version of the public philosophy to the formulation of a public theology which attempts to illuminate the urgent moral questions of our time through explicit use of the great symbols and doctrines of the Christian faith." David Hollenbach, "Public Theol ogy in America: Some Questions for Catholicism After John Courtney Murray," Theologi cal Studies 37, no. 2 (June 1976): 299. 16. In a passage often cited in public theology discussions, Tracy maintains that theologians address three publics: "This book will argue that all theology is public discourse. But be fore the meaning and warrants for that claim can be argued, it is necessary to examine the social reality of the theologian. If one is concerned to show the public stams of all theology, it becomes imperative first to study the reference groups, the 'publics,' of the theolo gian. . . . Each theologian addresses three distinct and related social realities: the wider so ciety, the academy and the church." David Tracy, The Analogical Imagination: Christian Theology and the Culture of Pluralism (New York: Crossroad, 1981), 3, 5. Tracy's efforts to ward developing a public theology continue his earlier "revisionist theology" project, for which he presents an extended argument in Blessed Rage for Order. There he wrote: "[T]his present work will risk both an interpretation of the presently existing models for theology and an initial defense of a proposed revisionist model which may prove more adequate to the present crisis of theological self-understanding. . . . Indeed such [revisionist] theolo gians believe that they can provide evidence to fair-minded critics inside and outside Chris tianity for the meaning and truth of the central Christian symbols." David Tracy, Blessed Rage for Order: The New Pluralism in Theology (New York: Seabury, 1975), 3-4, 9. David Murphy also discusses revisionist theologians within the context of public theology: "Simi larly, H. M. Kuitert, the foremost Dutch Protestant revisionist theologian, stresses the need for theology—as a legitimate part of the university—to be public." David Graham Murphy, "Public Theology? A Current Dutch Discussion," Calvin Theological Journal 28, no. 2 (November 1993): 372. 17. Comments about the importance of Marty's work are numerous and include Robert N. Bellah and Phillip E. Hammond, Varieties of Civil Religion (San Francisco: Harper &amp; Row,</page><page sequence="21">To Tell the Truth • 75 1980), xiii; Max L. Stackhouse, "The Church and Political Life: A Loss of Confidence," The Christian Century 98, no. 24 Qui y 29-August 5, 1981): 768; McElroy, The Search for an American Public Theology, 4; James R. Kelly, "Sociology and Public Theology: A Case Study of Pro-Choice/Pro-Life Common Ground," Sociology of Religion 60, no. 2 (summer 1999): 101-2. Stackhouse has commented that he thinks the term was used in discussions between Reinhold Niebuhr and John Courtney Murray before Marty employed it: "This term [i.e., public theology] was evidently first used in correspondence between John Courtney Murray and Reinhold Niebuhr, and has been subsequently elaborated by Martin Marty, David Tracy, and others." Max L. Stackhouse, "Liberalism Revisited: From Social Gospel to Public Theology [with Responses]," in Being Christian Today: An American Conversation, ed. Richard John Neuhaus and George Weigel (Washington, DC: Ethics and Public Pol icy Center, 1992), 317 n. 16. Similarly, in reference to John Paul II's encyclical Centesimus Annus, Stackhouse wrote: "[T]his document claims that 'authentic democracy is possible only in a state ruled by law and on the basis of a correct conception of the human person.' And these depend, above all, on what Murray and many since him have called 'public the ology.'" Max L. Stackhouse, "John Paul on Ethics and the 'New Capitalism'," The Christian Century 108, no. 18 (May 29-June 5, 1991): 582. However, Stackhouse does not cite, in support of these claims, any writings in which either Murray or Niebuhr used the term public theology. 18. For example, Reinhard Hiitter's critique of the position Wolfgang Huber takes with re spect to public theology is largely framed in terms of Hiitter's criticism of David Tracy's claims about the three publics to which theology is addressed. Reinhard Hiitter, Suffering Divine Things: Theology as Church Practice, 1997, trans. Doug Stott (Grand Rapids, MI: Wil liam B. Eerdmans, 2000), 166-71, 267 n. 85. Several participants in discussions about pub lic theology have noted the importance of Tracy's work. "Prominent among those who are attempting to define the nature and methods of 'public theology' is David Tracy." Duncan B. Forrester, "Christian Justice and Public Policy," Cambridge Studies in Ideology and Reli gion, vol. 10 (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997), 32. Others highlight David Hollenbach's contributions to the field. For example, Kathryn Tanner sees Hollenbach as one whose call for public theology was heeded by others: "A number of recent works in both Protestant and Roman Catholic theology take up the challenge that David Hollen bach issued in an article twenty years ago; the challenge of formulating a 'public theology which attempts to illuminate the urgent moral questions of our time through explicit use of the great symbols and doctrines of the Christian faith.'. . . [T]hese new public theologies try to draw out the implications of Christian symbols and doctrines for issues of general socio-economic and political moment." Kathryn Tanner, "Public Theology and the Char acter of Public Debate," 79. Philip Ziegler shares Tanner's perspective regarding the im portance of the same work by Hollenbach for subsequent efforts in public theology: "Both [Linell] Cady and [Max] Stackhouse have recently set out self-consciously programmatic contributions to the ongoing conversation concerning the public character of Christian theology. And both aim to heed the call David Hollenbach issued some twenty-five years ago." Philip Ziegler, "God and Some Recent Public Theologies," International Journal of Systematic Theology 4, no. 2 (July 2002): 138. 19. References to public philosophy predate use of the term public theology. For example, Walter Lippmann, The Public Philosophy (Boston and Toronto: Little, Brown, 1955); John Courtney Murray, We Hold These Truths: Catholic Reflections on the American Proposition (New York: Sheed and Ward, 1960).

McDermott, "Jonathan Edwards and the Culture Wars: A New Resource for Public Theology and Philosophy," Pro Ecclesia 4, no. 3 (summer 1995): 268-80. 20. Several authors have noted that Benjamin Franklin used this term when he referred to "the Necessity of a Publick Religion": "The term 'public theology' derives from Martin Marty's (1981) modification of the term public religion, originally used in 1749 by Benjamin Franklin." Kelly, "Sociology and Public Theology," 101. See also John F. Wilson, Public Religion in American Culture (Philadelphia: Temple University Press, 1979), 7; Martin E.

Jorgenson and Frank Luther Mott, ed., Benjamin Franklin: Representative Selections, with Introduction, Bibliography, and Notes (New York: Hill and Wang, 1962), 203.

'Civil religion,' however, is no such thing. It is an analytical concept used by some people to describe something they like, by others to decry something they dislike, and by others to locate a phenomenon with value-free scientific objectivity. . . . The definition of the nature of the problem should probably be different from each perspective." Yoder, The Priestly Kingdom, 172. 28. Robert N.

Some of those working in the field of political science use the term "civil theology" to de scribe what many theologians, sociologists, historians, and religious studies scholars refer to as "civil religion": "[Matthew] Arnold's religious writings, we shall argue, amount to a civil theology. The concept owes its preservation to St. Augustine, and can be explicidy identified in Dante, Bodin, Hobbes, Spinoza, Vico, Locke and Rousseau. In our own day it has been revived as a technical term in political science." F. B. K. Cooper, "The Civil The ology of Matthew Arnold," Église et Théologie 6, no. 3 (octobre 1975): 367. "Robert N.

"The term 'civil religion' comes form the Stoic tripartition of mythical, civil, and natural religion.. .. Civil religion represents that form of religion which is sustained by the politi cal authorities for the purpose of legitimating the political system and securing its well-be ing." Wolfhart Pannenberg, Human Nature, Election, and History (Philadelphia: The West minster Press, 1977), 72. 32. "Over against such privatized interpretations of religious symbolism, civil religion insists on a role in shaping the values that undergird public life and in promoting a sense of social responsibility that transcends the interests of the individual. That, then, is a central strength of civil religion: its intentionally public character." George Rupp, Commitment and Community (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1989), 85. 33. "For the purposes of this work, I distinguish between 'civil religion' and 'public theology.' Both refer to understandings of society and culture within an ultimate order. 'Civil reli gion' refers to how a society relates itself or its culture to ultimate reality. Public theology, on the other hand, refers to how an individual reflects critically on the meaning of civil community and the role of the religious community within it." Gerald R. McDermott, One Holy and Happy Society: The Public Theology of Jonathan Edwards (University Park: The Pennsylvania State University Press, 1992), 8. 34. "But public theology differs from civil religion in two significant ways. First, it reverses the method of civil religion. Whereas civil religion examines public life in the United States for signs of transcendence or ultimate concern, public theology begins by looking at the Chris tian tradition for its public significance. Second, civil religion, because of its concern for pluralism, devalues the particularist traditions of religious belief whereas public theology is a serious retrieval of what is accessible to all within a particular religion." Michael J. Himes and Kenneth R. Himes, Fullness of Faith: The Public Significance of Theology (New York: Paulist Press, 1993), 21-22. "On this point we differ with Marty's use of the term public theology. . . . For Marty it is closer to civil religion than our usage." Ibid., 193 n. 78. 35. "Civil religion asks what is the ultimate authority of the state and why should it be obeyed in foro interno. Public theology asks what is the believer's understanding of, and stance to wards, the state and civil society. Civil religion's questions are those of Plato, public theol ogy's are those of Augustine. Inherent in this distinction is a differentiation, if not tension, between the religious and political institutions of society. . . . These two structures of meaning evolve from the real, concrete dissonances felt when citizen and believer are one and the same person.. . . Because it is the believer's understanding of, and stance towards, civil society, public theology has a much broader base and different institutional dynamics than does civil religion." William A. Stahl, "Coming to Terms: Defining Structures of Meaning in the Civil Religion and Nationality Debates," Union Seminary Quarterly Review 39, nos. 1 and 2 (1984): 79. However, in contrast to such a position, Jürgen Moltmann ar gues for the independence of public theology from the church: "As the theology of God's kingdom, theology has to be public theology: public, critical and prophetic complaint to God—public, critical and prophetic hope in God. Its public character is constitutive for theology, for the kingdom of God's sake. Public theology needs institutional liberty over against the church, and a place in the open house of scholarship and the sciences. Today this liberty has to be defended against both atheists and fundamentalists." Jürgen Molt mann, God for a Secular Society: The Public Relevance of Theology (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1999), 5. 36. "The liberal regime never repudiated the civil religion that was already inherent in the Declaration of Independence and indeed kept it alive in our political life even though the</page><page sequence="25">To Tell the Truth • 79 Constitution was silent about it. From the point of view of the legal regime, however, any further elaboration of religious symbolism beyond that of the formal and marginal civil re ligion was purely private. From the point of view of the national community, still largely religious in its self-consciousness, such elaboration was public, even though lacking in any legal status. Here we can speak of public theology, as Martin Marty has called it, in distinc tion to civil religion. The civil millennialism of the revolutionary period was such a public theology and we have never lacked one since." Robert N. Bellah, "Religion and Legitima tion in the American Republic," in In Gods We Trust: New Patterns of Religious Pluralism in America, ed. Thomas Robbins and Dick Anthony, 2d ed., rev. (New Brunswick, NJ, and London: Transaction, 1990), 419. While Bellah here stresses the importance of public the ology to the national community, McDermott emphasizes the role of the individual in public theology; see note 3 3. 37. George Rupp maintains that "civil religion is not solidly grounded in particular religious communities." Rupp, Commitment and Community, 86. Few stress civil religion's generic sense, at least within the American context, more explicitly than Will Herberg. Drawing on Robin Williams's 1951 work American Society: A Sociological Interpretation, Herberg in quires into the 'common religion' of American society: "If we ask ourselves what is this sys tem of'ideas, [ideals], rituals and symbols' that serve as the 'common religion' of Ameri cans, providing them with an 'overarching sense of unity,' . . . [i]t seems to me that . . . Americans, by and large, find this 'common religion' in the system familiarly known as the American Way of Life. . . . This is the civil religion of Americans." Will Herberg, "Amer ica's Civil Religion: What It Is and Whence It Comes," in Richey and Jones, eds., American Civil Religion, 77. The bracketed word, "ideals," appears in Herberg's text. 38. "Whether construed narrowly to refer to denominational statements on public policy or broadly to take in the social teaching of the Christian churches and their counterparts among world religions, the idea of public theology offers an instructive counterpoint to conceiving religion and politics in terms of a unitary civil religion or public philosophy." Steven M. Tipton, "Public Theology," in The Encyclopedia of Politics and Religion, ed. Robert Wuthnow (Washington, DC: Congressional Quarterly, Inc., 1998), 624. Rupp contrasts civil religion with "public faith," a concept he characterizes in ways that broadly cohere with most descriptions of public theology. An important distinction, however, between public theology and the public faith Rupp advocates, is the religious dimension of public theology, which is constitutive of it, but that appears to be optional for public faith, as he describes it. "Over against this homogenizing and triumphalist tendency [within civil reli gion], what we need is public faith: commitment, whether religious or secular, that is unapologetically particular because it recognizes its roots in definite communities, tradi tions, and values but that is also entirely public because it is committed to comparative and critical inquiry." Rupp, Commitment and Community, 96; see esp. chap. 7, "From Civil Reli gion to Public Faith." 39. Steve Goldzwig maintains that "public theology differs markedly from discourse labelled as 'civil religion' in both substantive features and formal appeals.... Contrasting the rhetoric of public theology with that of civil religion allows the critic to isolate some important rhe torical distinctions." Goldzwig, "A Rhetoric of Public Theology," 130, 145. 40.

Declining "to develop either a general theory or a comprehensive and exhaustive typology of public religions," José Casanova, in his monograph on public religion, discusses in detail five "varieties of public religion in the modern world": American Catholicism, Brazilian Catholicism, Polish Catholicism, Spanish Catholicism, and Evangelical Protestantism in the United States. Casanova, Public Religions in the Modern World, 7-8. When seen in light of Martin Marty's depiction of the public church (see note 64), Casanova's examples of</page><page sequence="26">80 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. modem public religions comport with the public church's separate constituencies, even though Casanova maintains that Evangelical Protestantism was a civil religion in the nine teenth century. Casanova, Public Religions in the Modern World, 8, chap. 6. John F. Wilson views civil religion, specifically the form that he maintains Bellah proposes, as a specific version and development of public religion. Wilson, Public Religion in American Culture, 19; see also chap. 7, "The Interpretation of Public Religion in America." 42. "Public religion, therefore, is religion that has taken the resources of its tradition and brought them into the public sphere by demanding a voice in the policies and actions of the culture and the state." James K. Wellman, Jr., "Religion Out of the Closet: Public Religion and Homosexuality," in The Power of Religious Publics: Staking Claims in American Society, ed. William H. Swatos, Jr., and James K. Wellman, Jr. (Westport, CT: Praeger, 1999), 137. 43. Jones describes the development of the term civil religion by Robert Bellah, the related term public religion, and the earlier use of civic religion in Will Herberg's Protestant-Catholic-Jew. Jones, "Civil and Public Religion," 1394. He notes references to civil religion made by Rous seau and Benjamin Franklin's use of "publick religion." Referring to John F. Wilson's 1979 book Public Religion in American Culture, Jones maintains that Wilson's "preference for the term public religion over civil religion ... has not gained acceptance." Ibid. 44. John Courtney Murray maintained that there were two forms of public religion, one of which is related to the government: "Here there are two questions. The first concerns the public profession of faith in God and public worship of God by organized societies of men; this is 'public religion' in the strict and narrow sense. But there is a broader sense to the term. The faith and culture of a society are intimately linked to its culture and civilization. Hence there is the broader question of 'the philosophy of the Gospel' (to use Leo XIII's phrase) as the inspiration of all human civilization and culture. . . . There is the question, whether the Catholic faith, the one true faith, ought by divine law to be the public religion of all human societies. . . . And there is the question, whether the Catholic faith . . . ought by human law to be established as the official 'religion of the state'.... [T]he leading text in [Leo XHI's] Immortale Dei distinguishes clearly enough between the duty of public religion itself and the duty of caring for the public religion. The first duty is laid upon 'civil society' as a whole. . . . The duty of caring for the public religion (cura religionis) is laid upon gov ernment (principes) by reason of the special responsibility of the public power to the com mon advantage (ctnmnuni utilitati) of the citizenry. It is discharged by appropriate acts of legislation (religionem . . . auctoritate nutuque legum tegere)." Murray, "Leo XIII and Pius XII," S3, 60-61. 45. Referring to the early days of the nation, Martin Marty claims: "Presidents of the United States soon became the priests of public religion." He cites George Washington, John Ad ams, and Abraham Lincoln as examples. Marty, Religion and Republic, 61. Elsewhere Marty maintains that the "presidency still provides the most bully pulpit for propagating the na tion's public religion." Martin E. Marty, "Has There Been a Reagan Revolution in Theol ogy? A Century Symposium," The Christian Century 105, no. 9 (March 16, 1988): 276. While Marty and Thiemann describe Abraham Lincoln as a public theologian (see notes 13 and 103), Rupp claims Lincoln was "perhaps the foremost exemplar of American civil religion" and Yoder refers to "the most valid of the less churchly civil theologies, like that of Lincoln." Rupp, Commitment and Community, 93; Yoder, The Priestly Kingdom, 188. For an extended study of civil religion with respect to the American Presidency, see Richard V. Pierard and Robert D. Linder, Civil Religion and the Presidency (Grand Rapids, MI: Aca démie Books, 1988). 46. "The subject [of civil religion, public religion, etc.] has suffered from lack of common defi nition. ... In this essay I use 'public religion' to mean concepts of official religion, distinct from particular denominations, which are openly designed and supported by the state and institutionalized in some form of Establishment to supply basic religious consensus to an</page><page sequence="27">To Tell the Truth • 81 otherwise pluralistic religious environment. . . . Watts also developed the most compre hensive and detailed formulation of what a 'secularized' national cult might entail and ex plored its uses and limitations over two decades before Jean-Jacques Rousseau devoted a fa mous chapter to the same concept in his Social Contract." J. F. Maclear, "Isaac Watts and the Idea of Public Religion," Journal of the History of Ideas 53, no. 1 (January-March 1992): 25 n. 1,26. 47. "But the notion of public religion, like that of civil religion, obscures the role and impor tance of theological reflection upon religion. The distinctive character and problems of de veloping a public theology are overlooked when it is absorbed into the concept of public or civil religion.. . . The dialectical relationship between religion and theology ensures over lap and affinity between a public religion and a public theology. Although the goal of a public theology, I will argue, includes the facilitation of public religion, this substantive agenda is not an exhaustive criterion. . . . The defining characteristics of public theology will not be reducible to those of public religion, then, however much their substantive in tentions may overlap." Cady, Religion, Theology, and American Public Life, 24-25. 48. Under a section tided "Four Stages of Public Religion," Martin Marty lists several secular proponents of public religion: "The second stage ... took diverse shapes in the writings of nineteenth-century literary figures after enlightened deism faded or lost out to aggressive sectarians. Ralph Waldo Emerson, Henry David Thoreau, Walt Whitman, Herman Mel ville, and Horace Mann all largely bypassed the historic and divided churches in their pro posals. ... In the end, however, this style of public religion found voice only in the writings of solitary geniuses who attracted reading clienteles, not congregations. . . . Then, in the middle third of the twentieth century, advocates of a public religion, still united against the churchly sects but disunited about their own alternatives, made new claims. Thus, in 1934, philosopher John Dewey promoted/! Common Faith, which took democracy as both its set ting and its object, over against inherited church religion." Marty, Religion and Republic, 62. 49. "Through the years, then, advocates of public religion, while divided over whether it re quires a God or not, or whether it should be voluntary or coerced, and though themselves chopped apart by many competing philosophies, have often successfully conveyed the idea that public faith is one big agreed-upon thing over against schismatic church religion." Ibid., 64. 50. "Differentiating public theology from civil religion requires framing the discussion along the following lines: while civil religion ends on an optimistic and largely complaisant note, public theology, for the most part, takes up a cause by pointing out what is wrong, not what is right about society A rhetoric of public theology emphasizes that action based on re ligious belief supersedes any other political, social, or economic consideration. Often, rather than creating a discourse to enhance partnership with the sate [sic, state?] on issues of joint concern, the rhetoric becomes confrontational. Its raison d'etre is social and political change. At times, public theology buries or at least tames Caesar, at others it praises him." Goldzwig, "A Rhetoric of Public Theology," 145-46. 51. Writing in terms of "civil theology," Cooper argues that "the purpose of a civil theology, we must remember, is not finally to secure religious truth itself, but to secure a publicly ac ceptable version of it. . . . Now the objective of a civil theology, we said, was public peace and spiritual harmony based upon a common emotional attachment to shared symbols and shared beliefs." Cooper, "The Civil Theology of Matthew Arnold," 371, 379. Civil theol ogy and civil religion, as noted above, are essentially synonymous, see note 30. 52.

"Political theology is one in a series of attempts made by Roman Catholic and Protestant theologians since the 1960s to come to grips with the foundations of Christianity in light of the twentieth-century crisis of culture." Frederick G. Lawrence, "Political Theology," in The Encyclopedia of Religion, ed. Mircea Eliade (New York: Macmillan Publishing Com pany, 1987), 404-5. 54. "Perhaps most basically, a public theology seeks to overcome the cultural marginalization so highly characteristic of contemporary theology." Cady, Religion, Theology, and American Public Life, 25. "Political theology therefore has a transconfessional character and is ecu menical insofar as both [Catholic and Protestant] churches stand before the same problem of the growing irrelevance of their doctrines for modern life, finding in none of the differ ent theological-church traditions the key for the solution of the problems of the modern age." Moltmann, On Human Dignity, 98. 55. "Political theology is rather a theological hermeneutic, which, in distinction from a theol ogy that interprets reality from an ontological or existentialist point of view, holds open an horizon of interpretation in which politics is understood as the comprehensive and decisive sphere in which Christian truth should become praxis." Soelle, Political Theology, 58-59. "Political theology is not a new dogmatic. Rather it wants on the level of fundamental the ology to awaken the political consciousness of every Christian theology Political theol ogy does not want to make political instead of theological questions the central concern of theology but, rather, the reverse. It wants to be thoroughly Christian in the political func tions of theology. It does not want to politicize the church, but it does want to Christianize church politics and the political involvement of Christians." Moltmann, On Human Dig nity, 99. 56. "A word is needed to explain my use of the term 'public theology' for Edwards's concep tion of the civil community and the Christian's relation to it. Although such a conception has often been referred to as 'political theology,' I avoid that term for a number of reasons. . . . Edwards's public theology encompassed far more than just the social and political rights of certain classes. So the term 'political theology,' because of its programmatic con notations, is too restrictive." McDermott, One Holy and Happy Society, 6-7. 57. "A Public Theology is particularly concerned with the identification of these principles and the warrants for them for assessing these religious claims and with the equipping of the population with sufficient knowledge of these principles and warrants so that the difference between serious and trivial, valid and phony truth claims about religion and morality in these various statements can be seen by the general population."

Lawson Taitte (Austin: The University of Texas Press, 1985), 107. 58. With respect to both "the theologies of the new Christian evangelical right" and "the Latin American liberation theologies," Linell Cady claims that "their methods of argumentation are, for the most part, not public. They generally remain confessional theologies, appealing to theological authorities to defend their positions. Hence, a public theology is not merely a synonym for a political theology, despite the important similarities between them. A pub lic theology not only must address itself to the wider social and political issues, but it must appropriate a form of argumentation that is genuinely public." Cady, Religion, Theology, and American Public Life, 25-26. 59.

"Nor is public theology identical with its closest relative, political theology. . . . [P]ublic theology does not begin the approach to the crises of common meaning in modern life through political means. It is instead an attempt to say that political problems are not the primary ones, and that we make an error if we allow the word public to be used in a way that makes all decisions about the common life matters of state." Max L. Stackhouse, "The Pastor as Public Theologian," in The Pastoras Theologian, ed. Earl E. Shelp and Ronald H. Sunderland (New York: The Pilgrim Press, 1988), 113. 61. "Public theologians, especially in the face of current developments, have identified these decisive areas of civil society as distinct if overlapping publics that have now expanded well beyond the confines of any particular nation-state or cultural unit. The global society now in the making demands that we ask precisely the questions of this tradition, now in a new way, with vastly expanded horizons. Christians must speak to issues of the common life, and do so in public. And the first area where they will be properly expected to speak is in re gard to the plurality of religions.... The second area is the academic public.... The third area, is the political public.... To these we add the economic public." Max L. Stackhouse, "Introduction," in The Righteousness of the Kingdom, ed. Max L. Stackhouse, Texts and Studies in the Social Gospel, vol. 2 (Lewiston, Queenston, Lampeter: Edwin Mellen Press, 1999), xxvii-xxviii. 62. "As for the term 'public church,' it fits in a larger context of uses of the word public, so some pointers if not full definitions are in order here. Such a church is a partial Christian embodiment within public religion. This term from Benjamin Franklin fits the American pluralist pattern better that does Rousseau's 'civil religion,' because it took into account the particularities of the faiths that would not disappear or lighdy merge to please other found ers of the nation. These churches could, however, contribute out of their separate re sources to public virtue and the common weal. . . . The public church, then, is a specifically Christian polity and witness. If there are some novelties in the present definition and call, an historian can serve the public church by sketching precedents for this Christian contri bution to American public theology as a critical and constructive voice within public reli gion. This contribution has little to do with 'saving faith,' which refers to the ways in which a person is finally grounded in or reconciled to God. It focuses on 'ordering faith,' which helps constitute civil, social, and political life from a theological point of view. Never from the first European arrivals, has America lacked the witness of the public church." Marty, The Public Church, 16-17. 63. "Secondly, in one important respect 'public' does not mean governmental but is a contrast term to it. In the second democratic transformation of the eighteenth century, 'public' came to mean the citizenry who reflect on matters of common concern, engage in delibera tion together, and choose their representatives to constitute the government, whose pow ers are limited by a constitution. Religious bodies are very much part of this meaning of the public, not because they are governmentally 'established' religions with legal privileges but because they enter into the common discussion about the public good. It is in this sense that one can legitimately speak of a 'public church.'" Bellah et al., The Good Society, 179. Chapter 6 is titled "The Public Church." 64. "The public church is a family of apostolic churches with Jesus Christ at the center, churches which are especially sensitive to the res publica, the public order that surrounds and includes people of faith. The public church is a communion of communions, each of which lives its life partly in response to its separate tradition and partly to the calls for a common Christian vocation. In America the constituency of this convergence of churches comes from elements within the old mainline, the newer evangelicalism, and Catholicism." Marty, The Public Church, 3. 65. In his discussion of "three themes in the life of a public church," Bryan Hehir notes that in debates about social policy, the church "enters the policy debate of a democratic society as</page><page sequence="30">84 • E.

This calls attention to distinguishing features of the public church—its institutional and communal aspects. However, we should not simply equate such institutions or communi ties with their theologies. 66. "Public theology engages a diverse people in the larger context of American public culture as distinct from the public church understood as a specifically Christian polity, people, and witness." Tipton, "Public Theology," 624. 67. "We use 'public church' to mean a community whose social mission is characterized by three things: 1) respect for the legitimate autonomy of other social institutions, ... 2) ac ceptance of some responsibility for the well-being of the wider society,. .. and 3) commit ment to work with other social institutions in shaping the common good of the society.... As believers reflect upon and analyze the experience of a church that is engaged in the na tion's public life, a theology emerges which seeks to make sense of the ecclesial experience. Public theology ... is a manner of theological reflection which examines the resources la tent within the Christian tradition for understanding the church's public role." Himes and Himes, Fullness of Faith, 2, 4. See especially the first chapter, "The Public Church and Pub lic Theology." See also Forrester, "The Public Church Reborn," in Truthful Action, chap. 9. 68. "When the public church reflexively examines and critiques existing social practices and cul tural understandings in the light of its deepest religious insights into justice and the good society, it does public theology." Kelly, "Sociology and Public Theology," 102. 69. "As public theology, Christian theology is relatively independent of the church, for it too has political, cultural, economic and ecological mandates, parallel to the mandate of the church. For these, it needs to be institutionally independent of the church, as it is, for ex ample, in theological faculties at state universities." Moltmann, God for a Secular Society, 252. James Kelly supports contributions to public theology originating within the aca demic community: "Appropriately contributing to a public theology can become a more explicit part of ASR's [Association for the Sociology of Religion's] evolving identity." Kelly, "Sociology and Public Theology," 102. 70. An interesting recent development in this regard is the incorporation of the term public theology into seminary curricula and identity. In addition to offering courses in public the ology, some seminaries now describe their purpose, at least in part, in terms of public the ology. For example, in its vision statement the Lutheran Theological Seminary at Gettys burg claims: "We share the content of Christian faith. We model the role of the public theologian as proclaimer of God's Word." &lt;www.ltsg.edtx/sem/about/vision.htm&gt; (ac cessed November 11, 2002). 71. "[W]e suffer a dearth of public intellectuals in a world begging for their services. In partic ular, there are few theologians of public life on the U.S. American scene." Larry Rasmussen, "Reinhold Niebuhr: Public Theologian," Cross Currents 38, no. 2 (summer 1988): 209. Benjamin Valentin also discusses public theologians in terms of public intellectuals. Valen tin, Mapping Public Theology, xiii, 84—85. 72. "Public theologians endeavor to make room for theology within modern colleges and uni versities. Seeking to render theology palatable according to reigning paradigms of inquiry in nonconfessional contexts of higher education, public theologians spend considerable time on criteriological issues (see Tracy [The Analogical Imagination], 1981). Public theol ogy is very much a self-reflective, academic affair, devoted in part to clarifying the proper methodology for religious thought. In contrast, public intellectuals are concerned less with making their work academically respectable than with addressing an audience that goes be yond the academy. For the public intellectual, the quest to make religious thought respect able within the academy is not a solution, but a problem. As a result, public theologians and</page><page sequence="31">To Tell the Truth • 85 public intellectuals interested in religion have quite different audiences and problems in mind." Miller, "Religion and the American Public Intellectual," 371-72. 73. William Placher would disagree with this claim. He sees the goals and audience of public theology as more limited than those of public intellectuals. "I'm not sure I'd ever heard the term, but I guess I wanted to be a theologian in order to have a chance of becoming a 'pub lic intellectual.' I haven't really changed my mind in the ensuing years, and therefore much of the recent discussion of 'public theology' has disappointed me. It often seems a conver sation about how intellectually elite Christian theologians can more effectively engage other members of the intellectual elite. A worthy purpose, no doubt—but I got into the business in part because I wanted to address a much larger 'public,' to connect somehow with 'ordinary' folks." Placher, "Taking Risks to Reach a Popular Audience," 20. 74. "This book may be seen as a contribution to 'lay' or 'public' theology. It is lay theology in the sense that it is concerned with the ethical dimensions of economic rather than pastoral issues, and public theology in that it presumes the appropriateness of public discussion on those issues." Ian Hore-Lacy, Creating Common Wealth: Aspects of Public Theology in Economics (Sutherland, NSW, Australia, and Tring, Herts, England: Albatross Books Pty. Ltd. and Lion Publishing, 1985), 12. "Moreover, it is my hunch that the most effective public theol ogy will be carried forward by laity who are more expert in their fields than theologians and ethicists will ever be. These laypeople will be informed by theologians but will filter their re ligious notions through the conceptual apparatus of their own fields. The laity have come of age; they are on the front lines of public theology." Robert Benne, "Less Enthusiasm, Please, I'm Lutheran," The Christian Century 108, no. 3 0anuary 23, 1991): 78. For a discussion of clergy as public theologians, see Stackhouse, "The Pastor as Public Theologian." 7 5. This is a point argued in McCutcheon, "A Default of Critical Intelligence? " (see note 139).

"Public theology is the effort to discover and communicate the socially significant mean ings of Christian symbols and tradition. Public philosophy is the effort to discover and communicate the significant meanings of common social and political experience in our pluralistic culture." Hollenbach, "Theology and Philosophy in Public," 714-15. 77. "Public philosophy is to be distinguished from public theology. The former does not de pend on insights or wisdom that can be derived only from some religious tradition. The latter is dependent on specific religious symbols and doctrines." Richard P. McBrien, Caesar's Coin: Religion and Politics in America (New York and London: Macmillan Pub lishing Company, 1987), 238 n. 34. 78.

"Public theology does not refer to the same things that... public philosophy do[es],... It is theological in the sense that it takes as its fundamental point of departure the metaphysi cal and epistemological questions about whether we can speak meaningfully and cross confessionally about the logos of theos—especially in ways that can make sense to those who are not already convinced of our confessional stances in faith and ethics, and who do not</page><page sequence="32">86 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. share our socio-historical backgrounds." Stackhouse, "Christian Social Ethics as a Voca tion," 14. 80. "Discovery of the relationship between these two spheres of meaning [one of which is the focus of public theology, the other, that of public philosophy] and of the relationship be tween the moral norms that these meanings imply is a properly theological task. It is a task that can be called fundamental political theology. A fundamental political theology which seeks to understand these relationships is thus essential if both public theology and public philosophy are to be truly critical. . . . Without such reflection public theology will lose contact with the ways God is actively present in the contemporary social world. Similarly, without such reflection public philosophy risks uncritical affirmation of cultural biases which are in contradiction with the moral content of the Christian faith." Hollenbach, "Theology and Philosophy in Public," 714-15. "The best antidote to this tendency toward archaic regression is the critical tradition that has characterized American political life from its beginning. This critical tradition has been expressed in what Martin Marty called a public theology and what Walter Lippmann called a public philosophy. ... In the forma tive period of the American republic a vigorous public philosophy complemented our pub lic theology." Bellah and Hammond, Varieties of Civil Religion, xiii-xiv. See also Mc Dermott, "Jonathan Edwards and the Culture Wars." 81. "Catholic social ethics today continues to posit a separation between theology and social the ory and it does so in two ways: first, by extendingjohn Courtney Murray's project of provid ing the nation with a 'public philosophy' (or now, a 'public theology') to which all in a plural istic society can appeal; and second, by reinforcing that project with a theoretical paradigm quite distinct from the neo-scholastic one that shaped Murray, a paradigm inherited ffom Max Weber." Michael J. Baxter, "Blowing the Dynamite of the Church: Catholic Radical ism from a Catholic Radicalist Perspective," in The Church as Counterculture, ed. Michael L. Budde and Robert W. Brimlow (Albany: State University of New York Press, 2000), 203. 82. "Throughout [this essay] I will be concerned with the following issues: the necessity of public philosophy and public theology; the content of public philosophy and public theol ogy; and the difficulties which the present state of our intellectual life and of our public life poses for these undertakings.... Our exemplar of Niebuhr's public philosophy and public theology is The Children of Light and the Children of Darkness of 1944. The problem with which Niebuhr is concerned is similar to that of Dewey and Lippmann. . . . And like the others he mixes philosophy and theology." Bellah, "Public Philosophy and Public Theol ogy," 79, 85. However, in this article Bellah himself tends to mix the two; he never states what he understands the similarities and differences between public philosophy and public theology to be. Others have noted Bellah's lack of clarity on this point. Referring to the same article, McDermott notes that "Bellah has recently used the term 'public theology,' but without defining it." McDermott, One Holy and Happy Society, 7 n. 18. 83. In his most influential work, Murray used the term "public philosophy" to describe the fo cus of his study: "Previous chapters have raised the issue of the American consensus, or, what comes to the same thing, the public philosophy of America. (I shall use the terms pretty much synonymously, though there is a nuance of meaning. The term 'public philos ophy' emphasizes an objectivity of meaning. The term 'consensus' emphasizes a subjectiv ity of persuasion.)... The starting point, as I have indicated, is the forthright statement of the Declaration of Independence: 'We hold these truths ...' That is to say, we have a pub lic philosophy; as a people, we have come to a consensus. This philosophy is the foundation of our public life; by coming to this consensus we have come to be a people, possessed of an identity." Murray, We Hold These Truths, 79-80. The ellipsis after "We hold these truths" appears in Murray's text. 84. Robert McElroy argues that "the need to revisit Murray's life-work on religion and society arises from the very real possibility that the frequency with which contemporary public</page><page sequence="33">To Tell the Truth • 87 theologians borrow from Murray's writings is a sign that the Murray corpus should not be treated merely as a source from which to draw, but as the foundational framework and guiding force of contemporary American public theology." McElroy, The Search for an American Public Theology, 7. For the most part, however, throughout this book McElroy tends to overlook or downplay Protestant public theologies. 85. See, for example, Benestad, "Catholicism and American Public Philosophy"; and Mouw and Griffioen, Pluralisms and Horizons. 86. For example, John Dewey, A Common Faith (New Haven, CT, and London: Yale Univer sity Press, 1934); Lippmann, The Public Philosophy, Sullivan, Reconstructing Public Philosophy, George Cotkin, William James, Public Philosopher (Urbana and Chicago: University of Illi nois Press, 1994); Sandel, Democracy's Discontents. 87. Social ethics "usually refers to normative ethical reflection that focuses upon social struc tures, processes, and communities, especially those that are large and complex, such as gov ernment, economic life, or international politics. It can also refer descriptively to socially shared patterns of moral judgment and behavior." Joseph L. Allen, "Social Ethics," in The Westminster Dictionary of Christian Ethics, ed. James F. Childress and John Macquarrie (Philadelphia: Westminster, 1986), 592. 88. "In sum, then, I believe that a new discipline of public ethics, or reflection upon moral pat terns at large in society, should be the organizing point for study of the American ethos." Sellers, Public Ethics, 44. 89. See, for instance, Rasmussen, Christian Social Ethics, E. Clinton Gardner, Biblical Faith and Social Ethics (New York: Harper &amp; Brothers, 1960); and Sellers, Public Ethics. 90. Some forms of social ethics are premised on thoroughly secular grounds. For example: "Social ethics is the systematic reflection on the moral dimensions of social structures, systems, issues, and communities. Social ethics can be thought of as a branch of 'applied ethics,' the application of ethical reasoning to social problems. . . . One of the most well known efforts to develop an appropriate standard of justice for social ethics is that pre sented by John Rawls in A Theory of Justice." D. Don Welch, "Social Ethics, Overview," in Encyclopedia of Applied Ethics, ed. Ruth Chadwick (San Diego: Academic Press, 1998), 143, 147. This area of philosophical or secular ethics is sometimes described as social philoso phy or political philosophy. Other examples include Joel Feinberg, Social Philosophy (Engle wood Cliffs, NJ: Prentice-Hall, 1973); Robert Nozick, Anarchy, State, and Utopia (New York: Basic Books, 1974); and Michael Walzer, Spheres of Justice: A Defense of Pluralism and Equality (New York: Basic Books, 1983). 91. For example, Dana Wilbanks views public theology as a subset of social ethics: "The third direction in contemporary Christian social ethics is represented by public theology and ethics. It is sharply critical of a dualistic outlook among Christians in which theology is re garded as pertinent to the church but not to the public realm." Dana Wilbanks, "The Church as Sign and Agent of Transformation," in The Church's Public Role: Retrospect and Prospect, ed. Dieter T. Hessel (Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans, 1993), 30-31. McElroy sees public theology as a part of "social theology": "Public theology should be seen as a branch of social theology, and specific public theologies should not be criticized as incomplete because they do not accomplish all of the goals necessary for a comprehensive social theology." McElroy, The Search for an American Public Theology, 151-52. 92. "Public theology is not just another name for social ethics, though I hold to the unity of theology and ethics in Christian reflection." Clifford Green, "Bonhoeffer's 'Non-Religious Christianity' as Public Theology," Dialog 26, no. 4 (fall 1987): 276. Robert Benne main tains that public theology and social ethics are distinguished by "nuances" in usage of the terms, but does not state what he understands the differences between them to be: "I am now interested in collecting my thoughts on Christian social ethics, Lutheranly conceived.</page><page sequence="34">88 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. I am interested ... in elaborating the basic theological-ethical framework for engaging the Christian vision with its surrounding public environment—political, economic, cultural, and intellectual. Such a task of engagement currently goes under the name of public theol ogy, though there are nuances in the usage of that term that differ from the earlier term, so cial ethics," Robert Benne, The Paradoxical Vision: A Public Theology for the Twenty-First Cen tury (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1995), ix-x. 93. Patrick Lynch takes this approach in his analysis of John Paul II's public theology: "Pope John Paul II has written three major encyclicals on issues of social ethics: Laborem Exercens... Sollicitudo Rei Socialis... and Centesimas Annus.... To studyjohn Paul II's views on capital ism, democracy, or workers' rights in these texts would indicate the public policy issues that concern him and the positions that he has taken. The motivation for these positions, how ever, is the more crucial issue. At this level the theological and scriptural positions that un dergird his practical teaching and policy statements on public issues emerge. Furthermore, his very reasons for making such statements come more fully to light. This public theology, as I call it, thus provides a foundation and rationale for better understanding John Paul II's current teaching and should reveal the principles for the future development of his thought." PatrickJ. Lynch, "Creation, Redemption, Solidarity: Pope John Paul II's Public Theology," in Prophecy and Diplomacy: The Moral Doctrine of John Paul IL A Jesuit Symposium, ed. John J. Conley and Joseph W. Koterski (New York: Fordham University Press, 1999), 24. 94. Stackhouse, "The Church and Political Life," 769. 95. Cady calls attention to differences between public theology and both public religion and political theology; see notes 47 and 58 above. However, Christopher Mooney claims that public theology resonates with certain secularized forms of civil religion: "The 'public the ology' I mentioned earlier, precisely because it makes explicit use, in its commentary on the public scene, of ethical teachings, behavior paradigms, and morally revelatory events of the Bible, finds a natural resonance with these more secularized convictions of civil religion. Indeed, in language and concern it is sometimes difficult to tell them apart." Mooney, Pub lic Virtue, 5. 96. Kenneth D. Wald, Religion and Politics in the United States, 4th ed. (Lanham, MD: Rowman and Littlefield, 2003), 55. Similarly, Michael Angrosino uses the terms civil religion, public theology, and political theology interchangeably. Michael Angrosino, "Civil Religion Redux," Anthropological Quarterly 75, no. 2 (2002), 260-61. 97. Consider E. Clinton Gardner's definition of social ethics and a description of public the ology offered by Max Stackhouse several decades later: "Social ethics may be defined as 'the study of what is in the light of what ought to bel Viewed in these terms, the social scien tist's distinctive contribution to the determination of social policy lies in the contribution which he makes to a more adequate understanding of what is whereas the distinctive task of the ethicist is to provide a normative framework in terms of which the empirical and theoretical data supplied by the social sciences can be evaluated." Gardner, Biblical Faith and Social Ethics, 9. "[T]he sociologist of religion can tell the theologian of society how . . . those primary convictions about truth and justice actually work in social history and what forces in civilization they inevitably have to encounter. Meanwhile, the theologian of soci ety can point out that ... the sociologist often works with fundamental conceptions of what is ultimately true and just.... The theologian of society (and theological ethicist).. . can identify the hidden normative visions in the sociologist, anthropologist or social scien tists, and help them assess whether or not it is, in fact, worthy of ultimate loyalty. This dia logue is often going on within people and sometimes between people, but seldom between disciplines. If it continues into the future it may lead to a sociologically sound, cosmopoli tan public theology." Max L. Stackhouse, "The Sociology of Religion and the Theology of Society," Social Compass: International Review of Sociology of Religion 37, no. 3 (September 1990): 328-29.</page><page sequence="35">To Tell the Truth • 89 98. Many proponents of public theology maintain that it should be directed to those both in side and outside the church and that its meaning should be grasped by those beyond its own community. This is accomplished, in large part, by drawing on both religious and nonreligious sources of insight and through the use of forms of communication and argu mentation that are, at least in theory, open to all. Such criteria are not necessarily shared by social and public ethics, which are frequently intended for and addressed to a specific denomination or faith tradition. 99. This is one way in which Max Stackhouse's understanding of public theology is distinc tive. For him, public theology should offer interpretations of and guidance for society's sectors or spheres and their institutions and should also evaluate religious beliefs and practices as they bear on public issues. Max L. Stackhouse, "Religious Freedom and Hu man Rights," 103-5. See also Stackhouse, Public Theology and Political Economy: Christian Stewardship in Modern Society (Grand Rapids, MI: William B. Eerdmans, 1987), 103; idem, Introduction to God and Globalization: Vol. 1 : Religion and the Powers of the Common Life, ed. Max L. Stackhouse with Peter J.

In reference to Orestes Brownson, John A. Ryan, and John Courtney Murray, John Coleman claims: "The three were, in Martin Marty's phrase, 'public theologians' who drew upon their Catholic tradition to address issues and audiences in the wider American or international context." John A. Coleman, "Vision and Praxis in American Theology: Orestes Brownson, John A. Ryan, and John Courtney Murray," Theological Studies 37, no. 1 (March 1976): 7. Referring to Coleman's analysis of Brownson, Ryan, and Murray as public theologians, David Hollenbach claims: "These men were theologians because their intellectual work drew consciously from the wellsprings of Christian theological tradi tion. They were 'public' theologians because their concerns emerged from the life of the polis—civil liberty, economic justice, Church-state relationships, etc." David Hollenbach, "Public Theology in America," 290. In a later symposium on Murray, Robin Lovin pro posed that "[t]he Christian moral vision of a just society expressed in biblical symbols can be distinguished from the jurisprudential norms for public policy. But just as society and state are increasingly interpenetrating, so must the Christian vision be woven into the fab ric of policy and jurisprudence. The effort to do this is the task of public theology." Robin W. Lovin, "Resources for a Public Theology," Theological Studies 40, no. 4 (December 1979): 709. 101.

Two works frequendy characterized as public theology by others are National Conference of Catholic Bishops/ United States Catholic Conference, The Challenge of Peace: God's Promise and Our Response (Washington, DC: National Conference of Catholic Bishops/United States Catholic Conference, 1983); idem, Economic Justice for All: Pastoral Letter on Catholic Social Teaching and the U.S. Economy (Washington, DC: National Conference of Catholic Bishops/ United States Catholic Conference, 1986). 109. "I personally found it possible—indeed, personally necessary—to enter that branch of the academy that stands within the church and to attempt to reconstruct what Troeltsch called a Christian social philosophy, and what today some of us call a public theology." Max L. Stackhouse, "What Tillich Meant to Me," The Christian Century 107, no. 4 (Janu ary 31, 1990): 102. "Max Stackhouse ..., Robert Benne . .., David Hollenbach ..., and Robin Lovin ... are but a few examples of the many professional theologians who con sider themselves (or are considered by their peers) to be social ethicists or 'public theolo gians.'" Kenneth R. Craycraft, "Christ's Counter-Kingdom: Why Public Theology Is a Bad Idea," Regeneration Quarterly 1, no. 1 (winter 1995): 19. 110. For instance, Stackhouse argues that "[i]n the West, [public theology] is the tradition forged first by the confluence of Hebraic faith and Greek philosophy and present in vari ous degrees and modulating forms in the thought of Augustine, Thomas, Calvin, Wesley, Locke, Edwards, Jacques Maritain, John Courtney Murray, the Niebuhrs, Martin Luther King, and others. It is a tradition which is neglected today and which desperately needs to</page><page sequence="38">92 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. be revived, in new terms appropriate to our present dilemmas, if religious freedom and human rights are to be carried into the future." Stackhouse, "Religious Freedom and Hu man Rights," 103-5. 111. Benne, Stackhouse, and Thiemann have all incorporated discussion of public theologies and public theologians of the past and present into their methodological discussions and constructive public theologies. For example, see Benne, The Paradoxical Vision-, Stack house, Public Theology and Political Economy-, and Thiemann, Constructing a Public Theology. 112. As my preceding discussion of public theology and related terms shows, a variety of public theology definitions and descriptions exists. Nevertheless, there is an overlapping consen sus about public theology's central features, among those who are not explicidy opposed to it, that generally supports the definition of public theology I propose here, although many of public theology's proponents may well disagree with one or more aspects of this definition. 113. Public theology's advocates generally intend it to be at least understandable to those out side its own religious tradition. As Ronald F. Thiemann notes: "There has been a great deal of discussion in academic theology about 'public theology.' Most of that debate has focused on the question of whether theological arguments are available for public exami nation and whether theological assertions are intelligible beyond the confines of a partic ular religious community." Thiemann, Constructing a Public Theology, 173. Many critics and some advocates of public theology reject the premise that some forms of theology can be intelligible or persuasive to those outside the faith traditions from which they arise. Linell Cady, who is a proponent of public theology, takes such a position: "Given the his toricity of all reflection, no discourse should expect or hope to be universally intelligible let alone persuasive. Public theology, eschewing the impossible ideal of universal intelligi bility, will situate itself within a recognizable tradition and communicate primarily, al though not exclusively, to inhabitants of that tradition." Cady, Religion, Theology, and American Public Life, 26. However, most do not claim that public theology should also in tend to be persuasive to those beyond its own community. Max Stackhouse is a notable exception and argues more consistently and forcefully than others that public theology should seek to be both intelligible and persuasive to those outside its own faith tradition as well as to those within it: "This is one reason we inevitably need what I and others call a public theology, a warranted discourse about these judgments that is able both to per suade those who may not agree on social, philosophical, or religious grounds and to offer plausible, defensible guidelines for personal and social decisions." Max L. Stackhouse, Covenant and Commitments: Faith, Family, and Economic Life (Louisville, KY: Westmin ster/fohn Knox Press, 1997), 7. 114. For example: "Public theology, I think, refers to the engagement of a living religious tradi tion with its public environment—the economic, political, and cultural spheres of our common life." Benne, The Paradoxical Vision, 4. "Public theology is the deliberate use of distinctively theological commitments to influence substantive public debate and policy." Anderson, "The Search for Public Theology in the United States," 20. See also the list of "aspects of public life," about which public theology should be concerned, in Green, "Bonhoeffer's 'Non-Religious Christianity'," 275. 115. Publicly available "criteria of adequacy" for theology have been one of David Tracy's main concerns. See, for example, Tracy, The Analogical Imagination, chap. 1. Many others draw upon Tracy's work and share his interest in publicly available criteria and warrants for the ology. For instance, Robert Simons notes that Tracy "has distinguished three 'publics'— society,... the academy,... and the Church," and concurs with Tracy's goal of intelligibility beyond confessional communities. "In general, the criteria for public theology will be as accessible outside of, as within, church communities." Simons, Competing Gospels, xv. It is understood, though, that public theology will not necessarily be understood by every</page><page sequence="39">To Tell the Truth • 93 member of society: "A public theology, of course, does not mean a theology that is intelli gible to every single person, the way a public park is open to all. As a form of critical reflec tion, it presupposes a literate, informed audience." Cady, "H. Richard Niebuhr and the Task of a Public Theology," 126. Stackhouse, however, thinks that one of public theol ogy's main purposes is to develop, not presuppose, an informed public—one equipped to make sound public theological judgments and to act upon them: "The first task of a public theology, thus, is to help the public develop the capacity to discern the difference between decent religiously rooted positions and indecent ones and to inspire them to enact the for mer." Stackhouse, "Religious Freedom and Human Rights," 106-7. 116. "This effort to search out ways in which religious faith may have public policy implica tions has engaged religious people in what has come to be called 'public theology,' namely the articulation of a socially significant meaning of a particular tradition or a particular set of religious symbols." Mooney, Public Virtue, 3. In practice though, public theology oper ates along a sliding scale of publicness, depending in part upon the particular audience to which it is addressed. That is, every occurrence of public theology need not be directed to all members of a society. For example, a given instance of public theology may be in tended primarily for a particular congregation, denomination, religious tradition (e.g., Christian, Jewish, Islamic), area of society (e.g., families, schools, government), profes sion, body politic, national or international community. Therefore, the public theology preached to a congregation will almost certainly be argued differently and evaluated by a divergent set of warrants than a public theology directed primarily toward a profession, area of society, academic guild, national community, or global audience. Steven Tipton calls attention to some of the various ways in which public theology can be understood; see note 38. 117. "The public theologian searches for a way to make truth claims which can be tested by the public without the public having to assent to everything that the theologian believes." Simons, Competing Gospels, xv. "Public theologians are committed to presenting their understandings of God along with their ethical principles and values to the public for scru tiny, discussion, and possible acceptance." Robert M. Franklin, Another Day's Journey: Black Churches Confronting the American Crisis (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1997), 121-22. 118. "In this book we have tried to do public theology by discussing the social implications, the public significance, of central symbols within the Catholic tradition." Himes and Himes, Fullness of Faith, 25. 119. In his discussion of John Williamson Nevin, Richard Wentz maintains that "as a public theologian, Nevin sought to bring the fullness of Christian history and theology to bear upon" issues he viewed as having public import. Richard E. Wentz, "John Williamson Nevin as Public Theologian," American Presbyterian 69, no. 4 (winter 1991): 297. See also the descriptions of public theologians in note 100. 120. Here I refer to "exclusively confessional theologies" to acknowledge that, while several theologies, such as some of those that subscribe to narrative theology approaches, are so highly confessional as to preclude their participation in public discourse, in ways that in tend to be intelligible and persuasive to those who stand outside their own narrative tradi tion, other forms of confessional theology are not so exclusive and thus do not bar such participation. For example, see "Confessional Public Theology" in Forrester, Truthful Ac tion, 113-16. 121. For example, see Craycraft, "Christ's Counter-Kingdom." 122. For example, see Stanley Hauerwas, "Freedom of Religion: A Subtle Temptation," Soundings 72, no. 2-3 (summer/fall 1989): 317-39; and Alister McGrath, A Passion for Truth: The Intellectual Coherence of Evangelicalism (Downers Grove, IL: InterVarsity Press, 1996), chap. 3.</page><page sequence="40">94 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. 123. Michael Baxter levels this criticism against the public theology Michael and Kenneth Himes call for in Fullness of Faith-. "In the world of the Himeses' 'public theology,' it is as sumed that Christianity must endorse some form of democracy as the least coercive polit ical arrangement. But this is because the paradigm of 'public theology' presupposes that Christianity is not in and of itself political. . . . Theology itself is not political; hence the need for a 'public theology'." Baxter, "The Non-Catholic Character of the 'Public Church'," 256-57. See also note 3. 124. For example, Stackhouse argues that Scripture, tradition, reason, and experience should be the four warrants or "touchstones of authority" for contemporary public theologies. Stackhouse, Public Theology and Political Economy, 4—15. 125. According to Stackhouse, evaluation is a signal feature of public theology. However, few others include such an evaluative component in their descriptions of public theology. "Public Theology also attempts to identify those universal criteria and the warrants for them by which various confessional traditions can be evaluated whenever they presume to guide public behavior, influence public policy, or shape public discourse on social and ethical matters." Stackhouse, "Religious Freedom and Human Rights," 104. 126. Audrey Chapman maintains that "it is important that public theology be well reasoned, informed, and understandable to persons within both the religious and the secular com munity. When public theology appeals to theological beliefs, even when the beliefs are not widely shared, the logical relationship between the beliefs and the conclusions should be comprehensible to believer and nonbeliever alike." Audrey R. Chapman, Unprecedented Choices: Religious Ethics at the Frontiers of Genetic Science (Minneapolis: Fortress Press, 1999), 159. 127. Stackhouse has consistendy argued that public theology is an apologetic task, which he contrasts with confessional, dogmatic, and polemical theology. See, for example, Max L. Stackhouse, "Some Perils of Confessional Theology in Modern Politics," Katallagete 10, no. 1-3 (fall 1987): 66-69. This is a position for which he has been criticized. For exam ple, in reference to Stackhouse's article in the same issue of Katallagete, George Hun singer wrote: "An implausible contrast structures the essay by Max Stackhouse. It is the contrast between 'confessional' and 'public' theology. Whereas the one is strapped with nothing but liabilities, the other brims over with nothing but assets.... [W]e are meant to draw the appropriate conclusion that confessional theology is not public and that public theology is not confessional... . The conclusion fails on both counts. . . . '[P]ublic theol ogy' is confessional and 'confessional theology' public in ways that Stackhouse, in a mo ment of polemical overkill, disallows." George Hunsinger, "To Stackhouse: Turtles All the Way Down," Katallagete 10, no. 1-3 (fall 1987): 102. Recently, however, Stackhouse has nuanced his position somewhat, acknowledging there are "'confessionalist' ap proaches to public theology" and a "wing" of public theology that is "more deeply in debted to the fideist definitions of theology." Max L. Stackhouse, Covenant and Commit ments: Faith, Family, and Ecotiomic Life (Louisville, KY: Westminster/John Knox Press, 1997), 165 n. 20; idem, "Theology, Public," in Dictionary of the Ecumenical Movement, ed. Nicholas Lossky et al., 2d ed. (Geneva: WCC Publications, 2002), 1132. 128. Werner Jeanrond contrasts correlational theology, of which he maintains David Tracy's public theology is one clear example, with the postliberal theology movement associated with Hans Frei and George Lindbeck: "Hence Lindbeck's [postliberal] theology differs from Tracy's ... not only in terms of method, but also in terms of aim. Lindbeck wishes to explicate Christian faith inside the (actual or potential) Christian movement, while the correlational theologians attempt to develop a public rationality of that faith." Werner G.

Theology in a Postliberal Age (Phil adelphia: Westminster Press, 1984). 130. Hauerwas, Against the Nations, 1. 131. "Stackhouse does not deny the central role of revelation for Christian theology.... But he does suggest that criteria outside that revelation must determine its truthfulness: for it to be reasonable it must be assessed to determine whether it is 'more or less compatible with the most universal human understanding of holiness, justice, truth and creativity.' This assumes a criterion of justice and truth more universal than revelation itself. It also privi leges the social scientist's understanding of reality." D. Stephen Long, Divine Economy: Theology and the Market (London and New York: Roudedge, 2000), 50. 132. "I have repeatedly argued that the central theological task is to render the world intelligi ble to Christians. For me the question is not 'How can theologians make Christianity in telligible in the modern world?' but 'How can theologians make sense of the world, given the way we Christians are taught to speak in and through our worship of God?' I therefore have very little sympathy with attempts to translate Christian speech into terms that are assumed to be generally available. I resist that project . . . because I have a number of theological and philosophical misgivings about the very idea of translation." Stanley M. Hauerwas, Wilderness Wanderings: Probing Twentieth-Century Theology and Philosophy (Boulder, CO: Westview Press, 1997), 2-3. See also Baxter, "Blowing the Dynamite of the Church." 133. Although Christian Scripture and tradition is often available to non-Christians, or can be made available to them, such sources of insight are generally not authoritative for those outside the Christian tradition in the same way or to the same extent they are for those in side it. Of course, Christians are not of one mind as to the relative level of authority in or accorded to Scripture and tradition. 134. William C. Placher makes this point with respect to revisionist theology, as exemplified by the work of David Tracy. "Revisionist theology views with suspicion the appeal to war rants available only to Christians." Placher, "Revisionist and Postliberal Theologies," 407. 135. For example: "A vigorous and effective public theology will not spring from our resolve, however earnest, to infuse the polis with our brand of medicine, or to cover it with the can opy of a reconstituted tradition. Such a project will founder on the bondage of the will from which Christ alone saves. The only public voice the church has is the proclamation of Christ crucified, the one who died 'while we were yet sinners.' That voice is sufficient; and that voice, please God, will be heard."

"Stackhouse does not think religion necessarily will provide the new kind of public theol ogy necessary to provide the basis for liberty, but he thinks theology might. By theology he means 'the ongoing public discussion of how we can tell the difference between a de cent and an indecent religion, between those which lead to chaos or totalitarianism and those that lead to human rights and pluralistic democracies.'" Stanley Hauerwas, "Free dom of Religion: A Subtle Temptation," Soundings 72, no. 2-3 (summer/fall 1989): 322. Hauerwas then quotes from p. 25 of Stackhouse's "Piety, Polity, and Policy," and in the footnote adds: "This understanding of theology sounds very much like Enlightenment ideology." Ibid., 338 n. 24. 137. "'Public theology' is also worrisome on other grounds. Most especially, I worry that it is ultimately instrumentalist, despite its best intentions. Although Stackhouse is capable of</page><page sequence="42">96 • E. Harold Breitenberg, Jr. expressing excellent anti-instrumentalist convictions, [Hunsinger cites "The Location of the Holy" and "An Ecumenist's Plea"] the logic of 'public theology' is usually an instru mentalist logic. Whereas anti-instrumentalism is the declared policy, instrumentalism is, I'm afraid, the operational policy. How could it be otherwise? . . ." Hunsinger, "To Stackhouse," 103. 138. "Relative to one of a number of things going on in Swift Hall [i.e., the building that houses the University of Chicago Divinity School] from which I dissent, it is interesting to note that the [U.S. Catholic] bishops did not need to forge a hermeneutical theory, or a theory about a 'public theology,' or a moral theory on which all rational persons could agree ... in order to write a document [i.e., The Challenge of Peace] that has been taken very seriously by some important persons in public life. Nor is it clear that if the bishops had had such theories their efforts would have achieved either lesser or greater public impact. It is apparently harder for the Church to participate in American life in principle, than it is in fact." James M. Gustafson, "The Bishops' Pastoral Letter: ATheological Ethical Anal ysis," Criterion 23, no. 2 (spring 1984): 10. See also James M. Gustafson, foreword to Radi cal Monotheism and Western Culture by H. Richard Niebuhr, Library of Theological Ethics (Louisville, KY: Westminster/John Rnox Press, 1993), 7. 139. For example: "In my reading, the very question, 'What is the role of religion in public life?' has so far been the almost exclusive territory of self-identified religious people stak ing out claims on how their insights into the way in which nations ought to work can be put into practice. What we should note from the outset is that the very phrasing of the question already presumes that the issue of what exactly religion is has already been set tled; for virtually no one in this debate presumes that religion is the result of alienation from socio-economic relations (Marx and Engels), that religion is an illusory practice of wish fulfillment (Freud), that religious practices and stories symbolically deny the contin gency and transience of life and human institutions (Bloch), that religion is but one spe cies of anthropomorphism (Guthrie), or that religion is but an evolutionary developed mechanism (Burkert). If any of these alternative options were seriously entertained, then undoubtedly many people would argue that religion must be kept far from the mecha nisms whereby decisions in a culturally, economically, and technologically diverse/com plex nation are made." McCutcheon, "A Default of Critical Intelligence?" 444-H5. 140.

For example, the many publications that address public theology from the perspective of disciplines other than church history, theology, and ethics, and the various ways in which the term is used in nonacademic settings, such as denominational materials and the popu lar press, can create understandings of public theology outside the field of theological eth ics different from those inside it.</page></plain_text>
