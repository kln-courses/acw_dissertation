<plain_text><page sequence="1">UNDER THE VOLCANO: VOLCANIC MYTH AND METAPHOR IN VERGIL'S AENEID BY PATRICIA A. JOHNSTON POETIC DESCRIPTIONS of volcanic activity and its causes are found throughout classical literature. Of the two main mythological explanations, one held that volcanic eruptions are caused by the Titan or Giant Typhoeus who was cast into Tartarus after his unsuccessful attempt to overthrow Zeus and his reign, and that the volcano Aetna was then placed on top of him to pin him down. In this version, the eruptions are the result of a still-smoldering fire from Zeus' lightning bolt, which occasionally erupts from the mountain, spewing destruction far and wide. The second mythological explanation is that Vulcan has his workshop at the base of a volcano, and that he is assisted there by divine blacksmiths, the giant, one-eyed Cyclopes. Under Vulcan's direction they produce the weapons with which Zeus controls the universe. The location of Vulcan's workshop is often identified as Mt. Aetna, but the tradition allows for more than one workshop site, including Lemnos, where the god landed after being thrown from Olympos ( Iliad I. 590-4; XVIII. 395 ff.), Lipari (Callim., Hymn 3. 46 ff.; cf. Cic. de nat. deorum 3. 22) and, in Vergil's Aeneid (8. 416-22), the island Vulcano. Homer, moreover, makes no reference to volcanoes: in Iliad XVIII. 462ff., Hephaistos' workshop is on Mt. Olympos; in Odyssey 9. 113-14 the Cyclopes are said to dwell on the summits of lofty mountains in hollow caves,1 but there is no reference to volcanoes in the Polyphemus Vomer's Cyclopes enjoy an existence which is not very distant from the existence enjoyed by Hesiod's golden race and race of heroes and has close parallels to the Saturnian race governed by Latinus when Aeneas arrives in Italy. Cf. Latinus' words: neve ignorate Latinos! Saturni geniem haud vinclo пес legibus aequamj sponte sua veterisque dei se more tenentem, ( Aen . 7. 201-2) and Evander's description of this golden race: aurea quae perhibent ilio sub rege fuere/ saecula: sic placida populos in pace regebat,/ deterior donec paulatim ac decolor aetas/ et belli rabies et amor successif habendi. (Aen. 8. 324-327). Cf. R. Seaford, Euripidis Cyclops (Oxford 1984) 53-54, who compares Homer's race of Cyclopes to the 'progressive' image of primitive man found in late fifth century Athens. For discussion of the golden age in Vergil, cf. V. Schmidt, Redeunt Saturnia Regna: Vergilius 42 (1996) 55-65</page><page sequence="2">56 PATRICIA A. JOHNSTON episode. Theocritus, too, makes no reference to volcanoes in his eleventh Idyl, which Ovid later elaborates in Metamorphoses 13. 750ff.2 Hesiod's account in the Theogony of the struggle between Zeus and the Giant Typhoeus provides some of the details which are subsequently common in describing volcanic activity. During this struggle, earth, heaven, the seas and the underworld tremble, suggesting the earthquakes that accompany eruptions, and the fiery disruption caused by volcanoes is suggested in the fire and near-chaos that occur as Zeus gathers all his powers, including his burning bolts of lightning (ßpovTriv те атброттг|У те ка' Kepauvóv, Th. 854), to defeat this monstrous creature. When Typhoeus is finally conquered he is hurled down "so that the huge earth groaned" (oTeváxiÇe Se yaïa ттеЛсорг), Th. 858). Flame shoots forth from him, causing a large part of the earth to melt, just as tin melts, or iron is softened "by the strength of Hephaestos" (867) and Zeus casts him into Tartaros.3 Hesiod elsewhere speaks of the Cyclopes as divine craftsmen who create Zeus' bolts, again without reference to volcanic activity. He tells us that among the Titans were the Cyclopes "overbearing in spirit: Brontes the thunderer, Steropes the lightener, and stubborn-hearted Arges, the bright one," and that they made Zeus's lightning and thunder-bolts ( Th . 139-141; cf. Th. 854, above). Euripides' satyr-play Cyclops, is a dramatization of the encounter between Odysseus and Polyphemos. Here there are frequent references to Aetna, and Odysseus, preparing to burn out the Cyclops' eye, addresses Hephaistos as âvaÇ A'iTvaïe, a clear allusion to Aetna's fiery nature as well as to the god's close association with fire. Because of the marked difference of plot, Seaford concludes that the location of the Cyclopes in Sicily near Aetna is not Homeric, although the idea is not original with Euripides, since Thucidydes (6.2) says that Cyclopes and Laistrygonians inhabit part of the island, and Strabo (1. 2. 9) places them in the region around Aetna and Leontini.4 Apollonius of Rhodes Studien zu Vergils vierter Ecloga, (Groeningen 1977); P.

Cf. also Seaford p. 99</page><page sequence="3">UNDER THE VOLCANO 57 ( Argo 1. 730) depicts the Cyclopes as blacksmiths, forging Zeus's bolt from fire. Vergil later expands the constituents of Zeus' fulmen so that it consists of all the elements of a storm: rain, cloud, and wind, as well as fire, the sole element in Apollonius.5 Pindar, like Hesiod, places the defeated Giant, Typhoeus, in Tartarus, and says further that Typhoeus is held in place by Mt. Aetna,6 his chest weighted down "by the sea-bound hills off Cumae and by Sicily;" by day Typhoeus sends a fiery mass of reddened smoke from springs of terrible fire and by night the red flame loudly whirls rocks into the sea (Pyth. 1. 22-24). In Pindar, too, is seen the later fascination of poets and philosophers with the contradictory features of volcanoes, which for them embodied extremes of physical qualities, between hot and cold, for example, or between liquid and solid: "Snow-clad Aetna nurses biting frost on her peak throughout the year, while pure streams of fire flow from within her caves" ( Pyth 1. 20-22). Aeschylus, in a passage modelled on Pindar Pyth. 1. 17ff., places Typhoeus beneath Aetna, and also places Hephaestus, as a smith, on top of Mt. Aetna.7 ad Cyclops , 20. 5 Prometheus, it is interesting to note, is being punished for bringing fire to the mortal race. Fire imagery is of course conspicuous in the second half of Vergil's epic, associated with the ira of Allecto and her victims. When Allecto appears to Turnus, she takes the form of his nurse, Chalybe (7. 419), a name which C. J. Fordyce (P. Vergili Maronis, Aeneidos: Libri VII-VIII [Oxford 1977]) notes is not uncommon. Vergil later speaks of the Chalybes (8. 421; cf. Geo. 1. 58: Chalybes nudi &lt;mittunt&gt; fer rum), a reference to a tribe of ironworkers on the shore of the Black Sea, the legendary discoverers of iron-working. In 8. 446, Vergil coins in Latin the word chalybs , from the Greek word for hardened iron (cf. Fordyce ad 8. 421 and 429). Vergil thus establishes the sequence of fiery Allecto under the guise of Chalybe in book 7, followed by Chalybum , and finally the coinage ( vulnificus ) chalybs to denote the metal in the new arms for Aeneas (8. 446). 6 Pindar Pyth. 1. 17ff; cf. also Ol. 4. 7-8. 7 циброктиттеТ 'HqxxiOTOç, Aesch. P. В. 366-7. Cf. M. Griffith, Aeschylus: Prometheus Bound (Cambridge 1983) ad 363-372. Thucydides 3.116 indicates that Etna erupted in 427 B.C. and had previously erupted about fifty years earlier; Griffith, ad 363-72, indicates that Pindar's Pythian 1 was performed in the celebration of the new city, Aetna, built on the remains of Catana, which had been destroyed by the earlier eruption (either 479 or 475 B.C.) to which Thucydides refers; cf. M. Griffith, "Aeschylus, Sicily, and Prometheus," in Dionysiaca : Nine Studies Presented to Sir Deny s Page, edd. R. D. Dawe et al. (Cambridge 1978) 105-139. Among Roman poets who place Typhoeus directly under Mt. Aetna are Ovid (Met. 5. 352), Seneca (Med. 410), Statius (Theb. 1. 458) and Valerius Flaccus (2. 29).</page><page sequence="4">58 PATRICIA A. JOHNSTON Later poets, including Lucretius and the anonymous author of the first century A. D. poem, Aetna, with its strong Lucretian echoes, attempted to demythologize the phenomenon, but its features - "hard stone that melts and becomes liquid, and then flows between river- banks, and finally hardens into a substance that will never again allow the river-banks to be separated". {Aetna 534-535) - phenomena such as this were too dramatic to be restrained to non-mythological interpretation. Vergil, to the extent that Lucretius persuaded Romans to cast aside these mythological associations, can be said to have "remythologized"8 Lucretius' volcanoes for posterity. In doing so, he dwelt upon the two main mythical conceptions with regard to volcanic eruptions, the first of them being the idea that there is a Giant or Titan at the base of the volcano, and, second, that the volcano is Vulcan's workshop. The details concerning this phenomenon which Vergil incorporates into his works reflect the poet's general practice in recounting traditional tales.9 Vergil's earliest allusion to volcanoes occurs in the fourth book of the Georgics, in a passage (170-75) concerned with the art of beekeeping. There Vergil compares the teamwork of the tiny, well- organized bees to the skillful movements of Zeus's divine smiths as they forge his weapons. In this account the forge is located in Mt. Aetna: gemit impositis incudibus Aetna (Geo. 4. 173). 10 In Aeneid 3, however, Vergil retains the tradition that a Titan is under Mt. Aetna, but here this Titan is named Enceladus (3. 578), a name in itself descriptive of the terrible noise (ó KÉÂaSoç) an eruption would make. In Aeneid 9, Pindar's Typhoeus reappears, but now he is instead placed under the volcanic island, Ischia ( lnarime , 9. 716), and Vergil moves Vulcan's workshop from Mt. Aetna to Vulcano, an island located between Lipari (where Callimachus had placed the workshop) and Mt. Aetna. The Cyclopes working in Vulcan's workshop in Aeneid 8, on the island Vulcano, are named, as in Hesiod, Steropes and Brontes, but instead of Arges, the third Cyclops is named "Pyracmon." A possible reason for this name change may be found in Hesiod's statement ( Theog . 146), that "strength, might and craft (ioxùç 8' ř|8é ßir| ка' urixavai)" were in the Cyclopes' works; the name, "Brontes" means "thunder," but 8 The term is from P. R. Hardie, Virgil's Aeneid: Cosmos and Imperium (Oxford 1986) 178. 9 For examples of Vergil's mythical elaborations, cf. I. M. Linforth, The Arts of Orpheus (Berkeley 1941) 11-21; P. A. Johnston, "Eurydice and Proserpina in The Georgics," ТАРА 107 (1977) 161-72. 10 Callim. Hymn 4, 141, places both the giant Briares and the workshop under Aetna.</page><page sequence="5">UNDER THE VOLCANO 59 "Steropes" and "Arges" both denote the flash of lightning. Vergil's substitution may have been an effort to add something denoting their particular skill, since "Pyracmon" combines the Greek words for fire (m/p) and anvil (йкцсои).11 VERGIL'S VOLCANOES In the third book of the Aeneid, an eruption of Aetna is taking place at the very time when the Trojans, having just eluded the dangers of Scylla and Charybdis, sail into a harbor on the coast of Sicily which is "unstirred by the wind" (3. 570), but the noise and drama of Aetna's eruption contrast starkly with the stillness of the harbor. The sky is black with pitch and glowing ash; balls of flame shoot up and "lick" the constellations ( sidera lambii, 574). Aetna, we are told, is "vomiting up" ( eructans , 576) boulders and liquid rocks. These boulders, like the very "entrails of the mountain" (avulsa... viscera mentis, 575) are said to have been "ripped out" in the course of this violent regurgitation. "According to rumor," says Aeneas to Dido and her guests, "the scorched body of Enceladus is restrained here." The fire itself, according to the tradition, was kindled by the initial bolt of fire which cast the Giant down to Tartarus; it lives on, smoldering and periodically bursting into flame. "Aetna," Aeneas continues, "which lies on top of him, exhales flames when the subterranean fires erupt, and every time he adjusts his body all of Sicily trembles and rumbles and the sky grows dark with smoke." ( Aen . 3. 578-582). The combined physiology of a quasi-human Mt. Aetna and of the Titan Enceladus produce what will be referred to in this paper as "Enceladian Aetna," the one part (Aetna) "licking" the stars and vomiting its innards while the other part (the Titan) shifts his uncomfortable position. There is a later parallel in Book 9 to this notion of an Enceladian Aetna: there Vergil briefly describes the durum cubile of Typhoeus under Ischia (Inarime, Aen. 9. 715-16). In book 3, however, Enceladian Aetna anticipates the appearance on the following day of Polyphemus - huge, angry, and blinded. He and his fellow Cyclopes line the shore as the Trojans slip safely away. Achaemenides, an abandoned Greek soldier who escapes with the Trojans, has already described the drunken Polyphemus in terms similar to Aeneas' anthropomorphic description of Enceladian Aetna erupting. Like Enceladus, Polyphemus lies sprawled asleep in his cave: iacuit per 11 Cf. Hes. Theog. 722, 724; Fordyce ad Aen. 8. 425.</page><page sequence="6">60 PATRICIA A. JOHNSTON antrum / immensus ( Aen . 3. 63 1-2). 12 He is glutted with food (including a goodly number of Odysseus' companions) and wine. As he fills the cave with his enormous size he vomits ( iacuit...eructans , 631-632) gore and pieces of his victims mingled with crusts of bread and blood-red wine. Vergil has carefully juxtaposed these accounts, showing both Polyphemus and Aetna as destructive, hideous monsters, regurgitating their innards, and bringing utter ruin ( horrificis...ruinis ) to all who come too near to them. Volcanic characteristics such as those found in Polyphemus have been found in a number of other Vergilian characters.13 One character in particular with these characteristics is Cacus (Aen. 8.190ff.), the monstrous shepherd who is terrorizing the future site of Rome when Hercules arrives there, leading his booty, the cattle of Geryon. Cacus is so taken by the beauty of these cattle that he steals some of them while Hercules sleeps. When Hercules awakens and fails to discover where they have gone, the cattle in Cacus' cave low to their departing fellow- cattle, with the result that Hercules finds and frees them, and attacks and kills Cacus. Cacus, like Polyphemus, is a shepherd, huge in physical size, something less than human (Cacus is referred to as both semihomo, "half-man," 8.194, and semiferus, "half-beast," 8.267). Both dwell in caves, and getting into or out of their caves requires some kind of ruse - Odysseus and his men tied themselves to the blinded Polyphemus' rams to escape, and Cacus almost succeeds in tricking Hercules with the cattle's versis...indiciis (8, 210-211). Cacus, it is interesting to note, is a son of Vulcan: huic monstro Volcanus erat pater: illius atros ore vomens ignis magna se mole ferebat. (Aen. 8. 198-9) He vomits black fire from his mouth, a feature which is mentioned when he is fighting with Hercules ( incendia vana vomentum, 259), and again when he is dead: 12 Cf. the Homeric phrase, (кеТто) MÉyocç ЦЕуаЛсоот(, e.g., II. 16. 776; 18. 26, Od. 24. 40 etc. Cf.

Cacus dwells in a cave to which the sun has no access, and after Hercules rips open the cave and exposes it to the light of day, it is as if he has laid bare the depths of the underworld itself: non secus ac si qua penitus vi terra dehiscens infernas reseret sedes et regna recludat pallida, dis invisa, superque immane barathrum cernatur, trepident immisso lumine Manes. С Aen . 8. 243-246)14 Thus Cacus may be said, like Typhoeus and Enceladus, to inhabit a dwelling which extends down into Tartarus. His fiery breath and the dark caverns in which he dwells place him, like Polyphemus, in the metaphorical world of Enceladian Aetna. His relationship to Vulcan renews our awareness that the god of fire is ever-changeable: recall Aeneid 2.31 If., where Vulcan himself is seen destroying Troy, albeit by metonymy: Volcano superante domus, iam proximus ardet / Ucalegon. Vergil elsewhere depicts volcanic activity as evidence of Vulcan's well-run workshop at the heart of the volcano. Whereas in book three the Cyclops Polyphemus and Enceladian Aetna are juxtaposed, in book eight (as in Geòrgie 4. 170-75) the Cyclopes and the volcano have been integrated. In both Aeneid 8 and Geòrgie 4 the Cyclopes instigate volcanic activity by heating iron, beating it into shape, and tempering it in cool water; hence the flames, sound and steam produced by a volcano. This activity produces items which can 14 Hercules kills Cacus when he is returning from his battle with Geryon, a battle which has been shown to be another version of Hercules' visit to the underworld and his victory there. Hercules is of course a model for Aeneas, who has also recently returned from the underworld. K. Galinsky, The Herakles Theme: The Adaptations of the Hero in Literature from Homer to the Twentieth Century (Totowa NJ 1972) 126-152, 143-145, and others have argued that the struggle between Hercules and Cacus foreshadows the coming struggle between Aeneas and Turnus.</page><page sequence="8">62 PATRICIA A. JOHNSTON be productive or harmful, but always with a purpose, as opposed to the brutal, widespread destruction erupting from an angry, imprisoned monster, in the other explanation of volcanic activity. Not only do the Cyclopes forge the lightning-bolts with which Zeus imposes orderly rule on the world, but they also make unusual products which affect the behavior of mortals and the course of human affairs (although not always for the better), such as the arms of Achilles ( Iliad 17. 462ff.) and Aeneas' arms ( Aen . 8. 407ff.).15 In book eight of the Aeneid, in a scene closely modelled on the arms-making scene in the Iliad (17. 462ff.), Venus persuades Vulcan to make a new set of arms for Aeneas. When Vulcan arises, he is compared to the good housewife who gets up at dawn to begin her chores; her first act is to resuscitate the fire on the hearth: cum femina primum...cinerem et sopitos suscitât ignis/ ... haud secus ignipotens nec tempore segnior ilio mollibus e stratis opera ad fabrilia surgit. (Aen. 8.408-415) She awakens ( suscitât ) the ashes and sopitos.. .ignis, literally, "fire that has been lulled to sleep." So, too, the Lord of Fire ( ignipotens ) arises from his soft bed to forge the weapons (415). The limping god goes to his workshop to resuscitate the fires there. Here, however, Vergil identifies a new location for Vulcan's workshop: insula Sicanium iuxta latus Aeoliamque erigitur Liparen fumantibus ardua saxis, quam subter specus et Cyclopum exesa caminis antra Aetnaea tonant, validique incudibus ictus auditi referunt gemitus, striduntque cavernis stricturae Chalybum et fornacibus ignis anhelat. (Aen. 8.416-421) Notice how Vergil delays naming the island initially: he describes the setting, lines 416-417: "An island of steaming rocks stands tall between Sicania and Aeolian Lipari;" he then identifies the activity that takes place there: "Beneath it the Aetna-like ( Aetnaea ) caves hollowed out by the noisy Cyclopes' forges thunder. Mighty blows on the anvils repeatedly echo with moans, again and again, and Chalybaean iron hisses in vats and fire breathes heavily in the furnace" (Aen. 8. 417- 15 Another well-known product constructed by the Cyclopes in Vulcan's workshop was the walls of Elysium (Aen. 6. 630ff.).</page><page sequence="9">UNDER THE VOLCANO 63 421). Finally, in line 422, he provides the island's name, thus making very clear that Aetna is no longer the designated site for the workshop: Volcani domus et Volcania nomine tellus (. Aen . 8. 422). In Georgics IV. 173, the Cyclopes' forge is in Aetna ( gemit impositis incubibus Aetna). In Aeneid 8 Vergil uses the adjective Aetnaea (antra), but clearly designates not Sicily but the island Volcano as the location of these "Aetna-like caves." There appears to be no generic word in Latin for "volcano" or "volcanic."16 It is conceivable that Vergil may here be using the adjective, aetnaeus , (which does appear in Greek, but with specific reference to the volcano, Mt. Aetna)17 to create a generic term, meaning something like "volcanic."18 The "moans" ( gemitus ) from within the volcano again tend to give it a certain human quality, as the details of Aetna's tortured "body" does in Aeneid 3, where the Giant Enceladus and Aetna become one. The "panting" of the fire in line 420 ( anhelat ) suggests the sound of the Cyclopes' bellows in the Georgics simile, where tiny craftscreatures (honey bees) and huge craftscreatures (Cyclopes) are compared. The passage describing the workshop in Aeneid 8 indicates that at that particular time, the Cyclopes were working on an informatum...fulmen , a bolt not yet completed, for Jupiter, which already bears colorful detail. Their project is interrupted by Vulcan's arrival and instructions to set aside this fulmen while they forge new weapons for Aeneas. Here the description of the Cyclopes' teamwork is almost a verbatim repetition of Georgics 4. 171-175: 16 Yolcaneus means "fiery," not "volcanic." Pliny, in his famous letter (VI. 16) describing the eruption of Mt. Vesuvius, refers to it only in terms of its appearance and its disastrous effect. The name "Volcanus" is derived from the Etruscan VELKHAN, a god of destructive fire. Roman Vulcan is more often identified as the equivalent of the Etruscan god SETHLANS, who is associated with productive fire. Stoltenberg indicates that this Vulcan is also the god of the Hearth-Fire; cf. Aen. 8 408-415, above; H. L. Stoltenberg, Etruskische Gottnamen (Leverkusen 1957) 66-71; V. I. Georgiev, La Lingua e L'Origine degli Etrusci (Roma 1979) 126. 17 E. g., Euripides Cyclops 20: Tf|vS' èç Aixvaíav ттетрау. 18 Another way to interpret Aetnaea antra would be to assume, as Mynors appears to do, that all the volcanoes in the Lipari islands are interconnected by subterranean caves. The entire area is of course riddled with caves, which would provide a basis for Mynors' assumption. Cf. R. A. B. Mynors, Virgil: Georgics (Oxford 1990) 280-1 ad Geo. 4. 170-5.</page><page sequence="10">64 PATRICIA A. JOHNSTON alii ventosis follibus auras accipiunt redduntque, alii stridentia tingunt aera lacu; gemit impositis incudibus antrum ; illi inter sese multa vi bracchia tollunt in numerum, versantque tenaci forcipe massam. (Aen. 8. 449-453) Three words differ from the Georgics passage - taurinis {Geo. 4. 171) here becomes ventosis; Aetna (Geo. 4. 173) here becomes antrum , and ferrum (Geo. 4. 175) here becomes massam. The substitution of massam for ferrum may not be significant, particularly since the introduction of the Georgics simile already includes massis: ac veluti lentis Cyclopes fulmina massis / cum properant, "just as when the Cyclopes forge thunderbolts from flexible lumps" (presumably, lumps of iron) (Geo. 4. 170). Vergil may have intended ventosis to emphasize the windiness already closely associated in the Aeneid with this location, since Volcano is one of the Aeolian islands, and Aeolus, who controls the winds, set them free in this area at the beginning of the Aeneid, thus blowing the Trojans off course to Carthage.19 The change from Aetna to antrum, would also be appropriate in Aeneid 8, since Vergil has moved the site of Vulcan's forge away from Aetna. Modern vulcanologists distinguish different types of volcanic activity and volcanoes: some erupt dramatically and seriously damage the surrrounding terrain and its inhabitants, as Vesuvius did in A.D. 79. Others, like Stromboli, erupt with great frequency, shooting sparks and debris into the area as frequently as every fifteen minutes, but do relatively little damage, since the debris settles back into their cones, rising repeatedly. Others, like Solfatara, vent only gases. But with each major eruption the character of a volcano can change dramatically, depending on the aftermath - a volcano with an unobstructed vent can become obstructed, forcing the magma to work its way out through different channels, or the reverse can happen, and so forth.20 The activity of any given volcano varies considerably, so that references to the same volcano can signify very different kinds of activity. Vergil seems to be attempting to draw distinctions between various kinds of volcanic activity in Aeneid 3 and 8: one behaves more like the Enceladian-type of volcano, suggesting an angry Giant beneath it, while 19 In the Georgics 4 simile, the close ties between men and cattle is emphasized; in addition, at the conclusion of that poem, a hive of bees is born out of a cow's corpse, thus making the choice of taurinis more appropriate there. 20 Cf. F. M. Bullard, Volcanoes of the Earth, 2nd ed. (Austin 1984) 184-255; Roberto Santacroce, "Understanding Vesuvius; A Proposed Model," forthcoming.</page><page sequence="11">UNDER THE VOLCANO 65 another suggests there is something constructive going on within, such as the workshop of Vulcan. The differences in the personalities of the Cyclopes whom Vergil associates with these particular volcanoes - the hard-working, creative smithies on the one hand, and the cruel Polyphemus on the other - serve to underscore that difference.21 BRANDEIS UNIVERSITY 21 Earlier versions of this paper were presented in Cuma, Italy, at the Vergilian Society Symposium, "The Cultural Response to the Volcanic Landscape," October 1996, and at the Classical Association of New England in April 1996.
