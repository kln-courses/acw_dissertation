<plain_text><page sequence="1">Kerstin Ekman. Hunden. Henrik Krogh, ill. Stockholm. Bonniers. 1986. 112 pages, ill. Since completing her tetralogy about the growth and develop- ment of the town of Katrineholm - Haxringarna (Magic Cir- cles; 1974), Springkallan (The Spring; 1976), Anglahuset (Angel House; 1979; see WLT 54:2, p. 295), and En stad av ljus (A City of Light; 1983; see WLT 58:3, p. 429)- a major achievement in con- temporary Swedish literature, Kerstin Ekman (see WLT 55:2, pp. 204-9) has published a nonfiction work on the inaugural speeches of members of the Swedish Academy, to which she herself belongs, and now the short narrative Hunden (The Dog). The story is simple: a puppy becomes separated from its mother in the deep snow one late-winter evening in a remote part of northern Sweden but man- ages, through a combination of serendipity and skill, to survive in the wild for more than a year until a patient man gradually tames him again. Although the account is largely from the perspective of the dog, the author does not make the mistake of pretending to understand or identify with its reactions completely, nor does she fall victim to sentimentality or anthropomorphism. Her sensitivity to nuances of the natural world and her supple prose - laconic and spare but simultaneously evocative and moving - ensures that Hunden is not just a "dog story" but may be read with pleasure by those for whom the canine species holds no innate fascination. The black-and-white illustrations by Henrik Krogh admirably capture the solitary beauty of the Norrland landscape. Rochelle Wright</page></plain_text>
