<plain_text><page sequence="1">American Dante Bibliography for 1998 CHRISTOPHER KLEINHENZ bibliography is intended to include all the Dante translations published in this country in 1998 and all Dante studies and re- views published in 1998 that are in any sense American. The latter criterion is construed to include foreign reviews of American publi- cations pertaining to Dante. The listing of reviews in general is selective, particularly in the case of studies bearing only peripherally on Dante. Items cited from Dissertation Abstracts International are generally regis- tered without further abstracting, since the titles tend to be self-explana- tory. Items not recorded in the bibliographies for previous years are entered as addenda to the present list. Generally, the citation of an individual study from a collected volume representing several authors is given in brief, while the main entry of the volume is listed with full bibliographical data in its alphabetical order. Issues of this journal under the former title Annual Report of the Dante Society continue to be cited in the short form of Report, with volume number. Special thanks go to the team of associate bibliographers who have assumed responsibility for the annotation of many of the items listed herein. The Society is very grateful to the following scholars for their invaluable expertise and for their continuing contributions to the journal: Fabian Alfie (The University of Arizona), V.

"For Want of a Nail: The Guerri-Lanza-Cursietti Argu- ment regarding the Tenzone." In Dante Studies, 116 (1998), 141-159. Examines the theory which posits that Dante and Forese Donati did 246</page><page sequence="3">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz not author the tenzone, but rather, that a poet of the Quattrocento did. According to this thesis, at some point between 1390 and 1406, a comic poet, probably Stefano Finiguerri nicknamed "il Za," decided to slander a homosexual couple by composing all six sonnets of the tenzone and publishing them. However intriguing this opinion might be, it faces one serious problem: one manuscript containing exemplars from the tenzone, Chigiano L. VIII. 305, may have been produced not in the fifteenth cen- tury, but around the middle of the Trecento. Alfie examines the codex in an attempt to determine the plausibility of the "Za" hypothesis. He begins by noting that other scholars who have studied the Chigiano codex have independently arrived at similar dates for its completion, c. 1360. He then points out a number of traits which would correspond to the mid-four- teenth-century date of composition: its Gothic handwriting (the chancery minuscule was disdained by the Humanists of the late Trecento), the vir- tual absence in the manuscript of authors after the 1340s, and, finally, the fact that the manuscript closes with six sonnets attributed to "Franciescho Petracchi," and not to "Petrarca," the melodious pen-name the poet began using between 1338 and 1340. Alfie concludes that these character- istics indicate that the codex was completed far too early for the "Za" theory to work. [FA] . "Love and Poetry: Reading Boccaccio's Filostrato as a Medieval Parody." In Forum Italicum, 32.2 (Fall, 1998), 347-374. Proposes a reading of Boccaccio's narrative poem, // Filostrato, not as a tragedy, but as a traditional, medieval comedy. While much of the study examines that work by itself from this perspective, it does propose that the parodied intertext is none other than Dante's Vita Nuova. Therefore, it performs a reading of Dante's libello to better understand the satiric nature of// Filostrato. For example, Boccaccio's poem begins with a prose prologue which purports to address the question of whether seeing the beloved lady, speaking of her, or thinking about her, is the highest stage of love. According to Alfie, these three possibilities represent the intra nos, extra nos, and supra nos phases of love. In contrast to Dante, however, Boccaccio's narrator asserts that he had believed that thinking about the woman was the greatest form of love until his beloved began vacationing away from her hometown. Now, bereft of her, he realizes his mistake, and knows that seeing her - the most physical of the three options - represents love's apex. Thus, Boccaccio overturns Dante's hierarchy of 247</page><page sequence="4">Dante Studies, CXVII, 1999 values, placing the lowest above the highest. Furthermore, the author of the article notes Boccaccio's repeated parodic appropriation of Dante's language in this passage. Finally, the article closes by asserting that, just as Dante's poetry evolves as he passes through the various stages of love, so too does the Filostrato. As the protagonist progresses from happy to doleful passion, the author includes various lyrical interludes reminiscent of Ca- valcantian and Guinizzellian poetry. Here too, however, Boccaccio de- ploys this language in an ironic manner, illustrating not his indebtedness to Dante, but his parodic distance from him. [FA] Armour, Peter. " 'A ciascun artista l'ultimo suo': Dante and Michelan- gelo." In Lectura Dantis, 22-23 (Spring-Fall, 1998), 141-180. While it was a commonplace to compare Dante and Michelangelo in the Cinquecento, and to cite the influence of Dante's poetry on Michel- angelo's sculpture, painting, and verse, Armour argues that the presence of Dante in Michelangelo's work is actually slighter than traditionally thought. The explicit visual echoes are in fact few, and the extent of Michelangelo's poetic debt to Dante is difficult to discern, since many of the similarities are reducible to conventions of vernacular poetry, the dolce stil novo, or Christian beliefs. Even if verisimilitude is of primary impor- tance to the work of both Dante and Michelangelo, their conceptions of their individual mimetic capacities and their understanding of the hierar- chy of God, nature, and art diverge substantially. Dante's ideal artistic creations exist not in this life, but in the next, while Michelangelo sought to attain to a divine victory over nature in his human art. "For Dante, all human 'arte' strives as far as it can to follow nature . . . and so, in a downward process, it is descended through nature from God," but Mi- chelangelo imagined a kind of art that might "conquer the transience of the natural world in the attempt to detect the Ideal Beauty dispersed throughout natural creation . . . and to render it permanently visible on earth through art."

In Dante Studies, 116 (1998), 31-63. 248</page><page sequence="5">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz In this essay Barolini explores the lyric context of Inferno 5, paying particular attention to how Italian poets like Giacomo da Lentini, Guido delle Colonne, Guittone d'Arezzo, Guido Cavalcanti, and Dante himself had framed the issue of desire insufficiently controlled by reason. Pointing to Cavalcanti's "che la 'ntenzione per ragione vale" as the intertext of Dante's "che la ragion sommettono al talento" (Inf. 5:39), Barolini reads Inferno 5 as a response to Cavalcanti: "Inferno 5 constitutes Dante's most synthetic and compelling meditation on love as a death force, on love as a power that does not defy death but courts it, on love as a dark compulsion that - far from leading us toward salvation - keeps us, as Cavalcanti puts it, 'for di salute'." By looking at the views of love evidenced in Dante's own lyrics, the essay also charts the distance Dante had to traverse before reaching the position of the Commedia. [TB] Barolsky, Paul. "Matilda's Hermeneutics." In Lectura Dantis, 22-23 (Spring-Fall, 1998), 199-202. The figure of Matilda in Botticelli's illustration of Purgatorio 28 visually recalls his earlier depiction of Mercury or Hermes in his painting, Prima- vera: Matilda and Mercury each extend a hand to the sky in an identical gesture. Barolsky argues that the gesture of Primavera s Mercury, however, itself recalls a section of Purgatorio 28 in which Matilda twice refers to dispelling a cloud from Dante's understanding. In his Primavera, Botticelli makes this figure of speech visible: when Mercury extends his arm sky- wards, he appears to disperse the clouds above his head so that the sun shines through and is reflected in his eyes. Botticelli thus transforms the figure of speech into an image by representing the very act of "uncloud- ing," and the resultant moment of spiritual illumination. Turning to Ma- tilda herself in his illustration of the canto, Botticelli preserves Mercury's posture but does not need to render the clouds Mercury dislodges. Ac- cording to Barolsky, the viewer, familiar with Matilda's allusion to the unclouding of the intellect, does not need a visual cue to be reminded of Matilda's discourse. "The conceit of unclouding the intellect, having originally passed from Matilda to Mercury in the Primavera, has now re- turned from the god to the 'enlightened lady' who assumes Mercury's or Hermes's hermeneutical identity as the explicator of divine truth."

"Giants and Fallen Angels in Dante and Milton: The Commedia and the Gigantomachy in Paradise Lost." In Modern Philology, 95, No. 3 (February, 1998), 352-363. Milton uses the battle between the giants and the pagan gods, re- counted in numerous works of classical antiquity, in order to portray Satan and the other fallen angels in Paradise Lost. While critics have noted the numerous classical sources to which Milton's use of the gigantomachy is indebted, they have ignored Dante's Commedia, which proves to have exerted a crucial influence over Milton. The classical accounts of the bat- tle between giants and gods is certainly important, but in Dante - whom Milton knew well - the English poet found the story of the giants sub- jected to Christian recasting; Dante thus compares the giants to the fallen angels and associates them with Satan's fall. In addition, Milton, again like Dante, eliminates the traditional physical deformities of the giants and makes them anthropomorphic, emphasizing their great size. Finally, each poet uses the giants in order to comment on the political tyrannies of his time. [VSB] Campbell, Mary Baine. " 'Nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita': The Palpability of Purgatorio." In Text and Territory: Geographical Imagination in the European Middle Ages, edited by Sylvia Tomasch and Sealy Gilles (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1998), pp. 15-28. The Divine Comedy, especially the Purgatorio, is the only medieval ac- count of travel that fully understands its genre and fully exploits the corre- spondences between travel, love, and narrative itself. Campbell reads the poem as responding to our need for and identification with medias res, the material and open-ended space and time of "life as we know it" and as generically presented in journey literature. She compares the Commedia to the Other World narratives, Holy Land itineraria, and secular travel narratives. Dante is distinctive in his continual emphasis on the body and landscape. Sleep is the ultimately distinctive feature of a material being in this realm, confirming the continuity of Purgatory with our diurnal world. When climbing to the middle cornice of the mountain, Dante falls asleep and dreams of the Siren, a dream that is both nel mezzo of the journey of the poem and about the medium of that middle. The Siren functions as the threat of narrative entropy: she is a phantom of erotic, geographical, and narrative satisfactions - precisely what Dante is desper- ately fleeing. But it was only a dream - death cannot happen nel mezzo del cammin di nostra vita.

In Dante Studies, 116 (1998), 189-208. Investigates the reasons for the reluctance of many scholars to accept Dante's authorship of the plurilingual poem At faux ris. Although the manuscript tradition and the early printed editions speak largely (if not exclusively) in favor of Dante's authorship, some nineteenth-century edi- tors began to express doubts about it, hiding their cultural xenophobia behind pseudo-philological arguments, which were not based on facts. As a consequence, the "canzone trilingue" was marginalized in and often removed from modern editions of Dante's Rime. A close analysis of the poem discloses significant Dantean characteristics that have not yet been sufficiently evaluated (with the exception of studies by Furio Brugnolo and Domenico De Robertis). In addition, Chiamenti focuses on Dante's sojourn with the Malaspina family in Lunigiana, where he would have had occasion to come into contact with transalpine lyrical production, and thus proposes a date of 1306-1308 for the composition of this mas- terly canzone.

The exploration of Dante's concept of ingegno includes an analy- sis of all the occurrences of this word and its correlative verbal form inge- gnare in the poem. Ingegno is held to be a mental faculty, and this concept is examined in relation to the imagination, memory, and intellect.

Doctoral dissertation, University of To- ronto, 1997, 219 p. 11 Purgatory XXV is the pivot around which this comparative study of Dante and Joyce revolves. With the exception of doctrinal studies, this canto has mostly been ignored; yet, it is central to the Divine Comedy. Statius tells Virgil and the pilgrim about the development of the embryo up until the moment when a joyful Creator breathes in a self-reflecting soul and, in that moment, the embryo transforms into a j ante, a speaker. In the preceding canto, the Dantean pilgrim recounts that when he senses the spira of Amor, he takes note and records it as poetry. Juxtaposed in the narrative, the divine spira of the embryo canto, and the divine spira inspir- ing poetics, together establish the essential contribution Purgatorio XXV makes to the poetics of the Commedia. Through close textual analysis, the . . . study demonstrates that Dante's definition of his poetic practice fo- cuses attention on the embryo canto. Dante has constructed his poem so that the final canto - when he encounters God - is superimposed upon the embryo canto where he first encountered God. Thus, the Divine Com- edy is a write of passage: the symbolic death at the poem's conclusion corresponds with the return to the womb of Purgatorio XXV." Gaston, Robert W.

Treats the relationship of artists to Dante to probe the competitive interaction between art and text in the Cinquecento. Argues that literary 253</page><page sequence="10">Dante Studies, CXVII, 1999 scholars made disingenuous use of the "sister arts" trope to assert hegem- ony over visual production, although the writings of artists themselves occasionally challenge this hierarchy. Michelangelo, however, is uniquely permitted to transcend the customary boundaries of scholarly disciplines and, as an acknowledged polymath, is celebrated in Dantean terms. The decorations at his funeral, for example, recall Dante's Commedia; in one picture, Michelangelo stands in the Elysian Fields surrounded by the bella scola of great classical and Italian artists. A Florentine, a groundbreaking artist, and an admirer of Dante's poetry, Michelangelo is seen as the culmi- nation of the Florentine renaissance-of-the-arts story begun by Dante. Gaston suggests that "in perfecting this Trecento teleology, however, the Cinquecento scholars clearly extended the sister arts trope beyond its tra- ditional, and perhaps reasonable, limits, through their appropriation and adulation of Michelangelo's poetry."

Viewing the Commedia as a "producerly text" because of its concomi- tant broad accessibility and challenging generation of meaning, Iannucci charts the influence of the poem on films from the silent era to the pres- ent. In the silent period, filmmakers used Dante's reputation - famous episodes (e.g., Francesca and Paolo, Ugolino), an entire canticle, or the poet's own life - to legitimize the new medium. In the second cinematic period, from the mid-1920s to World War II and its aftermath, Dante's poem was more often used in sound movies as a frame for scripts set in 254</page><page sequence="11">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz the modern era with an overt moral message (e.g., the evils of unbridled capitalism in Harry Lachman's Dante's Inferno of 1935).

Doctoral dissertation, University of Arkansas, 1998, 207 P- "The invocation to the Muse was a standard feature of many epic poems of the ancient world, and it was used both by Homer in the Iliad and the Odyssey and by Virgil in the Aeneid. Because of the powerful authority of these two poets in later ages, the invocation to the Muse was carried over into the Christian Age by many poets who wanted to share in the classical epic tradition. The controversy raised by this practice raged throughout the Middle Ages and Renaissance among the poets and critics. In the Middle Ages, the poet of The Song of Roland chose not to use the invocation at all and castigates Apollo throughout his poem. But Dante, who uses more invocations than any other poet in this study, chooses the pagan Virgil as the guide for his pilgrim in The Divine Comedy and proudly invokes the Muses and Apollo as well as numerous Christian figures." Jewiss, Virginia. "Monstrous Movements and Metaphors in Dante's Di- vine Comedy." In Forum Italicum, 32, No. 2 (Fall, 1998), 332-346. This study raises the question of the existence and nature of monsters in medieval literature. Jewiss determines that Hell represents the locus par excellence in which to find monsters. Indeed, she argues, Hell is frequently anthropomorphized into a type of monster which devours the sinners consigned there. However, the author focuses on four particular beings within the Inferno in order to examine the various ways in which Dante describes the monstrous. Each of these, she notes, is described as if in motion, as if the viewer observes the process of change, thereby denying a stable, fixed existence to any of them. The first of these is the centaur, Nessus, whom Dante portrays by stressing his dual nature, half horse and half man. The second is the symbol of fraud, Geryon, who is composed 255</page><page sequence="12">Dante Studies, CXVII, 1999 of three different beings. Dante describes this creature through several different metaphors which compare him to a swimmer, a boat, an eel, a falcon, an arrow and a beaver. The cumulative effect of these comparisons negate Geryon's fixed identity, as if he were in a constant state of meta- morphosis. The third monster is the giant Antaeus, the product of angels copulating with human beings. The last is Lucifer himself whom, like the other giants, Dante seemingly confuses with architectural structures. In conclusion, the author notes that all the monsters in hell are useful to the Pilgrim, and stresses that while humans might find them frightful, they all serve a purpose in God's order.

In 1560 the poet Laura Battiferra, the wife of the sculptor Bartolomeo Ammannati, published her first book of poetry, a collection that included her poetic correspondence with Italian luminaries such as Bronzino. Around the same time, according to Kirkham's dating, Bronzino exe- cuted a portrait of his friend Battiferra, in striking profile, holding a manu- 256</page><page sequence="13">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz script copy of a book opened to two of Petrarch's sonnets. Kirkham decodes the key elements of the portrait with the help of extensive liter- ary, visual, and archival evidence. According to Kirkham, Petrarch's poems speak to Battiferra's personal similarities to Petrarch's own ideal- ized Laura, proclaim her poetic petrarchismo, and contribute to the ongoing debates over ideal literary models by asserting Petrarch's primacy. Bron- zino's choice to paint Battiferra in profile, a pose reserved for royalty and the dead in the mid-Cinquecento, and the sitter's conspicuous aquiline nose, allow the painter to identify Battiferra with Dante as well, as his notable profile was already iconic in the visual arts. Bronzino thus situates Battiferra in the most illustrious tradition of Italian literature, among Pe- trarch and Dante. Finally, the anachronistic manuscript copy of Petrarch's poem was likely Battiferra's own commonplace book - Kirkham demon- strates the similarity between the handwriting in the portrait and Battifer- ra's own handwriting as preserved in autograph letters.

Suggests thematic and iconographic links among the presentations of Plutus and Fortune in this canto, which are detailed in the late-sixteenth-century series of drawings by Jean Cousin lejeune, he Livre de Fortune. Land, Norman E. "Dante, Vasari and Michelangelo's Pieta in Rome." In Lectura Dantis, 22-23 (Spring-Fall, 1998), 181-198. Land draws attention to the sophistication and subtlety of Vasari's criti- 257</page><page sequence="14">Dante Studies, CXVII, 1999 cism, focusing particularly on Vasari's masterful account of the complex qualities of Michelangelo's early Pieta in St. Peter's. For example, by relat- ing anecdotes that link Michelangelo to Apelles as he appears in Pliny, Vasari suggests that Michelangelo's talent rivals that of the ancients. By pointing to the difference between Mary's youthful appearance and her son's limp lifeless body, Vasari demonstrates an acute awareness of the spiritual significance of the physical forms. And by evoking Dante's assess- ment of the sculptures on the terrace of pride - "morti li morti e i vivi parean vivi" - , Vasari reveals his understanding that "naturalism" serves as a means to a spiritual end. Land concludes that Vasari's criticism repre- sents, in fact, spiritual writing, in much the same way that Dante's poetry represents poetic theology. [JL] La Porta, Cristina. "History and the Poetic Vocation in Sopra un tnonu- mento di Dante." In Rivista di studi italiani, 16, No. 2 (dicembre, 1998), 359-375. A textual and literary-historical interpretation of Leopardi's poem writ- ten in response to the 1818 proposal to erect a monument to Dante in Florence. The author discusses "Sopra un monumento di Dante" in rela- tion to a tradition of patriotic Italian writing extending from Dante and Petrarch to Alfieri and Foscolo. Viewing Leopardi's patriotic spirit as "more literary than political" (361), La Porta identifies "cultural mem- ory" as Leopardi's way of exhorting Italy to a better future based on an illustrious past embodied by the Dantean virtues of "literary excellence, political courage, and the championship of the Italian language" (360). In "Sopra un monumento" Leopardi adopts the Petrarchan family metaphor of Italy as mother (widow), fellow Italians as sons, and Dante as "the poet's literary father, the creator of the national language" (366). The poem fulfills its epitaphic function by memorializing the Italian soldiers sacrificed by Napoleon in his Russian military campaign. [GPR] Lectura Dantis: Inferno. A Canto-by -Canto Commentary.

In Dissertation 259</page><page sequence="16">Dante Studies, CXVII, 1999 Abstracts International 59, No. 1 (July, 1998), 162. Doctoral Dissertation, Princeton University, 1998, 235 p. "Throughout his manifestly Christian poem, the Commedia, Dante ne- gotiates the influence of his pagan predecessor, Ovid. The focus of the dissertation is Dante's allusions to mythological material drawn from Ovid's Metamorphoses. The thesis attempts to reorient critical discussion by pointing toward moments in which Ovid, functioning as more than a mere foil for the Christian truth of Dante's poem, offers Dante a compel- ling model that informs much of the artistic self-consciousness of the Commedia. [The author] contend[s] that references to Ovid's poem pro- vide Dante with an arena for grappling with the role of the artist and investigating both the damning and redemptive possibilities of art. The presence of Ovidian figures in Dante's Commedia allows the poet to con- sider issues of identity and personal and artistic transformation." Individ- ual figures considered include Daedalus and Icarus, Procne and Philomela, Io, and the Pierides and Marsyas. Lieberman, Hilary.

Tommaso Campanella's The City of the Sun ostensibly describes a Uto- pian society; a close examination, however, of its use of ekphrasis - in comparison with ekphrastic texts of Virgil and Dante - reveal that the work "is perhaps instead an authoritarian and oppressive dystopia" (224). In The Aeneid, the descriptions of visual art contained in books one and eight are described through the eyes of Aeneas, as reporting his individual perceptions. Aeneas' reactions to the works on Dido's temple in book one and on his shield in book eight are progressive, charting the changes he undergoes in the course of becoming a hero worthy of Rome. Like- wise, in Purgatorio 10, the sculptures Dante describes are seen through the eyes of the protagonist, and at a key moment Dante breaks away from Virgil to approach one of the sculptures, thus showing how, as he prog- resses up the mountain, he moves beyond Virgil's guidance. In the City of the Sun, however, the ekphrasis is presented in the passive voice, not allowing the artwork to be perceived by any individual within the city, creating the image of a city where individual interpretation and freedom is forbidden.

"Literary History and Individuality in the De vulgari elo- quential In Dante Studies, 116 (1998), 161-188. 260</page><page sequence="17">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz This essay considers the relationship between literary-historical reflec- tion and autobiographical representation in Dante's work, particularly the De vulgari eloquentia. The argument first contends that Dante uses literary history in De vulgari eloquentia as a means for understanding his own indi- viduality and the historical and cultural dimensions of his vocation as poet. The author then explores how this abiding tension between literary his- tory and autobiography in De vulgari eloquentia - and to a lesser extent the Vita Nuova - informs Dante's discussions of his own early poetry in Purgatorio 24 and the encounter between the Pilgrim and Beatrice in Pur- gatorio 30-31. In highlighting the great extent to which Dante's interpre- tation of the history of vernacular literary culture influences his spiritual ascent and self-representation in the Commedia, this study emphasizes the De vulgari eloquentia 's contribution to our understanding of how awareness of the literary past can condition knowledge of the self.

Marchesi, Simone. "The 'Knot of Language': Sermocinatio and Contra- passo for the Rhetoricians in Dante's Inferno." In RLA: Romance Languages Annual 1997, 9 (1998), 254-259. Studies the episode of Pier de la Vigna (Inferno 13) to explore Dante's complex attitude towards rhetoric. Saint Augustine notes that there are two goals to rhetoric: perfection in eloquence and persuasion toward vir- tue. In Canto 13, the author uses highly ornate language which not only mimics Pier de la Vigna's poetic style; it also conveys a moral judgment of rhetoric which is devoid of Augustine's second attribute. Marchesi also examines several passages in this episode to illustrate that the condemned poet, the rhetorician who deceived himself with tortuous reasoning, con- stitutes both the source of the knotty imagery of the wood of the suicides and the convoluted syntax of the poetry of the Divine Comedy.

In Modern Language Notes, 113, No. 1 (January, 1998), 1-29. 261</page><page sequence="18">Dante Studies, CXVII, 1999 Studies the intertextualities between the Vita Nuova and the book of Lamentations. The book of Lamentations was written by the prophet Jeremiah after the destruction of Jerusalem by Nebuchednezzar in 586 B.C.E. While the laments are primarily public, grieving the loss of the Holy City, they also express the private mourning for King Josiah, killed several years earlier in a war against the Egyptians. Medieval commenta- tors related the book of Lamentations to the Song of Solomon. The for- mer details the weeping that occurs in this life, while the latter expresses the rejoicing which will take place in the next. The relationship of the sacred text to the Vita Nuova is complex. There are numerous references to that work in the Vita Nuova as well as, of course, a direct citation to mark Beatrice's death. Like Jerusalem, Florence is "widowed" by the death of Beatrice, and in this way, Dante emulates the prophet by linking his private sorrow with a public lamentation. Furthermore, like Jeremiah, Dante positions his text in relationship to the Song of Solomon; he de- scribes writing a sirventese of the sixty most beautiful women of Florence, which recalls the Hebrew king's assertion that one woman represents the favorite of his sixty wives. Most importantly, Dante positions Beatrice as the sponsa whose death leaves Florence as a vidua; she will reappear in Purgatorio 30:11, as a sponsa, in line with the medieval interpretation of the Song of Songs as portraying the rejoicing in the next world.

"Cyclopean Latin: Intertextual Read- ings in Dante's Eclogues and Gongora's Polifemo y Galatea." In Classical and Modern Literature, 18, No. 2 (Winter, 1998), 125-136. Places Dante's and Gongora's use of classical Latin versions of the Pol- yphemus story in the tradition of debates over genre, levels of poetic diction, and language. Musgrove proposes that the Cyclops of Dante's second Eclogue - based primarily on the Achaemenides episode recounted in Aeneid 3 and Metamorphoses 14 - "stands for traditionally violent heroic epic" (131), the epic of war and kingly deeds that the Italian poet eschews for his vernacular epic. Conversely, the Polyphemus of the baroque Span- ish poem "carries the ambiguous Ovidian baggage" of Metamorphoses 13 (136), thus combining the Homeric (epic) and Theocritean (pastoral) ver- sions of the Cyclops. Both poets "find ways to continue the classical dia- logue over the value of various genres, while making a modern statement about their own languages" (136). [GPR] Nohrnberg, James. "Allegory Deveiled: A New Theory for Construing Allegory's Two Bodies." In Modern Philology, 96, No. 2 (November, 1998), 188-207. This study is a "review article" of Gordon Teskey's book, Allegory and Violence (Ithaca, New York: Cornell University Press, 1996; see below under ADDENDA). The book argues that allegory constitutes a violent imposition of orderly meaning on a fundamentally chaotic reality, and Nohrnberg charts the varied details, some of which come from Dante, that Teskey employs in order to make his case. Teskey's treatment of Dante concentrates on Inferno 5, where he objects to Dante's turning of Francesca da Rimini into an allegorical emblem of vice rather than treat- ing her as a living, individual woman, resistant to totalizing interpretations of her life. "In the Inferno," however, "the characters are not so much 263</page><page sequence="20">Dante Studies, CXVII, 1999 punished for their sins as by them. Francesca lived a life of allegory as much by choice as by chance" (192). [VSB] Parker, Deborah. "Vasari's Portrait of Six Tuscan Poets: A Visible Liter- ary History." In Lectura Dantis, 22-23 (Spring-Fall, 1998), 45-62. Interprets the visual clues in Vasari's Portrait of Six Tuscan Poets, com- missioned by Luca Martini in 1543, to uncover the literary and cultural issues at play in the painting. "In the choice of sitters and their arrange- ment, Vasari and his patron collaborated upon an invenzione which offers a remarkably sophisticated and self-conscious account of literary preemi- nence and genealogy." Dante is notably placed in the foreground of the painting and is the only seated figure. His placement, his gestures, the objects before him, and his physical relationship to the other figures in the painting - Petrarch, Boccaccio, Guido Cavalcanti, Cino da Pistoia and Guittone d'Arezzo - all testify to Dante's importance to Martini and his circle. Moreover, his evident preeminence over Petrarch refutes Bem- bo's contemporary assessment of Dante's inferiority to the later poet and thus constitutes an intervention in the Cinquecento debate over literary standing. Finally, the inclusion of Cino da Pistoia and Guittone d'Arezzo, and the prominent laurel wreath worn by Guido Cavalcanti, emphasize the contributions of these earlier poets to the Tuscan literary patrimony. Vasari and Martini demonstrate an understanding of the ways that literary reputations are constructed. QL] Passaro, Maria Pastore.

Provides a succinct overview of Dante's linguistic theories as ex- pounded in his minor works, beginning with the Vita Nuova and Convivio, but focusing on De vulgari eloquentia. The author notes that Dante pro- poses a new project at the end of the Vita Nuova, one in which he will write about Beatrice in a manner which has never been done for any other woman. But, Passaro asks rhetorically, what would the language of this work be like? In the Convivio, Dante provides a rudimentary defini- tion of the "volgare illustre," a language which would not evolve like the vernacular, but instead would remain fixed and permanent. However, Dante explains this "volgare illustre" more fully in De vulgari eloquentia, wherein he sets out first to demonstrate that it resides not in any one 264</page><page sequence="21">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz dialect, but in the best of all of them; then he demonstrates how it might be used by various poets once developed.

Picone, Michelangelo. "Theories of Love and the Lyric Tradition from Dante's Vita Nuova to Petrarch's Canzoniere." In Romance Notes, 39, No. 1 (Fall, 1998), 83-93. Argues that the Vita Nuova is, among other things, a complete discus- sion on the culturally dominant modes of discourse about love. Indeed, 265</page><page sequence="22">Dante Studies, CXVII, 1999 according to the author, the fundamental question of the work is how to resolve the problematic nature of love? The article analyzes two episodes from the libello to demonstrate that this question underlies the work. It begins by discussing the first vision, related in the sonnet, "A ciascun'alma presa." In this passage, Picone notes that Beatrice's action of eating Dante's heart symbolizes fol' amor, thereby illustrating the destructive pow- ers of passion. However, in contrast to that, the last sonnet, "Oltre la spera," represents fin' amor which sublimates the senses in a spiritual pas- sion. Thus, the protagonist of the Vita Nuova moves from eros to caritas throughout the narrative therein. Picone closes the article by contrasting the opera giovanile to Petrarch's Canzoniere. Like Dante's work, Petrarch's collection represents a culmination of the Romance tradition. However, Petrarch does not allow for the sublimation of passion to ultimately com- municate a spiritual truth. For Petrarch, there is no moral or religious significance to love. [FA] Podgurski, Robert. "Where Optics and Visionary Metaphysics Con- verge in Dante's 'Novella Vista'." In Italian Quarterly, 35, Nos. 135-136 (Winter-Spring, 1998), 29-38. Examines Dante's understanding and synthesis of the different medieval schools of thought regarding vision. The first of these, that of extromis- sion, posited that the eye sends out rays which return with an image. The second, that of intromission, proposed that objects emit rays which the eyes perceive. The third, proposed by Aristotle, blends the previous two theories, stating that colored objects can be seen when illuminated. Dante seemingly adheres to the different optical ideas, depending on which of the writings one examines. However, in the Commedia, he appears to synthesize intromission and extromission, allowing for intromission - a more passive model - when distant from God, while engaging in ex- tromission, where the eye is more active, in proximity to the divine.

Dante's use of the Apocalypse in the Paradiso, particularly in the heaven of the sun, reveals his interest in the last book of the Bible as an interpre- tive key to the rest of the Scriptures. The imagery that he employs in the heaven of the sun derives from both the Apocalypse and from the mosaics in the Florence baptistry that portray the Last Judgment.

(American University Studies, Series II: Romance Languages and Literature, 226) "This collection of previously published essays assembles the most rele- vant studies on theory of language development and theory of style in specific geographic areas and in general terms. The essays find a common thread and matrix in their reference to the traditional theory of the Arts of Discourse, or Trivium Arts, the core of the Liberal Arts system. The languages most directly involved range from Latin and Greek to Italian, French, and German. The connecting link is the perception that literature grows in a symbiosis of convergent disciplines that affects authors and readers alike."

Schildgen, Brenda Deen. "Dante and the Crusades." In Dante Studies, 116(1998), 95-125. Arguing against the idea that Dante supported Holy Land crusades, this essay proposes that the Comedy takes Europe as the focus of its crusade polemic. Much of the crusade and pilgrimage literature, informed by a literal exegesis of the Bible, undertook a religious-political mission that sought to pacify the biblical lands and fostered hatred of the people who 268</page><page sequence="25">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz lived there. Dante has assumed the language of the crusades, but taking on the role of prophet, he transforms their goals into a poetic ethical- political mission aimed against Latin structural and individual corruption. As in Roland and Aliscans, he points to the law as the solution to the crisis created by Latin squabbling and treachery and to the West as the site for future conversion. As in Bonaventure's Itinerarium Mentis in Deum, his iter, that is, pilgrimage and crusade, has given him the chance to see the things of the world for which he takes responsibility as visionary prophet and reformer. Dante registers little interest in Holy Land crusades, but rather focuses on the corruptions rife in his own Latin lands. [BDS] Scoggins, Dene Dee.

Examines "the importance of astrology to medieval and early modern culture" and attempts to "show that these authors contributed to the debate surrounding astrology, accommodating some aspects of astral in- fluence, rejecting others. Dante, for example, establishes astrology as a divine semiotics that opens up the secrets of God; however, he also warns his readers about the dangers of looking too far into the future." Senior, Diane. "The Authority and Autonomy of the Fiore." In Forum Italicum, 32, No. 2 (Fall, 1998), 305-331. Argues that the author of the Fiore establishes a subjective self in history as the arbiter of transcendent truth, against the abstract intellectualizations the Roman de la Rose hands down from external authority and tradition. "Tradigione" in the Fiore signifies both tradition and treachery, a betrayal of truth through fixity in the past, through failing to be open to hope and the future. The Italian Poet-Lover's fidelity to the Dio d'Amore repre- sents a faith in the ineffable beyond word and abstraction, reached through entering oneself and through trust in one's own reason; it is a rejection of the "passive receptivity and deceptive manipulation of knowledge at the heart of the Rose," a rejection of abstract or universal Reason as ultimately irrational.

Bodies, be they ghostly, demonic, fleshly, or angelic, are tied up in both literal and figurative knots because of their unstable ontol- ogy, an ontology that they share with human language. In each chapter, Shapiro addresses the interconnections between poetic speech and em- bodied spirit as they develop over the course of the Commedia 's three canticles. Instead of regarding Dante as an Olympian poet, her approach emphasizes process, for even a masterpiece may conceal adjustments and shifts in strategy as part of its structure. While much current scholarship has set out to recover the specifically literary dimensions of Dante's enter- prise by prising them away from the overriding theological concerns, this work is intended to bring the two together in an integrated vision."

"The Parlement ofFoules and Inferno 5." In Chaucer Review, 33, No. 2 (1998), 113-122. Chaucer's Parlement of Foules is an intertextual work that draws on a number of different texts, including Dante's Commedia; the relevance, however, of Dante's poem for Chaucer's - which is also a dream vision - has not been sufficiently appreciated. In particular, the fifth canto of the Inferno seems relevant for a reading of Chaucer's poem. Dante's canto of condemned lovers serves both as a source for Chaucer and as a guide to interpreting the later poem. Chaucer does not condemn all forms of love, but distinguishes between the carnal passion symbolized by Paolo and Francesca that is inspired by the reading of romances, and a natural love that leads to marriage and offspring. Even the end of the Parlement of Foules, where the narrator awakens from his dream vision and returns to his books, recalls Inferno 5; in Dante's poem, Paolo and Francesca are led into adultery by reading the romance of Lancelot together, but they break off their reading too soon. "Where Francesca 'read no farther,' [Chaucer's narrator] reads on, seeking a better wisdom" (119). [VSB] Tambling, Jeremy. "Illustrating Accusation: Blake on Dante's Comme- diar In Studies in Romanticism, 37, No. 3 (Fall, 1998), 395-420. 270</page><page sequence="27">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz An attempt to read Blake's Dante illustrations as cultural productions of the 1820s. The author first considers them in relation to changes of approach to state-control and punishment that were then taking place. The engraved version of number 58, "The Pit of Disease: The Falsifiers," illustrating Inf. 29:50-51, depicts Virgil and Dante as petit-bourgeois property-owners, a background that encourages us to look at the punish- ments and the crimes in a non-eschatological way, by reflecting that forg- ery, which is paid for here, was, in the 1820s, a capital offense. Next, Tambling draws attention to the coincidence that Byron died in 1824, the same year Blake began the illustrations; this finds a response in shifts be- tween aristocratic and middle-class sentiment and approaches to punish- ment. Byron's death acts as a metaphor for the ascendancy of middle-class approaches to morality and for the rule of the bourgeois conscience. The third part of the essay suggests that the illustrations may be seen as strung between the differences evoked by what Byron represents and what Dick- ens represents. Blake's Dante illustrations, especially that of Paolo and Francesca, are like Dickens's David Copperfield in being aware of the un- ease the bourgeois has with the sexual. Tambling closes by considering what is modern about these works, what in them implies new awarenesses of subjectivity that were also current in the 1820s, for instance. [LW] Thompson, Andrew.

Tomasch, Sylvia. "Judecca, Dante's Satan, and the D/s-placed Jew." In Text and Territory: Geographical Imagination in the European Middle Ages, edited by Sylvia Tomasch and Sealy Gilles (Philadelphia: University of Pennsylvania Press, 1998), pp. 247-267. Explores the "absence" located in the name of the geographical site, the "Judecca" (giudecca, Inf. 34:117), the medieval Italian name for the Jewish ghetto. This re-etymologization entails a relentless repression of Jewish referentiality that nonetheless returns in distorted form. Through- out the Inferno, by means of strategies of metonymy, Jews are variously represented: in the Judecca, in the mosques (Canto 8), and in the figure of Satan himself, whose "dephallicized body evokes the circumcised penis, a synechdochal symbol of the Jews." Yet, "in trying to recapitulate only Christian wholeness, it [the Commedia] repeatedly manifests what it seeks to avoid." For Jewish presence shows forth at the central location of the cosmos, and Jewish narrative provides the allegorical foundations of the text itself. Lucifer's cannibalism not only inverts the Eucharist, but also evokes the Passover. Dante scholars have ignored this point, and are guilty of a "christianist blindness." Tomasch ends by invoking Barolini's call for a "new formalism" in medieval studies, urging the development of "a stance that will allow us to attend to Dante's narrative strategies as well as to ponder the repercussions of our blinkered praise."

Doctoral dissertation, Yale University, 1998, 213 p. "[PJrobes Dante's understanding of the potentially explosive clash be- tween theology and history by focusing on the violent act of sacrifice. The introduction surveys the appearance of the word 'sacrifice' in all of Dante's works. The rare term is found to refer most frequently to the physical act of pagan worship, although in the Divine Comedy it also desig- nates the spiritual act of Christian sacrifice. The first chapter of the disser- tation, 'Sacrifice and Theology,' provides the medieval theological 272</page><page sequence="29">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz context for Dante's understanding of sacrifice. The sacrificial theories of Augustine and Thomas Aquinas reveal both the historic and symbolic nature of Christian sacrifice, an ambiguous duality which Dante exploits in his poetry." Other chapters are concerned with Inferno 20 and 32-33, Purgatorio 23, and Paradiso 7. Warner, Lawrence. "Dante's Ulysses and the Erotics of Crusading." Dante Studies, 116 (1998), 65-93. Dante figures Ulysses as anti-crusader and sodomitical penetrator. Ulysses's rejection of familial bonds for the sake of a journey away from Jerusalem perverts preachers' exhortations that crusaders toward the "fa- therland" should not be hindered by love of children, parents and wives. His "trapasso del segno" is akin to what Christians saw as the "sodomiti- cal" Muslim penetration of Jerusalem. Inferno 26 's focus upon the motifs of seed, shipwreck, illicit transgression, and living like brutes further sug- gests an affinity with anti-sodomitical treatises. Dante strengthens these resonances by aligning Inferno 26 with both Inferno 15's portrayal of Bru- netto Latini and Purgatorio 26's of the sodomites and "hermaphrodites." Cacciaguida's status as crusader (Paradiso 15-18) is crucial to his widely- acknowledged palinodic relationship with Brunetto, Guinizzelli, and es- pecially Ulysses; the teleological rectitude of his attempt to liberate Jerusa- lem puts into sharp relief these sinners' errancy. Dante, by modeling his own journey after the Exodus in conjunction with Ulysses (Purgatorio 1:130-133), confirms the centrality of crusading ideology to the structure of the Commedia: crusading leaders believed that Moses and Joshua's mili- tary mission prefigured contemporary campaigns to re-claim Jerusalem. For Dante, the acts of journeying and recording the word of God are inherently violent, calling upon obliteration of the errant. [LW] Watts, Barbara J. "The Word Imaged: Dante's Commedia and Sandro Botticelli's San Barnaba Altarpiece." In Lectura Dantis, 22-23 (Spring- Fall, 1998), 203-245. Focusing on two notable elements of Botticelli's San Barnaba altar- piece - the inscription on the steps to Mary's throne and the fictive gilded reliefs in the roundels above Mary's head - Watts asserts that Botticelli accomplishes two goals: he uses Dante's Paradiso to recast a conventional religious subject and he participates in the ongoing debate on the relative values of painting and poetry. The inscription on Mary's throne cites Dante directly; it reads "VERGINE MADRE, FIGLIA DEL TUO FIG- 273</page><page sequence="30">Dante Studies, CXVII, 1999 LIO," the first verse of St. Bernard's prayer to the Virgin in Paradiso 33. The reliefs above the Virgin's throne refer to Dante obliquely; they depict the Annunciation in much the same way that the sculpted terrace was said to in Purgatorio 10, and they thus resemble the Annunciation relief in Botticelli's illustration of the canto. Botticelli's representation of Mary in the altarpiece is then elucidated by Dante's own representation of her on the terrace of pride and in the Empyrean. As a result, her humility is underscored and the causal relationship between her humble stance at the Annunciation and her exalted position as the Queen of Heaven is made manifest. Dante's text finally stands as an exegesis of Botticelli's altarpiece, revealing the allegorical significance of Mary in her various aspects. Watts concludes by asserting that Botticelli's use of Dante allows him to present word and image as "analogous modes of figural allusion"; the image can be as polysemous as the text. Botticelli thus challenges Dante's subordina- tion of image to word in the Commedia through Dante's words them- selves. [}L] Weinfield, Henry. "The Noble Epicureans: Variations on a Buried Theme (Dante and Wordsworth)." In Religion &amp; Literature, 30, No. 1 (Spring, 1998), 13-34. The first part of this essay offers the standard "romantic" reading of the episodes of Farinata and Cavalcante, Brunetto Latini, and Ulysses: in all these cases what resonates is an incipient humanism that cuts against the theological grain and, in Auerbach's term, detaches the figure from its ground. Weinfield finds parallels between Dante's portrayal of these fig- ures and those of Achilles and Odysseus in Homer's Odyssey; the Italian poet's attempt to repress Epicureanism on the ideological level merely intensifies on the poetic or affective level the power of the claim it would seem to have on us. The essay then turns to Wordsworth's "Tintern Abbey," arguing that the Epicurean dimension latent in that poem - as manifested, for instance, in the poet's association of pleasure and good- ness - is one aspect of a complex response to a religious crisis that assails Wordsworth both in general intellectual terms and, more specifically, through the mediation of poetic tradition.

'The Ethics of Literature: The Fiore and Medie- val Traditions of Rewriting." In The Fiore in Context . . . (q.v.), pp. 207- 231. Examines the Fiore % literary, cultural, and ethical purposes in the con- text of the medieval theory of translatio. In contrast to the passive volgariz- zamenti of French and Latin texts of the time, which only served to preserve the subordination of the translation, and its linguistic and cultural context, to the authority of the original text and its language and culture, the author of the Fiore aggressively appropriates and reworks the structures and ideologies of French and Provencal literature in order to establish his own authority, and the identity and autonomy of Italian literature, in a polemic against French cultural hegemony in Tuscany. Thus the Fiore establishes its own auctoritas by stressing its genre as translation, while con- cealing its source; its controlled and parodic gallicisms aim to reverse the established cultural and linguistic hierarchy; it presents itself as a new Ovidian ars amandi, suppressing all reference to Ovid. Like its Ovidian model, as understood in a medieval context, the Fiore has an ethical aim, demanding a moral interpretation beyond the literal sense, a morality "at odds with the behavior of its protagonist."

The essay considers first the poem's date and geographical source, its genre and purposes, and accepts the conclusion that its author possessed high literary and intellectual abilities. The "pre- Continian" arguments for Dante's authorship are judged ultimately in- conclusive, given the objections raised against them; Contini's own "in- ternal arguments" cannot distinguish the poet's memory from a "collective memory," and are perhaps insufficient in number and quality. Efforts to detect parallels in "deep structure" are too abstract; the most promising direction seems to be careful statistical analysis of "uncon- scious" linguistic and metrical patterns. The author would ultimately at- tribute the Fiore not to Dante, but to a writer who has left no other trace. [CM] Boyde, Patrick. "The Results of the Poll: Presentation and Analysis."

Seventeen of the arguments evoked a consen- sus of opinion; all the responses are analyzed by various criteria and set out in five tables. In general, the participants were skeptical about the attribution to Dante, leading the author to conclude that the burden of proof still lies with those who are not, and to offer a list of guidelines for those who wish to engage the question in the future.

"Jason's Voyage and the Poetics of Rewriting: The Fiore and the Roman de la Rose." In The Fiore in Context . . . (q.v.)&gt; pp. 167-182. Focuses on the Fiore 's treatment of Jason, the most insistent classical allusion in the work, as emblematic of the Fiore's own relation to the Roman de la Rose. The Fiore sets up Jason's quest for the Golden Fleece as a figure for Amante's erotic exploit; by manipulating the references to Jason in the Rose, the Fiore casts this exploit, and the figure of Amante himself, in an ironic and negative light. The Fiore thus replaces the Rose's double-author with a single author-protagonist, effectively suppressing the French text's "self-conscious author figure." The Fiore both 'evokes and denies' the authority of the Rose, assimilating and rewriting "the dominant canonical poetic text of the French vernacular in newly Italian literary terms"; indeed the authorial self-naming in sonnet 82 excludes any mention of the Fiore 's predecessors, while the corresponding passage in the Rose presents its authors as "effecting a translatio in a literary geneal- ogy.

Traces in detail the process whereby the series of Blake's Dante water colors was divided and dispersed among seven institutions in 1918, and the responses such division occasioned. Both accident and design have contributed to the state of affairs in which works now in institutional collections are located in different places and are likely to stay there. The dispersal of the Dante illustrations can be adduced as an example of the principle of entropy applying to art collections and to compound works susceptible to subdivision. It would be anachronistic to criticize the proc- ess, and in any case the presence of the Blake drawings in America and Australia has had a substantial influence on the growth of Blake's reputa- tion outside Britain.

Seeks to restore the principal phonic and semantic parallels between the Fiore and the Inferno, especially in Cantos 5, 18, and 23, to their partic- ular context. In general terms, both the Fiore and the Inferno depict a world of "deceit, venality, and exploitation"; in both the corruption of language reflects moral corruption. Dante's emphasis on the purity of his "parlare onesto," in contrast to the sinners, may serve to stress that he has gone beyond the Fiore. The "deliberate negation or correction" that accompanies so many of the Inferno's echoes of the Fiore suggest "that when Dante cites the Fiore, he is citing himself." [CM] De Robertis, Domenico. "La traccia del Fiore." In The Fiore in Context . . . (q.v.), pp. 187-204. An essay Patrick Boyde, elsewhere in the volume (204), terms "the single most important contribution to the subject of Dante and the Fiore since Contini first pronounced in 1965." The essay traces new and strik- ing patterns of thought and expression shared by the Fiore and Dante's canonical works (including the Purgatorio and Paradiso), to support at the least Dante's complete identification with the author of the Fiore. Arguing that no comparable parallels can be established between the Fiore and any other author (though he traces echoes also in Cavalcanti, Cino da Pistoia, Rustico di Filippo, and others), De Robertis argues both that the Fiore was the "formal element" of Dante's collaboration with Cavalcanti, and that the only possible explanation for Dante's silence on the Fiore is that he is himself its author Durante, and is performing his own damnatio mem- oriae on the work. [CM] De Robertis Boniforti, Teresa. "Nota sul codice e la sua scrittura." In The Fiore in Context . . . (q.v.), pp. 49-81. Examines the singular features of the only manuscript of the Fiore and the Detto d'Amore, including the history of its dismembering, its pagina- tion in two "snaking" columns per page, with two sonnets per column, its small format (almost too small for the Fiore), a page layout that seems to be dictated more by the Detto than the Fiore, and its script. The pagina- tion, which is usually reserved for prose, is indebted to the model of the Roman de la Rose, and is used for poetry most frequently in fourteenth- century manuscripts of the Comedy; the script, a "lettera bastarda" that stylizes the cursive used for practical affairs with features of the littera textu- 282</page><page sequence="39">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz alis used for books, is also characteristic of early manuscripts of the Com- edy. The author concludes that if Dante were not involved, the identification of the manuscript as Tuscan, ca. 1300-1320, would have been relatively unproblematic.

(The William and Katherine Devers Series in Dante Studies, 2) Presents the proceedings and discussion of the international conference on the Fiore, held at St. John's College, Cambridge, in September, 1994. "The conference, attended by most of the world's leading experts on the Fiore, examined many aspects of the poem, including textual questions, its cultural context, and its relations with the Roman de la Rose and the Com- edy. Above all, it constituted, in the judgment of the participants them- selves, the most important discussion of the poem's attribution to Dante since Contini's pronouncement on the question in 1965." The volume contains fourteen essays by the following authors (in alphabetical order): Zygmunt G. Barahski, John C. Barnes, Patrick Boyde, Domenico De Robertis, Teresa De Robertis Boniforti, Kevin Brownlee, Mark Davie, Guglielmo Gorni, Sylvia Huot, Lucia Lazzerini, Lino Leonardi, Irene Maffia Scariati, and David Robey.

Fifty numbered observations or emendations on precise details of Con- tini's critical edition of the Fiore. Nine, mostly verbal correspondences, bear upon the attribution of the Fiore to Dante; chief of these is an appar- ent allusion to the first sonnets of the Fiore in Cecco Angiolieri's sonnet Dante Allaghier, Cecco, '/ tu} servo e amico.

"The Fiore and the Early Reception of the Roman de la Rose.91 In The Fiore in Context . . . (q.v.), pp. 153-165. Emphasizes the importance of the reception and early manuscript tradi- tion of the Roman de la Rose as the context for Durante's reworking of the poem in the Fiore. For example, such manuscripts already divided the Roman into small units with rubrics identifying the speaker, as the Fiore does; the Fiore 's feminization of Bel Acueil into Bellacoglienza also has precedents in Rose manuscripts. After examining similarities and differ- ences with abridged versions of the Rose, some of which are close ana- logues to the Fiore, the author concludes that sections Durante leaves out, such as the discourse of Genius, leave traces in the Fiore, and that Durante thus probably worked from something close to the "standard text." Like other redactors of the Rose, he "sought to impose unity and brevity" on the poem, and "avoided morally ambiguous or otherwise controversial passages." [CM] Kleinhenz, Christopher.

Lazzerini, Lucia. "II Fiore, il Roman de la Rose e i precursori d'oc e d'otf." In The Fiore in Context . . . (q.v.), pp. 137-150. Examines, and counters, the argument (advanced by Arnaldo Moroldo) that the Fiore contains precise echoes of the romances of Chretien de Troyes and the Roman de Tristan, and that since Dante never mentions these texts, Dante is not the author of the Fiore. The essay examines a number of these presumed echoes, and concludes that they are either commonplaces or reflected in the Roman de la Rose itself. The same applies to the Fiore's presumed borrowings from satirical occitanic troubadours 284</page><page sequence="41">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz such as Peire Cardenal, though the polemic against clerical corruption, stimulated perhaps also by Pietro di Giovanni Olivi at Santa Croce, is certainly dear to the author of the Fiore, and may have led him to re- work the Roman de la Rose, itself quite engaged with current political and religious affairs. [CM] Leonardi, Lino. "II Fiore, il Roman de la Rose e la tradizione lirica italiana prima di Dante." In The Fiore in Context . . . (q.v.), pp. 233-264. Argues that Guittone d'Arezzo's larger sonnet cycle, which has a narra- tive line analogous to that of the Roman de la Rose, and like the Roman, the aim of ironically "de-mystifying" the traditional lyric language, func- tions as a model for the Fiore, a model the Fiore, inspired by the Roman, "hyperbolically" exceeds and dismantles. The author traces many struc- tural parallels between the Fiore and the Guittonian cycle, as well as a subtle but insistent web of allusions; the latter also sarcastically evoke the conversion of Frate Guittone. The corrosive ironic allusions of the Fiore extend to other pre-stilnovo poets, including among others Rinaldo d'A- quino, Giacomo da Lentini, and Chiaro Davanzati. The analysis supports the attribution of the Fiore to Dante. [CM] Maffia Scariati, Irene. "Fiore Inferno in fieri: Schede di letture in paral- lelo." In The Fiore in Context . . . (q.v.), pp. 273-313. Traces the genesis of specific images, themes, and formal structures, and in particular the contrapassi of Inferno 28, 21, and 22 (for the sowers of discord and the barrators), in the Fiore 's treatment or appropriation of materials in the Roman de la Rose. Often the contrapasso springs from a metaphoric use of a word in the Roman and the Fiore, which becomes concrete reality in the Inferno. The author also traces a set of descriptive patterns used in the Comedy for the devils, and shows its origin in the Roman and the Fiore. The author concludes that the Fiore is the transitional link between the Roman and the Comedy, and that the Roman mediates classical sources for Dante; the argument also supports the attribution of the Fiore to Dante. [CM] Robey, David. "The Fiore and the Comedy: Some Computerized Com- parisons." In The Fiore in Context . . . (q.v.), pp. 109-131. Presents the results of a computerized analysis of the vocabulary, rhymes, and accentual structure of the Fiore and of a sample of the Inferno, as well as of some other texts for comparison. The vocabulary of the Fiore 285</page><page sequence="42">Dante Studies, CXVII, 1999 is less rich than that of the Inferno or Paradiso, but still "considerable"; in all three texts it is greater in rhyme-position. The "range of rhymes in the Fiore is less than half as large as in the sample of Inferno," and consists largely in verbal or substantival endings; the Fiore 's rhyming practice is closer to Dante's lyric poetry. Though the Inferno has fewer non-canonical accentual structures, it has a greater variety of canonical types. The essay includes nineteen tables, and an appendix which analyzes the types and frequencies of rhymes in the entire Comedy. [CM] Teskey, Gordon. Allegory and Violence. Ithaca: Cornell University Press, 1996. xiv, 195 p. In addition to several allusions to the Divina Commedia in the course of the work, Teskey discusses in greater detail the events of Inferno 5 in Chapter One ("Personification and Capture: Francesca da Rimini," esp. pp. 25-29). Verduin, Kathleen. "Dante in America: The First Hundred Years." In Reading Books: Essays on the Material Text and Literature in America, edited by Michele Moylan and Lane Stiles (Amherst: University of Massachusetts Press, 1996), pp. 16-51. Traces Dante's promotion to cultural prominence in America by sur- veying the American publication history of Dante's works from the 1820s to the 1920s. Volumes discussed include the Works of the British [sic] Poets series (Philadelphia, 1822), the Appleton edition of Cary's transla- tion (1845), the Harper edition ofj. A. Carlyle's Inferno (1849), the Long- fellow translation (Ticknor and Fields, 1867), and the Norton translation (Houghton Mifflin, 1891-1892). Stressing that both as a literary and com- mercial commodity, "the American Dante was ... a product of the New England establishment," the essay also cites a "cultural bifurcation" of Dante into elite and popular forms by the turn of the century. [KV] Williamson, Alan. "Dante Our Contemporary?" In American Poetry Re- view, 23 (September 1, 1994), 43-53. This review essay compares two recent English renderings of the In- ferno - one by Robert Pinsky (see Dante Studies, 113 [1995], 210), the other by twenty contemporary poets (including Pinsky; edited by Daniel Halpern [see Dante Studies, 112 (1994), 302]) and proposes an interpreta- tion of the Commedia along the lines of a Jungian "Night Journey." Em- phasizing the psychological dimension of Dante's journey over allegorical 286</page><page sequence="43">American Dante Bibliography for 1998, Christopher kleinhenz readings informed by theology, Williamson examines three episodes from the Inferno - Francesca, Brunetto, and Ulysses - to show how the poet "is often at his greatest . . . when his feelings seem to strain against the limits of his system" (44). From his comparison of the two volumes, he con- cludes that while the Halpern collection "will remain an uneven, fascinat- ing museum of contemporary taste," Pinsky's version "is likely to define Dante for a generation, as Lattimore and Fitzgerald did Homer" (46).
