<plain_text><page sequence="1">568 Reports and Comments Anthropos 77.1982 Ape Language Research is Alive and Well: A Reply E. Sue Savage -Rumbaugh and Duane M. Rumbaugh Ph.D. (Language Research Center, Language Research Center, Yerkes Regional Primate Research Georgia State University Center, Emory University, Atlanta, Georgia 30322, USA) Jean Umiker-Sebeok and Thomas A. Sebeok in a paper entitled "Clever Hans and Smart Simians: The Self- Fulfilling Prophecy and Kindred Methodologicial Pitfalls" (Anthropos 76.1981: 89-165) put forth a series of arguments designed to demonstrate that language relevant research with apes is not a proper field of study. Their case against ape-language is built upon a number of assertions which are questionable and should be open to debate. In the present paper, a number of these assertions are laid out and responded to individually in order to clarify for the reader both the basic positions held by Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok, and the alternative positions which are offered here. Assertion 1: Ape-language researchers are highly critical of one another; therefore, one should dismiss all of their results as inconclusive. "The cumulative effect . . . has been ... to shift attention away . . . [from the] data . . . and onto the dubious nature of the ... procedures" (Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok 1981 : 91). Response: Disagreements among researchers in a common area of investigation are neither unusual nor improper states of affairs. Such disagreements, particularly those of a procedural nature are, in many ways, the life blood of science, particularly of the be- havioral sciences. If the disagreements seem more severe in the field of ape-language, it is only because the press has so sensationalized the claims regarding the capabilities of apes. Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok do not differentiate scientific reports from popular press accounts. They cite Desmond, for example, a journalist and author of the popular book, The Ape*s Reflexion, as one of the foremost authorities on "anthropomorphic ten- dencies among ape-language researchers." This reliance on popular sources makes dis- agreements between researchers seem far more significant than they, in fact, are. Assertion 2: Ape -language studies can be classified as either apprentissage (scientific) and/or dressage (circus performances) (95). Response: Ape-language projects are not apprentissage, they are not dressage, and they are not some combination of the two. The application of this dichotomy to ape- language work is both inappropriate and misleading. There has been no attempt to teach apes impersonal associations, "conditioned reflexes" as Hediger's (1968) definition of apprentissage requires, nor has there been any attempt to teach them to "perform certain actions at a special personal signal" as Hediger defines dressage. Instead, the goal has been to teach chimpanzees the value and potential of communication and to establish a communal base for the interpretation of symbols. To accomplish this we have structured situations to maximize the need and value of communication. We have manipulated the environment to present the chimpanzee with a problem, and then demonstrated the means to solve the problem or to solicit help (Savage-Rumbaugh, Rumbaugh, and Boysen 1978a and b). It is the solution and the problem-solving process, communicative and behavioral, which we seek to study.</page><page sequence="2">Reports and Comments 569 Assertion 3: Observational and recording errors prevent an adequate record of what the ape says from being compiled. "Methods of observation and informal testing were such that it was unclear what should be counted or recorded'* (99). Response: The keyboard system (Rumbaugh 1977) does, permit unequivocal determination of whether or not a symbol was used and of the specific symbol itself. Each instance of symbol usage is automatically recorded by the touch-sensitive plates under the symbols, and its execution and form are not a matter of human judgment. The main advantage of such a system resides in the experimenter's ability to consistently and unequivocally identify the symbolic responses of the ape. The record compiled by such a system is more accurate than those compiled by other means of behavioral research because the ape itself generates the record directly, with no intervening interpretive steps on the part of the experimenter. Assertion 4: Apes work better with some human beings than others and do not work well at all with strangers. Therefore, this indicates that some people are better at cuing them than others. Response: It is true- apes work better with some people than with others. The chimpanzees relate best to individuals who accept them, respect them, but are not fearful of them, and who can communicate well with them because trust and common world expectancies are shared. The same is true of people. We, as human beings, are uncomfor- table around those whom we feel are different from us and who behave in what seems to us to be a peculiar way. There are adaptive understandable responses in people and in chimpanzees. The existence of such phenomena should not and cannot be explained away by simply evoking the idea of Clever Hans and implying that apes talk only with those who cue them. It is also not true that apes will not talk to strangers. If a rapport can be established, symbol usage will be directed toward strangers, even to the extent of showing strangers who are unfamiliar with the keyboard which symbol to use. Assertion 5: "Exorcising Hans' spirit" (123). Circus trainers, magicians, and others who are practiced in the art of purposefully manipulating animal behavior to create the illusion of human- like activities should be called upon to investigate ape-language projects and should be at all site visits where funding is at issue (125). Response: Individuals trained in the art of public deception should not be put in the position of reviewing scientists. Whatever failings the field of ape-language may have, and all endeavors of science have a few, none of the researchers is purposefully attempt- ing to delude the public, nor is any scientific researcher trained in such an art. We are dealing with observable, quantifiable behaviors which can and have been documented under conditions that preclude experimenter cuing. Circus performers and gurus are not qualified to evaluate the serious efforts of scientists. To turn to psychics and magicians as a cure for unintentional cues by ape researchers is antiscience and anti-intellectual. If such cues are operating, it would be far more fruitful to elucidate them through scientific study than to call for a witch hunt. Assertion 6: The blind controls used in the recent work with Austin and Sherman are unsatisfactory, as they do not rule out alternative interpretations of the animals' performance. Response: In their critique of the control procedures used in this research, Umiker- Sebeok and Sebeok reveal a sincere and complete lack of understanding of the experimen- tal methodology which was employed. Therefore, a brief description of this work is presented so that the issues to be discussed will be clear to readers who may not be familiar with the work.</page><page sequence="3">570 Reports and Comments Anthropos 77.1982 In a series of studies with the chimpanzees, Sherman and Austin, we have shown that information requisite to the exchange of goods (tools) can be mediated through the use of a learned symbol system. They had learned the names and functions of six simple tools: key (that unlocked boxes and doors), money (small metal washers that activated a vending machine that dispensed food), straw (a length of plastic tubing that could be threaded through holes in walls and lids of containers to obtain liquid incentives), stick (to dip into pudding, yogurt, and so forth, from containers otherwise out of reach), sponge (to obtain liquids from a tall, vertically-mounted tube), and wrench (to unscrew bolts to open boxes for access to incentives). The names for these tools had been learned by the chimpanzees through observations of humans using the materials and through their own attempts to request and to use the tools appropriately in response to seeing in- centives baited in a variety of situations. We then wondered whether they might ask one another for tools. If only one of the chimpanzees had a set of tools, would he be responsive to requests from the other chimpanzee for a specific tool needed to obtain food in adjacent quarters? Would they comply with one another's requests? One animal was chosen as the requestor of the tool. A drink was placed in one of the various tool sites in his room while he watched. The other animal, with the set of tools, could not observe the baiting since a blind covered the window during the baiting phase (all tool sites were baited randomly across trials). The blind was raised and the chimpanzee in need of the tool could ask for it through the use of his keyboard. After a few trials during which their respective roles were reversed, the chimpanzees rapidly learned that they had to look to one another for cooperative assistance. Performance of the animals improved steadily from the very beginning. Their joint correctness (request- ing the correct tool by subject one, and compliance with the request by subject two) across the first four days was 68%, 76%, 70%, and 90%. In control tests, with the experi- menters blind, they were 92% correct. When the keyboard was not available, thereby making it impossible for the chimpanzees to tell each other which tool they needed, their performance dropped to near chance. Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok state that in this study we do not rule out acoustical, tactile, or olfactory cues. This is not true. A control procedure was run in which all acoustical, tactile, olfactory, visual, or gestural cues which could have influenced the animals' ability were available. The only thing unavailable to the animals under these conditions was their symbol system. They proved unable to tell one another which tools they needed. This control is closely detailed in the original report (Savage-Rumbaugh, Rumbaugh, and Boysen 1978a). Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok also suggest that our controls were confounded because the chimpanzees probably knew which experimenter was testing them. They point out that the chimpanzee could tell this because he could see the experimenter's hand. We find this criticism surprising. Of course the chimpanzees knew who was testing them. We never suggested that the purpose of the blind procedure was to prevent the chimpanzee from knowing who was present and who was working with him. The purpose of the blind was simply to eliminate the possibility that the chimpanzee would look to us for cues, not to disguise our identities. There is no reason to believe that the chimpanzees could select the correct symbol simply because they knew the identity of the experimenter. Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok also say that "they are not told" whether the experi- menters knew the correct tool that the chimpanzee was to request, but if they did, then they (they experimenters) could have given the animals cues regarding the correct tool to request as they were handing the tool to the chimpanzee (88). This criticism reveals the extent of Umiker-Sebeok's and Sebeok's misunderstanding of the procedures used in this study. In this test the experimenter went into the room with the chimpanzee and placed the food in a tool site (in a long tube, where a stick was needed; in a box with a padlock on it, etc.). The goal of this procedure was to have the chimpanzee watch the</page><page sequence="4">Reports and Comments 571 experimenter place the food in the tool site so that the chimpanzee would know what tool was needed to get it out. Once the chimpanzees have requested a tool, there is no reason to be concerned about cuing them when the tool is handed to them. By this point they have already made either an appropriate symbolic request or an inappropriate symbolic request and their behavior has already been recorded and evaluated. Any cue, no matter how blatant it may be, is no longer at issue; the behavior which Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok assert could be cued at this point has already occurred. Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok also assert that our final control condition in which the chimpanzees are not permitted to use symbols to request tools from one another is inade- quate. The purpose of this type of control, which has been regularly employed in our work, is to eliminate the possibility that unwittingly provided experimenter cues are beiag '*seé by the animals. Thus, this control is designed to ferret out pree being used by the animals. Thus, this control is designed to ferret out precisely those factors which Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok find of paramount concern in all ape-language studies. In this control condition, we replicate the entire situation, except that the key- board is turned off. An experimenter enters the room with a chimpanzee and baits a tool site while the chimpanzee watches. The experimenter then leaves the room and signals to have the window opened. The second experimenter opens the window and records the tool which is given. It is obvious that the first experimenter knows what tool is needed since this experimenter baited the tool site, yet Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok state that "such a testing situation only proves that the animals fail (1) when the experi- menters, unable to learn the correct responses by reading the keyboard, are truly 'blind' as they are not in the other tests" (90). This is a completely inaccurate statement. There is no test condition in which the experimenter "learns" the correct response by reading the keyboard. The experimenter knows the correct tool because he/she baited the tool site before leaving the room. The real world knowledge state of the chimpanzees and the experimenters is identical in all test conditions. The only difference is that in the con- trol condition the keyboard remains off and the first chimpanzee cannot use a symbol to tell the second chimpanzee which tool he needs. Assertion 7: The chimpanzees who have learned to communicate with symbols are not doing anything other than pigeons who have learned to chain their behaviors together with no understanding of the purpose of their communications. Response: Epstein, Lanza, and Skinner (1980) taught two pigeons linear sequences of behavior; they then linked these sequences electronically, in order to make it appear that the pigeons were communicating with one another. The authors designed this study, not to investigate the capabilities of the pigeon, but simply to try to make chimpanzees and pigeons appear to be doing the same thing. In contrast to the rote pecks of the pigeons, Sherman and Austin demonstrated that information had indeed been passed between them and that they knew the topic, nature, and specific message that had been transmitted. Thus the chimpanzee who had not seen the food placed in the container did comprehend that the symbol used by the other animal referred to that container, and to the desire to obtain the contents of that con- tainer. Because he comprehended these things, the chimp who had not seen the food was able to pick out a photograph of the contents of the container based on the information which he received from the other chimp. Prior to this, these chimps had received no training to select photographs under these or any other conditions (Savage-Rumbaugh, Rumbaugh, and Boysen 19783). Sherman and Austin were also able to use symbols to request that specific foods be given and to respond appropriately to one another's requests. Thus if Sherman has an array of foods in front of him, and Austin asks for an orange, Sherman will look over the food until he finds an orange, then give it to Austin. If he has</page><page sequence="5">572 Reports and Comments Anthropos 77.1982 difficulty sighting the orange, Austin may point to it for him. These abilities require an understanding of the nature and purpose of inter-individual communication not shown by pigeons in any study (Savage-Rumbaugh and Rumbaugh 1980). Assertion 8: Before we can use the apes to study language processes we must show that a biological homology is extant between man and ape, particularly with regard to the neurological basis of language. Response: Biological homologies exist in profusion between man and ape. The ge- netic distance between humans and chimpanzees corresponds to that between sibling species of fruit flies or mammals (King and Wilson 1975). Anatomical differences be- tween man and ape are small, with the most significant distinction being man's large cranium and bipedal stride. Structural neurological differences are virtually nonexistent, at least by present measuring techniques. The real difference between man and ape is in brain size ; a brief look at the variability of brain size within our own species clearly reveals, however, that language is not a simple function of brain size. The ape brain has even been shown to contain similar asymmetries to those of the human brain that we associate with language skills (Levy 1976). Objective knowledge of the neurobiology of language is vir- tually nonexistent as we do not yet have any adequate means of characterizing neural activity in relation to language function (Marin 1976). Until such techniques are achieved (and they do not appear to be imminent) we must be content with structural descriptions and investigations of behavioral deficits produced by unintentional lesions. The phylogenetic closeness of man and ape is not "presumed" as Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok maintain. It is in fact, very real, not matter how much some would hope to ignore it. The existence of common neurological substrates of language can, at the present time, best be determined by behavioral studies, not by anatomical ones. The emergence of spontaneous gestural communication in Sherman and Austin- marked by handedness- further supports this position (Savage-Rumbaugh 1981). After many pages of unrelenting criticism of ape-language work, what do Umiker- Sebeok and Sebeok offer? They suggest that ape-language researchers look to Oskar Pfungst: Pfungst (1965) proceeded from indirect evidence, such as his observations that, as the distance between Hans and his questioners increased, the animal's accuracy decreased, or that his performance suffered if the questioner did not know the correct answer, to direct evidence, from both observations of public performances and laboratory experiments, in which a number of elements of the question-answer procedure were systematically altered (e.g., the visual channel between man and animal was blocked). Through the painstaking application of this methodology, Pfungst was able to uncover serveral types of visual and auditory cues . . . (153). We have a succinct reply. We have conscientiously and carefully executed these sorts of controls, and many others, throughout all of our work with Austin and Sherman. We have: (1) increased the distance between experimenters and subjects; (2) used ques- tioners who did not know the answer; (3) systematically altered procedural aspects; (4) blocked the visual channel between ape and man, and much more. Recently we have used a video camera located in a static position to film symbolic interchanges between Sherman and Austin with no human present. Clever Hans' trainer was not a behavioral scientist. We are. We understand, and appreciate, and regularly employ controls. Umiker-Sebeok and Sebeok do not correctly represent the controls which have been applied. Man-ape symbolic communication is not the stuff of fiction, neither is symbolic communication between apes. It is real and readily demonstrable.</page><page sequence="6">Reports and Comments 573 References Desmond, AJ. 1979 The Ape's Reflexion. New York: Dial Press.
