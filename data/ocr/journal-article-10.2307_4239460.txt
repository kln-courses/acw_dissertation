Here are two additions to the relatively scanty shelf of books on SF film; Sobchack's valuable study is directed to the film scholar and the Pohls' rather more dispensable book is meant for the fan of SF literature and film. The Limits of Infinity is an excellent contribution to the study of American SF film as a genre. Whereas the Western and the Gangster film have earned critical respect and attention in the past 15 years, the SF film is still all too often dismissed as "trash" or confused with horror or other fantasy films. Until now, the major work on SF film has been John Baxter's Science Fiction in the Cinema (NY: Paperback Library, 1970), which makes a distinction between SF literature and, SF film: "Science fiction supports logic and order, SF film illogic and chaos. Its roots lie not in the visionary literature of the Nineteenth Century, to which science fiction owes most of its origins, but in older forms and attitudes, the medieval fantasy world, the era of the masque, the morality play and the Grand Guignol" (Baxter, p. 10). Baxter considers SF film to be anti-science and its themes to be "'the loss of individuality and the threat of knowledge" (p. 11). Sobchack takes issue with Baxter's assumptions. First, she notes that "not all SF literature is proscience and not all SF film is antiscience" (p. 21). Instead, there is a spectrum of attitudes in both the literature and the films, and Baxter is confusing SF with horror. Sobchack finds it useful to view horror and SF as two ends of a spectrum. Both genres involve an interaction between magic, science, and religion, because all three modes attempt to describe and confront the unknown. What separates the genres is "the domi- nant emphasis given to either the sacred or the profane" (p. 58), with SF film emphasizing the empirical method of science, while sometimes still acknow- ledging the realms of magic and religion (Kubrick's 2001 is a good example). Sobchack makes some useful distinctions between the Monster of the horror film, who is always anthropomorphic and sympathetic because he represents the darker side of man, and the Creature of the SF film, who is simply a thing without a soul and creates large-scale social chaos. "Ultimate- ly, the horror film evokes fear, the SF film interest" (p.43). Sobchack also dismisses the stereotype that SF film is inherently anti- intellectual because it must appeal to a mass audience. She notes that both SF literature and film are fictions in which ideas are secondary. Both tell stories which may provoke the reader or the viewer to draw abstract conclu- sions. Invoking Sturgeon's Law that "90% of everything is crud," she asserts that the number of bad SF films indicates nothing about the potentiality of the medium-they are simply more visible and more long-lived than the number of bad SF novels and stories.</page><page sequence="2">94 SCIENCE-FICTION STUDIES, VOLUME 9 (1982) The remainder of her book is a detailed study of the iconography and use of language, music, and sound effects in American SF film: the look and sound which characterize the genre. Unlike the Western or Gangster film, in which such icons as the railroad or the automobile have a constant (because historically determined) meaning, the iconography of SF film shifts in value from film to film. The spaceship, for example, can be a positive image in Destination Moon, a negative one in 2001, and a neutral piece of equipment, like a car, in The Angry Red Planet. The same is true for the robot, which changes shape and meaning from one film to the next. Sobchack concludes that SF film because it presents a universe which is unfixed and constantly changing, results in a "plasticity of objects and settings" (p. 87) which differentiates it fundamentally from the relatively static world of other American film genres. Sobchack also finds an interesting visual tension in all SF film, which must strive for believability by linking the alien and the familiar, the unknown and the known. Big-budget SF films, she claims, are "visually optimistic" since "the infinite is introduced and made finite, the unknown is made familiar" (p. 110). Low-budget SF films, on the other hand, are visually pessimistic since the opposite process takes place, and the familiar is made to appear alien. Shochack is particularly good at analyzing the process of defamiliarization in some 1950s' SF films, such as Them and It Came from Outer Space, whereby terrestrial landscapes like the desert are made to seem suddenly alien and threatening to human existence. Sobchack further speculates that the usually banal dialogue of the American SF film may sometimes be a deliberate way "to create credibility and lend a documentary quality" in the face of the incredible happenings in the plot (p. 154). She laments the pretentious talkiness into which SF film often descends when it tries to sound "serious" and contrasts that with the deliberate paucity of dialogue in 2001. Finally, she finds most SF film music unadventurous but believes that, as if to compensate and add to the cred- ibility of the stories, such films have made very creative use of synchronized sound effects originating from the images. In her conclusion, Sobchack emphasizes the visual and aural tension between the known and the unknown as the essence of American SF film, and the reason for both its success and failures. "Images and language, flights of imagination and retreats into banality, seem always in contradictory com- bination .... the aims of the American SF film are by nature grandiose and paradoxical. The American SF film finally attempts to achieve the impossible - it attempts to limit the infinite" (pp. 223-24). In its concern with the iconog- raphy of the SF film and the tension between the known and the unknown, Sobchack's study seems complementary to Gary K. Wolfe's recent study of SF literature, The Known and the Unknown: The Iconography of Science Fiction (Kent, OH: Kent State UP, 1979). The main drawback of Sobchack's study is that, since SF film moves so fast, her book was already dated when it appeared. Although published in 1980, it only covers American SF film from 1950 to 1975. The book seems to have been completed in 1975 and lain in a drawer for years (the bibliography, while extensive, only goes up to 1974). Some brief footnotes about and photos referring to Star Wars and Close Encounters have been hastily added in an attempt to update it, but these additions are insufficient. The Pohls' Science Fiction: Studies in Film (an odd title; shouldn't it be Studies in SF Film?), however, is very much up to date: it covers both European and American SF film from Melies's A Trip to the Moon (1902) to</page><page sequence="3">SCIENCE-FICTION FILM CRITICISM 95 Lucas's The Empire Strikes Back (1980). Unfortunately, it says little that is new. In The Limits of Infinity, Sobchack notes the lack of true criticism of SF film; what we get instead are picture books and histories stuffed with plot summaries, skimming over the surface of the genre. The Pohls' book is yet another superficial history of the field. Frederik Pohl, the distinguished SF writer and editor, and his son, a filmmaker, seemed to feel that, considering the enormous and growing popularity of SF film in the last five years, the time was ripe for a new survey of the field from the point of view of an expert on SF literature. But Pohl merely perpetuates Baxter's argument that SF film is mostly irrational, anti- scientific stuff, "sci-fi" instead of true "SF." "Sci-fi pleases the senses and stimulates the glands. But if is not likely ever to stir the intellect" (p. 267). As Sobchack demonstrates, this sterotype is tired and untrue. The first half of the volume is a rapid, selective history of SF cinema from the beginnings to 1936 and Things to Come. The second half covers the films from 1950 to the present (strangely, they decided there were no SF films worthy of the name made between 1936 and 1950) and concludes with a chapter on how SF films are made and an appendix on special effects. There are footnotes but no bibliography or index. The most annoying feature of the book is the frequent inserts, containing film credits and selections from reviews and interviews, some useful and some not. This spliced-in material constantly interrupts the flow of the text. The book is over-heavy on fannish trivia: How much did Karloff's Frankenstein makeup weigh? How big was King Kong? It is written in a breezy style sometimes bordering on vulgarity: The Invisible Man was "Wellsian rather than socko" (p. 72) and Orwell wrote 1984 "as a buck-hustle" (p. 139). (Some of the same tendency to vulgarity flaws Frederik Pohl's novels also.) Most of the book consists of plot summaries and capsule evaluations of the merits and demerits of particular films. Nevertheless, there are numerous errors in the summaries. For example, the Master of Metropolis is named "John Fredersen" not "John Masterman" (at least he was in the version I saw), and Fredersen at the end shakes hands with the foreman of the workers, not "the leader of the workers' revolt" (p. 43). On the contrary, the foreman tries to stop the revolt; what he leads is the mob's burning of the robot Maria. And Billy Pilgrim in Slaughterhouse Five was a prisoner of war assigned to work in Slaughterhouse Number Five, not "in the pens located at #5 Slaughterhouse Street" (p. 214). The radio signal in On the Beach is not caused by "a broken electrical connection, blown in the wind" (p. 140) but by the random tapping of a morse key by a Coke bottle caught in a window blind. Aside from these errors, many of the plots are scrambled by their condensations. This is not entirely to condemn the book. The authors provide a compendium of useful information (and some not so useful) for the person interested in the field and eager to know more. Their knowledge of SF literature enables them to pinpoint all the logical absurdities in the premises and plots of many of the films. Their judgments of individual films are generally sound. Moreover, they are are particularly good at demystifying special effects and explaining the business aspects of film-how SF films actually get made (mostly by committee, and through financial consider- ations). Nevertheless, unlike the Sobchack volume, the Pohls break little new ground in the study of SF film and so have little to offer the scholar or critic of such films.</page></plain_text>
