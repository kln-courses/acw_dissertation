Materialism, Positivism, Darwinism, Marxism, Leibnizianism, neo-Kantianism, Nietzscheanism, Decadence, Sym bolism, Naturalism, the ideas and esthetics of Tolstoi, Dostoevsky, the Populists, and Vladimir Solov'?v: all these and more criss crossed and cross-fertilized. Distortion, dilution, and elaboration inevitably occurred. Yet, while no neat topographical chart may ever be achieved, some salient features do emerge. The fin-de-si?cle found many young Russians deeply absorbed by literary and philosophical questions while looking for a break through into 'modernity.' Articles and debates in journals like Vestnik Evropy [Herald of Europe], Severnyi vestnik [Northern Messenger], and Voprosy filosofii i psikhologii [Questions of Philosophy and Psychology], the plays of Ibsen and Maeterlinck, the new French poetry, and the paintings of Boecklin and Vrubel' all fed the sense of its imminence. Some of these people, soon to figure in the Rus sian Symbolist and Decadent movements, were university students following the lectures of the neo-Kantian Aleksandr Vvedenskii in St. Petersburg and the philosopher-psychologists Nikolai Grot and Lev Lopatin in Moscow.1 These students' notebooks, diaries, and correspondence often show a deep concern with questions bearing on their understanding of themselves and of the universe. The 'new' ideas coming from the West both sharpened these questions and fueled the search for answers. Studies in East European Thought 47: 179-193,1995. ? 1995 Kluwer Academic Publishers.

By the early 1890's nearly all the writings of Germany's leading neo-Kantians were already translated and being discussed in Russia's intellectual establishments. St. Petersburg University was the center of 'academic neo-Kantianism,' but philosophy chairs in many other institutions were held by sympathizers. Indeed, while few Russians were genuine neo-Kantians, most public philosophical discussion in lectures and on the pages of serious journals was carried on within parameters set by neo-Kantianism.2 While the effort to reconcile philosophy and the natural sciences defined a common tendency, the 'neo-Kantianisms' most welcome in Russia were those who tilted away from materialism. But Rus sian thought's eclecticism guaranteed other approaches as well. Spinoza, Leibniz, and modern thinkers like Eduard von Hartmann were invoked to address questions on the nature and validity of knowledge, the T's relation to the world of phenomena, the nature of consciousness, and the extent and reality of human freedom. This paper will examine one specific feature of this discussion: the resurgence of pantheism and its implications for modern thought. The ancient notion of a universe animated throughout by a single life-force obviously offered a fresh approach to these questions. For example, pantheism and its variant panpsychism proposed a rela tionship of the ' F to the external world radically different from other views. The questions of causality and freedom likewise appeared in a new light. These were matters of great moment in the world of early Symbolism, where art and philosophy were closely linked. 1. PHILOSOPHY AND THE 'NEW ART': BRIUSOV AND KONEVSKOI The Russian pioneers in the 'new art' were a philosophically-minded company. While redefining the role of art and the artist, they sought also to frame a new world-view. Two of the new poets, Valerii Briusov and Ivan Konevskoi, left writings that illuminate these twin endeavors with particular clarity, making them credible spokesmen for their cohort. By the early 1900's Symbolism was the dominant artistic move ment in Russia, and Valerii Briusov (1873-1924) was its acknowl</page><page sequence="3">SYMBOLIST DEBATES IN THE 1890'S 181 edged leader. The role of Ivan Konevskoi (pen name of Ivan Oreus, 1877-1901) was a different one, sometimes likened to that of Venevitinov in the Pushkin circle. Acquainted early with European art and thought, he has been ranked in retrospect among Russia's dis tinguished philosophical poets. After his accidental death, a volume of Konevskoi's poetry and prose edited by Briusov served to define him for subsequent eras. Recent research has again focussed attention on this gifted poet, an original figure in a remarkable generation. By the time he met Briusov late in 1898, Konevskoi was a con vinced pantheist, likely influenced by Vladimir Solov'ev's important essay on the poet Tiutchev.3 Briusov was first interested in Spinozan pantheism but then moved on to Leibniz and individualism.4 Konevskoi in St. Petersburg and Briusov in Moscow studied with Vvedenskii, Lopatin, and Grot, but their interests reached well beyond the lecture hall. What Solov'?v wrote of Tiutchev can be applied also to Konevskoi: "He fully and consciously believed in that which he felt... and understood it not as his own imagining but as truth."5 This belief was confirmed for Konevskoi by his reported mystical experience in a Thuringian mountain forest in the summer of 1897.6 A Symbolist poet's pantheism is easily read as a late fruit of Roman ticism. Yet Konevskoi was also engaged in the search for a common ground between science and philosophy and even mysticism. In short, his position typified that of a generation that read Lange 's History of Materialism and Spencer's First Principles and studied William James's psychology while writing Symbolist poetry. 2. PANTHEISM AND PANPSYCHISM: THE WORK OF FRIEDRICH PAULSEN In the later nineteenth century, pantheism figured prominently among the 'alternate beliefs' attracting those on whom traditional religion's hold had weakened but not totally dissolved.7 Modern 'idealistic pantheism's' particular appeal lay in its challenge to materialism's exclusive claim to the keys to nature's secrets. The Berlin neo Kantian Friedrich Paulsen based his system, which he called by that name, on Spinoza's theory of mind-body parallelism, later modified by Leibniz and Gustave Fechner.</page><page sequence="4">182 JOAN DELANEY GROSSMAN Pantheism's modern European history begins in the sixteenth cen tury with Giordano Bruno, but its later development is closely linked to the name of Benedict (Baruch) Spinoza (1632-1677). His version of pantheism being condemned as atheism, Spinoza was ostracized in his lifetime but rehabilitated during the pantheist controversy in Germany in the 1780's. One historian called the rise of Spinozism then "a phenomenon of no less significance than the emergence of Kantianism itself."8 His reasons might apply equally to a later time: "Spinoza's pantheism seemed to be a viable middle path between a discredited theism and deism on the one hand and a ruthless materi alism and atheism on the other hand."9 Friedrich Paulsen's Introduction to Philosophy offers a strong, detailed defense of pantheism, which he positions between materi alist and purely spiritualist approaches to the world. First printed in German in 1892, it was soon translated into Russian and published by the Moscow Psychological Society.10 An English translation appeared in 1895 with a preface by William James. James's reaction is of interest, especially considering his authority in Russia at that time. Despite a few significant reservations, he greeted Paulsen's book with enthusiasm. First of all he saw in it a corrective to the natural sciences' drift toward atomistic materialism, for which the problem of consciousness is insoluble. Moreover, Paulsen's concep tion implied a vast reservoir of knowledge in the conscious universe: "the Soul of the larger totals (the globe which we inhabit and the starry heaven itself) involving our rational souls, as it does, also knows all that our reason lets us know and much more besides."11 James here refers to a feature of pantheism that held major interest for the later nineteenth century. The term 'panpsychism' was begin ning to be used to denote the belief that the universe and all beings in it possess a shared inner psychic life.12 Paulsen's argument for panpsychism relies on Spinoza's theory of physical and psychical parallelism. Since the new mechanical physics denied the possibil ity of reciprocal action between these two states of being, he calls on Spinoza to explain the undoubted link between them. Body and soul, according to Spinoza, "are really the same thing, looked at from different points of view. A state of movement and a state of consciousness are at bottom the same process, seen at one time from without, at another from within."13 Beginning from this point</page><page sequence="5">SYMBOLIST DEBATES IN THE 1890'S 183 Paulsen develops his argument that consciousness - 'soul-life' - may and must extend over the entire organic world and finally over the universe.14 Clearly delighted by his conception and his argument, Paulsen at times slips into a mode verging on the poetic. If our body belongs to a larger All, he asks, is our psychical life also articulated with ... a more comprehensive system of consciousness? Are the separate heavenly bodies... bearers of a unified inner life? Are the stars, is the earth an animated being? The poets speak of the earth-spirit; is that more than a poetic metaphor? The Greek philosophers, among them Plato and Aristotle, speak of astral spirits; is that more than the last reflection of a dream of childish fancy?15 He adds cautiously: "It would be presumptuous foolishness to treat of these subjects in dogmatic definitions and arguments. Still ... a negative dogmatism is equally out of place."16 For Paulsen and many like-minded thinkers, pantheism is not only esthetically satisfying, it is the only world-view that makes sense of everything humankind now knows about itself and the world and that accommodates the conscious mind. It is "the only one which harmonizes soul-life with the rest of the world, and for the first time makes its origin and existence conceivable." With pantheism, he concludes, "mind may feel at home in the world; it may regard itself as flesh of its flesh and bone of its bone."17 3. IVAN KONEVSKOI: MODERN PANTHEIST Friedrich Paulsen's work was studied in, among other places, Iakov Erlikh's circle in St. Petersburg, which Ivan Konevskoi frequented. The group had "a strongly expressed idealist and mystical character, with a leaning toward pantheism. Spinoza and Leibniz, Schelling and Goethe, Vladimir Solov'?v and Paulsen were the most important names."18 If some of these names cast a Romantic tinge on their pantheism, Paulsen's updated version of Spinoza's psycho-physical parallelism served to anchor it in a theory if not verifiable, at least logically deduced.19 And logic was a necessity for modern pantheist mystics like Ivan Konevskoi. Intuiting reality as a physical-spiritual whole, they were bent on penetrating its inner life. Yet, born late in the nineteenth century, they had to take into account not only</page><page sequence="6">184 JOAN DELANEY GROSSMAN Spinoza, Kant, and Goethe, but Darwin, Spencer, and the whole complex of modern scientific and philosophical thought. The Erlikh circle's enthusiasm was a symptom of renewed Russian interest in Spinoza.20 Contributing to this was Vladimir Solov'ev's 1897 polemical response to Aleksandr Vvedenskii's article resurrecting the old charge of atheism against Spinoza.21 Vvedenskii's attack provoked Solov'ev's 'Poniatie o B?ge' [The Conception of God], sub-titled 'In Defense of the Philosophy of Spinoza.' The controversy focussed primarily on Vvedenskii's insistence that Spinoza's 'All-One' did not meet the criterion of personhood in God. Calling that view narrowly anthropomorphic, Solov'?v proposes for the Divinity the epithet 'sverkh-lichno,' the attributive of ' super-personhood. ' Of pantheism he speaks somewhat nostalgically: "The pantheistic sense of communion with the all-one substance gives a deep religious exaltation to the world-views of such minds as Spinoza's and Goethe's."22 Konevskoi once listed for a close friend what for him constituted life's delights: "Creative work, comprehending the World's soul and the meaning of our existence, penetrating by direct feeling into the secret essence of things."23 However naive this statement, its utter seriousness is not open to question. Also worth noting is the close link it assumes between creative work (poetry), philosophical thought, and intuitive cognition. Describing Konevskoi's "monologism and unity of personality," Aleksandr Lavrov wrote: "Verse, prose, critical article, diary, letter - all these were for him means of reinforcing his own observations and thought."24 Indeed, for Konevskoi philos ophy and poetry were essentially two sides of the same coin, while intuition was the instrument of both. Long before he knew Konevskoi, Valerii Briusov chided P. P. Pertsov, the editor of the anthology Filosofskie techeniia v russkoi poezii [Philosophical Trends in Russian Poetry] (1896), for con fusing the notion of philosophical poetry with versified ideas that could be expressed as clearly in prose. Poetry is rather "a special attitude toward the world, oneself, the unknowable."25 Much later, Briusov credited Konevskoi's influence on his own understanding of poetry: "I am in debt to Konevskoi for teaching me to value the depth of thought in a poetic work, - its philosophic or genuinely symbolic meaning."26 Though more inclined than Konevskoi to</page><page sequence="7">SYMBOLIST DEBATES IN THE 1890'S 185 insist on poetry's independent and unique character, Briusov shared his conviction that the poet penetrates the universe through explor ing his own soul. (Leibniz's monadology played no small role in Briusov's thinking.) Though virtually all Konevskoi's poetry is 'philosophical' in Briusov's sense, he tried several times to set down his world-view in prose. His earliest effort at this (1893-1894) presents Kant and 'thought' as the heroes and Eduard von Hartmann's pessimism as the villain. That piece was ethical in its emphasis. But in a letter of November, 1897, Konevskoi stressed that he was now preoccu pied with "questions of the world-structure and the deepening and sharpening of my esthetic sense."27 For him these concerns were inseparable and mutually supporting. However, when a third element - mystical experience - entered the picture, the symmetry was upset. In a letter of October 1898 Konevskqi confessed that this new, long-desired element had brought on a disturbing conflict that seriously interfered with the logical thought he also prized. He described the effects of his profound encounters with nature the previous summer: "With great alarm I often notice that this access into my nature of waves of elemental, non-human life blurs, threatens to wipe out entirely very much that is strongly conscious, much powerful logical thought." Then in tortured prose he voices his suspicion that this penetration of nature occurs not through his organized personality, but through that other self "that has contact with something imperceptible to my usual senses .... that other consciousness that appears in a somnambulist's dream Earlier, in July, 1897, Konevskoi describes in very similar terms his first experience in the Thuringian forest. Alone at dusk he began chanting lines from Tiutchev and Fet: In those moments I felt that not I, not that which ordinarily calls itself T, was speaking: strange, unexpected sounds burst from my breast. This was no longer my narrow, everyday T. Through me spoke something all-seeing: night itself.29 William James has proposed four characteristics to distinguish a generic mystical experience: ineffability, noetic quality, transiency, and passivity.30 According to his own account, Konevskoi's expe rience fully meets the criteria. James's subjects claimed that the experience "defies description, that no adequate report of its con</page><page sequence="8">186 JOAN DELANEY GROSSMAN tents can be given in words." Konevskoi attempts here and in another sketch a few days later, to describe not only his spiritual condition during the encounter, but his bodily sensations as well. Yet he readily admits that at the core of the experience lies something that cannot be expressed verbally.31 The mystical states that James reports seem "more like states of feeling than states of intellect." Yet, he observes in his second point, they "seem to those who experience them to be also states of knowledge. They are states of insight into depths of truth unplumbed by the discursive intellect.... all inarticulate though they remain."32 James's fourth criterion, passivity, includes 'preliminary volun tary operations' such as those prescribed in manuals of mysticism. Konevskoi was not the naive mystic whose visions come all unsought or unforeseen. He had investigated the matter and undoubtedly knew about the preparatory steps which all the great religious mystics have described. His first mystical experience began with his chanting lines from the poems of Tiutchev and Fet. It is not quite clear whether this was a totally 'voluntary operation' or whether it was 'inspired' by the atmosphere in which he found himself immersed. In any case, as he relates, he soon found his conscious self a passive participant. Nonetheless, while searching for 'the secret essence of things,' Konevskoi seems almost to have been conducting a quasi-scientific experiment. He describes a near encounter between two "existences, infinitely distant from one another," from which he draws back at the last instant.33 As the moment of encounter approaches he reports a sense of threat. Was it a threat to his personality's integrity? The presumed existence of another self within has a long history in world culture. However, accounts of manifestations that in Europe decades earlier would have been material for fantastic fiction now drew scientific attention, not least from the developing field of exper imental psychology. In this new era, the so-called 'occult' was not at all the exclusive preserve of the eccentric, the fanatic, or the guile less. In his letter of October, 1898, Konevskoi mentions the German scientist-turned-mediumist Baron Carl Du Prel. Author of books on psychic subjects, Du Prel had a wide readership.34 Konevskoi's reference here to Du Prel's book Spiritism testifies to his and his peers' compulsion to follow any leads whatever that might throw light on this mystery of the unconscious self.</page><page sequence="9">SYMBOLIST DEBATES IN THE 1890'S 187 Nor were these wanderings from the comparatively straight lines of philosophy and science considered at the time to be aberrant. It should be noted that boundaries between intellectual disciplines were not nearly so clear then as they may look in retrospect. Moreover, those who grew up reading Darwin, Marx, Spencer, and Cherny shevskii and became Symbolist or Decadent poets - or chemists, or biologists - saw themselves as explorers of a rapidly expanding reality. Such pursuits might lead anywhere. Moreover, 'reality' might be the mind, conscious or unconscious, or the human personality. Meanwhile, early in 1898, Konevskoi undertook again to lay out his world-view. The title of the resulting draft essay makes clear his preoccupation with contemporary thought: 'Kraeugol'nye kamni moego mirovozreniia' ['The Foundation-Stones of my World view'], subtitled 'I-Not-I. Finity: Space, Time.'35 The fact that, reading through it, one can easily trace his sources does not mean that the effort was superficial or totally derivative. Long after his death, Briusov wrote that "Kant, Schopenhauer, and Nietzsche prompted much that seemed to Konevskoi to be his own treasured thoughts."36 Yet here he openly acknowledged and addressed these sources and others. In this piece Konevskoi tries bravely to confront the thinkers he respected and, with or without their help, to argue out a position that reconciled his pantheism with his profound sense of the human per sonality's inviolability. Traditional pantheism assumed the eventual dissolution of the individual in the 'All-One.' But implied through out this essay is the vital question: How was the pantheist to merge with the universe and also retain his individual persona? The ideal answer, toward which Konevskoi groped, seems to require a change in the way human perception works - or in the way Kant says it works, which Konevskoi does not challenge. The a priori forms, space and time, which create the barriers between the T and the 'Not-I,' are briefly erased in ecstatic moments. Their total annihilation would go a long way to solve the problem. Yet, however much I experience ecstasies which may evoke in me the sense of universal life's tremor, there remains always before me something that, no matter if I share even in the life of that universal Being, still bars my way to that Being, is felt to be always overcoming my powers. That something is the force of space and time, which determines the separateness of my T and the fragmentation of its</page><page sequence="10">188 JOAN DELANEY GROSSMAN perceptions .... Perhaps that law's force is not all-powerful, but, in any case, no force at our disposal can abolish it.37 Frustrating as this was, Konevskoi continued to seek a solution through the two extra-rational 'forces' to which he had established access: poetry and mystical experience. He came to conceive an expansion of the human personality which would make it co-exten sive with the 'Being' in nature and permit their union. In 1900 he labored over an article called 'Misticheskoe chuvstvo v russkoi lirike' ['Mystical Feeling in the Russian Lyric'], where he wrote: By 'mystical feeling' is understood a special sensitivity to all that is hidden from ordinary human causal knowing and average personal instinct and perception. It is the sense of existing in states of consciousness lying outside the perception of objects possible in ordinary conditions. It is the union of personal consciousness with the being of its objects, the enlargement of the sphere of its self-awareness [samochuvstviia] .38 These states were brief, however: the famous migi [instants] of the Symbolist poets. Konevskoi wanted much more. 4. BRIUSOV: PANTHEISM VS. PERSONALISM Shortly after his first acquaintance with Konevskoi's poetry, Valerii Briusov drafted an article in which he pointed to the potential dilem ma facing its implied world-view: the same with which Konevskoi struggled in the essay just cited. Presumably he had not read the essay and so far was unaware of Konevskoi's frustration. Instead, admiration and perhaps a note of envy is heard in his description: Here is a bold and free linking of pantheism with the question of personal being, pantheism with monadology. His worship of nature is everywhere .... The love of mountains, winds, the forest, the sea, is the same as Shelley's. But equally powerful in him is the consciousness of his own ego.39 When faced himself with this dilemma, Briusov opted for Leibniz and monadology over Spinoza and pantheism. A note in his archive explains his choice. In pantheism, he held, "the personality disap peared in a faceless divinity," making "the soul the plaything of the law of causality."40 Briusov was no mystic and he did not share Konevskoi's worship of nature; instead, another force drove him. As one scholar acutely observed: "Briusov's individualism, youthfully naive and youth fully aggressive, found its basis in his reinterpretation of Leibniz's</page><page sequence="11">SYMBOLIST DEBATES IN THE 1890'S 189 philosophy."41 Enthusiasm for Leibniz and his teachings was strong at Moscow University in the 1890's owing especially to the influ ence of Professor Lev Lopatin. Briusov wrote his senior thesis on Leibniz under Lopatin's direction and obviously his world-view in those years owed much to the experience. Lopatin modified Leibniz's monadology to allow communication between monads, while main taining their independent status. His (and other) views are reflected in Briusov's essay 'O iskusstve' ['About Art'] (1899): Man as a person is separated from others by seemingly impassible barriers. The T is self-sufficient, a creative force, that draws all its future from within. The world is my representation. I am given only my thoughts, my sensations, my desires - nothing and never anything more. From this isolation the soul passionately strives for communication. In union with another is its bliss. And union is possible.42 The crucial point for Briusov, as for Konevskoi, was the inde pendence and inviolability of the lichnosf', the personality; Leibniz provided a foundation for this belief. His friend Mikhail Samygin, a pantheist, discussed with him pantheism, personality, and like sub jects. In one exchange of letters they discussed Vladimir Solov'ev's 'Pervoe nachalo teoreticheskoi filosofii' ['The First Principle of Theoretical Philosophy'], which began appearing in 1897.43 Briusov considered Solov'?v insufficiently definite about the independent existence of the 'I.' He wrote to Samygin: "So pantheism is think able! possible for the mind! - Then how am I to save ... my lichnosf [personality], for I want to know, to know unconditionally, that this lichnosf is one, independent, that I am a monad. This is essential to ?44 me. Briusov soon emerged from his extreme Leibnizian phase. This strong individualism later blended with other influences and perhaps was modified by some.45 Yet his world-view remained staunchly individualist, or personalist, at least for the next decade, that is, during the ascendancy of Symbolism. This alone was enough to separate him from those - Belyi, Blok, Ivanov - who believed them selves the heirs of Solov'?v (though Belyi became an ardent neo Kantian as well). 'O iskusstve,' to which he gave great importance, was written at the height of his Leibnizianism. As R. E. Pomirchii wrote, this essay "allows us to establish the dependence of Briusov's views on the neo-Leibnizian, personalist line of Russian philosophy of the late nineteenth century."46</page><page sequence="12">190 JOAN DELANEY GROSSMAN In Russian thought of the 1890's, as in that of Germany and of Europe generally, Kant was everywhere, if only because his ideas provided the standard against which other ideas were tested. Yet if neo-Kantianism in its various forms reigned in Germany, in Russia eclecticism held sway. As already seen, Spinoza, Leibniz, and others played key roles. No single philosophical world-view dominated, but if some of the more interesting trial models were developed by non philosophers, this was typical of the Russian tradition, where the overlap of philosophy and literature has a long history. In the latter sphere, the great creative display of the next two decades was in preparation. But before that could occur, a new situation, a new world-space, for the artist had to be created. This was no matter for easy agreement. As a whole, Russian Symbolism after 1900 took a direction different from those Konevskoi, Briusov, and a few others explored. Its theurgic art was far removed from the art which was centered in the soul of the individual artist. Individualism was the essence of Decadence. Yet the desired breakthrough into modernity occurred, whatever forms it took, and it produced new ways of thinking about the self and the universe, inner and outer. If credit for this must be widely distributed, a substantial measure yet belongs to the adventurous generation of the 1890's. NOTES While historians agree that the only Russian philosopher who can, strictly speak ing, be called neo-Kantian was Aleksandr Vvedenskii, a movement toward Kant can be found elsewhere, for example, in "the revision of Marxism undertaken by S. N. Bulgakov and the dynamic spiritualism [in the philosophical sense] of L. M. Lopatin." See L. I.
