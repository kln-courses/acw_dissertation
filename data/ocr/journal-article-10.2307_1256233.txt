<plain_text><page sequence="1">202 Reviews. A BOOK OF THE BASQUES. By RODNEY GALLOP. Macmillan &amp; Co., 193O. 8" x 51". Pp. xii +294. 26 pl. +56textill. 15s. ENGLISH literature up to the present has entirely lacked a book of general information on the Basques and their much talked of country. At the end of the nineteenth century, Mr. Wentworth Webster, sometime English Chaplain at St. Jean-de-Luz, published a small part of his Basque studies in his native tongue. After his publications we skip more than a generation before we find a useful little book, The Basques and their Country, by P. S. Ormond.' This is full of sound matter, and should have done something towards scotching the more flagrant errors con- cerning the country. Unfortunately other books, " armchair travel " books, easier to read, have appeared, and, the flood of fashion setting in earnest towards this exquisite corner of Europe, visitors, French and English, are ready to swallow anything and everything written about the region. Now at last tourist and student alike may find in Mr. Gallop's book a staff which will not break in their hands. It is written for the general reader, but those who really wish to study the country should keep it by them. It fills gaps between special branches of study, and gives a correct though bird's eye view of Basque doings. I first examine the chapters dealing with folk song, folk dance, folktales, and proverbs, but every page contains material precious to the folklorist. See for example the list of words (p. 85) used to-day for sharp-edged instruments, containing the root aitz, i.e. stone or flint. This list has appeared elsewhere, but it is none the less useful to find it in an English work, and it may be digested by philologist, anthropologist, and folklorist alike. Mr. Gallop has so much to say on folk song,-this is his speciality, -that he divides his chapter into two parts. Truth to tell, the words of Basque songs are not of great interest, nor of poetical value. But, as always, good grain may be found amongst the chaff. Note the song of Berterretche, founded on a local tragedy; the houses named exist to-day, and strange it is to trace the paths down which ran the terror-stricken mother " as she sped past Bostmendieta." 1 Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent, and Co., 1926.</page><page sequence="2">Reviews. 203 The love songs are charming ; the maiden is addressed as " white wood pigeon " or " newborn star," and, though Mr. Gallop does not remark upon it, they reflect that surprising freedom per- mitted unmarried couples of which I will say more presently. There are examples of Christmas carols, wassailing songs, songs for St. Agatha's day, and those which accompany the tobera and the May Queens. Pp. 130-5 are of the greatest interest. This division ends with a description of a competition between im- provising poets. If Mr. Gallop had heard the personal mkchan- cetes which on one occasion proceeded from the mouth of wicked little Mattin de St. PWe, his description would not have been written in so kindly a vein. The opponent found his inspiration dried up through fury and dismay. The division on the music of the folk song gives a wealth of examples, ranging from the tune made of two tones only, to the splendidly soaring Belatsa, supposed to represent the flight of the buzzard, and sung without words by the shepherds of La Soule. Page 156 contains some seasonable remarks on the zortziko, that I measure generally supposed to represent Basque music. Chap. ix gives a brief insight into the folktales and proverbs, and if folklorists search for originalities they will be disappointed. In spite of the peculiar twist given by the Basque, his tales remain the tales of most European countries. Cherry of Zennor, for instance, which Mr. Gallop does not relate, exists almost word for word in Basque. Fairies are laminak, and to-day are sadly confused by the younger generation with Basa Andreak (" the wild ladies "), and even with witches. The chapter on folk dance contains essential information concerning the great dancing ceremonies, from the Sword Dances of the Spanish Basque provinces to the mascarades and cavalcades of the French Basque provinces. Nevertheless, a great deal remains unsaid on this immense subject. Choice " little " dances of high folkloric value such as the Apple Dance (Sagar Dantza) of Baztan, the dance on the walls of the stream which runs through Lesaca, the varieties of Stick Dances all over the country are not described. The Christian religious dances for Corpus Christi are neglected, and the Ffte-Dieu dancing processions have to rest content with a few lines. Yet these survivals in Spain, and modern (that is to</page><page sequence="3">204 Reviews. say Napoleonic) folk manifestations in France, are far more curious than the rather stilted Guipuzcoan Sword Dance. I particularly like the pen and ink drawing of Arcos Grandes, and the remarks on the alboka, the cowhorn instrument made by shepherds, are interesting. For a drawing of the Ttun-ttun or Tambourin de Gascogne we must turn to page 99, and for a slight description of the very ancient Saut Basque we must look at page 104. The Soule mascarades are well dealt with, but I do not agree with the remarks on the gelding of the Hobbyhorse. At one time I thought this operation might have taken the place of the ritual death. But I now perceive that the Horse still dies through his symbolic " hoisting," which hoisting itself is nearly but not quite obsolete. To me the catching, shoeing, and gelding are accretions of yesterday, brought in to suit the taste of a famous horse-breeding country. Another chapter shows the motifs of a somewhat crude decorative art, and gives the drawing of an argizaiola,-a flat wooden shape round which funeral candles are wound, thought to be anthropomorphic in origin. That given as an illustration (p. 219) is of less suggestive design than many. We can study also the discoidal tombstones so characteristic of Basque churchyards. The differences and like- nesses of the Pays Basque and the Pais Vasco are thoughtfully considered. The account of the pastorales,-those still living descendants of the miracle play,-is altogether delightful. The chapter on the character of the Basque needs a closer survey than I can give it. So much rubbish has been written about the race, that one is thankful to find here a cool-headed appreciation. Pierre Loti's Ramuntcho set the fashion for the imaginative, yearning, romantic Basque,-a person who most assuredly never existed. Two best-sellers from across the water are extremely harmful to the perception of their readers,-again such a Basque as their hero never existed and never could exist. The very foundations of his personality are utterly opposed to the racial character. Where is the Basque who would " pick up " with a foreign female visitor at Biarritz ? I share Mr. Gallop's feelings, voiced on pp. 48-50 and vii. His impression of " a deep religious feeling " was my impression, and is no longer. With his further remarks on the following the externals of worship I agree. Their</page><page sequence="4">Reviews. 205 Church is the village theatre; the offices are entertainments they would not miss for anything in the world. There they meet and gossip, and attendance is the best excuse possible for leaving field work. This assiduity has very little effect on after conduct. The contrebandier comes home from a Saturday night's outing, during which he has defrauded his country and carried a revolver fully intended for use,-and goes to mass. The inn will disgorge its last stalwarts at 2 a.m., who reel home singing. Nevertheless at Io a.m. they will be in their places in the men's gallery. The lover will leave his beloved's room by the window, having duly kept his neska eguna (" the girl's day "), and both he and she will be at mass on Sunday morning. The remarks on moral conduct are entirely true (p. 57). The liberty accorded unmar- ried girls is such an accepted thing that after long years of observation I believe it to be quite possibly a faint remains of a fertility cult, or at least the remains of a moral outlook which has arisen from racial tradition of a fertility cult. We have just learnt from Mr. Seabrook's Jungle Ways that the girls of an African tribe, who are phallic worshippers, are not eligible for marriage until they have borne a child. The Basque author of that book concerning the Cagots, El Barrio Maldito, declares without hesitation that a man must have proof of the mother- hood of his future wife. " La ternera," he says, " hacera buena vaca." And I have never yet seen the child, even the children, refused admittance into the married home of a man who is not their father. We find a considerable proportion of words from the surround- ing Romance languages embedded in the Basque tongue,- antique forms which have long disappeared from those languages as spoken to-day. Just so do we find age-old ways of thought preserved in Basque customs, although the people who lent them have long since lost them. This precious museum is now in some measure open to all in the fifteen chapters of A Book of the Basques. The bibliography points the way to further reading. The index might have been fuller. The drawings and photo- graphs enliven the text. VIOLET ALFORD.</page></plain_text>
