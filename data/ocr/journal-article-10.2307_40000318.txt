<plain_text><page sequence="1">The Winged Reshep* Alan R. Schulman A Almost twenty years ago Cassirer published a scarab in his collection, of unknown provenance, whose underside pictured a winged Asiatic god whom he saw as the Canaanite deity Reshep,1 giving for it two virtually identical iconographic parallels, a scarab from Beth Pelet in the northern Negev2 and a small plaque, purchased at Zagazig in the Delta and formerly in the MacGregor col- lection.3 While the deity was not explicitly named in any of the three representations, earlier scholarship did not hesitate in identifying him as Set, but Cassirer's image of a winged Reshep still crops up.4 Consequently, it may be useful to examine the god of the Cassirer scarab and its parallels a little more closely. The most detailed representation of this alate god is that of the MacGregor plaque: the god wears a tall, conical crown with a long, tasseled streamer dangling down from its apex, and with the gazelle's head adorning its brow. He wears a broad collar around his neck; two bands cross his chest,5 and his short pleated, wrap-around kilt has a tiny flap hanging down in front. On the Cassirer scarab, the god is nude except for the conical crown, with the pendant streamer in back and the gazelle's head in front. On the Beth Pelet scarab, however, the gazelle's head is replaced by a pair of horns and, though its details are not given, it is clear that the deity wears a kilt with a fringed hem. In all three representations, the god has a short, curved, and quite un-Egyptian beard, and has wings attached to his outstretched arms. His two feet pin down a huge serpent whose head he holds up with his left hand while, with his right hand, he grasps a spear just below its butt and stabs the reptile in its middle. Reshep, of course, was not the only Asiatic god to appear in Egyptian art from the New King- dom on. A small stela, of unknown provenance, now in the Cairo Museum, pictures "the engra- ver, Wose-seti" worshipping a god named "Keserty".6 Keserty sits on a high-backed throne and wears the same tall, conical crown as the winged god, with a strip of cloth wrapped around its middle and knotted at the back, the two ends hanging down as streamers. The gazelle's head adorns the brow of the crown. The god has a curved, pointed beard and wears an ankle-length kilt with a lion's tail affixed to his belt. In his left hand he holds a spear and a pear-shaped mace, and in his right hand a square-bladed battle-axe. He does not brandish his weapons and he has no shield. On a stela from Beth Shan, now in the Rocke- feller Museum in Jerusalem, "the builder, Amun- emope" worships "Mikal, the god of Beth Shan".7 like Keserty, Mikal is pictured sitting on a high-backed throne. And he wears a conical crown with a strip of cloth wrapped around its middle, this being knotted at the back, although the knot is not shown, and only one end of the cloth dangles down as a streamer. In addition, however, a long streamer, ending in a tassel, hangs down from the tip of the crown. The orna- ment affixed to the crown's brow is simply a pair of horns. Mikal wears a knee-length kilt and a curious double-stranded collar around his neck. He has no weapons, but holds a WfS-staff in one 69</page><page sequence="2">70 JARCE XVI (1979) hand and clutches an 'nh by its curved loop with the other. A badly-damaged stela from Ugarit, now in the Musee du Louvre, pictures "the royal scribe and steward of the treasury, Mami" adoring "Ba'al- §aphon".8 Most of the figure of the god is lost, although his shoulders and head are intact. He is standing, rather than seated, and while it is impossible to tell if he had anything in his right hand, he held a wts-staff in his left. The crown which Bacai-§aphon wears is the same tall, coni- cal crown, though lacking its narrow neck and bulbous tip. A long streamer dangles down from its apex and no adornment is apparent on its brow. Traces of either straps or the bands of a broad collar are faintly visible at the god's right and left clavicles. If they do represent straps rather than the strands of a collar, then the god was wearing either a banded corselet, held in place by straps at each shoulder, or a pair of cros- sed chest bands. However, whatever it was is, together with his kilt, now lost. The purely Egyptian Set was depicted in Asia- tic guise, undoubtedly as a result of his equation with his AsiatiQ,counterparts, Ba'al, Teshub, and Hadad, by the Hyksos rulers of Egypt during the latter part of Second Intermediate Period,9 and is so shown on at least three New Kingdom monu- ments: the stela of the Year 400, a Ramesside stela from Serabit el-Khadim in Sinai, and a stela from Thebes, now in the Berlin Museum.10 Set wears the tall, conical crown with horns in front and a single, long, tasseled streamer hanging down in the back, from the tip of the crown. While the horns of Mikal's crown curve towards each other, those of Set's crown both curve in the same direction, upwards. On the 400 Year Stela, Set's beard is the archaic false beard traditionally worn by the Egyptian pharaoh, but, on the Sera- bit el-Khadim and Berlin stelae, it is the curved beard of an Asiatic. The collar around the god's neck on the latter two monuments is sketchily indicated, but on the Tanite stela this is shown in detail to have been a triple-stranded broad collar. Other than a summary rendering of his kilt, no details of the god's dress are visible on the Sinai representation. On the Berlin stela tassels and a broad hem to his kilt can be seen. On the Stela of the Year 400 the details of Set's dress are clear: he has bracelets on each wrist and armlets on each biceps. His wrap-around, striped and tas- seled Asiatic kilt, held in place at the waist by an ornate, inlaid(?) belt, is knee-length, but the artist has conflated it with the apronlike bottom out- line of an Egyptian kilt. Set also wears a pair of bands, decorated with circular studs, crossed over his chest and held in place by a third, horizontal band, also fitted with studs, which runs just below his breast. In all three representations the god is weaponless, but holds an cnh in his right hand and a wts-staff with his left. A different form of Set, also in Asiatic garb, is pictured on a fragment of a stela, provenance unknown, now in the Glyptothek Ny Carlsberg in Copenhagen.11 Here, as "Set, the Bull of Ombos", the god is depicted standing on the prow of the dawn bark as he slays the Apophis serpent.12 His physiognomy is hybrid, with a human body, the head of a bull, and outspread wings. He wears the same short, Asiatic kilt, but with even more tassels at the end of each banded fringe. Traces of a broad collar are visible beneath the lappets of his wig, as is also the faint outline of his banded corselet. His pose is identi- cal with that of the deity pictured on the Cassirer scarab, legs set wide apart, wings outspread, arms stabbing with a spear. Of all of the Asiatic deities who were worship- ped in Egypt, however, it is Reshep who has been repeatedly studied, but, while the iconographic dossier on him is not inconsiderable, not every representation which has been attributed to the god can be accepted, with full confidence, as actually picturing him, rather than one of the other deities in Asiatic garb or guise.13 There are twenty-two instances where a god of the Syrian type is, without question, Reshep, since he is un- equivocally identified by name in an accompa- nying caption.14 And while there is a number of similar representations, either with the caption lost, or damaged, or which had never been in- scribed, and all of which have been assumed, on iconographic grounds, to depict Reshep, these have not been taken into consideration in my for-</page><page sequence="3">THE WINGED RESHEP 71 mulation of the ways in which the god is por- trayed in New Kingdom art. With the exception of a late, Ptolemaic example (Appendix, no. 22), Reshep is portrayed in one of two ways, either by himself, or else as a member of a triad, usually, but not always, con- sisting of Qudshu-cAnath-cAstarte and Min.15 When he is shown by himself, whether sitting or standing, he is usually depicted brandishing a weapon over his head with one hand, while hold- ing a shield defensively with the other. When- ever he forms part of a triad, the arm which pre- viously wielded the weapon over his head now hangs down at his side, frequently, but not always, holding the weapon in reserve. In all of these instances, whether alone or as a member of a triad, Reshep is normally dressed and accou- tered in the following manner: on his head he wears the tall, conical crown which superficially resembles the White Crown of Upper Egypt and around which may be wrapped a strip of cloth, turban-fashion, knotted at the back of the crown, its ends dangling down like streamers. On occa- sion this is replaced by a single, long streamer, tasseled at the end, which hangs down from the tip of the god's crown to his waist. Often an orna- ment, either the gazelle's head or a pair of horns, is affixed to the crown's brow. Reshep may wear a broad collar around his neck and armlets on his wrists and/or his biceps. His wrap-around kilt is of a non-Egyptian pattern, usually knee-length and frequently with horizontal stripes or bands with fringes and tassels at the hem.16 When the god wears armor, it is the foreign banded corselet favored by the Sherden, or occasionally simply a pair of crossed chest bands.17 His offensive wea- ponry, consisting of mace-axe, battle-axe, or mace, spear, and sometimes an arrow-filled quiver, though never a bow, is of an Egyptian pattern, as is his shield, which is of the normal type in use during the New Kingdom.18 B With the exception of the Copenhagen stela of "Set, the Bull of Ombos", the iconography of the various Asiatic deities discussed is, in one way or another, very reminiscent of that of Reshep, par- ticularly in the details of dress and accoutrement, and even "Set, the Bull of Ombos" wears Asia- tic garb. Indeed, in his publication of the Cairo stela of Keserty, Leibovitch noted that, if it were not for the explicit naming of the god as Keserty, one might very well assume that it was Reshep who was depicted, since the deity had all of the attributes of Reshep, including the gazel- le's head on his brow.19 Similarly, some scholars do not admit the independent existence of Mikal, preferring to see "the god of Beth Shan" as Reshep-Mikal, an earlier form of Apollo-Amy- klaios, since later on Cyprus a number of inscrip- tions mention Reshep-Mikal and one bilingual text equates him with Apollo-Amyklaios.20 That Reshep was syncretized with other gods in the New Kingdom is clear from the Aberdeen stela of Reshep-Shulman,21 but, as Albright long ago correctly noted in a study of Shulman, such an equation indicates that the two deities thus syn- cretized resembled one another closely, but, never- theless, were not identical with each other.22 Indeed, all of these Asiatic divinities do, superfi- cially, resemble one another in visage, dress, and/ or accoutrements so closely that we must ask what it is, then, which makes them distinct from one another when they are not identified specifi- cally by a label, and just what are their distinc- tive, iconographic attributes? That it was not dress alone is obvious simply from a comparison of the various portrayals of Reshep. He normally wears the tall crown, but twice wears, instead, a tripartite wig, held in place by a fillet to which the gazelle's head ornament is affixed (Appendix nos. 18, 19). Moreover, when the crown is worn, it does not always have the strip of cloth wrapped around it, with the ends hanging down as stream- ers (Appendix, nos. 4, 5, 10, 12, 21, 22; cf. nos. 24, 26, 29, 31). In one instance the cloth is wrapped just below the tip of the crown (no. 11), and in another it is replaced by a tassel dangling down from the crown's tip (no. 9). While the brow ornament is usually assumed to be the gazelle's head (nos. 1, 3, 7, 9, 11, 12, 16-20, 22),23 this may be replaced by a uraeus (nos. 5, 10), or else there may be no ornament at all (nos. 4, 6,</page><page sequence="4">72 JARCE XVI (1979) 13; cf. nos. 24, 26, 29, 30). Reshep's kilt takes sev- eral forms: often it is decorated with fringes and tassels (nos. 8, 11, 13, 15; cf. nos. 25, 30, 34). Fre- quently it shows the folded-over flap, either pleated (nos. 19, 20) or plain (nos. 1, 3, 7, 12, 13, 15-18; cf. nos. 23, 27-30, 36). Once there is no fold-over flap, just a pleated front (no. 8), and often no decoration at all is found (nos. 4, 6, 9, 10, 18, 22; cf. nos. 26, 31).24 While the kilt is nor- mally knee-length, it can also be ankle- or calf- length (nos. 4, 14; cf. no. 36). Occasionally a lion's tail has been fitted to the rear of the god's belt (nos. 1, 7, 10; cf. no. 33). Often he wears a broad collar (nos. 1, 6, 7, 9-14, 17, 19, 20, 22; cf. nos. 23, 24, 26, 27, 34), once in combination with a pectoral (no. 12). Several times the collar is simply indicated by a curve (representing the upper strand?) (nos. 3, 5, 8, 15, 16). Reshep's upper body is usually bare, but sometimes he wears either a corselet (nos. 9, 17, 19, 29(?), 34, 36), or chest-bands (nos. 11, 22, cf. no. 23). His armament likewise varies: in many cases the weapons held simultaneously in reserve and pro- tectively in one hand are a spear and a shield (nos. 2, 5, *6, 8, 11-15; cf. nos. 25-28, 31-33), but the hand which holds these may equally hold the shield without the spear (nos. 1, 3, 4, 7, 9, 10; cf. nos. 24, 29, 30, 35), or the spear without the shield (nos. 17-20, 34, 37). In one case (no. 16), instead of either shield or spear, the god holds a wts-staff. The weapon which he either swings over his head or holds in reserve at his side is usually a maceaxe,25 but can also be a fenestrated battleaxe (no. 11), a pear-shaped mace (nos. 3, 5, 10) or even a knife (no. 22). Several times, ins- tead of a weapon it is an lnh (nos. 16-18, 36). Now and then the god has an arrow-filled quiver slung from his back (nos. 8, 12, cf. nos. 23, 25(?), 27(?), 32, 35), though in each case its retaining strap is usually not shown and in each case its decoration is different. Reshep's shield is shown either from the front (nos. 1-3, 5, 7, 8, 1 1, 12, 14, 15; cf. nos. 24, 25, 27, 28, 31-33) or from the side (nos. 4, 6, 9, 10, 13; cf. nos. 26, 29, 30). When seen from the front, its decoration may vary to show a central boss(?) (no. 1, 5, cf. no. 27) or a reinforcing band along its edges and top (nos. 1 1, 27). When seen from the side, the shield's upper portion is usually recurved towards the god, but in one instance there is no curve at all (no. 4; but cf. nos. 26, 29, 30), and once the curve is in the opposite direction, away from the god (no. 13).26 Once the god stands on a simple pedestal (no. 13) and once on a shrine-shaped pedestal (no. 18; but cf. also no. 38). Of the three "em- blems" found with him, the cwA, personified with arms and holding a hw-fan,27 the lotus-shaped fan whose shaft terminates in the archaic cartouche,28 and the lutelike object from the tip of whose handle a pair of tassels hangs down (nos. 6, 10, 11; cf. nos. 23, 34), the first two are found with other deities, not only with Reshep, and hence probably have no special meaning for him. On the other hand, since the lutelike object is found only with Reshep, it should have a significance for him but, insofar as its exact nature is still in dispute, it is not possible to do more than specu- late on what it might have been. When it does occur, it occupies one of three positions: like the lnh and the lotus-fan, it is simply placed behind the god, squat base down, tasseled hand upwards (nos. 6, 34). Otherwise, since it is thrust through Reshep's belt (no. 10) or looped over his arm just above the elbow (nos. 11, 23), it is clear that it was not just an emblem, but a part of his equip- ment. Leibovitch has made out an excellent case for its having been a mace,29 though it is true that in one instance the weapon which he bran- dishes over his head is also a mace (no. 10). In any event, it is doubtful that the lute-like object was a characteristic "heraldic" emblem of Reshep, for otherwise we should expect it to be included with most, if not all, of the representa- tions of him, and it does not so occur. Despite the numerous variations of dress, weaponry, and adornment which the individual depictions of Reshep show, they all share one fea- ture in common: the attitude of the god. When Reshep alone is shown, whether seated or stand- ing, he is invariably shown wielding a weapon over his head with one hand.30 Whenever he forms part of a triad, the hand which previously brandished the weapon now hangs down peace- fully at his side.31 Since all of these indisputable</page><page sequence="5">THE WINGED RESHEP 73 portraits of Reshep share other iconographic attributes, such as the conical crown, the gazelle's head, the tasseled kilt, the banded corselet, or the crossed chest bands, with Mikal, Keserty, Bacal- §aphon, and Set, but do not share the warlike pose, this suggests that it is this very warlike attitude which was the characteristic attribute of Reshep. None of the other male Asiatic deities appear in it and, of the females, only Reshep's counterpart, 'Anath, is so pictured. When Reshep forms part of a triad, he stands in the same atti- tude as Bacal-$aphon and Set, but he is always armed and they are not. That he appears in this secondary pose would, at first, seem to contradict the suggestion just made that his identifying attribute is his warlike pose, but before attempt- ing to resolve such a contradiction, it is first necessary to look briefly at a statuette in the Metropolitan Museum of Art which has been identified as portraying Rpshep.32 If the statuette originally had been inscribed with the god's name, this must have been on the portion of its base which is now lost. Never- theless, the god is undoubtedly Reshep in his characteristic pose. He holds a small shield protectively with his left hand and brandishes a shafted hand-weapon over his head with his right hand. The head of the hand- weapon is mis- sing. The god wears the conical crown to which the gazelle's head ornament has been affixed and stands on a base. The body of the statuette is sculpted three-quarters in the round, with both of its legs, its back, and its head attached to a dorsal pillar which, in turn, is attached to a back pilaster that supports Reshep's upraised right arm and weapon. In his study of the statuette, Simpson suggested that it was, apparently, copied from one of the representations on the ste- lae which show the god in this pose.33 Probably just the opposite is true, namely that the repre- sentations on the stelae actually picture statues of the god. This was certainly the case with the two portrayals of Reshep which show him standing on either a simple base or a shrine-shaped pedes- tal. There it is clear that what is depicted was a statue of the god, not the god himself. That no back pillar is shown is unimportant, if we com- pare the stelae from Qantir published by Habachi or Clere which show various members of the military colony worshipping statues of Ramesses II.34 On some the statues have both the back pillar and pedestal,35 on others the back pillar is present but not the pedestal,36 and on a few neither pedestal nor back pillar is illustrated37 Nor are the statues of Ramesses II from Qantir the only clearly recognizable statues to be shown on stelae. In this context we might also note the numerous representations of the Great Sphinx at Giza (and, in one case, the Giza pyramids as well) on various stelae found by Selim Hassan in the vicinity of the Sphinx.38 If the figures of Reshep in the warlike pose actually portray statues of the god, then it follows that those showing Reshep as a member of a triad likewise depict statues, in this case triads. This, in turn, suggests why the figure of Reshep in a triad is not shown in his characteristic pose: just as the sculptor who fashioned the Metro- politan Museum of Art statuette found it beyond his technical competence to execute the warlike stance without having to support the upraised arm on the back pillar,39 so, for similar reasons, not the least of which was also the need to retain a harmonious balance of the elements of the group, the sculptors who fashioned the various triads of which Reshep was a member, but not the central figure, simplified their task by altering his stance to that of a conventional male standing statue. In order to retain the attributes of the god, they included his weaponry so that he holds a spear in his right hand as if it were a WfS-staS and, with his left hand, he clutches a hand- weapon in reserve, as if it were a Ar^-scepter. C We may now return to the winged deity of the Cassirer and Beth Pelet scarabs and the MacGregor plaque. It is obvious that his attitude, though warlike, is not the bellicose pose of Reshep. If my suggestion that it is the pose which is the determining iconographic characteristic of the god is correct, then it is clear that this atti- tude, one not found with Reshep, should indicate</page><page sequence="6">74 JARCE XVI (1979) some other deity. It might, however, be argued that the winged god represents still another sta- tue of Reshep, for just as the Cypriote inscrip- tions which mention rsp frl hs "Reshep, lord of the arrow" have been plausibly and probably cor- rectly linked with those Egyptian depictions of the god where an arrow-filled quiver is included among his weaponry,40 it is possible, perhaps, to equate the winged deity, if he actually were Reshep, with the rsp sprm "Reshep of the birds" who is mentioned in the bilingual Phoenician- hieroglyphic Hittite inscription from Karatepe.41 But several points may be raised against this line of argument, not the least of which is the ambi- guity of the meaning of sprm which has also been interpreted as "he-goats" or as an Anatolian place name, §ippiru.42 Further, the pose of the winged deity is, on the one hand, shared by "Set, the Bull of Ombos" in Asiatic garb and, on the other, the same anthropomorphic Asiatic god, though without the wings and in a different pose is clearly Set in Asiatic guise. In his manifestation as the "Bull of Ombos" on the Copenhagen stela fragment, Set is standing in the bow of the dawn bark, the prow of which is visible as the bound, upright column of reeds upon whose top a small falcon stands. From this vantage point, he is spearing the Apophis serpent. On the two scarabs and the MacGregor plaque, the god is likewise spearing a serpent. That this is also the Apophis serpent which is being slain by Set standing in the bow of the dawn bark, even though the bark itself is not shown, should not be questioned. Even as the artisan who engraves a coin resorts to abbreviated conventions and symbols because of the restricted space with which he has to work, the engraver of a scarab or a small plaque also would have used conventional symbols and abbreviations. If, then, the winged Asiatic god who spears the Apophis serpent is, indeed, Set and not Reshep, a conclusion already reached by Leibovitch years ago,43 but ignored or rejected by Cassirer, we may then assume that the winged Asiatic deity who stands on the back of a lion on some scar- abs,44 or, flanked by a pair of uraei, stands with his wings outspread is likewise Set, but in yet another manifestation.45 Since the purely anthro- pomorphic Asiatic god who appears on some scarabs either with another figure,46 or alone, likewise has the pose of the anthropomorphic Asiatic Set of the 400 Year stela, the Serabit el- Khadim stela, and the Berlin stela, he also is, undoubtedly, Set.47 When Reshep is portrayed on scarabs, he appears in his usual warlike pose (Appendix, nos. 41, 42) .48 The deity who appears on a cylinder-seal from Beth Shan, offering a hps- sword to a king Ramesses (who, himself, is shooting arrows through a target), is not identi- fied by name.49 From his garb and appearance he could conceivably be any of the Asiatic gods, but his pose is characteristic of none of them.50 However, inasmuch as the one Asiatic deity who is attested at Beth Shan specifically as "the god of Beth Shan" was Mikal, it is, perhaps, safest to identify the god of the cylinder-seal as Mikal, possibly a different form of him than that por- trayed on the stela of Amunemope, or, possibly, since he offers the sword to the king, the god himself rather than a statue of him as is, undoubtedly, depicted on the stela. In any event, like Reshep on horseback, the winged Reshep does not seem to have existed. At least there is no iconographic evidence for such a manifesta- tion of him.

Queens College, CUNY Notes: This is the second of five projected articles dealing with various aspects, mostly iconographic, of the Canaanite god Reshep. The first of these, "Reshep on Horseback?" appeared in The Newsletter of the Society for the Study of Egyptian Antiqui- ties (Toronto) 7, no. 4 (August, 1977), 13-17. The substance of the present paper was read before the 30th Annual Meet- ing of the American Research Center in Egypt, held at the Grey Art Center of New York University, on April 15th, 1978. I should like to acknowledge here, with my sincerest gratitude, the kindness of three colleagues, Dr.Cathleen Keller, the Egyptian Department, the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York, Dr.Jaromir Malek, the Topographical Bib- liography, the Griffith Institute, the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, and Dr.Janine Bourriau, the Fitzwilliam Museum, Cambridge, for suppyling me with data relative to certain of the documents cited below. 1 M.Cassirer, "A Scarab with an Early Representation of Resheph,"J&amp;4 45 (1959), 6-7 and pl.

Matthiae, "Note sul dio siriano Resef," Oriens Anti- quus 2 (1963), 31, nn. 20-24, who, like Scandone, be. cit. and Giveon, be. cit., has no hesitation in accepting the winged god as Reshep. F.S. Matouk, Corpus du scarabee egyptien II (1977), 76 and 337, nos. 264-68, after some demurral identi- fies the alate god as Reshep, though he does not completely rule out the possibility that Set may have been portrayed. (Whether one of the deities on his scarab no. 173 is also Reshep is questionable. The best that can be said concerning it is that the triad pictured there consists of the ithyphallic Min, a goddess, and a horned (?) hawk-headed god.). Leibo- vitch, IFJ 3, be. cit. sees the god as Set, but implies that, via his Asiatic guise, he may be equated with all or any of the similar-looking Asiatic deities. W.S. Fulco, The Canaanite God Resep (1976), 7 Doc. E 14, after some deliberation, ulti- mately correctly rejects the notion that the winged god was Reshep, but has no suggestion as to who he might have been. 5 See now M.H. Pope, "The Saltier of Atargatis Recon- sidered" in J.H. Sanders, ed. Near Eastern Archaeobgy in the Twentieth Century: Essays in Honor of Nelson Glueck (1970), 1 78-96, who has shown quite convincingly that these chest- bands were primarily baldrics which supported weapons. 6 Stela Cairo JE 87230, published by Leibovitch, "Un nouveau dieu Egypte-Canaaneen," ASAE 48 (1948), 435-44, pls.

Unlike Stadelmann, op. tit, 41-3, and Helck, op. tit., 448-49, I believe that these are representations of Set, not Bacal. As the Ugarit stela dedi- cated to Ba'al-Saphon (above, n. 8) shows, the Egyptians were quite aware that Ba'al and Set, though similar in appearance, were, nevertheless, two different deities and, if the depiction of an Asiatic god was meant to show Ba'al, Set- Bacal, or any other form of Ba'al, the artisan who was respon- sible for the representation certainly would have used the appropriate name in the accompanying caption and not just labeled the god "Set". 11 Aein 726, published by O.

VI. 12 For Set in the dawn bark, see G.Nagel, "Set dans la barque solaire," BIFAO 28 (1928), 33-9. 13 The most recent study is that of Fulco, op. tit., which differs from his The God Resep (Dissertation: Yale, 1970) in several details, the most important of which is the publica- tion of the two stelae found during the 1915-1923 excava- tions of the University Museum of the University of Pennsyl- vania at Memphis. While the citation stela Philadelphia El 3620 (Doc. E30) is correct, the citation stela Cairo 2797 (Doc. E 18) is misleading. This is the find number of the stela as recorded in the Memphis field register, not a Cairo Museum number, and should be cited as "Memphis M-2797 (Cairo)". It is sad to note here that Fulco's study is sloppy and superficial. In all he has omitted or overlooked ten major documents on which Reshep is depicted (Appendix nos. 8, 13, 24, 28, 29, 33, 36-39), all of which were pub- lished before 1976, the date of his revised work, most of which appeared before 1971, the date of his dissertation. Equally inexcusable is his condescension to his readership as exemplified by, e.g., 13-14, n. 60. 14 See Appendix, nos. 1-22. 1 have not given an extensive bibliography for each of the documents which either unequi- vocally or on iconographic grounds picture Reshep. I have preferred to cite each item by its museum number, when applicable, together with a good illustration, usually a photo- graphic plate rather than a line-drawing of the document in question. Since every representation of Reshep listed in the Appendix is published with an illustration, and the publica- tions are easily available, it seems pointless to illustrate them once again. Nor has an elaborate description of any of them been given except in those case where an unusual feature has to be mentioned. 15 On the triads, see Ch. Boreux, "La stele C86 du Musee du Louvre et les steles similaires," Melanges Syriens offerts a Monsieur Rene Dussaud II (1939), 673-87. For other triads in which Reshep figures as one of the divinities, see stela Cairo JE 86123 (= Appendix no. 16), the other two gods being Amun-re* and Hauron", or stela Asswan Museum no. 16 (= Appendix, no. 15) where the other members are Amun and Set. 16 For this non-Egyptian kilt, see Montet, op. tit, 206-10. 17 For the banded corselet, see H. Bonnet, Die Waff en der Volker des Alten Orients (1926), 209-12. 18 On the shield, see W.

Simson, "New Light on the God Reshef," JAOS 73 (1953), 88-9 and, more recently, Thompson, op. tit, 152-57, and Fulco, op. tit 29; but see also n. 23 below. 20 See Fulco, op. tit, 51-4 and the literature cited there, particularly 53, n. 286 where he prefers to see mikal as an epithet for a local god, possibly Set. Stadelmann, op. tit, 54- 5, wishes to see mikal as a Canaanite participle form used as an epithet in a fashion similar to the Egyptian epithets nb phty, V phty "lord of strength", "great of strength", but appar- ently overlooking the fact that it is written on the Beth Shan stela with the determinative $ showing that it is a divine name and not an epithet. That we may assume that the artisan who carved the stela knew what he doing, see n. 10 above and also n. 22 below. 21 Stela Aberdeen Anthropological Museum no. 1578 (= Appendix no. 7). Stadelmann's statement, op. tit, 55, n. 1, that the piece is from a private collection is slightly mislead- ing. While originally from the Grant-Bey collection, it was purchased at Memphis and acquired by the University of Aberdeen, see B. W. Reid, Illustrated Catalogue of the Anthropo- logical Museum, Marischal College, University of Aberdeen (1912), 197, no. 1578. 22 See W.F.

L'Evolution de son culte dans Pancienne Egypte," BIE 13 [1931], pl. II, fig. 7) or with no ornament at all, ibid., figs. 3, 5, 6. The fact that both Reshep and Shed each can wear the uraeus or the gazelle's head indiscriminately sug- gests that each of the two ornaments, while possessing an inherent apotropaic significance, was interchangeable with the other and, consequently, while they were clearly symbols of divinity, were neither attributable to nor characteristic of any specific deity.</page><page sequence="14">82 JARCE XVI (1979) 24 See above n. 16 and the literature cited there. 25 For the maceaxe see Bonnet, op. cit, 41-2. 26 On stela Cairo JE 71815 (Appendix no. 29) a god, though not specifically named, but unquestionably Reshep on iconographic grounds (see below), defends himself with what, at first sight, seems to be a strange type of shield, superfically resembling a bowcase. In fact, that is how Leibo- vitch, "Quelques nouvelles representations du dieu Rechef," ASAE 39 (1939), 155-56, interpreted it, though it is clear, in view of the less elaborate, but identically-shaped parallel car- ried by the god on stela Cairo JE 71816 (Appendix no. 30), that the artisans who carved the two stelae were attempting to show realistically the concave curve of the shield from the side. Leibovitch's identification of the four concentric arcs which curve upward and outward from slightly above the shield's middle as four arrows is impossible. More probably they represent the reinforcements running around the shield's rim (more elaborately depicted on the shield of ostra- con Cairo CG 25063 [Appendix no. 27]), while the three vertical bands which run across the lower half of the shield are nothing more than additional reinforcements. 2 See Appendix nos. 1-3 and Fulco, The God Resep (1971), 71. 28 See Appendix nos. 5, 7, 9, 14, and Fulco, op. cit, 71-2. 29 Leibovitch's arguments, ASAE 40 (1941), 489-90 and pl. XLV, that it was a mace are rejected by Fulco, op. cit., 69- 71 (who gives an incorrect citation for them). Fulco, however, makes no better suggestion concerning the object's nature or function. Nor does he return to the subject in the 1976 revi- sion of his work. 30 See Appendix nos. 1-14, 23-25. Two apparent excep- tions are nos. 22, the relief from the Khargeh Oasis where Reshep is one of a procession of gods, and no. 34, stela Phila- delphia E 13620, where he holds a hand- weapon in reserve. For these, however, see the last paragraphs of Section B above and also the next note. dl See Appendix nos. 15-22 and 37-40. The composition of the various triads is discussed in n. 15 above. Inasmuch as no. 22, the relief from the Khargeh Oasis pictures a proces- sion of gods, it is understandable that it would have been inappropriate to portray the god walking in the procession while brandishing his weapons. Moreover, as the pose of no. 34 is identical to that of the god on no. 15, stela Assuan no. 1 6, where Reshep clearly is a member of a triad, it is not pressing the question to suggest that a triad may have been implied by the god's attitude. Conversely, although three gods are depicted on no. 35, stela Strassbourg 1398, the fact that Reshep is in his warlike pose, could imply that the three divinities actually represented three individual statues of the gods in question. 61 Nr. 89.2.215, published by Simpson, "An Egyptian Sta- tuette of a Phoenician God," BMMA N.

It may be noted here that, while Reshep is several times depicted equipped with a quiver, he is never shown armed with a bow. In view of this, it is tempting to suppose that the shafted missies which were carried in the quiver may not have been arrows. After all, arrows must be used with a bow. However, in addition to the arrow, there is another shafted missle weapon which can be carried in a quiver and which is thrown by hand, rather than shot from a bow, namely the dart, but whether Hebrew and Aramaic hs or Ugaritic fe, all of which can mean "arrow" can also mean "dart" is a question which must be decided by a Semitist. 41 Ibid, 44, nn. 234-37, and the literature cited there. 42 Ibid, n. 238 and the literature cited there. 43 First in ASAE 44 (1945), 101-07 and then in IEJ 3 (1953), 103-05, particularly 104, fig. 10 and 105, figs. 11-18. 44 E.g.

Indeed, Leibovitch, he. cit, unhesitatingly identified all of these representations, as well as those cited in the preceding note, as Set. E.g. scarab a. MacDonald, J.E. Starkey, and L. Hard- ing, Beth-Pelet II (1932), pl. LXXIII, no. 20. 47 Matouk, op. cit, 338, nos. 280-93 does not include this type among the various manifestations of Set and Sutekh, but see Leibovitch, he. cit, fig. 9 (scarab Palestine Archaeo- logical Museum no. I 4315). 48 See Appendix nos. 41, 42. 1 am not convinced that Ful- co's Doc. E 15 (op. cit, 7, nn. 36-7), scarab Palestine</page><page sequence="15">THE WINGED RESHEP 83 Archaeological Museum no. 32.2672, actually represents Reshep. While it is true that the figure wears the high conical crown and is in the characteristic warlike pose of the god, when one compares this scarab with its numerous parallels, e.g. scarab O. Tufnell, Lachish IV (1958), pl. 39, no. 30; scarab R. MacAlister, The Excavation of Gezer III (1912), pLCCVI, no. 4; scarab Petrie, Gaza V (1952), pl. IX, nos. 12, 13; plaque, R. 744, S. Sallier, Thejebusite Burial Place (1964), 187, no. 1, it is clear that the figure, in spite of Fulco's description, be. cit, is weaponless. In spite of the conical crown, the figure could be a king, rather than an Asiatic god, although Sallier, 192, notices the similarity to Reshep, but for the purpose for which it appeared on the scarab, it was immaterial. The other hieroglyphs on the scarab and its parallels, the uraeus, the njr, the cwA, the nb, the plant, all indicate that the hieroglyphs on the base of Jerusalem 32.2672 comprise a cryptogram, one of the trigrams of Amun in the formula Umn nb(-l)"Amwi is (my) lord", see E. Drio- ton, "Trigrammes d'Amon," WZKM 54 (1957), 11-33. However, if, on the other hand, Fulco is correct and Reshep is pictured on this scarab, then he should be pictured on its parallels and, since the majority of these date to the late Second Intermediate Period, this would push back the appearance of Reshep in Egypt to the time of the Hyksos. But this clearly does not square with any of the other data relating to the introduction of the worship of Reshep in Egypt. 49 Now in the Palestine Archaeological Museum no. J. 911, see Rowe, op. cit, 252-53 and pl. XXVIII, no. S 61. Rowe first identifies this god as Set and then later equates him with Mikal. 50 It is for this reason that I have not included the relief from the north wall of the temple of Montu at Karnak (= Fulco, Doc. E 51). While the god pictured there wears the conical crown and carries both a staff and a mace, he does not resemble Reshep any more than he resembles Set, Ba'al, Mikal, or Keserty. He could, in fact, be any of them. The accompanying text, "Recitation by Min, the one who slaugh- ters his enemies, the Reshep who resides in the House of Montu, the son of the Heliopolitan Isis who resides in the House of Montu which is the Horizon of the pillars . . . . " does not really identify the god. The best that one may say about Reshep from this document is either that a manifesta- tion of him, "Reshep who resides in the House of Montu" was syncretized with Min, possibly an outgrowth of his association with Min in the triad of Reshep, Qudshu, and Min at Deir el Medineh, or possibly that Reshep here did not mean the god, per se, but rather was used as it had been occa- sionally in the Ramesside Period, at Medinet Habu, as an adjective with the sense of "the war god" in parallelism to "the son of the Heliopolitan Isis". But, in any event, it is Min who is depicted on the relief, not Reshep. Likewise I cannot accept as Reshep the deity brandishing a hps and holding a spear who is represented on cylinder seal Palestine Archaeo- logical Museum no. 35.4442 (= Fulco, Doc. E. 20). The crown which this figure wears looks more like the Blue Crown, in which case the figure is of a king. Likewise I cannot accept as Reshep either the deity bran- dishing a hps and holding a spear who is represented on cylinder seal Palestine Archaeological Museum nr. 35.4442 (= Fulco, Doc. E 20) or the god standing holding a w/s-staff who appears on a cylinder seal in the Dayan Collecton (see Giveon, op. cit. in n. 2 for the reference 179 fig. 1). In the first of these two examples the crown which the figure wears looks more like the Blue Crown, in which case it is a king who is being represented. In the second case, not only is the pose more that of Ba'al and Set, but from Giveon's drawing what is described as a gazelle's head could just as well be a uraeus. Finally, I totally reject Giveon's attempt, be. cit. 180 n. 7, to resurrect the identification proposed by R. Reitler, "Kleinfunde aus Gaza: II. Der kanaanitische Gott Rescheph als Vereiniger von Ober- und Unteragyptens", ZDPV77 (1961) 88-92 and pl. 7 A, that the god pictured on a scarab said to come from Gaza is Reshep. His pose, holding an cnh with his left hand and a gazelle by its feet with his right hand is completely unparalleled for any known representation of Reshep. While he does wear a conical crown, it is impossible to say what ornament adorns it, and that fact that he is asso- ciated with a gazelle is, in itself, no indication that the god was Reshep since, as we have seen above, the gazelle is not unique to Reshep and Reshep wears other brow adornments in addition to the gazelle's head. 51 According to A. Moret, "Monuments egyptiens du Musee Calvet a Avignon," Rec. trav. 35 (1913), 49, the first publication of the stela, it has the provenance "Deir el Medi- neh", presumably because of the title of its dedicator: "the servant in the Place of Truth". However, not all monuments of men who were servants in "the Place of Truth" come from Deir el Medineh, and to assign a definite provenance to a purchased piece is misleading. I prefer to follow the practice of O.W. Muscarella, "Ziwye and Ziwye: the Forgery of a Provenience," Journal of Field Archaeobgy 4, no. 2 (1977), 197-218, in questioning the alleged provenance af any docu- ment acquired by purchase and "said to be from" a particu- lar place. Usually the last statement is the dealer who is sell- ing the item's way of concealing its origin, if, indeed, he does know it. I accept as certain the provenance only of excavated monuments. Otherwise, in this Appendix of documents known to depict Reshep, or assumed on stylistic grounds to portray him, when the provenance given is "Ex-Collection NN" or "acquired by purchase", this means that the proven- ance is, in fact, unknown. 52 Fulco, op. cit., 13-14, n. 60, relates how the late Father Janssen reported {CdE 29, no. 50 [1950], 212, n. 1) that the representation of Reshep published by Wilkinson, be. cit., pl. LV, center, was taken from stela British Museum no. 263 (Appendix nr. 8 = Fulco, Doc. E 25). However, on this monument Reshep is standing, a fact which Fulco apparently did not know, since his only citation to the stela is Budge's 1909 Guide to Sculpture, 180 which neither illustrates the stela nor describes the pose of Reshep. And clearly British</page><page sequence="16">84 JARCE XVI (1979) Museum no. 263 cannot be the source for the Wilkinson drawing since there the god is shown seated. The source for it then either was Avignon no. 16 or Cambridge no. EGA 3002.1943. Since, in the Wilkinson drawing, the shaft of Reshep's weapon appears above the tip of his crown, the head of the weapon shows that it was a maceaxe, the lion's tail is visible in front of and between his feet, and the words ntr V "the great god" are written in the field between the shield and the god's head, details which are all apparent on the Avignon stela, while on the Cambridge document the shaft of the weapon is partially concealed by the god's crown, its head is that of a pear-shaped mace, not a maceaxe, there is no lion's tail, and there is no inscription before the god's face, it is clear that the Wilkinson drawing was not based on the Cambridge stela and, by process of elimination, then leaves the Avignon monument as its source. 53 Ahmose's title, 'ntiw-'-t is not attested in the Wb. There is an ^ntiw, Wb I, 207, 4, which seems to be a professional designation, though the profession is undetermined. Since the root 'ntl seems to be involved with incense, it is possible lntiw-l-t referred to some sort of official connected with an incense chamber or storehouse, perhaps with a per- sonal determinative for the entire expression omitted. 54 In spite of Lesko's translation of the text which Fulco uses, op. tit., 9, n.g, the name of the dedicator is not pre- served. What Lesko read as a name Pi -for is rather pi four "the staff of gold-miners", see Wb. V 21, 9-11, which is attested in a variety of spellings. Fulco's publication of the stela is quite superficial. Although the surface of the monu- ment is badly weathered, much more of the god's figure and weaponry can be made out. The deity's crown has been misunderstood and rendered as if it were the double crown, when actually what looks the red-crown element is the knot of the cloth strip. The document will be republished carefully and in extenso in a later article in this series. 55 Fulco obviously did not see the original stela, or he would have noted that much of what is visible on the photograph which he published is no longer pre- served on the stela. His reading of the name Reshep in the upper register is wrong. What is preserved is the feet of a w-chick, a clear r and beneath it a stroke fol- lowed by the determinative of a seated man enveloped in a cloak, i.e. -wr, a trace which then suggests a resto- ration \p? k]wr "the staff of gold-miners" for which there is easily enough room. The name of dedicator, assuming the man standing before the offering tables in the lower register, Nebneheh(?) is identical with the man censing the statue of the god in the upper. Like the stela cited in the preceding note, stela Philadelphia no. E 13620 will be dealt with in extenso in a later article. )6 The figure of Min has been reworked into that of a woman worshipper, but curiously his erect member has not been erased.</page></plain_text>
