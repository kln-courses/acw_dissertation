One view is that Gulf lowland populations called "Olmec" by archaeologists made a number of key innovations and that their influence on contemporary societies stimulated the rise of Mesoamerican civilization. Another view is that multiple regions participated equally and all made innovations that became the legacy of later Mesoamerican societies. Additional empirical work will help resolve some of the issues raised by this debate, as Cheetham and Blomster (2010) have recently suggested in this journal. Explicit theory can also help move the discussion forward. Applicable to features both designed by natural selection and gener ated by cultural design forces, costly signaling theory predicts the evolution of signaling systems that reliably communicate infor mation about some underlying quality. For instance, an individual's superior access to resources will not be obvious unless they adver tise it, so advertising is necessary for the individual to gain the pres tige benefits of superior access. To be believable, however, the advertisements must be impossible to fake unless the individual actually controls a disproportionate share of resources. Wasteful, resource-consuming advertisements (e.g., conspicuous consump tion or conspicuous generosity) are the result. For Early Formative period Mesoamerica, this simple, though perhaps counterintuitive, formulation provides expectations about empirical patterning borne out by existing observations on the material record of cultural elaboration within the Gulf Coast Olmec heartland and by changes over time in patterns of inter-regional interaction. Interest in the Olmec, arguably Mesoamerica's first civilization, has surged over the past decade, with two full-length books (Diehl 2004; Pool 2007), a recent Ancient Mesoamerica (Spring 2010, Vol. 21) special section titled "Rethinking the Olmecs and Early Formative Mesoamerica," a major synthetic analysis and catalogue of Olmec art in the collection at Dumbarton Oaks (Taube 2004), and numerous journal articles. The Olmec even play a role in modern identity politics, setting claims of an African stimulus for the Olmec in contrast with enthusiasm for archaeological evidence of home-grown artistic and technological creativity.1 The Olmec emerged during the Early Formative period, roughly 1800-1100 B.C., a time when people throughout Mesoamerica were E-mail correspondence to: hneff@csulb.edu first congregating in permanent settlements and making pottery. Some additional innovations, such as carved monumental and por table stone sculpture, and long-distance movement of fine pottery and other goods, seem to have been introduced by people of the Gulf Olmec heartland, also called Olman (Clark 1997; Coe 1989; Diehl 2004, 2005; Diehl and Coe 1996; Lowe 1989; Pool 2007). Because the heritage of these Olmec innovations can be traced in later Mesoamerican art and material culture, Mesoamericanists have referred since the 1940s to the Olmec as Mesoamerica's "mother culture" (Bernal 1969; Covarrubias 1942. 1957). A variety of archaeological evidence favors the view that some Gulf lowland individuals or factions were better able than their con temporaries elsewhere to harness energy and resources toward non subsistence ends. For one thing, the scale of construction activities at San Lorenzo exceeded by a substantial margin the scale of con struction elsewhere (Clark 1997; Coe and Diehl 1980a; Cyphers 1997; Diehl 2004; Symonds and Lunagómez 1997; Symonds et al. 2002). Second, monumental stone and wood carving were well developed on the Gulf Coast long before either appeared in other regions (Diehl 2004; Ortiz and Rodriguez 2000). Third, as documented by a recent ceramic provenance study, Gulf Coast Olmec people were exporting substantial quantities of fine white and carved-incised gray pottery at a time when other centers exported little if any pottery (Blomster et al. 2005; Neff and Glascock 2002; Neff et al. 2006a, 2006b). If Olmec innovations appeared concurrently across a single con tiguous region, there might be little debate over the importance of the Olmec as inventors of many features of Mesoamerican civiliza tions. However, "Olmec" things have variable temporal and spatial distributions, appearing at various times between 1500 and 400 B.C. over a wide area of Mesoamerica, from El Salvador and Honduras (e.g., Joyce and Henderson 2010) to the Basin of Mexico (e.g., Clark 2007; Diehl 2004; Niederberger 2000; Pool 2007). The broad temporal and spatial distribution of the "Olmec phenomenon" has given rise to a competing metaphor that describes the Olmec not as Mesoamerica's "mother culture" but as one of several "sister These competing claims were juxtaposed recently (October 22, 2010) at a conference on the Olmec held at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art, when African-American and Latino members of the audience stated their beliefs during a question and answer session. The African-origins hypothesis has been rejected by most archaeologists and art historians (e.g., Haslip-Viera et al. 1997; Ortiz de Montellano et al. 1997). 107</page><page sequence="2">108 Neff cultures" (Hammond 1988) that participated in the genesis of Mesoamerican civilization. Proponents of this alternative metaphor include Kent V. Flannery (1968), David Grove (1989), Arthur Demarest (1989), Joyce Marcus (1989), and Christine Niederberger (2000). Despite assertions to the contrary (e.g., Cheetham and Blomster 2010), the mother- and sister-culture metaphors still guide most research and frame most discussions of the Olmec. This is evident in the recent Ancient Mesoamerica special section, where Blomster (2010) highlights the asymmetry between the Oaxacan chiefdoms and the nascent Olmec state, Reyes Gonzalez and Winter (2010) describe Gulf Olmec influence on ceramics at a small site on the southern Isthmus of Tehuantepec, and Cheetham (2010a) suggests that Gulf Olmec colonized southern Chiapas based on his excavations at Canton Corralito. John Clark (2007) makes an even stronger statement of the mother-culture position, arguing that the Gulf Olmec capital of San Lorenzo became a state over 1,000 years before the runner-up, Monte Alban. On the sister side, Joyce and Henderson (2010) emphasize the local adop tion and exploitation of "Olmec" symbols by Early Formative period Hondurans. Other papers in the special section highlight the variable expression of "Olmec" within Olman itself, which leads Pool et al. (2010:102-103) to suggest that San Lorenzo may not have been particularly powerful even within the heartland, and Wendt (2010:119) to conclude that assessments of the strength of Olmec influence outside of Olman may be flawed by incomplete understanding of patterning within household assemblages. The mother- and sister-culture metaphors have been highly pro ductive in the sense that they have generated hypotheses that are tes table with the empirical data of archaeology (e.g., carved-incised vessels were exported from Olman but not vice-versa [Blomster et al. 2005]). Adequate existing theoretical frameworks are liberat ing in science, since they set scholars free to get on with the job of making observations and examining whether expectations are met. Thus, ironically, while Cheetham and Blomster (2010:93) eschew the "polarized debate" between the two sides in their intro duction to the recent special section, it is this very debate that has made it possible for the authors of the special section to "present robust data sets that permit well-grounded, testable, and diverse interpretations about the nature of the Gulf Olmecs and their impact abroad." Robust data sets are certainly desirable, and it may be, as Cheetham and Blomster suggest, that the best course for Olmec archaeology and for archaeology in general is to get on with the job of meticulously documenting empirical patterning in the record. But there is another possibility too. Perhaps more explicit theory can be developed that specifies mechanisms and conditions capable of generating precocious accumulation and assertion of pol itical power on the Gulf Coast together with broad and variable dis tribution of "Olmec" artistic elements across Early and Middle Formative Mesoamerica. The mother- and sister-culture metaphors have served us well, but it may be time to rethink the conceptual basis of our understanding of Olmec. While it is not the only approach to theory building in historical science, evolutionary theory has a track record far superior to any other. Evolutionary theory has generated powerful explanations of historical entities (organisms) in biology for well over a century, something that no other theoretical perspective can claim. This prior success provides one rationale for turning to evolutionary theory as a source of explanations for the historical entities of inter est to us as archaeologists. I argue in what follows that predictions derived from the evol utionary theory of costly signaling (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997), intro duced to archaeology by Neiman (1997) under the name "wasteful advertising," are consistent in surprising detail with observations on the Early Formative archaeological record. In brief, I argue that different kinds of Olmec cultural elaboration were designed as pres tige signals intended for different audiences. Not only are the designs of such artifacts as colossal heads, fancy ceramic exports, and carved jades compatible with the hypothesis that they are pres tige signals, but the context in which they first appear, the way they were consumed, and the temporal trajectory of their use in various locations also conform to predictions derived from costly signaling theory. Costly signaling also leads to hypotheses that can be tested in future research. One byproduct of viewing Olmec cultural elabor ation from a costly signaling perspective is an understanding of how both the "mother culture" and "sister culture" metaphors contain grains of truth. Pool (2007:17) also concludes that proponents on both sides of the debate make valid points. Nonetheless, because ecological circumstances allowed Gulf Olmec populations to invest more heavily in prestige signaling, they contributed dispro portionately to the artistic and symbolic heritage of later Mesoamerican people. COSTLY SIGNALING While evolutionary theory has produced some credible accounts of material patterns generated by subsistence activities (Cannon 2003; Winterhalder and Kennett 2006) or stylistic variation in artifacts (Eerkens and Lipo 2005; Lipo et al. 1997; Neiman 1995), the material trappings of "complex society" (temples, palaces, rich burials, long-distance circulation of goods, etc.) have been less sus ceptible to evolutionary analysis. Some theoretical foundation is therefore required before proceeding to the case of Olmec cultural elaboration.2 Elaborate structures are puzzling outcomes in both biological and cultural evolution because, in both cases, generating and/or maintaining the elaborate structures would seem to reduce fitness by reducing the resources available for subsistence and mating. One solution to this problem that is applicable in both biological and cultural evolution builds on the evolutionary theory of costly 2 To date, "sister culture" proponents have made the most overt appeals to evolution as a basis for understanding early Mesoamerican societies. For instance, Flannery and Marcus (2000:33) say "filt is the adaptive autonomy and frequent competitive interaction of such chiefdoms that speed up evol ution and eventually make useful technologies and sociopolitical strategies available to all regions." Sister-culture advocates also depict the "mother culture" perspective as anti-evolutionary, arguing that it gives no or insuffi cient attention to "the interaction of human groups, factions, and individual agents, sometimes cooperative and alliance oriented, sometimes reactive and competitive" (Flannery et al. 2005:11222). Flannery et al. (2005) even go so far as to liken the "mother vs. sister culture debate" to the debate between evolutionism and creationism, with mother-culture proponents cast as "intelligent-design" advocates. But there is no reason why evolutionary mechanisms arising from the "interaction of human groups, factions, and individual agents," to which Flannery et al. (2005) allude, are incompatible with the "mother culture" per spective. After all, the outcome of most competitive interaction (sport con tests, for instance) is that one individual or group gains the upper hand. Just as rules of the game combined with local conditions (e.g., size and skill of the players) mechanistically determine the outcome in sporting con tests, explicit theory should provide a set of mechanisms that, combined with local conditions, furnish predictions about when and where particular evol utionary innovations, including cultural elaboration, should have arisen.</page><page sequence="3">Evolution of the Mesoamerican Mother Culture 109 signaling (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997). Bleige Bird and Smith (2005) have recently argued that a wide range of cultural phenomena that are seemingly intractable to evolutionary analysis, including ritual, symbolism, and prestige-related activities, may be explicable in terms of costly signaling. One may add, as I do here (and see Neiman 1997), that archaeological phenomena that seem puzzling from a fitness-maximization perspective, such as wasteful expendi ture in stone carving and long-distance transport of bulky, fragile ceramic vessels, also conform to predictions derived from costly sig naling theory. Also called the "handicap principle" (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997), costly signaling predicts the evolution of signaling systems that reliably communicate information about some underlying quality. As Cronk (2005) points out, "costly" may be a misleading label because the essence of the principle is that the signal must be hard to produce, except by individuals who actually possess the underlying quality being advertised. For individuals possessing the quality being advertised, the advertisement may entail no great cost in energy or time, whereas individuals without the quality may be incapable of advertising it no matter how much energy or time they expend. Put another way, higher-quality individuals incur a lower marginal cost for advertising (Grafen 1990b; Zahavi and Zahavi 1997). Costly (or hard to fake) signals may be either between- or within species. As an example of between-species signaling, Arabian bab blers studied by Amotz Zahavi (Zahavi and Zahavi 1997) fly to the tops of trees and call loudly when they see a circling raptor. Although a commonsense explanation might be that the babblers are calling to "warn" others in their group, natural selection should not produce such a group-beneficial trait because of the high cost to the caller's fitness, and in any case such an explanation is inconsistent with the specifics of the display: it is unnecessarily loud, repeated too many times, continues even in the absence of other babblers, and is sometimes a group activity rather than some thing done by an individual sentinel. Zahavi and Zahavi (1997) explain the behavior instead as a signal to the raptor that he has been spotted, which means that the necessary element of surprise has been lost. The babbler gains if the raptor moves on to other prey and the raptor gains because it avoids wasted effort. The under lying quality being conveyed by the call is the babbler's knowledge of the raptor's whereabouts. The signal's reliability is ensured because the high cost of exposure (the possibility of being caught by the raptor) ensures that babblers who issue these calls have, in fact, spotted a raptor; if babblers tried to trick the raptors by calling whether or not they had seen a specific raptor, the raptors would still have surprise on their side, and the behavior would be eliminated by selection. Another classic example of between-species signaling is the stot ting behavior of gazelles, wherein, when stalked, the gazelles repeat edly jump straight up into the air, thus making their location obvious, while at the same time expending energy that could be put toward escaping from the predator (Bleige Bird and Smith 2005; Cronk 2005; Zahavi and Zahavi 1997). The costly signaling explanation of the gazelle's behavior is that it enhances the fitness of both predator and prey: the gazelle's fitness is enhanced to the extent that the display discourages a predator from initiating pursuit, which would certainly entail energy expenditure by the prey and might eventuate in the prey becoming dinner for the pred ator; the predator's fitness is enhanced if the gazelle's display reliably communicates underlying health and strength, thus leading the predator to avoid pursuits with a low probability of success. Although in the long run the interests of the gazelle and the predator are in conflict, there is a temporary confluence of inter ests if the gazelle being stalked is, in fact, capable of outrunning the predator; the selectively advantageous choice for both parties is for the predator to abandon the pursuit. One might object here (as one reviewer did) that this example leaves unspecified the mechanisms by which the predator decodes the prey's signal, but this is an anthropomorphic red herring: no decoding is needed because natural selection has coupled the stotting of the gazelle with reluc tance on the part of predators to waste energy in low-probability pursuits. Threats are a good example of within-species signals. Two rivals both benefit if the likely loser walks away from a physical contest, since both conserve energy and avoid injury. Thus, there is a mutual advantage to be gained if a threat accurately conveys information about motivation, confidence, resolve, strength, and other character istics necessary to win a physical contest. Zahavi and Zahavi (1997: 17-22) point out that threat postures of many species, including humans, increase vulnerability to a rival's attack, and that this cost is only bearable by highly motivated individuals who are con fident that they will win. Insufficiently motivated or weak individ uals do not threaten or threaten unconvincingly because the likelihood and direct physical costs of losing are too great. Tendencies to make threats without sufficient motivation and ability would be eliminated as fakers pay high fitness costs, includ ing death, in contests that escalate to violence. This is the mechan ism by which selection ensures that threats are reliable signals in the sense that there is a direct correlation between an individual's will ingness to remain vulnerable in case of attack (a high cost) and his/ her ability to win a physical contest. HUMAN PRESTIGE DISPLAYS AS COSTLY SIGNALING A common form of costly signaling in humans involves activities designed to advertise prestige (Bliege Bird and Smith 2005; Hawkes and Bliege Bird 2002), a quality that has an evolutionary basis in greater reproductive success. Driving a Ferrari, holding a potlatch, and philanthropy command attention and confer prestige because they provide reliable evidence of an individual's ability to harness resources. Individuals may have a host of idiosyncratic motivations for engaging in such activities and may deny that they have anything to do with prestige seeking or reproductive success. But, no matter what else they are intended to communicate, the actual costs of these activities guarantees that they also are true signals of resource access; only someone with real money can afford to drive a Ferrari; day laborers and university professors normally cannot. Where do the human motivation to seek prestige and the corre sponding tendency to admire and cater to prestigious individuals come from? Status in most social species, including our closest rela tives, the chimpanzees, comes through dominance, which has an etiology distinct from prestige (Henrich and Gil-White 2001). Joseph Henrich and Francisco Gil-White (2001) develop an "infor mation goods" theory of how the psychology of "prestige" or "freely conferred deference" could have evolved in the human lineage. Following Boyd and Richerson (e.g., 1985), they argue that cultural transmission circumvents some of the costs of individual learning, and this explains how prestige and cultural transmission could have evolved in tandem within the human lineage. The capacity for cultural transmission, which established the complementary roles of model and learner, changed the selective environment, so</page><page sequence="4">110 Neff that traits engineered "to extract reproductive benefit from the flow of socially transmitted information" (Henrich and Gil-White 2001: 167) were favored. From the learner's point of view, such an environment favors strategies that gain access to the best models. An ability to show deference is thus favored by selection because it enhances access to more-capable models. Sexual selection enters the picture because, from the model's point of view, repro ductive advantage can be gained from being emulated—more emu lators equates to greater prestige, and since prestige signals quality, prestige leads to more mating opportunities. Note that "learner" and "teacher" are not invariant identities, but rather variable roles that individuals may adopt in different social situations. Because of the reproductive payoff from being recognized as skilled or knowl edgeable (i.e., the reproductive payoff of prestige), selection favors efforts to accumulate and advertise prestige. In sum, Henrich and Gil-White's model posits that humans have an evolved capacity for showing deference and a corresponding propensity to exploit freely conferred deference for reproductive benefit. Why would humans pay the costs of prestige displays when human language can effectively communicate hidden qualities? Or, in historical-evolutionary terms, once language evolved, why would selection maintain largesse, magnanimity, and other costly status displays, when underlying qualities could be communicated much more easily and cheaply in words? In fact, the low cost of language is its downfall: using language, humans can inflate, lie, and distort. Potential mates and allies would be much better advised to pay close attention to signs of quality that are guaranteed by their cost to be reliably related to quality. The interests of signa lers, who benefit from the prestige associated with widespread appreciation of their superior qualities, and the interests of audience members, who benefit from guaranteed-reliable information, are both served by the wasteful, non-linguistic prestige-signaling system. Anthropologists and other human scientists have long recog nized the importance of prestige-signaling systems in human relations. As Bleige Bird and Smith (2005) point out (see also Cronk 2005; Zahavi and Zahavi 1997), this theoretical tradition extends from the "practice theory" of Pierre Bourdieu (1977) back to earlier work of Marcel Mauss (1924) and Thorstein Veblen (1979 [1899]). In the work of these theorists, gifts, altruistic acts, conspicuous consumption, and conspicuous generosity are viewed as means to accumulate "symbolic capital"—obligations on the part of others, respect from others, etc. Accumulation of symbolic capital provides an incentive for senders of wasteful advertisements, but why would giving lavish gifts or other forms of conspicuous wastefulness generate any response in the receivers of the gifts? Zahavi's handicap principle, foreshadowed by Veblen's notion of "invidious comparison" pro vides the answer: the reliability of information conveyed, which is ensured by the actual high cost of lavish gifts and displays, is the basic incentive for receivers to participate in the signaling system (Bleige Bird and Smith 2005). Invidious comparison enables all members of an audience to gauge their own relative status and to decide whom to consider a potential model, patron, or ally. Prestige signaling characterizes even mundane, non-elaborate aspects of human existence. For instance, careful analysis of return rates for hunters and gatherers often reveals that male hunting makes little sense in terms of direct fitness benefits, such as caloric return (Hawkes 1993). Returns from hunting large animals tend to be lower than gathering or hunting small, abundant animals; large prey are typically shared, with no preference for related individuals or mates; and there is little evidence that meat sharing can be explained by reciprocity (Hawkes 1993; Hawkes and Bliege Bird 2002). Why would males work harder than necess ary to get enough to eat, and why would they share their earnings with kin as well as non-kin, mates as well as non-mates, with little chance of repayment? Hawkes and Bliege Bird (2002; Smith and Bliege Bird 2000) argue that hunting is better understood as a means to advertise quality, and that observers of the advertisements have a variety of incentives to pay attention to the information that relative hunting success provides. Ultimately, the payoff for the hunter is enhanced prestige and, consequently, enhanced access to mates. In archaeology, prestige competition has been hypothesized to explain an increase in large animal hunting from middle through late Holocene times in California (Hildebrandt and McGuire 2002), and Aldenderfer (2006:190) has recently suggested that herding in the Andes may have originated as "an alternative means by which a man can signal his positive qualities to potential mates and allies." The focus here, however, is on cultural elaboration, and if costly signaling theory is to promote understanding of cultural elaboration, it must point to explanations for the tremendous variability in elab oration seen in the ethnographic, historical, and archaeological records. One useful result (Grafen 1990b) is that the level of costly signaling will scale with its payoff, which is a function of the number of competitors, i.e., audience size, and with the variance in the underlying quality being signaled (see also Neiman 1997; Zahavi and Zahavi 1997). Applied to human social status displays, the underlying quality is control of resources, which means that lav ishness of displays must depend on resource availability and struc ture: more total resources available for human consumption and relatively predictable resource yields will permit population growth (increasing audience size) together with increasing variance in accumulated resources (increasing difference between haves and have-nots). Bleige Bird and Smith (2005:234) make the second point, arguing that predictability of subsistence yields enhances the reliability of subsistence output as an indicator of producer quality: under stable conditions, industrious farmers with the best land or talented salmon fishermen with the best fishing gear and best knowledge of salmon habits consistently out-perform their col leagues and are able to accumulate larger and larger bases for funding public works or other advertisements of their own quality. Over time, relatively stable subsistence systems thus give rise to more stable status hierarchies and more elaborate advertising of status. The dependence of prestige-signaling's conspicuousness on the overall potential to accumulate wealth and the overall variance in wealth, both of which depend on the stability and productivity of the resource base, may account for the near-universal inclusion of "food surpluses" in the list of characteristics that define "complex society" (e.g., Evans 2004). In Mesoamerica, public architecture, monumental art, and other physical manifestations of "complex societies," which embody accumulated wealth and thus are state ments about control of wealth, post-date the advent of settled villages and emergence of stable subsistence systems based predo minantly on agriculture. Moreover, as I argue in greater detail below (see also Neff 2011a), their most salient early expressions occur in a region of prodigious and stable biotic productivity, the lowland region stretching from the Gulf Coast of Veracruz to the Pacific coast of southern Chiapas and Guatemala. Another important consideration in understanding human pres tige displays is that their specific form varies according to historical circumstances. Veblen (1979 [1899]: 166), perhaps the first to offer a</page><page sequence="5">Evolution of the Mesoamerican Mother Culture systematic treatment of human prestige signaling, attributes this historical contingency to the forces of cultural selection: Conspicuous wastefulness does not directly afford ground for variation and growth, but conformity to its requirements is a condition to the survival of such innovations as may be made on other grounds. In whatever way usages and customs and methods of expenditure arise, they are all subject to the selective action of this norm of reputability; and the degree in which they conform to its requirements is a test of their fitness to survive in the competition with other similar usages and customs. Veblen, as clearly as any social scientist influenced by Darwin, understood that humans are products of natural selection, and this means that humans are predisposed to "conspicuous wastefulness" when it serves their own reproductive interests. However, human dispositions alone are insufficient to predict the specific manifes tations of status displays ("usages and customs and methods of expenditure"), which depend for their specific form on ongoing selection of culturally inherited variants in specific historical circumstances. Natural selection may also help determine the expression of human prestige displays. This argument has been developed by James Boone (1998, 2000; Boone and Kessler 1999), who suggests that if generosity toward subordinates emerges as one component of prestige signaling, it will improve the group's competitiveness in ongoing conflicts with other groups and will also increase the lineage's chances of surviving through unpredictable population bottlenecks. Costly signaling theory is potentially useful to archaeology because it provides a set of expectations about how signals will be designed given the varying interests of senders and receivers. Similar expectations emerge, whether the design is wholly by natural selection (as in many signaling systems in nature) or partly by other "design forces," such as human problem solving, subcon scious learning, or cultural selection (Bleige Bird and Smith 2005: 226; Cronk 2005:610). If we can identify components of the material record that may have served as signals, we can use costly signaling theory to make predictions about the conditions under which they would have been created and the historical trajectory of their expressions. THE HANDICAP PRINCIPLE IN MESOAMERICAN PREHISTORY Fraser Neiman (1997) introduced Zahavi's understanding of the handicap principle into Mesoamerican archaeology by arguing that dated Maya monuments constitute reliable (though wasteful) advertisements of the ability of elite individuals to come out on top in political contests. ("Wasteful," in this context, refers to an expenditure of resources that could be used for the basic biological needs of maintenance and reproduction; as noted above, expendi tures on elaborate structures, like peacock's tails or pyramids, are puzzling precisely because they are wasteful in this sense.) Neiman's purpose was to provide an explicit, theory-based defi nition of the "Maya collapse" as shrinkage in the range of competi tive quality coupled with a shift in audience size and composition. Focusing on dated monuments made it possible to test alternative hypotheses about the temporal trajectory of terminal monument dates and about the conditions that triggered the "collapse." Beyond the dated monuments, however, many other features of the Classic Maya archaeological record qualify as energetically was teful advertisements of the power and influence of elite individuals. In Arthur Demarest's (1992:143) words, "the role of ritual, religion, public display, and monumental propaganda was central to Classic Maya society.. .[the] bulk of Maya labor was spent in construction of the elaborate stages of their ceremonial centers—plazas, temples, facades, monuments, costumes, exotics, and parapherna lia—all for these ritual events." Although Neiman's was the first explicit use of Zahavi's evol utionary theory of costly signaling in archaeology, ideas similar to the handicap principle have some precedent in discussions of the origins of Mesoamerican civilization. John Clark and his colleagues (Blake and Clark 1999; Clark and Blake 1994; Clark and Gosser 1995), for instance, argue that status competition involving altruistic acts drove the emergence of rank societies on the Pacific coast of southeastern Mesoamerica during the Late Archaic and Initial Early Formative periods. The earliest (Barra phase, ca. 1800 B.C.) ceramics are well-made serving vessels that would have been appro priate for serving maize beer or other liquids at feasts held to win political allies. Around 1600 B.C., some individual or faction had the wherewithal to fund the building of a 9 x 18 m structure at Paso de la Amada (Blake 1991). A ballcourt was built at roughly the same time (Hill et al. 1998), thus providing a setting for political competitions analogous to those of the Classic Maya. Expenditures of effort to import ceramic technology, hold feasts, and build public facilities are "wasteful" in the sense that they are not required for reproduction, yet they entail obvious costs in terms of energy or resource expenditure. Like other kinds of cultural elaboration, they present a puzzle for evolutionary theory. The puzzle is resolved, however, by viewing such activities as reliable signals of an individual's ability to provide for those whom he would want to enlist as followers. By paying attention to the extravagance of the expenditures, potential followers gain reliable information about "aggrandizers" in the community. A partial version of the handicap principle also appears in Kent Flannery's (1968) seminal statement of the "sister culture" perspec tive on the Olmec. The interaction of Gulf Coast and highland people at this time, according to Flannery, grew out of prestige seeking behavior on both sides. Oaxaca Valley people made magne tite mirrors and exported them to Gulf lowland people "to enhance and reinforce previously-existing systems of status," while Gulf lowland individuals made massive offerings of non-local serpen tine, jade, and magnetite as a statement of their own ability to create and destroy wealth (Flannery 1968:107). Citing Drucker et al. (1959), Flannery (1968:107-108) says of a massive buried ser pentine pavement at La Venta, "the act of creating and burying such offerings, made valuable by the difficulty of their acquisition, was the important point." In other words, such a massive, wasteful expenditure provided reliable information to the local populace about who controlled the most resources. Flannery also contends that Early Formative exchange, which started out as prestige seeking, would have had adaptive value (positive effects on biologi cal fitness) to the extent that it buffered occasional agricultural shortfalls. While the insights of previous commentators, such as Flannery (1968) and Clark and his collaborators (e.g., Clark and Blake 1994) converge in some respects with costly signaling theory, the promise of explicit theory is that it should provide more predictions, more precise predictions, and more novel predictions. Explicit use of costly signaling theory should move us beyond insightful sum maries of empirical patterns. The starting premise is that the Early</page><page sequence="6">112 Neff Formative archaeological record is made up in part of the remains of signaling systems created by various design forces (natural selec tion, decision making by humans, cultural selection, etc.) in a context of competitive interaction among individuals, groups, and factions. With some additional information about context, such as the fact that subsistence systems of the Early Formative period were productive enough to permit accumulation of surplus wealth in some regions, can we use costly signaling theory to make specific predictions about the form and distribution of archaeological remains in the Gulf lowlands and elsewhere in Mesoamerica, pre dictions that may move us beyond debates over the validity of the "mother culture" and "sister culture" metaphors? THE DESIGN OF OLMEC PRESTIGE SIGNALS Local Audiences As Druckeret al. (1959) and Flannery (1968) pointed out long ago, the Gulf Olmec archaeological record contains an abundance of state ments about wealth and political power. The famous "colossal heads" of San Lorenzo and La Venta advertised political superiority in a most direct way, by depicting powerful individuals on multi-ton carved basalt boulders dragged and floated 60 km or more from source areas in the Tuxtlas Mountains. Added to the time and energy expended in transportation, exceptional skill and time would have been required to finish carving the monuments. In accord with Zahavi's handicap principle, colossal heads would have been imposs ible to fake. Whatever other meaning they might have had for the Olmec, they are without question reliable statements about the capacity of certain Gulf lowland individuals to control human labor and other resources. The actual expense involved in their creation is a design feature that nullifies any tendency to disbelief or skepticism on the part of receivers of the signal, who benefit from the acquisition of reliable information about variation across the population in subsis tence wealth and control of human labor. Some Olmec statements about wealth were made by conspicu ously removing it from circulation. Buried offerings throughout the Gulf Olmec heartland, such as those of El Manati (Ortiz and Rodríguez 2000) and the massive serpentine pavements at La Venta, are prominent examples. At El Manati, a waterlogged site where Olmec made ritual offerings throughout the Early Formative period, Ortiz and Rodríguez (2000:83) report a single "great ritual event" during the Macayal A phase (contemporary with San Lorenzo's florescence) that involved the massive burial of anthropomorphic wood busts along with polished jadeite and ser pentine axes, hematite balls, wood scepters, pectorals, and disarticu lated human infants. As Ortiz and Rodríguez (2000:91) observe, the offerings "surely exceeded the mere zeal of propitiatory rites." La Venta has been characterized as a constructed environment that consists of formally marked entrances at the north and south, 40 mounds in nine architectural complexes, 90 known stone sculp tures, and scores of buried offerings and caches (Diehl 2004:62; Drucker et al. 1959). Massive Offering 1 in Complex A was a rec tangular pit 23.1 x 23.1 m containing 28 layers of serpentine blocks totaling more than 1,000 tons overlain by a single-layer mosaic of 485 finished serpentine blocks. Drucker and his colleagues, who excavated Offering 1, note that it was functionally unrelated to the structure above it and that it was buried immediately after emplace ment; these and other features lead them to characterize Offering 1 as a massive offering of embodied human labor (Drucker et al. 1959:footnote 33). Offering 4, also in La Venta Complex A, contains an arrangement of jadeite and serpentine figurines and celts that appears to depict a scene from La Venta palace or ritual life. More than 250 jade or serpentine celts and axes, some incised, have been found in Complex A alone. Jadeite was brought to La Venta from the Rio Motagua region of eastern Guatemala, and serpentine likely derived from metamorphic out crops that lie roughly 100 km south of La Venta. As Diehl (2004: 74) says, "[the] effort and costs they expended to obtain these materials was so substantial that the word 'staggering' is not an exaggeration." Moreover, like the El Manati great ritual event, the act of burying such massive embodiments of human energy made an unmistakable statement about control of wealth and resources. Massive displays of wealth, whether in the form of carved monu ments or in the form of buried offerings would seem to be good can didates for "costly signals" in the sense that they are honest statements about control of wealth, but the theory of costly signaling permits more specific predictions about when and where to expect increases in signaling intensity. For one thing, the theory predicts that increasing audience size and increasing variance in the quality being advertised (political quality, or control of resources) would produce more advertising and more elaborate advertising (Neiman 1997). This furnishes expectations about the ecological context in which Olmec cultural elaboration would have taken off, which are discussed in the following section. Extra-local Audiences While carved stone monuments and massive buried offerings made statements about power and wealth to local audiences, export of embodied wealth provides a means by which Gulf lowland individ uals and factions could advertise their power and influence more widely. Flannery et al. (2005) endeavor to make sense of Early Formative exchange with a strategy of empirical generalization, arguing that reciprocal exchange makes the Gulf Olmec and their contemporaries comparable to ethnographically known Native American chiefdoms. Generalizing, Flannery et al. (2005:11221) note that Native American chiefs "loved to get gifts from other regions," offering no explanation of reciprocity other than the typo logical argument that it is a characteristic trait of "chiefdoms." Costly signaling theory as well as the "symbolic capital" perspec tive of Bourdieu (1977) and others (Mauss 1924; Veblen 1979 [ 1899]) would account for pervasive reciprocity from a perspective 180° off from the one adopted by Flannery et al. (2005). That is, per vasive reciprocity should arise not from the fact that chiefs loved to get gifts but from the fact that they loved to give gifts to chiefs in other regions in order to make their qualities of power and influence widely visible. Gifts to one's competitors incur obligations, and the more resources one has to invest in gifts, the larger and more numer ous the obligations he/she will be owed. Expensive gifts and attend ant obligations are thus a reliable signal of an individual's power, wealth, and influence. They are given in order to accumulate sym bolic capital. The reliability of information conveyed, which is ensured by the actual high cost of lavish gifts, is the basic incentive for receivers to participate in the signaling system. Costly signaling theory thus provides a theoretical framework for understanding Early Formative long-distance goods circulation as a strategy for interregional advertising of prestige. We may now ask, if long distance exchange did constitute a costly signaling system, what design constraints shaped its evolutionary history? To begin with, different materials vary in their potential useful ness as interregional prestige signals. To be reliable signals about</page><page sequence="7">Evolution of the Mesoamerican Mother Culture 113 control of resources and human labor, portable items would have to embody substantial expenditure. Rare and difficult-to-obtain items, such as ornaments made of jadeite, would qualify. The suitability of pottery as a prestige signal is more problematic. While fine and decorated wares may be well-suited for signaling skill and other qualities of the potter (Bliege Bird and Smith 2005; Bowser 2000), pots on their own have limited capacity to signal wealth and status because clay, the main raw material, can be procured almost anywhere. Moreover, plastic modeling of clay, while it requires considerable skill, does not require the same investment of time as carving basalt, serpentine, or jadeite. Even figure-painted Classic Maya polychrome vases were consumed in a variety of dom estic contexts within the Maya lowlands, suggesting that access was minimally restricted by their cost. The relatively low cost of ceramic production has two important implications. First, pots only become suitable as prestige signals once some extra investment has been made that elevates their cost. In particular, the investment needed to transport pots over sub stantial distances using humans as beasts of burden would augment the cost of a pot in this way. The second implication of the low cost associated with ceramic production is that long-distance exchange of ceramics rarely makes any economic sense without the added element of prestige signaling. This means that, under most con ditions, long-distance transport of ceramics a priori is most likely to represent a costly signaling system rather than economic exchange (Neff 2011b). The exceptions to this rule generally involve lowered costs of transport, for example transport via canoe or truck. The ceramics exchanged long distances across Early Formative Mesoamerica are most plausibly construed as costly signals based on these observations. When they appeared outside the Gulf lowlands, distinctive dec orative and technological features unique to lowland pots would have clearly marked the vessels as imports, so that the expense that their importation involved was immediately recognizable. Whatever other meaning might have been conveyed by imported vessels, they made clear statements about the ability of lowland indi viduals or factions to put resources toward non-subsistence ends. In accord with the handicap principle, reliability of these vessels as advertisements of wealth and power was ensured by the actual high cost involved in making and transporting them. Non-Gulf lowland audiences gained reliable new information about the com petitive quality of individuals and groups in other regions whom they could not observe directly, and this gave them the necessary incentive to participate as receivers in the signaling system. An exported Olmec pot could be used by successive owners in a succession of prestige displays. The initial Gulf-lowland exporter gained prestige from a stream of visitors paying off obligations with gifts of magnetite mirrors, obsidian, and other highland products, which would certainly have been noticed by the local Gulf lowland populace. Non-Gulf lowland individuals who obtained lowland serving vessels gained both information about Gulf lowland individuals and groups and the prestige of possessing expensive, foreign items. These items could then be passed on as gifts, incurring additional rounds of obligations. Some of these exchanges may have involved valued commodities such as magne tite mirrors, as Flannery (1968) suggested. In this way, the costs of transporting heavy, bulky serving vessels may have been borne not just by lowland exporters or highland importers, but by a series of individuals along the line, each using the wealth embodied in the pots (by virtue of the expense of transport) to serve their own status seeking goals. The journey of a pot from the Gulf lowlands to Tlapacoya, San Jose Mogote, or Etlatongo might have involved one, two, or more steps; it is the cumulative investment required to move heavy, fragile vessels over long distances that makes those vessels reliable signals (to us as well as to Early Formative people) of power and wealth. At each stage of the distribution process, Olmec pots are costly signals in the Zahavian sense. Initially, export of pots from the heartland serves as a reliable signal of Gulf Olmec ability to harness resources toward non-subsistence ends, thus incurring obli gations on the part of neighbors. At the last stage in the process, the imported pots are reliable signals of the capabilities of highland individuals or factions. Importantly, however, they are also state ments about the prestige value of items associated with the Gulf Olmec and of the Olmec themselves. Flannery (1968) used the second part of the argument to account for the appearance of Gulf Olmec symbols and artifacts in Oaxaca. In the first case, (Gulf Olmec funding the long-distance circulation of pots) the archaeolo gical evidence of exchange tells us directly about the superior competitive abilities of Gulf Olmec; in the second case, the archae ological evidence is an indirect but still unmistakable affirmation that Gulf Olmec quality was widely known. From either perspec tive, the extent to which lowland pots dominated the long-distance ceramic circulation system is a direct measure of the superior prestige-signaling capabilities of the Gulf Olmec. If Gulf lowland ceramics did not dominate in long-distance ceramic circulation, it would undermine the hypothesis that Gulf Olmec were more heavily invested in interregional prestige signaling than other groups. Although long-distance exchange of pots may reliably advertise wealth and political power, there is a serious design flaw in such a signaling system, which leads to another expectation about the tem poral trajectory of an interregional prestige-signaling system based on ceramics. The impossibility of falsification is what guarantees that a prestige signal honestly conveys the sender's superior access to resources, and a prestige signaling system based on a tech nology that is not inherently costly or restricted in availability contains the seeds of its own demise. In the case of ceramics, con vincing copies, even copies of fine pots made with sophisticated technology and special raw materials, are common: Although it took some time, European ceramists eventually duplicated hard paste Chinese porcelain. Copying Olmec carved-incised gray pottery was largely a matter of mastering forming and decorative techniques and applying them to clays that took on an appropriate color when reduction fired. Fine white pots, similarly, could be copied as long as high-kaolin clay deposits could be located and techniques of surface finishing and firing could be mastered. Upon first appearance, carved-incised and fine white pots would have been recognizable as imports and therefore recognizably valu able (due to the time and energy expended in their transport). But attempts to copy the distinctive characteristics of high-value imported pots probably began with the first load of pots to arrive in a region. As local copies proliferated, local artisans' skill increased, and the total range of variation of carved-incised pottery increased due to local innovations, it would have become harder and harder to tell the "real thing" from local copies. When a pot with distinct Gulf lowland features showed up in some com munity, its appearance would no longer have reliably signified a great expenditure of effort, and such pots thus would have lost their potential to signal prestige. In this way, cultural selection ensured that long-distance transport of Gulf lowland pottery was a short-lived phenomenon, while also ensuring that ceramic</page><page sequence="8">114 Neff decorative conventions initially associated with the Gulf Olmec were widely spread. In sum, long-distance ceramic circulation makes little sense except as a form of prestige signaling, yet the prestige value of transported pots is rapidly undermined by counterfeiting. The process just outlined can spread ceramic decorative conven tions over a wide area, as potters produce better and better copies of pots that were originally imported as prestige items. The process also augments decorative diversity, as the potential for innovation rises along with the number of potters in different regions working within a broadly shared set of conventions. The end result may be the emergence of a widespread "horizon style." What the evolutionary theory of costly signaling adds to discus sions of the Olmec, then, is a series of specific predictions about pat terning in the material record. First, if monumental art is a prestige signal in the Zahavian sense, its scale must depend on the payoff from signaling, which is dependent on audience size, and on the var iance in the quality being signaled (e.g., Grafen 1990b; Neiman 1997; Zahavi and Zahavi 1997). In the present case (see also Neff 2011 a), the quality being signaled is control over resources, so a dra matic increase in the scale of monumental art is predicted to coincide with conditions favorable for high populations and where the geographical structure of resources, including defensibility, would have favored high variance in accumulation of wealth (social inequality). Other means of wasteful advertising, such as investment in export of gifts, are also expected to appear under these conditions. With respect to items of long-distance trade, the theory also predicts: (1) that use of ceramics as long-distance "was teful advertisements" would lead to the spread of a recognizable "horizon style" across a wide area; (2) that if ceramics were used as long-distance wasteful advertisements, long-distance ceramic dis tribution would have been a short-lived phenomenon; and, (3) that long-distance ceramic distribution would have been replaced by long-distance distribution of more difficult to falsify items that could serve more reliably as wasteful advertisements. MESOAMERICA'S EARLY HORIZON The above discussion touches on a few components of the Olmec archaeological record that qualify as "wasteful advertisements," that is, reliable signals of the power of individuals and/or factions to harness resources toward non-subsistence ends. Chronology and other elements of the context in which these items appeared were largely ignored in order to highlight design features of the arti facts and monuments, especially their cost. Yet, it is the specific his torical context and the trajectory of changes that best warrant the inference that Olmec cultural elaboration was shaped by an evol utionary process that selected for costly, reliable systems for signal ing wealth and political power. Major steps in the evolution of Olmec cultural elaboration took place during the Early and Middle Formative periods, roughly 1800-500 B.C. This section summarizes the archaeological evidence for how practices of cultural elaboration evolved and how they led to the dissemination of ceramic traits that make an "Early Horizon" (Flannery and Marcus 1994) or "Early Olmec Horizon" (Diehl 2004) recognizable in the archaeological record. The following section addresses the post-Early Horizon fate of elaborate ritual and artistic practices introduced by the Olmec. Part of the argument of the previous section is that prestige sig naling should scale with audience size and variance in the quality being advertised (control of resources in this case). Conditions in which these variables are increasing should be associated with more advertising and more elaborate advertising (Grafen 1990b; Neiman 1997; Zahavi and Zahavi 1997). Evidence reviewed below indicates that investments in cultural elaboration during the San Lorenzo phase (ca. 1450-1100 b.c.) in the Gulf lowlands fit these expectations—the predicted increases in signaling intensity become visible in the archaeological record at a time and in a location where resources were abundant and resource structure would have favored increasing variance in access to wealth across the population (Neff 201 la). Predecessors of the Gulf Olmec occupied the lowland tropical forests of eastern Mesoamerica during the Archaic period, but popu lation densities were so low that the Archaic residents are almost impossible to detect except in the paleoenvironmental record (Neff et al. 2006c) or in the littoral zone, where they sometimes left large shell mounds (Voorhies 2004). Shortly after 2000 B.C., during a dry interval (Neff et al. 2006d), these populations crossed the threshold of archaeological visibility in a dramatic way, with Early Formative house mounds appearing in a nearly unbroken chain along the Pacific coast (Arroyo 2000; Blake et al. 1995; Neff et al. 2006c). Ecofactual, settlement pattern, and bone isotope evidence all favor the view that this adaptive shift involved intensification of a diversified subsistence system that combined efficient exploitation of estuarine or other wetland resources and horticultural activities on the adjacent dry land. The evidence rules out a full-time commitment to maize agriculture. As of approximately 1600 B.C., Early Formative populations with similar pottery occupied the lowland area stretching from the Gulf Coast to western El Salvador. Large residences, ballcourts, and other puzzlingly wasteful archaeological manifestations appeared in parts of this region between 1700 and 1500 B.C. As dis cussed above, an explanation bearing some similarities to the prestige-signaling framework being developed here has been used to account for these incipient elaborations as well as the earlier appearance of well-made ceramic containers (Clark and Blake 1994; Clark and Gosser 1995). Given the mixed wetland/horticultural adaptation of lowland Early Formative populations, one can expect subsistence yields to have varied from place to place as a result of geographic variation in soil productivity, rainfall, wetland hydrology, and other environ mental factors (Stark 2000:34). Mazatan, for instance, had an edge over the eastern Manchón swamp, about 100 km to the southeast, where heavy, clayey soils inhibited horticulture on dry land adjacent to the estuary (Neff et al. 2006c). For several reasons, the Gulf Coast lowlands would have been favored in terms of overall biotic productivity. First, rainfall on the Gulf Coast is abundant and predictable, averaging between 2,000 and 3,000 mm annually, with less than 20% variation in rain fall totals from year to year (Vivó Escoto 1965:Figure 13)andarela tively short dry season (Coe and Diehl 1980a). Second, alluvial soils of the northern Isthmus of Tehuantepec are replenished by annual flooding of the Rio Coatzacoalcos (Coe and Diehl 1980a). Coe and Diehl (1980a, 1980b) note that, unlike other regions of Mesoamerica, maize agriculture is a year-round pursuit in the vicin ity of San Lorenzo, with up to four maize crops on different soil types in the region. Fourth, riverine and lacustrine resources are abundant in the rivers, oxbows, and ponds of the region. Fifth, like other lowland areas, once the forest had been partially cleared for horticulture, deer and other game would have flourished. Not only was the Gulf lowland region favored climatically com pared to neighboring regions, the time period of concern here, the</page><page sequence="9">Evolution of the Mesoamerican Mother Culture 115 latter half of the second millennium B.C., also may have been a period of relatively favorable conditions in the region. In contrast to the 2000-1500 B.C. period, the centuries following 1500 B.C., coinciding with San Lorenzo's rise to prominence, seem to have brought wetter, more stable conditions to southern Mesoamerica. The most relevant climatic record is from the Pacific coast of Guatemala (Neff et al. 2006d), but a high-resolution ocean sediment record from the Cariaco Basin off the north coast of Venezuela (Haug et al. 2001) also shows a relatively favorable interval begin ning shortly after 1500 B.C. Thus, while the Gulf lowlands were always favorable for human occupation, the time period of concern here would have been optimum for the growth of large populations (large audience size). The predicted association of stable, favorable climatic conditions with increased advertising can be tested more rigorously when chronological control improves at key Gulf lowland centers, especially San Lorenzo, and paleoen vironmental data of greater resolution become available from sites within the Gulf lowlands. The structure of resources in the Gulf lowlands is also important here. In a region of high productivity, San Lorenzo stood out for its agricultural potential, especially the abundance of highly productive river-levee soils (Coe and Diehl 1980b: 147-148; Lowe 1989). Individuals and factions who controlled the best land, such as the levees around San Lorenzo thus enjoyed consistently superior access to the fundamental source of wealth in the lowlands. Additionally, key cultivars, especially maize, were evolving toward greater productivity, so that the levee-land gardens around San Lorenzo would have yielded larger and larger crops (equaling more wealth) over the years. An ameliorating and stable climate after 1500 B.C. would also have accentuated the comparative advan tage of the most-productive river levee land, thus increasing the var iance in wealth and social status. Finally, San Lorenzo also occupies an elevated position on the lowland landscape, and it was sur rounded by water during the Early Formative (Coe and Diehl 1980; Diehl 2004), making it among the most defensible of Gulf lowland locations. The abundance and predictability of resources in the Gulf low lands favored the precocious emergence of a pattern in which wealth was accumulated and used in prestige displays. Prestige dis plays, always pursued by humans, and archaeologically visible in the Gulf lowlands starting around 1850 B.C. at El Manatí (Ortiz and Rodriguez 2000), would have increased in sumptuousness as differences in wealth accumulation and social status grew during the favorable interval after 1500 B.C. One salient, archaeologically visible outcome of this process in the Gulf lowlands is the San Lorenzo-phase archaeological record, including the sculptural corpus, which was being assembled by 1450 B.C. (Coe and Diehl 1980). Other evidence that the scale of wasteful advertising in the Gulf lowlands was intensifying shortly after 1500 B.C. include the "great ritual event" of the Macayal A Phase at El Manati previously mentioned (Ortiz and Rodriguez 2000). More precise quantification of the scale of monumental activity and better control over chronol ogy at San Lorenzo and other Gulf lowland sites will furnish additional tests of predictions derived from the costly signaling framework. The real crux of the mother vs. sister culture debate, however, concerns the means by which a fairly uniform horizon style spread to many parts of Mesoamerica at roughly the same time that monumentality took off in the Gulf lowlands. Observers on both sides of the debate (e.g., Coe 1989; Flannery and Marcus 1994:390; Grove 1989; Lowe 1989; Tolstoy 1989) recognize shared ceramic and figurine styles at many sites in Mesoamerica between about 1450 and 1200 B.C. The debate centers on the ques tion of whether this "Early Horizon" or "Early Olmec Horizon" was spread by Gulf Olmec or invented piece-by-piece in multiple locations. The discussion in the previous section outlined a process by which a horizon style could arise out of an interregional signaling system that employed easily falsified items, such as ceramics. The central element in the process hypothesized to have gener ated the Early Horizon is prestige signaling via long-distance export of ceramics from the Gulf lowlands. According to this argu ment, with humans as beasts of burden, long-distance transport of ceramics makes little economic sense, since the functional equival ent of any cooking, carrying, or storage vessel can be manufactured almost anywhere and supplied to local consumers without the high cost of interregional transport (Neff 2011b). On this basis, Early Formative ceramic circulation is hypothesized to arise through inter regional prestige-signaling. Prior to about 1400 B.C., ceramic exchange in Mesoamerica seems to have been localized. Relevant data come from the Pacific coast, where, despite widespread ceramic similarities across Pacific coastal Chiapas and Guatemala during the initial Early Formative phases (Barra, Locona, and Ocos), instrumental neutron activation analysis (INAA) of several hundred ceramics yields no evidence of interregional ceramic circulation (unpublished data on file at the Missouri University Research Reactor [MURR] and IIRMES, CSULB). Ceramics may have traveled with people during periodic residential moves (e.g., Arnold 1999; Neff and Arroyo 2002; Neff et al. 2006c), but a signal of ceramic movement over more than a few tens of kilometers cannot be detected. The ear liest incontrovertible evidence of long-distance exchange so far comes from the Acapetahua Estuary region of southern Chiapas, where plain gray pottery identified by INAA as imports from San Lorenzo appears in Cherla Phase contexts associated with radiocar bon dates of around 1400 cal B.C. (Kennett et al. 2004). Unpublished INAA results from Cuauhtemoc, on the coastal plain south of the Acapetahua Estuary, also document San Lorenzo imports in Cherla phase contexts (Robert Rosenswig, personal communication 2005). The trickle of ceramics out of San Lorenzo around 1400 B.C. soon turned into a surprisingly large flow. The INAA study (Blomster et al. 2005; Neff et al. 2006a, 2006b) identified multiple examples of carved-incised gray and fine white pots typologically consistent with San Lorenzo Phase Calzadas Carved and Xochiltepec White that found their way from San Lorenzo to coastal Chiapas, and to highland centers like San Jose Mogote, Etlatongo, and Tlapacoya (Blomster et al. 2005; Neff et al. 2006a, 2006b). This boom in ceramic exports from the Gulf lowlands coincides with the upsurge in investment in sculptural art evident at San Lorenzo, both occurring around 1450 B.C. Like the boom in sculptural art, the boom in ceramic exports from the Gulf lowlands can be linked to ecological conditions and the resulting structure of lowland subsistence resources. The Gulf Coast was a favorable setting, the centuries following 1500 B.C. were relatively favorable, and consequently the occupants of the San Lorenzo ridge, with its highly productive river-levee soils and defensibility, found themselves relatively well off. An ameliorating climate would have permitted population to increase, thus increas ing audience size, both locally and in neighboring regions of the Gulf lowlands. By around 1400 B.C., some Gulf lowland individuals had acquired the means to fund long-distance export of ceramic</page><page sequence="10">lió Neff pots. Costly signaling theory explains why they would have exported pots once they had the means. Advertising in this way yielded sufficient payoff in the form of obligations and enhanced prestige, given the audience size (potentially obligated exchange partners) and the magnitude of the advantage they enjoyed in control over resources. One measure of the magnitude of the Gulf lowland advantage is the lopsidedness of ceramic circulation. While substantial numbers of pots found in southern Chiapas, the Mixteca Alta, Oaxaca, and the Basin of Mexico are attributed by INAA to production centers in the vicinity of San Lorenzo, not a single sherd found at San Lorenzo could be identified as an import, and no sherds sampled anywhere else could be identified as imports from anywhere other than San Lorenzo. Examples of exports from sites other than San Lorenzo almost certainly exist, but so far they have not been detected (Neff et al. 2006a). While the ceramic-provenance data alone are silent on the issue of how exactly interregional circulation of Olmec pots was funded, the fact that the only known ceramic exports are ones from the Gulf lowlands is a clear indication that interregional prestige signaling was a game dominated by Gulf lowland chiefs, especially those from San Lorenzo. The hypothesis that Early Formative ceramic circulation origi nated as interregional prestige signaling also implies that locally made imitations of high-value imports should appear in places that received imports, as local potters endeavored to duplicate the valued items (Neff 2011b). In accord with this expectation, the Olmec INAA study (Blomster et al. 2005; Neff et al. 2006a, 2006b) identified numerous locally made examples of carved-incised pottery along with Gulf imports in almost every sampled location. This result makes it clear that both the "mother culture" and "sister culture" metaphors contain grains of truth: It was the Gulf Olmec who initiated the export of ceramics as interre gional prestige signal, so it was they who stimulated the initial wide dissemination of "Olmec" ceramic traits; at the same time, as potters in highland communities imitated elements of Olmec iconography and introduced their own variations, they helped invent Mesoamerica's "Early Horizon" piece-by-piece. The same process that spread traits associated with the Early Horizon beyond the Gulf lowlands would have undermined the use of ceramics as prestige signals and led to a rapid decline in long distance ceramic circulation. This leads to a further prediction, namely that the Early Horizon, while perhaps highly visible archae ologically, represented a relatively brief interval of time. Chronological control is perhaps insufficient in most cases for a definitive test of this prediction. In southern Chiapas, however, Gulf coast imports, while present in the Cherla Phase (see above), predominantly appear during the Cuadros Phase, which may last no more than about 150 years (David Cheetham, personal com munication 2006). Better tests of the prediction that Mesoamerica's Early Horizon was short lived are needed. Enhanced chronological control in key regions, such as the Valley of Oaxaca and the Basin of Mexico, will be crucial. Direct dating of ceramics, either through luminescence or the new technique of rehydroxylation (Wilson et al. 2009) may someday provide a direct estimate of the longevity of the ceramic circulation pattern hypothesized to have engendered the widespread sharing of ceramic traits of the Early Horizon. One specific prediction about chronology needs to be tested. Flannery and his colleagues (Flannery et al. 2005; Flannery and Marcus 1994, 2000; Sharer et al. 2006) argue that highland regions, particularly the Basin of Mexico, show greater diversity of "Olmec motifs" than San Lorenzo, and this is one basis for the claim that San Lorenzo had no special role in creating the "Early Horizon." However, the Olmec profile heads that Flannery and col leagues use as examples of motifs that appear in the Basin of Mexico—but not at San Lorenzo—can be hypothesized to pertain to the beginning of the post-Early Olmec Horizon time period (Manantial Phase in the Basin of Mexico [Cheetham 2010b; Clark 2007]). Consistent with this hypothesis, a profile-head motif also appears on a Jocotal-Phase (post-Early Olmec Horizon) sherd from Pacific coastal Guatemala (Clark and Pye 2000). The Olmec profile faces on these ceramic examples are most similar to designs incised and carved on jadeite and other por table carved stone, which become common during the Middle Formative period (see Taube [2000] for numerous examples). An account of these profile "were-jaguar" representations requires a broader treatment of the evolutionary changes between Early and Middle Formative periods. MIDDLE FORMATIVE OLMEC As Gulf Olmec ceramic exports diminished, dissemination of ceramic decorative conventions declined as well. As a result, the widespread ceramic similarities that prompt investigators to recog nize an "Early" or "Early Olmec" Horizon (Diehl 2004; Flannery and Marcus 1994) declined, and Middle Formative ceramic assem blages show increasing regionalism. At the same time, jadeite and other carved greenstone celts, figurines, and jewelry show up in increasing frequency, both in the Gulf lowlands and elsewhere (e.g., Coe 1989; Diehl 2004; Lowe 1989). In addition, Olmec-style carvings, mostly low relief on natural boulders, appear at Chalcatzingo and across a wide area of eastern Mesoamerica, from the Isthmus of Tehuantepec to El Salvador (Clark and Pye 2000; Diehl 2004; Grove 1989). This section focuses on jadeite and other portable carvings and the symbolic elements often carved on them. My argument is that these portable objects replaced ceramics in interregional distribution systems because they have inherent design features that make them more reliable as interregional prestige signals. Like all evolutionary arguments, this one is about trait-frequency changes, which are driven by differences in the suitability (fitness) of the variants given the social and environmental context in which they occur. Jadeite and other greenstone have a clear advantage over cer amics as stores of wealth to be used wastefully (as prestige signals) or otherwise. Whereas ceramics can be made almost any where, jadeite is limited in its occurrence in Mesoamerica to the Motagua fault zone (Harlowe 1993; Seitz et al. 2001), and serpen tine is restricted to metamorphic zones, though it occurs more widely than jadeite. Except within source regions then, greenstones are inherently more valuable and less subject to counterfeiting than ceramics. Jadeite is also extremely hard, and shaping and carving it is time consuming. Like carved basalt monuments, the raw material for which also had to be imported, the serpentine pavements and caches of greenstone celts and figurines at La Venta are honest state ments about control of wealth. Jadeite and serpentine differ from basalt, however, in being useable for portable sculptures and per sonal ornamentation. As a result, they could be used to broadcast a statement about wealth beyond the local La Venta community. The impossibility of counterfeiting combined with portability make portable sculptures suitable for reliably advertising prestige extra-locally, and their advantage over ceramics in this regard may</page><page sequence="11">Evolution of the Mesoamerican Mother Culture 117 be hypothesized to explain why the focus of investment in export from the Gulf lowlands shifted from ceramics to greenstone. Olmec expenditure to secure difficult-to-fake jadeite raw material helps account for Middle Formative Olmec presence in southern Mesoamerica. The evidence for this presence includes the carved-relief "marching Olmecs" on boulders along the coast of Chiapas, at Takalik Abaj, Guatemala, and Chalchuapa, El Salvador (e.g., Clark and Pye 2000). These sculptures trace a supply route leading to the Motagua Valley jadeite sources. Ultimately, this hypothesis may be testable through reconnaissance and discovery of evidence of Olmec mining activity (e.g., Seitz et al. 2001) and by materials-characterization research that compares Olmec jades to raw materials from extraction sites in the Motagua Valley. Another part of the explanation for proliferation of carved jadeite and serpentine during the Middle Formative may be that greenstone became explicitly linked in the Olmec belief system with the under lying source of all wealth, maize (e.g., Coe 1989). Building on the work of Peter David Joralemon (1971), Karl Taube (1996, 2000) identifies many of the Olmec profile faces of the Middle Formative as representations of the maize god (see also Coe [ 1989] and Scheie [1996]). This iconography evinces a fundamental concern on the part of Gulf lowland people with the sources of wealth and power, mainly maize plants and rain. The cleft-head "were-jaguar," which Taube (2000) identifies as a maize god, is present in the sculptural art of San Lorenzo (e.g.. Monuments 30 and 52 [Coe and Diehl 1980a]). The cleft also appears commonly on carved-incised pottery at San Lorenzo and at other Early Formative sites. Maize-god symbolism becomes much more common and much more explicit, however, during the Middle Formative period (Taube 2000). In Middle Formative contexts, the maize god appears on sculpture, relief carvings, cave murals, jades and other portable art in the Gulf lowlands, Oaxaca, Guerrero, Morelos, the Basin of Mexico, and Pacific coastal southeastern Mesoamerica (Diehl 2004). Incised represen tations also appear on pots from Oaxaca and the Basin of Mexico as already mentioned (Flannery and Marcus 1994, 2000; Niederberger 2000). As Taube (2000) points out, the proliferation of Olmec maize symbolism during the Middle Formative coincides with unmistakable evidence of a fulltime commitment to maize agriculture in the Gulf lowlands (Rust and Leyden 1994) and elsewhere in lowland southern Mesoamerica (Blake et al. 1992a, 1992b, 1995; Rosenswig 2005). The Middle Formative also saw dramatic population growth and expansion into previously unoccupied zones in many Mesoamerican regions, a point to which I return below. In Middle Formative representations, the cleft of the maize god is sometimes depicted with an ear of corn, or a greenstone (jade or ser pentine) celt, emerging from it, and Taube (2000) argues that celts are components of maize symbolism. Celts are comparatively rare at San Lorenzo, but they were part of the great ritual event deposit at El Manati (Ortiz and Rodriguez 2000), and they are reported from a possible San Lorenzo Olmec colony in the Mazatan zone (Cheetham 2005). By the Middle Formative period, their numbers appear to increase dramatically. Massive numbers of celts and axes were excavated in Complex A at La Venta and they are com monly featured in maize god depictions (Taube 2000). Taube (2000) argues that celts, as symbolic maize ears, were storage devices for wealth generated by maize production. Under this interpretation, their interment in caches can be seen as a state ment about capacity to destroy maize wealth, which also makes it an honest statement about access and ability to create maize wealth. Likewise, export of maize wealth embodied in greenstone, especially carved and incised Olmec jadeite, is an honest advertise ment about the wealth of Gulf lowland individuals and factions. It is honest by constraint, because without the underlying quality—• wealth—it would be impossible for an individual or faction to export the wealth embodied on carved jades. Whereas Early Formative Olmec chiefs at San Lorenzo advertised their wealth and power to foreign audiences by exporting ceramics that acquired value through the effort expended to transport them across long dis tances, Middle Formative chiefs at La Venta preferred to export explicit embodiments of their superior access to maize wealth. In sum, during the Middle Formative, maize agriculture, Olmec prestige signaling, which had a long tradition in the Gulf lowlands, and Olmec maize symbolism became linked in a kind of coevolu tionary relationship. Taube (2000) has established the symbolic lin kages in this complex, whereas costly signaling theory establishes the causal linkages. The component traits of this complex were a legacy from Early Olmec Horizon times, but, as the productivity of maize agriculture increased during the Middle Formative, maize production became more and more central to the generation of wealth. In this context, advertisements about wealth and power focused increasingly on control over maize wealth, with embodied maize wealth (greenstone) being the medium for many of these statements. The memes of a belief system that centered on maize and identified greenstone as embodied maize were favored by cul tural selection that arose through the efforts by Gulf lowland people to create reliable signals of wealth and power. As a result, "the power and wealth accrued by their agricultural base is readily seen even today in their monumental art, architecture, and fine objects exquisitely worked in precious and exotic materials" (Taube 1996:101). Ultimately, this coevolving complex was also favored by natural selection. Use of productive maize varieties and planting practices had direct biological fitness effects that promoted their spread. The archaeological evidence for this effect includes increased site density during the Middle Formative in many regions, particularly lowland regions of eastern Mesoamerica (Love 1999, 2002), and penetration of agricultural populations into new areas (Robinson et al. 2005). Cultural traits linked to productive maize varieties and planting practices may not necessarily have had direct, positive biological fitness effects, but linkage to increasingly productive maize agricultural practices meant that they were favored by selec tion too. Favored by both cultural and natural selection, the Middle Formative package—productive maize agriculture and an elaborate ritual and symbolic system centered on maize—were passed on and became dominant features of later Mesoamerican societies. The result, as Covarrubias (1957) and others noted some time ago, is that when one examines artistic and symbolic representations from later periods, there is a clear Olmec heritage. Coe (1989) refers to this as the "continuity hypothesis." Continuity is especially clear between Olmec maize and wealth symbolism and that of the Maya (Scheie 1996; Taube 1996, 2000). The monuments and archi tectural stages for ritual performance constructed by the Maya (Nieman 1997; see also Demarest 1992) thus represent a legacy of prestige signaling that originated in Olmec monumental art, archi tecture, offerings, and other forms of wasteful ostentation. Classic Maya society was not an anomalous, mysterious cult invented in the jungles of northern Guatemala 1,800 years ago. Rather, it was the outcome of a long historical evolutionary process stretching</page><page sequence="12">118 Neff back to the mid-second millennium B.C. and to the Gulf lowland Olmec heartland. In effect, the complex of traits assembled during the Early and Middle Formative periods in the Gulf lowlands swamped competing cultural variants. The effect is analogous to swamping of genes and language by the genes and language of expanding early agricultural populations (Diamond and Bellwood 2003). By assembling a complex of subsistence, symbolic, ritual, and material culture traits that enjoyed relative success, the Gulf Olmec became Mesoamerica's metaphorical "mother culture." CONCLUSION If discussions of Early Formative Mesoamerica are to move beyond the "mother culture" vs. "sister culture" debate, as suggested by Blomster et al. (2005), Neff et al. (2006a), and Cheetham and Blomster (2010), a better basis for evaluating statements and infer ences about the Early Formative archaeological record will be useful. My premise here has been that explicit, mechanistic theory is a means for moving the discussion forward. "Mother culture" and "sister culture" are metaphors that sum marize a series of empirical generalizations that, in part, are in opposition. "Mother culture" advocates point to carved-basalt monuments and greater investment in architecture in the Olmec heartland, and argue that influence, indicated by exchanged cer amics and the spread of ceramic decorative motifs, emanated from the Gulf lowlands. "Sister culture" advocates point to early inno vations in public architecture in the highlands and widespread local production of carved-incised pottery, some with motifs never produced in the Gulf lowlands, and argue that many groups participated equivalently in the invention of Mesoamerican civiliza tion. Both metaphors summarize empirical patterning. Which is more valid? How can we choose between the two metaphors? It is possible empirically to evaluate some statements made by proponents of one or the other metaphor. For instance, my col leagues and I have shown elsewhere (Blomster 2005; Neff et al. 2006a, 2006b) that assertions made by sister-culture proponents (e.g., Flannery and Marcus 1994, 2000; Flannery et al. 2005; Stoltman et al. 2005) about Early Formative ceramic circulation pat terns are contradicted by a large ceramic provenance study. Yet, something is missing. Unbalanced ceramic exchange might seem, based on common sense, to be more compatible with the "mother culture" metaphor, but why? What are the specific inferential lin kages in this argument? Explicit theory fills in the connections between archaeological remains and inferences about history (e.g., Neiman 1995, 1997). Here, for instance, theory should clarify why both sides in the mother vs. sister culture debate view the ceramic provenance results as favoring the mother-culture metaphor, and why sister culture advocates (e.g., Flannery et al. 2005) would like to discredit those results. Costly signaling theory is useful in the Olmec debate because it supplies some of the inferential connections needed to understand wasteful cultural elaboration. It uses general evolutionary criteria (fitness payoffs) to make predictions about how signals would be designed by natural selection and other design forces (human problem solving and cultural selection). Prestige (or "symbolic capital") has a clear fitness benefit (access to mates), and therefore humans pursue prestige. Put another way, humans seek prestige for the same reason they seek enough food to eat, because they were designed to do so by natural selection in the context of escalating social transmission of adaptive information (Henrich and Gil-White 2001). There is a crucial design constraint in the evolution of prestige signaling systems, however—to be believable, a signal must be hard to fake. Audience members' interests are best served by accu rate assessment, so they pay attention to a signal only if the signal is directly and proportionally related to the underlying qualities. Individuals who do not possess underlying qualities worthy of prestige cannot convincingly advertise prestige, and they would waste their time and energy in the effort. This perspective pro vides a hypothesis about the origins of cultural elaboration, which otherwise makes little evolutionary sense: Because individ uals with superior access to resources can only reap the prestige rewards associated with superior access if they expend resources in elaborate ritual displays, many of the wasteful, elaborate struc tures that we see in the human-made world may be understood as prestige signals. Hypothesizing that the material record of Olmec cultural elabor ation can be understood as Zahavian costly signals directs our atten tion to the costs of monument design and interregional circulation of goods, to the ecological context of subsistence production, and other issues relevant to predictions about the scale of prestige signaling. It posits connections, for instance, between resource structure, audi ence size and variance in underlying phenotypic quality, and the scale of wasteful advertising. It also predicts different trajectories for different kinds of items used in interregional prestige signaling, depending on how easily they could be falsified. To some extent, these predictions can be addressed based on current evidence, as shown here, but the theory also provides a basis for designing new and betters tests in the future, some of which are mentioned elsewhere in this paper. Formally, costly signaling is about quantitative comparisons between phenotypes (Grafen 1990a, 1990b), which have not been attempted in this paper. For instance, since the marginal cost of sig naling should be lower for higher-quality phenotypes, they should signal more intensively. In the Olmec case, the existing record indi cates that signaling (commissioning a colossal head, for instance) took off earlier around San Lorenzo, where resource access may have been greatest, but available data do not yet permit a quantitat ive test of the hypothesis that greater resource access entailed lower marginal cost of signaling and greater signaling intensity. Thus, costly signaling not only provides a framework for understanding patterns in existing data, it also reveals inadequacies in existing data and indicates some of the requirements for creating more reliable data in the future. While the forgoing discussion indicates ways in which the mother culture and sister culture metaphors both contain grains of truth, the overall thrust of the costly signaling argument is that a number of distinctive features of Mesoamerican civilization origi nated as prestige displays among Early and Middle Formative popu lations of the Gulf lowlands. Ecological conditions in this region favored wealth and social status differentiation, and the coupling of prestige to advertisement of one's level of accumulation then led to investments by the Gulf Olmec in monumental architecture, monumental art, and interregional gift-giving. Symbolism intro duced as part of these Olmec signaling systems became integrated into the symbolism of later Mesoamerican societies. As a result, there is a cultural lineage expressed in material remains that stretches back to the Early Formative, the root of which is dominated by artis tic and symbolic inventions of the Gulf Olmec, Mesoamerica's metaphorical mother culture.</page><page sequence="13">Evolution of the Mesoamerican Mother Culture 119 RESUMEN Un debate corriente entre los mesoamericanistas se centra en el papel que jugaron los olmecas de la costa del Golfo en los orígenes de la civilización mesoamericana. Por un lado, investigadores como Covarrubias (1942, 1957), Bernal (1969), Coe y Diehl (1981; Diehl y Coe 1995), y Clark (1997) han argumentado que las olmecas introdujeron innovaciones claves y estimularon el desarrollo de otras áreas durante el formativo temprano y, consecuentemente, contribuyeron más que otras poblaciones al subsi guiente desarrollo del arte, simbolismo, instituciones políticas y otros rasgos de las sociedades de la región. Otra punta de vista, sostenido especial mente por Flannery (1968), Marcus (1989), Grove (1989). y Niederberger (2000), es que la contribución de las olmecas no fue más importante que las contribuciones de otras poblaciones contemporáneas. Algunas de las cuestiones circunvecinas a este debate se pueden resolver por medio de más investigación arqueológica, como han planteado Cheetham y Blomster recientemente en una sección especial de Ancient Mesoaméríca (2010, vol. 21, no. 1). Otra estrategia para avanzar la discusión es enfocar en el desarrollo de una teoría que pueda explicar a la vez la manifestación relativamente temprana de poder político dentro de las poblaciones del Golfo junto con la distribución extensa de rasgos materi ales asociados con los olmecas. Desarrollado en de la biología (Zahavi y Zahavi 1997) tanto como en las ciencias sociales (Veblen 1979 [1899]), la teoría de señalamiento costoso puede explicar la inversión de recursos hacia la construcción y mantenimiento de estructuras elaboradas, cuyos costos parecieran reducir la viabilidad de los individuos que los paga. Ejemplos biológicos incluyen la cola elaborada del pavo real, y el ejemplo sociológico original de Veblen (1979 [1899]) fue el consumo conspicuo de los ricos nuevos. La predicción central de la teoría es que sistemas de señalamiento para comuni car el valor de una calidad subyacente evolucionan hacia un estado en que solamente individuos que verdaderamente se caracterizan por cierto valor de la calidad pueden dar la evidencia de este valor. Por ejemplo, un individuo que tiene acceso superior a recursos podría querer que otros reconozcan sus capacidades, porque tal reconocimiento puede beneficiarlo en términos de prestigio o la deferencia mostrado por otros. Pero si todo el mundo puede hacer la misma señal, nadie pondrá atención y el sistema de señalamiento desapareciera. Por eso, la evolución favorece tendencias hacia una situación en que los individuos con los más altas valores de la característica subyacente invierten lo máximo en la advertencia de esta característica. En otras palabras, la predicción es que estructuras costosas evolucionan en el mundo biológico tanto como en el mundo cultural porque el costo asegura la veracidad de la señal en relación a la característica subyacente que es el objeto de la comunicación. Para el período formativo temprano de Mesoamérica. esta formulación provee expectativas sobre patrones materiales que se pueden observar en el registro arqueológico de elaboración cultural en la costa del Golfo y en cambios a través del tiempo en los patrones de interacción interregional.
